Also this year, because of NCCIC’s\ncentral importance to the Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s (DHS) cybersecurity mission, DHS Secretary Jeh\nC. Johnson emphasized the focus upon the NCCIC within\nthe DHS structure. In January, President Barack Obama\nvisited the NCCIC watch floor in Arlington, Virginia, to\nannounce his proposal for new cybersecurity legislation.\nIn August, the NCCIC’s third and latest watch floor went\noperational in Pensacola, Florida.\n\n2015 was clearly a big year for the NCCIC. After the\nPresident’s speech on the NCCIC watch floor in January, he\nthanked NCCIC personnel for doing a great job and said,\n“You are helping to keep the nation safe and secure.” I\nagree. I am proud of the hard work and commitment of the\nNCCIC team, and I am excited about the opportunity to play\na part in the important work they do. We look for ways to\nbe more effective every day, and we count on a continuing\ndialogue with our partners in government, industry, and\nthe critical infrastructure community to inform that path to\neffectiveness.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Felker, Director of Operations\nNCCIC\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\n\n**ICS-CERT**\n\nAs time and technology\nadvance, and as Americans\nincreasingly rely on CI to\nprovide many important\nservices, the Industrial\nControl Systems Cyber\nEmergency Response Team\n(ICS-CERT) continues to\npursue its mission to reduce\ncybersecurity risk to the\nNation’s CI.\n\nIn this 2015 Year in Review,\nwe look back on the accomplishments of ICS-CERT and\nsee continued growth and success. In May, ICS-CERT\nwas announced as runner-up for the 12th Annual U.S.\nGovernment Information Security Leadership Awards\n(GISLA) Community Awareness Award for its Action\nCampaign to educate CI asset owners about the BlackEnergy\nand Havex malware threat. This recognition exemplifies\nthe dedication of the ICS-CERT to protecting critical\ninfrastructure.\n\nIn FY 2015, ICS-CERT responded to 295 cyber incidents,\nhandled 486 vulnerabilities, performed in-depth analysis\non 175 malware samples, conducted 112 assessments,\nreleased two new versions of the Cyber Security Evaluation\nTool (CSET[®]), upgraded the Virtual Learning Portal, hosted\nmultiple regional trainings around the country, and hosted\ntwo successful Industrial Control Systems Joint Working\nGroup (ICSJWG) meetings in Washington, D.C., and\nSavannah, Georgia.\n\nAs we review ICS-CERT’s work at the close of another\nyear, I am once again impressed with the ICS-CERT team\nand proud of what they have accomplished. As we move\nforward, ICS-CERT will continue to work toward its mission\nand defend against whatever new cyber threats the year\n2016 brings.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarty Edwards, Director\nICS-CERT\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nICSJWG Government Coordinating Council (GCC) Chair\n\n\n-----\n\n#### NCCIC/ICS-CERT Introduction\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National\nCybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)\nis a 24x7 cyber situational awareness, incident response, and\nmanagement center that is a national nexus of cyber and\ncommunications integration for the Federal Government,\nintelligence community, and law enforcement. The NCCIC shares\ninformation among public and private sector partners to build\nawareness of vulnerabilities, incidents, and mitigations. The\nNCCIC vision is a secure and resilient cyber and communications\ninfrastructure that supports homeland security, a vibrant\neconomy, and the health and safety of the American people.\nThe NCCIC mission is to reduce the likelihood and severity of\nincidents that may significantly compromise the security and\nresilience of the Nation’s critical information technology and\ncommunications networks.\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team\n(ICS-CERT) is one of NCCIC’s four branches. ICS-CERT’s mission\nis to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure (CI) by\nstrengthening control systems security and resilience through\n\n\npublic-private partnerships. The United States depends on CI\nto support national defense, public health and safety, economic\nvitality, and overarching societal well-being. Disruptions or\nsignificant damage to CI could result in potentially catastrophic\nand cascading consequences to the Nation. Presidential Policy\nDirective-21 (PPD-21) identifies 16 CI sectors (see table below).\nICS-CERT works closely with government at all levels and the\nprivate sector to coordinate and share capabilities, services,\nand tools that help control systems owners and operators to\nprevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover\nfrom cyber threats and incidents. ICS-CERT’s activities include\nfour operations functions and four risk reduction functions.\nOperations functions include watch floor operations (Page 4),\nincident response (Page 6), vulnerability coordination (Page 7),\nand technical analysis (Page 8). Risk reduction functions include\ncybersecurity assessments (Page 10), distribution of the Cyber\nSecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET) (Page 11), training (Page 12),\nand Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)\nactivities (Page 14).\n\n\n### The NCCIC vision is a secure and resilient cyber\n   and communications infrastructure that supports\n homeland security, a vibrant economy, and the\n health and safety of the American people.\n\n\nChemical Dams Financial Services Information Technology\n\nCommercial Facilities Defense Industrial Base Food and Agriculture Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste\n\nCommunications Emergency Services Government Facilities Transportation Systems\n\nCritical Manufacturing Energy Healthcare and Public Health Water and Wastewater Systems\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FY 2015 Highlights and Accomplishments\n\n\n\n**• The President on the NCCIC Watch Floor: On January**\n\n13, 2015, the President of the United States visited\nthe NCCIC watch floor to discuss his proposal for new\ncybersecurity legislation. In his 10-minute speech, the\nPresident emphasized that cyber threats pose an enormous\nchallenge to the Nation and highlighted the need for\ngreater trust and information sharing and collaboration\nbetween the government and the private sector.\n\n- **ICS-CERT Runner-up for Industry Award: In**\n\nMay, ICS-CERT was announced as runner-up for the\n12th Annual U.S. Government Information Security\nLeadership Awards (GISLA) Community Awareness\nAward. ICS-CERT received the runner-up GISLA award\nfor its Action Campaign to educate CI asset owners\nabout the BlackEnergy and Havex malware threat.\n\n- **Incident Response: In FY 2015, ICS-CERT responded**\n\nto 295 cyber incidents. This represented a 20 percent\nincrease over FY 2014. The Critical Manufacturing\nSector nearly doubled to a record 97 incidents,\nbecoming the leading sector for ICS-CERT in FY 2015.\nThe Energy Sector had the second most incidents with\n46 incidents, and the Water and Wastewater Systems\nSector was third with 25.\n\n- **Vulnerability Coordination: ICS-CERT handled 486**\n\nvulnerabilities. The vulnerability coordination team also\nreduced the average number of days to close a ticket\nfrom 108 days in 2014 to 55 days in 2015 and closed\n76 percent of tickets that have been open over 365 days.\n\n- **Assessments: ICS-CERT conducted 112 onsite**\n\ncybersecurity assessments across eight of the 16 CI\nsectors in 22 states and Washington, D.C. Of these\n\n\n112 assessments, 38 were CSET assessments, 46 were\nDesign Architecture Review (DAR) assessments, and 28\nwere Network Architecture Verification and Validation\n(NAVV) assessments. In August, the assessments team\nalso released its annual report, “Industrial Control\nSystems Assessments FY 2014 Overview and Analysis.”\n\n- **Training: The ICS-CERT training program upgraded the**\n\nexisting Virtual Learning Portal (VLP) in August 2015.\nThis upgrade better aligns the program with the federal\nguidelines for cloud-based applications, improves the\ngraphical user interface, and reduces operational costs.\nThe new VLP will also facilitate the program’s goal of\noffering continuing education units.\n\n- **CSET 6.2 and 7.0: The CSET development team released**\n\ntwo new versions of CSET in 2015. The team released\nCSET 6.2 in January and CSET 7.0 in August. The\nlatest version includes a new interface, new standards,\nimproved functionality, and the ability to encrypt\nassessments files within CSET. In FY 2015, ICS-CERT\ndistributed 7,565 copies of CSET in 120 countries.\n\n- **NCCIC/ICS-CERT Becomes Operational in Pensacola,**\n\n**Florida: This year the NCCIC expanded watch floor**\noperations in Pensacola. In August, ICS-CERT reassigned\nits production chief from Arlington, Virginia, to\nPensacola. The senior watch officer began watch\noperations in Pensacola in September.\n\n- **GovDelivery: ICS-CERT launched a new digital**\n\nsubscription system with GovDelivery. New subscribers\nhave the capability to go to the website and sign up for\nICS-CERT announcements and products, including Alerts,\nAdvisories, Monitor Newsletters, and the Year in Review.\n\n\n-----\n\nBarry Bahler / DHS Public Affairs\n\n\n#### Watch Floor Operations\n\nNCCIC’s watch floor operations are the primary entry point\nfor threat, vulnerability, and incident reporting, as well as\nclassified and unclassified information dissemination from\nICS-CERT to its stakeholders. Watch floor operations serve\nas the operational “traffic cop” between stakeholders and\nICS-CERT by ingesting, triaging, and tracking incidents\nto resolution. Approximately two dozen analysts and\nincident handlers staff the NCCIC watch floor across three\ngeographically separate watch floor locations. NCCIC\nmaintains watch floor operations capabilities in Idaho\nFalls, Idaho; Pensacola, Florida; and Arlington, Virginia. The\nPensacola watch floor is the newest, becoming operational\nin August. Arlington watch floor operations are a physically\nintegrated component of and co-located with the primary\nNCCIC watch floor, while Idaho Falls and Pensacola are\nnetworked into NCCIC so that they can assume continuity of\noperations responsibilities during emergencies.\n\nNCCIC’s watch floor operations ensure proper operating\ntempo, coordinating with other ICS-CERT and NCCIC\ncomponents, the law enforcement and intelligence\ncommunity, and other external partners. NCCIC’s watch\nfloor operations provide all aspects of incident response\n\n\nservices, including digital media analysis and onsite\nresponse; recovery and mitigation support; vulnerability\ncoordination and disclosure; and situational awareness\nalerts and advisories to warn of cyber threats affecting the\nNation’s CI.\n\nICS-CERT works closely with Information Sharing and\nAnalysis Centers (ISACs), researchers, vendors, SectorSpecific Agencies (SSAs), industry associations, and other\npartners across the Nation’s 16 CI sectors to coordinate\ncyber risk reduction efforts. In fact, it is these strong\npartnerships with key stakeholders across all sectors and\ngovernment agencies that put ICS-CERT in the unique\nposition of providing clear situational awareness of the\nthreat landscape and associated defensive measures. Timely\nand accurate information is essential to cybersecurity\npreparedness.\n\nOther core watch operations functions include providing\ninput for briefings to senior government officials; supporting\nthe cybersecurity common operational picture by providing\nthreat information and analysis inputs; and leading\noperational information management processes, including\n\nf ’\n\n\n-----\n\nIn FY 2015, ICS-CERT continued significant outreach efforts\nto raise awareness of a sophisticated malware campaign that\nhas compromised several industrial control systems (ICS)\nenvironments using a variant of the BlackEnergy malware,\nnamed BlackEnergy2. This malware activity has been ongoing\nsince at least 2011, with the most recent activity observed in\nlate September 2014.\n\nICS-CERT conducted 6 webinars, 200 presentations,\nand 136 teleconferences for stakeholders to help them\nunderstand the threats to CI. At the request of stakeholders,\nICS-CERT published and distributed a presentation titled\n“Current Risks to Industrial Control Systems.” Included\nin the presentation was additional instruction specifically\nintended to assist recipients in briefing their organization\nwith this information. The presentation is located in our\nsecure portal and was distributed to all SSAs and formally\nrecognized ISACs. The presentation is intended to be\nshared within stakeholder organizations to raise awareness\nfor control system personnel, information technology\npersonnel, and up to C-Level executives (high-ranking\nexecutives, e.g., CEOs, CFOs, COOs).\n\nAt this time, DHS has not identified any attempts to damage,\nmodify, or otherwise disrupt any of the BlackEnergy 2 victim\nsystems’ control processes. ICS-CERT has not been able to verify\nif the intruders expanded access beyond the compromised\nhuman-machine interface (HMI) into the underlying control\n\n\nsystem, but the investigation is still ongoing. As of January\n2016, open-source reports have circulated alleging that a\nDecember 23, 2015, power outage in Ukraine was caused by\nBlackEnergy Malware. ICS-CERT and US-CERT are working\nwith the Ukrainian CERT and our international partners to\nanalyze the malware and can confirm that a BlackEnergy 3\nvariant was present in the system. Based on the technical\nartifacts ICS-CERT and US-CERT have been provided, we cannot\nconfirm a causal link between the power outage with the\npresence of the malware.\n\n_FY 2015 Incidents by Reporting Entity (295 total)_\n\n\n-----\n\nICS-CERT also collaborates with international and private\nsector Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs)\nto share control systems-related security incidents and\nmitigation measures. The coordination among these\npartners provides ICS-CERT with a unique perspective\nof the overall cyber risk landscape and emerging threats.\nICS-CERT conveys this information through outreach\nactivities, briefings, and information products, such as\nalerts and advisories, as well as technical information papers\nrecommending strategies for improving cyber defense.\n\nEvery year, new malware families target ICS-specific\nfunctionality, underscoring the evolving landscape and\nthe recognition by adversaries of high-stakes ICS targets.\nICS-CERT provides onsite incident response support,\nconducts technical analysis of artifacts and malware,\ndevelops mitigation strategies for owners and operators, and\nprovides configuration analysis on new systems to ensure\nsufficient detection and prevention of the evolving threats.\n\n\n###### Incident Response in FY 2015\nIn FY 2015, ICS-CERT received and responded to 295\nincidents. The Critical Manufacturing Sector accounted for\n97 of these incidents, while the Energy Sector had 46 and\nthe Water and Wastewater Systems Sector had 25. Spearphishing represented 37 percent of these incidents, making\nit the leading access vector for FY 2015 incidents reported\nto ICS-CERT. Network scanning and probing accounted for\n11 percent of ICS-CERT’s FY 2015 incidents. Federal partners\nwere once again the leading reporting source for incidents.\nThey reported 179 incidents, which accounted for 61 percent\nof FY 2015 incidents reported to ICS-CERT. Asset owners\nwere the second largest reporting source with 34 incidents,\naccounting for 12 percent of incidents reported. Researchers\nreported 30 incidents, accounting for 10 percent (see\nIncident Response FY 2015 Metrics on Page 17).\n\n\n-----\n\n486\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n231\n\n208\n178 186\n\n200\n\n100\n\n20\n\n\nThe primary objective of ICS-CERT’s vulnerability\ncoordination work is the timely mitigation of vulnerabilities\nto reduce the likelihood of a successful cyber attack against\nthe Nation’s CI. Vulnerability coordination requires technical\nexpertise, documentation, and close trusted partnerships\nwith key ICS community stakeholders, including vendors;\nmanufacturers; integrators; CI owners; researchers; federal,\nstate, and local government organizations; and international\npartners. ICS-CERT’s vulnerability handling process involves\nfive basic steps:\n\n_Detection/Collection. The vulnerability team collects_\nvulnerability reports through vulnerability analysis,\nmonitoring of public sources, and direct receipt of\nvulnerability information. Upon learning of a vulnerability\nor receiving a report, the team first eliminates duplicates\nand false alarms and then catalogs each vulnerability.\n\n_Analysis. Once the vulnerabilities are catalogued, the_\nvulnerability team and vendor analysts work to understand\nthe vulnerabilities by examining and identifying the issues,\nas well as the potential threat.\n\n_Mitigation Coordination. After analyzing a vulnerability, the team_\nworks with the vendor for mitigation and patch issuance.\nThe vulnerability team works with vendors to allow\nsufficient time to effectively resolve and perform patch\nregression testing against any given vulnerability.\n\n_Application of Mitigation. The vulnerability team works with_\nvendors to allow sufficient time for affected end users to\nobtain test and apply mitigation strategies prior to disclosure\n\n\n486\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n231\n\n208\n178 186\n\n200\n\n100\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n\n_Reported Vulnerabilities, FY 2010 through FY 2015_\n\n_Disclosure. After coordinating with vendors and gathering_\ntechnical and threat information, the team takes the\nappropriate steps to notify end users about vulnerabilities.\nICS-CERT strives to disclose accurate, neutral, objective\ninformation, and will reference other available information\nand correct misinformation when possible.\n\n###### Vulnerability Coordination in FY 2015\nIn FY 2015, the ICS-CERT vulnerability coordination\nteam handled 486 vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT reduced the\naverage number of days to close a ticket from 108 days\nin 2014 to 55 days in 2015 and closed 76 percent of\ntickets that had been open over 365 days. The vulnerability\ncoordination team gave presentations on two high visibility\nvulnerabilities at the DEF CON conference held in Las Vegas.\nThe presentations covered the Uconnect Jeep Fiat auto hack\nand Hospira medical pumps. ICS-CERT released six alerts\nas a result of its attendance at the DEF CON and Black Hat\nconferences. The vulnerability team again saw an increase in\nmedical device vulnerabilities. Notably, the team successfully\ncoordinated the release of patches and advisories for\nmedical devices with Baxter, Hospira, and the Food and\nDrug Administration.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Technical Analysis\n\nThe Advanced Analytical Laboratory (AAL) provides\ntechnical analysis in support of ICS-CERT’s mission to\nreduce risk to the Nation’s CI. Technical analysis includes\nall aspects of malware analysis, digital analysis, reverse\nengineering and longer-term analysis; exploring systemic\nvulnerabilities and potential future threats, tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures; and more intractable long-term\nproblems.\n\nThe AAL also provides research and analysis capabilities\nin support of the incident response, assessment, and\nvulnerability coordination activities of ICS-CERT. The AAL’s\nexpert cybersecurity researchers can respond to cyber\nincidents with both onsite and remote capacity. When\npossible, analytical efforts are performed remotely in a\nlaboratory environment using custom tools and techniques.\nIn some cases, however, onsite analysis is required, and a\nteam is deployed to perform analytical efforts directly on\nthe owner’s network.\n\n\npublish multiple alerts warning the ICS community of the\nthreat and provide information for detecting and mitigating\nintrusion activity.\n\nAlso in FY 2015, the AAL continued to focus on automating\nand streamlining the lab’s analytical capabilities. Initial\nefforts have begun to shift the AAL’s output to a Structured\nThreat Information Expression (STIX) based format. When\ncompleted, this effort will allow the AAL to provide threat\ninformation in an automated, machine-readable format that\nwill reduce the amount of time necessary to provide this\ndata to customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAs a core part of its mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s\nCI, ICS-CERT provides onsite cybersecurity assessments to CI\nasset owners and operators to strengthen the cybersecurity\nposture of their ICS. ICS-CERT assessments are based on\nstandards, guidelines, and best practices and are provided\nto CI asset owners and operators at no cost using our\nCongressional funding. The assessment methodology\nprovides a structured framework that asset owners and\noperators can use repeatedly to assess, re-assess, protect,\ndetect, and continually validate the cybersecurity of their\nICS networks. The information gained from assessments also\nprovides stakeholders with the understanding and context\nnecessary to build effective defense-in-depth processes for\nenhancing their cybersecurity posture.\n\nICS-CERT’s onsite cybersecurity assessment services include\nguided Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) assessments,\nDesign Architecture Review (DAR) assessments, and\nNetwork Architecture Verification and Validation (NAVV)\nassessments.\n\nCSET is a stand-alone software tool used to conduct\ncybersecurity assessments (see CSET section on Page 11.)\nThe DAR assessment provides ICS asset owners with a\ncomprehensive evaluation and discovery process, focusing\non defense strategies associated with an asset owner’s\nspecific control systems network. The DAR includes an\nin-depth review and evaluation of the control system’s\nnetwork design, configuration, interdependencies, and its\n\n\napplications. ICS-CERT provides a detailed DAR report, and\nwith expert consultation, positions the requesting facility’s\nICS for improved security and resiliency.\n\nThe NAVV assessment provides a sophisticated analysis of\nnetwork packet-data, which is collected by the asset owners\nfrom within their control system network environment.\nICS-CERT passively analyzes the data using a combination\nof open source and commercially available tools, and\ndevelops detailed representation of the communications\nflows and relationships between devices. The NAVV also\nprovides a practical method for asset owners to baseline the\ndeterministic network traffic occurring within the control\nsystems environment. In addition, the service offering\nprovides asset owners with a means to identify anomalous\nand potentially suspicious communications sourced from,\nor destined for, control systems assets.\n\n###### Assessments in FY 2015\nIn FY 2015, ICS-CERT conducted 112 onsite cybersecurity\nassessments across eight of the 16 CI sectors in 22 states\nand the District of Columbia. Of these 112 assessments, 38\nwere CSET assessments, 46 were DAR assessments, and 28\nwere NAVV assessments (see Assessment FY 2015 Metrics\non Page 18).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CSET[®]\n\nThe Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) is a stand-alone\nsoftware tool that guides asset owners and operators\nthrough a step-by-step process to analyze their ICS and\nIT network security practices using many recognized\ngovernment and industry standards and recommendations.\nCSET provides a systematic, disciplined, and repeatable\napproach for evaluating an organization’s security posture.\n\nICS-CERT released two new versions of the CSET tool in\n2015: CSET 6.2 in January, and CSET 7.0 in August.\n\nCSET 6.2 introduced two new standards: 1) the Committee\non National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 1253\n(ICS), Security Categorization and Control Selection for\nNational Security Systems, Baseline Update; and 2) the\nNorth American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) Critical\nInfrastructure Protection (CIP), Revision 5. Additional\nenhancements included revisions to the network diagram\ninterface, the ability to model multiple services in a single\ncomponent on the diagram, Grass Marlin integration,\nadditional Department of Defense (DOD) identification\nfields and export capabilities, and the addition of a new\nSecurity Assurance Level determination wizard that allows\nusers to add special factors from the National Institute\n\n\nof Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication\n800-60.\n\nCSET 7.0 introduced three new standards: 1) the\nCybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2), Version\n1.1; 2) DOD Instruction 8510.01, Risk Management\nFramework (RMF) for DOD Information Technology (IT);\nand 3) the National Institute of Standards and Technology\nInteragency Report (NISTIR) 7628 Volume 1, Revision\n1, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity. Additional\nenhancements included a complete redesign of the interface\nfor a more intuitive experience, increased use of tabbed\nsections throughout the application, additional instructional\n“landing pages” at each major step in the process,\nconsolidation of existing tabs on the diagram screen to\nrefine network drawing time, improved responsiveness\nof the questions screen, the ability to support multiple\nscreen resolutions (including mobile and large resolution\ncapability), and encryption capability within CSET.\n\nIn FY 2015, ICS-CERT distributed 7,565 copies of CSET\nin 120 countries. In addition to independent assessments,\nCSET was used in 38 assessments performed by the\nICS-CERT assessment team.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Houston, Texas\nICS-CERT Regional Training, October 2014.\n\n\n#### Training\n\nTraining is a fundamental component of any robust\ncybersecurity strategy. ICS-CERT continues to support CI\nsectors and the control system community by offering\nmultiple training courses, ranging in difficulty, at numerous\nlocations around the country and online. These trainings\nare provided specifically for personnel responsible for\nthe oversight, design, and operation of control systems.\nAll courses are offered free of\ncharge. In FY 2015, online and\nclassroom course materials\nwere updated multiple times to\ninclude the latest data on threats\nand vulnerabilities and their\nappropriate mitigations from\ncybersecurity experts. ICS-CERT\nis currently sponsoring 15\ntraining courses.\n\nICS-CERT online training courses\nare as follows:\n\n - Operational Security\n\n(OPSEC) for Control\nSystems (100W)\n\n - Differences in Deployments\n\nof ICS (210W-01)\n\n - Influence of Common\n\nIT Components on ICS\n(210W-02)\n\n - Common ICS Components (210W-03)\n\n\n\n - Cybersecurity within IT and ICS Domains (210W-04)\n\n - Cybersecurity Risk (210W-05)\n\n - Current Threat Trends in ICS (210W-06)\n\n - Current Vulnerability Trends in ICS (210W-07)\n\n - Determining the Impacts of a Cybersecurity Incident\n\n(210W-08)\n\n               - Attack Methodologies in\nIT and ICS (210W-09)\n\n              - Mapping IT Defense-InDepth Security Solutions to\nICS (210W-10).\n\nThe 100W course is\ndesigned to increase\nawareness and provide\nstudents the tools to\nrecognize potential\nweaknesses in daily\noperations. The 210W\nseries of courses are\ndesigned to cover a broad\nrange of topics related to\ncybersecurity for control\nsystems. For the most\ncomprehensive training,\nthey should be taken in\norder, 210W-01 through 210W-10. In FY 2015, 8,804\nprofessionals registered for online training.\n\n\n###### Phoenix, Arizona\nICS-CERT Regional Training, April 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Salt Lake City, Utah\nICS-CERT Regional Training, June 2015.\n\n\nICS-CERT classroom training courses are as follows:\n\n - Introduction to Control Systems Cybersecurity (101)\n\n - Intermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control\n\nSystems (201), lecture only\n\n - Intermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control\n\nSystems (202), with lab/exercises\n\n - Advanced Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems\n\n(301), with lab/exercises.\n\n\nThe 101, 201, and 202\ncourses are presented\nin various locations,\nmultiple times per year.\nAccompanying networks\nare used to demonstrate\nexploits and mitigation\ntactics in the numerous\nexercises. In FY 2015,\nregional training sessions\nwere hosted for over 800\nattendees in Houston,\nTexas; Phoenix, Arizona;\nSalt Lake City, Utah; and\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\n\n_Regional Training in Salt Lake City._\n\n\nThe 301 course is taught in\nIdaho Falls, Idaho, and includes a week of hands-on training\nfeaturing a very competitive Red Team / Blue Team exercise\nthat takes place within an actual control systems environment.\nICS-CERT Training presented this course 12 times in FY 2015\nand hosted 484 students.\n\n\nAs part of its mission to continually provide first-rate\nresponse to reported cybersecurity incidents, ICS-CERT\nconducted a job and task analysis for the NCCIC incident\nhandler job functions. Based on results from the analysis,\na new training program is being developed to incorporate\nboth onsite and remote incident response responsibilities.\n\nIn FY 2015, the Virtual Learning Portal (VLP) was upgraded.\nThe VLP is an online application for the administration,\ndocumentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of training\n\ncourses.

ICS-CERT will continue\ncoordination efforts with industry and government partners\nto mitigate cyber risks to CI through timely and effective\nsharing of situational awareness information and focused\nmitigation strategies.\n\nTo handle increased demand for onsite assessments,\nICS-CERT is hiring additional personnel and will pursue\nmore one-on-one engagements with CI asset owners on\nthe use of DARs and NAVVs and assist them in identifying\ngaps and developing strategies for improving their defensive\nposture. A new responsibility in 2016 is to assist federal\nfacilities with control systems assessments. Federal facilities\nare becoming more aware of vulnerabilities and threat\nvectors that can impact their control systems operations\nsimilar to private sector CI facilities.\n\nOther goals for 2016 include improving and expanding\nICS-CERT incident response technical teams and tools,\nwhich will provide greater value during incident response\nand assessment activities. We will continue to refine and\nupdate training offerings that will allow CI asset owners\nto better meet the demands of challenging and evolving\ntechnical issues in control system security.\n\n\nICS-CERT will expand its presence in Pensacola beyond\nwatch operations to include incident response and site\nassessment personnel. ICS-CERT will continue to hold\nbiannual ICSJWG meetings in 2016 as we continue our\npublic private partnership collaboration. Through our\ninteractions with asset owners, vendors, and researchers,\nwe receive many requests for more information about\nour work, so we will provide a 2015 version of our site\nassessment work similar to what we published for 2014.\nIn addition, we plan to develop vulnerability and incident\nresponse reports with detailed information from our work\nin 2015.\n\nIt is uncertain what new cybersecurity threats will emerge\nin 2016, but ICS-CERT stands prepared to react quickly and\nevolve to meet the challenge. We will continue our efforts\nto help CI asset owners prevent attacks or mitigate their\nharmful effects like we have for over a decade. We will make\nour alerts and advisories more actionable with additional\ninformation, e.g., Yara Rules and instructions for Yara use, to\nfurther assist CI asset owners. In addition, we are looking to\nimprove the distribution of our information through newly\nformed ISACs in oil and natural gas (ONG) and foresee the\ndevelopment of additional Information Sharing and Analysis\nOrganizations (ISAOs) to share with the private sector.
