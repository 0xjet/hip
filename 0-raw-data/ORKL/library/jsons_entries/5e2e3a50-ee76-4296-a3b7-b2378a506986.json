The FritzFrog botnet uses a proprietary peer-to-peer\n(P2P) architecture for command and control (C&C) communications — the bots don’t get\ncommands from a central server, but from any other device on its network.\n\nFritzFrog has targeted SSH servers — it uses a simple brute-force technique to obtain their\ncredentials — and once it has established an SSH session, it drops the malware and\nexecutes it.\n\nThe malware then waits for commands from its operators, including for transferring files,\nrunning scripts and binary payloads, deploying a cryptocurrency miner, and eliminating other\nminers from the compromised system. It also starts scanning IP addresses to spread further.\n\n[FritzFrog emerged in January 2020 and it was detailed by micro-segmentation technology](https://www.securityweek.com/fritzfrog-botnet-uses-proprietary-p2p-protocol)\nstartup Guardicore in August 2020. Shortly after Guardicore’s warning, the botnet seemed to\ndisappear. However, it returned in December 2021 with new capabilities and many attack\nattempts — attacks peaked at 500 per day.\n\n[Akamai, which acquired Guardicore in 2021, warned last week that at least 1,500 hosts had](https://www.securityweek.com/akamai-acquire-guardicore-600m-zero-trust-tech-deal)\nbeen infected. The content delivery and security giant said the botnet has been seen\ntargeting cloud instances, routers, and data center servers around the world.\n\nA large concentration of victims has been seen in China, Central Europe and the United\nStates. Targeted sectors include healthcare, higher education and government, and the list of\nvictims singled out by Akamai includes a European TV network, a Russian healthcare\nequipment manufacturer, and East Asian universities.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Akamai, FritzFrog is often updated and there is some indication that its\ndevelopers might be preparing to target WordPress servers. The company’s researchers\nalso noticed that FritzFrog contains functionality for creating a Tor proxy chain that would\nhelp it become more resilient. However, the Tor proxy chain functionality has yet to be used\nby the malware.\n\nOther changes observed by Akamai include the use of a public Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)\nlibrary that the malware leverages to copy itself to a compromised server, and a hardcoded\nblocklist for ensuring that the malware avoids systems with low resources and certain IP\naddresses — for instance, ones that may be botnet sinkholes.\n\nThe SCP library used by FritzFrog appears to have been developed by someone in China,\nand the cryptocurrency mining activity has been linked to wallets previously tied to Chinese\nthreat actors. In addition, roughly one-third of the infected systems appear to be located in\nChina.\n\n“These points of evidence, while not damning, lead us to believe a possible link exists to an\nactor operating in China, or an actor masquerading as Chinese,” Akamai said.\n\n[The company has shared indicators of compromise (IOCs), as well as a free tool that can be](https://github.com/guardicore/labs_campaigns/tree/master/FritzFrog)\nused to detect the presence of FritzFrog on SSH servers.\n\n**Related:** **Mirai Botnet Starts Exploiting OMIGOD Flaw as Microsoft Issues More**\n**Guidance**\n\n**Related:** **[Mirai-Based 'Manga' Botnet Targets Recent TP-Link Vulnerability](https://www.securityweek.com/mirai-based-manga-botnet-targets-recent-tp-link-vulnerability)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Related:** **[Massive Android Botnet Hits Smart TV Ad Ecosystem](https://www.securityweek.com/massive-android-botnet-hits-smart-tv-ad-ecosystem)**\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n[Eduard Kovacs (@EduardKovacs) is a contributing editor at SecurityWeek.
