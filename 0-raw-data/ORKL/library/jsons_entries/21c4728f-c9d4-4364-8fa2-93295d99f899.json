Transactions to\nCryptoShuffler's Bitcoin wallet reached their peak in late 2016, but Kaspersky Lab detected\na new campaign in June 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware described is a perfect example of a rational gain, said Sergey Yunakovsky,\nKaspersky Lab malware analyst. \"The scheme of its operation is simple and effective: no\naccess to pools, no network interaction, and no suspicious processor load.\"\n\n[CryptoShuffler's Bitcoin wallet currently holds 23.21 Bitcoin, worth over $150,000 at today's](https://blockchain.info/address/1v9UCfygQf3toN1vA5xyr7LhKmv9QWcwZ)\n(record) Bitcoin price of $6,544.\n\n## CryptoShuffler targets other cryptocurrencies as well\n\nBesides Bitcoin, crooks also targeted wallets for other cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin,\nLitecoin, Dash, Ethereum, Monero, and Zcash.\n\nThe funds in the wallets for the other cryptocurrencies aren't pennies either, ranging from\ntens to thousands of US dollars.\n\nCryptoShuffler is one of the most successful malware families targeting cryptocurrencies to\ndate. For example, another malware author wasted months scanning for vulnerable IIS\nservers to install a Monero miner, [only to make $63,000.
