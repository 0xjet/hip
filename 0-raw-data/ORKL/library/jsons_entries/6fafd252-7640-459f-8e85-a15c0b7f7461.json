Even though at that time the author claimed the malware was still under\ndevelopment, it actually already had multiple capabilities and was basically almost in the goto market phase.\n\nFurthermore, the authors of SOVA showed a roadmap with the future update of the malware\nas shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Roadmap of SOVA (September 2021)\nUntil March 2022, multiple versions of SOVA were found and some of these features were\nalready implemented, such as: 2FA interception, cookie stealing and injections for new\ntargets and countries (e.g. multiple Philippine banks).\n\nIn July 2022, we discovered a new version of SOVA (v4) which presents new capabilities and\nseems to be targeting more than 200 mobile applications, including banking apps and crypto\nexchanges/wallets.\n\nFigure 2 – Main countries targeted by SOVA v4\n\n\n-----\n\n## Updates - SOVA v4\n\nStarting from May 2022, Threat Actors (TAs) behind SOVA have started to deliver a new\nversion of their malware, hiding within fake Android applications that show up with the logo of\na few famous ones, like Chrome, Amazon, NFT platform or others.\n\nFigure 3 – Main icons used by SOVA v4\nDifferently from the previous versions, this time several new codes were added. The most\ninteresting part is related to the VNC capability. As shown in Figure 1, this feature has been\nin the SOVA roadmap since September 2021 and that is one strong evidence that TAs are\nconstantly updating the malware with new features and capabilities.\n\nStarting from SOVA v4, TAs can obtain screenshots of the infected devices, to retrieve more\ninformation from the victims. Furthermore, the malware is also able to record and obtain any\nsensitive information, as shown in Figure 5. These features, combined with Accessibility\nservices, enable TAs to perform gestures and, consequently, fraudulent activities from the\n[infected device, as we have already seen in other Android Banking Trojans (e.g. Oscorp or](http://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/ubel-oscorp-evolution)\n[BRATA).](https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/brata-is-evolving-into-an-advanced-persistent-threat)\n\nWith SOVA v4, TAs are able to manage multiple commands, such as: screen click, swipe,\ncopy/paste and the capability to show an overlay screen to hide the screen to the victim.\nHowever, it was observed that multiple logs information are still sent back to the C2. This\nbehavior is a strong indicator that SOVA is still going through a development process, while\nTAs are rolling out new features and capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – Code comparison between SOVA v3 and v4\n\nFigure 5 – Casting/Recording feature of SOVA v4\nMoreover, in SOVA v4, the cookie stealer mechanism was refactored and improved. In\nparticular, TAs specified a comprehensive list of Google services that they are interested to\nsteal (e.g. Gmail, GPay, and Google Password Manager), plus a list of other applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor each of the stolen cookies, SOVA will also collect additional information such as is\nhttpOnly”, its expiration date, etc.\n\nFigure 6 – Refactoring and improvement of the cookie stealer mechanism in SOVA v4\nAnother interesting update about SOVA v4 is the refactoring of its “protections” module,\nwhich aims to protect itself from different victim’s actions. For example, if the user tries to\nuninstall the malware from the settings or pressing the icon, SOVA is able to intercept these\nactions and prevent them (through the abuse of the Accessibilities) by returning to the home\nscreen and showing a toast (small popup) displaying “This app is secured”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Protections code comparison between SOVA v3 and v4\nA peculiarity of SOVA v4 is the “core” relocation of the malware. Like the main Android\nbanking trojan, SOVA uses the .apk just to unpack a .dex file which contains the real\nmalicious functionalities of the malware. In the previous version, SOVA stored the .dex file\ninside the directory of the app, while in the current version it uses a device's shared storage\ndirectory (“Android/obb/”) to store it.\n\nLastly, in SOVA v4, an entire new module was dedicated to Binance exchange and the\n**Trust** **Wallet (official crypto wallet of Binance). For both applications, TAs aim to obtain**\ndifferent information, like the balance of the account, different actions performed by the victim\ninside the app and, finally, even the seed phrase (a collection of words) used to access the\ncrypto wallet.\n\n## C2 communications and panel\n\nThe communications between SOVA v4 and the C2 didn’t change compared to the previous\nversion (v3), except for the new command (vncinfo) used for its new VNC feature.\nMeanwhile, also the C2 panel of SOVA was updated compared to the first version published\nby the author in September 2021, with some new features and a complete UI restyle (as\nshown in Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 – Comparison between SOVA C2 panels\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Comparison between SOVA configuration files\n\n## New Targets\n\nThe first version of SOVA had almost 90 targeted applications (including banks, crypto\nwallet/exchange, and generic shopping apps), initially listed and stored in the packageList.txt\nfile within the assets/ folder. In the latest samples, this file has been removed and the\ntargeted applications are managed through the communications between the malware and\nthe C2.\n\nThe number of targeted applications has grown faster, compared to the initial phases of\nSOVA: during March 2022 multiple Philippine banks have been added and then during May\n2022, another list of banking applications has been added too, as shown in the following\nFigure 10.\n\nFigure 10 – Comparison between SOVA targets, from September 2021 to July 2022\nTo obtain the list of targeted applications, SOVA sends the list of all applications installed on\nthe device to the C2, right after it has been installed. At this point, the C2 sends back to the\nmalware the list of addresses for each targeted application and stores this information inside\nan XML file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 – Example of communication between SOVA v4 and the C2 server\n\nFigure 12 – Example of fake page used to steal credentials and credit card information\nAnother interesting fact is that, in some of the analyzed samples of SOVA v4, the list of CIS\nregion used in the previous versions (used to exclude these countries from attacks) was\nremoved and, at the time of writing, all the initial Russian and Ukraine targeted apps were\nremoved.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 – List of CIS region remove in one of the sample of SOVA v4\n\n## Further updates - SOVA v5\n\nDuring the reviewing of the document on SOVA v4, we spotted on our threat intelligence\nplatform (Cleafy ASK) multiple samples that seem to belong to a further variant of SOVA\n(v5); we want to provide you with an overview of this variant too.\n\nAnalyzing the code of the malware, it is possible to observe a big refactoring of the code, the\naddition of new features and some small changes in the communications between the\nmalware and the C2 server. Furthermore, the samples of SOVA v5 that we analyzed don’t\npresent the VNC module that we observed in SOVA v4: our hypothesis is that it was simply\nnot integrated in the v5version yet. In fact, the malware seems to be still under development,\ndue to the presence of multiple logs used for debugging.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 – List of commands of SOVA v5\nAlthough there are several changes, the most interesting features added in SOVA v5 is the\nransomware module, that was announced in the roadmap of September 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, even though this feature has been already implemented in the current version (v5),\nat the time of writing it seems to be still under development.\n\nThe aim of TAs is to encrypt the files inside the infected devices through an AES algorithm\nand renaming them with the extension “.enc”.\n\nThe ransomware feature is quite interesting as it’s still not a common one in the Android\nbanking trojans landscape. It strongly leverages on the opportunity arises in recent years, as\nmobile devices became for most people the central storage for personal and business data.\n\nFigure 15 – Ransomware module of SOVA v5\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWith the discovery of SOVA v4 and SOVA v5, we uncovered new evidence about how TAs\nare constantly improving their malware and the C2 panel, honouring the published roadmap.\n\nAlthough the malware is still under development, it’s ready to carry on fraudulent activities at\nscale.\n\n‍\n\n**Appendix 1: IOCs**\n\n\n-----\n\n**IoC** **Description**\n\n0533968891354ac78b45c486600a7890 SOVA v4\n\nca559118f4605b0316a13b8cfa321f65 SOVA v4 without CIS regions\n\nsocrersutagans.]site C2 of SOVA v4\n\nomainwpatnlfq.]site Server used to display fake website of targeted\napp\n\n74b8956dc35fd8a5eb2f7a5d313e60ca SOVA v5\n\nsatandemantenimiento.com C2 of SOVA v5\n\nhttp://wecrvtbyutrcewwretyntrverfd.xyz C2 of SOVA v5\n\n\n-----",
