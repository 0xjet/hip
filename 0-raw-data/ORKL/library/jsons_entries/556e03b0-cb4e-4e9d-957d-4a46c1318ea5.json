    "plain_text": "# What malware to look for if you want to prevent a ransomware attack\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/malware-before-ransomware-trojan-information-stealer-cobalt-strike](https://intel471.com/blog/malware-before-ransomware-trojan-information-stealer-cobalt-strike)**\n\nOrganizations are never going to stop ransomware attacks by looking for the ransomware.\n\nWhen it comes to ransomware attacks, threat actors often spend time on an organization’s\nnetworks for weeks (if not months) before the actual ransomware is launched. While these\nactors go to great lengths to mask their tracks, there are clues that can unearth the possibility\nof a ransomware attack before the actual ransomware shows up on an organization’s system.\nIn order to do this, however, organizations need to know what to look for before it’s too late.\n\nThe following is a breakdown of what malware organizations should be on the lookout for in\norder to thwart a ransomware attack. While the presence of these particular kinds of malware\ndoes not automatically mean a ransomware attack is imminent, awareness of their utility will\nhelp security teams proactively protect their systems from the crippling, expensive impact of\na ransomware incident.\n\n**Trojans**\n\nOne of the most common malware families on the internet, trojans are often used by\nmalicious actors as an initial way to gain access to an organization’s network. Often delivered\nin some form of a phishing attack, trojans present attackers with the ability to siphon data\nfrom networks, leave a gateway for further malware delivery, or both.\n\nOver the past decade, trojans were primarily used to siphon banking credentials, as attackers\nfocused on obtaining access to financial accounts. With the rise in ransomware, threat actors\nhave fine-tuned trojans to uncover credentials that can give them unfettered access to an\norganization’s network.\n\nA prime example of how trojans are used to set up ransomware attacks can be seen in the\nconnection between Emotet and Conti. Intel 471 researchers recently discovered that Conti\nuses Emotet to gain a foothold in organizations’ networks, then allows ransomware operators\nto pick targets from a pool of infected organizations. Conti has made Emotet a key part of\ntheir attack chain, specifically since Emotet was re-launched in November 2021.\n\nOther trojans that have been used in recent ransomware attacks include QbotIcedID (aka\nBokBot), and ZLoader. Intel 471 researchers have noticed that the Conti group appears to\nhave dropped BazarLoader in favor of a new malware called Bumblebee, which follows\n[research from Google stating that Bumblebee has been used by an access broker with ties to](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\nConti. Intel 471 researchers have observed Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Sliver (an open-source\nbackdoor programmed in Go), and IcedID as Bumblebee payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Information Stealers**\n\nWhile information stealers are close in functionality to trojans, there can be slight differences\nbetween the two kinds of malware. Trojans will often steal information that is being entered\ninto a machine (i.e. a keylogger), while information stealers are programmed to steal\ncredentials and other information that is already stored on a machine.\n\nInfo stealers can collect all sorts of information, including browser cookies, autofill data,\ncryptocurrency wallets, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients and desktop applications. Threat\nactors use this information to search for high-level credentials that can allow them to move\nfreely within an organization’s network, find further high-value data they want to steal, and\nlocations where they need to deploy ransomware in order to lock an organization’s system.\n\nSome ransomware crews have re-formulated info stealers that were used for a variety of\ncrimes in the past, while others have created new ones specifically for their own use. Malware\nknown as “StealBit” is used as an info stealer to support affiliates of LockBit ransomware.\nRather than a conventional stealer designed for harvesting data from browsers, StealBit\noperates as a file grabber, allegedly cloning folders from corporate networks to the LockBit\nvictim shaming blog in almost no time.\n\nOther information stealers that have been used in ransomware attacks are KPOT, Mars,\nRaccoon, Redline and Vidar.\n\n**Penetration testing tools**\n\nThere is a bevy of tools used by legitimate security professionals that have been co-opted into\nthe attack chain of ransomware operators. While these tools are purchased and licensed by\n[their developers, this software is often copied, cracked, or reversed engineered to serve](https://www.quora.com/What-is-cracked-software)\nransomware gangs’ nefarious purposes. These gangs often use these programs to further\nmove throughout a network, and siphon administrative credentials that pave the way for\nransomware attacks.\n\nCobalt Strike is one of these popular tools that has been embraced by ransomware gangs.\nThese gangs and their affiliates use Cobalt Strike as a second-stage payload for many\nmalware campaigns across many malware families. Intel 471 researchers have observed\nCobalt Strike being delivered via Hanictor, SystemBC and Trickbot to further facilitate\ncredential harvesting, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment. Additionally, the\nConti ransomware group tried to buy a legitimate license for Cobalt Strike through a shell\ncompany made to look like a legitimate security enterprise.\n\nMimikatz, initially created by a security researcher to learn how Microsoft's authentication\nprotocols were vulnerable to attacks, is a very popular tool amongst cybercriminals. Intel 471\nresearchers have observed several ransomware-as-a-service operations, including ALPHV,\nAvosLocker, and SunCrypt, use Mimikatz to harvest credentials from privileged network\nadministrators\n\n\n-----\n\nMetasploit is similar to Mimikatz in that it s open source, but provides a wide array of addons that allow users to perform an extensive amount of tasks. Modules can be placed into\nMetasploit that allow for similar tasks like those in the malware listed above including\nkeylogging, information stealing and the ability to drop further malware. Intel 471\nresearchers observed Conti and LockBit 2.0 recruiting developers that had experience\ndeploying or working with Metasploit.\n\n**Not a panacea**\n\nTo be clear: setting up a security strategy that only looks for these types of malware is not\nsustainable. Vulnerabilities still need to be patched, phishing emails will still be sent, and\nemployees could still be targets of social engineering scams. However, being proactive about\nthis specific malware may force attackers to move on from your organization and find a\ndifferent target. Ignoring malware prior to a ransomware attack is a recipe for disaster.\n\n**_May 12, 2022: This blog has been edited to include that Google has made a connection_**\n_between the Bumblebee loader and the Conti cybercriminal group._\n\n\n-----",
