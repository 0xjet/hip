This year, ransomware is no less active than before:\n[cybercriminals continue to threaten nationwide retailers and](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/the-works-close-stores-cyber-attack-uk-security-breach) [enterprises, old variants of](https://www.nordex-online.com/en/2022/04/update-on-cyber-security-incident/)\nmalware return while the new ones develop. Watching and assessing these tendencies not\nonly provides us with threat intelligence to fight cybercrime today, but also helps us deduce\nwhat trends may see in the months to come and prepare for them better.\n\nIn the report, we analyze what happened in late 2021 and 2022 on both the technological\nand geopolitical levels and what caused the new ransomware trends to emerge. First, we will\nreview the trend of cross-platform ransomware development that is becoming more and\nmore widespread among threat actors. Next, we will concentrate on how the ransomware\ngangs continue to industrialize and evolve into real businesses by adopting techniques of\nbenign software companies. Last, we will delve into how ransomware gangs put on a political\nhat and engaged in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Trend #1: Threat actors are trying to develop cross-platform ransomware to be as adaptive as possible\n\nAs a consequence of the Big Game Hunting (BGH) scheme that has become increasingly\npopular over the years, cybercriminals have been penetrating more and more complex\nenvironments where a wide variety of systems are running. In order to cause as much\ndamage as possible and to make recovery very difficult (if not impossible), they try to encrypt\nas many systems as possible. This means that their ransomware should be able to run on\ndifferent combinations of architectures and operation systems.\n\nOne way to overcome this is to write the ransomware in a “cross-platform programming\nlanguage” such as Rust or Golang. There are a few other reasons to use a cross-platform\nlanguage. For example, even though the ransomware might be aimed at one platform at the\nmoment, writing it in a cross platform makes it easier to port it to other platforms. Another\nreason is that analysis of cross-platform binaries is a bit harder than that of malware written\nin plain C.\n\nIn our crimeware reporting section on the Threat Intelligence Platform we cover some of\nthese ransomware variants that work on different platforms. The following are the most\nimportant highlights from these reports.\n\n### Conti cross-platform functionality\n\nConti is a group conducting BGH, targeting a wide variety of organizations across the globe.\nJust like many other BGH groups, it uses the double extortion technique as well as an\naffiliate-based structure.\n\nWe noticed that only certain affiliates have access to a Linux variant of the Conti\nransomware, targeting ESXi systems. It supports a variety of different command-line\narguments that can be used by the affiliate to customize the execution. The version for Linux\nsupports the following parameters:\n\n**Parameter** **Description**\n\n–detach The sample is executed in the background and it is detached from the\nterminal\n\n–log For debugging purposes, with a filename specified, Conti will write the\nactions to a log file\n\n–path Conti needs this path to encrypt the system. With the selected path, the\nransomware will encrypt the entire folder structure recursively\n\n–prockiller This flag allows the ransomware to kill those processes that have the\nselected files for encryption\n\n\n-----\n\n–size Function not implemented\n\n–vmlist Flag used to skip virtual machines during the encryption process\n\n–vmkiller It will terminate all the virtual machines for the ESXi ecosystem\n\n**_Conti parameters (Linux ESXi)_**\n\n### BlackCat cross-platform functionality\n\nBlackCat started offering their services in December 2021 on the dark web. Although the\nmalware is written in Rust from scratch, we found some links to the BlackMatter group as the\nactor used the same custom exfiltration tool that had been observed earlier in BlackMatter\nactivities. Due to Rust cross-compilation capabilities, it did not take long time for us to find\nBlackCat samples that work on Linux as well.\n\nThe Linux sample of BlackCat is very similar to the Windows one. In terms of functionality, it\nhas slightly more, as it is capable of shutting down the machine and deleting ESXi VMs.\nNaturally, typical Windows functionality (e.g., executing commands through cmd.exe) was\nremoved and replaced with the Linux equivalent so the ransomware still holds the same\nfunctionality on the different platforms it operates on.\n\n### Deadbolt cross-platform functionality\n\nDeadbolt is an example of ransomware written in a cross-platform language, but currently\naimed at only one target – QNAP NAS systems. It is also an interesting combination of\nBash, HTML and Golang. Deadbolt itself is written in Golang, the ransom note is an HTML\nfile that replaces the standard index file used by the QNAP NAS, and the Bash script is used\nto start the decryption process if the provided decryption key is correct. There is another\npeculiar thing about the ransomware: it doesn’t need any interaction with attackers because\na decryption key is provided in a Bitcoin transaction OP_RETURN field. The Bash file is\nshown below.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho \"Content-Type: text/html\"\n\necho \"\"\n\nget_value () {\n\necho \"$1\" | awk -F \"${2}=\" '{ print $2 }' | awk -F '&' '{ print $1 }'\n\n}\n\nnot_running() { echo '{\"status\":\"not_running\"}'; exit; }\n\n\n-----\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n\nPID_FILENAME=/tmp/deadbolt.pid\n\nSTATUS_FILENAME=/tmp/deadbolt.status\n\nFINISH_FILENAME=/tmp/deadbolt.finish\n\nTOOL=/mnt/HDA_ROOT/722\n\nCRYPTDIR=/share\n\nif [ \"$REQUEST_METHOD\" = \"POST\" ]; then\n\nDATA=`dd count=$CONTENT_LENGTH bs=1 2> /dev/null`'&'\n\nACTION=$(get_value \"$DATA\" \"action\")\n\nif [ \"$ACTION\" = \"decrypt\" ]; then\n\nKEY=$(get_value \"$DATA\" \"key\")\n\nif [ \"${#KEY}\" != 32 ]; then\n\necho \"invalid key len\"\n\nexit\n\nfi\n\nK=/tmp/k-$RANDOM\n\necho -n > $K\n\nfor i in `seq 0 2 30`; do\n\nprintf \"\\x\"${KEY:$i:2} >> $K\n\ndone\n\nSUM=$(sha256sum $K | awk '{ print $1 }')\n\nrm $K\n\nif [ \"$SUM\" =\n\"915767a56cb58349b1e34c765b82be6b117db7e784c3efb801f327ff00355d15\" ]; then\n\necho \"correct key\"\n\nexec >&\nexec 2>&\n\n-----\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\n56\n\n57\n\n58\n\n59\n\n60\n\n61\n\n62\n\n63\n\n\n${TOOL} d $KEY $CRYPTDIR\n\nelif [ \"$SUM\" =\n\"93f21756aeeb5a9547cc62dea8d58581b0da4f23286f14d10559e6f89b078052\" ];\nthen\n\necho \"correct master key\"\n\nexec >&\nexec 2>&\n${TOOL} -d \"$KEY\" \"$CRYPTDIR\"\n\nelse\n\necho \"wrong key.\"\n\nfi\n\nelif [ \"$ACTION\" = \"status\" ]; then\n\nif [ -f \"$FINISH_FILENAME\" ]; then\n\necho '{\"status\":\"finished\"}'\n\nexit\n\nfi\n\nif [ -f \"$PID_FILENAME\" ]; then\n\nPID=$(cat \"$PID_FILENAME\")\n\nif [ \"$PID\" = \"\" ]; then\n\nnot_running\n\nfi\n\nif [ ! -d \"/proc/$PID\" ]; then\n\nnot_running\n\nfi\n\nfi\n\nif [ -f \"$STATUS_FILENAME\" ]; then\n\nCOUNT=$(cat \"$STATUS_FILENAME\")\n\necho '{\"status\":\"running\",\"count\":\"'${COUNT}'\"}'\n\nelse\n\n\n-----\n\n64\n\n65\n\n66\n\n67\n\n68\n\n69\n\n70\n\n71\n\n72\n\n73\n\n\nnot_running\n\nfi\n\nelse\n\necho \"invalid action\"\n\nfi\n\nelse\n\necho\n\n\n## Trend #2: The ransomware ecosystem is evolving and becoming even more “industrialized”\n\nJust like legitimate software companies, cybercriminal groups are continually developing\ntheir tool kit for themselves and their customers – for example, to make the process of data\nexfiltration quicker and easier. Another trick that threat actors sometimes pull off is\nrebranding their ransomware, changing bits and pieces in the process. Let’s delve into the\nnew tools and “business” strategies ransomware gangs are employing these days.\n\n### Evolution of Lockbit, one of the most successful RaaS since 2019\n\nLockbit started in 2019, and then in 2020, its affiliate program was announced. Over time,\nthe group has been developing actively, as can be seen in the figure below:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the group started with its malicious activities, it did not have any leak portal, was not\ndoing double extortion, and there was no data exfiltration before data encryption.\n\nThe infrastructure was also improved over time. Like other ransomware families, Lockbit’s\ninfrastructure suffered several attacks that forced the group to implement some\ncountermeasures to protect its assets. These attacks included hacking of the Lockbit’s\nadministration panels and DDOS-attacks to force the group to shut down its activity.\n\nThe latest security addition made by the Lockbit developers is a “waiting page” that redirects\nusers to one of the available mirrors.\n\n### StealBIT: custom data exfiltration tool utilized by Lockbit ransomware\n\nData exfiltration, which is used when groups apply double extortion, is possible in many\ndifferent ways. Initially cybercriminals used publicly available tools such as Filezilla, and then\nlater replaced them with their own custom tools such as StealBIT. There are a few reasons\nfor this:\n\nPublicly available tools are not always known for their speed. For ransomware\noperators speed is important, because the longer it takes to exfiltrate data, the greater\nthe chance that ransomware operators will be caught,\n\n\n-----\n\nFlexibility is another reason. Standard tools are not designed with the requirements for\nransomware operators in mind. For example, with most tools it is possible to upload the\ndata only to one host. If that host is down, another host must be specified manually.\nThere is always the chance that criminal infrastructure will be taken down or fall into the\nhands of LEAs. To provide more flexibility and overcome these limitations, StealBIT has\na list of hardcoded hosts the data can be exfiltrated to. If the first one is down for some\nreason, the second host is tried.\nRansomware operators have requirements that are not met with publicly available\ntools. One such requirement is to exfiltrate not all the data, but only the interesting\ndata. In StealBIT this is implemented by having a hardcoded list of extensions that\nshould be extracted. Another functionality is that the affiliate ID is sent when data is\nuploaded.\n\nIn the figure below, the data exfiltration is compared (by the authors) to that of other tools:\n\n### SoftShade deploys Fendr exfiltration client\n\nFendr, also known as Exmatter, is a malicious data exfiltration tool used by several\nransomware groups such as BlackMatter, Conti and BlackCat. Fendr was not seen in all the\nBlackMatter and Conti incidents we observed, but we did see them in all BlackCat-related\nincidents. Therefore, we believe that Fendr was used by a crimeware group that participated\nin a few affiliate schemes.\n\nInternally, SoftShade developers called it “file_sender” and “sender2”. The malware is written\nin C# .Net, and was frequently deployed alongside BlackMatter and Conti malware as a\npacked .Net executable, but most samples deployed alongside Conti and BlackCat\nransomware were not packed (except for one Conti incident in November 2021). It is\n\n\n-----\n\ndesigned to efficiently manage large amounts of selective file collection and upload activity\non a victim system and then remove itself from the system. Fendr is built with several opensource libraries, and its design is clearly the result of maturing, professionalised experience\nin the ransomware space, handling arbitrary large file volumes across various Windows\nsystems and networks.\n\nAlso interesting is the deployment and packaging of Fendr and their chosen ransomware.\nAcross each affiliate scheme (except for one Conti incident), the ransomware and Fendr are\ndelivered simultaneously across a network to many systems as “v2.exe” and “v2c.exe”, or as\n“v2.exe” and “sender2.exe”. This simultaneous push seems to prioritize coordination and\nefficiency over raising risk of detection. In a Conti-related exception, it appears that a Fendr\nvariant was pushed across the network to many systems as\n“\\\\hostname\\$temp\\sender2.exe”.\n\n## Trend #3 Ransomware gangs take sides in geopolitical conflicts\n\nCybercriminals use news headlines to achieve their malicious goals. We saw this during the\ninitial phase of the global Covid-19 pandemic, when there was a surge of Covid-19-related\nspam and phishing e-mails. The same happened with the geopolitical conflict in Ukraine in\n2022.\n\nThere is, however, one big difference. The usage of the pandemic wasn’t personal because it\nwas just another topic from a long list of holidays, events, incidents, etc. In the case of the\nconflict, threat actors decided to choose sides, and this makes the topic much more\npersonal.\n\nTypically in a geopolitical conflict such as this one, one would associate the source of the\ncyberattacks with state-sponsored threat actors. This is not always true, as we have noted a\nnew type of engagement in this conflict: cybercrime forums and ransomware groups reacting\nto the situation and taking action.\n\n[There have been consequences: for example, the disclosure of the Conti-related information.](https://therecord.media/conti-ransomware-gang-chats-leaked-by-pro-ukraine-member/)\nWe also see this in malware variants that have been recently deployed. Specific variants that\nare exclusively found in Ukraine or in Russia often choose sides, either against Ukraine or\nagainst Russia. Let’s look at the most notable ransomware gang activity around the conflict.\n\n### Ransomware gangs taking sides\n\nThe most significant reaction of all is likely the Conti ransomware group. On February 25,\nConti published a message on its news site with a statement that it would retaliate with full\ncapabilities against any “enemy’s” critical infrastructure if Russia became a target of\ncyberattacks. This is probably a rare example of a cybercriminal group supporting a nationstate publicly. As a result, an allegedly Ukrainian member shared chats and other internal\nConti-related information online.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Conti ransomware group posting a warning message on its news site_**\n\nOn the other side there are other communities such as Anonymous, IT Army of Ukraine and\nBelarusian Cyber Partisans openly supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe table below highlights the position of several groups and forums during the beginning of\nthe conflict.\n\n**Open UA support** **Open RU support** **Neutral**\n\nRaidForums Conti Lockbit\n\nAnonymous collective CoomingProject\n\nIT Army of Ukraine Stormous\n\nBelarusian Cyber Partisans\n\n### Freeud: brand-new ransomware with wiper capabilities\n\nKaspersky recently discovered Freeud, a brand-new ransomware variant that supports\nUkraine. The Freeud’s ransom note says — not very subtly — that Russian troops should\nleave Ukraine. The choice of words and how the note is written suggest that it is written by a\nnative Russian speaker. Other language artifacts that we found suggest the authors are nonnative English speakers. For example, the word “lending” was found several times in places\nwhere the writers should have used “landing”.\n\nThe political view of the malware authors is expressed not only through the ransom note but\nalso through the malware features. One of them is wiping functionality. If the malware\ncontains a list of files, instead of encrypting, the malware wipes them from the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother property that stands out is the high quality of the malware, highlighted by the\nencryption methods applied and the way multithreading is used.\n\n### Elections GoRansom (HermeticRansom) covering up destructive activity\n\nGoRansom was found at the end of February in Ukraine at the same time the HermeticWiper\n[attack was carried out. We covered in a post published in March. There are a few things that](https://securelist.com/elections-goransom-and-hermeticwiper-attack/105960/)\nGoRansom does that are different from other ransomware variants:\n\nIt creates hundreds of copies of itself and runs them.\nThe function naming scheme refers to the US presidential elections.\nThere is no obfuscation and it has pretty straightforward functionality.\n\n**_Self-copies made by HermeticRansom_**\n\nFor these reasons we believe it was created to boost the effectiveness of cyberoperations in\nUkraine.\n\n### Stormous ransomware joins the Ukraine crisis with a PHP malware\n\nIt is not very often that we come across malware written in PHP. Most of the time when we\nanalyze PHP code it is either a web shell or some botnet panel code. Stormous is one of the\nfew exceptions. Aside from being a backdoor, it also contains ransomware functionality. The\nthreat actor hunts for web servers supporting PHP technology and weaknesses that are\nvulnerable to web apps.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn analysis of the malware suggests the threat actor is Arabic speaking from a North African\nregion. Stormous sides with Russia:\n\nThe PHP script provides a web interface for remote interaction over HTTP, where several\nencryption options are offered: “OpenSSL”, “Mcrypt” and “Xor”. It is quite possible that these\nthree were developed into the script because of external considerations at the target, like the\nversion of PHP running on the server (some extensions are deprecated or unavailable from\none version to the next).\n\n### DoubleZero wiper targets Ukraine\n\nThe DoubleZero wiper was initially published by the Ukrainian CERT on the March 22. It is a\ncompletely new wiper written in C#; it is not similar to any other known wipers and targets\nonly Ukrainian entities. The binary itself is heavily obfuscated by an unknown C# obfuscator.\nClasses and method names are randomly generated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Obfuscation_**\n\nControl flow is organized using a function-flattening mechanism created to slow down\nanalysis of malicious code.\n\n**_Obfuscated decompiled code_**\n\nWhen all the preparations are over, malware starts its wiping operations. First, it checks for\nuser (nonsystem files) by comparing folder names with a hardcoded list and starts wiping\nthem using quite an interesting implementation of NtFsControlFile API.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Hardcoded list of folders_**\n\n**_File wiping_**\n\nThe NtFsControlFile routine sends a control code directly to a specified file system or file\nsystem filter driver, causing the corresponding driver to perform the specified action. As seen\nin the screenshot, the control code has the value of 622792 (0x980C8in hex), which\ncorresponds to the FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA control code of the FCSTL structure. Data in\nthe file will be overwritten by ZERO values that are pointed by intPtr2 variable. If the function\nfails, the wiper will execute the standard .Net FileStream.Write function for the same\npurpose. Then malware wipes the system files found.\n\nMalware then deletes the Windows registry tree subkeys in HKU, HKLM and kills the “lsass”\nprocess to reboot the infected machine.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs the saying goes, forewarned is forearmed, and this also applies to cybersecurity. In recent\nyears, ransomware groups have come a long way from being scattered gangs to businesses\nwith distinctive traits of full-fledged industry. As a result, attacks have become more\nsophisticated and more targeted, exposing victims to more threats. Monitoring the activity of\nransomware groups and their developments provides us with threat intelligence that enables\nbetter defences.\n\nWe witnessed cross-platform ransomware written in Rust and Golang becoming a weapon of\nthe “new-generation” of ransomware groups. Thanks to the software’s flexibility, the attacks\ncan be conducted on a larger scale with no regard to what operating system the victim is\n\n\n-----\n\nusing. This flexibility allows ransomware gangs to quickly adapt their strategy when carrying\nout attacks, diversify their targets and affect more victims.\n\nSecond, we witnessed a significant development in how ransomware groups rebuild their\ninner processes to facilitate their activity increasingly resembling legitimate software\ndevelopers. While their efforts in branding (and re-branding) aren’t entirely new, the\nsegmentation of their ‘businesses’ as well creation of new exfiltration tools point towards\nmaturing Ransomware-as-a-Service industry, where the ransomware owner simplifies the job\nfor the operators as much as possible.\n\nFinally, ransomware group’s engagement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have\nset a precedent in the way cybercriminals operate in relation to geopolitics. While it is widely\nseen that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors are usually the ones to take on the\nmission of carrying out advanced attacks in the interest of the state, we now see that\nransomware actors voluntarily engage in such activities as well, often leading to quite\ndestructive consequences.\n\nThese tendencies are already affecting the way we need to defend against ransomware\ntoday. Ahead of the Anti-Ransomware Day, Kaspersky encourages organization to follow\nthese best practices that help them safeguard against ransomware:\n\nAlways keep software updated on all the devices you use, to prevent attackers from\ninfiltrating your network by exploiting vulnerabilities.\nFocus your defence strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to the\ninternet. Pay special attention to the outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals’\nconnections. Set up offline backups that intruders cannot tamper with. Make sure you\ncan quickly access them in an emergency when needed.\nEnable ransomware protection for all endpoints. There is a free Kaspersky AntiRansomware Tool for Business that shields computers and servers from ransomware\nand other types of malware, prevent exploits and is compatible with already installed\nsecurity solutions.\nInstall anti-APT and EDR solutions, enabling capabilities for advanced threat discovery\nand detection, investigation and timely remediation of incidents.
