We have recently encountered a new and improved version of this malware,\nwhich allows its operator to upload and execute new payloads to infected devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample we analyzed came bundled with YTD Video Downloader & Video Converter,\nwhich is a popular software for downloading music and videos from the web. This installation\norchestrates the whole infection process by dropping an encrypted PowerShell script that will\nbe decrypted and executed by a hidden PowerShell process. Once decrypted, the script is\n[responsible for setting up persistence, using the algorithm described here.](https://www.binarydefense.com/mars-deimos-from-jupiter-to-mars-and-back-again-part-two/)\n\nOur variant connects to its C&C server and sends back the computer information (in an\nencrypted form). It does not include the credentials stealing functionality hardcoded\nanymore, instead, it gets all functional modules from the C&C server. One of the malware's\ncapabilities, is to upload and execute .exe and .ps1 files to the victim’s machine. This leaves\nan attacker with the ability not only to execute different types of attacks, but also to steal any\ninformation from the victim’s computer.\n\n[Minerva Labs prevents Jupyter malware with our Living-off-the-Land Prevention technology,](https://minerva-labs.com/ransomware-protection-2021)\nwhich interferes with attempts to misuse tools built into the system with the intention of\ncausing damage. This module prevents threats from “trampolining” off such tools to infect the\nendpoint or cause damage.\n\n**IOC’s:**\n\n**Hash:**\n\nC5C5B2D3F6E37851DEE79B1B2B19AA7D\n\n**DNS:**\n\n[http://185.244.213[.]64](http://10.10.0.46/about:blank)\n\n[http://37.120.247[.]125](http://10.10.0.46/about:blank)\n\n[« Previous Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/supply-chain-attack-we-can-stop-it?hsLang=en-us)\n[Next Post »](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/become-a-vip-victim-with-new-discord-distributed-malware?hsLang=en-us)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Interested in Minerva?
