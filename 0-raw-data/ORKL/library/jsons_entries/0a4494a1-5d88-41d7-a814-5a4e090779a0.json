Upon further investigation, we determined the file is a Conti variant compiled\nfor the Linux operating system targeting ESXi servers. Although, the ESXi version of Conti\nis not new and has been already discussed, this is the first public sample we have seen in\nthe wild.\n\nIn this blog we investigated the 2021 Conti leaked playbook and the 2022 leaked Conti chat\nmessages with an attempt to understand when Conti began developing a Linux variant of\ntheir locker targeting ESXi servers as well as who their potential victims were. We also\nprovide a technical analysis of the recently detected Linux variant of Conti ransomware,\nexplaining its operation and capabilities.\n\n### ESXi Linux variant in Conti leaks & playbook\n\nThe first mention of a Conti locker for Linux dates to the beginning of May 2021. In the\nbelow conversation, the actors’ monikers are marked in bold. Reshaev reports to Stern, he\nsuccessfully tested the locker and the decryptor against several million files and he is\ncurrently applying the final touches to it. “What is left is that I need to check it on one OS,\n_ESXi, and that should be it” said Reshaev, adding that Tramp is already interested to start_\nworking with the Linux variant of the ransomware:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Reshaev to Stern on development of Conti Linux variant\n\nLater in mid-June 2021, Reshaev advised Pin the Linux build of the locker is not ready yet\nand preferably they should test it on a real case but not a large company. Pin replied to him\na large casino hack is almost finalized and suggested giving Reshaev’s Linux locker a try:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Pin to Reshaev suggesting trying the Linux variant for the 1st time on a casino\ncase\n\nMoreover, Reshaev said the Linux locker does not launch on ESXi hypervisors with the\nversion lower than 6.7 and for older ESXi versions, they need to re-build the locker with old\nlibraries. This message in the Conti leaks of March 2022 is in line with the Conti playbook\nleak of August 2021 where one of the manuals highlighted in cyan that the Linux variant of\nthe locker might not launch on certain OS versions:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Parameters of launching Conti Linux locker\n\nIt appears that Conti Linux version had a bug around November 2021. “Throw away the\n_builder I gave you for boby, it [expletive] does not work properly” advised Reshaev to_\n**Paranoik. When an error was discovered, Cybergangster said he will fix it by the next day**\nand ordered an ESXi version 5.5 to test and adjust the locker for it. It seems that a fix was\nstill required for the Conti Linux variant up until the beginning of February 2022 and Conti\ngang kept adjusting it for various ESXi versions including the latest version 7.0 and higher:\n\nFigure 4. Reshaev on Linux variant not working properly\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Cybergangster found a bug in the Linux variant of Conti\n\nCybergangster asking to order ESXi v7 and higher\n\n\nFigure\n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the 22nd of November 2021 Cybergangster asked Bio to help to translate the Conti\nLinux variant decryptor instructions which look as follow:\n\nFigure\n\n7. Cybergangster asking Bio to help to translate decryptor instructions\n\nConti Linux variant decryptor had some issues too. In July-August 2021, Pin reported to\n**Reshaev the provided decryptor did not remove the ransomware extension from the**\nvictim’s files. Reshaev first advised the decryptor unlocked the files and the victim just\nneeds to manually change the extension of the files, however due to a large volume of files\nto process, Pin asked him to rebuild the decryptor so that it automatically removes the\nextension from the decrypted files:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Pin asking Reshaev to rebuild the Conti Linux decryptor\n\nThe Linux decryptor still had problems in December 2021 where either the victims who paid\nthe ransom were complaining it did not work properly or Conti members themselves could\nnot decrypt the files received from the victims.\n\nAlthough the Linux variant’s first use on a potential victim (a large casino) dated as early as\nJuly 2021, we observed the ESXi variant becoming actively used only as of November\n2021. By examining the Conti leaks we have identified some of the potential victims of Conti\nLinux variant across various industries including business, law, automobile, logistics, retail\nand financial services. Below is an excerpt from a hack case with the Linux variant, where\ninitially Conti set a ransom at $20 million but settled at $1 million, mainly because\nsomething went wrong with the Linux variant lock and instead of 800 ESXi servers they\nmanaged to encrypt only 260 servers. Furthermore, it seems that the victim did not want\nConti’s decryptor and Conti suspected they somehow managed to recover and restore their\nsystems:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Tramp and Pumba’ discussion around a hack with the Linux variant\n\nThe latest potential victim of Conti Linux locker we have identified dates as late as 26th of\nJanuary 2022. This proves that despite the recent Conti/Trickbot leaks havoc, the gang\ncontinues to operate uninterruptedly and attack primarily Western organizations for their\nfinancial benefits.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nThe sample object of this analysis is an ELF compiled for the x64 processor architecture\nwith the symbols not stripped. Also, the sample has no obfuscation and it’s statically\ncompiled with the OpenSSL library version 1.0.1e for the cryptographic operations of the\nransomware.\n\nThe analyzed file can be identified by the following hashes:\n\n**File Name** encryptor.exe\n\n**MD5** cfb6d21ffe7c4279f761f2351c0810ee\n\n**SHA-1** ee827023780964574f28c6ba333d800b73eae5c4\n\n**SHA-256** 95776f31cbcac08eb3f3e9235d07513a6d7a6bf9f1b7f3d400b2cf0afdb088a7\n\n### Command line arguments\n\nOn execution, the malware will first parse the command line arguments passed to it. The\nfirst parameter the malware will parse is the “--path” which is the path that the locker will\nencrypt and it must be specified or the ransomware will finish its execution.\n\nFigure 10. Path argument parsing\n\nBecause the argument “--path” is mandatory it seems that the malware was designed to be\nran directly by the operators and not independently as the Windows version of the\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second argument is --file which is parsed by the malware but not used in the code.\nThe third argument is “--size” which is the partial size of the file that will be encrypted if the\nfile is bigger than 5MB. It can only be 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 50.\n\nFigure 11. Size argument parsing\n\nThe third argument is “--detach”, which will make the malware run as a child process using\nthe syscall fork from Linux and to disconnect the process from the terminal and continue\nencrypting even if the ssh session is discontinued/interrupted. The fourth is “--log” which will\nreceive a file as input, and it will write all the actions and error messages from the malware\nto that particular file.\n\nThe fifth argument is “--prockiller” if set the malware will finish the execution of processes\nthat have handles open to the file is being encrypted in order to liberate it. This functionality\nis explained on the Termination of processes section and in this build is disabled.\n\nThe sixth argument is “--vmlist” which receives a file with a list of names of virtual machines\nthe malware will exclude and not finish its execution. The seventh argument is “--vmkiller”\nwhich is responsible for calling the function “KillVIrtualMachines” and is discussed in the\nnext section.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Conti arguments parsing\n\n### Killing virtual machines\n\nIf the “--vmkiller\" argument is passed to the command line, the malware will create a child\nprocess using the fork syscall and make the parent process wait till the execution of the\nchild process finishes. The newly created process will create a file named “vm-list.txt”,\nredirect the stdout file descriptor to the file and finally execute the command “esxcli vm\nprocess list” via the execlp function.\n\nFigure 13.\n\nListing virtual machines in the server\n\n\n-----\n\nThe aforementioned command is used to list the virtual machines on the ESXi server and to\nobtain the necessary information to stop their execution. Next, the malware will read the file\n“vm-list.txt” created before and parse the world id and the display name. Before killing the\nmachine, it will check if the name of the machine is in the exclusion list which the actors\nnamed “g_vm_list” and it was passed via the command line.\n\nFigure 14.\n\nCheck if virtual machine must be skipped\nIf the name of the machine is not found on the exclusion list, the malware will fork the\ncurrent process and issue the command “esxcli vm process kill --type=hard --world-id=\n{WORLD_ID}” to force its shutdown.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Stop running virtual machines\nUsing this technique, the malware intends to release the files that these virtual machines\nmay use so when the encryption is performed there are no access errors.\n\n### Termination of processes\n\nThe ransomware has the ability to terminate the processes running on the server, but in the\nESXi builds it seems this functionality is disabled due to the fact that the function the\ndevelopers named “KillProcess” is never called.\n\nFirst, the malware will enumerate all the directories inside the directory “/proc” which\ncontains information about processes and other system files. If the name of the directory is\na number, which indicates is a directory that contains information about a running process,\nit will enumerate the file descriptors opened by that process in the CheckPid function and if\none of the file descriptors matches the name passed to the function it will send a kill syscall\nto the process to liberate the opened file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16.\n\nTermination of processes\nThis functionality could be used by the malware if it can’t encrypt a file because it is open by\nother processes to kill those processes and make the file available to the ransomware.\n\n### Enumeration of files\n\nAfter, finishing execution of the virtual machines the malware will start enumerating the\ndirectory specified with the “--path” argument. First, the malware will create the ransom note\non that directory with the name “readme.txt”. We will discuss its contents in the Ransom\nnote section.\n\nFigure 17. Dropping ransom note\n\n\n-----\n\nTo traverse the directory, the malware will call the function readdir which returns a pointer\nto a dirent structure with the information of the directory. Conti will skip the directories ‘.’ and\n‘..’ which corresponds to the drive current and parent directory. If the type of the entry of the\ndirent structure is “DT_DIR” which means it is a directory, it will recursively call the\n“SearchFiles” function to enumerate the files in the directory.\n\nFigure 18. Recursive file\n\nenumeration\nIf the entry in the dirent structure is “DT_REG” which means it is a regular file, the malware\nwill check if the filename contains “.conti” or is equal to “readme.txt” or contains “.sf”. If\nthat’s the case, it won’t encrypt the file.\n\nFigure 19. Excluded files\n\nThe “.conti” extension it is checked to not double encrypt files, the readme.txt filename is\nverified to not encrypt the ransom note file and the “.sf” extension is checked to not encrypt\nfiles related to the VMFS filesystem volumes used by VMware ESXi.\n\nBased on the size of the file, the malware will encrypt it partially or fully and will rename the\nfile with the “.conti” extension to mark the file as encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Encryption routine\n\n### Encryption scheme\n\nConti uses the traditional hybrid encryption scheme combining a public-key and a\nsymmetric-key. The malware has embedded the OpenSSL library and a public Salsa20\nalgorithm implementation in the binary.\n\nFirst, the malicious file will load the RSA public key contained in the binary using the\nOpenSSL function PEM_read_bio_RSAPublicKey and the size of the modulus of the key is\n4096 bytes.\n\nFigure 21. Public key\n\ninitialization\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware uses Salsa20 as a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the files on the system by\ngenerating a random key and initialization vector using the “RAND_bytes” function of\nOpenSSL. For every file the malware is going to encrypt it will generate a new key and\ninitialization vector.\n\nFigure 22. Generation of\n\nSalsa20 key and the initialization vector\nConti will create a 50 bytes structure where it will store in the first value the Salsa20 key, on\nthe second member will store the initialization vector, the third one will be the encryption\nsize of the partial encrypt of the file (i.e. encryption_size is 100 for full encrypt) and the las\none is a byte indicating the type of encryption of the file (i.e. 16 for full encryption and 17 for\npartial encryption).\n\nLastly, it will encrypt the aforementioned structure and write it at the end of the file as\nnecessary information for the decryptor to decrypt the files.\n\nFigure 23. Encryption of key_info structure\n\n## Ransom note\n\nWhen a computer is infected by Conti, a ransom note with the name “readme.txt” is created\nin the path that was parsed from the command line. The ransom note is embedded inside\nthe binary and it’s not encrypted in any form. An example is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Conti ESXi ransom note\n\nAs most ransomware strains nowadays, Conti embeds a TOR support panel in the ransom\nnote where the victim can contact the criminals to get the decryptor after the payment.\n\n### Logging\n\nConti has the ability to generate a log file if specified in the command line, which will log all\nthe messages that the malware creates. Conti will generate debug messages to show\nwhich file is encrypting and also write error messages if there are any.\n\nFigure 25. Example of log file\n\nBesides the log file, Conti also creates a file in the current directory named “result.txt” where\nit writes the size of encrypted files and the number of files it has encrypted.\n\nFigure 26. Example of results.txt file\n\n\n-----\n\n## Demo\n\n[In the following link you can see a video of the encryption process of a ESXi server. First,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6qKmbCOveU)\nthe malware will stop the running virtual machine named Ubuntu VM and then encrypt all\nthe files inside the path “/vmfs/volumes”. The result.txt file will contain the total encrypted\nsize and the number of files encrypted and the conti_log.log file will contain the log\nmessages of the malware.\n\nFigure 27. Demo execution of the ransomware\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this report we have presented a technical overview of a recent Conti Linux sample\ntargeting VMware ESXi servers and the functionalities included in the malware to increase\nthe damage to the organizations it attacks.\n\nAnalysis of Conti leaks revealed that the threat actors are continuously adjusting and\nimproving their Linux variant of ransomware and it is likely in the future we will see more of\nits actions against Western organizations.\n\nTargeting ESXi Hypervisors and its virtual machines is of special interest for criminals\nbecause the impact on the organizations they attack is huge. Nowadays it is a common\ntheme in the ransomware landscape to develop new binaries specifically to encrypt virtual\nmachines and their management environments.\n\nSince the sample of the Conti ransomware we analyzed was recently uploaded to VT, we\npresume that the ransomware group is still performing their campaigns and operations\nencrypting data from companies all around the world and extorting them for a ransom\n\n\n-----\n\npayment for their own personal gain.\n\n## Appendix A - MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nT1489 Impact Service Stop Conti has the ability to kill ESXi virtual\nmachines and stop processes\n\n\nT1486 Impact Data Encrypted for\nImpact\n\nT1082 Discovery System Information\nDiscovery\n\nT1083 Discovery File and Directory\nDiscovery\n\nT1059.004 Execution Command and\nScripting Interpreter:\nUnix Shell\n\n\nConti encrypts the files found on a\nspecific path\n\nConti launches commands to discover\nthe running machines on the ESXi\nserver\n\nConti enumerates the files and\ndirectories on a specific path\n\nConti abuses Unix shell commands\nand scripts\n\n\nT1106 Execution Native API Conti uses the fork() native API\n\n## Appendix B - YARA rule\n\nrule RANSOM_Conti_Linux_Apr2022 : ransomware\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects Conti Linux variant\"\n\nauthor = \"Marc Elias | Trellix ATR Team\"\n\ndate = \"2022-04-06\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$str1 = \".conti\" ascii fullword\n\n$str2 = \"All of your files are currently encrypted by CONTI strain\" ascii fullword\n\n$str3 = \"http://contirec\" ascii\n\n\n-----\n\ncondition:\n\nuint32(0) == 0x464c457f and\n\nfilesize < 2MB and\n\nall of them\n}\n\n\n-----",
