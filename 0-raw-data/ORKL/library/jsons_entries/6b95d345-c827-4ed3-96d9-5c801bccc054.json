The ransomware, called\nProLock, is a successor to PwndLocker, a ransomware strain that emerged late in 2019.\n\nPwndLocker’s distribution was short-lived, primarily because it was discovered that the keys\n[needed to decrypt files could be recovered from the malware itself without paying a ransom.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pwndlocker-ransomware-gets-pwned-decryption-now-available/)\nThe retooled ProLock ransomware, which emerged in March, resulted in the opposite\n[problem: in May, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an alert warning that victims](https://iacc.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/COVID19/FBI%20-%20FLASH%20TLP%20Green%20-%20Indicators%20of%20Compromise%20Associated%20with%20ProLock....pdf)\nwho had paid the ransom demanded by ProLock’s operators had received a faulty decryptor\nthat corrupted files it “decrypted.”\n\nThe faulty debugging may be connected to the unusual way in which ProLock encrypts files:\nit skips files smaller than 8,192 bytes, and starts encrypting larger files after the first 8,192\nbytes. The result is files that are partially readable, and partially encrypted.\n\nSophos initially encountered ProLock when it was caught by Intercept X’s CryptoGuard\ncomponent on a customer network in mid-March. The malware uses a Powershell-based\ndropper that extracts Windows executable code from an accompanying graphics file—or at\nleast, a file with a graphics format extension. And all of its malicious activities are concealed\nwithin legitimate Windows processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the FBI flash, victims of ProLock have included healthcare organizations,\ngovernment agencies, financial institutions, and retailers. Victims are directed to contact the\nProLock operators through a Tor-based ( .onion) web portal or a ProtonMail email address.\nFollowing the current trend in ransomware set by Maze, ReVil, and other established\nextortion operations, the ProLock actors “instruct victims to pay the ransom in several days,\nthreatening to release the victims’ data on social media and public websites,” the FBI reports.\n\n### Picking the locks\n\nProLock has gained access to victims’ networks in several ways, with some leveraging third[party exploitation. In May, Oleg Skulkin, Senior Digital Forensics Analyst at Group-IB, told](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/prolock)\n[BleepingComputer that evidence he had uncovered showed some ProLock victims were](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/prolock-ransomware-teams-up-with-qakbot-trojan-for-network-access/)\ninfected through scripts executed by the QakBot banking trojan.\n\nThe FBI also cited Qakbot as one of ProLock’s means of initial access, as well as phishing\n[emails and improperly configured Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers, and remote](https://sophos.com/rdp)\naccess connections over RDP with stolen user credentials. The earliest detection of ProLock\nby Sophos was on a customer’s compromised server, most likely through an exploit of a\nRemote Desktop Protocol connection.\n\nThe ProLock actors use their access to conduct some network reconnaissance, as well as to\npotentially steal data before launching their ransomware attack. They then use the stolen or\ncompromised credentials, built-in Windows tools and scripts to propagate the ransomware\nacross the network.\n\nWhen the time came to release the ransomware, we found in the case we analyzed that four\nfiles were dropped onto targeted systems, downloaded from a remote server (IP addresses\nare in the Indicators of Compromise file posted to SophosLabs’ GitHub).\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\WinMgr.bmp\nC:\\ProgramData\\WinMgr.xml\nC:\\ProgramData\\clean.bat\nC:\\ProgramData\\run.bat\n\n### Chain of destruction\n\n```\nProLock malware depends on Windows batch scripts, the Windows Task Scheduler (through\nthe [schtasks.exe command line utility) and PowerShell to launch its attack.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/schtasks)\n\nThe ransomware chain is set off with the execution of run.bat, which creates a scheduled\nWindows task to execute clean.bat using the contents of WinMgr.xml to configure the task.\nWhen it is launched by the scheduler, clean.bat executes a base64-encoded PowerShell\nscript that extracts the ProLock executable file encoded into the image file WinMgr.bmp,\nloads it into memory, and executes it—passing parameters that control the encryption.\n(When executed without the Powershell script, the executable runs—but doesn’t encrypt any\nfiles )\n\n\n-----\n\nportion of the base64-encoded script embedded into “clean.bat.”\n\nportion of the decoded script that invokes the code from the file WinMgr.bmp\n\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\n-----\n\nA\n\nscreenshot of WinMgr.bmp, the “graphics file” that carries the barely-concealed ProLock\nmalware payload. (Note the “noise” of steganography in the upper right hand corner.)\n\n### The usual suspects\n\nOne of the ProLock samples we examined hides some of its contents with a self-modifying\nsection of code, which conceals text strings and other elements from analysis. As is common\nin malware development, the ProLock program is deliberately set not to allow debugging, to\nmake it more difficult for researchers to run it in a controlled fashion.\n\n\n-----\n\nProLock descrambles a section of obfuscated code upon execution.\n\nA\n\nbefore-and-after look at the ProLock binary’s self-modifying code.\nThe malware decodes the self-modifying section, imports DLLs and sets up the functions it\nwill use. Then it launches a new thread and puts the first thread to sleep—an anti-analysis\ntrick.\n\nThe malware traverses the registry looking for security policy settings that might cause\ntrouble. For some reason, it switches some of Internet Explorer’s security policy settings,\nturning off the mapping of Universal Naming Convention paths to IE’s “Intranet” zone and\nturning on automatic intranet mapping. (The list of registry changes is included in the\n[indicators of compromise file on SophosLabs’ Github here.) Then it starts hunting for](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Ransomware-ProLock.csv)\napplications and services that might get in the way of total data destruction.\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing a function call to Windows [CreateToolhelp32snapshot.dll, the malware takes a](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/nf-tlhelp32-createtoolhelp32snapshot)\nsnapshot of all running processes, and begins checking them against a list (which can be\n[found here on SophosLabs’ GitHub), shutting down the ones that match the list with](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/prolock_processes_stopped.csv)\nWindows’ taskkill.exe utility (through a ShellExecuteA function call). The processes include\ncommon desktop applications (including Microsoft Office applications), databases, the\nFirefox browser and Thunderbird mail client, and a number of security software components.\nThese sorts of processes are stopped by ransomware in order to make sure no user files are\nlocked open—allowing the malware to encrypt them without resistance.\n\nThen, using net.exe, the ransomware code attempts to shut down a list of more than 150\nservices associated with enterprise applications, security software, and backups. A full list of\nthe processes and services targeted by the ransomware is posted on SophosLabs’ GitHub\n[here(services) and here (processes). Again, the goal is to prevent anything from interfering](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Ransomware_prolock_processes_stopped.csv)\nwhen the encryption begins. These service shutdown commands are issued with Windows’\nnet.exe utility.\n\nNext, to prevent local file recovery, ProLock deletes the “shadow copy” of local files by\nexecuting the following commands to vssadmin.exe (Windows’ Volume Shadow Copy\nService):\n```\ndelete shadows /all /quiet\nresize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c: /maxsize=401MB\nresize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c: /maxsize=unbounded\n\n### All of this effort is extremely noisy, and processor intensive. And then the disk-intensive part begins.\n\n Semi-random mayhem\n\n```\nWith all of the guards out of the way, the ransomware begins to check what media is\nmounted and traverses the directory structure of any local or network-mapped drives. It skips\nover executable files (including .php files for websites), and leaves applications intact. All of\nthis malicious activity is executed through the powershell.exe process.\n\nAs it reads each file, it checks the length. If the file is under 8,192 bytes (0x2000 in\nhexidecimal), it skips the file. Otherwise, it begins encrypting the file, starting after the\n8,192nd byte. After encrypting a file, the extension .prolock is appended to its file name (for\nexample, a_very_large_text_file.txt becomes a_very_large_text_file.txt.prolock.)\n\n\n-----\n\nA\n\nfile listing of a directory after ProLock, sorted by file size, shows files under 8 kb untouched.\n\nA\n\ncomparison of a file before (right) and after (left) ProLock encryption.\nAs the malware finishes the encryption of the contents of each folder, it writes a file to the\nfolder named [HOW TO RECOVER FILES].TXT. This contains the ransom note.\n\nWhen all the folders have been traversed, the ransomware sounds the system alert tone,\nand drops a ransom note on the desktop.\n\nThe ProLock ransom note. The text is hard-coded into the malware, so the site and victim\n“ID” would have to be changed at build time.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransom note itself is hard-coded into the ransomware as a text string—including the\n.onion website address and the victim’s “user ID”. In fact, across the ProLock samples we\nexamined, the ransom notes were exactly the same, including the “user ID”—despite other\ndifferences in the code. Given that these samples came from separate sources, that would\nsuggest that multiple ProLock victims were given the same “user ID,” which wouldn’t matter\nin any case because of the targeted way ProLock is deployed.\n\n### Triple indemnity\n\nAs with other targeted ransomware attacks, ProLock’s encryption of files should be\nconsidered just the final act in the attack. The attackers need to have gained administrative\ncredentials to spread the malware, which means that they’ve had largely unfettered access\nto victims’ data. While we’ve seen no direct evidence thus far of data theft, the tools used to\ngain access by ProLock’s actors give them wide access to network resources and data. And\nit’s possible that other malware (such as QakBot) has also taken root—malware that ProLock\nwould leave untouched.\n\nEven if victims pay, there’s the chance (thanks to the broken decryptor) that data will be lost\nor made more expensive to recover. Bringing in the expertise of a ransomware response\nteam may be required to recover.\n\nThere are several concrete steps that organizations can take to prevent these types of\nattacks. Protecting remote network access is key to stopping these types of targeted attacks,\nby putting RDP access behind a virtual private network and using multi-factor authentication\nfor remote access. As with all ransomware threats, maintaining offline backups and malware\nprotection for both desktops and servers also hardens defenses against attacks like ProLock.\nAnd up-to-date endpoint protection tools (such as Intercept X and CryptoGuard) can be\neffective in blunting attacks that get past other defenses, or at least minimizing the damage\ndone by an intrusion.\n\nSophos now blocks variants of ProLock as Troj/Agent-BEKP and Troj/Ransom-FVU, and\nthrough heuristic analysis by Sophos ML, as well as through CryptoGuard.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSophosLabs wishes to acknowledge the contributions of Hajnalka Kópé, Anand Aijan,\nAndrew Brandt, Rahul Dugar, and Gabor Szappanos.\n\n\n-----",
