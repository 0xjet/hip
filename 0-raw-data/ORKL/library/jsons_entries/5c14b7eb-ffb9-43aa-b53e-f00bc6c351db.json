This campaign has been active since at least March 2020, distributing\n(via dedicated Facebook profiles) two Android backdoors known as 888 RAT and SpyNote,\ndisguised as legitimate apps. These profiles appeared to be providing Android news in\nKurdish, and news for the Kurds’ supporters. Some of the profiles deliberately spread\nadditional spying apps to Facebook public groups with pro-Kurd content. Data from a\ndownload site indicates at least 1,481 downloads from URLs promoted in just a few\nFacebook posts.\n\n[The newly discovered Android 888 RAT has been used by the Kasablanka group and by](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/kasablanka-lodarat.html)\nBladeHawk. Both of them used alternative names to refer to the same Android RAT –\nLodaRAT and Gaza007 respectively.\n\n## BladeHawk Android espionage\n\n[The espionage activity reported here is directly connected to two publicly](https://telegra.ph/Discover-Malware-Android-03-26) _[disclosed cases](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/Blade-hawk-The-activities-of-targeted-the-Middle-East-and-West-Asia-are-exposed/)_\npublished in 2020. QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center named the group behind these\nattacks BladeHawk, which we have adopted. Both campaigns were distributed via\nFacebook, using malware that was built with commercial, automated tools (888 RAT and\nSpyNote), with all samples of the malware using the same C&C servers.\n\n## Distribution\n\nWe identified six Facebook profiles as part of this BladeHawk campaign, sharing these\nAndroid spying apps. We reported these profiles to Facebook and they have all been taken\ndown. Two of the profiles were aimed at tech users while the other four posed as Kurd\nsupporters. All these profiles were created in 2020 and shortly after creation they started\nposting these fake apps. These accounts, except for one, have not posted any other\ncontent besides Android RATs masquerading as legitimate apps.\n\nThese profiles are also responsible for sharing espionage apps to Facebook public groups,\nmost of which were supporters of Masoud Barzani, former President of the Kurdistan\nRegion; an example can be seen in Figure 1. Altogether, the targeted groups have over\n11,000 followers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. One of the Facebook posts_\n\nIn one case, we spotted an attempt (Figure 2) to capture Snapchat credentials via a\nphishing website (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Facebook post leading to a Snapchat phishing site_\n\n_Figure 3. Snapchat phishing website_\n\nWe identified 28 unique posts as part of this BladeHawk campaign. Each of these posts\ncontained fake app descriptions and links to download an app, and we were able to\ndownload 17 unique APKs from these links. Some of the APK web links pointed directly to\nthe malicious app, whereas others pointed to the third-party upload service top4top.io,\nwhich tracks the number of file downloads (see Figure 4). Because of that, we obtained the\ntotal number of downloads from top4top.io for those eight apps. These eight apps were\ndownloaded altogether 1,481 times, from July 20, 2020 until June 28, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Information about one RAT sample hosted on a third-party service_\n\n## Samples\n\nTo our knowledge, this campaign targeted only Android users, with the threat actors\nfocused on two commercial Android RAT tools – 888 RAT and SpyNote. We found only one\nsample of the latter during our research. As it was built using an old, already analyzed\n_[SpyNote builder, here we include only the analysis of the 888 RAT samples.](https://bulldogjob.pl/articles/1200-an-in-depth-analysis-of-spynote-remote-access-trojan)_\n\n## Android 888 RAT\n\nThis commercial, multiplatform RAT was originally only published for the Windows\necosystem for $80. In June 2018, it was extended in the Pro version with the additional\ncapability to build Android RATs ($150). Later, the Extreme version could create Linux\npayloads as well ($200).\n\nIt was sold via the developer’s website at 888-tools[.]com (see Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Price for 888 RAT_\n\nIn 2019 the Pro version (Windows and Android) was found cracked (see Figure 6) and\navailable on a few websites for free.\n\n_Figure 6. Cracked version of 888 RAT builder_\n\n888 RAT has not been directly identified with any organized campaigns before; this is the\nfirst time this RAT has been assigned as an indicator of a cyberespionage group.\n\nFollowing this discovery, we were able to connect the Android 888 RAT to two more\norganized campaigns: Spy TikTok Pro _[described here and a campaign by Kasablanka](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/tiktok-spyware)_\n_Group._\n\n### Functionality\n\n\n-----\n\nAndroid 888 RAT is capable of executing 42 commands received from its C&C server, as\nseen in Table 1.\n\nIn short, it can steal and delete files from a device, take screenshots, get device location,\nphish Facebook credentials, get a list of installed apps, steal user photos, take photos,\nrecord surrounding audio and phone calls, make calls, steal SMS messages, steal the\ndevice’s contact list, send text messages, etc.\n\nThe builder is also used as the C&C to control all the compromised devices since it uses\ndynamic DNS to be reached by them.\n\nTable 1. List of supported commands\n\n**Command** **Functionality**\n\nUnistxcr Display app details of specified app\n\ndowsizetr Upload file to server from /sdcard/DCIM/.dat/\n\nDOWdeletx Delete file from /sdcard/DCIM/.dat/\n\nXr7aou Upload binary file to server from /sdcard/DCIM/.dat/\n\nCaspylistx List files from /sdcard/DCIM/.dat/\n\nspxcheck Check whether call recording service is running\n\nS8p8y0 Stop call recording service\n\nSxpxy1 Enable call recording service\n\nscreXmex Take screenshot and upload to server\n\nBatrxiops Get battery level\n\nL4oclOCMAWS Get device location\n\nFdelSRRT Delete file /sdcard/DCIM/.fdat (phished Facebook credentials)\n\nchkstzeaw Check whether Facebook app is installed\n\nIODBSSUEEZ Upload Facebook credentials to C&C from /sdcard/DCIM/.fdat\n\nGUIFXB Launch Facebook phishing activity\n\nosEEs Get requested permissions of the specified application\n\nLUNAPXER Launch specific application\n\nGapxplister Get list of applications installed on the device\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Functionality**\n\nDOTRall8xxe Compress files in /sdcard/DCIM/.dat/ directory and upload them to C&C\n\nAcouxacour Get all device accounts\n\nFimxmiisx Take photo from camera and upload it to C&C\n\nScxreexcv4 Get information about device cameras\n\nmicmokmi8x Record surrounding audio for the specified time\n\nDTXXTEGE3 Delete specific file from /sdcard directory\n\nODDSEe Open specific URL in default browser\n\nYufsssp Get Exif information from specific media file\n\ngetsssspo Get info about whether a specific file exists on device\n\nDXCXIXM Get names of all photos stored in /sdcard/DCIM/\n\nf5iledowqqww Upload specific file from /sdcard/ directory\n\nGExCaalsss7 Get call logs from device\n\nSDgex8se List files from specific directory from /sdcard\n\nPHOCAs7 Make call to specified number\n\nGxextsxms Get SMS inbox\n\nMsppossag Send SMS message to specified number\n\nGetconstactx Get contacts\n\nRinxgosa Play ringtone for six seconds\n\nShetermix Execute shell command\n\nbithsssp64 Execute shell script\n\nDeldatall8 Cleanup, remove all /sdcard/DCIM/.dat files\n\npvvvoze Get IP address\n\npaltexw Get TTL from PING command\n\nM0xSSw9 Display specific Toast message to user\n\n\n-----\n\nAn important factor when identifying 888 RAT is the package name of the payload. The\npackage name of every build of an Android payload is not custom or random; it always uses\nthe com.example.dat.a8andoserverx package ID. Because of this, it is easy to identify such\nsamples as 888 RAT.\n\nIn later versions of the 888 RAT (not the cracked RAT builder), we noticed that the builder\nwas capable of obfuscating strings (command strings, C&C, and other plain text strings) by\nencrypting them using AES with a hardcoded key; however, the package name still\nremained the same.\n\n### C&C\n\n888 RAT uses a custom IP protocol and port (it doesn’t have to be standard ports).\nCompromised devices are controlled directly from the builder GUI.\n\n### Facebook phishing\n\nWhen this functionality is triggered, 888 RAT will deploy phishing activity that appears to be\ncoming from the legitimate Facebook app. When the user taps on the recent apps button,\nthis activity will seem legitimate, as seen in Figure 7. However, after a long press on this\napp’s icon, as in Figure 8, the true app name responsible for the Facebook login request is\ndisclosed.\n\n_Figure 7. Phishing request visible from the recent app menu_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Real application name responsible for phishing_\n\n### Detection\n\nSince 2018, ESET products have identified hundreds of instances of Android devices where\nthe 888 RAT was deployed. Figure 9 presents the country distribution of this detection data.\n\n_Figure 9 Detection of Android 888 RAT by country_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis espionage campaign has been active since March 2020 aiming only at Android\ndevices. It targeted the Kurdish ethnic group through at least 28 malicious Facebook posts\nthat would lead potential victims to download Android 888 RAT or SpyNote. Most of the\nmalicious Facebook posts led to downloads of the commercial, multiplatform 888 RAT,\nwhich has been available on the black market since 2018. In 2019, a cracked copy of the\nPro version of the 888 RAT builder was made available from a few websites, and since\nthen, we detected hundreds of cases all around the world using the Android 888 RAT.\n\n## IoCs\n\n### Files and ESET detection names\n\n**SHA-1** **Detection name**\n\n87D44633F99A94C9B5F29F3FE75D04B2AB2508BA Android/Spy.Agent.APU\n\nE47AB984C0EC7872B458AAD803BE637F3EE6F3CA
