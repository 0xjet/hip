We worked closely with\n[CERT-UA in order to remediate and protect this critical infrastructure network.](https://cert.gov.ua/)\n\n[The collaboration resulted in the discovery of a new variant of Industroyer malware, which we together with CERT-UA](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/)\n[named Industroyer2 – see CERT-UA publication here. Industroyer is an infamous piece of malware that was used in](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518)\n2016 by the Sandworm APT group to cut power in Ukraine.\n\nIn this case, the Sandworm attackers made an attempt to deploy the Industroyer2 malware against high-voltage\nelectrical substations in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to Industroyer2, Sandworm used several destructive malware families including CaddyWiper, ORCSHRED,\nSOLOSHRED and AWFULSHRED. We first discovered CaddyWiper on 2022-03-14 when it was used against a\n[Ukrainian bank – see our Twitter thread about CaddyWiper. A variant of CaddyWiper was used again on 2022-04-08](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436420886712321)\n14:58 against the Ukrainian energy provider previously mentioned.\n\nAt this point, we don’t know how attackers compromised the initial victim nor how they moved from the IT network to the\nIndustrial Control System (ICS) network. Figure 1 shows an overview of the different malware used in this attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Overview of the malware deployed in the attack_\n\nFigure 2 summarizes the chain of events.\n\n**2022-02-24: Beginning of the current Russian invasion in Ukraine**\n**2022-03-14: Deployment of CaddyWiper against a Ukrainian bank**\n**2022-04-01: Deployment of CaddyWiper against a Ukrainian governmental entity**\n**2022-04-08 14:58 UTC: Deployment of CaddyWiper on some Windows machines and of Linux and Solaris**\ndestructive malware at the energy provider\n**2022-04-08 15:02:22 UTC: Sandworm operator creates the scheduled task to launch Industroyer2**\n**2022-04-08 16:10 UTC: Scheduled execution of Industroyer2 to cut power in an Ukrainian region**\n**2022-04-08 16:20 UTC: Scheduled execution of CaddyWiper on the same machine to erase Industroyer2 traces**\n\n_Figure 2. Timeline of events_\n\nIn 2017, ESET researchers revealed that a piece of malware that we named Industroyer was responsible for the power\n[blackout that impacted Ukraine’s capital Kiev in December 2016.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA)\n\n\n-----\n\n[As detailed in our white paper Win32/Industroyer: A new threat for industrial control systems, it is capable of interacting](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf)\nwith industrial control systems typically found in electric power systems. This includes IEC-101, IEC-104, IEC 61850\nand OPC DA devices.\n\nAt that time, we said that “it seems very unlikely anyone could write and test such malware without access to the\nspecialized equipment used in the specific, targeted industrial environment”. This was confirmed in 2020 by the United\nStates government when six officers of the Russian Military Unit 74455 of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), were\n[indicted for their role in multiple cyberattacks including Industroyer and NotPetya – see the indictment on justice.gov](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/)\n[and our historical overview of Sandworm’s operations.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/21/sandworm-tale-disruption-told-anew/)\n\nThe recently discovered malware is a new variant of Industroyer, hence the name Industroyer2.\n\n## Industroyer2\n\nIndustroyer2 was deployed as a single Windows executable named 108_100.exe and executed using a scheduled task\non 2022-04-08 at 16:10:00 UTC. It was compiled on 2022-03-23, according to the PE timestamp, suggesting that\nattackers had planned their attack for more than two weeks.\n\n_Figure 3. Timestamp and compiler information_\n\n[Industroyer2 only implements the IEC-104 (aka IEC 60870-5-104) protocol to communicate with industrial equipment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60870-5#IEC_60870-5-104)\nThis includes protection relays, used in electrical substations. This is a slight change from the 2016 Industroyer variant\nthat is a fully-modular platform with payloads for multiple ICS protocols.\n\nIndustroyer2 shares number of code similarities with the payload 104.dll of Industroyer. We assess with high confidence\nthat the new variant was built using the same source code.\n\nIndustroyer2 is highly configurable. It contains a detailed configuration hardcoded in its body, driving the malware\nactions. This is different from Industroyer, stores configuration in a separate .INI file. Thus, attackers need to recompile\nIndustroyer2 for each new victim or environment. However, given that the Industroyer* malware family has only been\ndeployed twice, with a five year gap between each version, this is probably not a limitation for Sandworm operators.\n\nThe new configuration format is stored as a string which is then supplied to the IEC-104 communication routine of the\nmalware. Industroyer2 is able to communicate with multiple devices at once. Specifically, the analyzed sample contains\neight different IP addresses of devices – see Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration contains values that are used during communication via IEC-104 protocol, such as ASDU (Application\nService Data Unit) address, Information Object Addresses (IOA), timeouts, etc.\n\nBefore connecting to the targeted devices, the malware terminates a legitimate process that is used in standard daily\noperations. In addition to that, it renames this application by adding .MZ to the filename. It does so in order to prevent\nautomatic re-start of this legitimate process.\n\nThe analysis is still ongoing in order to determine what are the exact actions taken for each device. We believe that this\ncomponent is able to control specific ICS systems in order to cut power.\n\nIndustroyer2 can produce a log file or output its progress to the console window. However, instead of meaningful text\nmessages as in the previous version, the malware writes various error codes – see Figure 5. We believe it is an\nobfuscation attempt by Sandworm developers to hamper analysis.\n\n_Figure 5. Output produced by Industroyer2 malware (IP addresses redacted by ESET)_\n\n## CaddyWiper\n\n\n-----\n\nIn coordination with the deployment of Industroyer2 in the ICS network, the attackers deployed a new version of the\nCaddyWiper destructive malware. We believe it was intended to slow down the recovery process and prevent operators\nof the energy company from regaining control of the ICS consoles. It was also deployed on the machine where\nIndustroyer2 was executed, likely to cover their tracks.\n\n[The first version of CaddyWiper was discovered by ESET researchers in Ukraine on 2022-03-14 when it was deployed](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436420886712321)\nin the network of a bank. It was deployed via Group Policy Object (GPO), indicating the attackers had prior control of\nthe target’s network beforehand. The wiper erases user data and partition information from attached drives, making the\nsystem inoperable and unrecoverable.\n\n### New CaddyWiper loading chain\n\nIn the network of the energy provider, attackers deployed a new version of CaddyWiper that uses a new loader, named\nARGUEPATCH by CERT-UA. ARGUEPATCH is a patched version of a legitimate component of Hex-Rays IDA Pro\nsoftware, specifically the remote IDA debugger server win32_remote.exe. IDA Pro is not intended to be used in an ICS\nenvironment, as its main purpose is for software reverse-engineering including malware analysis. We don’t know why\nattackers chose to trojanize this piece of software; it might be a troll towards defenders.\n\nARGUEPATCH was executed by a scheduled task that was intended to be launched once on 2022-04-08 14:58 UTC\non one machine and at 16:20 UTC on the machine where Industroyer2 was deployed.\n\nThe patched binary loads encrypted shellcode from a file and decrypts it with a key, both are provided on command\nline. A single-byte XOR key is derived from the input key and used to decrypt the shellcode.\n\nThe decrypted shellcode is a slightly modified version of CaddyWiper. A comparison of their main routines is provided in\nFigure 6 and Figure 7. Note that they do not wipe the domain controller, and they wipe C:\\Users\\ and disks from D:\\ to\n\n[:\\. The wiping routine is also almost identical: it fills all files with 0.\n\n_Figure 6. Main routine of the first sample of CaddyWiper._\n\n_Figure 7. Main routine of the CaddyWiper sample deployed at the energy provider_\n\nFinally, CaddyWiper calls DeviceIoControl with IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX and a zeroed InputBuffer for\nall disks from \\\\PHYSICALDRIVE9 to \\\\PHYSICALDRIVE0. This erases [extended information of the drive’s partitions:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-drive_layout_information_ex)\nthe Master boot record (MBR) or the GUID Partition Table (GPT). This renders the machine unbootable.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Active Directory enumeration\n\nAlongside CaddyWiper, a PowerShell script was found both in the energy provider network and in the bank that was\ncompromised earlier.\n\nThis script enumerates Group Policies Objects (GPO) using the Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI). The script,\n[shown in Figure 8, is almost identical to a snippet provided in a Medium blogpost.](https://medium.com/@pentesttas/discover-hidden-gpo-s-on-active-directory-using-ps-adsi-a284b6814c81)\n\nWe believe that attackers deployed CaddyWiper via a GPO and used the script to check the existence of this GPO.\n\n_Figure 8. PowerShell script to enumerate GPO (beautified)_\n\n## Linux and Solaris destructive malware (ORCSHRED, SOLOSHRED, AWFULSHRED)\n\nAdditional destructive malware for systems running Linux and Solaris was also found on the network of the targeted\nenergy company. There are two main components to this attack: a worm and a wiper. The latter was found in two\nvariants, one for each of the targeted operating system. All malware was implemented in Bash.\n\n## The worm\n\nThe first component launched by the attacker was a worm, having its file named sc.sh. This Bash script starts by adding\na scheduled task (cron job) to launch the wiper component at 2:58pm UTC (assuming the system is in the local time\nzone, UTC+3), unless it was launched with the “owner” argument. This is likely a way to avoid the initial system used to\nlaunch the worm auto-destructing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Setting up the cron job to launch the wiper at 5:58pm. The correct wiper is picked depending on the installed operating_\n\n_system._\n\nThe script then iterates over the networks accessible by the system by looking at the result of ip route or ifconfig -a. It\nalways assumes a class C network (/24) is reachable for each IP address it collects. It will try to connect to all hosts in\nthose networks using SSH to TCP port 22, 2468, 24687 and 522. Once it finds a reachable SSH server, it tries\ncredentials from a list provided with the malicious script. We believe the attacker had credentials prior to the attack to\nenable the spread of the wiper.\n\nIf the system is not already compromised, malware is copied to the new target, and the worm is launched. The worm is\n_not launched with the owner argument, so the wiper is scheduled to launch at 2:58pm UTC and destroy all data. If those_\nsystems were set to the local time zone, the destruction must’ve started at the same time as the system compromised\nwith CaddyWiper.\n\n## The Linux wiper\n\nThe Linux variant of the wiper is lightly obfuscated: variables and function names have been replaced with meaningless\n8-letter words. Most literal values were also replaced with variables at the beginning of the file.\n\n_Figure 10. Except from the obfuscated script (whitespace optimized)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Deobfuscation of the above obtained by renaming functions and variables and using literals_\n\n[Ultimately, the Linux wiper destroys the whole content of the disks attached to the system by using shred if available or](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html)\nsimply dd (with if=/dev/random) otherwise. If multiple disks are attached, data removal is done in parallel to speed up\nthe process.\n\nDepending on the size, it may take hours for the full disk to be completely erased. To render the system inoperable\nfaster, it first tries to stop and disable HTTP and SSH services. Both services are disabled by using systemctl disable.\nTo ensure service isn’t reenabled, the systemd unit file responsible for loading the service is deleted from the disk.\n\nFiles from /boot, /home and /var/log are also removed before destroying the full drives. This makes the system\ninoperable faster, deletes user data and perhaps removes incriminating logs.\n\n[The malicious script’s last action is to forcibly initiate a reboot using SysRq. Since all drives are filled with random, no](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html)\noperating system will boot.\n\n## The Solaris wiper\n\nUnlike the Linux wiper, the Solaris variant is not obfuscated.\n\nLike the Linux variant, the malicious script iterates over all services to stop and disable them if they contain the keyword\nssh, http, apache and additionally ora_ or oracle. Those services are very likely used by applications used to control\nICS systems. Wiping them would prevent the energy company’s operators from retaking control of the substations and\nroll back Industroyer2 actions.\n\nIt uses either systemctl or [svcadm depending on what’s available. The latter is most likely since Solaris is not running](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E86824_01/html/E54764/svcadm-1m.html)\nsystemd.\n\nFile destruction begins by deleting databases. It removes, using shred then rm, all files and directories contained in\nenvironment variables starting with ORA. Note that [shred makes sure data recovery (without a backup) isn’t possible.](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html#shred-invocation)\n\nLike the Linux variant, files in /boot, /home and /var/log are deleted with priority.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the script iterates over disks connected to the system, found in /dev/dsk/. It ignores slices (partitions) and work\nonly on full disks. For each of them, the malicious script overwrites the full content using shred. To minimize the time\nrequired to perform the wipe, all disks are erased in parallel.\n\nLastly, the script self-destructs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUkraine is once again at the center of cyberattacks targeting their critical infrastructure. This new Industroyer campaign\nfollows multiple waves of wipers that have been targeting various sectors in Ukraine. ESET researchers will continue to\nmonitor the threat landscape in order to better protect organizations from these types of destructive attacks.\n\nAnd a big thanks to [@_CERT_UA who worked with us on this case and provided samples.
