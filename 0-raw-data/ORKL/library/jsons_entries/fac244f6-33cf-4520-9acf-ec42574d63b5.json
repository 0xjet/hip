There seems to\nbe a resurgence of activity from the group, and recent\nevents show how their tools and techniques have\n[evolved. Just last week they were found stealing millions](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075124/north-korea-lazarus-atm-fastcash-hack-millions-dollars-stolen)\nfrom ATMs across Asia and Africa. We also recently\ndiscovered that they successfully planted their backdoor\n[(detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) into](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/bkdr_binlodr.znfj-a)\nseveral machines of financial institutions across Latin America.\n\nWe determined that these backdoors were installed on the targets’ machines on September\n19 2018, based mainly on the service creation time of the loader component. We also saw\nthat the attack technique bears some resemblance to a previous 2017 Lazarus attack,\n[analyzed by BAE Systems, against targets in Asia. The use of FileTokenBroker.dll was a key](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/10/taiwan-heist-lazarus-tools.html)\npart of the group’s attack in 2017, and they seem to have used the same modularized\nbackdoor in the recent incident as well.\n\nOur analysis of the backdoors used in the September 2018 attacks show that\nAuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll was similarly used:\n\n\n**FileTokenBroker.dll (2017 att**\n**ack)**\n\n\n**AuditCred.dll/Roptimizer.dll (2018**\n**attack)**\n\n\n**Launch Method** Service Service\n\n**Function** Loader Component Loader Component\n\n**Working directory** %Windows%\\System32 %Windows%\\System32\n\n**Loaded Component Path** %Windows%\\System32\\en-US %Program Files%\\Common Files\\System\n\\ado\n\n\n**Loaded Component**\n**Blending**\n\n\nBlends with .mui files Blend with ActiveX data Object dll files\n\n\n_Table1: Similarities of the Loader components in both incidents_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Lazarus group used a series of backdoors in their 2018 attacks, employing a\ncomplicated technique that involves three major components:\n\n**AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) –**\nloader DLL that is launched as a service\n**Msadoz<n>.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR64_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted**\nbackdoor\n**n = number of characters in the loader dll’s filename**\n**Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui (detected by Trend Micro as**\nTROJ_BINLODRCONF.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted configuration file\n\n_Figure 1: Loading sequence of the modularized backdoor_\n\nThe loader DLL is installed as a service and uses different names (AuditCred and\nROptimizer) on different machines. However, they still have the same capabilities and are\nessentially the same file. Its purpose is to load Msadoz<n>.dll in order to decrypt and\nexecute it in memory.\n\n_Figure 2: AuditCred/ROptimizer Service_\n\nIf successfully installed, this particular\nbackdoor poses quite a threat to its target.\nIt is capable of the following functions:\n\nCollect file/folder/drive information\nDownload files and additional\nmalware\nLaunch/terminate/enumerate\nprocess\nUpdate configuration data\nDelete files\nInject code from files to other\nrunning process\nUtilize proxy\n\n\n-----\n\nRun in passive mode — instead of actively connecting to the command and control\n(C&C) server, the backdoor will open and listen to a port then receive commands\nthrough it\n\nOnce the backdoor is loaded, it will then load the encrypted configuration file\n**Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui to extract the C&C information and connect to it. The**\nconnection is necessary for conducting activities; and based on the backdoor’s functions,\nthese actions could be quite damaging to targets.\n\n_Figure 3: The first step of decryption will perform XOR on one byte using the previous_\n_adjacent byte, starting from the last byte and excluding the first byte_\n\n_Figure 4: The second step uses RC4, using the first 0x20 bytes from the result of the first step_\n_as the RC4 key_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Encrypted (Top) and decrypted (bottom) configuration file_\n\nIt is also important to note that while the loader component and the configuration file are\nlocated in the same directory (%windows%\\system32), the encrypted backdoor is located\nin a different directory (%Program Files%\\Common Files\\System\\ado). This complex setup\nmakes it harder to detect and remove all the backdoors, and is more effective at hiding any\nactivities.\n\nThe complexity and the capabilities of these backdoors present a tough problem for the\ntargeted organizations. It is a sophisticated attack that needs equally sophisticated\nsecurity solutions.\n\n**_Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\nThe Lazarus group is an experienced organization, methodically evolving their tools and\nexperimenting with strategies to get past an organization’s defenses. The backdoors they\nare deploying are difficult to detect and a significant threat to the privacy and security of\nenterprises, allowing attackers to steal information, delete files, install malware, and more.\n\nThese and other tools used by the Lazarus group can be mitigated by routinely scanning\nthe network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and\nspreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people\n[in an organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/keep-an-eye-out-for-these-social-engineering-scams)\nout for when it comes to malicious attacks.\n\nOther mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s\n[perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to](http://blog.trendmicro.com/ensuring-comprehensive-endpoint-security/)\nhelp prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFree™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting\nmalicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs.\n[Trend Micro Deep Discovery™ has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/)\ndetecting malicious attachments and URLs that could lead to malicious downloads.\n\n[Trend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/all-solutions.html)\ntechniques to protect systems from all types of threats.
