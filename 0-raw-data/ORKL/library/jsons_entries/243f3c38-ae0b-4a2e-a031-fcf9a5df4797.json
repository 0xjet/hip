We have observed several new domains\nbeing created which perform this malicious activity, such as ukrainehelp[.]world and\nukrainethereum[.]com.\n\n**Ukrainhelp[.]world**\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Ukrainehelp[.]world, which is a phishing site asking for crypto\ndonations for UNICEF. The website contains the BBC logo and several crypto wallet\naddresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile investigating this site, we observed that the Ethereum wallet used use was also\nassociated with an older crypto scam site called eth-event20.com. The image below shows\nthe current value of the crypto wallet which is worth $114,000. Interestingly this wallet\ntransfers all its coins to 0xc95eb2aa75260781627e7171c679a490e2240070 which in turn\ntransfers to 0x45fb09468b17d14d2b9952bc9dcb39ee7359e64d. The final wallet currently\nhas 313 ETH which is worth over $850,000. This shows the large sums of money scammers\ncan generate with phishing sites.\n\n**Ukrainethereum[.]com**\n\nUkrainethereum[.]com is another crypto scam site, but what makes this one interesting is the\nfeatures it contains to gain the victim’s confidence in trusting the website such as a fake\nchatbox and a fake donation verifier.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Chat**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe image above shows the chatbox on the left-hand side which displays several messages.\nAt first glance, it would appear as if other users are on the website and talking, but when you\nreload the site it shows the same messages. This is due to the chat messages being\ndisplayed from a list that is used to populate the website with JavaScript code as shown on\nthe right-hand side.\n\n**_Fake Donation Verifier_**\n\nThe site contains a donation checker so the victim can see if their donation was received, as\nshown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The first image on left shows the verification box for donation to check if it is completed\n\nor not\n2. Upon clicking ‘Check’ the victim is shown a message to say the donation was\n\nreceived.\n3. What occurs, is upon clicking ‘Check’ the JavaScript code changes the website code\n\nso that it displays the ‘Thanks!’ message, and no actual check is performed.\n\n**Phishing Email**\n\nThe following image shows one of the examples of phish emails we have observed.\n\nThe email is not addressed to anyone specifically as they are mass-mailed to multiple email\naddresses. The wallet IDs in the email are not associated with the official Ukraine Twitter and\nare owned by scammers. As you can see in the image above, they are similar as the first 3\ncharacters are the same. This could lead to some users believing it is legitimate. Therefore,\nit’s important to check that the wallet address is identical.\n\n**Credit Card Information Stealer**\n\nThis is the most common type of phishing website. The goal of these sites it entices the\nvictim into entering their credit card and personally identifiable information (PII) data by\nmaking them believe that the site being visited is official. This section contains details on one\nsuch website we have found using Ukraine donations as a lure.\n\n**_Razonforukrain[.]com_**\n\nThe image below shows the phishing site. The website was used to save the children’s NGO\nlinks and images, which made it appear more genuine. You can see that is it asking the\nvictim to enter their credit card and billing information.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the data is entered, and the victim clicks on ‘Donate’, the information will be submitted\nvia the form and will be sent to scammers so they can then use or sell the information.\n\nWe observed that a few days after the website was created, the scammers change the site\ncode so that it became a Mcdonald’s phishing site targeting the Arab Emirates. This was a\nsurprising change in tactics.\n\nThe heatmap below shows the detections McAfee has observed around the world for the\nmalicious sites mentioned in this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**How to identify a phishing email?**\n\nLook for the domain from where you received mail, attackers masquerade it.\nUse McAfee Web Advisor as this prevents you from accessing malicious sites\nIf McAfee Web Advisor is not used, links can be manually checked at\n[https://trustedsource.org/.](https://trustedsource.org/)\nPerform a Web Search of any crypto wallet addresses.

If the search returns no or a low number of\nhits it is likely fraudulent\nHyperlinks and site addresses that do not match the sender – Hover your mouse over\nthe hyperlink or call-to-action button in the email.
