TA444, a North Korea-sponsored\nadvanced persistent threat group, has taken these mantras to heart. TA444, which overlaps\n[with public activity called APT38,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government) [Bluenoroff,](https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/) [BlackAlicanto,](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Wikoff-Talent-Need-Not-Apply.pdf) [Stardust Chollima,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-april-stardust-chollima/)\n[and COPERNICIUM, is likely tasked with generating revenue for the North Korean regime.](https://lopezdoriga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2022.pdf)\nThat tasking has historically involved the targeting of banks to ultimately funnel cash to the\nHermit Kingdom or handlers abroad. More recently, TA444 has turned its attention, much like\nthe tech industry, to cryptocurrency. While we do not know if the group has ping pong tables\nor kegs of some overrated IPA in its workspace, TA444 does mirror the startup culture in its\ndevotion to the dollar and to the grind.\n\n## Fail Fast with File Type Variations\n\nBack in its [infant interest with blockchain and cryptocurrency, TA444 had two main avenues](https://lifars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lessons-Learned-from-64-Million-Dollar-Cryptocurrency-Hack-Case-Study.pdf)\n[of initial access: an LNK-oriented delivery chain and a chain beginning with documents using](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/how-threat-actors-are-adapting-post-macro-world)\nremote templates. These campaigns were typically referred to\n\n\n-----\n\nas [DangerousPassword,](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf) [CryptoCore, or](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CryptoCore_Group.pdf) [SnatchCrypto. In 2022, TA444 continued to use](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\nboth methods, but had also tried its hand at other file types for initial access. Despite having\nnot heavily relied on macros in previous campaigns, TA444 seemed to mirror the cybercrime\nlandscape in the summer and fall, attempting to find additional file types to stuff its payloads\ninto.\n\nIt is unclear if the threat actor had a hackathon to generate these ideas, but we believe some\nof the (dramatized) conversations may have sounded like this:\n\n_[MSI Installer files? Let’s give it a shot but try a few varieties and see what sticks!](https://mobile.twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1553024111433113600)_\n\n_[Virtual Hard Drive?](https://mobile.twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1595440184551739398)_ _[TA580 used it to drop Bumblebee, why don’t we have a VHD](https://twitter.com/k3dg3/status/1575173131198558208)_\n_chain?_\n\n_[ISOs to bypass MoTW? If the market wants it, let’s give it to them!](https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/)_\n\n_[Compiled HTML? What are we, TA406? Eh, give it a try anyway!](https://mobile.twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1602314597926576131)_\n\n_We can experiment all we want but we must keep up with our CageyChameleon and_\n_Astraeus quotas to meet our OKRs!_\n\nEqually as surprising as the variance in delivery methods is the lack of a consistent payload\nat the end of the delivery chains. When other financially-oriented threat actors test delivery\nmethods, they tend to load their traditional payloads; this is not the case with TA444. This\nsuggests that there is an embedded, or at least a devoted, malware development element\nalongside TA444 operators.\n\n## What’s Our Go-to-Market?\n\nTo convince victims to click on malicious links, TA444 has a complete marketing strategy to\nincrease its chances of new ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue). It all starts with crafting lure\ncontent that may be of interest or necessity to the target. These can include analyses of\ncryptocurrency blockchains, job opportunities at prestigious firms, or salary adjustments.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Example TA444 email lure using salary adjustment themes._\n\nTA444 has abused email marketing tools like SendInBlue and SendGrid to engage with its\ntarget audience. These serve as redirectors to either cloud-hosted files or connect the victim\ndirectly to TA444 infrastructure. Additionally, the use of such links removes some stigma from\nthe user of clicking on an unknown link, as marketing links will not necessarily get called out\nby phishing training.\n\nLike other entities in the tech and cryptocurrency space, someone in TA444’s organization\noversees socials. This is a very strong component of TA444’s practice, as the threat actor\n[has continued to use LinkedIn to engage with victims prior to delivering links to malware.](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\nProofpoint has observed this group demonstrating workable understandings of English,\nSpanish, Polish, and Japanese.\n\n## Test in Prod\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early December 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed a significant deviation from\nnormal TA444 operations via a relatively basic credential harvesting campaign. A TA444 C2\ndomain sent OneDrive phishing emails rife with typos to a wide variety of targets in the\nUnited States and Canada, spanning several verticals including education, government, and\nhealthcare, in addition to financial verticals. The lure emails enticed users to click a SendGrid\nURL which redirected to a credential harvesting page. The deviation in TA444’s targeting and\nvolume of messages made us thoroughly analyze the campaign to both understand the\nactivity, but also challenged our assumptions about the group. This spam wave alone nearly\ndoubled the total volume of TA444 email messages we had observed in our data during\n2022, so we were concerned about false positive detection, as well as understanding a\npotential change in TA444 objectives.\n\nThe from header used the term Admin and the target domain name, but all used the same\nenvelope-from email address (admin[@]sharedrive[.]ink) and subject (Invoice spelled with a\nlowercase L).\n\n_Figure 2. TA444 phishing email that deviated from expected themes and targeting._\n\nThe SendGrid URLs are used to redirect targets to the domain superiorexhbits[.]com which\nuses common phishing tactics such as loading the victim's iconography via the logorendering service ClearBit. This sprawling credential harvesting activity is a deviation from\nnormal TA444 campaigns, which typically involve the direct deployment of malware. In fact,\n[this same domain was observed serving a TA444 VHD containing Cur1Agent on the same](https://urlscan.io/result/284a064b-63bc-4e6e-aa06-21cf86b7f6fe)\nday.\n\nProofpoint attributed this campaign with moderate to moderately high confidence based on\nthe exclusivity of TA444 infrastructure. Other domains hosted on that IP match previous\nTA444 typo squats. The emails also had valid DMARC and SPF records, indicating that the\nsender has control of that domain. Proofpoint cannot rule out that the TA444 server was\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised by another actor to send the phishing links. It is also possible that TA444, like\n[other North Korean actors such as Andariel, has begun its own moonlighting operations. If](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm774)\nthis occurred, we would anticipate seeing tool and infrastructure re-use as well as continued\ndeviation of targeting away from major cryptocurrency and financial institutions.\n\n## The Culture is the Foundation\n\nWhile TA444 has experimented with new lines of production, their core families still carry the\n[brunt of their infections. The CageyChameleon (aka CabbageRAT) family has expanded its](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf)\nfunctionality but still operates as a victim-profiling framework, exfiltrating running processes\nand host information while setting up the potential to launch subsequent tooling loaded from\n[the command-and-control server. The lure LNKs used to initiate execution are still often titled](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html)\nPassword.txt.lnk.\n\n_Figure 3. Decrypted CageyChameleon data exfiltration._\n\n[Similarly, TA444 has stayed the course with its infrastructure deployments and document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZecjABjSk&t=1343s)\n[content, effectively reusing lure iconography in second-stage macro-laden files](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1570501870954905600)\n[and borrowing content directly from entities it is spoofing. First stage remote template files](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Wikoff-Talent-Need-Not-Apply.pdf)\nhave adapted to not only download the second-stage macro (tracked as Astraeus by\nProofpoint) but the first stage now contains an obfuscated Cardinal backdoor, as noted\nby [PWC and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZecjABjSk&t=1343s) [Kaspersky.](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4.

The US\nFederal Bureau of Investigation attributed the heist of a major cryptocurrency bridge to\nAPT38, a group which heavily overlaps with TA444, where funds were later mixed in\nBlenderIO. This attribution underlines how reliant TA444 is on the cryptocurrency ecosystem\nto steal funds, create an avenue to launder them, and cash out. Recent TA444 activity\nhighlights how willing the adversary is to adapt their methods to continue to profit from its\n[intrusions, and new services will like aide them in their efforts, even if unintentionally.](https://www.cfr.org/blog/north-koreas-cryptocurrency-craze-and-its-impact-us-policy)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile we may poke fun at its broad campaigns and ease of clustering, TA444 is an astute\nand capable adversary that is willing and able to defraud victims for hundreds of millions of\n[dollars. TA444 and related clusters are assessed to have stolen nearly $400 million dollars’](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/north-korean-hackers-have-prolific-year-as-their-total-unlaundered-cryptocurrency-holdings-reach-all-time-high/)\n[worth of cryptocurrency and related assets in 2021.

North](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-attribution-of-malicious-cyber-activity-posed-by-the-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea)\nKorea, like other cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has weathered the declining value of\ncryptocurrencies, but remains engaged in its efforts to use cryptocurrency as a vehicle to\nprovide usable funds to the regime.\n\n## ET
