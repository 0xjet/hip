Buried in the malware zoo, the threat seems to have been operational since at\nleast 2015, undocumented by the research community.\n\nOur interest was stirred by its remote access capabilities, which include unfettered control\nof the compromised computer, lateral movement across the organization and rootkit-like\ndetection-evasion mechanisms. Powered by a vast array of features, this RAT was used in\ntargeted attacks aimed at exfiltrating information or monitoring victims in large networked\norganizations.\n\nIn addition to its very powerful data exfiltration mechanisms, RadRAT features extremely\ninteresting lateral movement mechanisms that\n\n– Mimikatz-like credentials harvesting from WDigest.dll and kerberos.dll;\n\n– NTLM hash harvesting from the Windows registry, inspired from the source code of the\nMimikatz lsadmp tool;\n\n– Using the infected machine to retrieve a Windows password from the LanMan (LM) hash,\nby cracking previously sniffed NTLM authentication challenges;\n\n– An implementation of the Pass-the-Hash attack on SMB connections.\n\n[Download the whitepaper](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/200/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-RADrat-crea2645-A4-en-EN-interactive.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [whitepapers](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/whitepapers/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Bogdan BOTEZATU\n\nInformation security professional.
