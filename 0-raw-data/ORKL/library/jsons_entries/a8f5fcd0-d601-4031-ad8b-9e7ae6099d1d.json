The threat actors, first\n\nmentioned in a report from January 2018 and tracked by ESET since mid-2017, continue to develop new\n\nversions of their stealthy malware.\n\nIn this white paper, we take a closer look at this ongoing campaign. We provide further details on the\n\nmalware used to compromise victims’ systems and on the payloads installed on compromised systems,\n\nand describe the various methods the attackers use to distribute and target their malware while\n\navoiding detection.\n\n### ATTACKER PROFILE\n\nEven though these threat actors don’t seem to possess advanced skills or access to 0-day vulnerabilities,\n\nthey have been quite successful in using social engineering to both distribute their malware and fly\n\nunder the radar for extended periods of time.\n\nWe were able to trace attacker activity back to October 2015; however, it is possible that the attackers\n\nhave been active even longer.\n\nThese attackers use three different .NET malware strains in their attacks – Quasar RAT, Sobaken (a RAT\n\nderived from Quasar) and a custom-made RAT called Vermin. All three malware strains have been in\n\nactive use against different targets at the same time, they share some infrastructure and connect to the\n\nsame C&C servers. A possible explanation for using three parallel malware strains is that each strain is\n\ndeveloped independently.\n\n### VICTIMS\n\nThis malware cluster has been used to target Ukrainian government institutions as seen in Figure 1.\n\nESET’s telemetry shows a few hundred victims in different organizations and several hundred executable\n\nfiles related to the campaign.\n\nFigure 1 // ESET’s detections of Quasar, Sobaken, Vermin, and their\n\nmalicious components (Map data ©2018 Google, ORION-ME).\n\n\n-----\n\n### TIMELINE\n\nAnother way to look at telemetry data is in the form of a timeline, as in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 // Timeline of these ongoing campaigns.\n\n### DISTRIBUTION METHODS\n\nAccording to our telemetry, the attackers have been using email as the primary distribution channel for\n\nall three strains of malware. They have been quite successful in using social engineering to lure victims\n\ninto downloading and executing the malware.\n\nIn most cases, filenames are in Ukrainian and refer to specific topics likely to be relevant to victims’\n\noccupations.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamples of such filenames:\n\n- “ІНСТРУКЦІЯ з організації забезпечення військовослужбовців Збройних Сил України та членів їх\n\nсімей” (roughly translates to “Directive on providing security for military personnel of Ukranian Army\n\nand their family members”)\n\n- “новий проекту наказу, призначення перевірки вилучення” – (translates to “A new draft of directive\n\nregarding verification of seizure“)\n\n- “Відділення забезпечення Дон ОВК. Збільшення ліміту” – (translates to “Purchasing department\n\nDon OVK. Increase of credit limit”)\n\nAlong with the basic social engineering technique of making email attachments attractive to their\n\nintended victims, three specific technical methods have been observed in use by these attackers. These\n\npresumably further improve the effectiveness of these campaigns.\n\n[Method #1: Email attachments using Unicode right-to-left override in their filenames to obscure their](https://redcanary.com/blog/right-to-left-override/)\n\nreal extension. These are actually executable files using Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Acrobat Reader\n\nicons to appear more trustworthy.\n\nExample file name: As seen in Figure 3 “Перевезення твердого палива (дров) для забезпечення\n\nопалювання_<<RLO>>xcod.scr” (translates to “Transport of firewood in order to provide heating”) will\n\nbe seen with what the unwary may take to be a .DOCX extension.\n\nFigure 3 // Executable file disguised as a Word document.\n\nMethod #2: Email attachments disguised as RAR self-extracting archives.\n\nExample: Email with the attachment “Наказ_МОУ_Додатки_до_Iнструкцii_440_ост.rar” (Translation \n“Order of Ministry of Defense, Appendixes to Instruction No. 440”), as seen in Figure 4. Inside of the RAR\n\narchive, there is an executable file named “Наказ_МОУ_Додатки_до_Iнструкцii_440_ост.exe” that\n\nuses a RAR SFX icon. Victims would presumably run this file, thinking that further contents of a self\nextracting archive would be extracted, but will inadvertently launch the malicious executable instead.\n\nMethod #3: Word document plus CVE-2017-0199 exploit. This vulnerability is triggered when the victim\n\nopens a specially crafted Word document. The Word process issues an HTTP request for an HTA file that\n\ncontains a malicious script, located on a remote server. The malicious script will then be executed by\n```\nmshta.exe. The first public information about this vulnerability appeared in April 2017 and Microsoft fixed\n\n```\nit by issuing Security updates for all versions of Windows and Office.\n\nAccording to ESET’s telemetry, these threat actors started using this method in May 2017. Attackers\n\nused hxxp://chip-tuning.lg[.]ua/ to deliver the HTA files and the final payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 // File disguised as a RAR self-extracting archive. Version\n\ninformation and copyright year reliably tell us that it’s a fake.\n\n### INSTALLATION AND PERSISTENCE\n\nThe installation procedure is the same for all three malware strains used by these attackers. A dropper\n\ndrops a malicious payload file (Vermin, Quasar or Sobaken malware) into the %APPDATA% folder, in a\n\nsubfolder named after a legitimate company (usually Adobe, Intel or Microsoft). Then, as seen\n\nin Figure 5, it creates a scheduled task that runs the payload every 10 minutes to ensure its persistence.\n\n[Some versions also employ a trick of abusing the Windows Control Panel shortcut functionality to make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Master_Control_Panel_shortcut)\n\ntheir folders inaccessible from Windows Explorer. Such a folder will not open when clicked in Windows\n\nExplorer; instead it leads to the All Tasks page in the Windows Control Panel.\n\nFigure 5 // Task scheduled to run the dropped malicious payload every 10 minutes.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamples:\n```\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Proof\\Settings.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C99712043E01C}\\TransactionBroker32.exe\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\SLStore\\Setting.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C99712043E01C}\\AdobeSLService.exe\n\n### VICTIM TARGETING\n\n```\nThe attackers have been using quite a few tricks to ensure that the malware runs on targeted machines\n\nonly, with special focus on avoiding automated analysis systems and sandboxes.\n\nMethod #1: Windows keyboard layout check.\n\nThe malware checks if Russian or Ukrainian keyboard layout is installed. If not, it terminates\n\nimmediately.\n\nMethod #2: IP address check.\n\nThe malware obtains its host computer’s IP address via a request to the legitimate service\n\nipinfo.io/json. The malware terminates if the IP address is not located in Ukraine or Russia, or if the IP\n\naddress is registered to one of several selected antimalware vendors or cloud providers. Code related to\n\nthese checks is seen in the disassemblies in Figures 6 and 7.\n\nFigure 6 // Code checking geolocation of host IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 // Code checking IP address against a list of cloud providers and antimalware vendors.\n\nMethod #3: Emulated network environment check.\n\nAutomated analysis systems often use tools like Fakenet-NG where all DNS/HTTP communication\n\nsucceeds and returns some result. Malware authors try to identify such systems by generating a random\n\nwebsite name/URL and testing for connection to the URL to fail, such as in Figure 8, as would be\n\nexpected on a real system.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 // Code generating random URL and attempting download.\n\nMethod #4: Specific username check.\n\nThe malware refuses to run under accounts with usernames typical of automated malware analysis\n\nsystems, as seen in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9 // Checking current username against a list of known malware analysis systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n### USE OF STEGANOGRAPHY TO BYPASS CONTENT FILTERING\n\nIn mid-2017, the attackers explored the possibility of hiding payloads in images that were hosted on the\n\nfree image hosting websites saveshot.net and ibb.co.\n\nSteganography is the science of hiding data “in plain sight” – within other, non-secret data. In this case,\n\na malicious EXE file was encrypted and hidden inside a valid JPEG file, such as the example in Figure 10.\n\nThe malware downloaded and decoded the JPEG file, extracted the hidden data, decrypted the EXE file\n\nfrom that data, and launched it.\n\nFigure 10 // Example of a JPEG image used for payload hiding (image resized and payload removed).\n\nThe decryption process is quite complex and can be described as follows:\n\n1. Download the JPEG from the URL hardcoded in the downloader binary.\n\n2. Brute-force an 8-digit password by calculating its hash and verifying against the hash hardcoded\n\nin the downloader binary. This step is very CPU intensive and takes typical desktop computer 10+\n\nminutes to complete. This is most likely another measure against automated malware analysis\n\nsystems.\n\n3. Process the JPEG file and extract data hidden in it, as seen in the code disassemblies\n\n[in Figures 11 and 12. The algorithm used by the malware is very similar to JSteg, one of the oldest and](https://zooid.org/~paul/crypto/jsteg/)\n\nsimplest steganography algorithms for JPEG files that hides data in the LSB (least significant bit)\n\nof JPEG DCT coefficients. Such hidden data does not usually affect an image in a way that is visible\n\nto the naked eye, but the presence of hidden data is easily detectable with specialized algorithms.\n\nHowever, this steganography algorithm is very easy to implement, which is probably the reason it\n\nwas chosen by the malware authors.\n\n4. Extract data and decompress using GZip.\n\n5. Decrypt the decompressed data using AES and the password obtained in step 2.\n\n6. Decode decrypted data using Base64.\n\n7. Write EXE file to disk and execute it.\n\nEventually, these threat authors abandoned the steganography idea and started using\n\nhxxp://chip-tuning.lg[.]ua to serve unencrypted malware executables.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 // Steganography code inside JPEG decoder.\n\nFigure 12 // Steganography code inside JPEG decoder.\n\n\n-----\n\n### MALWARE STRAINS\n\nThese threat actors are using three different malware strains in their attacks. We will provide a quick\n\noverview of each of them and focus on describing their unique features.\n\n#### Quasar\n\nQuasar is an open-source RAT (Remote Access Tool) which is freely available on GitHub. We’ve seen\n\nseveral campaigns where these threat actors used Quasar RAT binaries.\n\nThe first campaign we are aware of lasted from October 2015 to April 2016.\n\nThe next campaign utilizing the Quasar RAT took place in February 2017. Compilation artifacts show the\n\nPDB path n:\\projects\\Viral\\baybak_files_only\\QRClient\\QuasarRAT-master\\Library\\obj\\\n```\nRelease\\Library.pdb\n\n```\nAnother Quasar RAT campaign using these attackers’ C&C servers (mailukr.net) occurred in July\nSeptember 2017. In this case, attackers used an old version of the Quasar RAT named “xRAT 2.0\n\nRELEASE3”. Compilation artifacts in the dropper show the PDB path N:\\shtorm\\WinRARArchive\\\n```\nobj\\Release\\WinRAR.pdb\n\n#### Sobaken\n\n```\nSobaken is a heavily modified version of the Quasar RAT. When comparing the program structure of\n\nQuasar and Sobaken, we can see quite a few similarities, such as in Figure 13.\n\nThe malware authors keep removing functionality, thus creating a much smaller executable, which is\n\nalso easier to hide. They also added anti-sandbox, and other evasion, tricks described above.\n\nFigure 13 // Evolution of Sobaken. Left: Quasar RAT v1.3, middle and right – 2 versions of Sobaken.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Vermin\n\nVermin is a custom-made backdoor that is used only by these threat actors, and was first documented\n\n[in Palo Alto Networks report from January 2018. It first appeared in mid-2016 and is still in use. Just like](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/01/unit42-vermin-quasar-rat-custom-malware-used-ukraine/)\n\nQuasar and Sobaken, it is written in .NET. To slow down analysis, the program code is protected using\n\nthe commercial .NET code protection system .NET Reactor or the open-source protector ConfuserEx.\n\nAlso, just like Sobaken, it uses Vitevic Assembly Embedder, free software for embedding required DLLs\n\ninto the main executable, available from Visual Studio Marketplace.\n\n##### Functionality\n\nVermin is a full-featured backdoor with several optional components. The latest known version of\n\nVermin at the time of writing (Vermin 2.0) supports the following, self-explanatory, commands:\n\n- StartCaptureScreen\n\n- StopCaptureScreen\n\n- ReadDirectory\n\n- UploadFile\n\n- DownloadFile\n\n- CancelUploadFile\n\n- CancelDownloadFile\n\n- GetMonitors\n\n- DeleteFiles\n\n- ShellExec\n\n- GetProcesses\n\n- KillProcess\n\n- CheckIfProcessIsRunning\n\n- CheckIfTaskIsRunning\n\n- RunKeyLogger\n\n- CreateFolder\n\n- RenameFolder\n\n- DeleteFolder\n\n- UpdateBot\n\n- RenameFile\n\n- ArchiveAndSplit\n\n- StartAudioCapture\n\n- StopAudioCapture\n\n- SetMicVolume.\n\nMost of the commands are implemented in the main payload, though several commands and additional\n\nfunctionality are implemented via optional components that attackers upload to the victim’s machine.\n\nKnown optional components include:\n\n- Audio recorder\n\n- Keylogger\n\n- Password stealer\n\n- USB file stealer\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Audio recorder (AudioManager)\n\nThis is a full-featured component of Vermin that can record audio from the microphone on the victim’s\n\ncomputer. It implements three of Vermin’s commands: StartAudioCapture, StopAudioCapture and\n\nSetMicVolume. Captured data is compressed using Speex codecs and uploaded in SOAP format to\n\nVermin’s C&C servers.\n\n##### Keylogger (KeyboardHookLib)\n\nVermin’s keylogger is a simple standalone executable that sets global keyboard hooks and writes all\n\nkeystrokes into a file in an encrypted form. It also logs clipboard contents and active window titles. The\n\nkeylogger cannot connect to Vermin’s C&C servers by itself – the main backdoor component is used to\n\ntransfer collected information to the attackers’ servers.\n\nThe PDB path in the keylogger component confirms its association with the Vermin malware:\n```\nZ:\\Projects\\Vermin\\KeyboardHookLib\\obj\\Release\\AdobePrintLib.pdb\n\n##### Password stealer (PwdFetcher)\n\n```\nVermin’s standalone password stealer is used to extract saved passwords from browsers (Chrome,\n\n[Opera). The majority of its code appears to be copy-pasted from an article on the Russian forum](https://habr.com/post/134982/)\n\nHabrahabr. Some samples also contain code for extracting information from the Firefox browser,\n\nhowever, it appears to be unused. As seen in Figure 14, this component also contains PDB paths similar\n\nto that seen in the keylogger component, confirming its association with the Vermin malware.\n\nFigure 14 // Compilation artifacts linking the password stealer to the Vermin malware.\n\n##### USB file stealer (UsbGuard)\n\nUsbGuard.exe is an optional component used by both Sobaken and Vermin. It is a small, standalone\n\nprogram that monitors USB drives connected to the computer and copies all files that match the filter\n\nchosen by the attackers. The stolen files were later exfiltrated using the main backdoor module. Many\n\nand various PDB paths clearly linking them to Vermin are found in samples of this component.\n\nSince April 2018, the file stealer has been used as a standalone tool. It copies files and immediately\n\nuploads them to a server controlled by the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the analyzed samples, attackers were after files with the following extensions:\n\n- .doc\n\n- .docx\n\n- .xls\n\n- .xlsx\n\n- .zip\n\n- .rar\n\n- .7z\n\n- .docm\n\n- .txt\n\n- .rtf\n\n- .xlsm\n\n- .pdf\n\n- .jpg\n\n- .jpeg\n\n- .tif\n\n- .odt\n\n- .ods\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nAmong the many different malware attacks targeted at high value assets in Ukraine, these attackers\n\nhaven’t received much public attention – perhaps because of their initial use of open-source-based\n\nmalware before developing their own strain (Vermin).\n\nEmploying multiple malware families, as well as various infection mechanisms – including common\n\nsocial engineering techniques but also not-so-common steganography – over the past three years,\n\ncould be explained by the attackers simply experimenting with various techniques and malware, or it\n\nmay suggest operations by multiple subgroups.\n\nThe fact that the attackers successfully used relatively trivial techniques, such as sending RAR and EXE\n\nfiles by email (a bad practice, which still takes place among users) highlights the importance of securing\n\nthe human factor in computer network protection.\n\n### IOCs\n\n#### C&Cs\n\n##### Sobaken C&C\n\n- akamaicdn.ru\n\n- akamainet021.info\n\n- cdnakamai.ru\n\n-
