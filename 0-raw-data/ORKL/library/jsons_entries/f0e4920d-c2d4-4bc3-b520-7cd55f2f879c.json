    "plain_text": "# Who is Mr. Zhao?\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/05/13/who-is-mr-zhao/](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/05/13/who-is-mr-zhao/)**\n\nintrusiontruth May 13, 2021\n\nIn our last article, we identified a number of front companies used by two Chengdu-based\nindicted hackers Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi.\n\nWhat struck us when reading the US indictment was reference to the Guangdong State\nSecurity Department (GSSD). As eager readers of Intrusion Truth will note, we discussed the\nGuangdong SSD in our very first article series and their use of Boysec as a front company.\nHowever we didn’t manage to identify the MSS officers behind APT3. We feel there is\nunfinished business here and so we set to work to uncover MSS Officer 1.\n\nWe started with an address.\n\n## GSSD HQ\n\nWhy is the Guangdong Province International Affairs Research Centre (GPIARC)\ninteresting? Well, its claim to fame most recently comes from the 2020 indictment, revealing\nit as a GSSD cover company. The address: Number 5, 6 Crossroad, Upper Nonglin Road,th\nYuexiu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province (越秀区农林上路六横道5号).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe decided to reach out to our network of contributors, asking about the GPIARC and any\nprevious reference to this company or their known address. We received an interesting\nresponse from a trusted source who wishes to remain anonymous. This source, with\n\n\n-----\n\nconnections to the Bank of China, was able to provide a number of historic credit card\nstatement sent to the cover address at Upper Nonglin Road. One bank statement in\nparticular stood out.\n\n## Zhao Jianfei (赵剑飞)\n\nOn the top left corner on the image below, the corresponding address is Unit 5, 6th\nCrossroad, Upper Nonglin Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou. Furthermore, all the\ntransactions appear in Guangzhou, Guangdong.\n\nWe know this address is a cover for the GSSD. So, whoever is using this address works\ndirectly for the GSSD. So, who is this MSS officer?\n\nUnderneath the address is a single name to which the statement is addressed to: Zhao\nJianfei (赵剑飞).\n\n\n-----\n\nInteresting. So, we know Zhao was receiving correspondence about a credit card bill, using\nthe GSSD cover company as the address. It stands to reason that Zhao Jianfei is an MSS\nofficer, working for the Guangdong SSD. Could he be MSS Officer 1?\n\n## Asls1027\n\nAn FBI flash memo released on the 21 July reveals further information pertaining to thest\nemail used by MSS Officer 1 to send Li and Dong zero-day exploits for use in their APT\ncampaign. The memo has redacted the mail provider, but the handle is the bit we need:\nasls1027.\n\n\n-----\n\nRemember when we said one statement in particular from the Bank of China was interesting\nto us?\n\nWell, turns out that Bank of China sent the credit card statement to the personal email of\nZhao Jianfei.\n\nThe email address was asls1027@hotmail.com.\n\nZhao Jianfei is an MSS officer, working for the GSSD and receiving credit card statements to\nthe address of a GSSD cover company. Furthermore, this correspondence was sent to his\npersonal email; the same email account that sent cyber actors a zero-day exploit for use in\ntheir illegal activities.\n\nZhao Jianfei has been directing Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi by providing them with malware\nand supporting their APT campaign.\n\n## Asls1027’s social media\n\nAs we know, humans are biased and often rely on availability heuristics: we tend to choose\nthe least cognitively demanding option. As such, we tend to reuse email handles, passwords\nand so on. And it appears our Mr. Zhao falls into this category, reusing his handle across\nmultiple social media sites.\n\nAsls1027 has an interest in cars, posting on the car forum autohome.com.cn.\n\nHe also maintains a relatively empty yet bizarre Twitter profile.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever none of this provided us with any more information on Zhao Jianfei himself. We\nknow he uses the asls handle and his name is Zhao Jianfei so we decided to get even more\ncreative, and found an interesting profile on Facebook with the stub Asls Zh.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nGiven the unique of the handle asls, we strongly believe this profile belongs to our Mr. Zhao.\nThe profile picture was updated in 2014, a similar timeframe to other asls social media posts,\nas well as Zhao’s credit card activity in Guangdong. Zh = Zhao.\n\nIt seems Zhao was born in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province. Also note Asls Zh’s current residence –\nGuangzhou, in Guangdong Province. The same location as the Zhao Jianfei’s credit\nstatement.\n\nAsls Zh went to the PLA Information Engineering University to study Computer Science. It\nfits with what we know about MSS Officer 1, and his ability to deploy zero-day exploits to\nsupport criminal hackers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Zhao Jianfei is MSS Officer 1.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**He grew up in Shanxi, and attended a PLA university studying computer science. He**\n**now resides in Guangdong and has been working for the GSSD from at least 2013. An**\n**email account linked to his GSSD activity was also used to send Li and Dong malware**\n**to advance their APT campaign.**\n\n**Contract hackers – check.**\n\n**Front companies – check.**\n\n**MSS officer working to the Guangdong State Security Department – check.**\n\n\n-----",
