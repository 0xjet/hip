It shares some similarities_\n_with other families of ransomware, but Sophos believes at this time that it is not related to_\n_them. Conti has undergone rapid development since its discovery and is known for the_\n_speed at which it encrypts and deploys across a target system. Conti is a human-operated_\n_“double extortion” ransomware that steals and threatens to expose information as well as_\n_encrypting it. The Conti News site has published data stolen from at least 180 victims thus_\n_far._\n\n_Editor’s note: This is one of a series of articles focused on the Conti ransomware family,_\n_which also includes technical details of Conti ransomware, Conti Ransomware: Evasive By_\n_[Nature and a detailed analysis of a Conti attack, A Conti Ransomware Attack Day-By-Day.](https://news.sophos.com/conti-ransomware-attack-day-by-day/)_\n\nImagine the scene: you’re an IT admin and you turn up for work on a Monday morning to find\nyour IT systems are down and no-one can access or run anything. On your computer screen\nthere is a message telling you that your systems and data have been encrypted with Conti\nransomware and you need to pay a ransom for the attackers to decrypt compromised files\nand delete stolen information.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick the image to enlarge it\n\n## What to do immediately: contain and neutralize\n\n**The first thing you need to do is determine whether the attack is still underway. If you**\nsuspect it is, and you don’t have the tools in place to stop it, determine which devices have\nbeen impacted and isolate them immediately. The easiest option is to simply unplug the\nnetwork cable or turn off the Wi-Fi adapter. If the damage is more widespread than a few\ndevices, consider doing this at the switch level and taking entire network segments offline\ninstead of individual devices. Only shut down devices if you can’t disconnect the network.\n\n**Second, you need to assess the damage. Which endpoints, servers and operating**\nsystems were affected, what has been lost? Are your backups still intact or has the attacker\ndeleted them? If they are intact, make an offline copy immediately. Also, which machines\nwere protected? They’ll be critical in getting you back on your feet.\n\n**Last, but definitely not least: you’ll want to talk to people about what’s happening, but**\n**the attackers may be eavesdropping so don’t use your normal channels of**\n**communication. If the intruders have been in your network for a while, they’ll probably have**\naccess to email, for instance.\n\n## What to do next: investigate\n\nOnce you have managed to contain and neutralize the attack, take time to investigate what\nhappened so you can reduce the likelihood of it happening again. If you don’t feel confident\nabout doing this yourself, there is specialist incident response and threat hunting help\n[available 24/7 from security vendors, including Sophos.](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/managed-threat-response/rapid-response.aspx)\n\nAccording to the [Sophos Rapid Response team, this is what you need to expect from Conti](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/managed-threat-response/rapid-response.aspx)\nransomware activity on your network:\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. The attackers have most likely been on your network for a few days or even weeks.**\n\nConti ransomware is operated by humans. They take time to prepare in order to ensure\nmaximum disruption because this enables them to charge higher ransoms.\n\n**2. The attackers could use a variety of different methods to break in your network.**\n\nPossible initial access methods for Conti ransomware include, but are not limited to\nvulnerable firewalls, exposed RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) services, and phishing user\n[credentials via spam emails. Sites like Shodan.io provide insight into what an attacker could](https://www.shodan.io/)\nfind out about your network; try using it to search your external IP addresses.\n\n**3. They will have secured access to domain admin accounts as well as other user**\n**accounts.**\n\nAttackers typically compromise multiple accounts during an attack. Their main goal is to get\naccess to domain admin accounts that can be used to launch the ransomware. However,\nthey also target specific admin accounts that have access to sensitive data, backup systems,\nand security management consoles.\n\nConti attackers often use tools like Mimikatz, which can capture information from a running\nMicrosoft LSASS.exe process that contains usernames/password hashes of currently logged\non users. Sometimes attackers will leave this running and then deliberately break something\non the machine that they’ve targeted, provoking an admin to log in to fix it. Attackers can\nthen capture this admin’s credentials.\n\nIf Mimikatz is blocked by security software, the attackers may instead use something like\nMicrosoft Process Monitor to do a memory dump of LSASS.exe and take that dump file back\nto their machine to extract the information with Mimikatz. With Mimikatz, it doesn’t matter\nhow long or complex the passwords are because it is takes them straight out of memory.\n\n**4. They will have scanned your network. They know how many servers and endpoints**\n**you have and where you keep your backups, business-critical data and applications.**\n\nOne of the first things attackers will do when they get onto a network is identify what access\nthey have on the local machine. The next step is to find out what remote machines exist and\nif they can access them.\n\nAttackers use legitimate network scanners like “Advanced Port Scanner” and “Angry IP\nScanner” due to their effectiveness and the fact that they are unlikely to be blocked. These\nscanners will generate a list of IPs and machine names. This makes it easy for attackers to\nfocus on critical infrastructure as most organizations helpfully give their servers descriptive\nnames, for example NY-DC1 for the New York Domain Controller, or maybe even simpler\nnames like “FileServer01,” “Backup_Server,” etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n**5. The attackers are likely to have downloaded and installed backdoors that allow**\n**them to come and go on your network and install additional tools.**\n\nThey’ll have set up folders and directories to collect and store stolen information and\nchannels for communicating with the attackers and for moving information out of your\nnetwork.\n\nThe backdoors come in a variety of forms. Some just communicate back to the attackers’ IP\naddress, allowing them to send and receive commands to the machine.\n\nMany backdoors are classified as legitimate applications. For example, the attackers might\nuse Remote Administration tools such as RDP to maintain access. Even if RDP is disabled\nby default, it is very easy for an attacker with admin access to the machine to re-enable it.\n\nAnother common legitimate tool used is AnyDesk. This offers attackers direct control of the\nmachine, including control over the mouse/keyboard and the ability to see the screen.\n\nOr they could use more advanced tools such as Cobalt Strike, a legitimate post-exploitation\npen-testing tool. Attackers will often try and establish a Cobalt Strike “beacon.” This allows\nregular communication back to the Cobalt Strike server and gives attackers complete control\nof the machine. It can also be used to easily deploy further beacons on other machines\ninside the network.\n\nSome attackers, including Conti, also set up Tor proxies so they can send command-andcontrol traffic over the Tor network. Such activity is often very hard to spot.\n\n**6. In addition to the encryption of data and disruption to software and operations,**\n**Conti operators will try to exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of corporate data prior to**\n**the main ransomware event.**\n\nTargets are threatened with the risk of their data being published on a so-called “leak site” for\nanybody to download, unless they pay the ransom. Some of the more valuable data is often\nsold to other attackers to use in further attacks.\n\nOnce a file server is identified, attackers often use a tool called “Everything” that enables\nvery fast file searching for keywords, for example “account,” “confidential,” “Social Security\nnumber.” After they identify the data, there are numerous methods the attackers can use to\nsteal it.\n\nFor example, they could simply login to an online email service and email it somewhere or\nuse a cloud storage provider like DropBox. Alternatively, they could install an FTP Client like\nFileZilla or Total Commander FTP and upload the data to their server.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the largest exfiltrations are done in a more automated way. For example, they might\nuse a tool like RClone. This is a command line tool that connects to a wide variety of cloud\nstorage providers. A commonly used one is MEGA as it offers extra levels of anonymity that\nattackers like. A few simple commands to RClone are all attackers need to exfiltrate entire\ndirectories to MEGA.\n\n**7. They will have tried to encrypt, delete, reset or uninstall your backups.**\n\nUnless your backups are stored offline, they are within reach of the attackers. A “backup”\nthat is online and available all the time is just a second copy of the files waiting to be\nencrypted.\n\n**8. The attackers will have tried to identify what security solution is used on the**\n**network and whether they can disable it.**\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good your protection is if the attacker can turn it off.\n\nFree default tools, such as Windows Defender, can be disabled instantly by anyone with\nadmin rights. Most modern ransomware attempts to do this by default.\n\nAttackers also try to find and gain access to the management consoles of more advanced\nsecurity solutions in order to disable all protection just before they launch the ransomware.\n\nSecurity management consoles hosted locally are especially at risk as attackers could\naccess them with the accounts they have already compromised.\n\n**9. The most visible part of the attack – the release of ransomware – probably took**\n**place when no IT admins or security professionals were online to notice and prevent the**\nlengthy process of file encryption, possibly during the middle of the night or during the\nweekend.\n\n_Note: The encryption process takes hours. An encrypted Windows endpoint will have tens or_\n_hundreds of thousands of encrypted files by the time the ransomware is done. For large_\n_fileservers this could run into the millions. This is why most targeted ransomware attacks are_\n_launched in the middle of the night, over a weekend or on a holiday, when fewer people are_\n_watching._\n\nUp to this point, the attackers have been trying to stay hidden, but here their tactics change.\nThey want you to know they are there and what they have done. They want you to see how\nmuch data has been lost and to understand that someone has done this maliciously and now\nthey want a payment to decrypt the data.\n\nThis is why, in almost all ransomware attacks, encrypted files will have had a new extension\nname appended to the end of the file. For example, “MyReport.docx” might become\n“MyReport.docx.encrypted.” The ransom notes are often displayed prominently in multiple\n\n\n-----\n\nplaces, adding to the chaos and stress.\n\n**10. The ransomware will have been deployed to all your endpoints and any servers**\n**that were online at the time of attack – providing that is what the attacker wanted.**\n\nRansomware is “deployed” like a normal application; in most attacks it doesn’t spread\nrandomly in all directions. If your servers were encrypted but not your endpoints, that is\nbecause the attacker chose to only target your servers.\n\nThe ransomware can be deployed in a variety of ways. One of the most common way\nSophos experts see is a combination of batch scripts and the Microsoft PsExec tool, which is\na great tool for executing commands on remote machines. An attacker might create a batch\nscript that loops through a list of your IP addresses, using PsExec to copy the ransomware to\neach machine and then execute it.\n\nWhile most security solutions (including Sophos’) block PsExec by default, admins often\nauthorize its use on their network because they find it useful too – and unfortunately the\nattackers know this.\n\nAttackers could also create or edit an existing Group Policy Object (GPO) logon script. If you\nfail to spot this, the attack could relaunch every time a machine boots up and connects to the\ndomain. This makes it seem like the ransomware is “spreading” when it is just caused by the\nGPO.\n\n**11. The launch of the ransomware is not the end.**\n\nUsing the backdoors they set up during the preparation stage, the attackers will often\ncontinue to monitor the situation and even your email communications to see how you\nrespond. An email to the CEO stating you will be OK because they didn’t encrypt the\nbackups on Server X, could be a disaster if the attacker read it and still had access to that\nserver.\n\nThe attacker may also wait until you recover to then launch a second attack to really\nemphasize that they can keep doing this until you pay.\n\n**12. The time spent in your network will likely have allowed the attackers to steal**\n**business critical, sensitive and confidential information that they now threaten to**\n**publicly expose.**\n\nSome attackers also apply emotional pressures, with direct employee appeals and threats\nover email and phone.\n\nMost attackers will start publishing stolen data anywhere from a few days to a week after the\nmain attack if no contact from the target is received or negotiations breakdown. However, it\ncould be several weeks or even longer before anything gets published.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther, while the attackers may promise to delete your information if you pay, you have no\nguarantees that they will.\n\nClick the image to enlarge it\n\n## What defenders can do\n\nThere are some proactive steps you can take to enhance your IT security for the future,\nincluding:\n\nMonitor your network security 24/7 and be aware of the five early indicators an attacker\nis present to stop ransomware attacks before they launch\nShut down internet-facing remote desktop protocol (RDP) to deny cybercriminals\naccess to networks.

It can be tempting to clear the\nimmediate threat and close the book on the incident, but the truth is that in doing so you are\nunlikely to have eliminated all traces of the attack. It is important that you take time to identify\nhow the attackers got in, learn from any mistakes and make improvements to your security. If\nyou don’t, you run the risk that the same attacker or another one might come and do this to\nyou again next week.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional resources\n\nTechnical information on Conti ransomware as well as a day-by-day analysis of a Conti\nattack, including indicators of compromise (IoCs) and tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs) can be found in A Conti Ransomware Attack Day-By-Day and Conti\nRansomware: Evasive By Nature.\n[To help stop ransomware attacks, read the five early indicators an attacker is present](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/04/the-realities-of-ransomware-five-signs-youre-about-to-be-attacked)\n[Learn more about Sophos’ Rapid Response service that contains, neutralizes and](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/managed-threat-response/rapid-response.aspx)\ninvestigates attacks 24/7\nThe four top tips for [responding to a security incident from Sophos Rapid Response](https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/security-news-trends/whitepapers/four-key-tips-from-incident-response-experts.aspx)\nand the Managed Threat Response Team\nLearn how ransomware affects IT teams in Sophos’ global survey report,\n[Cybersecurity: The Human Challenge](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/content/cybersecurity-the-human-challenge.aspx)\n\n\n-----",
