The report draws on the comprehensive\ninformation about IT threats, attack vectors and\nvulnerabilities, as well as specific IT attacks, which\nis collected and evaluated every day by the Federal\nOffice for Information Security (Bundesamt für\nSicherheit in der Informationstechnik – BSI).\n\n\n###### The threat situation to which IT is currently\nexposed remains critical given the attack potential\nreported below. The most widely used IT systems\ncontain large numbers of vulnerabilities, and the\nexisting tools for exploiting these vulnerabilities\nare available to ever more attackers, who are only\n###### too willing to use them for their own purposes\nunder the cloak of anonymity provided by global\n###### cyberspace. These attacks have many different\nmotives. Their targets include ordinary citizens,\ngovernment bodies, research institutes, business\nenterprises and also the operators of critical infrastructure in Germany.\n\nUnquestionably globalisation, driven forward at\nan ever increasing rate by information technology, has exacerbated competition for resources,\nmarkets and political influence. It would be naïve\nto assume that newly created digitally interconnected technologies will not also be exploited in\nthe furtherance of disputes in economic, social\nand political arenas. Indeed, it can be seen that\nbusinesses and administrative bodies are increas###### ingly falling victim to highly skilled IT attacks\nwhich are executed with great professionalism\nand can draw on ample resources. Such attacks\n###### are usually hard to detect and defend against. Frequently a worrying time window opens up\nbetween attack and detection thereof, during\nwhich the successful attacker enjoys unhindered,\nunobserved access to the IT systems concerned.\n\n\nnomic growth, while on the other hand opening\nup new vulnerabilities to IT attacks which cannot\nbe adequately addressed using conventional IT\n###### security tools. Accordingly, IT innovation must\ngo hand in hand with the evolution of security\nmechanisms designed to ensure that defenders\n###### succeed in keeping pace with the technology\nemployed by their attackers.\n\n###### Successful IT security demands independent\ninitiative and skill. The activities of foreign intel###### ligence agencies uncovered in 2013, as well as\nmillions or even billions of cases of identity theft,\nhave led to a crisis of confidence in the Internet.\nAlthough awareness of this issue has increased\ngreatly, both private and professional users ever\n###### more frequently feel powerless against these\nseemingly overwhelming threats. This sometimes\nleads to a mood of resignation and failure to make\nfull use of the effective security measures which\nare available and which do afford an impressive\nlevel of protection against up to 95 per cent of all\nattacks. As a result, potentials remain untapped,\nthus unnecessarily exacerbating the IT security\nsituation.\n\n\nInformation technology innovation proceeds at\na breakneck pace. Due to the enormous economic\npotential involved, this innovation drives corres###### pondingly rapid changes in the IT landscape in\nevery industrial sector and social sphere. Cloud\ncomputing, mobile systems and the opportunity\nto evaluate information using Big Data fuel eco\n\n###### This threatens to create a vicious circle of selffulfilling negative prophesies which needs to be\n###### broken. The standardisation, certification and\ntransparency of key functions are vital to restoring and building up users’ confidence in IT secur###### ity. Germany has a broad, highly skilled techno- logical base in this respect, with an IT security\nindustry dominated by SMEs. The challenge is to\neffectively exploit this favourable situation to the\nbenefit of the German economy in the face of the\nimpending digitalisation of every aspect of our\neveryday and business lives and to create a positive climate for IT security measures. IT security\n###### may come at a price but it is bound also to be\nrewarded in the marketplace.\n\nWhat I would like to see is for business and government to redouble their efforts to promote widerranging security technologies and encourage their\nuse. To this end the federal government is fostering the dissemination of basic security infrastruc###### ture through such measures as Internet identity\nverification based on the new identity card, De-Mail\n\n\n-----\n\n###### and the smart meter profile. We are encouraged by the various forward-looking enterprises who\nhave built on these measures to implement smart\nand creative solutions and augment applications\n###### with scalable IT security in order to vigorously combat the IT risks faced by a digitalised world.\n\n Meanwhile, the envisaged IT security law will\nform a further tool in providing better protection\nfor vital IT infrastructure. The BSI’s character as a\ncivil, technical-preventive agency has proven its\nworth over the past 20 years, and because of this\nits role in our cyber security architecture is to be\nfurther reinforced. As a trusted expert body the\nBSI will perform an advisory and accrediting IT\nsecur ity function in the field of critical infrastruc###### ture. To speed up response times, exchanges of\ninformation on threats and attacks on IT systems\n###### are also being intensified. It will only be possible to ensure that reliable and appropriate security\nmeasures for information technology in Germany\nare in place if a cooperative working relationship\nand partnership between business and the government can be guaranteed. The BSI faces correspond###### ing challenges both for its professional expertise\nand its role as a coordinating body working with the\n###### various other federal and state security agencies.\n\n\n**Dr. Thomas de Maizière**\nFederal Minister of the Interior\n\n\nI am convinced that the BSI’s robust organisational\n###### structure will enable us to create an improved\nsecurity situation despite the ever-growing threats\nemanating from cyberspace.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1 Information technology: interconnected, complex, pervasive\n\n#### Information technology: interconnected, complex, pervasive\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1 Information technology: interconnected, complex, pervasive\n\n\nDigitalisation features three central characteristics\nfrom which the challenges facing information and\ncyber security derive:\n\n\n## 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n\nTechnological permeation and interconnection: all physical systems are embraced\nby IT and connected step by step with the\nInternet.\n\nComplexity: the complexity of IT increases\nsignificantly as a result of vertical and horizontal integration into the wealth creation\nprocesses.\n\nPervasiveness: every system is available\npractically all the time and in any place via\nthe Internet.\n\n\n###### Technological permeation and interconnection\n\nThe information technology of today is characterised by its powerful, value-adding capacity for inte###### gration into virtually any technological system,\nthereby driving the continuing digitalisation of\nthe world we live in. Attractive features and prices\n###### help develop a market for private users, while\nmobile solutions and applications on intuitive end\n###### devices also open up promising development\nopportunities in the professional sphere. The rapid\n###### adaptation of such solutions in business and\nindustry means that the boundaries between the\nprivate and professional use of IT disappear. This\nalso leads indirectly to the traditionally strictly\nsegregated IT networks operated by companies\nbecoming ever more open to the Internet. This\napplies not only to office communication but also\nto manufacture and production.\n\n\nmarketing, sales and purchasing. Along the value\n###### chain too the ongoing interconnection of IT systems with supplies, customers and service\npartners will be fostered. This trend will continue\n###### to shape technological development within companies, with some 11 billion euros of Industry 4.0-related investment expected in Germany\nbetween now and 2020[1]. No business will be able\nto opt out of this trend, because the efficiency and\nproductivity gains achievable through Industry\n4.0 will have to be harvested if the business wishes\nto remain competitive.\n\nA consequence of this rapidly progressing digitalisation and interconnection is that the protection\n###### of IT networks and IT systems at a company’s\nperimeter is becoming ever more eroded and new\nattack interfaces are opening up. In addition, IT\nsystems hitherto unreachable from the Internet\n###### are becoming potential targets. For IT security this entails a far more complex risk situation, as\nwell as holding out the prospect of an increasing\nrisk of existence-threatening situations due to the\nbreakdown or malfunctioning of production or\nbusiness processes.\n\n###### IT complexity\n\n\nThe interconnection of all systems and things,\ncreating an Internet of things, coupled with the\ndigitalisation of physical systems (cyber-physical\nsystems) greatly increases the complexity of the\n###### digital infrastructure. Today many household\nappliances, building control systems, threat and\nfire alarm systems, traffic systems and automo###### biles are interconnected and linked with the Internet. A trend now foreseeable for the near\nfuture is the emergence of the digitally enhanced\nsmart city.\n\nAs the complexity of systems increases, familiar\n###### conventional IT security mechanisms rapidly\nreach their limits and become incapable of guar###### anteeing the accustomed degree of reliability and manageability. The need for innovative\napproaches designed to ensure an adequate level\n###### of IT security for the entire system is already\napparent, and it will only increase over the coming years.\n\n\n###### How far this wide-ranging interconnection of\ndifferent systems extends may be illustrated by\ntaking a look at the factory of the future, which\ngoes by the name of ‘Industry 4.0’. With the object ###### ive of making as much information as possible\ndigitally useable, the entire company’s digitally\n###### enabled systems are networked with each other both internally and externally: the machines,\nsensors and field devices in the production facilities, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Pervasiveness through smartphones\n\nInnovation and change are inextric ably linked\nwith modern information technology. However,\neven in the IT industry the extent of the smartphone boom is unrivalled, having been sustained\n###### over a period of many years. Smartphone and tablet users now number in the billions, as the devices exert a huge influence over the daily\nlives of their owners. The smartphone is not just\na wireless extension of established PC technology,\nrather it involves the bundling of a whole array\nof technological and conceptual considerations\n###### which, taken together, delineate a new, self- contained sphere of information technology.\nOur existing IT security knowledge and techniques are not directly transferable to this sphere\nand will have to be rethought and adapted.\n\n\nA standout feature of smartphones is that they\n###### are always on, with a continuous broadband\nInternet connection and incessant device activity\neven without any intervention by the user. Furthermore, most smartphones are taken by their\nusers wherever they go and provide a detailed\nrecord of their whereabouts and the communications they engage in. In future the smartphone\nwill evolve into an electronic wallet with which\npeople will be able to make payments both over\n###### the Internet and directly at the checkout via\na radio link, and then, if not before, we shall have\nto address the question of the actual effectiveness\nof the security systems with which this mobile\nplatform is equipped. As a rule smartphone users\nare reliant upon the operating system’s security\nmechanisms cutting in. There is little scope left\nfor users to take individual action to strengthen\nsecurity, such action being largely confined to the\nsecure configuration of the devices.\n\n\nNot only the device itself but also the ‘economic\nsystem’ to which a smartphone is assigned play\n###### a central role in its IT security. This overall economic system comprises not only its operating\nsystem but also an array of background systems\n###### such as the app store, content download platforms and cloud-based backup systems offered\nby that provider. The self-contained nature and\ncentral management of this ‘ecosystem’ do offer\na degree of basic security that cannot be achieved\nin the traditionally open world of the PC without\n###### additional protective mechanisms, but it is not\ntransparent for users, and there is no provision for\n###### scalability where security needs may be greater. As a key component in the system’s overall economy, security thus forms the foundation for the\nbundled marketing of goods and services and is\ntherefore a principal objective for providers.\n\nAmong the factors driving the success of smartphones as a product category, the app takes pride\n###### of place. It represents the true quantum leap,\nbecause it means that acquiring a smartphone\nopens up for users access to millions of application programs via online marketplaces such as\nthe Apple App Store, Google Play or the Microsoft\nWindows Phone Store.\n\n\n###### Furthermore, smartphones not only facilitate the\nacquisition of software but also lower the bar for\nthose wishing to take the plunge and become software producers to such an extent that over one\nhundred thousand providers are now represented\non the various online marketplaces. To add to data\nprivacy law considerations, apps pose the greatest\npotential for attack from an IT security viewpoint.\n###### The operating systems themselves are comparatively well protected, whereas what apps can do in\nthe operating system is authorised by the users\nthemselves. However, this kind of authorisation\nprocedure is largely ineffective since in the great\nmajority of cases requests are accepted by users\nwithout giving the matter any thought.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Pervasiveness via clouds\n\nCloud services provide processing and storage of\ninformation centrally via a network plus standardised interfaces. They outsource applications,\n###### computing power and storage from (mobile)\ndevices to cloud data centres. The key benefits of\ncloud services are that often complex functions\nare offered in a recylable way by a central agency,\nmanaging the services is easier and can readily\nbe scaled, while computing power is outsourced\nfrom the device to the data centre. Taken together\n###### these considerations can generate significant\neconomic benefits.\n\n\n###### Smartphones, tablets and apps now offer a variety\nof different interfaces with the cloud services\noffered by the various mobile systems and thirdparty providers. These services also allow such\nthings as the synchronisation of contacts, appointments, e-mails, photos and documents on different devices. This means that some of the information stored and processed in the cloud is highly\n###### personal. However, there is no certainty that the data stored are both secure from unauthorised access and will be permanently accessible. As a\nrule cloud service providers’ general terms and\nconditions largely disclaim liability for the data\nentrusted to them.\n\n###### Accordingly, before a business chooses to use\ncloud services those in charge first need to address\n###### various questions. For instance, what information is suitable for cloud processing and storage,\n###### and whether this is permissible given compliance requirements, in particular concerning data\nprivacy. More and more cloud service providers\nare setting up shop in this booming market and\n###### it is not easy to identify a trustworthy provider\nwho complies with the company’s own security\n###### requirements. The opportunity to benefit from\neconomies of scale must than be set against a loss\nof control over the company’s own information.\n\n\n###### Outlook\n\n For many private users the smartphone has\nbecome the linchpin of their access to worldwide\ninformation and services. The future integration\nof payment and health functions as well as home\nautomation interfaces means that the boundary\n###### between the physical and virtual worlds will\nbecome increasingly blurred. As a result issues\nsurrounding the security of mobile devices and\n###### their commercial ecosystem will become ever\nmore relevant.\n\nIn a business context, from an IT security viewpoint issues other than mobility also have to be\ntaken into account. The use of cloud-based information processing holds the promise of speed\ngains and cost savings, but is still often viewed\nwith suspicion on organisational, tech nical and\n###### security-related grounds. Furthermore, companies using industrial control and automation\ntechnology are impacted by the convergence of\n###### this technology with classical information and\ncommunication technology, including mobile\n###### use, and this throws up a whole new raft of IT\nsecurity challenges.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2 Security threats\n\n#### Security threats\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2 Security threats\n\nThe increasing digitalisation and interconnection\nof many aspects of our private and working lives\ngoes hand in hand with dynamic security threats.\n###### The causes of cyber attacks, attack methods and\nthe use of attack tools evolve on a daily basis, all\nthe while interacting and influencing each other in\ncomplex ways.\n\n###### 2.1 Causes\n\nCyber attacks targets companies, governments\nand private users are a daily occurrence. Many\nattacks are successful, both because the attackers\n###### are becoming increasingly professional and because they encounter circumstances which they know how to exploit to their advantage.\n\n 2.1.1 The Internet as a platform for attacks\n\n The Internet is used as a platform of attack on\naccount of its open structure, as well as the technical opportunities and anonymity it offers. This\n###### is reflected today in the huge number of cyber\nattacks. To launch a successful cyber attack all you\ngenerally need are a PC and an Internet connection. These modest investments can be set against\n###### a multitude of opportunities to make money\nthrough criminal activities, to acquire confidential\ninformation or to engage in acts of sabotage. The\nnecessary attack tools and methods are cheap and\neasy to acquire. There is a thriving global market\non which attack tools, vulnerabilities, malware or\neven website traffic can be purchased or ordered\nas a service (malware as a service). Illegally acquired\ndata such as user account details and credit card\ninformation are also traded there, with both wellorganised groups and individuals offering their\nskills and services on these criminal online marketplaces. The Internet’s attractiveness as a platform\nof attack may be illustrated by the following factors which attackers exploit for their own ends:\n\n\n∙  The increasing complexity of technology coupled\nwith a frequent lack of security awareness leads\nto inadequately protected systems, increasing the\nprospect of a successful cyber attack.\n\n∙  The careless exchanging of information over the\nInternet and the always-on status of mobile\nsystems facilitates access to sensitive information.\n\n∙ The decentralised, open structure of the Internet\ngives attackers a wide range of concealment opportunities which minimise the risk of discovery.\n\n∙  Varying legal frameworks in different countries\nmake criminal prosecution more dif cult.\n\n\nThe professionalisation and separation of roles in\nthe field of cybercriminality are steadily increasing. Thus the work involved in a cyber attack may\nbe divided up among different people or groups\n###### who specialise in certain tasks which they perform independently of each other. These groups\ninclude:\n\n∙  Hackers, who seek out new vulnerabilities in\nwidely used software products and offer them\nfor sale.\n\n∙  Developers who design and adapt malware or\ntools for the generation of malware which can\nthen exploit these vulnerabilities.\n\n∙  Attackers who use this malware to steal\ninformation.\n\n∙  Criminals who sell, exploit or make money from\nthe use of the stolen information.\n\n\nThus even inexperienced attackers with no technical expertise can carry out or arrange the carrying out of professional attacks on a chosen target\nwithout having to concern themselves with the\ntechnical details or the execution of the attack.\n\n\n∙ The increasing interconnection of information\ntechnology permits remote attacks from virtually\nanywhere in the world at any time and on ever\nmore targets. As a result attackers do not have to\ntake any direct risks at the scene of the crime.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.1.2 ‘Digital carelessness’\n\nIn the wake of media reports about the Snowden\nrevelations, cyber attacks on well-known companies\nand the associated loss of customer data, coupled\nwith incidents involving large-scale identity theft,\n###### many users have lost confidence in information\ntechnology. Consumers appear to be increasingly\naware of the issue of IT security. A study published\n###### by the German Institute for Trust and Security on the Internet (Deutsches Institut für Vertrauen\nund Sicherheit im Internet – DIVSI)[2] has confirmed\nthat the German public’s confidence in the Internet has significantly deteriorated. However, these\n###### concerns stand in contrast with the apparent\ncarelessness which continues to be observed, both\nin business and private IT use. Despite increased\n###### awareness [of security issues] and loss of confidence [in the Internet], there has only been a very\nslight increase in numbers taking practical steps\nto improve their security. For instance, the uptake\nof e-mail encryption remains very low[3]. Solutions\nare available, but they frequently do not meet user\nrequirements in terms of convenience, intuitiveness and ease of operation, and these factors are\noften decisive in determining whether or not such\nsolutions catch on.\n\n\nmeasures in place. Despite this, according to a survey conducted by the Alliance for Cyber Security\n(Allianz für Cyber-Sicherheit)[6] companies report\ngrowing threats from data theft attacks and targeted attacks by cybercriminals or government\nattackers. The main reason cited for attacks proving successful was software vulnerabilities. However, a patch management system was in place at\nonly three quarters of the companies surveyed.\n###### Over half of the surveyed companies admitted\nthat the measures currently in place to protect\nthemselves from cyber attacks are not sufficient\nand that additional measures are planned in the\nmedium term. It is disturbing that the majority of\nsurveyed companies assign less than five per cent\nof their total IT budgets to IT security measures.\n\nAlongside all these technical protective measures,\n###### user behaviour is another key factor for enhancing Internet security. The increasing complexity\nand mobility of information technology means it\nis ever more important for users, manufacturers\n###### and service providers alike to foreswear ‘digital carelessness’, address IT security issues promptly and conscientiously and convert their concerns\ninto practical action.\n\n###### 2.1.3 Vulnerabilities\n\n\n###### Where users have been duped through social\nengineering, it is once again convenience, or the\nprospect of an ostensible benefit, which induces\n###### them to disclose personal information or run\nmalware. Every day we are inundated by waves\nof professionally produced spam and attempts to\naccess personal data using fake websites, e-mails\nor texts. Often the spam fraudulently claims to\nbe from well-known companies or institutions\nin order to induce recipients to click on a link or\nfile attachment, thereby infecting their computers\nwith malware. In the field of mobile communication, too, convenience is the main criterion when\nusers install and run smartphone apps without\nconsidering the consequences. Furthermore, basic\n###### security measures such as effective patch management, whereby available security updates of\nprograms are downloaded as soon as possible, are\nstill often neglected.\n\nEven if people are aware of the threats they face\n###### they do not always take appropriate secur ity\nmeasures. This applies not only to private users\nbut also to many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus we find that the systems used\n###### by SMEs[4], like those of private individuals[5], frequently have insufficient protection to fight off\neven the simplest attacks. However, the level of\ndefensive and protective measures found in networks and associated infrastructure in Germany\nis very variable, with the networks of major enter###### prises generally having appropriate protect ive\n\n\nVulnerabilities are the basis for the development\n###### of cyber attack tools and the reason why cyber attacks can succeed. As in earlier years, in 2013\nand 2014 the number of critical vulnerabilities\n###### found in standard IT products remained high.\nIn 13 widely used software products alone (see\nTable 1) 705 critical vulnerabilities were identified\n###### in 2013, and in 2014 the BSI is expecting over\n700 more (Figure 1). Vulnerabilities are inevitable\nin modern software. Developing bug-free software is a practical impossibility outside of highly\nrestricted specialist areas. For this group of widely\n###### used products alone the detection of an average of two critical vulnerabilities per day can be\nexpected.\n\nGiven the sheer number of vulnerabilities manufacturers’ software updating systems are of great\nimportance. Manufacturers are increasingly forced\nto prioritise when eradicating vulnerabil ities,\nconcentrating on the critical ones.\n\n\nDetails of vulnerabilities generally do not emerge\n###### until after the software manufacturer releases the corresponding security update or patch.\nAccordingly it is vital to download these software\nupdates as quickly as possible. If details of the\nvulnerability, or even exploits of a given vulnerability, enter the public domain before the soft\n\n-----\n\nware manufacturer’s patch comes out (zero-day\nexploits), great care should be taken if using the\naffected software. Up to the end of July there had\nbeen five known incidents of this nature in 2014.\n\n**Software products**\n\n\n∙ Adobe Flash Player\n∙ Adobe Reader\n∙ Apple OS X\n∙ Apple Quicktime\n∙ Apple Safari\n∙ Google Chrome\n∙ Linux Kernel\n\n\n∙ Microsoft Internet Explorer\n∙ Microsoft Office\n∙ Microsoft Windows\n∙ Mozilla Firefox\n∙ Mozilla Thunderbird\n∙ Oracle Java/JRE\n\n\nTable 1: Selection of widely used software products\n\n###### 2.1.4 Using out-of-date software and unpatched systems\n\nDownloading software updates is fundamental\nto maintaining a secure IT system. Despite this,\n###### operating systems and applications with outof-date patches are the most common problem\n###### identified by BSI audits and penetration tests\nof government departments, and many private\nusers’ systems are not always fully up to date.\n\n###### Despite the standard recommendation to use\nauto-update mechanisms, according to IT experts\n###### at least ten per cent of all Windows operating\nsystems and other widely used software products\n###### in Germany have out-of-date patches[7], and this\nfigure should be regarded as a minimum.\n\n\n###### Unpatched systems are not only a problem for desktops, they also afflict servers and mobile\ndevices in a similar fashion. For instance, in February 2014 six million websites[8] worldwide were\nusing the outmoded, easy-to-attack Version 1.3\nof the Apache server software. Meanwhile, in the\n\n\nmobile sphere Android devices in particular are\nfrequently found to be running on outdated versions of operating system[9]. Many manufacturers\n###### of devices only provide their updates for brief\nperiods. Support for older versions is discontinued\n###### at the latest when the annual successor model\nappears. Once that happens patches are no longer\n###### produced for newly discovered vulnerabilities,\nwhich thus pose a threat to all older devices.\n\nAs a general rule, software products for which\nproduct support has been discontinued should\nno longer be run because these products have\n###### stopped receiving security updates. A recent\nexample is Microsoft Windows XP, for which\nextended product support ceased in April 2014,\nsince which time neither functional nor security\nupdates have been produced for Windows XP.\n###### Despite this, the market share of Windows XP\nin Germany by mid-2014 still stood at over eight\n###### per cent, while the worldwide figure is over 15 per cent[10].\n\nFigure 1: Total number of vulnerabilities in the listed software products\n\n- The figures for 2014 are estimates based on the number of vulnerabilities\n\ndetected up to September.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Typical security deficits**\n\nThe BSI conducts regular security checks, penetration tests\nand information security audits of government departments.\nAmong the security issues most frequently encountered are:\n\n» Out-of-date operating systems and application patches and\ndeactivation of available security mechanisms.\n» » Easy-to-guess passwords are used, even for critical applicaEasy-to-guess passwords are used, even for critical applications.

As a result sometimes very personal\ninformation is stored in a cloud, and if access to\nthe cloud is inadequately protected this information is at severe risk, as for instance demonstrated\nby a recent incident in which intimate photos\nof celebrities were stolen from the iCloud and\npublished on the Internet.\n\n\n###### 2.1.5 Mobile devices\n\n Classical desktop and laptop computers are increasingly being complemented or even replaced\nby smartphones and tablets. Mobile devices rep###### resent an attractive target for attacks because\nthey usually reflect the entire ‘digital lives’ of their\nowners, from e-mails to social media, flight tickets,\nbanking or location information. Alongside the\nrisks of loss or theft, they pose special IT security\nchallenges in terms of operating system updates\nand apps. Due to rapid developments in the hardware sphere software updates are often available\nonly for short periods, after which vulnerabilities\nare no longer be fixed. A further threat arises from\n###### the bewildering variety of available apps, which\nnot infrequently contain malicious and espionage\n###### features. Due to its open approach Android is\nparticularly susceptible to these.\n\n\n###### 2.1.6 Inadequate security for Industrial Control Systems\n\n Production and process automation systems,\ncollectively known as Industrial Control Systems\n(ICS), are deployed in virtually all infrastructure in\nwhich physical processes take place. Implementing\nIndustry 4.0, one trend is towards the extended\n###### interconnection of these Industrial Control Systems beyond a company’s internal networks.\n\n\n**Threats to mobile devices increasing steadily**\n\nReports from all producers of antivirus software indicate that\nthe amount of malware targeting mobile devices is steadily\nincreasing. In addition to established attack methods of the kind\ndirected at PCs, the ‘always on’ nature of mobile devices opens\nup further attack opportunities:\n\n**»** **Infection with malware via apps**\n\nAlongside their ostensibly useful features apps may also conAlongside their ostensibly useful features apps may also conceal malicious code.

However,\nfew of these systems were designed with potential\nattacks in mind.\n\n\n###### 2.2 Attack tools and methods\n\n Tools and methods used in cyber attacks today\nare manifold. They are deployed and combined\nin myriad ways to launch both broad-based and\nhighly targeted cyber attacks against individuals\nor institutions. This section discusses the attack\n###### methods in current use, outlines the current\nsituation and offers brief assessments of each\n###### method.\n\n 2.2.1 Spam\n\nSpam is defined as unwanted messages sent en\nmasse and in an untargeted fashion via e-mail\n###### or other communication services. In harmless\nvariants spam messages generally contain unsoli###### cited advertising. However, spam often comes\nwith attachments containing malware, links to\nwebsites with drive-by exploits, or it may be used\nfor phishing attacks. To send out spam messages\nlarge-scale resources such as botnets or compromised servers are required.\n\n\n**Threats to Industrial Control Systems in industry**\n**and manufacturing**\n\nProduction and process automation systems are increasingly\nsusceptible to cyber attack. Operators have to bear in mind the\nrisk and harmful potential not only of non-targeted malware\nbut also of targeted, high-quality attacks on ICS infrastructure\nwhich are mounted at significant expense.\n\nThe central threats to which ICSs are currently exposed areThe central threats to which ICSs are currently exposed are[11][11]:\n\nInfection of control components with malware via\noffice networks\n\n### 1\n\nInfiltration of malware via removable storage media\nand external hardware\n\n### 2\n 3 Social engineering\n\n\n### 4 Human error and sabotage\n 5 Unauthorized use of Remote Service Access\n\n\nAlongside attacks which succeed due to software\nimplementation errors, social engineering plays\nan ever greater role. In this method largely nontechnical contrivances are used to gain unauthorised access to information or IT systems, exploiting human proclivities such as helpfulness, curiosity, trust or fear. To combat this, measures such\nas raising awareness and training are further key\ncomponents of any effective ICS security system.\n\n###### Moreover, from this appraisal of the most sig- nificant threats facing Industrial Control Systems\nit is apparent that devising IT security systems,\narchitectures and standards will be key factors\ndetermining the success of efforts to implement\nand secure acceptance for Industry 4.0.\n\n\n**Situation**\n\n∙  2014 saw major growth of around 80 per cent as\ncompared with 2013, bucking the trend of recent\nyears in which spam volumes had stagnated (see\nFig. 2).\n\n∙  Germany is midway down the Top 10 in the global\nlist of spam senders.\n\n∙ 2014 saw a 36 per cent rise in e-mails with\nmalware in the attachments.\n\n∙  Since the beginning of 2014 a trend towards\nthe generation and sending of pseudorandom\nmalware variants has been observed.\n\n∙  Criminals increasingly send Office documents as\nattachments, with malware being downloaded via\nmacros in these documents.\n\n∙ Due to identity theft spam is increasingly sent via\ncompromised user accounts utilising established\ne-mail service providers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assessment**\n\nSpam is a long familiar phenomenon, and countermeasures such as spam filters or greylisting\n###### have generally reduced its volume. As a result,\nthese days spam is largely unproblematic from\nan operational viewpoint. However, the quality\n###### and quantity of malware spam are continuing\nto increase. The one-time use of malware code\n###### variants increases the cost of analysis and slows\ndown the provision of suitable defensive measures such as signatures for antivirus programs.\n\n\n∙ The most common ways of spreading malware\nare drive-by exploits, spam attachments and\nbotnets.\n\n∙  The most frequently detected malware types are\nadware and Trojans.\n\n∙  Microsoft Windows is by far the operating system\nmost frequently affected by malware, accounting\nfor around 95 per cent of all instances.\n\n∙  Mobile platforms: at least three million malware programs exist for mobile devices such as\n###### smartphones or tablets. 98 per cent of these are designed for the Android operating system.\n\n\n###### 2.2.2 Malware\n\nMalware programs are tools whereby attackers can\nexercise control over an infected system. Malware\ncomes in a variety of forms, such as viruses, Trojan\nhorses, bots and rootkits. However, modern malware is often difficult to unambiguously categorise\nas it is modular in structure and embodies or even\ndownloads a variety of different malicious functions. Today malware affects not only classical PCs\nand notebooks but also increasingly mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets.\n\n\n**Situation**\n\n∙  The total number of PC-based malware variants is\nnow estimated at around the 250 million mark.\n\n∙  In Germany there are at least one million malware\ninfections a month.\n\n∙  The number of malware variants increases at a\nrate of about 300,000 a day.\n\nFigure 2: Qualitative weekly spam figures in Germany since January 2012\n\n\n∙  Malware for mobile platforms usually masquerade as legitimate apps. They are predominantly\ndistributed via alternative app stores or websites\nrather than official app stores like Google Play, or\nare installed unwittingly by the users themselves.\n\n∙  Attackers’ deployment of malware is increasingly\nprofessional, for instance involving improved\nmethods of concealing the control servers, the\nuse of Twitter channels or Google Docs as command-and-control (C&C) servers, as well as the\nuse of cutting-edge encryption techniques such\nas elliptic curve cryptography to safeguard the\ncommunication.\n\n\n∙ Alongside classical malware which steals data or\nmanipulates online banking activities, ransomware, malware which blocks access to systems or\nencrypts user data in order to then extort ‘ransom\nmoney’, has become a further everyday tool in the\ncybercriminal’s arsenal.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assessment**\n\nDue to the sheer volume and complexity of new\nmalware programs the time which elapses before\nnew malware is detected by antivirus programs\nranges from a few hours to several days. During\n###### this window a system may be unprotected. As a\nresult the classical signature-based components\nof antivirus programs are increasingly reaching\nthe limits of their effectiveness, meaning that the\nongoing evolution of novel protective measures\nwill be needed. Furthermore, malware developers put a great deal of ingenuity into coming up\nwith a steady stream of new methods designed\nto hamper the manual analysis of malware and\nincidents by analysts and forensic scientists.\n\nFigure 3: Number of Windows malware variants\n\nFigure 4: Example of a malware infection via drive-by exploit\n\n\n###### 2.2.3 Drive-by exploits and exploit kits\n\nThe term drive-by exploit refers to the automated\n###### exploitation of vulnerabilities when a prepared\nwebsite is visited. It involves the exploitation, without any user interaction, of vulnerabilities in the\nbrowser, in plug-ins or in the operating system to\nenable the undetected installation of malware on\nthe website visitor’s system. Drive-by exploits are\nparticularly effective when utilised in the form of\nexploit kits involving the use of not one but several\n###### exploits which automatically seek out multiple\nvulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins and use\nthem for the installation of malware. In watering\nhole attacks drive-by exploits are used to execute\ntargeted attacks.\n\n**Situation**\n\n\n∙ Drive-by exploits are placed either on large num###### bers of compromised websites or individually\ntargeted ones.\n\n∙  An evaluation of Google Safe Browsing data[12]\n\n###### indicates that the proportion of websites in\nGermany in the past 12 months infected with\ndrive-by exploits or other means of distributing\nmalware stood at four per cent.\n\n∙  In recent months exploit kit attacks have most\nfrequently been directed at vulnerabilities in\nInternet Explorer, while Oracle Java has also been\n###### a popular attack target, albeit not to the same\nextent as in 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assessment**\n\nExploit kits play a central role in cyber attacks of\na criminal nature. An exploit kit integrated into a\npopular website will swiftly infect a large num###### ber of vulnerable systems without the knowledge of or any action by the user. In this kind of\nbroad-based or untargeted attack method the\nvictims are infected with a variety of malware, for\ninstance ransomware designed to extort money,\nTrojan horses for identity theft purposes as well\nas bots to develop the infrastructure for sending\n###### spam or launching DDos attacks. Currently the various manufacturers have produced security\nupdates for all the vulnerabilities used by exploit\n###### kits, in view of which efficient patch management should permit the thwarting of any exploit\nkit attacks. Utilisation of zero-day exploits in\nexploit kits are a rarity.\n\n\n###### 2.2.4 Botnets\n\n A botnet is a collection of systems which have\nbeen attacked by a remotely controllable malware\n###### variant known as a bot. The affected systems\nare controlled by the botnet operator via a command-and-control server (C&C server). Botnets\n###### are used by criminals to commit information\ntheft and online banking fraud on a grand scale,\nto launch distributed denial of service (DDos)\nattacks or to send high volumes of spam, phishing\nmails or e-mails with malware as attachment.\n\n**Situation**\n\n∙  It is estimated that in Germany alone more than a\nmillion computers are part of a botnet.\n\n\n∙  Due to the professionalisation and commercialisation of cybercrime activities, establishing and\noperating a botnet is comparatively cheap and\neasy even for people without significant technical\nexpertise.\n\n∙  Information theft is one of the greatest problems\nin relation to botnets. Alongside classical end\nuser systems, attacks are being launched with\never growing frequency on Internet-enabled\ndevices which process information such as payment details.\n\n\n**Malicious advertising banners**\n\nIn 2013 the BSI identified over 350 compromised OpenX servers\nhosted in Germany from which malicious advertising banners\nwere being superimposed over website images. The malicious\ncode which came with the advertising banners was indicative of\ndrive-by exploits. At potential risk were any visitors who had not\ninstalled the latest security updates for the Windows operatinstalled the latest security updates for the Windows operating system or such software as Oracle Java, Adobe Reader or\nFlash Flash Player. When users visit the website the infection occurs\nunnoticed and without any user action: they do not even have\nto click on the malicious bannerto click on the malicious banner.\n\nSome of the OpenX servers were operated by media agencies, Some of the OpenX servers were operated by media agencies,\n\nas a result of which some of the websites on which malicious as a result of which some of the websites on which malicious\nbanners appeared were popular ones with several thousand banners appeared were popular ones with several thousand\nvisitors a day. The BSI notified the website operators, OpenX visitors a day. The BSI notified the website operators, OpenX\nservers and responsible providers about the compromisesservers and responsible providers about the compromises[13][13]. In\n\nsome cases BSI had to do so several times, either because the\noperators did not respond or due to servers being compromised\nagain after cleaning.\n\n\n∙  Increasingly even web servers are being compromised and incorporated into botnets. Due to\ntheir broadband network connections and high\navailability these systems are particularly suitable\nfor such activities as DDos attacks.\n\n**Assessment**\n\nAs recent reports of information theft and online\nbanking fraud by botnets clearly show, the situation may be viewed as critical. Botnet infrastruc###### tures provide Internet criminals with immense\nresources of computer capacity and bandwidth\nwhich they can use for their nefarious activities.\nToday botnets are predominantly composed of\nWindows systems, but cybercriminals are in creasingly turning their attention to Mac OS X and\nAndroid devices as target platforms for botnets.\nOther Internet-enabled devices such as DSL routers or smart TVs have also fallen victim to attacks\nand infection. One reason for this is the weaker\nprotective mechanisms with which these devices\n###### are equipped. In light of the trend towards an Internet of things this issue can only grow in\nimportance.\n\n\nApart from the need to promptly install security updates, this\nonce again highlights the fact that the risk of malware infection\nvia advertising banners is not confined to the dark areas of the\nInternet but also appear on popular, reputable websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.2.5 Social engineering\n\n In attacks using social engineering, criminals\nattempt to induce their victims to disclose data of\ntheir own free will, circumvent protective measures and willingly install malicious code on their\nsystems. Just like in the field of espionage, cyber###### criminals skilfully exploit human weaknesses\nsuch as curiosity to gain access to sensitive data\nand information.\n\n**Situation**\n\n\n∙  The growing trend towards making personal data\nand information available to the general public via\nsocial networks or private websites makes it easier for criminals to use this information to prepare\ntargeted attacks involving social engineering.\n\n###### ∙  Criminals frequently exploit human curiosity for\ninteresting information, the desire for a bargain,\nprudence or bad conscious in the face of official\nthreats or threats of criminal action, as well as the\n###### increased public attention stirred up by major events such as the football world cup, public\nholidays or current economic or social affairs such\nas the introduction of the Single Euro Payments\nArea (SEPA).\n\n∙  Phishing attacks, in which e-mails with falsified\nsenders are sent in an attempt to induce users to\ndisclose personal details, continue to proliferate.\nThe ostensible senders are well-known companies and organisations, financial service providers\nand familiar online shops, e-mail or communications providers. Fictional orders, invoices, warnings or security notices direct users to fraudulent\n###### websites where they are asked to update or\nconfirm access data, account information or other\ncustomer details.\n\n\nwhich contain malware. Often the spurious bank\n###### websites can barely be distinguished from the\ngenuine articles.\n\n∙  Social engineering is a fundamental component\nof targeted attacks.\n\n**Assessment**\n\nTechnical measures increase your level of IT security but they cannot guarantee complete protection on their own. This is particularly apparent\nfrom cases of attacks involving social engineering.\n###### While users continue to unnecessarily disclose private details or click on an e-mail offering a\nspurious commercial inducement, criminals will\ncontinue to use social engineering to gain financial advantage from the data they thereby obtain.\nBecause social engineering also often constitutes\nthe gateway for targeted attacks on companies\nand government departments, employee training\nand awareness raising are vital. The example of\nphishing clearly shows how important prudent\nbehaviour by users is for data security.\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of a phishing e-mail –\n\nrecognisable by the falsified sender address\n\nFigure 6: Example of a phishing website – recognisable by the falsified URL\n\n\n∙  In one particularly exhaustive attack on German\n###### companies employees received e-mails which\nallegedly came from their personnel departments.\n###### The e-mails, which came complete with long\nfalsified threads and spurious Executive Board\ndecisions, asked the recipients to disclose details\n###### such as their personnel and account data. The\ncrim inals then used the data to make withdraw###### als from accounts and order new electronic cash\ncards.\n\n∙  In online banking users are induced via manipu###### lated test credit transfers or user verifications\ninvolving TAN or mTAN to enter data in fraudulent web forms or install ostensible security apps\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.2.6 Identity theft\n\nIdentity theft or misuse involves the acquisition\nand unauthorised use by third parties of personal\n###### data such as postal and e-mail addresses, dates\nof birth, bank account and credit card numbers.\n###### The attackers’ aim is generally to gain financial\nadvantage using the confidential information, or\nmore rarely to discredit the person whose details\nhave been stolen. Identity theft is chiefly done via\nsocial engineering, malware on infected systems\nor data theft after hacking of online services.\n\n**Situation**\n\n∙  Identity theft is an everyday occurrence. Every\nmonth large numbers of digital identities are\nstolen from infected computers of private users\nalone.\n\n∙  The amount of identity theft malware is steadily\nincreasing. The BSI alone analyses approximately\n###### 11,000 malware programs a month which are\nimplicated in identity theft in Germany.\n\n∙  These days criminals use malware which specialises in certain data such as digital identities which\nare then highly likely to be misused, for instance\nin the fields of online banking or shopping.\n\n∙  In spring 2014 the BSI published details of two\nmajor identity theft incidents in which a total of\n34 million e-mail addresses and passwords were\nstolen.\n\n\n###### Denial of service (DoS) attacks are directed at\nthe availability of services, websites, individual\nsystems or entire networks. If such an attack is\n###### launched in parallel by several systems this is\nknown as a distributed denial of service (DDoS)\nattack. DDoS attacks frequently involve very large\nnumbers of computers. The computers in question may have been brought together unwittingly\nto form a botnet or may be compromised systems,\n###### but could also be computers which have been\nlinked up by willing participants, as for instance\nin politically motivated attacks. DDoS attacks on\nlarge companies or governments often involve\npolitical or ideological motives, whereas attacks\n###### on e-commerce providers increasingly stem\nfrom competitors or extortionists. There are also\nincreasing numbers of DDoS attacks on critical\ninfrastructure operators such as banks, transport\n###### companies and media organisations. Here too\ncriminals are chiefly motivated by financial gain,\nfor instance through extortion.\n\n**Situation**\n\n∙  So far in 2014 there have been over 32,000 DDoS\nattacks in Germany alone.\n\n∙ Virtually every sector is afflicted by DDoS attacks.\n\n∙  The Alliance for Cyber Security[14] survey found\nthat over a third of the companies questioned\nreported being the target of a DDoS attack on\ntheir websites during the past three years.\n\n∙  A quarter of the companies surveyed had suffered\nDDoS attacks on their network infrastructure.\n\n\ncontribution to the protection of personal data\nfor minimal effort or outlay. Online service providers should also be more diligent in providing\nbetter protective measures for their systems and\ntheir customers’ data. For instance, customer\ndata and the corresponding databases should be\noperated in encrypted form as a matter of course,\nwhile users should be offered secure authentication procedures such as those involving twofactor authentication. This can for instance be\ndone using the new identity cards, which millions\nof German citizens now possess.\n\n###### 2.2.7 Denial of service\n\n\n∙  Attacks on service providers are also attractive,\n###### indeed today the number of identities stolen\nthrough attacks on the servers of online sellers\nand service providers is significantly greater than\nthe number of identities stolen from infected user\n###### machines. For instance, one attack on eBay in May 2014 affected 145 million customers worldwide, around 15 million of them in Germany.\n\n**Assessment**\n\nThe cyber threat posed by identity theft will continue to rise as long as professionally organised\n###### attackers have a large number of inadequately\nprotected systems, run both by private users and\n###### service providers, at their disposal. Password management and the regular downloading of\nall relevant system updates make an import ant\n\n\n-----\n\n∙ Since 2013 there has been increased use of reflection attacks, whereby the target system is not\nattacked directly but rather through the misuse\nof publicly available Internet services (e.g. DNS[15]\nor NTP[16]). These involve attackers sending small\nqueries to a public service in the name of their\nvictim. The services then send their replies to the\nvictim’s system. Because the replies are usually a\nlot larger than the queries, even a small number\nof attacking systems can do great damage and\ncripple the victim’s system. In reflection attacks\nunwitting parties such as the service providers\nbecome unwilling accomplices.\n\n∙  To date the largest DDos attack took place in\nFebruary 2014, involving a bandwidth up to 400\ngigabits per second. This attack was based on\nNTP reflection.\n\n∙  The number of NTP servers in Germany which\ncould be exploited for this kind of attack fell\nbetween June 2014 and August 2014 from over\n4,000 systems to around 2,500. This was due to\ninformation given to the operators by the BSI.\n\n**Assessment**\n\nGlobal comparison shows that Germany is less\nbadly affected by this issue than other countries.\nAll in all, Germany is neither a major source of\nsuch attacks nor a particularly frequent victim.\n###### Nevertheless, DDos attacks can threaten the\nsurvival of companies affected by them.\n\nFigure 7: Procedures of an APT attack\n\n\n###### 2.2.8 Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)\n\n Advanced persistent threats are targeted cyber\nattacks on specific institutions in which the attackers gain persistent access to the victim network\nand then widen the attack to additional systems.\n###### The attacks involve the deployment of major\nresources and considerable technical skill on the\nattackers’ part and are generally difficult to detect.\n\n**Situation**\n\n\n∙  APT attacks focus chiefly on the defence industry, high-tech sectors such as the automobile\nindustry, shipbuilding and aerospace, research\ninstitutes and public administration.\n\n∙  In APT attacks the initial infection is frequently\nintroduced using an e-mail with a prepared\nattachment plus targeted social engineering.\nInformation from the recipient’s professional\nmilieu which is plausible or expected is used,\nalong with the name of a trustworthy sender.\nWith this kind of targeted social engineering it is\noften impossible to distinguish between authentic and fraudulent messages.\n\n\n∙  Another trend in the launching of APTs is the\nuse of watering hole attacks. In these a website\nwhich is frequently visited by a target individual\nis first compromised. When the target individual\nvisits that website their computer is infected with\nmalware via a drive-by exploit. Alternatively the\nvictim may be sent an e-mail with a link to a prepared website. The e-mail content produced via\nsocial engineering induces the recipient to click\non the link.\n\n∙  Frequently attacks initially focus on less techno###### logically aware target individuals within companies.\n\n\n∙  Within larger organisations the central directory\nstructures are generally the focus of the attack.\nThe next phase of the attack involves exfiltrating data or sabotaging target systems. Attackers attempt to keep the victim’s systems under\ncontrol as long as possible without the victim\nbecoming aware of the attack. Indeed, practical\n###### experience shows that APTs often remain undetected for months or even years. In the final\nphase of an APT attack any traces of it are eliminated as thoroughly as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assessment**\n\nAPT attacks pose a serious threat to the German\neconomy and public administration. Hacking into\npoorly protected company servers will continue\n###### to grow in significance. To permit companies\npotentially at risk to be warned at an early stage\n###### and produce a comprehensive picture of the\nsituation it is vital to more precisely evaluate the\nmode of operation and attack tools used in APT\nattacks. The reporting of incidents to the BSI by\naffected companies makes an important contribution to this end.\n\n###### 2.2.9 Cyber attacks by intelligence agencies\n\n\nThe same applies to data obtainable from Internet service providers such as social networks or\nsearch services.\n\n∙  Individual attacks in communications\n**and cyberspace:**\nThese attacks are targeted at the IT systems of\nprominent people and institutions. To this end\nintelligence agencies first systematically analyse,\npurchase and collect hitherto unpublished hardware and software vulnerabilities. This knowledge\nbase is then used to devise specifically adapted\ncyber attacks to attack and control IT systems\nidentified at the strategic reconnaissance stage.\nRadio and mobile communications can be individually tapped through corresponding attacks.\nIn this way individual users’ computers can be\n###### infected with malware, whereafter they can be monitored in real time from anywhere in the\nworld. If target individuals use a smartphone they\ncan be tracked, meaning that their location may\nbe determined at all times, and in many cases\nstrategic reconnaissance allows the identification\nof the person’s interlocutor, who is also carrying a\nsmartphone or laptop.\n\n\nGermany is subject to continuous cyber attacks\nwith the objective of obtaining information and\ngaining financial advantages. During 2013 and\n###### 2014 both the technologically improved detection systems integrated by the BSI into the gov###### ernment’s networks and the evaluation of the\nEdward Snowden revelations have increased our\ntechnical knowledge and understanding of cyber\nattacks launched by intelligence agencies and\nthe methods they use.\n\n###### The BSI’s improved detection systems have un - covered strong and unambiguous evidence of\ncyber attacks by intelligence agencies against German infrastructure in the business, research and\npublic administration spheres. These attacks have\nalso been observed both by BSI partner agencies\n###### and BSI private sector partners. The Snowden\nrevelations were also instrumental in increasing\nknowledge on intelligence activities. What was\n###### surprising about them was the degree of professionalism they revealed, along with the scale\nand extent of the surveillance measures and the\ncopious resources assigned to the enterprise, both\nin personnel and financial terms.\n\n\nA more precise analysis of the available technical\nfindings allows to identify four principal attack\nvectors:\n\n∙  Strategic reconnaissance:\n\nAll the data accumulating at Internet and communication nodes are collected, stored and analysed.\nThis involves gathering the (connection) data of\n###### large numbers of Internet users, from which\nattackers can determine who has communicated\nwith whom, at what time and in what place. If\nthe content is unencrypted it can be eavesdropped\n###### in its entirety, for instance in the case of VoIP\nphone calls.\n\n\n∙  Influencing standards and implementations:\n\nThis involves manipulating IT standards and cryptographic standards in advance of the technical\n###### reconnaissance, thereby system ically undermining the implementation of inherently stronger\nsecurity mechanisms designed to re inforce confidentiality. This means that strong, internationally\nstandardised cryptoalgo rithms used in hardware\nor software implementations are for instance\ncombined with weak random number generators, as a result of which they no longer provide\nadequate protection of confidentiality.\n\n∙  Targeted manipulation of IT equipment:\n\nThis involves intervention in ordering processes,\ndelivery or supply chains in order to manipulate\nIT equipment. The process includes inserting back\ndoors or weakening technical security features.\nFor instance, monitors, keyboards and video or\naudio cables are fitted with miniature transmit###### ters which allow radio signals to be detected\nfrom a greater distance. Network components\nlike routers can be manipulated by changing their\nsoftware so that they can be remotely controlled\nor even switched off, thereby also facilitating\ncyber sabotage.\n\n\n-----\n\nExemplifying these attack vectors are attack\nscen arios directed at mobile communications\nshown in the following illustration.\n\nFigure 8: Mobile communication attack vectors\n\nAll the options discussed above for compromising\nICT systems for technical or cyberespionage purposes can also be used in a similar fashion to carry\nout cyber sabotage. This is particularly true of the\ninformation and communication technology used\nin critical infrastructures.\n\n###### 2.3 Typology of attackers\n\n\nDespite the great proliferation of different attack\n###### targets and possible attack methods, the motivation behind a cyber attack can frequently be put\ndown to financial interests, information procurement, sabotage, gaining of influence or the pursuit\nof political interests. We may broadly distinguish\n###### between three different categories of attacker: criminals, intelligence agencies and hacktivists,\nwhile malicious insiders forming a special category.\n\n###### 2.3.1 Cybercriminals\n\n**Introduction**\nThe motivation of cybercriminals is to make money\nby illegal means through the use of information\ntechnology. The activities of organised cybercrime\ninclude identity theft, product fraud, using stolen\nbanking information to steal money and extortion.\nOrganised cybercriminals are highly professional\nin the way they exploit the advantages gained via\n###### cyber attacks. In addition to organised crime we\nalso find individual criminals or smaller groups,\nthough they are generally characterised by a lower\nlevel of professionalism.\n\n\n**Capabilities**\nThe methods and variants used by cybercriminals\nfocus on technological progress as well as existing\ndefensive systems. In the process attackers exploit\nthe entire spectrum of technical options. For private users that involves the use of spam, phishing\ne-mails and malware, identity theft, manipulation\nof online banking, adware, scareware and ransomware. In addition, spurious job offers are used to\n###### turn private individuals into financial agents or\ngoods agents who become unwitting accomplices\nin financial or product fraud.\n\nThe range of attack scenarios affecting companies\ninclude various forms of extortion and hacking\ninto server services. Furthermore, malware is increasingly being infiltrated into point of sale sys###### tems in order to read off customer data directly\nfrom the checkout during the payment transaction.\n\n\nIn addition, in return for suitable payment criminals offer cyberespionage and competitor research\nservices. Spying on competitors enables companies to obtain sensitive internal information on\nthem and their products which can be converted\ninto a material advantage in global competition.\n\n**Objectives**\n###### Today cybercrime is pervasive. All user groups, from private citizens to the worlds of business,\nscience and public administration, are affected.\n###### As long as criminals see opportunities to make\nmoney this way they will exploit those opportunities and continuously refine their methods.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cybercrime 2013 Federal Situation Assessment (Bundeslagebild) published by the Federal\nCriminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt – BKA)\ncites over 64,000 cases for the year 2013, though\n###### the BKA assumes that the true figure is much\nhigher[17]. According to a survey by the Alliance for\nCyber Security, cybercriminals are the attacker\ngroup that will pose the greatest threat over the\ncoming years.\n\n\n**Ransomware**\n\nDigital extortion using ransomware which blocks access to\ninfected systems or encrypts user data is as widespread in\nGermany as elsewhere. The BSI Service Centre is regularly con\n\n\n\n\ntacted by German citizens who have fallen victim to ransomware\n\nattacks and are seeking help. To date in 2014 there have been\nalmost 1,200 such enquiries, while the total in 2013 came to\nover 8,500. Since the start of 2014 several new ransomware\nvariants have been identified which are equipped with better\nmethods and are able to infect and encrypt user systems or sermethods and are able to infect and encrypt user systems or ser\nvers. The first variants designed to attack Android smartphones\n\nhave also now been detected. If an extortion victim gives in to\nthe criminal’s demands a direct money transfer from the victim\nto the criminal takes place, which is what makes ransomware\nattractive to criminals. Anonymous payment systems such as\nprepaid cards or so-called cryptocurrencies are used for the purprepaid cards or so-called cryptocurrencies are used for the purpose. Thus, unlike product fraud or where financial agents are\nused, there is no intermediary. The BSI advises victims not to pay\nthe sum demanded under any circumstances, rather cleaning the\naffected computers and reporting the case to the police.\n\n\ninals. Alongside standard tools and approaches we\nfind the use of specialised malware designed inde###### pendently by them or by service providers. Furthermore, intelligence agencies can invest a great\ndeal of money in the search for vulnerabilities to\n###### exploit. Given that, depending on their size and quality, software packages will inevitably have\na certain number of vulnerabilities, new gateways\nfor cyber attacks are always open to them.\n\n**Objectives**\nThe targets of attacks by intelligence agencies are\n###### companies in key industries, critical infrastructure and the government agencies, administrative\n###### bodies and research institutions of other countries. Depending on their background, espionage\nand sabotage attacks are executed either with the\n###### aim of furthering their own national interests\nor gaining advantages for national businesses on\ninternational markets. Due to their wide-ranging\ncapabilities, business, public administration and\n###### private citizens may equally be the targeted or unintended objects of intelligence agency activities. Given their quality, defending against these\nattacks is only possible by putting a great deal of\neffort and money into countermeasures.\n\n\n###### 2.3.3 Hacktivism and cyber activists\n\n**Introduction**\nIn the hacktivism sphere attackers ostensibly use\ncomputer systems and networks as a means of\nprotest and in the furtherance of political or ideological objectives. Through their actions hacktivists aim to draw attention to what they see as\npolitical, social, economic or technological injustices. They often equate this form of protest with\nconventional forms of protest such as demonstrations, activism or civil disobedience. However, for\nthe organisations under attack hacktivism can do\nserious damage.\n\n\n###### 2.3.2 Intelligence agencies\n\n**Introduction**\nThe primary purpose of cyber attacks by govern###### ment intelligence agencies is military and eco- nomic espionage[18]. In the military sector cyber- space has today become a further key domain\nalongside the classical military domains land, sea,\nair and space.\n\n\n**Capabilities**\nThe cyberspace capabilities of government intelligence agencies are limited only by the resources\ndevoted to them, which in some cases are vast. As\ngovernment organisations, intelligence agencies\nhave a great many methods at their disposal, from\n###### access to central infrastructure components or\ntheir operators, interventions in IT products ex\nworks or the insertion of back-doors into products\n###### via manufacturers in their own countries. Classical cyber attacks, for instance via Trojan horses,\n###### are used in targeted fashion and are of higher quality than the attacks launched by cybercrim\n\n**Capabilities**\nThe hacktivist scene is heterogeneous and in###### cludes many different groups within which\nindividual grouping or even individual hacktivists may be pooled together, for example the\nAnonymous movement, the revelation websites\nor cyber occupiers. Hacktivists often act on the\n###### spur of the moment and organise themselves\nvery rapidly. Hacktivists are capable of launching\nDDos attacks, manipulating websites and sowing targeted disinformation via social networks.\nThey also engage in targeted information theft\nfollowed by publication of data in order to gain\npublicity for a specific demand. Not infrequently\nhacktivist activities proceed in parallel with conventional protest campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Objectives**\nGiven their motivation the chief focuses of hack###### tivist activities are governments, government\norganisations and major companies. The current\noverall threat level in Germany is low. However,\n###### the international threat level may be rated as\ncritical, with a large number of incidents affecting\ncritical infrastructure such as information and\ncommunication technology (ICT), the food industry, media and culture.\n\n###### 2.3.4 Malicious insiders\n\n\n###### Alongside the three types of attacker outlined above, malicious insiders constitute a further\ngrouping who come into consideration as potential culprits for attacks on in-house or confidential information or acts of sabotage. Due to their\nless restricted access to in-house know-how and\nresources as compared with external attackers,\ntheir chances of success in accessing undetected\ninto key corporate data and information is par###### ticularly high. Furthermore, malicious insiders are able to analyse the protective measures in\nplace over long periods, thus making them easier\n###### to circumvent. On top of this, malicious insiders\ncan exploit the trust placed in them by their own\n###### organisation. Apart from employees, external service providers may also become malicious insiders if their activities give them influence\nover or direct access to in-house information or\nprocesses.\n\n\n###### 2.4  Summary\n\nThe current IT landscape and the multifaceted\n###### nature of the security threats of today pose a\npermanent challenge for users of information\ntechnology. A wide variety of factors and circumstances are currently favourable for the execution of cyber attacks. Meanwhile, the continuous\nrefinement and professionalisation of attackers\nand attack methods further increase the threats\nfacing information security.\n\nTable 2 summarises the existing security threats,\n###### attack methods. In view of the overall attack\npotential posed by these threats, the state of IT\n###### security in Germany may be viewed as critical.\n\n**Central causes and threats for private users**\nPrivate users’ systems are currently subject to\nsecurity threats deriving from the following\ncauses:\n\n\n## 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n\nInadequate patch management and use of\nout-of-date software on all devices\n\nCyber attacks via spam e-mail containing\nmalicious attachments and social engineering involving the use of spurious invoices,\norder confirmations or reminders to induce\nusers to run malware\n\nCyber attacks via compromised websites\nor manipulated advertising banners which\ninstall malware when visiting a website\n\nCyber attacks on service providers with a\nview to stealing their customer data\n\n‘Digital carelessness’ in handling mobile\ndevices and apps and disclosing personal\ninformation\n\n\n-----\n\n**Central causes and threats** **High number of undisclosed cases**\n**for business and government** On top of the known threat situation we also\nMany of the most prevalent threats affect private have to assume that there are a great many undiscitizens, business and the government in equal closed cases. Here too the situation assessment is\nmeasure as users of information and communi- based on the observation and analysis of a cross\ncation technology. This applies in particular to un- section of the actual situation in Germany and\ntargeted attacks such as spam e-mail or drive-by worldwide. The frequency with which incidents\nattacks from compromised websites or advertis- go unreported makes it all the more difficult to\ning banners. However, given the greater complex- accurately appraise the actual situation. A study\nity in business environments and the presumably on economic espionage[19] came to the conclusion\n###### higher levels of security in place as compared that only around a quarter of all incidents come\nwith private users, the central threats they face to the attention of external experts or governand their causes do differ: ment agencies, while only five per cent of cases\n\never get reported to the police or public prosecutors. Accordingly, rich sources of information on\n\nTargeted espionage attacks on businesses, attack methods, tools used and targets, as well\nresearch bodies or the government executed as on criminals and their motivations, are often\n\n## 1\n\n###### using precisely tailored social engineer- beyond the reach of investigators.\ning, unknown vulnerabilities and specially\ndesigned tools\n\nThe incidents reported in the following chapter\nillustrate the impact that vulnerabilities, malware\n\nCyber attacks on company websites or or inadequate security have had in the past. The\nservice offers incidents serve as examples of how an apparently\n\n## 2\n\nabstract threat to institutions or individuals can\nrapidly transform into concrete risks which cause\n\nInsufficient protection of networked real damage.\nIndustrial Control Systems in manufac\n## 3\n\nturing and production industries\n\n**Threats** **2013** **2014** **Forecast**\n\n###### Challenges posed by the integration of Vulnerabilities \n\n## 4 mobile devices (‘bring your own device’) Spam \n\nand external service providers into existing\nICT infrastructures Malware\n\nDrive-by exploits and\nexploit kits\n\nInadequate patch management and use of Botnets\n\n## 5 out-of-date software on all devices Social engineering \n\n\n###### The threat assessment is underpinned by the\nanalyses and publications of antivirus software\nvendors and IT security service providers.

Since these incidents\ncurrent IT threats and cyber attacks have become\n###### a focus of political and media attention. Apart\nfrom the above-mentioned cases of identity theft\nthe incidents selected also highlighted how skilled,\nflexible and thorough the attackers’ methods had\nnow become. The attacks affected all information\ntechnology user groups, from companies, government departments, research institutes and private\ncitizens to critical infrastructure operators. Incidents\naffecting critical infrastructure operators are particularly serious because any damage done by cyber\nattacks could rapidly have severe consequences for\nthe general public and the economy as a whole.\n\n\n###### 3.1  Incidents affecting the federal government\n\nThe BSI Situation Centre is the central reporting\noffice for IT security incidents affecting the federal government. Since 2010 government departments have been required to report serious security incidents to the Situation Centre immediately\nand less critical incidents monthly. This enables\nthe BSI to not only monitor the immediate reaction to the actual attack but also to identify trends\nand developments in relation to the threats facing\n###### the federal government’s IT and networks and\ntake correspondingly early countermeasures.\n\n\nnication. Internet traffic is checked to determine\n###### whether it connects to known command and\ncontrol servers for botnets or espionage programs.\nThese connections from governmental networks\ncan be directly blocked and reported to the responsible authorities so that infected computers can\nbe cleaned. Thus, around 3,500 attempts to access\n###### malicious servers are blocked every day. Since\nthe beginning of 2014 34 infected systems have\n###### been identified which, despite being protected\nby commercial IT security products, have been\ncompromised by malware. Around 1,100 website\noperators have been informed by BSI that their\nwebsites are distributing malware.\n\n###### The BSI records an average of one denial of service (Dos) attack a month against individual federal\ngovernment websites. Many of the cases reported\nto the BSI from federal government organisations\nalso related to the exploitation of vulnerabilities\nin web applications. For instance, in several cases\n###### attackers sent between 20,000 and 200,000 spam messages by using scripts which automatically fill in the ‘Forward’ or Recommendation function of websites to send the spam messages. In\n###### this case the government department website’s\n‘Recommend page’ feature was vulnerable, and\n###### in response it was perman ently deactivated or\nfurnished with additional protective measures.\n\n\nIn another attack over 900 employees were e-mailed\na link to a phishing website designed for that government department. The e-mail claimed that the\nstorage limit for the mailbox had been exceeded\nand that it was unable to receive any more e-mails.\nBecause of this, in order to be able to receive any\nmore e-mails it would be necessary to confirm the\ne-mail account. The phishing website asked for\npeople’s e-mail address, username and password.\nOnce the attack was detected access to the linked\nphishing website was blocked.\n\nIncidents which are not attributable to a cyber\nattack can also have a major impact on the availability of IT infrastructure and therefore on IT\n###### security. An evaluation of additional messages\nthat the situation centre received from the federal\ngovernment clearly showed that faults or breakdowns suffered by the data centre power and air\nconditioning systems were often not adequately\ncompensated by the emergency power system and\n###### could thus lead to power cuts lasting for hours. Another cause of reports is the use of mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones with\n\n\nThe protection of federal government systems\n###### and communication is based on a multilevel security model. Alongside standard antivirus programs additional protective measures are\nused at different stages which can defend against\nmalicious e-mails in real time. Since May 2014\nthe associated procedure has led to the interception of up to 60,000 additional infected e-mails a\nmonth in the federal government’s networks.\nTo successfully defend against high-grade attacks\nan additional system is designed to detect attacks\nwhich have already circumvented standard protective mechanisms. Thus far in 2014 some 15 to\n20 attacks a day on the governmental network\n###### have been detected which would have eluded\nnormal protective measures. An average of one\nattack per day is a targeted attack attributed to\nan intelligence agency. An additional protective\nstage involves the blocking of outgoing commu\n\n-----\n\n###### access to government networks which are then\nlost or stolen. Despite this, attacks on government\nnetworks involving lost or stolen mobile devices\nhave not been registered.\n\n###### 3.2 Incidents affecting private users\n\n 3.2.1 Millions of cases of identity theft in Germany\n\n**Incident**\nIn spring 2014 two cases of identity theft became\npublic in which attackers gained access to the user###### names and passwords of 16 and 18 million Internet users respectively.\n\n**Method**\n\nThe criminals gained access to the data via systems infected with malware and attacks on online\nservices.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe criminals tried to use the e-mail addresses and\nassociated passwords to log in to e-mail accounts\nand then use those accounts to send spam e-mails.\n###### It can be assumed that the addresses and passwords in question allow access not only to e-mail\n###### accounts but also to other online accounts, for\ninstance to online shops, Internet forums or social\nnetworks.\n\n**Target groups**\nThe attackers focused on Internet users in Germany\nand other European countries.\n\n\n###### 3.2.2 Vulnerabilities in home network routers\n\n**Incident**\nIn early 2014 a vulnerability was identified in the\nFRITZ!-Box routers produced by AVM.\n\n**Method**\nAttackers exploited an unpatched vulnerability\nto gain access to the device and all configuration\ndata stored.\n\n**Impact**\n###### By gaining access to the configuration data the\nattackers were able to manipulate the system. They\nwere also able to read data giving access to e-mail\naccounts and other online services if that data had\nbeen stored on the router. In addition the attackers used the vulnerability to make expensive calls\n###### to premium-rate telephone numbers at the victim’s or the telephone company’s cost. The manufacturers have issued several warnings to users on\nthe need to download the security updates.\n\n\n**Target groups**\n\nSeveral million private users’ devices were affected\n###### in Germany alone. Many SMEs and other com- panies who use these devices in their business\noperations were also affected.\n\n**Technical capabilities**\nIn both technical and organisational terms the\ncriminals acted in a professional fashion, exploit###### ing a previously unknown vulnerability in the\nrouter’s operating system to obtain information\nand cause the victim financial damage.\n\n\n**Technical capabilities**\nAttacks on Internet users via e-mails containing\nmalware, social engineering or drive-by exploits\nhave become an everyday matter. However, the\nsheer volume of user data accessed at the beginning\nof the year is indicative of the criminals’ professionalism.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.2.3 Online banking Trojans: from Feodo to Geodo\n\n**Incident**\nIn May 2014 the online banking malware Geodo\n###### superseded the Trojan Feodo, which had been\nknown since 2013.\n\n**Method**\n###### The attackers e-mailed deceptively authentic- looking invoices and reservation confirmations in the name of telecommunications service providers and banks to distribute malware which was\neither contained in a file attachment or provided\nas a link in the message. The links led to compromised websites on which the attackers had placed\nmalware for downloading.\n\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe attack wave persisted for several weeks and,\nas had been the case with Feodo, was highly successful, leading to large numbers of infections. In\naddition to manipulating online banking transactions Geodo obtained credentials from the infected PCs and transmitted them to the attackers’\ncommand and control servers. This account data\nwas subsequently used to further distribute the\nmalware.\n\n**Target groups**\n\nThe attackers focused on Internet users and bank\nclients in Germany.\n\n\n###### 3.2.4 iBanking: malware for smartphones\n\n**Incident**\nSince mid-2013 underground forums have been\noffering malware for monitoring and manipulating Android smartphones. The malware was used\nfor such purposes as attacks on online banking\ntransactions using mTANs.\n\n**Method**\n\nFirst the victim’s PC gets infected with malware.\nThe next time the victim logs on for online banking the malware manipulates the banks website\nand requests information on the victim’s mobile\ntelephone. The victim then receives a text mes###### sage containing a link to an app infected with\niBanking malware and is induced via social engin###### eering to install this app on his or her smartphone. The attack on the online banking service\ninvolves interaction between the malware on the\nPC and the smartphone. The malware on the PC\ninitiates its own money transfer. The mTAN sent\nby the bank to the client’s mobile phone is intercepted there by iBanking malware and transmitted to the infected PC. The malware then uses the\nintercepted mTAN to complete the credit transfer\non the PC.\n\n\n**Technical capabilities**\n###### The federal government’s BSI-based Computer\nEmergency Response Team CERT-Bund assumed\n###### the role of a bot and for three weeks received\npackages of stolen access data from the control and\n###### command servers. This enabled BSI to identify\nover 200,000 compromised e-mail accounts. CERT###### Bund has informed the various network operators about the compromised e-mail accounts. The\nmalware’s capabilities, coupled with the immediate exploitation of the stolen access data to send\nspam indicate a technically and organisationally\nsophisticated attack on German users.\n\n\n**Impact**\nThe attackers were able to compromise the online\nbanking services of various international banks.\nThe malware can relatively easily be adapted for\n###### attacks on other Internet services. For example,\nvariants of iBanking have already been discovered\n###### which facilitate attacks on two-factor authen- tication (username or password + SMS code) for\nFacebook and Gmail.\n\n**Target groups**\n\nThe malware is used to attack bank clients who\nuse mTANs to do online banking.\n\n**Technical capabilities**\n###### The malware offers the attackers wide-ranging\nopportunities to control smartphones: monitoring text messages, recording phone calls, acoustic\nroom surveillance, access to various data on the\nsmartphone, etc. All the information collected can\nbe transmitted to servers controlled by the attackers. In the iBanking package developers also offer\n###### server software with which the infected devices\ncan be controlled. The malware’s functionality\nreveals a high level of technical expertise on the\npart of the developer, who has sold the software\nunder various different license models.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.3 Incidents affecting business\n\nUnlike the federal government, companies are not\n###### currently required to report serious IT secur ity\nincidents to the BSI. The UP KRITIS initiative has\nfor many years given participating operators of\ncritical infrastructure the opportunity to share\ninformation on incidents. In addition, together\n###### with the Alliance for Cyber Security BSI offers a reporting centre via which incidents can be\nreported, anonymously if desired, which could be\nrelevant for other bodies or in connection with\nwhich the reporter would like evaluation or assistance. The objective of the reporting centre is to\ngain information on new attack techniques and\n###### critical incidents with wider-ranging implica- tions. The BSI analyses the reports and makes its\nanonym ised conclusions available to participants.\nThe aim of this procedure is to give companies\nearly notice of new attacks and possible prevent ###### ive measures. To date the reporting centre \nhas been used predominantly by SMEs who\nhave fallen victim to DDos attacks or malware\ninfections.\n\n\n###### 3.3.1 APT attack on industrial installations in Germany\n\n**Incident**\nTargeted attack on a steel mill in Germany\n\n**Method**\nThe attackers used spear phishing e-mails in tandem with sophisticated social engineering to gain\n###### initial access to the steel mill’s office network. From there they worked their way progressively\ninto the production networks.\n\n**Impact**\n\nBreakdowns of individual control components or\nentire installations proliferated. The breakdowns\n###### led to the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace, leaving it in an undefined state and resulting\nin massive damage.\n\n**Target groups**\n\nOperators of industrial installations\n\n\n###### 3.3.2 Heartbleed: critical vulnerability in widely used software library\n\n**Incident**\n###### The vulnerability known as Heartbleed, discovered in April 2014 in the OpenSSL software\nlibrary, permits the unauthorised access to the\nprogram memory.\n\n**Method**\n\nAll that is needed to exploit the vulnerability is to\nsend specially crafted queries to systems which\nuse the function affected by the OpenSSL vulnerability.\n\n**Impact**\n\nVirtually everyone on the Internet uses the Secure\nSockets Layer Protocol (SSL) or Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), normally without even knowing\n###### it. This very widely used technology is of great\nimportance for encrypted communication on the\n###### Internet and is for example used on almost all\nwebsites to check their authenticity and encrypt\ncommunications between users and websites. The\nOpenSSL free software library is often used for the\npurpose. The Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL\npermits unauthorised access to program memory.\nThis could include the usernames and passwords\nentered by website visitors, and in rare cases it may\nalso be possible to read secret cryptographic keys.\nThis would mean that attackers could masquerade\nas the service provider and read users’ supposedly\nencrypted data transmissions.\n\n**Target groups**\n###### All products and services using the vulnerable\nOpenSSL software library function were affected.\n###### Major online services, social networks, bank\nwebsites and federal government servers were all\n###### affected by the vulnerability. Given the extent of\nthe vulnerability it must be assumed that, despite\nthe availability of patches, there continue to be\nsystems in Germany which are still vulnerable to\nHeartbleed.\n\n\n**Technical capabilities**\nThe attackers’ technical skills can be rated as very\nadvanced. A variety of different internal systems\nand industrial components were compromised.\nThe attackers’ expertise extended not just to clas###### sical IT security but also to detailed technical\nknowledge of the Industrial Control Systems and\nproduction processes being used.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.3.3 Dragonfly: targeted attacks on production networks\n\n**Incident**\n###### The Dragonfly group (also known as ‘Energetic\nBear’) used the malware Havex, which was detected\nin 2014, to attack several dozen German companies.\n\n**Method**\n###### The attack campaign made use of a new attack\nmethod: in the first stage the criminals attacked\nthe manufacturers of industrial control system\nsoftware. The malware Havex was attached to the\n###### relevant installation files on the vendors’ download servers, meaning that customers who installed\n###### the legitimate software simultan eously downloaded the malware onto their systems. In some\ncases a module was downloaded which collected\n###### information on devices and systems used in\nthe production network and passed it on to the\nattackers.\n\n\n###### 3.3.4 Operation Windigo: Linux malware Ebury collects SSH access data\n\n**Incident**\nEbury is malware with back-door functionality.\nIt is a rootkit for Linux and Unix-like operating\nsystems which intercepts Secure Shell (SSH)\ncredentials.\n\n**Method**\nThe malware is installed by attackers on comprom###### ised servers either by exchanging SSH program\nfiles or a library used commonly by these programs.\n###### Ebury steals access data from infected systems\n(usernames and passwords) to incoming and out###### going SSH connections and transmits the data\nto the attackers. In addition the private SSH keys\nused for outgoing SSH connections were stolen\nfrom the compromised systems.\n\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe back-door gives the criminals full control over\nthe infected system at all times. Servers infected\nwith Ebury were used by the criminals for various\ncriminal activities making up ‘Operation Windigo’.\n###### For instance, web servers were manipulated so that visitors were redirected from the websites hosted there to other servers. These involved\neither dating portals, websites with pornographic\ncontent or servers hosting drive-by exploits which\ninfected the website visitors’ computers with malware. Our analysis revealed that several hundred\n###### thousand such redirections were taking place every day. On other systems the criminals used\nthe access data stolen using Ebury to install malware for sending spam. During the monitoring\n###### period an average of 35 millions spam e-mails\nwere sent every day.\n\n**Target groups**\n\nServer operators (primarily) and Internet users\n(secondarily)\n\n\n**Impact**\n\nHavex facilitated the targeted use of malware in\nIndustrial Control Systems in order to collect information. It must be assumed that the criminals\n###### then used this information to launch further\nattacks. In collaboration with the Federal Criminal Police Office the BSI informed several dozen\ncompanies in Germany which had fallen victim\nto the Dragonfly campaign.\n\n**Target groups**\n\nProduction facilities and production networks\n\n\n**Technical capabilities**\n###### The skills which became apparent during the\nDragonfly attack campaign, for example the targeted compromising of download servers, highlighted the attackers’ technical sophistication and\ndemonstrated that attacks on Industrial Control\nSystems in Germany are a reality.\n\n\n**Technical capabilities**\nEbury is of high technical quality and the infrastructure created on the compromised servers\nis professionally organised. The criminals made\nhuge profits from distributing the malware via\ndrive-by exploits, redirection from websites and\n###### sending spam. CERT-Bund joined the ‘Ebury\nWorking Group’, an international association of\nsecurity analysts which has detected some 30,000\nservers infected worldwide with Ebury since February 2013. About ten per cent of these servers are\nlocated in Germany. CERT-Bund regularly notifies\nGerman hosting providers and national CERTs in\nover 60 countries of known Ebury infections.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.3.5 Great Britain: bankruptcy due to cyber extortion and sabotage\n\n**Incident**\nIn June 2014 the collaboration and development\n###### platform for software developers operated by\nthe company Code Spaces became the target for\nextortion accompanied by a DDos attack lasting\nover 48 hours.\n\n**Method**\nThe criminals gained illegal access to an admin###### istrator account for cloud storage rented by the\ncompany from Amazon Web Services and placed\nseveral messages there demanding money. The\ncriminals were clearly prepared for Code Spaces’\nfruitless attempt to change the access data.\n\n**Impact**\n\n###### After the company refused to pay the money\ndemanded, the criminals began indiscriminately\ndeleting data. As a result the company lost virtually all its data, backups and machine settings, and\nin the end the company, which had been trading\nsuccessfully for seven years, was forced to discontinue operations. There are no plans to reactivate\nthe business because the financial cost of restoration measures and paying compensation to clients\nis too great.\n\n\n###### 3.3.6 ShellShock: vulnerability in the Bash command line interpreter\n\n**Incident**\nIn September 2014 a vulnerability dubbed Shell\nShock was published in the Bash command line\n###### interpreter. Bash allowed the propagation to a\nshell not only of environmental variables but also\nfunctions. The function name is transmitted to the\nshell as an environmental variable, followed by the\n###### function definition. The vulnerability allowed\nan attached program code to be executed in the\nfunction definition.\n\n**Method**\nBash is a standard component which is correspondingly widely distributed. It is used for such\nthings as system services and remote access to\nboth web and mail servers and also some smartphones. There is a correspondingly wide range\n###### of scenarios whereby the vulnerability can be\nexploited to executed unauthorised program code\non affected IT systems. If services linked over the\n###### Internet are affected by ShellShock the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n\n\n**Impact**\n\n###### The unauthorised execution of program code,\nin some cases with administrator rights, allowed\nattackers to access confidential information and\n###### manipulate or crash IT systems. Malware has\nbeen detected which uses the vulnerability to put\n###### IT systems out of action. CVSS, the recognised\nindustry standard for evaluating the severity of\nvulnerabilities, has given ShellShock its top score\nof 10.\n\n**Target groups**\nBash is the standard shell for most Linux distributions and is also installed on many other systems.\nAlso affected are the Apple operating system OS X\nand various Industrial Control Systems. It must\n###### be assumed that at the time it became known\nthere were vulnerable systems in virtually every\ninstitution.\n\n\n**Target groups**\n\n###### The attack illustrates the fundamental risk of a\ncompany collapsing due to cyberspace extortion\nand sabotage as well as from the outsourcing of\nbusiness-critical services.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3.4 Incidents affecting critical infrastructure\n\n 3.4.1 Social engineering at large companies\n\n**Incident**\nIn May 2014 high-ranking employees of several\n###### internationally operating large companies were\ntargeted by particularly sophisticated phishing\ne-mails.\n\n**Method**\nBogus e-mails informed the employees that, due\nto an update of the personnel department’s IT\nsystems it was suspected that there could be inconsistencies in some data sets. On this pretext\nthe recipients were asked to send a copy of their\n###### of cial photo ID and the details of the bank\naccount into which their salaries were paid. The\ne-mails were in virtually perfect German or English and came complete with a full mail history\nplus e-mail headers featuring authentic company\ne-mail addresses designed to lend apparent legit###### imacy to the process. A noteworthy point was\nthat the employees mentioned in the fake history\nwere actually employed in the various personnel\ndepartments.\n\n\n###### 3.4.2 Austria: malfunction in the controlling of energy grids\n\n**Incident**\n###### In 2013 anomalies were detected in the data\nstreams in several Austrian control networks for\nthe management of energy grids. These caused\nmalfunctions for grid and power station operators\nas well as a number of data transmission disruptions.\n\n\n**Impact**\n\nSome of the recipients took the e-mail to be authentic and transmitted the requested document copies\nand account details to the sender, whereupon the\n###### attackers closed the victim’s bank accounts by\npost, using counterfeit signatures or ordered new\nelectronic cash cards and PINs to be sent to a new\naddress in China.\n\n**Target groups**\n\nSenior employees of major German companies.\n\n**Technical capabilities**\nThe expense and effort involved in planning and\n###### researching an attack of this kind is estimated to be very high, so it must be assumed that the\nattackers are extremely experienced. The near\nperfect German used is noteworthy, being a feature which distinguishes this attack from many\nothers of this type.\n\n\n**Method**\nIt is suspected that the malfunction was triggered\nby a command during commissioning a gas grid\n###### operator in southern Germany which also extended to the Austrian energy grid. This was then\npassed on to various different operators. Due to\nthe unspecified processing of this message in individual network components the command was\nsent as an infinite loop, thereby triggering serious\ndisruption of the grid management control.\n\n**Impact**\nDuring the incident the grid’s stability could only\nbe maintained at great expense. During the disrup###### tion considerable volumes of data were created,\nleading to log data overflows. Accordingly it has not\n###### yet been possible to finally determine the cause\nof the incident.\n\n**Target group**\nEnergy grid operators\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Overview: causes and effects of security threats and incidents\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4 Solutions\n\n#### Solutions\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4 Solutions\n\nSolutions for improving the risk situ a tion in cyberspace must focus on the development of measures\ndesigned for specific target groups, as well as supporting both businesses and private individuals in\nprotecting themselves. A key feature of these measures must be scalability in order to be able to select\nappropriate measures to protect everyone from individuals to large organisations. From the aforementioned security threats and challenges posed by the\ncurrent IT landscape the following spheres of action\nmay be derived:\n\n\nproducts. IT security can be an important factor\nin carving out a strong competitive position in\nthe major markets of the future. One example of a\ntechnology of this sort, designed and promoted by\nthe BSI, is the SINA product family. SINA provides IT-supported ‘secure stations’ which permit\nthe risk-free use of market leaders’ applications\ndespite a deficit of trust.\n\nGerman e-mail providers have joined forces for\n###### a campaign promoting a trustworthy e-mail\nservice – ‘E-mail Made in Germany’. Initiatives like\nthis can be supported by standardising suitable\nsecurity and trustworthiness requirements and\nawarding a corresponding certificate.\n\nIn the fast-moving IT world even the most up-todate activities must always keep one eye on the\nfuture. For instance, there is a need for stronger\nsecurity mechanisms to be integrated into smartphones given the prospect of them being more\nintensively used for payment and money transfer\n###### purposes in the future. A key requirement for\nguaranteeing information security is the deploy###### ment of effective and reliable security mechanisms at technical level. Fields not yet embraced\nby this report, such as e-health, smart cities and\nautomotive with partial reference to safety (safety\n###### of life and limb) may in future be subject to\nhigher security requirements. Further challenges\nin prospect are crypto- and cyber technologies,\ncloud solutions, security technologies to protect\nIndustrial Control Systems and the development\nof intelligent networks (SDN).\n\n\n###### 4.1 Promoting expertise and trustworthiness in the field of IT security\n\nA key requirement for guaranteeing information\nsecurity is the deployment of effective and reliable security mechanisms on a technical level,\nbecause despite thorough reviews and examinations, manipulation of IT components cannot\nbe entirely ruled out. Accordingly, promoting the\nprovision of thrustworthy information technology is a central pillar in ensuring a high level of\nIT security in Germany. This is also significant in\nlight of the recent debate on the cyber activities\nof foreign intelligence agencies.\n\n\nEssentially, cooperative efforts of the government,\nbusiness and research communities should focus\n###### on the following strategic objectives:\n\n ∙  Protecting fundamental values in the digital\nworld by safeguarding our technological capacity\nto act and promoting trustworthy information\ntechnology.\n\n∙  Creating market conditions and incentives conducive to persuading foreign market leaders to\nadapt their products at technical level via trust\nanchors (such as national cryptocomponents) to\n###### German trustworthiness expectations, in par- ticular where security requirements are high.\n\n\n∙  Empowering the German economy to combine\nits core industrial skills with the existing expertise\nin Germany in the field of information security in\norder to ensure the implementation of the necessary IT security standards in central economic\nsectors.\n\n###### Among the key success factors are the development of sustainable business models designed to\n###### ensure the long-term market success of these\n\n\n###### 4.2 Commitment to standardisation and certification\n\n Standardisation and certification are effective\ntools for increasing transparency in the field of\ninformation security, raising the trustworthiness of\nproducts and services and forcing up information\nsecurity levels throughout the economy. In the\nfield of IT security Germany already possesses\nan effective certification scheme and internationally renowned auditing bodies.\n\nDespite this, redoubled efforts will be called for\n###### in order to successfully safeguard Germany’s\nleading position and confront new technological\nchallenges. Currently there are shortcomings\nin Germany’s representation on international\nstandardisation bodies. Leading information and\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunication technology companies frequently\nattempt to impose their own proprietary stand###### ards on international standardisation committees in order to gain a competitive advantage. This\n###### results in security standards which often fall far short of what is advisable from an information\ntechnology viewpoint.\n\nAccordingly there needs to be stronger coordination of industry and government commitment\nto IT standardisation, with special reference to\nIT security and particular focus on technological\n###### transparency and the application of open\nstandards.\n\n\n###### 4.3 Promoting IT security in society and the widespread use of secure technologies\n\nA vital requirement for the effective use of secur###### ity technology is raising users’ awareness of IT\nthreats. All users are responsible for their own IT\n###### and must therefore also take responsibility for\nsecurity measures. Only by acting on their own\ninitiative users can protect themselves from some\n###### of the threats discussed in chapter 2. In its capacity as the national IT security agency the BSI\nprovides a range of support for the various target\ngroups.[20]\n\n\nThe federal government is already actively working on the specification of IT security standards,\nfor instance in the form of technical guidelines\nand BSI standards, in fields where security is critical, with a view to promoting the development\nof national best-practice solutions. For instance,\nthe BSI is assisting in the implementation of the\n###### German Energy Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz)\nby cooperating with measurement system manu###### factures in the energy industry on the development of protection profiles and technical guidelines for intelligent measurement systems on the\nsmart grid of the future. These technical standards\n###### are being developed in collaboration with the\nentire industry and are embodied in the VDE/FNN\nrequirements for the Measurement System 2020.\n\n###### Current market analyses forecast that demand\nfor services to defend against cyber attacks is set\n###### to grow further. In view of the likely establishment of national cyber security service providers\n###### it makes sense to put in place a system for the\ncertification of the companies in question as proof\nof their expertise and trustworthiness. In certain\n###### fields such as information security auditing,\nadvice and penetration testing the BSI is already\ncertifying service providers.\n\n\nAnother key requirement for increasing IT secur###### ity in Germany is the use of more secure and\nmore reliable technologies. From an information\ntechnology viewpoint the development, provision\nand universal application of trust worthy crypto\n###### and cyber technologies for all target groups is\nof decisive importance in order to min imise the\nrisks posed by critical security threats.\n\nTo this end it will be essential to provide scalable\ncyber security options which facilitate the provision of levels of protection adjusted to the specific\nneeds of the target group in question. Given that\nover 80 per cent of all cyber threats can be warded\noff simply by taking basic security measures, it is\nnecessary to make basic technologies available to\nprivate individuals and SMEs, thereby allowing\nthem to contribute to enhancing cyber security.\nIn this connection it will also be necessary to provide overall solutions which, in conjunction with\ncrypto- and cyber security mechanisms, provide\nprotection against threats at different levels.\n\n\nIn the manufacturing sector there is a need for an\nincreased involvement in the important OPC UA\nindustry standard (a central protocol in connection with Industry 4.0), one of the key future fields\n###### in enabling German industry to position itself both as user and provider. The BSI is working together with a leading sectoral association on\nstandards for secure data transmission.\n\n\nThrough the structural options it has implemented,\nfor instance in the shape of De-Mail, the federal\n###### government has for the first time created a universal public key infrastructure in Germany. The\n###### solution will in future support both transport\nencryption and end-to-end encryption. Currently\nover 90 per cent of all e-mails are transmitted in\nunencrypted form. Furthermore, the two-factorauthentication process means that De-Mail offers\nsecurity mechanisms against identity theft, which\n###### is often successful due to the fact that many\nproviders use the standard software-supported\npassword procedure.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Another indirect promotion of IT security in\nsociety is the continuous security analysis of universally used open-source IT secur ity and crypto###### libraries as well as the ongoing development and maintenance of their security. This allows\nvulnerabilities such as Heartbleed, with its wide###### spread impact, to be virtually eradicated and brings about a sustained improvement in the\nsecurity characteristics of these software libraries.\n\nIn this context the business world has a respon###### sibility to come up with IT security solutions.\nProviders could make easy-to-operate IT security\nsolutions available to their customers across the\n###### board. A key success factor here would be the\nvirtually complete automation of the process of\n###### setting up security functionality. Online providers too could provide individuals with greater\n###### protection, for instance by introducing multifactor authentication systems to protect them\nfrom identity theft.\n\n\n∙ Increased attention to Industrial Control Sys###### tems security by Computer Emergency Response\nTeams (CERTs).\n\n∙  The development of security profiles specially\ntailored to Industrial Control Systems at both\nsystem and product levels as well as the devising\nof technology-specific minimum standards.\n\n∙  More intense analysis of attacks on clouds and\ndevelopment of security standards and measures.\n\n\nHowever, the business world too can fall victim\nto cyber attacks, particularly in the form of cyberespionage. Accordingly, mechanisms need to be\n###### developed and universally applied which will\nprovide adequate protection against high-grade\n###### forms of attack such as Advanced Persistent\nThreats (APTs). To this end, close collaboration\nbetween government, business and science are\ncalled for in order to allow the earliest possible\ndetection of attacks and attack forms and compile a joint situation assessment and share this\nknow ledge, including defence mechanisms, as\n###### it already happens in the CERT association.\nAnother central cooperation platform for government and industry is the Alliance for Cyber\nSecurity, which around 1,000 companies and\ninstitutions have now joined and which has come\nup with 180 concrete recommendations. The\ndevelopment of such voluntary models is vital to\nensuring the rapid sharing of information faced\nwith a world of dynamically changing technology\nand circumstances in order to quickly come up\nwith pragmatic security solutions and defensive\nmeasures.\n\nOur current knowledge of ICS attacks, with Stuxnet\nbeing the starting point, have put the spotlight\non the security of Industrial Control Systems and\nindicates that greater attention will have to be\n###### devoted to this issue in future. In order to tackle this threat the following measures in particular\nmust be addressed:\n\n\n###### 4.4 Guaranteeing critical infrastruc- ture protection\n\nOperators of critical infrastructure have a duty to\nmaintain minimum IT security standards due to\nthe potentially far-reaching societal consequences\n###### of a breakdown or failure of infrastructure provision and their consequent responsibility for the\ncommon good.\n\n\n###### The federal government maintains especially\nclose relationships with these operators. In 2007\nthe UP KRITIS association was formed as a cooperation between the government and the critical\ninfrastructure industry.\n\nIn light of the developing security threats since\n###### 2011 there is a need to further strengthen the\nworking relationship between the government\nand critical infrastructure operators. UP KRITIS\nhas been upgraded in terms of content and struc###### ture, allowing it to become significantly more\ndeeply involved in the critical infrastructure sector. The IT security bill drawn up by the Federal\nMinistry of the Interior provides among other\nthings for minimum standards and reporting\nduties to which operators of critical infrastructure should be subject. These reports will be used\n###### to compile a situation assessment which will\nbe made available to the companies concerned.\n###### Simultaneously the reported incidents can be\nused as the basis for reinforcing and optimising\nthe support and advice provided for companies\nby the BSI. That way the BSI will be in a position\nto provide critical infrastructure operators with\n###### more effective support in the event of an IT secur ity incident.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5 Glossary and list of abbreviations\n\n\n**Advanced Persistent Threats**\n\nAdvanced persistent threats (APT) are targeted cyber attacks on\nselected institutions in which the attackers gain persistent longterm access to the victim network and then widen the attack to\n\nadditional systems. The attacks involve the deployment of major\n\nresources and considerable technical skill on the attackers’ part\nand are generally difficult to detect.\n\n**Adware**\n\n\n**Bürger-CERT**\n\nThe Bürger-CERT (see CERT/Computer Emergency Response\n[Team) of the BSI (www.buerger-cert.de) warns citizens and SMEs](http://www.buerger-cert.de)\n\n\n**Cloud/cloud computing**\nCloud computing refers to offering, using and charging for IT\nservices over the Internet. The services provided can be rapidly\nadapted to changing needs. These services are offered and used\nexclusively via defined interfaces and protocols. The range of\nservices offered under cloud computing embraces the entire\nspectrum of information technology, including infrastructure\n(e.g. computing power, memory), platforms and software.\n\n**Command-and-control server**\n\n\nrapidly and expertly about malware and vulnerabilities in com\nputer applications and provides information on security updates.\n\n\nAdware are programs which finance themselves via advertising.\nMalware programs which serve advertising purposes are also\ndescribed as adware. When adware is downloaded programs are\ngenerally installed which perform espionage functions. In most\ncases you are notified of this in the license and conditions of use.\n\n**Application/app**\n\n\nAn application, or app for short, is a piece of user software. The\nterm is frequently used in connection with applications for smartphones or tablets.\n\n**Attack vector**\n\n\nCritical infrastructure means institutions and enterprises of\n\nparticular importance for the common good of a country whose\nbreakdown or impairment would lead to long-term supply\nbottlenecks, significant disruption of public security or other\ndramatic consequences.\n\n\nSee ‘Bot & botnet’.\n\n**Critical infrastructure/KRITIS**\n\n\nAttack vector denotes the combination of attack routes and\ntechniques whereby the attacker gains access to IT systems.\n\n**Bot & botnet**\n\n\nA botnet is a collection of computer systems which have been\nattacked by a remotely controllable malware program known as\na bot. The affected systems are controlled by the botnet operator\nvia a command-and-control server (C&C server).\n\n**Bring Your Own Device**\n\n\n**Critical infrastructure sectors**\n\nCurrently, nine sectors in Germany have been defined as critical\ninfrastructure: Transport and traffic, Energy, Information technology and telecommunication, Finance and insurance industries,\nGovernment and public administration, Nutrition, Water, Health,\nMedia and culture.\n\n\nBring Your Own Device (BYOD) denotes the use of private devices\nfor professional purposes and their integration into company\nnetworks.\n\n**CERT/Computer Emergency Response Team**\n\n\n**DNS**\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) assigns the names used on\n[the Internet, such as www.bsi.bund.de, and the associated IP](http://www.bsi.bund.de)\naddresses.\n\n\nComputer emergency team made up of IT specialists. Many\ncompanies and institutions have now established CERTs to take\ncare of defending against cyber attacks and preventing IT security\nincidents and responding to them should they happen.\n\n**CERT-Bund**\n\n\nCERT-Bund (Computer Emergency Response Team of the Federal\nGovernment) is a unit of BSI which functions as the central coordinating body for the government department for both preventive and reactive measures in relation to security-related incidents\naffecting computer systems.\n\n**CERT Association (CERT-Verbund)**\n\n\n**Dos & DDos attacks**\n\nDenial of service (Dos) attacks are directed at the availability of\nservices, websites, individual systems or entire networks. If such\nan attack is launched in parallel by several systems this is known\nas a distributed denial of service (DDos) attack. DDos attacks\nfrequently involve very large numbers of computers or servers.\n\n\n**Drive-by download/drive-by exploits**\n\nDrive-by exploits involve the automated exploitation of vulnerabilities. When a PC user visits a website infected with drive-by\nexploit vulnerabilities in the Web browser, in browser plug-ins or\nin the operating system are exploited in order to install malware\nundetected on the PC without any interaction on the users’ part.\n\n\nThe German CERT Association is an alliance of several German\nCERTs at companies and in government departments.\n\n\n-----\n\n**End-to-end encryption**\n\nTo send particularly sensitive information securely by e-mail both\nthe transport channel and the e-mail content can be encrypted.\nTo use end-to-end encryption both the sender and the recipient\nrequire encryption software suitable for the message which must\nbe installed on both computers.\n\n**Exploit kit**\nExploit kits (aka exploit packs) are tools for cyber attacks which\nare placed on legitimate websites. A variety of different exploits\nare used in an automated attempt to detect and exploit a vulnerability in a Web browser or plug-in in order to to install malware.\n\n**ICT**\n\nShort for ‘Information and communication technology’. This\nrefers to the entirety of information technology, communication\ntechnology and their interactions, for instance in the form of\ncommunication networks.\n\n**Identity theft**\n\nIdentity theft or misuse involves the acquisition and unauthorised use by third parties of personal data such as postal and e-mail\naddresses, dates of birth, bank account or credit card numbers.\nThe attackers’ aim is generally to gain a financial advantage using\nthe confidential information, or more rarely to discredit the person whose details have been stolen. Identity theft is chiefly done\nvia social engineering, malware on infected systems or data theft\nafter hacking of online services.\n\n\n**Log data & log file**\n\nA log file contains the record of actions and processes on a\ncomputer.\n\n**NTP**\n\nThe Network Time Protocol (NTP) performs the time synchronisation of IT systems in networks.\n\n\n**Industrial Control System (ICS)**\n\nSystems for automating production process are known as\nIndustrial Control Systems (ICS).\n\n**Industry 4.0**\n\nIndustry 4.0 is an umbrella term for the merging of the real and\nvirtual worlds into an Internet of things, with the focus on the\nfuture shape of industrial production and logistics. It will involve\n\nthe interconnection of systems right across a business, both intern ally and externally: machines, sensors, production facilities,\nmarketing, sales, procurement and logistics.\n\n**Internet of things**\n\nBy Internet of things we mean the linking up of clearly identifiable physical objects with their virtual representations in an\nInternet-like structure via an embedded electronic chip.\n\n**IS audit**\n\n\nInformation security audits are a key component of any success\nful information security management system. Only regular checks\n\non established security systems and information security processes can ensure their effective implementation, up-to-dateness,\ncompleteness and appropriateness, and therefore the current\nstate of your information security. The IS audit is thus a tool for\ndetermining, achieving and maintaining an acceptable level of\nsecurity in an institution.\n\n\n**NTP reflection**\n\nThis is a specific kind of DDos attack. In a reflection attack the\nvictim’s system is not directly attacked. Instead the attacker operates via reflection, sending a simple query carrying the falsified\nsender address of the victim’s system to the target system. Due to\nthe falsified address the answer to the attacker’s query is then sent\nnot to the attacker’s system but to the victim’s. The answer to the\nquery will be significantly larger than the query itself, and as a\nresult the attacker is able to generate a lot of attack bandwidth\nwithout expending much of their own bandwidth. We refer to this\nas the amplification of the bandwidth used.\n\n**OpenSSL**\n\nOpenSSL is a free software library which implements encryption\nprotocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n\n**Patch/patch management**\n\nA patch is a software package which software manufacturers create\n\nin order to eradicate vulnerabilities in their programs, or make\nother improvements. Many programs offer an automated update\nfunction to facilitate the downloading of these updates. Patch\nmanagement refers to processes and procedures to ensure that an\nIT system receives available patches as quickly as possible.\n\n**Penetration test**\n\nA penetration test is a controlled attempt to infiltrate a given computer system or network in order to try and identify vulnerabilities. For the purpose the same or similar techniques are deployed\n\nas would be used in a real attack. Their aim is to assess the prospect\n\nof a real attack succeeding, thereby assessing the efficacy of the\nexisting security measures and determining whether there is a\nneed for additional security measures.\n\n**Phishing**\n\nThe term ‘phishing’ is a blend of the words ‘password’ and\n‘fishing’, i.e. going fishing for passwords. The attacker attempts\nvia bogus websites, e-mails or text messages to extract personal\n\ndata from an Internet user and thus commit identity theft.\n\n**Plug-in**\nA plug-in is an extra piece of software or a software module which\ncan be integrated into a computer program in order to extend its\nfunctionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransomware**\nRansomware is malware, with the help of which an attacker\nprevents access to or the use of data or entire computer systems.\nThe usual purpose of this is to extort money (the ‘ransom’).\n\n**Shell**\n\nA shell is software which functions as the interface between\npeople and a machine. In normal usage the word shell has come\nto mean both the command line interpreter and graphic user\ninterfaces such as Windows Explorer or the Apple Finder.\n\n**Social Engineering**\nIn cyber attacks using social engineering criminals attempt to\ninduce their victims to disclose data of their own free will, cir\ncumvent protective measures and willingly install malicious code\n\non their systems. Just like in the field of espionage, cybercrim \ninals skilfully exploit human weaknesses such as curiosity to gain\n\naccess to sensitive data and information.\n\n**Spam**\n\n\nSpam is defined as unwanted messages sent en masse and in an\nuntargeted fashion via e-mail or other communication services.\nIn harmless variants spam messages generally contain unsolicited\nadvertising. However, spam often comes with attachments containing malware, links to infected websites or is used for phishing\nattacks.\n\n**SSH**\n\nSSH stands for Secure Shell, an application allowing the establishment of an encrypted network connection to a remote device.\n\n**SSL/TLS**\n\nTLS stands for Transport Layer Security, an encryption protocol for\n\nthe secure transmission of data over the Internet. Its predecessor\nwas SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).\n\n\n**Twitter**\nTwitter is a real-time digital application for sending short\nmessages.\n\n**UP KRITIS**\n\n[UP KRITIS (www.upkritis.de) is a public-private collaborative ini-](http://www.upkritis.de)\ntiative between critical infrastructure operators, their professional\nassociations and the relevant government agencies.\n\n**VDE**\n\nStands for Verband der Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik e. V. (Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information\nTechnologies).\n\n**Watering hole attacks**\n\nThe analogy is to a watering hole which attracts prey animals\nand is thus also frequented by their hunters. In this type of attack\nwebsites which are highly likely to be visited by a target individual\nare first hacked into and infected with malware.
