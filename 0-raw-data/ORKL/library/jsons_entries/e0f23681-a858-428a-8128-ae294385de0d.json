These activities include spreading further throughout the network, stealing data,\ninstalling point-of-sale (POS) malware to harvest credit cards, installing backdoors for\nfurther access, or deploy ransomware.\n\nThe use of Windows Remote Desktop Services to breach networks is so pervasive that the\nFBI has stated that [RDP is responsible for 70-80% of all network breaches leading to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-says-140-million-paid-to-ransomware-offers-defense-tips/)\nransomware attacks.\n\nWhile all ransomware groups utilize RDP to some extent, one ransomware group known as\nDharma is [known to predominantly use remote desktop to gain a foothold in corporate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-hackers-attack-exposed-rdp-servers-to-deploy-dharma-ransomware/)\nnetworks.\n\n## UAS, the largest marketplace for RDP credentials\n\nUAS, or 'Ultimate Anonymity Services,' is a marketplace that sells Windows Remote\nDesktop login credentials, stolen Social Security Numbers, and access to SOCKS proxy\nservers.\n\nWhat makes UAS stand out is that it is the largest such marketplace, performs manual\nverification of sold RDP account credentials, offers customer support, and provides tips on\nhow to retain remote access to a compromised computer.\n\n\"The market functions partially like eBay - a number of Suppliers work with the market. They\nhave a separate place to log in and upload the RDPs they hacked. The system will then\nverify them, collect information about each one (os, admin access? internet speed, cpu,\nmemory etc etc), which is added to the listing.\"\n\n\"The supplier interface provides real time stats for the suppliers (what sold, what didn't,\nwhat was sold but a refund was asked for, etc).\"\n\n\"They also provide support if for some reason what you bought doesn't work. They do take\ncustomer support seriously,\" a security researcher who wishes to remain anonymous told\nBleepingComputer.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen purchasing stolen RDP accounts, threat actors can search for compromised devices\nin a particular country, state, city, zip code, ISP, or operating system, allowing them to find\nthe specific server they need.\n\n**RDP servers currently sold on the UAS marketplace**\nPotential buyers can dig down deeper on each server to see the number of Windows\naccounts, the Internet connection speed, the server's hardware, and more, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**RDP server specs for potential buyers**\nBleepingComputer was told that the marketplace will not sell any servers located in Russia\nor a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country and runs a script that\nautomatically removes any that are found.\n\nEven with this filtering of servers, UAS is currently selling a massive 23,706 RDP\ncredentials.\n\n## Secretly monitoring the UAS marketplace\n\nSince December 2018, a group of security researchers have had secret access to the\ndatabase for the UAS marketplace and have been quietly collecting sold RDP credentials\nfor almost three years.\n\nDuring this time period, the researchers have collected the IP addresses, usernames, and\npasswords, for 1,379,609 RDP accounts that have been sold at UAS since the end of 2018.\n\n[This database had been shared with Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, who also shared a](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nredacted copy with BleepingComputer to review.\n\nWhile we will not be listing any of the companies found in the database, we can say that the\nlisted RDP servers are from all over the world, including government agencies from sixtythree countries, with Brazil, India, and the United States being the top three.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are also RDPs servers for many well-known, high-profile companies, with many\nservers from the healthcare industry.\n\nFurthermore, BleepingComputer has found many RDP servers in the database that belong\nto organizations known to have suffered ransomware attacks over the past two years.\n\nAfter analyzing the 1.3 million accounts in the database, BleepingComputer has pulled out\nsome interesting data that should be useful for all computer users and network admins:\n\nThe top five login names found in the sold RDP servers are 'Administrator', 'Admin',\n'User', 'test', and 'scanner'.\nThe top five passwords used by the RDP servers are '123456', '123', 'P@ssw0rd',\n'1234', and 'Password1'.\nThe top five represented countries in the database are United States, China, Brazil,\n**Germany, India, and the United Kingdom.**\n\nMore complete stats are found at the end of the article.\n\n### RDPwned: Checking if your RDP is compromised\n\n[Vitali Kremez has launched a new service called RDPwned that allows companies and their](https://rdpwned.adv-gate.com/)\nadmins to check if their servers are listed in the database.\n\n\"The marketplace is tied to a number of high-profile breaches and ransomware cases\nacross the globe. A number of ransomware groups are known to purchase initial access on\nUAS. This treasure trove of adversary-space data provides a lens into the cybercrime\necosystem, and confirm that low hanging fruit, such as poor passwords, and internetexposed RDP remain one of the leading causes of breaches,\"\n\n\"RDPwned will also help illuminate old breaches for which they never figured out initial\naccess. For others, it will give them a chance to resolve the security problem before it\nbecomes a breach,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\nTo use the service, Kremez told BleepingComputer that companies would need to submit\ncontact information from an executive or admin of the company, which Advanced Intel will\nvet.\n\nOnce the user's identity is verified, Advanced Intel will confirm if their company's servers are\nlisted in RDPwned.\n\nVisitors can perform this lookup via reverse DNS, IP addresses, and domain names.\n\n## Further statistics\n\nBelow are additional statistics showing the top 20 login names, top 20 passwords, and top\n10 countries found in the 1 3 million RDP servers that UAS has listed on the marketplace\n\n\n-----\n\n### Top 20 login names\n\n**Used login name** **Total accounts**\n\n**Administrator** 303,702\n\n**Admin** 59,034\n\n**User** 45,096\n\n**test** 30,702\n\n**scanner** 20,876\n\n**scan** 16,087\n\n**Guest** 12,923\n\n**IME_ADMIN** 9,955\n\n**user1** 8,631\n\n**Administrador** 8,612\n\n**Trader** 8,608\n\n**postgres** 5,853\n\n**IME_USER** 5,667\n\n**Usuario** 5,236\n\n**user2** 4,055\n\n**Passv** 3,989\n\n**testuser** 3,969\n\n**test1** 3,888\n\n**server** 3,754\n\n**student** 3,592\n\n**reception** 3,482\n\n**backup** 3,356\n\n**openpgsvc** 3,339\n\n**info** 3,156\n\n\n-----\n\n**VPN** 3,139\n\n### Top 20 passwords\n\n**Used password** **Total accounts**\n\n**123456** 71,639\n\n**123** 50,449\n\n**P@ssw0rd** 47,139\n\n**1234** 34,825\n\n**Password1** 27,007\n\n**1** 24,955\n\n**password** 19,148\n\n**12345** 16,522\n\n**admin** 15,587\n\n**ffff-ffc0M456x (see note)** 15,114\n\n**Admin@123** 13,572\n\n**User** 13,437\n\n**scanner** 13,193\n\n**scan** 10,409\n\n**test** 10,169\n\n**Aa123456** 9,399\n\n**Password123** 8,756\n\n**12345678** 8,647\n\n**Admin123** 8,214\n\n**Passw0rd** 7,817\n\n**admin,.123!@#$%^** 7,027\n\n**1qaz@WSX** 6,248\n\n**Welcome1** 5,962\n\n\n-----\n\n**P@ssword64** 5,522\n\n**abc@123** 4,958\n\n_Note: The 'ffff-ffc0M456x' password appears to be a default password configured by the_\n_MailEnable setup program for remote access.
