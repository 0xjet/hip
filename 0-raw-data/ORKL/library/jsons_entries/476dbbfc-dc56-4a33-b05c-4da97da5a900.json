Your President should not have commited war crimes. If\nyou're searching for someone to blame for your current situation look no further than\nVladimir Putin,\" reads the NB65 ransomware note displayed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom**\n\n**note for NB65 ransomware**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nA representative for the NB65 hacking group told BleepingComputer that they based their\nencryptor on the first Conti source code leak but modified it for each victim so that existing\ndecryptors would not work.\n\n\"It's been modified in a way that all versions of Conti's decryptor won't work. Each\ndeployment generates a randomized key based off of a couple variables that we change for\neach target,\" NB65 told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"There's really no way to decrypt without making contact with us.\"\n\nAt this time, NB65 has not received any communications from their victims and told us that\nthey were not expecting any.\n\nAs for NB65's reasons for attacking Russian organizations, we will let them speak for\nthemselves.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter Bucha we elected to target certain companies, that may be civilian owned, but\nstill would have an impact on Russias ability to operate normally. The Russian\npopular support for Putin's war crimes is overwhelming. From the very beginning we\nmade it clear. We're supporting Ukraine. We will honor our word. When Russia\nceases all hostilities in Ukraine and ends this ridiculous war NB65 will stop attacking\nRussian internet facing assets and companies.\n\nUntil then, fuck em.\n\nWe will not be hitting any targets outside of Russia. Groups like Conti and\nSandworm, along with other Russian APTs have been hitting the west for years with\nransomware, supply chain hits (Solarwinds or defense contractors)... We figured it\nwas time for them to deal with that themselves.\"\n\n[NB65 further stated on Monday that they will never target organizations outside of Russia,](https://twitter.com/xxNB65/status/1513593777759428624)\nand any ransom payments will be donated to Ukraine.\n\n_Update 4/11/22: Added updated about how ransoms would be used_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 15th 2022 - Encrypting Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-15th-2022-encrypting-russia/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Hackers display “blood is on your hands\" on Russian TV, take down RuTube](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-display-blood-is-on-your-hands-on-russian-tv-take-down-rutube/)\n\n[Microsoft says Russia hit Ukraine with hundreds of cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-says-russia-hit-ukraine-with-hundreds-of-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/conti/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[NB65](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nb65/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russia/)\n[Source Code](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/source-code/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
