In this report,\nwe document the RAT manager/builder, client malware, and profile the Swedish actor behind\nthis together with his promotion and sale of his malware. We also document this RAT already\nbeing used in malicious attacks in the wild.\n\n## Promoting his RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the first week of September 2019, the actor started promoting his new RAT on several\nunderground forums (Figure 1), using the handles Speccy and Rafiki. The succinct posts\nshared a link to his sales site blackremote[.]pro, and his discord handle Speccy#0100.\n\n_Figure 1. RAT promoted on forums_\n\n[During the same week, he posted a YouTube video (Figure 2), with instructions for setting up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TexdJiioPLA)\nhis RAT.\n\n_Figure 2. YouTube \"how-to\" video_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe YouTube description (Figure 3) included a link to his personal site speccy[.]dev. It also\nincluded the claim “this rat is fully runtime undetected” and a link to “purchase FUD crypter.”\nThere is no legitimate reason for this software to need to be “undetectable” or “crypted.”\nRather, such efforts are intended to prevent detection by antimalware software.\n\n_Figure 3. YouTube description_\n\n## blackremote[.]pro\n\nThe sales site for Blackremote RAT, blackremote[.]pro (Figure 4), was registered on August\n19, 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. blackremote[.]pro_\n\nSpeccy describes his RAT:\n\n_“Black Remote Controller PRO is a powerful and full featured systems remote admnistration_\n_suite. It will give you full access and control over a remote machine through a countless_\n_number of features, giving you the ability to monitor, access or manipulate every activity and_\n_data remotely, just like you are in front of it!”_\n\nAs is typical with other malicious RATs promoted at the same underground forums, Speccy\nclaims legitimate purpose:\n\n_“This tool is ideal for everyone who necessitate to access, monitor or operate remotely on a_\n_given system for a wide and various range of needs, administration professionals, parental_\n_control, forensics, sourveillance [sic], remote assistance. Black will become for you an_\n_incredible tool to achieve everything remotely.”_\n\nHowever, the previously mentioned claims of being “undetectable” and references to\ncrypting, together with features such as “Password Recovery” and his “Fun Features” (Figure\n5) advertising (“We all know sometimes things may get boring, expecially [sic] in professional\n_and tech environment“ … “Black Remote Controller may become also a funny tool for jokes,_\n_why not?”) are hardly in keeping with a tool designed for legitimate purpose._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. \"Fun Features\"_\n\nSpeccy licenses (Figure 6) his RAT at a comparatively high price compared to other\ncommodity RATs. With $49 for a 31-day license, $117 for 93 days, and $438 for one year.\n\n_Figure 6. Purchase_\n\nThe purchase itself is through various cryptocurrencies, using third-party payment service\nvsell[.]io (Figure 7).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. vSell_\n\n## Features\n\nThe site lists the features of this RAT in detail:\n\n_“Remote Desktop_\n\n_Watch the Remote Desktop Live at incredible low latency, take shots or activate video_\n\n_recording to .avi files.

Manager / builder registration / login_\n\nUpon loading the manager / builder, the user is given a registration / login screen (Figure 8).\nBlackremote utilizes the third-party “CodeVEST” licensing system, also peddled on\nunderground forums. The licensing system validates by connecting to codevest[.]sh.\n“CodeVEST” seems to take the place of “Netseal” as a registration service used by\ncommodity malware. The author of “Netseal”, Taylor Huddleston, was charged in 2017 for\nthat operation together with the sale of his own commodity malware, “Nanocore RAT.” The\nsame person who offers the “Codevest” licensing service, also profits from a crypting service\n“Cyber Seal”. This highlights the role in the commodity malware ecosystem of not only the\nmalware sellers, but also service providers such as the licensing services they use, and the\ncrypting services they purchase to avoid detection of the malware that they build.\n\n_Figure 9. CodeVEST_\n\nThe Blackremote manager / builder (Figure 10) allows the user to build new client malware to\ntheir configuration, and to control connections from those infected clients.\n\n_Figure 10. Blackremote Manager / Builder_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe manager / builder allows the user to define actions-upon-connect for client connections\n(Figure 11), a connection log (Figure 12), and the ability to list (Figure 13) and interact with\nconnected clients.\n\n_Figure 11. On-connect options_\n\n_Figure 12. Connection log_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Active connections_\n\nThe client-control features advertised by Speccy are exposed in the context menu for\nconnected clients (Figure 14).\n\n_Figure 14. Client control_\n\nSpeccy is actively developing this software. The changelog shows incremental\nimprovements on a regular basis, such as the newly-added client privilege escalation (Figure\n15).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15. Change log_\n\n## Client\n\nWe note that different samples from similar time periods have been observed with identical\nfile sizes. We suspect that regardless of dynamic content, such as C2 information or differing\nRAT options, that the obfuscation process in the building of the client may make all clients of\na specific Blackremote version level identical in file size.\n\nBoth the builder and client are heavily protected, using more than one obfuscator (\nAgile.NET, Babel .NET, Crypto Obfuscator, Dotfuscator, Goliath.NET, SmartAssembly,\nSpices.Net, Xenocode).\n\n## In the Wild\n\nAlthough Blackremote is very new, as of the time of this report we are already seeing it used\nin attacks. A month after Speccy started selling Blackremote RAT, we have almost 50\nsamples observed in more than 2,200 attack sessions against Palo Alto Networks\ncustomers.\n\n## A Customer\n\nInterestingly, just one campaign seems to be responsible for the vast majority of those\nattacks. The file doc00190910.exe (SHA256:\n2b3cda455f68a9bbbeb1c2881b30f1ee962f1c136af97bdf47d8c9618b980572), was spread\nby email, peaking September 9-11, 2019. It targeted Palo Alto Networks customers in varied\nverticals (Figure 16), worldwide. It uses renaj.duckdns[.]org (103.200.6[.]79) as a Commandand-Control (C2) server. We observed this used in over 1800 attack sessions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Campaign victim verticals_\n\nThe same C2 has been observed being used by the actor in over 50 Netwire, Nanocore,\nQuasar, and Remcos commodity RAT samples back to early 2018.\n\nThis is a clear illustration of how the authors of commodity RATs such as Blackremote profit,\nwhile enabling malicious cyber attacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCommodity RATs are often sold on the internet for years, their authors profiting while\nenabling malicious actors to spread thousands of samples of malware, built with their RAT\nbuilders.\n\nThe opportunity to document a RAT within days of its emergence, and to identify the\nindividual behind it – in this case, an 18-year-old from Sweden, will hopefully enable\nauthorities to take timely action against this actor, and his customers. Unit 42 has fully\nidentified this actor; we will not share his identity here, but we have ensured that the correct\nauthorities have been advised. The longer this is sold, not only the more samples of this RAT\nwill be built and spread, but also the opportunity for other actors to crack this RAT and\ndistribute it indiscriminately. It is important to identify and interdict the sale of such malware\nas early as possible to prevent its proliferation, which enables a large population of\nunsophisticated threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration, and up-to-date\nWindows hosts have a much lower risk of infection. Palo Alto Networks customers are further\nprotected from this threat. Our threat prevention platform detects Blackremote malware, with\nWildfire and Traps.
