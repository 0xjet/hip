Cybersecurity researchers commonly use this program when\nanalyzing .NET malware and software.\n\nWhile the software is no longer actively developed by the initial developers, the original\nsource code and a new [actively developed version is available on GitHub to be cloned and](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy)\nmodified by anyone.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious dnSpy delivers a cocktail of malware\n\nThis week, a threat actor created a GitHub repository with a compiled version of dnSpy that\ninstalls a cocktail of malware, including clipboard hijackers to steal cryptocurrency, the\nQuasar remote access trojan, a miner, and a variety of unknown payloads.\n\n[This new campaign was discovered by security researchers 0day enthusiast and](https://twitter.com/impost0r_/status/1479600560240222208)\n[MalwareHunterTeam who saw the malicious dnSpy project initially hosted at](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1479767752885874688)\nhttps://github[.]com/carbonblackz/dnSpy/ and then switching to\nhttps://github[.]com/isharpdev/dnSpy to appear more convincing.\n\n**Malicious dnSpy GitHub repository**\n\nSource: MalwareHunterTeam\nThe threat actors also created a website at dnSpy[.]net that was nicely designed and\nprofessional-looking. This site is now down, but you can see a screenshot of the archived\nversion below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious dnSpy[.net] site**\n\n_Source:BleepingComputer_\nTo promote the website, the threat actors performed successful search engine optimization\nto get dnSpy[.]net listed on the first page of Google. This domain was also listed\nprominently on Bing, Yahoo, AOL, Yandex, and Ask.com.\n\nAs a backup plan, they also took out search engine ads to appear as the first item in search\nresults, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Google ad for fake dnSpy site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe malicious dnSpy application looks like the normal program when executed. It allows\nyou to open .NET applications, debug them, and perform all the normal functions of the\nprogram.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake dnSpy application**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\n[However, when the malicious dnSpy application [VirusTotal] is launched, it will execute a](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/005526de4599f96a4a1eba9de9d6ad930de13d5ea1a23fada26e1575f4e3cf85)\nseries of commands that create scheduled tasks that run with elevated permissions.\n\nIn a [list of the commands shared with BleepingComputer by MalwareHunterTeam, the](https://pastebin.com/J6nH0KSD)\nmalware performs the following actions:\n\nDisables Microsoft Defender\nUses bitsadmin.exe to download curl.exe to %windir%\\system32\\curl.exe.\nUses curl.exe and bitsadmin.exe to download a variety of payloads to the C:\\Trash\nfolder and launch them.\nDisables User Account Control.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Commands executed by fake dnSpy program**\n\n_Source: MalwareHunterTeam_\nThe payloads are downloaded from http://4api[.]net/ and include a variety of malware listed\nbelow:\n\n%windir%\\system32\\curl.exe - The curl program.\n[C:\\Trash\\c.exe - Unknown [VirusTotal]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cabc62b3077c2df3b69788e395627921c309e112b555136e99949c5a2bbab4f2)\nC:\\Trash\\ck.exe - Unknown\n[C:\\Trash\\cbot.exe - Clipboard Hijacker [VirusTotal]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/746a7a64ec824c63f980ed2194eb7d4e6feffc2dd6b0055ac403fac57c26f783)\n[C:\\Trash\\cbo.exe - Unknown [VirusTotal]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e998df840b687ec58165355c1d60938b367edc2967df2a9d44b74ad38f75f439/behavior/C2AE)\n[C:\\Trash\\qs.exe - Quasar RAT [VirusTotal]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/70ad9112a3f0af66db30ebc1ab3278296d7dc36e8f6070317765e54210d06074)\n[C:\\Trash\\m.exe - Miner [VirusTotal]](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/8b7874d328da564aca73e16ae4fea2f2c0a811ec288bd0aba3b55241242be40d)\n[C:\\Trash\\d.exe - Legitimate Defender Control application to disable Microsoft](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-0/)\n[Defender.
