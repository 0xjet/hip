The messages came from\n\n fake Facebook profiles belonging to attractive, but fictitious women. These\n\n women encouraged him to download another chat application to continue\n\n their conversations. The chat application the women referred him to was\n\n spyware, disguised as the Kik Messenger app, distributed through a very\n\n convincing fake site.\n\n After analyzing the fake Kik Messenger app, we spotted the spyware, or\n\n Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). We are calling the APT “Tempting Cedar\n\n Spyware”. We dug deeper into our archives and found APKs belonging to\n\n several fake messenger and feed reader apps, all of which included the\n\n same malicious modules.\n\n During our analysis, we also discovered that our customer was not the only\n\n person to encounter the Tempting Cedar Spyware, and, unfortunately,\n\n many fell for the trap.\n\n Tempting Cedar Spyware was designed to steal information like contacts,\n\n call logs, SMS, and photos, as well as device information, like geolocation \n in order to keep track of movements - and was capable of recording\n\n surrounding sounds, including conversations victims had while their phone\n\n was within range.\n\n Based on various clues from the fake Facebook profiles and the campaign\n\n infrastructure, we believe the people behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware\n\n are Lebanese. The campaign was highly targeted and ran deep under the\n\n radar. At the moment, Avast is one of few mobile antivirus providers\n\n detecting the threat. Our detection is Android:SpyAgent-YP [Trj] .\n\n Due to the potential impact on the victims targeted with the malware, we\n\n contacted law enforcement agencies to help us with threat mitigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Infection vector\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The malware was distributed using several fake Facebook profiles. After\n\n engaging in flirty conversations with their victims, which were most likely\n\n young men, the attackers offered to move the conversation from Facebook\n\n to a more “secure and private” platform, where they could have more\n\n intimate interactions. Then, the attackers sent a link to the victims, that led\n\n to a phishing website, which hosted a downloadable and malicious version\n\n of the Kik Messenger app. The victims had to adjust their device settings to\n\n install apps from unknown sources, before installing the fake messaging\n\n app. This should raise red flags for users, however, sometimes temptation\n\n trumps security.\n\n Once the malware was installed, it immediately connected to a command\n\n and control (C&C) server.\n\n The spyware was spread using at least the following three fake Facebook\n\n profiles. We have blurred the photos, as the photos used for the fake\n\n accounts were stolen from real people:\n\n#### Alona\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Rita\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Christina\n\n\n-----\n\n##### One interesting point to note is that the three girls interacted with one\n\n another on Facebook, perhaps to make their profiles appear a bit more\n\n credible:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Above: A screenshot of how the attackers convinced their victims to install\n\n the fake Kik Messenger application.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### chat-messenger.site (185.8.237.151), operated until spring 2017 and was a\n\n very convincing copycat.\n\n# Deep analysis\n\n##### The Tempting Cedar Spyware is split into different modules with specific\n\n commands. There are several modules designed to gather personal\n\n information about the victim, including contacts, photos, call logs, SMS, as\n\n well as information about the mobile device, such as geolocation, Android\n\n version, device model, network operator, and phone numbers.\n\n Other modules were created to record audio streams or gain access to the\n\n infected device’s file system.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### All modules with commands:\n\n|Module name|Commands|\n|---|---|\n|AUDIO|START, STOP, RECORD_START, RECORD_STOP|\n|CONTACTS|COUNT, GET|\n|FS (File System)|APP, CD, DOWNLOAD, DOWNLOAD_STATUS, EXTERNAL, GET, INSTALL, INTERNAL, LS, MKDIR, PWD, RM|\n|GEO|GETLOC|\n|INFO / USER_INFO|PS (running apps process list)|\n|PHOTOS|LSX, GETX, LSI, GETI, TAKEPIC_FRONT, TAKEPIC_BACK|\n|TELEPHONE|COUNT_CALL_LOGS, COUNT_SMS, GET_CALL_LOGS, GET_SMS|\n|KEEPALIVE|without commands|\n|PING|not implemented|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The spyware persisted as a service and ran after every reboot.\n\n The fake Kik application contains the same injected malicious class\n\n eighty9.guru and a specific rsdroid.crt file with different certificates\n\n belonging to the C&C domain.\n\n Through the reuse of the same rsdroid.crt certificate name, we were able to\n\n find additional C&C and data exfiltration servers.\n\n All rsdroid.crt certificates from the fake APK:\n\n**Issued to** **Valid from** **Valid to** **Serial number**\n\n00fe4b81ee781fe\ngserv.mobi 2015-04-28 2020-04-01\n486\n\n0090400fbd572e\nnetwork-lab.info 2016-03-29 2026-03-27\ndcc6\n\n00e7238783cc4e\nonlineclub.info 2017-05-24 2027-05-22\n87de\n\n|Issued to|Valid from|Valid to|Serial number|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|gserv.mobi|2015-04-28|2020-04-01|00fe4b81ee781fe 486|\n|network-lab.info|2016-03-29|2026-03-27|0090400fbd572e dcc6|\n\n\n-----\n\n446d\n\n# C&C administration and infrastructure\n\n#### Following their victims’ every step\n\n##### The malware communicated on the TCP port 2020, but it is also worth\n\n mentioning that there was also a C&C console running on port 443 with a\n\n familiar certificate subject common name - rsdroid.\n\n The C&C console allowed attackers to live track their victims. The image\n\n below does not include any data, as we don’t want to disclose any of the\n\n victims’ locations, but shows the region where Tempting Cedar was spread\n\n the most:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Other hosts with this common name are easy to find using open source\n\n tools:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Above: Open source data about the C&C server hosts\n\n We created an image of the computer infrastructure used in the campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### All signs point to Lebanon\n\n##### It is always difficult to attribute persistent threat campaigns, like this one, to\n\n cybercriminals. However, pieces of information point to the cybercriminals\n\n behind this campaign being Lebanese.\n\n The first clue that led us to this conclusion are the attackers’ working hours.\n\n We only saw about 30 logins in the SSH log we received. The user root\n\n logged on on workdays, occasionally on Saturdays, but never on Sundays.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The working hours in the SSH log correspond with Eastern European and Middle Eastern time zones.\n\n The second breadcrumb we found was the infrastructure used in the\n\n campaign, which also points to Lebanon.\n\n WHOIS data revealed that two domains used were registered by someone\n\n from Lebanon, whereas others were registered with fictitious registrant\n\n data.\n\n Chat-world.site was registered by Jack Zogby, Beirut, Lebanon,\n\n jack.zogby@yandex.com\n\n\n-----\n\n##### jack.halawani@yandex.com\n\n Over the last two years, SSH logins were made from Lebanese ISPs’ IP\n\n ranges. ( 185.99.32.0/22, 78.40.183.0/24)\n\n One of the fake Facebook profile’s likes are also interesting, and if any of\n\n the victims had taken a closer look at these, they may not have fallen for\n\n the scam. Rita, the petite brunette, seems to be interested in military\n\n groups, and a Lebanese and Israel friendship.\n\n Above: Rita’s likes on Facebook\n\n The Lebanon & Israel Friendship connection group is interesting when\n\n considering the the victims’ locations.\n\n While we observed a low number of victims from the USA, France,\n\n Germany, and China, the majority of victims were from the Middle East, with\n\n most of the victims located in Israel:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Above: Map showing the countries most of the victims came from\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n##### The targeted Tempting Cedar campaign has been running under the radar\n\n since as far back as 2015, targeting people in Middle Eastern countries. The\n\n spyware’s infection vector involves social engineering using attractive, but\n\n fictitious Facebook profiles. The fake Kik APK sent to victims is\n\n masqueraded as a legitimate Kik Messenger app, however, after gaining\n\n access to victims’ phones, the spyware starts to exfiltrate sensitive data,\n\n sending data back to the attacker’s infrastructure. Evidence points to the\n\n attackers being a Lebanese hacking group; however, we cannot be 100%\n\n sure this is true. The social engineering part of the campaign seems to have\n\n targeted people in Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries.\n\n Despite unsophisticated techniques and the level of operational security\n\n being used, the attack managed to remain undetected for several years.\n\n The cybercriminals behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware were able to install\n\n a persistent piece of spyware by exploiting social media, like Facebook,\n\n and people’s lack of security awareness and were thus able to gather\n\n\n-----\n\n##### location data which makes the malware exceptionally dangerous.\n\n# Steps to take to protect yourself against spyware\n\n##### Here are a few things you can do to avoid being manipulated like this into\n\n downloading spyware:\n\n Use antivirus software. Even if you accidentally download malware onto your phone, Avast will detect and remove the malware, to keep your data and privacy safe. Don’t talk to strangers. There is a reason why parents have been warning kids about talking to strangers and this case confirms that talking to strangers online is no different and is not a good idea. Never open links or download software sent to you from untrusted sources. The victims of this spyware campaign were tricked into downloading the spyware themselves because they trusted the girls they were talking to online, despite never meeting them in person. On top of this, they ignored Android’s warnings about downloading apps from unknown sources. Download from the source. Whenever possible, visit the homepage of an established company directly - by typing in the URL yourself - as they often promote their mobile apps on their websites and download the app straight from the source. Had the victims done this, they would have avoided the fake and malicious Kik app. The “girls” probably would have stopped talking to them, but that would have been for their own good!\n\n# IOCs\n\n##### Fake Kik messenger SHA256:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 041136252FFEF074B0DEBA167BD12B8977E276BAC90195B7112260AB31D DB810\n\n 2807AB1A912FF0751D5B7C7584D3D38ACC5C46AFFE2F168EEAEE70358 DC90006\n\n 3065AD0932B1011E57961104EB96EEE241261CB26B9252B0770D053208 39915F\n\n 5259AD04BDEA3F41B3913AA09998DB49553CE529E29C868C48DF40D 5AA7157EA\n\n 624A196B935427A82E8060876480E30CE6867CB9604107A44F85E2DA 96A7A22E\n\n 9D1FDA875DE75DEA545D1FF84973B230412B8B4946D64FF900E9D22B 065F8DCC\n\n B181F418F6C8C79F28B1E9179CAEFEB81BDF77315814F831AF0CF0C2507 860C4\n\n D7A4ABA5FC2DEE270AE84EAC1DB98B7A352FB5F04FD07C3F9E69DE6 E58B4C745\n\n F67469C82E948628761FDFD26177884384481BA4BDBC15A53E8DF92D3 F216648\n\n FE2996BC0C47C0626F43395EEE445D12E7C024C1B0AA2358947B5F1D 839A5868\n\n Fake Datasettings SHA256:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1DEB727C05AA5FABF6224C0881970ACA78649A799EEB6864260DE976 35FA005A\n\n 94ADF4C8A27722307C11F6C0376D4A51CFD56BA3CC47F9E5447179D1E 0F7289F\n\n A411A587B4256007F0E0A3C3A3C3097062242B5359A05A986195E76D A7334B7D\n\n Fake feedreader SHA256:\n\n 58F74545D47F5DA1ECF3093F412D7D9544A33D36430AB1AF709D835A5\n\n 9184611\n\n Domains:\n\n chat-world.site\n\n chat-messenger.site\n\n gserv.mobi\n\n arab-chat.site\n\n onlineclub.info\n\n free-apps.us\n\n\n-----\n\n##### IPs (including historic records):\n\n 185.166.236.134\n\n 46.28.109.69\n\n 5.135.207.244\n\n 31.31.75.174\n\n 155.94.136.10\n\n 213.32.65.238\n\n 84.200.17.154\n\n 185.8.237.151\n\n 213.32.65.238\n\n 5.45.176.236\n\n 46.101.199.72\n\n 185.99.32.0/22\n\n 78.40.183.0/24\n\n Rsdroid certificate serial numbers:\n\n 10418450096179084191\n\n 11696648495248868788\n\n 13367542350555075590\n\n 17798583036840002648\n\n 17362149250016288818\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 12941986373589998425\n\n 14237693369114233902\n\n 15175240657458101230\n\n 18263349974554467657\n\n 10031168301806868687\n\n 12450086912549212859\n\n 13469158752397659430\n\n 13887786183890428647\n\n 15448206077875179259\n\n 15525317917180712785\n\n 16639512314094306104\n\n 10671561344391424094\n\n 14360088739535268901\n\n 16495367076336282102\n\n 15684750702817909758\n\n 17908820252718507450\n\n 10302454590553748328\n\n Fake FB profiles:\n\n facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013563997788\n\n facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011377795504\n\n facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011891805784\n\n\n-----\n\n## Related articles\n\n\n**THREAT RESEARCH**\n\n\n**THREAT RESEARCH**\n\n\n**THREAT RESEARCH**\n\n\n##### Botnet at large: Avast blocks Smominru miner\n\nThe cryptominer\nbotnet attacked\nover half a million\nWindows servers\nand computers so\nfar...but that\nnumber is growing.\n\n\n##### Meltdown and Spectre: Yes, your device is likely vulnerable\n\n“Meltdown” and\n“Spectre” are major\nvulnerabilities\naffecting almost\nevery computer in\nthe world.\n\n\n**2 February 2018** **3 min**\n**read** **5 January 2018** **7 min read**\n\n\n##### New version of mobile malware Catelites possibly linked to Cron cyber gang\n\nNew malware\ntargets accounts at\nover 2,200\nfinancial institutions\n\n**20 December 2017** **12 min**\n**read**\n\n\n### Never miss our news\n\n\n-----\n\n**your e-mail addr** **SUBSCRIBE**\n\n1988 - 2018 Copyright © Avast Software s.r.o. | [Sitemap](https://blog.avast.com/sitemap.xml)\n\n\n-----",
