You\nmay also hear people referring to the Exchange Zero Days as:\n\nHAFNIUM (Original threat group who exploited the zero days, named by Microsoft)\nOperation Exchange Marauder (Name given to the initial attack by Volexity, the company who first identified the zero\ndays)\n\n**_From_** **_[the original Microsoft post (I highly recommend reading this whole article) –](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)_**\n\n[CVE-2021-26855 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which allowed the attacker to send](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855)\narbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.\n\n[CVE-2021-26857 is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857)\nwhere untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability\nto run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit.\n\n[CVE-2021-26858 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858)\nwith the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could\nauthenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin’s credentials.\n\n[CVE-2021-27065 is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065)\nwith the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could\nauthenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin’s credentials.\n\n**It is important to note that these vulnerabilities exist on Microsoft Exchange Server, and does not affect**\n**Microsoft Exchange Online users.**\n\n### Further reading\n\n[There is further information about the zero days at Volexity’s original post and also at the Mandiant Managed Defence post.](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\n[A site named proxylogon.com has also been created.

On the 9th of March,\nRansomware named #DoejoCrypt aka #DearCry has started to target Exchange Servers via the exploits mentioned in this\nblog.\n\nThere are number of well written, informative articles on the ransomware targeting Exchange Servers so far –\n\n[BleepingComputer article](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-now-attacks-microsoft-exchange-servers-with-proxylogon-exploits/)\n[TheRecord article](https://therecord.media/microsoft-exchange-servers-targeted-by-dearcry-ransomware-abusing-proxylogon-bugs/)\n[Twitter thread from Sophos explaining DearCry](https://twitter.com/SophosLabs/status/1370477406696271875)\n\n[DoejoCrypt / Dearcry samples are available at Malware Bazaar.](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/DoejoCrypt/)\n\n[Thanks to James Quinn (who added some of the above samples to Malware Bazaar) for sharing the following :](https://twitter.com/lazyactivist192/status/1370289268158005248)\n\n[Notes on the samples he found](https://pastebin.com/ZNuZvqZy)\n[AppAnyRun Run](https://app.any.run/tasks/813bfec6-72f6-4ea0-9f5d-b9536cdd82eb/)\n\n[As shared by Pete Bryan, the MSTIC feed has been updated.

This also includes some detections for known post exploitation tactics.\n\n### Microsoft\n\n[Microsoft Vulnerability Mitigation’s](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/05/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-mitigations-march-2021/)\n\nImportantly, this tells you –\n\n[How to install the security update (This does not evict an attacker if they have already compromised the](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-march-2021-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/2175901)\n**system). It is also worth noting that if you are installing the upgrades manually, you must run the update from the**\nelevated command prompt. If you are running an older CU then what the patch will accept, you must upgrade to at\nleast the required CU as stated above then apply the patch.\n[If you see unexpected behaviors or your upgrade fails, please go to this link which advises how to troubleshoot.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/client-connectivity/exchange-security-update-issues)\n[If you are unsure of the patch levels of your Exchange Servers, use this script from Microsoft.](https://github.com/dpaulson45/HealthChecker#download)\nInterim mitigation’s if you are unable to patch Exchange Server 2013/16/19.

This will ensure that only authenticated and_\n_authorized users can connect to this service.
