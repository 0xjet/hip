For some Russian government\nhackers, foreign travel is part of the game. They pack up their equipment, get on\ninternational flights, and covertly move around abroad to hack into computer systems.\n\nEnter GRU Unit 26165 (of the military intelligence agency Glavnoye Razvedyvatelnoye\n_Upravlenie), a military cyber unit with hackers operating remotely and on-site. Despite the_\nsecurity risks on-site cyber operations pose to governments and international organizations,\nand the questions they raise about how the West should track and combat Russian state\nhacking, Russia’s activities in this realm are not receiving sufficient policy attention.\n\n## GRU Unit 26165, the 85th Main Special Communications Center\n\nIn March 2018, after the GRU [tried to murder former Russian intelligence officer Sergei](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/russian-spy-police-appeal-for-witnesses-as-cobra-meeting-takes-place)\nSkripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England using a Novichok nerve agent, the\nKremlin came under international fire. British intelligence officials [blamed the GRU, where](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/world/europe/uk-skripal-russia-novichok.html)\nSkripal used to work (and later became a British informant); the multinational Organization\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which enforces the Chemical Weapons\n[Convention, launched an investigation; and in June of the same year, OPCW countries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-russia-chemicalweapons-minist/russia-says-opcw-report-on-skripals-may-be-part-of-action-to-discredit-moscow-idUSKBN1HJ2BM) [voted](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2018/06/cwc-conference-states-parties-adopts-decision-addressing-threat-chemical)\nto let the body attribute chemical weapons attacks to particular actors. (A year later, the\n[OPCW would formally ban Novichok nerve agents.) Additional journalistic investigations into](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03686-y)\nthe perpetrators, meanwhile, continued to point to the GRU’s involvement.\n\nAlthough the OPCW’s investigation was not made public for months, the Russian\ngovernment decided to move quickly against the organization, turning to a tactical cyber unit\nto do so.\n\n\n-----\n\nOPCW Headquarters\n[On April 10, 2018, four Russian nationals landed at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in the](https://english.defensie.nl/downloads/publications/2018/10/04/gru-close-access-cyber-operation-against-opcw)\nNetherlands. With diplomatic passports in hand, they were met by a member of the Russian\nembassy in The Hague. After loading a car with technical equipment—including a wireless\n[network panel antenna to intercept traffic—the four individuals scouted the OPCW’s](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45747472)\nheadquarters in The Hague for days, taking photos and circling the building before being\nintercepted by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (Algemene Inlichtingen_en Veiligheidsdienst or AIVD) and sent back to Moscow. Seemingly, the plan had been for_\nthe operatives to hack into the OPCW’s systems to disrupt investigations into the attempted\nGRU chemical weapon attack.\n\nThe Netherlands made all of this public on October 4, 2018, with Dutch intelligence\n[identifying the four operators by name—Aleksei Sergeyevich Morenets and Evgenii](https://english.defensie.nl/downloads/publications/2018/10/04/gru-close-access-cyber-operation-against-opcw)\nMikhaylovich Serebriakov were described as “cyber operators” and Oleg Mikhaylovich\nSotnikov and Alexey Valerevich Minin were described as “HUMINT (human intelligence)\nsupport.” The AIVD linked all of these individuals to Russia’s GRU. A Department of Justice\n(DOJ) [indictment issued on the same day went a step further, linking the hackers—Morenets](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-gru-officers-international-hacking-and-related-influence-and)\nand Serebriakov—to GRU Unit 26165.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnit 26165, otherwise known as Fancy Bear, was already known for breaking into systems\n[from afar, including the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and World Athletics](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/)\n(previously the International Amateur Athletic Federation) in 2017. Yet, the revelations\naround the attempted OPCW hack made clear that Unit 26165 does much more. The full\nDOJ [indictment, subsequently published by the National Security Archive at The George](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/5513708/United-States-v-Alexei-Sergeyevich-Morenets-et.pdf)\nWashington University, alleged that Morenets “was a member of a Unit 26165 team that\ntraveled with technical equipment to locations around the world to conduct on-site hacking\noperations to target and maintain persistent access to WiFi networks used by victim\norganizations and personnel.” Serebriakov also belonged to such a team. While Unit 26165\noften conducts remote hacks from Russia, the indictment stated that “if the remote hack was\nunsuccessful or if it did not provide the conspirators with sufficient access to victims’\nnetworks,” Unit 26165 would carry out “‘on-site’ or ‘close access’ hacking operations.”\n\nThe OPCW incident was not the first time these particular hackers went abroad to conduct\noperations. According to the DOJ, Morenets traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and\nLausanne, Switzerland, in 2016 to breach the into WiFi networks used by people with access\nto the US Anti-Doping Agency, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the Canadian Center for\nEthics in Sport. Serebriakov, the indictment stated, also participated in these on-site hacking\noperations. Both individuals allegedly planned to target the Spiez Laboratory in Switzerland\nafter the OPCW hack. The indictment alleged that Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, also part of\nGRU Unit 26165, provided remote reconnaissance support for his colleagues’ on-site\nhacking operation against the OPCW.\n\nAdditionally, it is speculated that these on-site hackers were supported by another GRU unit,\nwhich is where the other two Russians caught in the Netherlands by the AIVD enter the\npicture. Sotnikov and Minin were described generically by the Dutch as HUMINT support for\nthe two hackers, and as “Russian military intelligence officers” by the DOJ’s full indictment.\nNeither of these government documents mentions a specific GRU unit associated with\nSotnikov or Minin.\n\nPublished in tandem with the October 4, 2018 state disclosures was a new Bellingcat\n[investigation linking Morenets’ Russian car to the Unit 26165 building in Russia. It also linked](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2018/10/04/305-car-registrations-may-point-massive-gru-security-breach/)\nMinin’s car registration to the GRU “Conservatory.” The [Conservatory—formally numbered](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2018/11/06/what-is-the-gru-who-gets-recruited-to-be-a-spy-why-are-they-exposed-so-often)\nGRU Unit 22177—is the Russian Defense Ministry’s Military Academy and a training site for\nthe GRU, located in Moscow near GRU headquarters and other GRU training facilities. Due\nto Minin’s connection to 22177 and the Dutch and US governments’ vague references to\nSotnikov and Minin as “HUMINT support” and “Russian military intelligence officers” separate\nfrom Unit 26165, [numerous](https://www.securityartwork.es/2019/02/25/cyber-gru-vii-structure-unit-26165/) [articles have](https://lansinginstitute.org/2020/10/29/cyber-espionage-and-russias-intelligence-hack-activities/) [speculated that operatives from another GRU unit](https://lab52.io/blog/cyber-gru-v-october-2018/)\nwere tasked to support the mission in The Hague.\n\n## Stepping back, assessing the picture\n\n\n-----\n\nPolicymakers should use this information as a case study for how Russian government\nhackers—and, theoretically, state hackers from other adversary countries—move around the\nworld to break into systems. The use of on-site cyber operations abroad seems unique to\nthis GRU team, with many possible motivations at play. It is unclear how high up the\noversight chain these on-site operations go. What is clear, though, is that Western\ngovernments cannot restrict their hunt for Russian hackers to the digital sphere; they must\nalso remember how Russian hacking fits into broader Russian intelligence activities,\nincluding overseas.\n\nThere are several takeaways and implications that result from this information. The on-site,\noverseas cyber operations of GRU Unit 26165 appears to stand out from other Russian\ngovernment cyber units. Of course, cyber capabilities are a part of intelligence operations\nmore broadly, and many human operations around the world leverage cyber reconnaissance\non an ongoing basis. Nonetheless, when the United Kingdom (UK) released its own\n[statement on Russian government cyber activity in October 2018, it clearly differentiated](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/minister-for-europe-statement-attempted-hacking-of-the-opcw-by-russian-military-intelligence)\nbetween the activities of Unit 26165 in the Netherlands, Brazil, and Switzerland and those of\nUnit 74455 (Sandworm), which it stressed “were carried out remotely—by GRU teams based\nwithin Russia.” The DOJ indictment appears to suggest, although this is not totally clear, that\nhackers going abroad are part of at least one specific sub-team within the broader cyber unit.\nFurther, the DOJ indictment lists numerous examples of on-site hacks or hack attempts, but\npublicly available information has not exposed the same kind of on-site operations by\nRussia’s Foreign intelligence Service, the SVR.\n\nThe motivations behind the on-site operations of Unit 26165 are also a key question. Based\non publicly available information, its proclivity for “close access” operations leans toward\ndisrupting high-profile investigations into potentially embarrassing Russian government\nactivity. The first set of reported hacks targeted international investigations into allegations of\nRussian doping at the Olympics; the second set of hacks targeted the international\ninvestigation into the attempted murder of the Skripals with chemical weapons. It is possible,\ntherefore, that protecting the Kremlin’s image is a high priority. Simultaneously, the DOJ\nindictment stated that Unit 26165 carries out on-site operations when remote operations are\nunsuccessful, suggesting a more functional, effects-oriented motive for sending hackers\noverseas.\n\nHowever, there is another possibility: The GRU may simply be using on-site operations when\nit needs to draw attention away from its own failures. The botched attempt to murder Sergei\n[and Yulia Skripal was carried out by GRU Unit 29155, a Russian military intelligence and](https://www.rferl.org/a/gru-unit-29155-russian-military-intelligence/31220707.html)\n[assassination team with close relationships to the Signal Scientific Center federal research](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/10/23/russias-clandestine-chemical-weapons-programme-and-the-grus-unit-21955/)\nfacility and the Ministry of Defense’s State Institute for Experimental Military Medicine in St.\nPetersburg, entities suspected of managing Russia’s Novichok program. GRU operatives are\n[well-known for their high-risk appetites and sometimes overt violence, even relative to other](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/how-russias-military-intelligence-agency-became-the-covert-muscle-in-putins-duels-with-the-west/2018/12/27/2736bbe2-fb2d-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian intelligence organs like the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia s domestic\nsecurity agency. (That said, the FSB is a violent organization, too, carrying out repressive\n[tactics in Russia and, in 2019, assassinating a Georgian asylum seeker in Berlin.)](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/03/19/berlin-assassination-new-evidence-on-suspected-fsb-hitman-passed-to-german-investigators/)\n\nThis tendency is playing out in cyberspace already, given that GRU teams are behind the\n[NotPetya malware attack,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and) [shutdowns of Ukrainian power grids, and other more destructive,](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-ukraine-blackout-gru/)\n[publicly visible operations. Such cyber activities, in line with](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/the-5x5/the-5x5-russias-cyber-statecraft/) [broader intelligence cultures,](https://twitter.com/wylienewmark/status/1505943599149629441?s=21&t=V-mz-5NGPViCia3VnQFYfA)\nstand in contrast to agencies like the SVR, which appears to place a premium on covertness,\nboth online and offline. Wanting to frantically undermine an investigation into its own failed\noperation, it is not out of the question that the GRU sent Unit 26165 operatives overseas.\nThat Unit 26165 hackers Morenets and Serebriakov may have had support from other parts\nof the GRU (HUMINT operators Sotbikov and Minin) in the OPCW plot suggests possible\nbroader intra-agency coordination. But again, it is easy—and sometimes misguided—to\nassume there is more coordination within the Russian security services than actually occurs.\n\nAll of this raises a final and more interesting question always at play in the Russian cyber\necosystem: How far up the chain does oversight of on-site hacks go?\n\nCyber and information operations with high political sensitivity, which Moscow conceptualizes\nmore cohesively than in the West, are more likely to be supervised by the Kremlin. The US\n[intelligence community assessed, for example, that the influence actions targeting the 2016](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)\nUS election were “approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,” and a similar\n[conclusion was reached vis-à-vis President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s election interference](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf)\nin 2020. This may also be true for more traditional intelligence operations. When the UK\nfinished its [investigation into the](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20160613090324/https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/report) [murder of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19647226)\n[was killed on British soil with the radioactive material Polonium-210, it concluded that Putin](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35370819)\nand Russian Security Council head Nikolai Patrushev “probably” approved the killing.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GRU s botched murder attempt on the Skripals garnered significant international\nattention. At the time, Russian officials were already criticizing the OPCW’s investigations\n[into the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons in Syria—called an attempt “to make the](https://tass.com/politics/941897)\nOPCW draw hasty but at the same time far-reaching conclusions” by Russia’s deputy foreign\nminister. When the investigation into the Skripal poisonings began, senior officials like\n[Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov falsely claimed that a lab used by the OPCW picked](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/opcw-rejects-russian-claims-of-second-salisbury-nerve-agent)\nup traces of a nerve agent possessed by NATO countries but not Russia. Putin, meanwhile,\nhas always held particular contempt for people he perceives as betraying the Russian nation,\n[once saying that “traitors always meet a bad end,” suggesting a kind of personal anger](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/world/europe/sergei-skripal-russian-spy-poisoning.html)\ndirected at individuals like Sergei Skripal who became agents for the West. The Olympic\n[doping investigations, too, proved an embarrassment for Moscow.](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/07/22/in-doping-scandal-russia-opts-for-honorable-surrender-a74587)\n\nIn this vein, it is quite possible that higher-level Kremlin officials may direct the GRU to act\nagainst investigations like OPCW’s, prompting the GRU to deploy Unit 26165 hackers to the\nNetherlands. It is also plausible that the activities of Unit 26165 merely reflect broader\nintelligence collection priorities, spying on those trying to “hurt” Russia, such as investigators\nlooking into Russian athlete doping. Since there are few publicly known cases of Unit 26165\nconducting “close access” operations, perhaps these are not representative samples, with\nthe GRU carrying out these activities on its own after all.\n\nRegardless, the GRU is clearly sending hackers overseas to carry out operations. Going\nforward, Western intelligence and law enforcement personnel, as well as multinational\norganizations, would be wise to pay attention.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Atlantic Council’s **[Cyber Statecraft Initiative, under the Digital Forensic Research Lab](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-and-security/cyber-statecraft-initiative/)**\n(DFRLab), works at the nexus of geopolitics and cybersecurity to craft strategies to help\nshape the conduct of statecraft and to better inform and secure users of technology.\n\n[learn more](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/scowcroft-center-for-strategy-and-security/cyber-statecraft-initiative/)\nImage: OPCW Headquarters\n\nThis website or its third-party tools use cookies, which are necessary for its functioning and\nrequired to achieve the purposes illustrated in the cookie policy.
