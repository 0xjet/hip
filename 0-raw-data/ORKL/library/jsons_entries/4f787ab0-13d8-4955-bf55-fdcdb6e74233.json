The first\nobservable was found during hunting process over OSINT sources, the entire infrastructure\nwas still up and running during the analyses as well as malicious payload were\ndownloadable.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nMy first observable was a zipped text file compressing a simple update.js script. The script\nwas created to avoid automatic analisis tools since the dimension (>9MB) really makes hard\nto beautify or remove unwanted/funny or added trash code every which happens to be\neverywhere.\n\nname update.js\n\nsha256 9ea4eebd9cf2a5d4e6343cb559d8c996fae6bf0f3bd7ffada0567053c08acc31\n\ntype Drop and Execute\n\nStage 1\nThe following images show how it looked like at first sight. As many of you are aware,\nanalyzing scripts is just a matter of time or, if you have enough memory on your machine (or\ntime to spend over that task) a computational matter during virtualization. If you are old style\n(I do like it a lot ) it is a matter of “keywords”, in other words adding some\n```\nconsole.println or whatsoever you like to make debugging quick and easy. Few strings\n\n```\nin this update.js reminded me to the use of obfuscator.io tool, but I did not investigate further\non this direction, it was quite easy as well to reach the point.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally its execution was reached. I obtained this status by using some classic and romantic\nhand working balance to dynamic execution with the always great JSDetox. Finally the real\nbehavior came out. It looks like to be a drop and execute artifact. It takes a file called\nDll.ppam from an IP address (please take a look to IoC section to see details on found IoC),\nit decodes it from `base64, and it invoked the method` `VAI (really interested Italian word to`\nsay “GO”, nice coincidence !?) in the `Fiber.Home class. It then passes to such a function`\nan interesting address: `https://firebasestorage. googleapis. com with some`\nparameters as the following image shows (please reverse the byte order on the right string).\n\nStage1 Drop and execute\nLets take a closer look to what Dll.ppam is. First it’s a .NET Portable Executable, so we might\nhave an easy path ahead.\n\nname Dll.ppam\n\n\n-----\n\nsha256 ab5b1989ddf6113fcb50d06234dbef65d871e41ce8d76d5fb5cc72055c1b28ba\n\ntype Drop, evasion and Memory Invoke\n\nThe .NET is not packed and the code reading is quite “straight forward”. An interesting\ntechnique that I’d like to highlight (and to track) is in the way the malware developer used to\nstep forward the malware control flow, which reminds me a known threat actor. Many\ndifferent techniques could be used at this point if you want to make something happening\nafter specific conditions or if you simply want to give an execution order. The most easy and\n(maybe) quick way to follow could be the adoption of `nested functions or, if you are a`\nmore sophisticated malware developer, you might decide to use `exception handlers or,`\nagain, you might decide to switch from function to function in different libraries, or for the\nshake of example, a simple single flow as a simple unique function. But this malware\ndeveloper decided to use a quite characteristic way developing an interesting combination of\n```\nswitch / case . In other words it starts by assigning 0 to num variable which it makes\ncase 0 to switch. In each case it updates the num variable to control the switch(num)\n\n```\nselector making the flow running in the desired way. The following image shows the `VAI`\nfunction, in where you might appreciate the control flow and additional IoC (such as IP\naddress, dropped url and artifact name, etc..).\n\nPrincipal routine on Dll.ppam\n\n\n-----\n\nThe VAI routing starts by downloading a file called `Rump.xls from a remote server. It`\nplaces the file content into a variable and it reverse its bytes order, later it replaces special\ncharacters to the letter `A . The resulting decoded file (bytes Inverted, Special Character`\nreplaced and base64 decoded) is another PE file written in .NET technology and encoded in\nbase64.\n\nFinally once the Rump.xls file is decoded in memory, `Dll.ppam runs it by calling the`\nmethod `Adre inside the` `Fsociety.Tools library, passing as argument` `RegAsm.exe .`\n\nMemory invoke of Rump.xls (later fsociety tools)\nThe following table sums up the original and dropped file by Dll.ppam named Rump.xls,\nwhile the next table shows details about the .NET PE file resulting from the decoding\nprocess.\n\nname Rump.xls (Original)\n\nsha256 20a53f17071f377d50ad9de30fdddd320d54d00b597bf96565a2b41c15649f76\n\ntype post exploitation tool, C2 communication\n\nname Rump.xls.inverted.charsReplaced.decoded (given name)\n\nsha256 5d910ee5697116faa3f4efe230a9d06f6e3f80a7ad2cf8e122546b10e34a0088\n\ntype post exploitation tool, C2 communication decoded\n\nRump.xls looks like to be an implementation of Fsociety tools, a complete post exploitation\nframework. This library is able to get system information `RtlGetVersion,`\n```\nRtlGetNtProductType, GetSystemTimeAsFileTime and to get the used software\n\n```\npolicies: `\"regsvr32.exe\" (Path:`\n```\n\"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\POLICIES\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\SAFER\\CODEIDENTIFIERS\"; Key:\n\"TRANSPARENTENABLED\") . It also contains the ability to get persistence by\n\"regsvr32.exe\" touched file \"%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\sysmain.sdb\" and it might get\n\n```\nremote access by using the `WmiPrvSE module.`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe image above shows an interested detail about the called function `Ande, where you`\nmight appreciate a similar coding style if compared to the Dll.ppam even if the control flow,\nthis time, is managed by simple nested if. The infinitive loop and the variable names are\nmatching the previous code. However those similarities are way too weak to say anything\nabout the authorship (IMHO), but still indicators to keep tracking.\n\n**Threat Intelligence**\n\nAccording to Microsoft Threat intelligence the drop server ( `4.204.233.44 ) has been seen`\nwith two certificates (please refer to IoC sections for sha1). The first certificate (SN:\n```\n136234453590953102797263558291395548452 ) has been issued on 2022-11-14 with\n\n```\ncommon name `servidor (server as in Spanish). On 2022-11-14 the attacker changed the`\nwebserver certificate by adding the certificate having as SN: `13098529066745705731`\nissued on 2009-11-11 and having with common name `localhost . This Certificate has`\nbeen recorded in almost 50k related IPs over the past 13 years. The following image shows\nwhat I meant.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom Microsoft Threat Intel\n[One of the 50k IPs in where the same certificate was found, was the same that TeamCymru](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2022/07/12/an-analysis-of-infrastructure-linked-to-the-hagga-threat-actor/)\n[was able to track, thanks to previously posted IoC from Yoroi Threat Intelligence, back to](https://yoroi.company/research/serverless-infostealer-delivered-in-est-european-countries/)\n**Hagga** **Threat Actor. According to Microsoft researchers:**\n\nTeam Cymru researchers describe how they were able to pivot in threat telemetry,\nusing IOCs from Yoroi Security’s blog as seeds, to identify several other C2s. From the\nstarting point of an IP address (69.174.99.181) associated with an Agent Tesla\ncommand and control server, it was possible to pivot and identify a backend server\nhosting a MySQL database operated by the threat actor Hagga. From this point a\nfurther pivot led Team Cymru researchers to the identification of additional C2s hosting\nthe Mana Tools C2 panel along with a common certificate that can be used to increase\nconfidence in attributing future infrastructure to this threat actor.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIn this blogpost I shared a personal analysis on an interesting artifact found during threat\nhunting research. Since the very beginning of the analysis I had some feelings about the\ndesigned patterns used on .NET libraries and the modus-oprandi looked familiar to me. What\nsurprised me a lot was to see indicators of FSociety framework embedded on this malware\nstack, but finally a matching certificate used in the infrastructure pointed my attention on\n[TeamCymru analysis on Hagga Threat Actor (HERE). If a matching certificate and code style](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/an-analysis-of-infrastructure-linked-to-the-hagga-threat-actor)\n[(not discussed here, but you might try by yourself to check HERE) are enough to you, I](https://yoroi.company/research/serverless-infostealer-delivered-in-est-european-countries/)\nwould bet on HAGGA threat actor with a new used post exploitation framework\nFSociety.tools.\n\n**IoC**\n\n\n-----\n\n**URL**\nDropper: p://4 .204 .233 .44/Dll/Dll .ppam\n\nDropper: p://4 .204 .233 .44/Rump/Rump .xls\n\nCommand And Control: 103.151.123.121 port: 8895\n\n**HASH (sha256)**\n\n9ea4eebd9cf2a5d4e6343cb559d8c996fae6bf0f3bd7ffada0567053c08acc31\n\nab5b1989ddf6113fcb50d06234dbef65d871e41ce8d76d5fb5cc72055c1b28ba\n\n20a53f17071f377d50ad9de30fdddd320d54d00b597bf96565a2b41c15649f76 (original)\n\n5d910ee5697116faa3f4efe230a9d06f6e3f80a7ad2cf8e122546b10e34a0088 (decoded)\n**CERT (sha1)**\n970f993ad1a289620b5f5033ff5e0b5c4491bb2b (drop webserver Certificate 1)\n\nb0238c547a905bfa119c4e8baccaeacf36491ff6 (drop webserver Certificate 2)\n\n\n-----",
