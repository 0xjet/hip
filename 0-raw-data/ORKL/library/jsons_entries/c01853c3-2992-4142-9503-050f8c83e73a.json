In addition, multiple cybersecurity firms have reported on Domestic Kitten, which\nthey believe is an Iranian state-sponsored hacking group.\n\nThe newest FurBall malware version was sampled and analyzed by ESET researchers, who\nreport it has many similarities with earlier versions, but now comes with obfuscation and C2\nupdates.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, this discovery confirms that Domestic Kitten is still ongoing in its sixth year, which\nfurther backs the hypothesis that the operators are tied to the Iranian regime, enjoying\nimmunity from law enforcement.\n\n## New FurBall details\n\nThe new version of FurBall is distributed via fake websites that are visually clones of real\nones, where victims end up after direct messages, social media posts, emails, SMS, black\nSEO, and SEO poisoning.\n\nIn one case spotted by ESET, the malware is hosted on a fake website mimicking an\nEnglish-to-Persian translation service popular in the country.\n\n**Fake site on the left, real site on the right** _(ESET)_\nIn the fake version, there’s a Google Play button that supposedly lets users download an\nAndroid version of the translator, but instead of landing on the app store, they are sent an\nAPK file named ‘sarayemaghale.apk.’.\n\nDepending on what permissions are defined in the Android app's AndroidManifest.xml file,\nthe spyware is capable of stealing the following information:\n\nClipboard contents\nDevice location\nSMS messages\nContact list\nCall logs\nRecord calls\nContent of notifications\nInstalled and running apps\n\n\n-----\n\nDevice info\n\nHowever, ESET says that the sample it analyzed has limited functionality, only requesting\naccess to contacts and storage media.\n\n**Permissions requested upon installation**\n\n_(ESET)_\nThese permissions are still powerful if abused, and at the same time, won't raise suspicions\nto the targets, which is likely why the hacking group restricted FurBall's potential.\n\nIf needed, the malware can receive commands to execute directly from its command and\ncontrol (C2) server, which is contacted via an HTTP request every 10 seconds.\n\n**C2 response returning no command for execution** _(ESET)_\nIn terms of the new obfuscation layer, ESET says it includes class names, strings, logs, and\nserver URI paths, attempting to evade detection from anti-virus tools.\n\nPrevious versions of Furball didn’t feature any obfuscation at all. Hence, VirusTotal detects\nthe malware on four AV engines, whereas previously, it was flagged by 28 products.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New BadBazaar Android malware linked to Chinese cyberspies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-badbazaar-android-malware-linked-to-chinese-cyberspies/)\n\n[New Android malware 'RatMilad' can steal your data, record audio](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-android-malware-ratmilad-can-steal-your-data-record-audio/)\n\n[Android file manager apps infect thousands with Sharkbot malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-file-manager-apps-infect-thousands-with-sharkbot-malware/)\n\n[New SandStrike spyware infects Android devices via malicious VPN app](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-sandstrike-spyware-infects-android-devices-via-malicious-vpn-app/)\n\n[Android malware droppers with 130K installs found on Google Play](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-malware-droppers-with-130k-installs-found-on-google-play/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
