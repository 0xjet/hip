Still, they failed to cause any\ndata loss or gain access to systems controlling the transportation fleet.\n\nAccording to Rafail Portnoy, MTA's Chief Technology Officer, while the attackers hacked into\nseveral MTA computer systems, they couldn't gain access to employee or customer\ninformation.\n\n\"The MTA quickly and aggressively responded to this attack, bringing on Mandiant, a leading\ncyber security firm, whose forensic audit found no evidence operational systems were\nimpacted, no employee or customer information breached, no data loss and no changes to\nour vital systems,\" Portnoy said in a statement.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The third attack targeting MTA in recent years\n\nMTA mitigated the vulnerability on April 21, one day after Pulse Secure issued an advisory,\nand CISA published an alert on the Pulse Secure zero-day exploited in the attack.\n\nAdditionally, existing security systems also hindered the attackers' attempts to move through\nthe network.\n\n\"Importantly, the MTA's existing multi-layered security systems worked as designed,\npreventing spread of the attack and we continue to strengthen these comprehensive systems\nand remain vigilant as cyber-attacks are a growing global threat,\" Portnoy added.\n\nThe breach was the result of the third attack on the transportation authority's network in\nrecent years, as MTA officials told the [NY Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/nyregion/mta-cyber-attack.html)\n\nMTA is the largest North American transportation network serving more than 15.3 million\npeople across a 5,000-square-mile travel area around New York City.\n\nThe transit authority operates multiple transportation agencies, including the MTA New York\nCity Transit, MTA Bus, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and MTA Bridges and\nTunnels.\n\n## Dozens of US and European organizations also hacked\n\nCybersecurity firm FireEye revealed on April 20 that at least two Chinese-backed threat\nactors (tracked as UNC2630 and UNC2717) were actively exploiting a zero-day\n[vulnerability to deploy 16 different malware families.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-cyberspies-are-targeting-us-eu-orgs-with-new-malware/)\n\n\"Espionage activity by UNC2630 and UNC2717 supports key Chinese government\npriorities,\" FireEye said in a report published last month.\n\n\"Many compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijing's\nstrategic objectives outlined in China's recent 14th Five Year Plan.\"\n\nThe malware is custom-tailored for compromising Pulse Secure VPN appliances and used to\nmaintain long-term access to networks, collect credentials, and steal proprietary data.\n\nThe zero-day was exploited together with other Pulse Secure bugs to hack the networks of\ndozens of US and European organizations across several verticals, including defense,\ngovernment, high tech, transportation, and financial sectors.\n\nA day later, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an\nemergency directive ordering federal agencies to mitigate the security flaw within two days\nby disabling the Pulse Secure Collaboration and Windows File Share Browser features.\n\n\n-----\n\nPulse Secure issued security updates to address the zero-day bug on May 3 and also\n[released the Pulse Connect Secure Integrity Tool that helps organizations check if hackers](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB44755)\nmodified files on their Pulse Secure appliances.\n\nCISA also updated mitigation measures shared in its alert and urges organizations to check\nthe guidance published by Ivanti, Pulse Secure's parent company.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[GitHub: Attackers stole login details of 100K npm user accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-attackers-stole-login-details-of-100k-npm-user-accounts/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[US, EU blame Russia for cyberattack on satellite modems in Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-eu-blame-russia-for-cyberattack-on-satellite-modems-in-ukraine/)\n\n[Hackers display “blood is on your hands\" on Russian TV, take down RuTube](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-display-blood-is-on-your-hands-on-russian-tv-take-down-rutube/)\n\n[NIST updates guidance for defending against supply-chain attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nist-updates-guidance-for-defending-against-supply-chain-attacks/)\n\n\n-----",
