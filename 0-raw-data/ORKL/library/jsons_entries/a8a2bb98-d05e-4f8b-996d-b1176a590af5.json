These campaigns and incidents target various\norganizations from a multitude of industries. Likewise, the geographic location of victims\nis not limited to just one region. This type of research normally contains detailed\ninformation about the tools used by APT actors, the vulnerabilities that they exploit and\nsometimes even a specific attribution. Despite the large number of these types of reports,\ncompanies often remain unprepared to face these kinds of attackers. With the advanced\n\n\n-----\n\ntools and techniques used by threat actors today, cybersecurity professionals require not\nonly high-level expertise and extensive experience, but also the infrastructure\nsupplemented by well-organized asset management and vulnerability management\nprocesses, network segmentation, fine-tuned audits, and intelligently configured data\nsecurity tools. In most cases, an unprepared infrastructure is the primary factor enabling\nAsian APT groups to conduct successful attacks.\n\nIn this report, we share the most valuable intelligence that we gathered on Asian APT\ngroups. Over the course of our work, we noticed that these groups attacked the greatest\nnumber of countries and industries. Most importantly, our analysis of hundreds of attacks\nrevealed a similar pattern among various groups. They achieve specific objectives at\nvarious stages of the Cyber Kill Chain using a common but limited number of techniques\nencountered by security professionals all over the world. Unfortunately, security teams\noften have difficulty detecting these attacks in their own infrastructure.\n\n## Intended audience of this report\n\nWe created this report to provide the cybersecurity community with the best-prepared\nintelligence data to effectively counteract Asian APT groups. This report will be the most\nhelpful to the following:\n\nSOC analysts\nCyber Threat Intelligence analysts\nThreat Hunting experts\nDigital Forensics (DFIR) experts\nCybersecurity experts\nDomain administrators\nC-Level executives responsible for cybersecurity at their companies\n\nThis material can serve as a library of knowledge on the main approaches used by Asian\nAPT groups when they hack an infrastructure. The report also contains detailed\ninformation on the attackers’ tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) based on the\nMITRE ATT&CK methodology.\n\n## Structure of the report\n\nThis report consists of six main sections:\n\n1. Incidents involving Asian APT groups in various regions of the planet\n\nInformation on five unique incidents that we detected in different parts of the world.\nEach incident is a unique case within a specific country and industry, and we\nprovide a description of the actions and TTPs of the perpetrators. At the end of each\nsection, we put together a consolidated table showing a list of TTPs (related to the\nAPT groups that we encountered in these incidents) and their overlapping use in\nthese incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Technical details\n\nA detailed description of the individual techniques that we detected in the attacks\nconducted by Asian APT groups. Each technique contains the following:\n\nMain description. Technical details on how the specific technique works.\nExamples of procedures. Example implementations of this technique that we\ndetected in attacks by Asian APT groups.\nData on the approaches employed to detect the described technique, and the\nEventIDs of events in various monitoring agents used to detect the specific\nthreat.\nSIGMA rules. List of SIGMA rules relevant to this technique. The actual\nSIGMA rules can be found in the Appendix: SIGMA.\n3. Analysis of attacker actions based on the Unified Kill Chain\n\nWe used the Unified Kill Chain model to create our own table linked to Asian APT\ngroups, so that we could provide a high-level look at the motivations and behavioral\npatterns of these actors, and provide data on the possible steps taken by Asian APT\ngroups when they conduct potential attacks.\n4. Mitigation\n\nThe measures undertaken to mitigate risks associated with the described TTPs.\n5. Statistics on attack victims\n\nConsolidated statistics on the victims of Asian APT groups throughout the world and\na breakdown by country and industry.\n6. Appendix: SIGMA\n\nThe SIGMA rules that can help to detect the techniques described in this report.\n\n**[Download the full version of the Modern Asian APT groups’ tactics, techniques and](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/09055246/Modern-Asian-APT-groups-TTPs_report_eng.pdf)**\n**[procedures report (English, PDF)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/09055246/Modern-Asian-APT-groups-TTPs_report_eng.pdf)**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[TTPs](https://securelist.com/tag/ttps/)\n\nModern Asian APT groups’ tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\n\nYour email address will not be published.
