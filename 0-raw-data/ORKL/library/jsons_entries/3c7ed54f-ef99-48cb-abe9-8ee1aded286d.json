Major ransomware attacks\nprompting multi-million dollar ransom payouts have attracted a growing\nnumber of malicious actors into the ransomware space.\n\nOver the past year, ransomware attackers have grown increasingly\nambitious and have mounted a number of high-profile, extremely\ndestructive attacks. The attack against Colonial Pipeline in the U.S. in May\n2021 caused significant disruption and prompted concerns about the\nnation’s fuel supplies. In the same month, an attack on Ireland’s national\nhealth service, the Health Service Executive, forced it to cancel thousands\nof appointments. In the middle of a global pandemic, staff had to keep\npaper records as computers were kept offline until the network was\ncleaned up.\n\nWhile these attacks paint a picture of ransomware gangs operating with\nimpunity, the disruption they caused did have a political impact, with U.S.\nPresident Joe Biden urging his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to rein in\nransomware attackers, many of whom are believed to be located in Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe glare of publicity surrounding such high-profile attacks and subsequent law enforcement operations is believed\nto have contributed to the disappearance of some of the more active ransomware threats during 2021, include\nDarkside, Sodinokibi (aka REvil), and Egregor.\n\nWhile the departure of any threat is always a welcome development, it should not be assumed that ransomware\nactivity will diminish. Frequently, attackers who have departed the scene will re-emerge with a new toolset, while\nnew attackers will emerge trying to take the market space occupied by departing players. Any change in the threat\nlandscape means that there’s a period of uncertainty where network defenders aren’t aware of who the big players\nare going to be and what tactics they are going to use.\n\nTwo trends are a particular source of concern. Although the phenomenon of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is not\nnew, its increasing adoption as part of the operations of most major ransomware developers has contributed to the\nproliferation of targeted ransomware attacks. Not only does RaaS prompt more attacks, but it also multiplies the\nnumber of tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) being employed to deliver ransomware. Each ransomware threat\ncould be delivered by one of multiple different threat actors, many of whom will use differing TTPs. RaaS has also\nlowered the entry barriers for less skilled actors to enter the arena, adding to the number of attackers.\n\nSecondly, a growing a number of ransomware operators are collaborating with other malware developers, most\nnotably financial fraud botnets, to gain access to victims. Major botnets often have a vast reach and can potentially\noffer ransomware gangs a deep pool of potential victims from which to fish from.\n\nRansomware groups are now sophisticated threat actors, capable of building relationships with other attackers in\norder to further their reach and employing an evolving array of tools and tactics in order to make their attacks more\neffective. Successfully defending against ransomware attacks now requires defense in depth from organizations,\nalong with a deep understanding of how these attacks unfold.\n\n### Ransomware Trends\n\nOver the past number of years, there has been a marked shift in the ransomware threat landscape and that trend\nhas continued in recent times. In the past 18 months, the total number of ransomware attacks detected and blocked\nby Symantec has almost halved, from 9,116 in January 2020 to 4,692 in June 2021.\n\nFigure 1: All Ransomware Detections January 2020 to June 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile any reduction in ransomware activity is to be welcomed, the overall decline in numbers is accounted for by\nthe ongoing decline of relatively unsophisticated, indiscriminate attacks. A growing number of threat actors are\nnow focusing on targeted ransomware attacks, where a single organization at a time is attacked and the attackers\nattempt to encrypt as many computers as possible on the network in the hope of extracting a high-value ransom.\nAlthough relatively small in number, these attacks are far more damaging to organizations than indiscriminate\nattacks, where usually only a small number of computers may be affected.\n\nFigure 2: Number of Organizations Affected by Targeted Ransomware Attacks, January 2020 to June 2021\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun\n2020 2021\n\nThe statistics for targeted attacks tell a different story, with the number of organizations affected by targeted\nransomware attacks up by 83% over the past 18 months, from 81 in January 2020 to 148 in June 2021. The real\nnumber of targeted ransomware attacks is much higher. Some ransomware families have been deployed via spam\ncampaigns in addition to being used in targeted attacks. There is no way of establishing how many victims of these\nthreats were infected by targeted attacks and how many were infected through other means, meaning they cannot\nbe counted among targeted attacks.\n\nIn addition to this, confirmed attacks from known targeted ransomware families are probably only a representative\nsample of the overall number of attacks involving these threats. Many targeted ransomware attacks are halted\nbefore payload deployment, meaning they may not be identified as ransomware. In addition, most targeted\nransomware operators recompile their ransomware for every new attack. This means that the variant of the\nransomware used in an attack may be blocked by a generic or machine learning-generated detection signature\nrather than a detection linked to that ransomware family.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Number of Organizations Affected by Targeted Ransomware Attacks, by Family, January 2020 to June 2021.\n\nGoGalocker Lockbit Matrix Maze Mega Cortex Netwalker Prolock RagnarLocker\n\n250\n\nRobbinhood Ryuk Sodinokibi Thieflock Wastedlocker Avaddon Babuk Bitpaymer\n\n200\n\nBlackKingdom Clop Coldlock Conti Darkside Dearcry Egregor Exx\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun\n2020 2021\n\nWhen targeted attacks are broken down by ransomware family, two trends become apparent. Firstly, the profusion\nof new threats has continued and is contributing to the overall increase in attacks. Of the 24 groups analyzed, nine\nwere active in January 2020, but 13 were active in June 2021. Secondly, a small number of prolific threat actors such\nas Ryuk, Sodinokibi, and, more recently, Avaddon, have accounted for a large proportion of attacks.\n\nAgain, it should be stressed that these statistics should be treated as a representative sample of attacks blocked by\nSymantec. The majority of attacks are likely to be blocked at the pre-ransomware deployment stage or before they\ncan be associated with any particular family of ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Overall Number of Ransomware Detections by Country, January 2020 to June 2021\n\nUS 13,627\n\nChina 13,189\n\nIndia 8,576\n\nSouth Africa 5,965\n\nEthiopia 5,398\n\nCameroon 3,310\n\nTurkey 2,795\n\nGermany 2,424\n\nCongo 2,062\n\nUK 1,924\n\nAlgeria 1,760\n\nJapan 1,710\n\nNigeria 1,197\n\nIndonesia 1,168\n\nZambia 1,045\n\nBotswana 1,040\n\nItaly 1,023\n\nRussia 1,018\n\nZimbabwe 997\n\n0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 10,000 11,000 12,000 13,000 14,000 15,000\n\nAnother key trend emerges when examining the location of ransomware victims. While the U.S. is the most\nfrequently attacked country, ransomware attacks in general are quite commonplace worldwide, with a notable\nnumber of African countries appearing in the top 20 over the past 18 months. The presence of Africa on the list\nis largely accounted for by the fact that it appears to be a particular focus for attackers mounting indiscriminate\nransomware attacks, such as through spam email campaigns or exploits of known vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Number of Targeted Ransomware Detections by Country, January 2020 to June 2021\n\nUS 5,174\n\nTurkey 455\n\nPhilipines 395\n\nUK 342\n\nChina 277\n\nIndia 273\n\nGermany 258\n\nCanada 243\n\nFrance 184\n\nMexico 146\n\nAustralia 129\n\nIreland 123\n\nSaudi Arabia 112\n\nSouth Korea 110\n\nSouth Africa 101\n\nBrazil 93\n\nSingapore 87\n\nArgentina 84\n\nThailand 76\n\n0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 5,500\n\nA very different picture emerges when analyzing only targeted ransomware attacks. The U.S. is by far the most\naffected country, with more than 11 times more attacks over the past 18 months than the next most affected\ncountry (Turkey).\n\nThe concentration of victims in the U.S. is not surprising. As a large, affluent nation with a highly developed\nbusiness sector, it is naturally a prime target for targeted ransomware attacks. Several ransomware gangs are on\nrecord as saying they mostly, if not exclusively, targeted organizations in the U.S.\n\nWhile it may be a surprise that Turkey and the Philippines also figure prominently, it is consistent with previous\nyears’ statistics, where both also featured in the top five.\n\nIt should be noted that unlike targeted ransomware stats listed earlier that counted the number of organizations,\nthis statistic represents a count of computers on which a targeted ransomware family was detected. When\nanalyzing attacks by geographical region, a different methodology needs to be employed since many victims of\ntargeted ransomware have operations in more than one country.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Compounding the Threat: Ransomware-as-a-Service\n\nA key factor in driving the threat posed by ransomware was the advent of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). While a\nsuccessful targeted ransomware attack can be devastatingly effective, one of the drawbacks it has for the attacker\nis that it can be quite labor intensive. The various steps involved in a typical attack, including credential theft,\nprivilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, deletion of backups, and payload deployment often require\nactive participation on the part of the attacker. Consequently, the number of attacks a ransomware actor can\nperform is limited by their available workforce.\n\nSuccessful ransomware authors realized that they could boost their revenues by recruiting other attackers, known\nas affiliates, and provide them with access to their tools in exchange for a cut of the ransom payment. This business\nmodel is now highly developed and most of the high-profile targeted ransomware developers operate some kind of\nRaaS program.\n\nThe available evidence suggests that there are varying types of affiliate relationships, but the basic template\ncurrently involves ransomware authors offering access to the ransomware itself, hosting for breached data, and\nhandling of ransom negotiations. In some cases, it’s been reported that ransomware developers provide an entire\nplaybook for affiliates. However, often affiliates will use their own TTPs. Symantec has frequently seen actors using\nthe same TTPs but different payloads over time. There is also some evidence of actors being affiliated to more than\none ransomware developer at the same time (see Case Study: Shifting allegiances among affiliates).\n\nWhile some ransomware developers appear to solely work under the RaaS business model, others are more handson and will continue to mount attacks themselves. The nature of what’s required from affiliates may also vary.\nSeveral have been observed advertising for “access brokers”, suggesting that they’re simply looking for a means of\nentry to potential victim networks and will to carry out the rest of the attacks themselves.\n\nThe advent of affiliates makes the ransomware threat landscape more complex for network defenders, since each\nransomware threat could be delivered by one of multiple different threat actors, many of whom will use differing\nTTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ransomware Threat Actors\n\n##### Miner\n\nAliases: Wizard Spider\n\nRansomware families: Ryuk, Conti, GoGalocker (inactive), MegaCortex (inactive)\n\nActive since: 2014\n\nMiner is believed to be active since at least June 2014 when it began using the Dyre banking Trojan in financial\nfraud campaigns. Dyre became inactive in November 2015, but a new financial Trojan known as Trickbot appeared\nin September 2016. It was subsequently linked to the Miner group because Trickbot and Dyre appeared to share\ncommon authorship.\n\nTrickbot was originally developed as a financial Trojan capable of performing man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to\nintercept online transactions when victims are using online banking applications. It has since been repurposed for\nuse as a credential stealer and acting as a distribution channel for other malware.\n\nMiner also introduced new malware known as BazarLoader and BazarBackdoor in April 2020. Like Trickbot,\nBazarLoader is spread through spam email campaigns and can deliver the second-stage BazarBackdoor payload.\nUnlike Trickbot, the Bazar family appears to have been primarily developed for malware distribution.\n\nDuring 2018, the group branched out into targeted ransomware, using the Ryuk ransomware. Ryuk is based on the\nolder Hermes ransomware family, which it appears to have acquired from the original developer.\n\nRyuk attacks have frequently employed both Trickbot and the Emotet botnets as infection vectors. Publicly\navailable malware such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit are then used to enumerate the network for lateral\nmovement and increase privileges. Once this step is completed, the attackers gain administrative access to domain\ncontrollers. The attackers then use batch files, deployed via PsExec, to disable and delete backup/restoration\ncapabilities and security services throughout the environment.\n\nDuring 2019, Miner began using two new ransomware families, GoGalocker (aka LockerGoga) and MegaCortex.\nBoth shared code with Ryuk and analysis by Symantec found that there was overlap in the command and control\n(C&C) infrastructure used by all three ransomware families. Attacks involving GoGalocker and MegaCortex ceased\nin early 2020.\n\nMiner was then linked to the Conti ransomware, which first appeared in December 2019. There has been some\nspeculation that Conti was created specifically for use by affiliates, under the RaaS model, but this remains\nunconfirmed.\n\nBoth Ryuk and Conti have been distributed using very similar TTPs. A May 2021 investigation by Symantec found\nsignificant overlap in tools used to deliver both. The attacks involved extensive use of variants of Cobalt Strike. In\nsome cases, the infection vector appears to be via the IcedID malware, which delivers malware known as Longlist,\nwhich in turn is used to install Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Leafroller\n\nAliases: REvil\n\nRansomware families: Sodinokibi (inactive), Gandcrab (inactive)\n\nActive since: 2018\n\nLeafroller conducted targeted ransomware attacks using the Sodinokibi ransomware between April 2019 and July\n2021. The group is known to work with affiliates, using the RaaS model. Like many ransomware groups, Leafroller\nand its affiliates routinely steal victim data prior to encryption and then post a sample to publicly available\nwebsites. The attackers then attempt to apply further pressure to extort the victim by threatening to post sensitive\ninformation if they don’t pay the ransom.\n\nPrior to creating Sodinokibi, the group was involved in attacks involving an older strain of ransomware Gandcrab,\nhaving acquired its source code from the original developer. Some of the affiliates it shared Gandcrab with\ncontinued with the group when it transitioned to Sodinokibi.\n\nLeafroller is known for targeting high-profile organizations to maximize the amount of ransom they can extort.\nOne of its most notable victims was Travelex, a foreign exchange service, which was attacked in January 2020 and\n[generated a $2.3 million ransom for the ransomware operators.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/travelex-reportedly-paid-23-million-ransom-to-restore-operations/)\n\n[Leafroller also has a reputation for frequently trialing new TTPs. During 2020, it was observed scanning victim](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sodinokibi-ransomware-cobalt-strike-pos)\n[networks for credit card or point of sale (POS) software. It was not clear if the attackers were targeting this](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sodinokibi-ransomware-cobalt-strike-pos)\n[software for encryption or data theft. In July 2021, Sodinokibi was used in a novel ransomware supply chain attack](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain)\n[involving Kaseya software (see Case Study: Ransomware supply chain attack).](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain)\n\n\n-----\n\nLess than two weeks after the Kaseya attack, infrastructure and websites belonging to Leafroller went\noffline. Both dark net and clear net infrastructure associated with the group was affected, including ransom\nnegotiation websites, data breach websites, and C&C servers. The reason for the group’s disappearance remains\nunclear. However, at the time of writing, there has been no evidence of new Sodinokibi activity.\n\n##### Hispid\n\nAliases: EvilCorp, Indrik Spider, TA505\n\nRansomware families: BitPaymer (retired), DoppelPaymer, WastedLocker, Hades, Phoenix Locker\n\nActive since: 2011\n\nHispid are veteran cyber crime actors, active since approximately 2011. The group was originally involved in financial\nfraud, having been responsible for the Dridex banking Trojan. At its height, Dridex was one of the most prolific\ncyber crime threats, being distributed in massive spam runs that went to millions of email addresses.\n\nAt some point around 2017, the group shifted its focus to targeted ransomware, introducing the BitPaymer\nransomware family. It later introduced a second ransomware family known as DoppelPaymer which was based\naround the same code, albeit with some minor differences. It has been reported that DoppelPaymer was developed\nfor use by affiliates, but Symantec has not been able to confirm this.\n\nIn a similar fashion to how Miner continued to use Trickbot, Hispid continued to use Dridex for a time after its move\nto ransomware, repurposing the malware for use as a precursor tool in ransomware attacks.\n\n[In December 2019, two Russian nationals were indicted on multiple charges in the U.S. relating to the group’s](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hacking-and-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens)\nactivities. A $5 million reward was offered for information leading to their arrest or conviction.\n\nIn May 2020, Hispid retooled and introduced a new family of ransomware known as WastedLocker. Attacks began\nwith a malicious JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish which masquerades as a software update. An\n[investigation by Symantec in June 2020 found SocGholish on more than 150 compromised websites, including](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us)\n[dozens of U.S. newspaper websites.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us)\n\nOnce the attackers had a foothold on the victim’s network, PowerShell was used to download and execute a loader.\nThe loader contained a .NET injector along with a loader for Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\nCobalt Strike Beacon can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes, or\nimpersonate other processes, and upload and download files. The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView\nwas renamed by the attackers to a random name. This command then searched for all the computer objects in the\nActive Directory database.\n\nPrivilege escalation was performed using a publicly documented technique involving the Software Licensing\nUser Interface tool (slui.exe), a Windows command line utility that is responsible for activating and updating the\nWindows operating system.\n\nThe attackers used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute\ncommands on remote computers, such as adding a new user or executing additional downloaded PowerShell\nscripts. Cobalt Strike was also used to carry out credential dumping using ProcDump and to empty log files.\n\nIn order to deploy the ransomware, the attackers used the Windows Sysinternals tool PsExec to launch a legitimate\ncommand line tool for managing Windows Defender (mpcmdrun.exe) to disable scanning of all downloaded files\nand attachments, remove all installed definitions, and, in some cases, disable real-time monitoring.\n\nPsExec was then used to launch PowerShell, which used the win32_service WMI class to retrieve services and the\nnet stop command to stop these services. After Windows Defender was disabled and services had been stopped\nacross the organization, PsExec was used to launch the WastedLocker ransomware itself, which then began\nencrypting data and deleting shadow volumes.\n\nIn March 2021, the group introduced a new variant of ransomware dubbed Hades, which had significant code\noverlap with WastedLocker. It is likely that Hispid developed the Hades ransomware in response to sanctions\nimposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019, which prohibited\nvictims from making payments to the threat group.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the time of writing, the group is reportedly regularly renaming its ransomware due to fears that victims will\nnot pay lest they violate U.S. sanctions. Hades was later rebranded as Phoenix Locker and, as of June 2021, was\nreportedly using the name PayloadBin, which is already associated with the Babuk group, presumably to fool\nvictims into thinking they’d been infected by another actor.\n\n##### Thysanura\n\nAliases: Avaddon\n\nRansomware families: Avaddon\n\nActive since: 2019\n\nActive since at least 2019, Thysanura is known for mounting targeted ransomware campaigns against large\norganizations. The group frequently compromises victims using remote access login credentials—such as RDP and\nVirtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nThysanura operates on a RaaS model, which is advertised on Russian-language cyber-crime forums. The group uses\nmultiple extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying.\n\nAs well as encrypting files, it will also threaten to leak information stolen from victims and in January 2021, it began\ntelling victims that didn’t pay a ransom that it would hit them with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. To\ndate, it has yet to be confirmed if the group has ever followed through on this threat.\n\nAfter the attackers gain access to a victim’s network, they map the network and identify backups for deletion and/\nor encryption. The following tools are used by attackers using Avaddon to compromise victims:\n\n  - PowerShell\n\n  - WMIC.exe (WMI -Windows Management Instrumentation)\n\n  - Svchost.exe (Service host system process)\n\n  - Taskhost.exe (Host protocol)\n\nOn June 11, 2021, the group announced it was shutting down its operation and released the decryption keys for\n[its victims. The gang sent news outlet Bleeping Computer almost three thousand decryption keys, after which](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/)\nthe security firm Emsisoft produced a free, public decryption tool. At the time of writing, it remains unclear as to\nwhether the group’s departure is permanent.\n\n##### Syrphid\n\nAliases: LockBit\n\nRansomware families: Lockbit\n\nActive since: 2019\n\nThe LockBit ransomware first appeared in September 2019 when it was initially known as ABCD, after the file\nextension it was using on encrypted files. In January 2020, Syrphid expanded its operations by shifting to a RaaS\nbusiness model through the creation of an affiliate program.\n\nAttackers using LockBit are known to compromise organizations using brute-force attacks against web servers\nrunning an outdated VPN service. It has also been reported to use mass vulnerability scanning, phishing, and\ncredential stuffing as vectors. It also reportedly buys access to already-compromised servers on underground\nforums.\n\nIn some cases, the attackers will brute forced administrator credentials in order to traverse the network. They have\nalso been known to use post-exploitation frameworks, for privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n\nBefore encrypting files, Syrphid will attempt to identify sensitive data on the target network and export it to an\nexternal hosting service. Affiliates use a unique build of the ransomware for each victim organization.\n\nAttacks involving Lockbit increased markedly in July 2021 and there is some evidence to suggest that Syrphid was\nattempting recruit former Sodinokibi affiliates (see Case Study: Shifting allegiances among affiliates)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Snakefly\n\nAliases: Clop\n\nRansomware families: Clop\n\nActive since: 2019\n\nSnakefly is known for developing the Clop ransomware and frequently leverages distribution channels owned\nby Hispid (aka Evil Corp). The group has been linked to some high-profile incidents, including an attack on the\nUniversity of Maastricht in 2019.\n\nThe group’s attacks generally begin with a malicious email that is sent from a previously compromised account\nto make it more convincing. This email contains an HTML attachment that redirects to a compromised website\nthat then delivers a document containing a malicious macro that drops the Get2 loader. This then downloads the\nSDBot malware or other remote access tools (RATs) to assist the attackers in moving laterally across the network,\nexfiltrate data, and download the Clop ransomware.\n\nSome of the ransomware payloads have a signed certificate that can help them appear legitimate and potentially\nbypass security measures. Once Clop is executed, it searches for security products to delete. It has been seen by\na third party deleting or stopping security products from Malwarebytes, ESET, and Microsoft. The ransomware\nencrypts files and adds a .clop extension to infected files, before placing a ransom note on the machine.\n\nIt is also known to exfiltrate data from victims prior to encryption and threaten to release it unless a ransom is paid.\nLike most ransomware groups these days, the group also runs a Clop data leaks website where it publishes data\nstolen from victims who have refused to pay a ransom.\n\n##### Coreid\n\nAliases: Darkside\n\nRansomware Families: Darkside, BlackMatter (unconfirmed)\n\nActive since: 2020\n\nCoreid was, for a brief period of time, one of the most prolific targeted ransomware threats and was used in a\nnumber of ambitious attacks, most notably the May 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline that disrupted fuel supplies to\nthe East Coast of the U.S.\n\nCoreid operated under a RaaS model, working with affiliates to conduct ransomware attacks and takes a share of\nthe profits. Like most ransomware actors, attacks linked to Coreid steal victims’ data and the group then threatens\nto publish it to further pressure victims into paying the ransom demand.\n\nOnce on a victim’s network, attackers using Darkside generally begin exfiltrating data, credentials, and other\nsensitive information. The attackers also attempt to move laterally across the network to gain access to the domain\ncontroller (DC). Once on the DC they exfiltrate sensitive information and also used PowerShell to download the\nDarkSide binary.\n\nThe attackers are known to create a shared folder using the company’s name on the DC itself, and copy the\nDarkside binary to it. Subsequently, the attackers use BITSAdmin to distribute the ransomware binary from the\nshared folder to other computers on the network.\n\nCoreid affiliates use TOR to communicate with victims and manage administration of the ransomware. Coreid\nreportedly encourage their affiliates to request Monero in ransomware demands, presumably due to that\ncryptocurrency’s high level of anonymity.\n\nCoreid appeared to become inactive following the Colonial attack after some of its infrastructure was taken offline.\n\n[In late July 2021, media reports linked Coreid to a new ransomware threat named BlackMatter. The ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/)\nis believed to use the same encryption routines as used by Darkside. In an interview with Recorded Future,\n[BlackMatter’s developer denied the link, saying “we are familiar with the Darkside team from working together](https://therecord.media/an-interview-with-blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-thats-learning-from-the-mistakes-of-darkside-and-revil/)\nin the past but we are not them, although we are intimate with their ideas.” However, Blockchain analysis firm\nChainalysis also found financial links between the two threats and concluded that BlackMatter was created by\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Hornworm\n\nAliases: RagnarLocker, Viking Spider\n\nRansomware Families: RagnarLocker\n\nActive since: 2020\n\nHornworm is associated with the RagnarLocker ransomware. RagnarLocker first appeared in early 2020 and was\nthe subject of an FBI flash alert in November 2020. The FBI reported that it had encrypted computers on a large\ncorporation’s network and demanded an $11 million ransom, threatening to release 10 TB of stolen data if the\nransom wasn’t paid. Since then, it has mounted ransomware attacks against a range of other organizations in the\nUnited States.\n\nIn a bid to avoid detection, RagnarLocker is reported to be deployed as a full virtual machine on each infected\ncomputer. In some cases, the payload was delivered in an MSI package, which includes a working installation\nof an old Oracle VirtualBox (Sun xVM VirtualBox version 3.0.4) and a virtual disk image file (VDI) named micro.\nvdi— an image of a stripped-down version of the Windows XP SP3 operating system, called MicroXP v0.82. The\nimage includes a 49 kB ransomware payload. While Hornworm may have pioneered this tactic, Symantec has since\n[observed attackers using other payloads also attempt to run them from virtual machines.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ransomware-virtual-machines)\n\nRagnarLocker appends encrypted files with the extension .RGNR_<ID>, where <ID> is a hash of the computer’s\nNETBIOS name. The attackers, identifying themselves as RAGNAR_LOCKER, leave a .txt ransom note on\ncomputers, with instructions on how to pay the ransom and receive a decryption key. The group is known to\nfrequently change obfuscation techniques and has VMProtect, UPX, and custom packing algorithms.\n\nHornworm reportedly exfiltrates data from victim organizations prior to encryption and threatens to release this\ndata unless a ransom is paid. It uses a dedicated data leak website for this purpose, hosted on Tor.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Leaftier\n\nAliases: Babuk\n\nRansomware Families: Babuk\n\nActive since: 2021\n\nFirst finding public attention in early 2021, Leaftier is notable for its heavy focus on data breach extortion. The\ngroup initially operated under an RaaS business model and used double extortion tactics, stealing data from victims\nas well as encrypting files. However, Leaftier later announced that it was foregoing encryption and focusing only on\ndata theft as a way to extort money from victims.\n\nBabuk was found to have a high degree of similarities with another ransomware threat called Vasa Locker. A Vasa\nsample analyzed by McAfee shared approximately 86% of the same codebase as Babuk and was compiled one\nmonth before the first release of Babuk. It is likely that the actors behind Babuk and Vasa Locker are one and the\nsame, or have strong links to one another.\n\nIn late April 2021, Leaftier announced that it was closing its affiliate program and moving to an extortion model\nthat did not rely on encrypting victim computers. The group said it would instead focus on demanding ransoms for\ninformation stolen from its victims.\n\nIn May 2021, Leaftier announced the development of a platform for “independent leaks” which would be a data leak\nwebsite for other actors to use. At the same time the group rebranded, changing the name on its new leak website\n(Payload.bin) from Babuk to Payload Bin.\n\nIn early July 2021, it was reported that Leaftier had seemingly returned to using ransomware to target corporate\nnetworks. The gang began using a new version of its Babuk ransomware (Babuk v.2.0) and moved to a new data\nleak website.\n\n##### Leaffolder\n\nAliases: Maze, Egregor\n\nRansomware Families: Maze, Egregor\n\nActive since: 2019\n\nThe first evidence of Leaffolder activity dates from May 2019, with the appearance of the Maze ransomware.\nLeaffolder is best known for pioneering the tactic of exfiltrating data from victim organizations prior to encryption\nand threatening to release this data unless the ransom is paid. The tactic was quickly copied by a range of other\ntargeted ransomware groups.\n\nMaze’s main distribution channels were the Fallout and Spelevo exploit kits, with victims being directed to them\nvia spam email campaigns. Once the attackers gain access to a single computer on a network, they download the\ncommodity malware Cobalt Strike and the Metasploit Framework in order to move laterally across the network and\nenumerate machines.\n\nIn October 2020, Leaffolder announced that it was shutting down the Maze ransomware operation. The group was\nsubsequently linked to a new ransomware operation known as Egregor, which appeared shortly after Maze was\nretired. Many former Maze affiliates migrated to using Egregor.\n\nAffiliates of Egregor were subject to a law enforcement operation in February 2021. Egregor is believed to have\nbecome inactive since this occurred.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Canthroid\n\nAliases: UNC2447\n\nRansomware: Thieflock\n\nActive Since: 2021\n\nCanthroid first appeared in early 2021 when it began performing targeted ransomware attacks using Thieflock. It as\noperates an RaaS program.\n\nTo date, it is known for compromising victims using the exploit of a zero-day vulnerability in Sonicwall VPN (CVE2021-20016). The vulnerability was patched in February 2021, but Canthroid has continued to attack organizations\nusing unpatched versions of the software. Successful exploit allows the attacker to create their own credentials and\njoin the target’s network.\n\nOnce inside the network, the group has been observed using SoftPerfect Network Scanner, a publicly available tool\nused for discovery of hostnames and network services. It is also known to use SombRAT, a custom remote access\ntool which allows the attackers to download further tools and maintain communications with a C&C server.\n\nPrior to encryption, the group is known to exfiltrate data from the target’s network. The attackers are reported to\nuse pCloud, an encrypted cloud storage service.\n\n### Tools, Tactics, and Procedures\n\nMost ransomware attacks are a multi-staged process and targeted ransomware attacks in particular usually involve\na large number of steps and a significant level of interaction on the part of the attackers. An array of tools, tactics,\nand procedures (TTPs) are employed to infiltrate the victim’s network, steal credentials, elevate privileges, move\nlaterally across the network, and deploy a ransomware payload on multiple computers.\n\nKnowing the TTPs used by ransomware attackers allows network defenders to better understand how their\norganizations could be compromised and can provide some guidance on prioritization of defensive measures.\nFor example, the Windows tools such as PsExec are frequently abused by attackers and reducing the number of\naccounts with administrator privileges whilst increasing protection on administrator accounts may mitigate the risk\nof a successful attack.\n\nTable 1: Most Frequently Seen Ransomware TTPs, April 2021 – June 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nBy examining the results of recent ransomware investigations where precursor tools were found, Symantec was\nable to obtain a picture of which were the most commonly used TTPs in ransomware attacks. While the most\nfrequently employed tool was the commodity malware Cobalt Strike (seen in 41% of investigations), a large\nproportion of the list was taken up by freely available, dual-use tools or operating system features, such as PsExec\nand WMI.\n\n   - Cobalt Strike: An off-the-shelf tool that can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate\ncurrent processes, or impersonate other processes, and upload and download files. It ostensibly has\nlegitimate uses as a penetration testing tool but is invariably exploited by malicious actors.\n\n   - PsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The tool is primarily used by\nattackers to move laterally on victim networks.\n\n   - Netscan: SoftPerfect Network Scanner, a publicly available tool used for discovery of hostnames and network\nservices.\n\n   - Mimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering\nWindows passwords in plaintext depending on the configuration.\n\n   - Adfind: A free tool that can be used to query Active Directory.\n\n   - Weirdloop: Weirdloop, CobaltStrike HTTPS Stager loader used in some attacks involving Ryuk during 2021.\n\n   - IcedID: Botnet malware that was originally developed as a financial Trojan but is now frequently working in\ncollaboration with ransomware attackers.\n\n   - SystemBC: Commodity malware which can open a backdoor on the infected computer and use the SOCKS5\nproxy protocol to communicate with a C&C server.\n\n   - ProcDump: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash\ndumps, but which can also be used as a general process dump utility.\n\n   - Nsudo: Open-source system management tool that can be abused to elevate privileges.\n\n   - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) (wmic.exe): Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to\nexecute commands on remote computers.\n\n   - Qakbot: Botnet malware that was originally developed as a financial Trojan.\n\n   - **BITSAdmin: A Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to create download or upload jobs and monitor**\ntheir progress.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Infection Vectors\n\nTargeted ransomware groups use a diverse range of distribution methods. Because of the relatively low prevalence\nof targeted ransomware attacks, the infection vector can sometimes be difficult to establish. Targeted ransomware\ngroups often take their cues from espionage groups in their methods for gaining a foothold on the victim’s\nnetwork.\n\n##### Secondary Infections\n\nOver the past twelve months, this has quickly become one of the most prevalent means of access for ransomware\ngroups. Generally speaking, it involves malware that is distributed using mass-mailing botnets, since it provides\nransomware groups with a large pool of potential victims. Trojans that were once used for financial fraud, such as\nTrickbot, have recently been used mainly as distribution channels for other malware, most notably ransomware.\n\nIn some cases, ransomware attackers already control the botnets, such as the Miner group, which owns the Trickbot\nbotnet. Trickbot has been seen as a precursor to attacks by Ryuk, which is attributed to Miner. Similarly, Hispid have\nleveraged their own Dridex botnet, which was originally built to mount financial attacks, to give them a means of\ndelivering the ransomware to organizations.\n\nOther actors have since attempted to replicate this attack pattern, seeking collaborations with established botnet\noperators. The most notable of these is the use of IcedID by at least one affiliate operator of the Conti ransomware\n(see Case Study: IcedID and Conti collaboration).\n\n## Case Study: IcedID and Conti Collaboration\n\nSeveral recent investigations by Symantec into malware known as Longlist, which in turn is used to\nattacks involving the Conti ransomware found install Cobalt Strike. Other tools used in the attack\na consistent attack chain in multiple attacks, included the publicly available credential dumping\nsuggesting that at least one attacker using Conti had tool LaZagne and Adfind, a free dual-use tool that\nbegun to collaborate with the IcedID botnet. can be used to query Active Directory.\n\nThe first evidence of malicious activity in targeted While IcedID is widely distributed malware, its\norganizations was the presence of IcedID on the presence along with these other tools is likely to\ntarget’s network. IcedID was then used to deliver suggest a ransomware attack in preparation.\n\n##### Phishing\n\nPhishing is one of the most widely utilized infection vectors, with emails sent to employees disguised as workrelated correspondence (invoices, delivery confirmation etc.). Some phishing campaigns may be indiscriminate,\na wide-ranging trawl for victims of interest. In other cases, attackers may pre-select their victim and send spearphishing emails to selected employees in the organization.\n\nSpear-phishing campaigns may be tailored to the target, using subject matter relevant to the organization’s\nbusiness. If the recipient is tricked into opening a malicious attachment or following a malicious link, malware will be\ndownloaded to the victim’s machine, allowing the attackers to begin moving across the victim’s network.\n\n##### Malvertising\n\nHitherto not known as an infection vector for ransomware, malvertising was leveraged during 2020 by the\noperators of WastedLocker. The group has been observed compromising media websites in order to serve\nmalicious ads containing a JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish which masquerades as a software\nupdate.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nAnother route onto an organization’s network is exploiting vulnerable software running on public-facing servers.\nIn most cases to date, zero-day vulnerabilities have not been used and the attackers exploited known vulnerabilities\nin unpatched software, such as JBoss or Apache web server. One of the primary users of this tactic was the now\ndefunct SamSam group, which ceased operations in November 2019. More recently, the Canthroid group is known\nfor compromising victims using the exploit of a zero-day vulnerability in Sonicwall VPN (CVE-2021-20016), while\nthe Proxylogon Exchange Server vulnerability was also leveraged by several actors to perform ransomware attacks.\n\n##### Poorly Secured Services\n\nAnother infection vector comes from compromising poorly secured services. Crysis (aka Dharma) has repeatedly\nbeen observed attacking organizations through poorly secured RDP services, taking advantage of leaked or weak\ncredentials. The now defunct GandCrab group was observed scanning the internet for exposed MySQL databases\nthat it was then infecting with malware.\n\n### Protection\n\n**How Symantec Solutions Can Help**\nThe Symantec Enterprise Business provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to address today’s\nsecurity challenges and protect data and digital infrastructure from multifaceted threats.

While\nmany vendors offer EDR to help find intrusions, as does Symantec, there are gaps. We call these gaps blind spots and\nthere are technologies in SESC to eliminate them.\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/endpoint/end-user/complete)\n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**\nPAM is designed to prevent security breaches by protecting sensitive administrative credentials, controlling privileged\nuser access, proactively enforcing security policies and monitoring and recording privileged user activity.\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/identity/pam)\n\n**Symantec Web Isolation**\nSymantec Web Isolation eliminates web threats and solves the challenge of providing access to unknown, uncategorized\nand potentially risky web sites by creating a remote execution environment between an agency’s enterprise systems and\ncontent servers on the web.\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/network/gateway/web-isolation)\n\n**Symantec Secure Web Gateway (SWG)**\nSWG delivers high-performance on-premises or cloud secure web gateway that organizations can leverage to control or\nblock access to unknown, uncategorized, or high-risk web sites.\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/network/gateway/proxy-sg-and-advanced-secure-gateway)\n\n**Symantec Intelligence Services**\nSymantec Intelligence Services leverages Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network to deliver real-time threat intelligence\nto several Symantec network security solutions including Symantec Secure Web Gateway, Symantec Content Analysis,\nSymantec Security Analytics, and more.\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/network/gateway/webfilter-intelligent-services)\n\n**Symantec Content Analysis with Advanced Sandboxing**\nWithin the Symantec Content Analysis platform, zero-day threats are automatically escalated and brokered to Symantec\nMalware Analysis with dynamic sandboxing for deep inspection and behavioral analysis of potential APT files and toolkits.\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/network/gateway/atp-content-malware-analysis)\n\n**Symantec Security Analytics**\nSymantec Security Analytics delivers enriched, full-packet capture for full network traffic analysis, advanced\nnetwork forensics, anomaly detection, and real-time content inspection for all network traffic to arm incident\nresponders for quick resolution.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mitigation\n\nSymantec recommends users observe the following best practices to protect against targeted attacks.\n\n**Local Environment:**\n\n  - Monitor the use of dual-use tools inside your network.\n\n  - Ensure you have the latest version of PowerShell and you have logging enabled.\n\n  - Restrict access to RDP Services. Only allow RDP from specific known IP addresses and ensure you are using\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n  - Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time\ncredentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.\n\n  - Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally\nundetected through a network.\n\n  - Use application whitelisting where applicable.\n\n  - Locking down PowerShell can increase security, for example with the constrained language mode.\n\n  - Make credential dumping more difficult, for example by enabling credential guard in Windows 10 or disabling\nSeDebugPrivilege.\n\n  - MFA can help limit the usefulness of compromised credentials.\n\n   - **Create a plan to consider notification of outside parties. In order to ensure correct notification of required**\norganizations, such as the FBI or other law enforcement authorities/agencies, be sure to have a plan in place\nto verify.\n\n**• Create a “jump bag” with hard copies and archived soft copies of all critical administrative information. In**\norder to protect against the compromise of the availability of this critical information, store it in a jump bag\nwith hardware and software needed to troubleshoot problems. Storing this information on the network is not\nhelpful when network files are encrypted.\n\n**Email:**\n\n  - Enable MFA to prevent the compromise of credentials during phishing attacks.\n\n  - Harden security architecture around email systems to minimize the amount of spam that reaches end-user\ninboxes and ensure you are following best practices for your email system, including the use of SPF and other\ndefensive measures against phishing attacks.\n\n**Backup:**\n\n**• Implement offsite storage of backup copies. Arrange for offsite storage of at least four weeks of weekly full**\nand daily incremental backups.\n\n**• Implement offline backups that are onsite. Make sure you have backups that are not connected to the**\nnetwork to prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.\n\n**• Verify and test your server-level backup solution. This should already be part of your Disaster Recovery**\nprocess.\n\n**• Secure the file-level permissions for backups and backup databases. Don’t let your backups get encrypted.**\n\n**• Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business.**\n\n**[For product information and a complete list of distributors, visit our website at: broadcom.com](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security)**\n\nCopyright © 2021 Broadcom.
