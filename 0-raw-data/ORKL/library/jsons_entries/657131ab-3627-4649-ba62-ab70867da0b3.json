We hope never, because it’s one of the most common indicators that you’ve lost\naccess to your files. And if there are no publicly available decryptors or you don’t have any\nbackup copies, you’re in trouble.\n\nNowadays, cybercriminals have a thousand and one ways of creating and spreading\n[ransomware. There are two common scenarios behind the creation of this kind of malware:](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/cryptomalware/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nin one, the criminals prefer to just reconfigure existing malicious source code; in the other,\nthey choose to write their own ransomware, sometimes even using very specific languages.\n\nHowever, don’t despair, because those fighting ransomware are not standing still either. In\nfact, we have two pieces of good news to share with you.\n\n## Good news #1\n\n\n-----\n\nWe’ve released a decryptor for the Yatron ransomware. The authors of the ransomware\nchose the first scenario mentioned above and based their ‘creation’ on the code used in\nHidden Tear, a well-known sample of open-source ransomware. According to our statistics,\nduring the last year alone our products have prevented more than 600 infections by various\nmodifications of Trojan-Ransom.MSIL.Tear, with most attacks recorded in Germany, China,\nthe Russian Federation, India and Myanmar.\n\nAmong the numerous modifications of Trojan-Ransom.MSIL.Tear, this one can be\ndistinguished by the extension .Yatron that’s appended to encrypted files.\n\nHowever, using third-party code without checking it raises the risk of critical vulnerabilities\naffecting the overall effectiveness of the program. That’s what happened here. Due to\nmistakes in the cryptographic scheme we were able to create a decryptor.\n\n## Good news #2\n\nWe’ve released a decryptor for the unique FortuneCrypt ransomware. To describe this\nmalware, we could paraphrase Archimedes: give me a programming language, and I will\nwrite a ransomware program. The main feature of this ransomware is that it was compiled\nusing a BlitzMax compiler. As [Wikipedia states: “Being derived from BASIC, Blitz syntax was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC)\ndesigned to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program. The languages are\ngame-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for\n\n\n-----\n\nmost types of application . We ve seen lots of ransomware written in C/C++, C#, Delphi, JS,\nPython, etc., but FortuneCrypt is the first ransomware we’ve seen that’s written in Blitz\nBASIC.\n\nDuring the last year, our products registered more than 6,000 attacks carried out by the\nnumerous variations of the malicious Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Crypren family (FortuneCrypt is\npart of this family). The top five countries attacked by the malware are: the Russian\nFederation, Brazil, Germany, South Korea and Iran.\n\nThe cryptor changes neither the file extension nor the file name; instead, it marks encrypted\nfiles by adding a text string to the beginning of an encrypted file.\n\nThe only indicator of infection visible to the victim is a ransom text that appears on the\nscreen.\n\nAfter some analysis, we found that the cryptographic scheme used by the malware is weak\nand the encrypted files can be easily recovered.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Decryptors\n\nBoth the decryptors mentioned here have been added to our RakhniDecryptor tool, which\ncan be downloaded from the following sources:\n\n[https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/disinfection/10556](https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/disinfection/10556)\n\n[https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html)\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Yatron ransomware**\n\n7910B3F3A04644D12B8E656AA4934C59A4E3083A2A9C476BF752DC54192C255B\n\n**FortuneCrypt**\n\nE2B9B48755BCA1EDFBA5140753E3AF83FB0AE724E36D8C83AB23E262196D1080\nC26192E7B14991ED39D6586F8C88A86AF4467D5E296F75487BB62B920DEA533F\nF2DCD2308C18FDB56A22B7DB44E60CDB9118043830E03DF02DAC34E4C4752587\n\n[Encryption](https://securelist.com/tag/encryption/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\nAuthors\n\nAMR\n\nRansomware: two pieces of good news\n\nYour email address will not be published.
