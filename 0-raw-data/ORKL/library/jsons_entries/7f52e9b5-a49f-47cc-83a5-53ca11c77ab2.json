FireEye assesses that APT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with\ncommercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests.\n\n## APT32 and FireEye’s Community Response\n\nIn the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business interests in Vietnam, FireEye’s\nMandiant incident response consultants uncovered activity and attacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a\nsignificant intrusion campaign. In March 2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team launched\n[a Community Protection Event (CPE) – a coordinated effort between Mandiant incident responders, FireEye as a](https://www2.fireeye.com/WEB-Community-Protection-Security-Numbers.html)\nService (FaaS), FireEye iSight Intelligence, and FireEye product engineering – to protect all clients from APT32\nactivity.\n\nIn the following weeks, FireEye released threat intelligence products and updated malware profiles to customers\nwhile developing new detection techniques for APT32’s tools and phishing lures. This focused intelligence and\ndetection effort led to new external victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link\ntwelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor activity into FireEye’s newest\nnamed advanced persistent threat group: APT32.\n\n## APT32 Targeting of Private Sector Company Operations in Southeast Asia\n\nSince at least 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in Vietnam’s\nmanufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors. Furthermore, there are indications that APT32 actors\nare targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations, as well as consulting firms that\nmay have connections with foreign investors.\n\nHere is an overview of intrusions investigated by FireEye that are attributed to APT32:\n\nIn 2014, a European corporation was compromised prior to constructing a manufacturing facility in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2016, Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations working in network security, technology infrastructure,\nbanking, and media industries were targeted.\n\nIn mid-2016, malware that FireEye believes to be unique to APT32 was detected on the networks of a global\nhospitality industry developer with plans to expand operations into Vietnam.\n\nFrom 2016 through 2017, two subsidiaries of U.S. and Philippine consumer products corporations, located\ninside Vietnam, were the target of APT32 intrusion operations.\n\nIn 2017, APT32 compromised the Vietnamese offices of a global consulting firm.\n\nTable 1 shows a breakdown of APT32 activity, including the malware families used in each.\n\n|Year|Country|Industry|Malware|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|2014|Germany|Manufacturing|WINDSHIELD|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2015|Vietnam|Media|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|Philippines|Consumer products|KOMPROGO WINDSHIELD SOUNDBITE BEACON|\n|2016|Vietnam|Banking|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|Philippines|Technology Infrastructure|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|China|Hospitality|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|Vietnam|Media|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|United States|Consumer Products|WINDSHIELD PHOREAL BEACON SOUNDBITE|\n|2017|United Kingdom|Consulting|SOUNDBITE|\n\n\nTable 1: APT32 Private Sector Targeting Identified by FireEye\n\n## APT32 Interest in Political Influence and Foreign Governments\n\nIn addition to focused targeting of the private sector with ties to Vietnam, APT32 has also targeted foreign\ngovernments, as well as Vietnamese dissidents and journalists since at least 2013. Here is an overview of this\nactivity:\n\n[A public blog published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation indicated that journalists, activists, dissidents,](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/vietnamese-malware-gets-personal)\nand bloggers were targeted in 2013 by malware and tactics consistent with APT32 operations.\n\nIn 2014, APT32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled “Plans to crackdown on protesters at the\nEmbassy of Vietnam.exe,\" which targeted dissident activity among the Vietnamese diaspora in Southeast\nAsia. Also in 2014, APT32 carried out an intrusion against a Western country’s national legislature.\n\n[In 2015, SkyEye Labs, the security research division of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360, released a report](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/oceanlotus-apt)\ndetailing threat actors that were targeting Chinese public and private entities including government agencies,\nresearch institutes, maritime agencies, sea construction, and shipping enterprises. The information included\nin the report indicated that the perpetrators used the same malware, overlapping infrastructure, and similar\ntargets as APT32.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, two Vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that FireEye assesses to be\nunique to APT32.\n\nIn 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that they were likely used to\ntarget members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well as government employees in the Philippines.\n\n## APT32 Tactics\n\n\n-----\n\nremote servers. APT32 actors continue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails.\n\nAPT32 actors designed multilingual lure documents which were tailored to specific victims. Although the files had\n“.doc” file extensions, the recovered phishing lures were ActiveMime “.mht” web page archives that contained text\nand images. These files were likely created by exporting Word documents into single file web pages.\n\nTable 2 contains a sample of recovered APT32 multilingual lure files.\n\n**ActiveMime Lure Files** **MD5**\n\n2017年员工工资性津贴额统计报告.doc 5458a2e4d784abb1a1127263bd5006b5\n(2017 Statistical Report on Staff Salary and Allowances)\n\nThong tin.doc ce50e544430e7265a45fab5a1f31e529\n(Information)\n\nPhan Vu Tutn CV.doc 4f761095ca51bfbbf4496a4964e41d4f\n\nKe hoach cuu tro nam 2017.doc e9abe54162ba4572c770ab043f576784\n(2017 Bailout Plan)\n\nInstructions to GSIS.doc fba089444c769700e47c6b44c362f96b\n\nHoi thao truyen thong doc lap.doc f6ee4b72d6d42d0c7be9172be2b817c1\n(Traditional Games)\n\nGiấy yêu cầu bồi thường mới 2016 - hằng.doc aa1f85de3e4d33f31b4f78968b29f175\n(New 2016 Claim Form)\n\nHoa don chi tiet tien no.doc 5180a8d9325a417f2d8066f9226a5154\n(Debt Details)\n\nThu moi tham du Hoi luan.doc f6ee4b72d6d42d0c7be9172be2b817c1\n(Collection of Participants)\n\nDanh sach nhan vien vi pham ky luat.doc 6baafffa7bf960dec821b627f9653e44\n(List of Employee Violations)\n\nNội-dung-quả ng-cá o.doc 471a2e7341f2614b715dc89e803ffcac\n(Internal Content Advertising)\n\nHĐ DVPM-VTC 31.03.17.doc f1af6bb36cdf3cff768faee7919f0733\n\nTable 2: Sampling of APT32 Lure Files\n\nThe Base64 encoded ActiveMime data also contained an OLE file with malicious macros.

In all phishing lures analyzed, the external images did not exist. Mandiant consultants\nsuspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images. When\ncombined with email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success rate, and\nconduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security firms.\n\nOnce macros were enabled on the target system, the malicious macros created two named scheduled tasks as\npersistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected system. The first named scheduled task launched an\napplication whitelisting script protection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first\nbackdoor from APT32’s infrastructure and injected it into memory. The second named scheduled task, loaded as an\nXML file to falsify task attributes, ran a JavaScript code block that downloaded and launched a secondary backdoor,\ndelivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script. In most lures, one scheduled task persisted an APT32-specific\nbackdoor and the other scheduled task initialized a commercially-available backdoor as backup.\n\nTo illustrate the complexity of these lures, Figure 4 shows the creation of persistence mechanisms for recovered\nAPT32 lure “2017年员工工资性津贴额统计报告.doc”.\n\nFigure 4: APT32 ActiveMime Lures Create Two Named Scheduled Tasks\n\nIn this example, a scheduled task named “Windows Scheduled Maintenance” was created to run Casey Smith’s\n[“Squiblydoo” App Whitelisting bypass every 30 minutes. While all payloads can be dynamically updated, at the time](http://subt0x10.blogspot.com/2016/04/bypass-application-whitelisting-script.html)\nof delivery, this task launched a COM scriptlet (“.sct” file extension) that downloaded and executed Meterpreter\nhosted on images.chinabytes[.]info. Meterpreter then loaded Cobalt Strike BEACON, configured to communicate\n[with 80.255.3[.]87 using the Safebrowsing malleable C2 profile to further blend in with network traffic. A second](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/safebrowsing.profile)\nscheduled task named “Scheduled Defrags” was created by loading the raw task XML with a backdated task\ncreation timestamp of June 2, 2016. This second task ran “mshta.exe” every 50 minutes which launched an APT32\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the chain of events for a single successful APT32 phishing lure that dynamically injects two multistage malware frameworks into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: APT32 Phishing Chain of Events\n\nThe impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim environments. Several\nMandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access, APT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and\n[heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon’s Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation)\nframework.\n\nAPT32 regularly used stealthy techniques to blend in with legitimate user activity:\n\nDuring one investigation, APT32 was observed using a privilege escalation exploit (CVE-2016-7255)\nmasquerading as a Windows hotfix.\n\nIn another investigation, APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to distribute their malware as a\nsoftware deployment task in which all systems pulled the payload from the ePO server using the proprietary\nSPIPE protocol.\n\nAPT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their malware on a system.\nFor example, APT32 installed one backdoor as a persistent service with a legitimate service name that had a\nUnicode no-break space character appended to it. Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL\nfilename padded with a non-printing OS command control code.\n\n## APT32 Malware and Infrastructure\n\nAPT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite of backdoors spanning\nmultiple protocols. APT32 operations are characterized through deployment of signature malware payloads\nincluding WINDSHIELD, KOMPROGO, SOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL. APT32 often deploys these backdoors along\nwith the commercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor. APT32 may also possess backdoor development\ncapabilities for macOS.\n\nThe capabilities for this unique suite of malware is shown in Table 3.\n\n|Malware|Capabilities|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand and control (C2) communications via TCP raw sockets\n\nFour configured C2s and six configured ports – randomly-chosen C2/port for\ncommunications\n\nRegistry manipulation\n\nGet the current module's file name\n\nGather system information including registry values, user name, computer name,\nand current code page\n\nFile system interaction including directory creation, file deletion, reading, and writing\nfiles\n\nLoad additional modules and execute code\n\nTerminate processes\n\nAnti-disassembly\n\n|KOMPROGO|Fully-featured backdoor capable of process, file, and registry management Creating a reverse shell File transfers Running WMI queries Retrieving information about the infected system|\n|---|---|\n|SOUNDBITE|C2 communications via DNS Process creation File upload Shell command execution File and directory enumeration/manipulation Window enumeration Registry manipulation System information gathering|\n|PHOREAL|C2 communications via ICMP Reverse shell creation Filesystem manipulation Registry manipulation Process creation File upload|\n\n\n-----\n\nStrike) Publicly available payload that can inject and execute arbitrary code into processes\n\nImpersonating the security context of users\n\nImporting Kerberos tickets\n\nUploading and downloading files\n\nExecuting shell commands\n\nConfigured with malleable C2 profiles to blend in with normal network traffic\n\nCo-deployment and interoperability with Metasploit framework\n\nSMB Named Pipe in-memory backdoor payload that enables peer-to-peer C2 and\npivoting over SMB\n\nTable 3: APT32 Malware and Capabilities\n\nAPT32 operators appear to be well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of domains and IP addresses\n[as command and control infrastructure. The FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional](https://www.fireeye.com/products/isight-intelligence.html)\ninformation on these backdoor families based on Mandiant investigations of APT32 intrusions.\n\nFigure 6 provides a summary of APT32 tools and techniques mapped to each stage of the attack lifecycle.\n\nFigure 6: APT32 Attack Lifecycle\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nBased on incident response investigations, product detections, and intelligence observations along with additional\npublications on the same operators, FireEye assesses that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with\nVietnamese government interests. The targeting of private sector interests by APT32 is notable and FireEye\nbelieves the actor poses significant risk to companies doing business in, or preparing to invest in, the country. While\nthe motivation for each APT32 private sector compromise varied – and in some cases was unknown – the\nunauthorized access could serve as a platform for law enforcement, intellectual property theft, or anticorruption\nmeasures that could ultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations. Furthermore, APT32\ncontinues to threaten political activism and free speech in Southeast Asia and the public sector worldwide.\nGovernments journalists and members of the Vietnam diaspora may continue to be targeted\n\n\n-----\n\nresponded to by FireEye, APT32 reflects a growing host of new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability.\nAPT32 demonstrates how accessible and impactful offensive capabilities can be with the proper investment and the\nflexibility to embrace newly-available tools and techniques. As more countries utilize inexpensive and efficient cyber\noperations, there is a need for public awareness of these threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nationstate intrusions that go beyond public sector and intelligence targets.\n\n## APT32 Detection\n\nFigure 7 contains a Yara rule can be used to identify malicious macros associated with APT32’s phishing lures:\n\nFigure 7: Yara Rule for APT32 Malicious Macros\n\nTable 4 contains a sampling of the infrastructure that FireEye has associated with APT32 C2.\n\n**C2 Infrastructure**\n\n103.53.197.202 104.237.218.70 104.237.218.72\n\n185.157.79.3 193.169.245.78 193.169.245.137\n\n23.227.196.210 24.datatimes.org 80.255.3.87\n\nblog.docksugs.org blog.panggin.org contay.deaftone.com\n\ncheck.paidprefund.org datatimes.org docksugs.org\n\neconomy.bloghop.org emp.gapte.name facebook-cdn.net\n\ngap-facebook.com gl-appspot.org help.checkonl.org\n\nhigh.expbas.net high.vphelp.net icon.torrentart.com\n\n|C2 Infrastructure|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|103.53.197.202|104.237.218.70|104.237.218.72|\n|185.157.79.3|193.169.245.78|193.169.245.137|\n|23.227.196.210|24.datatimes.org|80.255.3.87|\n|blog.docksugs.org|blog.panggin.org|contay.deaftone.com|\n|check.paidprefund.org|datatimes.org|docksugs.org|\n|economy.bloghop.org|emp.gapte.name|facebook-cdn.net|\n|gap-facebook.com|gl-appspot.org|help.checkonl.org|\n\n\n-----\n\n|images.chinabytes.info|imaps.qki6.com|img.fanspeed.net|\n|---|---|---|\n|job.supperpow.com|lighpress.info|menmin.strezf.com|\n|mobile.pagmobiles.info|news.lighpress.info|notificeva.com|\n|nsquery.net|pagmobiles.info|paidprefund.org|\n|push.relasign.org|relasign.org|share.codehao.net|\n|seri.volveri.net|ssl.zin0.com|static.jg7.org|\n|syn.timeizu.net|teriava.com|timeizu.net|\n|tonholding.com|tulationeva.com|untitled.po9z.com|\n|update-flashs.com|vieweva.com|volveri.net|\n|vphelp.net|yii.yiihao126.net|zone.apize.net|\n\n\nTable 4: Sampling of APT32 C2 Infrastructure\n\n\n-----",
