They have made headlines in recent years\nby threatening the operation of governments, critical\ninfrastructure, and corporations. Collecting and analyzing ransomware data is an important step towards\nunderstanding the spread of ransomware and designing effective defense and mitigation mechanisms. We\nreport on our experience operating Ransomwhere, an\nopen crowdsourced ransomware payment tracker to collect information from victims of ransomware attacks.\nWith Ransomwhere, we have gathered 13.5k ransom payments to more than 87 ransomware criminal actors with\ntotal payments of more than $101 million. Leveraging\nthe transparent nature of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency\nused for most ransomware payments, we characterize\nthe evolving ransomware criminal structure and ransom\nlaundering strategies. Our analysis shows that there are\ntwo parallel ransomware criminal markets: commodity\nransomware and Ransomware as a Service (RaaS). We\nnotice that there are striking differences between the two\nmarkets in the way that cryptocurrency resources are\nutilized, revenue per transaction, and ransom laundering\nefficiency. Although it is relatively easy to identify choke\npoints in commodity ransomware payment activity, it is\nmore difficult to do the same for RaaS.\n\n#### 1 INTRODUCTION\nRansomware, a form of malware designed to encrypt\na victim’s files and make them unusable without payment, has quickly become a threat to the functioning of\nmany institutions and corporations around the globe. In\n2021 alone, ransomware caused major hospital disruptions in Ireland [3], empty supermarket shelves in the\nNetherlands [8], the closing of 800 supermarket stores\nin Sweden [4], and gasoline shortages in the United\nStates [20]. In a recent report, the European Union\nAgency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) ranked ransomware\nas the “prime threat for 2020-2021” [13]. The U.S. government reacted to high profile attacks against U.S. industries by declaring ransomware a national security threat\nand announcing a “coordinated campaign to counter ransomware” [21]. Other governments, including the United\n\n\nKingdom [37], Australia [22], Canada [12], and law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI [38] and Europol [11],\nhave also launched similar programs to defend against\nransomware and offer help to victims.\nTo the criminal actors behind these attacks, the resulting disruption is just ‘collateral damage’. A handful of\ngroups and individuals, with names such as NetWalker,\nConti, REvil and DarkSide, have received tens of millions\nin USD as ransom. But this is just the top of the food\nchain in an ecosystem with many grey areas, especially\nwhen it comes to laundering illicit proceedings. In this\narticle, we will provide a closer look at the ecosystem\nbehind many of the attacks plaguing businesses and\nsocieties, known as Ransomware as a Service (RaaS).\nCryptocurrencies remain the payment method of choice\nfor criminal ransomware actors. While many cryptocurrencies exist, Bitcoin is preferred due to its network\neffects, resulting in wide exchange options. Bitcoin’s\nsound monetary features as a medium of exchange, unit\nof account and store of value make it as attractive to\ncriminals as it is to regular citizens. According to the\nU.S. Department of Treasury, based on data from the\nfirst half of 2021, the “vast majority” of reported ransomware payments were made in Bitcoin [28]. Law enforcement agencies have started to disrupt ransomware\nactors by obtaining personal information of users from\nBitcoin exchange platforms. This is realized through\nanti-money laundering regulations such as Know Your\nCustomer (KYC), which require legal identity verification during registration with the service. While cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are enablers of ransomware,\nblockchain technology also offers unprecedented opportunities for forensic analysis and intelligence gathering.\nUsing our crowdsourced ransomware payment tracker,\n```\nRansomwhere, we compile a dataset of 7,321 Bitcoin\n\n```\naddresses which received ransom payments, based on\nwhich we shed light on the structure and state of the\nransomware ecosystem.\nOur contributions are as follows:\n_∙_ We collect and analyze the largest public dataset of\nransomware activity to date, which includes 13,497\nransom payments to 87 criminal actors over the last\nfive years, worth more than 101 million USD.\n\n\n-----\n\n_∙_ We characterize the evolving ransomware ecosystem.\nOur analysis shows that there are two parallel ransomware markets: commodity and RaaS. After 2019,\nwe observe the rapid rise of RaaS, which achieves\nhigher revenue per address and transaction, and higher\noverall revenue.\n_∙_ We also characterize ransom laundering strategies by\ncommodity ransomware and RaaS actors. Our analysis\nof more than 13k transfers shows striking differences\nin laundering time, utilization of exchanges and other\nmeans to cash out ransom payments.\n_∙_ We discuss the difficulties defending against professionally operated RaaS and we propose possible ways to\ntrace back RaaS activity in cryptocurrency systems.\n_∙_ To enable future research in this area, we make our\ntracker, Ransomwhere, and the tracked ransomware\npayments of our analysis publicly available at [6].\n\n#### 2 THE RANSOMWARE ECOSYSTEM\nThe ransomware ecosystem and its payment traffic can\nbe largely recognized in two categories: commodity ransomware and ransomware as a service (RaaS).\n\n#### 2.1 Commodity Ransomware\nIn the early years of ransomware, the majority of ransomware that spread can be characterized as ‘commodity’\nransomware. Commodity ransomware is characterized\nby widespread targeting, fixed ransom demands, and\ntechnically-adept operators. It usually targets a single\ndevice [17]. Actors behind commodity ransomware are\nusually technically savvy, as most of the time it is developed and spread by the same person. Commodity ransomware operators take advantage of preexisting work,\noften copying and modifying leaked or shared source\ncode, causing the formation of ransomware families. Historically, most commodity ransomware campaigns utilized phishing emails as the primary delivery vector and\nexploited vulnerabilities in common word processing and\nspreadsheet software, if not directly via malicious executables. The modus operandi was mass exploitation,\nrather than targeting specific victims.\nExemplary are WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware\nfamilies, which over a course of only two months impacted tens of thousands of organizations in over 150\ncountries by exploiting a vulnerability allegedly stolen\nfrom the NSA [15]. In today’s standards, both families\nwere poorly coded and their payment systems weren’t\nready for business, although allegedly on purpose for\nNotPetya [14].\nWith regards to its mitigation, the conventional advice\nis to have a proper backup and contingency plan. The\n\n\ninitial philosophy was that a quick ability to restore\nwould make it unnecessary to pay, impairing the financial\nincentive of ransomware operators. But it turned out\nthat what we now regard a commodity was just a proving\nground for a higher-impact utilization of ransomware.\n\n#### 2.2 Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)\n\nWhile the first reports of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)\nemerged in 2016, it wasn’t until 2019 that RaaS became\nwidespread, rapidly capturing a large share of the ransomware market. We define RaaS as ransomware created\nby a core team of developers who license their malware\non an affiliate basis. They often provide a payment portal\n(typically over Tor, an anonymous web protocol), allowing negotiation with victims and dynamic generation of\npayment addresses (typically Bitcoin). RaaS frequently\nemploys a double extortion scheme, not only encrypting\nvictims’ data, but also threatening to leak their data\npublicly.\nThe rise of RaaS has enabled existing criminal groups\nto shift to a new lucrative business model where lowerskilled affiliates can access exploits and techniques previously reserved for highly-skilled criminals. This was\nexemplified by a leaked playbook from the RaaS group\nConti, which enables novice actors to compromise enterprise networks [34]. RaaS affiliates can differ markedly in\ntheir approaches. Some scan the entire internet and compromise any victims they can. Once they have identified\nthe victim, they engage in price discrimination based on\nthe victim company’s size. Affiliates may even use financial documents obtained in the attack to justify higher\nprices [19]. Another strategy, known as big game hunting,\ntargets big corporations that can afford paying a high\nransom. Darkside is one of most notable RaaS families\nwhose affiliates practice big game hunting, including the\nnotable Colonial Pipeline attack in 2021 [18].\nRaaS families often rely on spear-phishing over the\nmass phishing mails utilized by commodity ransomware\ngroups. They also exploit recently disclosed vulnerabilities, leaving remote and virtual desktop services vulnerable [9]. RaaS has lowered the barrier to entry into\ncyber-criminality, as it has removed the initial expenditure to develop effective ransomware. As a result, attacks\ncan be performed with near zero cost. Combined with\nhigh ransom demands, this has led to a low-risk, high\nreward criminal scheme.\nRaaS has effectively weaponized the unpatched internetfacing technology of many unwitting organizations. Such\norganizations have significant financial interest to have\nsystems restored and get back to business after a ransomware attack. Cryptocurrencies enable ransomware\n\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: General course of a ransom payment and its\nlaundering.\n\nactors to directly monetize these vulnerabilities at a\nscale never seen before. In this paper, we regard the\nfunctioning of ransomware actors through what usually\nis the last mile of the attack.\nFigure 1 shows the general course of events after a\nransomware infection, when the victim decides to pay\nthe attacker (step 1 ). In the case of commodity ransomware families, the ransom demand price is fixed and\nnegotiation with the attacker isn’t necessary. With RaaS,\nattackers usually run chat-based services to interact with\nvictims and negotiate the final ransom amount (step 2 ).\nAfter this, a victim will usually exchange fiat legal tender for cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin at an exchange\nplatform (step 3 ) and then send it to the attacker’s\nwallet (step 4 ). The attacker will then usually route\nthe obtained Bitcoin through various services (step 5 )\nin order to obfuscate ownership and reduce the risk of\ndeanonymization before cashing out (step 6 ).\n\n#### 3 METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we describe how we collected data of\nransom payments and ransomware actors in our study.\n\n#### 3.1 Addresses involved in Ransom Payments\n\nWe obtain ransomware Bitcoin addresses from our crowdsourced payment tracker Ransomwhere. The Ransomwhere\ndataset contains Bitcoin addresses and associated families collected from open-source datasets and publiclysubmitted crowd-sourced reports. In total, the Ransomwhere dataset contains 7,457 Bitcoin addresses and\ntheir corresponding ransomware families.\n\n\nTo seed the dataset, we collected data from several\npublic sources. We imported addresses from PaquetClouston et al. [30], who collected 7,222 addresses and\nlabeled families representing approximately $12.7 million\nin payments. This dataset provides us with, among other\nransomware families, 7,014 addresses belonging to Locky.\nWe further collected 37 addresses and associated families\nfrom the AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange, an\nopen threat intelligence sharing platform [1].\nMembers of the public may submit reports at our\ncrowdsourced payment tracker Ransomwhere [6]. We received 99 reports containing 198 addresses over a 6month period from June 2021 to December 2021. While\nthis is a lower number of addresses, they represent the\nmajority of ransomware payment value in our dataset. In\norder to verify reports, the reporter must include the relevant Bitcoin addresses and the associated ransomware\nfamily. In addition, they have to provide evidence of\nthe ransom demand, such as a screenshot of the ransom\npayment portal or a ransom message on an infected computer. Some addresses were involved in more than one\nreport. All reports were manually reviewed before being\nadded to the dataset. We did not accept reports that\nwere inaccurate or were not related to ransomware (e.g.,\naddresses involved in extortion scam emails).\nAll reported ransom addresses were Bitcoin addresses.\nDue to the transparent nature of Bitcoin it is possible\nto verify that the collected addresses indeed received\npayments. Using our own Bitcoin full node, we scraped\nall transactions for the addresses in our dataset. Overall,\n7,323 out of 7,454 Bitcoin addresses were involved in at\nleast one ransom payment. We discarded 134 addresses\nthat did not receive any payment. We have queried Tor\nusing a solution from a peer researcher [33] for all Bitcoin\naddresses in our dataset to rule out the chance of an\naddress being used for cybercrime purposes other than\nransomware. Based on this, we excluded 2 addresses\nbelonging to a cache of Bitcoin seized by the U.S. Department of Justice after the closing of the SilkRoad\ndarkweb market [23]. After these steps, the final number\nof addresses considered for our analysis is 7,321. For a\nsummary of our dataset we refer to Table 1.\n\n#### 3.2 Ransom Payments and Laundering\nThe transparency of Bitcoin also allows us to collect\ninformation about (ransom) payments, i.e., the amount\nof Bitcoin received. For each address we collected the\nnumber of incoming (payments) and outgoing (transfers)\ntransactions, their value in Bitcoin, and their timestamp.\nWe calculated the USD value of each transaction using\n\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1: Ransomware Dataset Statistics\n\nData Commodity RaaS Total\nUnique Actors 71 16 87\nBitcoin Addresses 161 7,160 7,321\nReceived Transactions 4,799 8,698 13,497\n(Payments)\nTransferred Transactions 4,557 8,540 13,097\n(Laundering)\n\nthe BTC-USD daily closing rate on the day of the transaction. This serves as an approximate ransom payment\nand not the exact amount in USD the criminal actors\nrequested or later profited. The total ransom paid to\naddresses in our dataset is $101,297,569. The lowest payment received is $1, and the highest is $11,042,163. The\nmedian payment value is $1,176.\nIn collaboration with Crystal Blockchain [5], we tracked\nthe destination of outgoing transactions, i.e., transfers.\nIn order to estimate addresses’ potential for illicit use,\nCrystal Blockchain utilizes clustering heuristics such as\none-time change address and common-input-ownership\n\n[40], as well as human collection of off-chain data from\nvarious cryptocurrency services. In addition to this, Crystal Blockchain scrapes online forums and other Internet services for Bitcoin addresses and their associated\nreal-world entity. Based on this, it is possible to track\npayments several hops from the original deposit address.\nTo have the most reliable view, in our analysis we have\nonly regarded the direct destination of ransom payments\n(first hop). Based on the characterization of the involved\naddresses across the path, we are able to study the laundering strategies of ransomware groups as well as the\ntime needed to wash out the money (see Section 5).\n\n#### 3.3 Ransomware Actors\n\nWe obtained addresses and labeled families as described\nin Section 3.1. We categorized each ransomware family as used by either commodity ransomware or RaaS\nactors. Ransomware is generally categorized as RaaS\ndue to the use of an affiliate structure, with the ransomware developer (operator) selling the ransomware to\ncriminal actors either based on a commission for each\nransom paid, or a flat monthly fee (as a service, like\nmany subscription-based services). As there does not\nexist any comprehensive public list of RaaS groups, we\nhave labeled a family as RaaS if a reliable industry or law\nenforcement source claims that a given ransomware is\nsold as a service. A list of commodity and RaaS families\nin our dataset is presented in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2: Ransomware criminal actors in our Dataset\n\nName #Addrs.

RaaS actors are highlighted.\n\n#### 3.4 Limitations\nOur dataset of Bitcoin addresses is the largest public\ncollection of ransomware payment addresses collected to\ndate, based on total USD value. While this allows for a\nunique view on the ransomware financial ecosystem, it\nis not exhaustive. An inherent limitation of any research\nusing adversary artifacts is its dependence on the availability of artifacts that bad actors have an interest to\nhide. Furthermore victims might have an interest not to\nreport addresses, as they prefer keeping attacks undisclosed. We note that certain families, such as NetWalker,\nmay be overrepresented in our dataset due to us having\nmore complete data on these families. Despite this limitation, we believe that our dataset provides a valuable,\nif incomplete, representation of ransomware payments\nover many years. This broad view provides a better reflection of the state of affairs than simply focusing on\na few families. We hope that this can lay the groundwork for further public data collection in the future, and\nencourage anyone to submit data at Ransomwhere [6].\n\n#### 4 RANSOM PAYMENT ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section, we analyze 13,497 payments to the Bitcoin\naddresses owned by ransomware actors in our dataset\n(see Table 1). A payment is a transaction received by\nan address in our dataset. Table 2 lists the ransomware\nfamilies used by the actors in our dataset. Our dataset\ncontains Bitcoin addresses associated with 87 commodity ransomware or RaaS actors. For reasons of brevity,\nfamilies for which our dataset contains just 1 address are\nexcluded from Table 2. The 16 actors that are classified\nas RaaS, highlighted in Table 2, account for 7,160 out of\n7,321 addresses in our dataset. As mentioned previously,\nfor full review our dataset is publicly available [6].\n\n|Name #Addrs.|Name (contd.) #Addrs.|\n|---|---|\n|Locky 7037 NetWalker 66 SamSam 48 Ryuk 40 Conti 27 Qlocker 22 JigSaw 11 CryptConsole 10 Egregor 9 DMALocker v3 9 Globe v3 7 REvil 7 CryptoTorLocker2015 7 HC6/HC7 6 Globe 5 WannaCry 5 TeslaCrypt 5 CTB-Locker 5 Xorist 4|DarkSide 3 MedusaLocker 3 NotPetya 3 GlobeImposter 3 ThunderCrypt 3 Nemucod 3 LockBit 2.0 2 Globe v2 2 EDA2 2 Flyper 2 Black Kingdom 2 CryptoLocker 2 AvosLocker 2 NoobCrypt 2 VenusLocker 2 XLocker v5 2 Chimera 2 Badblock 2 Other Groups/Families* 50|\n\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n14.0M\n\n12.0M\n\n10.0M\n\n8.0M\n\n6.0M\n\n4.0M\n\n2.0M\n\n0.0M\n\n69000\n\n46000\n\n23000\n\n|Commodity Ransomware|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Ransomware­as­a­Service Total Revenue (Commodity+RaaS)||||\n|||||\n|||||\n|||||\n|||||\n|||||\n\n\nFigure 2: Revenue per ransomware actor.\n\nRansomware victims typically create an account with\na reputable exchange platform to buy Bitcoin with fiat\ncurrency. Then, victims perform a transaction (payment)\nto the address provided by the ransomware actor. In our\ndataset, payment transactions to ransomware addresses\ntend to originate one to two hops away from reputable\nexchange platforms, such as Coinbase and Kraken.\n\n\nYear\n\n\n#### 4.1 Ransomware Revenue\n\nIn Figure 2 we list 15 ransomware families with the highest revenue. The top-grossing families are dominated\nby RaaS: NetWalker has the highest revenue, $26.7 million, followed by Conti ($16.4 million), REvil/Sodinokibi\n($12.1 million), DarkSide ($9.1 million) and Locky ($8.1\nmillion). All commodity actors combined account for a\ntotal revenue of $5.5 million. Although the number of\nRaaS actors is lower, they together earned $95.7 million.\nFigure 3 shows the accumulated revenue of both commodity ransomware and RaaS actors. It shows that, from\n2015 until 2019, early RaaS actors, primarily Locky, were\ngaining significant but still relatively low revenues. Commodity actors were also active, but with even lower revenues. As seen in Figure 3, RaaS revenue reached $8.2\nmillion in April 2020. This can be primarily attributed to\nNetWalker, which actively targeted hospitals and health\ncare institutions during the first COVID-19 lockdown in\nthat period [24]. Other revenue peaks caused by RaaS\ngroups are in May and June of 2021, with peaks of $13.5\nmillion and $12.8 million respectively. These spikes are\ncaused by large ransom payments by individual victims.\nOne example of this is a payment to REvil/Sodinokibi\non June 1st, 2021, accounting for $11 million. This is\na payment by the Brazilian meat processing company\nJBS, which dominated headlines at the time [16].\nLocky has a notorious reputation as one of the biggest\nransomware strains in 2016-2017. It’s also one of the\nearliest, if not the first, RaaS family. What stands out\napart from its high revenue is its address usage. The\nactors behind Locky issued addresses to each new victim,\n\n\nFigure 3: USD revenue for commodity and RaaS.\n\na novelty at the time. This is evident in our analysis, with\nmany addresses with only 2 or 3 incoming transactions.\nAccording to French court documents, Locky’s developer\nis the same individual who owned BTC-e, a fraudulent\nexchange [7]. Hence, the actor was able to set up a new\naddress for each payment without raising compliance\nalarms. Locky is an early, less sophisticated example of\na RaaS operation which would serve as an example to\nmany cybercriminal actors to follow.\n\n\n#### 4.2 Ransomware Payment Characteristics\nRaaS actors are not only more effective in terms of\nprofits, but also in handling payments. They typically\nhave higher revenue per address, while also generating\nunique addresses for victims. In Figure 4 we show the\ncumulative distribution of received payments between\ncommodity and RaaS actors. Commodity ransomware\nactors typically use single wallet addresses to receive\nhundreds of ransom payments. The highest amount of\npayments to a single address is 697 to AES-NI, followed\nby 496 to SynAck and 441 to File-Locker. While these\nare outliers, Figure 4 shows that using a single address\nto receive upwards of 100 payments is not unusual.\nIn contrast, RaaS actors almost exclusively use a new\nwallet address to receive each payment, as observed in\nFigure 4 (right). An outlier is an address associated\nwith NetWalker which has received 138 payments. This\naddress is likely an intermediate payment address, combining payments from many victims, discovered during\nMcAfee Labs’ investigation into NetWalker [35].\nThe distribution of unique addresses per commodity\nransomware and RaaS actor is presented in Figure 5.\nIn stark contrast to the revenue from ransom activities,\npresented in Figure 3, the number of addresses used in\nrecent years are low, on the order of tens per month. We\nsuspect that RaaS actors prefer to create new addresses\nfor each new ransom payment in order to ensure their\n\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nNetWalker (Mailto)\n\n0 200 400 600\nReceived Payments\n\n\nType = RaaS\n\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n\nthese groups have a specific interest in operational security, as transactions usually aren’t supported by exchange\nplatforms. Another address format is Pay-to-WitnessPublic-Key-Hash (P2WPKH), or Segregated Witness\n(SegWit) protocols, with prefix bc1q. 72 addresses in our\ndataset, belonging to Conti, Netwalker, SunCrypt, DarkSide and HelloKitty. These are RaaS actors and could\nimply that they deliberately use SegWit for additional\nsecurity instead of a traditional address format.\n\n#### 5 MONEY LAUNDERING ANALYSIS\n\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\nType = commodity\n\n0 200 400 600\nReceived Payments\n\n|Col1|Col2|File-Locker SynAck|AES-NI|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|NetWalker (Mailto) MedusaLocker|\n|---|---|\n\n\nFigure 4: ECDF of payments per address for commodity\nransomware and RaaS actors.\n\n\n2600 Commodity Ransomware Addresses\nRansomware-as-a-Service Addresses\n\n2400\n\n800\n\n600\n\n30\n\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\nFigure 5: Number of unique payment addresses for commodity ransomware and RaaS.\n\npseudo-anonymity, and thus make legal investigations\nand takedowns more difficult.\nMoreover, our analysis shows that RaaS groups apply\nbetter operational security practices when using native\nBitcoin functionality for wallets (payment addresses).\nBitcoin uses Bitcoin Script to handle transactions between addresses. The script type used defines the wallet\ntype. Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses have\nthe prefix 1. This is Bitcoin’s legacy address format and\nthe most common address format in our dataset with\n7,339 addresses. 46 addresses in our dataset are Pay-toScript-Hash (P2SH) formatted, recognized by the prefix\n_3. To spend received payments in Bitcoin, the recipient_\nmust specify a redeem script matching the hash. The\nscript can contain functionalities to increase security,\nsuch as time-locks or requiring co-signatures. We only\nobserve this for select actors in our dataset: Qlocker, Netwalker, REvil, Ryuk and Phobos. This could mean that\n\n\nIn the previous section, we investigated ransom payments\nby victims to ransomware actors. In the next section, we\ninvestigate 13,097 laundering transactions in our dataset\n(see Table 1) to shed light on how these actors liquidate\ntheir illicit earnings.\n\n#### 5.1 Laundering Strategies\nTo avoid exposing their identity, ransomware actors\nwill usually launder their revenue. After routing funds\nthrough one or more services to obfuscate the money trail,\nit is cashed out as legal tender or monetized through the\npurchase of voucher codes or physical goods. In Figure 6\nwe show the number of transfer transactions per address.\nThe number of transfer (outgoing) transactions provides\ninsights on how actors prefer to initialize their laundering. In short, we see that RaaS actors mostly prefer to\nempty the deposit address in one transaction, whereas\ncommodity actors prefer multiple smaller transactions,\nup to hundreds, in some cases more. Hence commodity\nransomware actors are less sophisticated. For example,\nthree commodity ransomware actors with the most payments per address (File-Locker, SynAck, AES-NI) also\nhave the most outgoing transactions. While the motivation for this behavior remains unclear, given that law\nenforcement scrutiny was relatively low, it is likely that\nthe commodity actors took advantage of the ability to\ncash out more frequently with little risk. This is further\nsupported by their choice of laundering entities.\nAlmost all ransomware actors in our dataset launder\ntheir proceedings entirely. The speed with which this\nhappens can be inferred from the time between the first\nincoming payment to and the last outgoing transaction\nfrom the deposit address. We define this time duration in\nwhich ransomware actors start laundering after having\nreceived the payment as collect-to-laundry time. Note\nthat this is not the total duration for caching the ransom,\nbut rather the time spent between start receiving the\nransom payment and transferring the payment received.\nFigure 7 shows the ECDF of the collect-to-laundry time\n(in days) for the commodity ransomware and the RaaS\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||\n||||Commodity Ransomware Addresses Ransomware-as-a-Service Addresses|||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|2015 2016|2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Year|||||\n\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3: Laundering Entities Overview\n\nEntity Description Evidence\nATM / Payment Provider Payment gateways for physical/online merchants or ATMs, usually used to launder small amounts [27]\nDark Market / Illegal Services Illegal services available on Tor or other Internet services, used to buy illegal server hosting etc. [10]\nFraudulent Exchange Exchange platforms officially sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [7]\nGambling Online casinos and gambling platforms, used to launder small amounts anonymously [36]\nLow/Moderate ML-Risk Exchange Exchanges with strict AML/KYC policies might still be used for laundering criminal funds [32]\nMixers These services take and ‘mix’ Bitcoin from various parties to obfuscate ownership [26]\n(Very) High ML-Risk Exchange Exchanges with lax or no AML/KYC implementations are popular for money laundering [31]\nWallet Service Custodial/online wallets, some might have also have privacy features such as mixers.

RaaS actors have a significantly\nlower collect-to-laundry time compared to commodity\nactors. Typically, payments to RaaS actors are transferred away from the deposit address in the first minutes\nto hours after payment. The few outliers in RaaS are\ncaused by NetWalker and individual addresses associated\nwith actors for which we have multiple addresses in our\n\n\ndataset (Ryuk, Conti). As the illicit funds received by\nRaaS are washed out quickly and, typically, in full, this\nsuggests that it is more difficult to track payments to\nRaaS and lowering the odds of recovery.\nOnly a small set of families still have significant portions of their proceedings on the original address. This\nis the case for NetWalker, which has 20.36% still on an\naddress, MedusaLocker (7.98%) and WannaCry (7.92%).\nIn this case, it is likely that the actor has lost the private\nkey or is incapable to safely launder the ransom, for\nexample due to law enforcement scrutiny. It is known\nthat NetWalker’s proceedings have been seized by law enforcement [24], with WannaCry under heavy monitoring\nand most of the laundering failed [2].\n\n#### 5.2 Challenges in Fighting Laundering\nContrary to popular belief, Bitcoin isn’t anonymous\nbut pseudo-anonymous. Forensic analysis might link a\nBitcoin address to a real-world identity, especially when\nan exchange platform is used to convert between fiat\ncurrency and Bitcoin. In most jurisdictions, legal entities\nbehind such platforms are held to Know Your Customer\n(KYC) legislation, which requires them to verify the\nidentity of every user signing up on their service. During\nan investigation, when known illicit Bitcoin is routed\nthrough an exchange that requires KYC, authorities have\na chance to identify the culprit. Several industry players\nsupport law enforcement in such AML investigations,\nwith technology based on clustering algorithms which\ncan link addresses to a service such as an exchange\nplatform. As seen in Figure 8, we have grouped the data\nwe obtained through Crystal Blockchain in a select set\nof entities, which are explained in Table 3.\nLaundering can involve routing illicit funds through\nseveral hops before cashing out. As it is difficult to know\nwhere actual ownership has terminated after several hops,\nin this analysis we only regard the first hop, i.e., the first\ntransfer transaction. This is the service to which actors\ntransfer funds directly after having obtained them at the\ndeposit address shared with the victim. As this has the\nclosest link to the payment address, this is the first point\nof investigation for law enforcement. An actor choosing\n\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Pie chart of one-hop laundering entities.\n\nto use a service implies that they trust the service, at\nleast enough not to disclose their identity.\nFigure 8 shows the proportion of estimated USD value\nof Bitcoin directly transferred (first hop) to the entities\nexplained in Table 3 for commodity and RaaS actors.\nDue to limitations in reliably establishing (legal) entities\nbehind an address, the direct transactions in our dataset\naccount for a subset of the total revenue generated by the\nactors in our dataset. Hence we report using percentages,\na best practice used with comparable datasets [39].\nOur core observation is that commodity actors don’t\nexhibit a specific laundering strategy, while RaaS actors\nprimarily use fraudulent exchanges and mixers. Mixers\nare services which take in Bitcoin from cybercriminals or\nsimply privacy-aware users and combine these in many\ntransactions. Through this the accurate tracking of Bitcoin is hindered, as every client gets their initial deposit\n(minus service fee) back as a mix from other users’ Bitcoin. Thus, it is more difficult to trace the laundering\nactivity of RaaS criminal actors.\nWhen considering fraudulent exchanges together with\nlow- and high-risk exchanges, commodity authors seem\nto prefer exchanges, and thus perhaps cash-out to fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. It is however also known\n\n\nthat cybercriminals have wound down the use of fraudulent exchanges [29]. In a sense, commodity actors do\nnot partake in any systematic laundering at all, whereas\nRaaS actors use fraudulent (non-KYC) exchanges and\nmixers, a clear laundering strategy. Based on this, we\nhypothesize that the chances of recovering payments\nthrough law enforcement intervention are higher with\ncommodity ransomware than with RaaS. The services\nof their choice logically leave more user traces (IP address, login session) than mixer services and fraudulent\nexchanges designed to obfuscate ownership.\nWhen an actor’s collect-to-laundry time is high, a law\nenforcement investigation may be able to successfully\nrecover the funds. However, in many such cases there\nis less incentive to intercept transactions due to the\ncomparatively low ransom amounts. The speed with\nwhich RaaS groups transfer funds out suggests criminal\nsophistication, which is also reflected in their preferred\nmeans of laundering. Given this, it is difficult to intercept\nfunds unless law enforcement is already involved at the\nvery moment the payment is made [25].\n\n#### 6 CONCLUSION\nRansomware is a severe, growing threat plaguing our\nworld. In this paper, we take a data-driven and “follow\nthe money” approach to characterize the structure and\nevolution of the ransomware ecosystem. To this end, we\nreport on our experience in operating Ransomwhere, our\nopen crowdsourced ransomware payment tracker to collect information from victims of ransomware attacks. By\nanalyzing a corpus of more than 13.5k ransom payments\nwith a total revenue of more than $101 million, we shed\nlight on the practices of these criminal actors over the\nlast years. Our analysis unveils that there are two symbiotic, parallel markets. Commodity ransomware actors,\nand (dominant since 2019) Ransomware as a Service\n(RaaS) actors. The first is operated by individuals or a\nsmall group of programmers, the second by professional\ncriminals who offer it on an affiliate basis to typically\nless technical criminal actors. Due to differences in victimization, the first has low ransom amounts, the latter\nhigher ransom amounts depending on the victim profile.\nOur analysis of ransom payments (all in Bitcoin) shows\nthat RaaS actors have adopted more sophisticated cryptographic techniques, compared to commodity actors,\nin their operation and typically generate one address\nper victim to hide their identity. This allows RaaS to\ngenerate more revenue and with higher level of protection, attracting more criminal groups to use RaaS to\nperform high profile attacks in recent years. RaaS actors are also more efficient to launder ransom payments,\n\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nas they move to launder funds within hours or days.\nRaaS actors also transfer revenue from ransom payments\nto mixers and other sophisticated laundry entities that\nmake difficult for law enforcement agencies to recover\nransom payments.\n\n#### REFERENCES\n\n[1] 2021.
