Read More...](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/author/karlo-zanki)\n\n\n-----\n\nReversingLabs is analyzing a supply chain compromise of the firm 3CX Ltd., a maker of\nenterprise voice over IP (VOIP) solutions. Beginning on March 22nd, 2023, compromised\nversions of the 3CXDesktopApp, a desktop client version of the company’s VoIP software,\nwere found to contain malicious code.\n\nWhile more time and effort will be needed to fully reconstruct and study this incident, our\nanalysis of the malicious files used in the attack points strongly to a compromise of 3CX’s\nsoftware build pipeline, resulting in modifications that inserted malicious code to the\n3CXDesktopApp software package.\n\nThere are many possible explanations for how such a thing could happen. However, our\nanalysts focused on investigating the two most likely scenarios: a compromise of the 3CX\ndevelopment pipeline that resulted in malicious code being added during the build, or the\npossibility of a malicious dependency being served by a package repository. The former is\n[represented by the SolarWinds incident while the latter theory is closer to the supply chain](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth)\n[attacks commonly found in open source repositories like npm and](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/iconburst-npm-software-supply-chain-attack-grabs-data-from-apps-websites) [PyPI.](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/beware-impostor-http-libraries-lurk-on-pypi)\n\nReversingLabs analysis shows that attackers appended RC4 encrypted shellcode into the\nsignature appendix of d3dcompiler.dll, a standard library used with OpenJS Electron\napplications such as 3CXDesktopApp. Another standard Electron application module, ffmpeg\nwas modified with code to extract and run the malicious content from the d3dcompiler file.\n\nEvidence of those changes are clearly visible when comparing images of “clean” versions of\nthe 3CXDesktopApp with subsequent, tampered versions. The ReversingLabs Software\nSupply Chain Security platform identified signatures in the appended code pointing to\n[SigFlip, a tool for modifying the authenticode-signed Portable Executable (PE) files without](https://github.com/med0x2e/SigFlip)\n\n\n-----\n\nbreaking the existing signature. Subsequently, our threat research platform linked malicious\ncode added to ffmpeg library to code found in SigLoader, another malicious tool used by an\nadvanced persistent threat group in multiple campaigns.\n\n[As was the case with the compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion software, the manner in which](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth)\nthe malicious code was added to the 3CXDesktopApp is of little value to 3CX customers who\ndownloaded malicious code onto internal systems. However, it should be of intense interest\nto organizations engaged in software development, as it points to the need for increased\nscrutiny of compiled software images to detect malicious code, unexplained modifications or\nother discrepancies that may be a critical, early indicator of a supply chain compromise.\n\nSEE RELATED:\n\n[Analysis: The 3CX attack was targeted — but the plan was broader](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/3cx-supply-chain-attack-targeted)\nWebinar: [Deconstructing the 3CX Software Supply Chain Attack](https://www.reversinglabs.com/webinar/deconstructing-3cx-red-flags-misses-and-failures-to-address-the-software-supply-chain-threat)\nDeminar: [Analyzing the 3CX Software Package](https://www.reversinglabs.com/software-package-deconstruction-series/3cx)\n\n## Introduction\n\n3CX is a VoIP IPBX software development company. The 3CX Phone System is used by\nmore than 600,000 companies worldwide and counts more than 12 million daily users,\nincluding firms in the automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, aviation and other industries.\n\nBeginning around March 22, 2023 customers of voice over IP (VoIP) vendor 3CX started\n[peppering the company’s support groups with complaints about an update to the company’s](https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/threat-alerts-from-sentinelone-for-desktop-update-initiated-from-desktop-client.119806/#post-557997)\n3CXDesktopApp client running afoul of endpoint detection and response products, which\nwere flagging the update as malicious.\n\nThe troubles with the 3CXDesktopApp simmered quietly for days, with customers wondering\nabout “false positives,” until, on Wednesday, reports from a string of endpoint security firms\n[including CrowdStrike and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-detects-and-prevents-active-intrusion-campaign-targeting-3cxdesktopapp-customers/) [SentinelOne confirmed what many suspected: that the warnings](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/smoothoperator-ongoing-campaign-trojanizes-3cx-software-in-software-supply-chain-attack/)\nfrom endpoint protection software were not in error, and that the 3CXDesktopApp had been\ncompromised. By Thursday morning, 3CX’s CEO, Nick Galea, made it [official.](https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/3cx-desktopapp-security-alert.119951/)\n\n“As many of you have noticed the 3CX DesktopApp has a malware (sp) in it,” Galea wrote in\na post to a 3CX support page. “It affects the Windows Electron client for customers running\nupdate 7. It was reported to us yesterday night and we are working on an update to the\nDesktopApp which we will release in the coming hours.” Galea advised uninstalling the\nmalicious app and promised more information on the incident.\n\nFor customers affected by the incident, the 3CX compromise is serious. CrowdStrike and\nothers have attributed the incident to a threat actor dubbed “LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA,”\nbelieved to be associated with the government of North Korea and known for targeting\n\n\n-----\n\nmilitary and political entities. Many of the customers that downloaded the malicious update\n[did not see malicious code activated in their environment. However, Crowdstrike wrote that it](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/)\nhas observed malicious activity including hands-on-keyboard actions in a number of\n3CXDesktopApp customer environments.\n\nMuch will be written about the “what” and the “who” of the attack (what APT group is\nresponsible). We would like to focus on the “how.” That is, how was it that malicious actors\nplaced information stealing code within a signed 3CXDesktopApp software update?\n\nOur analysis of the malicious update points either to a compromise of the 3CX development\npipeline that resulted in malicious code being added during the build, or the possibility of a\nmalicious dependency being served by a package repository. The attack on 3CX — though\nsophisticated — had clear indicators that could have tipped off 3CX to the breach before\ncustomer systems were affected.\n\n## Detecting the 3CX compromise with differential analysis\n\nThe ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) platform analyzes software\npackages prior to release or at any stage during development. As a final step in the build\nprocess, the ReversingLabs platform has unique visibility into the state of a produced\nsoftware artifact. That gives it the ability to detect the multitude of software supply chain\nattack possibilities. Scanning binaries, without the presumption of having the source\navailable, can surface software supply chain compromises within the developer’s source\ncode, their build environment, or the dependencies used to assemble the final software\npackage.\n\nA required capability for detecting supply chain compromises is the ability to track the\n_evolution of software packagesthrough differential analysis of their contents. This includes_\nthe raw metadata properties of each software component in the release, as well as their\nrespective behaviors. Odd or inexplicable changes between builds should be considered a\ncause to investigate a possible compromise. This becomes even more important when\nsoftware packages include components that are pre-compiled at offsite locations and,\ntherefore, not subject to review prior to deployment.\n\n_A required capability for detecting supply chain compromises is the ability to track the_\n_evolution of software packages through differential analysis of their contents._\n\n## Changes introduced in 18.12 had red flags\n\nIn the case of the 3CXDesktopApp: 3CX distributed macOS DMG and MSI installer\npackages containing the compromised update. ReversingLabs has also identified a NuGet\npackage containing the version 18.12.416 of the 3CXDesktopApp among the compromised\nartifacts we analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we look at the MSI packages distributed by 3CX through our solution, and make a diff\nbetween v18.11.1213 (the last known good version) and v18.12.407 (the first known\ncompromised version), a number of red flags pop up that are cause for a deeper\ninvestigation.\n\nFor example: ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security policy SQ20116 detects that a\nMicrosoft digitally signed-binary has been modified post-signing without breaking the\nsignature integrity. This is not something that would normally happen during the build\nprocess and it is not something that could happen inadvertently. Developers would have had\nto make a conscious choice to implement a change like this, and that would never happen\nfor a software component they own.\n\nHowever, doing so is a great technique for ferrying malicious code onto a system under the\ncover of a digitally signed (and therefore “legitimate”) binary. Freely available, off the shelf\ntools like [SigFlip and SigLoader help facilitate these kinds of operations. For that reason, the](https://github.com/med0x2e/SigFlip)\nReversingLabs supply chain security solution makes the following recommendation when it\nencounters a digitally signed binary that has been modified post-signing:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Investigate: Take a closer look at these kinds of files, because malware commonly tries to go_\n_unnoticed by hiding within these validation gaps._\n\nThis warning popped up in our analysis of 3CXDesktopApp in association with d3dcompiler,\na standard library used with OpenJS Electron applications such as 3CXDesktopApp. Adding\nto the alarm in our analysis of the 3CXDesktopApp was the behavior of another standard\nElectron file, ffmpeg, which we saw referencing the d3dcompiler, the tampered file.\n\nOther indicators of malicious intent were hard to come by as the malware hides itself as a\nstatically linked function with ffmpeg library. But even without observing the malware execute,\nthere’s enough suspicious goings-on just in the diff between the two 3CXDesktopApp\nupdates to warrant a deeper investigation.\n\n## Digging into the suspicious changes\n\nThe choice of these two DLLs -- ffmpeg and d3dcompiler_47 - by the threat actors behind\nthis attack was no accident. The target in question, 3CXDesktopApp is built on the Electron\nopen source framework. Both of the libraries in question usually ship with the Electron\nruntime and, therefore, are unlikely to raise suspicion within customer environments.\nAdditionally, d3dcompiler_47, the tampered-with file, is signed with a certificate issued to\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Corporation and Windows digital signature details report no issues related to the\nsignature. For endpoint protection applications, a signed binary using a legitimate certificate\nfrom a reputable firm like Microsoft is likely to get the “green light\".\n\nFigure 1: Windows digital signature details for d3dcompiler_47\n\nThe “smoking gun,” in this case, was a combination of RC4 encrypted shellcode into the\nsignature appendix of d3dcompiler and a reference to the d3dcompiler library that was added\nto the ffmpeg library.\n\nThere was no sensible explanation for these changes, as there were no functional changes\nto d3dcompiler_47 to warrant such a change. That pointed in the direction of malicious\nfunctionality being added within the ffmpeg library. And, indeed, detailed analysis shows that\nmalicious code was added to that DLL. It is invoked shortly after the call to its entry point to\nextract the RC4 encrypted malicious content from the signature appendix of d3dcompiler.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we looked more closely, we saw that the beginning of the RC4 encrypted content was\nmarked by a signature: 0xFE 0xED 0xFA 0xCE 0xFE 0xED 0xFA 0xCE. That specific\nsequence of bytes is what we term a “magic signature” — a value that the program seeks\nand interprets in a specific way. In this case, the sequence is known to be associated with\nthe SigLoader tool.\n\nWhen SigLoader encounters this signature, it knows that a malicious shellcode payload\nfollows immediately after the sequence, which it will extract and decrypt. And, indeed, rest of\nthe appended data after that initial signature contains the encrypted shellcode which is\ndecrypted using the RC4 key: 3jB(2bsG#@c7\n\nAppending data to a signed executable and using the specific magic byte signature are\n[strong signs that the loader payloads were created using SigFlip — a tool designed “for](https://github.com/med0x2e/SigFlip)\npatching authenticode signed PE files without invalidating or breaking the existing signature.”\nFinally, the code responsible for loading the encrypted data that was added to the ffmpeg\n[library is identical to code found in the SigLoader tool. This is a known technique used by](https://github.com/med0x2e/SigFlip/blob/main/Native/SigLoader/SigLoader/SigLoader.cpp)\nAPT#10 in multiple campaigns or intrusion sets.\n\nIn this incident, the decrypted payload is a shellcode containing another embedded DLL file\nthat downloads URLs pointing to C2 infrastructure from a Github repository hosting harmless\nicon files. The URLs pointing to C2 infrastructure are encrypted with AES, Base64 encoded\nand appended to the ends of the legitimate icon files.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Showing the similarity of loader code found in ffmpeg (above) and the SigLoader\ntool (below).\n\n## Metadata clues point to 3CX compromise \n\nThe exact circumstances and early stages of the 3CX breach aren’t known. However, our\nexamination of the metadata from the compromised packages provides important insights\ninto the incident and suggest that there were clues that 3CX may have picked up on that\nsomething was amiss with its latest desktop client update.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on data from our threat research platform, we can say with confidence that most\nElectron applications found in the ReversingLabs Cloud have identical PE compilation\ntimestamps for the files in the application. That is because the compile times are\npredetermined and set by the build system, resulting in compilation stamps that are identical.\nThere is simply no other way to explain how so many files would be built in the exact same\nsecond.\n\nIn the case of compromised 3CXDesktopApp Electron applications, however, these\ncompilation timestamps differed. The first timestamp, which is found on the majority of the\nDLLs within the compromised installer package, is 2022-11-30T15:56:23Z. That correlates\nwith the build version of the Electron used by the 3CX development team - Electron v19.1.9.\n\nThe second timestamp we discovered only applied to the ffmpeg file. It was 2022-1112T04:12:14Z and is associated with the build version of the Electron used by malware\nauthors. Furthermore, two of the malicious ffmpeg variants were digitally signed with a\nlegitimate certificate issued to the 3CX company.\n\nWhat can we conclude from this? Based on this information we estimate that the supply\nchain incident was caused by the compromise of the repository from which the Electron\napplication binaries were fetched during the build process.As part of the attack, legitimate\nversions of ffmpeg and d3dcompiler libraries in the compromised repository were likely\nreplaced with malicious versions compiled by the attackers after modifying publicly available\nffmpeg source code.\n\n_[ReversingLabs researchers] estimate that the supply chain incident was caused by_\n_the compromise of the repository from which the Electron application binaries were_\n_fetched during the build process._\n\nUnlike legitimate ffmpeg files, the Program Database (PDB) data is stripped from the\nmalicious files in order to remove any data that could reveal the real build time or link them to\nattackers' development environment.\n\nOnce that substitution happened, the rest of the attack was easy sailing. 3CX’s build process\nwas likely designed to automatically sign the latest available components — third-party or\notherwise — and include them into the software release package. That means the malicious\nffmpeg library, once fetched from the (compromised) repository, was signed without the need\nfor the attackers to steal the digital signing certificates.\n\nThere is no data to indicate whether the compromised repository was deployed locally in\n3CX or if it was hosted elsewhere. Based on public statements from the company, we can\ninfer that the malicious ffmpeg and d3dcompiler were hosted somewhere on GitHub.\nReversingLabs has, so far, been unable to confirm this with the telemetry data we currently\n\n\n-----\n\nhave available to us. From what we have seen, there is no evidence that a malicious\nrepository is, or was, hosted on GitHub. And there is no evidence that other developers may\nbe at risk from using the same malicious code like 3CX did.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs the saying goes, “It is not ‘if’ you will be hacked, but ‘when.’” That’s true even for\nsophisticated operations like software supply chain attacks. Recent history has shown us\nthat malicious actors are growing more and more interested in the access provided by\ndevelopment pipelines, open source and third party code and more. Development\norganizations can’t keep from being targeted. However, there are ways that they can reduce\nthe impact of any malicious campaign against them. Doing that requires them to be attuned\nto the techniques and methods that malicious actors use.\n\nIn the case of the compromise of the VOIP provider 3CX, there is a lot that is still unknown\nabout how the attack was carried out, or who its intended targets were. However,\nReversingLabs analysis of the modifications made to the company’s 3CXDesktopApp\nsuggest that there were telltale signs of tampering with the company’s desktop client\nsoftware prior to its release. Had these signs been noticed during development, it should\nhave triggered a closer analysis of the software release and, possibly, discovery of the\nbreach and malicious code additions.\n\nAs we have shown, evidence of changes to the 3CXDesktopApp are clearly visible in a\ncomparison of “clean” and tampered versions of the client software — changes that point to\nthe use of SigFlip and SigLoader, known suspicious/malicious off the shelf tools that are in\nthe tool belt of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.\n\nAs with the compromise of SolarWinds Orion codebase, this incident underscores the need\nfor development organizations to look beyond the risks posed by software vulnerabilities and\ninsecure code.Threats such as malicious open source modules, tampering with software\ndependencies and attacks on internally developed modules and builds are growing. When\nsuccessful, these attacks not only threaten the security and reputation of the affected\nsoftware firm, but those of all its customers as well. Detecting such threats during\ndevelopment and before software ships is key to preventing the next 3CX-style incident.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOC) list\n\n**filename** **sha1**\n\n3cxdesktopapp-18.12.407.msi bea77d1e59cf18dce22ad9a2fad52948fd7a9efa\n\n3cxdesktopapp-18.12.416.msi bfecb8ce89a312d2ef4afc64a63847ae11c6f69e\n\n\n-----\n\n3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416-full.nupkg f7f1b34c2770d83e2250e19c8425a4bec56617fd\n\n3CXDesktopApp_v18.12.407.0.exe 6285ffb5f98d35cd98e78d48b63a05af6e4e4dea\n\n3CXDesktopApp_v18.12.416.0.exe 8433a94aedb6380ac8d4610af643fb0e5220c5cb\n\nffmpeg.dll bf939c9c261d27ee7bb92325cc588624fca75429\n\nffmpeg.dll 188754814b37927badc988b45b7c7f7d6b4c8dd3\n\nffmpeg.dll ff3dd457c0d00d00d396fdf6ebe7c254fed2a91e\n\nd3dcompiler_47_v10.0.20348.1.dll 20d554a80d759c50d6537dd7097fed84dd258b3e\n\ndecrypted shellcode 8b81f6012fd748f0fed53eeef72164435ad618ac\n\nsamcli.dll (embedded in shellcode) 3b88cda62cdd918b62ef5aa8c5a73a46f176d18b\n\n3CXDesktopApp-18.11.1213.dmg 19f4036f5cd91c5fc411afc4359e32f90caddaac\n\n3CXDesktopApp-18.12.416.dmg 3dc840d32ce86cebf657b17cef62814646ba8e98\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib (universal) b2a89eebb5be61939f5458a024c929b169b4dc85\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib (universal) 769383fc65d1386dd141c960c9970114547da0c2\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib (x86-64) 354251ca9476549c391fbd5b87e81a21a95949f4\n\nlibffmpeg.dylib (x86-64) 5b0582632975d230c8f73c768b9ef39669fefa60\n\n_[Learn how application security is evolving to tackle supply chain security.
