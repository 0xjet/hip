ESET researchers have decided to call one of the variants DarkMusical\nbecause many of the names the attackers chose for their files and folders are inspired\nby the movie High School Musical.\nThese attacks are focused on government and military organizations, Ministries of\nForeign Affairs, and embassies and are motivated by cyberespionage.\nTargets are primarily located in South Asia – Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and\nNepal. However, targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the\nMiddle East, Europe, North America, and Latin America, has been observed.\nESET’s investigation spans more than a year from September 2020 to October 2021.\nA recent report by Amnesty International links the group’s malware to an Indian\ncybersecurity company that may be selling the spyware.\nThe group has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two\nyears and it’s possible that the attackers have compromised the email accounts of\nsome of their victims.\n\n**BRATISLAVA, MONTREAL — January 18, 2022 — ESET researchers have uncovered**\nrecent campaigns and an updated threat arsenal of the infamous APT group Donot Team\n(also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02). According to research findings, the group is very\npersistent and has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two\nyears. For this research, ESET monitored Donot Team for more than a year from September\n2020 to October 2021. According to ESET telemetry, the APT group focuses on a small\nnumber of targets primarily in South Asia — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal.\nHowever, targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the Middle East,\nEurope, North America, and Latin America, is not outside the group’s realm. These attacks\nare focused on government and military organizations, Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and\nembassies and are motivated by cyberespionage.\n\nDonot Team is a threat actor operating since at least 2016 that is known for targeting\norganizations and individuals in South Asia with Windows and Android malware. A recent\nreport by Amnesty International links the group’s malware to an Indian cybersecurity\ncompany that may be selling the spyware or offering a hackers-for-hire service to\ngovernments of the region.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have been closely following the activities of Donot Team, and have traced several\ncampaigns that leverage Windows malware derived from the group’s signature yty malware\nframework,” says ESET researcher Facundo Muñoz, who led the investigation into the\ngroup’s activities.\n\nThe main purpose of the “yty” malware framework is to collect and exfiltrate data. The\nmalicious framework consists of a chain of downloaders that ultimately download a backdoor\nwith minimal functionality, used to download and execute further components of Donot\nTeam’s toolset. These include file collectors based on file extension and year of creation,\nscreen capturers, keyloggers, reverse shells, and more.\n**_Countries targeted in recent Donot Team campaigns_**\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, Donot Team has been consistently targeting the same entities\nwith waves of spearphishing emails every two to four months. The spearphishing emails\nhave malicious Microsoft Office documents attached that the attackers use to deploy their\nmalware.\n\nInterestingly, the emails that ESET researchers were able to retrieve and analyze did not\nshow signs of spoofing. “Some emails were sent from the same organizations that were\nbeing attacked. It’s possible that the attackers may have compromised the email accounts of\nsome of their victims in earlier campaigns, or the email server used by those organizations,”\nsays Muñoz.\n\nIn the latest blogpost, ESET has analyzed two variants of the yty malware framework: Gedit\nand DarkMusical. ESET researchers have decided to call one of the variants DarkMusical\nbecause of the names the attackers chose for their files and folders: many are western\ncelebrities or characters in the movie High School Musical. This variant was used in\ncampaigns targeting military organizations in Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\nFor more technical details about the Donot Team’s latest campaigns, read the blogpost\n[“DoNot Go!
