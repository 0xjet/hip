We noticed one sample submitted to Virus Total that was attributed by some experts to the Russian APT28 group. \n\n The APT28 group (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and Strontium) has been active since at least 2007 and it has targeted governments, militaries, and security organizations worldwide.\n\n The group was involved also in the string of attacks that targeted 2016 Presidential election.\n\n With the help of the researcher that goes online with the Twitter handle Drunk Binary (@DrunkBinary) we obtained a collection of samples to compare with the one we were in possession to discover if we were in presence of a new variant of the infamous APT28 backdoor tracked as X-Agent.\n\n The attack we analyzed is multi-stage, an initial dropper malware written in Delphi programming language (a language used by the APT28 in other campaigns) downloads a second stage payload from internet and executes it. The payload communicates to the server using HTTPS protocol, making it impossible to eavesdrop on the malicious traffic it generates.\n\n We also analyzed another malicious DLL, apparently unrelated to the previous samples, that presents many similarities with other payloads attributed to the Russian APT group. This malware is particularly interesting for us because it contacts a command and control with the name “marina-info.net” a clear reference to the Italian Military corp, Marina Militare. This lead us into speculating that the malicious code was developed as part of targeted attacks against the Italian Marina Militare, or some other entities associated with it.\n\n This last DLL seems to be completely unconnected with the previous samples, but further investigation leads us into believing that it was an additional component used by APT28 in this campaign to compromise the target system.\n\n APT28 has a rich arsenal composed of a large number of modular threats and the dll is the component of the X-Agent we analyzed. X-Agent is a persistent payload injected into the victim machine that can be compiled for almost any\n\n**CSE CyberSec Enterprise SPA**\n**Via G.B. Martini 6, Rome, Italy 00100, Italia**\n**[Email: info@csecybsec.com](mailto:info@csecybsec.com)**\n**[Website: www.csecybsec.com](http://csecybsec.com/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Operating System and can be enhanced by adding new ad-hoc component developed for the specific cyber-attack. In our case, the component was submitted to online sandboxes while the new campaign was ongoing. We cannot exclude that the APT group developed the backdoor to target specific organizations including the Italian Marina Militare or any other subcontractor. In our analysis we were not able to directly connect the malicious dll file to the X-Agent samples, but believe they are both part of a well-coordinated surgical attack powered by APT28.\n\n The dll that connect to “marina-info.net” may be the last stage-malware that is triggered only when particular conditions occur, for example when the malware infects a system with an IP address belonging to specific ranges.\n\n**CSE CyberSec Enterprise SPA**\n**Via G.B.

It is not clear if this sample is connected to the previous ones, but probably it belongs to the same infection campaign because it was uploaded in the same time period on several online sandboxes. \n\n Another characteristic in common to the previous files is that, this one is written in Delphi programming language, like also the four initial file droppers. It is rare to find a malware written in Delphi language, but previous investigations conducted by other security firms confirm that the APT28 group already used malware written in this language in past campaigns.\n\n The most important evidence emerged from the analysis of the sdbn.dll is that it contacted the domain: “marina-info.net,” a clear reference to the Italian Marina Militare. The domain is resolved in the IP “191.101.31.250” which is located in Holland:\n\n**CSE CyberSec Enterprise SPA**\n**Via G.B.

However, we discovered that the server responds always with 403 Status code Forbidden, also to the requests sent by the malware itself. \n\n_Figure 10 - Response from the C2C_\n\n### This behavior could be the result of a server-side control implemented by the server to allow the requests coming only from particular IP addresses or simply it was intentionally disabled by the attackers likely because they believe to have been uncovered by the victims or by the security firms. It could be a security mechanism implemented by the attackers to make hard the investigation of security firms. Moreover, we decided to further investigate the detection rate of this new file on VirusTotal. When we started our analysis it was zero, this means that the threat was completely undetected and currently the malicious code has a detection rate of 35/65.\n\n**CSE CyberSec Enterprise SPA**\n**Via G.B.
