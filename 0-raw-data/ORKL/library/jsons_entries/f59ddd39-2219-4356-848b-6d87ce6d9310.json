Originally suspected to be a\nransomware because of its name, analysis reveals RURansom to be a wiper.\n\nBy: Jaromir Horejsi, Cedric Pernet\nMarch 08, 2022\nRead time: 4 min (972 words)\n\nA conflict in cyberspace is unfolding parallel to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the ground.\n[Cyberattacks are being lobbed against both Russian and Ukrainian sides, with a new wiper directed against](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/cyberattacks-are-prominent-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict.html)\nRussia joining the fray.\n\n[On March 1, a tweet from MalwareHunterTeam about a possible ransomware variant caught our attention](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1498678603613155343)\nand set our immediate analysis into motion. We found several additional samples of this malware, which\nhas been dubbed as “RURansom” by its developer. Despite its name, analysis has revealed it to be a wiper\nand not a ransomware variant because of its irreversible destruction of encrypted files.\n\n## Targeting Russia\n\nBased on our telemetry, we have not yet observed active targets for this malware family. One possible\nreason for this is that the wiper has only targeted a few entries in Russia so far.\n\nRURansom’s code, however, makes its author’s motives clear. Figure 1 shows the code variable responsible\nfor the malware’s ransom note.\n\nFigure 1. Code snippet of what will be written in the ransom note file\n\nThe note reads in English as follows:\n\nOn February 24, President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine.\", \"To counter this, I, the creator of\nRU_Ransom, created this malware to harm Russia. You bought this for yourself, Mr. President.\", \"There is no way to\ndecrypt your files. No payment, only damage. And yes, this is \\\"peacekeeping\\\" like Vladi Papa does, killing innocent\ncivilians\", \"And yes, it was translated from Bangla into Russian using Google Translate... (This is a direct\ntranslation.)\n\nWe detected different versions of the malware between February 26 and March 2, 2022. Upon further\nanalysis, we have learned more details about its capabilities.\n\nRURansom: A new wiper\n\nThe malware is written in .NET programming language and spreads as a worm by copying itself under the\nfile name \"Россия-Украина_Война-Обновление.doc.exe\" to all removable disks and mapped network\nshares. Translated into English, the file name reads as “Russia-Ukraine_War-Update.doc.exe.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Code snippet showing RURansom’s spreading mechanism\n\nAfter successfully spreading, the malware then begins encryption. If the assigned disk letter is “C:\\,” for\nexample, the files in the folder “C:\\\\Users\\\\<UserName>\" are encrypted. For other removable and\nmapped network drives, all files that recursively branch from the root directory are encrypted.\n\nEncryption is applied to all file extensions except for “.bak” files, which are deleted. The files are encrypted\nwith a randomly generated key with length equal to base64 (\"FullScaleCyberInvasion + \" +\nMachineName).\n\nFigure 3. Code showing the length of the randomly generated key for encryption, with\n\nan extra “+,” which is likely a typo\n\nThe encryption algorithm is AES-CBC using a hard-coded salt. The keys are unique for each encrypted file\nand are not stored anywhere, making the encryption irreversible and marking the malware as a wiper\nrather than a ransomware variant.\n\nThe “ransom” note, which is the file “Полномасштабное_кибервторжение.txt” (translated as “Fullblown_cyber-invasion.txt”), is then dropped into each directory. However, it is more accurate to say that\nthis is a wiper note.\n\nAs seen in the code in Figure 1, the note states its developer’s sentiments and also reveals that the author\nused Google Translate to convey their message in Russian from the original Bangla.\n\nStill in development\n\nWe have discovered several versions of RURansom. Some of these versions check if the IP address where\nthe software is launched is in Russia. In cases where the software is launched outside of Russia, these\nversions will stop execution, showing a conscious effort to target only Russian-based computers. While\n[most samples were unobfuscated, we found one version using ConfuserEx for obfuscation.](https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/)\n\nOther versions also attempt to start the process with elevated\nprivileges. These different versions and modifications might\nindicate that the malware was still undergoing development at\nthe time of writing.\n\n\nOther activities from the same author\n\n\nFigure 4. Code snippet where the malware\n\ntests if it is being run from Russia\n\n\nAside from RURansom, the developer appears to have been\nworking on another “wiper” dubbed as “dnWipe.” Its payload is executed every Tuesday.\n\nWe analyzed dnWipe and found that it simply encodes content in base64 for the following file extensions:\n.doc, .docx, .png, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .mp4, .txt, .flv, .mp3, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, and .xlsx. Therefore, just as\nRURansom is not really a ransomware variant, dnWipe also cannot be classified as an example of a wiper\nmalware because its encoding can be decoded easily.\n\nOther binaries that we can attribute with high confidence to the same developer indicate their other\ninterests. For one, they have also compiled a downloader for an XMRig binary, showing an inclination for\ncryptocurrency mining.\n\n\n-----\n\nConclusion\n\nNo one can be indifferent to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. People all over the world are actively\ntaking sides, and malware developers are no exception.\n\nAs this blog entry shows, the exchange of attacks in cyberspace is reflective of this conflict: Leaks have\n[exposed Russian-based cybercriminal groups behind Conti and TrickBot, while a destructive wiper has](https://www.reuters.com/technology/details-another-big-ransomware-group-trickbot-leak-online-experts-say-2022-03-04/)\nattacked organizations in Ukraine. Now, the RURansom wiper is seeking out Russian targets.\n\nWe see RURansom as just one attempt among a growing list of attacks that aim to support a position\nespoused strongly by an individual or a group. While we have not yet found any victims of this malware,\nseeing the evolution in its code leads us believe that its developer will keep updating their malware in an\neffort to deal some form of damage on Russia.\n\nIn general, the tense geopolitical situation has added an edge to cyberattacks. Ultimately, keeping defenses\nup, staying vigilant against misinformation, and monitoring the situation is essential in order to navigate\nthis uncertain state of affairs.\n\n[For more guidance on managing today’s cyber risks, please see our earlier blog post here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/b/ukraine-cyberattack-2022.html)\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n|SHA256|Detection name|\n|---|---|\n|107da216ad99b7c0171745fe7f826e51b27b1812d435b55c3ddb801e23137d8f|Ransom.MSIL.RUCRYPT.YXCCD|\n|1f36898228197ee30c7b0ec0e48e804caa6edec33e3a91eeaf7aa2c5bbb9c6e0|Ransom.MSIL.RUCRYPT.YXCCD|\n|610ec163e7b34abd5587616db8dac7e34b1aef68d0260510854d6b3912fb0008|Ransom.MSIL.RUCRYPT.YXCCD|\n|696b6b9f43e53387f7cef14c5da9b6c02b6bf4095849885d36479f8996e7e473|Ransom.MSIL.RUCRYPT.YXCCD|\n|8f2ea18ed82085574888a03547a020b7009e05ae0ecbf4e9e0b8fe8502059aae|Ransom.MSIL.RUCRYPT.YXCCD|\n|979f9d1e019d9172af73428a1b3cbdff8aec8fdbe0f67cba48971a36f5001da9|Ransom.MSIL.RUCRYPT.YXCCD|\n\n\n-----",
