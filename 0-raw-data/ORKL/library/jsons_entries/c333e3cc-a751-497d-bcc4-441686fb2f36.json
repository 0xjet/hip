The threat actor can then control\nthis botnet to perform DDoS attacks against a specific target, depleting their resources and\ndisrupting their online service.\n\nAs [Barracuda's report explains, Mirai is distributed in various forms and from different](https://blog.barracuda.com/2022/03/02/threat-spotlight-attacks-on-log4shell-vulnerabilities/)\nsources, indicating that the operators are attempting to build a large botnet that targets\nvictims of all sizes in the future.\n\nThe threat actors behind these operations are either renting their botnet firepower to others\nor are launching DDoS attacks themselves to extort companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther payloads seen dropped by recent Log4j exploitation include:\n\nBillGates malware (DDoS)\nKinsing (cryptominer)\nXMRig (cryptominer)\nMuhstik (DDoS)\n\n**Script to set up the miner** _(Barracuda)_\nBarracuda's analysts say they did not see ransomware gangs exploiting publicly exposed\nVMWare installations and believe it's being used more as an insider threat for already\ncompromised networks.\n\n[For example, the Conti Ransomware used Log4j exploits to spread laterally to VMware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-uses-log4j-bug-to-hack-vmware-vcenter-servers/)\nvCenter installations\n\n## A permanent threat\n\nThe simplest way to protect against these types of attacks is to update Log4j to version\n2.17.1 or later and keep all your web applications up to date in general.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs most of the devices targeted by Mirai do not allow you to update individual packages, you\nwill need to check for updated firmware that contains Log4j fixes and apply them if available.\n\nWhile Barracuda reports seeing a steady volume of Log4Shell attacks, Sophos has recently\n[reported a decline. However, all analysts agree that the threat remains.](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/01/24/log4shell-no-mass-abuse-but-no-respite-what-happened/)\n\n**Volume of attacks targeting Log4j** _(Barracuda)_\nEven if the interest of [the majority of threat actors fades, some will continue to target](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-start-pushing-malware-in-worldwide-log4shell-attacks/)\nvulnerable Log4j deployments since their numbers remain notable.\n\nValuable organizations that were lucrative for ransomware attacks have applied the security\nupdates, but for purposes of cryptomining and DDoS attacks, neglected systems that run\nolder versions are excellent targets.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New EnemyBot DDoS botnet recruits routers and IoTs into its army](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-enemybot-ddos-botnet-recruits-routers-and-iots-into-its-army/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Lazarus hackers target VMware servers with Log4Shell exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lazarus-hackers-target-vmware-servers-with-log4shell-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Log4j: List of vulnerable products and vendor advisories](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/log4j-list-of-vulnerable-products-and-vendor-advisories/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
