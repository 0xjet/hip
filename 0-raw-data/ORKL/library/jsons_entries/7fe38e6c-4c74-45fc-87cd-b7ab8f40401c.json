One using a new malware family we call\n\n“MsAttacker” that we have not observed before, and another using the ShadowNet malware family and\ncommand and control infrastructure related to previous campaigns known to have targeted the Tibetan\ncommunity.\n\n  - We include user recommendations for preventing infection and indicators of compromise for\n\nresearchers to identify MsAttacker.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nOn March 10 1959, amidst growing unrest, Tibetans took to the streets of the capital Lhasa to protest the\nChinese occupation of Tibet. Thousands surrounded the Potala Palace, then the home of His Holiness the\nDalai Lama (HHDL), spurred by fears that he was to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. Following this\nevent, escalation of tensions between Chinese and Tibetan forces led to HHDL escaping Tibet and taking up\nexile in northern India.\n\nThe anniversary of the March 10 Tibetan Uprising is a major event in the Tibetan diaspora, commemorated\n[with a day of protest around the world to raise awareness around Tibetan rights issues. It is a period of](https://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/campaigns/political-action/uprising-day)\nintensive activism and mobilization for many Tibetan organizations.\n\n[In previous research, we described how attackers leverage the heightened activity around the event with social](https://targetedthreats.net/)\nengineering campaigns, seeding targeted malware. For example, we have found personalized e-mails that use\nreferences to the anniversary to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments.\n\nIn this report we analyze two separate email-based targeted malware attacks that use the March 10 anniversary\nas a theme.\n\n\n-----\n\n## ATTACK 1: MSATTACKER\n\nOn March 5 2015, an email with the subject line “10th March 2015 campaign for Tibet” was sent to hundreds\nof individuals and organizations from the Tibetan community. The email purported to come from a wellknown Tibetan NGO and contained information about a series of events planned to commemorate the 56th\nanniversary of the Tibetan Uprising.\n\n[Attached to the email was a malicious Microsoft Word file “10th March.doc” that used the exploit CVE-2012-](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\n[0158, which is a vulnerability in how Microsoft Word handles RTF documents. This vulnerability has been](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\n[patched since April 10, 2012](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms12-027.aspx) [but has remained the most frequently used CVE we have observed in malware](https://targetedthreats.net/)\n[attacks against Tibetan groups](https://targetedthreats.net/) for the last two years. Its repeated usage suggests that attackers are successfully\ncompromising members of the community, because their systems do not have the latest software updates.\nThe exploit was used to deliver a malware family that does not match any available signatures and has not\nbeen observed by us in previous attacks against the Tibetan community.\n\n[The malware first connects to a command and control server (C2) 122.10.117.152 located in Guangzhou,](http://bgp.he.net/ip/122.10.117.152)\n[China.](http://bgp.he.net/ip/122.10.117.152)\n\nThe malware then downloads a stage 2 binary: [c2 ip]/download/ms/MiniJs.dll\n\nThis file is copied to c:\\windows\\system32\\teamviewsvc.dll and creates a service to run on startup. It then\nconnects to 23.27.127.200 to receive further requests.\n\nWe call this family “MsAttacker” after an event name in the stage 2 binary.\n\nWe were also provided with another sample of MsAttacker that was also sent on March 5 in a highly targeted\nattack against a Tibet-related NGO. The email contained information about a private event the group was\nplanning that was unrelated to March 10 activities. The attachment contained the same payload as the first\nMarch 10 related attack.\n\nWe found one other example of this malware in the wild. On March 5, an analysis of a file “WTO. non-market\n[status China _1_.doc” was posted to Malwr (a community malware analysis platform). This sample was from](https://malwr.com/analysis/MDE4MDMzNGQ0MjY2NDY1OWE5ZTVhMDRmZjQzNTlkYWM/)\nthe same family and also connected to 122.10.117.152.\n\n## ATTACK 2: SHADOWNET\n\nIn another attack on March 5, members of a Tibetan human rights organization received an email appearing to\ncome from the group’s organizational mailing list. The email message contained information from the\nsecretary of the Bureau of His Holiness the Dalai Lama regarding events related to March 10. Attached was a\nmalicious Microsoft Word file that had the same filename as the previous attack (10th March.doc) and also\nused CVE-2012-0158. However, the malware used in this attack is from the ShadowNet family.\n\n[ShadowNet malware leverages Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a system tool meant for](http://la.trendmicro.com/media/misc/understanding-wmi-malware-research-paper-en.pdf)\nadministrators. Its intended usage as a tool for collecting system information and automation makes it an ideal\nmechanism for gathering and exfiltrating data. The use of legitimate Windows features can make it more\ndifficult for administrators to identify activity as malicious.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ShadowNet typically uses multi-layered C2 infrastructure that first connects to blog websites and then](http://www.nartv.org/mirror/shadows-in-the-cloud.pdf)\nretrieves C2 information from encoded strings left on the blog. By using blog sites as intermediaries the\nattackers can maintain control of compromised machines even if a C2 is blocked by a network firewall or\notherwise goes down. If a C2 needs to be updated the attackers can simply point the intermediaries to new\nservers.\n\nThe sample used in this attack includes a WMI Script with links to three blogs\n(hxxp://johnsmith152.typepad.com/blog/rss.xml; hxxp://mynewshemm.wordpress.com/feed/;\nhxxp://johnsmith5382.thoughts.com/feed). The blogs contain an encoded string that points to the actual C2:\nhxxp://www.semamail.info/firex/test.php, which has the IP 122.10.117.5 and is on the same Autonomous\nSystem (AS 24544) as the C2 for the MsAttacker sample. Apart from this commonality and the timing of the\nattack we do not observe any other linkages between the MsAttacker and ShadowNet attacks.\n\n[The domain (semamail.info) has questionable whois information:](http://whois.domaintools.com/semamail.info)\n\n\nRegistrant Name: Kasong Dolma\nRegistrant Street: New York\nRegistrant City:New York\nRegistrant State/Province:guangdong\nRegistrant Postal Code:10001\nRegistrant Country:CN\nRegistrant Phone:+1.9175608889\n[Registrant Email: mike.fly@email.com](mailto:mike.fly@email.com)\n\n\nThis same registration information has been used for a number of other domains including\n[conamail.info, convmail.info, and fifamp3.info. The domain fifamp3.info resolves to 122.10.117.35. Passive](https://www.passivetotal.org/)\n[DNS](https://www.passivetotal.org/) records show that the same IP has pointed to rukiyeangel.dyndns.pro, which is related to C2\n[infrastructure used in the Lucky Cat and TseringKanyaq](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf) campaigns. ShadowNet was also used in both of\nthese campaigns. The overlap between C2 infrastructure and malware families suggests some level of\ncoordination between this new attack and the previous campaigns.\n\n## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese attacks are a reminder that members of the Tibetan community are consistently targeted, and that the\nthreat seems to increase during important Tibetan events.\n\nThese kinds of attacks can be mitigated through greater user awareness and changes in behaviour. Users in\ntargeted communities should always be cautious about unsolicited emails containing links or attachments and\nshould carefully examine the email sender addresses in suspicious messages.\n\nViewing documents through the Gmail preview feature, or by uploading them to Google Docs to view them\n[can make it possible to look at the content of attachments without risking infection](https://www.cybersuperhero.net/detach-from-attachments/) of a machine. Suspicious\n[files can also be submitted to VirusTotal (but should not be submitted if the files contain personal information)](https://www.virustotal.com/)\nor shared with technical experts within the community.\n\n[For further resources on digital security the Citizen Lab recommends Tibet Action Institute’s Be a Cyber](https://www.cybersuperhero.net/)\n[Super Hero](https://www.cybersuperhero.net/) project. We are continuing to closely analyze these attacks and the MsAttacker malware family.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe will post further details as they become available.\n\n## INDICATORS\n\n**_MsAttacker Samples_**\n\n**Stage 0**\n\n**MD5: 8346b50c3954b5c25bf13fcd281eb11a  SHA1:**\nd9a74528bb56a841cea1fe5fa3e0c777a8e96402  SHA256:\nde7058700f06c5310c26944b28203bc82035f9ff74021649db39a24470517fd1\n\n**Stage 0**\n\n**MD5: 6fc909a57650daff9a8b9264f38444a7**\n**SHA1: 2a2a1fae6be0468d388aa2c721a0edd93fb37649**\n**SHA256: a264cec4096a04c47013d41dcddab9f99482f8f83d61e13be4bcf4614f79b7a0**\n\n**Stage 1**\n\n**MD5: 69a0f490de6ae9fdde0ad9cc35305a7d**\n**SHA1: e3532fc890f659fb6afb9115b388e0024565888c**\n**SHA256: 3de8fb09d79166f10f4a10aef1202c2cb45849943f224dc6c61df8d18435e064**\n\n**Stage 2**\n\n**MD5: 2782c233ddde25040fb1febf9b13611e**\n**SHA1: be50ef6c94f3b630886e1b337e89f4ea9d6e7649**\n**SHA256: 50aebd2a1e3b8917d6c2b5e88c2e2999b2368fca550c548d0836aa57e35c463f**\n**C2s**\n122.10.117.152\n23.27.127.200\n\n**_Ms Attacker Identifiers_**\n\n**Stage 1 Strings**\n\n\nhttp://122.10.117.152/download/ms/CryptBase.32.cab\nhttp://122.10.117.152/download/ms/CryptBase.64.cab\nhttp://122.10.117.152/download/ms/MiniJS.dll\nMiniJS.dll\ngupdate.exe\nrundll32.exe %s install %s\n%s;new Downloader('%s', '%s').Fire();\nrundll32.exe %s RealService %s\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stage 2 Strings**\n\nMiniJS.dll\nRealService\n%s \"rundll32.exe %s RealService %s\" /f\nreg delete HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v \"Start Pages\" /f\nTeamView\n3111431114311121270018000127001808012700180\nGlobal\\MSAttacker %d\n\n**_ShadowNet Samples_**\n\n**Stage 0**\n\n**MD5: 72707089512762fce576e29a0472eb16**\n**SHA1: 4ab039da14acf7d80fbb11034ef9ccc861c5ed24**\n**SHA256: ddfa44ebb181282e815e965a1c531c7e145128aa7306b508a563e10d5f9f03fb**\n\n**Stage 1**\n\n**MD5: d8ae44cd65f97654f066edbcb501d999**\n**SHA1: 602a762dca46f7639210e60c59f89a6e7a16391b**\n**SHA256: e8f36317e29206d48bd0e6dd6570872122be44f82ca1de01aef373b3cdb2c0e1**\n\n**C2s**\nhxxp://www.semamail.info/firex/test.php (122.10.117.5)\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThanks to Chris Davis, PassiveTotal, and Adam Senft.\n\n\n-----",
