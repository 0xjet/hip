Then press “Scan”.\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers may also check the “Overwrite existing clean files” option under “Advanced\noptions” so the tool will overwrite possible present clean files with their decrypted equivalent.\n\nAt the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.\n\n[If you encounter any issues, please contact us at forensics@bitdefender.com.](mailto:forensics@bitdefender.com)\nIf you checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted files.\nYou can also find a log describing decryption process, in %temp%\\BDRemovalTool folder:\n\nTo get rid of your left encrypted files, just search for files matching the extension and\nremove them bulk. We do not encurage you to do this, unless you doubled check your files\ncan be opened safely and there is no trace of damage.\n\n**Silent execution (via cmdline)**\n\nThe tool also provides the possibility of running silently, via a command line. If you need to\nautomate the deployment of the tool inside a large network, you might want to use this feature.\n\n\n-----\n\n      - **-help - will provide information on how to run the tool silently (this information will**\nbe written in the log file, not on console)\n\n      - **start - this argument allows the tool to run silently (no GUI)**\n\n      - -path - this argument specifies the path to scan\n\n      - **o0:1 - will enable Scan entire system option (ignoring -path argument)**\n\n      - **o1:1 - will enable Backup files option**\n\n      - **o2:1 - will enable Overwrite existing files option**\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**BDREvilDecryptor.exe start -path:C:\\ -> the tool will start with no GUI and scan C:\\**\n**BDREvilDecryptor.exe start o0:1 -> the tool will start with no GUI and scan entire system**\n**BDREvilDecryptor.exe start o0:1 o1:1 o2:1 -> the tool will scan the entire system, backup**\nthe encrypted files and overwrite present clean files\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the\n[OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)](http://www.openssl.org/)\n\n\n-----",
