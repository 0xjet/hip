Summary of the event**\n\nIn February 2022, the mobile security team of Qi'anxin Virus Response Center noticed that since June 2021, an A _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ P& T organization mainly targets PakistanThe Tanzanian military has launched organized, planned and targeted\nmilitary espionage intelligence activities . _ After just nine months of attacks, the group has affected dozens of Pakistani military\npersonnel . _ This part of the victimThe personnel are mainly Pakistani national border guards ( FC ) and special forces ( SSG ),\nespecially the Balochistan border guards ( FCBLN ) ; in addition _ _ _ _ Also contains a small amount of FBI ( FIA ) and police (\nPolice ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Another attack also affected a small number of Nepalese personnel, but domestic users in China were not\naffected by it .\n\nFigure 1.1 Distribution of affected countries _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe organization usually uses public social platforms to find the target of concern, and combines pornographic words and other chats\nto induce the target users to install the specified bait chat attack application . Used for phishing attacks . Furthermore,The attacker\nalso published the malicious chat application on a well- known foreign app store platform, but the relevant links are now inaccessible\n.\nAs of the time of this report, all the attacks of this group that we have intercepted are carried out through the An d r oi d platform,\nand we have not found any Via the Windows platform _ _ _ _ _attack . _ _ A total of 8 malicious application download servers have\nbeen captured, and at least 5 different Android platform attack samples can be downloaded on the servers . _ _ All samples were _\n_Dedicated chat software for Italian codes . We name all these captured malicious samples V a j r a Sp y . _ _ _ _\nComprehensive analysis of the attack activity characteristics, sample coding method, C2 server architecture and other clues shows\nthat the organization has a regional power in South Asia . the background of the government, but also live with the regionOther APT\ntissues that jumped, such as Sidewinder Sidewinder, Manling Flower Bitter, Belly Brainworm Donot, etc., were not significantly\nassociated _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( Only with bellyworm D o no o t _ _There is a small amount of similarity ), with\nstrong independence and independent characteristics . Therefore, we identified this organization as a new APT organization active in\nSouth Asia . _ _ We named it King Kong Elephant, English _The document name is V a j r a E l e ph, and the organization number is\nA P T - Q - 4 3 . King Kong Elephant is the 15th APT organization that Qi Anxin independently discovered and first disclosed . _ _ _\n\n**2.  Load delivery _**\nThrough the Qi Anxin Virus Response Center mobile security team and the Qi Anxin threat intelligence platform ( h t t p s : / / t i . q i\na n x i n . c o m / ) joint tracking analysis found that, the earliest activities of the King Kong Elephant Organization can be traced back\nto June 2021 . The picture below shows the earliest payload server information of the organization that we intercepted .\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.1 Screenshot of the earliest domain name payload server discovered ( using Name Sil o registrar domain name ) _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nIn the early attacks of this group, the \" short link \" of the download address of the attack payload is usually sent to the target through\nsocial software such as WhatsApp . .

Attacker portrait _ _**\n\n1 ) The purpose of the attack\n\nAttackers targeted Pakistani military, security and police personnel, including border guards ( FC ), special forces ( SSG ), federal\ninvestigators _ _ _ _ _ _ Bureau ( FIA ) and Police ( P _ _o l ic e ) and so on . Among them, the border guards are the main target .\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are also a small number of activities targeting Nepalese military personnel . It can be seen from this that military personnel and\nmilitary secrets are thethe main purpose of the activity .\n2 ) Attack method\n\nAttackers are good at using social induced delivery and SMS induced delivery to attack, among which social induced delivery is the\nmain method .\n3 ) Network assets\nThe mobile phone numbers used by the attackers are all exclusive numbers of mobile service providers in a country in South Asia .\n4 ) Native language features\nThe attackers used a large number of languages  from a South Asian country in their attacks . The country has a longstanding military\nand geopolitical conflict with Pakistan . _ _\n5 ) Association with other APT organizations _ _ _\n\nThe activity characteristics of the malicious sample download server are similar to those of the belly worm ( Donot ) . _ _ _\nSome of the filenames used in the attack have certain similarities to the bellyworm tissue . _ _\nTo sum up, the King Kong Elephant Organization should be a senior executive with a government background in a South Asian\ncountry who mainly launched cyber attacks against Pakistani military personnel and military activities . attack group, is an active\n_New APT organization in South Asia . _ _ _\n\n**6.  Summary and Recommendations _**\n\nIn traditional APT activities, the use of mobile social platforms is not common . _ _ This is because most of the sensitive and\nconfidential information is stored on the computer, and on the other hand, it is also caused byBecause of launching attacks through\nsocial platforms, it is easy to leave traces .\nHowever, in the past two years, with the increasing popularity of mobile social platforms, we have found that many A P T activities\ntargeting developing countries will be more or less Via mobile platforms, social platformsto proceed . For example, the Nuo Chong\nLion Organization, the Blade Eagle Organization and the Diamond Elephant Organization disclosed this time all target the An d r oi d\nplatform and _ _ _ _ _ network of social platformsattack activity . The analysis believes that the reasons for the increasing attention\nof APT activities on mobile platforms and social platforms mainly include the following aspects :\nFirst of all, the level of network security construction and management in many developing countries is relatively backward, so that it\nis possible to gain access to smartphones only through attacks on smartphones . large amounts of sensitive and confidential\ninformation.\nSecond, the popularity of smartphones is getting higher and higher . It is a low-cost, high -cost way to launch cyber attacks through\nsocial platforms against secret -related personnel with insufficient security awareness . Efficient attack . _ _\nThird, smartphones often have more unfixed security vulnerabilities, and the penetration rate of mobile security software is not high\n, which leads to the launch of network targeting mobile platforms . The technical threshold of attack is relatively lower.\nThen, for government and enterprise institutions, especially the military, police and other secret or sensitive institutions, how\nshould they do a good job in protection, and try to avoid or reduce the targeting of immigrants as much as possible ? App for mobile\nplatforms and social platforms _What is the impact of T activities on yourself ? Here we give some practical suggestions as follows .\n1 ) Work and life are separated, and sensitive information is not shared\n\nAgencies should strive to avoid staff using personal smartphones for routine office activities . _ _ Conditional units can distribute\nwork mobile phones or confidential mobile phones to staff . _ _ If the conditions are trueIt is not allowed . You can use enterprise level secure mobile work platforms for internal communication and office work, such as Lanxin and cloud mobile phone security\nmanagement systems .\n2 ) Strengthen safety awareness education and strictly implement safety regulations\n\nRelevant institutions should strengthen employee security awareness education, do not use personal mobile phones to shoot, store\nsensitive or confidential information, and do not share sensitive or confidential information through social platforms information ;\ndon’t click on strangers’ postsUnknown links come ; reject the temptation of illegal information such as pornography and gambling .\nAt the same time, relevant agencies should also formulate practical cybersecurity management standards and employee code of\nconduct, and carry out strictSupervision and review .\n3 ) Update software system, use security software\n\nRelevant institutions should require employees, whether it is an office mobile phone or a personal mobile phone, to update the\noperating system and core software in a timely manner to ensure that the smart phone starts to work . Always in the best safe\ncondition . sameInstall the necessary mobile phone security software at any time to reduce the damage of various Trojan horses and\nviruses as much as possible .\n4 ) Establish threat intelligence capabilities to prevent APT attacks _ _\n\n\n-----\n\nRelevant institutions should work with professional security vendors to build efficient threat information collection, analysis and\ndisposal capabilities, and timely detect, intercept and track various APT activities . _ move, bring APT activities to the _ _Impact\nand losses are minimized .\nAt present, a full line of products based on Qi'anxin 's self - developed Owl engine and Qi'anxin Threat Intelligence Center 's threat\nintelligence data, including Qi'anxin 's threat intelligence platform ( TIP ), Tianqing, Tianji _ _ _, Sky Eye Advanced Threat\nDetection System, Qi An Xin N G SOC, Qi An Xin Situational Awareness, etc., have all supported the accurate detection of such\nattacks .\n\n**Part IOC _ _**\n\n**Domain name / IP** **Purpose**\n\na p p p l a c e . s h o p payload server\n\na p p z . l i v e payload server\n\na p z s h a r e . c l u b payload server\n\na p p z s h a r e . d i g i t a l payload server\n\na p p z s h a r e . c l u b payload server\n\n2 1 2 . 2 4 . 1 0 0 . 1 9 7 payload server\n\n**A n d r o i d M D 5** **package name**\n\n7 a 4 7 d 8 5 9 d 5 e e 7 1 9 3 4 0 1 8 4 3 3 e 3 a b 7 e d 5 b c o m . cr . c ha t _ _\n\n0 c 9 8 0 f 4 7 5 7 6 6 f 3 a 5 7 f 3 5 d 1 9 f 4 4 b 0 7 6 6 6 c o m . c r a z y . t a l k\n\nAppendix 1 Qi Anxin Virus Response Center\n\n**Qi'anxin Virus Response Center is a virus identification and response professional team under Beijing Qi'anxin Technology Co.,**\nLtd.
