The ransomware will also not encrypt files or folders in the list below:\n```\nAppData\nBoot\nWindows\nWindows.old\nTor Browser\nInternet Explorer\nGoogle\nOpera\nOpera Software\nMozilla\nMozilla Firefox\n$Recycle.Bin\nProgramData\nAll Users\nautorun.inf\nboot.ini\nbootfont.bin\nbootsect.bak\nbootmgr\nbootmgr.efi\nbootmgfw.efi\ndesktop.ini\niconcache.db\nntldr\nntuser.dat\nntuser.dat.log\nntuser.ini\nthumbs.db\nProgram Files\nProgram Files (x86)\n#recycle\n\n```\nWhen encrypting files, Night Sky will append the .nightsky extension to encrypted file\nnames, as shown in the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Night Sky encrypted files**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nIn each folder a ransom note named NightSkyReadMe.htacontains information related to\nwhat was stolen, contact emails, and hard coded credentials to the victim's negotiation\npage.\n\n**Night Sky ransom note**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nInstead of using a Tor site to communicate with victims, Night Sky uses email addresses\nand a clear web website running Rocket.Chat. The credentials are used to log in to the\nRocket.Chat URL provided in the ransom note.\n\n**Night Sky Rocket.Chat negotiation site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\n\n## Double-extortion tactic\n\nA common tactic used by ransomware operations is to steal unencrypted data from victims\nbefore encrypting devices on the network.\n\nThe threat actors then use this stolen data in a \"double-extortion\" strategy, where they\nthreaten to leak the data if a ransom is not paid.\n\nTo leak victim's data, Night Sky has created a Tor data leak site that currently includes two\nvictims, one from Bangladesh and another from Japan.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Night Sky**\n\n**data leak site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhile there has not been a lot of activity with the new Night Sky ransomware operation, it is\none that we need to keep an eye on as we head into the new year.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Double-Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/double-extortion/)\n[Night Sky](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/night-sky/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
