    "plain_text": "# Wazawaka Goes Waka Waka\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2022/02/wazawaka-goes-waka-waka/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/02/wazawaka-goes-waka-waka/)**\n\nIn January, KrebsOnSecurity examined clues left behind by “Wazawaka,” the hacker handle\nchosen by a major ransomware criminal in the Russian-speaking cybercrime scene.\nWazawaka has since “lost his mind” according to his erstwhile colleagues, creating a Twitter\naccount to drop exploit code for a widely-used virtual private networking (VPN) appliance,\nand publishing bizarre selfie videos taunting security researchers and journalists.\n\nWazawaka, a.k.a. Mikhail P. Matveev, a.k.a. “Orange,” a.k.a. “Boriselcin,” showing off his missing ring\n\nfinger.\n\nIn [last month’s story, we explored clues that led from Wazawaka’s multitude of monikers,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/who-is-the-network-access-broker-wazawaka/)\nemail addresses, and passwords to a 30-something father in Abakan, Russia named Mikhail\n**Pavlovich Matveev. This post concerns itself with the other half of Wazawaka’s identities**\nnot mentioned in the first story, such as how Wazawaka also ran the Babuk ransomware\naffiliate program, and later became “Orange,” the founder of the ransomware-focused Dark\nWeb forum known as “RAMP.”\n\nThe same day the initial profile on Wazawaka was published here, someone registered the\n[Twitter account “@fuck_maze,” a possible reference to the now-defunct Maze Ransomware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/waza-twitter.png)\ngang.\n\nThe background photo for the @fuck_maze profile included a logo that read “Waka Waka;”\n[the bio for the account took a swipe at Dmitry Smilyanets, a researcher and blogger for The](https://twitter.com/ddd1ms?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n[Record who was once part of a cybercrime group the Justice Department called the “largest](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-admits-role-largest-known-data-breach-conspiracy-ever-prosecuted)\n\n\n-----\n\nknown data breach conspiracy ever prosecuted.\n\nThe @fuck_maze account messaged me a few times on Twitter, but largely stayed silent\nuntil Jan. 25, when it tweeted three videos of a man who appeared identical to Matveev’s\nsocial media profile on Vkontakte (the Russian version of Facebook). The man seemed to be\nslurring his words quite a bit, and started by hurling obscenities at Smilyanets, journalist\n[Catalin Cimpanu (also at The Record), and a security researcher from Cisco Talos.](https://twitter.com/campuscodi)\n\nAt the beginning of the videos, Matveev holds up his left hand to demonstrate that his ring\nfinger is missing. This he smugly presents as evidence that he is indeed Wazawaka.\n\nThe story goes that Wazwaka at one point made a bet wherein he wagered his finger, and\nupon losing the bet severed it himself. It’s unclear if that is the real story about how\nWazawaka lost the ring finger on his left hand; his remaining fingers appear oddly crooked.\n\n“Hello Brian Krebs! You did a really great job actually, really well, fucking great — it’s great\nthat journalism works so well in the US,” Matveev said in the video. “By the way, it is my\nvoice in the background, I just love myself a lot.”\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/G1LclbndLaM\n\nIn one of his three videos, Wazawaka says he’s going to release exploit code for a security\nvulnerability. Later that same day, the @fuck_maze account posted a link to a Pastebin-like\nsite that included working exploit code for a recently patched security hole in SonicWall VPN\n[appliances (CVE-2021-20028).](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0017)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen KrebsOnSecurity first started researching Wazawaka in 2021, it appeared this\nindividual also used two other important nicknames on the Russian-speaking crime forums.\nOne was Boriselcin, a particularly talkative and brash personality who was simultaneously\nthe public persona of Babuk, a ransomware affiliate program that surfaced on New Year’s\nEve 2020.\n\nThe other handle that appeared tied to Wazawaka was “Orange,” the founder of the RAMP\nransomware forum. I just couldn’t convincingly connect those two identities with Wazawaka\nusing the information available at the time. This post is an attempt to remedy that.\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2020, a new user named Biba99 registered on the English language cybercrime\nforum RaidForums. But the Biba99 account didn’t post to RaidForums until Dec. 31, 2020,\nwhen they announced the creation of the Babuk ransomware affiliate program.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, a new user “Babuk” registered on the crime forum Verified, using the\nemail address teresacox19963@gmail.com, and the instant message address\n“admin@babuk.im.” “We run an affiliate program,” Babuk explained in their introductory post\non Verified.\n\nA variety of clues suggest Boriselcin was the individual acting as spokesperson for Babuk.\nBoriselcin talked openly on the forums about working with Babuk, and fought with other\nmembers of the ransomware gang about publishing access to data stolen from victim\norganizations.\n\n[According to analysts at cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, between January and the end of](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/)\nMarch 2021, Babuk continued to post databases stolen from companies that refused to pay\na ransom, but they posted the leaks to both their victim shaming blog and to multiple\ncybercrime forums, an unusual approach.\n\nThis matches the ethos and activity of Wazawaka’s posts on the crime forums over the past\ntwo years. As I wrote in January:\n\n“Wazawaka seems to have adopted the uniquely communitarian view that when\norganizations being held for ransom decline to cooperate or pay up, any data stolen\nfrom the victim should be published on the Russian cybercrime forums for all to\nplunder — not privately sold to the highest bidder. In thread after thread on the crime\nforum XSS, Wazawaka’s alias ‘Uhodiransomwar’ can be seen posting download links\nto databases from companies that have refused to negotiate after five days.”\n\nAround Apr. 27, 2021, Babuk hacked the Washington Metropolitan Police Department,\ndemanding $4 million in virtual currency in exchange for a promise not to publish the police\ndepartment’s internal data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFlashpoint says that on April 30, Babuk announced they were shuttering the affiliate program\nand its encryption services, and that they would now focus on data theft and extortion\ninstead. On May 3, the group posted two additional victims of their data theft enterprise,\nshowing they are still in operation.\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Babuk declared negotiations with the MPD had reached an impasse, and\n[leaked 250 gigabytes worth of MPD data.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-release-personal-info-22-dc-police-officers-rcna897)\n\nOn May 14, 2021, Boriselcin announced on XSS his intention to post a writeup on how they\nhacked the DC Police (Boriselcin claims it was via the organization’s VPN).\n\nOn May 17, Babuk posted about an upcoming new ransomware leaks site that will serve as\na “huge platform for independent leaks,” — i.e., a community that would publish data stolen\nby no-name ransomware groups that don’t already have their own leaks/victim shaming\nplatforms.\n\nOn May 31, 2021, Babuk’s website began redirecting to Payload[.]bin. On June 23, 2021,\nBiba99 posted to RaidForums saying he’s willing to buy zero-day vulnerabilities in corporate\n[VPN products. Biba99 posts his unique user ID for Tox, a peer-to-peer instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tox_(protocol))\nservice.\n\nOn July 13, 2021, Payload[.]bin was renamed to RAMP, which according to Orange stands\nfor “Ransom Anon Market Place.” Flashpoint says RAMP was created “directly in response\nto several large Dark Web forums banning ransomware collectives on their site following the\n[Colonial Pipeline attack by ransomware group ‘DarkSide.” [links added]](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=darkside)\n\n“Babuk noted that this new platform will not have rules or ‘bosses,'” Flashpoint observed in a\nreport on the group. “This reaction distinguishes Babuk from other ransomware collectives,\nmany of which changed their rules following the attack to attract less attention from law\nenforcement.”\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Mhl9lImljBE\n\nThe RAMP forum opening was announced by the user “TetyaSluha. That nickname soon\nswitched to “Orange,” who appears to have registered on RAMP with the email address\n“teresacox19963@gmail.com.” Recall that this is the same email address used by the\nspokesperson for the Babuk ransomware gang — Boriselcin/Biba99.\n\nIn a post on RAMP Aug. 18, 2021, in which Orange is attempting to recruit penetration\ntesters, he claimed the same Tox ID that Biba99 used on RaidForums.\n\nOn Aug. 22, Orange announced a new ransomware affiliate program called “Groove,” which\nclaimed to be an aggressive, financially motivated criminal organization dealing in industrial\nespionage for the previous two years.\n\nIn November 2021, Groove’s blog disappeared, and Boriselcin posted a long article to the\nXSS crime forum explaining that Groove was little more than a pet project to mess with the\nmedia and security industries.\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2021, Boriselcin posted to XSS saying he would pay handsomely for a reliable,\nworking exploit for CVE-2021-20028, the same exploit that @fuck_maze would later release\nto Twitter on Jan. 25, 2022.\n\n[Asked for comment on this research, cyber intelligence firm Intel 471 confirmed that its](https://www.intel471.com/)\nanalysts reached the same conclusion.\n\n“We identified the user as the Russian national Михаил Павлович Матвеев aka Mikhail\nPavlovich Matveev, who was widely known in the underground community as the actor using\nthe Wazawaka handle, a.k.a. Alfredpetr, andry1976, arestedByFbi, boriselcin, donaldo,\n\n\n-----\n\nebanatv2, futurama, gotowork, m0sad, m1x, Ment0s, ment0s, Ment0s, Mixalen, mrbotnet,\nOrange, posholnarabotu, popalvprosak, TetyaSluha, uhodiransomwar, and 999,” Intel 471\nwrote.\n\nAs usual, I put together a rough mind map on how all these data points indicate a connection\nbetween Wazawaka, Orange, and Boriselcin.\n\nA mind map connecting Wazawaka to the RAMP forum administrator “Orange” and the founder of the\n\nBabuk ransomware gang.\n\nAs noted in January’s profile, Wazawaka has worked with at least two different ransomware\naffiliate programs, including LockBit. Wazawaka said LockBit had paid him roughly $500,000\nin commissions for the six months leading up to September 2020.\n\nWazawaka also said he’d teamed up with DarkSide, the ransomware affiliate group\nresponsible for the six-day outage at Colonial Pipeline last year that caused nationwide fuel\nshortages and price spikes. The U.S. Department of State has since offered a $5 million\nreward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any DarkSide affiliates.\n\n\n-----",
