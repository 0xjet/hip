The attacks are characterized by the use of the little known open source\nSparkRAT and malware that attempts to evade detection through Golang source code\ninterpretation.\n\nThe DragonSpark attacks represent the first concrete malicious activity where we observe\n[the consistent use of the open source SparkRAT, a relatively new occurrence on the threat](https://github.com/XZB-1248/Spark)\nlandscape. SparkRAT is multi-platform, feature-rich, and frequently updated with new\nfeatures, making the RAT attractive to threat actors.\n\n[The Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team reported in late December 2022 on](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/21/microsoft-research-uncovers-new-zerobot-capabilities/)\nindications of threat actors using SparkRAT. However, we have not observed concrete\nevidence linking DragonSpark to the activity documented in the report by Microsoft.\n\nWe observed that the threat actor behind the DragonSpark attacks uses Golang malware\nthat interprets embedded Golang source code at runtime as a technique for hindering static\nanalysis and evading detection by static analysis mechanisms. This uncommon technique\nprovides threat actors with yet another means to evade detection mechanisms by\nobfuscating malware implementations.\n\n## Intrusion Vector\n\nWe observed compromises of web servers and MySQL database servers exposed to the\nInternet as initial indicators of the DragonSpark attacks. Exposing MySQL servers to the\nInternet is an infrastructure posture flaw that often leads to severe incidents that involve data\nbreaches, credential theft, or lateral movement across networks. At compromised web\n[servers, we observed use of the China Chopper webshell, recognizable by the &echo](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/china-chopper-still-active-9-years-later/)\n```\n[S]&cd&echo [E] sequence in virtual terminal requests. China Chopper is commonly used\n\n```\nby Chinese threat actors, which are known to deploy the webshell through different vectors,\nsuch as exploiting web server vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting, or SQL injections.\n\nAfter gaining access to environments, the threat actor conducted a variety of malicious\nactivities, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and deployment of malware and\ntools hosted at attacker-controlled infrastructure. We observed that the threat actor relies\nheavily on open source tools that are developed by Chinese-speaking developers or Chinese\nvendors. This includes SparkRAT as well as other tools, such as:\n\n[SharpToken: a privilege escalation tool that enables the execution of Windows](https://github.com/BeichenDream/SharpToken)\ncommands with SYSTEM privileges. The tool also features enumerating user and\nprocess information, and adding, deleting, or changing the passwords of system users.\n[BadPotato: a tool similar to SharpToken that elevates user privileges to SYSTEM for](https://github.com/BeichenDream/BadPotato)\n[command execution. The tool has been observed in an attack campaign conducted by](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/operation-harvest-a-deep-dive-into-a-long-term-campaign.html)\na Chinese threat actor with the goal of acquiring intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\n[GotoHTTP: a cross-platform remote access tool that implements a wide array of](https://gotohttp.com/)\nfeatures, such as establishing persistence, file transfer, and screen view.\n\nIn addition to the tools above, the threat actor used two custom-built malware for executing\nmalicious code: ShellCode_Loader, implemented in Python and delivered as a PyInstaller\npackage, and m6699.exe, implemented in Golang.\n\n## SparkRAT\n\n[SparkRAT is a RAT developed in Golang and released as open source software by the](https://github.com/XZB-1248/Spark)\n[Chinese-speaking developer XZB-1248. SparkRAT is a feature-rich and multi-platform tool](https://github.com/XZB-1248)\nthat supports the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.\n\nSparkRAT uses the WebSocket protocol to communicate with the C2 server and features an\nupgrade system. This enables the RAT to automatically upgrade itself to the latest version\navailable on the C2 server upon startup by issuing an upgrade request. This is an HTTP\nPOST request, with the commit query parameter storing the current version of the tool.\n\nA SparkRAT upgrade request\nIn the attacks we observed, the version of SparkRAT was\n```\n6920f726d74efb7836a03d3acfc0f23af196765e, built on 1 November 2022 UTC. This\n\n```\nversion supports 26 commands that implement a wide range of functionalities:\n\nCommand execution: including execution of arbitrary Windows system and PowerShell\ncommands.\nSystem manipulation: including system shutdown, restart, hibernation, and suspension.\nFile and process manipulation: including process termination as well as file upload,\ndownload, and deletion.\nInformation theft: including exfiltration of platform information (CPU, network, memory,\ndisk, and system uptime information), screenshot theft, and process and file\nenumeration.\n\n\n-----\n\nSparkRAT version\n\n## Golang Source Code Interpretation For Evading Detection\n\n[The Golang malware m6699.exe uses the Yaegi framework to interpret at runtime encoded](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi)\nGolang source code stored within the compiled binary, executing the code as if compiled.\nThis is a technique for hindering static analysis and evading detection by static analysis\nmechanisms.\n\nThe main purpose of m6699.exe is to execute a first-stage shellcode that implements a\nloader for a second-stage shellcode.\n\nm6699.exe first decodes a Base-64 encoded string. This string is Golang source code that\nconducts the following activities:\n\nDeclares a Main function as part of a Run package. The run.Main function takes as a\nparameter a byte array – the first-stage shellcode.\n[The run.Main function invokes the HeapCreate function to allocate executable and](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapcreate)\ngrowable heap memory (HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE).\nThe run.Main function places the first-stage shellcode, supplied to it as a parameter\nwhen invoked, in the allocated memory and executes it.\n\n\n-----\n\nGolang source code in m6699.exe\nm6699.exe then evaluates the source code in the context of the Yaegi interpreter and uses\nGolang [reflection to execute the run.Main function. m6699.exe passes as a parameter to](https://go.dev/blog/laws-of-reflection)\n```\nrun.Main the first-stage shellcode, which the function executes as previously described.\n\n```\nm6699.exe stores the shellcode as a double Base64-encoded string, which the malware\ndecodes before passing to run.Main for execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first\nstage shellcode that run.Main executes in double Base64-encoded and decoded form\nThe first-stage shellcode implements a shellcode loader. The shellcode connects to a C2\n[server using the Windows Sockets 2 library and receives a 4-byte big value. This value is the](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_winsock/)\nsize of a second-stage shellcode for which the first-stage shellcode allocates memory of the\nreceived size. The first-stage shellcode then receives from the C2 server the second-stage\nshellcode and executes it.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen m6699.exe executes, the threat actor can establish a Meterpreter session for remote\ncommand execution.\n\nA\n\nMeterpreter session with an m6699.exe instance (in a lab environment)\n\n## ShellCode_Loader\n\nShellCode_Loader is the internal name of a PyInstaller-packaged malware that is\nimplemented in Python. ShellCode_Loader serves as the loader of a shellcode that\nimplements a reverse shell.\n\nShellCode_Loader uses encoding and encryption to hinder static analysis. The malware first\nBase-64 decodes and then decrypts the shellcode. ShellCode_Loader uses the AES CBC\nencryption algorithm, and Base-64 encoded AES key and initialization vector for the\ndecryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nShellCode_Loader decodes and decrypts shellcode\n[ShellCode_Loader uses the Python ctypes library for accessing the Windows API to load the](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)\nshellcode in memory and start a new thread that executes the shellcode. The Python code\nthat conducts these activities is Base-64 encoded in an attempt to evade static analysis\nmechanisms that alert on the use of Windows API for malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nShellCode_Loader executes shellcode\n[The shellcode creates a thread and connects to a C2 server using the Windows Sockets 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_winsock/)\nlibrary. When the shellcode executes, the threat actor can establish a Meterpreter session for\nremote command execution.\n\nA\n\nMeterpreter session with a ShellCode_Loader instance (in a lab environment)\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe DragonSpark attacks leveraged infrastructure located in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and\nSingapore to stage SparkRAT and other tools and malware. The C2 servers were located in\nHong Kong and the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware staging infrastructure includes compromised infrastructure of legitimate\nTaiwanese organizations and businesses, such as a baby product retailer, an art gallery, and\ngames and gambling websites. We also observed an Amazon Cloud EC2 instance as part of\nthis infrastructure.\n\nThe tables below provide an overview of the infrastructure used in the DragonSpark attacks.\n\n### Malware staging infrastructure\n\n**IP address/Domain** **Country** **Notes**\n\n211.149.237[.]108 China A compromised server hosting web content\nrelated to gambling.\n\n\n43.129.227[.]159 Hong\nKong\n\n\nA Windows Server 2012 R2 instance with a\ncomputer name of 172_19_0_3. The threat\nactors may have obtained access to this\nserver using a shared or bought account. We\nobserved login credentials with the server’s\nname being shared over different time periods\nin the Telegram channels King of VP$ and\n```\nSellerVPS for sharing and/or selling access to\n\n```\nvirtual private servers.\n\n\nwww[.]bingoplanet[.]com[.]tw Taiwan A compromised server hosting web content\nrelated to gambling. The website resources\nhave been removed at the time of writing.

We observed login\ncredentials with the server’s name being shared over\ndifferent time periods in the Telegram channels Premium\n```\nAcc, IRANHACKERS, and !Only For Voters for sharing\n\n```\nand/or selling access to virtual private servers.\n\nThis set of infrastructure was observed resolving to\n```\njiance.ittoken[.]xyz at the time of writing. This specific\n\n```\ndomain can be linked to a wider set of Chinese phishing\ninfrastructure over the past few years. It is unclear if they\nare related to this same actor.\n\nA Windows Server 2012 R2 instance with a computer\nname of WIN-CLC0OFDKTMK.\n\nThe most recent passive DNS record related to this IP\naddress points to a domain name with a Chinese TLD –\n```\nkanmn[.]cn. However, this is shared hosting infrastructure\n\n```\nthrough Aquanx and likely used by a variety of customers.\n\nThis IP address is known to have hosted a Cobalt Strike\nC2 server and been involved in other malicious activities,\nsuch as hosting known malware samples.\n\n\nWe assess it is highly likely that a Chinese-speaking threat actor is behind the DragonSpark\nattacks. We are unable at this point to link DragonSpark to a specific threat actor due to lack\nof reliable actor-specific indicators.\n\nThe actor may have espionage or cybercrime motivations. In September 2022, a few weeks\nbefore we first spotted DragonSpark indicators, a sample of Zegost malware\n[(bdf792c8250191bd2f5c167c8dbea5f7a63fa3b4) – an info-stealer historically attributed to](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1233a3d7bb4cfc8b9783a6bde15edfd8f5274acb7666e14f75ed5348cf7699e9/relations)\n[Chinese cybercriminals, but also observed as part of espionage campaigns – was reported](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/zegost-campaign-targets-internal-interests)\ncommunicating with 104.233.163[.]190. We observed this same C2 IP address as part of\n[the DragonSpark attacks. Previous research by the Weibu Intelligence Agency (微步情报局)](https://www.ctfiot.com/41387.html)\nreported that Chinese cybercrime actor FinGhost was using Zegost, including a variant of the\nsample mentioned above.\n\nIn addition, the threat actor behind DragonSpark used the China Chopper webshell to deploy\nmalware. China Chopper has historically been consistently used by Chinese cybercriminals\n[and espionage groups, such as the TG-3390 and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage) [Leviathan. Further, all of the open source](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries)\ntools used by the threat actor conducting DragonSpark attacks are developed by Chinese[speaking developers or Chinese vendors. This includes SparkRAT by](https://github.com/XZB-1248/Spark) [XZB-1248,](https://github.com/XZB-1248)\n[SharpToken and](https://github.com/BeichenDream/SharpToken) [BadPotato by](https://github.com/BeichenDream/BadPotato) [BeichenDream, and](https://github.com/BeichenDream/) [GotoHTTP by Pingbo Inc.](https://gotohttp.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the malware staging infrastructure is located exclusively in East Asia (Taiwan, Hong\nKong, China, and Singapore), behavior which is common amongst Chinese-speaking threat\nactors targeting victims in the region. This evidence is consistent with our assessment that\nthe DragonSpark attacks are highly likely orchestrated by a Chinese-speaking threat actor.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n[Chinese-speaking threat actors are known to frequently use open source software in](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-158a)\nmalicious campaigns. The little known SparkRAT that we observed in the DragonSpark\nattacks is among the newest additions to the toolset of these actors.\n\nSince SparkRAT is a multi-platform and feature-rich tool, and is regularly updated with new\nfeatures, we estimate that the RAT will remain attractive to cybercriminals and other threat\nactors in the future.\n\nIn addition, threat actors will almost certainly continue exploring techniques and\nspecificalities of execution environments for evading detection and obfuscating malware,\nsuch as Golang source code interpretation that we document in this article.\n\nSentinelLabs continues to monitor the DragonSpark cluster of activities and hopes that\ndefenders will leverage the findings presented in this article to bolster their defenses.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Description** **Indicator**\n\n\nShellCode_Loader (a PyInstaller\npackage)\n\n\n83130d95220bc2ede8645ea1ca4ce9afc4593196\n\n\nm6699.exe 14ebbed449ccedac3610618b5265ff803243313d\n\nSparkRAT 2578efc12941ff481172dd4603b536a3bd322691\n\n\nC2 server network endpoint for\nShellCode_Loader\n\nC2 server network endpoint for\nSparkRAT\n\nC2 server network endpoint for\nm6699.exe\n\nC2 server IP address for China\nChopper\n\n\n103.96.74[.]148:8899\n\n103.96.74[.]148[:]6688\n\n103.96.74[.]148:6699\n\n104.233.163[.]190\n\n\nStaging URL for ShellCode_Loader hxxp://211.149.237[.]108:801/py.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nStaging URL for m6699.exe hxxp://211.149.237[.]108:801/m6699.exe\n\nStaging URL for SparkRAT hxxp://43.129.227[.]159:81/c.exe\n\nStaging URL for GotoHTTP hxxp://13.213.41.125:9001/go.exe\n\nStaging URL for ShellCode_Loader hxxp://www.bingoplanet[.]com[.]tw/images/py.exe\n\nStaging URL for ShellCode_Loader hxxps://www.moongallery.com[.]tw/upload/py.exe\n\nStaging URL for ShellCode_Loader hxxp://www.holybaby.com[.]tw/api/ms.exe\n\n\n-----",
