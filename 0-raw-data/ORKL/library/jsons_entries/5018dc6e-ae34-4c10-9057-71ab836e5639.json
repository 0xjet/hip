The messages came from fake Facebook profiles\nbelonging to attractive, but fictitious women. These women encouraged him to download\nanother chat application to continue their conversations. The chat application the women\nreferred him to was spyware, disguised as the Kik Messenger app, distributed through a very\nconvincing fake site.\n\nAfter analyzing the fake Kik Messenger app, we spotted the spyware, or Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT). We are calling the APT “Tempting Cedar Spyware”. We dug deeper\ninto our archives and found APKs belonging to several fake messenger and feed reader\napps, all of which included the same malicious modules.\n\nDuring our analysis, we also discovered that our customer was not the only person to\nencounter the Tempting Cedar Spyware, and, unfortunately, many fell for the trap.\n\n\n-----\n\nTempting Cedar Spyware was designed to steal information like contacts, call logs, SMS,\nand photos, as well as device information, like geolocation - in order to keep track of\nmovements - and was capable of recording surrounding sounds, including conversations\nvictims had while their phone was within range.\n\nBased on various clues from the fake Facebook profiles and the campaign infrastructure, we\nbelieve the people behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware are Lebanese. The campaign was\nhighly targeted and ran deep under the radar. At the moment, Avast is one of few mobile\nantivirus providers detecting the threat. Our detection is Android:SpyAgent-YP [Trj].\n\nDue to the potential impact on the victims targeted with the malware, we contacted law\nenforcement agencies to help us with threat mitigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection vector\n\n More than just Facebook friends\n\nThe malware was distributed using several fake Facebook profiles. After engaging in flirty\nconversations with their victims, which were most likely young men, the attackers offered to\nmove the conversation from Facebook to a more “secure and private” platform, where they\ncould have more intimate interactions. Then, the attackers sent a link to the victims, that led\nto a phishing website, which hosted a downloadable and malicious version of the Kik\nMessenger app. The victims had to adjust their device settings to install apps from unknown\nsources, before installing the fake messaging app. This should raise red flags for users,\nhowever, sometimes temptation trumps security.\n\nOnce the malware was installed, it immediately connected to a command and control (C&C)\nserver.\n\nThe spyware was spread using at least the following three fake Facebook profiles. We have\nblurred the photos, as the photos used for the fake accounts were stolen from real people:\n\n## Alona\n\n\n-----\n\n## Rita\n\n\n-----\n\n## Christina\n\n\n-----\n\nOne interesting point to note is that the three girls interacted with one another on Facebook,\nperhaps to make their profiles appear a bit more credible:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Above: A screenshot of how the attackers convinced their victims to install the fake Kik_\n_Messenger application._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe website used to distribute a malicious copy of the Kik Messenger app, chat**messenger.site (185.8.237.151), operated until spring 2017 and was a very convincing**\ncopycat.\n\n## Deep analysis\n\nThe Tempting Cedar Spyware is split into different modules with specific commands. There\nare several modules designed to gather personal information about the victim, including\ncontacts, photos, call logs, SMS, as well as information about the mobile device, such as\ngeolocation, Android version, device model, network operator, and phone numbers.\n\nOther modules were created to record audio streams or gain access to the infected device’s\nfile system.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll modules with commands:\n\n\n**Module**\n**name**\n\n\n**Commands**\n\n\nAUDIO START, STOP, RECORD_START, RECORD_STOP\n\nCONTACTS COUNT, GET\n\n\nFS (File\n_System)_\n\n\nAPP, CD, DOWNLOAD, DOWNLOAD_STATUS, EXTERNAL, GET,\nINSTALL, INTERNAL, LS, MKDIR, PWD, RM\n\n\nGEO GETLOC\n\n\nINFO /\nUSER_INFO\n\n\nPS (running apps process list)\n\n\nPHOTOS LSX, GETX, LSI, GETI, TAKEPIC_FRONT, TAKEPIC_BACK\n\nTELEPHONE COUNT_CALL_LOGS, COUNT_SMS, GET_CALL_LOGS, GET_SMS\n\nKEEPALIVE _without commands_\n\nPING _not implemented_\n\nVIDEO _not implemented_\n\nThe spyware persisted as a service and ran after every reboot.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fake Kik application contains the same injected malicious class eighty9.guru and a\nspecific rsdroid.crt file with different certificates belonging to the C&C domain.\n\nThrough the reuse of the same rsdroid.crt certificate name, we were able to find additional\nC&C and data exfiltration servers.\n\nAll rsdroid.crt certificates from the fake APK:\n\n**Issued to** **Valid from** **Valid to** **Serial number**\n\ngserv.mobi 2015-04-28 2020-04-01 00fe4b81ee781fe486\n\nnetwork-lab.info 2016-03-29 2026-03-27 0090400fbd572edcc6\n\nonlineclub.info 2017-05-24 2027-05-22 00e7238783cc4e87de\n\nfree-apps.us 2017-08-24 2035-11-08 00b6965aa72d97446d\n\n## C&C administration and infrastructure\n\n Following their victims’ every step\n\nThe malware communicated on the TCP port 2020, but it is also worth mentioning that there\nwas also a C&C console running on port 443 with a familiar certificate subject common name\n\n- rsdroid.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C console allowed attackers to live track their victims. The image below does not\ninclude any data, as we don’t want to disclose any of the victims’ locations, but shows the\nregion where Tempting Cedar was spread the most:\n\nOther hosts with this common name are easy to find using open source tools:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Above: Open source data about the C&C server hosts_\n\nWe created an image of the computer infrastructure used in the campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n## All signs point to Lebanon\n\nIt is always difficult to attribute persistent threat campaigns, like this one, to cybercriminals.\nHowever, pieces of information point to the cybercriminals behind this campaign being\nLebanese.\n\nThe first clue that led us to this conclusion are the attackers’ working hours. We only saw\nabout 30 logins in the SSH log we received. The user root logged on on workdays,\noccasionally on Saturdays, but never on Sundays.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe working hours in the SSH log correspond with Eastern European and Middle Eastern\ntime zones.\n\nThe second breadcrumb we found was the infrastructure used in the campaign, which also\npoints to Lebanon.\n\nWHOIS data revealed that two domains used were registered by someone from Lebanon,\nwhereas others were registered with fictitious registrant data.\n\n**Chat-world.site was registered by Jack Zogby, Beirut, Lebanon,** [jack.zogby@yandex.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:jack.zogby@yandex.com)\n\n**Network-lab.info was registered by Jack Halawani, Beirut, Lebanon,**\n[jack.halawani@yandex.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:jack.halawani@yandex.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nOver the last two years, SSH logins were made from Lebanese ISPs IP ranges. (\n185.99.32.0/22, 78.40.183.0/24)\n\nOne of the fake Facebook profile’s likes are also interesting, and if any of the victims had\ntaken a closer look at these, they may not have fallen for the scam. Rita, the petite brunette,\nseems to be interested in military groups, and a Lebanese and Israel friendship.\n\n_Above: Rita’s likes on Facebook_\n\nThe Lebanon & Israel Friendship connection group is interesting when considering the the\nvictims’ locations.\n\nWhile we observed a low number of victims from the USA, France, Germany, and China, the\nmajority of victims were from the Middle East, with most of the victims located in Israel:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Above: Map showing the countries most of the victims came from_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe targeted Tempting Cedar campaign has been running under the radar since as far back\nas 2015, targeting people in Middle Eastern countries. The spyware’s infection vector\ninvolves social engineering using attractive, but fictitious Facebook profiles. The fake Kik\nAPK sent to victims is masqueraded as a legitimate Kik Messenger app, however, after\ngaining access to victims’ phones, the spyware starts to exfiltrate sensitive data, sending\ndata back to the attacker’s infrastructure. Evidence points to the attackers being a Lebanese\nhacking group; however, we cannot be 100% sure this is true. The social engineering part of\nthe campaign seems to have targeted people in Eastern European and Middle Eastern\ncountries.\n\nDespite unsophisticated techniques and the level of operational security being used, the\nattack managed to remain undetected for several years.\n\nThe cybercriminals behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware were able to install a persistent\npiece of spyware by exploiting social media, like Facebook, and people’s lack of security\nawareness, and were thus able to gather sensitive and private data from their victims’\nphones including real-time location data which makes the malware exceptionally dangerous.\n\n## Steps to take to protect yourself against spyware\n\nHere are a few things you can do to avoid being manipulated like this into downloading\nspyware:\n\n**Use antivirus software. Even if you accidentally download malware onto your phone,**\nAvast will detect and remove the malware, to keep your data and privacy safe.\n**Don’t talk to strangers. There is a reason why parents have been warning kids about**\ntalking to strangers and this case confirms that talking to strangers online is no different\nand is not a good idea.\n**Never open links or download software sent to you from untrusted sources. The**\nvictims of this spyware campaign were tricked into downloading the spyware\nthemselves because they trusted the girls they were talking to online, despite never\nmeeting them in person. On top of this, they ignored Android’s warnings about\ndownloading apps from unknown sources.\n**Download from the source. Whenever possible, visit the homepage of an established**\ncompany directly - by typing in the URL yourself - as they often promote their mobile\napps on their websites and download the app straight from the source. Had the victims\ndone this, they would have avoided the fake and malicious Kik app. The “girls” probably\nwould have stopped talking to them, but that would have been for their own good!\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Kik messenger SHA256:**\n\n041136252FFEF074B0DEBA167BD12B8977E276BAC90195B7112260AB31DDB810\n\n2807AB1A912FF0751D5B7C7584D3D38ACC5C46AFFE2F168EEAEE70358DC90006\n\n3065AD0932B1011E57961104EB96EEE241261CB26B9252B0770D05320839915F\n\n5259AD04BDEA3F41B3913AA09998DB49553CE529E29C868C48DF40D5AA7157EA\n\n624A196B935427A82E8060876480E30CE6867CB9604107A44F85E2DA96A7A22E\n\n9D1FDA875DE75DEA545D1FF84973B230412B8B4946D64FF900E9D22B065F8DCC\n\nB181F418F6C8C79F28B1E9179CAEFEB81BDF77315814F831AF0CF0C2507860C4\n\nD7A4ABA5FC2DEE270AE84EAC1DB98B7A352FB5F04FD07C3F9E69DE6E58B4C745\n\nF67469C82E948628761FDFD26177884384481BA4BDBC15A53E8DF92D3F216648\n\nFE2996BC0C47C0626F43395EEE445D12E7C024C1B0AA2358947B5F1D839A5868\n\n**Fake Datasettings SHA256:**\n\n1DEB727C05AA5FABF6224C0881970ACA78649A799EEB6864260DE97635FA005A\n\n94ADF4C8A27722307C11F6C0376D4A51CFD56BA3CC47F9E5447179D1E0F7289F\n\nA411A587B4256007F0E0A3C3A3C3097062242B5359A05A986195E76DA7334B7D\n\n**Fake feedreader SHA256:**\n\n\n-----\n\n58F74545D47F5DA1ECF3093F412D7D9544A33D36430AB1AF709D835A59184611\n\n**Domains:**\n\nchat-world.site\n\nchat-messenger.site\n\ngserv.mobi\n\narab-chat.site\n\nonlineclub.info\n\nfree-apps.us\n\nnetwork-lab.info\n\nkikstore.net\n\n**IPs (including historic records):**\n\n185.166.236.134\n\n46.28.109.69\n\n5.135.207.244\n\n31.31.75.174\n\n155.94.136.10\n\n213.32.65.238\n\n84.200.17.154\n\n185.8.237.151\n\n213.32.65.238\n\n5.45.176.236\n\n\n-----\n\n46.101.199.72\n\n185.99.32.0/22\n\n78.40.183.0/24\n\n**Rsdroid certificate serial numbers:**\n\n10418450096179084191\n\n11696648495248868788\n\n13367542350555075590\n\n17798583036840002648\n\n17362149250016288818\n\n11008990750836915855\n\n12430448762037889566\n\n12941986373589998425\n\n14237693369114233902\n\n15175240657458101230\n\n18263349974554467657\n\n10031168301806868687\n\n12450086912549212859\n\n13469158752397659430\n\n13887786183890428647\n\n15448206077875179259\n\n15525317917180712785\n\n16639512314094306104\n\n10671561344391424094\n\n14360088739535268901\n\n16495367076336282102\n\n\n-----\n\n15684750702817909758\n\n17908820252718507450\n\n10302454590553748328\n\n**Fake FB profiles:**\n\nfacebook.com/profile.php?id=100013563997788\n\nfacebook.com/profile.php?id=100011377795504\n\nfacebook.com/profile.php?id=100011891805784\n\n\n-----",
