In the Korean media, it was mentioned that there](http://www.boannews.com/media/view.asp?idx=67660)\ncould be a link between this Android malware and Group 123. Talos decided to investigate\nthis malware. And due to our reporting and history of following of Group 123, we discovered\nsome interesting elements.\n\nTalos identified two variants of the Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT). Both samples\nhave the same capabilities — namely to steal information on the compromised device (such\nas contacts, SMS and phone history) and record the victim's phone calls. One variant uses a\nknown Android exploit (CVE-2015-3636) in order to get root access on the compromised\nAndroid device. The data of both variants was sent using an HTTP POST to a unique\ncommand and control (C2) server. The ability to record calls was implemented based on an\nopen-source project available on GitHub. We named this malware \"KevDroid.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother RAT (this time targeting Windows) was identified hosted on the command and\ncontrol server in use by KevDroid. This malware specifically uses the PubNub platform as its\nC2 server. PubNub is a global data stream network (DSN). The attackers use the PubNub\nAPI in order to publish orders to the compromised systems. This behaviour explains why we\nnamed it \"PubNubRAT.\"\n\nAt this time, we cannot identify a link between these samples and the Group 123 sample. We\nonly identified a bundle of tactics, techniques and procedural elements that were too weak to\nidentify a real link.\n\n## Android Malware: KevDroid\n\n### Variant 1\n\nThe first variant of KevDroid is the smaller sample, and is similar to the sample described by\nEST Security. We chose to call it KevDroid due to the Android author tag reading as \"Kevin,\"\nand with some other artifacts referencing the name \"Kevin.\" It is based on the aykuttasil\nproject. The purpose of this project it to provide a library to record phone calls made on\nAndroid devices. The attacker kept the original name in the malware:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe purpose of the application is to steal information stored on the device. Here is the list of\nstolen information:\n\nInstalled applications\nPhone number\nPhone Unique ID\nLocation (the application tries to switch on the GPS), this information is collected every\n10 seconds, which is aggressive for this kind of spying tool\nStored contacts information (name, phone numbers, emails, photos, etc.)\nStored SMS\nCall logs\nStored emails\nPhotos\nRecording calls\n\nIf an adversary were successful in obtaining some of the information KevDroid is capable of\ncollecting, it could result in a multitude of issues for the victim. The social aspect of a mobile\ndevice results in a large amount of data residing on the device. This can be sensitive data,\nsuch as photographs, passwords, banking information or social engineering. This could\nresult in the leakage of data, which could lead to a number of things, such as the kidnapping\nof a loved one, blackmail by using images or information deemed secret, credential\nharvesting, multi-factor token access (SMS MFA), banking/financial implications and access\nto privileged information, perhaps via emails/texts. Many users access their corporate email\nvia mobile devices. This could result in cyber espionage being a potential outcome for\nKevDroid.\n\nThe APK sample was identified at the following URL during March 2018:\n\nhxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/1.apk\n\nThe stealer exfiltrates data on the same server at the following URL:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe APK package was named \"Update,\" and the installation icon is the Droid logo:\n\n### Variant 2\n\nThe second variant of KevDroid is larger than the previous sample we discovered, and was\nlocated in the same URL in February 2018. This sample was named \"PU,\" and the icon logo\nwas empty. The architecture of the malware is a little bit different than the previous version.\nFor example, this variant uses SQLite databases to store data.\n\nThe variant contains the same features than the previous version with some additional:\n\nCamera recording\nAudio recording\nWeb history stealing\nFile stealing\nRoot access on the device\n\nThe last feature is performed by an ELF file embedded in the APK. The file is named \"POC\"\nand supports 32-bit versions of operating systems. It attempts to exploit the device using\n[CVE-2015-3636 with the code available on GitHub. The purpose is to obtain the root](https://github.com/a7vinx/CVE-2015-3636)\npermission on the compromised device. By obtaining root permissions on the device, the\nmalware has effectively obtained higher privileges, allowing it to perform more in-depth\n\n\n-----\n\nactions (such as getting files from other applications). This is a common technique that\nmalware often uses to ensure it can run without user interaction or a prompt, and is used to\nremain stealthy.\n\nThe C2 server is the same as previously mentioned:\n\n## Windows Malware: PubNubRAT\n\n### Malware Samples\n\nWe discovered a Windows binary on the server at the following URL:\n\nhxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/hr.doc\n\nThe purpose of this binary is to download additional files:\n\nhxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/Ant_4.5.exe\nhxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/Ant_3.5.exe\nhxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/desktops.ini\n\nWe found an additional sample that downloads the same files on our original server:\n\nhxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/1211me/Ant_4.5.exe\nhxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/1211me/Ant_3.5.exe\nhxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/1211me/desktops.ini\n\nThe downloaded executables are RATs developed in .NET, and the desktops.ini file is the\nconfiguration file (XOR'd with key 0x17). The malware uses a public service as C2 servers. It\nalso uses PubNub. Here is the decoded configuration containing the token of the attacker\nand the URL:\n```\nps.pndsn.com\nProcess\nsub-c-2199cb5c-f20a-11e7-acf8-26f7716e5467\npub-c-cdb76f31-abb8-4c47-aed3-d8c1de7bf5e6\nsec-c-ZjM3MTY1ZWMtNjg4OS00MzJjLTlkZjgtZGQzN2EzOGI4MDU1\ncip-c-Awwqe1wwas12312w\n9919\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers use the PubNub API in order to send orders to the infected systems. Here is\nthe commands list:\n\nThe malware is able to steal files, download files, execute commands, kill processes and\ncreate screenshots (stored in the tmp0120.ini file).\n\nUsing legitimate services is always challenging for defenders. It's hard to identify malicious\ncommunications hidden in legitimate network flows (especially if the requests use encryption\nvia HTTPS).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can notice some fun content within the PubNubRAT sample:\n\nHaizi means child in Chinese. This string obviously did not mean that the malware was\ndeveloped by Chinese author. However, it's a message sent to the analyst. As we mentioned\n[during our Olympic Destroyer post, false flags can be used by attackers to manipulate](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/who-wasnt-responsible-for-olympic.html)\nanalysts. This kind of single string can be this kind of flag.\n\n### Infection Vector: Bitcoin & China\n\nThe first executable was downloaded and executed from a RTF document named bitcointrans.doc:\n\nThe RTF document contains an embedded Microsoft Equation object. This object exploits\nthe vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 in order to download and execute the hr.doc file mentioned\npreviously.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document is written in Korean. It describes the quantity of Bitcoin owned by China and\nexplains how China handles Bitcoin. It mentions the current status of Bitcoin transactions\nand some insights on the value of Bitcoin.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOriginally, Talos took the time to investigate this malware due to its potential link to Group\n123. As discovered, we do not have a strong link between the two malware samples and\nGroup 123. The TTP overlaps are tenuous — using public cloud infrastructure as a C2\nserver is something other malware has used before as a technique, not just Group 123.\nAdditionally, the C2 server is hosted in Korea, and this malware has been known to target\nKorean users. However, this information cannot lead us to a strong link. In light of this, we\ndid discover some new Android-based malware and some Windows-based malware\nattempting to steal information and control infected systems. These samples are not\ndocumented and not massively used, but we hope than this post will highlight campaigns\nperformed by this actor.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Network Security appliances such asNGFW,NGIPS, andMeraki MX can detect malicious](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html)\nactivity associated with this threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\nOpen Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the\n[latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.](https://www.snort.org/products)\n\n## IOCs\n\nKevDroid:\n\nURL: hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/1.apk\n\nVariant 1: f33aedfe5ebc918f5489e1f8a9fe19b160f112726e7ac2687e429695723bca6a\n\nVariant 2: c015292aab1d41acd0674c98cd8e91379c1a645c31da24f8d017722d9b942235\n\nC2: hxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/pu/pu.php\n\nPubNubRAT:\n\nURL:\n\nhxxp://cgalim[.]com/admin/hr/hr.doc\n\nhxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/Ant_4.5.exe\n\nhxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/Ant_3.5.exe\n\nhxxp://ebsmpi[.]com/ipin/360/desktops.ini\n\nSample:\n\ndd3f5ad44a80e7872e826869d270cbd5c0dc4efafff6c958bd1350ce1db973eb: hr.doc\n\n7a82cc0330e8974545d5a8cdca95b8d87250224aabc6a4f75a08dddaebb79670: hr.doc\n\n90abfe3e4f21b5a16cd1ff3c485f079f73f5e7bbaca816917204858bb08007fc: Ant_4.5.exe\n\nd24d1b667829db9871080b97516dbe2e93ffaa3ac6fb0a4050a7616016c10d32: Ant_3.5.exe\n86887ce368d9a3e7fdf9aa62418cd68daeea62269d17afb059ab64201047e378:Servlet.exe\n(hr.doc variant)\n\n9ff7240c77fca939cde0eb1ffe7f6425c4dcfde2cdd1027dde6d07386c17f878: Ant_3.5.exe\n\n4cb16189f52a428a49916a8b533fdebf0fe95970b4066ce235777d3e95bff95b:\n360TS_Setup_Mini.exe\n\nRTF: 6b1f2dfe805fa0e27139c5a4840042599262dbbf4511a118d3fba3d4ec35f2d7\n\n\n-----",
