See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 7](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/enterprise/)_ _for all_\n_referenced threat actor tactics and techniques._\n\nThis joint cybersecurity advisory was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber\nNational Mission Force (CNMF). This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures\n[(TTPs) used by North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group Kimsuky—against worldwide](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\ntargets—to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the North Korean government. The U.S.\nGovernment refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.\n[For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea)\n\nThis advisory describes known Kimsuky TTPs, as found in open-source and intelligence reporting\nthrough July 2020. The target audience for this advisory is commercial sector businesses desiring to\nprotect their networks from North Korean APT activity.\n\n##### Key Findings\n\nThis advisory’s key findings are:\n\n  - The Kimsuky APT group has most likely been operating since 2012.\n\n  - Kimsuky is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering\nmission.\n\n  - Kimsuky employs common social engineering tactics, spearphishing, and watering hole\nattacks to exfiltrate desired information from victims.[1,2]\n\n  - Kimsuky is most likely to use spearphishing to gain initial access into victim hosts or\nnetworks.[3]\n\n  - Kimsuky conducts its intelligence collection activities against individuals and organizations in\nSouth Korea, Japan, and the United States.\n\n  - Kimsuky focuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security\nissues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.\n\n  - Kimsuky specifically targets:\n```\n     o Individuals identified as experts in various fields, \n\n```\n1 Netscout: Stolen Pencil Campaign Targets Academia\n[https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\n2 CYWARE Social: Babyshark malware continues to target nuclear and cryptocurrency industries\n[https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\n3 CYWARE Social: Babyshark malware continues to target nuclear and cryptocurrency industries\n[https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\nPage 2 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n```\n     o Think tanks, and \n     o South Korean government entities.[4,5,6,7,8]\n\n```\n  - CISA, FBI, and CNMF recommend individuals and organizations within this target profile\nincrease their defenses and adopt a heightened state of awareness. Particularly important\nmitigations include safeguards against spearphishing, use of multi-factor authentication, and\nuser awareness training.\n\n#### TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n##### Initial Access\n\nKimsuky uses various spearphishing and social engineering methods to obtain Initial Access\n\n[[TA0001] to victim networks.[9,10,11] Spearphishing—with a malicious attachment embedded in the](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)\n[email—is the most observed Kimsuky tactic (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]).[12,13]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001)\n\n  - The APT group has used web hosting credentials—stolen from victims outside of their usual\ntargets—to host their malicious scripts and tools. Kimsuky likely obtained the credentials from\nthe victims via spearphishing and credential harvesting scripts. On the victim domains, they\nhave created subdomains mimicking legitimate sites and services they are spoofing, such as\nGoogle or Yahoo mail.[14]\n\n  - Kimsuky has also sent benign emails to targets, which were possibly intended to build trust in\nadvance of a follow-on email with a malicious attachment or link.\n```\n     o Posing as South Korean reporters, Kimsuky exchanged several benign interview\n```\nthemed emails with their intended target to ostensibly arrange an interview date and\n\n4 Netscout: Stolen Pencil Campaign Targets Academia\n[https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\n5 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n6 Securityweek.com: North Korean Suspected Cyber-espionage Attacks Against South Korea Entities\n[https://www.securityweek.com/north-korea-suspected-cyber-espionage-attacks-against-south-korean-entities](https://www.securityweek.com/north-korea-suspected-cyber-espionage-attacks-against-south-korean-entities)\n\n7 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n8 CrowdStrike: 2020 Global Threat Report\n[https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf)\n\n9 Malwarebytes: APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure\n[https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-coronavirus-as-a-lure/)\n[coronavirus-as-a-lure/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-coronavirus-as-a-lure/)\n\n10 PwC: Tracking ‘Kimsuky’, the North Korea-based cyber espionage group: Part 2\n[https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/tracking-kimsuky-north-korea-based-cyber-espionage-group-](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/tracking-kimsuky-north-korea-based-cyber-espionage-group-part-2.html)\n[part-2.html](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/tracking-kimsuky-north-korea-based-cyber-espionage-group-part-2.html)\n\n11 CrowdStrike: 2020 Global Threat Report\n[https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf)\n\n12 Netscout: Stolen Pencil Campaign Targets Academia\n[https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\n13 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n14 Private Sector Partner.\n\nPage 3 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n\npossibly build rapport. The emails contained the subject line “Skype Interview requests\nof [Redacted TV Show] in Seoul,” and began with a request to have the recipient\nappear as a guest on the show. The APT group invited the targets to a Skype interview\non the topic of inter-Korean issues and denuclearization negotiations on the Korean\nPeninsula.\n```\n     o After a recipient agreed to an interview, Kimsuky sent a subsequent email with a\n\n```\nmalicious document, either as an attachment or as a Google Drive link within the body.\nThe document usually contained a variant of BabyShark malware (see the Execution\nsection for information on BabyShark). When the date of the interview drew near,\nKimsuky sent an email canceling the interview.\n\n  - Kimsuky tailors its spearphishing and social engineering approaches to use topics relevant to\nthe target, such as COVID-19, the North Korean nuclear program, or media interviews.[15,16,17]\n\nKimsuky’s other methods for obtaining initial access include login-security-alert-themed phishing\nemails, watering hole attacks, distributing malware through torrent sharing sites, and directing victims\n[to install malicious browser extensions (Phishing: Spearphising Link [T1566.002], Drive-by](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/)\n_[Compromise [T1189], Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]).[18]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1189/)_\n\n##### Execution \n\n[After obtaining initial access, Kimsuky uses BabyShark](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0414/) malware and PowerShell or the Windows\n[Command Shell for Execution [TA0002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0002/)\n\n  - BabyShark is Visual Basic Script (VBS)-based malware.\n```\n     o First, the compromised host system uses the native Microsoft Windows utility,\n       mshta.exe, to download and execute an HTML application (HTA) file from a remote\n\n```\n[system (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta [T1218.005]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1218/005/)\n```\n     o The HTA file then downloads, decodes, and executes the encoded BabyShark VBS\n\n```\nfile.\n```\n     o The script maintains Persistence [TA0003] by creating a Registry key that runs on\n\n```\nstartup (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n[[T1547.001]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n15 CYWARE Social: Babyshark malware continues to target nuclear and cryptocurrency industries\n[https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\n16 Malwarebytes: APTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent threats use the coronavirus as a lure\n[https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-coronavirus-as-a-lure/)\n[coronavirus-as-a-lure/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/04/apts-and-covid-19-how-advanced-persistent-threats-use-the-coronavirus-as-a-lure/)\n\n17 cyberscoop: North Korea could accelerate commercial espionage to meet Kim’s economic deadline\n[https://www.cyberscoop.com/north-korea-accelerate-commercial-espionage-meet-kims-economic-deadline/](https://www.cyberscoop.com/north-korea-accelerate-commercial-espionage-meet-kims-economic-deadline/)\n\n18 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\nPage 4 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n```\n     o It then collects system information (System Information Discovery [T1082]), sends it to\n\n```\nthe operator’s command control (C2) servers, and awaits further commands.[19,20,21,22]\n\n  - Open-source reporting indicates BabyShark is delivered via an email message containing a\nlink or an attachment (see Initial Access section for more information) (Phishing: Spearphising\n_[Link [T1566.002], Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]). Kimsuky tailors email](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002/)_\nphishing messages to match its targets’ interests. Observed targets have been U.S. think\ntanks and the global cryptocurrency industry.[23]\n\n  - Kimsuky uses PowerShell to run executables from the internet without touching the physical\nhard disk on a computer by using the target’s memory (Command and Scripting Interpreter:\n_[PowerShell [T1059.001]). PowerShell commands/scripts can be executed without invoking](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1059/001/)_\n```\n   powershell.exe through HTA files or mshta.exe.[24, 25, 26, 27]\n\n##### Persistence\n\n```\n[Kimsuky has demonstrated the ability to establish Persistence [TA0003] through using malicious](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0003/)\nbrowser extensions, modifying system processes, manipulating the autostart execution, using\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and changing the default file association for an application. By\nusing these methods, Kimsuky can gain login and password information and/or launch malware\noutside of some application allowlisting solutions.\n\n  - In 2018, Kimsuky used an extension, which was available on the Google Chrome Web Store,\nto infect victims and steal passwords and cookies from their browsers (Man-in-the-Browser\n\n[[T1185]). The extension’s reviews gave it a five-star rating, however the text of the reviews](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1185/)\napplied to other extensions or was negative. The reviews were likely left by compromised\nGoogle+ accounts.[28]\n\n19 CYWARE Social: Babyshark malware continues to target nuclear and cryptocurrency industries\n[https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\n20 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n21 Palo Alto Networks Unit 42: New BabyShark Malware Targets U.S. National Security Think Tanks\n[https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/)\n\n22 Palo Alto Networks Unit 42: BabyShark Malware Part Two – Attacks Continue Using KimJongRAT and PCRat\n[https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/babyshark-malware-part-two-attacks-continue-using-kimjongrat-and-pcrat/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/babyshark-malware-part-two-attacks-continue-using-kimjongrat-and-pcrat/)\n\n23 CYWARE Social: Babyshark malware continues to target nuclear and cryptocurrency industries\n[https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829](https://cyware.com/news/babyshark-malware-continues-to-target-nuclear-and-cryptocurrency-industries-40e04829)\n\n24 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n25 Palo Alto Networks Unit 42: BabyShark Malware Part Two – Attacks Continue Using KimJongRAT and PCRat\n[https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/babyshark-malware-part-two-attacks-continue-using-kimjongrat-and-pcrat/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/babyshark-malware-part-two-attacks-continue-using-kimjongrat-and-pcrat/)\n\n26 McAfee: What is mshta, how can it be used and how to protect against it\n[https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/what-is-mshta-how-can-it-be-used-and-how-to-protect-against-it/](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/what-is-mshta-how-can-it-be-used-and-how-to-protect-against-it/)\n\n27 Palo Alto Networks Unit 42: New BabyShark Malware Targets U.S. National Security Think Tanks\n[https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/)\n\n28 Netscout: Stolen Pencil Campaign Targets Academia\n[https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\nPage 5 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n\n\n  - Kimsuky may install a new service that can execute at startup by using utilities to interact with\nservices or by directly modifying the Registry keys (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\n\n[[T1547]). The service name may be disguised with the name from a related operating system](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1547/)\nfunction or by masquerading as benign software. Services may be created with administrator\nprivileges but are executed under system privileges, so an adversary can also use a service to\nescalate privileges from Administrator to System. They can also directly start services through\nService Execution.[29, 30]\n\n  - During the STOLEN PENCIL operation in May 2018, Kimsuky used the GREASE malware.\nGREASE is a tool capable of adding a Windows administrator account and enabling RDP\n[while avoiding firewall rules (Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol [T1021.001]).[31]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/001/)\n\n  - Kimsuky uses a document stealer module that changes the default program associated with\nHangul Word Processor (HWP) documents (.hwp files) in the Registry (Event Triggered\n_[Execution: Change Default File Association [T1546.001]). Kimsuky manipulates the default](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1546/001/)_\nRegistry setting to open a malicious program instead of the legitimate HWP program (HWP is\na Korean word processor). The malware will read and email the content from HWP documents\nbefore the legitimate HWP program ultimately opens the document.[32] Kimsuky also targets\nMicrosoft Office users by formatting their documents in a .docx file rather than .hwp and will\ntailor their macros accordingly.[33]\n\n  - Kimsuky maintains access to compromised domains by uploading actor-modified versions of\nopen-source Hypertext Processor (PHP)-based web shells; these web shells enable the APT\nactor to upload, download, and delete files and directories on the compromised domains\n[(Server Software Component: Web Shell [T1505.003]). The actor often adds “Dinosaur”](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1505/003/)\nreferences within the modified web shell codes.[34]\n\n##### Privilege Escalation\n\nKimsuky uses well-known methods for Privilege Escalation [[TA0004]. These methods include placing](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0004/)\nscripts in the Startup folder, creating and running new services, changing default file associations,\nand injecting malicious code in explorer.exe.\n\n29 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n30 Palo Alto Networks Unit 42: New BabyShark Malware Targets U.S. National Security Think Tanks\n[https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/)\n\n31 Netscout: Stolen Pencil Campaign Targets Academia\n[https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\n\n32 Securelist: The “Kimsuky” Operation: A North Korean APT?\n[https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\n33 Private Sector Partner.\n\n34 Private Sector Partner.\n\nPage 6 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n\n\n  - Kimsuky has used Win7Elevate—an exploit from the Metasploit framework—to bypass the\nUser Account Control to inject malicious code into explorer.exe (Process Injection [[T1055]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055/)\nThis malicious code decrypts its spying library—a collection of keystroke logging and remote\ncontrol access tools and remote control download and execution tools—from resources,\nregardless of the victim’s operating system. It then saves the decrypted file to a disk with a\nrandom but hardcoded name (e.g., dfe8b437dd7c417a6d.tmp) in the user’s temporary folder\nand loads this file as a library, ensuring the tools are then on the system even after a reboot.\nThis allows for the escalation of privileges.[35]\n\n  - Before the injection takes place, the malware sets the necessary privileges (see figure 1). The\nmalware writes the path to its malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and ensures the remote\nprocess is loaded by creating a remote thread within explorer.exe (Process Injection\n\n[T1055]).[36]\n\n_Figure 1: Privileges set for the injection[37]_\n\n##### Defense Evasion\n\n35 Securelist: The “Kimsuky” Operation: A North Korean APT?\n[https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\n36 Yoroi: The North Korean Kimsuky APT Keeps Threatening South Korea Evolving its TTPs\n[https://yoroi.company/research/the-north-korean-kimsuky-apt-keeps-threatening-south-korea-evolving-its-ttps/](https://yoroi.company/research/the-north-korean-kimsuky-apt-keeps-threatening-south-korea-evolving-its-ttps/)\n\n37 Yoroi: The North Korean Kimsuky APT Keeps Threatening South Korea Evolving its TTPs\n[https://yoroi.company/research/the-north-korean-kimsuky-apt-keeps-threatening-south-korea-evolving-its-ttps/](https://yoroi.company/research/the-north-korean-kimsuky-apt-keeps-threatening-south-korea-evolving-its-ttps/)\n\nPage 7 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n\n[Kimsuky uses well-known and widely available methods for Defense Evasion [TA0005] within a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0005/)\nnetwork. These methods include disabling security tools, deleting files, and using Metasploit.[38,39]\n\n  - Kimsuky’s malicious DLL runs at startup to zero (i.e., turn off) the Windows firewall Registry\nkeys (see figure 2).

The malicious code decrypts](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055)\nits spying library from resources, saves the decrypted file to disk with a random but hardcoded\nname in the victim's temporary folder, and loads the file as a library.[45,46,47]\n\n##### Credential Access\n\nKimsuky uses legitimate tools and network sniffers to harvest credentials from web browsers, files,\nand keyloggers (Credential Access [[TA0006]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/)\n\n  - Kimsuky uses memory dump programs instead of using well-known malicious software and\nperforms the credential extraction offline. Kimsuky uses ProcDump, a Windows command line\nadministration tool, also available for Linux, that allows a user to create crash dumps/core\ndumps of processes based upon certain criteria, such as high central processing unit (CPU)\n[utilization (OS Credential Dumping [T1003]). ProcDump monitors for CPU spikes and](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1003/)\ngenerates a crash dump when a value is met; it passes information to a Word document\nsaved on the computer. It can be used as a general process dump utility that actors can\nembed in other scripts, as seen by Kimsuky’s inclusion of ProcDump in the BabyShark\nmalware.[48]\n\n  - According to open-source security researchers, Kimsuky abuses a Chrome extension to steal\n[passwords and cookies from browsers (Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]).[49,50] The spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1185/)\nemail directs a victim to a phishing site, where the victim is shown a benign PDF document but\nis not able to view it. The victim is then redirected to the official Chrome Web Store page to\ninstall a Chrome extension, which has the ability to steal cookies and site passwords and\nloads a JavaScript file, named jQuery.js, from a separate site (see figure 3).[51]\n\n45 Securityweek.com: North Korean Suspected Cyber-espionage Attacks Against South Korea Entities\n[https://www.securityweek.com/north-korea-suspected-cyber-espionage-attacks-against-south-korean-entities](https://www.securityweek.com/north-korea-suspected-cyber-espionage-attacks-against-south-korean-entities)\n\n46 Securelist: The “Kimsuky” Operation: A North Korean APT?\n[https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\n47 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n48 Microsoft: Detecting Credential Theft Through Memory Access Modelling With Microsoft Defender ATP\n[https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/05/09/detecting-credential-theft-through-memory-access-modelling-with-](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/05/09/detecting-credential-theft-through-memory-access-modelling-with-microsoft-defender-atp/)\n[microsoft-defender-atp/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/05/09/detecting-credential-theft-through-memory-access-modelling-with-microsoft-defender-atp/)\n\n49 MITRE ATT&CK: Groups – Kimsuky\n[https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\n\n50 ZDNet: Cyber-espionage-group-uses-chrome-extension-to-infect-victims\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-espionage-group-uses-chrome-extension-to-infect-victims/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-espionage-group-uses-chrome-extension-to-infect-victims/)\n\n51 ZDNet: Cyber-espionage-group-uses-chrome-extension-to-infect-victims\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-espionage-group-uses-chrome-extension-to-infect-victims/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-espionage-group-uses-chrome-extension-to-infect-victims/)\n\nPage 9 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: JavaScript file, named jQuery.js[ 52]_\n\n  - Kimsuky also uses a PowerShell based keylogger, named MECHANICAL, and a network\n[sniffing tool, named Nirsoft SniffPass (Input Capture: Keylogging [T1056.001], Network](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/001/)\n_[Sniffing [T1040]).

The HWP document malware changes the default program association in the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0009/)\nRegistry to open HWP documents (Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association\n\n[[T1546.001]). When a user opens an HWP file, the Registry key change triggers the execution of](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1546/001/)\nmalware that opens the HWP document and then sends a copy of the HWP document to an account\nunder the adversary’s control. The malware then allows the user to open the file as normal without\nany indication to the user that anything has occurred. The keylogger intercepts keystrokes and writes\nthem to C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\System\\Ole DB\\msolui80.inc and records the active\n[window name where the user pressed keys (Input Capture: Keylogging [T1056.001]). There is](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/001/)\nanother keylogger variant that logs keystrokes into C:\\WINDOWS\\setup.log.[56]\n\nKimsuky has also used a Mac OS Python implant that gathers data from Mac OS systems and sends\n[it to a C2 server (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python [T1059.006]). The Python program](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1059/006/)\ndownloads various implants based on C2 options specified after the filedown.php (see figure 4).\n\n55 Securelist: The “Kimsuky” Operation: A North Korean APT?\n[https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\n56 Securelist: The “Kimsuky” Operation: A North Korean APT?\n[https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n\nPage 11 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n\n_Figure 4: Python Script targeting MacOS[57]_\n\n##### Command and Control \n\nKimsuky has used a modified TeamViewer client, version 5.0.9104, for Command and Control\n\n[[TA0011] (Remote Access Software [T1219]).

The program then modifies the TeamViewer Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1562/004/)_\n\n57 Private Sector Partner.\n\nPage 12 of 15 | Prod ct ID AA20 301A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | CNMF\n\n\nsettings by changing the TeamViewer strings in TeamViewer components. The launcher then\nconfigures several Registry values, including SecurityPasswordAES, that control how the remote\naccess tool will work. The SecurityPasswordAES Registry value represents a hash of the password\nused by a remote user to connect to TeamViewer Client (Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass\n_[the Hash [T1550.002]). This way, the attackers set a pre-shared authentication value to have access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/)_\nto the TeamViewer Client. The attacker will then execute the TeamViewer client netsvcs.exe.[58]\n\nKimsuky has been using a consistent format. In the URL used recently—express[.]php?op=1—\nthere appears to be an option range from 1 to 3.[59]\n\n##### Exfiltration\n\nOpen-source reporting from cybersecurity companies describes two different methods Kimsuky has\nused to exfiltrate stolen data: via email or through an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a\n[randomly generated 117-bytes buffer (Exfiltration [TA0010]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0010/)\n\nThere was no indication that the actor destroyed computers during the observed exfiltrations,\nsuggesting Kimsuky’s intention is to steal information, not to disrupt computer networks. Kimsuky’s\npreferred method for sending or receiving exfiltrated information is through email, with their malware\non the victim machine encrypting the data before sending it to a C2 server (Archive Collected Data\n\n[[T1560]). Kimsuky also sets up auto-forward rules within a victim’s email account (Email Collection:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560/)\n_[Email Forwarding Rule [T1114.003]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1114/003/)_\n\nKimsuky also uses an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer\nto exfiltrate stolen data. The data is sent RSA-encrypted (Encrypted Channel: Symmetric\n_[Cryptography [T1573.001]). Kimsuky’s malware constructs an 1120-bit public key and uses it to](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1573/001/)_\nencrypt the 117-bytes buffer.
