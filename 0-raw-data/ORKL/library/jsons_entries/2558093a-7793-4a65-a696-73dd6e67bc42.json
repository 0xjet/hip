WhiteBear is a parallel project or\nsecond stage of the Skipper Turla cluster of activity documented in another private\nintelligence report “Skipper Turla – the White Atlas framework” from mid-2016. Like previous\nTurla activity, WhiteBear leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections\nfor command and control (C2) infrastructure. As a matter of fact, WhiteBear infrastructure\nhas overlap with other Turla campaigns, like those deploying Kopiluwak, as documented in\n“KopiLuwak – A New JavaScript Payload from Turla” in December 2016. WhiteBear infected\nsystems maintained a dropper (which was typically signed) as well as a complex malicious\nplatform which was always preceded by WhiteAtlas module deployment attempts. However,\ndespite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns, we believe that WhiteBear is a distinct\nproject with a separate focus. We note that this observation of delineated target focus,\ntooling, and project context is an interesting one that also can be repeated across broadly\nlabeled Turla and Sofacy activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on embassies\nand consular operations around the world. All of these early WhiteBear targets were related\nto embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations. Continued WhiteBear activity later\nshifted to include defense-related organizations into June 2017. When compared to\nWhiteAtlas infections, WhiteBear deployments are relatively rare and represent a departure\nfrom the broader Skipper Turla target set. Additionally, a comparison of the WhiteAtlas\nframework to WhiteBear components indicates that the malware is the product of separate\ndevelopment efforts. WhiteBear infections appear to be preceded by a condensed\nspearphishing dropper, lack Firefox extension installer payloads, and contain several new\ncomponents signed with a new code signing digital certificate, unlike WhiteAtlas incidents\nand modules.\n\nThe exact delivery vector for WhiteBear components is unknown to us, although we\nhave very strong suspicion the group spearphished targets with malicious pdf files. The\ndecoy pdf document above was likely stolen from a target or partner. And, although\nWhiteBear components have been consistently identified on a subset of systems previously\ntargeted with the WhiteAtlas framework, and maintain components within the same filepaths\nand can maintain identical filenames, we were unable to firmly tie delivery to any specific\nWhiteAtlas component. WhiteBear focused on various embassies and diplomatic entities\naround the world in early 2016 – tellingly, attempts were made to drop and display decoy\npdf’s with full diplomatic headers and content alongside executable droppers on target\nsystems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe WhiteBear platform implements an elaborate set of messaging and injection\ncomponents to support full presence on victim hosts. A diagram helps to visualize the reach\nof injected components on the system.\n\n### WhiteBear Binary loader\n\n**Sample MD5: b099b82acb860d9a9a571515024b35f0**\n\n**Type PE EXE**\n\n**Compilation timestamp 2002.02.05 17:36:10 (GMT)**\n\n**Linker version 10.0 (MSVC 2010)**\n\n**Signature “Solid Loop Ldt” UTCTime 15/10/2015 00:00:00 GMT – UTCTime 14/10/2016**\n23:59:59 GMT\n\nThe WhiteBear binary loader maintains several features including two injection methods for\nits (oddly named) “KernelInjector” subsystem, also named by its developer\n\n– Standart\n\n– WindowInject (includes an unusual technique for remotely placing code into memory for\nsubsequent thread execution)\n\nThe loader also maintains two methods for privilege and DEP process protection handling:\n\n– GETSID_METHOD_1\n\n– GETSID METHOD 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe binary contains two resources:\n– BINARY 201\n– File size: 128 bytes\n– Contains the string, “explorer.exe”\n– BINARY 202\n– File size: 403456 bytes\n– File Type: PE file (this is the actual payload and is not encrypted)\n– This PE file resource stores the “main orchestrator” .dll file\n\n**Loader runtime flow**\n\nThe loader creates the mutex “{531511FA-190D-5D85-8A4A-279F2F592CC7}”, and waits up\nto two minutes if it is already present while logging the message “IsLoaderAlreadyWork +”.\nThe loader creates the mutex “{531511FA-190D-5D85-8A4A-279F2F592CC7}”, and waits up\nto two minutes. If it is already present while logging the message “IsLoaderAlreadyWork +”, it\nextracts the resource BINARY 201. This resource contains a wide string name of processes\nto inject into (i.e. “explorer.exe”).\n\nThe loader makes a pipe named: \\.pipeWinsock2CatalogChangeListener-%03x%01x-%01x\n\nWhere the “%x” parameter is replaced with the values 0xFFFFFFFF 0xEEEEEEEE\n0xDDDDDDDD, or if it has successfully obtained the user’s SID:\n\n\\.pipeWinsock2CatalogChangeListener-%02x%02x-%01x\n\nWith “%x” parameters replaced with numbers calculated from the current date and a munged\nuser SID.\n\nThe pipe is used to communicate with the target process and the transport module; the\nrunning code also reads its own image body and writes it to the pipe. The loader then obtains\nthe payload body from resource BINARY 202. It finds the running process that matches the\ntarget name, copies the buffer containing the payload into the process, then starts its copy in\nthe target process.\n\nThere are some interesting, juvenile, and non-native English-speaker debug messages\ncompiled into the code:\n\n– i cunt waiting anymore #%d\n\n– lights aint turnt off with #%d\n\n– Not find process\n\n– CMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER\n\n– CMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_TAKE_LAST_CONNECTION\n\n– CMessageProcessingSystem::Send_TAKE_FIN\n\n### WhiteBear Main module/orchestrator\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample MD5: 06bd89448a10aa5c2f4ca46b4709a879**\n**Type, size: PE DLL, 394 kb**\n**Compilation timestamp: 2002.02.05 17:31:28 (GMT)**\n**Linker version: 10.0 (MSVC 2010)**\n**Unsigned Code**\n\nThe main module has no exports, only a DllMain entry which spawns one thread and returns.\nThe main module maintains multiple BINARY resources that include executable,\nconfigurations, and encryption data:\n\n101 – RSA private (!) key\n102 – RSA public key\n103 – empty\n104 – 16 encrypted bytes\n105 – location (“%HOMEPATH%ntuser.dat.LOG3”)\n106 – process names (e.g. “iexplore.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe, outlook.exe, safari.exe,\nopera.exe”) to inject into\n107 – Transport module for interaction with C&C\n108 – C2 configuration\n109 – Registry location\n(“HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsNTCurrentVersionExplorerScreen Saver”)\n110 – no information\n111 – 8 zero bytes\n\nValues 104 – 111 are encrypted with the RSA private key (resource 101) and compressed\nwith bzip2.4. The RSA key is stored with header stripped in a format similar to Microsoft’s\nPVK; the RSA PRIVATE KEY header is appended by the loader before reading the keys into\nthe encryption code. Resource 109 points to a registry location called “external storage”,\nbuilt-in resources are called “PE Storage”.\n\nIn addition to storing code, crypto resources, and configuration data in PE resources,\nWhiteBear copies much of this data to the victim host’s registry. Registry storage is located in\nthe following keys. Subkeys and stored values listed below:\n\n[HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerScreenSaver]\n\n[HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionExplorerScreenSaver]\n\nRegistry subkeys:\n{629336E3-58D6-633B-5182-576588CF702A} Contains the RSA private key used to\nencrypt/decrypt other resources / resource 101\n{3CDC155D-398A-646E-1021-23047D9B4366} Resource 105 – current file location\n{81A03BF8-60AA-4A56-253C-449121D61CAF} Resource 106 – process names\n{31AC34A1-2DE2-36AC-1F6E-86F43772841F} Contains the internet C&C transport module\n/ resource 107\n{8E9810C5-3014-4678-27EE-3B7A7AC346AF} Resource 108 – C&C config\n\n\n-----\n\n{28E74BDA-4327-31B0-17B9-56A66A818C1D} Resource 110 plugins\n{4A3130BD-2608-730F-31A7-86D16CE66100} Resource 111\n{119D263D-68FC-1942-3CA3-46B23FA652A0} Unique Guid (“ObjectID”)\n{1DC12691-2B24-2265-435D-735D3B118A70} “Task Queue”\n{6CEE6FE1-10A2-4C33-7E7F-855A51733C77} “Result Queue”\n{56594FEA-5774-746D-4496-6361266C40D0} unknown\n{831511FA-190D-5D85-8A4A-279F2F592CC7} unknown\n\nFinally, if the main WhiteBear module fails to use registry storage, it uses “FS Storage” in file\n%TEMP%KB943729.log. The module reads all of its data and binary components from one\nof the storages and then verifies the integrity of data (RSA+bzip2 compression+signature).\n\nThe module maintains functionality which is divided into a set of subsystems that are loosely\nnamed by the developers:\n\n- result queue\n\n- task queue\n\n- message processing system\n\n- autorun manager\n\n- execution subsystem\n\n- inject manager\n\n- PEStorage\n\n- local transport manager/internal transport channel\n\nIt creates the following temporary files:\n%TEMP%CVRG72B5.tmp.cvr\n%TEMP%CVRG1A6B.tmp.cvr\n%TEMP%CVRG38D9.tmp.cvr\n\n%TEMP%~DF1E05.tmp contains the updated body of the loader during an update.\n\nEvery day (as specified by local time) the main module restarts the transport subsystem\nwhich includes:\n\n- message processing\n\n- named pipe transport (“NPTransport”)\n\nIf the registry/file storage is empty, the module performs a ‘migration’ of hardcoded modules\nand settings to the storage location. This data is encrypted with a new RSA key (which is\nalso stored in the registry).\n\nThe data in the registry is prepended with a 0xC byte header. The maximum size of each\nregistry item is 921,600 bytes; if the maximum size is exceeded, it is split into several items.\nThe format of the header is shown below:\n\n[4:service DWORD][4:chunk index][4:chunk size including header]\n\n\n-----\n\nEvery time the orchestrator module is loaded it validates that the storage area contains the\nappropriate data and that all of the components can be decrypted and validated. If these\nchecks fail the module reinstalls a configuration from the resource “REINSTALL”.\n\n**Pipe Transport**\n\nThe module generates the pipe name (with the same prefix as the loader); waits for incoming\nconnections; receives data and pushes it to the ‘message processing system’. The module\ngenerates the pipe name (with the same prefix as the loader); waits for incoming\nconnections; receives data and pushes it to the ‘message processing system’. Every packet\nis expected to be at least 6 bytes and contain the following header:   [4:ID][2:command]\n\nList of commands:\n\n1 : new task\n\n2 : update the loader + orchestrator file\n\n4 : send task result\n\n5 : send settings\n\n6 : write results to registry/file storage\n\n7 : enable / disable c2 transport / update status\n\n8 : uninstall\n\n9 : nop\n\n10 : “CMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER”; write results to\nregistry\n\n11: write the last connection data ‘{56594FEA-5774-746D-4496-6361266C40D0}’ aka “last\nconnection” storage value\n\n12: “give cache” – write cached commands from the C&C\n\n13: “take cache” – append C&C commands to the cache\n\nDepending on the command, the module returns the results from previously run tasks, the\nconfiguration of the module, or a confirmation message.\n\nAn example of these tasks is shown below:\n\n- write a file and execute it with CreateProcess() capturing all of the standard output\n\n- update C&C configuration, plugin storage, etc\n\n- update autoruns\n\n- write arbitrary files to the filesystem (“File Upload”)\n\n- read arbitrary files from the filesystem (“File Download”)\n\n- update itself\n\n- uninstall\n\n- push task results to C2 servers\n\nThe “LocalTransport manager” handles named pipe communication and identifies if the\npacket received is designated to the current instance or to someone else (down the route). In\nthe latter scenario the LocalTansport manager re-encrypts the packet, serializes it (again),\n\n\n-----\n\nand pushes the packet via a named pipe on the local network to another hop,\n(NullSessionPipes). This effectively makes each infected node a packet router.\n\nThe Autorun manager subsystem is responsible for tracking the way that the malicious\nmodule starts in the system and it maintains several different methods for starting\nautomatically (shown below):\n**LinkAutorun The subsystem searches for a LNK file in the target directory, changes the**\npath to “cmd.exe” and the description to ‘ /q /c start “” “%s” && start “” “%s” ‘\n**TaskScheduler20Autorun The subsystem creates the ITaskService (works only on**\nWindows Vista+) and uses the ITaskService interface to create a new task with a logon\ntrigger\n**StartupAutorun The subsystem creates a LNK file in %STARTUP%**\n**ScreenSaverAutorun The subsystem installs as a current screensaver with a hidden**\nwindow\n**HiddenTaskAutorun The subsystem creates the task ITaskScheduler (works only on pre-**\nVista NT). The task trigger start date is set to the creation date of the Windows directory\n**ShellAutorun Winlogon registry [HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindows**\nNTCurrentVersionWinlogon] Shell=”explorer.exe, …”\n\nFile Uninstallation is done in a discreet manner. The file is filled with zeroes, then renamed to\na temporary filename before being deleted\n\n### WhiteBear Transport library (aka “Internet Relations”, “Pipe Relations”)\n\n**Sample MD5: 19ce5c912768958aa3ee7bc19b2b032c**\n\n**Type: PE DLL**\n\n**Linker timestamp: 2002.02.05 17:58:22 (GMT)**\n\n**Linker version: 10.0**\n\n**Signature “Solid Loop Ldt” UTCTime 15/10/2015 00:00:00 GMT – UTCTime 14/10/2016**\n23:59:59 GMT\n\nThis transport library does not appear on disk in its PE format. It is maintained as encrypted\nresource 107 in the orchestrator module, then decrypted and loaded by the orchestrator\ndirectly into the memory of the target process. This C2 interaction module is independent,\nonce started, it interacts with the orchestrator using its local named pipe.\n\nTo communicate with its C2 server, the transport library uses the system user agent or\ndefault “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0)”.\n\nBefore attempting a connection with its configured C2 server, the module checks if the victim\nsystem is connected to Internet by sending HTTP 1.1 GET / requests to the following servers\n(this process stops after the first successful connection):\n\n- update.microsoft.com\n\n- microsoft.com\n\n\n-----\n\n- windowsupdate.microsoft.com\n\n- yahoo.com\n\n- google.com\n\nIf there is no Internet connection available, the module changes state to, “CANNOT_WORK”\nand notifies the peer by sending command “7” over the local pipe.\n\nThe C2 configuration is obtained from the main module with the command “5”. This checks\nwhether the module complies with the schedule specified in the C2 settings (which includes\ninactivity time and the interval between connections). The C2 interaction stages have\ninteresting function names and an odd misspelling, indicating that the developer may not be\na native English speaker (or may have learned the English language in a British setting):\n“InternetRelations::GetInetConnectToGazer”\n“InternetRelations::ReceiveMessageFromCentre”\n“InternetRelations::SendMessageToCentre”\n“PipeRelations::CommunicationTpansportPipe”\n\nThe module writes the encrypted log to %TEMP%CVRG38D9.tmp.cvr The module sends a\nHTTP 1.0 GET request through a randomly generated path to the C2 server. The server’s\nreply is expected to have its MD5 checksum appended to the packet. If C2 interaction fails,\nthe module sends the command “10” (“NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER”) to the orchestrator.\n\n### Unusual WhiteBear Encryption\n\nThe encryption implemented in the WhiteBear orchestrator is particularly interesting. We note\nthat the resource section is encrypted/decrypted and packed/decompressed with\nRSA+3DES+BZIP2. This implementation is unique and includes the format of the private key\nas stored in the resource section. 3DES is present in Sofacy and Duqu2 components,\nhowever they are missing in this Microsoft-centric RSA encryption technique. The private key\nformat used in this schema and RSA crypto combination with 3DES is (currently) unique to\nthis threat actor.\n\nThe private key itself is stored as a raw binary blob, in a format similar to the one Microsoft\ncode uses in PVK format. This format is not officially documented, but its structures and\nhandling are coded into OpenSSL. This private key value is stored in the orchestrator\nresources without valid headers. The orchestrator code prepends valid headers and passes\nthe results to OpenSSL functions that parse the blob.\n\n### Digital Code-Signing Certificate – Fictional Corporation or Assumed Identity?\n\nMost WhiteBear samples are signed with a valid code signing certificate issued for “Solid\nLoop Ltd”, a once-registered British organization. Solid Loop is likely a phony front\norganization or a defunct organization and actors assumed its identity to abuse the name\n\n\n-----\n\nand trust, in order to attain deceptive code-signing digital certificates.\n\n### WhiteBear Command and Control\n\nThe WhiteBear C2 servers are consistent with long standing Turla infrastructure\nmanagement practices, so the backdoors callback to a mix of compromised servers and\nhijacked destination satellite IP hosts. For example, direct, hardcoded Turla satellite IP C2\naddresses are shown below:\n\nC2 IP Address        Geolocation              IP Space Owner\n\n169.255.137[.]203     South Sudan              IPTEC, VSAT\n\n217.171.86[.]137      Congo                   Global Broadband Solution, Kinshasa\nVSAT\n\n66.178.107[.]140      Unknown – Likely Africa     SES/New Skies Satellites\n\n### Targeting and Victims\n\nWhiteBear targets over the course of a couple years are related to government foreign\naffairs, international organizations, and later, defense organizations. The geolocation of the\nincidents are below:\n\nEurope\nSouth Asia\nCentral Asia\nEast Asia\n\n\n-----\n\nSouth America\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWhiteBear activity reliant on this toolset seems to have diminished in June 2017. But Turla\nefforts continue to be run as multiple subgroups and campaigns. This one started targeting\ndiplomatic entities and later included defense related organizations. Infrastructure overlap\nwith other Turla campaigns, code artifacts, and targeting are consistent with past Turla\nefforts. With this subset of 2016-2017 WhiteBear activity, Turla continues to be one of the\nmost prolific, longstanding, and advanced APT we have researched, and continues to be the\nsubject of much of our research.
