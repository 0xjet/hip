We pick here a\nHigh Value Suspicious Domain and check what else is on the same name server to\nexamine what is discovered through the process.\n\nOur seeding domain will be service-update[.]link\n\nLooking at the Name Server info from our API\n\n\"domain\": \"service-update[.]link\",\n\n\"ns_avg_ttl\": 4149,\n\n\"ns_domain\": \"dendrite.network\",\n\n\n-----\n\nnum_domains : 203,\n\nThis is a low density Name server where we have only seen 203 domains on it. It has a\nvery low average TTL across all the domains on there which may suggest a lot of changes\ncompared to other name servers.\n\nA quick lookup using our explore API gives us a number of suspicious domains with\nmatching characteristics. These appear to be in two groups.\n\n**Group 1.**\n\nCommonalities- Tech related theme. Nameserver domain- dendrite.network. Have an A\nrecord-AS holder ColoCrossing- Registrar Namesilo- \"address\": \"Tavernier St., Wall House\",\n\n\"city\": \"Loubiere\",\n\n\"country\": \"DM\",\n\nDomain PTR Record Potential Target Registrar\n\nupdate-support[.]network *colocrossing.com 3 Mobile UK Namesilo\n\nservice-update[.]link *colocrossing.com Live soon Namesilo\n\nhs-securealerts[.]com *colocrossing.com HSBC Namesilo\n\nref0948a[.]com *colocrossing.com unknown Namesilo\n\nuk-taxupdate[.]com *colocrossing.com HMRC Namesilo\n\naem-new[.]com *colocrossing.com 3 Mobile UK Namesilo\n\naempath[.]com *colocrossing.com 3 Mobile UK Namesilo\n\ncom-gb[.]mobi *colocrossing.com Mobile UK Namesilo\n\nIt appears that Group 1 have either been used maliciously already or are waiting to be used\nmaliciously. Monitoring the “waiting” group for changes is key as this may lead to being able\nto block their activity once the domain moves into an actively malicious mode. There are a\nnumber of ways to do this such as monitoring for new changes in DNS or associated\nrecords. Moving of infrastructure can often mark an activation of a malicious domain. A\ngood example of this is when the domain avsvmcloud[.]com was activated for the\nSolarwinds breach, it switched to its own nameservers for the active part of the campaign.\n\n## Group 2.\n\nThis group seems to lead to more and more indicators so I’ll post them over time.\n\n\n-----\n\nCommonalities- Tech related theme. Nameserver domain- dendrite.network. Domains have\nbeen aged. Have an A record-AS holder Nice IT Services Group Inc.\n\n- Registrar Namesilo- \"address\": \"Tavernier St., Wall House\",\n\n\"city\": \"Loubiere\"\"country\": \"DM\n\nDomain AS Name of IP Potential Target Registrar\n\nPaypalservice[.]support Nice IT Services Paypal Namesilo\n\nsmall-url[.]cc Nice IT Services adobe and others Namesilo\n\n[election[.]finance Nice IT Services malware download Namesilo](https://securitytrails.com/domain/election.finance/dns)\n\nUlsterbankonlineltd[.]com Nice IT Services Ulster Bank(RBS) Namesilo\n\nChoicebank[.]online Nice IT Services Choice Bank/First Choice Namesilo\n\nDocumentcloud[.]pw Nice IT Services adobe and others Namesilo\n\nrbscotland-online[.]com Nice IT Services Royal Bank of Scotland Namesilo\n\nBtctools[.]net Nice IT Services Bitcoin Wallet stealer Namesilo\n\ngb-kpmg[.]com Nice IT Services KPMG Namesilo\n\nsecure-id[.]cloud Nice IT Services Secure ID Namesilo\n\nservice-ca-verification[.]com Nice IT Services Flagged as spammer Namesilo\n\nTeamtnt[.]red Nice IT Services Malware Downloads Namesilo\n\nSo just touching on these two groups based on similarities, these of course could be one\ngroup, this Nameserver is very heavily used by malicious actors and definitely one threat\nactor group called Team TNT.\n\nHow can I use this information?\n\nAll the information above was collected by our API and can be leveraged for threat hunting\nor detections. The information is pre-collected and cached so new lookups don’t have to be\ndone each time you have a new indicator to check. We’ve already collected all this\ninformation and run some analysis on it to give things like reputation scores for the\nnameserver, the AS number reputation, the subnet reputation etc.\n\nA security team can use Yara rules over this information to try and find “High Value\nMalicious Domains “ in their logs or associated IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also have threat hunting API endpoints that gather behavioral clusters for you so you\ncan quickly create your own new intelligence, or we can do it for you.\n\nName\n*\nThank you!\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
