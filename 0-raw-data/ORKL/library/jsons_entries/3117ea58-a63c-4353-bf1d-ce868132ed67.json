This signals just**\n\n**how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive framework.**\n\n**Why has the Poseidon threat remained undetected for so many years? In reality, it has not. Most**\n\n**samples were detected promptly. However, Poseidon’s practice of being a ‘custom-tailored malware**\n\n**implants boutique’ kept security researchers from connecting different campaigns under the umbrella of**\n\n**a single threat actor. This approach entails crafting campaigns components on-demand and sometimes**\n\n**fabricating entirely unique malicious artifacts.**\n\n# 1st Portuguese-speaking group #ThePoseidonAPT attacks companies globally #TheSAS2016\n\n**[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F73673%2Fposeidon-group-a-targeted-attack-boutique-specializing-in-global-cyber-espionage%2F&text=1st+Portuguese-speaking+group+%23ThePoseidonAPT+attacks+companies+globally+%23TheSAS2016)**\n\n**Our research team was able to put together the disparate pieces of this puzzle by diligently tracing the**\n\n**evolution of Poseidon’s toolkit in pursuit of an overarching understanding of how the actor thinks and**\n\n**the specific practices involved in infecting and extorting its victims.

The**\n\n**proper detection of each iteration of their evolving toolkit may have been enough to thwart specific**\n\n**efforts, but to truly understand the magnitude of Poseidon’s combined operations required an**\n\n**archeological effort to match.**\n\n**The Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and sea. They are**\n\n**dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information from company**\n\n**networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded, executable elements inside**\n\n**office documents and extensive lateral movement tools. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by**\n\n**a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm.**\n\n**Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a**\n\n**later time, persisting on the network to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The**\n\n**Poseidon Group has been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their**\n\n**tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the gamut of**\n\n**Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite connections. Poseidon**\n\n**continues to be active at this time.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**the Seas (which also coincides with their later abuse of satellite communications meant to service ships**\n\n**at sea). The boutique element is reflected in their artisanally adaptive toolkit for lateral movement and**\n\n**data collection which appears to change from infection to infection to fit custom-tailored requirements**\n\n**for each of their prospective clients. The business cycle includes what is euphemistically referred to as**\n\n**‘financial forecasting’ using stolen information, so we like to say that Poseidon’s boutique not only deals**\n\n**in targeted attacks but also stolen treasures.**\n\n**We noticed that several security companies and enthusiasts had unwittingly reported on fragments of**\n\n**Poseidon’s campaigns over the years. However, nobody noticed that these fragments actually belonged**\n\n**to the same threat actor. Perhaps because many of these campaigns were designed to run on specific**\n\n**machines, using English and Portuguese languages, with diverse command and control servers located**\n\n**in different countries and soon discarded, signing malware with different certificates issued in the name**\n\n**of rogue companies, and so on. By carefully collecting all the evidence and then reconstructing the**\n\n**attacker’s timeline, we found that it was actually a single group operating since at least 2005, and**\n\n**possible earlier, and still active on the market.**\n\n**With this understanding, GReAT researchers were able to recognize similarities in obfuscation and**\n\n**development traits leading back to widely-reported but little understood variants on a sample in 2015,**\n\n**which searched for prominent leaders and secret documents involving them.**\n\n**The very first samples from this campaign were detected by Kaspersky Lab back in the early 2000s.**\n\n**However, as noted previously, it is a very complex task to correlate indicators and evidence in order to**\n\n**put together all the pieces of this intricate puzzle. By the middle of 2015 it was possible to identify that**\n\n**throughout this period of time it’s been the same threat actor, which we call Poseidon Group.**\n\n**The targets are companies in energy and utilities, telecommunications, public relations, media, financial**\n\n**institutions, governmental institutions, services in general and manufacturing. The geographical spread**\n\n**of victims is heavily-skewed towards Brazil, the United States, France, Kazakhstan, United Arab**\n\n**Emirates, India and Russia. Many of the victims have joint ventures or partner operations in Brazil. The**\n\n**importance of the victims is not measured in numbers since each of these victims is a large-scale**\n\n**(often multinational) enterprise.**\n\n**One of the characteristics of the group behind Poseidon is an active exploration of domain-based**\n\n**networks. Such network topology is typical for companies and enterprises.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**sensitive information that represents significant value in relation to investments and stock valuations.**\n\n**The Poseidon Group actively targets this sort of corporate environment for the theft of intellectual**\n\n**property and commercial information, occasionally focusing on personal information on executives.**\n\n**The main infection vector for Poseidon is the use of spear-phishing emails including RTF/DOC files,**\n\n**usually with a human resources lure. The executables are also often digitally signed and occasionally**\n\n**hidden in alternate data streams to fool security solutions. Poseidon’s toolkit displays an awareness of**\n\n**many antivirus providers over the years, attempting to attack or spoof these processes as a means of**\n\n**self-defense for their infections. Once the infection happens, it reports to the command and control**\n\n**servers before beginning a complex lateral movement phase. This phase will often leverage a**\n\n**specialized tool that automatically collects a wide array of information including credentials, group**\n\n**management policies, and even system logs to better hone further attacks and assure execution of**\n\n**their malware. This way the attackers actually know what applications and commands they can use**\n\n**without raising an alert to the network administrator during lateral movement and exfiltration.**\n\n**Once the target’s machine is compromised, the attacker first enumerates all processes running in the**\n\n**system and all services. Then the attacker looks for all administrator accounts on both the local**\n\n**machine and the network. This technique allows them to map network resources and make lateral**\n\n**movements inside the network, landing in the perfect machine to match the attacker’s interest. This**\n\n**reflects the Poseidon Group’s familiarity with Windows network administration. In many cases, their**\n\n**ultimate interest is the Domain Controller.**\n\n**Additionally malware reports itself to its hardcoded command and control servers and established a**\n\n**backdoor connection, so the attacker may have a permanent remote connection.**\n\n**Poseidon utilizes a variety of tools. Their main infection tool has been steadily evolving since 2005, with**\n\n**code remnants remaining the same to this day, while others have been altered to fit the requirements of**\n\n**new operating systems and specific campaigns. A noteworthy addition to the Poseidon toolkit is the IGT**\n\n**supertool (Information Gathering toolkit), a bulking 15 megabyte executable that orchestrates a series**\n\n**of different information collections steps, exfiltration, and the cleanup of components. This tool appears**\n\n**to be designed to operate on high-value corporate systems like Domain Controllers or IIS servers that**\n\n**act as repositories of valuable information, particularly for lateral movement. The Information Gathering**\n\n**Tool (IGT) tool is coded in Delphi and includes powershell and SQL components across a dozen**\n\n**different drops. This tool contains several other executable files made in different programming**\n\n**languages ranging from Visual Basic 6 to C#, each one performing a very clear task devised by the**\n\n\n-----\n\n**credentials belonging to the Domain and database server, services being run from the OS and**\n\n**everything that could help the Poseidon Group make its attack more customized to its victim.**\n\n**No zero-day vulnerabilities have been found in the analysis of the samples obtained regarding this**\n\n**campaign. Poseidon’s conventional means of deceiving users with executable files posing inside Word**\n\n**and RTF document files, and actual poisoned documents with malicious macro-scripts has been the**\n\n**sole method used for compromising their desired targets. As we have seen in other targeted**\n\n**campaigns, social engineering and carefully crafted spear-phishing attacks play a crucial role in the**\n\n**effectiveness of getting a foothold in the desired system.**\n\n**Poseidon is particularly focused on the Microsoft Windows operating system family, specifically**\n\n**customizing the infection method for each one so as to gather different information and hide its**\n\n**presence after the initial infection. Other products usually found in corporate environments, such as an**\n\n**SQL server, are being used for lateral movement and credential harvesting using a customized toolset**\n\n**designed by the crafty Poseidon Group. Because of Poseidon’s longevity, there are samples targeting**\n\n**Windows systems as early as Windows NT 4.0 Server and Windows 95 Workstation up to current**\n\n**versions like Windows 8.1, as well as server variants (very important to them, given the emphasis on**\n\n**reaching Domain Controllers in corporate environments.)**\n\n**The extortion elements of this campaign are what set it apart from others. The exfiltration of sensitive**\n\n**data is done in order to coerce the victim into a business relationship under the threat of exchanging**\n\n**this information with competitors or leveraging it as part of the company’s offering of ‘investment**\n\n**forecasting’. Additionally this is the first ever publicly known Portuguese-speaking targeted attacks**\n\n**campaign.**\n\n**Poseidon has maintained a consistently evolving toolkit since the mid-2000s. The malware has not**\n\n**avoided detection but instead been so inconspicuous as to not arouse much suspicion due to the fact**\n\n**that this malware only represents the initial phase of the attack. An altogether different component is**\n\n**leveraged once Poseidon reaches an important machine like an enterprise’s Domain Controller. This is**\n\n**where the main collection takes place by use of the IGT (Information Gathering Tool) toolkit.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Poseidon Group has interesting practices when it comes to its use of command and control servers,**\n\n**including redundancies and quickly discarding command and control (C&Cs) servers after specific**\n\n**campaigns. This has actually allowed us to sinkhole several domains. A few of these still had active**\n\n**infections attempting to report to the C&Cs. This adds an interesting dimension to the story. As part of**\n\n**Kaspersky Lab’s commitment to securing cyberspace for everyone, we reached out and notified**\n\n**identifiable victims, regardless of their security solution and provided them with indicators of**\n\n**compromise (IOCs) to help root out the active infection. In the process, we were able to confirm the**\n\n**previously described operating procedures for the Poseidon Group.**\n\n**We do not believe this to be a state-sponsored attack but rather a commercial threat player.**\n\n**Collaboration with information-sharing partners and victim institutions allowed us to become aware of**\n\n**the more complicated business cycle involved in this story, greatly adding to our research interest in**\n\n**tracking these campaigns. The malware is designed to function specifically on English and Portuguese-**\n\n**language systems. This is the first ever Portuguese-speaking targeted attack campaign.**\n\n**The attackers have been active for more than ten years. The main distribution of samples goes back to**\n\n**2005 with possible earlier outliers.**\n\n**Operating systems such as Windows 95 for desktop computers and Windows NT for server editions**\n\n**were not uncommon at the time and Poseidon’s team has evolved gradually into targeting the latest**\n\n**flagship editions of Microsoft’s operating systems. Recent samples show interest in Windows 2012**\n\n**Server and Windows 8.1.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**During a particular campaign, conventional Poseidon samples were directed to IPs resolving to satellite**\n\n**uplinks. The networks abused were designed for internet communications with ships at sea which span**\n\n**a greater geographical area at nearly global scale, while providing nearly no security for their**\n\n**downlinks.**\n\n**The malware authors also possess an interesting understanding of execution policies which they**\n\n**leverage to manipulate their victim systems. They combine reconnaissance of GPO (Group Policy**\n\n**Object management for execution) with digitally-signed malware to avoid detection or blocking during**\n\n**their infection phases. These digital certificates are often issued in the name of rogue and legitimate**\n\n**companies to avoid arousing suspicion from researchers and incident responders.**\n\n**Yes, all samples are detected by signatures and also heuristics. With a fully updated Kaspersky Lab**\n\n**anti-malware solution, all customers are protected now. Kaspersky Lab products detect the malware**\n\n**used by Poseidon Group with the following detection names:**\n\n**Backdoor.Win32.Nhopro**\n\n**HEUR:Backdoor.Win32.Nhopro.gen**\n\n**HEUR:Hacktool.Win32.Nhopro.gen**\n\n**At least 35 victim companies have been identified with primary targets including financial and**\n\n**government institutions, telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and other service utility**\n\n**companies, as well as media and public relations firms.**\n\n**The archaeological effort of understanding such a long-standing group can severely complicate victim**\n\n**identification. We see traces of upwards of a few tens of companies targeted. The exact number of the**\n\n**victims may actually vary. Since it is a very long term group, some victims may be impossible to identify**\n\n**now.**\n\n**At this time, we are reaching out to victims of active infections to offer remediation assistance, IOCs,**\n\n**and our full intelligence report to help them counteract this threat. Any victims or potential targets**\n\n**[concerned about this threat should please contact us at intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:///intelreports@kaspersky.com)**\n\n**We do not speculate on attribution. Language code used to compile implants, as well as the language**\n\n**used to describe certain commands used by the group, actually corresponds to Portuguese from Brazil.**\n\n**The inclusion of Portuguese language strings and preference for Portuguese systems is prominent**\n\n**throughout the samples.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**interests.
