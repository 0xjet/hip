    "plain_text": "# Chinese Hacking Spree Hit an ‘Astronomical’ Number of Victims\n\n**[wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/](https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/)**\n\nAndy Greenberg March 5, 2021\n\nWhen news hit earlier this week that Chinese hackers were actively targeting Microsoft\nExchange servers, the cybersecurity community warned that the zero-day vulnerabilities they\nwere exploiting might have allowed them to hit countless organizations around the world.\nNow it's becoming clear just many email servers they hacked. By all appearances, the group\nknown as Hafnium breached as many victims they could find across the global internet,\nleaving behind backdoors to return to later.\n\nHafnium has now exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Exchange servers' Outlook\nWeb Access to indiscriminately compromise no fewer than tens of thousands of email\nservers, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation into the hacking campaign\nwho spoke to WIRED. The intrusions, first spotted by security firm Volexity, began as early as\nJanuary 6, with a noticeable uptick starting last Friday and spiking early this week. The\nhackers appear to have responded to Microsoft's patch, released Tuesday, by ramping up\nand automating their hacking campaign. One security researcher involved in the\ninvestigation who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity put the number of hacked\nExchange servers at more than 30,000 in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands\nworldwide, all apparently by the same group. Independent cybersecurity journalist Brian\nKrebs [first reported that 30,000 figure Friday, citing sources who had briefed national](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/)\nsecurity officials.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s massive. Absolutely massive, one former national security official with knowledge of the\ninvestigation told WIRED. \"We're talking thousands of servers compromised per hour,\nglobally.\"\n\n“It's a ticking time bomb.”\n\nSteven Adair, Volexity\n\nIn a press conference Friday afternoon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned\nanyone running the affected Exchange servers to implement Microsoft's patch for the\nvulnerabilities immediately. \"We are concerned that there are a large number of victims and\nare working with our partners to understand the scope of this,\" Psaki said in a rare instance\nof a White House press secretary commenting on specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\"Network owners also need to consider whether they have already been compromised and\n[should immediately take appropriate steps.\" That White House advice echoed a tweet from](https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1367673471669526528)\nformer Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs on Thursday\nnight advising anyone with an exposed Exchange server to \"assume compromise\" and begin\nincident response measures to remove the hackers' access.\n\nThe affected networks, which likely include those of small and medium-size organizations\nmore than the large enterprises that tend to use cloud-based email systems, appear to have\nbeen hacked indiscriminately via automated scanning. The hackers planted a \"web shell\"—a\nremotely accessible, web-based backdoor foothold—on the Exchange servers they\nexploited, allowing them to perform reconnaissance on the target machines and potentially\nmove to other computers on the network.\n\nThat means only a small number of the hundreds of thousands of hacked servers around the\nworld are likely to be actively targeted by the Chinese hackers, says Volexity founder Steven\nAdair. Nonetheless, any organization that doesn't take pains to remove the hackers'\nbackdoor remains compromised, and the hackers could reenter their networks to steal data\nor cause mayhem until that web shell is removed. \"A massive, massive number of\norganizations are getting that initial foothold,\" says Adair. \"It's a ticking time bomb that can be\nused against them at any point in time.\"\n\nThough the vast majority of intrusions appear to have consisted only of those web shells, the\n\"astronomical\" scale of those global compromises is uniquely disturbing, one security\nresearcher who participated in the investigation told WIRED. The small to medium-size\norganizations that were compromised include local government agencies, police, hospitals,\nCovid response, energy, transportation, airports, and prisons. \"China just owned the world—\nor at least everyone with Outlook Web Access,\" the researcher said. \"When was the last time\nsomeone was so bold as to just hit everyone?\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIn fact, the last such mass intrusion campaign came to light in just December, with the\nrevelation that Russian hackers had compromised IT management tools from Solar Winds'\nused by 18,000 organizations. That hacking campaign successfully breached at least half a\ndozen US federal agencies. The Hafnium Exchange hacking campaign now represents the\nsecond hacking campaign of that scale, just a few months later.\n\nThe Chinese hackers Exchange exploitation spree appears to have begun only months ago,\nin contrast to the Russia's silent, year-plus SolarWinds espionage campaign. And Hafnium's\nvictim list appears more limited to small- and medium-sized organizations, whereas the\nSolarWinds hit large US government agencies.\n\nBut as with the Russian SolarWinds hackers, investigators have yet to identify who exactly\nthe Hafnium hackers are—beyond Microsoft's assertion that they're state-sponsored and\noperate out of China—or to pin down the full extent of their motivations. \"I don't understand\nwhat the strategic objective of maintaining persistence on a local government agency would\nbe for the MSS,\" says the former national security official, referring to China's Ministry of\nState Security. \"Is this a contractor or a proxy group? Is it a Chinese cybercriminal group? Is\nit a rogue actor in China that got out ahead of itself?\"\n\nWhile the hacking campaign may be aimed at casting a wide net before filtering targets for\nespionage, the security researcher who spoke to WIRED warned that it may yet have\ndisruptive effects. \"If they push ransomware to this, we're going to have the worst day ever,\"\nhe says.\n\nBut unlike the SolarWinds incident, the researcher points out, the Exchange-hacking\ncampaign was caught early—or at least early in its widespread use. As daunting as the task\nof cleaning up the hackers' tens of thousands of infections may be, that early detection may\ngive victims a chance to both patch their systems and remove the hackers before they can\ntake advantage of their foothold inside organizations. \"If we had a chance to prevent a\nSolarWinds-scale thing that went on for months, wouldn't we want to act on it?\" asks the\nresearcher. \"Now we have that chance if we act fast.\"\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: [Get our newsletters!](https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories)\n[The Lion, the polygamist, and the biofuel scam](https://www.wired.com/story/lion-polygamist-and-biofuel-scam/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[Clubhouse is booming.
