As a result, today’s malware increasingly\nabuses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).\nStuxnet, one of the most sophisticated worms\nof 2010, affected nuclear processing facilities in\nNatanz, Iran and used WMI to enumerate users and\nspread to available network shares. It also used\nMOF (Managed Object Format) files, the means for\ncreating and registering providers and events for\nWMI. In other words, it (ab)used the WMI - Technique\nT1084, Windows Management Instrumentation Event\n_Subscription, for Persistence, Technique T1087,_\n_Account Discovery, and Technique T1135, Network_\n_Share Discovery, for Discovery and Technique T1105,_\n_Remote File Copy, for Lateral Movement._\n\nThis article details a collection of malware that\nuse WMI to achieve their goal. This compilation\naims to inform security practitioners and decisionmakers about current malicious techniques, each\nin correspondence with the tactics from the MITRE\nAtt&ck Matrix[2], and remind our partners of the\nimportance of proper WMI monitoring in combating\ncyber attacks.\n\nDirect or indirect use of the Management\nInstrumentation may be involved in the following\ntactics, each in correspondence with relevant\ntechniques:\n\n##### Execution\n\n  - Technique T1047, the Windows Management\n**Instrumentation technique;**\n\n  - Technique T1559.001, Inter-Process\n**Communication:** **Component Object Model.**\nInteracting with WMI is done through COM;\n\n  - Technique T1059.001, Command and Scripting\n**Interpreter: PowerShell.

The technique can be achieved, for example,\ndeleting registry keys via WMI, or using wmic.exe to terminate processes;\n\n- Technique T1202, Indirect Command Execution. Often to avoid detection, malware may use Win32_Process WMI\nclass to execute commands, without invoking cmd.exe directly;\n\n- Technique T1112, Modify Registry. StdRegProv WMI class contains methods that manipulate registry keys;\n##### Discovery\n\n- Technique T1087, Account Discovery. The Win32_UserAccount WMI class contains information about a user\naccount on a computer system, the Win32_LoggedOnUser WMI class relates a session and a user account;\n\n- Technique T1083, File and Directory Discovery. The Win32_Directory WMI class can manipulate a directory. The\n_CIM_DataFile WMI class represents a named collection of data. The Win32_ShortcutFile WMI class repesents_\nshortcut files;\n\n- Technique T1135, Network Share Discovery. The Win32_Share WMI class repesents a shared resource;\n\n- Technique T1120, Peripheral Device Discovery. There are a lot of useful WMI classes, such as: Win32_CDROMDrive,\n_Win32_DesktopMonitor, Win32_InfraredDevice, Win32_Keyboard, Win32_Printer, Win32_SerialPort, Win32_USBController,_\n_Win32_VideoControlleretc;_\n\n- Technique T1069, Permission Groups Discovery. The Win32_Group WMI class gives information about a group\naccount, and Win32_GroupUser relates a group and an account that is a member of that group;\n\n- Technique T1057, Process Discovery. The Win32_Process WMI class may offer plenty;\n\n- Technique T1012, Query Registry. You can obtain data from the registry by using the StdRegProv WMI class, as well\nas the Win32_Registry class;\n\n- Technique T1018, Remote System Discovery. The Win32_PingStatus can return data from computers that have both\nIPv4 and IPv6 addresses;\n\n- Technique T1082, System Information Discovery. There are a variety of useful classes, for example Win32_\n_OperatingSystem, Win32_SystemResourcesetc;_\n\n- Technique T1016, System Network Configuration Discovery.

Exfiltration can be achieved using the ManagementScope object\nconnected to a namespace on a remote computer.\n\nDue to the complexity of the Windows Management Instrumentation, this list is not exhaustive. WMI abuse can be\nexecuted in creative ways in other tactics and techniques. However, we hope the enumeration of the above techniques,\nthrough their multitude and variety, inspires the implementation and improvement of detection mechanisms regarding\nthe WMI. As a complement to those mentioned above, we want to present examples of malware currently in the wild\nand how they abuse the WMI using some of the techniques stated above to achieve their goal.\n\n## Technical Analysis. Malware Collection\n\n### Kingminer\n\nA piece of crypto-jacking malware that has been around since 2018, Kingminer continues to evolve, as cyber criminals\ncan still monetize infections in enterprise environments. Some of the malicious techniques adopted by the improved\nKingminer include initial access from SQL Server by brute-force, execution from kernel exploits similar to the WannaCry\ncampaign, as well as Domain Generation Algorithm for evading blacklists, and fileless execution.\n\nThis crypto-jacking malware abuses the Windows Management Instrumentation to check if specific Windows Updates\nare installed on the system and it disables Remote Desktop access to the infected machines.\n\nIn the Execution stage, it abuses the WMI Event Subscription mechanism: one part of the malicious script registers an\nactive script consumer to execute periodically. The WMI event consumer ensures persistence by using the T1546.003,\n_Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription._\n\nFor a complete malware analysis and representative malicious code, we recommend that you further read **Kingminer**\n**Botnet Keeps up with the Times[3].**\n\n### Maze Ransomware\n\nAt the end of May 2019, a new family of ransomware called Maze was grabbing headlines, filling the void left by the\nnow-dismantled GandCrab ransomware. Maze authors implemented an exfiltration mechanism to leverage payment\nand transform an operational issue into a data breach. Using the WMI, Maze manages to destroy any existing Windows\nbackups, such as the Volume Shadow Copies.\n\nBy querying the Win32_ShadowCopy WMI class, it finds the shadows to be deleted in the next phase, also known as\nTechnique T1490, Inhibit System Recovery.\n\nTo better understand Maze ransomware with code examples, we recommend that you take a look at A Malware\n**Researcher’s Guide to Reversing Maze Ransomware[4].**\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\n### Emotet\n\nEmotet, also known as Geodo or Mealybug, was first detected in 2014 and has remained active ever since. The first\nversions functioned as a banking Trojan used to capture banking credentials from victims. Several years later, the\nmalware evolved from a banking-oriented threat to a more generic loader: it gains access to a system and then allows\nthe attackers to drop additional payloads. The second payload may be an executable or a script.\n\nNowadays, the most common entry vector for Emotet is via spearphishing email attachments, also known as\nTechnique T1566.001, Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment. The email usually has a .doc file attached. To persuade the\nuser to execute the malicious VBA, attackers rely on social engineering. Emotet is often the root cause not only for\nbanking attacks, but for cryptocurrency miner and ransomware purposes as well.\n\nIn terms of tactics and techniques, recent versions often use Windows Management Instrumentation. We chose to\npresent Emotet in this article because of its wide distribution in order to show how it goes undetected by relying on\ntechniques that involve WMI. By using mainly Technique T1202, Indirect Command Execution, with the Win32_Process\nWMI class, instead of simply spawning PowerShell directly, sometimes it flies under the radar.\n\nTo configure the startup configuration for the process, it uses also the Win32_ProcessStartup abstract WMI class.\n\n##### A Technical Analysis of Emotet\n\nWe managed to capture one of the infection sources and, looking more closely at the document, we concluded that\nit relies on VBA event procedures. When the file is opened (if macros are enabled), an event that calls the Document_\nOpen() procedure is triggered.\n\nAs an obfuscation technique, the attackers included pieces of code similar to the one below in all stored procedures,\nwhich, in fact, have no effect.\n\nThe code presented next is stripped of the obfuscation blocks mentioned above to make it more readable.\n\nDocument Open() calls Rorsxwhelbf() from Zgwsfixtdhep\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\nThe PowerShell command line is stored using the Yujnbbunz form and decoded using the same mechanism by\nremoving “}{“.\n\nUsing WMI, Emotet manages to break the Process Tree, and often avoid detection if the WMI is not properly monitored.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\n### sLoad\n\nsLoad is a PowerShell downloader that includes noteworthy WMI reconnaissance features. Researchers at Microsoft\nfound version 2.0.1[5], while Bitdefender isolated the improved version 2.7.3, Age of Ultron Edition. How can such\nconcrete data as the version and the edition be presented? In this case, the attackers were generous enough to include\nthem right at the beginning of the malicious script.\n\nWhen talking about sLoad, some researchers often refer to how it uses BITS to filter data. This time, we want\nto give credit for the way it abuses the WMI. In the reconnaissance step, sLoad obtains information about the\nsystem, Technique T1082, System Information Discovery, through the WMI classes Win32_Processor and Win32_\n_OperatingSystem. It also looks for possible shares with the Win32_LogicalDisc class._\n\n##### sLoad Technical Analysis\nThe entry point for this analysis is a PowerShell script with a random name - in our case JWVrjYXZ.ps1. It is based on\nseveral try-except blocks that knowingly generate exceptions.\n\nThe malware reaches the machine in the same way as that presented by the Microsoft Defender ATP Research Team,\nvia email with ZIP attachment.\n\nThe randomly named script is responsible for decoding the ‘system.ini’ file found in the same directory, and executing it\nin memory, without touching the disk.\n\nMicrosoft team calls the 2.0.1 version “Starslord” based on the variable found in $starsLord = Split-Path -parent -resolve\n_$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path; So, I guess we could call version 2.7.3 Sokovia, based on $Sokovia = Split-Path -parent_\n_-resolve $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path; but we will refer it more generally as sLoad._\n\nIt references the copy of BITS Admin tool as $Ultron\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\nFor each C&C address, $InfinityStones represents a random eight-character string, for the BITS transfer job name.\n\n$Wanda points to the full command needed to download the additional files as a <index>_<random selected running\n_procees name>.log_\n\nThe URL translates to “<C&C>/main.php?ch=1&i=<the calculated md5 for the MAC address and the ComputerName\nconcatenated”\n\nIf at least one file is successfully downloaded, it will be marked with the $ad flag, and the content would be saved as\nthe $cryptoKey\n\nIf no file is successfully downloaded, the C&C are re-encrypted with a counter appended to the domain name. For\nexample: hxxps[:]//nbrwer2[.]eu/topic/ and hxxps[:]//joodfbnm2[.]eu/topic/, and it exits, killing PowerShell.\n\nOn success, it looks for shares using WMI class Win32_LogicalDisk\n\nUsing WMI class Win32 processor $Yoda becomes the cpu name Using Win32 OperatingSystem the caption is also\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\nGet a specific list of running processes, by exclusion, creating the $Pietro list\n\nUsing BITS admin via URL parameters, it sends data captured to the attacker in base64 encoding.\n\nIn this case, it actually exfiltrates information using a Download BITS job, with the information passed as URL\nparameters.\n\nIf the exfiltration fails, it exits killing PowerShell. If it fails, there are three supported commands, as follows: eval, iex and\n**run, with the same capabilities described by the Microsoft team:**\n\n- **eval - run PowerShell scripts;**\n\n- **iex - load and invoke PowerShell code;**\n\n- **run - run executables.**\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\n### Miner Downloader\n\nAnother relevant example is a miner downloader that uses the StdRegProv WMI class to manipulate the registry to\ndisable protection mechanisms, which falls into Technique T1112, Modify Registry. To check for internet connectivity at\nthe start of execution, the downloader uses the Win32_PingStatus class to ping well-known sites. The miner’s command\nline allows to specify the IP address to connect to, and in more than a few cases, it connects to a legitimate German\ninfrastructure.\n\n##### Miner Downloader Technical Analysis\nAt first, it tries to create a task with the following command, running at startup as SYSTEM, the highest privilege level. If\nnot enough privileges can be obtained, it fails.\n\nThis means that, to maintain persistence, it needs enough privileges, otherwise it just starts the additional payload\nonce (more on this below).\n\nIt then creates firewall rules so that it adds exception to one of the cscript.exe/ wscript.exe programs.\n\nBD37D891CD1C4ABD9C8C781 is “WindowsIndexCoreUpdate” and BFE path to cscript/ wscript\n\nUsing winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=Impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\CIMV2:Win32_PingStatus.Address= pings well known\nwebsites, exits on the first success\n\nUsing “winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\default:StdRegProv” modifies the Registry to add exclusion\nfor %TEMP% path and to disable Windows Defender components\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\nE16 is &H80000002 and stands for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\n\nTries to retrieve the next stage from the following URLs: “hxxp[:]//gmfordown[.]com/game[.]log”, “hxxp[:]//tor4games[.]\ncom/steam[.]lock” or “hxxp[:]//dvx2videofr[.]com/pack[.]dll” and save it as %TMP%\\\\steam.vbe. If it succeeds, it runs\nthe script. If it fails, it exits.\n\nEvery time it starts, it changes the names of variables and functions, deletes itself and drops the modified version in\n_%AppData%//<random_from_guid>//<random_from_guid>.vbs. The random directory is hidden._\n\nIf the file is a .VBE script, the copy is .VBE too. It decodes it in memory, makes the changes and then encodes it again.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Windows Management Instrumentation offers a plethora of benefits to administrators, but also offers many\nadvantages to malicious actors. Given that WMI allows the orchestration of fileless attacks, we see increased focus\non these techniques in the wild. In terms of both legitimate and malicious use, WMI offers the flexibility to obtain\ninformation about systems, to configure settings even for remote computers and applications, to schedule processes\nto run at specific times, to enable and disable logging and to obtain code execution.\n\nThese features make it an ideal component for malicious actors when it comes to Discovery in particular, but, as\nshown above, it has strong implications in Execution, Persistence, Lateral Movement, Command and Control, and\nExfiltration. Being an atypical, indirect method, it is easily understood that the actions performed through WMI can also\nbe found in the Defense Evasion tactic.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Decade of WMI Abuse – an Overview of Techniques in Modern Malware\n\nThe crypto-jacking Kingminer has continued to evolve since its debut in 2018, with the current version using the\nnotorious Technique T1546.003, Event Triggered Execution: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription.\nEven more, WMI is present in more subtle places, used to check if specific Windows Updates are installed, and to\nblock Remote Desktop access on infected machines. When it comes to ransomware, the Windows Management\nInstrumentation can also play an important role. As an example, we chose to present Maze, where Windows backups\nare destroyed with the help of WMI. Shifting our attention towards the realm of Bankers, we can identify the use of WMI\nin the current versions of the well-known Emotet. Thanks to Technique T1202, Indirect Command Execution, it manages\nto evade detection from some security products. The PowerShell downloader, sLoad, is often mentioned for abusing\nBITS, but we have come to the conclusion that it’s not the only ace up its sleeve.\n\nSLoad can use some WMI classes in the Discovery step, classes such as Win32_Processor, Win32_OperatingSystem and\n_Win32_LogicalDisc to obtain system information. We chose to complete the list of examples with a miner downloader,_\nin which the registry is manipulated through WMI to disable protection mechanisms, Technique T1112, Modify Registry.\nIn addition, it ensures its internet connectivity through the Win32_PingStatus class, pinging well-known websites.\n\nWhile WMI abuse has been going on for nearly a decade, it continues to evolve. Today it can take place in multiple\ncreative scenarios, affecting a significant number of techniques. From Stuxnet onwards, modern malware incorporates\nevasion techniques based on WMI, and unfortunately these small pieces can make the difference between a stopped\nattack and total compromise.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[1] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page, Microsoft Docs, Windows Management\n_Instrumentation_\n\n[2] https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/windows/, Mitre, Windows ATT&CK Matrix\n\n[3] https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/354/Bitdefender-PR-Whitepaper-KingMiner-creat4610en-EN-GenericUse.pdf, Bitdefender Labs, Kingminer - a Crypto-Jacking Botnet Under the Scope\n\n[4] https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/News/CaseStudies/study/318/Bitdefender-TRR-WhitepaperMaze-creat4351-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf, Bitdefender Labs, A Technical Look into Maze Ransomware\n\n[5] https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/01/21/sload-launches-version-2-0-starslord/, Microsoft Defender\n**ATP Research Team, sLoad launches version 2.0, Starslord**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Proudly Serving Our Customers Dedicated To Our +20.000 Worldwide Partners\nBitdefender provides solutions and services for small business and A channel-exclusive vendor, Bitdefender is proud to share success with tens of\nmedium enterprises, service providers and technology integrators.
