This includes compromises of Cambodian\ngovernment entities charged with overseeing the elections, as well as the targeting of opposition figures. This campaign occurs in the\nrun up to the country’s July 29, 2018, general elections. TEMP.Periscope used the same infrastructure for a range of activity against\nother more traditional targets, including the defense industrial base in the United States and a chemical company based in Europe.\nOur previous blog post focused on the group’s [targeting of engineering and maritime entities in the United States.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries)\n\nOverall, this activity indicates that the group maintains an extensive intrusion architecture and wide array of malicious tools, and\ntargets a large victim set, which is in line with typical Chinese-based APT efforts. We expect this activity to provide the Chinese\ngovernment with widespread visibility into Cambodian elections and government operations. Additionally, this group is clearly able to\nrun several large-scale intrusions concurrently across a wide range of victim types.\n\nOur analysis also strengthened our overall attribution of this group. We observed the toolsets we previously attributed to this group,\ntheir observed targets are in line with past group efforts and also highly similar to known Chinese APT efforts, and we identified an IP\naddress originating in Hainan, China that was used to remotely access and administer a command and control (C2) server.\n\n**TEMP.Periscope Background**\n\n\n-----\n\nActive since at least 2013, TEMP.Periscope has primarily focused on maritime related targets across multiple verticals, including\nengineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities (targeting is\nsummarized in Figure 1). The group has also targeted professional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, and\nmedia/publishing. TEMP.Periscope overlaps in targeting, as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with TEMP.Jumper, a\n[group that also overlaps significantly with public reporting by Proofpoint and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets) [F-Secure on \"NanHaiShu.\"](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/nanhaishu_whitepaper.pdf)\n\nSummary of TEMP.Periscope activity\n\nFigure 1: Summary of TEMP.Periscope activity\n\n**Incident Background**\n\nFireEye analyzed files on three open indexes believed to be controlled by TEMP.Periscope, which yielded insight into the group's\nobjectives, operational tactics, and a significant amount of technical attribution/validation. These files were \"open indexed\" and thus\naccessible to anyone on the public internet. This TEMP.Periscope activity on these servers extends from at least April 2017 to the\npresent, with the most current operations focusing on Cambodia's government and elections.\n\nTwo servers, chemscalere[.]com and scsnewstoday[.]com, operate as typical C2 servers and hosting sites, while the third,\nmlcdailynews[.]com, functions as an active SCANBOX server. The C2 servers contained both logs and malware.\nAnalysis of logs from the three servers revealed:\n\nPotential actor logins from an IP address located in Hainan, China that was used to remotely access and administer the\nservers, and interact with malware deployed at victim organizations.\nMalware command and control check-ins from victim organizations in the education, aviation, chemical, defense,\ngovernment, maritime, and technology sectors across multiple regions. FireEye has notified all of the victims that we were\nable to identify.\nThe malware present on the servers included both new families (DADBOD, EVILTECH) and previously identified malware\nfamilies (AIRBREAK, EVILTECH, HOMEFRY, MURKYTOP, HTRAN, and SCANBOX) .\n\n**Compromises of Cambodian Election Entities**\n\nAnalysis of command and control logs on the servers revealed compromises of multiple Cambodian entities, primarily those relating to\nthe upcoming July 2018 elections. In addition, a separate spear phishing email analyzed by FireEye indicates concurrent targeting of\nopposition figures within Cambodia by TEMP.Periscope.\n\nAnalysis indicated that the following Cambodian government organizations and individuals were compromised by TEMP.Periscope:\n\nNational Election Commission, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Cambodian\nSenate, Ministry of Economics and Finance\nMember of Parliament representing Cambodia National Rescue Party\nMultiple Cambodians advocating human rights and democracy who have written critically of the current ruling party\nTwo Cambodian diplomats serving overseas\nMultiple Cambodian media entities\n\nTEMP.Periscope sent a spear phish with AIRBREAK malware to Monovithya Kem, Deputy Director-General, Public Affairs, Cambodia\nNational Rescue Party (CNRP), and the daughter of (imprisoned) Cambodian opposition party leader Kem Sokha (Figure 2). The\ndecoy document purports to come from LICADHO (a non-governmental organization [NGO] in Cambodia established in 1992 to\npromote human rights). This sample leveraged scsnewstoday[.]com for C2.\n\nHuman right protection survey lure\n\nFigure 2: Human right protection survey lure\n\nThe decoy document \"Interview Questions.docx\" (MD5: ba1e5b539c3ae21c756c48a8b5281b7e) is tied to AIRBREAK downloaders of\nthe same name. The questions reference the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party, human rights, and the election (Figure 3).\n\nInterview questions decoy\n\nFigure 3: Interview questions decoy\n\n**Infrastructure Also Used for Operations Against Private Companies**\n\nThe aforementioned malicious infrastructure was also used against private companies in Asia, Europe and North America. These\ncompanies are in a wide range of industries, including academics, aviation, chemical, maritime, and technology. A MURKYTOP\nsample from 2017 and data contained in a file linked to chemscalere[.]com suggest that a corporation involved in the U.S. defense\n\n\n-----\n\nindustrial base (DIB) industry, possibly related to maritime research, was compromised. Many of these compromises are in line with\nTEMP.Periscope’s previous activity targeting maritime and defense industries. However, we also uncovered the compromise of a\nEuropean chemical company with a presence in Asia, demonstrating that this group is a threat to business worldwide, particularly\nthose with ties to Asia.\n\n**AIRBREAK Downloaders and Droppers Reveal Lure Indicators**\n\nFilenames for AIRBREAK downloaders found on the open indexed sites also suggest the ongoing targeting of interests associated\nwith Asian geopolitics. In addition, analysis of AIRBREAK downloader sites revealed a related server that underscores\nTEMP.Periscope's interest in Cambodian politics.\n\nThe AIRBREAK downloaders in Table 1 redirect intended victims to the indicated sites to display a legitimate decoy document while\ndownloading an AIRBREAK payload from one of the identified C2s. Of note, the hosting site for the legitimate documents was not\ncompromised. An additional C2 domain, partyforumseasia[.]com, was identified as the callback for an AIRBREAK downloader\nreferencing the Cambodian National Rescue Party.\n\n**Redirect Site (Not Malicious)** **AIRBREAK Downloader** **AIRBREAK C2**\n\n\nen.freshnewsasia.com/index.php/en/8623-2018-04-26-1012-46.html\n\n\nTOP_NEWS_Japan_to_Support_the_Election.js\n\n(3c51c89078139337c2c92e084bb0904c)\n\n[Figure 4]\n\n\nchemscalere[.]com\n\nscsnewstoday[.]com\n\nmlcdailynews[.]com\n\nPartyforumseasia[.]com\n\n\niric.gov.kh/LICADHO/Interview-Questions.pdf [pdf]Interview-Questions.pdf.js\n\n(e413b45a04bf5f812912772f4a14650f)\n\niric.gov.kh/LICADHO/Interview-Questions.pdf [docx]Interview-Questions.docx.js\n\n(cf027a4829c9364d40dcab3f14c1f6b7)\n\nunknown Interview_Questions.docx.js\n\n(c8fdd2b2ddec970fa69272fdf5ee86cc)\n\n\natimes.com/article/philippines-draws-three-hard-newlines-on-china/\n\n\nPhilippines-draws-three-hard-new-lines-onchina .js\n\n(5d6ad552f1d1b5cfe99ddb0e2bb51fd7)\n\n\nfacebook.com/CNR.Movement/videos/190313618267633/ CNR.Movement.mp4.js\n\n(217d40ccd91160c152e5fce0143b16ef)\n\nTable 1: AIRBREAK downloaders\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document associated with AIRBREAK downloader file\nTOP_NEWS_Japan_to_Support_the_Election.js\n\nFigure 4: Decoy document associated with AIRBREAK downloader file TOP_NEWS_Japan_to_Support_the_Election.js\n\n**SCANBOX Activity Gives Hints to Future Operations**\n\nThe active SCANBOX server, mlcdailynews[.]com, is hosting articles related to the current Cambodian campaign and broader\noperations. Articles found on the server indicate targeting of those with interests in U.S.-East Asia geopolitics, Russia and NATO\naffairs. Victims are likely either brought to the SCANBOX server via strategic website compromise or malicious links in targeted emails\nwith the article presented as decoy material. The articles come from open-source reporting readily available online. Figure 5 is a\nSCANBOX welcome page and Table 2 is a list of the articles found on the server.\n\n\nSCANBOX welcome page\n\n\nFigure 5: SCANBOX welcome page\n\n**Copied Article Topic** **Article Source (Not**\n**Compromised)**\n\n\n-----\n\nLeaders confident yet nervous Khmer Times\n\nMahathir_ 'We want to be friendly with China\n\nPM urges voters to support CPP for peace\n\nCPP determined to maintain Kingdom's peace and development\n\nBun Chhay's wife dies at 60\n\nCrackdown planned on boycott callers\n\nFurther floods coming to Kingdom\n\nKem Sokha again denied bail\n\nPM vows to stay on as premier to quash traitors\n\nIran_ Don't trust Trump Fresh News\n\nKim-Trump summit_ Singapore's role\n\nTrump's North Korea summit may bring peace declaration - but at a cost Reuters\n\nU.S. pushes NATO to ready more forces to deter Russian threat\n\nus-nato-russia_us-pushes-nato-to-ready-more-forces-to-deter-russian-threat\n\nInterior Minister Sar Kheng warns of dirty tricks Phnom Penh Post\n\nAnother player to enter market for cashless pay\n\n\nDonald Trump says he has 'absolute right' to pardon himself but he's done nothing wrong Donald Trump's America\n\n\nABC News\n\n\nChina-funded national road inaugurated in Cambodia The Cambodia Daily\n\nKim and Trump in first summit session in Singapore Asia Times\n\nU.S. to suspend military exercises with South Korea, Trump says U.S. News\n\nRainsy defamed the King_ Hun Sen BREAKING NEWS\n\ncambodia-opposition-leader-denied-bail-again-in-treason-case Associated Press\n\nTable 2: SCANBOX articles copied to server\n\n**TEMP.Periscope Malware Suite**\n\nAnalysis of the malware inventory contained on the three servers found a classic suite of TEMP.Periscope payloads, including the\nsignature AIRBREAK, MURKYTOP, and HOMEFRY. In addition, FireEye’s analysis identified new tools, EVILTECH and DADBOD\n(Table 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware** **Function** **Details**\n\nEVILTECH Backdoor EVILTECH is a JavaScript sample that implements a simple RAT with support for uploading,\ndownloading, and running arbitrary JavaScript.\nDuring the infection process, EVILTECH is run on the system, which then causes a redirect and\npossibly the download of additional malware or connection to another attacker-controlled system.\n\n\nDADBOD Credential\nTheft\n\n\nDADBOD is a tool used to steal user cookies.\nAnalysis of this malware is still ongoing.\n\n\nTable 3: New additions to the TEMP.Periscope malware suite\n\n**Data from Logs Strengthens Attribution to China**\n\nOur analysis of the servers and surrounding data in this latest campaign bolsters our previous assessment that TEMP.Periscope is\nlikely Chinese in origin. Data from a control panel access log indicates that operators are based in China and are operating on\ncomputers with Chinese language settings.\n\nA log on the server revealed IP addresses that had been used to log in to the software used to communicate with malware on victim\nmachines. One of the IP addresses, 112.66.188.28, is located in Hainan, China. Other addresses belong to virtual private servers, but\nartifacts indicate that the computers used to log in all cases are configured with Chinese language settings.\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nThe activity uncovered here offers new insight into TEMP.Periscope’s activity. We were previously aware of this actor’s interest in\nmaritime affairs, but this compromise gives additional indications that it will target the political system of strategically important\ncountries. Notably, Cambodia has served as a reliable supporter of China’s South China Sea position in international forums such as\nASEAN and is an important partner. While Cambodia is rated as Authoritarian by the Economist’s Democracy Index, the recent\nsurprise upset of the ruling party in Malaysia may motivate China to closely monitor Cambodia’s July 29 elections.\n\nThe targeting of the election commission is particularly significant, given the critical role it plays in facilitating voting. There is not yet\nenough information to determine why the organization was compromised – simply gathering intelligence or as part of a more complex\noperation. Regardless, this incident is the most recent example of aggressive nation-state intelligence collection on election processes\nworldwide.\n\nWe expect TEMP.Periscope to continue targeting a wide range of government and military agencies, international organizations, and\nprivate industry. However focused this group may be on maritime issues, several incidents underscore their broad reach, which has\nincluded European firms doing business in Southeast Asia and the internal affairs of littoral nations. FireEye expects TEMP.Periscope\nwill remain a virulent threat for those operating in the area for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n-----",
