However, analysis of Yanluowang and Thieflock does not provide any evidence\nof shared authorship. Instead, the most likely hypothesis is that these Yanluowang attacks\n[may be carried out by a former Thieflock affiliate,” the researchers say.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/yanluowang-ransomware-attacks-continue)\n\n## Tools of the trade\n\nAfter gaining access to the target network, the attacker uses PowerShell to download tools,\nsuch as the BazarLoader malware to help with moving laterally.\n\nBazarLoader is delivered to corporate targets by the TrickBot botnet, which also\n[spreads Conti ransomware. More recently, TrickBot operators started to help rebuilding the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-is-back-and-rebuilding-its-botnet-via-trickbot/)\nEmotet botnet.\n\nThe Yanluowang threat actor enables the remote desktop service (RDP) from the registry\nand installs the ConnectWise tool for remote access.\n\nThe researchers say that the affiliate discovers systems of interest with the AdFind tool - to\nquery the Active Directory, and SoftPerfect Network Scanner - to find hostnames and\nnetwork services.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral tools are used to steal credentials from the browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Internet\nExplorer) of compromised machines: GrabFF, GrabChrome, BrowserPassView.\n\nSymantec’s researchers also noticed that the attacker used KeeThief to steal the master\nkey for the KeePass password manager, a screen capture tool, and the data exfiltration\nutility Filegrab.\n\nIn a previous report about Yanluowang attacks, the company said that the hackers\nthreatened with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and data wiping attacks if the victim did\nnot comply with the demands.\n\nToday's [report on the Yanluowang affiliate includes indicators of compromise for the tools](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/yanluowang-ransomware-attacks-continue)\nand malware used in the attack.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Affiliates](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/affiliates/)\n[FiveHands](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/fivehands/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Yanluowang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/yanluowang/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
