Loss of USD $300 million by shipping giant\nMaersk,[1] interruptions in production at Renault and Nissan plants,[2] and a ransomware attack on\nthe San Francisco public transit system[3] are only a few recent examples that have made headlines.\n\nSecuring industrial control systems (ICS) is a critical factor in ensuring the overall information security of critical facilities and infrastructure. Many efforts have been made to promote ICS security: governments are developing regulatory frameworks, computer emergency response teams\n(CERT) are issuing bulletins, and ICS vendors are gaining awareness that vulnerabilities in their\nproducts can cause loss of lucrative contracts[4] and even lives.\n\nDespite these efforts—and in the face of mounting incident costs and concern—security at most\nindustrial facilities has shown minimal improvement since the Stuxnet attacks of 2010, as illustrated in this report.\n\nThe problem is worsened by the tendency to connect ICS equipment to the Internet, which is\nlikely to intensify with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Such connections set the\nstage for attacks by hackers from anywhere in the world, even without direct physical access to\ntarget equipment.\n\nNowadays, almost any advanced Internet user can look up the IP addresses of network equipment\nused on ICS networks (such as switches, interface converters, and gateways) with the help of publicly available search engines. When this equipment is hacked, building systems and operations\nare at high risk. In 2017, we found that vulnerabilities in such equipment are becoming an increasingly common occurrence.[5]\n\nThis report, our fourth on the subject, describes findings by Positive Technologies regarding vulnerabilities in ICS components and their prevalence on Internet-connected systems, and how this\nsituation has evolved over recent years.\n\n### ABBREVIATIONS USED\n\n**DCS—distributed control systems**\n\n**HMI—human–machine interface**\n\n**ICS—industrial control system**\n\n**LAN—local area network**\n\n**PLC—programmable logic controller**\n\n**RAP—remote access point**\n\n**RTU—remote terminal unit**\n\n**SCADA—supervisory control and data acquisition**\n\n[1 bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/maersk-misses-estimates-as-cyberattack-set-to-hurt-third-quarter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/maersk-misses-estimates-as-cyberattack-set-to-hurt-third-quarter)\n[2 businessinsider.com/renault-nissan-production-halt-wannacry-ransomeware-attack-2017-5](http://www.businessinsider.com/renault-nissan-production-halt-wannacry-ransomeware-attack-2017-5)\n[3 theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/passengers-free-ride-san-francisco-muni-ransomeware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/passengers-free-ride-san-francisco-muni-ransomeware)\n4 In December 2017, oil transporter Transneft announced that it would cease use of Schneider Electric equipment due to multiple\nvulnerabilities jeopardizing the company’s cybersecurity\n5 Examples of attacks leveraging network equipment will be described in a separate report, which will be released at a later date\n[on ptsecurity.com](http://www.ptsecurity.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n### VULNERABILITIES IN ICS COMPONENTS\n\n#### Research methodology\n\nInformation was drawn from publicly available sources, such as vulnerability knowledge bases,\nvendor advisories, exploit databases and packs, research papers, and posts on security websites\nand blogs.[6]\n\nThe following vulnerability knowledge bases were used:\n\n**+** [ICS-CERT (ics-cert.us-cert.gov)](http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov)\n**+** [NVD (nvd.nist.gov), CVE (cve.mitre.org)](http://nvd.nist.gov)\n**+** [Positive Research Center (securitylab.ru/lab)](http://securitylab.ru/lab)\n**+** Schneider Electric Cybersecurity Support Portal[7]\n\n**+** [Siemens Product CERT (siemens.com/cert)](http://siemens.com/cert)\n\nThe severity of vulnerabilities in ICS components was assessed based on the Common Vulnerability\n[Scoring System (CVSS) version 3 (first.org/cvss).](http://first.org/cvss)\n\nOur assessment of disclosed vulnerabilities did not attempt to cover every single vendor of industrial automation equipment, instead focusing on larger and more prominent companies.\n\n#### Trends\n\nThe number of new vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017 increased compared to the prior year. As of\npublication of this report, information about 197 vulnerabilities of major manufacturers had been\npublished. However, this number could still increase due to responsible disclosure policies, since\nvulnerabilities often are not published until after they have been fixed. For example, 30 vulnerabilities in Moxa equipment were detected in 2016 but disclosed only in 2017.\n\n2017\n\n197\n\n2016\n\n115\n\n2015\n\n212\n\n2014\n\n181\n\n2013\n\n158\n\n\n0\n\n\n25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225\n\nNumber of new vulnerabilities found in ICS components\n\n\n#### Vulnerabilities by vendor\n\nThe top spots saw a reversal of positions. The previous leader, Siemens, yielded first place to\nSchneider Electric, whose 47 component vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017 exceeded the company’s total for 2016 (5) by almost ten times. Also notable is the increased number of security flaws in\nMoxa industrial network equipment, with twice as many (36) as in the previous year (18).\n\n[6 digitalbond.com, scadahacker.com, immunityinc.com/products/canvas, exploit-db.com, rapid7.com/db](http://digitalbond.com)\n[7 schneider-electric.com/b2b/en/support/cybersecurity/report-an-incident.jsp](http://schneider-electric.com/b2b/en/support/cybersecurity/report-an-incident.jsp)\n\n\n-----\n\n47\n\nMoxa\n\n36\n\nSiemens\n\n32\n\nAdvantech\n\n17\n\nSMA\n\n14\n\nRockwell Automation\n\n11\n\nHoneywell\n\n8\n\nPhoenix Contact\n\n4\n\nHirschmann (Belden)\n\n4\n\nABB\n\n4\n\nSpiderControl\n\n3\n\nWestermo\n\n3\n\nOther\n\n14\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nNumber of vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017 by major ICS vendors\n\n#### Vulnerabilities by component type\n\nThe core trend we see is the growing number of new vulnerabilities in industrial network equipment. Security flaws were detected in Moxa (36), Hirschmann (4), and Phoenix Contact (4) products. While the number of vulnerabilities in network equipment disclosed in 2016 was a third less\nthan in SCADA/HMI/DCS devices,[8] the subsequent 12 months narrowed that gap.\n\n8% 31%\n14%\n\nSCADA/HMI/DCS\n\nNetwork equipment\n\nSoftware\n\nPLC/RAP\n\nOther\n\n|Col1|Schneider Electric Moxa Siemens Advantech SMA Rockwell Automation Honeywell Phoenix Contact 4 Hirschmann (Belden) 4 ABB 4 SpiderControl 3 Westermo 3 Other|14 11 8 14|17|3 32|6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n19%\n\n\n28%\n\n\nLocalization of new vulnerabilities in ICS components\n\n8 ICS components for supervision and monitoring\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most common types of vulnerabilities were Information Disclosure, Remote Code Execution,\nand Buffer Overflow.

To obtain the research materials, we scanned ports of Internet-accessible\n[components using publicly accessible search engines: Google, Shodan (shodan.io), and Censys](http://shodan.io)\n[(censys.io).](http://censys.io)\n\nPassive techniques for gathering data about the Internet accessibility of ICS components have\nseveral limitations:\n\n**+** Shodan scans a limited number of ports and performs scanning of the Internet from specific IP\naddresses, which are blacklisted by some firewall vendors and administrators. Therefore, data\nfrom Google and Censys was used to expand the scope of assessment.\n\n**+** In many cases, it was not possible to determine product versions, because the necessary information was not given in the banners returned by host servers.\n\nThis data was then specially analyzed to identify which results corresponded to ICS equipment.\nOur experts created a database of ICS identifiers for determining product and vendor based on a\ndevice’s banner.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Prevalence\n\nThe research revealed 175,632 ICS components accessible online.\n\nLooking at the protocols used by the detected ICS components, the most common protocol was\nHTTP, which is consistent with recent years. The Fox protocol was also very popular: it is used\nin Niagara Framework products and most commonly seen in automation systems for buildings,\nfacilities, and data centers. These systems control air conditioning, power supply, telecommunications, alarms, lighting, security cameras, and other important building systems. Such automation\nsystems often contain vulnerabilities[9] and have already been attacked in the wild.[10]\n\nHTTP\n\n66,587\n\nFOX\n\n39,168\n\nEthernet/IP\n\n25,631\n\nBACnet\n\n13,717\n\nLantronix Discovery Protocol\n\n9,937\n\nSNMP\n\n6,668\n\nCODESYS\n\n1,953\n\nModbus\n\n1,910\n\nFTP\n\n1,643\n\nFINS\n\n1,098\n\nRedLion\n\n976\n\nTelnet\n\n897\n\nPCWorx\n\n752\n\nIEC 60870-5-104\n\n410\n\nS7 Communication\n\n337\n\nDNP3\n\n320\n\nOther\n\n401\n\n0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000\n\nNumber of Internet-accessible ICS components, by protocol\n\n[9 ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-12-228-01A](http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-12-228-01A)\n[10 info.publicintelligence.net/FBI-AntisecICS.pdf](http://info.publicintelligence.net/FBI-AntisecICS.pdf)\n\n|I|HTTP FOX Ethernet/IP BACnet Lantronix Discovery Pro SNMP CODESYS 1,953 Modbus 1,910 FTP 1,643 FINS 1,098 RedLion 976 Telnet 897 PCWorx 752 EC 60870-5-104 410 S7 Communication 337 DNP3 320 Other 401|13,71 tocol 9,937 6,668|25 7|,631|39,168|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Changes in Russia\n\nIn 2017, Russia jumped up three\npositions to number 28 in the\nlist of countries. The number of\ndetected ICS components grew\nfrom 591 in 2016 to 892 in 2017.\nThese changes suggest a growing\ndanger caused by an increasing\nnumber of Internet-accessible ICS\ncomponents located in Russia.\n\n\n#### Geographic distribution\n\nThe U.S. has held the top spot for some years now, increasing its commanding lead of Internetaccessible components by 10% in the last year to around 42% of the total.

Some Niagara\nproducts retain their old brand, which is why Tridium is listed separately from Honeywell in this\nreport.\n\nThe second most popular vendor is Lantronix. This California-based company manufactures devices designed to provide remote access to equipment via the Internet.\n\nHoneywell\n\n26,813\n\nLantronix\n\n12,120\n\nSMA\n\n9,399\n\nBeck IPC\n\n9,362\n\nSiemens\n\n6,069\n\nRockwell Automation\n\n5,594\n\nMoxa\n\n4,759\n\nSchneider Electric\n\n4,232\n\nTridium\n\n2,672\n\nEchelon\n\n2,437\n\n3S-Smart Software Solutions\n\n2,156\n\nWestermo\n\n1,850\n\nBosch\n\n1,672\n\nSofrel Lacroix\n\n1,619\n\nWAGO\n\n1,267\n\nSoftPLC\n\n1,160\n\nSpiderControl\n\n1,121\n\n0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000\n\nNumber of Internet-accessible ICS components, by vendor\n\nAccording to recent research,[11] several thousand Lantronix interface converters are accessible on\nthe Internet. Almost half of these devices expose passwords that could be used to connect via\nTelnet. Our research confirms this fact: we detected 12,120 accessible Lantronix devices in total, a\nnumber of which were vulnerable.\n\nDespite their auxiliary role, these devices can pose a significant hazard to operations when connected to the Internet. Interface converters connect ICS components to each other, so any malfunction\nor failure on their part can cause loss of remote control and management. For example, during a cyberattack on the Ukrainian energy grid,[12] the attackers remotely disrupted the functioning of Moxa\nconverters. As a result, utility operators could no longer connect to field devices at substations or\nremotely control substation switches.\n\nAs in prior years, Niagara Framework is the software most commonly found on Internet-accessible\nequipment. Apart from Lantronix interface converters, which hold second place, Moxa converters\nare also close to the top.\n\n[11 bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-serial-to-ethernet-devices-leak-telnet-passwords/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-serial-to-ethernet-devices-leak-telnet-passwords/)\n[12 boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out.pdf](http://boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out.pdf)\n\n|Honeywell Lantronix SMA Beck IPC Siemens Rockwell Automation Moxa Schneider Electric Tridium 2,6 Echelon 2,4 3S-Smart Software Solu 2,15 Westermo 1,850 Bosch 1,672 Sofrel Lacroix 1,619 WAGO 1,267 SoftPLC 1,160 SpiderControl 1,121|6,069 5,594 4,759 4,232 72 37 tions 6|12,1 9,399 9,362|20|Col5|26,81|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Niagara Framework Lantronix Serial Conver Sunny WebBox IPC@CHIP Allen-Bradley Device Moxa Nport Siemens Building Tech i.LON SmartServer 2,22 3S-Smart Software Solu 1,953 Bosch Security Systems 1,672 Westermo MRD-310 1,647 Sofrel S500 1,619 WebRTU 1,383 Niagara Web 1,372 Niagara AX station 1,300|ter 4,906 4,589 nologies HMI Panel 4,310 0 tions Device|9,937 9,399 9,362|Col4|Col5|24,858|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000\n\nInternet-accessible ICS components, by product\n\n#### Types of ICS components\n\nThe distribution of Internet-accessible components by types remained almost the same.

More than half of the detected vulnerabilities are of critical or high severity.\n\nThe number of Internet-accessible ICS components is growing. The majority of them were detected in the countries with the highest levels of industrial automation (U.S., Germany, France, Canada,\nItaly, and China).\n\nAn increase in the number of known vulnerabilities and Internet-accessible ICS components allows\nattackers to conduct a wider range of attacks, which can cause very tangible impacts. Responding\nto sophisticated attacks on ICS components requires large amounts of preparation and planning.\nBefore the first line of code is ever written, ICS developers must design the security mechanisms\nnecessary to protect ICS components from attacks.\n\nTo identify potential attack vectors and develop an effective protection system, companies should\nperform regular ICS security audits and deploy industrial cybersecurity incident management\nsolutions.\n\nAs always, observing the following basic security guidelines goes a long way toward ensuring\nprotection:\n\n**+** Segregate ICS operational networks from the enterprise LAN and external networks.\n**+** Limit physical access to ICS networks and components.\n**+** Enforce a strict password policy.\n**+** Properly configure network equipment and firewall filtering rules.\n**+** Protect privileged accounts.\n**+** Minimize privileges of users and services.\n**+** Use antivirus software.\n**+** Regularly install updates to operating systems and applications.\n\nAbout Positive Technologies\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and compliance\nmanagement, incident and threat analysis, and application protection.
