This specific\n[vulnerability, identified by researchers at DEVCORE, is also referred to as](https://devco.re/en/about/)\n[ProxyLogon.](https://proxylogon.com/)\n[CVE-2021-26857: a privilege escalation vulnerability allowing an attacker with code](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857)\nexecution to run commands as SYSTEM.\n[CVE-2021-26858: a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858)\nallowing an attacker to write contents to any accessible part of the victim system.\n[CVE-2021-27065: another post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26865)\n\nUsed together, these vulnerabilities allow for remote access to an exposed Microsoft\nExchange instance, follow-on code execution at privileged levels, and the ability to establish\npersistence on the victim system. DEVCORE research started in October 2020, with\n\n\n-----\n\nacknowledgement from Microsoft that the SSRF vulnerability ProxyLogon existed on 06\nJanuary 2021.\n\nIn coordination with Microsoft’s release, information security company Volexity released its\nown report covering intrusion activity utilizing this exploitation chain, referred to as\nOperation Exchange Marauder, since 03 January 2021—interestingly, a few days prior to\nMicrosoft’s acknowledgment of the vulnerability . Independently of Microsoft and Volexity,\n[FireEye also released reporting on overlapping exploitation activity taking place since](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\nJanuary 2021, although no precise date was provided in their post.\n\nFollowing disclosure on 02 March 2021, multiple parties reported odd activity prior to\nrelease and substantial increases in Exchange targeting shortly thereafter. Most notably,\n[several](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/a-basic-timeline-of-the-exchange-mass-hack/) [entities reported widespread scanning of Microsoft Exchange servers just prior to](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach/as-hafnium-timeline-crystalizes-signs-of-new-microsoft-exchange-server-attacks-emerge/)\nMicrosoft’s vulnerability disclosure, from 27 to 28 February 2021.\n\nFurthermore, multiple sources revealed that, while public reporting indicated initial\nexploitation in tracked campaigns started in January 2021, such activity may extend as far\n[back as November 2020. Given that public timelines from DEVCORE indicated research](https://proxylogon.com/#timeline)\nand analysis only began in October 2020 with vulnerability discovery in December 2020, the\npossibility of public exploitation in late 2020 raises a number of questions—sadly none of\nwhich can be answered with current evidence.\n\n\n-----\n\nIrrespective of when public exploitation of CVE-2021-26855 started, based on the spike in\nscanning activity identified just prior to Microsoft’s announcement and subsequent activity,\noperations appear to have increased rapidly after disclosure. Within days of Microsoft’s\nannouncement and corresponding blogs from DEVCORE, Volexity, and others, various\n[public Proof of Concepts (POCs) appeared from independent](https://github.com/jsdryan/CVE-2021-26855/blob/main/CVE-2021-26855.go) [researchers and](https://gist.github.com/testanull/fabd8eeb46f120c4b15f8793617ca7d1) [security](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/reproducing-proxylogon-exploit/)\n[firms starting 09 March 2021. If not already the case previously, exploitation of CVE-2021-](https://github.com/sophoslabs/metasploit_gather_exchange)\n26855 and related vulnerabilities in the exploit chain took off such that multiple entities—\nfrom opportunistic state-sponsored organizations through likely criminal elements—are\nactively looking for and taking advantage of these security issues.\n\n## Webshell Payloads\n\nRegardless of how or when malicious actors learned of these vulnerabilities in Microsoft\nExchange and began using them, through at least 09 March 2021 adversary actions\nremained relatively static: either leverage process execution to gather system information\nand dump credentials and other items for memory; or utilize the exploitation chain to install\na [webshell on victim Exchange instances. The former utilized a number of common,](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/how-web-shells-work/)\n[publicly-available (and even legitimate) tools such as ProcDump,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) [Covenant, and](https://www.kitploit.com/2019/08/covenant-net-command-and-control.html) [Nishang.](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)\nThe latter, while opening up possibilities for a number of actions for webshell installation\nand function, stands out as the majority of observed instances across multiple vendors\n[reflect a long-lived, well-known, essentially publicly-available framework: China](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-china-chopper.pdf) [Chopper.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/08/china-chopper-still-active-9-years-later.html)\n\nThe China Chopper webshell framework first appeared no later than 2010. Since China\nChopper’s discovery, researchers linked the tool to operations from a variety of entities,\nranging from state-sponsored espionage campaigns through cyber criminal elements.\nAlthough historical China Chopper use is associated with threats physically located in\nChina, subsequent disclosures and widespread availability mean, as noted by researchers\nat Cisco Talos, that:\n\n_“This web shell is widely available, so almost any threat actor can use [it]. This also_\n_means it's nearly impossible to attribute attacks to a particular group using only [the]_\n_presence of China Chopper as an indicator.”_\n\n[While initial access vectors to victims included the exploitation of four zero day](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/what-is-a-zero-day-exploit.html)\nvulnerabilities until disclosure on 02 March 2021, this activity concluded with deployment of\na commodity, widely known webshell capability. We therefore observe a significant\ndisconnect between intrusion methodologies (technically complex and non-public) and\nfollow-on actions on objective (use of widely known, commodity tools). Although\nadversaries are ultimately judged on how successful their operations are, and this particular\ncampaign appears to be very successful, as opposed to their technical complexity, this\ndivergence between access and entrenchment capabilities is nonetheless curious.\n\n\n-----\n\n[More significantly still, as pointed out by various researchers examining intrusion data,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/)\nChina Chopper deployments linked to Exchange exploitation are not uniform. Such\n[observations strongly indicate that more than one adversary—likely operating](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/06/1020442/four-new-hacking-groups-microsoft-email-servers/)\nindependently of each other—is associated with Exchange exploitation operations.\n\n## A Note on Attribution\n\n[Initial reporting from Microsoft noted that HAFNIUM is “state-sponsored and operating out](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\nof China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures.” While the statement\nnotes operations out of China and that the entity is assessed to be “state-sponsored,” the\nsentence as constructed does not explicitly make the claim that HAFNIUM is a Chinese\nstate-directed operation. Yet despite the very careful wording in Microsoft’s blog, [multiple](https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/)\n[media](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/technology/microsoft-hack-china.html) [reports quickly made the direct link to China. While such a link is certainly possible](https://apnews.com/article/beijing-china-email-870dfcc0b3dc9a95a641a85081464018)\nand has not been ruled out, as of this writing no conclusive evidence has emerged linking\nHAFNIUM operations to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nYet HAFNIUM is far from the only entity assessed to be targeting this vulnerability.\n[Independent reporting from FireEye indicates at least three](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html) [clusters—referred to as](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors.html)\nUNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643—actively targeting at least CVE-2021-26855 if not the\ncomplete exploitation chain since January 2021, without specifying links to any known\nthreat actors or state interest. However, [subsequent public comments from Kevin Mandia,](https://apnews.com/article/beijing-china-email-870dfcc0b3dc9a95a641a85081464018)\nCEO of FireEye, to the Associated Press indicated “two groups of Chinese state-backed\nhackers...installed backdoors known as ‘web shells’ on an as-yet undetermined number of\nsystems.” As of this writing, DomainTools is not aware if this is a revision to FireEye’s earlier\ntechnical reporting.\n\nIn addition to FireEye, multiple security firms identified multiple actors exploiting these\n[vulnerabilities. Security company Red Canary noted two distinct clusters separate from](https://redcanary.com/blog/microsoft-exchange-attacks/#clusters)\nHAFNIUM behaviors, including one labeled Sapphire Pigeon active since 05 March 2021,\nalong with other activity that could not be clustered based on limited evidence. Antivirus\nvendor [ESET noted an astounding 10 separate groups targeting the Exchange](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\nvulnerabilities in their telemetry, including nine cases overlapping with existing threat groups\nand one cryptocurrency mining campaign.\n\nWhile none of the reports beyond Microsoft and public comments from FireEye leadership\nlink identified activity to China, it is worth noting that several of the groups identified in\nESET’s analysis have previously been linked to PRC-sponsored activity. This includes:\n\n[Tick, also referred to as](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0060/) [BRONZE BUTLER.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-butler-targets-japanese-businesses)\n[LuckyMouse, also referred to as Emissary Panda or APT27.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\n[Calypso, which is assessed to have PRC-origins in some analysis.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/calypso-apt-2019/)\n[The “Winnti Group,” although this is a](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044/) [wide-ranging classifier that may encompass](https://risky.biz/whatiswinnti/)\nmany distinct entities.\n[Tonto Team, also referred to as Karma Panda and CactusPete.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tonto_team)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Mikroceen APT Group, also referred to as](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/14/mikroceen-spying-backdoor-high-profile-networks-central-asia/) [Vicious Panda, is assessed to have PRC-](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\norigins in some analysis.\n\nWhile this reporting indicates that PRC-related entities are tied to Exchange exploitation\nactivity, ESET’s analysis and telemetry shows that such activity started on 28 February\n2021 at the earliest, with most entities commencing exploitation following Microsoft’s public\nrelease. Given these observations, while PRC-linked entities appear to be targeting the set\nof vulnerabilities since disclosure, it remains unclear with any degree of certainty what\nentities were doing so prior to late February 2021.\n\nUltimately, evidence at this time only supports the following conclusions:\n\nCVE-2021-26855 was under active exploitation since January 2021 by multiple\ngroups, with the possibility of some exploitation activity prior to this time.\nSince 27 February 2021 and especially following public disclosure by Microsoft on 02\nMarch 2021, multiple additional entities have opportunistically leveraged these\nvulnerabilities as part of multiple, independent campaigns.\nWhile a number of entities linked to the Exchange exploitation activity have previously\nbeen linked to PRC-directed or -sponsored operations, multiple additional entities are\nalso involved.\nPrecise identification and origin of the initial groups targeting these vulnerabilities,\nincluding HAFNIUM and the FireEye UNC clusters, remains unavailable as of this\nwriting.\n\n## Network Detection Possibilities\n\nThe best advice to mitigate the vulnerabilities disclosed by Microsoft is to apply the relevant\npatches. However, given the speed in which adversaries weaponized these vulnerabilities\nand the extensive period of time pre-disclosure when these were actively exploited, many\norganizations will likely need to shift into response and remediation activities to counter\n[existing intrusions. Red Canary and](https://redcanary.com/blog/microsoft-exchange-attacks/#detection) [Microsoft provided excellent guidance for host-based](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\ndetection, analysis, and recovery. The remainder of this article focuses on network-specific\navenues available to defenders.\n\nAs of this writing, nearly all instances of identified adversary post-exploitation activity relate\nto webshell deployment. One potentially easy mitigation strategy prior to patching would be\nto eliminate direct access to Exchange from the internet over HTTPS, a necessary condition\nfor remote exploitation. While this would limit accessibility to services such as Outlook Web\nAccess (OWA), such services can be provided via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or\nsimilar portal to reduce attack surface.\n\nWhile strongly recommended, defenders must also appreciate that this is a threat reduction\nstep and not an elimination. Given the desirability of Exchange as both a source of\nintelligence collection itself and as an effective way to pivot throughout a victim network,\n\n\n-----\n\ndefenders should anticipate savvy attackers attempting to exploit on-premise, vulnerable\nExchange deployments post-intrusion where possible as well. Therefore, patching is\nultimately necessary to eliminate this intrusion operation, while webshell monitoring and\ndefense is recommended to both counter this event as well as future security concerns.\n\nWebshells are a difficult security problem to resolve as they take advantage of the inherent\nnature of the servers on which they are installed to listen for and accept remote traffic via\nHTTP or HTTPS. For services that must remain accessible, simply blocking these services\nand related connectivity is not an option. Yet defenders retain several possible avenues to\ndetect this activity through Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and similar practices.\n\nFor externally accessible servers with known specific functionality (such as Exchange\nOWA), NSM looking for odd, unusual, or simply new Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)\ncan alert defenders to a potential webshell. In this case, a server that should only be\naccepting traffic to a few narrowly-defined resources (such as the URI to reach an\naccessible OWA resource), can be monitored for new, unusual URIs in network traffic.\nIdentifying successful communication to a different URI at minimum reveals a\nmisconfiguration or potentially insecure service, and at worst can identify functionality put\ninto place by an attacker.\n\nAnother NSM possibility focuses on follow-on lateral movement or expansion from initial\naccess on an Exchange (or other) server. Typical server functionality would indicate\nreceiving and responding to significant traffic, but not normally initiating connections to\nclients within the network. Provided an intruder desires to move beyond their initial point of\naccess, they will need to transition to other hosts. Identifying anomalous traffic flows from\nservers can indicate a potentially compromised host and an intruder attempting to move\ndeeper into the victim network.\n\nFinally, rapid enrichment and analysis of source traffic to servers may be able to identify\nsuspicious or anomalous connections. While not especially useful for services designed for\ngeneral public access (such as a web server), this approach may work reasonably well with\nmore circumscribed items such as mail services. Depending on scope and geographic\nreach, organizations can identify typical source Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) or\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) for legitimate connectivity. Using this list as a baseline,\ndefenders can then monitor for connections from new or unique ASNs, ISPs, or hosting\nproviders. For example, in the case of the Exchange exploitation activity, multiple vendors\nreported use of Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) from providers such as DigitalOcean (see\nAppendix). Identifying traffic to an Exchange server or similar service from a VPS node\nwould likely be anomalous compared to traffic from typical, legitimate user activity.\n\nOverall, a combination of visibility and information enrichment can be applied to gain\ngreater insight into network traffic and external connectivity, while potentially revealing\nmalicious behaviors such as webshell installation or communication. Defenders are\n\n\n-----\n\ncautioned that none of the above approaches are universal in scope or applicability, and\nwould require a combination of testing, baselining, and similar evaluation to avoid\nimplementing detection or alerting logic which may lead to significant false positives.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapid expansion in Microsoft Exchange exploitation is extremely concerning for a\nvariety of organizations using this software. Starting with narrowly tailored targeting in\nJanuary 2021 (and possibly earlier), activity exploded from late February onward as an\nincreasing number of threats learned about and either developed or gained access to\nexploit code. Based on this rapid expansion in activity, threat attribution and similar\nevaluation will be difficult if not impossible, especially as public POCs become available for\nwidespread use.\n\nWhile concerning, defenders are not completely without recourse in this situation. A\ncombination of timely patching, attack surface reduction, and active threat hunting within\nenvironments can be applied to reduce the likelihood of intrusion and identify potential\nbreaches that have already taken place. Although certainly not easy, given the scale and\nrapid expansion of Exchange exploitation, organizations running such software are strongly\nencouraged to enter into response and recovery mode now as an increasingly diverse set\nof threats are quickly subverting any accessible system.\n\n## Appendix: Infrastructure Linked to Exploitation Activity\n\n**IP** **ISP** **Location** **Function** **Source** **Actor**\n\n\n103.77.192[.]219 Multibyte Info\nTechnology\nLimited\n\n\nHK Exploit\nSource\n\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\n\n104.140.114[.]110 Eonix US Exploit\nSource\n\n104.248.49[.]97 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n104.250.191[.]110 PERFORMIVE US Exploit\nSource\n\n108.61.246[.]56 Choopa JP Exploit\nSource\n\n112.66.255[.]71 Chinanet CN Exploit\nSource\n\n\n-----\n\n**IP** **ISP** **Location** **Function** **Source** **Actor**\n\n\n139.59.56[.]239 DigitalOcean IN Exploit\nSource\n\n149.28.14[.]163 Choopa US Exploit\nSource\n\n157.230.221[.]198 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n161.35.1[.]207 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n161.35.1[.]225 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n161.35.45[.]41 DigitalOcean GB Exploit\nSource,\nScanning\n\n161.35.51[.]41 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n161.35.76[.]1 DigitalOcean DE Exploit\nSource\n\n165.232.154[.]116 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nScanning\n\n167.99.168[.]251 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n167.99.239[.]29 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVarious N/A\n\n\nSwiss\nCERT,\nRapid7\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVarious N/A\n\n\nFireEye,\nRapid7\n\n\nUNC2639\n\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\n\n182.18.152[.]105 CtrlS Datacenters\nLtd\n\n\nIN Unknown FireEye UNC2639\n\n\n185.250.151[.]72 Innovation IT US Exploit\nSource\n\n188.166.162[.]201 DigitalOcean DE Exploit\nSource\n\n192.81.208[.]169 DigitalOcean US Exploit\nSource\n\n194.87.69[.]35 LLC Baxet RU Webshell\nC2\n\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nRapid7 N/A\n\n\n-----\n\n**IP** **ISP** **Location** **Function** **Source** **Actor**\n\n\n203.160.69[.]66 China Unicom HK Exploit\nSource\n\n211.56.98[.]146 Korea Telecom KR Exploit\nSource\n\n45.77.252[.]175 Choopa SG Exploit\nSource\n\n\n5.2.69[.]14 The Infrastructure\nGroup\n\n\nNL Exploit\nSource\n\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\nVarious N/A\n\nVolexity HAFNIUM\n\n\n5.254.43[.]18 Voxility US Exploit\nSource\n\n77.61.36[.]169 KPN NL Exploit\nSource\n\n80.92.205[.]81 Innovation IT US Exploit\nSource\n\n\n86.105.18[.]116 WorldStream NL Unknown FireEye UNC2643\n\n89.34.111[.]11 23Media DE Unknown FireEye UNC2643\n\n\n91.192.103[.]43 Datasource CH Exploit\nSource\n\n\nVarious N/A\n\n\n-----",
