    "plain_text": "# Hades, the actor behind Olympic Destroyer is still alive\n\n**securelist.com/olympic-destroyer-is-still-alive/86169/**\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\n[In March 2018 we published our research on Olympic Destroyer, an advanced attack that hit](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/)\norganizers, suppliers and partners of the Winter Olympic Games 2018 held in Pyeongchang,\nSouth Korea. Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the spread of a\ndestructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance and\ninfiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and selfmodifying destructive malware.\n\nWe are calling the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack – “Hades”. We have previously\nemphasized that Hades is different from other threat actors because the whole attack was a\nmasterful operation in deception. Despite that, the attackers made serious mistakes, which\nhelped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare attribution artefacts. The attackers behind\nOlympic Destroyer forged automatically generated signatures, known as Rich Header, to\nmake it look like the malware was produced by Lazarus APT, an actor widely believed to be\nassociated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader, we recommend [a separate blog](https://securelist.com/the-devils-in-the-rich-header/84348/)\ndedicated to the analysis of this forgery.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe deceptive behavior of Hades and its excessive use of various false flags, which tricked\nmany researchers in the infosecurity industry, got our attention. Based on malware similarity,\nthe Olympic Destroyer malware was linked by other researchers to three Chinese speaking\nAPT actors and the allegedly North Korean Lazarus APT; some code had hints of the\n[EternalRomance exploit, while other code was similar to the Netya (Expetr/NotPetya) and](https://securelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/)\n[BadRabbit targeted ransomware. Kaspersky Lab managed to find lateral movement tools](https://securelist.com/bad-rabbit-ransomware/82851/)\nand initial infection backdoors, and has followed the infrastructure used to control Olympic\nDestroyer in one of its South Korean victims.\n\nSome of the TTPs and operational security used by Hades during the Olympic Destroyer\n[attack bear a certain resemblance to Sofacy APT group activity. When it comes to false](https://securelist.com/a-slice-of-2017-sofacy-activity/83930/)\nflags, mimicking TTPs is much harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a\ndeep knowledge of how the actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation\nto these new TTPs. However, it is important to remember that Hades can be considered a\nmaster in the use of false flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate\nconfidence.\nWe decided to keep tracking the Hades group and set our virtual ‘nets’ to catch them again if\nit showed up with a similar arsenal. To our surprise it has recently resurfaced with new\nactivity.\n\nIn May-June 2018 we discovered new spear-phishing documents that closely resembled\nweaponized documents used by Hades in the past. This and other TTPs led us to believe\nthat we were looking at the same actor again. However, this time the attacker has new\ntargets. According to our telemetry and the characteristics of the analyzed spear-phishing\ndocuments, we believe the attackers are now targeting financial organizations in Russia, and\nbiological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine. They continue\nto use a non-binary executable infection vector and obfuscated scripts to evade detection.\n\n_Simplified infection procedure_\n\n## Infection Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nIn reality the infection procedure is a bit more complex and relies on multiple different\ntechnologies, mixing VBA code, Powershell, MS HTA, with JScript inside and more\nPowershell. Let’s take a look at this more closely to let incident responders and security\nresearchers recognize such an attack at any time in the future.\n\nOne of the recent documents that we discovered had the following properties:\n\nMD5: 0e7b32d23fbd6d62a593c234bafa2311\nSHA1: ff59cb2b4a198d1e6438e020bb11602bd7d2510d\nFile Type: Microsoft Office Word\nLast saved date: 2018-05-14 15:32:17 (GMT)\nKnown file name: Spiez CONVERGENCE.doc\n\nThe embedded macro is heavily obfuscated. It has a randomly-generated variable and\nfunction name.\n\n_Obfuscated VBA macro_\n\nIts purpose is to execute a Powershell command. This VBA code was obfuscated with the\nsame technique used in the original Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing campaign.\n\nIt starts a new obfuscated Powershell scriptlet via the command line. The obfuscator is using\narray-based rearranging to mutate original code, and protects all commands and strings\nsuch as the command and control (C2) server address.\n\nThere is one known obfuscation tool used to produce such an effect: Invoke-Obfuscation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obfuscated commandline Powershell scriptlet_\n\nThis script disables Powershell script logging to avoid leaving traces:\n\nIt has an inline implementation of the RC4 routine in Powershell, which is used to decrypt\nadditional payload downloaded from Microsoft OneDrive. The decryption relies on a\nhardcoded 32-byte ASCII hexadecimal alphabet key. This is a familiar technique used in\nother Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing documents in the past and in Powershell backdoors\nfound in the infrastructure of Olympic Destroyer’s victims located in Pyeongchang.\n\n\n-----\n\n[/caption]\n\nThe second stage payload downloaded is an HTA file that also executes a Powershell script.\n\n_Downloaded access.log.txt_\n\nThis file has a similar structure to the Powershell script executed by the macro in spearphishing attachments. After deobfuscating it, we can see that this script also disables\nPowershell logging and downloads the next stage payload from the same server address. It\nalso uses RC4 with a pre-defined key:\n\nThe final payload is the Powershell Empire agent. Below we partially provide the http stager\nscriptlet for the downloaded Empire agent.\n\n\n-----\n\nPowershell Empire is a post-exploitation free and open-source framework written in Python\nand Powershell that allows fileless control of the compromised hosts, has modular\narchitecture and relies on encrypted communication. This framework is widely used by\npenetration-testing companies in legitimate security tests for lateral movement and\ninformation gathering.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nWe believe that the attackers used compromised legitimate web servers for hosting and\ncontrolling malware. Based on our analysis, the URI path of discovered C2 servers included\nthe following paths:\n\n/components/com_tags/views\n/components/com_tags/views/admin\n/components/com_tags/controllers\n/components/com_finder/helpers\n/components/com_finder/views/\n/components/com_j2xml/\n/components/com_contact/controllers/\n\nThese are known directory structures used by a popular open source content management\nsystem, [Joomla:](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms)\n\n_Joomla components path on Github_\n\nUnfortunately we don’t know what exact vulnerability was exploited in the Joomla CMS. What\nis known is that one of the payload hosting servers used Joomla v1.7.3, which is an\nextremely old version of this software, released in November 2011.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A compromised server using Joomla_\n\n## Victims and Targets\n\nBased on several target profiles and limited victim reports, we believe that the recent\noperations by Hades target Russia, Ukraine and several other European countries.\nAccording to our telemetry, several victims are entities from the financial sector in Russia. In\naddition, almost all the samples we found were uploaded to a multi-scanner service from\nEuropean countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and France, as well as from Ukraine\nand Russia.\n\n_Location of targets in recent Hades attacks_\n\nSince our visibility is limited, we can only speculate about the potential targets based on the\nprofiles suggested by the content of selected decoy documents, email subjects or even file\nnames picked by the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne such decoy document grabbed our attention. It referred to Spiez Convergence, a biochemical threat research conference held in Switzerland, organized by SPIEZ\n[LABORATORY, which not long ago was involved in the Salisbury attack investigation.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/salisbury-attack-russia-claims-chemical-weapons-watchdog-manipulated-findings)\n\n_Decoy document using Spiez Convergence topic_\n\nAnother decoy document observed in the attacks (‘Investigation_file.doc’) references the\nnerve agent used to poison Sergey Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury:\n\n\n-----\n\nSome other spear-phishing documents include words in the Russian and German language\nin their names:\n\n9bc365a16c63f25dfddcbe11da042974 Korporativ.doc\nda93e6651c5ba3e3e96f4ae2dd763d94 Korporativ_2018.doc\ne2e102291d259f054625cc85318b7ef5 E-Mail-Adressliste 2018 doc\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the documents included a lure image with perfect Russian language in it.\n\n_A message in Russian encouraging the user to enable macro (54b06b05b6b92a8f2ff02fdf47baad0e)_\n\nOne of the most recent weaponized documents was uploaded to a malware scanning service\nfrom Ukraine in a file named ‘nakaz.zip’, containing ‘nakaz.doc’ (translated as ‘order.doc’\nfrom Ukrainian).\n\n_Another lure message to encourage the user to enable macro_\n\nAccording to metadata, the document was edited on June 14th. The Cyrillic messages inside\nthis and previous documents are in perfect Russian, suggesting that it was probably\nprepared with the help of a native speaker and not automated translation software.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the user enables macro, a decoy document is displayed, taken very recently from a\nUkrainian state organization (the date inside indicates 11 June 2018). The text of the\n[document is identical to the one on the official website of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health.](http://moz.gov.ua/article/ministry-mandates/nakaz-moz-ukraini-vid-11062018--1103-pro-vnesennja-zmin-do-rozpodilu-likarskih-zasobiv-dlja-hvorih-u-do--ta-pisljaoperacijnij-period-z-transplantacii-zakuplenih-za-koshti-derzhavnogo-bjudzhetu-ukraini-na-2016-rik)\n\n_Decoy document inside nakaz.doc_\n\nFurther analysis of other related files suggest that the target of this document is working in\nthe biological and epizootic threat prevention field.\n\n## Attribution\n\nAlthough not comprehensive, the following findings can serve as a hint to those looking for a\nbetter connection between this campaign and previous Hades activity. More information on\noverlaps and reliable tracking of Hades’ attacks is available to subscribers of Kaspersky\nIntelligence Reporting Services (see below).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Similar obfuscated macro structure_\n\nThe documents above show apparent structural similarity as if they were produced by the\nsame tool and obfuscator. The highlighted function name in the new wave of attacks isn’t in\nfact new. While being uncommon, a function named “MultiPage1_Layout” was also found in\nthe Olympic Destroyer spear phishing document (MD5:\n5ba7ec869c7157efc1e52f5157705867).\n\n_Same MultiPage1_Layout function name used in older campaign_\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite initial expectations for it to stay low or even disappear, Hades, the actor behind the\nOlympic Destroyer attack, has resurfaced with new attacks in Europe, Russia and Ukraine.\nIn late 2017, a similar reconnaissance stage preceded a larger cyber-sabotage stage meant\nto destroy and paralyze infrastructure of the Winter Olympic Games as well as related supply\nchains, partners and even venues at the event location. It’s possible that in this case we\nhave observed a reconnaissance stage that will be followed by a wave of destructive attacks\nwith new motives. That is why it is important for all bio-chemical threat prevention and\nresearch companies and organizations in Europe to strengthen their security and run\nunscheduled security audits.\n\nThe variety of financial and non-financial targets could indicate that the same malware was\nused by several groups with different interests – i.e. a group primarily interested in financial\ngain through cybertheft and another group or groups looking for espionage targets. This\ncould also be a result of cyberattack outsourcing, which is not uncommon among nation\nstate actors. On the other hand, the financial targets might be another false flag operation by\nan actor who has already excelled at this during the Pyeongchang Olympics to redirect\nresearchers’ attention.\n\nCertain conclusions could be made based on motives and the selection of targets in this\ncampaign. However, it is easy to make a mistake when trying to answer the question of who\nis behind this campaign with only the fragments of the picture that are visible to researchers.\nHades’ Olympic Destroyer-related activities at the beginning of this year, with their\nsophisticated deception efforts, changed the attribution game forever. We believe that it is no\nlonger possible to draw conclusions based on few attribution vectors discovered during\nregular investigation. The resistance to and deterrence of threats such as Olympic Destroyer\nshould be based on cooperation between the private sector and governments across\nnational borders. Unfortunately, the current geopolitical situation in the world only boosts the\nglobal segmentation of the internet and introduces many obstacles for researchers and\ninvestigators. This will encourage APT attackers to continue marching into the protected\nnetworks of foreign governments and commercial companies.\n\nThe best thing we can do as researchers is to keep tracking threats like this. We will keep\nmonitoring Hades and report on new discovered activities of this group.\n\nMore details about Hades, Olympic Destroyer and related activity are available to\nsubscribers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting services.
