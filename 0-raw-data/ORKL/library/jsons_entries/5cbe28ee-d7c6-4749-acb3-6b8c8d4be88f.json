As [previously reported by DomainTools, although it appears](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/continuous-eruption-further-analysis-of-the-solarwinds-supply-incident?utm_campaign=the-devils-in-the-details-sunburst-attribution&utm_source=Blog)\nmultiple government sources link the event to SVR, this has resulted in a type of “transitive”\nattribution to link the activity to [APT29, also known as](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/) [Cozy Bear or](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-cozy-bear/) [YTTRIUM, the only](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/12/03/analysis-of-cyberattack-on-u-s-think-tanks-non-profits-public-sector-by-unidentified-attackers/)\ncommercially-identified threat actor names linked to Russia’s SVR.\n\nYet none of the commercial entities responding to events linked SUNBURST malware (or\nthe wider [Solorigate campaign), including FireEye,](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/) [Microsoft,](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/) [Volexity, and](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/) [CrowdStrike, to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/)\n[SVR-associated APT29. Subsequent US government information on the event, from two](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\n[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reports which included no](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)\n[significant attribution statements, to more recent government statements which only assess](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/01/05/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure)\nthat the responsible entity is “likely Russian in origin” and also do not make the SVR claim.\nInitially, the only substantive links to Russian intelligence activity (and SVR specifically)\nwere through leaks to media organizations, with private security companies largely sitting\nthe discussion out.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis changed on 11 January 2021 with a report published by Kaspersky. The report\n[identified functional and code-level overlaps between the SUNBURST backdoor associated](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/sunburst-additional-technical-details.html)\nwith the SolarWinds infection vector and .NET-based backdoor malware referred to as\n[Kazuar. Of note, Kazuar activity (which according to Kasperksy’s analysis continued](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\nthrough December 2020) is only associated with one threat group: an entity referred to as\n[Turla. The implication from Kaspersky’s nuanced analysis is the possibility that SUNBURST](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/)\nactivity and the Turla group are potentially (although far from conclusively, as noted by\nKaspersky researchers) related.\n\n## Who is Turla?\n\n[Turla—also referred to as Snake, Uroburos,](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/) [Venomous Bear, and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-march-venomous-bear/) [Waterbug—is assessed](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments?om_ext_cid=biz_social_blogs-social_fb_s10354)\nto have been active in some form since as early as 2004. Known for targeting political,\nmilitary, and certain sensitive technology sectors, the group is frequently associated with\ncomplex toolsets and audacious operations such as co-opting satellite internet links for\nCommand and Control (C2) activity.\n\nTurla is associated with Russian interests and activity but has never been the subject of a\ndetailed report or authoritative document, such as a US Department of Justice (DoJ)\n[indictment or similar primary source. Several entities, such as Estonian and](https://www.xn--vlisluureamet-bfb.ee/pdf/raport-2018-ENG-web.pdf) [Czech](https://www.bis.cz/public/site/bis.cz/content/vyrocni-zpravy/2017-vz-cz.pdf)\nintelligence services, link Turla with Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). However,\ndespite multiple historical reports covering Turla activity from the US National Security\nAgency (NSA), [CISA (then US-CERT) and the UK’s](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity) [National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-malware)\n(NCSC), such entities only highlight that Turla is “widely reported to be associated with\nRussian actors,” avoiding any specific attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Estonian and Czech assessments cannot be completely discounted, it is notable that\nthe US and UK governments—which have previously performed very specific attribution on\n[other Russia-linked entities such as APT28 and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1098481/download) [Sandworm—abstain from similar](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-partners-condemn-gru-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-an-paralympic-games)\nassessments. While a Turla-FSB link is possible, at this time it is not as solid as similar\nassessments such as GRU links to APT28 and Sandworm.\n\n## Examining Possibilities\n\nThe most direct conclusion from Kaspersky’s analysis is that SUNBURST is linked to Turla\noperations, which would potentially associate the campaign with Russia’s FSB and not\n[SVR. However, Kaspersky analysts in both their reporting and](https://securelist.com/sunburst-backdoor-kazuar/99981/) [social media communication](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1348596474184151046?s=20)\nemphasize that while a SUNBURST-Turla link is possible, this is hardly the only possibility\navailable. Multiple possibilities exist, which will be discussed below.\n\n### Turla Involvement\n\nThe first and most direct possibility is that Turla is indeed responsible for the SolarWinds\nand related intrusion activity. This would provide a very simple and efficient explanation for\nKaspersky’s findings. Yet, there are problems with this assessment and other data points\nwhich do not support the conclusion.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor one, there is the FSB (likely, although not definitively, associated with Turla) versus SVR\n(indicated by multiple direct sources, including some available to DomainTools, as likely\nresponsible) distinction. While Turla concrete attribution is hardly complete or definitive,\nunlike for other Russia-linked threat actors, the consensus of what limited claims exist focus\non FSB. Meanwhile, multiple sources continue to emphasize that SVR is ultimately\nresponsible for SUNBURST and related activity. The possibility of a single actor moving\namong organizations will be discussed below, but as a one-to-one mapping SUNBURSTTurla linkage seems problematic if we trust multiple government and confidential sources.\n\nAdmittedly, the sources in question are not without fault or criticism. The Estonian and\nCzech reports linking Turla to FSB cite no evidence of significance and these claims are not\nbacked up in any other reporting. At the same time, SVR involvement in SUNBURST is\nbased on no public, documented reporting, but instead derives from leaks to the media and\nprivate (if trusted) conversations. The only public statements by US government entities so\nfar have emphasized a “likely” Russian nexus without naming a specific entity or alluding to\nany industry threat actors.\n\nIt is worth noting that Turla is associated with complex, high operational security intrusions\nsince the group’s initial discovery. As such, a multi-staged, stealthy intrusion such as\nSUNBURST and related activity would appear to align with Turla’s operations. However,\nfollow-on actions in victim environments, including extensive use of credential capture and\n[replay as well as customized Cobalt Strike functionality as documented by FireEye and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\n[Microsoft, align with behaviors associated with APT29. From a pure tradecraft perspective](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\nthen, the evidence is inconclusive.\n\n### Contracted Actor Responsible\n\nOne possibility, which may explain the code overlap with Turla-linked tooling for a different\nactor, would be a shared, contracted developer resource supporting two different entities. In\nthis scenario, malware developer resources are not dedicated to or housed within a single\nentity but instead reside as an external service provided to the actual intrusion set.\n\nIf this were used, malware sample code-level and function-level overlaps would be artifacts\nof common developer environments and tendencies and would be unrelated to the actual\nactors using the tools. [Malware-centric threat analysis faces pitfalls and traps in that the](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/Threat-Intelligence-and-the-Limits-of-Malware-Analysis.pdf)\nanalyzed object represents an artifact or tool used by an adversary, rather than necessarily\nan item inherent to the adversary itself.\n\nWhile a malware-focused threat intelligence approach most obviously faces issues with\ntools that are publicly available, open source, or otherwise non-exclusive to specific threat\nactors, division of labor in cyber operations means overlaps may occur in otherwise “nonpublic” tooling as well. Under these circumstances, a single developer or developer\n\n\n-----\n\nresource is relied upon or hired to support tool development by multiple parties. Based on\ncoding “quirks” and other tendencies, subtle similarities appear within tools not directly or\ncritically related to tool functionality.\n\nUnfortunately, this type of attribution is incredibly difficult to prove without having significant\ninsight into the operations and resource management of threat actors. Yet we cannot\ndiscount the existence of malicious tool creators for hire—or even the possibility of shared\n[“digital quartermaster” resources supporting disparate teams. If this were true, an overlap](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/digital-quartermaster-scenario-demonstrated-in-attacks-against-the-mongolian-government/)\nwith Turla would be an artifact of such an arrangement while the perpetrators of Solorigate\ncould represent another operational entity entirely.\n\n### Joint Operation\n\nAn intriguing scenario surrounding the Solorigate activity in general and SUNBURST\ndeployment in particular would be a joint or divided operation. In this scenario, the cyber kill\nchain is not executed or managed by a monolithic entity. Instead, different elements are\noperationally responsible for different stages of operations, with separate “access,”\n“intrusion,” and “execution” teams taking on specific roles.\n\nIf this were to hold as valid, Turla-linked capabilities in SUNBURST may be an artifact of\nTurla—a known, capable intrusion actor—having responsibility for initial access operations\nto victim networks. Meanwhile, follow-on exploitation and lateral movement are handed over\nto another team, with its own methods, tools, and tradecraft for carrying out operations.\n\nAs described previously, SUNBURST appears to at least superficially resemble Turla-linked\ncapabilities and operations, while post-exploitation activity seems more closely linked to\nbehaviors associated with APT29. Such divergence may not be an anomaly, but actually\nrepresent two distinct teams involved in the same operation.\n\nWhile limited, public information links these activities to two distinct parts of Russia’s\nintelligence community (FSB and SVR, respectively), the possibility of these two\norganizations working together or in complementary fashion may be unlikely, but not\noutside the bounds of possibility. Both derive from the same ancestor organization—the\nCommittee for State Security (KGB)—and have identical reporting and chain of command\nstructures under the Russian President’s Council. That these organizations—typically\ndivided between mostly (although not exclusively) internal (FSB) and external (SVR)\noperations—might collaborate makes more sense than either organization working in\nconcert with Russia’s other major intelligence entity, the military’s Main Intelligence\nDirectorate (GRU).\n\nAlthough provocative, this theory would require significantly greater amounts of evidence to\nsupport it. Additional tools or capabilities representing initial access vectors, similar to\nSUNBURST, and further details on follow-on capabilities and exploitation would be\nnecessary to have adequate information to justify delineating operations between distinct\n\n\n-----\n\nentities. Nonetheless, we cannot simply dismiss this as a possibility, and we as cyber threat\nintelligence analysts should be wary of assuming all operations are “unitary” in nature\ninstead of composite operations divided among specialist teams.\n\n### “False Flag” Operation\n\nThe overlaps with Turla-associated functionality in SUNBURST may represent an effort by\nthe threat actor to throw off attribution through a “false flag,” misdirection operation. As\n[documented by other](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1341175012540223488?s=20) [researchers, Solorigate and related events may map to completely](https://www.recordedfuture.com/solarwinds-attribution/)\ndifferent threats previously noted for highly-targeted supply chain activities.\n\nYet on closer examination, although still possible, this seems less probable. For one,\nSUNBURST and related activity operated at a relatively obscure level of program\nfunctionality or tendencies such that it took a third-party, not known to be engaged in any\nactive investigations in victim environments, to make the connection through very detailed\nmalware reverse engineering. While one could claim such efforts are part of an\nexceptionally savvy, operationally secure operation, this level of effort and the non-obvious\nsimilarities (compared to, say, the ultimately [obvious](https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2018/abstracts/who-wasnt-responsible-olympic-destroyer/) [“tells” embedded within the Olympic](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2018_the-olympic-false-flag)\nDestroyer event) would appear to indicate otherwise. The ability to make this (still tenuous)\nlink to Turla relies upon recognition of non-obvious, technically obtuse overlaps between\nSUNBURST and Kazuar code, making this a very difficult and potentially unreliable\nmechanism to divert blame to another party.\n\nSecond, while the quality of existing sourcing has already been described as less than ideal\nwith respect to Solorigate attribution, it remains that multiple US government agencies have\npublicly declared that Russia-linked entities are “likely” responsible for the event. While we\nmay decry lack of additional detail and technical indicators making this case more complete,\nthat such agencies would go public with such a proclamation in itself indicates a level of\nconfidence in the assessment which is probably higher than the “likely” modifier attached to\nit.\n\nCertainly a “we’re from the government, trust us” stance is problematic and less than ideal,\nbut overall there are no significant examples of public US attribution statements ultimately\nbeing proved completely or disastrously wrong. In fact, previous work—such as that\n[identifying Turla as having compromised APT34 to further Turla campaigns—indicates the](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/18/2002197242/-1/-1/0/NSA_CSA_Turla_20191021%20ver%204%20-%20nsa.gov.pdf)\nUS and UK governments are able to unpack false flag events when they occur. Therefore,\n[although less than ideal, the declaration from CISA, NSA, the US Federal Bureau of](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/01/05/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure)\nInvestigation (FBI), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) should give us\nas analysts pause before we engage in equally unfounded “whataboutism” in declaring that\n[SUNBURST may be a false flag operation executed by an entity such as APT41.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096/)\n\n### Coincidence\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the items in question identified by Kaspersky may ultimately be the result of\ncoincidence. Programmatic overlaps may be the result of developers having similar\ninstructors, viewing the same support forums, or arriving at similar conclusions to similar\nproblems. Short of additional evidence supporting a link to Turla for SUNBURST\ndevelopment, we as analysts may remain with only this perspective as a means to explain\nwhy SUNBURST overlapped with Kazuar in subtle, but nonetheless noticeable to the\ntrained eye, ways.\n\nAlthough disappointing and unexciting, this explanation may prove to be the most likely\nreason for such overlaps to occur. Yet the underlying reasons giving rise to these\ncoincidences—programming similarities and other oddities—may indicate similar\nbackgrounds or developer methodologies between Kazuar and SUNBURST even if\noperationally the items are used by completely distinct entities. Such an insight may cast an\ninteresting light upon malware developer tendencies and similar observables, even if this\ndoes not lend any further detail to who is responsible for SUNBURST’s deployment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInvestigation into the Solorigate activity, including its components such as SUNBURST and\n[recently-disclosed SUNSPOT, remains ongoing. As noted by researchers from Kaspersky,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/)\nmore evidence is required before linking the activity to any known, tracked entity, although\nthe technical analysis provided indicates subtle, tantalizing links to historical actors.\nNonetheless, we as cyber threat analysts and network defenders must remain skeptical,\nand process alternatives to the identified activity to ensure we do not engage in\nassumptions or similar intellectual shortcuts that may disadvantage future investigations.\n\nOverall, the process of specific attribution remains an exceptionally difficult task when\ndealing with less than complete information or viewing an intrusion from an external\nperspective. While the Solorigate activity and components such as SUNBURST and\nSUNSPOT are items of intense scrutiny and interest at this time, accurate attribution may\ndepend on additional information gathering and leveraging non-cyber sources to clear up\ncertain doubts and remaining questions. As a result, although this is frustrating on many\nlevels to CTI professionals, we likely will be waiting months, if not years, before identifying\nadditional information necessary to learn who is precisely responsible for this event within\nthe current landscape of threat actors. This is not to say that such a task is impossible, but\nrather to emphasize the need for patience, dispassionate analysis, and continual\ninformation gathering to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n-----",
