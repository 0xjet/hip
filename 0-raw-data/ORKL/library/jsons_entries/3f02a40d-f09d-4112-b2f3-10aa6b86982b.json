Ironically, the developer behind the apps seems\nto be taking an interest in negative and very emotional reviews of three stars and below,\neven though many of the answers follow the same template. Taking things to a new level,\nsome of the five-star reviews even collect over 100 “Helpful” ratings, potentially from the\nsame fake accounts – spam bot- network.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt may [not be the first time security researchers stumble across Google Play applications](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/01/seventeen-android-nasties-spotted-in-google-play-total-over-550k-downloads/)\nwith aggressive adware that manage to trick their way into Google’s app playground, but\nthis time the developer behind the applications seems to have placed more focus on\nbuilding positive fake reviews to draw downloads. Apps bundled with aggressive adware\nare often spotted by users and end up collecting tons of negative reviews before being\nbooted out.\n\nThe below analysis performed by Bitdefender researchers on the 13 apps found in Google\nPlay mostly focuses on the capabilities the aggressive adware features as well as finding\nforensic evidence that potentially ties them all to a single developer. The analysis also\nrevealed that the adware SDK packs a privacy-intrusive permission that allows the apps to\nread all notifications. This could enable the developer(s) to collect contact details, text\nmessages, and OTPs that are used to pass MFA. Although the apps analyzed did not\ntrigger the permission, the code is present in some of the analyzed samples.\n\n### Key Findings:\n\nNew aggressive adware family, also found in 13 Google Play apps\nUse of fake reviews and ratings to attract hundreds of thousands of downloads\nAdware SDK packs privacy-intrusive permission to read all notifications\nPotentially same developer behind all investigated Google Play apps\n\n### Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nA previously undiscovered yet highly aggressive adware campaign has recently been found\nin applications still available in the Google Store and other markets\n\n\n-----\n\nThe apps categories are a mix of common utility apps, ranging from music and video\nplayers to file downloaders and social media aggregators.\n\nWhile ads are not inherently bad, and give the app authors a way to make income without\nrequesting a payment from everyone who uses their apps, when the developers go\noverboard with their ad usage it becomes inconvenient to the user, eventually surpassing\nthe worth of the application in time and annoyance.\n\nWhilst the ratings are generally good, between 3 and 4.5 stars on Google Play’s 5-star\nrating system, something seems fishy with a quick look at the reviews:\n\nA high number of short, general and mostly 5-star reviews usually indicates that the app\ndevelopers might be using a fake review-generation system. While this is only speculation,\nthe act of faking reviews is punishable by the FTC, and fines can reach millions of dollars.\nThis is a known problem for Google Play and these apps would be neither the first nor the\nlast apps to increase their chances of getting popular more quickly and easily. After all, if\nmost reviews are great, it must mean the app is worth it:\n\n\n-----\n\nA quick look at the reviews of users who actually used the application before leaving a\ncomment reflects its real behavior much better:\n\n**Applications and connections**\n\nThe applications are the following:\n\n**Package name** **Application name** **Installs**\n\n\ncom.downloader.getvideofastss Video Downloader – Download Social\nPlatform Video\n\ncom.anymail Full Email App – Fast Email access for\nall Mail\n\ncom.savers.insta InsSaver – video & image downloader\nfor instagram\n\ncom.getVideo.mediagetall Fast Downloader – Download social\nvideos\n\ncom.launcherj.quick Messenger for all Social apps – New\nMessages\n\n\n100,000+\n\n100,000+\n\n100,000+\n\n100,000+\n\n50,000+\n\n\ncom.downloadmanager.filemanager File download manager 50,000+\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.musics.videos.aaplayers Music Video Player – All format player 10,000+\n\n\ncom.media.musicsvideos.players Media Player All Format – HD Video\nPlayer\n\ncom.privacymsger.social New Messenger for all messaging &\nsocial app\n\n\n10,000+\n\n5,000+\n\n\ncom.satatusdownload.saverstatus Status Saver 1,000+\n\nlaunchserfor.apps Quick Launcher For Apps 1,000+\n\n\ncom.parallaxcolor.fourdx 4D Parallax Live Wallpaper – 4K\nBackgrounds HD\n\ncom.wallpaperlive.fourd 4D Parallax Wallpaper HD – Color live\nbackground\n\n\n1,000+\n\n100+\n\n\nThe applications are published by nine separate developers although we believe there is in\nfact only one developer due to several connections between the samples. One presumption\nis that this is done to avoid all of them being taken down if any fraudulent or unwanted\nbehavior from any one developer is found.\n\n**Developer Name** **Email Address**\n\ncircRodg.57.543 circRodg.57.543@gmail[.]com\n\nJames Tange oioutbreak12300@gmail[.]com\n\nSocialmessengerapp allsocialmsgapp@gmail[.]com\n\nLaverneishipwreckm115 laverneishipwreckm11580@gmail[.]com\n\nluis gallegos concert.14746454@gmail[.]com\n\ntrumpeter.wiy6789 trumpeter.wiy6789@gmail[.]com\n\nAdriana Duleva BassLove9757262@gmail[.]com\n\nSteps Pedometer:Steps App, Step Tracker fastgamestore1@gmail[.]com\n\nthayrelqyckcSocial thayrelqyckc@gmail[.]com\n\nA strong indicator that these applications are linked is that most of them have the same\ndistinctly unique pattern of words used for the certificate details with which they are signed.\nCertificate details respect the following format:\n\n**Certificate detail field** **Applications certificate details**\n\n\n-----\n\nCountry Name US\n\nState, Locality <Random US state>\n\n\nOrganization, Organizational Unit, Common\nName\n\nExample applications from different developers:\n\n\nCorpLtd<Timestamp of appriximate\n_creation>Ltd_\n\n\n**Application** **Applications certificate details**\n\nStatus Saver C=US, ST=New York, L=New York, O=Corp1584509501892Ltd,\nOU=Corp1584509501892Ltd, CN=Corp1584509501892Ltd\n\n\nQuick Launcher For\nApps\n\nFast Downloader –\nDownload social\nvideos\n\n\nC=US, ST=Florida, L=Florida, O=Corp1576154534422Ltd,\nOU=Corp1576154534422Ltd, CN=Corp1576154534422Ltd\n\nC=US, ST=Florida, L=Florida, O=Corp1576828043681Ltd,\nOU=Corp1576828043681Ltd, CN=Corp1576828043681Ltd\n\n\nSome light connections could be concluded from the email addresses for support contact\nand the privacy policies. All the privacy policies are hosted on sites.google.com and we\ncan observe a mild pattern in the email addresses used..\n\nFrom a code structural point of view, the applications have the same distinct, heavy code\nobfuscation and string encryption mechanism. This obfuscation is applied both to the\nnormal code of the application and to the adware component.\n\nThe adware component, present in all apps in some form or another, focuses on displaying\nads from Google and Facebook. We say in some form or another to indicate that the\nauthors are still developing it and adding new features to it. We have seen several\nvariations in the wild.\n\nAnother similarity is in the user interface of the apps. Many of them share the same visual\ncharacteristics and structure, for example:\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.media.musicsvideos.players com.musics.videos.aaplayers (developer: luis gallegos)\n(developer: Laverneishipwreckm115)com.anymail com.privacymsger.social (developer:\nSteps Pedometer:Steps App, Step Tracker) (developer: Socialmessengerapp)\n\n**Behavior**\n\nWhile interacting with the applications, the user will receive a new ad every few taps. Some\nolder versions of the apps didn’t even find the time to remove their testing tags in their rush\nto get on the market. The type of ads varies from general topics such as shopping and\ntravel to app recommendations, and they come both in banner and full-screen modes.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe advertised functionality of the apps is generally lacking. Basic at best and broken at\nworst, the apps are of inferior quality, with missing parts in their implementation and\noccasional crashes.\n\n**Code Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis focused mostly on APK MD5 `dcb5b8d8270b4a51a7702fa716ff9bc2`\n(launchserfor.apps), given that it presented most of the features of the SDK and is one of\nthe versions currently available on the Play Store.\n\nThe code is heavily obfuscated, and strings used by the app are encrypted using DES\nencryption algorithm. Virtually nothing is left as plain information and some of the classes\nare hidden even in legit packages such as `android.support and` `com.facebook . This`\nstarted as a technique to protect intellectual information but nowadays it’s often misused as\na way to delay analysts and avoid effective detections.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, in an initial test version of the adware, we found that the threat actors might\nhave planned to confuse the user by switching the position of the “agree” and “refuse”\nbuttons when prompting for access to notifications (the strings have been decrypted here).\n\nThis SDK version (among others) has the code to ask for the permission to read all\nnotifications. This is one of the most sensitive permissions the Android system provides,\nsince notifications can contain any type of data, from contact details, to text messages to\nOTPs that are used to pass MFA – even banking data in some cases. However, none of the\nsamples we analyzed reach the code to do so as of yet.\n\nIf this part of the code wasn’t dead, however, the inconvenience of the user who is the\ntarget of too many ads is suddenly one of the lesser problems since, once received, the\nnotifications are promptly sent to the APK’s command and control server: in this case,\nhxxps://t.lineranalysis.com/api/APClient3/.\n\nThe service `androidx.media.ckwtik extends the NotificationListenerServices class`\nbelonging to the Android SDK. If the app has the required permission, overwriting the\n```\nonNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification) method will give it access to the\n\n```\ndevice’s notifications and related information. The analyzed app never reaches the part of\nthe code that requests the permission from the user (probably due to the app still being in\ndevelopment). However, if, or when, it reaches that part, it will use it to leak all the\nnotification data to the server.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nTwo of the apps currently up on Play Store have this type of functionality implemented,\nnamely `com.forasocial.messengers and` `launchserfor.apps .`\n\nAnother interesting part of the SDK is where it provides a large support for JavaScript.\nBesides having a class dedicated to exposing functionality through JavaScript interfaces, it\ngoes so far as having the functionality to execute any script received from the server.\n\n(Some of the strings have been decrypted for readability.)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe app also sends generic information to the server, such as the list of installed\napplications, the device’s android ID, the app’s package name, the type of network, the sim\noperator, whether the current app has certain functionalities implemented, logs, timestamps\nand status checks.\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Application** **Server**\n\ncom.downloader.getvideofastss hxxps://api.socialvideodownloader.top/\n\ncom.anymail hxxps://api.sportcounter.top/\n\ncom.downloadmanager.filemanager hxxps://api.instragramvideodownload.top/\n\ncom.satatusdownload.saverstatus hxxps://api.instragramvideodownload.top/\n\ncom.savers.insta hxxps://api.instragramvideodownload.top/\n\ncom.parallaxcolor.fourdx hxxp://api.wallpaper4k.top/\n\ncom.wallpaperlive.fourd hxxp://api.wallpaper4k.top/\n\ncom.musics.videos.aaplayers hxxps://api.supervideoplayer.top/\n\ncom.media.musicsvideos.players hxxps://api.hdvideoplayer.top/\n\ncom.privacymsger.social hxxps://api.privatemsg.top/\n\nlaunchserfor.apps hxxp://t.lineranalysis.com/\n\ncom.launcherj.quick hxxps://api.launcherfor.top/\n\nAll of the CnCs are under the same registrar, namely the Chinese company Alibaba Cloud\nComputing.\n\n**CnC** **IP resolved to** **Location** **ISP**\n\nhxxps://api.instragramvideodownload.top/ 45.56.121[.]196 Texas, US Linode\n\n\nhxxps://api.supervideoplayer.top/ 47.89.244[.]237 California,\nUS\n\nhxxps://api.socialvideodownloader.top/ 47.90.254[.]44 California,\nUS\n\n\nAlibaba\n\nAlibaba\n\n\nhxxps://api.hdvideoplayer.top/ 47.252.11[.]196 Kansas, US Alibaba\n\n\nhxxps://api.privatemsg.top/ 80.245.105[.]93 Hong Kong,\nHong Kong\n\nhxxp://api.wallpaper4k.top/ 172.67.157[.]133 California,\nUS\n\nhxxp://t.lineranalysis.com/ 172.105.66[.]146 Frankfurt,\nGermany\n\n\nSakura\nNetwork\n\nCloudflare\n\nLinode\n\n\nhxxps://api.sportcounter.top/ 178.79.159[.]197 London, UK Linode\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://api.launcherfor.top/ 104.18.52[.]47 California,\nUS\n\n**Attribution**\n\n\nCloudflare\n\n\nWhile we cannot be certain of the origin of the developer(s), most privacy pages for each\ndeveloper have their tab title in Chinese (either 首页 -Homepage or住宅 – Home).\n\nMany debug messages (logs) inside the applications are also in the same language (e.g.\n“因未调用setApplicationContext()初始化, 当前不支持Cookie”) and all of the CnCs are\nregistered in China.\n\n**Telemetry**\n\nThe family seems to be most popular in India, Korea and the US, although we have seen it\nin the wild in many other countries, too.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nAggressive adware may not be as damaging or as intrusive as malware, but it could affect\nthe overall user experience with the device and even battery performance. Constant\npopups, redirects and unwanted messages can make for a horrendous app and user\nexperience.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo avoid exposing your device to any online threats, malware, or even aggressive adware,\nit’s recommended you always use a security solution to prevent these apps from reaching\nyour device and to flag any suspicious behavior. It’s also important to always download\napps from official marketplaces and read user reviews carefully before installing any\napplication on your mobile device.\n\nA mobile security solution will also keep you safe from online threats, such as fraud,\nphishing, or scams gunning for your private and financial data, as well as from malware.\n\n**Note: The full list of apps identified throughout this investigation has been reported to**\n_Google. At the time of writing, the apps are still available in the Google Play store._\n\n### Appendix – Indicators of Compromise\n\n**APK MD5 Hashes:**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n36487995b2065b4c50db0974fed86b6f
