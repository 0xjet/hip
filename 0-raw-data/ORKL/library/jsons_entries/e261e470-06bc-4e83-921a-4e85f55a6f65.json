In this analysis, we observed the return of Hidden Cobra’s Bankshot\n\nmalware implant surfacing in the Turkish financial system. Based on the code similarity,\n\nthe victim’s business sector, and the presence of control server strings, this attack\n\n[resembles previous attacks by Hidden Cobra conducted against the global financial](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/attacks-swift-banking-system-benefit-insider-knowledge/)\n\n[network SWIFT.](https://www.swift.com/)\n\nIn this new, aggressive campaign we see a return of the Bankshot implant, which last\n\nappeared in 2017. Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim’s network for further\n\nexploitation; thus the Advanced Threat Research team believes this operation is intended\n\nto gain access to specific financial organizations.\n\nBased on our analysis, financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing\n\nemails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. The document contains an\n\nembedded Adobe Flash exploit, which was recently announced by the Korean Internet\n\n[Security agency. The exploit, which takes advantage of CVE-2018-4878, allows an attacker](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/hackers-bypassed-adobe-flash-protection-mechanism/)\n\nto execute arbitrary code such as an implant.\n\nthe Further investigation into this campaign and analysis of McAfee product telemetry\n\nshows that the infection occurred on March 2 and 3. The implant’s first target was a\n\nmajor government-controlled financial organization. It next appeared in another Turkish\n\ngovernment organization involved in finance and trade. A further three large financial\n\ninstitutions in Turkey were victims of this attack. The implant has so far not surfaced in\n\nany other sector or country. This campaign suggests the attackers may plan a future\n\nheist against these targets by using Bankshot to gather information.\n\n|--Please Select--|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n[mcafee_labs](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\nIn a recent campaign, the Sun\n\n\nCountry *\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n## McAfee on Twitter\n\n[ Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/McAfee)\n\n\n[mcafee_labs](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\nDid you get served an ad about\n\nsomething you were talking\n\nabout?

These implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a\n\nremote access tool that gives an attacker full capability on a victim’s system. This implant\n\nalso contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase\n\nevidence or perform other destructive actions. Bankshot was first reported by the\n\n[Department of Homeland Security on December 13, 2017, and has only recently](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10135536-B_WHITE.PDF)\n\nresurfaced in newly compiled variants. The sample we analyzed is 99% similar to the\n\ndocumented Bankshot variants from 2017.\n\nBankshot implants hosted on falcancoin.io.\n\nThe Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document with the filename\n\nAgreement.docx. The document appears to be an agreement template for Bitcoin\n\ndistribution between an unknown individual in Paris and a to-be-determined\n\ncryptocurrency exchange.

The malicious DLL is not a\nservice DLL because it lacks ServiceMain(). To mask itself, it can run as a regular library\nloaded into a legitimate process.\n\nThe malware begins by creating a new thread from the DllMain() function to carry out its\n\nmalicious activities:\n\nNew thread created in the malware’s DllMain() function.\n\nThe malware performs the following activities:\n\nBuilds imports by dynamically loading APIs\n\nDecrypts strings needed for control server communications\nPerforms control server communications\n\nHandles commands issued by the control server\nUninstalls self from the system\n\nThe malicious thread dynamically loads the APIs it needs at the beginning of its execution\n\nusing LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress().

This implant has been connected to a major\n\n[Korean bank attack and is also known as Trojan Manuscript. That variant contained the](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-17/materials/eu-17-Shen-Nation-State Moneymules-Hunting-Season-APT-Attacks-Targeting-Financial-Institutions.pdf)\ncapability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network and the same control server\n\nstrings as the variant we found targeting the Turkish financial sector.
