This\nwave of malspam had Word documents as file attachments, and these Word docs had\nmacros designed to infect Windows hosts with ransomware. When I checked Monday\nevening, I infected one of my lab hosts with GlobeImposter ransomware. When I checked\nTuesday morning, I saw GandCrab ransomware.\n\nThis is interesting, because in 2018, I've seen very few examples of mass-distribution\nmalspam pushing ransomware. So far in 2018, such malspam has been pushing mostly\ninformation stealers, backdoors, and cryptocurrency miners. So it's always noteworthy when\nI find something like this.\n\nToday's diary examines this wave of malspam, the infection traffic, and associated indicators.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Flow chart for an infection from this malspam._\n\n**_The emails_**\n\nPatterns for these emails were consistent, but I couldn't match them to a specific campaign.\nSending addresses, subject lines, email headers, and message text were all varied. The\nonly consistent part of this malspam was the Word document attachments, which were all\nnamed \" Resume.doc\" with a space before the first letter. And even then, each attachment\nhad a different file hash.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Screenshot from the spreadsheet tracker with 24 email samples._\n\n_Shown above: Screenshot from one of the emails._\n\n**_The attachments_**\n\nThe attachments were typical Word documents with malicious macros. They work similar to\nmalicious macros seen in other malspam campaigns, using Powershell to retrieve a malware\nbinary to infect a vulnerable Windows host.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: One of the attached Word documents._\n\n**_The traffic_**\n\nInfection traffic from Monday evening showed indicators of GlobeImposter ransomware.\nAfter the macro used Powershell to retrieve the ransomware binary from a server at\n198.100.119.11, I saw an HTTP request to psoeiras.net for an IP address check. The URL\n[to psoeiras.net was similar to what I've documented before with GlobeImposter ransomware](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/12/21/index.html)\ninfections.\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from an infection filtered in Wireshark on Monday evening (US time)._\n\nWhen I checked again Tuesday morning, I saw the same URL to 198.100.119.11 for a\nransomware binary However, this time, the follow-up HTTP request for the IP address check\nwent to nomoreransom.coin, with follow-up DNS queries for nomoreransom.bit and\n**_[gandcrab.bit. These domains are typical for what I've previously documented with](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/GandCrab+Ransomware+Now+Coming+From+Malspam/23321/)_**\nGandCrab ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from an infection filtered in Wireshark on Tuesday morning (US time)._\n\n**_Forensics on an infected Windows host_**\n\nThe GandCrab ransomware sample didn't encrypt any files on my lab host, but the\nGlobeImposter binary did. All files encrypted by the GlobeImposter sample used a .gif file\nextension. Previous samples of GlobeImposter I'd tested in December 2017 used\n**_Read__ME.html for the decryption instructions, but this 2018 sample used Read__ME.txt._**\nThe GlobeImposter decryptor seen through my Tor browser had a visual upgrade with a nice\nbackground image, but it still had the same basic setup as before.\n\n_Shown above: Encrypted files on a Windows host infected with GlobeImposter._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: GlobeImposter decryption instructions._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: GlobeImposter decryptor viewed on a Tor browser._\n\nThe GlobeImposter infection stayed persistent on my infected lab host through the Windows\nregistry. Like many malware samples I've seen, this one used the\n**_HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run registry key. However, the_**\nbinary used for persistence was not the same binary used during the initial infection. The\npersistent binary for this GlobeImposter infection was only 22,528 bytes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Malware made persistent on my host infected with GlobeImposter._\n\n**_Indicators_**\n\nSee below for a list of URLs, domains, and file hashes associated with this malspam.\n\nSHA256 hashes for all attachments named \" Resume.doc\":\n\n02d9a2643082ee6751472cfbe4760a3d9afb00a263c698eca3b748d012fcb66a\n05ec663bd1c8521f48affc6dfebf0a6fe410711b70096b5c4be2bac37c7f262b\n4027d8bad7ae8b5f2a88f414417ced73a50ee5fa0d60bf4d5395dc8953037b3c\n43d2c9efb6cc5907f7c04c719e83c3404b629bbf849c83fb053b6f23ddf84d81\n4b4ade15d6ed8eba53d1064170dee191e07da1baafeeecc3b8fdb4803a44a628\n50994124ce7d6ebc5b59b29e4278eb78997726d8e6cb902a8ccc437e4fda1a6d\n5490b18af502fa3a576ff5612eefff34dd75edd7bd567519f2b25da1d885de60\n56e6c1521070d58e525bad12d222c04952676c4b0d77136c9720a3263f9c557f\n6242c95fed475bc708c49b2bb7ad292f43d42fbcbd0b68502db01ea4a44ae656\n63f070add2cd6b6a6c212c82f1003b35fd45c4ae8787a2da2ec9e16c5e16c0e5\n\n\n-----\n\n69e706c4ddcd8ea4e9f0745e5bdcef760b0e553549bf26526ef51746244f292c\n6a193b0362506748a165b320f72bcd2d149760d66f287bc2271f30328a11181e\n72d18a2df77c75fc3949f34c37e0339039a211e2086fab5c92d2b41064fb5030\n75e92c7e36ff1cac3cff5b11426916d64b7956022cb668f4f675f3f2fc0e7fe7\n767b6094e57e940540192fceb1fe31c8311588d998d6f71a4099623fec0d5488\n92e56ae3f7f014ae8f348e0dc6c2a68936dc878d56e4c9b777202a9000fd6899\n9d41bb0167c7a19d69be0eb29920054e9b8cfa132a89129b31ecaa3338887e1d\na77afbcc935a6c0290e0a290f10913f343be31d955ce7f2f2446e605a0d89165\na84730972266ee371c8a5b9906102842f9834b6bd36413f8e15808aa79d1c136\na96c1911b31beaa2d6fedc654fb568e0ee82160d439e4ac38d53c24a441b0436\nb8ccfed35c590ab7bb1fd619eb085905515fde9c6dff7f592b391a516f8cc52a\ncb32fc84a036ab47b60569b3fdc718de9858555b349c90e188a8b7cd4602a264\nee6b7d944abaec4cb3bc2780489f81d337724164d76c2056d37cc225ea57a6d5\n\nThe following are malware samples retrieved from my infected lab hosts:\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[61bed70b1568fce8dc67c91bab1884027631bdf2c8b8ba63d54ce32d7e429a76](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/61bed70b1568fce8dc67c91bab1884027631bdf2c8b8ba63d54ce32d7e429a76/analysis/)\n\nFile size: 223,744 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\41097.exe\nFile description: GandCrab ransomware\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[d6535b7caf79cc9b624e5f8878aa1d8717bdd84778fde47caad4ed75e322ef97](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d6535b7caf79cc9b624e5f8878aa1d8717bdd84778fde47caad4ed75e322ef97/analysis/)\n\nFile size: 867,840 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\41097.exe\nFile description: GlobeImposter ransomware\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[41056643ee135ac0fce3237d69b32370102887b22c0250e2e0b515b25f525183](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/41056643ee135ac0fce3237d69b32370102887b22c0250e2e0b515b25f525183/analysis/)\n\nFile size: 22,528 bytes\nFile location: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\wmon32.exe\nFile description: Executable persistent for the GlobeImposter ransomware\ninfection\n\nThe following are URLs and domains associated with these infections:\n\n198.100.119.11 port 80 - 198.100.119.11 - GET /d1.jpg?rnd=53171  (returned\nransomware binaries)\n74.220.219.67 port 80 - psoeiras.net - GET /count.php?nu=103  (IP address check\nfrom GlobeImposter)\n66.171.248.178 port 80 - nomoreransom.coin - GET /  (IP address check from\nGandCrab)\n**_nomoreransom.bit  (domain associated with GandCrab)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_gandcrab.bit  (domain associated with GandCrab)_**\n**_hxxp://djfl3vltmo36vure.onion/sdlskglkehhr  (GlobeImposter decryptor)_**\n\n**_Final words_**\n\nAlthough ransomware is down compared to last year, every once in a while we still see a\nwave of malspam like this, pushing recent ransomware families seen in prior massdistribution campaigns. So far in 2018, GlobeImposter and GandCrab are the only ones I've\nseen in mass-distribution malspam. However, these recent samples don't seem to be any\nmore dangerous now than they were before.\n\nAs always, properly-administered Windows hosts are unlikely to get infected. To infect their\ncomputers, users would have to ignore multiple warnings to retrieve and activate the\nmalicious Word document, which includes bypassing Protected View. System administrators\nand the technically inclined can also implement best practices like Software Restriction\nPolicies (SRP) or [AppLocker to prevent these types of infections.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd759117(v=ws.11).aspx)\n\n[Pcap and malware samples for today's diary can be found here.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/03/07/index.html)\n\n--Brad Duncan\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\nKeywords:\n\n[0 comment(s)](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Ransomware+news+GlobeImposter+gets+a+facelift+GandCrab+is+still+out+there/23417/)\n\nJoin us at SANS!
