But\nbased on how Lazarus Group actors have typically operated in the past, the attackers broke\nin via a spear-phishing email and then moved laterally within the bank's network, according\nto researchers at Securonix\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attack is a good example of the fact that, while ATM and SWIFT transaction monitoring\nis important, it often is not enough, and may only give you 10%-20% of the required\ndetection coverage,\" the security vendor noted in its report.\n\nThe Cosmos Co-operative Bank is a 111-year old co-operative bank in India with branches in\n7 states and 39 major cities. Between August 10 and August 11, Lazarus Group operators\nmanaged to compromise an end-user system at the bank and used that to access and\ncompromise the institution's ATM infrastructure.\n\nPublicly available information and Securonix' own analysis suggest that the attackers used\nmultiple targeted malware exploits to set up a malicious ATM/POS proxy switch in parallel\nwith Cosmos Bank's own central switch.\n\nThey then broke or redirected the connection between the bank's ATM/POS central switch\nand its back-end Core Banking System. Securonix described the banking switch as a\ncomponent that is primarily used to perform routing and transaction-processing decisions.\n\n\"Based on the publicly available details, most likely there was noadditional hardware\ninstalled,\" says Oleg Kolesnikov, a member of the Securonix threat research team. \"The\nmalicious payment switch typicallycomes in the form of software, so this is likely what was\ninstalledand/or cloned/modified by the attackers to proxy the requests fromthe ATM terminals\ninstead of the existing switch.\"\n\n**ATM Withdrawls**\n\nThe attackers are believed to have increased the withdrawal limits on hundreds of targeted\naccounts at the bank and set them up so cash withdrawals could be made from the accounts\nfrom abroad. In total, operators working on behalf of Lazarus Group used 450 cloned nonEMV debit cards linked to accounts at Cosmos Bank to make some 12,000 international ATM\nwithdrawals and 2,849 domestic transactions totaling $11.5 million.\n\nBecause the attackers had previously tampered with the link between the banks' ATM switch\nand the core banking system, the required messages and codes for authorizing the debit\ncard withdrawals were never forwarded to the core banking system. So typical checks on\ncard number, card status, and PIN were never conducted. Instead, the attackers used the\nrogue ATM/POS switch that they had installed to send fake instructions for authorizing the\nfraudulent transactions.\n\nAbout two days after the initial break-in, the attackers gained access to Cosmos Banks'\nSWIFT environment and used it to illegally transfer $2 million to an account belonging to a\ntrading company at Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong.\n\nThe attack on Cosmos Bank's ATM network was different from typical jackpotting and black\nbox attacks where attackers physically tamper with ATMs to get them to spit out large\namounts of cash. In this case, the attack targeted the bank's core infrastructure and\n\n\n-----\n\neffectively bypassed all measures recommended by the Interpol for protecting a bank s ATM\ninfrastructure against logical attacks, Securonix said.\n\nWhat remains unclear is why Cosmos Bank did not receive any alerts when the connection\nbetween its ATM switch and core banking system was cut or when thousands of ATM\ntransactions that were clearly not normal were being made.\n\n\"We do not know for certain, but it is likely that the connection wasredirected such that the\nconnection remained active, and only themalicious requests in question were selectively\nredirected by themalicious component,\" Kolesnikov says. This would ensure that the\nmalicious requests never made it to thelegitimate payment switch, and therefore were never\nvisible at thecore backend system, he says.\n\nThe attack also likely involved a lot of malicious and suspicious attack behaviors that the\nbank should have spotted.\n\nBased on the publicly availabledetails, the attackers had to stand up a proxy switch capable\nofresponding to malicious transaction requests from the terminals, Kolesnikov says.\n\nTheyalso likely had to install some targeted malware components needed tomonitor the card\nmanagement process and the payment infrastructure, togain access to the SWIFT terminals\nand to understand the standardoperating procedures.\n\n**Related Content:**\n\n**_Black Hat Europe_**\n\n**_returns to London Dec 3-6 2018 with hands-on technical Trainings, cutting-edge_**\n**_Briefings, Arsenal open-source tool demonstrations, top-tier security solutions and_**\n**_service providers in the Business Hall.
