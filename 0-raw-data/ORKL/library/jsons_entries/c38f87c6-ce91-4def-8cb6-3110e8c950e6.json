    "plain_text": "# Dark Comet 2: Electric Boogaloo\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2012/10/dark-comet-2-electric-boogaloo/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2012/10/dark-comet-2-electric-boogaloo/)**\n\nAdam Kujawa October 5, 2012\n\nOver the past few weeks Jean-Piere Lesueur, A.K.A. DarkCoderSc, has been developing a\nnew version of the Dark Comet Remote Administration Tool which he is calling “Dark Comet\nLegacy.” This newer version of the tool includes numerous features that make the tool more\nuser-friendly and appear more legitimate. In addition, DarkCoderSc continues to include\nnotices and required agreements that advise against using his tool for malicious purposes.\nHe also mentions that if it IS used for evil, that he is not liable for any damages done. In this\nblog we will look at this new version of DC as well as look at how earlier versions used in the\npast, and whether you should be concerned by this new version.\n\n## Dark Comet’s Past\n\nIf you have kept up with my blogs, you know that I have mentioned Dark Comet numerous\ntimes. These blog posts talk about the previous version of Dark Comet that included a\nserver binary creator that could be used to infect a system without the user ever knowing\nabout it. Other blogs mentioned how it was used in such ways as an espionage tool in the\nconflicts in Syria and a mention about how DarkCoderSc announced the retirement of Dark\nComet because of its use as a malicious tool.\n\n[You Dirty RAT! Part 1 – DarkComet](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2012/06/you-dirty-rat-part-1-darkcomet/)\n\n[BlackShades in Syria](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2012/06/blackshades-in-syria/)\n\n[BlackShades Co-Creator Arrested!](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2012/07/blackshades-co-creator-arrested/)\n\nIn addition to its political past, Dark Comet was most used to steal information and spy on\nunsuspecting users by both amateur and professional cyber criminals. Although, throughout\nits entire past, DarkCoderSc continued to discourage malicious use of his tool that he\nprovided free.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Dark Comet Legacy\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, DarkCoderSc has released a new version of Dark Comet\nknown as Dark Comet: Legacy. This new version is designed much more like legitimate\nsoftware to be used by the average computer user.\n\nThe Dark Comet Legacy Viewer Interface\n\nOne of the more user-friendly features is the brand new installers included with both the RAT\ncontroller/client and the server module. This makes it more user-friendly because the\naverage user can just double click the installers, install the software and even be able to find\nthe controller application in the Start Menu. As far as the module goes, using the traditional\napproach by using an installer application makes it difficult for the novice attacker to try to\nhide the installation of the application as with the previous version of Dark Comet that could\nbe installed by only executing the binary.\n\nDark Comet Legacy Module Installer Screen\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the server module includes a GUI that makes it easy for the user to configure a\ncallback address on the fly rather than needing to recreate another binary with new\ninstructions. The use of the GUI also makes it more difficult to hide the use of the server\nmodule from an unsuspecting user who might have had their system compromised via\nphysical means or otherwise.\n\nDark Comet Legacy Server Module GUI\n\nDark Comet Legacy includes all the same functionality of the original Dark Comet, with the\nexception of the “Fun Functions” making it less of a tool to pull pranks on people with and\nmore a legitimate system-monitoring tool. You could compare Dark Comet Legacy to some of\nthe other legitimate system monitoring tools like TeamViewer; in addition, it has numerous\npurposes to keep your information and your family safe.\n\nIt might be used to:\n\nKeep an eye on your kids\nAccess your system remotely in case of being locked out\nRemotely control systems on a private network\nHave access to key-logging and webcam monitoring to know who might be using your\nsystem if it is stolen.\n\n## Is it still a threat?\n\nWhile there are numerous purposes for Dark Comet Legacy to be used as a legitimate\nsystem-monitoring tool, it is in no way considered “Not a threat.” In fact, if you were to find\nthe server module running on your system, you should consider yourself compromised.\nNumerous Anti-Malware and antivirus products will agree that Dark Comet Legacy can still\nbe used for malicious purposes, if not for its functionality than for the ability to undermine\nDarkCoderSc’s good intentions. I will go over a few of ways in which DC Legacy can be used\nin the same fashion as the original DC a little later and prove why it is necessary (at least for\n\n\n-----\n\nnow) to detect this tool as malware. DarkCoderSC and his company Phrozensoft\nacknowledge this fact and advise disabling Anti-Malware/antivirus applications when using\nDC Legacy.\n\n## Possible Infection Scenarios\n\nNow that we have described what Dark Comet Legacy is capable of and how it can be used\nlegitimately as well as the reasons why it would be difficult for amateur cyber criminals to use\nit to steal personal information or more, we will look into how this tool can be used\nmaliciously just as the original Dark Comet was.\n\n**Masked as a legitimate application**\n\nThis method is commonly associated with Rogue AV products that claim to detect malicious\nsoftware on an otherwise clean system and when installed, infects the system with\nsubsequent malware. An attacker might target novice computer users, informing them that\nDC Legacy is actually a tool that can help the user to remove malware or make their systems\nrun faster. This method requires a high amount of social engineering to accomplish and\nbeing able to convince a novice to install malware themselves.\n\n**Installed along with other software**\n\nThis method is often found within download site installers that are included along with\nlegitimate software from shady websites. Usually, these installers will add toolbars or\nspyware to the system executing it. In this case, it could easily begin the installation process\nfor DC Legacy by explaining it as a necessary tool to make the intended application work\ncorrectly.\n\n**Could be manually installed by other malware**\n\nThe installation of malware by other malware is not a new thing, however it is possible for\none malware to manually install DC Legacy by modifying the registry settings, saving the\nfiles and doing everything else the installer does for the user, automatically using the\nmalware. I can personally see this method as being used frequently by cyber-criminals\nattempting to spread malware.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDarkCoderSc created the original Dark Comet with good intentions although it was abused\nby cyber-criminals in order to steal personal information, spy on unsuspecting users and use\nit for their own nefarious purposes without the user ever knowing. Dark Comet Legacy may\nfollow the same path as its predecessor, created with even more of a legitimate purpose in\nmind however easily modified and molded to be used for malicious purposes. Check out the\nreasons behind the re-birth of Dark Comet on the Phrozensoft blog:\n\n[DarkComet RAT Legacy](http://phrozenblog.com/?p=420)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DC family is not the only set of tools created for legitimate purposes then abused by\ncyber criminals; tools like Netcat, NetBus and even a tool like a telnet terminal can be used\nfor malicious purposes easily and therefore are often grouped into the malware or hacker\ntool category. The tool itself, outside of full-blown malware, is often developed to make\nthings easier or give the user more power and control than they had before, some are\ncreated for educational purposes and some are created for administration. However, at the\nend of the day, it is in the intention of the tools user that determines whether it is used for evil\nand if the possibility exists that a tool might be abused to cause harm to other users,\ncompanies like Malwarebytes and others have no choice other than to protect their\ncustomers from harm.\n\n\n-----",
