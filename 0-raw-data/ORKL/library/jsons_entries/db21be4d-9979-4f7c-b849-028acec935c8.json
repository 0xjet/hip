Based on these new details and Cisco Talos' continued investigatory\nwork, we have discovered several previously unidentified connections that strongly support\nthe notion that these attacks were part of a broader, ongoing disinformation campaign\nagainst Ukraine. This culminated in the addition of a section related to the ongoing\ndisinformation campaigns associated with these incidents. Below are some of the high-level\nupdates:\n\n\n-----\n\nDetails of CERT-UA Advisory, including example bash commands.\nDetails of SSSCIP advisory outlining a false flag operation, including additional\nanalysis.\n[Disinformation section added to outline various components of disinformation](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/ukraine-campaign-delivers-defacement.html#disinfo%20)\nobserved.\nCisco Talos has determined with moderate confidence that there is an ongoing\ndisinformation campaign attempting to attribute these attacks to Ukrainian groups that\ndate back at least nine months.\nCisco Talos has also found connections between actors in this campaign and\nFancyBear disinformation campaigns dating back to 2016-2017.\n\nIn late January, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) released\nan [advisory detailing newly released information regarding the attacks.](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18101)\n\n[Another advisory, published by the State Service of Special Communication and Information](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/informaciya-shodo-imovirnoyi-provokaciyi)\nProtection of Ukraine (SSSCIP), states that the ransomware attack may be a false flag\noperation intentionally crafted to appear as the work of a pro-Ukrainian group. In this post,\n[we have added a new section labeled \"Role of disinformation in campaign\" detailing the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/ukraine-campaign-delivers-defacement.html#disinfo)\nevidence provided by the advisory.\n\nCisco Talos has also done additional analysis on the connection between WhisperKill and\nWhiteBlackCrypt. The details of the findings, including the ties into ongoing disinformation\ncampaigns are included in this update.\n\nSeveral cyber attacks against Ukrainian government websites — including website\ndefacements and destructive wiper malware — have made headlines over the past few\nweeks as military tensions along the Russian/Ukrainian border have escalated. As a\nlongtime intelligence partner and ally, Cisco Talos quickly responded to provide support,\nworking with the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine (SSSCIP), the\nCyberpolice Department of the National Police of Ukraine and the National Coordination\nCenter for Cybersecurity (NCCC at the NSDC of Ukraine).\n\nBased on our analysis of the wiper malware, dubbed WhisperGate, we identified the\nfollowing key points:\n\nWhile WhisperGate has some strategic similarities to the notorious NotPetya wiper that\nattacked Ukranian entities in 2017, including masquerading as ransomware and\ntargeting and destroying the master boot record (MBR) instead of encrypting it, it\nnotably has more components designed to inflict additional damage.\n\nWe assess that attackers used stolen credentials in the campaign and they likely had\naccess to the victim network for months before the attack, a typical characteristic of\n[sophisticated advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.](https://talosintelligence.com/podcasts/shows/talos_takes/episodes/20)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe multi-stage infection chain downloads a payload that wipes the MBR, then\ndownloads a malicious DLL file hosted on a Discord server, which drops and executes\nanother wiper payload that destroys files on the infected machines.\n\nWe echo the recommendations from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\n[Agency (CISA) that organizations with ties to Ukraine should carefully consider how to](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights-Implement_Cybersecurity_Measures_Now_to_Protect_Against_Critical_Threats_508C.pdf)\nisolate and monitor those connections to protect themselves from potential collateral\ndamage.\n\n## Recent Ukraine attacks represent ongoing threats to partner organizations\n\nWe were forced to cancel a trip to Kyiv in early 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt was unfortunate to lose the opportunity to reunite with friends and colleagues, and also to\nvisit Ostannya Barykada, one of our favorite restaurants there. In short, Talos has been\nworking for years in Ukraine – even prior to NotPetya – to secure a safe and stable\ncomputing environment there.\n\nThe recent activities in Ukraine, whether the defacement of almost 80 government websites\nor the discovery of wiper malware at various government agencies, feel familiar. In fact, if it\nweren't for the obvious increase in geopolitical tensions in the region, we would simply\nconsider it winter in Ukraine. To put it another way, we've seen this kind of activity on and off\nfor years, and while we are quick to render assistance, we see no reason to panic because\nof these events.\n\nHowever, defenders around the world should carefully watch the situation in Ukraine,\nparticularly after the global impact of the Ukraine-centric attack that was NotPetya. In that\ncase, an attack that was intended to punish Ukraine had a wide-ranging, global impact. Any\norganization that had any sort of business connection to Ukraine could be affected. Because\nof this history, organizations with ties to Ukraine should consider how to isolate and monitor\nthose connections to protect themselves, a recommendation we made in 2017 and continue\nto stand by today.\n\nAs we wrote [during the \"NotPetya\" campaign in 2017:](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/the-medoc-connection.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on this, Talos is advising that any organization with ties to Ukraine treat\nsoftware like M.E.Doc and systems in Ukraine with extra caution since they have been\nshown to be targeted by advanced threat actors. This includes providing them a\nseparate network architecture, increased monitoring and hunting activities in those atrisk systems and networks and allowing only the level of access absolutely necessary\nto conduct business. Patching and upgrades should be prioritized on these systems\nand customers should move to transition these systems to Windows 10, following the\nguidance from Microsoft on securing those systems. Additional guidance for network\nsecurity baselining is available from Cisco as well. Network IPS should be deployed on\nconnections between international organizations and their Ukrainian branches and\nendpoint protection should be installed immediately on all Ukrainian systems.\"\n\nWe're sharing what information we can on the events in Ukraine to assist defenders globally\nin understanding the threat and crafting a defensive approach appropriate for their situation.\nEvents can move quickly, so organizations need to be constantly evaluating potential\nexposures to the situation now and elevating their level of security around the connections,\nsoftware and processes that connect them to Ukraine.\n\n## Role of disinformation in campaign\n\nNew information has surfaced that indicates that elements of recent attacks in Ukraine\nrepresented an effort to create multiple false narratives intended to complicate attribution\nattempts and create plausible deniability for the actor behind the attacks. Our findings\nindicate the actor attempted to blame multiple parties, including both Poland and Ukrainians\nthemselves, despite the fact that technical indicators surrounding the attack do not support\nthese false narratives. We've seen tactics like this in the region and elsewhere in incidents\nlike Olympic Destroyer. The intent is not to actually convince people that someone else was\nthe source, but instead to introduce enough doubt that it is politically useful either now or in\nfuture operations.\n\nFirst, the defacements appeared in several different languages, including Polish. It was the\nPolish translation that was the first indicator since it was quickly discovered to just be a\ntranslation of the message in Russian using the popular platform yandex.ru's translation\ncapabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Defaced website containing Yandex Polish translation._\n\nSSSCIP has also made a connection between WhisperKill, a component of the WhisperGate\nmalware that was deployed on Ukrainian systems, and the Encrypt3d ransomware, also\nknown as WhiteBlackCrypt. WhiteBlackCrypt was reportedly used in operations against\nRussian targets in 2021. The advisory states that there is over eighty percent similarity\nbetween them. Cisco Talos has completed initial analysis and agrees that there is substantial\noverlap between the two samples.\n\nAnother connection that SSSCIP has noted is that the ransom note displayed by Encrypt3d\ncontains an ASCII representation of a trident symbol that is part of Ukraine's coat of arms.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ransom note with Ukrainian trident vs Ukrainian Coat of Arms._\n\n\n-----\n\nSSSCIP asserts the campaign is likely a false-flag operation in an attempt to create a fake\nnarrative of a pro-Ukrainian group attacking its own government. This is a known tactic\nemployed by actors in this region.\n\n### WhiteBlackCrypt analysis points to long-running disinformation campaign\n\nCisco Talos researchers took a deeper look at the connection between WhisperKill and\nWhiteBlackCrypt, specifically at the origins of WhiteBlackCrypt and its usage in the wild.\n\nWe started searching various forums for WhiteBlackCrypt advertisements. In our experience\nin the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) space, this is one of the first things we notice with\nnew ransomware variants that are looking to retain members and achieve notoriety. Typically,\nRaaS affiliate programs seek to maximize partnership numbers by advertising themselves on\nknown cybercriminal platforms or some version of their own blog or website. However, Talos\nhas not been able to find any historical evidence of WhiteBlackCrypt operators advertising on\nunderground cybercrime forums. In fact, we could not identify any activity on the dark web\nrelated to WhiteBlackCrypt.\n\nNext, we pivoted to the email addresses Wbgroup022@gmail[.]com and\nWhiteblackgroup002@gmail[.]com that are listed on the ransom note. We traced the emails\nback to a blog post and article created in July 2020 titled, \"Where Did Nastya Hide the\nOseledets?\" (Translated from Ukrainian to English). Oseledets is a Ukrainian Cossack style\nof haircut. The blog post is intended for a Russian-speaking audience, but the title is in\nUkrainian, presumably with the intent to \"troll.\" We assess with moderate confidence that this\nmay be tied to a disinformation campaign around activities in and around Ukraine.\n\nThe blog post falsely summarized what it alleged to be a Ukrainian military unit that engaged\nin an espionage campaign targeting Russian citizens. This was done through the use of fake\npersonas, specifically young women, a tactic that is fairly common among threat actors and\nis referred to as a [honey trap. The blog goes on to describe the specifics of the campaign,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_trapping)\nincluding the alleged infiltration of several Ukranian news blogs and associated social media\naccounts. Importantly, it also provided an indexed list of all the personas used in this\ncampaign. It was in this list that we found a persona named \"Zebra.\" As you'll notice in the\nscreenshot below, Zebra (\"зебра\" in Russian) is associated with two of the email addresses\nfound in the ransom note for WhiteBlackCrypt and WhisperKill.\n\n\n-----\n\n_'Zebra' persona and ties to ransom note email addresses._\n\nThis puts the creation of the emails and their alleged use in a fake Ukrainian disinformation\ncampaign to at least the summer of 2020, approximately eight or nine months before the\nfake ransomware campaign. Cisco Talos tried to find any evidence of a Ukrainian-backed\ndisinformation campaign outlined in the blog post, but thus far have been unsuccessful in\ncorroborating these claims.\n\n\n-----\n\n_WhiteBlackGroup User Image_\n\nDuring our research into the email addresses that appeared in the WhisperKill ransom note,\nwe found further references to WhiteBlackGroup/Zebra. These include findings that refer\nback to similar motifs, including white, black and zebras. We were able to find an account\nthat was registered on the same platforms where the LiveJournal entries were found. The\nuser \"whiteblackgroup\" had a headline claiming \"Caution! Russian Propaganda!\" (translated\nfrom Russian to English) and also made use of a profile picture that includes a zebra, which\nis also the name of the persona referenced above and could also be an additional reference\nto white and black. The headline is associated with a blog posted by Zebra that accused\nRussia of carrying out a disinformation campaign against Ukraine to validate themselves\nthrough anti-Russian posts.\n\n_Headline about Russian Propaganda_\n\n[Upon further research, Talos researchers found threeadditionalcopies of this particular blog](https://colonelcassad.livejournal.com/6011806.html)\non LiveJournal blogs. These particular blogs appear to focus on anti-Western and antiUkrainian disinformation. One notable difference between these three blogs and the original\nis they all linked to another publication which was the earliest version of the blog we could\n[find. That version was published by an entity called Analytical Service of Donbas (ASD)](https://asd.news/)\n\n\n-----\n\n(translated from Russian into English). This blog is dedicated to the amplification of\nmisinformation related to the current tensions in Ukraine. Specifically, it appears to be\ncurated for citizens within the occupied Ukrainian region of Donbas and Russia.\n\nWe began to look a little deeper at ASD, specifically the authors that publish articles on the\nsite. This led us to Boris Rozhin. We pivoted and found that this author also posts under an\nalias, Colonel Cassad. After some additional digging, we found two Telegram channels —\none using his real name, the other using the same Colonel Cassad alias. The Telegram\nchannels appear to focus on exposing fake Ukrainian military operations or exposing or\ndoxing members of Ukrainian militia units. Several blog posts appear to describe Boris\nRozhin as someone who is an active supporter of Ukrainian separatists in occupied Donbas\nand who has developed other media that spreads Ukrainian-focused misinformation.\n\nAt this point, we could not correlate the original \"Where Did Nastya Hide the Oseledets?\"\nblog and Boris Rozhin. The connection ended up relying on another name: JokerDNR.\nJokerDNR is a persona and Telegram channel that describes itself as \"the channel with\nstolen Ukrainian military documents – who steals them? That's not clear, but it is very\ninteresting\" (translated from Russian to English). This Telegram channel shared the\nOseledets blog post and the three LiveJournal reposts mentioned above.\n\nWe've made several connections between Boris Rozhin and JokerDNR. In 2019, Boris\nRozhin's Telegram pseudonym (@Colonel Cassad), listed JokerDNR as part of a list of\n[recommended Telegram channels. Another blog post directly refers to Boris Rozhin as Joker](https://chernayakobra.ru/lt-col-garbuzyuk-ruled-the-pogroms-in-alma-ata/)\nand JokerDNR and falsely alluded to Ukrainian forces as being a part of the political violence\nthat occurred in Kazakhstan in January 2022. This false narrative described a military officer\nfrom the Ukrainian military that was part of an information warfare unit that operated in\nKazakhstan. The military officer is described as a \"compliment to 'Joker' military expert Boris\nRozhin.\" JokerDNR also took responsibility for leaking NATO and Ukrainian Navy information\nin July 2021.\n\nWe can also link Boris Rozhin to a major disinformation campaign linked to FancyBear APT\nactivity. This occurred during a research revelation from 2016-2017 where CrowdStrike\nreported the FancyBear APT group had compromised a mobile app used by Ukrainian\n[artillery forces. The report alleged that the compromise led to \"larger than average losses to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/brochures/FancyBearTracksUkrainianArtillery.pdf)\nUkrainian artillery.\" They based this research on a report from the International Institute of\nStrategic Studies, a think tank in London. However, the original source of the information was\na false report that was part of an article shared on a site called the Saker. This site focuses\n[on sharing pro-Russian views on conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. An article in VOA News](https://www.voanews.com/a/skeptics-doubt-ukraine-hack-link-to-dnc-cyberattack/3649234.html)\nfound the author of that particular document was a blogger named \"Boris Rozhin:\"\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nCrowdStrike told VOA its information on those losses came from what it described as\nan analysis from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a Londonbased think tank.\n\"We cited the public, third-party reference source that was quoted,\" VOA was told.\nBut the source referenced in the CrowdStrike report on its website is not the site of\nthe actual IISS, but an article on The Saker, a site that presents a largely proRussian version of events in Syria and Ukraine.\n…\nThe article is an English translation from a post first published by Boris Rozhin, a\npopular Russian blogger, who covers Russian military operations under the moniker\n\"Colonel Cassad\" from Russian-annexed Crimea.\n\n```\nThe blog post in question cites a false IISS report that Rozhin uses to write a story that\nfalsely asserts that Ukrainian artillery forces suffered bigger losses. According to Rozhin, the\narticles he based the blog on were obtained from Russian torrent sites.\n\nThere are a few indications that can point to an ulterior motive when it comes to the emails\nassociated with the Zebra persona. As mentioned, the WhisperKill ransomware didn't\ndemonstrate any motivations to actually financially benefit from their campaign. Additionally,\nthe emails appeared openly in public reports. Ransomware cartels typically exercise basic\noperational security and do not reuse an email that has already been exposed publicly.\nUnless there is a parallel narrative where the use of these emails could serve a purpose. It is\nplausible that the WhiteBlackGroup persona is part of a broader, long-term coordinated\ndisinformation mechanism that seeks multi-layered validation, perhaps as similar to the one\nreported byCrowdStrike.\n\nCisco Talos assesses with high confidence that the email addresses and other associated\n\"flags\" identified in these ransomware campaigns are designed to implicate Ukrainians in the\nactivity, a fact that can be leveraged by Russia in a variety of ways. This stands in agreement\nwith similar statements made by both SSSCIP and more broadly by the Ukrainian\ngovernment. Talos associated the emails used in the WhiteBlackCrypt ransom notes to\nsuspicious content dating back at least nine months. Additionally, the ransomware itself\nprovided no mechanism for recovery, eliminating the possibility that the campaign was for\nfinancial gain. The email addresses have been published in blogs and amplified in Telegram\nchannels with questionable motivations, and are likely associated with anti-Western and proRussian themes. These findings, along with the examples of Boris Rozhin's previous\nattempts to inject disinformation, point to a broader coordinated disinformation campaign\nseeking multi-layer validation and the ability to push narratives into Western media.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Multi-stage infection chain delivers destructive wiper malware\n\nIn their [advisory published on Jan. 26, 2022, CERT-UA asserted that the initial vector for the](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18101)\nmalware, dubbed WhisperGate, was either a supply-chain attack or exploitation. Below is a\ntranslated excerpt of this statement:\n\n\"The most likely vector for a cyber attack is the compromise of the supply chain, which has\nmade it possible to use existing trust links to disable related information and\ntelecommunications and automated systems. At the same time, two other possible attack\nvectors are not ruled out, namely the exploitation of OctoberCMS and Log4j vulnerabilities.\"\n\nThe first payload in this infection is responsible for the initial attempt at wiping the systems.\nThe malware executable wipes the master boot record (MBR) and replaces it with the code\nresponsible for displaying the ransom note. Similar to the notorious NotPetya wiper that\nmasqueraded as ransomware during its 2017 campaign, WhisperGate is not intended to be\nan actual ransom attempt, since the MBR is completely overwritten and has no recovery\noptions. This wiper also tries to destroy the C:\\ partition by overwriting it with fixed data. The\nadditional steps taken to wipe the actual hard drive partition differentiate its behavior from\nother wiper malware like NotPetya.\n\nHowever, most modern systems today have switched to GUID Partition Table (GPT) from\nMBR, which allows for larger file systems and has fewer limitations, potentially limiting some\nof the impacts of this executable. As a result, there were additional stages and additional\npayloads that could inflict more damage to end systems.\n\n### Second stage\n\nThe second stage of the infection chain is a downloader that retrieves a third stage from a\nDiscord server URL that's hard-coded in the downloader. The downloader starts by executing\na base64-encoded PowerShell command twice to make the endpoint sleep for 20 seconds.\n```\n// Start-Sleep -s 10\npowershell -enc UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAALQBzACAAMQAwAA==\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n_Sleeps the downloader._\n\nAfter that, it downloads a file from Discord. The downloaded file is in reverse byte order.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Downloads file from Discord._\n\nThe downloader restores the downloaded file by reversing the bytes within the file.\n\n_Method that reverses the downloaded file._\n\nThe restored file is a DLL and serves as the third stage of the infection chain. After\nrestoration, it loads the third-stage DLL and proceeds to retrieve all of its public methods to\nsearch for a method with the name \"Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph\". If the method is found, the\ndownloader will execute it by calling \".Invoke(null, null)\", transferring the execution flow over\nto the third-stage DLL.\n\n_Retrieving third-stage public methods using Type.GetMethods._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Compare if method name is \"Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph\"._\n\n_Executes Ylfwdwgmpilzyaph by calling MethodBase.Invoke._\n\n### Third stage\n\nThe third stage of the infection chain is a DLL written in C# and obfuscated with Eazfuscator.\nIt is a dropper that drops and executes a fourth-stage wiper payload. Unlike the first stage\nwiper, the main objective of the fourth stage wiper is to delete all data on the endpoint. The\nfourth-stage wiper payload is probably a contingency plan if the first-stage wiper fails to clear\nthe endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Static analysis._\n\nThe third-stage DLL starts off by dropping a VBScript named \"Nmddfrqqrbyjeygggda.vbs\"\ninto the %TEMP% directory and executes it. The script modifies Windows Defender settings\nto exclude the target logical drive it is going to wipe from scheduled and real-time scanning.\n```\nObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"powershell Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\\'\" \n0, False\n\n```\n_Drops VBScript using File.WriteAllText._\n\n_Executes VBScript using Process.Start._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decrypted resource is a DLL file embedded with two resources named AdvancedRun\nand \"Waqybg\" that are compressed with GZip.\n\n_Two resources embedded in the decrypted resource._\n\n\"AdvancedRun.exe\" is a tool provided by Nirsoft to execute a program with different settings.\nOnce the tool is dropped, the third stage DLL will leverage it to execute two commands in the\ncontext of the Windows TrustedInstaller group. The TrustedInstaller group was an addition to\nWindows beginning in Windows 7 with the goal of preventing accidental damage to critical\nsystem files. AdvanceRun is one of the tools that can be used to execute commands in the\ncontext of the TrustedInstaller user. This functionality is only available via CLI and requires\nthe flag of \"/RunAs 8\", which is shown in the commands below. The tool will be deleted from\nthe %TEMP% directory after executing both commands. The first command leverages the\nWindows service control application (sc.exe) to disable Windows Defender.\n```\n\"%TEMP%\\AdvancedRun.exe\" /EXEFilename \"C:\\Windows\\System32\n\\sc.exe\" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine \"stop WinDefend\" /StartDirectory \"\" /RunAs 8\n/Run\n\n```\nThe second command leverages Windows PowerShell to execute a Windows utility called\n\"rmdir\" to delete all the files and directories that are related to Windows Defender, such as\nscan results, quarantined files and definition updates.\n```\n\"%TEMP%\\AdvancedRun.exe\" /EXEFilename \"C:\\Windows\\System32\n\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine \"rmdir 'C:\\Progra\nmData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender' -Recurse\" /StartDirectory \"\" /RunAs 8 /Run\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNext, the third-stage DLL will load the Waqybg resource into memory. As the resource is\nstored in reverse byte order, the third-stage DLL will restore it by reversing the bytes and\nthen proceed to decompress it. The decompressed data is the fourth stage wiper payload.\nAfter decompressing the data, the third-stage DLL copies a legitimate Windows utility\n\"InstallUtil.exe\" into the %TEMP% directory, creates a suspended process with it and injects\nthe fourth-stage wiper into the process. Finally, it resumes the process and transfers the\nexecution flow to the fourth-stage wiper.\n\n_Creates InstallUtil.exe process._\n\n### Fourth stage\n\nThe fourth-stage wiper starts off by enumerating from A to Z, looking for fixed and remote\nlogical drives in the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Enumerates logical drives._\n\nFor each enumeration, it performs a breadth-first search to wipe the files in the logical drive\nwhile ignoring files located in the \"%HOMEDRIVE%\\Windows\" directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Performs breadth-first search wiping._\n\nIt also only wipes files that have specific file extensions:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n.HTML .HTM .SHTML .XHTML .PHTML .PHP .JSP .ASP .PHPS .PHP5 .ASPX .PHP4 .PHP6 .PHP7\n.PHP3 .DOC .DOCX .XLS .XLSX .PPT .PPTX .PST .OST .MSG .EML .VSD .VSDX .TXT .CSV .RTF\n.WKS .WK1 .PDF .DWG .ONETOC2 .SNT .JPEG .JPG .DOCB .DOCM .DOT .DOTM .DOTX .XLSM .XLSB\n.XLW .XLT .XLM .XLC .XLTX .XLTM .PPTM .POT .PPS .PPSM .PPSX .PPAM .POTX .POTM .EDB\n.HWP .602 .SXI .STI .SLDX .SLDM .BMP .PNG .GIF .RAW .CGM .SLN .TIF .TIFF .NEF .PSD\n.AI .SVG .DJVU .SH .CLASS .JAR .BRD .SCH .DCH .DIP .PL .VB .VBS .PS1 .BAT .CMD .JS\n.ASM .H .PAS .CPP .C .CS .SUO .ASC .LAY6 .LAY .MML .SXM .OTG .ODG .UOP .STD .SXD .OTP\n.ODP .WB2 .SLK .DIF .STC .SXC .OTS .ODS .3DM .MAX .3DS .UOT .STW .SXW .OTT .ODT .PEM\n.P12 .CSR .CRT .KEY .PFX .DER .OGG .RB .GO .JAVA .INC .WAR .PY .KDBX .INI .YML .PPK\n.LOG .VDI .VMDK .VHD .HDD .NVRAM .VMSD .VMSN .VMSS .VMTM .VMX .VMXF .VSWP .VMTX .VMEM\n.MDF .IBD .MYI .MYD .FRM .SAV .ODB .DBF .DB .MDB .ACCDB .SQL .SQLITEDB .SQLITE3 .LDF\n.SQ3 .ARC .PAQ .BZ2 .TBK .BAK .TAR .TGZ .GZ .7Z .RAR .ZIP .BACKUP .ISO .VCD .BZ\n.CONFIG\n\n```\n_192 file extensions_\n\n_Comparing file extension._\n\nThe wiper will overwrite the content of each file with 1MB worth of 0xCC bytes and rename\nthem by appending each filename with a random four-byte extension.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Wiping the file._\n\nAfter the wiping process completes, it performs a delayed command execution using Ping to\ndelete \"InstallerUtil.exe\" from the %TEMP% directory.\n\n_Deleting InstallerUtil.exe._\n\nFinally, it attempts to flush all file buffers to disk and stop all running processes (including\nitself) by calling ExitWindowsEx Windows API with EWX_SHUTDOWN flag.\n\n_Calling ExitWindowsEx with EWX_SHUTDOWN._\n\n\n-----\n\n### Additional behavior and network proliferation\n\nDuring the investigation, CERT-UA observed unauthorized behaviour by legitimate accounts.\nAs seen in the .bash history file shown below, the attacker added a new user, added it to a\nprivileged group, and downloaded a file.\n\n_[Screenshot from CERT-UA advisory](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18101)_\n\nAs stated by CERT-UA, it is likely that the attackers utilized the Impacket tools \"wmiexec\"\nand \"smbexec\" to proliferate across networks.

This mirrors the recommendations we made in 2017 shortly\nafter NotPetya and our analysis of the malware's effects.\n\nThose recommendations still hold true today: Systems in Ukraine face challenges that may\nnot apply to those in other regions of the world, and extra protections and precautionary\nmeasures need to be applied. Making sure those systems are both patched and hardened is\nof the utmost importance to help mitigate the threats the region faces.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nHashes\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 1 BootPatch (MBR Wiper)\n\na196c6b8ffcb97ffb276d04f354696e2391311db3841ae16c8c9f56f36a38e92\n\nStage 2 WhisperGate (Downloader)\n\ndcbbae5a1c61dbbbb7dcd6dc5dd1eb1169f5329958d38b58c3fd9384081c9b78\n\nStage 3 WhisperPack(Loader DLL)\n\n923eb77b3c9e11d6c56052318c119c1a22d11ab71675e6b95d05eeb73d1accd6 (Reversed\nDLL)\n\n9ef7dbd3da51332a78eff19146d21c82957821e464e8133e9594a07d716d892d (DLL)\n\nStage 4 WhisperKill (File Wiper)\n\n34ca75a8c190f20b8a7596afeb255f2228cb2467bd210b2637965b61ac7ea907\n\n\n-----",
