Here’s how it works: once an application is uploaded, the service immediately starts analyzing it for known malware, spyware and trojans. It also looks for behaviors that indicate an application might be misbehaving, and compares it against previously analyzed apps to detect possible red flags. We actually run every application on Google’s cloud infrastructure and simulate how it will run on an Android device to look for hidden, malicious behavior.\n\n\n###### for potentially\n\n on new applications,\n . It also\n on Google’s cloud\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 800 LBS ROBOT IN THE ROOM\n\n ● Bouncer is easily bypassed\n\n ● No surprise there\n\n ● Google is trying to solve a very difficult problem\n\n ● We'll show a bunch of ways\n\n ● System, network, framework, timing, etc\n\n ● Story of how we analyzed Bouncer\n\n ● Full of mystery and intrigue!\n\n ● Also, pinatas and beer!\n\n\n###### difficult problem\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GETTING STARTED\n\n ● How do we go about dissecting Bouncer?\n\n ● How would we create such a system?\n\n ● We had lots of unanswered questions:\n\n    ###### Does Bouncer use static/dynamic analysis?\n\n    ###### When does Bouncer analyze the app? Are all apps analyzed?\n\n    ###### How do we get Market accounts to start figuring this out?\n\n    ###### Network access: open, filtered, emulated, unrestricted?\n\n    ###### Environment: what's the system execution environment look like?\n\n    ###### Timing: how long does our app run? Accelerated clock?\n\n    ###### Input: Artificial input to the app?
