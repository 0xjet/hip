Part 1: DarkComet\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2012/06/you-dirty-rat-part-1-darkcomet/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2012/06/you-dirty-rat-part-1-darkcomet/)**\n\nAdam Kujawa June 9, 2012\n\nLast week, I talked a little about the Flame Trojan and how much the average user would\nneed to worry about being infected with it, which is none. State-sponsored RAT malware,\nlike Flame, would likely not infect average users and even in the off chance that it did, the\noperators behind the malware would probably remove the Trojan before being discovered.\nIts purpose is for very specifically targeted cyber-espionage, not stealing your Facebook\npassword.\n\nSo are you completely safe from malware like Flame? Well not exactly. Take out the statesponsored aspect of Flame and you’ve got a RAT or Remote Administration Trojan, of which\nthere are many out there that are used every single day to spy on the average people.\nBefore you get too freaked out, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware detects and removes these\nthreats all the time, so don’t worry too much about being a victim as long as you properly\nprotect your system.\n\nThis blog post is one of many which I am going to use to:\n\nDiscuss some of the RAT malware currently seen in the wild\nWhat they can do\nHow they work\nHow to protect yourself from them\n\nThis first blog is about DarkComet, a freely available Remote Administration “Tool” which\nwas developed by DarkCoderSC, an independent programmer and computer security\nspecialist from France. He advertises DarkComet as a tool and not a Trojan because of its\nmany useful functions which could be used to administer a network at a very close level.\nHowever, he also mentions that his tool is often used by hackers and hence it is often\ndetected by antivirus engines as being malicious. While the tool is free to download and use,\nhe offers the “VIP” service, which gives the user access to direct support, updates about the\nproduct and the ability to post new ideas or software bugs, all for 20 Euros or $25.\n\n## Features\n\nThe Flame malware could do a lot of stuff, although not completely analyzed we know that it\ncan take screenshots, modify/create/delete files and execute a keylogger. However, the\ncapability of most RATs takes that functionality and multiplies it significantly. DarkComet is no\ndifferent; it can execute over 60 different server side functions, meaning the type of things it\ncan execute/monitor/control on the infected system.\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: For the sake of talking about RATs, you need to turn the usual definition of client server around. In\nthis case the “server” is the RAT implant running on the infected system while the “client” is the controller\napplication used by the attacker.\n\nHere is a list of some of the pretty nasty things which this RAT can do:\n\nFind out all system information, including hardware being used and the exact version of\nyour operating system, including security patches.\nControl all the processes currently running on your system\nView and modify your registry\nModify your Hosts file\nControl your computer from a remote shell\nModify your startup processes and services, including adding a few\nof its own\nExecute various types of scripts on your system\nModify/View/Steal your files\nPut files of its own on your system\nSteal your stored password\nListen to your microphone\nLog your keystrokes (duh)\nScan your network\nView your network shares\nMess with your MSN Messenger / Steal your contacts / Add new\ncontacts!\nSteal from your clipboard (things you’ve copied)\nControl your printer\nLock/Restart/Shutdown your computer\nUpdate the implant with a new address to beacon to or new\nfunctionality\n\nThose are only some of what this baby can do; I left out a few of the big\nones because I wanted to go into more detail about them. Also, they are my\nfavorite!\n\n**Fun Functions:**\n\nA lot of RATs include “Fun Functions” to mess with the system (and minds) of the victim. In\nmany cases these are built in functions to play tricks on friends or just have fun at the\nexpense of the unfortunately infected user. DarkComet has multiple “Fun Functions” that I\nthought would be interesting to discuss and show you screenshots of\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fun Manager**\n\nThe Fun Manager is a set of different types of fun functions which an attacker can use\nagainst the user:\n\nIt includes:\n\nHiding the Desktop – Hiding all the icons and making it impossible to right click on the\ndesktop.\nHide the Clock – Self Explanatory\nHide Task Icons – In the little box on the right side of your start bar\nHide Sys Tray Icons – Hide icons and open application buttons on the taskbar\nHide Taskbar – Self Explanatory\nHide the Start Button – Only works in Win XP\nDisable the Start Button (XP Only) – Gray out the start button, disabling it.\nDisable TaskMgr – Disables the Windows Task Manager (When you hit Ctrl+Alt+Del)\nOpen/Close CD Tray – Self Explanatory\n\n**Piano**\n\nThe piano function is exactly what it sounds like, the ability to play a type of piano which can\nbe configured to play at different octaves. Another functionality of this feature is the ability to\nplay a custom sound at a specific frequency (in Hz) and for a custom duration (Ms). The\npurpose of this feature (as far as I can tell) is just to annoy people.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Send Message Box**\n\nThis is a pretty simple function which can mess with the user on a LOT of levels; it basically\nallows the attacker (or Administrator) to create a custom message box to the user, like an\nerror or informative notice that one would normally see. The interesting thing about this\nfeature is that not only are you able to create a message box belonging to the system but\nalso to any active Windows on the system, for example notepad or Windows Media Player.\nThe messages then appear to be coming from the application and that might make the user\nbelieve the application is malicious rather than the actual malware running behind the\nscenes.\n\n**Microsoft Reader**\n\nThis feature isn’t anything new and is more fun than anything. If you’ve ever used a Mac,\nyou know that one of the features of the text editor is to read the text you wrote out loud.\nThe Microsoft Reader function is no different and will read whatever the attacker types, to the\nunsuspecting user. I could only imagine the kind of shock and panic that the user would\nexperience upon hearing the electronic voice of evil saying to them “I OWN YOU” through\nthe speakers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Remote Chat**\n\nI think this feature is really fun, it gives the operator the ability to create a chat window on\nboth ends (server and client) in order to have a conversation with the infected user. This has\na lot of legitimate network administration purposes but none the less, it can really confuse a\nvictim.\n\nSo that sums up all of the Fun Features, I thought it would be a good idea to discuss them\nbecause quite frankly, RATs are the only malware I have found that have a sense of humor\nand it’s good to point out that not all malware is used to steal information or crash systems,\nsome of it still likes to just mess with people, the same way hackers of yesterday did it for\nfun.\n\n**Uninstall Applications:**\n\nUnfortunately, we need to stray from the lighthearted side of this blog post and talk about\nsome of the more scary functionality that DarkComet has. A very powerful and dangerous\nfunction of this RAT is the ability to uninstall applications at a whim. The attacker will receive\na listing of all installed applications and be given the option to uninstall them. This could be\nused for multiple reasons; however one of the big ones is to disable security products. Here\nis an example of the worst possible situation:\n\n\n-----\n\n_You have an antivirus engine running on your system; you paid a lot for it so you feel secure._\n_It came with an e-mail scanner so you don’t mind opening on any e-mails or links you don’t_\n_trust._\n\n_You get an e-mail from an unfamiliar source, telling you to click on a link to see a funny video_\n_of a LoLCat. You do so and are directed to a fake YouTube page; you shrug it off as nothing_\n_and go on your business._\n\n_Unbeknownst to you, the fake page exploited a zero-day browser exploit and infected your_\n_system with a DarkComet implant, this is a new variant of the malware and therefore, your_\n_AV has yet to write signatures to detect it. The first thing the controller of the RAT does is_\n_uninstall your antivirus engine, allowing it to do whatever it wants without being detected._\n\nAnother aspect of the Uninstall functionality is to remove security patches put into place to\nsecure security holes in the operating system. This could lead to the DarkComet removing\nsecurity measures put in place and being able to exploit older vulnerabilities in your\noperating system, allowing for even more malware to be downloaded to your system and\nexecuted. Now you are completely infected and your options are limited.\n\n**Remote Desktop:**\n\nThis is a pretty neat functionality that you don’t often see used by other RATs. It allows the\nattacker to not only see the active screen of the infected user but also be able to take control\nof the mouse and keyboard, using it as though they were sitting in front of the system itself.\n\nThis functionality is probably the most dangerous to the infected user because it can go\nbeyond what the Uninstall function can do and instead of just uninstalling an AV engine, it\ncan set the DarkComet executable to “Allowed”. This means that even though the users\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem is completely infected with DarkComet, the AV engine will not bother to try and stop\nit. This is something that many users might never know is even happening.\n\nThe drawbacks to this functionality is how loud it is, imagine playing an online game, you will\nreceive data from the remote server in order to see what is going on in the game and the\nactions of other players, however you will also be sending a large amount of data as you\ninteract with the game itself. This is along the same lines as if the remote desktop was being\nrun, in which case it is possible to experience some serious network lag and for experienced\ncomputer users who might be running network monitoring software, a suspicious clue to\nsomething being very wrong.\n\n**DDOS**\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, DarkComet is advertised as a network administration tool that helps\nto control systems in a network. Most of the functionality we have seen here so far (except\nfor the Fun Functions) can be used to that end and you couldn’t really dispute the use and\npurpose of the RAT. However, there is one question I have:\n\nConsidering that this is a Remote Administration Tool, to be used for good and what\nnot….WHY DOES IT HAVE DDOS FUNCTIONALITY!?\n\nAs you probably know, DDOS means Distributed Denial of Service and is an attack where\nmultiple systems, usually infected with botnet malware, will send multiple packets of network\ndata to one location in an attempt to overload the receiving web server and disable its ability\nto respond to legitimate requests. This is a very well-known and used hacker attack, and\nyet, it’s one of the miscellaneous functions that DarkComet comes with.\n\nThe above screen shows the “Users” tab, which lists all of the currently controlled systems, if\nyou right click on one of these User entries and scroll down to the “Extra Broadcast\nCommands” you will see a menu for DDOS Functions. It includes an HTTP, Syn and UDP\nattack. When clicked it will request the kind of data to be sent and/or the IP/URL and port of\nthe target:\n\n\n-----\n\nI can’t think of an occasion where a network admin would need to try and bring down a web\nserver using the network he/she is controlling as a weapon but I don’t work Network\nAdministration, so what do I know?\n\n**Webcam Control**\n\nWhile it isn’t a new or unique functionality, webcam control is still a very dangerous and\neffective way to spy on people.\n\nThe possible use of these webcam videos/images, which can be obtained from the webcam\ncontrol function, range from cyber espionage, victim blackmailing, the normal perversion of\nspying on people while they don’t know it and the worst one of all child pornography.\nAlthough not the intention of every attacker using this tool, it can be used to spread or sell\nchild pornography and therefore make this function, in my opinion, the worst one out of the\nbunch.\n\n## How does DarkComet Work?\n\nGood question! Most RATs usually have very intricate programming included in the implant\nthemselves, including a large network of command checking algorithms which take the input\nfrom the controller and executes specific functionality based upon that input. The\nfunctionality is usually condensed as much as possible to make the implant binary smaller,\nhowever they are still usually larger than other types of malware which have less\nfunctionality. For example, a general range of size for normal malware is between 5KB and\n\n\n-----\n\n15KB with the occasional outlier to 20KB. The sample implant binary I created for\nDarkComet, even after being packed, is 352KB. If you recall, the Flame RAT was 20MB; so\nin comparison, DarkComet is tiny.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what happens with DarkComet when taking commands from the C2\nor controller:\n\nImplant beacons every 20 seconds back to the C2 to check in and wait for any more\ncommands\nWhen desired by the operator, the C2 will send back a command using some custom\ntraffic encryption scheme.\nThe command is taken in by the implant, decrypted and then analyzed for:\n\nAuthenticity – Meaning an ID or some other value which confirms that the implant\nis receiving a command from the correct source\nCommand – The exact function requested, I.E. List Active Processes or Disable\nTask Bar, etc.\nParameters – What extra options should the implant take into consideration when\nexecuting the requested functionality\n\nThe implant will take this parsed information and execute the functionality\nThe output from execution of the functionality will be sent back to the C2 in the same\nencrypted form\nThe C2 will decrypt the data and present it to the operator\n\nOne of the key elements in network detection is the Beacon or the Beacon Response. Since\nDarkComet it is a repetitive string and the encryption only distorts the values in a set way\n(such as an XOR), the exact data sent to the C2 or back from the C2 will remain constant\nwhile the implant is inactive. These values can be used to develop network detection\nsignatures which would flag a possible infection. The next step from a network security\nstandpoint would be to track down the exact system which is infected by the malware and\nclean it accordingly. Although this kind of detection is usually only done on the networks of\nlarge organizations or governments, not really single users.\n\nYou might be thinking at this point: “Well hey, if that network detection stuff works well, why\nwas it not used for Flame?”\n\nAnswer: I assume that after the detection of the infection (that rhymes) and a preliminary\nanalysis of the Flame malware, it was put into place to keep track of which systems were\ninfected and what kind of data was being sent. However, before the detection of Flame, the\nmalware would of most likely kept its beacons as far apart as possible and maybe even send\nthe data through a series of other infected systems before it went out to its C2. This would\nkeep the traffic down and not throw any suspicious flags.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoving on, we know how DarkComet talks to its C2 and how it processes the data and\nexecutes its functionality, that’s great and all but does DarkComet use the same implant for\nevery controller that is downloaded? The answer is no and that answer fits for most RATs.\nSee certain things need to be configured in an implant, for example the beacon address,\ntarget specifications and the level of infection required. DarkComet is no different and\ncomes with its own implant building tools.\n\nThere are two types of implant creation (or as it calls them, server module) tools, a\nMinimalistic one which is quick to develop or a Full Editor which requires expert knowledge\nof the RAT.\n\n**Minimalist:**\n\nThe minimalist version of the implant creator includes configuration for:\n\nThe Implant ID\nThe beacon back address\nThe port to use – The default is 1604, it was used in the past for Citrix related\noperations, it was probably chosen because of the high amount of traffic it used to\nreceive.\nThe installation destination path and “KeyName”\nAn area to Drag-And-Drop an Icon to be used.\n\nIt is useful for on-the-fly creation of an implant but I think most users will probably use the\nFull Editor instead.\n\n**Full Editor:**\n\nThe Full editor gives the user a lot more options when creating the implant, here is a list of\nthose options:\n\n\n-----\n\nA security Password to further authenticate the implant to the controller\nThe Process Mutex to use\nThe Server ID\nA profile name to save the settings as\nThe ability to hijack processes to get around Firewall restrictions\nThe Address/Port to beacon to\nInstallation location and filename\nKeyname\nOptions to:\n\nDestroy the installation binary after first execution\nChange the file creation date\nCreate persistence on the system\nDropped File and Folder attributes (Hidden/System)\n\nAbility to display a message box with text upon installation\nVarious stealth and persistence functions or Rootkit functions\nAbility to disable various system functions upon installation\nOptions to use an offline keylogger or send keylogger data to a remote FTP server\n(with FTP configuration options)\nInstallation modifications to the Hosts File – to redirect traffic\nAbility to load “Plug-ins”\nAddition files to drop and execute upon installation (Piggybacking)\nWhich Icon to use for the Binary\nCompression or Packer to use:\n\nUPX\nMPRESS\n\nThe file extension to use:\n\n.exe\n.com\n.bat\n.pif\n.scr\n\nThat is a lot of options! It is clearly the best method of creating the implant binary. The scary\npart about the functionality of the implant installation binary is that even without being\nblocked to its C2, this one file can execute enough functionality to completely infect your\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Server Downloader:**\n\nThe final option that an operator has in creating an infection binary would be the Server\nDownloader. I think this is a neat little tool that automatically creates a lightweight (2KB)\napplication that automatically downloads and executes the real implant installation binary\nfrom a given remote URL. It makes it easy to hide it as being non-malicious when going\nthrough the motions of tricking a user into downloading and executing it. The options given\nto the operator are:\n\nThe URL of the file to download\nThe extension to use (The same as the Full Editor)\n\n## How to protect yourself:\n\nThere are multiple methods used in the spread of RATs, as for DarkComet, some of the\nbiggest methods are:\n\nDrive-By Attacks\nWarez Downloads\nSocial Networking Sites\n\nDrive-By attacks mean that when visiting a web page, a malicious script embedded in the\npage will execute and usually exploit some kind of vulnerability on your system, dropping\nmalware and executing it without you ever knowing. Drive-by attacks are usually used by\ncyber-criminals for the purpose of spreading malware. The use of drive-by attacks to spread\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkComet doesn t seem to make a lot of sense since it is easily detected and removed.\nHowever, as noted on the DarkCoderSC web site for DarkComet, purchasing a VIP account\nwill provide the attacker with version updates of DarkComet before it is released to the\npublic. Therefore the new version or variant hasn’t been seen and has a greater chance of\ngetting past AV scanners, so it makes sense to try and infect as many systems as possible\nwith it before it’s too late.\n\nWarez Downloads, or the downloading of illegal/cracked software can sometimes lead to\ndownloading something you wish you hadn’t, like DarkComet malware. Often used as a\nmethod by the less experienced hackers or “script-kiddies”, advertising a cracked piece of\nsoftware and actually providing malware is common practice and since DarkComet is so\neasy to obtain, set up and run, it’s no wonder why it’s being spread this way. I can imagine\nthat a majority of people who participate in such actives (I don’t judge) do not employ the use\nof AV scanners for numerous reasons (paranoia?) and therefore are great targets for not\nonly DarkComet but any malware!\n\nSocial networking sites are a great way to spread malware, send a link out to a group of\npeople all at once and hope some of them click it. Maybe hack someones account and post\nthe link, disguised as another user. Either way, it’s a great way to spread malware and RAT\nmalware especially.\n\nLuckily, not all is lost. If you have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Pro installed, a few things can\nhappen to protect you.\n\nThe web site you were sent to with the exploit would have never loaded thanks to\nMalwarebytes Web Protection Module\nMalwarebytes Anti-Malware definitions scan for unique features at a deeper level than\nother AV vendors and are more likely to detect new variants of the same malware.\nMalwarebytes Anti-Malwares Active Protection module would have detected the\nmalware being executed on your system and prevented it from going any further based\nupon its functionality.\nYou can download Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and install it, even after being infected\nto detect and remove the threat.\n\nOn top of that, RAT infections can be the product of targeted attacks, though not always the\ncase as mentioned above. They do make a lot of noise and more often than not\nantivirus/Anti-Malware software will detect and remove any infection. However, this is just\none of many other types of RATs that are out there and while this one has the capability to do\nmalicious things, it is a really good option for network administration.\n\nSome of the other RATs we will discuss in this series are not so friendly, they are developed\nfor the sole purpose of espionage and that is apparent in the infection methods used. As a\ngeneral precaution, here is a list of standard security practices you can do to keep yourself\nsafe:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlways keep up to date definitions of your antivirus/Anti-Malware software\nAlways update your operating system\nNever click on links in e-mails from people you do not know or trust\nAlways keep the most up to date security patches for your browser and extension\napplications (Adobe products, Java, etc.)\nIf possible, completely disable the Java functionality in your browser, this makes it\nimpossible to be exploited through Java.\n\nWhile these measures seem simple enough, they are the best protection for your system\nwhile not draining your ability to perform standard tasks or your wallet.\n\n\n-----",
