Victims Must Take Additional Steps to Remediate the_**\n**_Vulnerability and Prevent Malicious Actors From Further Exploiting Unpatched_**\n**_Devices._**\n\nThe Justice Department today announced a court-authorized operation, conducted in March\n2022, to disrupt a two-tiered global botnet of thousands of infected network hardware\ndevices under the control of a threat actor known to security researchers as Sandworm,\nwhich the U.S. government has previously attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of\nthe General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU). The operation\ncopied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that\nSandworm used for command and control (C2) of the underlying botnet. Although the\noperation did not involve access to the Sandworm malware on the thousands of underlying\nvictim devices worldwide, referred to as “bots,” the disabling of the C2 mechanism severed\nthose bots from the Sandworm C2 devices’ control.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis court-authorized removal of malware deployed by the Russian GRU demonstrates the\ndepartment’s commitment to disrupt nation-state hacking using all of the legal tools at our\ndisposal,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s\nNational Security Division. “By working closely with WatchGuard and other government\nagencies in this country and the United Kingdom to analyze the malware and to develop\ndetection and remediation tools, we are together showing the strength that public-private\npartnership brings to our country’s cybersecurity. The department remains committed to\nconfronting and disrupting nation-state hacking, in whatever form it takes.”\n\n“Through close collaboration with WatchGuard and our law enforcement partners, we\nidentified, disrupted and exposed yet another example of the Russian GRU’s hacking of\ninnocent victims in the United States and around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Cindy K.\nChung for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “Such activities are not only criminal but also\nthreaten the national security of the United States and its allies. My office remains committed\nto working with our partners in the National Security Division, the FBI, foreign law\nenforcement agencies and the private sector to defend and maintain our nation’s\ncybersecurity.”\n\n“This operation is an example of the FBI’s commitment to combatting cyber threats through\nour unique authorities, capabilities, and coordination with our partners,” said Assistant\nDirector Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “As the lead domestic law enforcement\nand intelligence agency, we will continue pursuing cyber actors that threaten the national\nsecurity and public safety of the American people, our private sector partners and our\ninternational partners.”\n\n“The FBI prides itself on working closely with our law enforcement and private sector\npartners to expose criminals who hide behind their computer and launch attacks that\nthreaten Americans’ safety, security and confidence in our digitally connected world,” said\nSpecial Agent in Charge Mike Nordwall of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office. “The FBI has an\nunwavering commitment to combat and disrupt Russia’s efforts to gain a foothold inside U.S.\nand allied networks.”\n\nOn Feb. 23, the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre, the Department of\nHomeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FBI and the\n[National Security Agency released an advisory identifying the Cyclops Blink malware, which](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220223.pdf)\ntargets network devices manufactured by WatchGuard Technologies Inc. (WatchGuard) and\nASUSTek Computer Inc. (ASUS). These network devices are often located on the perimeter\nof a victim’s computer network, thereby providing Sandworm with the potential ability to\nconduct malicious activities against all computers within those networks. As explained in the\nadvisory, the malware appeared to have emerged as early as June 2019, and was the\napparent successor to another Sandworm botnet called VPNFilter, which the Department of\nJustice [disrupted through a court-authorized operation in 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)\n\n\n-----\n\n[The same day as the advisory, WatchGuard released detection and remediation tools for](https://detection.watchguard.com/)\nusers of WatchGuard devices. The advisory and WatchGuard’s guidance both recommended\nthat device owners deploy WatchGuard’s tools to remove any malware infection and patch\ntheir devices to the latest versions of available firmware. Later, ASUS released its own\nguidance to help compromised ASUS device owners mitigate the threat posed by Cyclops\nBlink malware. The public and private sector efforts were effective, resulting in the successful\nremediation of thousands of compromised devices. However, by mid-March, a majority of the\noriginally compromised devices remained infected.\n\nFollowing the initial court authorization on March 18, the department’s operation was\nsuccessful in copying and removing the malware from all remaining identified C2 devices. It\nalso closed the external management ports that Sandworm was using to access those C2\ndevices, as recommended in WatchGuard’s remediation guidance (a non-persistent change\nthat the owner of an affected device can reverse through a device restart). These steps had\nthe immediate effect of preventing Sandworm from accessing these C2 devices, thereby\ndisrupting Sandworm’s control of the infected bot devices controlled by the remediated C2\ndevices. However, WatchGuard and ASUS devices that acted as bots may remain vulnerable\nto Sandworm if device owners do not take the WatchGuard and ASUS recommended\ndetection and remediation steps. The department strongly encourages network defenders\nand device owners to review the Feb. 23 advisory and WatchGuard and ASUS releases.\n\nThe operation announced today leveraged direct communications with the Sandworm\nmalware on the identified C2 devices and, other than collecting the underlying C2 devices’\nserial numbers through an automated script and copying the C2 malware, it did not search\nfor or collect other information from the relevant victim networks. Further, the operation did\nnot involve any FBI communications with bot devices.\n\nSince prior to the Feb. 23 advisory, the FBI has been attempting to provide notice to owners\nof infected WatchGuard devices in the United States and, through foreign law enforcement\npartners, abroad. For those domestic victims whose contact information was not publicly\navailable, the FBI has contacted providers (such as a victim’s internet service provider) and\nhas asked those providers to provide notice to the victims. As required by the terms of the\ncourt authorization, the FBI has provided notice to the owners of the domestic C2 devices\nfrom which the FBI copied and removed the Cyclops Blink malware.\n\nThe efforts to disrupt the Cyclops Blink botnet were led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh, Atlanta and\nOklahoma City Field Offices, the FBI Cyber Division, the National Security Division’s\nCounterintelligence and Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nWestern District of Pennsylvania. Assistance was also provided by the Criminal Division’s\nComputer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Office of International Affairs, as well\nas the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you believe you have a compromised device, please contact your local FBI Field Office for\nassistance. The FBI continues to conduct a thorough and methodical investigation into this\ncyber incident.\n\n\n-----",
