The activity observed by\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers focuses on obtaining and\n\n\n-----\n\nexpanding access within a targeted network.\n\nCTU™ research indicates that LYCEUM may have been active as early as April 2018.\nDomain registrations suggest that a campaign in mid-2018 focused on South African targets.\nIn May 2019, the threat group launched a campaign against oil and gas organizations in the\nMiddle East. This campaign followed a sharp uptick in development and testing of their\ntoolkit against a public multi-vendor malware scanning service in February 2019.\n\nStylistically, the observed tradecraft resembles activity from groups such as COBALT GYPSY\n(which is related to OilRig, Crambus, and APT34) and COBALT TRINITY (also known as\nElfin and APT33). However, none of the collected malware or infrastructure associated with\nLYCEUM has direct links to observed activity from these or other known threat groups. As of\nthis publication, there is insufficient technical evidence to support an attribution assessment.\n\nWhen CTU researchers first published information about LYCEUM to Secureworks Threat\nIntelligence clients, no public documentation on the group existed. Since then, reporting has\n[emerged that refers to the threat group as HEXANE.](https://dragos.com/resource/hexane/)\n\n## The LYCEUM toolkit\n\nLYCEUM initially accesses an organization using account credentials obtained via password\nspraying or brute-force attacks. Using compromised accounts, the threat actors send\nspearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to deliver the DanBot malware, which\nsubsequently deploys post-intrusion tools.\n\nCTU researchers have observed LYCEUM using the following tools:\n\n**DanBot — A first-stage remote access trojan (RAT) that uses DNS and HTTP-based**\ncommunication mechanisms and provides basic remote access capability, including the\nabilities to execute arbitrary commands via cmd.exe and to upload and download files\n**DanDrop — A VBA macro embedded in an Excel XLS file used to drop DanBot**\n**kl.ps1 — A PowerShell-based keylogger**\n**Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 — Part of the** [PoshC2 framework](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/blob/master/Modules/Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1)\n**Get-LAPSP.ps1 — A PowerView-based script from the PowerShell Empire framework**\n\n### DanBot\n\nDanBot is written in C# using .NET Framework 2.0 and provides basic remote access\ncapabilities. The DNS channel of DanBot's C2 protocol uses both IPv4 A records and IPv6\nAAAA records for communication. The HTTP channel has evolved slightly since the early\n2018 samples but retains common elements throughout.\n\nFigure 1 shows a typo in DanBot’s hard-coded User-Agent: an ampersand after the\noperating system value. Other typos in the code include missing spaces between key\nelements and the misspelling of ‘Encoding’ in the Accept-Encoding header. The developer\n\n\n-----\n\nconsistently used Accept-Enconding (note the extra n ) in all DanBot samples analyzed by\nCTU researchers. This typographical error can facilitate network detection for the HTTPbased elements of the C2 protocol.\n\n_Figure 1. Early 2019 DanBot sample HTTP request. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### DanDrop\n\nThe threat actors use this malicious macro to extract the DanBot payload from the\nweaponized document and then Base64-decode and install the malware using a scheduled\ntask. The basic form and function of the macro have remained constant across analyzed\nsamples, but the threat actors have made incremental improvements to obfuscate the macro\nand refactor some of the functionality.\n\n### kl.ps1\n\nkl.ps1 is a custom keylogger that is written in PowerShell and leverages elements of the\nMicrosoft .NET Core framework. It captures the window title and keystrokes on infected\nsystems and stores them as Base64-encoded data. It is deployed using a scheduled task\nand a VBScript file. Figure 2 shows the command line used to run the keylogger script.\n\n_Figure 2. Reconstructed PowerShell command. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1\n\n[Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 is a component of the PoshC2 penetration testing framework. It is](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/blob/master/Modules/Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1)\nused to decrypt passwords stored in the RDCMan configuration file, which stores details of\nservers and encrypted credentials to quickly establish remote desktop sessions. Recovered\ncredentials could give the threat actors additional access within the environment. LYCEUM\ndeployed this tool via DanBot approximately one hour after gaining initial access to a\ncompromised environment.\n\n### Get-LAPSP.ps1\n\nGet-LAPSP.ps1 is a PowerShell script that gathers account information from Active Directory\n[via LDAP. It appears to contain borrowed code and has been run with an obfuscation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericshoemaker/PowerView/master/Powerview.ps1)\nsuch as [invoke-obfuscation. LYCEUM deployed this tool via DanBot shortly after gaining](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation)\ninitial access to a compromised environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n## First stops in a new organization: HR and IT\n\nA malicious document (maldoc) that was uploaded to an online virus scanning repository in\nMay 2019 contains the phrase “Industrial Systems Control Programming”. A superficial\nanalysis of the document content might conclude that this document was intended for\nindividuals working with industrial control systems (ICS) or operational technology (OT).\nHowever, the true content of this document is a training schedule spanning multiple\ndepartments, with ICS being first on the list. This focus on training aligns with LYCEUM’s\ntargeting of executives, HR staff, and IT personnel.\n\nLYCEUM delivers weaponized maldocs via spearphishing from the compromised accounts to\nthe targeted executives, human resources (HR) staff, and IT personnel. The recipient is more\nlikely to open a message if it originates from an internal address. Compromising individual\nHR accounts could yield information and account access that could be used in additional\nspearphishing operations within the targeted environment and against associated\norganizations. IT personnel have access to high-privilege accounts and documentation that\ncould help the threat actors understand the environment without blindly navigating the\nnetwork to find data and systems of interest.\n\nCTU researchers identified several 2018 campaigns using a “security best practice” theme\n(see Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. Phishing decoys used in 2018 LYCEUM campaign. The malicious Excel files_\n_dropped DanBot variants. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### No evidence of ICS targeting or capabilities\n\nDespite the initial perception that the maldoc sample was intended for ICS or OT staff,\nLYCEUM has not demonstrated an interest in those environments. However, CTU\nresearchers cannot dismiss the possibility that the threat actors could seek access to OT\nenvironments after establishing robust access to the IT environment. Access to, and through,\nthe IT environment is often a prerequisite to targeting an OT environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Command and control infrastructure\n\nLYCEUM registered infrastructure using the PublicDomainRegistry.com, Web4Africa, and\nHosting Concepts B.V. registrars. New domains appear to be registered for individual\ncampaigns, and the threat actors generally use the domain within a few weeks of\nregistration. LYCEUM C2 domains typically have a security or web technology theme. Figure\n4 lists known and suspected LYCEUM infrastructure and associated creation and expiration\ndata.\n\n_Figure 4. List of known and suspected LYCEUM-operated domains. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLYCEUM is an emerging threat to energy organizations in the Middle East, but organizations\nshould not assume that future targeting will be limited to this sector. Critical infrastructure\norganizations in particular should take note of the threat group’s tradecraft. Aside from\ndeploying novel malware, LYCEUM’s activity demonstrates capabilities CTU researchers\nhave observed from other threat groups and reinforces the value of a few key controls.\nPassword spraying, DNS tunneling, social engineering, and abuse of security testing\nframeworks are common tactics, particularly from threat groups operating in the Middle East.\nWhile there are many security controls that could mitigate aspects of a LYCEUM intrusion,\nCTU researchers recommend the following to provide broad protection and detection\ncapabilities that apply to a spectrum of threats:\n\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA) — Every corporate remote access service\navailable on the Internet, including cloud applications such as Office 365/Outlook,\nexternal virtual private networks (VPNs), and single sign-on (SSO) pages, should\nrequire users to provide a one-time password in addition to their regular password.\nHowever, simply sending auto-enrollment emails can allow threat actors to enroll\nthemselves using compromised accounts and continue their operations unhindered.\n\n\n-----\n\nIncrease visibility via endpoint detection, response, and logging — Incident response\nefforts are often hampered by a lack of visibility in the environment. This condition may\nbe due to the absence of logs that allow network defenders to forensically piece\ntogether what happened or insufficient tools to monitor for ongoing threat actor activity.\nEndpoint monitoring tools are essential for detecting suspicious activity in the\nenvironment after other controls have been evaded.\nConduct preparedness exercises — Technology solutions cannot address all\ncybersecurity risks. Employees are both vulnerabilities and assets. Fostering a culture\nthat focuses on security awareness and makes it easy for staff to work efficiently in a\ncrisis reduces the overall frequency, impact, and cost of security incidents.\n\nIncident response — Table-top exercises can benefit organizations at different\nstages. Involving stakeholders from legal, public relations, and other groups\nacross the organization provides insight about what data is and is not important\nand why. This training will enable staff to contact the correct people inside and\noutside the organization when an incident occurs.\nPhishing awareness — Continuously reinforcing phishing awareness training and\ngiving users an easy way to report suspicious messages helps to detect phishing\ncampaigns early. Organizations should have processes for swift response and\ncontainment if a user executes a malicious payload.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note\nthat IP addresses can be reallocated.
