There are\ncurrently a number of known mobile Trojans specializing in secretly subscribing users to paid\nservices. They usually pay for legitimate services in a user’s name and scammers take a cut\nfrom the money billed. These types of subscription fees tend to be fleeced from the phone\nbalance.\n\nA user who is genuinely interested in subscribing to a service normally needs to visit the\ncontent provider’s website and click “subscribe.” As Trojan apps are capable of simulating a\nclick on this icon, service providers sometimes require a confirmation code sent in a text\nmessage to complete subscription. In other cases, marketplaces try to make it harder to\nautomate subscription by using a CAPTCHA, while others analyze traffic and block\nsubscription scams using anti-fraud solutions. Yet there are some types of malware which\ncan bypass at least some of these protections.\n\n## Jocker: Text message thief in Google Play\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojans from the Trojan.AndroidOS.Jocker family can intercept codes sent in text messages\nand bypass anti-fraud solutions. They’re usually spread on Google Play, where scammers\ndownload legitimate apps from the store, add malicious code to them and re-upload them to\nthe store under a different name. The trojanized apps fulfill their original purposes in most\ncases, and the user won’t suspect they are a source of threats.\n\nTo bypass vetting on Google Play, the Trojan monitors whether it’s gone live. The malicious\npayload will remain dormant while the app is stalled at the vetting stage.\n\n**_Checking availability on Google Play_**\n\nWhile trojanized apps are removed from the store on a daily basis, it’s constantly flooded by\nnew ones to take their place. The screenshots below show examples of apps for messaging,\nmonitoring blood pressure, and document scanning using your phone’s camera, all of which\nwere still available on Google Play at the end of February.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_[From left to right: messaging app (d3d8dbb9a4dffc1e7007b771e09b5b38), blood](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d3d8dbb9a4dffc1e7007b771e09b5b38/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)_**\n**_[pressure app (ab168c7fbfa2f436d7deb90eb5649273), and document scanning app](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/ab168c7fbfa2f436d7deb90eb5649273/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)_**\n**_[(77a6c1c2f782c699d1e73a940f36a527)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/77a6c1c2f782c699d1e73a940f36a527/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)_**\n\n### Jocker functions\n\nOnce the infected app is installed on your device, it requests access to text messages if its\nlegitimate functionality requires it — for example, if it poses itself as a messaging app.\nOtherwise, it requests access to notifications. Pop-up notifications about messages received\nalso contain the text of these messages, so access to notifications allows the malware to\nintercept the confirmation codes to complete subscription.\n\nOnce launched, the malware downloads and launches a new file which inherits permissions\n[from the infected app. The earliest versions of the Trojan downloaded the subscription app](https://securelist.com/mobile-malware-evolution-2019/96280/)\nstraight away. But presently Jocker is a staged downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Downloading of Jocker’s stage 1 payload. The scammers call their software SDK_**\n\n**_Launch of the first stage_**\n\nThe scammers avoid detection by using different options for the initial payload download and\nlaunch. The entire process can involve a staged download of four files to deliver the final\npayload to the infected device, where only the last file is responsible for the main aim of\nsubscribing the user.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Launch of stage 2 payload (SDK)_**\n\n**_Launch of the main payload (SDK) for subscription_**\n\nThe main payload basically follows a standard scheme: it receives a URL of the subscription\npage from the C&C server and opens it in an invisible window. Once the page is loaded, the\nTrojan injects it with scripts which request a subscription and confirm it using an intercepted\ncode from the text message.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Code of Jocker’s main payload_**\n\nMain “SDK” also has code for bypassing anti-fraud systems. For example, the malware can\nmodify the X-Requested-With header in an HTTP request, which can be used to identify the\nparticular app requesting a subscription. Jocker can also block or substitute anti-fraud\nscripts.\n\n**_Substitution of anti-fraud script_**\n\n### Geography of Jocker attacks\n\nFrom January 2021 to March 2022, Jocker most frequently attacked users in Saudi Arabia\n(21.20%). Poland came second (8.98%) with Germany in third place (6.01%).\n\n_Geographical distribution of Kaspersky users attacked by the Jocker family, January 2021 —_\n_[March 2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05115747/01-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\nThe other countries in the TOP 10 where most users encountering Jocker were located were\nMalaysia (5.71%), the United Arab Emirates (5.50%), Switzerland (5.10%), South Africa\n(4.12%), Austria (3.96%), Russia (3.53%), and China (2.91%).\n\n## MobOk skirts CAPTCHA\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother subscription Trojan identified as Trojan.AndroidOS.MobOk was also first detected in\n[an infected app on Google Play. However, this malware is now mainly spread as the payload](https://securelist.com/mobile-subscriptions/91211/)\nof another Trojan called Triada, [which is present in preinstalled apps (usually system apps)](https://securelist.com/pig-in-a-poke-smartphone-adware/97607/)\non certain smartphone models. It’s also built into popular apps, such as the APKPure app\nstore and [a widely used modification of WhatsApp Messenger.](https://securelist.com/triada-trojan-in-whatsapp-mod/103679/)\n\nTrojan.AndroidOS.MobOk works on a principle similar to the malware described in the\nprevious section. A subscription page is opened in an invisible window and a confirmation\ncode stolen from a text message is stealthily entered there. If the malware is downloaded by\nTriada, it inherits Triada’s access to text messages, but if MobOk is spread by itself, it will\nrequest access to notifications, similarly to Jocker.\n\nMobOk differs from Jocker in its additional capability of bypassing CAPTCHA. The Trojan\ndeciphers the code shown on the image by sending it to a special service.\n\n**_Sending an image to a recognition service and receiving the recognized code_**\n\n### Geography of MobOk attacks\n\nThe country where users encountered MobOk Trojans most frequently from January 2021 to\nMarch 2022 was Russia (31.01%). Second place is occupied by India (11.17%), closely\nfollowed by Indonesia (11.02%).\n\n_Geographical distribution of users attacked by MobOk family, January 2021 — March 2022_\n_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05115906/02-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\n\n-----\n\nFourth and fifth place were taken by Ukraine (8.31%) and Algeria (5.28%). The other\ncountries in the TOP 10 where the Trojan was most active were Mexico (2.62%), Brazil\n(1.98%), Germany (1.63%), Turkey (1.43%), and Malaysia (1.27%).\n\n## Vesub — beware of fake apps\n\nA malware called Trojan.AndroidOS.Vesub is spread through unofficial sources and imitates\npopular games and apps like GameBeyond, Tubemate, Minecraft, GTA5 and Vidmate.\n\n**_Examples of fake apps_**\n\nMost of the apps completely lack any legitimate functionality. They begin subscribing straight\nafter they’re launched, while the user sees a loading window. However, there are some\nexamples such as a fake GameBeyond app where the detected malware was accompanied\nby a random set of working games.\n\nThe subscription process used by Vesub is similar to the previous examples: the malware\nopens an invisible window, requests a subscription, and enters a code received in a text\nmessage.\n\n### Geography of Vesub attacks\n\nTwo out of every five users who encountered Vesub were in Egypt (40.27%). The family was\nalso active in Thailand (25.88%) and Malaysia (15.85%).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Geographical distribution of users attacked by the Vesub family, January 2021 — March_\n_[2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05120002/03-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\n## GriftHorse.l: read the small text\n\nAll of the apps described above subscribe users to legitimate third-party services, even if the\nuser doesn’t need them. However, there are other forms of malware which subscribe users\nto the app authors’ own “service.”\n\nYou can end up subscribing to one of these services by simply not reading the user\nagreement carefully enough. For example, apps which have recently been spread intensively\non Google Play offer to tailor personal weight-loss plans for a token fee.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce launched, the app asks you to fill out a questionnaire.\n\n\n-----\n\nA page then opens to inform the user that a personal plan is being generated.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThen all you need to do is pay for the service and receive your weight-loss plan, which the\nscammers promise to send to your email address.\n\nIf you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you’ll see that the “service” charges a\nsubscription fee with automatic billing. This means money will be deducted from the user’s\nbank account on a regular basis, needing no repeat confirmation from the user.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe fact that the app subscribes users to automatic billing is confirmed in the reviews section\non Google Play. Moreover, many users complain they were unable to cancel the subscription\ndirectly through the actual app, while others mention they never received a weight-loss plan\nafter paying the subscription fee.\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky solutions detect these apps as Trojan.AndroidOS.GriftHorse.l. Our researchers\n[also detected websites that deploy a similar subscription scheme (article in Russian). These](https://www.kaspersky.ru/blog/not-a-scam-with-recurring-payments/32414/)\nwebsites offered access to a wider pool of materials, such as training courses on office suites\n\n\n-----\n\nor online marketplace trading.\n\n### Geography of GriftHorse.l attacks\n\nWe observed the activity of Trojan GriftHorse.l from 25 January 2022. Kaspersky solutions\ndetected most instances of the Trojan on devices owned by users in Russia (81.37%). The\ncountry which came in second for the most users affected was Saudi Arabia (6.07%), with\nEgypt (1.91%) in third place.\n\n_Geographical distribution of users attacked by GriftHorse.l Trojan, 25 January 2022 — 31_\n_[March 2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05120038/04-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\n## GriftHorse.ae: don’t give out your number!\n\nThe Trojan detected as Trojan.AndroidOS.GriftHorse.ae may belong to the same family as\nGriftHorse.l, but it behaves in a completely different way. The malware poses as apps for\nrecovering deleted files, editing photos and videos, blinking the flash for incoming calls,\nnavigation, document scanning, translation, and so on. Yet all these apps can do in practice\nis request a phone number under the pretense of a login, although clicking “login” will\nactually subscribe the user. This is the simplest form of subscription — it bills the cell phone\naccount and all it needs to complete the process is the victim’s phone number. It remains\nunclear what exactly does the GriftHorse.ae Trojan subscribe the user to.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Fake login screen in an app_**\n\nLike its relative, GriftHorse.ae is also spread through Google Play. Scammers upload a great\nnumber of similar apps to the marketplace in the hope that at least some of them will be\navailable to users for a certain amount of time.\n\n### Geography of GriftHorse.ae attacks\n\nOur radars picked up the GriftHorse.ae Trojan for the first time on 10 March 2022. Among\nthe users who fell victim to attacks in less than a month, 43.57% were located in Russia,\n22.95% in Saudi Arabia, and 6.14% in Oman.\n\n_Geographical distribution of users attacked by GriftHorse.ae Trojan, 10 March 2022 — 31_\n_[March 2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05120126/05-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\nForth and fifth place were taken by users in Poland (4.39%) and Belarus (3.22%).\n\n## General statistics on Trojan subscribers\n\nFrom January 2021 to March 2022, the most active of the subscription Trojans covered in\nthis article was MobOk. It was encountered by 74.09% of the Kaspersky mobile solution\nusers who were attacked by the malware mentioned in this piece. Joker Trojans were\nblocked on 17.16% of user devices, while the least active Trojans were from the families\nVesub (3.57%) and GriftHorse (3.53% of users encountered GriftHorse.l and 2.09%\nencountered GriftHorse.ae). It’s still worth noting that GriftHorse is a new family and it’s only\nbeginning to pick up momentum.\n\n_Share of users who encountered Trojans from specific families out of all users attacked by_\n_[the subscription Trojans described in this article, January 2021— March 2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05120154/06-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\n### Geography of subscription Trojan attacks\n\nThe majority of users who encountered subscription Trojans were located in Russia\n(27.32%), India (8.43%), Indonesia (8.18%), Ukraine (6.25%), and Saudi Arabia (5.01%).\n\n_Geographical distribution of users attacked by subscription Trojans, January 2021 — March_\n_[2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/05120221/07-en-trojan-subscribers.png)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nSubscription Trojans can bypass bot detection on websites for paid services, and sometimes\nthey subscribe users to scammers’ own non-existent services.\n\nTo avoid unwanted subscriptions, avoid installing apps from unofficial sources, which is the\nmost frequent source of malware. You shouldn’t let your guard down when installing apps\nfrom Google Play either: read the reviews, read up on the developer, the terms of use and\npayment. For messaging choose a well-known app with positive reviews.\n\nEven if you trust an app, you should avoid granting it too many permissions. Only allow\naccess to notifications for apps that need it to perform their intended purposes — for\nexample, to transfer notifications to wearable devices. Apps for something like themed\nwallpapers or photo editing don’t need access to your notifications.\n\n## Indicators of compromise
