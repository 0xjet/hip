Another is to set up websites that impersonate news\norganisations and convince targets to download “articles”.\n\nThe third method is to ensnare their victims through conversations. As the conversations\ncontinue, the “women” offer up a “video” – laden with malware to infect the target’s\nsystem.\n\nIn a more modern twist, however, we found evidence of the group using voice changing\nsoftware to enhance their operation. Below we analayse their toolset, which also includes\ntools to perform reconnaissance of targets and bulk-deliver malware to them.\n\n**The Server**\n\nEarlier in 2020 we reviewed a server previously identified as serving malware in targeted\nattacks. Those behind the attacks had made a misconfiguration on the server which made\ntheir attack toolset publicly available.\n\nThe attack toolset included:\n\n[Malware used for espionage against political opponents](https://twitter.com/ccxsaber/status/1191916749630783489)\nTools to identify vulnerable routers;\nA voice changing application;\nCustom tooling to use compromised email accounts to send phishing emails; and\nPhishing code for webmail logins\n\n**Background**\n\nThe wider set of activity involved in the campaign we analyse below was previously\n[described by Chinese Anti-Virus companies 360 Antivirus and Rising. Following on from](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/anatomy-of-moonLight-attack-on-the-middle-east/)\nother recent reporting, we refer to the attackers as APT-C-23.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Whilst there are a number of overlapping groups and members in the region, APT-C-23](https://www.securityweek.com/new-backdoors-used-hamas-linked-hackers-abuse-facebook-dropbox)\n[are part of a larger group known as “Molerats” and are mostly located in Palestine. They](https://otx.alienvault.com/adversary/Molerats)\n[have been reported on by the cyber-security industry as far back as 2012. Generally](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes/blob/master/2012/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf)\n[Molerats target political parties in Palestine and the Israeli government – but they also](https://twitter.com/ClearskySec/status/984700415055925248)\n[occasionally target Western Governments. They are perhaps best known for their alleged](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-xtreme-rat-attacks-on-usisrael-and-other-foreign-governments/)\n[office being targeted by the IDF in 2019:](https://www.securityweek.com/israel-bombs-hamas-cyber-hq-response-cyberattack)\n\n**Malware**\n[Others have already reported on the malware that communicates with the server in detail](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/anatomy-of-moonLight-attack-on-the-middle-east/)\nso we will be brief. There are a number of different families of malware but most start\n[with a self extracting rar archive. The archives execute MSHTA/VBScript Downloaders](https://app.any.run/tasks/a30ef1f4-1172-4d9f-84f3-4ad9f49bb78a/)\n[used to install the commodity H-Worm backdoor. The filenames and decoy documents](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/now-you-see-me-h-worm-by-houdini.html)\nare mostly themed around Palestinian politics. We have included a sample of them in the\nAppendix.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file الشمال ميلقإ – االنتخابات ةنجل اجتماع .exe (Election Commission Meeting – Northern Territory .exe)\n\nat http://192.119.111[.]4/xx/dv\n\n**Phishing Toolset**\n\nAPT-C-23 are a medium-sophistication group of attackers. They generally rely upon\nsocial engineering to convince targets to install their malware.\n\n[They have previously been known to impersonate women and target victims on social](https://www.idf.il/en/articles/hamas/hamas-uses-fake-facebook-profiles-to-target-israeli-soldiers/)\nmedia to lure them into installing malware.\n\nAn [article from February 2020 describes how they convinced soldiers in the Israel](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/url-israel-idf-hamas-fake-app-phones-photo-sharing-a9337856.html)\nDefence Forces to install malware. That included using pre-recorded messages in Hebrew\nsaying “Yes” and “No” – presumably as their Hebrew skills were limited.\n\n_“Over the last few months militants, who run the Gaza Strip, have attempted to woo_\n_soldiers on social media platforms including Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook and_\n_Instagram._\n\n_Using fake personas of attractive Israeli women, the militants behind the profiles_\n_claimed they were immigrants with hearing difficulties to explain why they could not_\n_speak on the phone, and why they were not fluent in Hebrew._\n\n\n-----\n\n_They also used Israeli slang in their communiques, doctored photos to prevent a reverse_\n_image search online and sent generic voice messages of women’s voices saying “yes” and_\n_“no” to further bolster credibility._\n\n_As soon as the apps were downloaded it gave Hamas complete control over the phone:_\n_including transferring files to the Hamas server, allowing access to the phone’s data,_\n_SMS messages, contacts, microphone and camera to remotely take pictures, Lt Col_\n_Conricus said.”_\n\nAs well as not speaking Hebrew, it’s likely the attackers faced another problem\nimpersonating women. A number of the people thought to be behind these attacks have\npreviously been identified. All are men.\n\nThat may help to explain what we found in the folder “/up/uploads” on the public server:\n\n**[Figure 3: The public directory on the server 192.119.111[.]4](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/ip/192.119.111.4)**\n\nThe file “88.zip” contains photos from the instagram account of a female model (we have\nblurred the photos):\n\n\n-----\n\n[The file “00.zip” contains the installation for Morph Vox Pro, a voice changing](https://screamingbee.com/)\napplication, including a serial key and voices pack:\n\n**Figure 4: Voice Changing application MorphVox Pro**\n\nThe Serial Key is assigned to an “Ahmed [redacted]”:\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the context of both previous APT-C-23 attacks and the other contents of the folder,\nwe think the most likely explanation for MorphVox being part of their toolset is that it\nwas used to produce audio messages in a female voice to encourage targets to install their\nmalware.\n\n[Other analysts have reported on manipulated images being used to enable](https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/Unknown/APT-C-37/26-08-19/APT-C-37%20analysis.md)\nmisinformation in the wider Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. And there have been previous\n[reports of fraudsters using DeepFake audio impersonations. But this is the first time](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkyqvb/deepfake-audio-impersonating-ceo-fraud-attempt)\nwe’re aware of evidence, albeit indirect, of attackers using voice changing software to\nenable espionage.\n\n**Spearphish Delivery Tool**\n\nThe server also provides information on how the attackers deliver their malware. The file\n[recon.exe is used to bulk-send malicious phishing emails to targets:](http://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/9153b0060a6edc1180988ffd95ef9768caa84734d85da23c1b38d95319a2e240)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe application provides advice on how to send the emails, such as the maximum number\nof messages that can be sent from each mail provider.\n\nThe source code for recon.exe shows that tracking images are also included in sent\nemails:\n\n**Router Exploitation**\n\nAnother folder, called “zz”, included another interesting mix of tools:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file ثحبلا ةقيرط.txt or “Research Method.txt” contains example commands to find\n[vulnerable routers using the ZoomEye internet scanning service:](https://routersecurity.org/bugs.php)\n\nThe file PingIPs.exe is part of an attack toolset that we’ve seen previously. It was uploaded\n[to VirusTotal from a IP address in Palestine. It includes a custom GUI and password list](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/39accfe943783cc6075e30c0c77f7aa7aec30d1c4e503d720b7988d563022f1a)\n[for SipVicious – a tool to hack Voice over IP systems.](https://github.com/EnableSecurity/sipvicious)\n\n**Other Tools**\n\nThe folder “support” contained a credential phishing page for Microsoft accounts. It sends\nstolen credentials to https://www.hotmiali[.]com/master/login/login\n\n**Detection and Response**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware described in this report is generally well detected by anti-virus, and we have\nprovided indicators of compromise in the Appendix.\n\nUS-CERT [provides advice on how to avoid falling victim to social engineering attacks.
