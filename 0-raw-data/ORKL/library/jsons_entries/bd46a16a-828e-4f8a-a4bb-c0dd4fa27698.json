Malware\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-windows-users-targeted-with-new-acbackdoor-malware/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-windows-users-targeted-with-new-acbackdoor-malware/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nNovember 18, 2019\n02:23 PM\n6\n\nResearchers have discovered a new multi-platform backdoor that infects Windows and\nLinux systems allowing the attackers to run malicious code and binaries on the\ncompromised machines.\n\nThe malware dubbed ACBackdoor is developed by a threat group with experience in\ndeveloping malicious tools for the Linux platform based on the higher complexity of the\nLinux variant as Intezer security researcher Ignacio Sanmillan found.\n\n\"ACBackdoor provides arbitrary execution of shell commands, arbitrary binary execution,\npersistence, and update capabilities,\" the Intezer researcher found.\n\n## Infection vectors and ported malware\n\nBoth variants share the same command and control (C2) server but the infection vectors\nthey use to infect their victims are different: the Windows version is being pushed through\nmalvertising with the help of the Fallout Exploit Kit while the Linux payload is dropped via a\nyet unknown delivery system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe latest version of this exploit kit, [analyzed by researcher nao_sec in September, targets](https://nao-sec.org/2019/07/steady-evolution-of-fallout-v4.html)\nthe [CVE-2018-15982 (Flash Player) and the CVE-2018-8174 (Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb18-42.html)\nVBScript Engine) vulnerabilities to infect visitors of attacker-controlled sites with malware.\n\nLuckily, \"the Windows variant of this malware does not represent a complex threat in terms\n[of Windows malware,\" Sanmillan says.](https://www.intezer.com/blog-acbackdoor-analysis-of-a-new-multiplatform-backdoor/)\n\nACBackdoor's Windows version also seems to have been ported from the Linux one seeing\nthat the researcher discovered that they share several Linux-specific strings like paths\nbelonging to a Linux file system or kernel thread process names.\n\n**ACBackdoor Linux variant detection rate**\nBesides infecting victims via an unknown vector, the Linux malicious binary is detected by\nonly one of the anti-malware scanning engines on VirusTotal at the time this article was\npublished, while the Windows one is detected by 37 out of 70 engines.\n\nThe Linux binary is also more complex and has extra malicious capabilities, although it\nshares a similar control flow and logic with the Windows version.\n\n\"The Linux implant has noticeably been written better than the Windows\nimplant, highlighting the implementation of the persistence mechanism along with the\ndifferent backdoor commands and additional features not seen in the Windows version such\nas independent process creation and process renaming,\" the report states.\n\n## Backdoor malicious capabilities\n\nAfter it infects a victim's computer, the malware will start collecting system information\nincluding its architecture and MAC address, using platform-specific tools to do it, with\nWindows API functions on Windows and uname UNIX program commonly used to print\nsystem info.\n\nOnce it's done with the info harvesting tasks, ACBackdoor will add a registry entry on\nWindows, and create several symbolic links as well as an initrd script on Linux to gain\npersistence and get automatically launched on system startup.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor will also attempt to camouflage itself as MsMpEng.exe process, the of\nMicrosoft's Windows Defender antimalware and antispyware utility, while on Linux it will\ndisguise as the Ubuntu UpdateNotifier utility and will rename its process to [kworker/u8:7_ev], a Linux kernel thread._\n\n**Windows and Linux**\n\n**variants control flows (Intezer)**\nTo communicate with its C2 server, both malware variants use Hypertext Transfer Protocol\nSecure (HTTPS) as a communication channel, with all the collected information being sent\nas a BASE64 encoded payload.\n\nACBackdoor can receive the info, run, execute, and update commands from the C2 server,\nallowing its operators to run shell commands, to execute a binary, and to update the\nmalware on the infected system.\n\n\"Because there is no attributable information documented on this backdoor, there is a\npossibility that some known Linux-based threat group is updating its toolset,\" Sanmillan\nconcludes.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and

Am I right about that? To further\nclarify...that is what is targeted on a Linux machine...right?\n\n\n-----\n\n[serghei - 2 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1109292/serghei/)\n\nNope, that is the Windows variant.\n\n\"the Linux payload is dropped via a yet unknown delivery system\"\n\n[buddy215 - 2 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/64042/buddy215/)\n\nThanks\n\n[ElliotAlderson - 2 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1146532/elliotalderson/)\n\n“the Linux payload is dropped via a yet unknown delivery system.”\n\nA total non-story then !!!\n\n\n-----\n\n[Al_Capella - 2 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1116269/al-capella/)\n\n\"“the Linux payload is dropped via a yet unknown delivery system.” A total non-story\nthen !!!\"\n\nLinux getting infected by backdoor malware is a total non-story? Maybe you're\nconfused by the term \"dropped.\" \"Dropped\" means loaded into the victim system.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Mike_Walsh - 2 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1003494/mike-walsh/)\n\nWell, totally as expected, I see the Linux/Unix variant is being targeted at Ubuntu.\nPredictable, bog-standard practice; target the largest user-base.\n\nIt won't know WHAT the hell to make of Puppy Linux, then. Pup loads from 'read-only'\nfiles, on a 'locked' CD that physically CANNOT be tampered with. When running in\npermanent 'Live' mode, with nothing saved from the session; at shutdown, the entire\nsession contents simply go poooff!!.....and disappear into cyber-space.\n\nAnd Puppy's initrd is like nothing you've ever even imagined. 16+aufs file-system\nlayers, controlled a script that's like so much gibberish even to veteran Linux users....\nNope; nothing 'standard' there, by a long chalk.\n\nFigure out a way round THAT one, threat actors..... These idiots will soon come to\nrealize that the 'geek' community won't be quite as susceptible to their drivel as they\nwould like them to be, given that most of us know our systems inside out.....and stuff\nlike this will stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nIt's times like this I'm glad NOT to be one of 'the crowd', using bog-standard,\n'mainstream' distros...!!\n\nPost a Comment [Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
