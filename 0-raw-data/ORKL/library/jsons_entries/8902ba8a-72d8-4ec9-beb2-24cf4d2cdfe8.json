The infection generated traffic for IcedID (Bokbot), DarkVNC, and Cobalt Strike. A pcap\n[of the network traffic and the associated malware samples are available here.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2021/12/13/index.html)\n\n\"Contact Forms\" is a campaign that uses a web site's contact form to email malicious links disguised as some\n[sort of legal complaint. We've seen this campaign push BazarLoader malware and](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Stolen+Images+Evidence+Campaign+Continues+Pushing+BazarLoader+Malware/27816/) [distribute Sliver, but](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Stolen+Images+Evidence+campaign+pushes+Sliverbased+malware/27954/)\nrecently it's been pushing IcedID (Bokbot). Most of the time, the Contact Forms campaign uses a \"Stolen\nImages Evidence\" theme, with emails stating a supposed violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n(DMCA). Below is an example seen on December 9th, 2021.\n\n\nBrad\n\n433\nPosts\n\nISC\nHandler\nDec\n16th\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Contact form email spoofing someone from slack.com._\n\nA website's contact form is easy method for cyber criminals to reach an organization. They can enter any\nname, email, and message text in these forms to deliver. With anonymous browsing methods like tor or VPN,\ncriminals can hide their true location when filling out these forms.\n\nIn this case, the link is a googleapis URL that abuses Google services to distribute malware. I checked the\nlink in a web browser, and it was a \"Stolen Images Evidence\" themed web page. The page automatically\npresented an ISO file named Stolen_Images_Evidence.iso.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: \"Stolen Images Evidence\" page sending an ISO file._\n\nISO files have been used by cyber criminals for years, and the Contact Forms campaign started consistently\ndelivering ISO files from these pages as early as November 30th, 2021. Prior to that, this campaign almost\nalways sent zip archives.\n\n_Shown above: Stolen_Images_Evidence.iso downloaded on 2021-12-13._\n\nDouble-clicking an ISO file on a Windows host will mount the file as a drive, then it will open Windows\nExplorer to view its contents. In this example, the double-clicked ISO file appears at F: as a DVD drive, and it\ncontains a Windows shortcut.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Windows Explorer shows the ISO file mounted as a DVD drive at F:\\._\n\nBy default, Windows Explorer does not show hidden files, so we should reveal hidden files from the Explorer\nmenu.\n\n_Shown above: Revealing hidden items in Windows Explorer._\n\n\n-----\n\nRevealing hidden files, we find a DLL and a JavaScript (.js) file hiding in the ISO. The Windows shortcut runs\nboth files. It runs the DLL using regsvr32.exe, and it also runs the .js file separately.\n\n_Shown above: Hidden DLL and JS file, and the Windows shortcut designed to run them both._\n\nExamining the Windows shortcut in a hex editor, we find a Windows user account named lamar that may have\nbeen used when creating the shortcut.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Windows user account name lamar seen in the Windows shortcut._\n\nThe account name lamar has been consistent in each shortcut I've examined from these ISO files since they\nstarted appearing from the Contact Forms campaign on 2021-11-30.\n\n**_Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)_**\n\nThe following are IOCs are from an infection run I started on Monday 2021-12-13 at 21:45 UTC that ran until\nTuesday 2021-12-14 at 17:17 UTC.\n\nURL for the \"Stolen Images Evidence\" page:\n\nhxxps://storage.googleapis[.]com/d03uhg49h1m5na.appspot.com/0/files/st/public/d/0390vfh478gj4.html?\nd=958418188474764759\n\nDomain called by above googleapis page:\n\n172.67.195[.]237 port 443 -
