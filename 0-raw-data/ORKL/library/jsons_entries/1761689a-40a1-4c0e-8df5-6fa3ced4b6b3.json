Most of these attacks are targeted against\ndifferent small and medium businesses in the Banking and Financial sectors. Similar\ncampaigns related to this malware have also been previously reported from other\ncountries. But, these attacks which are targeting Indian companies are being\n[operated from separate C2 servers. We have previously published a blog in October](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/multi-staged-jsoutprox-rat-targets-indian-cooperative-banks-and-finance-companies/)\n2021 that emphasized malware and its different stages.\n\nIn this paper, we will go a little deeper into the different versions of the malware and\nhow it targets Indian companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial Access:**\n\n\n(Fig.1 - Phishing Email)\n\nThe Initial Infection starts with an email which brings in a malicious compressed\narchive containing a JavaScript file. This file is the actual JsOutProx payload.\nWe have analyzed multiple .eml files from this campaign. Most of them had either:\n\n- Header with a spoofed email of the sender or\n\nJavaScript\n\n- Were compromised to make it look more legitimate and convincing to the\nvictim.\n\nThis is a general tactic used by attackers in spam campaigns.\n\n(Fig 2. ZoomEye record about IMAP Server)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2020, an Attacker used IMAP belonging to “192.188.88.116” to send bulk spam\nemails to its targets.\n\nJSOutProx is a highly obfuscated, complex JavaScript based RAT. We have been\nmonitoring this attack campaign since December 2019 and finding its activity even\ntoday.\n\n - This JavaScript code is approximately 1 MB in size.\n\n - Looking into the code, there is a variable with a long array of around 28k values in it.\n\n - This occupies almost a quarter of the file size.\n\n - This array consists of base64 kind of data, but on decryption, we get junk.\n\nJavaScript\n\n(Fig 3.)\n\nThe data is de-obfuscated by passing in the form of function (z, w) [e.g.: HJ('0x61fe',\nZ8L5') ] where z refers to the index of the value in “H array” and w refers to RC4\ndecryption key.\n\nThe actual decoding function is hidden in variable r. The data is base64 decoded\nand RC4 decrypted at the time of execution.\n\n(Fig 4.)\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 5.)\n\nThis RAT can be run as a JavaScript file on the command line, or as a .HTA file inside\na window (mshta.exe). If it is running from inside a window, the RAT hides the\nwindow by resizing it to 0*0 pixels (height*width). Apart from that, it also moves it\naway from the viewable part of the screen.\n\nJavaScript\n\n(Fig 6.)\n\nMoving forward, there is a HT object being initialized\n\n(Fig 7.)\n\nSetting the breakpoint and adding a watch to HT we can clearly see how it got\nde-obfuscated.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 8.)\n\nJavaScript\n\n(Fig 9.)\n\nMethods (Offensive capabilities) can also be seen:\n\n(Fig 10.)\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 11.)\n\nLet’s now focus on what is all this. Ht object basically has a configuration for the\nmalware. A few interesting fields in the configuration include (fig below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"BaseUrl\" field points to the C2 domain and port number via the HTTP\nprotocol. “Hxxp[:]//gensamogh.myq-see.com:9059/” (source)\n\nWhile downloading plugins and assemblies from C2, the \"Password\" field is\nused. “\"vruxcvdfmopd123\"”\n\n”Tag” field contains a campaign ID. \"macxr\". Initially, it was JSOutprox.JavaScript\n\n“Startdate” is about the starting date of infection. “Mon Dec 13 16:22:14\n**UTC+0530 2021”**\n\nDelimiter is used as a separator by the malware while exfiltrating data. \"_|_\"\n\n“ViewOnly” allows the attacker to monitor the victim to gather victim info\nand not write or execute anything on the machine.\n\nFs: Uses Scripting File system Object to gain read/write privileges\n\nWsh: Uses Wscript. Shell Object to execute Wscript files\n\nSh: It uses Shell.Application object to execute command line applications\n\nInstallDir : Contains the location for installation of malware\n\nSleeptime: Delaying the execution of malware\n\nIDPrefix: This is used as a prefix when data is sent over C2\n\nProxyActions: Indicates if malware is a proxy for any other process\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 12.)\n\n\n**How is the configuration varying in different versions?**\n\n\nThe configuration is almost the same in all versions, with few changes.\n\n1. Base URL changes in different versions. Given below are the C2 found among\nall the versions.\n\n\n\n- marcelbosgath.zapto.org:9790\n\n- ruppamoda.zapto.org:9099\n\n- apatee40rm.gotdns.ch:9897\n\n- mathepqo.serveftp.com:9059\n\n- protogoo.ddnsking.com:9081\n\n- riyaipopa.ddns.net:9098\n\n\n\n- dirrcharlirastrup.gotdns.ch:8037\n\n- uloibdrupain.hopto.org:8909\n\n- gensamogh.myq-see.com:9059\n\n- cccicpatooluma.hopto.org:5090\n\n- feednet.myftp.biz:6093\n\n\nJavaScript\n\n2. Tag which denotes the Campaign ID also changes. Few common ones found\nwere: pod, kmewsx, macxr etc\n3. IDPrefix also varies. Few of them are: okdh=, ivcbshs=, _ybj= etc\n4. In the latest versions, the following fields have been observed:\n\n\n\n- IsDonetInstalled\n\n- IsAMSI\n\n\n\n- Net\n\n- IsEncrypted\n\n\n-----\n\n### Plugins\n\n\n**Plugins:**\n\n\nThis malware has various plugins to perform various operations such as\nexfiltration of data, performing file system operations etc. Apart from that, it also\nhas various methods with offensive capabilities that perform various operations.\n\n\n**Methods:**\n\n\nA few interesting methods (can be seen in Fig 10 and Fig 11) are:\n\n1. getUuid : Gets the UUID of the machine\nremove Startup: Remove startup entries(persistence mechanism) if any\n\n2. userName :Get the username of the victim's machines\nProcess(list): To list down all the processes which are running\n3. receive: interpret commands received from C2. These commands are written in\nthe form of a switch case. Given below are a few commands:\n\n\n\n- fnm: Sends the scriptfullname to C2.\n\n- dvo: set to View only\n\n- pat: Update the implant\n\n- uss.s: Set proxy actions and update sleep time\n\n- upd: Update and restart the implant\n\n- rst: Restart\n\n- rmz: Set the zoneidentifier\n\n- l32: open launch ScriptFullName\n\n- l64: open launch scriptFullName\n\n- dcn: exit\n\n- rbt: reboot the victim’s machine\n\n- shd: shutdown the victim's machine\n\n\n\n- lgf: disconnect\n\n- ejs: evaluate a javascript code\n\n- evb: evaluate a VBscript code\n\n- uis: unInstall\n\n- ins: install\n\n- rins: reset the persistence mechanism\n\n- ruis: remove the persistence\n\n- sins: open addStartup\n\n- **suis: open removeStartup**\n\n- int.g: send C2 sleepTime\n\n- int.s: set sleepTime,\n\n- sdn: Load a .NET dll(in new versions)\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 13.)\n\nThen there is an if-else loop related to plugins. These plugins are used to maintain\nthe implant easily:\n\n\n\n- fi: FilePlugin\n\n- do: DownloadPlugin\n\n- sp: ScreenPShellPlugin\n\n- cn: ShellPlugin\n\n- in: InvokePlugin\n\n\n\n- sh: ShortcutPlugin\n\n- as: AssociationPlugin\n\n- jv: JavaInstallPlugin\n\n- pr: ProcessPlugin.\n\n\n(Fig 14.)\n\n\n-----\n\n**How does this implant work?**\n\n\nAfter creating RAT configuration, the first function run by the implant is “init”.\n\n(Fig 15.)\n\nThis will create an identification string for the victim machine where it gathers\nsystem information and stores them into the HT[‘ID’] variable. This ID is filled up\nwith:\n\n\n\n- VolumeSerial\n\n- UUID\n\n- Computername\n\n- Username\n\n\n\n- OSVersion\n\n- OSCaption\n\n- tag\n\n- ScriptName\n\n\nAnd it is separated by Delimiter.\n\nThis implant then moves in an endless loop in which it calls the above “receive”\nfunction every 5 seconds. This function basically allows the attacker to\n\ncommunicate and coordinate with the malware.\n\nThe malware connects to the C2 and fetches a string indicating the command to\nbe executed into the “l[0x0]” variable. This l[0x0] variable can contain either\ncommands or plugins, which are discussed above.\n\n\n**Let’s now look at plugins of older versions:**\n\n\n1. InfoPlugin: Infoplugin is used along with a function receiver that is used to\ninterpret commands from C2. Basically this plugin is used to collect and send\nvictim machine info to C2.\n\n(Fig 16.)\n\n\n-----\n\n2. File plugin: Perform all file system operations.\n\n\n\n- fi.del: Open File removeEx\n\n- fi.cp: Open File copyEx\n\n- fi.mv: Open File moveEx\n\n\n\n- fi.nd: Open File createFolderEx\n\n- fi.ren: Open File rename\n\n- fi.e: Execute a file through Wsh etc..\n\n\n(Fig 17.)\n\n3. ProcessPlugin: This plugin collects processing information. It also creates or\nterminates a process by calling the process-related functions.\n\n(Fig 18.)\n\n4. ScreenPShellPlugin: Perform mouse and keyboard operations using\nPowerShell scripts.\n\n(Fig 19.)\n\n\n-----\n\n5. ShellPlugin: The “ShellExecute” option uses the ShellExecute method present\nin the object of Shell Application. ShellExecute should be called if the user has\nadmin privileges. When the command fails, it attempts to disable AntiSPYware\nof Windows Defender from the Registry. If the user is not an Admin,\nShellExecute is attempted with elevated permissions using the 'runas' flag\n[(source). The “get output” option uses the Run method present in the object of](https://blogs.quickheal.com/multi-staged-jsoutprox-rat-targets-indian-cooperative-banks-and-finance-companies/)\nWScript.Shell. The output is stored in a local file. Furthermore, it collects the\nuser's keyboard language/code page in order to format the output properly.\n\nUpon execution, the malware communicates with C2, which responds with a\nPowerShell script that captures the screenshot and saves it to a temp\ndirectory. There have been previous reports of the same PowerShell script\nbeing used in attacks against banks in the UK. Here is the PowerShell script:\n\n(Fig 20.)\n\n\n**Plugins in new versions:**\n\n\nWith additional functionality, these files are around three MB in size. There is an\ninclusion of DotUtil functions that enables it to download and execute .NET\nassemblies in memory. The method “hasDotnet” discussed earlier also hints\nabout .NET relation with JS.\n\n(Fig 21.)\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven below are DotUtil functions.\n\n(Fig 22.)\n\nIn the above DotUtil functions, given below is the most important one (Create\nInstance):\n\n(Fig 23.)\n\nlibDotJs.dll is downloaded, which has the actual code related to the DotUtil\nFunctions.\n\nWe have fetched the libDotJS.dll module by intercepting the memory of\nwscript.exe using x64.dbg. Looking into CFF Explorer\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 24.)\n\nAll the functions can be seen in its strings.\n\n(Fig 25.)\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing dnspy for a clear picture, we can clearly see that there is a complete\nmapping of Dotnet modules of the below dll and the ones declared in DotUtil\ncomponent of the malicious JavaScript\n\n(Fig 26.)\n\n\n**Let’s now look into Plugins:**\n\n\n1. Activity Plugin: This plugin enables the RAT to be in Online or Offline state. An\nadodb.stream object is created when the state is online to save the download\ned/collected data. This plugin (infact all the plugins) is used along with function\nreceive that is used to interpret commands from C2. Based on the commands\nthe states are changed by calling corresponding “Activity” Functions through a\nswitch-case.\n\n(Fig 27.)\n\n\n-----\n\n2. CensorMiniPlugin: Enables/disables proxy settings on user machine by\nmodifying registry key “Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings\\ProxyEnable” switch-case.\n\n(Fig 28.)\n\n3. AdminConsolePlugin: This plugin changes the authentication level using\n“winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\cimv2”. It uses\ncommand “select * from win32_logicaldisk” and queries drive size,freespace etc.\n\n(Fig 29.)\n\n4. ClipboardPlugin: : It is used to copy the clipboard data and send it over C2. It\ncan also modify clipboard data.\n\n(Fig 30.)\n\n5. DnsPlugin: I: It is used to send current DNS info to c2 . It can also be used to set\na DNS path. Add or modify new path in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n[(source)](https://blogs.quickheal.com/multi-staged-jsoutprox-rat-targets-indian-cooperative-banks-and-finance-companies/)\n\n(Fig 31.)\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Multiviewplugin: Has Quality and scaling info.\n\n(Fig 32.)\n\n7. LibraryPlugin: Sends a list of the Dotnet versions installed on the system to C2.\n\n8. OutlookPlugin: It accesses the Outlook account details, and contacts list and\nsends it over C2\n\n(Fig 33.)\n\n9. PriviledgePlugin: In this, the option “UAC” allows to write in registry location\n[“SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\” (source) by](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/multi-staged-jsoutprox-rat-targets-indian-cooperative-banks-and-finance-companies/)\nsetting value 0 for keys EnableLUA and ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin. The\noption “elevateScript” executes the script using wscript.exe with the batch\nmode option. The option “elevateCommand” executes commands using Wsh\n\nwith the ‘runas’ flag. It also has options for using UAC bypass techniques like\nfodhelper.exe, Slui File Handler Hijacking, CompMgmtLauncher,\nEventViewer.exe etc.\n\n(Fig 34.)\n\n\n-----\n\n10. PromptPlugin: This plugin allows the attacker to show his victim a custom\nmessage prompt sent by C2.\n\n(Fig 35.)\n\n11. ProxyPlugin: Sets DNS path. Add or modify a new path in\n[C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts. (source)](https://blogs.quickheal.com/multi-staged-jsoutprox-rat-targets-indian-cooperative-banks-and-finance-companies/)\n\n12. ShortcutPlugin: Generate shortcut files for given executables. Run the\nshortcut file. You can either get the target of a shortcut file or dump its content.\n\n(Fig 36.)\n\n13. RecoveryPlugin: Used for the recovery of user password configurations\n\n14. TokensPlugin: Steal OTP received from SymantecVIP application.\n\n(Fig 37.)\n\nApart these there are few interesting methods also:\n\nP object: Used to fetch information related to volume serial, resolution,physical\nmemory info etc\n\n\n-----\n\n(Fig 38.)\n\n15. Network drives: Dumps info related to network drives.\n\n(Fig 39.)\n\n16. Message bag: Used to give flash messages to the victim\n\n(Fig 40.)\n\n\n**Environment and HTTP objects:**\n\n\n(Fig 41.)\n\nAfter dropping old versions, a new version is dropped (updated) in a few cases,\nwhich leads to Netwire RAT. Last year we published our research about\nJava-based Adwind RAT\n(https://www.seqrite.com/blog/java-rat-campaign-targets-co-operative-banks-in-i\nndia/) in which a jar file was the main component\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, it targeted co-operative banks in India using Covid-themed\nattachment names of a similar double-extension format. JSOutProx and Adwind\nRATs have identical commands, configuration fields, and user-agent strings. It is\nlikely that the JSOutProx RAT is linked to the same threat actor since they appear\nto use similar jar files as end payloads instead of initial infection vectors to evade\ndetection\n\n\n**Network:**\n\n\n(Fig 42.)\n\nWe captured some attacker engagement with victims. The command\n“MTBffF8tMV98XzUwMA==” decodes to “ 10_|_-1_|_500 “ which was issued to\ncapture screenshots and send them back to C2.\n\nNotice that crafted HTTP header in the request, which helps payload blend into\npackets as Content-Type of images. However, this was an old variant of\nJsOutProx.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n#### Apparently, this attack was carried out by a Threat Actor with a financial motive.\n\n\nThey are attacking small banks,\n\nwhere security practices are less\n\nwell-defined than those of larger\n\ninstitutions, thereby increasing\n\nthe chance of a successful\n\ninfection and a payout.\n\n\nWhile the majority of the\nanalyzed attacks have targeted\nIndian banks, we have found\nsigns of this attack in other\ngeographies as well. As we have\nonly limited data, it is difficult to\ndetermine if the attackers are\ntargeting any particular country.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Based on our Threat Intelligence:**\n\n\n**mplant JsOutProx have**\n**capabilities similar to**\n\n**Hackers launder** **FIN-7 APT's Carbanak.**\n**money outside** **Carbanak shared the**\n\n**same goals and was**\n\n**India.**\n\n**designed to perform**\n**similar tasks.**\n\n\n**mplant JsOutProx have**\n**capabilities similar to**\n\n**Hackers launder** **FIN-7 APT's Carbanak.**\n**money outside** **Carbanak shared the**\n\n**same goals and was**\n\n**India.**\n\n**designed to perform**\n**similar tasks.**\n\n\nOur clients are advised to apply updates regularly and ensure that their\nemployees are aware of such types of attacks.\n\n\n**The attackers are** **Hackers launder**\n**linked to other** **money outside**\n**organizations.** **India.**\n\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK:**\n\n\n**The attackers are** **Hackers launder**\n**linked to other** **money outside**\n**organizations.** **India.**\n\n\nObfuscation\n\n\nT1313\n\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\n\nT1082\n\n\nExfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\n\nT1041\n\n\nPersistence: Startup/Registry Keys\n\n\nT1060\n\n\nCommand And Control (C2)\n\n\nTA0011, T1001, T1132.001\n\n\nMSHTA Execution\n\n\nT1218.005\n\n\nWSCRIPT Execution\n\n\nT1059.007\n\n\nPhishing: Spear Phishing Attachment\n\n\nT1566.001\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOC** **Meta Description**\n\n\n06396c2f1ac27f7a453d9461ad1af8a6 : New version\n\n3C9F664193958E16C9C89423AEFCB6C8: Old Version\n\n9AED11D78DD7ECF5331360011B0EA9A8:\nDotUtil.Library.Cs.dll\n\nc4aa2b901d6bb29dff4e227362a032c6\n\nb308874f65c78ddecd335ce5d83246d3\n\n71bb3e4d16b4310e9d9d23057d49987a\n\n1d9056f9ebde111dc7f6af12727985e8\n\n0c7e3f6d22e5de96f4bf4d604a663968\n\n57b0fb87a0e95cefd7582e3345ca4d20\n\n7aaa51d0d6566cb7829d6d58361ee30f\n\n1ed75d4c96c4c7bfc1c9140ac1f18567\n\n04b2d333339b3b52e248ccb9ea761118\n\n5e20c14bf6d5b4d1977a4c03f5a3ec0f\n\n00c03e7a44b93910a9e30a4080dd6b29\n\n025da995f8f6920eb077e44f3469742d\n\n06117083f64d96135287c10b7a773f13\n\n06186d4b79c1d9e025621c94318c3729\n\n18746a6df8bca70d22d864f217df9112\n\n295d8fb6c515551f7d632add21b450e1\n\n32025fad1e9bf48297266a2bad41dd25\n\n48adcbbc3ec003101b4a2bb0aa5a7e01\n\n4ff53e2087cd0d288506389d67d1c046\n\n5111740d2eb8a8201231cb0e312db88a\n\n5b2b4f989f684e265b03f8334576a20c\n\n5d16911fe4bcc7d6a82c79b88e049af2\n\n61624005ee9539f39fe61e4453393db5\n\n64b8a83f291e90b551c43539c1cf2ae0\n\n6e52e6165ed8c41b05e518b55ae3da2e\n\n7e64550587ee21f4fbcc79a553ab0fa6\n\n848c9a8463a337eeb21a5b4650dc0215\n\n84b194b521afd8fef39552e5330d59f4\n\n91b0d69e988be9bd1c9eabb0d5ba1f45\n\n988d384c68c95d28e67d6b8edaf2ebe5\n\nbec6094a74e102a8d18630ee0eb053e3\n\nc6633929d10601c635fe9b67cf645c93\n\nd63e19f5221457c38bc3b4d7340e0f82\n\nd6b0f21dd46f11f64bf67effa36cea94\n\nd743f6bea36a000eb2464cfa5c4aed70\n\nf3dd5d2eb2829ddf395eab3e231c59ff\n\n5dd3361225ceee07852ec30436eefab4\n\n66e44095b5b654752995aa06405dd450\n\nf9a070a623788a4ecb2c7940291301b9\n\n61c5edbd2974259f9b39ab24a89b7ef2\n\n212b13a43a5d167dda1a82dbb2a94fbe\n\n3c9f664193958e16c9c89423aefcb6c8\n\n466d99ac1ca19b8732923d0510eb8385\n\n\nIndian Co-operative Banks and\nFinance Companies were targeted\nby Multi-Staged JSOutProx RAT\ngroup to steal sensitive data.
