    "plain_text": "# How the Boy Next Door Accidentally Built a Syrian Spy Tool\n\n**wired.com/2012/07/dark-comet-syrian-spy-tool/**\n\nRobert McMillan\n\nJean-Pierre Lesueur.\n\n_Photo: Jean-Pierre Lesueur_\n\nJean-Pierre Lesueur is in many ways a typical 22-year-old computer geek. He lives outside\nof Paris, coding Java by day for a European company that processes airline tickets. He\nlikes playing the piano and reading Stephen Hawking. But he's also the man who built Dark\nComet – which was recently used by the Syrian government to steal information from the\ncomputers of activists fighting to overthrow it.\n\nDark Comet is a software application that gives you remote control over another computer,\nand Lesueur says he wrote it just to prove his programming cred. That meant sharing the\nthing with the rest of the world, and after the Syrian government grabbed the tool from the\nnet, Lesueur found himself at the center of an international firestorm. He spoke with Wired\nTuesday via online chat.\n\nSometimes, the boy next door can become a tool in a state-sponsored cyberespionage\ncampaign. That's the power of the internet.\n\nAlthough it was first developed in 2008, Dark Comet mostly stayed under the radar until it\n[was linked to Syria earlier this year. Although Lesueur says he never intended it to be used](http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-17/tech/tech_web_computer-virus-syria_1_opposition-activists-computer-viruses-syrian-town)\nillegally, Dark Comet is not the type of program anyone would want to discover on their PC.\n\n\n-----\n\nthat helps it avoid detection by antivirus products. Dark Comet can be used for spying, too,\nquietly recording video and audio from a computer once it's installed.\n\nAccording to Lesueur, Dark Comet is no worse than other hacking tools such as Metasploit\nor BackTrack Linux, which can be used both by legitimate security testers and criminals to\nlaunch online attacks against computers and test networks for security flaws.\n\nDlshad Othman first learned about Dark Comet in December, when a Syrian activist asked\nhim to examine her computer after losing access to her e-mail, Skype, and Facebook\naccount. After a scan, Othman discovered Dark Comet sitting on the machine's hard drive.\n\nDark Comet was another tool in an escalating computer espionage campaign targeting\ncritics of the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. \"Because most of the Syrian people\nstarted to use secure connections and they [learned how to bypass] the censorship and\nsurveillance of the internet, so the regime found it’s better to use Trojans to arrest the\npeople,\" says Othman, a Syrian activist and computer specialist who is also one of the U.S.\nState Department's Internet Freedom Fellows.\n\nHe and other activists believe that the information stolen via Dark Comet led to many\narrests within Syria. Once one computer is infected, hackers use that activist's computer as\na stepping stone to try and infect others, typically by contacting them via Skype.\n\nThat's what happened to \"Osama,\" an activist in Damascus who declined to give his last\nname. About five months ago, a doctor friend of his received a file via Skype that appeared\nto have something to do with medicine and the Syrian revolution. \"His account started to\nsend this file to his contacts (including me) and as he is a doctor, many of his contacts\ntrusted this file,\" he said.\n\nOsama doesn't know for certain that his friend was infected with Dark Comet, but it's very\nlikely that he was. Researchers say that between November and May, this was a preferred\nremote access tool of the Syrian regime.\n\nMorgan Marquis-Boire – a researcher with Citizen Lab, a computer security research thinktank – has identified 16 separate pieces of malicious software that use Dark Comet to\nsend information back to computers located in Syria. Typically these are Trojan horse\nprograms, designed to look like legitimate files that activists would want to read. The\nTrojan might look like a .pdf file or a Skype encryption tool, but it silently installs Dark\nComet in the background. Dark Comet is known as a remote administration tool. Security\nexperts call it a RAT.\n\nDark Comet was packaged with malicious software that would quietly install it when\nvictims opened this .pdf.\n\n_Image: John Scott-Railton_\n\nAs word of Dark Comet's use got out, Lesueur's part-time project suddenly came under the\n[spotlight. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, antivirus companies, and online activists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/fake-skype-encryption-tool-targeted-syrian-activists-promises-security-delivers)\n\"kept up steady stream of postings and reports of the use of Dark Comet in Syria,\" says\n\n\n-----\n\npressure has ever been placed on the developer of a RAT before. I can't imagine that\n\n[Lesueur] expected anything like this to come from his project.\"\n\nAt first, Lesueur wrote a removal tool, so victims could uninstall Dark Comet, but he kept\nthe project alive. But by the end of June, he was afraid. Though he wasn't the one doing the\nillegal activity, it was clear that his software was being misused – not just by the Syrian\ngovernment, but by untalented hackers Lesueur calls \"script-kiddies.\"\n\nHe started to worry about being arrested. So on June 28, he [took down Dark Comet](http://www.darkcomet-rat.com/) . \"I\nremoved all before one day it happened,\" he says. \"I don't want to lose my life for such a\nlittle thing.\"\n\nLesueur says the Syrian use was a factor in his decision to pull Dark Comet, but not the only\none. He won't spell out the exact reason he was worried about his arrest, but two days\n[earlier, one of the apparent authors of another remote-access tool called Blackshades was](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32shadesrat-blackshades-author-arrested)\narrested in Tuscon, Arizona, on hacking and malware distribution charges. That arrest may\nhave scared Lesueur, says Kevin Mitnick, a well-known information security consultant.\n\nLesueur says that it did not affect his decision. \"The Blackshades author was in charge of a\ncarding operation,\" he says. \"It's not the same.\"\n\n[Blackshades, coincidentally, is now being used against the Syrian activists](https://citizenlab.org/2012/06/syrian-activists-targeted-with-blackshades-spy-software/) much in the\nsame way that Dark Comet was, says Marquis-Boire.\n\nMitnick, who has used Dark Comet in security demonstrations, doesn't think Leseur should\nhave abandoned his tool because it was being used illegally. \"I don't think that's a good\nreason to stop development on it, because you always have bad actors,\" he says. \"That's\njust a fact of life.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that a software developer has dropped a tool after getting some\nheat. But what's unusual is that Lesueur has been remarkably candid about everything,\nusing his real name, talking about himself in detail, and explaining why he created the tool.\n\nLesueur – who cut his teeth in a underground Trojan and RAT-writing forum called [OpenSC](http://powerplans.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/the-famous-underground-hacking-site-www-opensc-ws-is-down-closed-or-what/)\n– says that although he made about 2,000 euros offering technical support for Dark Comet,\nhe didn't charge for the software and was never in it for the money. He's now working on a\n[new remote access tool that doesn't include the controversial spying features that were in](http://pastelol.com/dpcE3s#top)\nDark Comet.\n\nAfter Lesueur pulled Dark Comet, Kevin Mitnick asked him if he'd ever consider selling the\nsource code to the tool. Lesueur said no. \"I don’t think he was out for money,\" Mitnick says.\n\"I don't think he was doing anything illegal.\"\n\nLesueur says he just wanted to make a name for himself in the hacker scene. \"The whole\ndevelopment process of Dark Comet was a challenge for myself,\" he says.\n\n\"I never imagined it would be used by a government for spying,\" he said. \"If I had known\nthat, I would never have created such a tool.\"\n\n\n-----",
