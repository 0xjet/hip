According to internal processing,\nthese DLLs have been identified as Emotet. However, since the botnet was taken down\nearlier this year, we were suspicious about the findings and conducted an initial manual\nverification. Please find first results and IOCs below. Currently, we have high confidence that\nthe samples indeed seem to be a re-incarnation of the infamous Emotet.\n\nWe are still conducting more in-depth analyses to raise the confidence even further. New\ninformation will be provided as they become available.\n\n## Initial Analysis\n\nSunday, November 14, 9:26pm: first occurence of the URLs being dropped; the URL we\nreceived was `hxxp://141.94.176.124/Loader_90563_1.dll (SHA256 of the drop:`\n```\nc7574aac7583a5bdc446f813b8e347a768a9f4af858404371eae82ad2d136a01 ). Internal\n\n```\nprocessing detected Emotet when executing the sample in our sandbox systems. Notably,\nthe sample seems to have been compiled just before the deployment via several Trickbot\nbotnets was observed: `Timestamp : 6191769A (Sun Nov 14 20:50:34 2021)`\n\nThe network traffic originating from the sample closely resembles what has been observed\n[previously (e.g. as described by Kaspersky): the URL contains a random resource path and](https://securelist.com/the-chronicles-of-emotet/99660/)\nthe bot transfers the request payload in a cookie (see image below). However, the encryption\nused to hide the data seems different from what has been observed in the past. Additionally,\nthe sample now uses HTTPS with a self-signed server certificate to secure the network\ntraffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork Traffic originating from the DLL\nA notable characteristic of the last Emotet samples was the heavy use of control-flow\nflattening to obfuscate the code. The current sample also contains flattened control flows. To\nillustrate the similarity in the style of the obfuscation, find two arbitrary code snippets below.\nLeft side is a sample from 2020, on the right is a snippet from the current sample:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion (so far)\n\nAs per the famous duck-typing, we conclude so far: smells like Emotet, looks like Emotet,\nbehaves like Emotet – seems to be Emotet.\n\nWe are currently updating our internal tooling for the new sample to provide more indicators\nto strengthen the claim that Emotet seems to be back.\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nURLs:\nhxxp://141.94.176.124/Loader_90563_1.dll\nHashes:\nc7574aac7583a5bdc446f813b8e347a768a9f4af858404371eae82ad2d136a01 - Loader_90563_1.dll\nServer List:\n81.0.236.93:443\n94.177.248.64:443\n66.42.55.5:7080\n103.8.26.103:8080\n185.184.25.237:8080\n45.76.176.10:8080\n188.93.125.116:8080\n103.8.26.102:8080\n178.79.147.66:8080\n58.227.42.236:80\n45.118.135.203:7080\n103.75.201.2:443\n195.154.133.20:443\n45.142.114.231:8080\n212.237.5.209:443\n207.38.84.195:8080\n104.251.214.46:8080\n138.185.72.26:8080\n51.68.175.8:8080\n210.57.217.132:8080\nString List:\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nPOST\n%s\\rundll32.exe \"%s\",Control_RunDLL\nControl_RunDLL\n%s\\%s\n%s\\%s\n%s\\%s%x\n%s%s.exe\n%s\\%s\nSHA256\nHASH\nAES\nMicrosoft Primitive Provider\nObjectLength\nKeyDataBlob\n%s\\rundll32.exe \"%s\\%s\",%s\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=%s\nRNG\n%s%s.dll\n%s\\rundll32.exe \"%s\",Control_RunDLL\n%s%s.dll\n%s\\regsvr32.exe -s \"%s\"\n%s\\%s\n%s%s.exe\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n%s\\rundll32.exe %s\\%s,%s\nECCPUBLICBLOB\nECDH_P256\nMicrosoft Primitive Provider\nECCPUBLICBLOB\nCookie: %s=%s\n%s\\rundll32.exe \"%s\\%s\",%s\n%s:Zone.Identifier\n%u.%u.%u.%u\n%s\\%s\n%s\\*\n%s\\%s\nWinSta0\\Default\n%s\\rundll32.exe \"%s\",Control_RunDLL %s\n%s%s.dll\nECCPUBLICBLOB\nECDSA_P256\nMicrosoft Primitive Provider\n%s\\%s\nSHA256\nMicrosoft Primitive Provider\nObjectLength\n\n```\n\n-----",
