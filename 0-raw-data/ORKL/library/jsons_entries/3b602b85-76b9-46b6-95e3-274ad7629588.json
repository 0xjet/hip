REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI is investigating the recent attacks, which include incidents in Oregon, California and\nNew York made public just this week, according to three cybersecurity consultants familiar\nwith the matter.\n\nA doctor at one hospital told Reuters that the facility was functioning on paper after an attack\nand unable to transfer patients because the nearest alternative was an hour away. The\ndoctor declined to be named because staff were not authorized to speak with reporters.\n\n“We can still watch vitals and getting imaging done, but all results are being communicated\nvia paper only,” the doctor said. Staff could see historic records but not update those files.\n\nExperts said the likely group behind the attacks was known as Wizard Spider or UNC 1878.\nThey warned that such attacks can disrupt hospital operations and lead to loss of life.\n\nThe attacks prompted a teleconference call on Wednesday led by FBI and Homeland\nSecurity officials for hospital administrators and cybersecurity experts.\n\nA participant told Reuters that government officials warned hospitals to make sure their\nbackup systems were in order, disconnect systems from the internet where possible, and\navoid using personal email accounts.\n\nThe FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“This appears to have been a coordinated attack designed to disrupt hospitals specifically all\naround the country,” said Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst with U.S. cybersecurity firm\nRecorded Future.\n\n“While multiple ransomware attacks against healthcare providers each week have been\ncommonplace, this is the first time we have seen six hospitals targeted in the same day by\nthe same ransomware actor.”\n\nIn the past, ransomware infections at hospitals have downed patient record-keeping\ndatabases, which critically store up-to-date medical information, affecting hospitals’ ability to\nprovide healthcare.\n\nRansomware attacks have jumped 50% over the past three months, security firm Check\nPoint said Wednesday, with the proportion of polled healthcare organizations impacted\njumping to 4% in the third quarter from 2.3% in the previous quarter.\n\nTwo of the three consultants familiar with the attacks said the cyber criminals were\ncommonly using a type of ransomware known as “Ryuk,” which locks up a victim’s computer\nuntil a payment is received.\n\nThe teleconference call participant said government officials disclosed that the attackers\nused Ryuk and another trojan, known as Trickbot, against the hospitals.\n\n\n-----\n\nUNC1878 is one of the most brazen, heartless, and disruptive threat actors I ve observed\nover my career,” said Charles Carmakal, senior vice president for U.S. cyber incident\nresponse firm Mandiant.\n\n“Multiple hospitals have already been significantly impacted by Ryuk ransomware and their\nnetworks have been taken offline.”\n\nExperts say the deployment of Trickbot is significant after efforts by Microsoft [MSFT.O to](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O)\ndisrupt the hacking network earlier this month.\n\nThat initiative was designed to handicap the cyber criminals, but they seem to have\nrecovered quickly, said Stefan Tanase, a cyber crime analyst.\n\n“What we are seeing here is confirmation that the reports of the Trickbot takedown were\ngreatly exaggerated,” he said.\n\nMicrosoft did not answer a request for comment.\n\nReporting by Christopher Bing and Joseph Menn; Editing by Tom Brown and Stephen\nCoates\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
