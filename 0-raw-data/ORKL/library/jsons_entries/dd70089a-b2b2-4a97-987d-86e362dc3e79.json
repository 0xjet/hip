The attackers used compromised websites or\n“watering holes” to infect pre-selected targets with previously unknown malware. There has\nbeen no evidence found yet that funds have been stolen from any infected banks.\n\nThe attacks came to light when a bank in Poland discovered previously unknown malware\nrunning on a number of its computers. The bank then shared indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) with other institutions and a number of other institutions confirmed that they too had\nbeen compromised.\n\nAs reported, the source of the attack appears to have been the website of the Polish\nfinancial regulator. The attackers compromised the website to redirect visitors to an exploit\nkit which attempted to install malware on selected targets.\n\nSymantec has blocked attempts to infect customers in Poland, Mexico and Uruguay by the\nsame exploit kit that infected the Polish banks. Since October, 14 attacks against computers\nin Mexico were blocked, 11 against computers in Uruguay, and two against computers in\nPoland.\n\n## Custom exploit kit\n\nThe attackers appear to be using compromised websites to redirect visitors to a customized\nexploit kit, which is preconfigured to only infect visitors from approximately 150 different IP\naddresses. These IP addresses belong to 104 different organizations located in 31 different\ncountries. The vast majority of these organizations are banks, with a small number of\ntelecoms and internet firms also on the list.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Countries in which three or more organizations were targeted by attackers_\n\n## Links to Lazarus?\n\n[The malware used in the attacks (Downloader.Ratankba) was previously unidentified,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-020908-1134-99)\nalthough it was detected by Symantec under generic detection signatures, which are\ndesigned to block any files seen to engage in malicious activities.\n\nAnalysis of the malware is still underway. Some code strings seen in the malware used\nshares commonalities with code from malware used by the threat group known as Lazarus.\n\nRatankba was observed contacting eye-watch[.]in for command and control (C&C)\ncommunications. Ratankba was then observed downloading a Hacktool. This Hacktool\nshows distinctive characteristics shared with malware previously associated with Lazarus.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Code strings seen in sample of Hacktool used in recent attacks_\n\n_Figure 3. Code strings seen in sample of Hacktool previously associated with Lazarus_\n\n[Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009, largely focused on](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=4b12a028-2cba-415d-bad8-19228ed3a7a1&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\ntargets in the US and South Korea. Lazarus has been involved in high level financial attacks\nbefore and some of the tools used in the Bangladesh bank heist shared code\nsimilarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to the group.\n\nFurther investigation of these attacks is underway and, over time, more evidence may\nemerge about the identity and motives of the attackers. After a series of high profile attacks\non banks during 2016, this latest incident provides a timely reminder of the growing range of\nthreats facing financial institutions.\n\n[click_to_tweet:1]\n\n## UPDATE – March 15, 2017:\n\nFurther investigation by Symantec into the recent attacks against banks in Poland has\nuncovered additional links to the threat group known as Lazarus. At the time of our original\nblog, Symantec had found one link: code strings seen in a Hacktool used in the Polish bank\nattacks shared distinctive characteristics with malware previously associated with Lazarus.\n\nThe number of tentative links Symantec has established has since broadened from one to\nfour. One piece of malware (MD5:91b2558f5319960c85522dc8e372a2b9) found on a\ncomputer at one of the Polish targets has been previously used and attributed to the\nLazarus group. The previously mentioned Lazarus-linked Hacktool was also found on the\nsame computer at the Polish target.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In addition to this, a sample of Downloader.Ratankba](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-020908-1134-99)\n(MD5:cb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2), which has only been seen in the 2017 Polish\nBank attacks, was submitted by a Symantec customer for analysis along with a sample of\n[Backdoor.Destover, the disk-wiping malware linked to Lazarus and used in the Sony](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-120209-5631-99)\nPictures attacks.\n\nA fourth link is the unique trait \"del /a %1\", which was found in Downloader.Ratankba. It was\n[also identified in multiple malware families linked to Lazarus including Backdoor.Joanap and](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-092507-0410-99)\nBackdoor.Destover.\n\nAs a result of these findings, Symantec has upgraded its assessment of a Lazarus link. The\ncrossover in tools used leads us to believe there is a reasonable possibility that the Polish\nbank attacks were the work of attackers linked to Lazarus.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec and Norton products protect against these attacks with the following detections:\n\n[Downloader.Ratankba](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-020908-1134-99)\n[Web Attack: SunDown Exploit Kit Website 5](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=27510)\n[Backdoor.Destover](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-120209-5631-99)\n\n## IOCs\n\nThe follow are indicators of compromise related to these attacks.\n\n**Command and control infrastructure**\n\neye-watch[.]in\nsap.misapor[.]ch\n\n**Downloader.Ratankba**\n\nMD5\n\n1f7897b041a812f96f1925138ea38c46\n911de8d67af652a87415f8c0a30688b2\n1507e7a741367745425e0530e23768e6\ncb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2\n18a451d70f96a1335623b385f0993bcc\n\nSHA256\n\n99017270f0af0e499cfeb19409020bfa0c2de741e5b32b9f6a01c34fe13fda7d\n825624d8a93c88a811262bd32cc51e19538c5d65f6f9137e30e72c5de4f044cc\n200c0f4600e54007cb4707c9727b1171f56c17c80c16c53966535c57ab684e22\n\n\n-----\n\n95c8ffe03547bcb0afd4d025fb14908f5230c6dc6fdd16686609681c7f40aca2\n7c77ec259162872bf9ab18f6754e0e844157b31b32b4a746484f444b9f9a3836\n\n**Hacktool**\n\nMD5\n\n3af4e21bbbeb846ca295143e03ec0054\n\nSHA256\n\nefa57ca7aa5f42578ab83c9d510393fcf4e981a3eb422197973c65b7415863e7\n\n**Backdoor.Destover**\n\nMD5\n\n7fe80cee04003fed91c02e3a372f4b01\n\nSHA256\n\n4fe3c853ab237005f7d62324535dd641e1e095d1615a416a9b39e042f136cf6b\n\n\n-----",
