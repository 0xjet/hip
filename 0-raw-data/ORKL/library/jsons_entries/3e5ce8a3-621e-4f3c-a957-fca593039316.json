    "plain_text": "# SMS PVA Services' Use of Infected Android Phones Reveals Flaws in SMS Verification\n\n**trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/b/sms-pva-services-use-of-infected-android-phones-reveals-flaws-in-sms-**\nverification.html\n\nFebruary 16, 2022\n\nUsing these code snippets and C&C traffic as fingerprints, we were able to identify two more\nDEX files with the same functionality but different C&Cs, indicating an active development\nprocess and several versions of both the development code and production code of the\n\n\n-----\n\nAndroid malware.\n\nOnly text messages sent by specific services and matched by the regex provided by the\nC&C were intercepted. This is likely to prevent the user of the Android phone from\ndiscovering the malicious activity. The malware remains low-profile, collecting only the text\nmessages that match the requested application so that it can covertly continue this activity\nfor long periods. If the SMS PVA service allows its customers to access all messages on the\ninfected phones, the owners would quickly notice the problem.\n\nThe SMS PVA service also controls the type of platforms that customers can receive text\nmessages on (as listed in Figure 1). This means that the operators behind the service can\nmake sure no obvious malicious activity occurs on the infected phones. If the service, for\nexample, allowed the theft of two-factor authentication (2FA) for banking apps, then the real\nusers would be alerted and take action, which would then result in the SMS PVA service\nlosing its asset.\n\n**Use of residential proxies**\n\nOnline platforms and services often authenticate new accounts by validating the location of\nthe user during registration. For example, an IP address might be required to match the\ngeographical location of the phone number used for the account.\n\nTo circumvent this, SMS PVA users use third-party IP masking services, such as proxies or\nvirtual private networks (VPNs), to change the IP address that will be recorded when they try\nto connect to a desired service. Using Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN)\ntelemetry, we have identified that the users of SMS PVA services extensively use a variety of\nproxy services and distributed VPN platforms to bypass the IP geolocation verification\nchecks.\n\nUser registration requests and SMS PVA API requests often come from an exit node of a\nVPN service or a residential proxy system. This means that the users of SMS PVA services\ntypically use them in combination with some sort of residential proxy or a VPN service that\nallows them to select the country of the IP exit node to match the telephone number used to\nregister the service.\n\nSecurity implications of SMS PVA services and their effects on SMS verification\n\nSMS verification has become the default authentication method for many online platforms\nand applications. Many IT departments treat SMS verification as a “secure” black box\nvalidation tool for user accounts. Currently, however, online services and platforms should be\nwary about heavily relying on SMS verification. These SMS PVA services prove that\ncybercriminals are indeed able to defeat SMS verification at scale. This also means that\nthere could be authenticated and verified accounts on platforms that behave like bots, trolls,\nor fraudulent accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nAuthentic user behavior on certain platforms can be manipulated by malicious actors with\nSMS PVA accounts. This means that a platform could incur increased costs due to scam and\nfraud. A platform might even be involved (directly or indirectly) with personal injury or\ndamage to property.\n\nBased on previous uses of fake accounts, we can predict how threat actors will use these\nservices in their scams and criminal activities.\n\n**Anonymity tool**\n\nCybercriminals use disposable numbers for many different activities because they can\nregister accounts without worrying about being traced. Also, because the infected mobile\nphone numbers they use are attached to real people, law enforcement inquests about their\naccounts will be traced to another person.\n\nWe saw one example of misuse linked to a buy-now-pay-later scheme. In this example,\nseveral malware samples used SMS PVA services to acquire phone numbers and linked\nthose numbers to existing online payment service accounts. Afterward, the malicious actors\nattempted purchase transactions from an online shopping site. Although we only identified a\nfew samples of such activities, we believe that when automated, these accounts can be used\nat large to perform illicit purchases or money laundering.\n\nThese services can also be used to avoid responsibility for damages or illegal activity on\ncommerce platforms. In 2020, a Russian car-sharing service accused a man of being\ninvolved in a car accident. However, it was revealed that the account used for the car-sharing\nservice was a [fraudulent account set up using the accused man’s name and disposable SIM](https://www.autonews.ru/news/5e4e259f9a79471aef9b7d61)\ncards for verification.\n\n**Coordinated inauthentic behavior**\n\nCoordinated inauthentic behavior is often used to distribute and amplify information (often\nmisinformation) in social networks. This can be done at scale, fast, and with the necessary\nspeed and precision using SMS PVA services. Large campaigns can be used to manipulate\npublic opinion on brands, services, political views, or government programs such as\nvaccination campaigns. Organizers of fake news can even use SMS PVA services to create\nonline troll armies.\n\nSome SMS PVA services have thousands of compromised smartphones spread across\nvarious countries. The service can allow customers to register social media accounts in bulk\nand in specific countries that the actors behind these services are targeting.\n\n**Abuse of sign-on bonuses**\n\n\n-----\n\nSign-on bonuses (often given whenever a new account is registered) can also be abused\nusing the SMS PVA service. For example, Bolt, a ride-hailing service popular in Eastern\nEurope, Africa, and Western Asia, incentivized new sign-ons by giving away free ride credits\nfor every new account. Some SMS PVA services realized this as a potential monetization\n[scheme and even advertised having “unlimited discounted Bolt rides” to persuade people to](https://sms-man.com/blog/how-do-i-order-a-bolt-taxi-with-an-endless-discount/)\nuse the SMS PVA service.\n\nConclusions and recommendations\n\nThe core security issue is that an enterprise has the ability to monitor and intercept text\nmessaging from tens of thousands of devices all around the world, and then profit from this\ninterception by offering the service to whoever can pay for it. Another chilling thought is that\nthe customizable regular expression patterns supplied by the C&C mean that the SMS\ninterception capability is not limited to verification codes. It can also be extended to the\ncollection of one-time password (OTP) tokens or even used as a monitoring tool by\noppressive regimes.\n\nThe SMS PVA service operation not only shows the inadequacy and insufficiency of one-time\nSMS verification as the primary means of validation, but also highlights the need for better\nmobile security and privacy. The malware that infects these phones might be unwittingly\ndownloaded by users, or could imply a gap in supply-chain security.\n\nTrend Micro is able to detect the malicious code and block traffic to C&C servers. But a\ncomprehensive solution requires challenging built-in fundamental assumptions with respect\nto account verification, more effective content moderation, and enhancing smartphone\nsecurity.\n\nTo read more about this threat, download our research paper, “SMS PVA: An Underground\nService Enabling Threat Actors to Register Bulk Fake Accounts.”\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Dex SHA 1** **Detection**\n\n24b24990937b4265e276db8271b309c05e1d374b AndroidOS_Guerrilla.HRXD\n\n6a65e2a484f49e82a0cea5a1c2d5706314f0064a AndroidOS_Guerrilla.HRXD\n\ne83ec56dfb094fb87b57b67449d23a18208d3091 AndroidOS_Guerrilla.HRXD\n\n**Domains:**\n\n**Smspva[.]net**\n**Enjoynut[.]cn**\n**Sublemontree[.]com**\n**Lemon91[ ]com**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Lemon91[.]top**\n\nMobile\n\nCertain SMS PVA services allow their customers to create disposable user profiles or\nregister multiple accounts on many popular online platforms. These services can be abused\nby criminals to conduct fraud or other malicious activities.\n\nBy: Zhengyu Dong, Ryan Flores, Vladimir Kropotov, Paul Pajares, Fyodor Yarochkin\nFebruary 16, 2022 Read time: ( words)\n\n\n-----",
