More than 2,000 home\nusers, companies and non-profits used it to retrieve their lost data and avoid paying millions\nin ransom.\n\nTen months later, we released another decryptor to expand support to GandCrab versions 1,\n4 and 5 up to 5.0.3. Ever since, we been contacted by and keeping in touch with thousands\nof victims seeking help.\n\nWhile this is the third time we have defeated GandCrab encryption in the past year, our\ncelebration will be short-lived. We’ll be back to work tomorrow, as GandCrab operators will\nno doubt change tactics and techniques.\n\n**GandCrab in Numbers**\n\nGandCrab has inflicted hundreds of millions of dollars in losses globally since its emergence,\nand is now one of the most prevalent families of ransomware on the market. Since our first\ndecryptor, in aggregate we have already helped nearly 10,000 victims save more than $5\n\n\n-----\n\nmillion dollars in decryption fees nearly 20,000 victims save a minimum of $18 million US\ndollars by the end of February: .\n\n**GandCrab on the Attack**\n\nLast year, some GandCrab affiliates began attacking organizations via exposed Remote\nDesktop Protocol instances, or by directly logging in with stolen domain credentials. After\nauthenticating on a compromised PC, attackers manually run the ransomware and instruct it\nto spread across the entire network. Once the network is infected, the attackers wipe their\ntraces clean and contact the victim with a decryption offer.\n\n[Recently, GandCrab operators have also started delivering ransomware to companies via](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gandcrab-ransomware-gang-infects-customers-of-remote-it-support-firms/)\nvulnerabilities in remote IT support software used by managed service providers to manage\ncustomer workstations. To learn more about what MSPs need to do in order to stay safe\nfrom ransomware, [watch our webinar:](https://businessresources.bitdefender.com/webinar-gandcrab_targeting_msp?hsCtaTracking=25598f7e-7dc2-4bed-a4b9-dbd897ead3ad%7C9653a159-d27c-4600-aae3-ac571b962725)\n\n**GandCrab is targeting MSPs. Are you sure you’re protected?**\n\nGandCrab is targeting MSPs. Are you sure you’re protected? | Bitdefender Webinar | MSP\n\nLearn what GandCrab attacks look like and how you can limit potential damage to your\nbusiness. Best security practices to protect your business and clients offered by Bitdefender.\n\nBitdefender Antivirus\n\n\n-----\n\nThis persistence is why prevention is crucial. If you have a security solution, make sure it is\nup-to-date and has layered defenses against ransomware. The better it is at detection, the\nlower your chances of infection. Also make sure you are running the latest version of your\nOS and third-party software.\n\nIf you don’t have a security solution, get one now. It helps a lot, and it’s way less expensive\nthan a $600 ransom payment.\n\nLast but not least, stop whatever you are doing and make and verify an external backup of\n_your important data. Should disaster strike, you will have a copy to restore from._\n\nOtherwise, Bitdefender and partner law enforcement agencies advise victims to reject the\ndemands of ransomware operators. Instead, back up the encrypted information and notify\nthe police immediately.
