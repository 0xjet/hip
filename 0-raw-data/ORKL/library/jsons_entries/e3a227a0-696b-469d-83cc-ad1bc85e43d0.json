At the time, Marsalek is described](https://motherboard.vice.com/tag/Hacking+Team)\nas an official representative of the government of Grenada, a small Caribbean island of\naround 100,000 people, in a letter that bears the letterhead of the Grenada government. The\n[documents were included in a cache published after Hacking Team was hacked in 2015. In](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3dad3n/the-vigilante-who-hacked-hacking-team-explains-how-he-did-it)\n[recent days, Marsalek has been described as the 'world's most wanted man.'](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/07/18/worlds-most-wanted-man-jan-marsalek-located-in-belarus-data-points-to-russian-intel-links/)\n\nIt is unclear from the documents alone whether Marsalek played any role in the attempt to\nprocure hacking tools, or whether his name was simply used. However, months before\nMarsalek appears to have contacted with Hacking Team, several websites with official\nsounding names such as StateOfGrenada.org were registered under the name of Jan\n\n\n-----\n\nMarsalek, as _[Der Spiegel reported last week. Some of the sites were registered with](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/wirecard-milliardenbluff-spionagethriller-politaffaere-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000172071795)_\nMarsalek’s phone number and his Munich address at the time, and the servers were\napparently operated from Germany.\n\nWirecard provided digital payment services and was considered one of the most important\ncompanies in the financial tech industry. Wirecard offered a mobile payment app called\nBoon, which was essentially a virtual MasterCard card, it also offered a prepaid debit card\ncalled mycard2go, and worked with companies such as KLM, Rakuten, and Qatar Airways to\nmanage their online transactions. The company suddenly collapsed in June after German\nregulators raided its headquarters as part of an investigation into fraudulent stock price\nmanipulation and 1.9 billion euros that are missing from the company’s books. Marsalek is\n[now a fugitive and a key suspect in the German investigation. He reportedly fled to Belarus,](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/07/18/worlds-most-wanted-man-jan-marsalek-located-in-belarus-data-points-to-russian-intel-links/)\nand is now hiding in Russia under the protection of the FSB, according to German news\nreports. In the past, he was involved in other strange dealings: he bragged about an attempt\nto recruit 15,000 Libyan militiamen, and about a trip to Syria along with Russian military,\n[according to the Financial Times.](https://www.ft.com/content/511ecf86-ab40-486c-8f76-b8ebda4cc669)\n\n“Further to your discussion with our representative, Mr. Jan Marsalek, we would like to\nhereby confirm the interest of the Government of Grenada in exploring a potential acquisition\nof the smartphone interception platform of your company,” reads what appears to be an\nofficial Grenada government letter dated October 31, 2013 allegedly signed by the Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs Nickolas Steele.\n\nA letter that was attached to emails between a Mexican intermediary and Hacking Team.\n\nAlong with a Mexican intermediary, Marsalek appears to have brokered a meeting in Milan at\nHacking Team’s headquarters on November 27, 2013, according to the leaked emails. An\nemail dated November 28 mentions a “fruitful meeting” with Marsalek and an associate\n“regarding Grenada.”\n\n“Mr. Marsalek will report his impressions to the Grenada officers, if positive, the process will\ntake around three weeks. Please keep us updated,” wrote Marco Bettini, one of Hacking\nTeam’s founders and the then sales manager.\n\nA former Hacking Team employee, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed receiving\nthe emails regarding the meeting. He said, however, that he was not present at the meeting.\n\nAs it turns out, Marsalek was never a Grenada government representative, Der Spiegel and\nMotherboard have found.\n\nIn a phone call, Steele, who is now the Minister Health in Grenada said the document leaked\nin the Hacking Team emails is fraudulent.\n\n\n-----\n\nI can categorically state that the letter in your attachment bearing a resemblance to my\nsignature and office at that time is a fraudulent document,” Steele said in the phone call,\nreferring to the apparent business deal between Grenada and Hacking Team. “I certainly did\nnot make that request or any such request.”\n\n**_Do you work or used to work at Hacking Team or another surveillance vendor?_**\n**_We’d love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can_**\n**_contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382,_**\n**_OTR chat at lorenzofb@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv._**\n\nSteele confirmed to Spiegel and Motherboard that he had met Marsalek and another person\nwhose name is mentioned in the document in the summer 2013. “He was a very charismatic\nyoung man and a smooth talker,” Steele remembers. The meetings were about a business\nproposal from Marsalek involving Wirecard technology. In the end, however, no deal was\nmade, Steele said.\n\nThe head of Encryptech, a Mexican company that is mentioned in the letter, and which\nworked as an intermediary between Hacking Team and some government customers, called\nthe letter “fake.”\n\n“They used the name of my company without authorization,” Alfonso Ayensa said in an\nonline chat.\n\nThe spyware deal, however, never went through. It is impossible to say from the documents\nalone who was attempting to procure these hacking tools, what they were going to be used\nfor, or how involved Marsalek was. Hacking Team has always maintained that it only sold its\nproducts to government agencies, after obtaining an export license from the Italian\ngovernment. Had this deal gone through, it would have been the first known case where\nHacking Team’s powerful spyware ended up in the hands of private citizens.\n\nPaolo Lezzi, the head of Memento Labs, the company that was born out of Hacking Team’s\nashes, said Grenada was never a customer, based on the company’s internal documents he\nhas access to. Two other former Hacking Team employees who worked there in 2013 and\nonwards, said Grenada never purchased the company's products.\n\n**_Subscribe to our new cybersecurity podcast,_** **_[CYBER](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2)_** **_._**\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
