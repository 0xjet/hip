We dub the family “SlemBunk,” and have seen it covering three\nmajor continents: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\nSlemBunk apps masquerade as common, popular applications and stay incognito after\nrunning for the first time. They have the ability to phish for and harvest authentication\ncredentials when specified banking and other similar apps are launched. At the time of this\nwriting, we can confirm that a set of the control servers gathering gleaned credentials is still\nlive and active.\n\nWe have not observed any instances of SlemBunk on Google Play, so users will only get\ninfected if the malware is sideloaded or downloaded from a malicious website. Newer\nversions of SlemBunk were observed being distributed via porn websites. Users who visit\nthese sites are incessantly prompted to download an Adobe Flash update to view the porn,\nand doing so downloads the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur comprehensive investigation of SlemBunk has led to the identification of more than\n170 samples in the wild. These SlemBunk samples exhibit a range of characteristics\nand behaviors, including:\nHighly customized login UI for a variety of financial management services such as high\nprofile banks;\nRunning in the background and monitoring the active running processes;\nDetecting the launch of specified legitimate apps and intelligently displaying\ncorresponding fake login interfaces;\nHijacking user credentials and transmitting to a remote command and control (CnC)\nserver;\nHarvesting and exfiltrating sensitive device information to the CnC servers including\nphone number, installed app list, device model, OS version;\nReceiving and executing remote commands sent through text messages and network\ntraffic;\nPersisting on the infected device via device administrator privilege.\n\nOur in-depth analysis into the full set of samples provides more insights into this malware\nfamily. Since its debut, SlemBunk has gone through several iterations, with each one raising\nthe bar of sophistication by adding more advanced capabilities. Based on our examination of\nSlemBunk over time, we observed the following developments:\n\nAdvanced features are added to support more remote control commands;\n\nRemote CnC servers keep changing among samples;\nMore financial services apps are added into the list, with new UI and their\ncorresponding logic;\nDifferent levels of obfuscation mechanisms are adopted to avoid detection.\n\nThrough our investigation, we have discovered SlemBunk spoofing the apps of 31 banks\nacross the globe – some of which are among the biggest banks in the world – as well as\nusers of two popular mobile payment service provider apps.\n\nWhile financial gain is the primary goal of this malware, SlemBunk is also interested in user\ndata. This is reflected by its attempt to hijack the login credentials of high profile Android\napplications, including popular social media apps, utility apps instant messaging apps.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe remainder of this blog presents the technical and operational aspects of this malware in\ngreater detail.\n\n### Major Components\n\n\n-----\n\nThe core objective of SlemBunk is to phish for authentication credentials – primarily for\nfinancial institutions – by pushing a fake login interface when a specified app is running in the\nforeground. Figure 1 – the Manifest file from one of the non-obfuscated samples with\npackage name \"org.slempo.service\" – shows an overview of the main components of\nSlemBunk.\n\n**_ServiceStarter: An Android receiver that will be invoked once an app is launched or_**\nthe device boots up. Its functionality is to start the monitoring service, MainService, in\nthe background.\n**_MainService: An Android service that runs in the background and monitors all running_**\nprocesses on the device. It prompts the user with an overlay view that resembles the\nlegitimate app when that app is launched. This monitoring service also communicates\nwith a remote host by sending the initial device data, notifying of device status and app\npreferences.\n**_MessageReceiver: An Android receiver that handles incoming text messages. In_**\naddition to the functionality of intercepting the authentication code from the bank, this\ncomponent also acts as the bot client for remote command and control.\n**_activities/Card: One UI view designed to mimic those of the targeted apps._**\n**_MyDeviceAdminReceiver: Device admin functionality requested the first time this app_**\nis launched. This makes the app more difficult to remove.\n\nFigure 1. SlemBunk main components\n\nFigure 2 offers a glance into the execution flow of the malware. When the app is launched for\nthe first time, it activates the registered receiver, which subsequently starts the monitoring\nservice in the background. On the surface it pops up a fake UI claiming to be Adobe Flash\n\n\n-----\n\nPlayer, or other advertised applications, and requests to be the device admin. Upon being\ngranted admin privileges, it removes its icon from the launcher and remains running in the\nbackground. A corresponding UI requesting for authentication credentials shows up when\none of the specified apps is detected running in the foreground.\n\nFigure 2. The workflow graph of SlemBunk\n\nTargeted App Detection & Interface Overlay\n\nSlemBunk employs a long running service in the background (MainService), which\nschedules a few tasks. One of the tasks is to query all the running processes and check if\nany of the specified apps are running in the foreground. The detection of a legitimate app is\nas simple as comparing the package name of the top running app to that of a specified app.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe noticed the SlemBunk authors have invested time in making sure that the look and feel\nof the phishing UI closely resembles that of the original. In some instances, the phishing\ninterface requests that the user type in their credentials twice rather than once. It also forces\nthe user to go through a fake verification process, which we suspect is to increase the user’s\nconfidence in its authenticity.\n\n### Remote Communication\n\nSlemBunk utilizes a simple yet effective remote communication mechanism that enables a\nserver to command and control theinstalled malware. We identified two ways a SlemBunk\nsample communicates with its control server:\n\n**HTTP: Many of the remote server IPs are hardcoded in the source code for early**\ndeveloped samples. For newer samples, SlemBunk authors used basic Base64\nencoding in the hope of fending off reverse engineering. Figure 3 shows a short snippet\nof code that decodes the encoded data.\n\nThere are primarily three requests from the client to the server:\n\n_Initial Checkin: this request informs the server about successful installation and_\nrunning, with device data being uploaded to the server. That data includes device\nmodel, OS version, phone number, app list, and country name.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. The Base64 decoding of SlemBunk remote server\n\n_Regular Status Report: this request informs the server about its status. The status_\nreport often covers the status of SMS listening and interception, the phone number,\nand the locking status. Figure 4 shows the captured traffic for this process.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Regular Status Report\n\n_Phished Data Upload: once the malware gets a hold of credentials, it sends them to the_\nremote server.\n\n**SMS: The remote server is capable of controlling the malicious app’s behavior through**\ntext messages. For instance, \"intercept_sms_stop\" stops the interception of SMS\nmessages and \"intercept_sms_start\" restarts the interception. Command \"lock\" mutes\nthe device’s audio system, which effectively conceals the arrival of text messages or\nphone calls. Command \"wipe_data\" wipes all the data partition of the infected device.\nThe complete list of supported commands is shown in Appendix A. The relevant code\nis shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. SMS based command & control\n\n### Evolution of the Family\n\nSlemBunk has evolved throughout time. The earliest samples mainly target users of popular\nsocial networking apps, but later samples started to be more focused on defrauding users of\nfinancial services apps, with a clear objective on financial gain. Among all the specified apps,\nwe have observed that banks in Australia are among SlemBunk’s favorites, with banks in the\nU.S. coming in second.\n\nAs SlemBunk expands its coverage of banks, its code has also become more sophisticated.\nNotably, later samples utilize different techniques to obscure potential reverse engineering.\nFigure 4 shows an obscured string that is Base64 encoded. In a few cases, SlemBunk\nauthors took advantage of a commercial packer, DexProtector, which was designed to\nprotect apps from being pirated. However, when used by a malicious application, it raises the\ndifficulty for the analysis process.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe rise and evolution of the SlemBunk trojan clearly indicates that mobile malware has\nbecome more sophisticated and targeted, and involves more organized efforts. We have\nalready seen crackdowns on malware campaigns targeting mobile banking users [1, 2], but\nwe do not expect this type of activity to go away anytime soon. To protect yourself from these\nthreats, FireEye suggests that you:\n\nDo not install apps outside the official app store.\nKeep Android devices updated. (Upgrading to the latest version of OS will provide\nsome security, but it does not guarantee that you will remain protected.)\n\nTo detect and defend against such attacks, we advise our customers to deploy our mobile\nsecurity solution, FireEye MTP/MSM. This helps our clients gain visibility into threats in their\nuser base, and also enables them to proactively hunt down devices that have been\ncompromised. In addition, we advise our customers with NX appliances to ensure that Wi-Fi\ntraffic is scanned by NX appliances to extend coverage to mobile devices.\n\n[1]http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-campaign-targetssouth-korean-banks-uses-pinterest-as-cc-channel/\n\n[2]http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/android-banking-trojan-delivers-customizedphishing-pages-straight-cloud\n\n### Appendix A: List of the Control Commands Delivered via SMS\n\n#block_numbers\n#control_number\n#disable_forward_calls\n#intercept_sms_start\nintercept_sms_stop\n#lock\nunblock_all_numbers\nunblock_numbers\nunlock\nupdate_html\nwipe_data\ncheck\n#check_gps\ncontrol_number\ngrab_apps\n#listen_sms_start\nlisten_sms_stop\n#sentid\nshow_dialog\n#show_html\n\n\n-----",
