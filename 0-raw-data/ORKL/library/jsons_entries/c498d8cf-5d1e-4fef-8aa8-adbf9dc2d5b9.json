So they've suspended the use of so\ncalled thumb drives, CDs, flash media cards, and all other removable data storage devices from their nets, to try to keep the worm from\n\nmultiplying any further.\n\nThe ban comes from the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, according to an internal Army e-mail. It applies to both the secret [SIPR and](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNET)\n\nunclassified [NIPR nets. The suspension, which includes everything from external hard drives to \"floppy disks,\" is supposed to take effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIPRNET)\n\n\"immediately.\" Similar notices went out to the other military services.\n\nIn some organizations, the ban would be only a minor inconvenience. But the military relies heavily on such drives to store information.\n\nBandwidth is often scarce out in the field. Networks are often considered unreliable. Takeaway storage is used constantly as a substitute.\n\n[The problem, according to a second Army e-mail, was prompted by a \"virus called Agent.btz.\" That's a variation of the \"SillyFDC\" worm, which](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-071111-0646-99&tabid=2)\n\nspreads by copying itself to thumb drives and the like. When that drive or disk is plugged into a second computer, the worm replicates itself\n\ni thi ti th PC \"F th it t ti ll d l d d f th l ti A d th t d ld b tt h\n\n\n-----\n\nServicemembers are supposed to \"cease usage of all USB storage media until the USB devices are properly scanned and determined to be free\n\nof malware,\" one e-mail notes.\n\nEventually, some government-approved drives will be allowed back under certain \"mission-critical,\" but unclassified, circumstances.\n\n\"Personally owned or non-authorized devices\" are \"prohibited\" from here on out.\n\nTo make sure troops and military civilians are observing the suspension, government security teams \"will be conducting daily scans and\n\nrunning custom scripts on NIPRNET and SIPRNET to ensure the commercial malware has not been introduced,\" an e-mail says. \"Any\n\ndiscovery of malware will result in the opening of a security incident report and will be referred to the appropriate security officer for action.\"\n\n\"The USB ban should be effective in stopping the worm,\" Olson says. Asked if such a wide-spread measure was a bit of over-kill, Olson\n\nresponded, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I know this [is an] inconvenience,\" e-mails one Michigan Army National Guardsman. \"This has been briefed to the CoS [Chief of Staff] of the\n\nARMY. This is not just a problem for Michigan, and is effecting operations around the world. This is a very serious threat and should be treated\n\nas such. Please understand that this is a form of attack, and we need to have patience in dealing with this issue.\"\n\n[Photo: Department of Defense]\n\n[#INFO WAR](https://www.wired.com/tag/info-war/)\n\n\nVIEW COMMENTS\n\n\n### SPONSORED STORIES\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN BRIAN BARRETT DAVID NIELD BRIAN BARRETT EMILY DREYFUSS\n\nThe Sensors That Power Online Stock Simple Steps to The Explosive-Carrying Security News This Week: Air\n\n\n-----\n\nVOTING MACHINES\n\nAt DefCon, the Biggest Election Threat Is Lack of Funding\n\n[LILY HAY NEWMAN](https://www.wired.com/author/lily-hay-newman/)\n\n\nSECURITY ROUNDUP\n\nSurprise, the FCC Lied About That DDoS Attack\n\n[EMILY DREYFUSS](https://www.wired.com/author/emily-dreyfuss/)\n\n\nLOUISE MATSAKIS\n[Even Anonymous Coders Leave](https://www.wired.com/story/machine-learning-identify-anonymous-code/)\nFingerprints\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[Bugs in Mobile Credit Card Readers C](https://www.wired.com/story/bugs-in-mobile-credit-card-readers-could-leave-buyers-exposed/)\nExpose Buyers\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[Hacking a Brand New Mac Remotely,](https://www.wired.com/story/mac-remote-hack-wifi-enterprise/)\nOut of the Box\n\nEMILY DREYFUSS\n[Smartphone Voting Is Happening, bu](https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-voting-is-happening-west-virginia/)\nOne Knows if It's Safe\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[A New Pacemaker Hack Puts Malware](https://www.wired.com/story/pacemaker-hack-malware-black-hat/)\nDirectly on the Device\n\n\nLOUISE MATSAKIS\n[Even Anonymous Coders Leave](https://www.wired.com/story/machine-learning-identify-anonymous-code/)\nFingerprints\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[Bugs in Mobile Credit Card Readers C](https://www.wired.com/story/bugs-in-mobile-credit-card-readers-could-leave-buyers-exposed/)\nExpose Buyers\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[Hacking a Brand New Mac Remotely,](https://www.wired.com/story/mac-remote-hack-wifi-enterprise/)\nOut of the Box\n\nEMILY DREYFUSS\n[Smartphone Voting Is Happening, bu](https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-voting-is-happening-west-virginia/)\nOne Knows if It's Safe\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[A New Pacemaker Hack Puts Malware](https://www.wired.com/story/pacemaker-hack-malware-black-hat/)\nDirectly on the Device\n\n\n[A New Pacemaker Hack Puts Malware](https://www.wired.com/story/pacemaker-hack-malware-black-hat/)\nDirectly on the Device\n\n## IOT\n HACKABLE TOUCHSCREENS COUL ON HOTEL ROOMS AND MEETINGS\n\n[LOUISE MATSAKIS](https://www.wired.com/author/louise-matsakis/)\n\n\n#NEVERTW EET\n\nA Tweet About Hacking Gets a Google Engineer in Trouble\n\n[LOUISE MATSAKIS](https://www.wired.com/author/louise-matsakis/)\n\n\n#NEVERTW EET\n\nA Tweet About Hacking Gets a Google Engineer in Trouble\n\n[LOUISE MATSAKIS](https://www.wired.com/author/louise-matsakis/)\n\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n[WIRED’s biggest stories delivered to your inbox.](https://www.wired.com/newsletter)\n\n\nVOTING MACHINES\n\nAt DefCon, the Biggest Election Threat Is Lack of Funding\n\n[LILY HAY NEWMAN](https://www.wired.com/author/lily-hay-newman/)\n\n\nLOUISE MATSAKIS\n[Even Anonymous Coders Leave](https://www.wired.com/story/machine-learning-identify-anonymous-code/)\nFingerprints\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[Bugs in Mobile Credit Card Readers C](https://www.wired.com/story/bugs-in-mobile-credit-card-readers-could-leave-buyers-exposed/)\nExpose Buyers\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[Hacking a Brand New Mac Remotely,](https://www.wired.com/story/mac-remote-hack-wifi-enterprise/)\nOut of the Box\n\nEMILY DREYFUSS\n[Smartphone Voting Is Happening, bu](https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-voting-is-happening-west-virginia/)\nOne Knows if It's Safe\n\nLILY HAY NEWMAN\n[A New Pacemaker Hack Puts Malware](https://www.wired.com/story/pacemaker-hack-malware-black-hat/)\nDirectly on the Device\n\n\nDirectly on the Device\n\n## IOT\n HACKABLE TOUCHSCREENS COUL ON HOTEL ROOMS AND MEETINGS\n\n[LOUISE MATSAKIS](https://www.wired.com/author/louise-matsakis/)\n\n\nBUGS\n\nMillions of Android Devices Are Vulnerable Out of the Box\n\n[BRIAN BARRETT](https://www.wired.com/author/brian-barrett/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://www.wired.com/subscribe/) [ADVERTISE](https://www.wired.com/wired-advertising/) [SITE MAP](https://www.wired.com/sitemap/) [PRESS CENTER](https://www.wired.com/about/press/) [FAQ](https://www.wired.com/about/faq/) [ACCESSIBILITY HELP](https://www.wired.com/about/accessibility-help/) [CUSTOMER CARE](https://subscriptions.wired.com/pubs/N3/WIR/Register.jsp?cds_page_id=175371&amp;cds_mag_code=WIR&amp;id=1423757547774&amp;lsid=50431012277019467&amp;vid=1) [CONTACT US](https://www.wired.com/about/feedback/) [SECUREDROP](https://www.wired.com/securedrop/) [T-SHIRT COLLECTION](https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/wired/109426?source=NativeFooter) [NEWSLETTER](https://www.wired.com/services/newsletters/demographics/) [WIRED STAFF](https://www.wired.com/wired-staff/) [JOBS](https://www.wired.com/about/wired-jobs/) [RSS](https://www.wired.com/about/rss_feeds/)\n\nCNMN Collection\n\n© 2018 Condé Nast.
