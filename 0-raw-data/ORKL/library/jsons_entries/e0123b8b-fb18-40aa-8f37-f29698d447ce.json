This unique\nand extremely dangerous malware framework was involved in the December 2016 blackout\nin Ukraine. What sets Industroyer apart from other malware targeting infrastructure, such as\nBlackEnergy (a.k.a. SandWorm), is its ability to control switches and circuit breakers directly\nvia four different industrial communication protocols.\n\nOur talk will cover a detailed analysis of Industroyer's malicious payloads that directly\ninterfere with the targeted industrial control systems, as well as supporting modules\nresponsible for command & control communication, persistence, and so on.\n\nIn addition to explaining why Industroyer can be considered the biggest threat to industrial\ncontrol systems since the infamous Stuxnet worm, we will take a look at the 2016 power\noutage in the context of the other numerous cyber attacks against Ukrainian critical\ninfrastructure in the recent years, some of which were covered in our previous Virus Bulletin\ntalks.\n\nWe will also assess the attackers' motivations and what this threat means to utilities around\nthe world. As the protocols and hardware targeted by Industroyer are employed in power\nsupply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure\nsystems, like water and gas, worldwide, the malware can be re-purposed to target vital\nservices in other countries. This discovery should serve as a wake-up call for those\nresponsible for the security of these critical systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oGE6xHEQyog\n\n**Anton Cherepanov**\n\nAnton Cherepanov graduated from the South Ural State University in 2009. Currently\nworking at ESET as a malware researcher, his responsibilities include the analysis of\ncomplex threats. His research has been presented at numerous conferences,\nincluding Virus Bulletin, CARO Workshop, PHDays, and ZeroNights. His interests\nfocus on IT security, reverse engineering and malware analysis automation.\n\n**Robert Lipovsky**\n\nRobert Lipovsky is Senior Malware Researcher in ESET's Security Research\nLaboratory, having worked for ESET since 2007. He is responsible for malware\nintelligence and research and leads the Malware Research team in Bratislava. He is a\nregular speaker at security conferences, including Virus Bulletin, EICAR, and CARO.\nHe runs a reverse engineering course at the Slovak University of Technology, his alma\nmater, and the Comenius University. When not bound to a keyboard, he enjoys sports,\nplaying guitar and flying an airplane.\n\nWe have placed cookies on your device in order to improve the functionality of this site, as\n[outlined in our cookies policy.
