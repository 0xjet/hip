To stay ahead of\nthese threats, security researchers must constantly monitor the landscape and identify new\nthreats as they emerge. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the findings of a recent\nstudy conducted by Zscaler's ThreatLabz team, which uncovered a new backdoor built\nusing Free Pascal that has the ability to steal data from infected systems. We'll explore the\ntechniques used by this malware, as well as the tactics employed by cybercriminals to\nentice users into downloading malicious payloads. By understanding these threats, we can\ntake steps to protect ourselves and our systems from the dangers of malware attacks.\n\n## Introduction\n\nZscaler ThreatLabz has recently unearthed a new backdoor called 'Devopt'. It utilizes hardcoded names for persistence and offers several functionalities, including keylogging,\nstealing browser credentials, clipper, and more. Multiple versions of the backdoor have\nsurfaced in just the last few days, indicating that it is still in development. In this blog post,\nwe will delve into the specifics of this new backdoor and its workings. Additionally, we will\noffer tips on how to safeguard yourself against such attacks.\n\n## Key Takeaways:\n\nZscaler ThreatLabz uncovered a new backdoor and named it DevOpt based on the\nname of the persistence malware\nDiscovered on a Russian website promising monetary rewards, victims are lured into\ndownloading malicious payloads containing DevOpt malware\nThe malware is currently still in development and is receiving continous improvement\nupdates designed to make it a more potent and effective tool for attackers and threat\nfor defenders\nDevOpt has advanced capabilities to function as a keylogger, stealer, grabber, and a\nclipper along with persistence mechanisms.\n\n## Campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile on the hunt for new malware, the ThreatLabz research team at Zscaler came across\na newly discovered backdoor that was created using Free Pascal. This backdoor is\nparticularly dangerous as it has the ability to steal data from infected systems.\n\nZscaler's ThreatLabz research team remains vigilant in tracking new malware threats.\nDuring a recent investigation, we discovered a backdoor that uses Free Pascal and is\ncapable of stealing data from infected systems. Additionally, we came across a Russian\nwebsite where users were offered financial rewards for completing a task that unwittingly\ninvolved downloading malware. Further analysis revealed that the downloaded malware\nhad an archive icon, giving the impression of a compressed file and luring users into\ndouble-clicking it, which then executed the malware. This discovery underscores the\nlengths to which cybercriminals will go to lure users into downloading malicious payloads,\nusing tactics such as offering financial incentives. It's worth noting that the malware's\ndownloading URL pattern generally follows this structure: wdfiles**download[.]siteme[.]org/arxiv[digit].exe.**\n\n_Fig 1. - Russian Website(Translated to english) enticing users into downloading malicious_\n_payloads._\n\n## Technical Analysis:\n\nTwo versions of the backdoor have been discovered in the development stage. The first\nversion, which lacks obfuscation to hide its strings, is roughly 20 MB in size and contains a\nGraphic User Interface not found in the newer variant, which is approximately 2 MB in size.\nThe second version uses encoded integer-based strings for its functionality.\n\nThe older version uses plain text HTTP protocol, while the newer variant searches for\nOpenSSH DLLs in the infected system to establish encrypted HTTPS connections to its\ncommand and control. To establish network connections, the backdoor requires several\n\n\n-----\n\nDLLs: libcrypto-1_1.dll, libeay32.dll, libssl-1_1.dll, libssl32.dll, and ssleay32.dll. If the\nmalware is unable to locate these DLLs, it becomes inactive and will not infect the system\nfurther.\n\n**Encoded String** **Decoded Strings** **Description**\n\n\n5494-4756-75446970-9430-82829348-9430-7544\n\n7544-5576-82829430-8774-95129102-9184-7544\n\n7544-5576-91028118-9594-89388282-9020-95129430-7544\n\n7544-5576-91029758-9020-88569102-7954-82009430-7544\n\n8200-8282-96769102-9184-95123444-3772-82829840-8282\n\n\nC:\\\\Users\\\\ String to\naccess\ninfected\nsystem Users\nDirectory\n\n\\\\Desktop\\\\ String to\naccess\ninfected\nsystem\nDesktop\nDirectory\n\n\\\\Documents\\\\ String to\naccess\ninfected\nsystem\nDocuments\nDirectory\n\n\\\\Downloads\\\\ String to\naccess\nInfected\nsystem\nDownloads\nDirectory\n\ndevopt*.exe Create a copy\nof itself in the\nStartup folder\nwith\ndevopt(random\n2 digit).exe\nname.\n\n\n-----\n\n7544-7134-86109020-8774-82829922-6068-82829512-3772-86109020-8610\n\n8528-9512-95129184-9430-47563854-3854-89389676-8200-36908774-3690-95129594-8856-79543772-9430-86109512-8282-89388282-3772-91029348-8446-3854\n\n7544-5330-91849184-5576-79549512-7954-75446724-9102-79548938-8610-90208446-7544-63148610-8118-93489102-9430-91028364-9512-75447134-8610-90208200-9102-97589430-7544-68069512-7954-93489512-2624-63148282-9020-95947544-6560-93489102-8446-93487954-8938-94307544-6806-95127954-9348-95129594-9184-7544\n\n\n\\\\WinkeyJet.ini Create\nconfiguration\nfile with\nWinkeyJet.ini\nname.\n\nhttps[:]//mvd-k-tula[.]siteme[.]org/ Command and\nControl\ndomain.\n\n\n\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start\nMenu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\\n\n\nStartup\ndirectory path.\n\n\n-----\n\n6314-9102-100048610-8856-88567954-3854-43463772-3936-26243280-7134-86109020-8200-91029758-9430-26246396-6888-26244428-3772-41004838-2624-93489676-4756-40183936-4264-37723936-3362-26245822-8282-81188774-9102-38544100-3936-40183936-3936-40183936-4018-26245740-8610-93488282-8364-91029840-3854-40183936-4264-3772-3936\n\n8856-8610-94309512-8282-90208282-9348-37729184-8528-9184\n\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; rv:104.0)\nGecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0\n\n\nUser Agent\nused for\nnetwork\nrequests.\n\n\nlistener.php Send collected\ndata as\nlistener.php\n\n\nThe earlier version of the backdoor required user interaction by clicking on the Extract\nbutton, whereas newer versions run silently in the background without any need for user\ninteraction.\n\n_Fig 2. - Earlier version of malware requiring user interaction_\n\nBased on the aforementioned observation, it can be concluded that the Threat Actor is\nadding more features to the backdoor and making it stealthier.\n\n## Additional Analysis:\n\nAfter analyzing the malware, our observations revealed that it contains numerous\ncapabilities. The following functionalities were observed:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistence:\n\nPersistence refers to a malware's capability to remain active on a system even after a\nreboot or shutdown. This can be achieved by adding entries to the Windows Registry or by\ncreating scheduled tasks. Once a malware establishes persistence, it can continue to\noperate in the background and carry out malicious activities undetected by the user.\n\nUpon closer observation, researchers noticed that the malware replicated itself in the\nStartup folder, enabling it to initiate automatically whenever the computer is powered on.\nFurther observations of different versions revealed that it duplicates itself with a name\n**devopt[random 2 digits].exe under the following path:**\n**C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup.**\n\n_Fig 3. - Persistence mechanism_\n\n### Clipper:\n\nA clipper malware is created to pilfer confidential data from victims. Once it is installed on a\nvictim's device, it can record the clipboard data, which can potentially be used to steal other\nsensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or other financial data.\n\nResearchers noticed that the malware generates a file called 'clippa.dan' in the C:\\User\\\n\n**[User] directory, which logs all the information copied to the clipboard.**\n\n_Fig 4. - Clipper logging data from the system_\n\n### Stealer:\n\nA stealer malware is created to pilfer sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit\ncard details, and other personal data. Once it is installed on a victim's device, it can monitor\nthe user's activity and steal sensitive information.\n\nThe malware generates two files, namely 'cdck.bin' and 'bdck.bin,' in the C:\\User\\[User]\ndirectory, which steal the credentials, cookies, history, and version information of the two\nspecific browsers, respectively.\n\n1. Chrome browser data collected from infected system:\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Network\\Cookies]\n\n\n-----\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\History]\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data]\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Last Version]\n\n2. Yandex data collected from infected system:\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User\nData\\Default\\Network\\Cookies]\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User\nData\\Default\\Network\\History]\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Ya\nPassman Data]\n\n[C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Ya Autofill\nData]\n\n### Keylogger:\n\nKeylogger malware is specifically designed to capture every keystroke made by a user on\ntheir device. This can be used to steal sensitive information like login credentials, credit\ncard details, and other personal data.\n\nIn this case, the malware creates a file named ‘Kebba.dan’ in the C:\\User\\[User] directory\nto log the keystrokes of the user.\n\n_Fig 5. - Keylogger logging keystrokes_\n\n### Grabber:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 6. - Grabber enumerating the Directories for stealing file contents_\n\nGrabber malware is created to illicitly obtain files and other data from an infected device. It\ntargets text, Word, Excel, and RTF files stored in the Document, Download, or Desktop\ndirectories, and saves the stolen data in a file named “grb.bin” located at C:\\User\\[User]\ndirectory.\n\n_Fig 7. - Grabber File contents stealing data_\n\n### Dropped text file\n\nIn previous versions of this backdoor, researchers observed that it drops a file called\n‘unpacked.dt’ in the ‘data’ folder of the current directory. This file is likely designed to\nconfuse malware analysts because it appears to be an encoded malicious payload, but in\nreality, it contains randomly generated alphanumeric strings. In newer versions of the\nbackdoor, a similar file named ‘0.txt’ is dropped in the current directory, which contains\nrandom strings that are hardcoded into the malware itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 8. - Generating random alphanumeric strings for unpacked.dt file_\n\n### Configuration File:\n\nThe researchers noted the presence of a configuration file named \"Winkeyjet.ini\" that was\ndropped in the Users directory. This file contains information about the compromised\nsystem, such as the name of the operating system, a unique Device_ID, and the version\nnumber (Version) that represents the major version information of the compromised\nsystem. Additionally, the file includes the malware's hardcoded own version (OwnVer). The\nconfiguration file also specifies the Command and Control (CnC) server, which is\nresponsible for providing instructions to the malware once it has been successfully installed.\n\n_Fig 9. - Configuration file generated recording the device and version information_\n\nAdditional investigation has uncovered that certain malwares that are still in the early stages\nof development are displaying a message box that contains the text \"putin Xyilo\", which is\na slogan that ridicules Russian President Vladimir Putin\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 10. - Msgbox displayed in underdeveloped versions of malware_\n\n## Network Communication:\n\nEstablishing a connection with the Command and Control (CnC) starts with the malware\nsending a \"create\" request. Upon recognizing the request, the CnC responds with a \"200\nOK\" message.\n\nAfter establishing the connection, the malware sends a command request to the CnC,\nwhich in turn responds with a SYNC command. Upon receiving the SYNC command, the\nmalware executes the given command and sends a \"SYNCRONIZED\" response back to the\nCnC to indicate successful completion.\n\n_Fig 11. - Network communication steps_\n\n## Commands:\n\nBelow are the encoded string commands used by the observed malware:\n\n\n**Encoded**\n**String**\n\n\n**Decoded**\n**Strings**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n6806729863965494\n\n557659866724\n\n656069706888\n\n6724565853305576\n\n5658721656585494\n\n5576672462326806\n\n6560672462326806\n\n\nSYNC Command to check connection between CnC and Malware. We\nobserved in some variants malware send the ‘SYNCRONIZED’\nresponse along with the version of the malware.\n\nDIR Command to collect file information of the given directory. It can\ncollect file name, directory name, size and modified date.\n\nPUT Command to write collected information in file. It will give the\nresponse ‘HAD WRITTEN’ if the file is already present else ‘NOT\nWRITTEN’.\n\nREAD Command to read collected information from stored files and\nsend data to CnC.\n\nEXEC To execute commands sent from CnC and after successful\nexecution it sends ‘EXECUTED’ response.\n\nDRLS Command to collect Drive information (HDD, CDROM,\nRAMDISK, Network and Removable) of the infected system.\n\nPRLS Command to collect the Process list of infected systems.\n\n\nThe previous version of the malware did not include the DRLS and PRLS commands for\ngathering drive and process information, respectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the observations made during the malware analysis, it is evident that the malware\nin question is a sophisticated and multifunctional threat. The malware is capable of\nperforming various malicious activities such as stealing confidential information, logging\nkeystrokes, stealing files, and establishing persistent access to the victim's system.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also evident that the threat actor behind the malware is continuously improving the\nmalware by adding new features, making it stealthier, and using various techniques to\nevade detection. The malware uses encoded strings for its commands and drops files with\nmisleading names to deceive malware analysts.\n\nFurthermore, the malware communicates with a Command and Control server to receive\ninstructions and send stolen data. The server's IP address and other details are hardcoded\ninto the malware.\n\nOverall, the findings highlight the need for robust security measures to protect against\nadvanced and evolving malware threats. It also emphasizes the importance of regular\nupdates and security patches to mitigate the risks associated with these threats.\n\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve and become increasingly complex, it is critical to remain\nalert and take proactive measures to protect against them. The discovery of this new\nbackdoor is a testament to the ever-changing tactics of attackers and underscores the\nimportance of ongoing monitoring and research. Zscaler's ThreatLabz team is dedicated to\nstaying on top of these threats and sharing their findings with the wider community. It is\nessential to stay informed and take necessary precautions to safeguard against malware\nattacks. Remember to keep your software up-to-date, use strong passwords, and be wary\nof suspicious emails or messages.\n\n## Zscaler Sandbox Coverage\n\nZscaler's multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators, as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 12. - DevOpt Backdoor Zscaler sandbox report_\n\nThe following threat names are detected by Zscaler's multilayered cloud security platform\nfor identifying malicious payloads:\n\n[Win32.Backdoor.DevOpt](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/d5c55da2-655c-47fb-a021-a4c70b14779b)\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\nExecution [T1129](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129/) Shared Modules\n\nDefense Evasion [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nPersistence [T1037.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005/)\n\nStartup Items\n\n[T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n\n-----\n\nDiscovery [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\nCollection [T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\n[T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115/)\n\nCredential Access [T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\n\n[T1555.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003/)\n\n[T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/)\n\n[T1056.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001/)\n\nCommand and Control [T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/)\n\n[T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/)\n\n\nProcess Discovery\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\nData from Local System\n\nClipboard Data\n\nOS Credential Dumping\n\nCredentials from Web Browsers\n\nSteal Web Session Cookie\n\nKeylogging\n\nNon-Application Layer Protocol\n\nApplication Layer Protocol\n\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):\n\ndb14d40d780853f80b93e21e92617680\n\n94df2e4aa0f432ef992893d7b994ce84\n\n391c894616dd0e8b372b801cbbc0a790\n\ne42198e7c0647238b999a2b2133daac2\n\nmvd-k-tula[.]siteme[.]org\n\nmvd-k-tula[.]ru\n\n\nOld Variant\n\nNew Variant\n\nCommand and Control Domain\n\n\nwdfiles-download[.]siteme[.]org/arxiv5.exe Malicious Source Url used for distribution\n\n\n-----",
