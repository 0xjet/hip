Later this foothold\nwas used to deploy the RYUK ransomware on the victim network.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis summer Truesec observed an attacker that used the tools and techniques of FIN7,\nincluding the CARBANAK RAT, to take over the network of an enterprise. In a subsequent\nattack almost six weeks later this foothold was used to deploy the RYUK ransomware on the\nvictim network.\n\nThis attack marks the first instance Truesec has observed of the combination of FIN7 tools\nand the RYUK ransomware, indicating a change in pattern for FIN7 attacks. Up until now\nFIN7 has not been associated with ransomware attacks. This also suggests a closer\ncollaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6,\nthan has been previously known by Truesec.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the RYUK group, but it is probable that FIN7 and\nWIZARD SPIDER are more closely affiliated and may be part of the same organized crime\nnetwork.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThreat actors are constantly evolving and changing their methods. FIN7 is a financially\nmotivated threat group that in the past has targeted the retail, restaurant, and hospitality\nsectors since mid-2015. They are known to use the CARBANAK RAT for mail-hijacking and\npoint-of-sale attacks.\n\nThis summer Truesec observed an attacker that used the tools and techniques of FIN7,\nincluding the CARBANAK RAT, to take over the network of an enterprise. Later this foothold\nwas used to deploy the RYUK ransomware on the victim network.\n\nThis attack marks the first instance Truesec has observed of the combination of FIN7 tools\nand the RYUK ransomware, indicating a change in pattern for FIN7 attacks. Up until now\nFIN7 has not been associated with ransomware attacks.\n\nGiven that ransomware is now the preferred technique for financially motivated attacks, it is\nnot surprising that FIN7 also switch to ransomware. The attack also indicates that FIN7 now\ncollaborates with the RYUK group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6, in financially\nmotivated attacks.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Stage 1 – The Phishing\n\nThe first part of the attack was a phishing email claiming to be from UPS.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 - phishing mail_\nThe link in the email redirected the victim to a SharePoint URL that downloads a ZIP file,\n“Data .zip”, which included a VBS script in the archive, which in turn dropped another script\nthat launched a JavaScript backdoor on the victim machine. Using a VBS script to drop\n[JavaScript is a known method used by FIN7 and similar groups.](https://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-not-finished-morphisec-spots-new-campaign)\n\n## Stage 2 – The Take Over\n\n**JavaScript backdoor**\n\n\n-----\n\n[This appears to be the same as the JavaScript backdoor in an article by Morphisec from](https://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-not-finished-morphisec-spots-new-campaign)\nNovember 2018. As described in the article this was used by FIN7 to deploy the CARBANAK\nRAT.\n\nThe backdoor connected to domain sephardimension[.]com. Some of the functions of the\nJavaScript backdoor are illustrated below.\n\n_Figure 2 – Part of JavaScript backdoor_\n\n_Figure 3 – Part of JavaScript backdoor_\n\n_Figure_\n\n_4 – Part of JavaScript backdoor_\n[These functions are clearly later versions of the code illustrated in the article by Morphisec.](https://blog.morphisec.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_images/18-Q4/FIN7-11.png?width=600&name=FIN7-11.png)\n\nFrom the JavaScript backdoor on the compromised client, the threat actor began performing\ntypical escalation attempts in the Active Directory.\n\n## PowerShell RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the attacker had ensured they had admin privileges, they launched RunPsExec against\nseveral clients and servers to install a second malicious code, a PowerShell RAT, previously\nunknown to Truesec. The PowerShell RAT connected to another malicious domain:\nhxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate.\n\nThe PowerShell RAT includes functions to retrieve basic system information and provides\ncapabilities to start and manage arbitrary commands as background jobs.\n\nThe different functions are illustrated below.\n\n_Figure 5 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n_7 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n_Figure_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n_Figure 9 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n**CARBANAK RAT**\n\nThe last action the attacker performed at this stage was to also install the CARBANAK RAT\nas an additional backdoor onto domain controllers of the victim network. The attacker\ndownloaded an obfuscated script that when executed, loads a DLL file in memory and\nexecutes it through reflection methods.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 - Decompressed script_\nIt then connects to Command-and-Control server 170.130.55[.]85:443 in order to download\n[the malware configuration file anunak_config which is a known component of the](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/new-carbanak-anunak-attack-methodology/)\nCARBANAK RAT. Once the CARBANAK RAT was installed, it would beacon to the same C2\nserver.\n\nOnce the actor had deployed the PowerShell RAT and CARBANAK RAT, no further action\nwas taken on the compromised network for several weeks.\n\n## Stage 3 – The Reconnaissance\n\n**Cobalt Strike**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third stage of the attack began several weeks after the initial compromise and lasted\nabout a week. The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike on the network and began\nreconnaissance and data discovery on the network. This part of the attack was conducted\nfrom a completely different infrastructure than the first two stages.\n\n**Data Theft**\n\nDuring this stage, the attacker also exfiltrated data from the victim network. The exfiltration\nwas done using the SmartFTP Client that connected to an IP address controlled by the\nattacker.\n\nThe names of some of the files that were exfiltrated were found in the file “Unlocker-List.txt”.\nThis file is part of the IObit Unlocker software, installed by the attacker, likely to facilitate the\nransomware execution or file copy operations by unlocking locked files.\n\n## Stage 4 – The Ransomware\n\n RYUK Ransomware\n\nA week after the attacker had begun reconnaissance of the network and exfiltrated the data\nthey wanted; they deployed the RYUK ransomware. The Ransomware was deployed using\nboth manual and scripted methods.\n\nThe high-level description of the staging procedure is summarized below:\n\n1. Identify server hostnames and IP addresses in the domain\n2. Prepare batch file to disable protections and security software (kill.bat)\n3. Prepare RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n4. Copy kill.bat\n5. Disable User Account Control\n6. Run kill.bat\n7. Copy RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n8. Run RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n\nSteps 4-8 were performed on all identified servers in the victim network, using both IP\naddress and hostname. Remote code execution was achieved with two methods: remote\nWMI command execution and using Microsoft Sysinternals’ utility PsExec.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe first two stages of the attack, when the attacker took over the network, clearly bears the\nmark of the criminal threat actor known as FIN7. Both the JavaScript backdoor and the way it\nwas installed, and CARBANAK RAT are tools that have been attributed to FIN7. No attempt\n\n\n-----\n\nto identify resources in the network was made at this time, once the attacker had control of\nthe network.\n\nThe subsequent stages, in which data was stolen and a ransomware was deployed,\noccurred almost six weeks after the initial compromise. This part of the attack was done\n[using tools and techniques that are indicative of the RYUK ransomware group, also known](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0446/)\nas WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6. This was also conducted from an entirely different\ninfrastructure than the initial stages attributed to FIN7.\n\nThe progress of the attack clearly indicates that different stages of the attack were conducted\nby different teams. It’s possible that the FIN7 group are now more focused on just gaining\naccess and then let a team from the RYUK group take over and deploy ransomware.\n\nThis suggests a closer collaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group than has been\npreviously known by Truesec. It is possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the RYUK group,\nbut it is probable that the two groups have even stronger ties. The RYUK group are known to\n[contract affiliates to gain foothold for their ransomware attacks.](https://intel471.com/blog/ransomware-as-a-service-2020-ryuk-maze-revil-egregor-doppelpaymer/)\n\nIt consequently seems possible that FIN7 and WIZARD SPIDER are now both part of the\nsame sprawling organized crime network.\n\n## Appendix - IOC\n\n**domains**\n\ndmnadmin[.]com\n\nsendbits.m2stor4ge[.]xyz\n\nmyrric-uses.singlejets[.]com\n\nbesaintegration[.]com\n\nsephardimension[.]com\n\n**IP addresses**\n\n45.11.180.14\n\n45.11.180.76\n\n45.11.180.83\n\n45.91.93.89\n\n46.166.161.104\n\n\n-----\n\n46.166.161.159\n\n170.130.55.85\n\n185.163.45.185\n\n185.212.44.231\n\n185.212.47.100\n\n193.178.169.203\n\n194.76.225.76\n\n194.76.225.77\n\n194.76.225.78\n\n194.76.225.79\n\n194.76.226.202\n\n195.2.93.17\n\n**MD5 hashes**\n\n10AA7B8AB8D0D1C650FFFE01AFB90CEE\n\n19ADFCD1E2B02D655531CE53B39CDD79\n\n166686D538EC9A0E0550347149AAC4CC\n\nBDED054D3176EEFEEDB4470DF9EE4716\n\nD1092764732C9A9B88AAAD727D1D4F94\n\n9836248A42FF7FA89AE8D6D849D361F7\n\nBA86E99056C33A4B64B08DADE708B041\n\n0C392BC26565BDD41B7A663EFD60BF0C\n\n1643B85E7F459C6FFE1E5AB9EBB53F93\n\nC1BE2260C7673096D8F083AE69DFF5D0\n\n**SHA256 hashes**\n\nFCAAF4B85C42BEC0426CE7A827F437C3CF0E2C502A393DD8C3C327F035FE1A2C\n\n\n-----\n\n1BBE96A888C6E3A52CDB0676F38A8A379A72E6F4ADE58F101A0559C7AD6F99C7\n\n53430ABD76A5CFCFADA4962CD8925B2E32620C44A8863B445BA145F42DBFEA64\n\nB49CA670CD9CEF54A5F372375BD6CA1BE7B68FD68535D6498374970CD69AAAE2\n\nD9A6DD7216FAAFC65D419D09B6B7B5DDF24991A1F65F23113DDE40D4936EEA55\n\n992785A27987A99B2B1EE0475457A0E548F5DD704429C3528C335C315FF089F5\n\n363775EC196DC5F5C435068B4237C42C2038BD15EF40FD453FA1F49C827BDAF2\n\n8141F47A1EE8453AC01DAACB16CAB2D18B37A9045EDC5F20C9019D4327576704\n\nA428716A6891C67CD70DD17769158060298B431F06A483A1E34D58D71F2B34DB\n\nThis is an analysis of part of the network of Russian organized crime hacking groups is\nwritten by Threat Intelligence Lead Mattias Wåhlén.\n\nMattias Wåhlén’s task is to lead and further develop Truesec’s Threat Intelligence\ncapabilities for anticipating data breaches and averting threats.
