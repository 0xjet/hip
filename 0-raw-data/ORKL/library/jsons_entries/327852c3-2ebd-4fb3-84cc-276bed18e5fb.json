This data enables\nus to identify associated elements,\nincluding the geolocation of the botnet\nC&Cs, the malware associated with\nthem, the top-level domains used when\nregistering a domain for a botnet C&C,\nthe sponsoring registrars and the network\nhosting the botnet C&C infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Spotlight\n## Despite the duck’s demise,  Pikabot and DarkGate thrive!\n\n[It’s been nearly six months since the Qakbot takedown,](https://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/819/qakbot-the-takedown-and-the-remediation)\ninvolving an internationally coordinated effort led by\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). With the\ninfamous malware’s infrastructure finally dismantled,\nwe all took a sigh of relief. Albeit, this was short-lived.\n[Two other malware threats - Pikabot and DarkGate -](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.pikabot)\nquickly emerged as new adversary favorites.\n\n\n### How do these threats work?\n\n\nPikabot is a backdoor, while DarkGate is a Remote\nAccess Trojan (RAT) primarily acting as a downloader.\nBut they have one thing in common - the ability to\ndownload, and execute, additional payloads to the\ninfected machine. It’s for this reason miscreants choose\nthese malware families to deliver malicious files to their\nvictims. A feature that would appeal to those whose\npreference was previously Qakbot.\n\n\n-----\n\n### TR Group picks Pikabot\n\n\n[For the notorious Conti hacker group affiliate,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware))\n[TR (TA577), Pikabot has become the preferred malware.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/ta577)\nFor several months, Spamhaus researchers have\nobserved a significant increase in spam from the\nTR group, occurring multiple times per week. So it\ncomes as no surprise to see Pikabot enter this report\nas a Top 10 malware associated with botnet command\nand controllers (C&Cs). So what’s driving this change?\n\nIt is safe to assume this change in TR’s behaviour is\nconnected to the Qakbot takedown, forcing this hacker\ngroup to switch tactics. DarkGate filled the void for a\nbrief period before finally settling on Pikabot to conduct\ntheir weekly malicious campaigns.\n\n\n### Will Pikabot remain TR’s default loader?\n\n\nFor the moment, it appears that way. Given its\nrobustness and complexity, this malware is undoubtedly\na top candidate for Qakbot’s successor. Even so,\nlet’s hope its reign is brief!\n\nSpamhaus researchers will continue to monitor insights\nregarding these malware’s activities - keep an eye on our\nsocial media for updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Number of botnet C&Cs observed,  Q4 2023\n\nIn Q4 2023, Spamhaus identified 8,174 botnet C&Cs\ncompared to 7,052 in Q3 2023. This was a +16% increase\nquarter on quarter. The monthly average increased from\n\n**What are botnet command**\n\n2,351 in Q3 to 2,725 botnet C&Cs per month in Q4 2023.\n\n**& controllers?**\n\nA ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or\n\n**Quarter** **No. of Botnets** **Quarterly Average** **% Change** ‘botnet command & control’ server\n\nQ1 2023 8,358 2,786 +23% is commonly abbreviated to ‘botnet\n\nC&C.’ Fraudsters use these to both\n\nQ2 2023 8,438 2,813 +1% control malware-infected machines\n\nQ3 2023 7,052 2,351 -16% and extract personal and valuable\n\ndata from malware-infected victims.\n\nQ4 2023 8,174 2,725 +16%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Geolocation of botnet C&Cs,  Q4 2023\n\n### China strengthens its position \n\nChina remains in pole position, having knocked The U.S.A.\noff the top spot in Q3. In Q4, the number of botnets\nhosted in the country continued to increase by a further\n35% to 2,125, showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n\n### The botnet superpowers return\n\n\nAlongside China, The U.S.A., and Russia take the lead\nwith significant percentage increases in botnet C&Cs 27% and 39%, respectively. However, the award for the most\nsignificant growth in Q4 goes to Bulgaria, with a whopping\n227% increase, disappointing after the previous -44%\ndecrease in Q3.\n\n\n### Increases across the globe\n\n\nIn contrast to Q3, most geolocations experienced an\nincrease in the number of botnet C&Cs, that is except\nfor India (-44%), Canada (-41%), Mexico (-39%), United\nKingdom (-21%) and Uruguay (-6%).\n\nMeanwhile, South Africa and Switzerland departed from\nthe Top 20.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Geolocation of botnet C&Cs, Q4 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Top 20 locations of botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Country** **Q3** **Q4** **% Change**\n**2023** **2023** **Q on Q**\n\n**#1** China 1570 2125 35%\n\n**#2** United States 1267 1606 27%\n\n**#3** Russia 441 612 39%\n\n**#4** Netherlands 542 603 11%\n\n**#5** Germany 378 478 26%\n\n**#6** France 242 322 33%\n\n**#7** Bulgaria 64 209 227%\n\n**#8** Singapore 164 190 16%\n\n**#9** United Kingdom 221 175 -21%\n\n**#10** Uruguay 170 160 -6%\n\n\n**Rank** **Country** **Q3** **Q4** **% Change**\n**2023** **2023** **Q on Q**\n\n**#11** Saudi Arabia 153 159 4%\n\n**#12** Mexico 232 141 -39%\n\n**#13** Japan 70 111 59%\n\n**#14** Finland 78 102 31%\n\n**#15** Canada 157 92 -41%\n\n**#16** Poland - 90 New entry\n\n**#16** Sweden 69 80 16%\n\n**#18** Korea (Rep. of) 73 74 1%\n\n**#19** India 123 69 -44%\n\n**#20** Turkey - 55 New entry\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs, Q4 2023\n\n### Cobalt Strike is on the rise\n\nAfter entering its sixth quarter as the malware associated\nwith the largest number of botnet C&Cs, Cobalt Strike\n\n**What is Cobalt Strike?**\n\nmaintained its usual form in Q4, with a 26% increase.\n\nCobalt Strike is a legitimate\n\nThe penetration testing tool is now associated with over\n\ncommercial penetration testing tool\n\nfour times more botnet C&Cs than its closest competitor,\n\nthat allows an attacker to deploy\n\nAsyncRat, at number two. an “agent” on a victim’s machine.\n\n\n### QuasarRAT climbs the charts\n\n\nSpeaking of Remote Access Tools – QuasarRAT\nexperienced a significant increase (341%), moving this\nmalware’s rank from #12 to #5 in Q4. This comes as\nno surprise, considering that it is an open-source tool;\nanyone can set up a server and use it.\n\n### Penetration testing tools prevail\n\nIn Q2 and Q3, Spamhaus researchers observed an\nincrease in the number of botnet C&Cs associated\nwith legitimate, but abused penetration testing\ntools. In Q4, this trend continued with increases from\n42.9% to 49.7%, meaning these penetration testing tools\naccounted for almost 50% of malware associated with\nbotnet C&Cs in the Top 20.\n\n### Pika who?\n\nQ4 saw six new malware entrants, including Pikabot\nat #10, associated with 198 botnet C&Cs. First seen in\n2023, this backdoor malware contains several methods\nto avoid sandboxes, virtual machines, and other\ndebugging techniques.\n\nSpamhaus researchers have also observed that Pikabot\nappears to be the malware of choice for the well-known\nthreat actor TA577, also known as TR.\n\n### The resurrection of Qakbot\n\nFollowing the takedown of Qakbot in August 2023, and\nas forecasted in the Q3 report, this malware has now\ndropped completely from the Top 20. However, it may be\ntoo early to celebrate, given that Spamhaus researchers\nhave detected low-volume Qakbot campaigns targeting\nspecific business sectors seemingly ‘testing the waters’.\n\nWe did say anything is possible in this industry - let’s hope\nthis isn’t the resurrection of Qakbot!\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,  Q4 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Malware families associated with botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Q3 2023** **Q4 2023** **% Change** **Malware Family** **Description**\n\n**#1** 2491 3137 26% Cobalt Strike Pentest Framework\n\n**#2** 373 710 90% AsyncRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#3** 285 515 81% Sliver Pentest Framework\n\n**#4** 646 513 -21% Flubot Android Backdoor\n\n**#5** 75 331 341% QuasarRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#6** 341 329 -4% Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#7** 273 286 5% RedLineStealer Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#8** 197 229 16% DCRat Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#9** - 223 New entry Hook Android Backdoor\n\n**#10** - 198 New entry Pikabot Backdoor\n\n**#11** - 181 New entry FakeUpdates Loader/downloader\n\n**#12** 797 145 -82% Qakbot Backdoor\n\n**#13** 186 111 -40% IcedID Credential Stealer\n\n**#14** - 88 New entry Meterpreter Backdoor\n\n**#15** 89 78 -12% NjRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#16** 63 77 22% Havoc Backdoor\n\n**#17** - 66 New entry BianLian Ransomware\n\n**#18** - 49 New entry Lumma Credential Stealer\n\n**#19** 53 45 -15% Rhadamanthys Credential Stealer\n\n**#20** 269 42 -84% RecordBreaker Credential Stealer\n\n\n**0** **1000** **2000** **3000** **4000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware type comparisons between  Q3 2023 and Q4 2023\n\nLoader/ 0.00%\nDownloader 2.46%\n\n0.00%\n\nRansomware\n\n0.90%\n\n42.90%\n\nPentest Framework\n\n13.29%\n\nBackdoor\n\n6.91%\n\nRemote Access 23.15%\nTrojan (RAT) 26.70%\n\n9.98%\n\nAndroid Backdoor\n\n10.01%\n\n9.61%\n\nCredential Stealer\n\n3.36%\n\n1.07%\n\nSpambot\n\n0.00%\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%**\n\nQ3 2023 Q4 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q4 2023\n\n### Interpreting the data  \n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains have\ngreater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q4 2023,\n**.com had more than 157m domains, of which 0.00076%**\n\n**a brief overview**\n\nwere associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .pw\nhad approximately 17k domains, of which 0.959% were\nassociated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top three\n\n**Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\n\nof our listings.

This is three times the amount of\n.hair at 0.33% - the second highest TLD exposed to abuse,\nbased on percentage of active zone files.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens with ccTLDs that are\n[repurposed to what are effectively gTLDS – see Q3 Botnet](https://info.spamhaus.com/botnet-threat-updates)\n[Threat Update. To find their way out of the Top 20, the](https://info.spamhaus.com/botnet-threat-updates)\ndomain registry responsible needs to get a handle on\nregistrations for this TLD, as abuse is prevalent.\n\n### Increases for .org\n\nFor the first time since Q3 2022, the gTLDs .org and .info\nboth ranked in the top 10 most abused TLDs. Moreover,\nthe number of newly registered botnet C&C domains\nobserved on .org increased by 157%, from 35 to 90.\n\n### New entry at #3 for .xyz \n\nIn Q4, .xyz jumped straight back to third position,\nfollowing a short break from the Top 20.
