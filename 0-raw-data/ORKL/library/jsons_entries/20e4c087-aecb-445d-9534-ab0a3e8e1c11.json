We’ll look at WMI and\nScheduled Tasks individually to discuss why, how, and what type of adversaries use them for\nlateral movement. Finally, we’ll explore questions to consider when detecting and\ninvestigating these intrusions over the network.\n\nAs with several other tools, WMI (wmic.exe) and Scheduled Tasks (schtasks.exe)\nexecutables are part of a collection of binaries often referred to as LOLBINS, or Living off the\nLand Binaries and Scripts. These are programs or scripts that an adversary can, with\nrelatively high reliability, expect to be present on a Windows-based system.\n\nWMI and Scheduled Tasks are also commonly used by administrators and third-party vendor\nsolutions (such as configuration management or system monitoring) that generate significant\ntraffic in the environment and allow adversary activity to blend in with “normal” operations. To\ndemonstrate the volume of such activity, Gigamon ATR observes hundreds of thousands (for\nScheduled Tasks) or millions (for WMI) of monitored events per day across environments.\n\nFinally, both tools offer flexibility of use, allowing for credentials to be passed, to be run under\nspecific user contexts, or executed with user-defined commands. Given their accessibility,\nability to blend in with benign activity, and flexibility, WMI and Scheduled Tasks make for\neffective go-to tools for lateral movement by adversaries.\n\nWe can see from existing industry research that the use of WMI and Scheduled Tasks is\ncommon across a range of threat actors, from ransomware to advanced persistent threats\n(APTs). In the case of ransomware, recent leaks from the Conti ransomware affiliates identify\n[both WMI and Scheduled Tasks used for lateral movement. Industry reporting on APT41 and](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Dark Halo indicate use of WMI and Scheduled Tasks, respectively, for lateral movement.](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nWhen looking at how threat actors are using these tools in lateral movement, we see that it’s\nprimarily an execution method, with the item being executed varying.\n\nWMI is often used by calling the wmic.exe binary directly; however, several tools exist for\noffensive use of WMI, such as [Invoke-WMIexec,](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash) [WMIexec.py,](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) [SharpWMI, and the built-in](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpWMI)\n[WMI functions for frameworks like Cobalt Strike. ATR research finds that regardless of the](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\ntool, the functionality over the network tends to remain the same. Irrespective of the tool\nused to execute WMI, adversaries seek to execute a payload on the remote host, typically an\nexecutable or script created by the attacker that initiates a connection to command and\ncontrol (C2) infrastructure. In some instances, instead of a payload, a command such as a\nPowerShell “one-liner” is used to initiate the connection to attacker C2. Below is an example\nof WMI use with wmic.exe:\n```\nwmic /node:<remote IP/Hostname> process call create \"<command>\"\n\n```\n_Figure 1: Remote command execution wmic usage example._\n\nThe /node switch allows targeting of a remote host, and the process class with the call verb\nfor the create method allows for the execution of the passed command. Wmic will run under\nthe current user context unless the /USER and /PASSWORD switches are used.\n\nScheduled Tasks use is similar but more elaborate due to the nature of Scheduled Tasks.\nSpecifically, a task needs to be created or registered, then run and “cleaned up” (deleted) if\nthe attacker wants to remove obvious traces of activity. While a limited selection of third-party\ntools exists for Scheduled Tasks, calling the schtasks.exe application directly is the\npredominant method for adversaries. Example usage of creating or registering, running, then\ndeleting a task is provided below:\n```\nschtasks /s <hostname/IP> /RU \"SYSTEM\" /create /tn \"<task name>\" /tr \"\n<command/payload to execute>\" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/1970 /st 00:00\nschtasks /s <hostname/IP> /run /TN \"<task name>\"\nschtasks /S <hostname/IP> /TN \"<task name>\" /DELETE /F\nschtasks /S <hostname/IP> /TN \"<task name>\" /DELETE /F\n\n```\n_Figure 2: Sanitized schtasks example found in Conti leaks._\n\nSchtasks is often run with the /RU switch to define what context to run the task under. This\ncan be used to run under the system context, which is a high privilege on the host. However,\nthe option to run as a particular user is also available with the /U and /P switches for user\nand password respectively.\n\nWhen used for lateral movement, Scheduled Tasks creates a common pattern of execution\n(create, run, delete). Note that the delete action doesn’t necessarily need to be done\nremotely; it can be done locally on the newly compromised host once it establishes the\nconnection to the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detection and Investigation\n\nWhile many might immediately look to host-based detection methods to identify the use of\nWMI and Scheduled Tasks, the network should not be overlooked. Lateral movement\nnaturally occurs over the network from one host to another and therefore exhibits network\nactivity from both hosts for defenders and investigators to consider.\n\n**WMI**\n\nWhen detecting the use of WMI, as described above, over the network we need to\nunderstand what traffic to focus on. WMI primarily leverages the DCE RPC protocol and,\nfrom ATR’s research, uses IWbemServices endpoint for the ExecMethod operation when\nused for remote command execution as described. Unfortunately, the presence of the\nExecMethod operation on its own is not an indication of malicious activity, as this operation is\nconducted by several benign sources, such as administrator activity and configuration\nmanagement solutions. The context surrounding the ExecMethod is therefore important in\ndetermining if lateral movement could have occurred.\n\nAs previously mentioned, we see adversaries executing a payload of some kind when\nlaterally moving with WMI. This payload would need to be present on the remote target host\nprior to the execution for it to be successful. Therefore, the adversary must upload a payload\nvia SMB from an already compromised host to the target host before the execution of WMI.\nOnce the adversary executes the payload with WMI, we expect to see a connection to a\nlikely external C2 destination. This host may be the same destination that the host initiating\nthe lateral movement was already communicating with, a common C2 server. When forming\nthis context around the ExecMethod, a sequential procedure becomes clear:\n\n1. Host A uses SMB to upload a payload to Host B, which is the target of the lateral\n\nmovement\n2. Host A then executes the payload remotely via WMI, issuing an RPC ExecMethod\n\noperation\n3. Host B initiates a connection to an external destination that Host A was also\n\ncommunicating with (a shared destination between the two hosts)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: WMI_\n\n_lateral movement procedural steps._\nA common variation would be to forgo the use of a payload and execute a command, using\nWMI, to establish a connection to the C2 server. In this case, we still expect to see a shared\ndestination following the WMI execution, as seen in Figure 3:\n\n1. Host A executes a command via WMI on Host B, issuing an RPC ExecMethod\n\noperation\n2. Host B initiates a connection to an external destination that Host A was also\n\ncommunicating with (a shared destination between the two hosts)\n\n**Scheduled Tasks**\n\nScheduled Tasks-based lateral movement can be easier to identify compared to WMI\nbecause it’s less commonly used in a remote communication setting and requires a greater\nnumber of operations to execute the movement. As indicated previously, when using\nScheduled Tasks for lateral movement, a series of operations are conducted in a pattern for\ntypical scenarios. Like WMI, Scheduled Tasks uses DCE RPC for remote execution with the\nITaskSchedulerService endpoint called along with the following operations:\n\nSchRpcRegisterTask (Create/Register/Modify task)\nSchRpcRun (Run task)\n\nIn addition to these essential operations, the following might also be present but are not\nrequired to successfully complete a movement:\n\nSchRpcGetTaskInfo (Get a particular task’s details)\n\n\n-----\n\nSchRpcRetrieveTask (Retrieve a list of tasks)\nSchRpcDelete (Delete a task)\n\nAttackers might query tasks before or after a movement attempt and, as part of cleaning up\ntheir tracks, delete the task they created. However, the task deletion could also occur locally\non the newly compromised host and doesn’t need to be done remotely.\n\nThe execution of a particular pattern of Scheduled Task operations is not a sure sign of\nlateral movement. To better determine if lateral movement occurred, we would want to look\nat the context surrounding the Scheduled Task operations. As with WMI, Scheduled Tasks is\nused to execute a payload or command on a remote system. The adversary must upload the\npayload to the host prior to execution. As noted earlier, we determined SMB is the most\ncommon method to accomplish file transfer. Once the payload is executed, we expect to see\nthe same “shared destination” artifact between the two hosts involved to be present in the\nnetwork activity. Given this, Scheduled Task-based lateral movement follows these steps:\n\n1. Attacker on Host A uploads a payload to Host B via SMB, which will be the target of the\n\nlateral movement\n2. Attacker on Host A remotely creates a task on Host B to execute their payload or\n\ncommand, calling the SchRpcRegisterTask operation\n3. Attacker on Host A remotely runs the newly created task on Host B calling the\n\nSchRpcRun operation\n4. Host B initiates a connection to an address/host that Host A was also communicating\n\nwith (a shared C2 destination between the two hosts)\n5. (Optional) Attacker on Host A remotely deletes the created task on Host B calling the\n\nSchRpcDelete operation\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Scheduled Tasks lateral movement procedural steps._\nWhile, as the name implies, Scheduled Tasks are usually scheduled for a certain time, ATR\nresearch finds that it’s common for adversaries to run the task immediately to avoid waiting\nfor the configured schedule.\n\nA less common but potential variation would be to modify an existing task to run the payload\nor command of the adversary’s choice, then revert the modification to avoid detection.\n\n1. Adversary on Host A remotely lists and checks the details of various tasks already\n\nregistered on Host B, calling the SchRpcRetrieveTask and SchRpcGetTaskInfo\noperations.\n2. Adversary on Host A remotely modifies an identified viable task to execute their\n\npayload or command on Host B, calling the SchRpcRegisterTask operation\n3. Adversary on Host A remotely runs the modified task on Host B calling the SchRpcRun\n\noperation\n4. Host B initiates a connection to an address/host that Host A was also communicating\n\nwith (a shared destination between the two hosts)\n5. (Optional) Adversary on Host A remotely reverts the modified task on Host B calling the\n\nSchRpcRegisterTask operation again\n\n## Follow-Up\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen investigating either WMI or Scheduled Task lateral movement, some follow-up\nquestions should be asked:\n\nWhat type of system and role does Host A have in the environment, and should it be\nconducting this activity?\nWhat file was copied over? Was it an executable file type?\nWas the shared destination an IP address or a hostname? What intelligence do you\nhave on it?\nWhat account was used to authenticate to Host B? What privileges does it hold?\nShould it be used in this context?\nWhat type of authentication was observed? NTLM? Kerberos? (Could imply a particular\nway the tooling was used.)\nWhat time of day was the activity, and is that normal for the hosts and users involved?\n\nAdditionally, there is the historical context of the involved hosts to consider, if possible:\n\nHas Host A been executing the WMI/Scheduled Task-related operations regularly in the\npast? With other hosts?\nDoes the user that authenticated to Host B have a history with that host?\nHave the two hosts previously interacted in the past? Was/is there an expectation for\nthem to interact?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOnce an adversary gains access to an environment, lateral movement becomes a necessary\nand frequent activity in the attack lifecycle. Every lateral movement execution becomes an\nopportunity for the Blue Team to detect, investigate, and respond to the threat. Within lateral\nmovement, various adversaries use Scheduled Tasks and WMI, from ransomware affiliates\nto APT actors.\n\nThese entities will continue to leverage such techniques because of their availability and the\nflexibility they provide. When it comes to detecting malicious use of WMI or Scheduled\nTasks, it’s not as straightforward as identifying the right RPC call. However, if we take into\nconsideration how adversaries use these methods and the context around their behavior, we\nbegin to identify clearer detection opportunities and natural investigation follow-up.\n\n**Featured Webinars**\n\n[Hear from our experts on the latest trends and best practices to optimize your network](https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/webinar-hub.html?intcid=blog)\nvisibility and analysis.\n\nCONTINUE THE DISCUSSION\n\n\n-----\n\nPeople are talking about this in the Gigamon Community s [Security group.](https://community.gigamon.com/gigamoncp/s/group/0F91O0000009cNHSAY/security)\n\n**Share your thoughts today**\n\n## RELATED CONTENT\n\nREPORT\n\n2022 Ransomware Defense Report\n\nGET YOUR COPY\n\nWEBINAR\n\nThreatINSIGHT: Eliminating Adversaries’ Dwell Time Advantage\n\nWATCH ON DEMAND\n\nWEBINAR\n\nDeep Dive INSIGHTS: Fighting Ransomware and Shifting Security Priorities\n\nWATCH ON DEMAND\n\nREPORT\n\nGigamon ThreatINSIGHT Guided-SaaS Network Detection and Response\n\nGET YOUR COPY\n\nOLDER ARTICLE\n\nPartner Spotlight: Gigamon and Mission Critical Systems Team Up to Help Customers Fortify\nTheir Networks\nNEWER ARTICLE\n\n[Enhance Logging to Meet M21-31 Requirements](https://blog.gigamon.com/2022/02/08/enhance-logging-to-meet-m21-31-requirements/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
