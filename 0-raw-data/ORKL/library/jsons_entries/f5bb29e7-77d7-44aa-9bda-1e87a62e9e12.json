    "plain_text": "# Trump’s Worst, Most Bizarre Statements About ‘the Cyber’\n\n**[wired.com/story/trump-cyber-worst-quotes-statements-hackers-ukraine-russia/](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-cyber-worst-quotes-statements-hackers-ukraine-russia/)**\n\nAndy Greenberg January 18, 2021\n\nIn September of 2016, on a Hofstra University debate stage, journalist Lester Holt asked\npresidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump how they'd improve American\n[cybersecurity. When it came Trump's turn to answer, he](https://www.wired.com/category/security/) [let loose a torrent of barely](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/26/13065174/first-presidential-debate-live-transcript-clinton-trump)\n[connected ideas about \"the cyber.\" The stream of consciousness started with how many](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/trump-finally-says-something-coherent-cyber/)\nadmirals had endorsed him, reiterated his long-running theme that no one could prove\n[Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee, noted cryptically that \"we came in](https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-lawsuit-reveals-key-details-2016-hack/)\nwith an internet, we came up with the internet,\" touched on ISIS \"beating us at our own\ngame,\" and finally ended with these words:\n\n\"I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's\nunbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly do-able.\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.\"\n\nIn that moment, it became clear to cybersecurity professionals around the world that, should\nthis man obtain the most powerful office in America, the next several years of politics were\ngoing to be very painful to listen to.\n\nIndeed, while Trump has gained a deserved reputation as the most dishonest president in\nAmerican history on a multitude of topics, few have inspired as much disinformation from him\nas “the cyber.” And no other issue, perhaps, has provided the confluence of factors to\n\n\n-----\n\nproduce facepalming Trumpisms at such a high rate: complexity, ignorance of technical\nissues, and blatant conflicts of interest.\n\n[As Trump's term—and his Twitter feed—come to a close, these are the abysmal](https://www.wired.com/story/tweets-got-trump-banned-far-from-worst/)\ncybersecurity assertions and quotes that will resonate for years to come.\n\nThe DNC Hacked Itself\n\nTrump's first major statement on cybersecurity as a presidential candidate was also one of\nhis most absurd. In June 2016, The Washington Post [broke the news that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html) Russian hackers\nhad penetrated the Democratic National Committee and stolen information that included the\nDNC's opposition research files on Trump. Security firm CrowdStrike, which had been\nhelping the DNC defend against and respond to the hackers, quickly attributed the breach to\ntwo Russian hacking groups known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.\n\nYet within 24 hours, Trump had released a statement to the press with his own baseless\nanalysis: \"We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the\nmany issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.\" He added another\njab related to Clinton's private email server, whose deleted messages were still being\ninvestigated by the FBI: \"Too bad the DNC doesn’t hack Crooked Hillary’s 33,000 missing\nemails.” (These missing emails would become another leitmotif for Trump: He would later\nclaim in a presidential debate and beyond that Clinton had \"acid-washed\" or \"bleached\" the\nemails to destroy them and hide them from investigators. In fact, her IT staff had used the\nopen-source deletion tool BitBleach to delete her non-work-related emails from the server,\nmonths before the FBI asked her to preserve them.)\n\n‘Russia, If You're Listening’\n\nLess than six weeks after accusing the DNC of hacking itself, Trump's rhetoric swung in the\n[opposite direction: He actively asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and leak her emails.](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/trump-invites-russian-cyber-spying-unprecedented-remarks/)\n\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I\nthink you'll be rewarded mightily by our press,\" Trump said. \"If Russia or China or any other\ncountry has those emails, to be honest with you, I’d love to see them.\" Though Trump's\nsupporters and surrogates dismissed the remark as a joke, the statement carried serious\nimplications in the midst of Russia's hack-and-leak operation targeting the Democratic\nNational Committee and the Clinton campaign. And it remained a bizarrely explicit public\nwish for the sort of collusion with Russian intelligence that Trump would proceed to deny for\nyears to come. The [investigation of FBI special counsel Robert Mueller would later show that](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/mueller-russia-hacks-timeline-686521)\nRussian hackers had successfully phished Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta months\nearlier, tricking him into giving up his Gmail password, and were continuing to send phishing\nemails to Clinton aides even as Trump made his glib request for Russian hacking help.\n\nThe 400-Pound Hacker\n\n\n-----\n\nTrump s [notorious debate answer on the cyber also included a new theory of who actually](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/26/13068578/transcript-here-are-words-trump-just-used-to-talk-about-the-cyber)\ncarried out the DNC hack, one that's since come to represent every armchair detective's\nunfounded skepticism of hacker forensics. \"She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia,\" Trump\nsaid, referring to Clinton's statements on the hack, based on evidence as glaring as Russianlanguage formatting error messages in the DNC's leaked documents. \"Maybe it was. It could\nalso be China. It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\" The\nmythical 400-pound hacker has since become practically a meme among cybersecurity\nprofessionals pointing to lazy attribution. It also inspired a renewed discussion on body\nshaming.\n\nOur Cybersecurity Partner, Putin\n\nBy July 2017, six months into his presidential term, Trump had no doubt received countless\nintelligence briefings confirming that Russia was responsible for the breaches of the DNC\nand Clinton campaign. After all, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had\npublished a statement in October of the previous year, backed by 17 intelligence agencies,\npinning the blame on the Kremlin with \"high confidence.\" But Trump was still consulting his\nown source: Vladimir Putin. During a trip to the G-20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, Trump\nsays, he discussed the election interference campaign with Putin privately. His takeaway? “I\nsaid, ‘Did you do it?’ And he said ‘No, I did not. Absolutely not,’” Trump said in an interview\nwith Reuters. “I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely\nnot.” In another tweet following his meeting with Putin, Trump floated the Russian president's\n[suggestion that the US and Russia jointly form an \"impenetrable Cyber Security unit\" to](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber/trump-backtracks-on-cyber-unit-with-russia-after-harsh-criticism-idUSKBN19U0P4)\nprevent further election meddling. Former defense secretary Ash Carter compared the idea\nto \"the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary.”\n\n‘Ukraine … the Server … CrowdStrike?’\n\nIt's one thing for Trump to have questioned who really hacked the DNC in public\nappearances, years after his own intelligence agencies gave him the answer—a kind of\nwillful ignorance aimed at swaying public perceptions. But it's quite another matter for Trump\nto have chased nonsensical theories about the DNC hack in private conversations, a sign\nthat he may have drunk so deeply from the conspiracy Kool-Aid that he'd come to believe his\nown lies. That's what was revealed in the transcript of a conversation Trump had in the\nsummer of 2019 with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky: The phone call came to light\nbecause a whistle-blower heard Trump try to pressure Zelensky to open an investigation into\nthe son of Trump's political rival Joe Biden—the request that would eventually lead to\nTrump's first impeachment. But the transcript of the call also captured Trump asking\nZelensky vague questions about a CrowdStrike server in Ukraine, an element of a strange,\n[false story about how CrowdStrike helped cover up what really happened inside the DNC's](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-ukraine-server-delusion-spreading/)\nnetwork. \"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine,\nthey say CrowdStrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they\nsay Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation,\" Trump said.\n[Never mind that CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company Or that no single server provided](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-ukraine-call-crowdstrike-dnc-russia/)\n\n\n-----\n\nthe full picture of the DNC breach. Or that the DNC shared a forensically preserved digital\nimage of its systems with the FBI and CrowdStrike, not a physical server. Or that the FBI\nconcluded that Russian agents had indeed hacked the network. The Zelensky call's real\nrevelation was that Trump will always live in his own alternative reality.\n\n‘No One Gets Hacked’\n\nJust days before the November 2020 presidential election, Trump took a moment at a\ncampaign rally to mock C-Span political editor Steve Scully, who had been suspended from\nhis position for falsely claiming that a tweet he sent was the work of a hacker. “Nobody gets\nhacked. To get hacked you need somebody with 197 IQ and he needs about 15 percent of\n[your password,” Trump said. Trump's statements were followed by a report days later that](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/dutch-hacker-trump-twitter-account-password/)\nhis own Twitter feed had been hacked by a security researcher, reports which were\n[confirmed in December. The same week as his \"nobody gets hacked\" claim, federal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/16/trumps-twitter-account-was-hacked-dutch-ministry-affirms)\nagencies unsealed an indictment against six hackers in Russia's GRU military intelligence\nagency for five years of attacks that included the most destructive cyberattack in history,\nimposed new sanctions on the Moscow research institute responsible for a uniquely\ndangerous piece of malware, and issued a public warning about an ongoing hacking\ncampaign believed to be carried out by the FSB.\n\nA ‘Rigged’ Election\n\nBoth before, during, and after the November 2020 election that he soundly lost to Joe Biden,\nTrump railed repeatedly against all assurances of the security and cybersecurity of the 2020\nelection. [Trump's attacks on the election's integrity were so nonstop—from the debate stage](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-mail-vote-debate-lies/)\nto his Twitter feed, making baseless claims of dead people voting, fake mail-in ballots, and\nglitchy or hacked voting machines—that it's difficult to point to any single statement as the\nmost egregious. In total, however, they may be the [most damaging to American democracy](https://www.wired.com/story/chris-krebs-cisa-trump-impeachment-disinformation/)\nof all his false statements about cybersecurity.\n\nNone of those claims was backed up with any evidence of fraud. Instead, a group of election\nsecurity experts and officials, including the Trump administration's own Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency, issued a statement calling the 2020 election “the most secure\nin American history.\" Even then-attorney general William Barr, a Trump loyalist, told the\n_Associated Press that “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a_\ndifferent outcome in the election.\"\n\nThe Defcon Video\n\nIn the midst of Trump's rigged election tirades, the most head-scratching moment for the\ncybersecurity community was, perhaps, a message with no words at all. After falsely\nclaiming in earlier tweets that voting machines made by Dominion Voting had deleted 27\nmillion votes, Trump tweeted a video from the 2019 Defcon hacker conference. The news\nfootage, shot at the Las Vegas event's voting-machine hacking village, showed security\n\n\n-----\n\nresearchers demonstrating numerous security vulnerabilities. Organizers of the event and\ndozens of other election security experts responded by signing on to a statement denouncing\nTrump's claims of any election rigging or hacking. While the Defcon event had in fact\ndemonstrated vulnerabilities in voting machines, they pointed out that there was no evidence\nthose vulnerabilities had been exploited. In fact, evidence of those vulnerabilities had helped\nbolster efforts to safeguard elections against hacking, such as with audits and recounts of\npaper ballots.\n\n\"We are aware of alarming assertions being made that the 2020 election was 'rigged' by\nexploiting technical vulnerabilities,\" the statement read. “However, in every case of which we\nare aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent. To\nour collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth that supports a conclusion\nthat the 2020 election outcome in any state has been altered through technical compromise.”\n\nFiring Chris Krebs by Tweet\n\nThe day after that statement was published, Trump summarily fired CISA head Chris Krebs\nin a pair of tweets. \"The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election\nwas highly inaccurate,\" they began. \"Therefore, effectively immediately, Chris Krebs has\nbeen terminated as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\"\nThe tweets also included a rehashed greatest hits of several of Trump's debunked electoral\nfraud falsehoods. But Trump's decision to fire the official widely credited with protecting the\n2020 election from foreign interference deeply unnerved many in the cybersecurity world.\n\nMaybe It Was China, SolarWinds Edition\n\nIn mid-December, the [massive breach of SolarWinds and an untold number of its customers](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-hack-roundup/)\n—including at least half a dozen federal agencies—came to light. Officials with access to\nclassified intelligence about the breach, including members of Congress, Attorney General\nBarr, and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo all attributed the attack to Russia, recognized\nthe gravity of the cybersecurity crisis, and vowed some sort of response. After days of\nsilence on the issue, Trump finally used the opportunity to divert blame from Russia and\nrehash claims of election fraud:\n\n“The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully\n[briefed and everything is well under control,” Trump tweeted. The \"Lamestream\" media, he](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-mark-levin-coronavirus-pandemic-hacking-6080f156125a4a46edef2a6dcf826611)\nadded, are \"petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!)\" He ended by\nsuggesting that the hack, which he had just called insignificant, might have affected the\nresults of the election which he had just \"won big, making it even more of a corrupted\nembarrassment for the USA.\"\n\nThat final, news-making tweet about cybersecurity issues from Trump's Twitter feed, just a\nfew weeks before his account was permanently suspended, managed to inject disinformation\ninto the election outcome, cloud a complicated national issue, provide cover for Russia, and\n\n\n-----\n\ncontradict itself all at once. After four years, we would expect nothing less.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?
