The attacks targeted high-pro�le targets, including government and\n\ncommercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several di�erent countries, but our investigation\n\nrevealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India.\n\nWhile there have been several Suck�y campaigns that infected organizations with the group’s custom\n\nmalware Backdoor.Nidiran (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015\n120123-5521-99), the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in\n\nother regions. This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against speci�c\n\ntargets in India.\n\n**Campaign activity in India**\n\nThe �rst known Suck�y campaign began in April of 2014. During our investigation of the campaign, we\n\nidenti�ed a number of global targets across several industries who were attacked in 2015. Many of the\n\ntargets we identi�ed were well known commercial organizations located in India. These organizations\n\nincluded:\n\nOne of India's largest �nancial organizations\n\nA large e-commerce company\n\nThe e-commerce company's primary shipping vendor\n\nOne of India's top �ve IT �rms\n\nA United States healthcare provider's Indian business unit\n\nTwo government organizations\n\nSuck�y spent more time attacking the government networks compared to all but one of the\n\ncommercial targets. Additionally, one of the two government organizations had the highest infection\n\nrate of the Indian targets. Figure 1 shows the infection rate for each of the targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Infection rates of Indian targets\n\nIndian government org #2 is responsible for implementing network software for di�erent ministries\n\nand departments within India's central government. The high infection rate for this target is likely\n\nbecause of its access to technology and information related to other Indian government organizations.\n\nSuck�y's attacks on government organizations that provide information technology services to other\n\ngovernment branches is not limited to India. It has conducted attacks on similar organizations in Saudi\n\nArabia, likely because of the access that those organizations have.\n\nSuck�y's targets are displayed in �gure 2 by their industry, which provides a clearer view of the group’s\n\noperations. Most of the group's attacks are focused on government or technology related companies\n\nand organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Suck�y victims, by industry\n\n**Suck�y attack lifecycle**\n\nOne of the attacks we investigated provided detailed insight into how Suck�y conducts its operations.\n\nIn 2015, Suck�y conducted a multistage attack between April 22 and May 4 against an e-commerce\n\norganization based in India. Similar to its other attacks, Suck�y used the Nidiran back door along with\n\na number of hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts. The tools and malware used in this breach\n\nwere also signed with stolen digital certi�cates (http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/keeping\nyour-code-signing-certi�cate-straight-and-narrow). During this time the following events took place:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Suck�y attack lifecycle\n\n1. Suck�y's �rst step was to identify a user to target so the attackers could attempt their initial breach\n\ninto the e-commerce company's internal network. We don't have hard evidence of how Suck�y\n\nobtained information on the targeted user, but we did �nd a large open-source presence on the\n\ninitial target. The target's job function, corporate email address, information on work related\n\nprojects, and publicly accessible personal blog could all be freely found online.\n\n2. On April 22, 2015, Suck�y exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system\n\n(Windows) that allowed the attackers to bypass the User Account Control and install the Nidiran\n\nback door to provide access for their attack. While we know the attackers used a custom dropper to\n\ninstall the back door, we do not know the delivery vector. Based on the amount of open-source\n\ninformation available on the target, it is feasible that a spear-phishing email may have been used.\n\n3. After the attackers successfully exploited the employee’s system, they gained access to the e\ncommerce company's internal network. We found evidence that Suck�y used hacktools to move\n\nlatterly and escalate privileges. To do this the attackers used a signed credential-dumping tool to\n\nobtain the victim's account credentials. With the account credentials, the attackers were able to\n\naccess the victim's account and navigate the internal corporate network as though they were the\n\nemployee.\n\n\n-----\n\nwith port 40 open because there isn't a common protocol assigned to this port. Based on Suck�y\n\nscanning for common ports, it’s clear that the group was looking to expand its foothold on the e\ncommerce company's internal network.\n\n5. The attackers’ �nal step was to ex�ltrate data o� the victim’s network and onto Suck�y’s\n\ninfrastructure. While we know that the attackers used the Nidiran back door to steal information\n\nabout the compromised organization, we do not know if Suck�y was successful in stealing other\n\ninformation.\n\nThese steps were taken over a 13-day period, but only on speci�c days. While tracking what days of the\n\nweek Suck�y used its hacktools, we discovered that the group was only active Monday through Friday.\n\nThere was no activity from the group on weekends. We were able to determine this because the\n\nattackers’ hacktools are command line driven and can provide insight into when the operators are\n\nbehind keyboards actively working. Figure 4 shows the attackers’ activity levels throughout the week.\n\nFigure 4. Signed hacktools in use against targets, by day\n\nThis activity supports our theory, mentioned in the previous Suck�y blog\n\n(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/suck�y-revealing-secret-life-your-code-signing-certi�cates),\n\nthat this is a professional organized group.\n\n**Suck�y's command and control infrastructure**\n\nSuck�y made its malware di�cult to analyze to prevent their operations from being detected.\n\nHowever, we were able to successfully analyze Suck�y malware samples and extract some of the\n\n\n-----\n\nWe analyzed the dropper, which is an executable that contains the following three �les:\n\n1. dllhost.exe: The main host for the .dll �le\n\n2. iviewers.dll: Used to load encrypted payloads and then decrypt them\n\n3. ms�ed: The encrypted payload\n\nAll three �les are required for the malware to run correctly. Once the malware has been executed, it\n\nchecks to see if it has a connection to the internet before running. If the connection test is successful,\n\nthe malware runs and attempts to communicate with the C&C domain over ports 443 and 8443. In the\n\nsamples we analyzed we found the port and C&C information encrypted and hardcoded into the\n\nNidiran malware itself. The Nidiran back door made the following initial communication request to the\n\nSuck�y C&C domain:\n\nGET /gte_ok0/logon.php HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, de�ate\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR\n\n1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152;\n\n.NET CLR 3.5.30729)\n\nHost: REDACTED\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n**Cookie:**\n\n**dfe6=OIAXUNXWn9CBmFBqtwEEPLzwRGmbMoNR7C0nLcHYa+C1tb4fp7ydcZSmVZ1c4akergWcQQ==**\n\nThe interesting information being transmitted to the C&C server in the initial request is located in the\n\ncookie which is comprised of the following:\n\n[COOKIE NAME]=[RC4 ENCRYPTED + B64 ENCODED DATA FROM VICTIM]\n\nThe key for the RC4 encryption in this sample is the hardcoded string “h0le”. Once the cookie data is\n\ndecoded, Suck�y has the network name, hostname, IP address, and the victim's operating system\n\ninformation.\n\nInformation about the C&C infrastructure identi�ed in our analysis of Suck�y activity can be seen in\n\nTable 1.\n\n\n**Registration**\n**Domain** **Registration** **IP address**\n\n**date**\n\n\n-----\n\nssl.2upgrades[.]com kumar.pari@yandex[.]com 176.58.96.234 July 5, 2014\n\nbss.pvtcdn[.]com registrar@mail.zgsj[.]com 106.184.1.38 May 19, 2015\n\n\nssl.microsoft-security\ncenter[.]com\n\n\nWhoisguard Unknown July 20, 2015\n\n\nAugust 18,\nusv0503.iqservs-jp[.]com Domain@quicca[.]com 133.242.134.121\n\n2014\n\n�i.fedora-dns-update[.]com Whoisguard Unknown Unknown\n\n\nTable. Suck�y C&C infrastructure information\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSuck�y targeted one of India’s largest e-commerce companies, a major Indian shipping company, one\n\nof India’s largest �nancial organizations, and an IT �rm that provides support for India’s largest stock\n\nexchange. All of these targets are large corporations that play a major role in India’s economy. By\n\ntargeting all of these organizations together, Suck�y could have had a much larger impact on India and\n\nits economy. While we don't know the motivations behind the attacks, the targeted commercial\n\norganizations, along with the targeted government organizations, may point in this direction.\n\nSuck�y has the resources to develop malware, purchase infrastructure, and conduct targeted attacks\n\nfor years while staying o� the radar of security organizations. During this time they were able to steal\n\ndigital certi�cates from South Korean companies and launch attacks against Indian and Saudi Arabian\n\ngovernment organizations. There is no evidence that Suck�y gained any bene�ts from attacking the\n\ngovernment organizations, but someone else may have bene�ted from these attacks.\n\nThe nature of the Suck�y attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat group orchestrated these\n\nattacks on their own. We believe that Suck�y will continue to target organizations in India and similar\n\norganizations in other countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind\n\nSuck�y's operations.\n\n**Protection**\n\nSymantec has the following detections in place to protect against Suck�y’s malware:\n\n\n-----\n\n120123-5521-99)\n\nBackdoor.Nidiran!g1 (http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015\n120200-0342-99)\n\n[Hacktool (http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-081707-2550-99)](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-081707-2550-99)\n\nExp.CVE-2014-6332 (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014\n111313-5510-99)\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\nWeb Attack: Microsoft OleAut32 RCE CVE-2014-6332\n\n(http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28032)\n\nWeb Attack: Microsoft OleAut32 RCE CVE-2014-6332 2\n\n(http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=27813)\n\nWeb Attack: Microsoft OleAut32 RCE CVE-2014-6332 4\n\n(http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=70116)\n\nWeb Attack: OLEAUT32 CVE-2014-6332 3\n\n(http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28890)\n\nSystem Infected: Trojan.Backdoor Activity 120\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28977)\n\n\n [Tags: Security (/connect/communities/security), Security Response (/connect/named-blogs/symantec-security-](http://www.symantec.com/connect/communities/security)\n\n[response), Endpoint Protection (AntiVirus) (/connect/products/endpoint-protection-antivirus), APT (/connect/blog-](http://www.symantec.com/connect/products/endpoint-protection-antivirus)\n\n[tags/apt), Backdoor.Nidiran (/connect/blog-tags/backdoornidiran), Cyberespionage (/connect/blog-tags/cyberespionage),](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blog-tags/backdoornidiran)\n\n[espionage (/connect/blog-tags/espionage), India (/connect/blog-tags/india), Suck�y (/connect/blog-tags/suck�y)](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blog-tags/espionage)\n\n Subscriptions (0)\n\n\n(/connect/user/jondimaggio)\n**[Jon_DiMaggio (/connect/user/jondimaggio)](http://www.symantec.com/connect/user/jondimaggio)**\n\n [View Pro�le (/connect/user/jondimaggio)](http://www.symantec.com/connect/user/jondimaggio)\n\n\n**Login (https://www-secure.symantec.com/connect/user/login?**\n**destination=node%2F3594731) or Register (https://www-**\n**secure.symantec.com/connect/user/register?destination=node%2F3594731) to post**\n**comments.**\n\n\n-----\n\n[(https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/G7KVZWQ)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/G7KVZWQ)\n\n[Contact Us (/connect/contact)](http://www.symantec.com/connect/contact) [Privacy Policy (http://www.symantec.com/about/pro�le/policies/privacy.jsp)](http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/policies/privacy.jsp) Terms and\n\nConditions (/connect/legal) [Earn Rewards (/connect/points)](http://www.symantec.com/connect/points) Rewards Terms and Conditions (/connect/blogs/symantec\nconnect-rewards-program-terms-and-conditions)\n\n© 2016 Symantec Corporation\n\n [(https://twitter.com/symantec)](https://twitter.com/symantec)  [(https://www.facebook.com/Symantec) ](https://www.facebook.com/Symantec)\n\n(https://www.linkedin.com/company/symantec)\n\n\n-----",
