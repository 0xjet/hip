Options for securing ICS systems and networks are newer and less tested. Still,\ntechnologies such as security information and event management (SIEM) solutions\nand passive network anomaly detection systems, enabling greater insight into control\nsystem networks with decreased risk of operational disruptions, have begun to grow in\nnumber and establish their safety and reliability.\n\n###### Threat Perception\n\nRecognizing that decision influencers often deal more closely with the details of\noperations, we refined our survey from last year. In addition to asking for the respondents’\nperceptions, we added a question to learn how decision makers and decision influencers\nperceived the threat. Figure 4 compares these two groups’ perceptions.\n\n\n**At what level does your organization perceive**\n**the current cybersecurity threat to control systems?**\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nDecision Makers Decision Influencers\n\n_Figure 4. Threat Perceptions_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### y\n\n Incident Detection\n\nA clear year-over-year trend emerged in respondents’ answers to our question about\n\nrecent control system infiltration. It appears that more breaches are occurring, with 9%\n\nof respondents acknowledging six or more breaches in 2014, and 17% noting six or\n\nmore breaches in 2015. More organizations also acknowledge the possibility of breaches\n\n\n###### Without awareness of normal\n\n communications and activity,\n\n it’s impossible to properly\n\n evaluate or improve security of\n\n assets. Operations and security\n\n staff must be able to visualize\n\n and verify normal network\n\n operations to detect and assess\n\n possible abnormalities and\n\n respond to potential breaches.\n\n\n**Have your control system cyber assets and/or control**\n**system network ever been infected or infiltrated?**\n\n\u0007Not that we know of\n\n\u0007Yes\n\n\u0007No, we’re sure we haven’t\nbeen infiltrated\n\n\u0007We’ve had suspicions but\nwere never able to prove it\n\n\u0007We don’t know and have\nno suspicions\n\n_Figure 5.

Number of Breaches_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### y\n\nFor 39% of respondents, systems were breached for at least 24 hours before security staff\n\nbecame aware of the breach, and 20% reported that they could not determine how long\n\nthe infiltration had been going on. For an additional 20%, breaches were not detected\n\nfor more than a week, and 15% reported not knowing about the infiltration for more\n\nthan a month, as illustrated in Figure 7.\n\n**How long (on average) after the incident began did your control systems**\n**security staff become aware of the situation?**\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\n_Figure 7. Time to Detection_\n\nVarious industry reports show that security breaches often go undetected for great\n\nlengths of time, even exceeding our greatest answer option by multiples. Such lengthy\n\ntimes to detection provide more than enough time for attackers to complete their\n\nreconnaissance and install any illicit monitoring, reporting or disrupting malware.\n\nGreater amounts of time also allow attackers to remove the traces that would otherwise\n\nprovide forensic investigators with the clues necessary to identify them, their actions\n\nand purposes. So it comes as no surprise that 44% never identified where the infiltrations\n\nor infections took place.

Whether external connections are opened by third parties, internal\n\noperators or others, many of these connections use the Internet as a conduit, exposing\n\ncritical infrastructure to direct attack. The Internet of Things[20] and Industrial Internet of\n\nThings[21] trends will continue to drive proliferation of inter-network linkages and threat\n\nexposures for the foreseeable future.\n\nWithout specialized tools, tracing connections can be very time-intensive. Active\n\nscanning of control system environments can cause operational disruptions, and most\n\nactive scanners are designed for identifying commercial OS vulnerabilities. ICS-specific\n\npassive traffic monitoring applications such as passive network anomaly detection\n\nsystems can aid in scanning operations.\n\n###### Assessing Security\n\nAs valuable as security assessments are, they are snapshots, and their accuracy and\n\nvalue diminish with age. The fact that 40% of respondents last performed an assessment\n\nmore than six months ago and 9% have never done a security assessment of their\n\ncontrol systems or control networks means many organizations are working with\n\nobsolete information. Although there is no one-size-fits-all frequency to performing\n\nsecurity assessments,[22] the risks of unknown exposures and vulnerabilities in critical\n\ninfrastructure argue for minimal delays between assessments.\n\nMost (69%) of the assessments carried out in respondents’ companies are performed\n\nby internal teams. However, people with the required skills and experience are in short\n\nsupply and high demand, and very few operating companies have them on staff, which\n\ncalls the value of the efforts of these internal teams into question.\n\n20 \u0007www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-botnet.html\n\n21 \u0007www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/forget-smart-fridges-the-industrial-internet-of-things-is-the-real-revolution-1287276\n\n\n-----\n\n###### y g\n\n Vulnerability Detection\n\nNo single tool can cover all exposures in control system\n\nnetworks, and security practitioners are well-served to use a\n\nvariety.

Vulnerability Detection Processes_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### y g\n\n Threat Intelligence\n\nMany respondents are following some recommended practices to detect threats aimed\nat their control systems: 49% have trained security staff, 45% use third-party intelligence\nfrom security vendors, 44% work with governmental agencies and 45% participate in\nindustry information-sharing groups. Although all of these methods are valuable and\ncomplementary, they are not all in use by the same companies. As noted previously, a\ncombination of intelligence tools is the best way to ensure asset protection.\n\nWe also observed a reduction in the number of respondents who rely on their\nown staff for their threat intelligence needs. Monitoring and tracking the flow of\ninformation regarding threats, threat actors and active attacks—as well as analyzing\nthat data and producing targeted intelligence relevant to the specific considerations\nof each company—call for a specialized set of skills not commonly found in security\npractitioners.\n\n###### Incident Reporting\n\nWhen encountering signs of infection or infiltration, survey participants turn first to the\nsame four groups: internal resources, government organizations, control system vendors\nand security consultants. A greater number of respondents consult with vendors (45%)\nand security consultants (38%) than in the past (37% and 33%, respectively in 2014). And\nthey are significantly more likely to contact a cybersecurity solution provider than before\n(32% in 2015 compared with 21% in 2014). Figure 14 provides a complete breakdown.\n\n\n**Whom do you consult in case of signs of an infection or infiltration of your**\n**control system cyber assets or network?

For 8% of respondents, no single\nindividual set policy; rather, policy was set by committees, teams and boards. The\nevolving nature of the control system security landscape and the unique characteristics\nof each operation certainly appear to contribute to the diversity of models in use.\n\nIT and control system networks are still very different environments,[23] and a strong working\nknowledge of both is required to set and implement successful policies. We consider\nthe involvement of cross-functional teams a positive indication that organizations are\nworking to ensure inclusion of all aspects of the systems and networks involved.\n\n\n**Who in your organization is responsible for implementation of security**\n**controls around control systems?

We find this year’s results encouraging in\n\nthat more respondents consider cybersecurity in their automation systems procurement\n\nprocess. The group indicating it does not consider cybersecurity in automation systems\n\nprocurement process decreased, from 9% in 2014 to 6%. Those confirming they do\n\nconsider cybersecurity grew to 35% (from 32% in 2014), while those who “somewhat” do\n\nalso grew to 37% (from 35% in 2014). See Figure 17.\n\n**Do you normally consider cybersecurity in your**\n**automation systems procurement process?**\n\n\u0007Yes—we have a very clear and\nreasonable list of requirements.\n\n\u0007Somewhat—we ask for compliance to\nas many standards as possible.\n\n\u0007Hopefully—we ask the vendors to\ncome up with a proposal.\n\n\u0007Not really—we want to, but are not\nsure what to ask.\n\n\u0007No—we do not consider cybersecurity\nin our procurement processes.\n\n\u0007Other\n\n_Figure 17.

The majority (83%)\nrecognize the importance of having a security strategy to address the convergence\nof information and operational technologies. Unfortunately, only 47% actually have a\nstrategy, as shown in Figure 18.\n\n\n**Does your company have a security strategy to address**\n**the convergence of information and operational technologies?**\n\n\u0007We have no strategy and no\nplans to develop one.\n\n\u0007We have no strategy but are\ndeveloping one.\n\n\u0007We have a strategy and are\nimplementing it.\n\n\u0007We have a strategy in place.\n\n_Figure 18.
