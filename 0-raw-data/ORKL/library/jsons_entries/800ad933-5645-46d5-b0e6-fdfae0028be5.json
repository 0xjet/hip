Our analysis of an update log file we found reveals\nthe remote support program’s update process started around 13:35 on July 18, with the 9002 RAT\nbeing downloaded and launched. We also saw the RAT file used for this specific attack was set to\nbe inactive in August, so we can construe that the RAT’s activity was rather short-lived (from July\n18 to July 31).\n\n\n-----\n\n|Filename|Tool|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|dsget.exe|DsGet|View active directory objects|\n|dsquery.exe|DsQuery|Search for active directory objects|\n|sharphound.ex e|SharpHound|Collect active directory information|\n|aio.exe|All In One (AIO)|Publicly available hack tool|\n|ssms.exe|SQL Password dumper|Dump password from SQL database|\n\n\n_Figure 5.
