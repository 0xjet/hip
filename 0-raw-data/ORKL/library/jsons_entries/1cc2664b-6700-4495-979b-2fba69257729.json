    "plain_text": "## CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS By Insikt Group®\n\n##### CTA-2021-0107\n\n## ADVERSARY INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT 2020:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Recorded Future’s Insikt Group® conducted a study of malicious command and_\n_control (C2) infrastructure identified using proactive scanning methods throughout_\n_2020. All data was sourced from the Recorded Future® Platform. Data in this report_\n_is as of November 15, 2020._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nRecorded Future tracks the creation and modification of new\n\nmalicious infrastructure for a multitude of post-exploitation toolkits,\n\ncustom malware frameworks, and open-source remote access trojans.\n\nThe effort has been [ongoing since 2017, when Insikt Group created](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/threat-identification.pdf)\n\nmethodologies to identify the deployments of open-source remote\n\naccess trojans (RATs). Recorded Future collected over 10,000 unique\n\ncommand and control servers during 2020, across more than 80 families.\n\n#### Key Findings\n\n   - Over 55 percent of detected servers (5,740 servers) were not\n\nreferenced at all in open sources; they were only identified in\n\na proprietary Recorded Future list of command and control\n\nservers.\n\n   - On average, command and control servers had a lifespan\n\n(that is, the amount of time the server hosted the malicious\n\ninfrastructure) of 54.8 days.\n\n   - Where possible, lead time was calculated if the detection was\n\nthe first event for an IP address in 2020. Lead time is the length\n\nof time (in days) between when a C2 server is created, and\n\nwhen it is reported or detected in other sources. This identified\n\n924 servers where lead time was generated, by comparing first\n\nsighting on the Recorded Future command and control list and\n\nits subsequent sighting on another source. Our detections had\n\nan average 61-day lead time before an IP address was found\n\non open sources.\n\n   - Monitoring only “suspicious” hosting providers can leave\n\nblindspots, as 33 percent of C2s observed by Recorded Future\n\nwere hosted in the United States, many on reputable providers.\n\n   - The hosting providers that had the most command and control\n\nservers on their infrastructure were all U.S.-based: Amazon,\n\nDigital Ocean, and Choopa.\n\n   - Detecting offensive security tools is just as important as\n\ndetecting custom implants: elite operators from APT groups,\n\nhuman-operated ransomware actors, and common criminals\n\nuse these tools to cut costs just as much as red teams do. Over\n\n40 percent of the detections were open source tools.\n\n\n#### Background\n\nLead time in identifying malicious servers can be a proactive\n\nmeasure in neutralizing threats. Before a server can be used by a threat\n\nactor, it has to be acquired, either via compromise or legitimate purchase.\n\nThen, the software must be installed, configurations must be tuned, and\n\nfiles added to the server. The actors must access it via panel login, SSH,\n\nor RDP protocols, and then expose the malware controller on a port to\n\nallow the data to transfer from the victim and to administer commands\n\nto infections. Only then can the server be used for malicious purposes.\n\nHowever, in exposing, configuring, and accessing the server,\n\nthe adversary leaves behind their fingerprints; sometimes in software\n\ndeployed on the server, sometimes via the login panel, sometimes via\n\nSSL registration patterns. This creates an opportunity for detection,\n\nwhich can occur prior to a phishing email being sent or an implant getting\n\ncompiled.\n\nSimilarly, such a collection can illuminate many things about\n\nadversaries. Seeing how many command and control (C2) servers are\n\ncreated can help one quantify the breadth of an actor’s campaigns.\n\nComparing such data to reports of intrusions related to those families\n\ncan identify how many intrusions get caught, and potentially how many\n\nevents remain unknown in the public domain. Finally, it can provide novel\n\nindicators and intelligence that is otherwise not available in the public\n\ndomain.\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nThe most commonly observed families were dominated by open\n[source or commercially available tooling. Detections of unaltered Cobalt](https://www.recordedfuture.com/cobalt-strike-servers/)\n\nStrike deployments (the pre-configured [TLS certificate, Team Server](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2019/02/19/cobalt-strike-team-server-population-study/)\n\n[administration port, or telltale HTTP headers) represented 13.5 percent](https://www.x33fcon.com/archive/2019/slides/x33fcon19_Hunting_Beacons_Bartek.pdf)\n\nof the total C2 servers identified. Metasploit, and PupyRAT represented\n\nthe other top open-source command and control servers identified by\n\nRecorded Future.\n\n**Top 5 Most Prolific C2 Families**\n\n**Family** **2020 C2s**\n\nCobalt Strike 1441\n\nMetasploit 1122\n\nPupyRAT 454\n\n_Table 1: Top detected malware families by command and control infrastructure (These_\n_numbers include preexisting servers that were still up at the time of analysis and do not_\n_represent newly created servers in 2020)._\n\nThe top 10 most common offensive security tools (OST), based\n\non the number of observed C2 servers, included new and old families.\n\nNotably, Recorded Future observed 393 Cobalt Strike servers that were\n\n[outside of common detection mechanisms; we assess these detections](https://youtu.be/x1tEOkY-7JE)\n\n[only represent a portion of total Cobalt Strike use. PWC and Blackberry](https://youtu.be/YCwyc6SctYs)\n\nfound that a majority of Cobalt Strike deployments for which a payload\n\nwas observed used [cracked or trial versions of the commercially](https://www.recordedfuture.com/cobalt-strike-servers/)\n\navailable tool.\n\n|Top 5 Most Prolific C2 Families|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Family|2020 C2s|\n|Cobalt Strike|1441|\n|Metasploit|1122|\n|PupyRAT|454|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Top 10 C2 Hosting Providers|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Hosting Provider|ASN|Country|Top Family|Total C2s|\n|Amazon.com, Inc.|AS16509|United States|Cobalt Strike|471|\n|Digital Ocean|AS14061|United States|Metasploit|421|\n|Choopa, LLC|AS20473|United States|Cobalt Strike|368|\n|Zenlayer Inc|AS21859|United States|Roaming Mantis|358|\n|Hangzhou Alibaba Advertising|AS37963|China|Cobalt Strike|335|\n|ICIDC Network|AS136800|China|Cobalt Strike|277|\n|OVH SAS|AS16276|France|PupyRAT|273|\n|Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems|AS45090|China|Cobalt Strike|262|\n|Google LLC|AS15169|United States|Bozok RAT|241|\n|Space-IX - RECONN LLC|AS6870|Russia|DarkComet|205|\n\n\nPoshC2 [UNC1945](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/11/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945.html)\n\n_Table 2: Example open source malware families tracked by Recorded Future (These numbers_\n_include preexisting servers that were still up at the time of analysis and do not represent newly_\n_created servers in 2020)._\n\nNearly all of the OSTs detected by Recorded Future have been linked to\n\nAPT or high-end financial actors. The ease of access and use of these tools,\n\nmixed with the murkiness of potential attribution makes them appealing for\n\nunauthorized intrusions and red teams alike. This, in addition to the adoption of\n\nthese frameworks by ransomware actors, makes their detection a priority.\n\n#### Host(er)s With the Most (C2s)\n\nRecorded Future C2 data allowed us to identify the most popular hosting\n\nproviders for C2 servers. We observed the creation of C2 infrastructure on 576\n\nhosting providers, representing only a small percentage of the total AS operators,\n\n[which exceeds 60,000 providers.](https://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/)\n\nThe most-used ASNs are undoubtedly linked to the size of the provider, not\n\nnecessarily implying that they are bulletproof hosting providers or complicit in\n\nadversary actions. The most used tooling can be considered dual use, increasing\n\nthe volume of these servers on more reputable AS ranges.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc., operating out of the United States, hosted the most C2s of\n\nan ASN observed by Recorded Future. They accounted for 471 individual command\n\nand control servers (roughly 3.8 percent). The most commonly observed family on\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. was Cobalt Strike, with 167 servers identified. The next largest\n\nwas Digital Ocean, also operating out of the U.S.\n\nServers in the United States that accounted for other top hosting providers\n\ncan be seen below. The deployment of Cobalt Strike and Metasploit controllers\n\non these providers is not indicative of malpractice or negligent hosting, but is\n\nmore likely due to authorized red teams using these tools on cloud infrastructure.\n\n1 On October 29, 2020, Recorded Future detected an Armitage certificate on the IP 179.43.128[.]5, which was also\nhosting a Cobalt Strike server used by UNC1878, with likely intent to deploy Ryuk Ransomware.\n\n\n_Table 4: Hosting providers who hosted the most command and control servers during 2020._\n\nThere is less predictability in the most common ASNs used across OSTs,\n\nas they are readily available for red team exercises and unauthorized intrusions.\n\n**Top OST Hosting Providers**\n\n**Hosting**\n**Family** **ASN** **Country** **C2s**\n**Provider**\n\nCobalt Strike ICIDC NETWORK AS136800 China 259\n\nShenzhen\nMetasploit AS45090 China 124\n\nTencent Limited\n\nPupyRAT Digital Ocean AS14061 United States 85\n\nPowershell\n\nDigital Ocean AS14061 United States 43\nEmpire\n\nAmazon.com,\nCovenant AS16509 United States 29\n\nInc.\n\n_Table 5: Top hosting providers for each OST._\n\nPublicly available tooling published as remote access trojans (RATs) also had\n\nlimited predictability of its favored hosting providers.\n\n**RATs’ Favorite Hosting Providers**\n\n**Family** **Hosting Provider** **ASN** **Country** **C2s**\n\nQuasarRAT Internap Corporation AS19024 United States 175\n\nDarkComet RECONN LLC AS6870 Russia 89\n\nBozok RAT Google LLC AS15169 United States 62\n\nnjRAT Crnogorski Telekom AS8585 Montenegro 32\n\nTaiwan Academic\nREMCOS AS1659 Taiwan 14\n\nNetwork\n\n_Table 6: Top hosting providers for each RAT._\n\n|Top 10 Observed Offensive Security Tools|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Family|Notable Users|\n|Cobalt Strike|APT41, Mustang Panda, Ocean Lotus, FIN7|\n|Metasploit|JointWorm (EVILNUM), Turla|\n|PupyRAT|APT33, COBALT ILLUSION|\n|Powershell Empire|Sandworm, GADOLINIUM|\n|Meterpreter|MuddyWater, TA505|\n|Covenant|APT34 (GreenBug)|\n|Armitage|WIZARD SPIDER (UNC1878)1|\n|Octopus C2|Unnamed Chinese APT|\n|Sliver|N/A|\n|Responder|APT28, APT40 (TEMP.Periscope)|\n|PoshC2|UNC1945|\n\n|Top OST Hosting Providers|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Family|Hosting Provider|ASN|Country|C2s|\n|Cobalt Strike|ICIDC NETWORK|AS136800|China|259|\n|Metasploit|Shenzhen Tencent Limited|AS45090|China|124|\n|PupyRAT|Digital Ocean|AS14061|United States|85|\n|Powershell Empire|Digital Ocean|AS14061|United States|43|\n|Covenant|Amazon.com, Inc.|AS16509|United States|29|\n\n|RATs’ Favorite Hosting Providers|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Family|Hosting Provider|ASN|Country|C2s|\n|QuasarRAT|Internap Corporation|AS19024|United States|175|\n|DarkComet|RECONN LLC|AS6870|Russia|89|\n|Bozok RAT|Google LLC|AS15169|United States|62|\n|njRAT|Crnogorski Telekom|AS8585|Montenegro|32|\n|REMCOS|Taiwan Academic Network|AS1659|Taiwan|14|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n   - Proactive detection creates an advantage for defenders, giving them\n\npreparatory time to ensure additional file- and network-based detections\n\nare in place.\n\n   - Recorded Future clients can rapidly identify infections by detecting IP\n\naddresses found in the Recorded Future Command and Control List.\n\n   - Recorded Future users can query any malware entity, using the source\n\nRecorded Future Command and Control List, to conduct similar research\n\nof their own.\n\n   - Employ detection-in-depth for common open source tooling via\n\ncorrelation searches for SIEMs for suspicious behaviors, YARA for\n\nsuspicious file contents, and SNORT for suspicious or malicious network\n\ntraffic.\n\n   - The detections for each family show the increased use of open source\n\ntools beyond just the families that get major publicity. These other\n\nfamilies should be prioritized for network and host-based detection in\n\nenterprise environments.\n\n   - The adoption of lesser-known open source tooling such as OctopusC2,\n\nMythic, and Covenant by APT and criminal adversaries highlights the\n\nneed for threat intelligence practitioners to track and evaluate use of\n\nthese tools.\n\n\n#### Outlook\n\nOver the next year, Recorded Future expects further adoption of open source\n\ntools that have recently gained popularity, specifically Covenant, Octopus C2,\n\nSliver, and Mythic. Three of [these](https://posts.specterops.io/apollo-and-mythic-a-myth-worth-retelling-207893ea8b51) [tools had graphical user interfaces,](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/GUI) [making](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant)\n\nthem easier to use for less experienced operators, and all four have verbose\n\n[documentation on their uses. These tools had rapid adoption after their releases](https://shells.systems/unveiling-octopus-the-pre-operation-c2-for-red-teamers/)\n\nand were used by both red teams and unauthorized actors. Despite expected gains\n\nby these open source frameworks, Cobalt Strike will very likely maintain its lead\n\natop our detections, due to its ubiquity and utility. Since the source code of the\n\n[framework has leaked, we anticipate even further adoption of Cobalt Strike by all](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alleged-source-code-of-cobalt-strike-toolkit-shared-online/)\n\nfacets of threat actors.\n\nWe also anticipate that, despite various publications detailing detection\n\nmethodologies, espionage-oriented actors are less likely to modify their server\nside components. Threat actors engaged in state-sponsored espionage will use\n\nwhatever tooling necessary to achieve their goals. If targeted organizations are\n\nunable to defend their network from tooling that has been disclosed, threat actors\n\nhave little motivation to pursue new capabilities. Financially motivated actors\n\nusing custom tooling, however, are very likely to respond to detections by either\n\nrebuilding their components (as was the case with BazarBackdoor and TrickBot\n\nactors) or introduce entirely new tooling (which FIN7 is known to do).\n\nDue to these factors, it is important to implement security controls and\n\nmitigations against these malware families. While proactive detection of the\n\ncommand and control servers can help prevent incidents, defense-in-depth\n\napproaches are recommended to detect intrusion activity on the victim host, at\n\nthe perimeter, and on the wire.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete security intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
