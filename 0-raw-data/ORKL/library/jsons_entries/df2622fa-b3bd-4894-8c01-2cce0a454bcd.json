In this entry, we describe its attack\nprocess using some of the examples we encountered.\n\nBy: Trend Micro Research January 26, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\nSodinokibi was first detected in April 2019 and linked to the retired GandCrab. From that point\n[on, Sodinokibi launched several high-profile attacks that continued throughout](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-sodinokibi-ransomware-group-adds-malvertising-as-delivery-technique)\n[2020, thus making a name for itself as one of the ransomware families that should be](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/ransomware)\nwatched out for. Here we describe Sodinokibi’s typical attack process.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nThe threat actors behind Sodinokibi typically hire a variety of affiliates for their initial\naccess. Their attacks often begin with familiar techniques like malspam emails with spearphishing links or attachments, RDP access that uses valid accounts, compromised websites,\nand exploits. They also use techniques that indicate their targeted approach.\n\n**_Initial access_**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed the use of several of these initial access techniques. For example, as with\n[campaigns, we saw the use of the CVE-2019-2725 vulnerability and observed an instance](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-2725)\nwhere Sodinokibi was loaded in the memory of PowerShell through reflective-load instead\nof binary execution. We also saw malspam that led to the use of a macro to download and\nexecute the malware.\n\n[CVE-2018-13379 and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379) [CVE-2019-11510 are also used by the malware, as well as](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510)\ncompromised valid accounts. This allows the threat actors to drop and execute other\ncomponents like the anti-antivirus, exfiltration tools, and finally Sodinokibi itself.\n\n**_Lateral movement and evasion tactics_**\n\nSodinokibi, like many ransomware families known today, have a targeted approach with\nregard to their campaigns. In line with this, we observed the use of RDP and PsExec for\nlateral movement — a sign of targeted attacks — to drop and execute other components and\nthe ransomware itself.\n\nWe also observed that PC Hunter and Process Hacker are used to terminate services or\nprocesses, especially those services and processes that are related to antivirus software.\n\nOnce the system is infected, Sodinokibi sends a report and system information to\nits command-and-control (C&C) server. It generates a pseudorandom URL based on a fixed\nformat and generation to add to a list of domains in its configuration.\n\nSecurity recommendations\n\nSodinokibi has been known to target high-profile entities and uses notable evasive tactics.\nOrganizations should, therefore, be wary of its techniques. For now, here are some best\npractices to prevent similar ransomware attacks:\n\nAvoid opening unverified emails or clicking on their embedded links, as these can start\nthe ransomware installation process.\nBack up your important files using the 3-2-1 rule: Create three backup copies on two\ndifferent file formats, with one of the backups in a separate location.\nRegularly update software, programs, and applications, to ensure that your apps are\ncurrent, with the latest protections from new vulnerabilities.\n\n[If you believe that your organization has been affected by this campaign, visit this page for](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000284483)\nthe available Trend Micro solutions that can help detect and mitigate any risks from this\ncampaign.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nSHA256 Detection name\n\n\n-----\n\n04ae146176632509ab5239d0ec8f2447d7223090 [Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.MRA](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.MRA)\n\n10682d08a18715a79ee23b58fdb6ee44c4e28c61 [Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIB.SMTH](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.SMTH)\n\n169abe89f4eab84275c88890460a655d647e5966 [Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIB.SMTH](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.SMTH/)\n\n20d90f04dcc07e1faa09aa1550f343c9472f7ec6 [Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIB.SMTH](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.SMTH/)\n\n2a75db73888c77e48b77b72d3efb33ab53ccb754 [Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.AUWUJDES](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/ae/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.AUWUJDES)\n\n\n58d835c3d204d012ee5a4e3c05a06e60b4\n316d0e\n\n\n[Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIB.SMTH](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.SMTH/)\n\n\nCe0c8814d7630f8636ffd73f8408a36dc0e1ca4d [Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIB.SMTH](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.SODINOKIBI.SMTH/)\n\n\n-----",
