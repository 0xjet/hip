The newly discovered custom](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/)\n**tool, codenamed SideWinder.AntiBot.Script, is being used in the gang’s phishing attack against Pakistani**\n**targets. Group-IB Threat Intelligence team shares its findings so that security teams can more effectively identify**\nSideWinder attacks.\n**Key findings**\n\n**Over the last year,** **[Group-IB Threat Intelligence system identified 92 IP addresses that have been used by](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-Intelligence-and-attribution/)**\n**SideWinder APT for phishing emails.**\n**Pakistan remains the primary target for SideWinder. The attackers are especially interested in the Pakistani**\n**government organizations based on the discovered phishing document and public studies.**\n\n**Phishing links in emails or posts that mimic legitimate notifications and services of government agencies**\n**and organizations in Pakistan are primary attack vectors of the gang.**\n\n**SideWinder started using an anti-bot script to filter their victims - they are only interested in Pakistani users.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The group continues to distribute malicious files in ZIP archives with an LNK file inside, which downloads an**\n**HTA file from a remote server.**\n\n**Upon discovery, Group-IB Threat Intelligence team notified relevant local authorities and shared its findings**\n**to make sure that the threat can be identified and contained at early stages. CERT-GIB also sent**\n**notifications to dedicated computer emergency response teams in Pakistan.**\n\n## SideWinder Profile\n\nThe SideWinder APT is believed to be an Indian nation-state threat actor. In their attacks, SideWinder was seen\ntargeting government, military, and economic sectors in Southeast Asia: in Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan,\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Singapore, and China. However, since the discovery of the group in 2012,\nPakistan has been the primary target of SideWinder. In the last year alone, several SideWinder’s attacks targeting\nPakistan have been detected. SideWinder was particularly interested in the Pakistani military targets.\n\n[The Pakistani government even published an official advisory about SideWinder activity:](https://cabinet.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/NTISB%20Advisories/2019/22-Advisory-No-22-2019.pdf)\n\nImage 1. Fragment of the official notification about SideWinder’s attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup IB researchers have repeatedly spotted phishing documents intended for Pakistani targets in public and\nprivate sector organizations.\n\nFor example, the following phishing document contains information about a proposal for a formal discussion of the\nimpact of US withdrawal from Afghanistan on maritime security:\n\nImage 2. Phishing document SHA-1: a74f9baa1791476c489942dd9e24c8c6fd0822cd\n\nIn addition, the group was seen cloning government websites to collect user credentials.\nBelow you can find a phishing page mimicking a government portal in Sri Lanka designed by SideWinder:\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: Phishing page login panel - http://5.2.79[.]135/!/n/\n\n## SideWinder Network Infrastructure\n\nOver the last year, Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence solution detected 92 IP addresses used by SideWinder. The\nservers were automatically detected by Group-IB and Threat Intelligence users immediately received a proactive\nnotification about the appearance of the new malicious infrastructure.\n\nThe analysis of the servers revealed that they were primarily used for phishing attacks. SideWinder’s phishing\nattacks will be covered later in the text in more detail.\n\nBelow is a summary of 2.56.245[.]21, one of SideWinder’s servers. According to Group-IB data, the server has been\nin use by SideWinder since at least January 22, 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 4: Network Indicators related to 2.56.245[.]21 Source: Group-IB Threat Intelligence\n\nThanks to Group-IB’s Network Graph Analysis tool, shown above, it was possible to discover that this address is\nused as the A-record for the following domains:\n\nfinance.pakgov[.]net;\nvpn.pakgov[.]net;\ncsd.pakgov[.]net;\nhajj.pakgov[.]net;\nnadra.pakgov[.]net;\npt.pakgov[.]net;\nflix.pakgov[.]net;\ncovid.pakgov[.]net.\n\nAs you may have guessed, these are all phishing domains mimicking legitimate domains of Pakistani governmental\nand non-governmental institutions, such as finance.gov.pk.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 5. A fragment of the network infrastructure associated with the SideWinder group. Source: Group-IB Threat\nIntelligence\n\n### Phishing categorization\n\nEach of the previously mentioned servers detected by Group-IB Threat Intelligence system mimic the public services\nrelated to Pakistan. Some of them are:\n\nWhile investigating these malicious domains, Group-IB researchers found a phishing link \"vpn.pakgov[.]net/Download-3b00fd1a\" - which redirects to a legitimate domain \"securevpn.com\". This may indicate\na temporary suspension of the malicious campaign or conversely the link could redirect to a malicious site in the\nfuture as part of a different campaign.\n\nImage 6. Screenshot with redirect to legitimate securevpn.com\n\nAlso among the discovered phishing links, Group-IB researchers found a link that downloaded an application from\n[the official Google Play store called \"SecureVPN\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220520104931/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.securedata.vpn)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 7. Screenshot from the Google Play store\n\nThe app in question looks suspicious: it has only 10+ downloads. It was published by the author, “ross jack”, with\n[only one project. Furthermore, the description of the application was copied from NordVPN's description:](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/nordvpn-%E2%80%93-vpn-proxy-for-p/fphgeikpdcdcheaochkhldmnfblfogla)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 8. Screenshot from the Microsoft Edge extension store\n\nTherefore, Group-IB researchers assume that the application most likely mimics the legitimate Secure VPN\napplication of the same name. At runtime, this application performs the following requests:\n\nhXXps://api.vpn-secure[.]co/secureVpn/;\nhXXps://api.vpn-secure[.]co/secureVpn/register;\n\nHowever, at the time of the research, they were unavailable, and a request to the root of the page redirects to the\nlegitimate NordVPN domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 9. Request to the root of the api.vpn-secure[.]co\n\n[In 2020, Trend Micro researchers found similar malicious apps that were attributed to the SideWinder group. These](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/a/first-active-attack-exploiting-cve-2019-2215-found-on-google-play-linked-to-sidewinder-apt-group.html)\napps were also uploaded to the Google Play Store. It is worth noting that at the time of writing we cannot confirm if\nthe Secure VPN app developed by \"ross jack\" is 100% malicious. This research is ongoing.\n\n## Kill Chain\n\nIn this section we will take a closer look at the infection chain. As in previous SideWinder’s attacks, it all starts with a\nphishing link:\n\nGroup-IB researchers also found malicious links posted on Facebook:\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 13. Screenshot of a malicious link on Facebook\n\nOnce the victim clicks on the link, an archive with a malicious .LNK file or RTF document is downloaded. In the case\nof LNK, the files have a Microsoft Word icon, making it appear more legitimate, encouraging people to open.\nWhether the initial vector was a phishing email or a phishing link posted on social media, the malicious payload is\nalways launched using the DLL side-loading technique, which provides persistence and has RAT functionality.\n\nAs soon as the recipient clicks on the link, the new tool, dubbed SideWinder.AntiBot.Script by Group-IB researchers,\ncomes into play. The script checks the client browser environment and, based on several parameters, decides\nwhether to issue a malicious file or redirect to a legitimate resource.\n\nFor example, let's take finance.pakgov[.]net which we have described a little already.\nThe phishing link appears as follows - hxxps://finance.pakgov[.]net/salary-a4222e91.\nLet's first see what happens if we try to follow this link with settings different from a typical Pakistani user.\n\nImage 14. Screenshot with hxxps://finance.pakgov[.]net/salary-a4222e91 request and redirect to legitimate\nfinance.gov.pk\n\nAs you can see in the screenshot above, when a client visits this link, which the anti-bot script does not like, the\nscript redirects to a legitimate document located on a legitimate resource: finance.gov.pk. And, the script won't even\nwork if the client's IP address differs from Pakistan's - the client will automatically be redirected to the legitimate\nresource. These are common techniques that are used to avoid detection by threat researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 15. Redirect to a legitimate document.\n\nHowever, if you follow a link with an IP address from Pakistan, the anti-bot script will work.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 16. SideWinder.AntiBot.Script snippet (the full version of the script is available below in the list of indicators of\ncompromise)\n\nTo begin with, the CAPTCHA page immediately catches the eye. While the user is waiting, the client's browser is\nprofiled to give the final verdict.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 17. Screenshot of fake CloudFlare page\n\nIf the client does not pass the anti-bot script filtering, for example, by the parameter of the operating system used,\nthen a corresponding message will be displayed.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 18. Screenshot of the platform compatibility error.\n\n### Detection of a client's browser environment\n\nThe script is written to collect everything it can reach to verify that the user is not a researcher or a security solution\nattempting to detect malicious code:\n\nGeo-position - check;\n\nImage 19. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nVersion of the operating system - check;\nData about the user agent - check;\nSystem language settings - check;\nThe number of logical processors - check;\nAccessing the [CredentialsContainer interface, which can return saved passwords from the browser if the](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer)\nnecessary function is called. (not used );\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 20. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nA feature that avoids automatic analysis using the Headless version of Chrome - check;\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 21. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nA list of possible video cards used and checking their compliance with the screen size. (Images 22 and 23):\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 24. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nCheck for compliance with operating systems from the list:\n\nImage 25. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nAnd most importantly, the function of issuing a malicious file and the function to redirect to a legitimate\nresource.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 26. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nHowever, in another script found on another malicious domain - finance.govpk-mail[.]net - the redirect function still\nled to a link with a payload:\n\nImage 27. A snippet of SideWinder.AntiBot.Script\n\nAccordingly, the structure of network requests on this domain is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 28. Screenshot with network requests\n\nThe screenshot above shows link clicks from the initial phishing link - hxxps://finance.govpkmail[.]net/financecircular-38149cbd to the page with the script, which is responsible for releasing the malicious file:\n\nImage 29 A piece of malicious code that issues a payload\n\n\n-----\n\n### Payload\n\nIn one case the downloadable file (SHA1- 4421f214c91a08ac0318871c6f918cfffe36d039) was an archive named\n\"Pay and Pension Increase Circular_Finance Division.zip\"\n\nThe contents of this archive consist of files:\n\n64a889e35b10a902170abe092c6c6b8f16c66dd1 - Pay and Pension Increase Circular_Finance\nDivision.pdf.lnk;\n5e5e038453fde5ddf57820783dd9ce8f5f042df2 - ~wnotification002.tmp;\n6a99ce5387c5b67602b2ef633bfbdc184e4d845c - ~wnotification003.tmp.\n\nImage 30. Contents of \"Pay and Pension Increase Circular_Finance Division.zip\n\n\"Pay and Pension Increase Circular_Finance Division.pdf.lnk\" is a shortcut that contains a command to download\nand execute the file hxxps://finance.govpkmail[.]net/15523/1/12443/2/0/0/1/1874254181/79DWxM3xhqvyZapU4oq7D3M8j5wB6f4HVHnbIEc/files60b6e42b/hta using MSHTA.\n\nImage 31. Contents of \"Pay and Pension Increase Circular_Finance Division.pdf.lnk\n\nUnfortunately, the second stage of the payload turned out to be inactive, so we got a \"404 Not Found\" error.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 32. Screenshot of the error receiving the second stage of the payload.\n\nHowever, this attack is not unique to SideWinder. HTAs typically contain PowerShell, VBScript, or JavaScript, and\nthe latter has been seen more often in recent attacks.\n\nHTAs are typically used to download files for later use by the DLL-sideloading technique. In some cases, HTAs also\nupload a decoy document, usually in PDF format, to put the victim's attention down.\n\n[The use of this technique by this group was mentioned publicly by researchers from Sangfor Qianlimu Security Lab.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kkta59k7r81uIBjJvE9pCw)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Image 33. Fragment of Kill Chain taken from https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kkta59k7r81uIBjJvE9pCw](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kkta59k7r81uIBjJvE9pCw)\n\nWhen using this technique, HTA will load the \"Duser.dll\" file and copy the system file \"credwiz.exe\" into the same\ndirectory. The \"credwiz.exe\" loads \"Duser.dll\" with the Dll Side-Loading technique, which in turn downloads and\nexecutes the final backdoor. The final backdoor allows the attacker:\n\nCollect system information;\nCollect list of files and paths to them;\nCollect selected files;\nUpdate commands and C2 addresses.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the SideWinder’s widespread activity deploying new command and control servers and the number of\nobserved phishing links, Group-IB Threat Intelligence team decided to publish these findings so that potential targets\nin Pakistan identified as part of the research could check their networks and identify attacks by Sidewinder that are\nin early stages.
