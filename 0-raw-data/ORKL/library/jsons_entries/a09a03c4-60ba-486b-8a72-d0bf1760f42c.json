As a result**\n**of the attack, access to the Diia platform, which is the equivalent of the Polish mObywatel application,**\n**was also cut off. An initial vector that allowed the attacker to take control over the above-mentioned**\n**resources was the vulnerability of the October CMS application, used to manage the content of the**\n**websites.**\nThe content of the defacement was published simultaneously in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. The content of\nthe prepared message used the theme of the Volhynia massacre and historical, controversial issues that may\nhave negatively affect bilateral relations between Poland and Ukraine. In-depth analyses, the first results of\nwhich were published on January 15, 2022, showed that the compromise of websites was also aimed at\ndistracting attention from the activities involving in the use of malware by the adversary, the purpose of which\nwas to destroy data on the infected device. The exact scale of the damage is currently unknown, but the\ninformation shows that the same malware samples were also detected in many government organizations, nonprofit organizations and private companies’ networks in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection, nearly 70\nUkrainian websites (domestic and international) were attacked on January 13-14, 2022. As a result of these\nattacks, numerous websites in the gov.ua domain were compromised (as of January 14, 2022):\n\nGovernment services portal \"Diia\" - diia.gov.ua (unavailable),\nCabinet of Ministers - kmu.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs - mfa.gov.ua (defaced, unavailable),\n\n\n-----\n\nState Rescue Service dsns.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Education and Science - mon.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Youth and Sport - sport.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Energy - mpe.kmu.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Agrarian Policy - minagro.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Veterans Affairs - mva.gov.ua (unavailable),\nMinistry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources - mepr.gov.ua (unavailable),\nState Treasury Service - treasury.gov.ua (unavailable);\n\nOther sites likely to be affected by this attack (status unknown):\n\nState Register of Court Orders - reyestr.court.gov.ua\nMinistry of Territories and Communities Development - minregion.gov.ua\nState Service for Special Communications and Information Protection - new.cip.gov.ua,\nSupreme Court of Ukraine - supreme.court.gov.ua,\nHigh Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine - hcac.court.gov.ua,\n\"Court system\" official portal - court.gov.ua,\nNational Civil Service Agency - nads.gov.ua,\nState Inspectorate of Nuclear Supervision - snriu.gov.ua,\nlocal authorities of Rivne - rv.gov.ua,\nlocal authorities of Transcarpathia - carpathia.gov.ua,\nlocal authorities of Donetsk - dn.gov.ua,\nState Agency for Forest Resources - forest.gov.ua,\nMinistry of Strategic Industry - mspu.gov.ua,\nlocal authorities of Mukachevo - mukachevo-rada.gov.ua,\nSocial Protection Fund for the Disabled - ispf.gov.ua,\nMunicipal Enterprise \"KyivTeploEnergo\" - teplo.org.ua,\nAntimonopoly Committee of Ukraine - amcu.gov.ua,\nNational Sports Committee of People with Disabilities - paralympic.org.ua,\nState Sea and River Transport Service - marad.gov.ua,\nlocal authorities of Dnipro - adm.dp.gov.ua,\nUkrainian State Center for Radio Frequencies - ucrf.gov.ua.\n\n[On January 14, 2022 the Ukrainian CERT issued a statement[1]](https://cert.gov.ua/article/17899) which describes that, after preliminary analysis,\nit was determined that the probable attack vector was the vulnerability of the Octobercms platform used to\nmanage the content of websites (CVE-2021-32648). Octobercms is a CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP\nframework. In vulnerable versions of the October package, an attacker could request for an account password\nreset and then access it with a specially crafted request. The bug has been fixed in Build 472 and v1.1.5.\n\nA graphic file (index.jpeg) containing content written in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish was published on\ncompromised websites where the content of the page was changed (Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe metadata of the above image file contained the following coordinates:\n\nLatitude: 52° 12' 31.1'' N,\n\nLongitude: 21° 0' 33.9'' E,\n\nGPS : 52.208630, 21.009427.\n\nThe above geographical data indicate a car park of the Warsaw School of Economics (Figure 2). However, it\nshould be remembered that the graphic file in question, which appeared on the compromised pages, is not a\nphoto, so the above geographical data was probably added manually.\n\n\n-----\n\n[On January 15, 2022, Microsoft published a report[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/) in which it describes that the Microsoft Threat Intelligence\nCenter (MSTIC) identified an operation involving the use of malicious software by an adversary (DEV-0586),\naimed at destroying data on an infected device. The report indicates that the use of malware is related to a\nlarge-scale campaign targeting Ukrainian government entities and IT companies that are engaged in\n[maintaining Ukrainian government websites[3]. The malware described in the report first appeared on the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/01/15/mstic-malware-cyberattacks-ukraine-government/)\nsystems of Ukrainian victims on January 13, 2022. MSTIC estimates that malware (which is designed to\nappear ransomware) does not actually have a data recovery mechanism. So it was created for destructive\npurposes (wiper), the effect of which is to prevent the operation of target devices.\n\nAt the moment, the exact attribution is not known, however, according to the Deputy Secretary of the National\nSecurity and Defense Council of Ukraine (Serhiy Demediuk), the UNC1151 group may be responsible for the\nattack, and the malware used to destroy data resembles the tools used by the APT29 group, associated with\n[the Russian SVR[4].](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-ukraine-suspects-group-linked-belarus-intelligence-over-cyberattack-2022-01-15/)\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the fact that the attacker prepared metadata in the graphic file used for defacement.\nThe location hidden under the given coordinates indicates the area of the Warsaw School of Economics. CSIRT\nMON suspects that the real intention of the adversary was to use the geolocation of the General Staff of the\nPolish Army to lead potential analysts and public opinion to a false, controversial trail.\n\n\nDue to the situation in Ukraine, the CSIRT MON team warns about the potential risk of extending the attack to\nother countries in the region.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe CSIRT MON team recommends intensifying activities leading to the security of ICT systems used to\nprovide key services and constituting critical infrastructure.\n\nFor this purpose, it is recommended:\n\n[1. Implementation of recommendations contained in the Mandiant report[5], reducing the risk of infection with](https://www.mandiant.com/media/14506/download)\nthe software used in this attack.\n2. Analyzing own resources in terms of the presence of IoCs included in this announcement, as well as\n\nongoing updating of signatures used by security tools such as antivirus software, EDR, IDS, IPS, etc.\n3. In-depth monitoring of the security of ICT systems, in particular analyzing alerts generated by security\n\ntools such as antivirus software, EDR, IDS, IPS, firewalls, e-mail protection systems, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Installing the latest security patches for all elements of the ICT infrastructure (including operating systems,\n\napplication software, network devices) giving the highest priority to vulnerabilities that are actively\n[exploited[6].](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n5. The use of multi-factor authentication in access control mechanisms, in particular for e-mail and critical\n\nresources.\n6. Verification of the computer incident response plan and the resulting procedures.\n7. Maintaining backup copies and verification of procedures allowing to restore the ICT system after a\n\ncomputer incident.\n8. Reporting to the appropriate CSIRT team identified computer incidents that may have been caused by\n\nattacks.\n\nAny new information on this subject will be updated on a regular basis.\n\nUpdate of 18.01.2022 at 4:00 p.m.\n\n\nOn January 17, 2022, the Ukrainian SBU service reported that 95% of all attacked websites had been restored\n[to operation[7]. In connection with the above-described attack, CSIRT MON together with CSIRT NASK and](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-narazi-vidnovleno-robotu-95-saitiv-shcho-postrazhdaly-vid-kiberataky-na-derzhavni-resursy)\nCSIRT GOV is working on the analysis of malware used for this attack. The preliminary findings show that\nmalware consists of at least 3 different modules (executable files) that are launched on the victim's computer in\n[a strictly defined order. The first module, called PAYWIPE[8],is malware disguised as ransomware. The following](https://csirt-mon.wp.mil.pl/pl/articles6-aktualnosci/analiza-cyberataku-na-ukrainskie-zasoby-rzadowe/Wed%C5%82ug%20nomenklatury%20firmy%20Mandiant)\ninformation is presented to infected victims, urging them to pay a ransom.\n\nYour hard drive has been corrupted.\n\nIn case you want to recover all hard drives\n\nof your organization,\n\nYou should pay us $10k via bitcoin wallet\n\n1AVNM68gj6PGPFcJuftKATa4WLnzg8fpfv and send message via\n\ntox ID\n8BEDC411012A33BA34F49130D0F186993C6A32DAD8976F6A5D82C1ED23054C057ECED5496F65\n\nwith your organization name.\n\nWe will contact you to give further instructions.\n\nIn fact, this malware is a wiper, so there are no functionalities implemented in it that allow you to restore the\nsystem to its original form. This module is designed to overwrite the Master Boot Record, which results in the\ndeletion of information about system partitions and prevents the operating system from starting after reboot.\n\n\n[Another module called WHISPERGATE[9]](https://csirt-mon.wp.mil.pl/pl/articles6-aktualnosci/analiza-cyberataku-na-ukrainskie-zasoby-rzadowe/Wed%C5%82ug%20nomenklatury%20firmy%20Microsoft%20oraz%20Mandiant) [is designed to download the next module called FINETIDE[10]](https://csirt-mon.wp.mil.pl/pl/articles6-aktualnosci/analiza-cyberataku-na-ukrainskie-zasoby-rzadowe/Wed%C5%82ug%20nomenklatury%20firmy%20Mandiant) using\nthe resources uploaded by the adversary to Discord communication platform. The addresses of malicious\nresources hosted on Discord are listed in a table with indicators of compromise. The WHISPERGATE module is\nan application written in .NET. Downloading malicious content from Discord resources is preceded by running\nthe Sleep command for 10 seconds by a PowerShell application with base64-encoded arguments. This\noperation is done to avoid potential detection mechanisms on the attacked machine. The FINETIDE module is\ndownloaded as a file with a JPEG extension, while the task of WHISPERGATE is to read all bytes from the end\nto the beginning of the JPEG file and save them to a new DLL file. WHISPERGATE then executes a malicious\n[DLL file (FINETIDE module) that is obfuscated using the Eazfuscator software[11].](https://www.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net)\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are three resources available within the DLL file. At the moment, only one of the resources has been\nanalyzed. The analysis showed that it consists of the AdvancedRun and Waqybg module. The AdvancedRun\n[module is a tool from Nirsoft[12], which is used in this case to disable Windows Defender, while the Waqybg](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/advanced_run.html)\nmodule damages files with the following extensions by modifying their content and extension.\n\n.

In\naddition, according to the above-mentioned sources, the government websites were also compromised as a\nresult of the takeover of the accounts of employees of the IT service provider that provided services to the\nUkrainian government. In addition, the Cyber Police of Ukraine noted DDoS attacks on a number of Ukrainian\ngovernment entities.\n\n## Update of January 20, 2022 at 3:00 p.m.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsidering the fact that the recent attacks on Ukrainian government websites exploited CVE 2021 32648\nvulnerability (related to the OctoberCMS content management system), there is a risk of further exploitation of\nthis software vulnerability..\nIn order to prevent the use of CVE-2021-32648 vulnerability, as well as to introduce additional security\nmeasures, it is recommended to:\n1. Update October CMS to the latest version.\n\n2. Allow access to the CMS login panel only through a trusted point-to-point connection or from a specific IP\naddress.\n\n3. Implement two-factor authentication login process.\n\n4. Change the path to the OctoberCMS login panel from the default (/backend/*) to another path, which\nconsists of a string of pseudo-random characters.\n\n5.
