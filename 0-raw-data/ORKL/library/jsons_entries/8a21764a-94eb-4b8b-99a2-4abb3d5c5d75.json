    "plain_text": "# “A grim outlook”: How cyber surveillance is booming on a global scale\n\n**[technologyreview.com/2021/11/08/1039395/grim-outlook-cyber-boom-atlantic-council-report/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/08/1039395/grim-outlook-cyber-boom-atlantic-council-report/)**\n\nPatrick Howell O'Neill\n\nThe increasing overlap between the world’s arms trade and the secretive surveillance\nindustry risks damaging US national security and will create the potential for even more\nabuse unless more accountability is introduced, according to a new study.\n\nThe [research, from the American think tank the Atlantic Council, offers one of the most](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/surveillance-technology-at-the-fair/)\nthorough accountings ever assembled of a booming, cross-continental surveillance industry\nthat makes billions of dollars and yet mostly manages to stay out of the limelight. After years\nof rising demand for hacker-for-hire products and an increase in reported abuses by\n[companies like NSO Group, countries around the world are now trying to deal with this](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/28/1030244/israel-investigation-nso-group-pegasus-spyware/)\nlargely hidden industry.\n\nThe report is based on 20 years of data collected from the cyber surveillance trade show ISS\nWorld and arms fairs like France’s [Milipol, where hacking is the fastest-growing business](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/25/131837/champagne-shotguns-and-surveillance-at-spywares-grand-bazaar/)\nsegment alongside more traditional wares like guns and tanks. Its authors examined 224\nsurveillance companies present at these shows, looked at their marketing material,\nexamined where in the world they advertised their products, and detailed the known sales of\nsurveillance and hacking tools.\n\n## Related Story\n\n\n-----\n\n[This US company sold iPhone hacking tools to UAE spies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/15/1035813/us-sold-iphone-exploit-uae/)\n\nAn American cybersecurity company was behind a 2016 iPhone hack sold to a group of\nmercenaries and used by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThey also argue that numerous companies that market internationally, especially to\nadversaries of NATO, are “irresponsible proliferators” and deserve more attention from\npolicymakers.\n\nThese companies include Israel’s Cellebrite, which develops phone hacking and forensics\ntools, and which sells around the world to countries including the US, Russia, and China.\nThe company has already faced significant blowback because of, for example, its role during\n[China’s crackdown in Hong Kong and the discovery that its technology was being used by a](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/25/1007617/israeli-phone-hacking-company-faces-court-fight-over-sales-to-hong-kong/)\n[Bangladeshi “death squad.”](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT-israeli-cellebrite-sold-spy-tech-to-bangladesh-death-squad-1.9603377)\n\n“When these firms begin to sell their wares to both NATO members and adversaries,” the\nreport says, “it should provoke national security concerns by all customers.”\n\nThe trade is increasingly global, according to the report, with 75% of companies selling cyber\nsurveillance and intrusion products outside their own home continent. Lead author Winnona\nDeSombre, a fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative, argues that such\nsales signal potential problems with oversight.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere does not seem to be a willingness to self-regulate for a majority of these firms, she\nsays.\n\nBy marking such firms as “irresponsible proliferators,” DeSombre hopes to encourage\nlawmakers around the world to target some companies for greater regulation.\n\n“When these firms begin to sell their wares to both NATO members and adversaries, it\nshould provoke national security concerns by all customers.”\n\nGovernments have recently made moves toward some forms of control. The EU adopted\nstricter rules on surveillance tech last year, with the goal of increasing industry transparency.\n[And within the last month, the US has enacted stricter new licensing rules for selling intrusion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html)\ntools. The notorious Israeli spyware company NSO Group was one of several companies\nadded to a US blacklist because of allegations that spyware it supplied to foreign\ngovernments was then used to maliciously target government officials, journalists,\nbusinesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers. NSO has consistently denied\n[wrongdoing and argued that it strictly investigates abuse and shuts off offending customers.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/19/1006458/nso-spyware-controversy-pegasus-human-rights/)\n\nNevertheless, one of the report’s authors says it is important to realize the true scale of what\nis happening.\n\n“The most basic takeaway from this paper is that we are dealing with an industry,” says\nJohann Ole Willers, a fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) Centre\nfor Cyber Security Studies. “That is a fundamental insight. It’s not enough to target NSO\nGroup.”\n\n### UN warning\n\n[United Nations human rights experts recently raised alarms about what they called “growing](https://www.ohchr.org/SP/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27729&LangID=E)\nuse of mercenaries in cyberspace.”\n\n“It is undeniable that cyber-activities have the ability to cause violations both in armed\nconflicts and in peacetime, and thus that a whole variety of rights are engaged,” Jelena\nAparac, chair of a United Nations working group on the issue, said in a statement. The group\ncalled on international lawmakers to more effectively regulate the industry in order to protect\n“the right to life, economic social rights, freedom of expression, privacy, and the right to selfdetermination.”\n\nOne obstacle is that the cyber surveillance industry is rife with obfuscation: shell companies\nand resellers are common, and both sellers and buyers use a host of tools to hide their\ninteractions.\n\n“There is not enough knowledge about the industry in the public, where you can delineate\nthe irresponsible firms from the responsible,” says DeSombre.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The report points to the recent indictment of former US intelligence personnel who had been](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/15/1035813/us-sold-iphone-exploit-uae/)\nworking for the United Arab Emirates as evidence that capabilities first developed by friendly\ngovernments can end up being used for other spying purposes. The hacking tools and\nexpertise developed by US agencies were then used by the UAE to spy on hundreds of\ntargets, including Americans.\n\n### Use and abuse\n\nThe researchers have some suggestions for how governments might learn to understand\nand control this growing ecosystem. They recommend enacting stronger “know your\ncustomer” requirements for the industry, so that every seller will better understand how\npotential customers might use—or abuse—a hacking tool.\n\n## Related Story\n\n[Inside the FBI, Russia, and Ukraine’s failed cybercrime investigation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/08/1027999/fbi-russia-ukraine-cybercrime-investigation-ransomware/)\n\nRussia and Ukraine promised to cooperate and help catch the world’s most successful\nhackers. But things didn’t quite go to plan.\n\nThe researchers argue that NATO countries, which host many prominent cyber surveillance\ntrade events, should limit the attendance of irresponsible vendors at arms fairs. They also\nencourage more international cooperation to rid export laws of loopholes that allow vendors\nto [evade controls and sell to authoritarian regimes. Finally, they encourage naming and](http://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/4/10/how-the-dual-use-ruse-is-employed-to-sell-spyware.)\nshaming irresponsible sellers and buyers.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis indicates that there exists a significant group of private companies willing to act\nirresponsibly: marketing capabilities that carry the risk of becoming tools of oppression for\nauthoritarian regimes or strategic tools for non–NATO allies,” the report concludes.\n\nWithout such actions, it warns, the world faces a “grim outlook”: “a growing number of private\ncorporations who see few consequences to bolstering the cyber arsenals of major Western\nadversaries, only profit.”\n\n\n-----",
