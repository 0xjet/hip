Since this is my first post in this forum, initially I would like to thank all the members\nfor their invaluable input and help.\n\n\n-----\n\nYesterday one of our computers, a Win7 machine was infected with a ransomware resulting\nin all files being encrypted with \".encrypted\" extension. Many of the files were backed up on\nan external hdd 4TB, which unfortunately was also left connected to the PC overnight. UAC\nwas disabled on the machine and Sophos apparently wasn't able to do much. The PC had\nalso RDP enabled default ports and weak pass... yep I know\nThankfully when the user woke up his PC in the morning, the first thing he did was\ndisconnecting the external hdd so not all the files were encrypted in there (too many files and\nmany large ones like videos etc. I presume).\n\nI'm not a very tech savvy person, so after bypassing dhe \"lockscreen\" through Safe Mode, I\ntried to identify the ransomeware through HitmanPro and Malwarebytes with not much luck.\nAll I could find were some WinIo32.sys, winlogon.exe and conhost.exe files apparently\nmalicious identified as Trojan.backdoors.\n\nAfter that I tried to identify the threat online through ID Ransomware by uploading the text file\nand one encrypted file.\nI got 2 results: potentially Apocalypse or Smrss32.\n\nI tried both Emsisoft and AVG Apocalypse decryptors on the files with no success. Emsisot\nsays \"apparently the files are not encrypted\", while AVG returns 0 decryptions. The text files\nappears to be more like the one of Apocalyspse than the Smrss32 one I see here. However I\nthink I'm left with with Smrss32 as the only remaining option\n\nCan anyone suggest another identification method to be certain if it is or not Smrss32? There\nwas no c:\\encrypted folder on my PC from what I see here.\nThanks in advance guys.\nP.S. - At least around 7.500 files were also encrypted on the external backup HDD.\n\n**Edited by Praetorians, 17 August 2016 - 04:19 AM.**\n\nBack to top\n\n## #9  quietman7\n\nBleepin' Gumshoe\n\nGlobal Moderator\n59,518 posts\nOFFLINE\n\n\n-----\n\nGender:Male\nLocation:Virginia, USA\nLocal time:09:31 PM\n\nPosted 17 August 2016 - 05:50 AM (2016-08-17T06:50:44-04:00)\n\n...Can anyone suggest another identification method to be certain if it is or not\nSmrss32?
