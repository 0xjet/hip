But you already knew that.\n\nTechnical novices, along with seasoned cybersecurity professionals, have witnessed over the\npast year a slew of ransomware events that have devastated enterprises around the world.\nEven those outside of cybersecurity are now familiar with the concept: criminals behind a\nkeyboard have found a way into an organization’s system, prevented anyone from actually\nusing it by locking it up, and won’t let anyone resume normal activity until the organization\npays a hefty fee.\n\nAs economies around the world teeter on the edge of disaster as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, the onslaught of ransomware attacks in 2020 has compounded civil society’s\nability to carry on business as usual. Corporations, governments, schools and everything in\nbetween have constantly been in the crosshairs of underground criminal groups, often left\nwith very little recourse if they find their systems have been locked.\n\nThat lack of recourse doesn’t mean there’s an absence of effort to beat the bad guys. But even\nfor seasoned professionals, it’s a challenge to measure and quantify just how bad\nransomware has gotten. While incidents continue to come to light, there is a lot the\ncybersecurity industry doesn’t know: the volume of attacks, average cost of remediation and\norganizations who choose to stay silent once an attack has occurred.\n\nWhat is known is that the criminal groups behind ransomware are flourishing, creating new\nvariants and offering access on underground markets to anyone that has access to corporate\nnetworks and a desire to make a substantial amount of illicit money. Intel 471 has been\ntracking over 25 different ransomware-as-a-service crews over the past year, ranging from\nwell-known groups that have become synonymous with ransomware, to newly-formed\nvariants that have risen from the failures of old, to completely new variants that may have the\nability to unseat the current top-level cabals.\n\nThe following is an examination of Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) crews that have grown\nover the past year. This is not meant to be a definitive measure of the ransomware scene, as\nwhat could be considered “damaging” — payment amount, system downtime,\ncommunications with attackers — could vary by crew or incident. Additionally, there are\nknown private gangs operating in tight, close-knit criminal circles using direct and private\ncommunication channels that we have little visibility into.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat we are aiming to do is shine light on an area where relative darkness has led to a\nstaggering amount of criminals running roughshod over enterprises, escaping with people’s\nhard-earned money while facing very limited consequences. By speaking publicly on these\noperations, society as a whole can get a better understanding of the rising problem at hand.\n\n**TIER 3: Emerging RaaS Crews**\n\nWe can verify that the following variants have been created and are being sold on a RaaS\nmodel, but at the present time, there is limited to no information on successful attacks,\nvolume of attacks, payments received or cost of mitigation.\n\n\n**Name** **Date Discovered**\n\n\n**Notable**\n**Incidents** **Markets Sold** **Blog**\n\n\nCVartek.u45 March 2020 None Torum No\n\nExorcist July 2020 None XSS No\n\nGothmog July 2020 None Exploit No\n\nLolkek July 2020 None XSS No\n\nMuchlove April 2020 None XSS No\n\nNemty September 2020 None XSS Yes\n\nRush July 2020 None XSS No\n\nWally February 2020 None Nulled No\n\n\nXINOF July 2020 None Private Telegram\nchannel\n\n\nNo\n\n\nZeoticus 1.0 Dec. 2019, 2.0 Sept\n2020\n\n**TIER 2: Rising Powers**\n\n\nNone XSS/Private channels No\n\n\nThe following variants have been tied to a number of confirmed attacks, the frequency of\nwhich have grown over 2020. A number of these variants have utilized blogs to “name and\nshame” victims who have refused to pay ransoms.\n\n**Name** **Date Discovered** **Attack claims** **Markets Sold** **Blog**\n\nAvaddon March 2020 Under 10 Exploit Yes\n\nConti August 2020 142 Private Yes\n\nClop March 2020 Over 10 N/A Yes\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide August 2020 Under 5 Exploit Yes\n\nPysa/Mespinoza August 2020 Over 40 N/A Yes\n\nRagnar December 2019 Over 25 Exploit Yes\n\nRanzy October 2020 1 Exploit & XSS Yes\n\nSunCrypt October 2019 Over 20 Mazafaka Yes\n\nThanos August 2020 Over 5 Raid No\n\n**TIER 1: Most Wanted**\n\nThese variants are among the most utilized, constantly showing up in enterprises that have\nbeen publicly linked to an attack. The variants are often iterations of past RaaS operations\nthat were either shut down or broken up by law enforcement. All of these variants have\nutilized blogs to “name and shame” victims who have refused to pay ransoms. In all, these\nvariants have pulled in hundreds of millions in ransoms -- a figure that may be low due to the\nlack of reporting surrounding enterprises payment to crews.\n\n**DoppelPaymer**\n\nDoppelPaymer, around since 2019, is associated with the BitPaymer aka FriedEx\nransomware. CrowdStrike has highlighted some similarities between those variants,\nspeculating that DoppelPaymer might be the work of the former BitPaymer group members.\n\nThe ransomware itself is usually deployed manually after a network is compromised and\nsensitive data is exfiltrated. The DoppelPaymer team operates a Tor-based “Dopple leaks”\nblog, which is used to publish information about compromised companies and their stolen\ndata.\n\nThe crew is behind such notable attacks as those on Mexican energy giant Pemex and an IT\ncontractor that works with the U.S. federal government.\n\nThe most known and discussed victim of DoppelPaymer ransomware is one against\nDüsseldorf University Clinic in September 2020. The actors actually wanted to target the\nDüsseldorf University and addressed it in the ransom note, but ended up hitting the hospital.\nWhen the perpetrators were made aware, they sent a digital key to get the hospital up and\nrunning again.\n\nDoppelPaymer has been used in over 125 ransomware incidents in 2020.\n\n**Egregor/Maze**\n\n\n-----\n\nAs this report was being published, the crew behind the Maze ransomware service\nannounced it was shutting down its operations. There has been speculation that this group’s\naffiliates will likely be funneled into the services behind Egregor ransomware. Egregor\nfollows a familiar pattern in its operations: Compromise corporate networks to steal sensitive\ndata and deploy ransomware, communicate with victims and demand ransoms, then dump\nsensitive data on a blog when victim organizations refuse to pay the ransom.\n\nThere is evidence that Egregor is also linked to Sekhmet ransomware. Intel 471 researchers\nfound Egregor contained the same Base64 encoded data as Sekhmet where the last row\ncontained additional parameters from a compromised system. Researchers also found that\nEgregor ransom notes were strikingly similar to ones used with Sekhmet.\n\nEgregor was found in incidents at Crytek, Ubisoft and Barnes & Noble.\n\nIntel 471 found that Maze was used in over 250 ransomware incidents in 2020. Egregor was\nused in more than 200 incidents.\n\n**Netwalker**\n\nFirst detected in September 2019, NetWalker is one of the more prolific affiliate services Intel\n471 has tracked. The actors behind it have spent 2020 using phishing emails that leverage the\nimpact and fear of the COVID-19 pandemic to lure victims into loading their malware onto\nsystems. In May, the operators launched a Tor-based blog to release sensitive data stolen\nfrom victim organizations that refused to pay the requested ransom.\n\nThe actors used a fileless infection technique and allegedly could bypass the user account\ncontrol component of Windows 7 and newer operating systems. NetWalker could be operated\nin two modes: In “network mode,” individual computers or the entire network could be held\nfor ransom and the victim could purchase a decryption tool with a master key or buy the\nnecessary keys to decrypt certain computers. In “individual mode”, a ransom was demanded\nfor a single computer at a time.\n\nThe most high-profile target hit by Netwalker is Michigan State University, which refused to\npay the ransom.\n\nNetwalker has been tied to 143 ransomware incidents in 2020.\n\n**REvil**\n\nOne of the most ubiquitous ransomware variants on the market, deployments of REvil first\nwere observed on April 17, 2019, where attackers leveraged a vulnerability in Oracle\nWebLogic servers tracked as CVE-2019-2725. Two months later, advertisements started\npopping up on the XSS forum.\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil has been one of the most active ransomware gangs in recent memory, claiming](https://intel471.com/blog/changes-in-revil-ransomware-version-2-2/)\n[responsibility for such attacks as those on U.K.-based financial service provider Travelex,](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/02/travelex-malware/)\n[U.S.-based entertainment and media law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks and 23 local](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-data-ransomware-grubman-law-firm-madonna-2020-5)\ngovernments in Texas.\n\nOne of the most common ways the group gains access to organizations is through remote\n[desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, such as the BlueGate vulnerability, which allows](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-exploits-created-recently-patched-bluegate-windows-server-flaws)\nremote code execution by an authorized user. The representative admittedly preferred to use\ninformation stealers to obtain remote access credentials, which are then used to secure an\ninitial foothold in company networks. In the case of the Travelex and Grubman Shire\nMeiselas & Sacks attacks, the representative said networks were compromised by exploiting\n[outdated Citrix and Pulse Secure remote access software, with the actors allegedly gaining](https://www.cyberscoop.com/citrix-vulnerability-backdoor-fireeye/)\naccess to an entire network in \"about three minutes.\"\n\nWhile the group carries out attacks on its own, it has found the RaaS model brings back more\nmoney. Affiliates are responsible for gaining access to target networks, downloading valuable\nfiles and deploying the actual ransomware, while the REvil gang handles victim negotiations\nand blackmailing, ransom collection and distribution. This model has apparently led to\nskyrocketing profits: according to the REvil representative, one affiliate's earnings rose from\nabout US$20,000 to US $30,000 per target with another RaaS offering to about US $7\nmillion to $8 million per target in only six months after joining forces with REvil.\n\nIntel 471 has linked REvil to 230 ransomware attacks in 2020.\n\n**Ryuk**\n\nThe name “Ryuk” could arguably be categorized as synonymous with ransomware, as the\nvariant is one of the most popular, with a strong affiliate program and a large list of victims.\n\nIt is often delivered as the last action in the chain of infections brought on by dueling use of\nthe Trickbot botnet and Emotet malwares. (Intel 471 has previously covered that\nrelationship.) Recently, we have also witnessed that Ryuk is delivered through the Bazar\nloader.\n\nAffiliates follow a model in their attacks: Hiring actors to launch spam campaigns to deliver\nthe actor's banking malware. Then, another set of actors conduct privilege escalation attacks\nwithin compromised corporate networks. Then, teams of as many of five deploy the\nransomware and handle negotiations with victims.\n\nRyuk has exploded over the past year, responsible for millions of ransomware incidents\naround the world. Some security researchers estimate that Ryuk has been found in as much\nas one-third of ransomware attacks launched this year.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the biggest threats from Ryuk this year has been focused on the healthcare sector. The\nattack that drew the most headlines was the attack on Universal Health Services, one of the\nbiggest hospital systems in the United States.\n\nWhile the cybersecurity community recognizes the threat all of these groups present, the\ncriminals are only one part of the picture. In our next entry, Intel 471 will examine what a\nbusiness goes through once it has to recover from a ransomware attack.\n\n\n-----",
