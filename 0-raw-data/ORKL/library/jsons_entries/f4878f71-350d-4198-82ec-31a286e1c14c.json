This disclosure was conducted by ShadowBrokers._\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe recent expansive intrusion campaign of over half a dozen government agencies and as-yet unknown\n\nother organizations through malicious backdoors in the SolarWinds Orion platform is already one of the\n\nmost significant acts of cyber espionage in history. This intrusion, dubbed SUNBURST/Solorigate, appears\n\nintended for information theft and espionage rather than destruction, placing this campaign within the realm of\n\ncounterintelligence, not just incident response. Analyzing this incident within the realm of counterintelligence\n\nmay fill the gap of descriptive language for this incident rather than bipolar descriptions of “sophisticated” or\n\nin-depth analysis which may add to confusion for network defenders. Additionally, only a handful of companies\n\nhave direct access and the investigative resources to gain meaningful insights into the technical components\n\nof the backdoor. The actor is a different story.\n\n[Like most complex, public intrusions, attribution has been messy. FireEye has named the actor behind](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n\n[this intrusion “UNC2452,” and Volexity dubbed the threat actor “Dark Halo,” stating that the actor is the same](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n\nas UNC2452, though FireEye has not substantiated that claim. Adding further complexity, Washington Post\n\ncorrespondent Ellen Nakashima [cited unnamed government sources claiming Russian actors, in particular](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/leading-cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-hacked/2020/12/08/a3369aaa-3988-11eb-98c4-25dc9f4987e8_story.html)\n\nAPT29, are responsible for the attack. Members of the U.S. Congress have also [publicly accused Russia,](https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1338972186535727105?s=20)\n\nand in particular the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), as the responsible party, and added calls\n\nfor response. Microsoft President Brad Smith [has also called for strong action. While we expect these](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)\n\norganizations have far more insight into the nature of the breach, as well as classified sources of intelligence\n\ninformation, calls for strong response should include publicly disclosed information to support accusations.\n\nPublic evidence for these claims is currently scant. Some, including Jake Williams, who runs Rendition\n\nSecurity and teaches for the SANS Institute, has said that technical evidence is forthcoming, but cannot be\n\ndisclosed without tipping off the adversaries to missteps and giving them a means to cover their tracks.\n\nStill, the lack of public evidence gives rise to claims that other actors, even perhaps other countries, may be\n\n[responsible, a claim made by President Donald Trump as well.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1340333619299147781?s=20)\n\nIntelligence analysis, properly conducted, combats bias. Bias can lead to missteps in policy. Engaging in\n\npolicy discussions about proportional responses (or, at times, very disproportionate response) without strong\n\nevidence is potentially dangerous. As rumors of attribution to Russia circulate, attribution prior to evidence is\n\npremature and myopic, biasing the analyst to only certain behaviors and actors. Further, intelligence analysis\n\nprovides both strategic and tactical guidance for responses. At the strategic level, we can be assured that\n\nresponses are coordinated and proportional. At the tactical level, defenders can apply intelligence to seed\n\nproactive activities, such as hunting for behaviors after indicators run dry.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Among information security researchers, some discussion has occurred regarding the possibility alternate](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1341175012540223488?s=20)\n\nactors, such as APT41, may ultimately be found responsible. APT41, also known as Winnti and Barium, has\n\n[been linked to the People’s Republic of China, and previously conducted attacks which beg comparison with](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n\nthe SUNBURST/Solorigate attack. (Note: Recorded Future has synonymized several named groups, including\n\nAPT41, Axiom Hacking Group, Barium, Blackfly, Dogfish, Ragebeast, Wicked Panda, Winnti Group, as Winnti\n\n[Umbrella Group.) In March 2017, APT41 executed a supply chain attack by breaching the company which made](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-unnerving-supply-chain-attack-that-corrupted-ccleaner/)\n\nCCleaner, a system cleaner software. Researchers from Cisco Talos and Morphisec uncovered the campaign,\n\nwhich ultimately spread to 2.27 million computers. While these comparisons fall well short of the requirements\n\nfor attribution, APT41 does merit consideration as a candidate actor group responsible for the SUNBURST/\n\nSolorigate breach. Enter threat intelligence.\n\n#### Noteworthy Techniques\n\nWe approached our analysis using existing techniques in order to focus on attribution and adversary\n\nmapping. We pursued methodologies including mapping MITRE ATT&CK techniques, victimology, temporal\n\nindications, and historic use of indicators to give insight into attacker motivation and intent. We analyzed both\n\npublic information as well as information from Recorded Future’s historic index to determine a set of unique\n\ncharacteristics about this campaign. Our goal was not to conclusively attribute this attack, but rather to review\n\nexisting data through the lens of intelligence analysis and contribute to conversation on adversary tracking.\n\n#### ATT&CK Technique Analysis\n\nWe conducted a comparison of ATT&CK techniques across the mentioned actors, including APT29 and\n\nAPT41. We compiled 25 techniques and 14 sub-techniques for UNC2452 using MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for\n\n[Enterprises and techniques mentioned in public reports from FireEye and Microsoft. We then used the MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/mitre-getting-started-with-attack-october-2019.pdf)\n\n[guidance for comparison of groups, and compared UNC2452 ATT&CK techniques against those the MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/mitre-getting-started-with-attack-october-2019.pdf)\n\nteam documented for APT29 and APT41 using ATT&CK Navigator (Appendix). Unfortunately, our analysis\n\nsurfaced several challenges.\n\nFirst, there are significant differences in documented ATT&CK techniques between vendors analyzing\n\nthe same actor group and/or malware. For example, FireEye lists seven techniques and 10 sub-techniques\n\n[in their report dated December 13, 2020; Microsoft shows four techniques and six sub-techniques for their](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n\n[report dated December 18, 2020.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/18/analyzing-solorigate-the-compromised-dll-file-that-started-a-sophisticated-cyberattack-and-how-microsoft-defender-helps-protect/)\n\nSecond, several techniques for APT29 and APT41 were missing from the ATT&CK groups cataloged by\n\nMITRE, appearing to lean towards more recent attacks, such as [PowerDuke campaigns. We used MITRE’s](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0139/)\n\nmaintained list of APT TTPs for initial comparison, however these appear to have notable gaps even malware\n\ntechniques and techniques for actor groups attributed to leverage the malware.\n\nThird, there were specific instances where ATT&CK lacked the nuanced matching techniques described\n\nby security reporting. For example, within ATT&CK Navigator, several techniques are automatically assigned to\n\ntactics, such as T1078 Valid Accounts, which is assigned to Initial Access, Persistence, and Defense Evasion\n\ntactics. While Microsoft does cite this technique, they limit its applicability to the Persistence tactic.\n\nAdditionally, some techniques gain meaning through both repeated applications and choices of what\n\nto encode. A salted FNV-1a hashing algorithm is used in both encoding blacklisted domains and blacklisted\n\nprocesses, corresponding to T1132 Data Encoding. However, the domains hashed with FNV-1a are also used\n\nto standardize various components of information in checks prior to downloading the second-stage payload,\n\ncreating efficiencies for communication as well as obfuscation.\n\nWhile ATT&CK is a strong framework for mapping adversary TTPs, it is missing elements critical to\n\ndescribe ongoing adversary activity and map that activity to past activity. Vendor publication of ATT&CK\n\ntechniques without in-line context further reduces applicability to adversary mapping. Historic activity\n\ntracking can provide insights into both the existing, and potentially ongoing, SUNBURST/Solorigate campaign\n\nand clues to actor motivation and attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Victim Scope\n\nVictimology, in particular, is notable for UNC2452, as it demonstrates an exacting approach to preserving\n\n[continuity of operations while prioritizing victims. As reported in a statement from Microsoft President Brad](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)\n\n[Smith, of approximately 18,000 organizations who received the SolarWinds update containing the backdoor,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)\n\nonly 0.2 percent received the second stage, and 40 of those companies, 80 percent of the chosen companies,\n\nwere located in the United States. According to FireEye, adversary use of domain generation algorithms (DGA)\n\n[custom to each victim allowed for various organizations to identify organizations beaconing to the backdoor](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/sunburst-additional-technical-details.html)\n\nCommand-and-Control (C2) server through passive DNS records and cracking the encoded subdomains.\n\n_[Figure 1: Microsoft graph of victims by industry sector. (Source: Microsoft)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)_\n\nThe plurality of victims, according to Microsoft, are information technology companies. While much of\n\nthe media coverage remains on government and government contractor victims, [recent reports of victims](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber/solarwinds-hackers-broke-into-u-s-cable-firm-and-arizona-county-web-records-show-idUSKBN28S2B9)\n\n[from telecommunications providers to](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber/solarwinds-hackers-broke-into-u-s-cable-firm-and-arizona-county-web-records-show-idUSKBN28S2B9) [healthcare organizations, demonstrate targeting beyond traditional](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/solarwinds-hack-victims-tech-companies-hospital-university)\n\nespionage targets.\n\nSome victimology can be determined through the reversing the DGA used by the Solorigate backdoor.\n\n[Several organizations, such as the RedDrip Team, Netresec, and Kaspersky published methods for decoding](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\n\n[the DGA used by the backdoor for initial C2 communications. Recorded Future collected and combined](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\n\ninformation gathered from open sources such as Pastebin, passive DNS datasets (pDNS), and others related\n\nto encoded subdomains of the SolarWinds Orion backdoor first stage command and control (C2) domain\n\navsvmcloud[.]com, and utilized three DGA decoding scripts. As of December 21, 2020, we have identified\n\nsome 286 domains.\n\n**_This output is the result of a small subset of open source data and is_**\n**_not representative of the totality of affected organizations, and is based_**\n**_exclusively on Recorded Future’s visibility at this time via open source datasets._**\n**_SolarWinds itself has said that roughly 18,000 organizations installed versions_**\n**_of SolarWinds Orion software impacted by SUNBURST, so the list of identified_**\n**_domains by Recorded Future is therefore non-comprehensive. Additionally, an_**\n**_organization’s presence on this list does not necessarily mean that it is the_**\n**_victim of second stage infection or data exfiltration. Specific conditions had_**\n**_to be met for the malware to deploy a second stage. We do not currently have_**\n**_visibility into further exploitation. Not all of the records are complete domains;_**\n**_we have included partial or incomplete domains where we deemed that there_**\n**_was sufficient enough information to make educated guesses or inferences as_**\n**_to which organization the domain or string may reference._**\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft noted in its report that the malware checks domains for certain strings prior to execution,\n\nbut was not able to determine the domains as they were implemented via hashes. Itay Cohen, a security\n\n[researcher at Checkpoint, identified the strings as FNV-1a hashes, and was able to brute-force reverse them.](https://twitter.com/megabeets_/status/1339308801112027138?s=21)\n\nCohen noted that many of the strings appear to be SolarWinds internal domain names. In combination with the\n\nchecks conducted by the malware to look for regular expressions of “solarwinds” and “test”, Cohen posited\n\nthe attackers gained intimate knowledge of the SolarWinds source code, as well as the network topology and\n\ninternal development domain names, in order to “minimize the risk that a vigilant employee will notice the\n\n[anomaly.” Costin Raiu, along with another Kaspersky researcher, cracked the remaining hashes and published](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1341005999273091077?s=20)\n\nthe full list of internal domain names. Such care to avoid detection is highly uncommon, and points towards\n\nan impressive degree of reconnaissance and focus.\n\n_Figure 2: FNV-1a hashes and the resulting domain names avoided by the SUNBURST malware._\n\n[Subsequently, SentinelOne found that SUNBURST also appears to check for certain running processes,](https://labs.sentinelone.com/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-inside-the-stealthy-apt-campaign/)\n\nand exits if these processes are discovered:\n\n_“SearchConfigurations() is used to identify blacklisted drivers. This is performed through_\n\n_the WMI query – Select * From Win32_SystemDriver, which is obfuscated in the below_\n\n_screenshot as C07NSU0uUdBScCvKz1UIz8wzNooPriwuSc11KcosSy0CAA==. The file_\n\n_name is obtained for each driver, and if this driver is found in the blacklist, this method_\n\n_will return true. As mentioned before, returning true causes the malware to break out of_\n\n_the Update() loop prior to initiating the true backdoor code.”_\n\nAmong the blacklisted processes are a number of digital forensics and endpoint detection and response\n\n[tools. A full list of the drivers can be found on the SentinelOne blog. Similar to the Microsoft revelation of](https://labs.sentinelone.com/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-inside-the-stealthy-apt-campaign/)\n\nblacklisted domains, this care to avoid endpoint detection again highlights the cautiousness of the actors.\n\n[Additionally, analysis is needed on the list of SUNBURST blacklisted processes. The full list was cracked](https://twitter.com/megabeets_/status/1341089426194243596?s=20)\n\n[by several open source researchers. A public Google Sheet was compiled by Royce Willams and the Hashcat](https://twitter.com/megabeets_/status/1341089426194243596?s=20)\n\n[team. The list of blacklisted processes is not comprehensive of all common endpoint or antivirus vendors;](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u0_Df5OMsdzZcTkBDiaAtObbIOkMa5xbeXdKk_k0vWs/edit#gid=0)\n\nfurther analysis is required to understand why the malware authors focused on certain endpoint software\n\nto blacklist.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Time\n\nA unique feature of the Solorigate backdoor is the timestamp check that the last write time for the DLL\n\nwas 12-14 days prior. Even among unique malware samples, this duration is atypical. MITRE ATT&CK lists\n\na [few attackers leveraging this technique, and none approaching this level of time, but this may be due](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003/)\n\nto incomplete documentation within ATT&CK, as mentioned above. In addition to evasion, the time-based\n\nevasion appears to be more related to avoiding detection by SolarWinds staff rather than analysis through\n\nvirtualization/sandbox analysis.\n\nIn a broader examination, the campaign appears to have [breached SolarWinds in the fall of 2019 and](https://news.yahoo.com/hackers-last-year-conducted-a-dry-run-of-solar-winds-breach-215232815.html)\n\nmade non-malicious changes to code. These changes amounted to a dry-run of the primary infection which\n\n[would occur around March 2020. Additionally, the actors inflated the size of the targeted DLL file from 500k](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1340301197123624962?s=21)\n\n[to 900k, which may have triggered detection rules for the file, but investigations would have turned up no](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1340301197123624962?s=21)\n\nmalicious code. When infected code was added in February/March 2020, the size increase was minimal. Time\n\nto conduct these preparatory actions over the course of months shows a level of discipline and patience seen\n\nprimarily in intelligence collection operations.\n\n#### Historic Indicators\n\n[Multiple indicators have been shared by FireEye and in other vendor reports. While a number of these](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/indicator_release/Indicator_Release_NBIs.csv)\n\nindicators are novel to this attack, Recorded Future does have historic references to some of these indicators.\n\nRecorded Future sees historic collection on three domains from this report:\n\n   - The domain freescanonline[.]com was first seen in a ReversingLabs scan\n\non November 28, 2017, associated with the following SHA256 hash:\n21bab0d279d15a548a84a9d9eed34575b2dc9072cc36ebfe7b517850eea92756.\n\n   - The domain also appeared in an additional ReversingLabs scan\n\non October 13, 2019 was associated with the SHA256 hash:\nc5864330c247e2cd2a98d69b852e42f59a16d9613a6536c8b0b25e16c934533d.\n\n[• The domain highdatabase[.]com appears publicly on a public Pastebin site with the title “NII GSOC](https://pastebin.com/JJcdi6qM)\n\nAdvisory”, posted December 10, 2020.\n\nOf 10 IP addresses noted in the FireEye report, only three were previously linked to malicious activity.\n\n   - 13[.]59[.]205[.]66 first appeared on Pastebin in February 6, 2018, and then appeared as a\n\n[malicious host by a URLScan listing on April 23, 2019: https://urlscan.io/result/3df2efd6-530f-](https://urlscan.io/result/3df2efd6-530f-4973-bca7-4635c083e276)\n[4973-bca7-4635c083e276](https://urlscan.io/result/3df2efd6-530f-4973-bca7-4635c083e276)\n\n   - 139[.]99[.]115[.]204 was mentioned in two URLScan results dating back to June 2019.

It is undetermined whether this malware is associated with the Solorigate backdoor\n\nor represents an additional threat actor. As per the Appendix section on the Microsoft blog:\n\n_“In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise_\n_led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion_\n_product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used_\n_by a different threat actor. The malware consists of a small persistence backdoor in_\n_the form of a DLL file named App_Web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll, which is_\n_programmed to allow remote code execution through SolarWinds web application server_\n_when installed in the folder “inetpub\\SolarWinds\\bin\\”. Unlike Solorigate, this malicious_\n_DLL does not have a digital signature, which suggests that this may be unrelated to the_\n_supply chain compromise.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft, [GuidePoint, and](https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/supernova-solarwinds-net-webshell-analysis/) [Palo Alto Networks have dubbed this second malware, a .NET webshell,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supernova/)\n\n[SUPERNOVA. SUPERNOVA is thought to load CosmicGale, a malicious Powershell script. Microsoft advises that](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/pull/5)\n\nif SUPERNOVA is detected on SolarWinds installations, it should be treated as a separate infection. While far\n\nfrom conclusive, this additional malware raises the possibility of multiple actors within the same environment.\n\nMultiple actors on the same system, knowingly or unknowingly, are not novel. For example, evidence of both\n\nAPT28 and APT29 were found on Democratic National Committee servers breached in 2016. Additionally, a file\n\nleaked from the ShadowBrokers releases showed 45 file signatures that could be used to scan for infection\n\nfrom other actors, some not publicly known at the time. Still, this adds to the argument that we are far from\n\ndecisive attribution.\n\n#### Conclusions\n\nAt the Virus Bulletin 2018 conference, security researcher Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade stated, “Currently,\n\nour understanding is stated in binary terms: ‘is the actor sophisticated or not?’” As evidenced by the plethora\n\nof media commentary around this new campaign, not much has changed. We have attempted to add more\n\ncolor to the current picture of attribution, as well as attribution in general.\n\nBased on our analysis, we believe the actor behind this campaign is exceptionally focused and patient,\n\neven when compared with other state-sponsored campaigns; demonstrates an intricate knowledge of modern\n\ninformation technology practices, architecture, and supply chains; is experienced in a wide variety of attacker\n\ntechniques; and is very familiar with security researcher techniques and approaches. We don’t have a full\n\npicture of the details of this intrusion due a variety of factors, including at least partially, balkanized data\n\ncollection among a variety of security vendors and providers.\n\nThe actor behind the SolarWinds breach appears to be selective of targets, both in choosing particular\n\norganizations to pursue and purposefully excluding organizations. Careful selection denotes a set of\n\nrequirements for targeting rather than targets of opportunity commonly seen in cybercrime incidents. Still,\n\nthis curated targeting evidently included FireEye, a curious choice for a cautious actor. Targeting a company\n\nspecializing in cybersecurity demonstrates a remarkable audacity, but has been previously seen from both\n\nRussian-affiliated actors (NotPetya) and Chinese-affiliated actors (CCleaner). We can conclude this actor\n\neither weighed requirements against high risk and believed FireEye was so critical a target as to risk an\n\nentire operation, or the actor believed their expertise was such that discovery would not destroy their entire\n\noperation. Alternatively, the actor may have been driven by a penchant for revenge: some have speculated part\n\n[of the motivation behind targeting the Hilary Clinton Presidential Campaign in 2016 was due to her approaches](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153)\n\n[while Secretary of State. Either way, the boldness speaks to the character of the actor, as well as escalates](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153)\n\nthe importance of the companies they excluded. Logically, if they believed discovery was at least a moderate\n\npossibility, the actor likely excluded certain organizations from targeting to expand the time until the exposure.\n\nOur analysis of UNC2452 shows no conclusive attribution, however that was not our exclusive intent.\n\nIncident responses and investigations are ongoing at dozens of organizations, with hundreds of others\n\nassessing impact. The leading theory of a single, known actor, speculated to be the Russian intelligence\n\nservices or, possibly, a Chinese actor should continue to be assessed. However, we conclude the particular\n\nnation behind this campaign is irrelevant for the purposes of tactical defensive actions. Any single actor\n\nhypothesis would inevitably be well-funded and state-affiliated, based on the operational time spent prior to\n\nbreach and the target set involved. Undoubtedly, there will be further information released in coming days\n\nand weeks, as the full scope of the campaign comes into focus. Tactically, Recorded Future suggests following\n\nthe advice provided by security vendors for securing your networks and best practices for conducting\n\ninvestigations. Strategically, we suggest clues be added to public, annotated ATT&CK matrixes of known\n\ntechniques. In this way, defenders can identify organizational gaps and prioritize improvements based on\n\ntheir level of impact, better assessing risk to the organization at large.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix\n\n MITRE ATT&CK Analysis\n\n_Appendix Figure 1: Visualization of compiled UNC2452 techniques, generated on ATT&CK Navigator_\n\nWe conducted an analysis of UNC2452’s known techniques on MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise version 8.\n\nUNC2452, as disclosed by FireEye thus far, demonstrates 25 techniques, and 14 sub-techniques under MITRE\n\n[ATT&CK. (Note: we compared techniques with those enumerated by the original FireEye report on UNC2452,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n\n[as well as one put together by Picus Security.) We then mapped out UNC2452 technique overlaps with APT29](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/ttps-used-in-the-solarwinds-breach)\n\nand APT41. Picus Security adds to certain techniques to their analysis for UNC2452, including:\n\n   - T1021 Remote Services\n\n   - T1036.003 Masquerade: Rename System Utilities\n\n   - T1036.004 Masquerade Task or Service\n\n   - T1036.05 Masquerade: Match Legitimate Name or Location\n\n   - T1041 Exfiltration over C2 channel\n\n   - T1078 Valid Accounts (also seen in Microsoft report)\n\n   - T1497.003 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion\n\n   - T1583.003 Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Servers\n\n   - T1587.001 Develop Capabilities: Malware\n\nUNC2452 has six techniques overlapped with APT29, and 11 techniques overlapped with APT41. Nine\n\ntechniques are novel and not seen in either actor’s known previous incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Technique Overlaps with APT29\n\n_Appendix Figure 2: MITRE ATT&CK mapping of UNC2452 [shown in red] and APT29 [shown in yellow]. Overlapping techniques are shown in orange._\n\nBased on the FireEye report on UNC2452, we track five techniques that overlap with APT29:\n\nResource Development\n\n   - T1583 Acquire Infrastructure (T1583.003 Private Web Server for UNC2452, T1583.006 Web\n\nServer)\n\n   - T1587 Develop capabilities, though different sub-techniques (Malware T1587.001 for UNC2452,\n\nDigital Certificates T1587.003 for APT29)\n\nInitial Access\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts (Domain accounts T1078.002 for APT29)\n\nExecution\n\n   - T1569 System Services\n\nPersistence\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts (Domain accounts T1078.002 for APT29)\n\n\n-----\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts (Domain accounts T1078.002 for APT29)\n\nDefensive Evasion\n\n   - T1070 Indicator Removal on Host (File Deletion T1070.004)\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts (Domain accounts T1078.002 for APT29)\n\n   - T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nWhile this is not conclusive, it can be significant. Techniques shown in APT29 yet not appearing in\n\nUNC2452 tracking may be areas for further discovery by defenders. Alternately, these techniques may have\n\nnot been applied toward this campaign. Conversely, techniques novel to UNC2452 yet not appearing in APT29\n\nmay demonstrate newly deployed capabilities. Lack of overlay may open the possibility that UNC2452 is\n\nnot related to APT29, however this is far from conclusive. Either way, if UNC2452 is ultimately attributed to\n\nAPT29, this would indicate substantial investment in structure and capabilities.\n\n#### Differences in UNC2452 and APT29 Techniques\n\nCertain techniques used by UNC2452 have not been observed amongst known techniques for APT29.\n\nRather than disprove association, these could indicate substantial expansion of techniques. If UNC2452\n\nis ultimately synonymized with APT29, we can conclude extensive resources to support such technique\n\nexpansion:\n\nInitial Access\n\n   - T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, Sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain\n\nPersistence\n\n   - T1543 Create of Modify System Process, Sub-technique T1543.002 Windows Service\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n   - T1543 Create of Modify System Process, Sub-technique T1543.002 Windows Service\n\nDefensive Evasion\n\n   - T1036 Masquerading Sub-techniques T1036.004 Masquerade Task or Service, T1036.05 Match\n\nLegitimate Name or Location, T1036.003 Rename System Utilities\n\n   - T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, Sub-technique T1553.002 Code Signing\n\n   - T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, Sub-technique T1497.003 Time Based Evasion\n\nLateral Movement\n\n   - T1021 Remote Services\n\nCommand and Control\n\n   - T1071 Application Layer Protocol, Sub-technique T1071.001 Web Protocols\n\n   - T1568 Dynamic Resolution, T1568.002 Domain Generation Algorithms\n\n\n-----\n\n#### UNC2452 Technique Overlaps with APT41\n\n_Appendix Figure 3: Visualization of ATT&CK technique comparison between UNC2452 and APT41_\n\n[Some sources have posited the possibility of threat actors other than APT29 being behind the breach. One](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1341175012540223488?s=20)\n\n[possibility which is frequently mentioned is APT41, which is attributed to China according to the September](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1341175012540223488?s=20)\n\n[2020 U.S. Department of Justice indictments of seven defendants, and crosses between state-associated](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n\nespionage and cybercrime. We identified eight technique overlaps between APT41 and UNC2452:\n\nInitial Access\n\n   - T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, Sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain\n\n   - T1078 Valid Accounts\n\nExecution\n\n   - T1569 System Services, Sub-technique T1569.002 Service Execution\n\nPersistence\n\n   - T1543 Create or Modify System Processes, Sub-technique T1543.003 Windows Service\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n   - T1543 Create or Modify System Processes, Sub-technique T1543.003 Windows Service\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts\n\n\n-----\n\nDefensive Evasion\n\n   - T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, Sub-technique T1070.004 File Deletion\n\n   - T1036 Masquerading Sub-techniques T1036.05 Match Legitimate Name or Location\n\n   - T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, Sub-technique T1553.002 Code Signing\n\n   - T1078 Valid accounts\n\nCommand and Control\n\n   - T1568 Dynamic Resolution, T1568.002 Domain Generation Algorithms\n\n#### Other Actors\n\nOther actors have been posited as candidates for this campaign. Winnti Group has been suggested as a\n\n[possible candidate actor, given similar DGA patterns seen in 2019 from CCleaner supply chain attacks. Some](https://twitter.com/notdan/status/1339558018506092545?s=20)\n\nfurther analysis is necessary, as the MITRE ATT&CK group for Winnti has only three ATT&CK techniques\n\nassociated with it:\n\n   - T1057, Process Discovery, Winnti Group looked for a specific process running on infected servers\n\n   - T1014, Rootkit, Winnti Group used a rootkit to modify typical server functionality\n\n   - T1553.002, Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing, Winnti Group used stolen certificates to sign its\n\nmalware\n\nThese techniques do correspond with techniques leveraged in this campaign, especially the leveraging\n\nof a trusted supply chain, however the current campaign is far more expansive, both in terms of technical\n\ndevelopment and the scope of victims.\n\n#### Novel Techniques for UNC2452\n\nA subset of techniques in UNC2452 are not seen in known techniques for APT29 nor APT41. Additionally,\n\nthese techniques are not documented for Winnti either, however this is at least partially attributed to the\n\nincomplete MITRE ATT&CK group for this actor:\n\nExecution\n\n   - T1072 Software Deployment Tools\n\nDefensive Evasion\n\n   - T1036 Masquerading, Sub-techniques T1036.004 Masquerade Task or Service, T1036.003\n\nRename System Utilities\n\n   - T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, Sub-technique T1497.003 Time Based Evasion\n\nDiscovery\n\n   - T1057 Process Discovery\n\n   - T1012 Query Registry\n\n   - T1480.001 Execution Guardrails: Environmental Keying\n\n   - T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, Sub-technique T1497.003 Time Based Evasion\n\n   - T1562.001 Impair Defense: Disable or Modify Tools\n\nLateral Movement\n\n   - T1021 Remote Services\n\nCommand and Control\n\n   - T1071 Application Layer Protocol, Sub-technique T1071.001 Web Protocols\n\nExfiltration\n\n   - T1041 Exfiltration of C2 Channel\n\n\n-----\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete security intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
