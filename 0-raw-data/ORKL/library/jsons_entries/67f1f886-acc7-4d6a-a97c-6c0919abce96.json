As a recognizable application from a\ncommonly used and trusted vendor, Power BI is also a prime target for threat actors to spoof\nand abuse it for phishing attacks.\n\nThe Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) has observed a new phishing campaign that\nharvests Microsoft credentials by impersonating Power BI emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Email Body_\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, the email resembles a legitimate Microsoft notification. There are a\ncouple of reasons how this happens. Threat actors have become comfortable adapting\nlegitimate MS notifications in their phishing templates. We also observe them leveraging\nstolen credentials to create a legitimate looking notification from a legitimate MS instance.\nWe see that the threat actor in this email used a common theme to try to get the recipient to\ninteract with the links – Weekly Sales Report.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Phishing Page_\n\nOnce the user has clicked the link in the email, they are presented with a page seen in\nFigure 2, designed to look like a legitimate Microsoft log-in page. The first indicator that\nsomething’s not right with the page, beyond the missing standard imagery, is that the URL\ndoesn’t look anything close to what’s indicated in the email or associated with Microsoft\nservices.\n\n_Figure 3: Phishing Final Page_\n\n\n-----\n\nSubsequent to the recipient providing their credentials, the final step of the attack is an error\nmessage indicating that there was an issue with the account verification. This is another\nMicrosoft spoof the threat actor employed to distract the recipient from the fact that they have\nnot been redirected to the Power BI report they expected to see. This discourages the\nrecipient from suspecting that they have just given away their credentials.\n\nCofense continues to observe credential phishing as a major threat to organizations. This is\nwhy it’s critical to condition users to identify and report suspicious messages to the security\noperations team. This recipient was well-conditioned to identify something wasn’t adding up\nwith this email and landing page, and used Cofense Reporter to send this off to the Cofense\nPhishing Defense Center. Cofense can help you, too. Attacks such as this one are effective\nat eluding common email security controls, and are – by design — overlooked by end users.\n[Cofense can help.
