The challenge is that we need to block their exploits 100 percent of the time if we are to protect our networks and information. They can be right once; we have to be right all of the time. We need to be ever-vigilant in our efforts to protect our assets, information, and ourselves online.”\n\n—John N. Stewart, vice president and chief security officer, Cisco\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Exploitation of Trust:  Cybercriminals’ Most Powerful Weapon\n\nWhether they’re creating malware that can subvert\nindustrial processes or tricking Facebook users into\nhanding over login and password information, today’s\ncybercriminals have a powerful weapon at their disposal:\nthe exploitation of trust. They have become skilled at\nconvincing users that their infected links and URLs are\nsafe to click on, and that they are someone the user\nknows and trusts. And with stolen security credentials,\nthey can freely interact with legitimate software\nand systems.\n\nWhen trust is exploited, more damage can be done with\nfewer intrusions—the criminal essentially has been given\npermission to wreak havoc on compromised systems\nand software. “Miscreants are continuing to find new\nand creative ways to exploit network, system, and even\nhuman vulnerabilities to steal information or do damage,”\nsays John N. Stewart, vice president and chief security\nofficer for Cisco. “The challenge is that we need to block\ntheir exploits 100 percent of the time if we are to protect\nour networks and information. They can be right once;\nwe have to be right all of the time. We need to be evervigilant in our efforts to protect our assets, information,\nand ourselves online.”\n\nPeople by nature are inclined to trust others, and\ncriminals use this to their advantage again and\nagain. Take the case of the fake social networking\nprofiles established earlier this year for “Robin Sage,”\nsupposedly a young, attractive woman working in\nthe national security arena. A security expert created\n\n\nthe fake profiles as a test to see how many security\nprofessionals might be fooled by Sage’s persona and\nshare information with her. About 300 people within\nthe United States military and government, as well\nas security companies, connected with “Robin.” If\neven sophisticated security experts fail to think twice\nbefore exposing personal and corporate information to\nstrangers, imagine what the average employee might\ndo with your proprietary data. (Read more about the\nRobin Sage fake profiles on page 17.)\n\nHackers are also taking advantage of new opportunities\nto make money. In response to vulnerability exploits\nin various Windows PC operating systems, Microsoft\nhas improved security in Windows 7 and taken a more\naggressive approach to patching vulnerabilities. This\nmakes it tougher for scammers to infiltrate Windows 7\neffectively; having reached the Windows vulnerability\n“tipping point” (see page 30), they have moved on to\nother operating systems, applications, software services,\nand devices such as smartphones, iPads, and iPods.\nApple and its products, including iPhones, iPads, and\nthe iTunes media service, have all experienced upticks\nin exploits. Just as important in driving this trend is\nthe embrace of mobile devices and applications by\nconsumers and enterprises.\n\nThe worldwide adoption of mobile devices presents\neven more opportunities for intrusions and theft. While\nsecurity researchers have identified many focused\nscams that target mobile devices, a widespread\nincident is almost certainly on its way. To date, scams\nhave targeted select groups of mobile users, such\nas customers of a specific bank. The massive and\nrelatively new market for mobile applications also offers\nnew markets for criminals. Researchers have detected\nexploits in which wallpaper apps for Android Market,\nthe app store for the Android mobile operating system,\nhave been collecting mobile subscriber information and\nsending it to a website owned by a scammer.\n\n\nAnother type of exploitation involves “money mules”—\nindividuals who help launder money by accepting and\ntransferring funds earned in online scams. Money mules\nare sometimes criminals; more often, however, they\nare people in need of money who are tempted into this\nactivity by “work at home” spam. Regardless of whether\nthey are willing participants or unsuspecting victims,\nmoney mules are integral to enabling criminals to profit\nfrom their campaigns. Users can limit these operations\nby not becoming unwitting accomplices.\n\nThe subject of trust is also in play in the ongoing struggle\nof governments to work together to combat cybercrime.\nGovernments recognize the need to develop common\nstandards for security solutions, yet they also want\nautonomy over how technology is deployed within their\nborders. Some countries and companies are leading\nefforts to expand the reach of these common standards,\nsince they present the best opportunity for improved\nsecurity and continued product innovation.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Announcing the 2010 The Good: The EVIL: \n\n###### Thorsten Holz Stuxnet\nRuhr-University Bochum/LastLine\n\n##### Winners of the Cisco Cybercrime Showcase If it weren’t for researchers like  The Stuxnet worm, whose earliest\n\nThorsten Holz, an assistant professor versions appear to date to 2009, differs\n\nAs you read the Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report, at Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany from its malware “cousins” in that it has\nyou’ll find many stories about the bad guys whose and senior threat analyst for security a specific, damaging goal: to traverse\ncraftiness and lack of morals have brought them firm LastLine, we’d all be receiving a lot more spam. to industrial control systems so it can reprogram\nto new heights of criminality this year.

Cisco security experts offer their predictions based on recent and emerging trends in the shadow economy.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Cisco Cybercrime Return on Investment Matrix\n\n**POTENTIALS** **RISING STARS**\n\n\nThe Cisco CROI Matrix made its debut in the Cisco\n_2009 Annual Security Report and is used to track_\nthe performance of cybercrime operations, which\nincreasingly are managed and organized in ways similar\nto sophisticated, legitimate businesses. Specifically,\nthis matrix highlights the types of aggressive actions\nCisco security experts predict cybercriminals are likely\nto focus most of their resources toward developing,\nrefining, and deploying in the year ahead.\n\nCash Cows: As predicted in 2009, many cybercriminals\nwere content to sit back and relax during 2010 and let\nroad-tested techniques, such as scareware and spyware,\nclick fraud, advanced-fee fraud, and pharma spam, help\nthem make a profit. Expect to see these “cash cows”\nmaintain their role as workhorses for cybercriminals\nduring 2011—although spammers, particularly those\nresponsible for high volumes of spam traffic, may need\nto be more cautious. Law enforcement agencies are\ntaking action to address the global spam epidemic by\ntargeting some of the most egregious offenders.\n\n\n**POTENTIALS**\n\nMobile VoIP\nDevices Abuse\n\n\n**DOGS** **CASH COWS**\n\n\n**RISING STARS**\n\nWeb\nExploits\n\nMoney\nLaundering\n(muling)\n\nData Theft\nTrojans\n\n\n**CASH COWS**\n\nClick/\nRedirect\nFraud\n\nSpyware/\nScareware\n\nAdvanced\nFee Fraud Pharma\nSpam\n\n\nLow\n\n\n**DOGS**\n\nSocial\nNetworking\nAttacks\n\nPhishing\n1.0\n\nDDoS\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nDogs: As expected, instant messaging scams have\ndropped off the matrix, but now there’s a newcomer\namong the Dogs: social networking scams, which\nranked in 2010 as a wait-and-see moneymaker in the\nPotentials category. Cisco security experts predict that\nsocial networking scams will not be a significant area\nfor cybercriminals to invest their resources in the\nyear ahead. It’s not that social networking scams are\ndeclining, but they are just a small part of a bigger plan—\nlaunching web exploits, such as last year’s campaign\nto lure users of LinkedIn into downloading the Zeus\nTrojan (see page15). Thus, less up-front research and\ndevelopment are required for social networking scams.\nCriminals know they work.\n\n\n###### Scalability/Revenue\n\n_The Cisco CROI Matrix predicts cybercrime techniques that will be “winners” and “losers” in 2011._\n\n\n-----\n\nAppearing again in the “Dogs” category are phishing\n1.0 scams (unsophisticated attempts to steal user\ncredentials and other sensitive information). So, too,\nare distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, despite\nsome notable incidents this year. For instance, in late\nSeptember 2010, a DDoS attack was launched by hacker\nwebsite 4Chan against the Motion Picture Association\nof America’s (MPAA) webpage. Dubbed “Operation\nPayback,” the attack was retribution for the MPAA trying\nto halt the activity of websites that distribute copyrighted\ncontent and users who download illegal copies of\nmovies. Film studios had reportedly paid Indian firm\nAiplex Software to attack torrent websites in a similar\nmanner.[2] And even in light of the recent spate of DDoS\nattacks against a number of companies that had cut off\nservices to WikiLeaks.org following the nonprofit media\norganization’s release of confidential U.S. government\ndocuments on its website, it is unlikely these types of\nattacks, which tend to be highly targeted and retaliatory,\nwill be a major investment category for the general\ncybercrime community looking to make a profit in 2011.\n\nPotentials: According to research firm IDC, the number\nof mobile devices—from smartphones to tablet PCs—\naccessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion,[3]\ncreating more opportunities for cybercrime (see The\nTipping Point, page 30). The massively successful\nbanking Trojan, Zeus—which, according to the U.S.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has played a key\nrole in the theft of more than US$70 million from 400\nU.S. organizations over the past several years—is already\n\n\nbeing adapted for the mobile platform.[4] In late 2009,\nSymbOS/Zitmo.Altr appeared; researchers believe it was\ndesigned to intercept confirmation SMS messages sent\nby banks to their customers. (Note: “Zitmo” stands for\n“Zeus in the Mobile.”)[5] It appears the mobile malware,\nwhich users download after falling prey to a social\nengineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based\ntwo-factor authentication most banks use to confirm\nonline funds transfers by customers.\n\nMeanwhile, VoIP abuse has been on the upswing and\nappears poised for further growth. Criminals use bruteforce techniques to hack private branch exchange (PBX)\nsystems to place fraudulent, long-distance calls—usually\ninternational. These incidents, often targeting small or\nmidsize businesses, have resulted in significant financial\nlosses for some companies. VoIP systems are being\nused to support vishing (telephone-based phishing)\nschemes, which are growing in popularity. In one recent\nvishing scam targeting the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), vishers called U.S. consumers via\nmobile and land-line phones to inform them they were\ndelinquent in loan payments that had been applied for\nover the Internet or made through a payday lender.[6]\nCriminals were able to collect personal information,\nsuch as Social Security numbers (SSNs), from victims.\n\nRising stars: The Zeus Trojan, and the entire field of\nlucrative, easy-to-deploy web exploits, like those seen\nin 2009 and 2010, will continue to receive significant\ninvestment from cybercriminals in 2011. The aptly\nnamed Zeus, which is powerful, pervasive, and targeting\neverything from bank accounts to government networks,\nhas become extremely sophisticated and is much more\n\n\ncustomizable; as of October 2010, there were hundreds\nof different Zeus botnets known to security researchers.\n(See page 15 to learn about the recent Zeus exploit\ninvolving fake LinkedIn spam alerts, and page 23 for\ndetails on the Zeus-related fake Apple iTunes spam\nevent.) However, the attention Zeus commands is\nmaking it easier for other highly sophisticated but less\nwidespread Trojans such as Bugat, Carberp, and SpyEye\nto avoid detection. Also of note: In October 2010, Brian\nKrebs, who was spotlighted as a “Cybercrime Hero” in\nthe Cisco 2009 Cybercrime Showcase, reported in his\nKrebs on Security blog that malware developers were\nmerging the Zeus codebase with that of the SpyEye\nTrojan to create an especially potent threat for “a more\nexclusive and well-heeled breed of cyber crook.”[7]\n\nCisco security experts anticipate that the real focus of\ncybercriminal investment for 2011, however, will be on\nimproving the success and expanding the number of\ncash-out services (“money muling” operations). These\noperations, which have been discussed in previous\nCisco security reports, are a vital component of the\ncybercrime lifecycle and are becoming more elaborate\nand international in scope. Zeus is often in the mix here,\nas well: See page 11 to read about its central role in a\ncomplex international money muling scheme operated\nby Eastern European gangs that was recently exposed\nby United Kingdom and U.S. law enforcement.\n\n\n[2 “Film studios ‘launch cyberattacks on torrent sites,’” by Emma Woollacott, TG Daily, September 9, 2010, www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-features/51458-film-studios-launch-cyber-attacks-on-torrent-sites.](http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-features/51458-film-studios-launch-cyber-attacks-on-torrent-sites)\n\n[3 “IDC: 1 Billion Mobile Devices Will Go Online by 2013,” by Agam Shah, CIO.com, December 9, 2009, www.cio.com/article/510440/IDC_1_Billion_Mobile_Devices_Will_Go_Online_By_2013.](http://www.cio.com/article/510440/IDC_1_Billion_Mobile_Devices_Will_Go_Online_By_2013)\n\n[4 Graphic depicting global reach of Zeus: http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/globalreach.jpg.](http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/globalreach.jpg)\n\n[5 “Zeus Goes Mobile – Targets Online Banking Two-Factor Authentication,” by Mike Lennon, SecurityWeek, September 27, 2010, www.securityweek.com/zeus-goes-mobile-targets-online-banking-two-factor-authentication.](http://www.securityweek.com/zeus-goes-mobile-targets-online-banking-two-factor-authentication)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Money Mules: The Linchpins of Cybercrime Networks\n\n###### Cybercriminals need “hired help” to launder their ill-gotten gains—but rounding up new recruits is a never-ending process, as most money mules have short-lived careers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile online scammers have no difficulty stealing\nenough information to use their victims’ credit cards and\naccess their online bank accounts, they still need a way\nto get paid in the physical world, and thus, turn to money\nmules who facilitate money laundering. Money mules are\nindividuals recruited by handlers or “wranglers” to set\nup bank accounts, or even use their own bank accounts,\nto assist in the transfer of money from a fraud victim’s\naccount to another location—usually overseas—via a wire\ntransfer or automated clearing house (ACH) transaction.\n\nOne major hitch with any type of cash-out operation\ninvolving money mules is that there simply aren’t enough\nmules in service. Mules typically work only one day\nbefore they are either abandoned by their handler or\nare taken into custody by law enforcement. As the\ncybercriminal economy continues to expand, it will be\nincreasingly challenging for scammers to maintain an\nadequate supply of these temporary “employees” to\nprofit fully from their exploits: One money mule expert\nestimates that the ratio of stolen account credentials\nto available mule capacity already could be as high\nas 10,000 to 1.\n\nSo, what type of people serve as money mules? They\ncan be lower-level criminals willing to engage in a shady\nfinancial transaction to make some quick cash. Someone\nwho is aware of his or her role as a money mule often\nbelieves that he or she is somehow “smarter than the\naverage mule”—and therefore, will never be caught by\nauthorities. Or, they do not believe what they are doing is\nthat serious, and think, perhaps, “Well, what’s the worst\nthing that could happen?” Not surprisingly, many money\nmules are caught quickly. Often, they face substantial\nfines—even jail time.\n\n\nHowever, mules are quite often individuals seeking\nlegitimate employment who end up being lured by\ntoo-good-to-be true job offers such as “Earn\nThousands Working at Home!” Some ads, designed\nto appeal to people struggling with consumer debt,\nlure in victims with calls to action like, “Get Out of Debt\nNow!” These offers are often sent via spam, but some\noperations still advertise in the physical world with\nposters, flyers, and newspaper ads. People scouring\nemployment ads on legitimate, well-known job search\nsites also have been duped by these scams. And given\nthe challenging economic environment of the past few\nyears, recruiters for money mules are likely finding their\ninboxes brimming with job application materials from\npotential candidates for hire.\n\n###### Currently, the ratio of stolen account credentials to available mule capacity could be as high as 10,000 to 1.\n\nStudents are often targets for money mule recruiters,\nas are those simply looking for an “easy” way to make\nextra cash. A mule may be promised a monthly base\nsalary, as well as a small commission (for example,\nUS$50) per successful transaction. Some mules are\ntold they can keep 5 percent per transaction, minus any\nwire transfer fees. As most mule handlers aim for mules\nto withdraw up to US$10,000 per transaction (amounts\nover that figure trigger a financial institution’s antimoney laundering controls), the potential “earnings”\nare attractive. But even if they do make money in the\nshort term, mules often pay a high price for their\ninvolvement in facilitating a crime: When a bank detects\nfraud, the mule, once identified by authorities, is often\nheld responsible for repaying the money that was\nillegally transferred.\n\n\nThe more sophisticated cash-out organizations act\nas legitimate financial services firms. Individuals who\ncome in contact with these operations usually have\nno idea they are being recruited as money mules, and\nbelieve they are dealing with a recruiter for a legitimate\ncompany. Quite often, they have responded to an ad\non an online employment site for a position with a title\nsuch as “regional assistant,” “company representative,”\nor “payment processor.” The contact the applicant\ninteracts with online or by phone plays the role of human\nresources specialist, and when the victim inquires about\nvacation time, the availability of a 401(k) plan, or whether\nthe “company” honors the U.S. Family and Medical\nLeave Act, they are provided a satisfying answer. As\npart of the “hiring process,” mules are asked to provide\nsensitive information to the handlers, such as images\nof their government-issued identification.\n\nOnce hired, money mules are expected to work in a\nshort time window—usually from around 9 to 11 a.m. —so\nthat cash can be wired out of their account before a\nfinancial institution’s security staff are able to respond\nto an incident of suspected fraud. (Mules also must own\na cell phone; in fact, not having one is a deal-breaker.\nThey won’t get the job.) Mule operatives instruct mules\nto open two bank accounts: one for their “salary” and\nanother for “funds.” They also tell the mules to provide\nthem with the online banking passwords for those\naccounts so they are able to check the balances. Mules\nare then asked to locate their local Western Union and\nMoneygram branches so that the cash-out process\ncan commence; wire transfers, even though they require\na fee to be paid up front by the sender, are typically\nvery fast transactions, and don’t require a bank accountto-bank account transfer.\n\n\n###### Currently, the ratio of stolen\n\n\n###### account credentials to available\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is not unusual for criminals to recruit dozens of money\nmules to stage just one large operation, or keep several\non hand for repeat check-cashing and wire-transfer\nassignments. For example, one money mule recruitment\nand management website managed more than 4100\nmules working in the United States during the course\nof a single year. Experts have noted that criminals, for\nreasons not entirely clear, prefer to hire East Coast\nresidents when setting up money muling operations\nin the United States.\n\nThe following are examples of common cash-out\nsystems that involve money mules:\n\n###### Operation 1:\n\nStandard money is placed into legitimate in-country\naccounts via wire transfers (for example, Western Union)\nor ACH transactions. Mules are recruited to use their\nown accounts. Criminals move stolen money into these\naccounts. As an example, a mule conducts transactions\nat three or four Western Union locations, each time\nsending approximately US$3,000 by wire transfer to\nan overseas location. These wire transfers are often\nredirected after they are posted—using information\nthe mule provided when he or she entered the mule\norganization, such as bank account information—so the\nmule doesn’t know the true final destination for the funds.\n\n###### Operation 2:\n\nJ-1 visa holders who obtain permission to work in the\nUnited States for short periods, such as for seasonal\nwork, are recruited by money mule operatives in their\ncountry. While in the United States, the J-1 visa\nholders/money mules set up bank accounts in major\nmetropolitan areas using bogus names and passports\nprovided by their contacts. Information about money\n\n\nIndividual applies to\nan employment ad\n(e.g., “Work from\nHome!”) posted on a\njob site or sent via\nspam by a money\nmuling operation.\n\nThe mule is hired and\ntold to work from 9 to 11\na.m. on the first day\n(which is usually the last\nday, too). The mule is\ninstructed to open two\nbank accounts, one for\n“funds” and one for\n“salary,” and to provide\ncredentials for accessing\nthe accounts. The mule\nis also asked to locate\nlocal Western Union and\nMoneygram locations.\n\n\n###### A Day in the Life of a Money Mule\n\n\nThe mule awaits\nfurther instruction.\nFrom here, the mule\nis usually abandoned\nby the handler, and\nmay even be arrested\n(once fraud is\ndetected) and can\ngo to jail and/or\nbe expected to pay\nback funds illegally\ntaken from victims’\naccounts.\n\nThe mule takes the\nmoney out of the bank\n(always less than\nUS$10,000 at a time\nto help avoid fraud\ndetection), and heads\nto a Western Union\nor similar location to\nmake a wire transfer.\n\nThe money is wired\noverseas to one or\nmore locations.\n\n\nThe mule reports back\nto the handler by cell\nphone or email.

In\nthe United Kingdom, as much as US$9.5 million was\nsiphoned from U.K. bank accounts. Money mules used\nunits of Bank of America Corp. and TD Bank Financial\nGroup to open accounts for laundering the money.[9]\n\n\n###### Operation 3:\n\nBecause banks and credit card companies are becoming\nmore adept at deterring fraud, some cybercriminals\nare turning to reshipping scams as a way to cash out. A\nscammer uses stolen or fake credit card or bank account\ninformation to purchase merchandise—usually, popular\nconsumer electronics such as MP3 players, laptops,\nor flat-screen TVs—from e-commerce or auction sites.\nSince criminals obviously cannot send the goods to their\nown address, they rely on “shipping mules” to receive\nand forward the deliveries to foreign locations.\n\n###### Social networking is an increasingly important tool for cybercriminals looking to spread their cash-out operations around the globe.\n\nMules participating in reshipping fraud may or may\nnot be willing conspirators. But criminals have been\nknown to prey on those who are looking for personal\nrelationships online. They lure victims with overtures\nof friendship or romance communicated via email or\ninstant messages—perhaps even sending nominal gifts\nas the “relationship” progresses. Over time, as the victim\nbecomes convinced he or she has found a new best\nfriend or a potential soul mate, the criminal begins to\nask for favors.\n\n\nTypically, scammers tell their victims that they cannot\nship items they have purchased online directly to their\nhome or business address in a foreign country due to\nsome type of “legal” restriction. They ask the victim’s\npermission to send the goods to his or her home, and\noffer to handle all of the shipping expenses.\n\nOnce the victim agrees to help, he or she quickly\nreceives a flood of parcels containing the illegally\npurchased goods and is asked to repackage and send\nthem to one or more locations outside the country.\nThis may go on until the scammer’s specific mission\nis complete, or until the victim grows suspicious (or\nweary of the reshipping process) or is visited by law\nenforcement and informed that the products being\nshipped outside the country were paid for with stolen\nor fraudulent credit cards.\n\n\n###### operations around the globe.\n\n\n###### increasingly important tool\n\n\n###### Social networking is an\n\n\n8 “Zeus Trojan bust reveals sophisticated ‘money mules’ operation in U.S.,” by Jaikumar Vijayan, Computerworld, September 30, 2010,\n[www.networkworld.com/news/2010/100110-zeus-trojan-bust-reveals-sophisticated.html.](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/100110-zeus-trojan-bust-reveals-sophisticated.html)\n\n9 “A R id d i Gl b l B k H k ” b Ch d B C ll B L d Si bh G Th W ll S J l O b 1 2010\n\n\n###### for cybercriminals looking\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Appeal of Automated Clearing House Transactions for Money Mule Operations\n\nAn automated clearing house (ACH) transfer takes The appropriate thing for the bank to do is to keep\nmore time to complete than a wire transfer (a day or retrying with progressively smaller amounts until it\nmore, versus minutes), but because the process is succeeds in recouping at least a portion of the stolen\nautomated, ACH transactions are less expensive.

They often exploit this trust by masquerading as someone the user knows.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, exploitation of trust is\nnow an essential tool across all sectors of cybercrime.\nNowhere is this tactic more widespread than within\nsocial networking, where it continues to attract victims\nwho are willing to share information with people they\nbelieve are known to them.\n\nOne noticeable shift in social engineering is that\ncriminals are spending more time figuring out how to\nassume someone’s identity, perhaps by generating\nemails from an individual’s computer or social\nnetworking account. A malware-laden email or scam\nsent by a “trusted person” is more likely to elicit a\nclickthrough response than the same message sent\nby a stranger. Koobface malware, which first appeared\non Facebook in 2008, uses this tactic, sending\nmessages to friends of an infected Facebook user and\nconvincing them to download the malware. (See the\nsidebar on page 18 for more about the evolution of the\nKoobface botnet.) And in October 2010, a freelance\nweb developer created Firesheep, an extension for the\nFirefox browser that allows someone on an unsecured\nwireless network to hijack another wireless user’s\nFacebook or Twitter account.[12]\n\nAs Cisco has discussed in previous security reports,\nusers of social networks continue to place high levels\nof trust in information they (supposedly) receive from\nother members of these networks, or what seem to\nbe official messages from these networks. Knowing this\nweakness, scammers are naturally directing more of\ntheir spam messages at social network users, employing\nsocial engineering tactics to drive necessary clickthroughs\nand malware downloads.\n\nIn September 2010, spam emails that were purportedly\nfrom business social networking service LinkedIn were\nsent worldwide and contained fake reminders. If the\nrecipient clicked through on any links contained in the\nmessage, their computer became infected with Zeus\ndata-theft malware, which captures personal banking\ninformation.\n\n\nThe scale of this particular spam operation was daunting:\nOn the day the messages were sent, they numbered\nin the billions and accounted for 24 percent of spam\nmessages worldwide. While this has been the largest\noutbreak of social networking-related spam to date, it’s\nnot the first: The Cutwail botnet, which was first detected\nin 2007, routinely sends emails that try to convince\nrecipients that they originate from social networks.\n\nThe LinkedIn spam operation is worth noting and\nwatching in the future because of the high volume of\nmessages delivered, as well as the fact that supposedly\nsavvy business users (presumably, higher-value targets)\nwere targeted and that Zeus malware was used to\n\n\nsteal personal login data. “The LinkedIn spam campaign\nstrongly suggests that its perpetrators are most\ninterested in employees with access to financial systems\nand online commercial bank accounts. According to\nthe FBI’s Internet Crime Complaints Center, in 2009,\nmore than US$100 million was stolen from commercial\nbank accounts using methods like this,” explains Nilesh\nBhandari, product manager at Cisco. “The scammers\nare targeting the professionals who used LinkedIn,\nnot people who frequent MySpace or Facebook.\nOrganizations should encourage people to be suspicious\nof any email that purports to be from a legitimate source,\nbut appears slightly different than they might expect.”\n\n|Fake Link 30% 25% 20% Spam 15% of rcent 10%|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n||Fake Link 30% 25% 20% Spam 15% of rcent 10%||\n||||\n\n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n\n_In September 2010, spam messages lured recipients into clicking on links in fake LinkedIn_\n_notifications that infected their computers with Zeus malware._\n\n\n###### Fake LinkedIn Messages as a Percent of Total Spam\n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\nDay/Time\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Spammers Get Social\n\nSpammers are not only spoofing social networking\nmessages to persuade targets to click on links in emails—\nthey are taking advantage of users’ trust of their social\nnetworking connections to attract new victims. As\ncommunications shift from traditional email and toward\nthe messaging features used in social networks, such\nas those provided by Facebook and LinkedIn, criminals\nfollow closely behind.\n\nOne tactic is to lure individuals into “liking” a particular\nFacebook page, claiming that the user will see a shocking\nphoto or read a dramatic news story. Once the user\nhas clicked on Facebook’s “Like” button for that page,\nits creator can now email the user to click on other links\n(perhaps to malware), and can also see the user’s\npersonal information, if they have made it viewable for\nother friends. Another tactic is to send out fake friend\nrequests, which frequently include a picture of an\nattractive man or woman. If the recipient decides to\nview this supposed person’s Facebook page, they will\nusually find only a single post, which links to some\ntype of scam.\n\n\n###### How to Educate the “Problem Users”\n\nSince people are the weak point in forming a defense\nagainst socially engineered scams, user education must\nbe ongoing and effective. However, in spite of many\norganizations’ best efforts to teach workers to exercise\ncaution when responding to emails or social network\nmessages, social engineering continues to be a highly\nsuccessful method for cybercriminals.\n\nThe problem may be that there is a small but significant\ngroup of users for whom safety messages do not\nresonate. Clickthrough rates for most malware or\nspam incidents consistently hover at around 3 percent,\naccording to data from Cisco ScanSafe. While\n3 percent may not seem high, imagine the impact of\nrepeated waves of spam to which 3 percent of workers\nconsistently respond to and click on. Even this small\npercentage is the equivalent of having a gaping hole\nin the network firewall that cannot be closed. Instead\nof trying to change human behavior, security researchers\nare exploring the possibility of changing the way we\nuse software to reduce risks.\n\n\nFor instance, all computer users are conditioned to click\non dialog buttons to initiate certain actions. Scammers\ncan simply design their schemes so that malware is\ndelivered, or the user is redirected somewhere else, by\nencouraging clicks. “Because of this automatic behavior,\nuser awareness campaigns based on the idea of not\nclicking on suspicious links or downloads don’t have a\nlot of impact,” says Gavin Reid, Cisco computer security\nincident response team manager. “We can’t fix this\nproblem with training—we need to fix it with software\nthat the end user can operate with confidence.”\n\nA tougher solution may be to establish harsher penalties\nfor workers who consistently ignore directives from IT\nabout social engineering—for instance, isolating or\n“sandboxing” problem users from network access until\nthey receive remedial training. The hardest-to-reach\nusers may not fully understand the impact of their actions,\nand they may not have compelling reasons to change\ntheir behavior. In addition, organizations need to\nmeasure the efficacy of their education programs—\nthere’s no point investing time and money in training\nthat consistently misses the mark.\n\nAlso on the horizon are tighter controls on how workers\nuse social networks like Facebook. Security solutions\nthat allow businesses to fine-tune how individuals\nnavigate around a social networking site, and what\ninformation they can post and share, already are on\nthe market.\n\nIn users’ defense, not all of the problems associated\nwith safe navigation of social networking stem from user\nignorance. Facebook’s frequent changes to its privacy\nand security settings can confound even the most expert\nsocial networker, making it challenging to know when\nand if one is truly shielding private information.\n\n\n_Scammers trick social network users into “liking” an intriguing Facebook page, allowing the scammers to see user profiles._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fake Profiles: Enabling Access  to Personal Information\n\nInstead of hacking into private social networking profiles,\nwhy not have your targets willingly show you the\npersonal information you need? The potential success\nof such a strategy was highlighted at the beginning of\n2010, when Thomas Ryan, founder of the firm Provide\nSecurity, created fictitious profiles on Facebook,\nLinkedIn, and Twitter for a woman named Robin Sage.\n\nSage was described as woman in her 20s with a degree\nfrom the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who\nanalyzed cyberthreats for the U.S. Department of the\nNavy. Her profile included a picture of an attractive\nyoung woman as an additional lure. “Robin” quickly\nmade connections with about 300 people in the U.S.\nmilitary, government agencies, security companies, and\ngovernment contractors.[13 ]According to DarkReading.com,\nthe fictitious woman was offered jobs by several firms,\nincluding Lockheed. Some of Sage’s connections said\nthey determined fairly quickly that the social networking\npages were fakes; on the other hand, Sage’s profiles\ncontinued to rack up high-level connections until\nRyan took them down in January 2010, a month after\ncreating them.\n\nThe lesson of Ryan’s experiment for security experts\nand all employees is that within social networks, even\nusers who think they are exercising caution by locking\nup information against people who aren’t members of\ntheir social networks can be put at risk by the careless\nacceptance of connection or friend requests.\n\n\n_The fake “Robin Sage” Twitter account was intended to attract highly placed officials within government and security._\n\n\nThe old adage, “If it sounds too good to be true, it\nprobably is,” should be put into play when it comes to\nresponding to social networking connection requests.\nA pretty young woman whose resume sounds a bit\ntoo advanced for her age, and who quickly amasses\nhundreds of friends, should raise suspicion—much the\nsame as a message from a supposed celebrity, or an\nalert that you’ve won a prize, should be viewed with\nskepticism.

They’re also combining several scam tactics to boost their chances of success.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe earliest cybercriminals specialized in casting a wide\nnet to find targets for their schemes. Poorly written\nspam messages, sent out by the millions, were aimed\nat any and all possible email addresses. Most of these\nmessages are now caught by spam filters, but a small\nfraction of recipients will still click through to download\nmalware unwittingly or decide to order nonexistent\npharmaceuticals.\n\nWhile broadly aimed spam still appears to be an effective\ntool, cybercriminals are seeing value in fine-tuning their\nefforts so that their malware reaches a single high-profile\ntarget or performs a specific function. The newest twist\nin “hypertargeting” is malware that is meant to disrupt\nindustrial systems—such as the Stuxnet network worm,\nwhich exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft\nWindows to infect and attempt to tamper with very\nspecific industrial systems, such as supervisory control\nand data acquisition (SCADA) systems.\n\n###### Example of Stuxnet Propagation\n\nStuxnet can find its way\n\u0003into the enterprise via\n\u0003infected USB drives.\n\n_Stuxnet is deliberately designed to spread to non-_\n_networked computers in order to eventually infect_\n_Step 7 project files. These files are used to program_\n_the PLC, which controls critical industrial processes._\n_This diagram is an example of Stuxnet propagation in_\n_an industrial control facility._\n\n\nWhile components of Stuxnet date back to 2009, the\nworm in its complete form was initially detected in\nJune 2010. The first known copy of the worm was\ndiscovered in a plant in Germany. A subsequent variant\nled to a widespread global outbreak.\n\nThe appearance of Stuxnet is sobering for several\nreasons, not the least of which is the worm’s potential\nto severely disrupt critical infrastructure. Stuxnet seems\nto have been designed to deflect remediation and\nresponse actions from security professionals. Operators\nbelieved that a default Siemens password (which had\nbeen made public on the web some years earlier) could\nnot be corrected by vendors without causing significant\ndifficulty for customers. The SCADA system operators\nmay have been laboring under a false sense of security\nthat since their systems were not connected to the\nInternet, they would not be prone to infection.\n\n\nStuxnet’s built-in features exploit both technical and\noperational trusted relationships—for instance, the\nmalware used stolen security certificates, fooling\nother systems into believing it was a legitimate piece\nof programming. Stuxnet has already been studied\nextensively, and much has been revealed about its inner\nworkings—providing a blueprint of sorts for future such\ncampaigns, and educating criminals on how exactly to\ncreate these exploits themselves.\n\n“Stuxnet showcases the determination, resources, and\ndangerous intent of today’s cybercriminals,” reports\nMary Landesman, senior security researcher at Cisco.\n“Stuxnet raises the already alarmingly high bar of data\nand intellectual property theft to an entirely new level—\nsabotage of our critical infrastructure.”\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n**Server/Website**\n\n**SIMATIC WinCC Supervisory Control**\n**and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System**\n\n**Programmable**\n**Logic Controller\u0003**\n**(PLC)**\n\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n**Server/Website**\n\n\nStuxnet can find its way\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Advanced Persistent Threats  Take Targeted Approach\n\nAdvanced persistent threats (APTs) have also adopted\nthe hypertargeting approach. Over the past several\nmonths, the definition of an APT has shifted, particularly\nsince the term has become a catchall definition for any\nkind of serious cybercriminal threat.\n\nIn the Cisco 2010 Midyear Security Report, APTs were\ndefined as attempts to infiltrate networks via a “lowand-slow” approach—that is, threats that lurk within a\nnetwork and remain undetected so that they could steal\ninformation over an extended period of time. This year,\n“APTs are more accurately defined as a threat that is\nhighly targeted toward specific individuals or with a\ndedicated mission in mind,” clarifies Rod Bachelor, senior\nproduct manager at Cisco. “Those who create APTs are\ngoing after people based on their access to information,\nsuch as intellectual property, that can be monetized.\nThese targeted attacks often use the same software\nused in conventional attacks, which can make them\nharder to distinguish.”\n\nAPTs are using social engineering to get a foot in the\ndoor of networks—like all other areas of cybercrime,\nAPT creators are exploiting trust to lure users into\ndownloading malware payloads. For instance, an APT\noperator might leverage LinkedIn to locate names of\nrelevant staff at a targeted organization—likely people\nwho have access to administrative passwords. The\nAPT operator then crafts a message to these targets,\ndesigned to persuade them to follow a link to malware.\nThis socially engineered approach can offer an easier\nentry path than exploiting network vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThe methods for detecting and thwarting APTs remain\nthe same as those discussed in the Cisco 2010\n_Midyear Security Report: multilevel defenses that_\ninvolve reputation scoring, consistent patching against\nvulnerabilities, and ongoing examination of outbound\ntraffic. These defenses also include educating users\non the specific threats or malware being aimed at\nthe organization or industry, educating users on how\nto navigate the Internet safely, protecting critical and\nconfidential data, only providing “need to know” access\nto information and data, and, in general, preventing and\nfending off social engineering campaigns (see “Seven\nDeadly Weaknesses,” page 19).\n\nOrganizations that are familiar with APTs often baseline\nlegitimate business traffic to more easily identify traffic\nthat is malicious—or at least different from legitimate\ntraffic. Correlating alerts and log messages from network\nand security devices may help as well.\n\n###### Java and PDFs: Widely in Use,  Heavily Exploited\n\nCybercriminals aim their campaigns at software programs,\ndevices, and operating systems where they can reach\nthe widest net of potential victims, as demonstrated by\nthe noticeable increase in exploits involving the Java\nprogramming language—and the ongoing use of PDF\ndocuments to launch exploits. At this point, Java appears\nto be the greater threat.\n\nThe flaws in Java have made it a promising target\nfor criminals—for instance, the Blackhole, Crimepack,\nand Eleonore exploit software packages, which are\ncreated by and sold to other criminals, make heavy\nuse of Java.[15] The latest exploits based on Java have\ncertain characteristics that make them worrisome from\na security standpoint. These exploits are:\n\n\n\n- Evasive: The most reliable detection for Java exploits\nis to run the exploits on a virtual machine, and then\nmonitor the systems for security violations—however,\nthis approach is prohibitively resource-intensive\nfor most organizations. Enterprises need security\nsolutions that can intercept and detect exploits on\nany device, regardless of whether they are on the\nnetwork (such as mobile devices using Java).\n\n- Pervasive: Java works in the background; for the\nmost part, users are not aware that it is running or\nwhether they’ve updated it recently. Therefore, it’s not\ndifficult for scammers to configure malware to check\nfor older versions of Java during exploits.\n\n- Invasive: Multiplatform interoperability is a hallmark\nof Java. While this is largely a benefit, it also makes it\neasy to distribute malware across several platforms,\nas well as any devices that run Java.\n\nWhen it comes to PDFs, organizations rely heavily on\nthese documents to conduct business, so the idea of\nlimiting their use within corporate networks is seen as\nimpossible. Yet Adobe Reader and Acrobat continue\nto be strong threat vectors online, even though such\nexploits are on the decline. It’s the rare business or\npersonal computer that doesn’t have the Adobe Reader\nsoftware for viewing PDFs, and computer users continue\nto place an undue amount of trust in these documents.\n\nIn September 2010, security researchers detected a\nzero-day exploit in which PDF documents were used\nto deliver a malicious file with a valid (but stolen)\nVeriSign signature for a credit union. The valid signature\nallowed the exploit to bypass two important defenses\nin the Microsoft Windows operating system.[16] The\ninfected PDFs were delivered in emails touting advice\nfrom prominent golfing coach David Leadbetter, and they\nprompted the recipient to open the PDF for more golf tips.\n\n\n15 “J A Gif E l i P k M k ” K b S i bl O b 11 2010 h //k b i [/2010/10/j](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/10/java-a-gift-to-exploit-pack-makers) if l i k k\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce again, trust exploitation was at work, with a Criminals Favoring Java Over PDFs\nmessage aimed at golf-friendly executives who would\n\nOnline criminals pay close attention to the success and\n\npresumably be eager to improve their game.

An\nOctober 2010 spam outbreak, featuring fake\niTunes purchase receipts and custom-crafted\nlinks, was a notable example of this strategy.\n\nIn this outbreak, individuals received emails with\na fictitious receipt for a purchase on the iTunes\nmusic and media service. The supposed invoice\nwas blank, and contained the text, “Click here if\nyou not see image” (sic). Recipients who clicked\non the link were asked to download a fake\nPDF reader, and then redirected to an infected\nwebpage that contained the Zeus malware,\nwhich steals banking data.\n\nThe creators of this scam used several tactics:\n\n    - They used familiar consumer brands—in this\ncase, Apple iTunes—to lure victims into\nclicking on links.\n\n    - They compromised thousands of legitimate\nwebsites so that users would think they\nhad reached a legitimate site, not one that\nwould deliver malware.\n\n    - They redirected people to fake pharmaceutical\nwebsites and fake anti-virus sites.\n\nNew on the horizon are exploits delivered via\nsocial networking that can infiltrate multiple\nplatforms. In early November, researchers\ndetected malware called Java/Boonana, which\nis sent to Facebook users and is downloaded\nby unsuspecting users via a link to a supposed\nvideo. The malware is written in Java, and can\ninfect computers using Microsoft Windows,\nApple, or Linux operating systems.[18]\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Building Better Security Into Passwords\n\nIn spite of pleading from IT professionals to choose\ntough-to-guess security passwords, workers are\nstill disconcertingly likely to come up with something\nlike “password1!”—or simply attach a few numbers,\nlike “123,” to the end of a word. The problem of\nweak, guessable passwords is not a new one, but it\nisn’t going away—in fact, it’s getting worse, as users\nare forced to create several passwords for different\nsystems and change them every 60 or 90 days.\n\nNo wonder users default to using the least\ncomplicated password that their systems allow, and\nmake only minor variations when forced to change\nthem. Unfortunately, such passwords are easy to\nguess. At the other end of the scale are passwords\nthat are randomly generated by the software solutions\nthemselves, which are difficult for users to remember.\n\nIn a recent paper coauthored by Cisco, Florida State\n\nA better practice, say the researchers, is an external\n\nUniversity, and Redjack LLC, researchers examined\n\npassword creation policy that changes a password\n\nhow different password requirements affected\n\nafter it is created to add a guaranteed amount of\n\npassword strength—such as requiring the use of a\n\nrandomness—for example, adding two random\n\nminimal password length or the addition of a special The problem of weak,\n\ndigits to the end of a password.

Through these discussions,\nprivate-public partnerships have emerged as the\nmost promising approach for tackling such issues as\ninformation sharing, cross-country collaboration, cloud\ncomputing, and identity management.\n\nENISA is also heading EP3R, the European Public Private\nPartnership for Resilience. EP3R is the flexible Europewide governance framework for resilience of information\nand communication technology infrastructure, which\nworks to foster cooperation between the public and\nprivate sectors on security and resilience objectives,\nbaseline requirements, policy practices, and measures.\n\n\n###### Geopolitical Trends:  Cooperate or Separate?\n\nThe ongoing process of developing and refining global\nstandards for security and information technology has\ncome up against the desire of some governments to\ncreate domestic standards around IT solutions that can\nbe deployed within their borders. In fact, this struggle\nto maintain global standards versus instances of nonstandard domestic requirements surpasses hardware\nand software, and can affect network architecture and\nbusiness processes as well.\n\nInformation technology networks are based on global\nstandards that help ensure interoperability and security.\nIn security, these goals are achieved by international\nstandards bodies such as the Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF) and the Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE); for product assurance,\nthese goals are achieved by the Common Criteria, an\nInternational Organization for Standardization standard\nand the subject of a multilateral agreement among 26\nnations, known as the Common Criteria Recognition\nArrangement.\n\n###### In the EU, private-public partnerships have emerged as the most promising approach to tackling many policy and operational issues around cybersecurity.\n\n\n2010 saw a number of countries attempt to use\nnonstandard domestic requirements for product\nassurance, along with a corresponding reaction by\na majority of countries to return to the primacy of\ninternational standards such as the Common Criteria.\nCisco and other companies are leading an effort to\nembrace, reform, and extend the Common Criteria in\norder to drive the benefits of increased security, and\nextend the benefits of global innovation in products\nand systems.\n\nAn example of the complexities of these collaborative\nsecurity efforts is the ongoing debate, led primarily\nwithin the EU but taking place in many countries, on\nprotecting personal data in cross-border computing\nsystems. Countries recognize that the interests and\nconcerns of their own citizens must be raised if they are\nto be recognized in regulations that affect cross-border\ntransactions—although these differing standards can\naffect the development of technologies that are meant\nto be in use globally.\n\nEU privacy laws limit the transfer of personal data\noutside the EU’s borders and arguably has restricted\nthe growth of cloud computing in Europe.

Cybercriminals are responding by shifting  their focus to the ever-expanding legion of mobile users.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it’s only beginning to percolate, a trend is clearly\nemerging: Cybercriminals, looking for new opportunities\noutside of the PC environment, are investing more\nresources toward developing exploits that specifically\ntarget users of mobile devices. Most notably, perhaps,\nwas the emergence of SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr in late\n2009 (see page 7), which represented the first known\nappearance of mobile malware featuring the powerful\nand pervasive banking Trojan, Zeus.\n\nTaking advantage of the rapidly multiplying number of\nmobile users worldwide makes business sense. Lessdeveloped nations are particularly ripe for opportunity:\nAccording to the United Nation’s telecommunications\nagency, the International Telecommunications Union\n\n\n(ITU), even though high-speed Internet is still out\nof reach for many citizens of poorer nations, mobile\ntelephony is filling the void because it is available\nand affordable. The ITU estimates that by the end of\n2010, of the more than 5 billion mobile subscriptions\nworldwide, 3.8 billion will be in the developing world.\nAnd by late 2010, ITU predicted mobile penetration\nin developing countries would reach 68 percent.[22]\n\nThis shift in focus toward mobile users is being spurred\nfor another reason: A significant “tipping point” in\nvulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are\nbuilding better security into their products, and they are\nmoving faster than ever to provide updates, alert users\nto potential flaws, and make patches available to users.\n\n\nThis means it is becoming increasingly time-consuming\nand resource-intensive to find ways to exploit platforms\nthat once were so lucrative—in particular, the Microsoft\nWindows platform. “For a long time, cybercriminals have\nfound many opportunities to take advantage of users\nthrough the Windows PC,” notes Patrick Peterson, senior\nsecurity researcher and Cisco Fellow. “It was easy, so\nwhy go anywhere else? But now, the Windows operating\nsystem is in much better shape—and criminals are\ngetting hungry.”\n\n###### Cybercriminals’ shift in focus toward mobile users and away from the PC environment is being spurred partly by a significant “tipping point” in vulnerabilities.\n\n\n###### is being spurred partly by a significant “tipping point” in vulnerabilities.\n\n\n###### Cybercriminals’ shift in focus\n\n\n-----\n\nPeterson likens cybercriminals to bears who have been\n“feasting on Windows boxes for a long time.” He adds,\n“The Windows platform was the ‘slowest hiker’ in the\nwoods. But now, it’s getting harder for the bears to\ncatch, so other platforms are in more danger. Apple’s\niOS and Mac OS and the Google Android OS are hikers\nthat the bears have largely ignored, but now, these\nplatforms are looking much tastier.” Peterson concludes,\n“Just keep in mind, if you are a vendor facing the threat\nof bears, to survive you don’t have to be faster than\nthe bears—just faster than the slowest hiker.”\n\n_For a long time, the Microsoft Windows platform was easy game_\n_as the “slowest hiker.” But now that it is more secure and harder to_\n_exploit, other platforms, like Apple’s Mac operating system and the_\n_Google Android operating system, are in greater danger of being_\n_targeted by cybercriminals (the “bears”)._\n\n\n###### Android and Apple Operating Systems Likely Key Targets in 2011\n\nThe “bears” may be changing their hunting patterns, but\ncybercriminals are still very much in the research and\ndevelopment phase with their methods of snaring victims\nusing mobile devices. Over the past two years, there\nhave been a number of phishing scams, mostly regional\nin focus, targeting individuals or select groups—such as\ncustomers of local banks or credit unions. And Apple’s\nproducts, including iPhones, iPads, and the iTunes media\nservice, have all been recent targets (for more on Apple\nvulnerabilities, see sidebar “Recent Spike in Exploits\nTargeting Apple Users” on page 33).\n\nAs for the Apple iPhone, users of the newly released\niOS 4 have benefitted from more than 60 patches\ndesigned to fix security vulnerabilities, including an\nexploit that allowed third-party applications (“apps”) to\naccess information on an iPhone user’s location without\npermission. However, many users are undermining\nthe security of their smartphones and other devices,\nincluding iPads and iTouch devices, by “jailbreaking”\nthem. Discussed in previous Cisco security reports,\njailbreaking is a process that allows users to unlock the\niOS, thereby removing Apple-imposed limitations on\nwhat apps they can download and from where.\n\nIn July 2010, the U.S. Library of Congress added\njailbreaking to its list of actions that do not violate\ncopyright protections—leaving iPhone users free to\nunlock their devices and download applications not\nauthorized by Apple. Only a week after the ruling,\nJailbreakMe 2.0, the one-click, mobile, Safari-based\niPhone jailbreak utility, was unveiled. The new tool makes\nit easier than ever for users to jailbreak their phones; in\nthe past, some advanced technical skill was required.\nThe advent of this tool also revealed a significant security\nflaw in the iOS 4 (which Apple has since patched) that\ncould leave iPhone users with jailbroken phones more\nsusceptible to hackers who could gain access to root\nprivileges and essentially take control of the devices.\n\n\nSince the Library of Congress lifted the threat of legal\nliability from Apple customers looking to unlock their\ndevices, more than a million users have jailbroken their\niPhones, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation,\na San Francisco-based privacy rights organization\nthat petitioned the library. And users are finding ample\nopportunity to download unofficial iPhone apps, including\nthose from a market called Cydia, which provides access\nto “Installous” from Hackulous, an app that offers free,\npirated versions of thousands of apps available through\nthe iTunes store.\n\nMeanwhile, many users are avoiding the hassle of\njailbreaking their iPhones and instead are fully embracing\nthe open architecture of the Google Android smartphone\noperating system. In fact, market share for the Android\nOS expanded significantly during 2010, and the opensource operating system is proving to be a significant,\ncompetitive threat to the Apple iPhone (both operating\nsystems are still trailing Research in Motion’s BlackBerry\nOS, however, in terms of popularity by numbers).[23]\n\n“Three years ago, there was no Android. Now, there\nare only a few major handset manufacturers that aren’t\ndeveloping devices based on Android,” says Cisco threat\nresearch manager Scott Olechowski. “The growth of this\nplatform will be exponential. From smartphones and\ntablet PCs to cars and refrigerators, we will see billions\nof devices, including a massive number in the enterprise,\nrelying on this platform within the next few years. The\nrelative youth of the Android OS, including its apps and\necosystem, combined with the sheer number of users\nwill make this a very attractive platform for exploitation.”\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Recent Spike in Exploits Targeting Apple Users\n\nA few years ago, Apple and its operating system user base, providing an attractive pool of potential\nand products were viewed as somewhat impervious targets.” In other words, Apple has reached the\nto criminal hacks—at least, less vulnerable than “tipping point” at which scammers see potential in\nMicrosoft Windows and other PC systems. That shifting their exploits to a new venue.\npicture is changing: Over the past five years, Apple\nhas released a growing number of security updates To its credit, Apple has taken substantial steps\nin response to the vulnerabilities detected in its (beyond those of many other vendors) to protect\nproducts. According to data from Cisco IntelliShield, its technologies against exploits—for instance,\nwhile reported vulnerabilities and updates are on the creating a tightly controlled application store that\nrise from most major vendors, Apple is showing the limits malicious application postings, developing\ngreatest increase. “As with most large vendors with proprietary controls to limit user environments,\na broad product base and many new product and and making Java installations more secure.

According to recent data from market research\nfirm comScore, smartphones—while representing only\nabout 25 percent of the total U.S. wireless subscriber\nmarket—accounted for 60 percent of app downloads\nand nearly 56 percent of mobile browser access for a\nthree-month period ending August 2010, up from 43.6\npercent and 41.4 percent, respectively, over the same\nperiod in 2009.[24] And according to a recent Pew Internet\nstudy, the average U.S. adult has 18 apps on his or\nher smartphone—and 20 percent of cell phone users\nunder the age of 30 download apps frequently.\n\nWeather, mapping, social networking, search, and\nnews apps are among the types of mobile apps most\nfrequently downloaded by adults. But game apps,\naccording to the Nielsen App Playbook, are most\npopular: 60 percent of adult users (those over the age\nof 18) have used a game app in the past 60 days.\n\nUnfortunately, cybercriminals channeling more energy\ninto the mobile market have already honed in on taking\nadvantage of younger users. This is not surprising,\nthough, considering the statistics: Mediamark Research\nand Intelligence reports that the number of children\nusing cell phones has doubled since 2005. Today, one\nin five children in the United States between the ages\nof 6 and 11 carries a cell phone. And what do they like\nto do with Internet-enabled mobile devices? Browse\nthe web and download games.\n\nOne notable example of an exploit aimed at compromising\nyounger mobile device users came to light in mid-2010.\nIt was discovered that free wallpaper apps uploaded to\nthe Android Market, featuring themes popular with children\nsuch as Star Wars and My Little Pony, were collecting\nunnecessary information from subscribers such as\n\n|3.|6|\n|---|---|\n\n\nmobile device phone numbers and subscriber identifier\nand currently programmed voicemail numbers (but\nnot voicemail passwords or SIM card numbers). The\ninformation was sent to a site—www.imnet.us—owned by\nsomeone in Shenzen, China. The app was downloaded\nmillions of times before the surreptitious data-collecting\nactivity was discovered.\n\n“Third-party mobile apps are emerging as a serious\nthreat vector. And right now, that market is like the Wild\nWest,” warns Horacio Zambrano, product line manager\nfor Cisco. “No one is looking at these apps and\ndetermining what is a ‘good app’ or a ‘bad app.’”\n\n\n###### Slow Emergence: Cybersecurity  Strategy for the Mobile Enterprise\n\nBusinesses are becoming more receptive—partly by\nchoice, partly by necessity—to mobile working and\nless resistant to the consumerization of IT. In fact, the\nrecent financial crisis has motivated cash-strapped\norganizations to allow employees to purchase the mobile\ndevices they prefer, simply because it is more costeffective for the organization. Other leading companies\nhave taken the position that mobile devices are part\nof modern employees’ basic “uniform” for work, and\ntherefore expect them to purchase their own devices.\n\nIT security professionals are hopeful that, as they allow\nmore types of mobile devices into the organization, more\nmobile device manufacturers will prioritize many of the\nsame business-friendly security features that have\nmade Research in Motion’s BlackBerry devices popular\nwith enterprises, such as PIN locking, data deletion, and\ncamera control enabled through remote enforcement.\n\nSome organizations are also beginning to recognize\nthat they should assign the responsibility of mobile\nmanagement and security to a dedicated specialist or\nteam. But many businesses currently lack the resources\nto establish a fully fledged function, and the IT personnel\nalready responsible for mobility issues—such as managing\npolicies for the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) or\nenabling iPhones for a select group of executives—do\nnot have the time to take on full ownership of the\nmobility issue.\n\n“In the classic enterprise organization today, no one\ntruly owns—or wants to own—the mobility issue,” says\nTom Gillis, vice president and general manager of\nthe Security Technology Business Unit at Cisco.\n“This is actually part of the reason that the adoption\nof consumer-driven smartphones in the enterprise has\nbeen slow. When it comes to enabling these devices\nand making sure they are secure, no one is stepping up.”\n\n\n24 “S h S b ib N C i M j i f M bil B d A li i U i U S ” S I di l O b 20 0\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Mobility and Virtualization Trends Contributing to Renewed Focus on Data Loss Prevention\n\nRigorous compliance demands, high-profile incidents As for the security benefits: If data is not resident on tremendous boon to forward-thinking organizations\nof data loss, and the potential security risks due to an end devices, it is not as easy for criminals who steal who embrace them and adapt their security policies\nexpanding mobile workforce and growing number of employees’ equipment to access sensitive enterprise appropriately to support these new ways of working.\nmobile devices in use in the enterprise have brought data, such as financial information and intellectual\nabout a renewed focus on data loss prevention (DLP) property.

One trend\nto watch, particularly in the healthcare and financial\nsectors, is the “containerization” of corporate data.\nMore enterprises likely will explore the option of using\ndigital certificates in an effort to “containerize” mobile\nusers and prevent data loss in the event a mobile\ndevice is lost or stolen.\n\nEnterprises are also focusing more attention on DLP\nbecause of the virtualization trend. More organizations\nare accessing hosted services through the cloud that\notherwise might be too expensive to purchase or\ndifficult to implement. But virtualization presents both\nrisks and benefits from a cybersecurity perspective.\nWhen data is moving from the network, to hosted\nservices providers, to devices such as employees’\nsmartphones and laptops, and then back to the\nnetwork, how is it being protected?\n\n\n-----\n\n### The Cisco Global ARMS Race Index\n\n###### The level of compromised resources worldwide has decreased slightly since 2009—a positive sign. But what lies ahead for 2011? It would seem  the only major hurdle to cybercriminals’ success is their ongoing struggle  to profit fully from their exploits.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe annual Cisco Global ARMS Race Index, inspired\nby the Richter Scale used to measure earthquake\nmagnitude, tracks “Adversary Resource Market Share”\n(ARMS). The index provides a way to measure the\noverall level of compromised resources worldwide—the\nnetworks and machines currently under “adversarial\ncontrol.” Cisco security experts created the index as\na way to gain a better understanding of overall trends\nbased on the global online criminal community’s\nactivities and their rates of success at compromising\nboth enterprise and individual users.\n\nAccording to data collected for this year’s index,\nthe aggregate number that represents the level of\ncompromised resources at the end of 2010 is 6.8,\ndown from the December 2009 level of 7.2, which was\nreported in the Cisco 2009 Annual Report. This means\nenterprise networks are still experiencing persistent\ninfections, while consumer systems continue to be\ninfected at levels capable of producing consistent and\nalarming rates of service abuse; however, the\ntrend shows that infections of enterprise networks and\nconsumer systems are less frequent compared to\n12 months ago.\n\nTo arrive at this year’s measurement on the 10-point\nindex, Cisco relied on leading botnet-tracking estimates\nof total bots and other data points derived through\n[internal research and other expert sources, such as The](http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/)\n[Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks cybercriminal](http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/)\nactivity and is comprised of volunteer security\nprofessionals from around the world. The methodology\nfor the Global ARMS Race Index is based on:\n\n- Current aggregate botnet size\n\n- Statistics used to estimate the total number of\nInternet-connected systems in the world\n\n- Estimates on home and work infection rates, which\nmeasure factors like resource availability (such as\nbandwidth and computing power)\n\n\n\n- The high-profile takedowns of botnets such as\nWaledac, Mariposa (reportedly, the largest botnet\never), and Cutwail have had an impact on the reduced\nCisco Global ARMS Race Index number for 2010.\n(To read more about recent botnet disruption, see\nthe Cisco 2010 Cybercrime Showcase, page 4.)\nAccording to data collected for the index, the average\nbotnet size is one-third smaller compared to 12\nmonths ago. However, this doesn’t mean that\nbotnets are weakening threats; in fact, they may be\nstrengthening. “For cybercriminals, how many botnets\nyou have in operation, and their size, are no longer\nimportant,” emphasizes Seth Hanford, Intelligence\nOperations team lead at Cisco. “It’s what you can\ndo with them.”\n\nIn addition, global spam levels have declined overall,\neven though there has been an uptick in spam in\ndeveloped economies where broadband Internet is\nspreading (see Global Spam Update: Spam Down\nGlobally, but on the Rise in Europe, page 29). Authorities\nworldwide are taking the spam problem more seriously,\nas well, and have been successful at taking down some\negregious offenders.\n\nOne example: In October 2010, Russian authorities\nlaunched their first criminal investigation against a man\nthey believe is responsible for spreading 20 percent\nof the world’s spam—primarily spam featuring offers\nfor extremely low-priced prescription drugs (mostly\nfor male enhancement) from unlicensed distributor,\nCanadian Pharmacy.[25] The alleged spammer, Igor Gusev,\noperated SpamIt.com, which provided website design\nand order fulfillment services for spammers. When the\nsite stopped operating in late September 2010, global\nspam volume was reduced by more than 60 billion\nmessages per day, according to Cisco research. As of\nJanuary 2011, Gusev was still on the run and believed\nto be outside Russia, but Russian authorities are working\nwith Interpol to locate him.\n\n\n###### The Cisco Global ARMS Race Index\n\n**December**\n\n###### 7.2 2009\n\n**December**\n\n#### 6.8 2010 Level\n\n**9.5+:** More resources are under rogue control than\nlegitimate control.

This is a decline from the 2009 level of 7.2,_\n_showing that infections of enterprise networks and consumer_\n_systems are less frequent compared to 12 months ago._\n\n\n**December**\n\n###### 7.2 2009\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso contributing to the lower level of compromised\nresources worldwide is the “tipping point” in\nvulnerabilities, discussed in detail earlier in this report\n(see The Tipping Point: Cybercriminals Targeting\nMobile Platforms, page 30). PC vendors are building\nbetter security into their products and are issuing\nalerts and patches at unprecedented speed. Wanting\nto use their time and resources wisely, many criminals\nare abandoning their efforts to take advantage of\nweaknesses in the Microsoft Windows platform and\nare focusing more attention on mobile platforms such\nas the Apple iOS and Android OS. Other miscreants,\nmeanwhile, are simply adapting their techniques to\nseize opportunities in an increasingly mobile world. The\nemergence of the SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr—the first known\nversion of the Zeus Trojan designed as mobile malware—\nunderscores the shift in focus by more cybercriminals\ntoward mobile users (for more on SymbOS/Zitmo.Altr,\nsee page 7).\n\nBank fraud enabled by credential-stealing Trojans like\nZeus that target both traditional and mobile Internet\nusers is poised to remain a favorite moneymaker for\ncybercriminals in the year ahead. “Now that malware\ndevelopers reportedly have merged the Zeus codebase\nwith that of the SpyEye Trojan, expect the banking Trojan\nthreat to only increase in potency in the coming months,”\ncautions Andy Norton, threat response manager at Cisco.\n\nHowever, one recent, positive development has been\ninternational law enforcement’s increased vigilance\ntoward tracking and taking down cybercrime networks\nthat execute bank fraud with help from banking Trojans.\nIn October 2010, for example, authorities, after a lengthy\ninvestigation, exposed a well-established, multinational\ngroup of scammers delivering malware via Zeus. (Their\n\n\n###### “For cybercriminals, how many\n botnets you have in operation, and their size, are no longer important.

Operation “Trident\nBreach” was launched in May 2009 after FBI agents in\nOmaha, Nebraska, learned of automated clearing house\n(ACH) batch payments, initiated by money mules, that\nwere sent to 46 separate bank accounts in the United\nStates.[27] (For more about money mules, see page 8.)\n\nWhile there has been good news to report in 2010,\nthere is still a big question mark on the cybercrime\nhorizon that must be monitored in the months\nahead: Stuxnet—the “Evil” award winner in this year’s\nCybercrime Showcase (see page 4). As discussed\n\n\nearlier in this report, the worm has the potential to\nseverely disrupt industrial computing systems, such as\nthose used for facilities like power stations—and can\ndeflect remediation and response actions from security\nprofessionals. Cisco cybersecurity experts predict that\nStuxnet is the debut offering in a new area for extensive\nresearch and development by some cybercriminals:\nhypertargeted malware.\n\nStuxnet is considered a question mark by cybersecurity\nexperts because its potential is difficult to assess: It\ncan be programmed with enough intelligence to carry\nout a very specific action against a particular target,\nand essentially, defend itself against the efforts of\nsecurity personnel. Experts warn that variants of Stuxnet\ncould be developed to target a wide range of critical\ninfrastructure, from water supplies to transportation\nsystems—or even industrial or business targets, such\nas chemical or automotive plants.[28]\n\nWhat this type of threat is capable of in the future will be\nlargely determined by what the cybercriminals designing\nand deploying it intend to achieve, and what their own\ntechnological capabilities are. In a November 2010\nhearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland\nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, Michael Assante,\npresident of the National Board of Information Security\nExaminers (NBISE), a not-for-profit certification body\nfocused on information security practices and policies,\nsaid, “Stuxnet is, at the very least, an important wakeup call for digitally enhanced and reliant countries—at its\nworst, a blueprint for future attackers.” He added that\nthe malware’s sophistication “should disturb security\nprofessionals, engineers, businessmen, and government\nleaders alike.”[29]\n\n\n###### botnets you have in operation,\n\n\n###### and their size, are no longer\n\n\n###### do with them.”\n\n\n26 “Global Law Enforcement Cooperation Key in Disruption of Cybercrime Ring,” by SecurityWeek News, SecurityWeek.com, October 4, 2010,\n[www.securityweek.com/global-law-enforcement-cooperation-key-disruption-cybercrime-ring.](http://www.securityweek.com/global-law-enforcement-cooperation-key-disruption-cybercrime-ring)\n\n27 Ibid.\n\n28 “Son of Stuxnet?

Therefore, in the months ahead, expect\ncybercriminals worldwide to focus more resources\ntoward developing money muling operations that\nare more sophisticated, creative, complex, and\nmultinational, and structured and managed in a way\nthat enables perpetrators to attract more “candidates”\nfor hire, achieve quick profits, conceal their ultimate\nwhereabouts, and stay ahead of law enforcement.\n\n\nAnd while this year’s Cisco Global ARMS Race Index\nshows a modest reduction in the number of compromised\nresources worldwide compared to 2009, what has not\nabated is criminals’ reliance on trust exploitation. Expect\nto see more creativity in campaigns against select\nindividuals, either taking advantage of someone’s trust,\nor compromising others to reach an intended target.\n\nThere is also the potential for more Stuxnet-style\ntargeting of corporations and infrastructure, carried\nout by ambitious or vengeful cybercriminals who may\neither work alone or are enlisted by others to carry\nout misdeeds and create disruption—or, at least, incite\nfear around the prospect of “What if?”\n\n\nThe headline-grabbing DDoS attacks launched in late\n2010 by supporters of WikiLeaks.org do not mark a shift\nin how profit-oriented cybercriminals will be investing\ntheir resources in the year ahead (see The Cisco\nCybercrime Return on Investment Matrix, page 6). But\nthese events should motivate organizations to review the\nstrength of current cybersecurity measures, including\nexisting threat response and disruption reduction plans,\nwhile also protecting their data, employees, customers,\nand partners.\n\n“We predicted that we would see more politically\nmotivated online attacks in 2010,” notes Patrick\nPeterson, senior security researcher and Cisco Fellow.\n“So, the ‘hacktivism’ following WikiLeaks was not a\nsurprise—it’s a trend that’s been on the rise since 2007.\nIf people want to make a statement, and be heard,\nit’s only logical they would do so through the Internet.\nWhat’s more interesting, perhaps, is how easy it was for\nhackers to create disruption for some major businesses.\nThat’s really the wake-up call. Enterprises must take\nseriously the need to maintain effective cybersecurity\nbecause they could be targeted at anytime, for any\nreason, by anybody.”\n\nFor many operators in the shadow economy, the interest\nis no longer in how many victims they can touch. They\nknow they can collect what they need from more than\nenough faceless victims, and thanks to the proliferation\nof mobile devices, have the opportunity to target even\nmore individuals worldwide. Moving forward, the real\nchallenge for some of the more sophisticated players\nin the cybercrime community will be whether they can\nbend technology enough to their advantage so they\ncan target with precision exactly the person, business,\norganization, or government they want to somehow\ninfluence or cause harm to, and carry out a highly specific\nmission successfully, or even repeatedly, before detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cisco Security Intelligence Operations\n\n\n### Cisco Security Intelligence Operations\n\n\nIt has become an increasing challenge to manage and\nsecure today’s distributed and agile networks.
