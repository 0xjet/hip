A few\n[months later, we began working together with fellow malware analysts from ESET to analyze samples used by](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/14/mikroceen-spying-backdoor-high-profile-networks-central-asia/)\nthe group to spy on a telecommunications company, a gas company, and a governmental institution in Central\nAsia. An APT group, which we believe could possibly be from China, planted backdoors to gain long-term\naccess to corporate networks. Based on our analysis, we suspect the group was also behind attacks active in\nMongolia, Russia, and Belarus.\n\nThe group behind the attack frequently recompiled their custom tools to avoid AV detection, which, in addition\nto the backdoors, included Mimikatz and Gh0st RAT. This has led to a large number of samples, with binaries\noften protected by VMProtect, making analysis more difficult.\n\nThe backdoors gave the actors the ability to manipulate and delete files, take screenshots, manipulate\nprocesses, and services, as well as execute console commands, remove itself, and more. Further, some\ncommands may have instructed the backdoors to exfiltrate data to a C&C server. Infected devices could also\nbe commanded by a C&C server to act as a proxy or listen on a specific port on every network interface. The\ngroup also used tools such as Gh0st RAT and Management Instrumentation to move laterally within infiltrated\nnetworks.\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of events related to the tracking of Microcin, and Avast notifying the targeted company\n_Avast’s and Eset’s antivirus engines blocked the samples used by the APT group prior to it attracting our_\n_attention, as our antivirus engines’ detections are automated._\n\n## Attribution & Clusterization\n\n[The samples we analyzed contain links to malware samples and campaigns, such as Microcin,](https://securelist.com/a-simple-example-of-a-complex-cyberattack/82636/) [BYEBY, and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threat-actors-target-government-belarus-using-cmstar-trojan/)\n[Vicious Panda, previously described by Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks, and Check Point, respectively. The](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\nbackdoors we found are custom tools that have not previously been analyzed, as far as we know. The majority\nof the C&C servers are registered to Choopa, LLC, a hosting platform that has been used by cybercriminals in\nthe [past. A GoDaddy registrar was also seen early in the campaign, these servers were removed early on.](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting)\n\nWe suspect the APT group behind these attacks is from China. Gh0st RAT, one of the tools used, has been\nknown to be used by Chinese APT groups in the past. Similarities in the code used in the Vicious Panda\ncampaign, (TTPS, especially the use of the RTF Weaponizer in the infection vector), which is also thought to\nhave come from China, and the code we analyzed, also lead us to believe the group might be from China. The\ntargeted companies and institutions, as well as the professional coding point to an APT group.\n\n## Toolset\n\n### Backdoors\n\nThroughout our analysis, we stumbled upon the following backdoors. Details on these backdoors are provided\nbelow the complete list of backdoors.\n\n**_sqllauncher.dll_** (VMProtected backdoor)\n\nbbc5a9a49757abdbfcaca22f3b2a8b7e79f61c30d31812a0ccc316536eb58ca3\nC&C server 45.76.132[.]207\n\n**_logon.dll (VMProtected backdoor)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n61e4c91803d0d495681400fb9053b434f4852fdad1a305bbcec45ee0b2926d6a\nC&C server 45.76.132[.]207\n\n**_logsupport.dll_** (VMProtected backdoor)\n\nd5c1e947d84791ac8e6218652372905ddb7d3bc84ff04e709d635f60e7224688\nC&C server 104.194.215[.]194\n\n**_pcaudit.bat_**\n\n1395B863AE5697EA5096F4E2EBEF54FC20D5380B6921F8835D1F030F2BA16A40\n\n## Technical details (pcaudit.bat)\n\n_pcaudit.bat is a batch file that is used to invoke the svchost.exe in order to load the DLL file for a given service_\nspecified in the registry. This batch file is responsible for the backdoor’s persistence. The contents of the\n_pcaudit.bat script can be found below:_\n\nFigure 2: The batch file that is responsible for the backdoor’s persistence\n\n## Technical details (sqllauncher.dll, logon.dll)\n\nBoth DLLs, sqllauncher.dll and logon.dll, are primarily used as backdoors. These are installed as services by\nthe aforementioned batch file. They both create a log file under the path:\n_%COMMON_DOCUMENT%\\WZ9JuN00.tmp aggregating errors during the backdoor’s runtime. Each entry_\ncontains an error code, an error message, and a timestamp formatted as “[yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss] %error\n_code% %message%”._\n\nIf the infected device can’t connect to the C&C server, the malware attempts to determine whether the traffic is\nrouted through a proxy. This information may be retrieved either from %WINDOWS%\\debug\\netlogon.cfg or\nfrom the TCP table. After successfully connecting to the C&C server, a secure communication channel\n(Schannel) is established and telemetry (OS version, username) is sent to the C&C server. The following\ncommands are issued by the C&C server:\n\n**Command** **SubCommand** **Parameter** **Description** **Original**\n**command**\n\n\nAmbYDkEx – – Send malware version to the\nC&C\n\neYTS5IwW – – Terminate previously launched\npayload\n\nKi0Swb7I – – Send all used drive letters to the\nC&C\n\n\nWELCOM\n\nLIST D\n\n\n-----\n\n5fdi2TfG – – Start remote shell STARTC\n\nh71RBG8X – %command% Execute “cmd %command%” via\nCreateProcess API\n\n\nJ8AoctiB QHbU0hQo %path%,\n%subcommand%\n\nJ8AoctiB hwuvE43y %path%,\n%subcommand%,%data%\n\n\nRead from %path% and send\ndata to C&C\n\n\nUPLOAD\n\n\nWrite %data% into %path% DOWNLO\n\n\ngRQ7mIYr – %command% Execute %command% via\nCreateProcess API\n\n## Technical details (logsupport.dll)\n\n\nEXECUT\n\n\nSimilarly to the previous DLLs, the logsupport.dll is primarily used as a backdoor, but uses a different C&C\nserver than the other backdoors. Its corresponding log file is located at %TEMP%\\rar%[A-Z0-9]{4}%.tmp. The\nstructure of the log file is also the same. The main difference is that the log file is encrypted by a XOR cipher\nwith a hardcoded key.\n\nFigure 3: Log file is decrypted by a\n\nXOR cipher with a hardcoded key\nThis backdoor checks whether the malware is running in a virtualized environment. Additionally, the DLL\nfingerprints the infected device (NETBIOS name, IP address, username, OS version, MAC address and RAM\nusage, OEM code page, token information, number of CPU cores, is64bit), and sends this information to the\nC&C server.\n\nThe communication with the C&C server is encrypted by a simple stream cipher. If the malware fails to\nestablish an encrypted channel, it checks whether a proxy is being used, using different methods than the\nprevious two DLLs. It tries to connect to http://www.google.com/index.asp and retrieve information about a\npossible proxy from the connection, and it also checks the value of ProxyServer in the Windows registry key:\n\n_HKLM\\Software\\Microsft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings._\n\nBased on what we saw in the code, the backdoor is also capable of accepting various commands from the\nC&C server. These commands allow the backdoor to manipulate files (move, read, delete, check existence),\nmanipulate processes (create, terminate, retrieve parent, and process ID) and Windows services (start, stop,\n\n\n-----\n\ncheck), execute console commands, remove itself, and more. Some of these commands (read/check file,\ncheck services, check processes) also send data back to C&C. The infected device can also be commanded\nby C&C to act as a proxy or listen on a specific port on every network interface.\n\nInterestingly, the backdoor has a set of commands specifically targeting files with .tu and .tut file extension.\nThese commands may similarly check for their existence, send their content back to the C&C, and modify their\ncontent (append or rewrite by data given by the C&C server).\n\n## Other tools\n\n### Lateral Movement via Mimikatz\n\nfc66353fb26fd82227700beb47c4fa90118cea151eb1689fd8bf48e93fda71d0\n\n[Mimikatz is an open source project by a French security researcher named Benjamin Delpy which started in](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n2007. It is a robust tool that exploits various Windows authentication schemes and dumps credential-related\ndata from a Windows Local Security Account database. For these reasons it is often misused by a wide\nspectrum of APT actors such as the Lazarus Group or Telebots.\n\nThe Mimikatz version used in this campaign has a two-stage installation mechanism (installer.exe installing\n_Yokel64.exe and mktz64.dll), and contains a PDB string “E:\\2018_\\MimHash\\mimikatz\\Bin\\mktzx64.pdb”._\nCalling a mktz64.dll exported function MktzDumpbyInjection inside our testing virtual machine yields the\nfollowing output:\n\n#1 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = Administrator,nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889\n\n#2 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = IEUser, nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889\n\n### Lateral Movement via WMI\n\n2615e5585a5db77b973c74e0a87551978a9322c820362a148a995e571923b59c\n\nThe lateral movement via WMI is done with a file that parses its own filename, which we suspect uses the\nfollowing format: “@@<ComputerName>,<UserName>,<Password>,.exe”. Afterwards, the data described in\nthe filename is extracted and used to establish a remote console to a computer identified by the retrieved\nname. Afterwards, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is leveraged to set a strict proxy security,\nleading to the encryption of arguments of each remote procedure call, and allowing the server to access local\nresources. Then WMI is used again to retrieve the Win32_Process class which in turn is used to create a\nprocess with given parameters. At the end, it terminates itself.\n\n### Gh0st RAT\n\n3a3b05a08180013a37fbdbe65e3fe017440c1cb34289647ef1f60316964ef6a9\n\nGh0st RAT is an old well-known backdoor, predominantly associated with East-Asian attackers. It is commonly\nassumed that its source code is widely available. Its presence is often indicated by a file named rastls.dll, using\nan export DLL name svchost.dll and containing a string Gh0st. A string uwqixgze} is used as a placeholder for\nthe C&C domain.\n\nThe version we’ve seen in this campaign tries to connect to https://yuemt.zzux[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Gh0st RAT malware\n\n## Code Similarities\n\nWhile analyzing one of the files, we noticed that it has several correlations to the Microcin sample from 2017,\nthe BYEBY sample from 2017, and Vicious Panda: The COVID campaign from 2020. Figure 5 below provides\na comparison of the decryption loop used to decrypt the main configuration data of the first backdoor.\n\nFigure 5: Part of code used to decipher the main configuration data\n\nName of file SHA256\n\nirmon.dll 170008187EBCEF183E792513608B82572FAF0AAEB33212BFA44736439453218F\n\ncryptbase.dll 383A2D8F421AD2F243CBC142E9715C78F867A114B037626C2097CB3E070F67D6\n\nNWCWorkstation.dll 2A42F500D019A64970E1C63D48EEFA27727F80FE0A5B13625E0E72A6EC98B968\n\nnwsapagent.dll 92315CDCDD3ECDAFBAC1D46EF872AAA333E1EA159D662CB61C4FA029D3896DF7\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nAvast reported its findings to the local CERT team and reached out to the telecommunications company. We\nhave not heard back from either organization.\n\nAvast has recently protected users in Central Asia from further attacks using the samples we analyzed. This,\nalong with tying elements of the samples we discovered back to attacks carried out on other countries, makes\nme assume the group is still active.\n\nI would like to thank Peter Kalnai from ESET for working with me on the analysis, Lukáš Obrdlík, and Adolf\nStředa from Avast for helping me with this research, as well as Alexey Shulmin from Kaspersky for his support.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)\n\n[Repository: https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/Microcin](https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/Microcin)\nList of SHA-256: [https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/Microcin/samples.sha256](https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/Microcin/samples.sha256)\n\n## References\n\nVasily Berdnikov, Dmitry Karasovsky, Alexey Shulmin: “Microcin malware”, Kaspersky Labs 2017-9-25\nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wpcontent/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07170759/Microcin_Technical_4PDF_eng_final_s.pdf\n\n[Josh Grunzweig, Robert Falcone: “Threat Actors Target Government of Belarus Using CMSTAR Trojan”, Palo](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threat-actors-target-government-belarus-using-cmstar-trojan/)\nAlto Networks, September 2017, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threat-actors-target-governmentbelarus-using-cmstar-trojan/\n\nCheckpoint Research: “Vicious Panda: The COVID Campaign”, 2020-03-12\n[https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\n\n[Avast Threat Intelligence https://github.com/avast/ioc](https://github.com/avast/ioc)\n\n[ESET Threat Intelligence https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc)\n\nDhia Mahjoub, Jeremiah O’Connor, Thibault Reuille, Thomas Mathew: “Phishing, Spiking, and Bad Hosting”,\nCisco Umbrella Blog, 2015-09-14\n\n[https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting/](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting/)\n\n[https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n\n[Tagged asAPT,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/apt/) [backdoor,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/backdoor/) [Central Asia](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/central-asia/)\n\n\n-----",
