They allow\nattackers to gain capabilities that are not easy to achieve otherwise. Whether attackers strive\nto gain higher privileges on a given computer, or laterally move inside a network, exploits\noften play a key role in their plan. While in-the-wild exploits are used by many malware\nfamilies, the malware authors get most of the attention, and the exploit developers remain\nout of the spotlight.\n\nAs part of our effort to focus on the exploit developers themselves, we previously shared our\nmethodology and technique of fingerprinting and tracking exploit developers. In our earlier\npublication, we thoroughly explained our methodology and focused on Volodya, a prominent\nexploit developer we tracked using the unique fingerprints left in their exploits. Now our focus\nis on another exploit developer known as PlayBit or luxor2008.\n\n## Initial Sample – CVE-2018-8453\n\n\n-----\n\nAs our research technique of fingerprinting exploit writers exceeded our initial expectations,\nwe were on the lookout for more exploits to investigate. Soon enough, we came across this\nblog post from Kaspersky detailing how Sodin (a.k.a Sodinokibi, or REvil), an infamous\nransomware, is using a 1-Day exploit for CVE-2018-8453.\n\n[CVE-2018-8453 is an interesting case, as it was formerly caught in the wild by Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/cve-2018-8453-used-in-targeted-attacks/88151/)\nwhen used by FruityArmor. From their report, it was clear that this exploit was reimplemented\nby another actor. While we would prefer to investigate an exploit developed by the actor\nbehind the 0-Day exploit, we had to settle for the exploit used in REvil.\n\nEven from this one sample, it was clear that this new actor uses a totally different exploit\ntemplate than the one used by Volodya. Luckily for us, the actor chose to implement new\nfeatures that weren’t in Volodya’s exploit template, which gave us a wider choice of artifacts\nto hunt for. After we created a few hunting rules, we set out to pursue our quarry.\n\n## Our actor’s exploits\n\nAll of the exploits that we found related to this actor were 1-Day exploits for Local Privilege\nEscalation (LPE) vulnerabilities in Windows. This list of 5 different CVEs that were exploited\neventually led us to our actor’s identity: PlayBit (a.k.a luxor2008). A full profile of the actor\ncan be found later on in this blog post, under the “Intelligence Report” section.\n\n### CVE-2013-3660\n\n**Classification: 1-Day**\n\n**Basic Description: Uninitialized kernel pointer in** `EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec`\n\n**Used by the following malware families: Dyre, Ramnit**\n\n**Background on this vulnerability:**\n\n[This vulnerability was originally found by Google’s Tavis Ormandy, and made](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/91) [headlines due](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358400/google-engineer-bashes-microsoft-discloses-windows-flaw)\nto an unusual disclosure process as Microsoft was not notified about the vulnerability before\nthe full disclosure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Decompiled code showing PlayBit s exploit banner, as seen in IDA Pro.**\n\n### CVE-2015-0057\n\n**Classification: 1-Day**\n\n**Basic Description: Use-After-Free in** `win32k!xxxEnableWndSBArrows`\n\n**Used by the following malware families: Dyre, Evotob**\n\n**Background on this vulnerability:**\n\nAlso known as MS15-010, this vulnerability was found by Udi Yavo, the CTO of enSilo. The\n[public disclosure of the vulnerability included a technical explanation of the vulnerability as](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211120820/http:/breakingmalware.com/vulnerabilities/one-bit-rule-bypassing-windows-10-protections-using-single-bit/)\nwell as the exploitation plan. In addition, the authors specifically mentioned they were able to\nexploit this vulnerability on all Windows versions, and even supplied a demo video.\n\nEven though the disclosure didn’t share any exploit code, it was enough to draw our actor’s\nattention. Three months after the patch, PlayBit already had a working exploit, and a month\n[later this exploit was used by the Dyre Banking Trojan. The exceptional case behind this](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/07/dyre_banking_trojan.html#:~:text=New%20variants%20of%20the%20Dyre,CVE%2D2015%2D0057).&text=CVE%2D2015%2D0057%20is%20a,to%20perform%20local%20privilege%20escalation.)\nvulnerability is described in more detail in FireEye’s Black Hat [presentation on CVE-2015-](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Wang-A-New-CVE-2015-0057-Exploit-Technology-wp.pdf)\n0057.\n\n### CVE-2015-1701\n\n**Classification: 1-Day**\n\n**Basic Description:** `CreateWindow callback validation error`\n\n**Used by the following malware families: Locky**\n\n**Background on this vulnerability:**\n\nAlso known as MS15-051, this vulnerability was originally exploited as a 0-Day in an\n[operation attributed to APT28.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/04/probable_apt28_useo.html)\n\n### CVE-2016-7255\n\n**Classification: 1-Day**\n\n**Basic Description: Memory corruption in** `NtUserSetWindowLongPtr`\n\n**Used by the following malware families: LockCrypt**\n\n**Background on this vulnerability:**\n\n[Originally exploited as a 0-Day, once again attributed to APT28. This 0-Day was found and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/16/l/one-bit-rule-system-analyzing-cve-2016-7255-exploit-wild.html)\nexploited by Volodya, later to be exploited again and sold by PlayBit.\n\n### CVE-2018-8453\n\n**Classification: 1-Day**\n\n**Basic Description: Use-after-free in** `win32kfull!xxxDestroyWindow`\n\n**Used by the following malware families: REvil (Sodinokibi), Maze, Neshta**\n\n**Background on this vulnerability:**\n\nOriginally exploited as a 0-Day, and [attributed to FruityArmor.](https://securelist.com/cve-2018-8453-used-in-targeted-attacks/88151/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs [bitdefender reported, Maze ransomware uses two different LPE exploits: CVE-2016-](https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/News/CaseStudies/study/318/Bitdefender-TRR-Whitepaper-Maze-creat4351-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf)\n7255, and CVE-2018-8453. What’s interesting is that they use Volodya’s exploit for CVE2016-7255 (like GandCrab, and many other malware families), while transitioning to using\nPlayBit’s exploit for CVE-2018-8453. Not only do we see both Volodya and PlayBit selling\ntheir exploits to the same malware actor, we can take this opportunity to learn about the\ndynamics involved. While PlayBit sells their own exploit for CVE-2016-7255, Maze chose to\nuse Volodya’s exploit even though they also purchased an exploit from PlayBit (CVE-20188453).\n\nIt seems a bit unusual that when purchasing their LPE exploits, the actors behind Maze\ndecided to buy from two different sellers, especially as PlayBit sells both of these exploits.\nHowever, an important fact to remember is that Maze ransomware was first discovered in\n2019. Therefore, our theory is that at least in some campaigns, the operators behind Maze\nsimply “inherited” the first exploit, later purchasing another one to target more victims.\n\n## Mindset of a 1-Day exploit seller\n\nWhen going over the list of CVEs that were exploited by PlayBit, we found a unique pattern\nthat they all share: All of the vulnerabilities were already “famous” before PlayBit decided to\nimplement an exploit for them.\n\n**CVE-2013-3660 – Made headlines due to an unusual disclosure process.**\n**CVE-2015-0057 – The public disclosure of the vulnerability included a detailed**\nexplanation of the vulnerability and the exploitation plan, and to this day is still highly\nregarded as a novel exploitation technique.\n**CVE-2015-1701 – Originally exploited as a 0-Day.**\n**CVE-2016-7255 – Originally exploited as a 0-Day.**\n**CVE-2018-8453 – Originally exploited as a 0-Day.**\n\nAs we can see, all of the CVEs that our actor chose to exploit as 1-Days were already well\nknown. While we didn’t find a similar tactic for Volodya when choosing which 1-Day\nvulnerabilities to exploit, it does seem that this helped PlayBit advertise their exploits in\nunderground forums.\n\nOne more characteristic that we found in all of PlayBit’s exploits that were lacking in\nVolodya’s, is the exploitability check. PlayBit supplies the customer with a thin wrapper\naround the exploit, which checks whether the target computer is indeed vulnerable. Although\nthe check varies a bit between different exploits and versions, the basics are the same: the\nmodification date of the vulnerable win32k driver is checked, to detect if a patch was\ninstalled.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Checking if** `win32k.sys was modified after February 10, 2015 (CVE-2015-0057).`\nScreenshot from Cutter.\n\nThis operational decision was very useful from our perspective, as the exploit effectively tells\nus in which Patch Tuesday the exploited vulnerability was fixed:\n\n**CVE-2013-3660 – The first sample of this exploit didn’t yet contain such a check.**\n**CVE-2015-0057 –** `win32k.sys checked for a modification date of February 10, 2015.`\n**CVE-2015-1701 –** `win32k.sys checked for a modification date of May 13, 2015.`\n**CVE-2016-7255 –** `win32k.sys checked for a modification date of November 8, 2016.`\n**CVE-2018-8453 –** `win32k.sys /` `win32kfull.sys are checked for a modification`\ndate of September 11, 2018.\n\n## The author’s fingerprints\n\nNow that we found 5 different exploits from PlayBit, we can review them in greater detail and\nfamiliarize ourselves with the actor’s work habits. As was the case with Volodya, it was clear\nto us from the beginning that PlayBit probably has a simple template to deploy for the\ndifferent exploits.\n\nAs some of the actor’s characteristics were already used in the previous comparison to\nVolodya, we chose to focus instead on other implementation decisions, some of which aren’t\neven included in Volodya’s exploits.\n\n### Hash-Based Imports\n\nIn every exploit, PlayBit picks a handful of important functions and obfuscates their use.\nInstead of just importing these functions in the PE level, or using their cleartext strings and\nimporting them using `GetProcAddress(), PlayBit devised their own import technique.`\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Loading the addresses of** `Ps* symbols based on their hash/CRC.`\n\nHere is a short Python snippet that performs this “hash” calculation (more like a checksum /\nCRC):\n```\nfrom malduck import ror\ndef calc_hash(export_str):\n  crc_value = 0\n  for c in export_str:\n    cur_value = ord(c)\n    # convert lower case back to upper case\n    if cur_value >= ord('a'):\n      cur_value -= 0x20 # 'a' - 'A' = 0x20\n    crc_value = ror(crc_value, 13) + cur_value\n  return crc_value\n\n```\nNot only is this hash-based import technique used in all of the actor’s exploits, we were also\nable to find it in other tools they sold over the years, going back to 2012.\n\nWhen examining the functions imported using this mechanism, we found out they all have a\ncommon trait. All of these functions are used by the “shellcode”, the exploitation part that is\nexecuted with high privileges and is responsible for elevating the permissions of the target\n\n\n-----\n\nprocess. This also means that it is relatively easy to locate the shellcode in each of the\nexploits, as it references the global variables that store the addresses of the specially\nimported functions.\n\n### OS Fingerprinting\n\nLike any other experienced exploit developer attempting to target as many OS versions as\npossible, our actor needs to fingerprint the exact version of the immediate target. This means\nthat the exploit identifies and calibrates itself to the target’s Windows version. In contrast to\nVolodya, it seems that PlayBit is interested in everything they can learn about the target:\n\nOS major number\nOS minor number\nService pack\nServer or a standalone computer\nWindows 10 build number\n\n**Figure 4: Querying for the exact OS version, as can be seen in Cutter.**\n\n**GetVersionEx()**\n\nWhile this API call is used in all of the exploits, it was used exclusively only in the exploit of\n[CVE-2013-3660. As this API became deprecated, the exploits from 2015 and later only use it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getversionexa)\nwhen querying for the service pack and the OS type. Both the major number and minor\nnumber of the Windows OS are now queried using a different technique.\n\n**Accessing the PEB**\n\n\n-----\n\nSwitching from the now deprecated `GetVersionEx(), PlayBit chose to query the Process-`\nEnvironment-Block (PEB).\n\n**Figure 5: Extracting the major and minor versions from the PEB, as can be seen in Cutter.**\n\nThis is a clear difference in the modus operandi of PlayBit as compared to Volodya. Not only\ndo they extract the same information in different ways, but Volodya is also interested in far\nless information than PlayBit, even when they both exploit the same vulnerability (CVE-20167255).\n\nIn general, both actors hold detailed version-specific configurations from which they load the\nrelevant information once the OS version is determined. The main difference between the\ntwo is that the code flow in Volodya’s exploits rarely depends on the OS version, while\nPlayBit incorporates multiple twists and turns using various if-checks that depend on the OS\nversion.\n\n### Leaking Kernel Addresses\n\nIn contrast to what we initially thought, a closer examination of PlayBit’s exploits showed that\nthey do indeed contain a kernel-pointer-leak primitive. Not only do the exploits contain such a\nleak, the chosen leak primitive hints at a high level of understanding of the internals of\nWindows. PlayBit directly accesses the Desktop Heap stored in user-mode, via the\n```\nWin32ClientInfo field stored in the Thread-Environment-Block (TEB).\n\n```\n**Figure 6: Extracting information on the Desktop Heap, using TEB’s** `Win32ClientInfo.`\n\n\n-----\n\nAs Microsoft gradually fixed the design issue that allowed for this pointer-leak, PlayBit had to\nimplement some updates along the way to allow this technique to continue to work. For\ninstance, Creators Update removed the `ulClientDelta field from` `Win32ClientInfo,`\nmandating that the exploit for CVE-2018-8453 calculate it manually. This technique was\nfinally patched by Microsoft in Windows 10 RS4.\n\nThe leak primitive enables PlayBit to learn the kernel addresses of the windows created\nduring the exploitation. In turn, this information is used in several phases during the\nexploitation:\n\nThe addresses are used for pointing to / creating fake kernel objects.\nThe kernel memory shaping is measured by the distance between the leaked\naddresses.\nThe exploits usually invoke a kernel shellcode, and we need to know where it is stored.\n\nThe last point is explained in more detail in the next section.\n\n## SMEP Bypass\n\n### Generation 0 – No Bypass\n\nIn the initial versions of the earlier exploits, such as the exploit for CVE-2013-3660 and some\nversions of CVE-2015-0057, the exploit caused the kernel to execute a token-swapping\nshellcode stored in user-mode.\n\n**Figure 7: PlayBit exploit scanning the** `EPROCESS in search for the token, as can be seen in`\nCutter.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downside of this form of privilege-elevation is that SMEP prohibits the kernel from\nexecuting code that is stored in user-mode. Instead of changing the way the token-swap is\nperformed, PlayBit decided to add an additional layer that turns off SMEP. This way, the\nproblem is reduced to the same token-swap problem that earlier exploits already solved. A\nclassic academic solution.\n\n### Generation 1 – Kernel shellcode\n\nIn this set of exploits, an additional kernel shellcode was added. This bootloader code is\ncopied to kernel-space and stored as the “window name” of one of the windows corrupted by\nthe exploit. Upon execution, the code modifies CR4 to disable the SMEP support, and then\njumps back to the original user-mode payload.\n\n**Figure 8: Checking for kernel-mode, and masking out the SMEP-related bit out of CR4.**\n\nThe exploit copies the payload to the kernel using the `NtUserDefSetText syscall, which`\nexplains why this syscall is included in the per-version configuration of all of the relevant\nexploits.\n\nNote that this SMEP bypass is based on the fact that the above code snippet can be\nexecuted, in kernel-mode, even though it should have been a window name. The fact that\nmemory pools were flagged as “executable” (or more specifically, weren’t flagged as “nonexecutable”), was used by many attackers. Eventually, Microsoft noticed this design flaw in\nthe kernel’s memory and introduced Non-eXecutable (NX) pools to the kernel.\n\nOnce again, PlayBit decided to overcome this added restriction using yet another reduction,\nimplemented in the exploit for CVE-2018-8453.\n\n### Generation 2 – Disabling the NX bit from the kernel shellcode\n\nThis additional change was more complicated than the previous one, as it also demanded\nthe use of Arbitrary-Read and Arbitrary-Write kernel primitives. While the use of these\nprimitives allows for a cleaner exploit to begin with, as Volodya was doing since 2015,\nPlayBit only added it as an additional step in the reduction to the basic user-mode tokenswap payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring this step, the page table entries are traversed in search of the entry associated with\nthe kernel shellcode. Once found, the entry is masked-out of the XD (eXecute Disable) bit,\nand stored back in the table. From this point on, the memory page containing the kernel\nshellcode is executable, and thus the privilege-escalation chain can start.\n\n**Figure 9: Traversing the Page Table and removing the XD bit from the record of the kernel**\nshellcode.\n\n## An exploit framework\n\nAfter finding enough samples that adhere to PlayBit’s exploit template for Windows memory\ncorruption LPEs, we decided to perform one more check. Using exploit-specific artifacts from\neach of the exploits, we created an additional set of hunting rules and did one more search.\n\nIn this additional search, we found Ramnit samples which contain an exploit for CVE-20133660, but with some changes:\n\nWhen checking if the target is vulnerable or patched, instead of looking for the driver’s\nmodification date, the exploit searches for a specific patch id in the registry, as can be\nseen in Figure 10 below.\nPlayBit’s hash-based imported functions are no longer used; `GetProcAddress() is`\nused instead.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: A check for KB2850851 before exploiting CVE-2013-3660.**\n\nOur Ramnit sample exploits both CVE-2013-3660 (by PlayBit) and CVE-2014-4113 (using\nthe [same exploit code originally found as a 0-Day). The original exploit for CVE-2014-4113](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/two-targeted-attacks-two-new-zero-days.html)\nwas part of an exploit framework in which the API passes a command-line argument, and\nthat command is executed as SYSTEM. As that wasn’t the original API for PlayBit’s exploit,\nsome adjustments were made and PlayBit’s exploits were re-adjusted to receive a\ncommand-line argument to be executed once elevated.\n\n\n-----\n\n[When further investigating this new framework, we saw that it matched FireEye s report on](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/07/dyre_banking_trojan.html)\nthe Dyre Banking Trojan. As Dyre exploited CVE-2013-3660 and CVE-2015-0057, both of\nwhich were written by PlayBit, this means that during the lifetime of this exploit framework, it\nincluded at least the following 3 exploits:\n\nCVE-2013-3660 – PlayBit.\nCVE-2014-4113 – 1-Day use of the original 0-Day exploit. Unknown author.\nCVE-2015-0057 – PlayBit.\n\nAside from connecting PlayBit to this now defunct exploit framework, we can deduce\nadditional conclusions regarding our exploit-based hunting technique:\n\nOur hunting is mainly based on an actor’s given exploit template.\nWhen working with other associates, and collaborating on a given exploitation\nframework, this template is replaced with the agreed-upon design modifications.\nGiven an initial exploitation framework sample, it is easier to find similar frameworkrelated samples, than it is to find independent exploits of one of the authors who\ncontributed to this framework.\n\nEssentially, both the attribution and the hunting are more complicated as the exploit\nframework masks many telltale-signs of the individual exploit developer.\n\n## Intelligence Report\n\nIn contrast to the previous blog post on Volodya, we decided this time to perform an\nadditional “Background Check” on PlayBit. Being unfamiliar with this actor, we thought it\nwould be a good chance to better understand how they work. In addition, we could test how\nwell our exploit-based hunting technique works by comparing the found list of advertisements\nto the actual samples we caught.\n\n### PlayBit (a.k.a luxor2008)\n\nFunnily enough, attributing the exploits to our exploit writer was quite simple. It turns out that\nalongside the use of numerous underground forums, there are also public YouTube channels\nadvertising the actor’s exploits.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: A screenshot from one of PlayBit’s YouTube channels.**\n\nFor some unknown reason, there are actually two YouTube channels: one for earlier exploits,\nand another one (still active) for more recent exploits. As the videos publicly state which CVE\nis being exploited, the attribution process was very short.\n\n[When trying to learn more about this actor, we only found a single slim report. Therefore, we](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/zero-day-vulnerabilities-an-inside-look-at-luxor2008/)\ndecided to include a detailed profile of the actor in this blog post.\n\n### The Actor’s Advertisements\n\nAside from the YouTube channels we mentioned earlier, the actor used multiple platforms to\nadvertise the vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12: Forum advertisement for CVE-2019-1069.**\n\nWhether the ads were placed on underground forums, YouTube, or even Pastebin, they all\nshared a common template:\n\n“\n\n_Ring0 LPE Exploit CVE-2015-0057 [All win versions]_\n\n_Vulnerability: CVE-2015-0057 (Published: February 10, 2015)_\n\n_Supported versions: XP/2003/Vista/2008/W7/W8/2012/W8.1/2012R2/W10TP_\n\n_Supported architecture: x86/x64_\n\n_Development stage: v1.1.1900 (stable)_\n\n_Shellcode size x86: 13Kb_\n\n_Shellcode size x64: 16Kb_\n\n_Bypass all possible Windows security defences:_\n\n_SMEP_\n_Kernel DEP_\n_KASLR_\n_Integrity Level (escape from Low)_\n_NULL Dereference Protection_\n_UAC_\n\n_There are no public POCs on this vulnerability.

The wide\nrange of supported Windows versions is also evident: If a given Windows version is\nvulnerable to the exploited vulnerability, you can be sure that PlayBit’s exploit supports it.\n\n### Years of activity\n\nWe successfully traced PlayBit to various exploits and tools going as far back as 2012. On\naverage, the actor sells a single Windows LPE 1-Day exploit per year, and that includes\n[recent exploits for both CVE-2019-1069 (a SandboxEscaper vulnerability) and CVE-2020-](https://twitter.com/sandboxbear?lang=en)\n0787 (yet another logical vulnerability).\n\n### Transition to exploit logical vulnerabilities\n\nWhile we caught samples of 5 memory-corruption Windows LPE vulnerabilities, the ads\nshow that in the last year or so the actor shifted their interest. Both of the recently sold\nexploits are now more logical in nature, and may indicate a trend in the exploitation market.\nKnowing that PlayBit’s previous exploits relied on a design flaw that was fixed by Microsoft in\nWindows 10 RS 4 (released on April 30, 2018), it could be that Microsoft’s mitigations are\none reason behind this shift in focus.\n\n### Pricing\n\nAs [previously reported by Kaspersky, Volodya sold 0-Day exploits at prices ranging from](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mysterious-hacker-has-been-selling-windows-0-days-to-apt-groups-for-three-years/)\n$85,000 (exploit from 2016) up to $200,000. While we don’t know what the selling price was\nfor 1-Day exploits, we expected prices roughly in the same neighborhood. However, when\ngoing over the different ads published by PlayBit, we saw a wide pricing gap when compared\nto Volodya.\n\nAll Windows LPE exploits were advertised with a price tag ranging between $5,000 and\n$10,000. We even found the actor using a fake nickname and claiming to sell a 0-Day\nexploit, which was in fact the 1-Day exploit for CVE-2016-7255. The asking price for this “0Day” was still $35,000, way below the $85,000 for which Volodya sold the real 0-Day exploit\nof the same vulnerability. In addition, we couldn’t find any pricing trend for the different\nexploits, as all pretty much sold for the same price from 2015 to 2020.\n\n## Intelligence Report Wrap-up\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough not intuitive at first, the fact that we didn t see ads for other CVEs (of the same\nexploitation template) is actually good news. It means that our technique worked better than\nexpected: A fully technical hunt for PlayBit’s exploits, without any intelligence, still managed\nto cover all of their exploits that originated from the exploit template with which we initially\nstarted.\n\nAside from Windows LPEs, we found two more interesting tools that PlayBit is\ndeveloping/collaborating with.\n\n### Avatar Rootkit\n\n[ESET mentioned this in 2013.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/05/01/mysterious-avatar-rootkit-with-api-sdk-and-yahoo-groups-for-cc-communication/)\nUses the same hash-based imports that is still a feature of PlayBit today:\n```\n   get_module_by_hash() / get_func_by_hash() .\n\n```\nThis [Pastebin ad specifically mentions PlayBit as an associate.](https://pastebin.com/maPY7SS8)\n\n### EternalBlack\n\n[Self-implemented EternalRomance](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/?source=mmpc)\nAgain, uses features seen in all of the rest of the samples.\n\n**Figure 13: Message printed when executing EternalBlack, developed by PlayBit.**\n\n## The Customers\n\nThe “customers” i.e. malware who use PlayBit’s exploit, either directly or by using an exploit\nframework, are all crimeware. Most prominent are the popular ransomware that use PlayBit’s\nexploits to escalate their privileges before encrypting the victim’s disk. These ransomware\ninclude Maze, Locky, LockCrypt, and REvil (Sodin, Sodinokibi). Other malware are popular\nTrojans like Ramnit and Dyre.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this article, we demonstrated another case in which we were able to fingerprint an exploit\ndeveloper, without prior knowledge about the developer or any public profiles. All we started\n[with was a single sample. We showed how PlayBit, similar to Volodya, has a unique set of](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/graphology-of-an-exploit-volodya/)\nchoices, approaches, methodologies and combinations of implementation decisions. By\ngathering all the pieces, we managed to understand and profile PlayBit, as well as attribute\nsamples to the actor. We also took the opportunity to compare PlayBit to Volodya, and\nhighlight the differences between their coding styles and preferences.\n\nAside from the technical aspects, this is the first time that PlayBit has been thoroughly\ndescribed by researchers. We took a look at the exploit market, the advertisements, YouTube\nchannels and collaborations between exploit developers and malware authors. Developing\nan exploit is just the beginning. The next step is to monetize the “product” and sell the\ncustomers a high-quality piece of software that is relatively stable and supports as many\nversions as possible.\n\nFollowing our success with profiling both PlayBit and Volodya, we believe that our research\nmethodology can be used to identify additional exploit writers as well. We therefore\nrecommend that other researchers try our approach and add it to their toolbox.\n\n## Recommendation for Protection\n\nCheck Point [Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat:](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/threat-emulation-sandboxing/)\n\nWins.Generic.G\n\n## Appendix – IOC Table\n\n**CVE-2013-3660:**\n```\n9f1a235eb38291cef296829be4b4d03618cd21e0b4f343f75a460c31a0ad62d3\n\n```\n**CVE-2015-0057:**\n```\n1b3524fd57e4e836778d4af4579b6d986e7475ee6a1a7818ead0fc59efbdc2ac\n\n```\n**CVE-2015-1701 (Also contains an exploit for CVE-2015-0057):**\n```\n8869e0df9b5f4a894216c76aa5689686395c16296761716abece00a0b4234d87\n\n```\n**CVE-2016-7255:**\n```\n5c27e05b788ba3b997a70df674d410322c3fa5e97079a7bf3aec369a0d397164\n\n```\n**CVE-2018-8453:**\n```\n50da0183466a9852590de0d9e58bbe64f22ff8fc20a9ccc68ed0e50b367d7043\n\n```\n**Avatar Rootkit:**\n```\nd1a8d74aadb10bff4bfda144e68db3e087ec4fee82cd22df22839fd5435d0d37\n\n```\n**EternalBlack:**\n\n```\neffa8e38838ba7d2c58b2731c086ac72d639f9d2ab8184bc8cf05d72c5444dd1\n\n```\n\n-----",
