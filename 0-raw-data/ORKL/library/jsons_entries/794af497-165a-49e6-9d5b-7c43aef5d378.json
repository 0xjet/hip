    "plain_text": "**September 12, 2017 | by Genwei Jiang, Ben Read, James T. Bennett | Threat Research**\n\n**[FireEye recently detected a malicious Microsoft Office RTF document that leveraged CVE-2017-8759, a](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8759)**\n\n**[SOAP WSDL parser code injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996486.aspx)**\n**code during the parsing of SOAP WSDL definition contents. FireEye analyzed a Microsoft Word document**\n\n**where attackers used the arbitrary code injection to download and execute a Visual Basic script that**\n\n**contained PowerShell commands.**\n\n**FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and has been coordinating public disclosure**\n\n**[timed with the release of a patch to address the vulnerability and security guidance, which can be found here.](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8759)**\n\n**FireEye email, endpoint and network products detected the malicious documents.**\n\n**The malicious document, “Проект.doc” (MD5: fe5c4d6bb78e170abf5cf3741868ea4c), might have been used**\n\n**to target a Russian speaker. Upon successful exploitation of CVE-2017-8759, the document downloads**\n\n**multiple components (details follow), and eventually launches a FINSPY payload (MD5:**\n\n**a7b990d5f57b244dd17e9a937a41e7f5).**\n\n**FINSPY malware, also reported as FinFisher or** **[WingBird, is available for purchase as part of a “lawful](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/B/0/EB0F50CC-989C-4B66-B7F6-68CD3DC90DE3/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_21_English.pdf)**\n\n**[intercept” capability. Based on this and previous use of FINSPY, we assess with moderate confidence that](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199_useda.html)**\n\n**this malicious document was used by a nation-state to target a Russian-speaking entity for cyber espionage**\n\n**purposes. Additional detections by FireEye’s Dynamic Threat Intelligence system indicates that related**\n**activity, though potentially for a different client, might have occurred as early as July 2017.**\n\n**A code injection vulnerability exists in the WSDL parser module within the PrintClientProxy method**\n\n**[(http://referencesource.microsoft.com/ - System.Runtime.Remoting/metadata/wsdlparser.cs,6111). The](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Runtime.Remoting/metadata/wsdlparser.cs,6111)**\n**IsValidUrl does not perform correct validation if provided data that contains a CRLF sequence. This allows an**\n**attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code. A portion of the vulnerable code is shown in Figure 1.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Vulnerable WSDL Parser**\n\n**When multiple address definitions are provided in a SOAP response, the code inserts the**\n\n**“//base.ConfigureProxy(this.GetType(),” string after the first address, commenting out the remaining**\n\n**addresses. However, if a CRLF sequence is in the additional addresses, the code following the CRLF will not**\n**be commented out. Figure 2 shows that due to lack validation of CRLF, a System.Diagnostics.Process.Start**\n\n**method call is injected. The generated code will be compiled by csc.exe of .NET framework, and loaded by**\n**the Office executables as a DLL.**\n\n**Figure 2: SOAP definition VS Generated code**\n\n**The attacks that FireEye observed in the wild leveraged a Rich Text Format (RTF) document, similar to the**\n**[CVE-2017-0199 documents we previously reported on. The malicious sampled contained an embedded](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler.html)**\n\n**SOAP monikers to facilitate exploitation (Figure 3).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: SOAP Moniker**\n\n**The payload retrieves the malicious SOAP WSDL definition from an attacker-controlled server. The WSDL**\n**parser, implemented in System.Runtime.Remoting.ni.dll of .NET framework, parses the content and**\n\n**generates a .cs source code at the working directory. The csc.exe of .NET framework then compiles the**\n\n**generated source code into a library, namely http[url path].dll. Microsoft Office then loads the library,**\n**completing the exploitation stage. Figure 4 shows an example library loaded as a result of exploitation.**\n\n**Figure 4: DLL loaded**\n\n**Upon successful exploitation, the injected code creates a new process and leverages mshta.exe to retrieve a**\n**HTA script named “word.db” from the same server. The HTA script removes the source code, compiled DLL**\n\n**and the PDB files from disk and then downloads and executes the FINSPY malware named “left.jpg,” which in**\n**spite of the .jpg extension and “image/jpeg” content-type, is actually an executable. Figure 5 shows the details**\n**of the PCAP of this malware transfer.**\n\n**Figure 5: Live requests**\n\n**The malware will be placed at %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OfficeUpdte-KB[ 6 random numbers ].exe.**\n\n**Figure 6 shows the process create chain under Process Monitor.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Process Created Chain**\n\n**The “left.jpg” (md5: a7b990d5f57b244dd17e9a937a41e7f5) is a variant of FINSPY. It leverages heavily**\n**obfuscated code that employs a built-in virtual machine – among other anti-analysis techniques – to make**\n**reversing more difficult. As likely another unique anti-analysis technique, it parses its own full path and**\n\n**searches for the string representation of its own MD5 hash. Many resources, such as analysis tools and**\n**sandboxes, rename files/samples to their MD5 hash in order to ensure unique filenames. This variant runs**\n**with a mutex of \"WininetStartupMutex0\".**\n\n**CVE-2017-8759 is the second zero-day vulnerability used to distribute FINSPY uncovered by FireEye in**\n**2017. These exposures demonstrate the significant resources available to “lawful intercept” companies and**\n\n**their customers. Furthermore, FINSPY has been sold to multiple clients, suggesting the vulnerability was**\n**being used against other targets.**\n\n**It is possible that CVE-2017-8759 was being used by additional actors. While we have not found evidence of**\n**this, the zero day being used to distribute FINSPY in April 2017, CVE-2017-0199 was simultaneously being**\n\n**used by a financially motivated actor. If the actors behind FINSPY obtained this vulnerability from the same**\n**source used previously, it is possible that source sold it to additional actors.**\n\n**Thank you to Dhanesh Kizhakkinan, Joseph Reyes, FireEye Labs Team, FireEye FLARE Team and FireEye**\n**iSIGHT Intelligence for their contributions to this blog.
