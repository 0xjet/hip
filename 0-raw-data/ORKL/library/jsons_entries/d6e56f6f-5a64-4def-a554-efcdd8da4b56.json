In fact, hackers and their cybercrime\nenterprises exist in the same world as ours and undergo the same social and economic\ntransformations as those which shape our reality.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen cybercrime emerged, it followed the rules of the late industrial age. Despite their Fin\nde siècle fleur of harbingers of the radically novel era, cybercriminal communities relied on\nstandard, if not mundane operational rules of classic enterprises — separation of functions,\ndivision of labor, focused specialization. In other words, underground malware engineers\nwho developed information stealers most likely never had a chance or intent to talk to\nhackers who developed ransomware; hacktivists did not collaborate with cyber fraudsters or\ncarders, while for-profit criminals and nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT)\noperatives preferred to maintain a clear separation line.\n\nEverything changed with time. Unlike its predecessor which valued separation and\noperational boundaries, the 21st century manifested the interconnectivity as its essential\ntrait. Facebook, Google, Uber, all succeeded because they were able to unite the previously\n“ununitable.” This strive to merge domains and cross borders became a rule for success, a\nnatural destination of evolution. Like other humans, cybercriminals felt the zeitgeist — they\nevolved accordingly. However, only one group was able to crown this evolution — the elite\n[“TrickBot” group.](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/trickbot)\n\nThis story begins in the year in which the century clearly demonstrated its rapidly changing\nnature. 2013 — the call for radical social change shakes the Middle East and Europe alike;\nthe Pope announces his renunciation the first time in 700 years; the Voyager 1 exits the\nSolar System and reaches the interstellar medium. The transformations of cybercrime were\nno less fundamental. Banking malware — a malware designed to steal financial information\n\n\n-----\n\n— were rapidly acquiring new functions and traits consummating with the success of\nGameOver Zeus, also known as “Peer-to-Peer Zeus”, cybercrime group that became known\nas “Business Club.”\n\nThe developers of this crimeware employed an alternative approach to their botnet —\noffering it as a service for other threat actors. The GameOver Zeus service also pioneered\nthe deployment of ransomware such as a prolific “Cryptolocker” responsible in millions of\nlosses and affecting victims worldwide. Overall, GameOver Zeus was a major success in\nintroducing a profoundly new model — cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS). This model was\nbased on automation, customization, and client-oriented approach and perfectly fit the\ndemand of the expanding postindustrial private market. The Business Club model was\noperated by the most wanted cybercriminal, a Russian national Evgeniy Mihailovich\nBogachev, or simply known as “Slavik” amongst the club members fellow cybercriminals.\n\nIt was only a matter of time when other groups will incorporate GameOver Zeus’s innovative\nmodeling. In 2014, two cybercrime teams and former customers and members of “Business\nClub” form separate crimeware models became known as “Dridex” and “Dyre.” Both Dridex\nand Dyre made its way to the headlines by advancing the CaaS model and supplying various\ntypes of cybercriminals with their botnet solutions.\n\nIn the meantime, Dridex and their operators, also known as “Evil Corp,” continues to\nsuccessful experimenting with targeted highly-impactful bank fraud and ransomware\noperations including working with such targeted ransomware variants as “BitPaymer” and\n“DoppelPaymer” responsible for multiple worldwide ransomware disruptions including the\n[PEMEX intrusion. In December 2019, the Dridex botnet operators were charged and indicted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mexicos-pemex-oil-suffers-ransomware-attack-49-million-demanded/)\n[by the international law enforcement and sanctioned the leader behind Makism Yakubets,](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845)\nknown as “aqua,” and its administrator Igor Turashev, known as “nintutu,” for their\ninvolvement in another massive more than $100-million bank fraud and ransomware\noperations. Notably, Yakubetz was alleged close involvement with the Russian government\nand the FSB operations acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled means and\ncyber-enabled operations on its behalf.\n\nIn 2016, Dyre operators were alleged to be arrested in Moscow, Russia; however, their work\nand ideas accumulated in the tool — TrickBot. Trickbot engineers designed the bot in such a\nway to plug into the Dyre backend systems seamlessly while preserving independence from\nthe Dyre components.\n\n## TrickBot Race to Perfection: The Aesthetics of Blurred Lines\n\nTrickBot was developed in 2016 as a banking malware. However, since then it has\ndeveloped into something essentially different — a flexible, universal, module-based\ncrimeware solution. TrickBot has been evolved to specifically attack corporations. The three\npillars of TrickBot’s success were ironically the buzzwords of the post-industrial revolution —\nautomation, decentralization, and integration.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarly reports on TrickBot appeared in Fall 2016. By November 2016, the malware was\nalready tested and functional. TrickBot developers began to add new functions to cross the\nborders — first, literal borders. Initially targeting Australian banks, by November 2016\nTrickBot had included New Zealand, British, German, and Canadian banks into its victim list.\nIn July 2017, TrickBot was equipped with advanced automation — another crucial trait that\ncharacterized this malware. TrickBot was now capable of worm-like spreading within the\nnetwork after the initial infection.\n\nThen the expansion of functions followed. In October 2017, the crimeware group gathered\ndata from mail clients and scraped web-history in search of personal identifiers. Later, new\npassword grabber modules turned TrickBot into a fully-fledged stealing tool that was able to\nbrowse Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and other applications containing\npasswords and credentials.\n\nAs a result, by 2018, the TrickBot group was swamped by a humongous data flow from\ninfected machines. The group faced “big data” problems which required them to engineer a\ncustom solution dealing with commercial size data flows and essentially design a “data lake”\nservice to process it. The group faced a paradox in which its technological efficiency was not\nmatched by the capabilities to process and monetize the information stolen. It was this\nmoment when the organizational and strategic talent of the operators, and, possibly, the\nexperience of Dyre came to play.\n\nInstead of harvesting and storing the compromised information as raw material, TrickBot\ndecided to process and index it and offer access to it as a service. For instance, the spying\ncapability was redesigned with a new feature with which TrickBot gathered and transferred\nnetwork and domain controller victim information. With this function, TrickBot could provide\nother groups with critical security information which was then used to prioritize victims. In\nother words, a TrickBot customer knew who was the least protected prey in the lists. In other\ninstances, breaches and botnet data were indexed through the backend to track the highvalue targets. In this sense, the group weaponized these infections for the potent, targeted\nransomware, or as they called it a “cryptolocker,” which became known as “Ryuk”\nransomware affecting and crippling industries worldwide across multiple market segments,\nincluding healthcare and aviation industries. The criminal groups used specific digital\nidentifiers obtained via TrickBot to spot the most lucrative industry targets for their\nransomware campaigns.\n\nMoreover, the group decentralized if not “Uberized” its operations and started to massively\nsublet its technical solutions to affiliate groups. TrickBot products have often used a\ncombination with other malware including highly infective Emotet, IcedID/BokBot, and Gozi\nISFB v2.\n\nThe flexibility was achieved through active use of modules. The modular structure allowed\nTrickBot to efficiently operate in different environments which were previously separated.\nTrickBot and its modules acted in the following major ways:\n\n\n-----\n\na perfect information stealer grabbing personal information, which was then sold on the\nunderground and used privately,\na banker, stealing corporate data which monetized through account takeover and card\nfraud\na distributor, delivering ransomware, and\na cryptominer.\n\nBy 2019, Automation, Decentralization, and Integration enabled TrickBot to introduce a\ngame-changing model. Their domain controller harvester enabled automatic network\ninformation collection and automated lateral movement within networks, not even mentioning\nthe completely automated process of credential harvesting. The ability to integrate different\ncybercrime segments allowed to perform sophisticated bank fraud operations for money\nlaundering, engage in ransomware and tax fraud. Decentralization created a flexible\nbusiness model, where TrickBot offered attack tools to vetted vendors and used the tools of\nothers to increase the infectivity.\n\nIn blurring the lines between breaches, data theft, ransomware, and cyber fraud, the group\nhas almost reached the pinnacle, and almost united the cybercrime territories. However,\nthere was one final challenge separating TrickBot from perfection — the APTs.\n\n## The “Anchor” Mystery\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threat is a type of cybercrime which is most often associated with the\nnation-state actors. While the attribution is often a subject of political accusations and social\ndiscussion, the APT groups are indeed extremely sophisticated and are characterized by an\nultimate focus on espionage. This defines the persistence in their operations — to\naccomplish their mission targets, APT teams need to secretly remain in the system, navigate\nand observe. APTs saw their heyday in 2016 and 2017 when professional intrusion teams\nperformed massive operations against top-banks and attacks against the SWIFT payment\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe modus operandi of APT has targeted attacks on extremely secure networks, remaining\npersistent and undetected for long periods, and espionage separates them from crimeware\nand TrickBot which are generally are deployed merely for monetary gain. This is why it was\nhighly unlikely that TrickBot would attempt to integrate APTs into their operations. Until a new\nTrickBot derivative project called “Anchor” was discovered.\n\nWhile investigating the Anchor project we observed a framework of tools that allows the\nactors — potential TrickBot customers — to leverage this framework against higher-profile\nvictims. Some of the pieces we have found for this framework can be seen below in the form\nof PDB paths. Anchor consists of several segments each with a specific function:\n\nanchorInstaller\nanchorDeInstaller\nAnchorBot\nBin2hex\npsExecutor\nmemoryScraper\n\nThis structure is designed to secretly upload the malware and clean up all the evidence of\nthe attack. However, the ultimate goal of this innovation is unclear until we examine other\nmodules. From looking at any TrickBot modules we can clearly understand its purpose. But\nwhen it comes to Anchor we see a combination of functionality, tools, and methods. What is\n\n\n-----\n\nout of the question, however, is the sophistication of this technology including an integrated\nmethodology of loading such frameworks Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, TerraLoader, and\nPowerShell Empire to perform further victim post-exploitation.\n\nThe Anchor project combines a collection of tools — from the initial installation tool to the\ncleanup meant to scrub the existence of malware on the victim machine. In other words,\nAnchor presents as an all-in-one attack framework designed to compromise enterprise\nenvironments using both custom and existing toolage.\n\nAs described earlier, TrickBot modules are customer-based, designed for the needs of a\nspecific criminal activity. The Anchor project is a complex and stealthy tool for targeted data\nextraction from secure environments and long-term persistency. Logically, this tool will be a\nvery tempting acquisition for high-profile, possibly nation-state groups. However, the Anchor\nis also be used for large cyber heists and point-of-sale card theft operations leveraging its\ncustom card scraping malware. Among the nation-state groups, only a few are interested in\nboth data collection and financial gain, and one of them is Lazarus.\n\nLazarus Group (also known as “Lazarus,” “Hidden Cobra,” and “Kimsuky”) is an advanced\npersistent threat (APT) group comprised of operators from “Bureau 121” (121국), the cyber\nwarfare division of North Korea’s RGB. The group has been active since at least 2009 and is\npresumed to operate out of a multitude of international locations.\n\nLazarus appears to have been interested in a variety of sectors and targets in the last\neighteen months, including cryptocurrency exchanges, financial institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and South Korean individuals. Many North Korea cyber\noperators are likely not only self-funded but also tasked with earning income for the North\nKorean regime; Lazarus Group has likely targeted banks cryptocurrency exchanges and\nusers to achieve this goal.\n\nDuring our investigation of Anchor, we discovered the tool PowerRatankba that was\npreviously linked to the purported North Korean group was, in fact, used in Anchor.\n\nThe specific evidence pointed out that this Lazarus group toolkit was loaded via the TrickBot\nAnchor project pointing to the now-unmasked relationship between the tools attributed to\nTrickBot “Anchor” group and Lazarus.\n\n## Uniting the Ununitible — Crimeware Meets APT\n\n\n-----\n\nThe integration of these tools into the Anchor implies that TrickBot was able to overcome the\nfinal barrier in integrating different domains into its model. By integrating the APT approach\nto its model the group turned its enterprise into a holistic ecosystem of cybercrime, becoming\nan essentially new phenomenon. In this ecosystem, crimeware and APT are no longer\nsiloed; on the opposite, each type of crime creates added value for the other, each becomes\na force multiplier.\n\n## Conclusion: The Deadly Planeswalker\n\nThe Anchor is not simply a new addition to a long list of TrickBot modules and projects, it is a\nconclusion of many years of the cybercrime evolution, a point at which all puzzles assemble.\nThrough its history, TrickBot was adding new markets to its area of operations, steadily\nconquering the cybercrime world. First, it blurred the line between infostealing and bankers\nthen between trojans and ransomware and between financial fraud and malware.\n\nThrough the history of cybercrime, APT was a Kantian “thing-in-itself”; making it an integral\npart of a broader business model required a technical and organizational revolution. With the\nAnchor project, TrickBot became this revolutioner. TrickBot and Dridex groups remained to\nbe some of the most sophisticated crimeware groups since “Business Club.” While Dridex’s\n“Evil Corp” members were publically charged and outed responsible for over $100 million in\nlosses, the TrickBot group continued to innovate and stay active with more diverse\ncrimeware models than Dridex.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ability to seamlessly integrate the APT into a monetization business model is evidence\nof a quantum shift. By accomplishing this integration, TrickBot overtly demonstrates that they\nhave achieved a qualitatively new level of a cybercrime enterprise, which was never seen\nbefore in magnitude and complexity superseding and dethroning the legacy of its previous\ninspiration and its playground known as “Business Club.”\n\n[Read the Full Report](https://assets.sentinelone.com/labs)\n\n[IOCs on GitHub](https://github.com/SentineLabs/TrickBot-Anchor)\n\n\n-----",
