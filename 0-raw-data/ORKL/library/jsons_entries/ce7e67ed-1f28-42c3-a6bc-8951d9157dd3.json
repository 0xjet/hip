We cannot confirm if these other groups were directly targeted. These news websites report on\n\nissues sensitive to the government of China and are blocked in the country. However, this report does not conclusively\n\nattribute the campaign to a publicly reported threat actor or state sponsor.\n\nThe malware operation made efforts to evade detection and frustrate analysis. The operation combined obfuscated, packed\n\nexecutables and custom shellcode with an additional step of using compromised servers to host the malicious payload. We\n\nidentify the payload as NetWire, a commodity remote access trojan typically seen used in cybercrime activities and not\n\ncommonly observed in Asia.\n\nWe connect the infrastructure used in the campaign to previous malware operations targeting a Tibetan radio station and the\n\nThai government. We also connect one of the code signing certificates we observed to a campaign targeting gaming\n\ncompanies. It is notable that NetWire was also used as a payload in that campaign.\n\n# Summary\n\n[A journalist at China Digital Times (CDT), (an independent Chinese and English language news portal), receives an email from a](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/)\n\nsource claiming to have a tip on a sensitive story: “I have insider information that is different from what you’ve published”. The email\n\nincludes a link to an article from the news portal. Clicking on the link displays the article with a pop-up message asking the journalist\n\nto enter their username and password in prompt designed to look like a WordPress login page. What is normally a routine\n\ninteraction for the journalist has become increasingly threatening. The tip from the source is actually an attempt to steal the\n\njournalist’s WordPress credentials used to manage and publish content to the news portal.\n\nThe rouse used in the phishing email was clever, but it did not work. The journalist was immediately suspicious of the phishing\n\nattempts and shared them with researchers at the Citizen Lab to analyze, which led to the discovery of a wider campaign targeting\n\nChinese language news sites using various tactics including reconnaissance, phishing, and malware. The campaign used domains\n\n[and copied content that masqueraded as Epoch Times, Mingjing News, HK01, and Bowen Press. It is not clear if these other news](http://www.theepochtimes.com/)\n\ngroups were directly targeted. These organizations often report on issues that are politically sensitive to the government of China\n\nand their websites are blocked in the country. Our analysis of the infrastructure used in this campaign reveals connections to\n\nprevious malware operations targeting Tibetan journalists and the Thai government. These incidents includes targets that are\n\ngenerally within the geopolitical interest of the government of China. However, this report does not conclusively attribute the\n\ncampaign to a publicly reported threat actor or state sponsor.\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n-----\n\np, p g, p\n\n[servers of Associated Press offices in London and Hong Kong.

It was founded by Xiao Qiang, a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley who has been](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/xiao-qiang)\n\n[engaged in human rights activism since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/interviews/xiao.html)\n\nOn February 12, 2017, a CDT staff member received an email from a person claiming to be a UC Berkeley student with “insider\n\ninformation” on claims made by 郭云贵 (Guo Yungui) on “hacker attacks” against the Chinese language news site Mingjing News.\n\n[The characters 郭云贵 (Guo Yungui) appears to be a slight variation of Guo Wengui (郭文贵), a Chinese billionaire who has gained](http://m.weekly.caixin.com/m/2015-03-27/100795235.html)\n\n[notoriety after voicing allegations that high ranking officials in the Communist Party of China are engaged in corruption.

This email included a\n\nlink that, at first glance, appeared to be the domain of China Digital Times, but with a slight misspelling. Instead of\n\nchinadigitaltimes.net the link sent was chinadagitaltimes[.]net with an added ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’ in the word digital. A day\n\nafter this email was sent, other staff members at CDT received similar emails with the same link (see below).\n\n\n**Original Email Text**\n\nFrom: sda daaa <aisia.anminda8@mail.com>\n\nDate: February 14 2017\nSubject: 您好，我想向您爆料相关内幕\nTo: [REDACTED]\n您好：\n我有关于中国时代日报上的一篇文章最新的消息，中国黑客攻击的后续事件以及最近明镜网被攻击的内幕信息\n\n文章地址:hXXp://www.chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07/chinese-hackers-blamed-multiple-breaches-fdic/文中写的与我这边得到\n的消息有些差异点\n\n\n**English Translation**\n\nFrom: sda daaa <aisia.anminda8@mail.com>\nDate: February 14 2017\nSubject: hi, I'd like to offer you some insider information.\nTo: [REDACTED]\n\nI have the latest information on an article published by China Daily. It’s about follow-ups on the incident of Chinese hackers\nand some insider information on the recent attacks against Mingjing News.\n\nLink to the article.\nhXXp://www.chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07/chinese-hackers-blamed-multiple-breaches-fdic/The information presented in the\n\narticle is slightly different from the information I know.\n\n\nThe link connects to a web page that mirrors content from the real CDT website displaying an article related to hacker groups from\n\nChina (see Figure 1 for comparison of the real and fake content).\n\n\n-----\n\nVisually, the content is identical. The only substantive difference between the real and fake content is a few lines of javascript code\n\n(see Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2: Snippet of Javascript code in the source of the fake China Digital Times webpage._\n\nThe function of this code is to pop a window on the screen that says “您的登录已失效,请重新登录!” [Your login has expired, please\n\nlog in again!] (see Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3: Screenshot of the fake China Digital Times webpage and the popup message displayed._\n\nIf the OK button is clicked, the user is forwarded to what appears to be a WordPress login page (see Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Fake WordPress Login page_\n\nCredentials entered into this page are sent to the operators. Following entry of credentials, users are forwarded to the real CDT site.\n\nThe real CDT website runs on WordPress, and therefore the purpose of this phishing campaign is to steal credentials to the actual\n\nCDT website and gain access. The operators customized a fake domain to host real content and developed custom phishing pages\n\nfor stealing the WordPress credentials demonstrating a substantial level of effort.\n\n## Phishing Operation Timeline\n\nThrough analysis of the server used to host the phishing pages and the phishing emails sent to CDT we documented the activities\n\nand timeline of the operation, which lasted for approximately 20 days (see Figure 5). The operation began with the operators\n\nscanning the real CDT website for vulnerabilities. Five days later the first phishing email was sent. The next day the operators\n\nregistered the domain mimicking the CDT site, set up the fake site, and sent out phishing emails with links to it. Over the next week\n\nfurther phishing emails were sent to CDT. Through analysis of log files found on the server we observed what appears to be the\n\noperators testing the phishing page during this period. The last phishing email sent to CDT was on February 20. Eight days later the\n\nfake CDT website was taken down and no further phishing emails were sent.\n\n_Figure 5: Timeline of the phishing operation targeting China Digital Times_\n\n## Reconnaissance and phishing server\n\n\n-----\n\ng gj g\n\nThe links sent in the emails to CDT are both on the same IP address: 43[.]240[.]14[.]37, hosted by Cloudie, a hosting\n\nprovider based in Hong Kong. The link provided in the first phishing email sent to CDT included the full IP address of the server.\n\n\nhXXp://43.240.14.37/asdasdasadqddd12222111[.]php/article.asp=search.php\n\n\nFour days after the first phishing email was sent to CDT we accessed the content on the page and found it served content copied\n\n[from a Mingjing News article about illicit sales of Chinese visas (See Figure 6 for comparison of the real and fake content).](http://www.mingjingnews.com/TV/video/V000013942)\n\n_Figure 6: Comparison of the real and fake Mingjing news site_\n\nThe fake page did not render correctly and was missing content, which may be due to improper mirroring of the content, or possibly\n\nbecause the page relies on external content in a location that changed since the initial copy. Comparing the legitimate page to the\n\nfake page finds no addition of code by the operator on the fake page.\n\n### Reconnaissance Server Log Analysis\n\nWe investigated the directory of the fake Minjing News page and found the content was\n\nmodified on February 14, 2017 and discovered a file ‘log.txt’. This file is a custom log that captures three pieces of information\n\nfrom every visitor to the page: IP address, web browser user agent, and time visited (see Figure 7). There is no malicious content\n\non the page. We suspect that the purpose of this page is to perform reconnaissance of targets by testing if users will click on the\n\nlink, and by retrieving IP addresses and user agent information.\n\n_Figure 7: Server directory containing the log.txt file._\n\nThe first visit in the log file is on February 2, 2017 from the IP address 45[.]124[.]24[.]39 which is also hosted on Cloudie.\n\nThis visit is likely from the operators because it was the first visit and from the same provider on which the server is hosted. There\n\nare also t o isits in the logs ithin seconds of each other from the IP address 125[ ]86[ ]123[ ]47 (ChinaNet Chongqing\n\n\n-----\n\ngq g ( )\n\n\n45[.]124[.]24[.]39 Cloudie HK\n141[.]08[.]99[.]155: ChinaNet Chongqing\n\n\nWe shared these IP addresses with CDT to check if the addresses had visited the real CDT website around the period of the\n\nphishing emails. We found that the Cloudie IP address (45[.]124[.]24[.]39) visited the real CDT web site 42,000 times on\n\nFebruary 8 2017, during a four hour period. The rate of the requests, user agents utilized, and information requested indicates that\n\nthese visits were attempts to enumerate HTTP paths on the website to test for vulnerabilities. This scan occurred less than a week\n\nbefore the operators staged the phishing page sent to CDT.\n\n### Phishing Server Log Analysis\n\nBetween February 14 and 28, 2017, a direct visit to the URL hXXp://43[.]240[.]14[.]37 returned a copy of the CDT\n\nhomepage (see Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8: Comparison of the real frontpage of CDT (as seen on day the emails were sent) and the fake webpage_\n\nThis fake homepage was not included in the emails sent to CDT. The operators potentially included this homepage if users clicked\n\nthe link in the email and then viewed the top level URL to ensure they were on the right site (see below).\n\n\nEmail Link: chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07/chinese-hackers-blamed-multiple-breaches-fdic\nHome page: chinadagitaltimes[.]net\n\n\nThe directory of chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07 shows the content listed on the server and lists the last modified date of\n\nthe content as February 15, 2017 (see Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 9: An index listing on the phishing server._\n\nWe found a file ‘log.txt’ on the fake CDT home page and article web pages. This log file records the IP address, browser user\n\n\n-----\n\nThe logs only included what we suspect to be fake credentials, which demonstrates the phishing attempts were unsuccessful. The\n\nfirst entry on February 16, 2017 may be a record of the operator testing the phishing page.\n\n\nusername:1111----password:1111----2017-02-16 09:26:14\n\n\nOn February 28, we again see what appear to be test credentials added.\n\n\nusername:12312----password:1232131----2017-02-28 10:25:33\n\n\n## Phishing Operation Final Stages\n\nOn February 20, the CDT staff member who received the original phishing email was sent a follow-up email that responded to an\n\nauto away message from the staff member and reminded the recipient about the link that was sent. This was the last phishing email\n\nsent to CDT (see below):\n\n\n**Original Email Text**\n\nFrom: papa papa hellomice@mail.com\n\nTo: [REDACTED]\nDate: February 20 2017\nSubject: Re: 我是伯克利加州大学的学生，我想认识一下您,我有爆料\n\n谢谢来信。非常抱歉我本月20号之前都没有时间，请月底和我再联系。谢谢。2017-02-13 18:34 GMT-08:00 papa\npapa hellomice@mail.com\n我想向您爆料，关于郭云贵说中国黑客攻击明镜具体内幕，\n\nhXXp://43.240.14.37/asdasdasadqddd12222111[.]php/article.asp=search.php\n\n\n**English Translation**\n\nFrom: papa papa hellomice@mail.com\n\nTo: [REDACTED]\nDate: February 20 2017\nSubject: Re: I am a student at UC Berkeley.

The bare IP of the server\n\n(43[.]240[.]14[.]37) also switched to returning a default CentOS test page. After the site was taken down on February 28 no\n\nadditional phishing emails were sent and we observed no other activity.\n\nAnalysis of passive DNS records and WHOIS registration information associated with the server infrastructure used to host the fake\n\nCDT page led to the discovery that the phishing operation targeting CDT was part of a wider campaign.\n\n# Part 2: Uncovering a Wider Campaign\n\n_This section reveals how the operation against China Digital Times was part of a wider campaign of phishing, reconnaissance, and_\n\n_malware operations that used domains and content made to mimic four other Chinese language news organizations._\n\n## Infrastructure Connections\n\nAfter examining the server used to host the fake CDT page and referencing passive DNS records and WHOIS registration\n\ninformation, we found other fake domains registered by the same entity with copied content from Chinese-language news sites. Our\n\nanalysis shows that the operators are using the fake domains for at least three different purposes: reconnaissance, phishing, and\n\nmalware. We were only able to collect phishing emails sent to CDT and cannot confirm if the other media organizations were direct\n\n\n-----\n\ng p\n\n**Organization** **Fake Domain Registered Site contents copied Confirmed targeting Purpose**\n\nChina Digital Times X X X Phishing\n\nMingjing News X Recon\n\nHK01 X Malware\n\nBowen Press X X Unknown\n\nEpoch Times X Unknown\n\nThe fake domains are linked by common WHOIS registration information, which shows they were all registered by the same entity.\n\nThe WHOIS registration information used to register the fake CDT domain is as follows:\n\n|Organization|Fake Domain Registered|Site contents copied|Confirmed targeting|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|China Digital Times|X|X|X|Phishing|\n|Mingjing News||X||Recon|\n|HK01||X||Malware|\n|Bowen Press|X|X||Unknown|\n|Epoch Times|X|||Unknown|\n\n\nName: free tibet\nMailing Address: Uniter states, Phoenix Arizona 86303 US\nPhone: +1.2126881188\n\nEmail: aobama_5@yahoo.com\n\n\nWe found a series of domains registered with the same information.

Epoch\n\nTimes found a Cloudie IP (103.200.31[.]164) that sent 24,183 requests during a 12 hour period on March 8, 2017 to the\n\nsubscription page of Epoch Times at the URL subscribe.epochtimes.com. These requests appear to be attempts to\n\nenumerate HTTP paths, similar to the requests sent to China Digital Times on February 8.\n\nGiven the timeframe of the registration of the fake Epoch Times domain, we suspect the operators may have moved from targeting\n\nCDT to Epoch Times. The fake Epoch Times domain was hosted on the same server as the fake CDT and Mingjing pages\n\n(43.240.14[.]37). However, we did not find content copied from any Epoch Times websites on the operator’s infrastructure\n\nduring the investigation and did not have any phishing emails reported to us. It is possible that the fake Epoch Times domain is\n\nbeing used for phishing or reconnaissance, but we are unable to confirm.\n\nIn addition to phishing and reconnaissance activities the operators are also engaged in malware operations and have a dedicated\n\nserver for this purpose.

The operation combined_\n\n_obfuscated, packed executables, and custom shellcode with an additional step of using compromised servers to host the malicious_\n\n_payload. We identify the payload as NetWire, a commodity remote access trojan that is not commonly observed in Asia and_\n\n_typically seen used in cybercrime activities._\n\n## Malware server and analysis\n\nOur investigation of the malware operation began with analysis of the server used to host the malware. The malware server is on\n\nthe IP address: 23[.]239[.]106[.]119 hosted by GorillaServers, a provider based in the United States. We found the server by\n\nresolving the domain datalink[.]one, which was one of the domains registered by the operators.\n\nOn the server we found domains and copied content mimicking HK01 and Bowen Press, but cannot confirm if these groups were\n\ndirect targets of the malware operation or if the content was used as lures to target other groups.\n\nPassive DNS records for the IP address: 23[.]239[.]106[.]119 show a number of other domains that we have connected to\n\nthe operators including:\n\n**Domains**\n\ndatalink[.]one\n\nget.adobe.com.bowenpress[.]org\n\nhk.secuerserver[.]com\n\npop.secuerserver[.]com\n\nsmtpout.secuerserver[.]com\n\nwww.bowenpress[.]org\n\nwww.mail.secuerserver[.]com\n\nwww.secuerserver[.]com\n\nwww.vnews[.]hk\n\nWe found that some of these domains were used as command and control servers for the malware we found hosted on the domain.\n\n### HK01 Lure\n\nWhen we first investigated the malware server on March 6, 2017 we found it was hosting what appears to be a copy of the\n\nfrontpage of HK01, a Hong Kong-based news site (see Figure 10).\n\n_Figure 10: Comparison of real and fake HK01 webpages_\n\nThe copied version of the HK01 site is missing the centre content displayed on the real site.\n\nInstead it shows a link with the following text: “Adobe Flash Player 版本過低，請點擊” [Adobe Flash Player this version is outdated.\n\nPlease click].\n\nThe link connects to: hXXp://get.adobe.com.bowenpress.org/Adobe/update/20161201/AdobeUpdate[.]html\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\n\nWe browsed the directory of 23[.]239[.]106[.]119/adobe/update and found three different sub directories that each served\n\nthree different executables (see Figure 11). A fourth sub directory and fourth executable appeared on March 12, 2017. Analysis of\n\nthese executables shows they are malware.\n\n_Figure 11: Server directory containing malicious executables._\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nThe malicious binaries combined obfuscated, packed executables, and custom shellcode with an additional step of using\n\ncompromised servers to host the malicious payload. We identify the final payload as NetWire, a commodity remote access trojan\n\nthat is not commonly observed in Asia and typically seen used in cybercrime activities.\n\nThe four executables we found in the “Adobe update” directory are named to appear as an update for Adobe Flash followed by a\n\ndate stamp (e.g., AdobeUpdate20160703.exe).\n\nEach malware file was digitally signed:\n\n|File|Certificate Details|\n|---|---|\n|AdobeUpdate20160703.exe|无锡凯扬电子科技有限公司 Serial: 57 be 1a 00 d2 e5 9b db d1 95 24 aa a1 7e d9 3b Valid From: Thursday, November 19, 2015 5:45:01 PM Valid To: Saturday, November 19, 2016 5:45:01 PM|\n|AdobeUpdate20160812.exe|深圳市乐途儿科技有限公司 Serial: 68 be c5 c0 26 4c c9 09 6d 2f b2 0a 98 86 e9 4d Valid From: Monday, June 15, 2015 4:00:00 PM Valid To: Thursday, June 15, 2017 3:59:59 PM|\n\n\nAdobeUpdate20161201.exe\n\nAdobeUpdate20170312.exe\n\n\nElex do Brasil Participações Ltda\n\n**Serial: 06 71 ee 52 6a cb 6f 9b e2 01 f5 a8 e2 03 c4 1c**\n\n**Valid From: Sunday, April 12, 2015 4:00:00 PM**\n\n\n-----\n\n[All four samples are packed with VMProtect, software used to obfuscate source code to make anaylsis and reverse engineering](http://vmpsoft.com/)\n\nmore difficult. When executed the samples unpack and drop a second VMProtect-packed DLL to the following location:\n\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\VGX\\Stub.dll\n\n\nBefore executing the dropped DLL via rundll32 as shown:\n\n\nrundll32.exe C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\VGX\\Stub.dll,Install\n\n\nThis stub DLL unpacks itself and then gains persistence by creating a new autorun service: COM+ Event Log. The DLL edits the\n\nfollowing registry keys to create this new service:\n\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost\\EventSystemLog\n\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventSystemLog\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet002\\Services\\EventSystemLog\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet003\\Services\\EventSystemLog\n\n\nOnce the DLL has gained persistence it starts the newly created service. When run as part of a service, the DLL unpacks itself and\n\nattempts to download what appears to be a jpg file hosted on one of three websites: a Chinese-language news organization, a\n\nUniversity, and a software company.\n\nEach of the 4 samples uses a different URL. Each of these files begins with a 631 byte jpg header followed by encrypted\n\nshellcode. The malware first decrypts the payload immediately after the jpg header using the following algorithm:\n\n\nfor i = 0; i < len(payload); i++ payload[i] = (16 * ~((((payload[i] ^ 0x50) >> 4) ^ i) &\n0xf) & 0xef) ^ payload[i]\n\n\nThe decrypted payload begins with a short header consisting of an unsigned 32 bit integer that is the size of the stage 2 payload, an\n\nunsigned 32 bit integer used as a checksum, and 64 bytes of padding. This header is followed by a block of shellcode and a second\n\nencrypted payload (see Figure 12). The shellcode decrypts the stage 2 payload using RC4 with different 256-bit keys for each\n\nsample.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Hex code showing jpg header followed by encrypted shellcode_\n\n[This decrypted data contains additional shellcode followed by a PE file. We identify the PE file as the Netwire RAT. The final stage](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/netwire-rat-steals-payment-card-data)\n\nshellcode acts as a loader and maps the RAT into memory and resolves the RAT’s imports before jumping to the RAT’s entrypoint.\n\nNetwire RAT is a multi-platform RAT (Remote Access Tool) that first appeared in 2012. Since its appearance, Netwire RAT has\n\n[been used in a variety of attacks ranging from stealing credit card data to targeted campaigns against health care and banking](https://threatpost.com/netwire-rat-back-stealing-payment-card-data/122156/)\n\nsectors. The Netwire samples we analyzed are capable of a wide-range of behavior including:\n\nReading stored usernames and passwords from common apps including:\n\nWeb Browsers\n\nEmail Clients\n\nInstant Messaging Clients\n\nKeylogging\n\nTaking Screenshots\n\nAudio capture\n\nScreen recording\n\nProcess listing, creation, killing, etc.\n\nUploading and downloading files\n\nEach of the 4 fake jpg files contains a Netwire sample containing different configuration settings. After analyzing the samples we\n\nrecovered the configuration settings for each sample (see Appendix A). The use of multiple layers of packed or obfuscated\n\npayloads is likely an attempt to evade detection and analysis. Downloading the RAT each time the malware runs could be an\n\nattempt to hide the final payload, as the Netwire samples are never written to disk. This process makes direct analysis difficult\n\n\n-----\n\np p y\n\nEach of the four binary samples we analyzed downloaded a copy of the Netwire RAT as a different “jpg” file. The three hosts used\n\nare all legitimate servers with active web pages. In each case, the jpg downloaded by the malware is noticeably larger than other\n\nfiles in the same directory on the server and was last modified more recently. We believe that each of the three servers used to host\n\nthe “jpg” files have been compromised and that the operator is using these legitimate servers to host their payload in an effort to\n\nhide their activities.\n\nLike the phishing operation, the malware setup shows a significant level of effort. We observe custom shellcode paired with an\n\nadditional step of using likely-compromised servers to host the payload. While Netwire has been seen in some targeted intrusions, it\n\nhas primarily been used in cybercrime activities and is not common in Asia.\n\n## Bowen Press Lures\n\nThe earliest domains registered by the operators that follow the pattern of mimicking China related news organizations were decoys\n\nfor Bowen Press. The real Bowen Press domain is bowenpress[.]com, the operators registered bowenpress[.]org. We were\n\nunable to retrieve the content that originally appeared on the domains in 2015. However, we were able to find copied Bowen Press\n\ncontent on the malware server through Google searches on the “news” subdirectory of the server. The content was an iframe of the\n\nfront page of Bowen Press and results in rendering additional error messages (See Figure 13). The existence of Bowen Press\n\ncontent on this server suggests that the operators may have been using Bowen Press lures to serve malware.\n\n_Figure 13: Comparison of real and fake Bowen Press webpages_\n\nAdditionally,we found the Netwire samples in a directory under the URL www.bowenpress[.]org/Adobe/update, even though\n\nthe website serving the sample was a copy of HK01. The use of this URL path further suggests that the fake Bowen Press domain\n\nand content were used to serve malware at some point. The operators may have simply reused the domain for the HK01 related\n\ncampaign.\n\nOn March 15, 2017, the front page of the malware server was changed to a copy of the Bowen Press website that mirrored content\n\nfrom the same day (see Figure 14). The copied page did not contain any malicious code and we were unable to find a log.txt file\n\non the server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Screenshot of the malware server on March 15 2017 showing copied content from Bowen Press._\n\nThe only change to the content of the page was the removal of a bot check supplied by WordFence, a security plugin for the\n\nWordPress blogging platform. On March 21, the content was removed and the server returned a blank page.\n\nWe cannot confirm what was the purpose of the recently copied Bowen Press content. However, it shows that the operators have\n\nhad a continued interest in using Bowen Press content as lures potentially to serve malware.\n\n# Part 3: Campaign Connections\n\n_This section links infrastructure used in the campaign against the Chinese-language news sites to previous malware campaigns_\n\n_targeting a Tibetan Radio Station and the Thai government. It also highlights connections between certificate information used to_\n\n_sign the Netwire samples we analyzed and malware used in campaigns targeting gaming companies._\n\n## Infrastructure Connections to Malware Operations against Tibetan Radio Station\n\nDomain registration information for some of the infrastructure used in the campaign have links to earlier targeted malware\n\noperations against civil society and government groups in Asia.\n\nThe WHOIS records for the domains used in the phishing and malware operations include the phone number (12126881188).\n\nSearching other WHOIS records for this number reveals a known command and control server with a Tibet theme. The WHOIS\n\ninformation for this domain matches all the fields with the exception of the email address. All other fields used match including the\n\nsame address and misspelling of United States as ‘Uniter States’.\n\n\nDomain: www.tibetonline[.]info\nName: free tibet\nMailing Address: Uniter states, Phoenix Arizona 86303 US\nPhone: +1.2126881188\nEmail: rooterit@outlook.com (admin)\n\nfightfortibet@ymail.com (billing)\n\n\nThe registrant e-mail is linked to another domain in addition to tibetonline[.]info which is rooter[.]tk. Both these\n\ndomains are linked to a 2013 campaign targeting Voice of Tibet, an independent radio station reporting on Tibetan issues. In this\n\n\n-----\n\ng p p y y ( [ ] ) p ( )\n\n## Infrastructure Connections to Malware Operations against Thai Government\n\n[The domain tibetonline[.]info was also identified by Palo Alto Networks as a command and control server used for FFRAT](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/attack-campaign-on-the-government-of-thailand-delivers-bookworm-trojan/)\n\n[malware recently described by Cylance. This infrastructure overlapped with servers used by a threat actor targeting Thai](https://www.cylance.com/en_us/blog/breaking-down-ff-rat-malware.html)\n\ngovernment entities with the Bookworm trojan in 2015. The general tactics, techniques, and procedures used by this threat actor\n\nalso show similarities to the campaign we analysed. Both used the same hosting provider on one IP: Cloudie HK\n\n(103.226.127[.]47), and used fake Adobe updates to lure targets into installing malware. The threat actor documented by Palo\n\nAlto also used fake news site domains (e.g., vancouversun[.]us, yomiuri[.]us, voanews[.]hk, and nhknews[.]hk)\n\nFinally, both operations leveraged compromised web servers for command and control.\n\n## Certificate Connections to Malware Targeting Gaming Companies\n\n[In October 2016 Cylance disclosed information on a threat actor called “PassCV”, which targeted the gaming industry and used](https://blog.cylance.com/digitally-signed-malware-targeting-gaming-companies)\n\nstolen code signing certificates to sign malware.\n\n[The disclosure was an update to information published by Symantec in July 2014 and Kaspersky’s 2013 view into Winnti.](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2014-07-21/korean-gaming-industry-still-under-fire)\n\nCylance lists three malware samples signed with one of the same certificates used to sign one of the Netwire dropper files in the\n\noperation we report on:\n\n\n57 BE 1A 00 D2 E5 9B DB D1 95 24 AA A1 7E D9 3B\n\n\nIn addition, Cylance also notes the discovery of Netwire being used in the same campaign. The use of Netwire is notable as it is the\n\nonly other mention of it being used in Chinese-nexus malware operations of which we are aware.\n\n[The disclosure was an update to information published by Symantec in July 2014 and Kaspersky’s 2013 view into Winnti.](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2014-07-21/korean-gaming-industry-still-under-fire)\n\n## Explaining the Connections\n\nThese overlaps point to a number of potential scenarios. The campaign we analyzed may have been conducted by the same threat\n\nactors as the previous operations. Alternatively the overlap may be an artifact of resource sharing between separate but unrelated\n\n[threat actors — potentially through the use of a “digital quartermaster” (a group that supplies operators with malware and other](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\n\nresources), or more informal means. While the first scenario is possible, we do not have enough information to fully substantiate it.\n\nWe suspect that at the least there is some level of sharing and reuse of infrastructure by the same operator or group of operators.\n\nThe targets in most of these other campaigns (ethnic minority groups, government in Southeast Asia, and news sites reporting on\n\nChina) generally fall into the geopolitical interests and strategic concerns of the government of China. However, we have insufficient\n\ninformation to conclusively attribute the campaign to a specific threat actor or state sponsor.\n\n# Part 4: Discussion and Conclusion\n\n_This section summarizes the characteristics of the campaign and how it reflects wider information security challenges for news_\n\n_organizations and journalism._\n\n## A Patient and Persistent Operator\n\nWhile the tactics used in these campaigns are technically simple, the operators demonstrate patience and persistence. They have\n\nbeen using content and domains mimicking Chinese-language news sites as lures since at least 2015, and appear to carefully\n\nmove from one target to another. The phishing campaign against China Digital Times was stood up and taken down in the span of\n\n20 days. In this period, the operators scanned the CDT site for vulnerabilities, registered a lookalike domain, created a fake CDT\n\ndecoy site, and sent the group a wave of customized phishing emails. When these efforts were not successful the operators quickly\n\nshut down the campaign and moved on to new targeting. The malware operation also showed efforts to bypass detection and\n\nanalysis. The operators combined obfuscated, packed executables and custom shellcode with an additional step of using\n\ncompromised servers to host the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n, g p g p g g g y g p g\n\nconnections between these targets and the geopolitical concerns of the Chinese government we cannot conclusively attribute this\n\noperation to a state sponsor. What we can clearly determine is that this operation was conducted by a threat actor active for at least\n\n2 years that targets Chinese language news organizations with intrusion attempts and appears to carefully move from target to\n\ntarget.\n\n## Information Security Challenges for Journalism\n\nThis campaign reflects general information security challenges for news organizations and journalists. Journalists operate in high\npaced environments under intense time pressures. As part of their practice, they regularly receive information from unknown\n\nsources in a variety of media (e.g., social media, email, chat messages, etc). Gathering sources and material requires journalists to\n\nbe open and accessible online. Journalists also may handle sensitive information and contacts. Ideally, information security should\n\n[be part of their standard work process, but information security is but one consideration out of many other competing priorities.](https://medium.com/@mshelton/security-compromises-in-journalism-4cc32ba0709d)\n\n[Journalists and management may not have the same level of awareness or concern for information security threats. Bridging these](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/popets.2016.2016.issue-4/popets-2016-0048/popets-2016-0048.pdf)\n\ngaps, balancing conflicting necessities for openness, availability, and security all within a resource-constrained environment are\n\nmajor challenges. Nonetheless, information security needs to be addressed.\n\n[The case we analyzed (and many](https://citizenlab.org/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/) [others](https://citizenlab.org/2015/12/packrat-report/) [like it) shows journalists and news groups are being targeted by digital espionage](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)\n\noperations designed to access confidential information and systems. The threat is not only against journalists reporting on China.\n\n[Previous research has found digital espionage operations targeting journalists reporting on the Middle East,](https://citizenlab.org/2016/05/stealth-falcon/) [Latin America, Russia,](https://citizenlab.org/2015/12/packrat-report/)\n\nand elsewhere. More work is needed to understand the nature of the threats and ways to mitigate them that are sensitive to the\n\npracticalities and realities of journalism.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to China Digital Times, Epoch Times, Bowen Press, and HK01 for their participation.\n\nThanks to our colleagues for review and assistance: John Scott-Railton, Lotus Ruan, Jeffrey Knockel, Lokman Tsui, Valkyrie-X\n\nSecurity Research Group, Andrew Hilts, Ron Deibert, and TNG.\n\nThis project was supported by the John T. and Catherine D.
