Until 2017, its activity seems to have been confined to the distribution of trojans and\nransomwares [1].\n\n#### 1.1 Malware distributed\n\n##### 1.1.1 Banking trojans\n\nIn terms of final payload, TA505 has always widely used banking trojans that are not specific to it, such as Dridex\nand Trickbot:\n\n###### Dridex\n\nTA505 is supposed to have distributed the Dridex malware [2] as of July 2014, i.e. one month after its creation\n(June 2014) [1]. Its use of specific ID botnets[1] within the Dridex network of botnets, controlled by the Evil Corp\ncybercriminal group, would suggest that TA505 was a Dridex affiliate from 2014 to 2017. ID botnets used by TA505\nbetween 2014 and 2015 would have been botnet IDs 125, 220 and 223. The 220 botnet is thought to have contained\n9650 bots in April 2015 [3], and mainly targeted banks [4], particularly in France. In 2016, TA505 is thought to\nhave mainly concentrated on the use of Locky ransomware, to the detriment of Dridex malware, then resumed\npropagation of Dridex in 2017 through 7200 and 7500 ID botnets. TA505 finally stopped using Dridex in 2018 [5].\n\nFig. 1.1: Dridex Botnet IDs corresponding to TA505\n\n1The number attributed to the version of Dridex associated with a subset of bots it handles. These ID botnets are used to differentiate the\nactivity of each of its affiliates and associate different ID botnets with the same operator.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 3 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n###### TrickBot\n\nTA505 is also thought to have been an affiliate of TrickBot[2], known under the pseudonym of mac1 [5]. The use of\n**TrickBot by TA505 only lasted a few months in 2017. For example, a campaign dating back to June 2017 targeted**\nFrance and the United Kingdom [5].\n\n##### 1.1.2 Ransomware\n\n2016 saw the appearance of Locky ransomware. Frequently used, it has targeted many victims. Like Dridex, Locky\nworks on the principle of affiliates [1].\n\nAccording to Proofpoint, affiliate number 3 of Locky and the affiliate of ID botnet Dridex 220, TA505, have points\nin common, such as similar lures on their phishing emails and very strong similarities regarding Javascript, VBScript\ncodes and Microsoft Word macros used [7]. There is also an absence of Dridex 220 campaigns concomitant with the\nemergence of Locky [8]. Proofpoint [7] also pinpoints links between Locky and the affiliate of Dridex ID botnet\n7200, TA505 at this time, comparing Dridex 2017 campaigns with Locky past campaigns [1]. TA505 is therefore\npresumed to be affiliate number 3 (”Affid=3”) of this ransomware.\n\nAlthough the main ransomware used by the group remains Locky, TA505 is thought to occasionally use other ransomwares (Bart[3], Jaff [4], Scarab [5], Philadelphia[6], GlobeImposter[7] and GandCrab[8]).\n\nLocky stopped operating in 2017.\n\n#### 1.2 Distribution and compromise methods\n\nTA505 seems to have distributed its malware only through phishing email campaigns. This intrusion set was characterised by its massive use of Necurs botnet (see appendix in chapter 5) for the distribution of emails [9].\n\n_Comment: open source reports associate all ransomwares distributed by the Necurs botnet to TA505. However, some of_\n_these ransomwares were used over the same periods. It seems unlikely that TA505 operated as many encryption codes_\n_at the same time. It is more likely that Necurs had several clients simultaneously._\n\nThis intrusion set relies exclusively over that period on social engineering to run its payload contained in malicious\nattachments linked to emails sent [9]. These attachments could be zip or 7zip archives containing VBS script or\nJavascript to be run by their victims, HTML pages containing malicious Javascript, or Offices documents bugged\nwith malicious macros.\n\nAlthough TA505 does not seem to have used software vunerability to compromise its targets, it is interesting to\nobserve that it has kept up to speed with the latest social engineering techniques. It therefore distributed bugged\nOffice documents via the DDE mechanism less than a month after the potential abuse of this feature became\ncommon knowledge [10].\n\n2Trickbot, which appeared in October 2016, and a derivative of Dyre, possibly operated by members of the Business Club until November 2015.\nReminder: the Business Club was responsible for JabberZeuS and GameOverZeuS(GoZ) malware. When the GoZ botnet was dismantled,\nthe Business Club is thought to have divided its activites between Dridex and Dyre malware. Trickbot could be operated by former members\nof the Business Club, or by a copycat having acquired the source code of Dyre [6].\n3ransomware which was very limited during 2016.\n4ransomware active from May to June 2017.\n5Variant of the first open-source Hidden Tear ransomware (published in 2015), used for the first time by TA505 in June 2017.\n6Ransomware-as-a-Service available for 400 dollars on the Dark Web.\n7ransomware used from July to December 2017. 24 campaigns distributing GlobeImposter were found by Proofpoint in December 2017 [9,\n\n5]\n8Ransomware-as-a-Service used from January to March 2018 [5]\n\n20/08/2020 Page 4 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n### 2 Development of TA505 since 2018\n\nThe year 2018 was a turning point in the attack methods of the intrusion set. TA505 gradually reduced its distribution of malicious banking codes and ransomwares to move into the distribution of backdoors.\n\nHowever, this intrusion set does not seem to be content with running a payload on its victim’s computer. When it\ndeems it useful, TA505 tries to compromise the entirety of the information system (IS) it penetrated.\n\nIt also seems, in some cases, to resell accesses to the backdoors it has installed, which makes it difficult to distinguish\nbetween specific TA505 activities and those of potential clients.\n\nThe chain of attack described in this chapter corresponds to the activities that ANSSI believes are linked to the\nintrusion set.\n\n#### 2.1 Infection vector\n\nThe only infection vector currently known to be used by the TA505 intrusion set is phishing emails including a\nmalicious attachment or link. Until 2018, the intrusion set relied practically exclusively on the Necurs botnet to\ndistribute its payloads. However, following the unavailability of the botnet in January and February 2018, TA505\nseems to have less often used its services [9].\n\nThis last point however is uncertain as there is little information on the alternative email distribution methods\nof the intrusion set. Given that TA505 has often deployed an email credentials theft implant among its victims\n\n[11][12], it is possible that it accumulates email addresses to distribute its new phishing campaigns.\n\nIt has also been mentioned that some of its phishing emails had been distributed via machines infected by the\n**Amadey [11] malware. Given that TA505 also uses Amadey malware as indicated in section 2.3.1, it may have cre-**\nated its own Amadey botnet to distribute its malicious emails, or may use the services of an existing Amadey botnet.\n\nThis operating mode also usurps the recipient addresses of its emails, which makes it difficult to analyse its email\ndistribution infrastructure [13].\n\n#### 2.2 Social engineering\n\nThe intrusion set continues to rely on social engineering to run its malicious payloads on the machines of its email\nrecipients, using several formats for attachments to work around its targets’ security systems: .url [14], .iqy [9],\nSettingContent-ms [15], MS publisher files [16], .wiz and .pub [17], .iso [18]. The aim of these documents was often\nto run msiexec[9] commands via macros on the victim’s machine to upload and run a malware.\n\nHowever, in the second half of 2019 and first half of 2020, TA505 seems to have modified and stabilised its social\nengineering scheme. It now sends an HTML page as an attachment containing malicious Javascript code. This code\nredirects the victim towards an URL of a legitimate but compromised website.\n\nThis same URL corresponds to an HTML page containing a minimal Javascript code redirecting the victim towards\na page hosted by a machine controlled by the intrusion set. This page mimicks that of a legitimate file-sharing site\nadapted to the target such as Onedrive, Dropbox [19] or Naver[10] (during one of its campaigns in South Korea) [20].\nThe victim is then encouraged to download, open and enable VBA macros of an Office document, usually Excel,\ncontaining a malicious payload .\n\n9Tool used to interact in command line with the installation, updating and de-installation engine of software specific to Microsoft operating\nsystems\n10Korean internet portal service.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 5 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\nFig. 2.1: Initial TA505 compromise method\n\nThe intrusion set gradually increases the complexity of its social engineering method. In October 2019, it is thought\nto have directly sent links towards phishing pages in its malicious emails. It then used URL shorteners to mask these\nmalicious links.\n\nIn late February 2020, it abandoned the URL shortener strategy and started to use HTML attachments with Javascript\nwith redirection from a compromised site, which made it even more difficult to detect its emails. Furthermore, some\nof its redirection pages integrate a link towards iplogger.org, a service allowing the intrusion set to inspect IP addresses visiting these pages[21].\n\nFinally, it has already been observed that the phishing pages of the intrusion set distributed empty Office documents\nwhen a person other than the victim visited them. This behaviour can be explained by the fact that the intrusion\nset filters the IP addresses to which it chooses to distribute its malicious documents or only distributes them within\nlimited time slots.\n\n#### 2.3 Initial compromise\n\nTA505 has a varied attack arsenal to be deployed among its victims having run its malicious attachments. It consists\nof codes available both publicly and commercially on the black market or which seem to be exclusive to it. It\ntherefore has malware development capabilites or financial resources to obtain them. The intrusion set deploys its\narsenal in several stages and has different codes for each of them.\n\n##### 2.3.1 Stage 1 codes\n\nThe TA505 intrusion set seems to have tested several stage 1 codes[11]. It briefly used the following codes:\n\n11a stage 1 code is defined here as an implant with limited features aimed at deploying a more sophisticated code and possibly rapidly performing\nreconnaissance of the infected system to help the intrusion set determine if the victim and their IS are of interest.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 6 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n  - Quant Loader is a simple, low-cost downloader available on the black market. The intrusion set used it from\nJanuary to April 2018 [9].\n\n  - Marap is a downloader that seems specific to the intrusion set. Athough it has a modular structure and a\nknown reconnaissance module, few attacks using this code have been documented and the intrusion set does\nnot seem to have used it since August 2018 [22].\n\n  - Amadey is a downloader available on the black market. This code is thought to have been used from April\nto June 2019 by the intrusion set [23].\n\n  - Andromut, also known as Gelup, is a downloader that seems specific to the intrusion set. This code differs\nfrom the previous ones by setting up anti-analysis mechanisms. However, no occurrence of this code seems\nto have been detected apart from in summer 2019 [24].\n\nThe TA505 intrusion set therefore does not seem to hesitate to discard some of its malwares in order to test others. Despite that, a trend does emerge: it seems to more regularly use the stage 1 malware Get2, whose backdoor\ncomponent is also called Friendspeak [13]. Since the first publication of this malware in September 2019 [19], the\nintrusion set regularly uses it.\n\n**Get2 performs a basic reconnaissance of the machine it infects by sending to its C2 server information such as the**\nname of the infected machine, the name of the user, the version of the Windows operating system and list of active\nprocesses on the machine. In return, if the machine is deemed to be of interest, it receives the URL to which it can\nupload the next stage malware.\n\nFig. 2.2: Timeline of the stage 1 codes used by TA505\n\n##### 2.3.2 Second-level codes\n\nOnce its stage 1 code has been deployed, the intrusion set can deploy several malwares.\n\n  - The FlawedAmmyy malware exists since 2016 and is built from the source code of the publicly disclosed\nlegitimate remote-administration tool Ammyy Admin. Although it has RAT[12] features, FlawedAmmyy has\nalso been used by the intrusion set as a stage 1 code. The intrusion set is thought to have used it between\nMarch 2018 and September 2019 [18]. FlawedAmmyy seems to be exclusively used by TA505 since 2018.\nHowever, this backdoor is thought to have been used before this time period, when TA505 did not use this\ntype of code yet. It is therefore not entirely confirmed that FlawedAmmyy is exclusive to TA505.\n\n  - The tRat malware was used by TA505 in October 2018 [16]. Little information is available about this door.\nModules need to be downloaded for the backdoor to acquire features, yet none of its modules have been\ndocumented.\n\n  - Remote Manipulator System, also called RMS or RmanSyS, is a legitimate tool developed by the Russian\ncompany TEKTONIT, used for malicious purposes. This tool is available free of charge for non-commercial\npurposes and corrupted versions are also available on the black market. TA505 is thought to have started to\ndeploy this tool from November 2018, and until June 2019 [25].\n\n12Remote Administration Tool\n\n20/08/2020 Page 7 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n  - The ServHelper backdoor comes in two [17] versions: one version acts as a stage 1 code, the other has RAT\nfeatures. The intrusion set is supposed to have used this backdoor over a period covering at least from November 2018 to August 2019 [18]. ServHelper does not seem specific to the intrusion set: several IT security researchers have observed attacks in which it was involved but also using methods and tools that are different\nfrom those of TA505 [5][18][26].\n\n  - FlawedGrace, also known as Gracewire, is a backdoor with standard RAT features. It was mentioned for\nbeing used for the first time by TA505 in December 2018 [17] and is thought to be still used by it in 2020 [27].\nLike FlawedAmmyy, TA505 seems for the time being to be the only one to use this backdoor. However its\nexistence prior to 2018 makes it uncertain whether it was used by TA505 exclusively.\n\n  - The FlowerPippi backdoor was detected once in June 2019 [11]. This malware has basic RAT features and it\nis also designed to be used as a stage 1 code by offering initial recognition of the infected system.\n\n  - SDBbot is a malware that seems to be specific to the intrusion set. Its first use was probably September 2019\n\n[20] and the intrusion set has constantly used it since.\n\nFig. 2.3: Timeline of the stage 2 codes used by TA505\n\n#### 2.4 Compromising of the information system\n\nOnce its malwares are installed, the intrusion set can try to lateralise itself within a compromised network. Its goal\nis to become the domain administrator. To achieve this, it uses several methods.\n\n##### 2.4.1 Exploration of the IS\n\nThe intrusion set scans the network to collect more information on the IS and discover vulnerable services [28].\nOne of the tools used by TA505 is the PowerSploit suite, a set of PowerShell scripts available in open-source and\nused to test the security of an IT network. The intrusion set particularly focuses on the Active Directory of the IS\nand has already deployed in the past another penetration test tool, PingCastle, to test configuration weaknesses\naffecting that service.\n\nAlthough crucial to take over the network, the intrusion set does not necessarily seem to perform these operations\nfirst. In several cases observed, the intrusion set firstly tends to try to compromise several other machines before\nscanning the IS and the Active Directory.\n\nThe intrusion set seems to continue its network mapping work after having compromised the credentials of a\ndomain administrator. It has already been observed that TA505 used a query software of Active Directory called\nAdFind on a domain controller to fully map an IS of which it had become the domain administrator.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 8 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n##### 2.4.2 Increasing privileges\n\nThe method preferred by TA505 to increase its privileges and lateralise throughout a network seems to be the\ncollection of credentials on compromised machines. The Mimikatz collection tool, available free of charge in opensource, is regularly used by the intrusion set and other tools of this type may also have been used. Unconfirmed\nhypotheses have also been made on the use of MS17-010 vulnerability [13] by the intrusion set [28].\n\n##### 2.4.3 Lateralisation\n\nTo facilitate its lateralisation operations and increase its robustness within a compromised network, the intrusion\nset has very frequently used Cobalt Strike, a penetration testing framework, and the TinyMet tool[14]. However,\nTA505 also often uses native Window tools such as WMIC and RDP to run its malware on new machines by using\nstolen credentials.\n\n#### 2.5 Actions on objective\n\n##### 2.5.1 IS encryption\n\nThe main goal of the intrusion set is to deploy ransomware. The use of ransomware by this intrusion set goes back\nto at least 2016 with its use of the Locky malware.\n\nMajor developments since 2018 can be explained by the fact that TA505 now seeks to use ransomware to compromise entities liable to pay a high ransom (big game hunting) and to encrypt all the machines of the compromised\nIS.\n\nDuring TA505-related attacks, Clop ransomware, also called Ciop, was deployed. This malware was observed for\nthe first time in February 2019 [20]. It has no automatic propagation functions. Consequently, the intrusion set uses\nsome specific tools to deploy it within a whole IT system. Using a script, it deploys a malware, poorly documented in\nopen-source but until now systematically called « sage.exe » by the intrusion set, on several machines [28]. These\nmachines then connect to all the machines of the victim IS to successively run two payloads on each of them with\na domain administrator account:\n\n  - a malware called DeactivateDefender whose aim is precisely to disable Windows Defender [20][28];\n\n  - the ransomware itself.\n\nIt is probable that TA505 relies on the network mappings performed during the gradual compromission of the IS\nto choose the machines on which to run « sage.exe » and maximise the impact of its ransomware.\n\nAn occurrence of use of the Rapid ransomware by TA505 was also observed by the South Korean Financial Security\nInstitute (FSI) [20] in December 2019.\n\n##### 2.5.2 Blackmail\n\nA website was created in March 2020 to publish exfiltrated data of Clop ransomware victims not having paid their\nransom, probably to increase pressure on future victims. A release was published by the attackers stating that\nshould a hospital be accidentally victim of their ransomware, the data decrypter would be immediately provided.\nIf, as sugested in section 2.5.3, Clop is specific to TA505, this illustrates the capability of this intrusion set to follow\na trend initiated by other ransomware operators [29].\n\nThis trend is also interesting as it indicates that the intrusion set is required to exfiltrate data of its victim’s IS. If such\ndata were to exceed a certain volume, it is then probable that TA505 needs to deploy specific tools and infrastructure\nfor this task. Such things have not yet been observed for this intrusion set.\n\n13Critical vulnerability in the SMB service(Server Message Block) of Windows-run machines. This vulnerability was used during the WannaCry\ninternational campaign in 2017.\n14This tool, freely available in open-source, is a particularly small loading code used to download and run the Meterpreter penetration testing\ntool.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 9 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n##### 2.5.3 Specificity of Clop for TA505\n\nANSSI had mentioned a technical link between Clop ransomware and TA505. Indeed, Clop and FlawedAmmyy\nhad been signed by the same valid but malicious security certificate [30].\n\nTo this, it is possible to add that these two malwares were compiled in similar environments and modified at the\nsame time to change the letter « l » into « i » uppercase [20] in their chains. Furthermore, they have the same\ncharacteristic name « swaqp.exe » in separate attacks.\n\nIt therefore seems probable that one single intrusion set handles both codes. Given that TA505 is the only one to\nhave been seen to use them since 2018, it seems that both codes are specific to it.\n\n#### 2.6 Evasion methods\n\nThe intrusion set multiplies strategies to minimise the detection of its malware. Besides the use of attached document with unusual formats mentioned in section 2.2, TA505 has also used Excel 4.0 type macros. These very old\nmacros were not often detected by security solutions during their adoption by the intrusion set. Likewise, TA505\nrelies heavily on native Windows tools, which require closer supervision of the IS to detect their malicious use.\n\n##### 2.6.1 Use of compression codes\n\nTA505 uses a compression code[15] to make it more difficult to analyse its malware. This code, called Minedoor [13],\nwas used to compress both early stage malwares such as FlawedGrace, and final codes deployed by TA505 such as\n**Clop or DeactivateDefender [31].**\n\nAlthough this compression code is a valuable way to monitor TA505’s arsenal, caution is required. Attacks using\ncodes protected by Minedoor with very different kill chains from that of TA505 have already been observed [13].\nIt therefore seems that this code is not specific to TA505.\n\n##### 2.6.2 Use of signed binaries\n\nThe intrusion set signs its malware by using legitimate but malicious security certificates. They often take over\nnames of existing businesses. TA505’s codes are therefore more difficult to detect [20].\n\nLike the Minedoor malware, it is not certain that all the malware signed by the certificates used by TA505 are linked\nto this intrusion set. Indeed it may be that TA505 used a third party to sign its codes and that this same third party\nmay reuse those certificates to sign the malware of other intrusion sets.\n\n#### 2.7 Attack infrastructure\n\nAs mentioned in section 2.1, the infrastructure used by the intrusion set to distribute its emails is not widely documented.\n\nTA505 particularly seems to rent its infrastructure to conduct its operations, in particular to host its malicious Office documents and for its Get2 C2 servers[16]. The life cycle of this infrastructure is usually less than a month and\nthe intrusion set permanently generates new domain names. These domain names often consist of several words\nseparated by « - » and usually try to typosquat[17] file-sharing services such as Onedrive ou Onehub for example.\n\nTA505 is thought to use a different strategy for the C2 servers of its penetration tools such as TinyMet or Cobalt\nStrike. It directly uses IP adresses as C2 servers and not domain names but still relies on a rented infrastucture.\n\n15Called packer.\n16Command and control servers: these machines are used to send instructions to malware and receive results.\n17Show strong similarities with another domain name for misleading purposes.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 10 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\nLittle information is available about the infrastructure compromised by TA505. Web servers compromised by the\nintrusion set were analysed in February 2019 [20], indicating that several copies of the malicious web console Files**man had been found as well as a non-documented Linux backdoor.**\n\n#### 2.8 Targeting\n\nAlthough they only represent a fraction of the intrusion set’s real activity, the table below presents a set of campaigns conducted by TA505, documented in open-source since 2018.\n\nPeriod Targeted geographical area Targeted sector Source\n\nJanuary 2018 N/A Automotive industry [14]\n\nAugust 2018 N/A Financial [22]\n\nSeptember-October 2018 N/A Financial [32]\n\nFinancial\nNovember 2018 N/A [17]\nRetail\n\nFinancial\nDecember 2018 N/A [17]\nRetail\n\nFood industry\nDistribution [33]\n\nNovember-December 2018 United States\n\nRetail [34]\nCatering\n\nChile, India, Italia, Malawi,\nPakistan, South Africa, Financial\n\nDecember 2018 – March 2019 [25]\n\nSouth Korea, China, Hospitality\nUnited Kingdom, France, United States\n\nFebruary 2019 South Korea N/A [20]\n\nApril 2019 N/A Financial [35]\n\nChile, Mexico, Italia, China,\nApril 2019 N/A [23]\nSouth Korea, Taiwan\n\nUnited Arab Emirates, South Korea,\n\nJune 2019 Singapore, United States, N/A [11]\n\nSaudi Arabia, Morocco\n\n[19]\n\nUnited States, Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia,\nJune-July 2019 Banks [18]\nIndia, Philippines, Indonesia\n\n[11]\n\nJune 2019 Japan, Philippines, Argentina N/A [11]\n\nJuly-August 2019 Saudi Arabia, Oman Government agency [18]\n\nGovernment agency\nJuly-August 2019 Turkey [18]\nEducation\n\nSeptember 2019 Canada, United States N/A [19]\n\n[19]\n\nGreece, Singapore,\n\n[18]\n\nSeptember 2019 United Arab Emirates, Georgia, Financial\n\n[36]\n\nSweden, Lithuania\n\n[11]\n\nFinancial,\nHealthcare,\n\nOctober 2019 United Kingdom, France, United States Retail, [19]\n\nEducation\nResearch\n\nDecember 2019 South Korea N/A [20]\n\nDecember 2019 Germany, Netherlands Education [37]\n\nPharmaceutical\n\n[27]\n\nJanuary-March 2020 United States Healthcare\n\n[19]\n\nRetail\n\nThe financial sector used to be the exclusive target of the intrusion set before 2018 and has remained a regular\ntarget since.\n\nTA505 has however gradually expanded its victim profile to other new sectors.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 11 of 20\n\n|Period|Targeted geographical area|Targeted sector|Source|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|January 2018|N/A|Automotive industry|[14]|\n|August 2018|N/A|Financial|[22]|\n|September-October 2018|N/A|Financial|[32]|\n|November 2018|N/A|Financial Retail|[17]|\n|December 2018|N/A|Financial Retail|[17]|\n|November-December 2018|United States|Food industry Distribution Retail Catering|[33] [34]|\n|December 2018 – March 2019|Chile, India, Italia, Malawi, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, China, United Kingdom, France, United States|Financial Hospitality|[25]|\n|February 2019|South Korea|N/A|[20]|\n|April 2019|N/A|Financial|[35]|\n|April 2019|Chile, Mexico, Italia, China, South Korea, Taiwan|N/A|[23]|\n|June 2019|United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore, United States, Saudi Arabia, Morocco|N/A|[11]|\n|June-July 2019|United States, Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia, India, Philippines, Indonesia|Banks|[19] [18] [11]|\n|June 2019|Japan, Philippines, Argentina|N/A|[11]|\n|July-August 2019|Saudi Arabia, Oman|Government agency|[18]|\n|July-August 2019|Turkey|Government agency Education|[18]|\n|September 2019|Canada, United States|N/A|[19]|\n|September 2019|Greece, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Georgia, Sweden, Lithuania|Financial|[19] [18] [36] [11]|\n|October 2019|United Kingdom, France, United States|Financial, Healthcare, Retail, Education Research|[19]|\n|December 2019|South Korea|N/A|[20]|\n|December 2019|Germany, Netherlands|Education|[37]|\n|January-March 2020|United States|Pharmaceutical Healthcare Retail|[27] [19]|\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\nFrom a geographical point of view, all the continents are targeted by this intrusion set. A point of interest is the\nspecial attention TA505 seems to pay to South Korea. This interest could be linked to the fact that the intrusion set\ncould have been working in connection with the Lazarus intrusion set as mentioned in chapter 3.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 12 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n### 3 Links with other attacking groups\n\n#### 3.1 Clients\n\nGiven its varied arsenal, the broadness of its targets, its sometimes massive, sometimes targeted campaigns, TA505\ncould well be a hacker-for-hire i.e. a provider of IS compromise and access qualification services. Its clients will\nprovide it with a list of potential targets which TA505 will try to compromise, to then sell these compromised or\nqualified accesses to clients.\n\nAt least two potential clients have been identified by editors: the Lazarus intrusion set known to be tied to North\nKorean interests in open-sources and the Silence [38] group.\n\n##### 3.1.1 Lazarus\n\nThe simultaneous presence of Lazarus and TA505 has already been observed by different sources. In early January\n2018, the Vietnamese CERT issued an alert relating to attacks targeting the financial sector, combining indicators\nof compromise attributed to intrusion sets linked to North Korean interests in open-sources to others attributed to\nTA505 [39]. According to Lexfo, IOCs found simultaneously on bank networks and Powershell scripts, attributed to\nTA505 and to Lazarus, seem similar [40].\n\nIn addition, the specific targeting of South Korea by TA505 could indicate an order from a final client such as an\nintrusion set known to be linked in open-sources to North Korean interests.\n\n##### 3.1.2 Silence\n\nThere are code and infrastructure links between FlawedAmmyy and Truebot (aka Silence.Downloader), a remote administration tool specific to Silence[18]. According to the Group-IB editor, FlawedAmmyy.downloader\nand Truebot were developed by the same individual [41]. Furthermore, Silence is thought to have attacked at least\none bank in Europe via TA505 in order to compromise its IS [42].\n\n_Comment: If Silence does indeed call on TA505 for the initial compromise, it would be to change the TTPs, as Silence,_\n_from its beginning, in 2016, is autonomous in the sending of phishing emails and initial compromise._\n\n#### 3.2 FIN7\n\nAccording to the Korean Financial Security Institute (FSI) [20], there are similarities between TA505 and the FIN7\ncybercriminal group, the successor to Carbanak and now specialising in the theft of credit card information. The\ntwo groups are thought to:\n\n  - share the IPs of joint C2 servers ;\n\n  - use FlawedAmmyy, Cobalt Strike and TinyMet (BabyMetal for FIN7);\n\n  - use batch script for internal recognition purposes;\n\n  - be lateralised through the RDP protocol and PSExec;\n\n  - use Shim Database (SDB) in the same way. This particularity is also highlighted by Proofpoint [19].\n\n_Comment: FIN7 and TA505 could in fact be working together. It seems that the FSI observed that an infection chain in_\n_line with those of TA505 deployed malware targeting POS terminals (PoS systems), belonging to FIN7._\n\n18Russian-speaking cybercriminal group specialising in compromising ATMs for fraudulent cash withdrawals [38].\n\n20/08/2020 Page 13 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n### 4 Conclusion\n\nDespite the scale of its activity as an affiliate of Dridex and Locky, TA505 was only identified as such in 2017, at\nthe same time as its first uses of backdoors.\n\nOften mistaken for the Evil Corp cybercriminal group (operating the Dridex botnet and BitPaymer ransomware),\nand sometimes considered to be the operator of the Necurs botnet, TA505 uses a scalable attack arsenal which it\nimplements in varied and sometimes simultaneous campaigns, casting confusion over its motives. As such, the ties\nit has with Lazarus and Silence suggest that TA505 conducts parallel campaigns for its own behalf and campaigns\nfor its clients.\n\nThe scale of its campaigns since 2019 and its targeting of several sectors in France, make this intrusion set a threat\nof special concern in 2020.\n\n20/08/2020 Page 14 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n### 5 Appendix: the Necurs botnet\n\n#### 5.1 Return of the Necurs botnet\n\nThe Necurs botnet (alias CraP2P) first appeared in 2011 [43].\n\nTwo known botnet modules are:\n\n  - spam, used for example:\n\n**– during pump and dump campaigns (especially relating to cryptoassets) as in March 2017;**\n\n**– in 2018, when Necurs acquired a new module .NET spamming [44]);**\n\n**– between 2016 and 2017, when Necurs propagated the Kegotip banking Trojan through The Uprate**\n**loader and The Rockloader[19], (Loader used to recover email addresses available in hard disks and to**\nuse them in future spam campaigns [46];\n\n**– after the dismantling of the Kelihos botnet in 2017, when Necurs was thought to have retrieved some of**\nits business, in particular consisting of dating spam.\n\n  - proxy/DDoS (addition of the DoS module in February 2017) [3].\n\nThe Necurs botnet communicates with its operators in different ways [47]:\n\n  - Its main communication network consists of a list of IP addresses and static hard-coded domains in the sampling of Necurs malware;\n\n  - If this method is not capable of obtaining an active C2, Necurs uses its domain generation algorithm (DGA):\nthe main DGA produces 2048 C2 domains every 4 days. When Necurs operators record a DGA domain to\ninform bots of the existence of a new C2, the domain does not indicate the real IP address of the C2. This IP\naddress is obfuscated with an encryption algorithm. All the domains are tried out until one of them matches\nand replies using the right protocol;\n\n  - If this method also fails, the C2 domain is recovered on the P2P network.\n\nFurthermore, the C2 infrastructure is divided into three levels. The last is the C2 backend. In this way, an infected\nsystem communicates with at least two layers of the C2 proxy when it is trying to communicate with the C2 backend.\nThe first C2 layer consists of cheap private virtual servers located in countries like Russia or the Ukraine whereas\nthe second layer is usually hosted in Europe, sometimes Russia. There are thought to be 11 Necurs botnets, i.e. 11\n_C2 backends, tightly controlled by one single group [4]. Four of these botnets represent 95% of all infections [47,_\n48].\n\n#### 5.2 Massive distribution by Necurs\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, Necurs was the most frequently used method to deliver spams and malware for cybercriminals,\nand responsible for 90% of malware distributed by email worldwide. 1 million systems were infected in 2016 rising\nto 9 million on 10 March 2020 [48].\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, Necurs mainly distributed Locky, Jaff (copy cat of Locky, GlobeImposter, Philadelphia,\n**Lukitus and Ykcol (variants of Locky) and Scarab ransomware, as well as Dridex and TrickBot banking Trojans.**\n\nAs of August 2018, Necurs started to roll out phishing campaigns targeting financial institutions, while continuing\nits massive propagation of (FlawedAmmyy, Quant Loader, AZOrult, ServHelper) malware, a majority of which\nbelongs to TA505’s arsenal.\n\nIn 2020, Necurs lost clients to Emotet, which replaced it in the distribution of Dridex and TrickBot [49], and distributed massive get-rich-quick spam campaigns. Its daily infections are mainly located in India, Indonesia, Iran,\n\n19Loader used during compromises to propagate Locky, Dridex 220, Pony and Kegotip ransomware [45].\n\n20/08/2020 Page 15 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\nMexico, Turkey, Vietnam and Thailand. 4892 infections have been located in France. [47, 48].\n\nTA505 is thought to have massively distributed malware via the Necurs botnet, to such an extent that it is possible\nthat the group actually operates this botnet, or at least is very closely tied to its real operator.\n\n_Comment: although it is possible that TA505 and the operator of the Necurs botnet have been mistaken for each other,_\n_it appears that the open-source tends to attribute all campaigns propagated by Necurs to TA505 through to at least late_\n_2017 (pump-and-dump spam campaigns and other frauds being excluded), whereas it is a gigantic botnet probably used_\n_by cybercriminal groups other than TA505. Indeed, users of remote-controlled botnets, are often capable of renting out_\n_access to segments of their botnet on the black market to send DDoS, span campaigns etc._\n\n20/08/2020 Page 16 of 20\n\n\n-----\n\nDevelopment of the activity of the TA505 cybercriminal group\n\n### 6 Bibliography\n\n[1] [Proofpoint.
