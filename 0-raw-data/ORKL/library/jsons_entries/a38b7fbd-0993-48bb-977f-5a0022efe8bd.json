The article is brief, but**\n**states that \"This is – by far – the most serious information security incident we have**\n**_seen in Poland\" followed by a claim that over 20 commercial banks had been_**\n**confirmed as victims.**\n\n**This report provides an outline of the attacks based on what was shared in the article,**\n**and our own additional findings.**\n\n#### ANALYSIS\n\n**As stated in the blog, the attacks are suspected of originating from the website of the**\n**Polish Financial Supervision Authority (knf.gov[.]pl), shown below:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**From at least 2016-10-07 to late January the website code had been modified to**\n**cause visitors to download malicious JavaScript files from the following locations:**\n\n\n**hxxp://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp?pagenum=1**\n**hxxps://www.eye-watch[.]in/design/fancybox/Pnf.action**\n\n\n**Both of these appear to be compromised domains given they are also hosting**\n**legitimate content and have done for some time. The malicious JavaScript leads to**\n**the download of malware to the victim’s device.**\n\n**Some hashes of the backdoor have been provided in BadCyber's technical analysis:**\n\n\n**85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b**\n**c1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c**\n**1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae**\n\n\n**The C&Cs given in the BadCyber analysis were the following IP addresses:**\n\n\n**125.214.195.17**\n**196.29.166.218**\n\n\n#### LAZARUS MALWARE\n\n**Only one of the samples referenced by BadCyber is available in public malware**\n**repositories. At the moment we cannot verify that it originated from the watering-hole**\n**on the KNF website – but we have no reason to doubt this either.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b [gp]** **(736**\n\n**e**\n**KB)**\n\n\n**26**\n**07:46:24**\n\n\n**PL**\n\n\n**The file is packed with a commercial packer known as** **_['Enigma Protector'. Once](http://enigmaprotector.com/en/about.html)_**\n**unpacked it drops a known malware variant, which has been seen as part of the**\n**Lazarus group’s toolkit in other cases over the past year.**\n\n**The unpacked executable takes several command line arguments:**\n\n\n**-l: list service names, available for its own registration**\n**-o: open specified event**\n**-t: set specified event**\n**-x [PASSWORD] -e [SERVICE_NAME]: drop/install DLL under specified**\n\n**[SERVICE_NAME]**\n**-x [PASSWORD] -f [SERVICE_NAME]: recreate the keys that keep the**\n**password for the next stage DLL, under the specified [SERVICE_NAME]**\n\n\n**The provided password's MD5 hash is used as an RC4 password. On top of that,**\n**there is one more RC4-round, using a hard coded 32-byte RC4 password:**\n\n\n**53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70**\n**77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B 13 D7 B3 9F 15**\n\n\n**Once the data is decrypted with two RC4 rounds, the dropper checks the decrypted**\n**data contains a valid 4-byte signature: 0xBC0F1DAD.**\n\n#### WATERING HOLE ANALYSIS\n\n**The attacker content on the compromised sap.misapor[.]ch site was not**\n**accessible at the time of writing.

These**\n**leverage Silverlight and Flash exploits to deliver malware.**\n\n**•  Investigators in Poland have identified known Lazarus group implants on bank**\n**networks and associated this with the recent compromise of the Polish Financial**\n**Supervision Authority's website.**\n\n**The technical/forensic evidence to link the Lazarus group actors (who we believe are**\n**behind the Bangladesh Bank attack and many others in 2016) to the watering-hole**\n**activity is unclear. However, the choice of bank supervisor / state-bank websites**\n**would be apt, given their previous targeting of Central Banks for Heists – even when it**\n**serves little operational benefit for infiltrating the wider banking sector.**\n\n**Nonetheless, further evidence to connect together the pieces of this attack is needed,**\n**as well as insights into the end-goal of the culprits. We are continuing our analysis of**\n**new artefacts as they emerge and may issue further updates in due course.**\n\n#### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**We recommend organisations use the indicators provided in Appendix A to update**\n**their defensive systems to identify attacks. For compromised legitimate websites we**\n**would suggest a minimum 1 month block be placed on the domain.
