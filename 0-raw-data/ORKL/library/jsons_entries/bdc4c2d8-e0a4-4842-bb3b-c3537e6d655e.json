These attacks used the vulnerability,\ntracked as [CVE-2021-40444, as part of an initial access campaign that distributed custom](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444)\nCobalt Strike Beacon loaders. These loaders communicated with an infrastructure that\nMicrosoft associates with multiple cybercriminal campaigns, including human-operated\nransomware.\n\nThe observed attack vector relies on a malicious ActiveX control that could be loaded by the\nbrowser rendering engine using a malicious Office document. Customers who enabled attack\nsurface reduction rules to block Office from creating child processes are not impacted by the\nexploitation technique used in these attacks. While these attacks used a vulnerability to\naccess entry point devices and run highly-privileged code, the secondary actions taken by\nthe attackers still rely on stealing credentials and moving laterally to cause organization-wide\nimpact. This illustrates the importance of investing in attack surface reduction, credential\nhygiene, and lateral movement mitigations. Customers are advised to apply the security\npatch for CVE-2021-40444 to fully mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis blog details our in-depth analysis of the attacks that used the CVE-2021-40444,\n[provides detection details and investigation guidance for Microsoft 365 Defender customers,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/microsoft-365-defender)\nand lists mitigation steps for hardening networks against this and similar attacks. Our\n[colleagues at RiskIQ conducted their own analysis and coordinated with Microsoft in](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/wizard-spider-windows-0day-exploit/)\npublishing this research.\n\n## Exploit delivery mechanism\n\nThe initial campaigns in August 2021 likely originated from emails impersonating contracts\nand legal agreements, where the documents themselves were hosted on file-sharing sites.\nThe exploit document used an external oleObject relationship to embed exploitative\nJavaScript within MIME HTML remotely hosted content that results in (1) the download of a\nCAB file containing a DLL bearing an INF file extension, (2) decompression of that CAB file,\nand (3) execution of a function within that DLL. The DLL retrieves remotely hosted shellcode\n(in this instance, a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader) and loads it into wabmig.exe\n(Microsoft address import tool.)\n\n_Figure 1. The original exploit vector: an externally targeted oleObject relationship definition_\n_bearing an MHTML handler prefix pointed at an HTML file hosted on infrastructure that has_\n_similar qualities to the Cobalt Strike Beacon infrastructure that the loader’s payload_\n_communicates with._\n\nContent that is downloaded from an external source is tagged by the Windows operating\nsystem with a mark of the web, indicating it was downloaded from a potentially untrusted\nsource. This invokes Protected Mode in Microsoft Office, requiring user interaction to disable\nit to run content such as macros. However, in this instance, when opened without a mark of\nthe web present, the document’s payload executed immediately without user interaction –\nindicating the abuse of a vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Attack chain of DEV-0413 campaign that used CVE-2021-40444_\n\n## DEV-0413 observed exploiting CVE-2021-40444\n\nAs part of Microsoft’s ongoing commitment to tracking both nation state and cybercriminal\nthreat actors, we refer to the unidentified threat actor as a “development group” and utilize a\nthreat actor naming structure with a prefix of “DEV” to indicate an emerging threat group or\nunique activity during the tracking and investigation phases before MSTIC reaches high\nconfidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind an operation. MSTIC tracks a large\ncluster of cybercriminal activity involving Cobalt Strike infrastructure under the name DEV0365.\n\nThe infrastructure we associate with DEV-0365 has several overlaps in behavior and unique\nidentifying characteristics of Cobalt Strike infrastructure that suggest it was created or\nmanaged by a distinct set of operators. However, the follow-on activity from this\ninfrastructure indicates multiple threat actors or clusters associated with human-operated\nransomware attacks (including the deployment of Conti ransomware). One explanation is\nthat DEV-0365 is involved in a form of command- and-control infrastructure as a service for\ncybercriminals.\n\nAdditionally, some of the infrastructure that hosted the oleObjects utilized in the August 2021\nattacks abusing CVE-2021-40444 were also involved in the delivery of BazaLoader and\nTrickbot payloads — activity that overlaps with a group Microsoft tracks as DEV-0193. DEV0193 activities overlap with actions tracked by Mandiant as UNC1878.\n\nDue to the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the shared qualities of DEV-0365\ninfrastructure and the significant variation in malicious activity, MSTIC clustered the initial\nemail campaign exploitation identified as CVE-2021-40444 activity separately, under DEV0413.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DEV-0413 campaign that used CVE-2021-40444 has been smaller and more targeted\nthan other malware campaigns we have identified leveraging DEV-0365 infrastructure. We\nobserved the earliest exploitation attempt of this campaign on August 18. The social\nengineering lure used in the campaign, initially highlighted by Mandiant, aligned with the\nbusiness operations of targeted organizations, suggesting a degree of purposeful targeting.\nThe campaign purported to seek a developer for a mobile application, with multiple\napplication development organizations being targeted. In most instances, file-sharing\nservices were abused to deliver the CVE-2021-40444-laden lure.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that while monitoring the DEV-0413 campaign, Microsoft identified\nactive DEV-0413 infrastructure hosting CVE-2021-40444 content wherein basic security\nprinciples had not been applied. DEV-0413 did not limit the browser agents able to access\nthe server to their malware implant or known targets, thereby permitting directory listing for\ntheir web server. In doing so, the attackers exposed their exploit to anyone who might have\ngained interest based on public social media discussion.\n\n_Figure 3. Content of the original DEV-0413 email lure seeking application developers_\n\n\n-----\n\nAt least one organization that was successfully compromised by DEV-0413 in their August\ncampaign was previously compromised by a wave of similarly-themed malware that\ninteracted with DEV-0365 infrastructure almost two months before the CVE-2021-40444\nattack. It is currently not known whether the retargeting of this organization was intentional,\nbut it reinforces the connection between DEV-0413 and DEV-0365 beyond sharing of\ninfrastructure.\n\nIn a later wave of DEV-0413 activity on September 1, Microsoft identified a lure change from\ntargeting application developers to a “small claims court” legal threat.\n\n_Figure 4. Example of the “Small claims court” lure utilized by DEV-0413_\n\n## Vulnerability usage timeline\n\nOn August 21, 2021, MSTIC observed a social media post by a Mandiant employee with\nexperience tracking Cobalt Strike Beacon infrastructure. This post highlighted a Microsoft\nWord document (SHA-256:\n[3bddb2e1a85a9e06b9f9021ad301fdcde33e197225ae1676b8c6d0b416193ecf) that had](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3bddb2e1a85a9e06b9f9021ad301fdcde33e197225ae1676b8c6d0b416193ecf)\n\n\n-----\n\nbeen uploaded to VirusTotal on August 19, 2021. The post s focus on this document was\nhighlighting the custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader and did not focus on the delivery\nmechanism.\n\nMSTIC analyzed the sample and determined that an anomalous oleObject relationship in the\ndocument was targeted at an external malicious HTML resource with an MHTML handler\nand likely leading to abuse of an undisclosed vulnerability. MSTIC immediately engaged the\nMicrosoft Security Response Center and work began on a mitigation and patch. During this\nprocess, MSTIC collaborated with the original finder at Mandiant to reduce the discussion of\nthe issue publicly and avoid drawing threat actor attention to the issues until a patch was\navailable. Mandiant partnered with MSTIC and did their own reverse engineering\nassessment and submitted their findings to MSRC.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Microsoft released a security advisory for CVE-2021-40444\ncontaining a partial workaround. As a routine in these instances, Microsoft was working to\nensure that the detections described in the advisory would be in place and a patch would be\navailable before public disclosure. During the same time, a third-party researcher reported a\nsample to Microsoft from the same campaign originally shared by Mandiant. This sample\nwas publicly disclosed on September 8. We observed a rise in exploitation attempts within 24\nhours.\n\n_Figure 5. Graphic showing original exploitation on August 18 and attempted exploitation_\n_increasing after public disclosure_\n\nMicrosoft continues to monitor the situation and work to deconflict testing from actual\nexploitation. Since the public disclosure, Microsoft has observed multiple threat actors,\nincluding ransomware-as-a-service affiliates, adopting publicly disclosed proof-of-concept\ncode into their toolkits. We will continue to provide updates as we learn more.\n\n## Mitigating the attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n[Microsoft has confirmed that the following attack surface reduction rule blocks activity](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction)\nassociated with exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 at the time of publishing:\n\nBlock all Office applications from creating child processes\n\nApply the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat and follow-on actions taken\nby attackers.\n\n[Apply the security updates for CVE-2021-40444.
