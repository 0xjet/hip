It shows a cartoon\nwith the text: “Hey look Russians” and “Putin did it!”\n\nThe opaque message itself did not help FireEye find the breach, but rather arrived in the\nearly stages of its investigation. This has led people familiar with the matter to believe the\nsender was attempting to “troll” or push the company off the trail by intimidating a senior\nexecutive.\n\nReuters could not determine who sent the postcard. U.S. law enforcement and intelligence\nagencies are spearheading the probe into its origin, the sources familiar said.\n\nThe FBI did not provide comment. A FireEye representative declined to discuss the postcard.\n\nA disinformation researcher from the Rand Corporation, Todd Helmus, received a similar\npostcard in 2019, based on an image of it Helmus posted to Twitter. Helmus, who studies\ndigital propaganda, said he received the postcard after testifying to Congress about Russian\ndisinformation tactics.\n\nFireEye discovered the Russian hacking campaign - now known as “Solorigate” for how it\nleveraged supply chain vulnerabilities in network management firm Solarwinds - because of\nan anomalous device login from within FireEye’s network. The odd login triggered a security\nalert and subsequent investigation, which led to the discovery of the operation.\n\nFireEye worked closely with Microsoft to determine that the infiltration at FireEye in fact\nrepresented a hacking campaign that struck at least eight federal agencies including the\nTreasury, State and Commerce Departments.\n\nWhen the postcard was sent, FireEye had not yet determined who was behind the\ncyberattack. A person familiar with the postcard investigation said “this is not typically the\nRussian SVR’s playbook” but “times are rapidly changing.” SVR is an acronym for the\nForeign Intelligence Service of Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nA former U.S. intelligence official said the postcard reminded him of a now public mission by\nU.S. Cyber Command where they sent private messages to Russian hackers ahead of the\n2018 congressional elections in the United States.\n\n“The message then from the U.S. was ‘watch your back, we see you’ similar to here,” the\nformer official said.\n\nThe extent of the damages tied to the U.S. government hack remains unclear. Emails\nbelonging to senior officials were stolen from an unclassified network at the Treasury and\nCommerce Departments.\n\nReporting by Christopher Bing; editing by Grant McCool\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
