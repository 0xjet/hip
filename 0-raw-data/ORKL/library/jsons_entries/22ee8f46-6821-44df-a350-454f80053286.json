As part of this work, DomainTools researchers identified two domains spoofing](https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1327643587706810376)\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) in late October and early November 2020:\n```\n European-who[.]com\n Health-world-org[.]com\n\n```\nBoth domains redirected to legitimate WHO-resources when accessed: european-who to\nthe European WHO website (euro.who.int), and health-world-org to the primary WHO\nwebsite (who.int). While their creation may be concerning, initial views indicate little of\nsignificance to either item.\n\nFurther analysis shows an interesting detail. While the domains both redirect to legitimate\nresources for HTTP communication, the European domain features an MX record mapped\nto dedicated infrastructure completely unrelated to WHO, shown in the following\nDomainTools Iris screenshot:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe server, located in Lithuania and provided by Informacines Sistemos IR Technologijos\nUAB, was uniquely associated with the “european-who” domain in October and November\n2020.\n\nIn this case, we observe a domain with no noticeable or significant HTTP functionality, but\nwhich does feature an MX record. This would indicate the domain may be used for sending\nemail even if it is not used for command and control (C2) or similar functionality. To further\nrefine this item, a search of phishing data and campaigns is required.\n\n## Identifying a Phishing Payload\n\nWorking with several partner security companies, DomainTools identified suspicious emails,\nmasquerading as a WHO report and survey email, sent in late October and early November\n2020. The emails contained an attachment, “WHO_Report_11-17.jnlp.” JNLP extensions\nrefer to the [Java Network Launching Protocol, used to identify a remote Java program (in](https://fileinfo.com/extension/jnlp)\nJava Archive, or JAR, format) and an initial class to run when launched.\n\nThe observed JNLP object has the following content:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile referring to the legitimate WHO website, the JNLP payload retrieves a JAR,\n“WHO_Report.jar,” from the previously-observed domain, “health-world-org”, and executes\nthe “WHO_Report” class within the JAR. Although navigating to “health-world-org,” results\nin a redirect to the main WHO website, specifying the above resource downloads the JAR.\n\nThe JAR has the following characteristics:\n```\nWHO_Report.jar\nMD5: 2dc6f3972a95bd3091db90d9c24606b3\nSHA1: 8fe66769399c11f32d2c18b99e4bdad6dbfe4d5d\nSHA256: 98beba8a22b5f579b89cac0a1a35a254ae81488fb549481506f20983e720c5b1\n\n```\nReviewing the JAR, it creates two objects, an executable and a decoy document:\n\nThe document is a legitimate, benign report on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic authored\nby WHO which is used to distract the victim while in the background the executable\nlaunches.\n\n## Malware Functionality\n\n\n-----\n\nThe executable referenced above represents the primary payload for initial execution.\nReviewing the JAR file, the program retrieves it from a new location, “office-pulgin[.]com,”\nand executes it through a call to another function, “frisco415,” shown below. Interestingly,\nthe US telephone area code for San Francisco, often referred to as “Frisco,” is 415.\n\nThe retrieved executable has the following characteristics:\n```\nOffice.exe\nMD5: 738d16d1feadd8eb8e88149201179cb6\nSHA1: 0b32961bedc84134dabeceab4c3d248afa6d5ba9\nSHA256: 05d3a35cacf882e34b8433037ad7a9b292fcb2b08439823e4724add4ceacb665\n\n```\nAlso of note, the “office-pulgin” domain is hosted on the same Autonomous System Number\n(ASN) as “european-who” (ASN 61272) at 88.119.170[.]2.\n\n[When launched, the malware performs a request to the IPify service (ipify.org) to determine](https://www.ipify.org/)\nthe victim’s IP address:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe response is stored in a text file with an image extension at the following location:\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\kaosdma.png\n\n```\nThe malware then attempts to enumerate processes on the running system, access\ndirectories typically associated with cached or saved credentials for web browsers, and\naccess the system hosts file. Once complete the malware attempts to communicate to\nanother domain, “adverting-cdn[.]com” located at 213.252.246[.]23. This IP address is in the\nsame ASN as all other observed items.\n\nAbsent a successful connection with the resource above, observable malware functionality\nceases. DomainTools was unable to identify any further activity for the sample in question.\nBased on observed behaviors, DomainTools assesses with medium confidence that the\n“adverting-cdn” domain serves as an exfiltration point for data harvested from the victim\nmachine.\n\nThe overall sequence of events and malware functionality is summarized in the following\ndiagram:\n\n## Purpose and Attribution\n\nAt first glance, the activity identified above appears focused on WHO-related entities and\nfeatures significant efforts to masquerade as legitimate WHO services. Such a level of detail\nand focus typically indicates narrow targeting and significant investment in lures and\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure to ensure campaign success. This would imply specific targeting on WHOrelated entities or other healthcare organizations, potentially for purposes such as statedirected espionage.\n\nHowever, overall malware functionality as observed above is not especially interesting and\nappears to be a type of common information stealer. While concerning, such malware is in\nwidespread use and often features as part of criminal campaigns designed to harvest\nfinancial-related logons or enable ransomware incidents. Furthermore, a review of\nfunctionality—such as dropping a text file named “kaosdma.png” and contacting “advertingcdn”—identified over a dozen similar samples in several commercial malware repositories.\n\nNone of the additional malware samples identified through the query above show any\nobvious relationship to the WHO-focused activity or possess identifiers indicating similar\nlevels of targeting specificity. However, malware families referenced in identified detections\n[include items such as AZORULT and](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000146108-azorult-malware-information-kAJ4P000000kEK2WAM) [Glupteba. Although “commodity” in the sense that](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/06/24/glupteba-report/)\nthese are available in criminal markets for purchase, this very fact of accessibility to multiple\nparties means such malware could be employed by any entity willing to pay.\nSeveral possibilities emerge if we engage in an abbreviated analysis of competing\n[hypotheses based on observations from this campaign:](http://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art11.html)\n\nUse of JNLP files as initial payloads leading to follow-on code execution and file\nretrieval.\nFurther use of JAR files loading both a malicious executable and a decoy document to\nevade user detection.\nDeployment of likely commodity malware, such as an AZORULT variant, but which is\nalso available for purchase in underground or criminal networks.\nRelatively brief (late October through mid-November) but very focused campaign\ncharacteristics given specific spoofing of WHO-related activity.\nWHO-specific infrastructure, as well as “office-pulgin” and their hosting servers, are\nonly identified in relation to this campaign.\n\nOther, final-stage campaign infrastructure—notably the “adverting-cdn” domain—is common\nacross multiple incidents none of which appear related to the WHO or similar entities.\n\nFrom these observations, three general hypotheses emerge:\n\n1. The activity in question recycles existing criminal techniques and behaviors for\n\nmonetization (through credential theft or potential preparation for ransomware\ninfection) of healthcare and related sector targets.\n2. The activity represents an immature intelligence-directed entity leveraging “off-the\nshelf,” purchasable tools to facilitate operations for unknown espionage purposes.\n3. The identified campaign is the work of a savvy state-directed operator deliberately\n\nutilizing a combination of commodity tooling with specific targeting to evade analysis\nand attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, insufficient evidence exists from the current campaign, which emphasizes\nany of the three possibilities above. DomainTools cannot, with currently available\ninformation, associate the activity described with any known, tracked entity at this time.\nDomainTools will continue to monitor this activity and provide updates as they are available.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen a new domain is created, its functionality may not be readily apparent. Even if a\ndomain does not resolve to a webpage or resource, or simply forwards HTTP traffic to a\nlegitimate site, it may still retain functionality using other services and protocols. As\nobserved in this activity, a suspicious domain yielded indicators of likely phishing activity\neven though the domain appeared inactive. Further investigation with partner organizations\nyielded additional information that uncovered activity mimicking the WHO during a\nworldwide health crisis. Although this campaign cannot be linked to any specific, known\nthreat at this time, the activity in question is very interesting from the standpoint of technical\nanalysis, and shows the merits of dogged research and analysis of suspicious network\nindicators.\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Network Indicators\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created** **Registrar** **Registrant Email**\n\n\n**adverting-**\n**cdn[.]com**\n\n\n**29 Oct**\n**2020**\n\n\n**PDR LTD.
