The attackers used several attack vectors and tools to deliver the\n\n malware. \n\n It was also discovered that in early 2020, before distributing the Raccoon stealer, the\n\n attackers had distributed samples of another stealer called Vidar. To do so, they used\n\n attachments with malicious macros and phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus\n\n phishing kit.\n\n\n-----\n\nmalicious campaigns of\n\nhacker group\nFakeSecurity\n\n\n-----\n\nof FakeSecurity's\nmalicious campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n#### First wave\n\n###### The first wave of domain registrations began in the co.za zone on February 19, 2020.

After activating the macros in this\n\n document, a file was downloaded from http://cloud-server\n updater22[.]co.za/doc/officebuilder. This file with SHA1:\n\n 3657CF5F2142C7E30F72E231E87518B82710DC1C is a Raccoon stealer. It connects to\n\n the C&C server (35.228.95[.]80) to exfiltrate the collected information, using Google's\n\n infrastructure to legitimize requests. In turn, Raccoon makes a network connection to\n\n http://cloud-server-updater1[.]co.za/doc/officeupdate.exe and downloads RAT AveMaria\n\n (SHA1: a10925364347bde843a1d4105dddf4a4eb88c746), with the C&C server located\n\n at the IP address 102.130.118[.]152.\n\n AveMaria is a RAT, which was discovered by cybersecurity researchers in late 2018, when\n\n it was used to attack an Italian oil and gas company. The RAT is capable of:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ensuring persistence in the infected system\n\n Injecting code\n\n Keylogging\n\n Gaining access to web camera\n\n Managing processes\n\n Managing files (creation, download, exfiltration, deletion)\n\n RDP using rdpwrap\n\n Info-stealer support:\n\n - Google Chrome\n\n - Firefox\n\n - Internet Explorer\n\n - Outlook\n\n - Thunderbird\n\n - Foxmail\n\n When running, Raccoon makes the following network requests: \n\n\n6685955C5F006C2D\n83A92952EB5EB3FB\n9598C783 execution\nsequence\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Among these network requests, there is a connection to the blintick Telegram channel.\n\n Telegram was used by Raccoon's creators to bypass blocking of the C&C servers. To this\n\n end, the stealer makes a request to the Telegram channel and receives the encrypted\n\n address of the new C&C server from the description. The first samples using this\n\n technique began appearing on VirusTotal in late May 2020. \n\n\nF72E231E87518B827\n10DC1C network\nrequests\n\nMessages from the\ndesigners of the\nRaccoon stealer\n\n\n-----\n\nblintick Telegram\nchannel and its\ndescription\n\n\n###### Although the Raccoon stealer is distributed according to the MaaS model, all files\n\n distributed during the second wave accessed the same Telegram channel. This suggests\n\n that documents with malicious macros downloading Raccoon were distributed by the\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### The lure documents used as part of this wave look identical to the previous ones. Judging\n\n by their behavior after macros are activated, they were created by the same builder. Such\n\n builders make it possible to create office documents with malicious macros based on\n\n templates, which helps attackers distribute malicious files much faster and more efficiently.\n\n\nFile connections with\ndomains involved in\ntwo waves established\nwith the help of GroupIB Graph Network\nAnalysis\n\n618C894C06633E3D7\nADD228531F6E775A1\n80A7F7 lure document\nsample\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Upon activating macros, the file \"My_Statement_1953.xlsm\" (SHA1:\n\n 618C894C06633E3D7ADD228531F6E775A180A7F7) sends a request to download the\n\n stealer file http://microsoft-cloud13[.]co.za/msofficeupdate.exe. The Raccoon stealer file\n\n (SHA1: 6639081791A8909F042E4A4197DF7051382B04E5) makes a series of requests\n\n to its C&C server (35.198.88[.]195) and tries to download the file http://cloud-server\n updater1[.]co.za/doc/officeupdate.exe, but receives an \"error 302\" and is redirected to\n\n http://cloud-server-updater1[.]co.za/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi because the original\n\n domain is blocked.

Past attacks targeted owners of\n\n online stores powered by Magento CMS. In the campaign described previously, the\n\n attackers also used such tools as the Vidar stealer and the Mephistophilus phishing kit,\n\n with an identical template for Adobe updates. In addition, the attackers used the same\n\n hosting service to register domains in both campaigns. \n\n In the 2020 campaign, the same attack vector was used and involved subsequent\n\n\n-----\n\n###### several online stores from bezco.quise1988@wp.pl and outtia.lene1985@wp.pl. \n\n A detailed analysis of the first-wave malware distribution via Mephistophilus phishing\n\n pages revealed a link between the domains involved in this campaign (in particular\n\n documents-cloud-server*[.]co.za) and the FakeSecurity campaign. During the 2020\n\n campaign, phishing pages were available at the following URLs: \n\n\nList of domains with an\nidentical structure\n\n\n###### According to urlscan[.]io, more than 20 sites with a similar structure were discovered, but\n\n the one that stands out is alloaypparel[.]com. It was used in the FakeSecurity campaign. \n\n Since March 2020, Group-IB specialists have started detecting online store infections with\n\n a JS sniffer obfuscated by the aaencode algorithm (https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html).\n\n The malware was loaded from get-js[.]com. WHOIS records similar to those used\n\n previously by this group were located at get-js[.]com: \n\n ● fiswedbesign[.]com \n\n ● alloaypparel[.]com\n\n ● firstofbanks[.]com \n\n ● magento-security[.]org \n\n it [ ]\n\n\n-----\n\nConnection between\nFakeSecutiry\ninfrastructure during\nthe 2019 campaign\nand the domain getjs[.]com built with the\nhelp of Group-IB Graph\nNetwork Analysis\n\nPart of JS-sniffer code\nobfuscated with\naaencode\n\n\n-----\n\n###### After deobfuscating it, Group-IB established that the malware used for infections was a\n\n modified version of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer. Its distribution was analyzed in November\n\n 2019. \n\n\nDeobfuscated code of\nthe FakeSecurity JSsniffer modified version\n\n\n###### In May 2020, Group-IB discovered new infected online stores. Once again, the attackers\n\n used a modified FakeSecurity JS-sniffer obfuscated with aaencode. The malware was\n\n injected either by a link using a script tag or by modifying existing JavaScript files on the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### September 2020. The following domains were used to store the code and collect stolen\n\n bank card data during the new campaign: \n\n • cloud-js[.]co.za \n\n • host-js[.]co.za \n\n • magento-cloud[.]co.za \n\n • magento-js[.]co.za \n\n • magento-security[.]co.za \n\n • marketplace-magento[.]co.za \n\n • marketplacemagento[.]co.za \n\n • node-js[.]co.za \n\n • node-js[.]co.za \n\n • payment-js[.]co.za \n\n • security-js[.]co.za \n\n • web-js[.]co.za \n\n Created on April 24, 2020 (during the second wave), these domains were registered with\n\n the same registrars as those used to distribute the Vidar and Raccoon stealers and the\n\n Buer and Smoke loaders. \n\n The format of the links to the JS-sniffer files combined with the malware family type\n\n suggest that FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators are behind the campaign to infect online\n\n stores. \n\n In addition, some domains involved in the campaign under investigation hosted a parked\n\n page labeled \"test page\", like the one hosted on FakeSecurity domains: \n\n • https://urlscan.io/result/0299b3e5-cbba-40be-adce-7ba437e4cb39/ microsoft\n cloud10[.]co.za \n\n • https://urlscan.io/result/8f244d1b-2186-4db5-9c52-6122584dafa9/ - documents\n cloud-server[.]co.za\n\n\n-----\n\nparked pages on JSsniffer FakeSecurity's\ngate and domains in\nco.za zone\n\n\n###### The evidence found indicates that the operators of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer family are\n\n likely to be behind the multi-stage malicious campaign described above. According to our\n\n information, even though the group gains initial access using non-self-developed tools\n\n sold or rented on darknet forums, it continues to operate its exclusive JS-sniffer. \n\n Recommendations\n\n Below you can see attackers' TTPs and relevant mitigation and defense techniques in\n\n\n-----\n\n###### against and prevent cyberattacks. \n\n All the mitigation and defense techniques are implemented in Group-IB's products\n\n intended for the protection against cyberattacks at early stages.
