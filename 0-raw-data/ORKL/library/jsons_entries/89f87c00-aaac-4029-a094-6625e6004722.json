The vulnerability (CVE-2018-5002) allows for a maliciously crafted Flash object to\n\nexecute code on victim computers, which enables an attacker to execute a range of\n\npayloads and actions.\n\nThis blog will outline details on various aspects of the discovered attack, the potential\n\ntargeting of Qatar, and suggestions for defenses against similar attack chains. It is our goal\n\nthat by sharing this, defensive teams will be informed about recently discovered threat\n\nactivity and more broadly understand the type of indicators that can assist in identification\n\nof similar attack vectors.\n\nICEBRG was the first to report the discovered vulnerability to Adobe, on June 1, 2018 at 4:14\n\nAM PDT. Adobe acted quickly to coordinate with ICEBRG, reproduce the vulnerability, and\n\n[distribute a patch for its software on June 7, 2018. Many thanks to the team for working with](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb18-19.html)\n\nus.\n\n## ATTACK OVERVIEW\n\nThe exploit uses a Microsoft Office document to download and execute an Adobe Flash\n\nexploit to victim computers. The exploitation process, detailed in Figure 1, begins by\n\ndownloading and executing a remote Shockwave Flash (SWF) file. Unlike most Flash\n\nexploits delivered with Microsoft Office, this document uses a lesser-known feature to\n\nremotely include all SWF content from the attacker’s server instead of embedding it\n\ndirectly in the document.\n\n\n-----\n\nstage, containing the actual exploit, which it downloads and executes. Appropriate use of\n\nasymmetric cryptography, like RSA, evades traditional defenses such as replay-based\n\nnetwork security devices and prevents a post-mortem network packet capture analysis.\n\nThe second SWF stage, after exploiting the system and achieving code execution, uses the\n\nsame cryptosystem to download and execute shellcode to further enable the threat actor\n\nto control the victim machine. Typically, the final payload consists of shellcode that\n\nprovides backdoor functionality to the system or stages additional tools. ICEBRG\n\nattempted to retrieve the final payload during analysis but was unable to due to several\n\npossible reasons.\n\nFigure 1: Walkthrough of exploitation process\n\n### REMOTE FLASH INCLUSION\n\nThe attack loads Adobe Flash Player from within Microsoft Office, which is a popular\n\napproach to Flash exploitation since Flash is disabled in many browsers. Attackers typically\n\nembed a Flash file within a document, which may contain the entire exploit, or may stage\n\nthe attack to download exploits and payloads more selectively (e.g. APT28/Sofacy\n\nDealersChoice). This leaves, at a minimum, a small Flash loader that defenders can flag for\n\ndetection and analysts can fingerprint for tracking.\n\nContrary to typical tactics, this attack uses a lesser-known feature that remotely includes\n\nthe Flash content instead of directly embedding it within the document (Figure 2). Only\n\nXML wrappers selecting the Flash Player ActiveX control and an OLE Object supplying\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Example Flash object included via “Movie” property which specifies remote\nlocation of Flash object. This is purely an example of how the initial object can be included.\n\nRemote loading of the embedded Flash object has multiple significant advantages:\n\nEvasion: The document by itself does not contain any malicious code. Statically, the\n\nbest one can do is detect the presence of remotely included Flash content.\n\nDynamically, the sandbox/simulator must interact with the attacker’s server and\n\nreceive malicious content, necessitating that the analysis system has a live\n\nconnection to the Internet. Further, the attacker may selectively serve the next stage\n\nbased upon the requesting IP address or HTTP headers (indicating a specific\n\ntargeted environment). Once access is established, the attacker may decommission\n\ntheir server and subsequent analysis of the attack must rely on leftover forensic\n\nartifacts.\n\nTargeting: Because the attacker can selectively serve exploits to the victim, they can\n\nlimit the attack to intended victims. The attacker can limit access to specific IP\n\naddresses, either through whitelisting networks of target companies or individuals\n\nvia a regional ISP, or blacklisting cloud infrastructure and security companies. The\n\n“Accept-Language” and “User-Agent” in HTTP headers may also be useful to\n\n\n-----\n\nwith non-standard or outdated responses. The ordering, inclusion, or absence of\n\nHTTP headers in general may also discriminate between security products, real\n\nvictims, and intended victims. Lastly, “x-flash-version” includes the version of Flash\n\nPlayer on the victim with which the attacker can choose their most effective exploit\n\nserver side.\n\nEven with a minimal static footprint, upon document load, the remote Flash object will be\n\nretrieved and executed within the context of Microsoft Office.\n\n### CRYPTOGRAPHIC ROUTINES\n\nData transmission from the attacker’s server to the client is protected by a custom\n\ncryptosystem (Figure 3) leveraging a symmetric cipher (AES), that protects the data\n\npayload and an asymmetric cipher (RSA) to protect the symmetric key. The custom\n\n[cryptosystem leverages a public Action Script library for low level operations.](https://github.com/timkurvers/as3-crypto/tree/master/src/com/hurlant/crypto)\n\nFigure 3: Generic network retrieval and decrypt routine\n\nData transmission is initiated by the client, whereby the client HTTP POSTs a randomly\n\ngenerated RSA modulus n and the exponent 0x10001, and the server responds with the\n\nfollowing structure:\n\n0x0: Encrypted AES key length (L)\n0x4: Encrypted AES key\n0x4+L: AES IV\n\n\n-----\n\ng yp\n\nTo decrypt the data payload, the client decrypts the encrypted AES key using its randomly\n\ngenerated private key, then decrypts the data payload with the decrypted AES key.\n\nThe extra layer of public key cryptography, with a randomly generated key, is crucial here.\n\nBy using it, one must either recover the randomly generated key or crack the RSA\n\nencryption to analyze subsequent layers of the attack. If implemented correctly, this\n\nrenders packet capture in forensic analysis and automated security products ineffective.\n\nFurthermore, the decrypted data payloads will only reside in memory, challenging\n\ntraditional disk forensics and non-volatile artifact analysis.\n\nIn this scenario, the attacker chose an RSA modulus length of 512 bits, which is considered\n\ninsecure by today’s standards and may be cracked with notable effort. Consequently,\n\noffline analysis is possible, although more laborious than online analysis, whereby the\n\nanalyst may either instrument a mock victim or create a man-in-the-middle service, then\n\nattempt to be exploited by the attacker.\n\nThe combination of a remotely included Flash exploit and asymmetric cryptography are\n\nparticularly powerful counters against postmortem analysis. Once exploited, the only\n\nartifact residing on the victim’s system would be the initial lure document that only contains\n\na URL. In that scenario, responders may look to network packet captures to recreate the\n\nattack. However, without the victim’s randomly created private key, it would be impossible\n\nfor responders to decrypt the attacker’s code and recover subsequent protected stages\n\nlike the exploit or payload. In this scenario, responders’ only saving grace would be the use\n\nof a weak RSA modulus.\n\n### USE OF ZERO-DAY EXPLOIT\n\nAfter decryption, the exploit payload is loaded and triggered to allow for follow-on code\n\nexecution. Although the document is a Microsoft Office document, the code is executing\n\nwithin an Adobe Flash container.\n\nYou might ask, why conduct Flash exploitation within Microsoft Office? Over the past\n\nseveral years, many browsers have hardened their attack surface in regard to external\n\nplugins and applications, including Adobe Flash. An example of this hardening can be seen\n\n[with Google’s Chrome Browser v.55, which outright blocks Flash by default. On the other](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/chrome-55-now-blocks-flash-uses-html5-by-default/)\n\nhand, Office still supports embedded ActiveX controls, including Flash. According to\n\n[Microsoft, this will be changing with its Office 365 products in 2019.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-block-flash-in-office-365/)\n\n\n-----\n\ncontext of the attack chain. A zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability for which there exists\n\nno patch, whereas an “N-Day” vulnerability is an attack that takes place “N” days after the\n\npatch is available. There are numerous benefits of leveraging a zero-day exploit against a\n\ntarget (Figure 5) .\n\nCode execution with minimal interaction: The vulnerabilities used in zero-day exploits\ntypically trigger with little or no user interaction other than opening the document.\nDue to patches and other protective mechanism, N-day exploits will frequently cause\na prompt, warning, popup or flat out will not work.\nHigher success rates with less risk of discovery: Due to the minimally required user\ninteraction, users do not get suspicious of the document as easily and therefore do\nnot report the situation to internal security teams. Most user training focuses on\ninforming users of all the built-in security prompts rather than analyzing the overall\nsuspicion of a scenario.\n\nFigure 5: Benefits of using a zero-day exploit\n\nOn the other hand, there are some negative aspects to using a zero-day vulnerability,\n\nnotably cost of operations and risk of additional investigation upon discovery. In 2015, leaks\n\nof conversations involving Hacking Team revealed that zero-day exploits for Adobe Flash\n\nwere being sold for $30k-$45k per exploit. Additionally, when the discovery of a zero-day\n\nhappens, investigators will tend to dive deeper than if they discovered use of an older N\nday exploit.\n\n### NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS\n\nDuring the attack, the weaponized document downloads the initial SWF stage and multiple\n\nblobs of encrypted data from the attacker’s server and provides basic system information\n\nto the same server, both over HTTP. All downloads contain a unique 32-byte parameter\n\nnamed 'token', which is reused in the URI paths of other URLs passed as Flash parameters.\n\nThe SWF stages log data to the URL identified as 'stabUrl', which is on the same command\nand-control server. The URI is constructed by appending a random value onto a format\n\nstring (Figure 6), whose values will indicate the current function, and progress within the\n\nfunction, that is transmitted to track successes and failures. For example, the value\n\nreported after successful retrieval of the first stage is '0-0-0'.\n\nstabUrl + “%d-%d-%d.png?x=”+ Math.random()\n\nFigure 6: Computation of the stabURL\n\n\n-----\n\nsecond stage SWF containing the exploit. Upon retrieval of the second stage, a request is\n\nthen made to the 'downloadUrl', which is the shellcode payload. The command-and\ncontrol server has not responded with a payload for the third-stage even when phoning\n\nhome from the assumed targeted region, which may signal that the campaign has been\n\nended. The second GET request to the stabUrl uses the values '2-0-1' to signify a\n\nsuccessful verification of a supported version of Windows. This is not significant for this\n\nexploit since it returns true for any version between and including Windows XP to Windows\n\n10. Examples of these network interactions can be seen in Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n\nFigure 7: Network Communication observed during analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Network trace of HTTP Requests\n\n## POSSIBLE QATARI TARGETING\n\nThe weaponized document (Figure 9), titled “�����ا ��ا��ا.xlsx” (translated to\n\n“basic_salary”), is an Arabic language themed document that purports to inform the target\n\nof employee salary adjustments. The document was uploaded from an IP address in Qatar\n\nto VirusTotal on May 31, 2018. Most of the job titles included in the document are diplomatic\n\nin nature, specifically referring to salaries with positions referencing secretaries,\n\nambassadors, diplomats, etc.\n\nFigure 9: Lure document in Arabic purporting to show salary modifications\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin the document, the threat actor utilizes the domain “dohabayt[.]com” for malicious\n\ncontent which also reveals additional clues as to the intended target. When broken down\n\ninto parts (Figure 10), the domain indicates a possible targeting of Qatar interests. The first\n\npart contains “doha”, which is the capital of Qatar. The second part also may be mimicking\n\nthe legitimate Middle Eastern job search site “bayt[.]com” in a further attempt to blend in\n\non the network.\n\nFigure 10: Attacker domain broken down into pieces\n\nICEBRG assesses with low confidence that these aspects indicate targeting of Qatari\n\nvictims based on geopolitical interests. Such focused targeting would not be surprising\n\ngiven the hotbed of regional instability due to an ongoing blockade of Qatar by a number\n\nof other Middle Eastern countries and recent allegations of Qatar using offensive\n\ncapabilities and contractors to target US political organizations.\n\nThis assessment should not be considered an attempt to aid or assess in true attribution of\n\nthe responsible party, but rather an attempt to provide relevant targeting information for\n\nanalysts to associate with a known activity group or campaign.\n\n## ATTACK INDICATORS\n\nNumerous atomic indicators (Figure 11) were identified through the attack chain of this\n\nactivity and might serve as an initial method of detection. Atomic indicators are generally\n\nweak indicators given their ease of modification within the attack scenario and should only\n\nbe used as preliminary indicators while more robust methods are instituted.\n\nIndicator Description\n\nSHA256 hash\n\n0b4f0d8d57fd1cb9b4408013aa7fe5986339ce66ad09c941e76626b5d872e0b5 of the\n\ndocument lure.\n\n185.145.128[.]57 IP Address of\n\n|Indicator|Description|\n|---|---|\n|0b4f0d8d57fd1cb9b4408013aa7fe5986339ce66ad09c941e76626b5d872e0b5|SHA256 hash of the document lure.|\n\n\n-----\n\nprovider\n\n(abelons[.]com)\n\nhosting\n\npayloads for\n\n|Col1|exploit chain.|\n|---|---|\n|people.dohabayt[.]com|Domain used for various stages of the exploit chain.|\n|6535abc68a777b82b8dca49ffbf2d80af7491e76020028a3e18186e1cad02abe|SHA256 of SSL certificate observed on malicious infrastructure. https://crt.sh/? id=482419008|\n|internationsplanet[.]com|Domain associated with SSL certificate observed on malicious infrastructure.|\n\n\nFigure 11: Table of atomic indicators\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Timeline of various dates associated with the involved indicators\n\nWhile this attack leveraged a zero-day exploit, individual attacker actions do not happen in\n\nisolation. There are several other behavioral aspects that can be used for detection. Any\n\nsingle observable might be low confidence but multiple observables clustered might be\n\nindicative of suspicious or malicious activity. Example observables include:\n\nUse of Newly Registered and Low Reputation Infrastructure: The domains utilized in\n\nthis attack chain are very recently registered domains (Figure 12) and leverage low\n\nreputation hosting providers and registars that commonly host malicious sites. The\n\nhosting provider Abelons has been repeatedly included on spamhaus and abused by\n\nattackers to deliver malicious content.\n\nStaged Download of Flash: During the attack chain, the weaponized document loads\n\nthe malicious Flash object through remote loading resulting in observable HTTP\n\ntraffic resulting with the header “x-flash-version” pulling a secondary Flash object\n\n(Figure 8).\n\nUse of Newly Created “Let’s Encrypt” Certificate: A certificate observed being hosted\n\non malicious infrastructure, likely used for some aspect of a malicious campaign, is a\n\nnewly observed certificate (Figure 12) from a free provider that contains a hostname\n\nmismatch with the server itself.\n\nOffice Document with Embedded Flash Using Remote Inclusion: The document\n\nutilized in the attack utilizes an uncommon method of embedding Flash and such\n\nmethods, particularly from untrusted sources, should be considered suspicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nplatform.\n\nICEBRG is a network security analytics company that offers a SaaS capability that enables\n\ncustomers to gain and utilize widespread network visibility for security operations.
