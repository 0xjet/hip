Overview\n\nFrom 30 September to 4 October, Infoblox observed a malicious email campaign distributing\nthe remote access trojan (RAT) Dark Crystal, which is also known as dcRAT. This malware is\npropagated via a Microsoft Word document that contains a malicious VBA script.\n\nA May 2020 report said that dcRAT was being sold on hxxp://dcrat[.]ru. Since then, the site1\nhas been taken down, the content of the landing page has been replaced with Russian\nprofanities, and distribution of dcRAT has shifted to hacking forums and P2P platforms.\n\n## 2. Customer impact\n\nCybercriminals use dcRAT for various purposes, such as to:\n\nBrowse the internet by using victims’ machines\nCollect clipboard data\nCollect cookies\n\n\n-----\n\nCompile and execute C# code\nExecute remote commands\nExfiltrate files\nInitialize UDP/TCP flood attacks\nLog keystrokes\nManage file systems\nManage running processes\nTurn on webcams and microphones on victims’ machines\n\nThese and other capabilities allow dcRAT to steal information and use a victim’s machine for\nsubsequent attacks.\n\n## 3. Campaign analysis\n\nThe email’s subject is Don’t Miss Your Luck or Hi Friend, the attachment is called\n_MoneyMake.doc, and the sender’s alias is James Leclar, Paul Maccartney, Money Center,_\n_Money Development, Martin Garix, or ADS center. To lure the victims into confirming their_\nemail addresses and opening the attachment, the actors use the following text in the email:\n\n_Please confirm your email address link below. Online training, the purpose of which is to_\n_acquaint students with the technology of remote earnings on TUZIR Internet advertising. This_\n_system has proven to be highly effective and is used by many newbies and experienced_\n_directors to earn remotely without leaving their main place of work. The author of the_\n_technology of earning money from advertising and the speaker of the program is Evgeny_\n_Andrianov. All info in Attachment — The Advertising Company._\n\n## 4. Attack chain\n\nOpening the Word attachment executes the password-protected VBA script, which starts a\nseries of downloads and displays the message Running Document. Please Wait. The script\nalso contacts a URL, from where it executes a PowerShell script to download a JavaScript\nfile, loader.js, which downloads a malicious JavaScript-encoded file, KEiZizen[.]jse, and\ndeletes itself. KEiZizen[.]jse then downloads the malicious screensaver file found[.]scr, which\ndownloads savesrefruntimeCrtCommonMonitordhcp.exe. This executable attempts to\ndetermine whether it is working on a virtual machine, creates or modifies registry values,\ncreates processes, connects to the C&C server, and performs other tasks.\n\nNext, dcRAT opens a URL in Google Chrome to create a remote WMI connection, which the\nactors use to connect to the victim’s machine. dcRAT also downloads malicious cookies and\ntries to use them to authenticate itself with the victim’s Google account.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 5. Vulnerabilities and mitigation\n\nInfoblox recommends the following measures for reducing the risk of infection by dcRAT:\n\nKeep antivirus signatures and engines up to date.\nTurn on automatic updates. This will keep the operating system up to date with the\nlatest security patches.\nDo not expose email addresses to the internet.\nExercise caution when opening all email attachments, especially those that come from\nunfamiliar senders.\nAvoid opening emails with generic subject lines.\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1. https://www.spywareremove.com/removedarkcrystalrat.html](https://www.spywareremove.com/removedarkcrystalrat.html)\n\n\n-----",
