Spread via hacked Aeria games offered on unofficial websites, the\nmodular malware can download and install virtually any other malicious code on the victim’s\ncomputer.\n\nTo spread their malware, the attackers behind Joao have misused massively-multiplayer\nonline role-playing games (MMORPGs) originally published by Aeria Games. At the time of\nwriting this article, the Joao downloader was being distributed via the anime-themed\nMMORPG Grand Fantasia offered on gf.ignitgames[.]to.\n\nOur research has shown that several other Aeria games have been misused in the same\nway in the past, however, their corresponding unofficial websites have either gone inactive\nor had the malicious downloads removed in the meantime.\n\nESET blocks the website serving Joao malware and has informed Aeria Games about the\nmatter.\n\n**Figure 1: Infected version of Grand Fantasia as distributed via gf.ignitgames[.]to**\n\n## How does it work?\n\n\n-----\n\nThe affected games have been modified to run Joao s main component – a malicious library\nmskdbe.dll, detected by ESET’s systems as Win32/Joao.A. When users run the game\nlauncher, Joao is launched along with it.\n\nUpon launching, the Joao downloader first sends basic information about the infected\ncomputer – device name, OS version and information on user privileges – to the attacker’s\nserver because the malware keeps its operations “silent” and since the game works as\nexpected, there’s nothing suspicious about the whole infection process from the user’s point\nof view.\n\nCompared to downloading and launching a legitimate Aeria game, the only visible\ndifference is an extra .dll file in the game’s installation folder.\n\n**Figure 2: Joao downloader in the game’s installation folder**\n\nAfter the communication with the server has been established, server-side logic decides\nwhether and which components will be sent to the victim’s computer. The Joao components\nwe discovered during our research had backdoor, spying, and DDoS capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Has my computer been infected? How do I clean it?\n\nDownloading lots of games from different sources and unsure if any of this applies to you?\nFor a quick check of Joao’s presence on your computer, you can try running a search for\n“mskdbe.dll” – if the search returns a result, your computer has most likely been infected\nwith the Joao malware. If no such file is found, it doesn’t automatically mean you haven’t\ncrossed paths with the malware – the crooks can rename the file at any moment.\n\nTherefore, it’s best to use a reliable security solution to detect the threat and remove it for\n[you – you can also use ESET’s Free Online Scanner.](https://www.eset.com/ng/home/products/online-scanner/)\n\n## How to stay safe?\n\nWith the [gamescom fair underway, let’s take a look at how you can enjoy gaming without](http://www.gamescom-cologne.com/gamescom/index-9.php)\nbeing faced with threats.\n\n**Favor official sources whenever possible. The MMORPGs targeted by these**\nparticular attackers are just a fraction of what might be lurking under download links\non thousands of other unofficial websites and forums distributing games.\n**Keep your games updated. Games, too, have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by**\nmalicious actors. Make sure you have all available patches applied.\n**Use a reliable security solution and keep it turned on while gaming. At any point**\nof your gaming experience, things might take a wrong turn – and you want to be\nprepared for that. Many security solutions today have a gamer mode option that lets\nyou enjoy your games without interruptions while also keeping your computer\nprotected.\n**Keep in mind that there are other threats targeting gamers.
