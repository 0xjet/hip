This malware was previously spotted targeting banks in Poland but has since\nmoved entirely to focus on banks in Spain. The techniques used by it were thoroughly\n[described by our fellow researchers at the Polish CERT and Michal Poslusny from ESET,](https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/backswap-malware-analysis/)\n[who revealed and coined the malware’s name earlier this year. However after witnessing](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/25/backswap-malware-empty-bank-accounts/)\nongoing improvements to its malicious techniques we decided to share this information to\nthe wider research community.\n\nIn the following research paper, we will focus on the evolution of BackSwap, its uniqueness,\nsuccesses, and even failures. We will try to give an overview of the malware’s different\nversions and campaigns, while outlining its techniques, some of which were proven\n\n\n-----\n\ninefficient and dropped soon after their release by the developers. We will also share a\ndetailed table of IOC and a Python3 script used to extract relevant information from\nBackSwap’s samples.\n\n**BackSwap Overview**\nBanking malware is not a new phenomenon. Zbot, Gozi, Dridex, Carberp and other notorious\nbanking trojans took advantage of the embracement and the increased use of the internet for\nissuing bank transactions, and made good profit from it. For years, these malware families\nfound advanced and sophisticated ways to steal bank credentials and credit card details from\ninnocent victims, and abuse this information for stealing money. In response to this, the\nsecurity industry, as well as web-browser companies such as Google and Mozilla, fought\nback with better security mechanisms and detections.\n\nMost banking malware steals money by injecting their code into the memory of the victim’s\nbrowser. This code would in turn hook the appropriate communication functions in the\nbrowser, so as to intercept any private banking data. This data would then be issued to the\nattacker via some protocol of exfiltration. This approach has proven to be quite complex and\nunstable, as the injected code must be adapted to each target browser. Moreover, the\nattackers have to keep track of the fast and ever-changing code of modern browsers, which\nis indeed a challenge.\n\nThis, among other reasons, could explain what seems to be a decrease in the popularity of\nbanking malware. Indeed we have seen a lot of the aforementioned banking trojans replaced\nwith far more lucrative and profitable malware families, crypto miners and ransomware are\ngood examples to name a few. This set a perfect scenario for the appearance of BackSwap,\nwhich is unique in it being both simple and yet effective in stealing banking credentials.\n\nBackSwap is written in assembly as position independent code, which hides itself inside a\nbig set of popular and legitimate software. Some examples for this are programs like 7-Zip,\nFileZilla and Notepad++. On the surface, the executable for this programs look innocent, but\nin fact they are bundled with code that was meticulously implanted by the attackers, and is\nnot evident at first sight. This code is what will eventually execute when the user launches\nany of the aforementioned applications, while the real legitimate code will never run.\n\nThis payload described above can be found in arbitrary places inside the original program,\nsuch that it overrides very particular chunks of the original code. This method is used for the\npurpose of diverting the execution of the legitimate code to a compact piece of shellcode that\nconstitutes the malware’s logic. This latter code is very small in comparison to the size of the\noriginal program, thus further complicating the ability to detect it by security tools and\nendpoint products. Such systems would scan only chunks of the binaries they deal with,\nwhich gives way for Backswap to hide deep within code that will otherwise not be flagged as\nmalicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe method of diversion mentioned above demonstrates a level of creativity that is not\ncommon in banking malware, and would more likely be spotted in targeted attacks and APT\ncampaigns. In this technique, the developers modified some C runtime initialization code,\nusually bundled to the executable by the compiler, which usually appears as pieces of code\nthat execute prior to the program’s main function. In particular, they hijacked a piece of code\nthat initializes internal data structures by invoking a set of callbacks from a predefined\nfunction pointer table. This table (used by the __initterm() function from CRT) is added with\nan additional pointer, that will in turn cause the C runtime to invoke the malware’s code\nbefore executing the original program.\n\nAfter the initialization code transfers the execution to the malicious code planted by\nBackSwap, the latter would either allocate a dedicated memory space for the final payload,\nwould sometimes create a new thread or would simply divert the instruction pointer to the\nfinal payload. As mentioned earlier, this payload is entirely written in assembly and invoked\nas position independent code. Such code can be executed anywhere in the memory,\nregardless of its base address. Since this code cannot assume where it would be located, it\nuses relative addresses, jumps, and indirect calls instead of hard-coded memory addresses.\nWriting a whole malware in this fashion is not trivial, nor easy to write, or analyzed by\nresearchers. Even though BackSwap’s position-independent payload went through several\nmajor changes and improvements in the last year, the developers did not drop this technique\nand have stuck to it since the very first variant, which may signify its effectiveness.\n\nOne of the things that caught our attention, and was also mentioned in the publication by the\nPolish CERT, is how BackSwap uses its hard-coded strings. Unlike regular programs where\nstrings are most likely to be found in read-only data sections, PIC code has to handle it\ndifferently. In particular, BackSwap uses a rare technique where the strings are not separated\nfrom the code but reside as integral part of it, such that whenever BackSwap wants to push a\nstring to the stack (e.g in order to pass it as a function argument), it is placed inline with the\ncode right after a CALL instruction to the address that follows the end of the string. Thus,\nwhen the call is invoked, the subsequent address to the instruction pointer’s value is saved in\nthe stack, and this address would point to the inlined string. To clarify this method we can\nlook at the following pseudo assembly code that prints “ABC” using printf:\n```\n0x00   e8 04 00 00 00   call 9\n0x05   41 42 43 00    ; string \"ABC\" len=4\n0x09   e8 f1 f1 ff ff   call _printf\n\n```\nUsing strings inside a code isn’t trivial and many disassemblers, like IDA Pro, can’t handle it\ncorrectly. Radare2, or its graphic-user-interface program — Cutter — can handle this quite\nwell, and treat the strings as part of the function, as can be seen in the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Call-over-string technique as shown in Cutter\n\nBecause of BackSwap’s position-independent nature, it can’t rely on the Import Address\nTable to retrieve the addresses of common Windows API functions. Instead, it uses a\ncommon technique, used mostly in injected code, whereby the PEB structure (Process\nEnvironment Block) is processed in order to find the list of loaded modules, from which the\naddress of kernel32.dll can be retrieved. Then, by parsing the PE structure and locating the\n`LoadLibraryA` API functions, BackSwap loads more DLLs, the names of which are\nhardcoded in it.\n\nIn order to load all the functions that are needed for its execution, BackSwap creates an\nuninitialized table with hardcoded hashes of function names. It then iterates over all the\nexport functions of the loaded libraries and calculates a hash number for each function\nname. These function names are compared to the precalculated hashes in the table and if\nthere is a match, BackSwap fills the address of the corresponding function in its table. This\nway, BackSwap implements and builds its very own Import Table in run-time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: PEB parsing and detection of kernel32 base address from one of the loaded\n_libraries lists_\n\nAfter initializing all the crafted table with all required function addresses, BackSwap begins to\nprepare the ground for its core functionality – stealing credentials and money from its victims.\nFirst, it checks if another instance of itself is already running. It does so by using a technique\nwhich is similar to checking the existence of a Mutex in the system. Namely, it determines if a\nWindows event object which has the name pattern ` <USERNAME>-<COMPUTERNAME> ` already\nexists. If so, the malware will terminate the execution, as it infers another copy is running in\nthe system.\n\nDepending on its version, and following the above check, BackSwap would create several\nthreads and setup event hooks for a range of events using the `SetWinEventHook` function.\nAlthough there are some changes in this behavior between different versions of the malware,\nthe essential logic is the same – the hooked events are intended to intercept activity that\noccurs with relation to window applications across the computer. Some of the hooked events\ncan be seen below.\n```\n0x8005 EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS\n0x8006 EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTION\n0x8007 EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONADD\n0x8008 EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONREMOVE\n0x8009 EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTIONWITHIN\n0x800A EVENT_OBJECT_STATECHANGE\n0x800B EVENT_OBJECT_LOCATIONCHANGE\n0x800C EVENT_OBJECT_NAMECHANGE\n0x800D EVENT_OBJECT_DESCRIPTIONCHANGE\n0x800E EVENT_OBJECT_VALUECHANGE\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nUpon each event interception, the triggered hook function would search for a URL starting\nwith `https` in the information gathered from the hooked events. In newer versions of\nBackSwap, if a URL was found, the malware will in turn decrypt a resource from its .rsrc\nsection which turns out to be its web-injects, a piece of javascript code that is injected to the\ninternet browser in order to manipulate objects in pages visited by the user. This code will be\nparsed, and the found URL would be checked to see if it matches one of the banks targeted\nby the malware.\n\nThe approach taken by BackSwap to insert the javascript code in to the browser is simple,\nyet unique and powerful. Instead of injecting code straight to the browser’s memory, the\nmalware mimics a user interaction with the browser’s window by sending keystrokes to it.\nNamely, It opens the browser’s Developer’s Tools or sets the focus to the URL bar and\npastes the malicious javascript by faking a press on Ctrl+V. This unique way will go under the\nradar of many security tools because it is hard to tell the difference between this and a\nlegitimate user interaction. Different versions of BackSwap interact differently with the\nbrowser and we will describe these differences later in the article.\n\nThe content of the javascript web-injects is the component of BackSwap that changes most\noften across versions and samples. Obviously, it has to be unique for each targeted bank,\nbut Backswap does an extra mile in changing what the javascript does, how it would\nmanipulate the victim’s browser to send money to the criminals and how it will pass the\nstolen credentials to the C&C server.\n\nOne of the threads created by the malware will loop infinitely and check if the javascript webinject passed any credentials to send to the C&C. It could be either by saving the stolen\ninformation to the clipboard or by changing the window’s title. Once again, These techniques\nof sending information from the JS to the binary differ between versions of BackSwap, and\nwill be discussed with more detail later on.\n\n\n-----\n\n**BackSwap Evolution**\n\nDuring the past few months we have tracked hundreds of Backswap samples and were able\nto observe many changes amongst them. By inspecting all this data, we could sort the\nsamples into groups and note the changes and modifications in the malware’s behavior from\nits appearance in the wild to present time.\n\n**Early Versions**\n\nThe first samples of BackSwap were spotted at the middle of March 2018 and, naturally, is\nconsidered the simplest in its evolution. These samples almost did not contain any measures\nto complicate the analysis of the payload, which was inserted as-is to the original program\n(Mostly 7-Zip but also WinGraph and SQLMon). For this reason, a lot of the malware’s\nstrings, including targeted banks and browsers, were all visible. Hence, it was possible to\ninfer that the targeted banks were all Polish and each sample inspected was targeting\nbetween 1 and 3 banks. The most common targeted bank sites in these samples were\n_ipko.pl, 24.pl and mbank.pl._\n\nAnother characteristic of this initial version is that it kept an encrypted resource for each one\nof the banks it targeted, where the encryption method used was a simple singly byte XOR\nwith the value 0x9. Its interesting to note that while this method is very weak from a\ncryptographic standpoing, BackSwap keeps using it to this day. The web-injects code itself\nwas also quite straight-forward, and contained the placeholder\n‘xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx’ that was set by the malware to hold an IBAN for stolen money\ntransactions. Whenever the victim entered one of the targeted banking websites and wanted\n\n\n-----\n\nto perform a transaction, the web-inject code would replace the target IBAN with the\naforementioned one, thus transferring the money to the attackers instead of the real intended\nrecipient.\n\nA month later, in April 2018, more banks were added as targets, and some of the samples\ncontained up to six different resources in a single binary. The Javascript implementation of\nthe web-injects code improved and contained a new way for it to interact with the code in the\nPE binary, using the title of the browser’s window. The shellcode checks for changes to the\ntext in the title of the browser and grabs the information which is sent to it but the WebInjects.\nAdditionally, a background thread in the malware’s PE took any stolen information and stored\nit in a log file on the computer, which was later sent to a C&C server.\n\nIn the middle of April, BackSwap began to create fake input objects in the DOM of the\ntargeted websites. These fake input fields look exactly like the original ones, But while the\nusers fill the fake fields, the original fields are now hidden and contain the attacker’s IBAN.\n[This change in BackSwap was thoroughly presented and demonstrated by F5 in this article.](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/backswap-defrauds-online-banking-customers-using-hidden-input-fi)\nAt the same time, the malware started to abandon a former injection technique whereby the\nvictim’s browser was opened to the developer’s tools utility, where web-injects code would be\npasted to alter the current page. Instead it moved to a technique where the malicious\njavascript would be pasted in the URL address bar.\n\nAt the end of April, BackSwap started using another XOR key for the first time in order to\nencrypt its resources, this time it was 0xb. This type of change has promptly become typical\nfor BackSwap, to the extent that we were able to spot eight different encryption keys in May.\nIn fact, all recent samples come with a distinctive key. However, as noted before, it still uses\na single-byte XOR which is a weak encryption method.\n\nApart from the change in XOR key, the authors also moved the IBAN to be hardcoded in the\nweb-injects javascript, as opposed to the binary where it previously resided. This persisted\nthrough most of the samples in May, where some had additional names appended, which\nmost likely correspond to money mules that participated in the operation.\n\n**Figure 3: Hard-coded information of a money mule.**\n\nThe web-injects in May also presented a new function named ` copyStringToClipboard `\nwhich was responsible for copying a given string to the clipboard, as the name suggests.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis string contained stolen information that was filled by the victim and was picked up by a\nthread in the malware’s PE that read and processed it.\n\nAdditionally, in the same month BackSwap began tracking the number of infected machines,\nwhich was done by sending an HTTP request to a popular Russian website, yadro.ru, that\ntracks hit-counts for websites. This method is very simple and effective for collecting victim\ntelemetry from the attacker’s site, as it’s hard to flag by security products, with the target site\nfor collection of this data being legitimate.\n\n**Encrypted Payload Inside a BMP Image**\n**June 2018 was a significant month for the evolution of BackSwap, in which the developers**\nintroduced a unique technique for payload encoding that wasn’t described before in relation\nto BackSwap. In this technique, the PIC described before is encrypted, and embedded inside\na BMP image, taking advantage of a unique characteristic of the BMP header.\n\n**Figure 4:** _First image to introduce embedded position-independent code_\n\nThe magic header of a BMP file is 0x42, 0x4D which corresponds to “BM” in ASCII. This pair\nof hexadecimal numbers happens to also be valid x86 instructions. The following screenshot\nfrom `radare2 will demonstrate this interpretation of the bytes.`\n\nThe criminals behind BackSwap took advantage of the BMP header in order to make the\ncode look more innocent. After the execution of these dummy instructions, there is a JMP\ninstruction to an address that starts the decryption routine of the PIC as can be seen in the\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing screenshot. The decryption routine is quite simple and can be easily analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the first BMP image was rather abstract and hard to understand, the subsequent ones\nturned out to be meaningful and based on real images, either from the internet or created by\nthe attackers. The first example to show up is an image from a famous scene in Al Pacino’s\nfamous movie “Scarface”.\n\nThe first sample with this image also contained a change in how BackSwap’s web-injects\ninteract with the PE binary. The previously described technique where a window’s title was\nchanged to convey information was removed, leaving the clipboard as the single entity for\ncommunicating with the malware’s code in the PE binary.\n\n**Recent Versions**\n\nThe biggest respite in BackSwap’s activity was in July 2018. We detected almost no activity\nin its development as well as its distribution and estimated that some major improvements\nwere likely to arrive. Indeed, In August 2018 we were provided with new samples that\nsignified a particular turning point for the malware as we could observe some new changes\nin it.\n\nFirst, it shifted its malicious operation to focus almost entirely on Spanish banks while totally\nabandoning any previously targeted Polish banks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Some of the Spanish and Polish banks that are targeted by BackSwap**\n\nExcept for the targets, BackSwap changed the way it stores its web-injects. Instead of\nkeeping it in different resources for each targeted bank, as it did before, it aggregated all of\nthem into a single resource, such that each web-inject code snippet was delimited by a\nparticular separator keyword. During August we detected two such separators being used,\nthe first one was “ [start:] ” and the second “ [fartu:] ”. Moreover, the targeted bank\nsites were not stored in the malware’s PIC anymore, but in the web-inject code itself. An\nexample for this new form of web-injects can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\nA few samples from August were found using external websites to store their javascript\npayload. While the web-injects were still stored in the `.rsrc section of the hijacked`\nprogram, they were simply a wrapper and imported the malicious `javascript code from`\nother servers. This was the first and only time we saw BackSwap doing this. Storing\nmalicious code on 3rd party servers is less stable since security vendors and the website\nitself can take down the malicious pages.\n\n\n-----\n\nBackSwap introduced few more BMP images during August. We spotted images of Cartman,\nan old lady, Link from The Legend of Zelda video game series and an image of the Russian\npresident, Vladimir Putin. At the end of August, the criminals added a rather childish text to a\nversion of Putin’s image where they try to offend the AV industry.\n\n**Figure 6: BackSwap’s PIC embedded in an image of Putin.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe variants from September through November haven’t shown any major changes. We\nobserved some modifications in the PIC payload, especially more encryption layers and tons\nof junk-code that is meant to make the analysis more complicated as well as making the\nmalware harder to detect. During these months BackSwap introduced more separators to its\nJavascript web-injects such as `[mumuo:] and` `[pghtyq] in September,` `[tempo:] and`\n```\n[code:] in October, and the most recent [joke:] in November. It also added more\n\n```\nversions for its BMP images. The main image used in October was of Stalin taken from a\nfamous propaganda poster, and most of November’s samples had an image of a man\nwaving the LGBTQ pride flag.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most recent sample that we spotted, from the end of November, introduced a new image\ntaken from a 1970’s Russian TV-series called “Seventeen Moments of Spring” (Семнадцать\nмгновений весны) based on a novel with the same name. The delimiter in the web-injects\nwas also changed and is now “ [asap:] ”. This isn’t the only change, as it seems that the\nway the malware transfers information from the Javascript web-inject code to the executed\nshellcode in the PE changed as well. As described earlier, BackSwap used to send the\nvictim’s credentials and other messages to the shellcode via the clipboard, which is now\nreplaced by sending the same data through the browser’s URL.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7:** _Backswap newest BMP image_\n\n**_BackSwap’s latest sample was also sending another childish message to the AV_**\n**_industry, asking the industry to stay out of its way. Well, this is not going to happen._**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8: image of the latest message to the AV industry_**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile banking trojans seem to have become a far less prominent method of stealing money\nin the cyber criminal world, BackSwap is the evidence that this monetization model is not\ndead yet. In fact, when it comes to BackSwap it seems that the opposite is true As described\nin this publication we can definitely see ongoing efforts by the malware’s authors to improve\nit and make it more evasive from security products.\n\nMoreover, users should be cautious when downloading software from unauthorized sources,\nas this malware demonstrates the ability to bypass security measures by pretending to be a\nlegitimate application. In light of such a threat, it is highly recommended to obtain software\nonly from the sites of its original distributors.\n\nWe at Check Point Research are continuing to track this threat so as to provide the best\nmitigation against it, even in light of its dynamic and constantly changing nature.\n\n**Appendix**\n\n[backswap_extractor.py – A radare2-based Python3 script which can be used to decrypt](https://github.com/ITAYC0HEN/BackSwap-Research/blob/master/backswap_extractor.py)\nand\nextract information from several versions of BackSwap including its\nposition-indepndent payload.\n[backswap-ioc.csv – A table of IOC and other relevant information about BackSwap’s](https://github.com/ITAYC0HEN/BackSwap-Research/blob/master/backswap_ioc.csv)\nsamples.\n\n\n-----",
