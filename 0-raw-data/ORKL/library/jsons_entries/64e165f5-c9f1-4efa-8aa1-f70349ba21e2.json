Also found here:\n\n[http://shadows-in-the-cloud.net](http://shadows-in-the-cloud.net)\n\n[INFOWAR](http://www.infowar-monitor.net)\nMONITOR\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Foreword\n\nCrime and espionage form a dark underworld of cyberspace. Whereas crime is usually the first to seek out new\nopportunities and methods, espionage usually follows in its wake, borrowing techniques and tradecraft. The\n_Shadows in the Cloud report illustrates the increasingly dangerous ecosystem of crime and espionage and its_\nembeddedness in the fabric of global cyberspace.\n\nThis ecosystem is the product of numerous factors. Attackers employ complex, adaptive attack techniques that\ndemonstrate high-level ingenuity and opportunism. They take advantage of the cracks and fissures that open up\nin the fast-paced transformations of our technological world. Every new software program, social networking\nsite, cloud computing, or cheap hosting service that is launched into our everyday digital lives creates an\nopportunity for this ecosystem to morph, adapt, and exploit.\n\nIt has also emerged because of poor security practices of users, from individuals to large organizations. We\ntake for granted that the information and communications revolution is a relatively new phenomenon, still\nvery much in the midst of unceasing epochal change. Public institutions have adopted these new technologies\nfaster than procedures and rules have been created to deal with the radical transparency and accompanying\nvulnerabilities they introduce.\n\nToday, data is transferred from laptops to USB sticks, over wireless networks at café hot spots, and stored across\ncloud computing services whose servers are located in far-off political jurisdictions. These new modalities of\ncommunicating de-concentrate and disperse the targets of exploitation, multiplying the points of exposure\nand potential compromise. Paradoxically, documents and data are probably safer in a file cabinet, behind the\nbureaucrat’s careful watch, than they are on the PC today.\n\nThe ecosystem of crime and espionage is also emerging because of opportunism on the part of actors. Cyber\nespionage is the great equalizer. Countries no longer have to spend billions of dollars to build globe-spanning\nsatellites to pursue high-level intelligence gathering, when they can do so via the web. We have no evidence in\nthis report of the involvement of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) or any other government in the Shadow\nnetwork. But an important question to be entertained is whether the PRC will take action to shut the Shadow\nnetwork down. Doing so will help to address long-standing concerns that malware ecosystems are actively\ncultivated, or at the very least tolerated, by governments like the PRC who stand to benefit from their exploits\nthough the black and grey markets for information and data.\n\nFinally, the ecosystem is emerging because of a propitious policy environment — or rather the absence of\none — at a global level. Governments around the world are engaged in a rapid race to militarize cyber space,\nto develop tools and methods to fight and win wars in this domain. This arms race creates an opportunity\nstructure ripe for crime and espionage to flourish. In the absence of norms, principles and rules of mutual\nrestraint at a global level, a vacuum exists for subterranean exploits to fill.\n\nThere is a real risk of a perfect storm in cyberspace erupting out of this vacuum that threatens to subvert\ncyberspace itself, either through over-reaction, a spiraling arms race, the imposition of heavy-handed controls,\nor through gradual irrelevance as people disconnect out of fear of insecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is, therefore, an urgent need for a global convention on cyberspace that builds robust mechanisms of\ninformation sharing across borders and institutions, defines appropriate rules of the road for engagement in the\ncyber domain, puts the onus on states to not tolerate or encourage mischievous networks whose activities\noperate from within their jurisdictions, and protects and preserves this valuable global commons.\n\nUntil such a normative and policy shift occurs, the shadows in the cloud may grow into a dark, threatening storm.\n\n\n**Ron Deibert**\nDirector, the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs\nUniversity of Toronto\n\n\n**Rafal Rohozinski**\nCEO, The SecDev Group (Ottawa)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Acknowledgments\n\nThis investigation is a result of a collaboration between the Information Warfare Monitor and the Shadowserver\nFoundation.

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen\nfrom politically sensitive targets and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents\nfrom the Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing\nsensitive information on citizens of numerous third-party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business\ninformation, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the\nmalware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing\nsystems, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while\noperating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation\nof the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some\nof the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an\neight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the\nShadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation\ntechniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.\n\n###### Summary of Main Findings\n\n� **Complex cyber espionage network - Documented evidence of a cyber espionage network that compromised govern-**\nment, business, and academic computer systems in India, the Office of the Dalai Lama, and the United Nations.\nNumerous other institutions, including the Embassy of Pakistan in the United States, were also compromised. Some of\nthese institutions can be positively identified, while others cannot.\n\n� **Theft of classified and sensitive documents - Recovery and analysis of exfiltrated data, including one document that**\nappears to be encrypted diplomatic correspondence, two documents marked “SECRET”, six as “RESTRICTED”, and\nfive as “CONFIDENTIAL”. These documents are identified as belonging to the Indian government. However, we do not\nhave direct evidence that they were stolen from Indian government computers and they may have been compromised\nas a result of being copied onto personal computers. The recovered documents also include 1,500 letters sent from the\nDalai Lama’s office between January and November 2009. The profile of documents recovered suggests that the attackers targeted specific systems and profiles of users.\n\n� **Evidence of collateral compromise - A portion of the recovered data included visa applications submitted to Indian**\ndiplomatic missions in Afghanistan. This data was voluntarily provided to the Indian missions by nationals of 13 countries as part of the regular visa application process. In a context like Afghanistan, this finding points to the complex nature\nof the information security challenge where risks to individuals (or operational security) can occur as a result of a data\ncompromise on secure systems operated by trusted partners.\n\n� **Command-and-control infrastructure that leverages cloud-based social media services - Documentation of a com-**\nplex and tiered command and control infrastructure, designed to maintain persistence. The infrastructure made use of\nfreely available social media systems that include Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs, blog.com and Yahoo!\nMail. This top layer directed compromised computers to accounts on free web hosting services, and as the free hosting\nservers were disabled, to a stable core of command and control servers located in the PRC.\n\n� **Links to Chinese hacking community - Evidence of links between the Shadow network and two individuals living in**\nChengdu PRC to the underground hacking community in the PRC\n\n\n-----\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n###### Part I: Background and Context \b p. 1\n\n1.1 Introduction - Building upon GhostNet \b p. 2\n1.2 About the Shadows in the Cloud Investigation - Beyond GhostNet \b p. 4\n1.3 Research Framework \b p. 5\n\n###### Part II: Methodology and Investigative Techniques\b p. 7\n\n2.1 Methodology \b p. 8\n2.2 Field Investigation \b p. 8\n2.3 Technical Investigative Activities \b p. 10\n\n###### Part III: Mapping the Shadows in the Cloud \b p. 12\n\n3.1 Analysis of Data while in the Field\b p. 14\n3.2.

The rapid rise of\nthis industry is in part a recognition of the significant threat that these global criminal ecosystems represent to\ncritical infrastructure, government systems, personal privacy, commerce, and defense. Several high profile cases\nand events, including the attacks on Google and other American companies in December 2009, underscore the\ngrowing threat environment and suggest that these attacks are becoming the norm rather than an exception.\nPolicymakers are responding with legislation, institutional reforms and new initiatives, and an already sizable\nmarket for cyber security services is mushrooming into a multi-billion dollar global industry.\n\nThis report aims to contribute to research and debate in this domain. Its release is strategic, coming roughly one\nyear after the publication of Tracking GhostNet (See Box 1, below).\n\nBox 1. Tracking GhostNet: Lessons Learned\n\n_Tracking Ghostnet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network was the product of a ten-month investigation and_\nanalysis focused on allegations of Chinese cyber espionage against the Tibetan community. The research entailed\nfield-based investigations in India, Europe and North America working directly with affected Tibetan organizations,\nincluding the Private Office of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, and several Tibetan NGOs in Europe\nand North America. The fieldwork generated extensive data that allowed us to examine Tibetan information security\npractices, as well as capture evidence of malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems. We also engaged\nin extensive data analysis and technical investigation of web-based interfaces to command and control servers that\nwere used by attackers to send instructions to, and receive data from compromised computers.\n\nThe report documented a wide ranging network of compromised computers, including at least 1,295 spread across\n103 countries, 30 percent of which we identified and determined to be “high-value” targets, including ministries\nof foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news organizations, and a computer located at NATO\nheadquarters. Although there was circumstantial evidence pointing to elements within the People’s Republic of\nChina, our investigation concluded that there was not enough evidence to implicate the Chinese government itself\nand attribution behind GhostNet remains a mystery.\n\nThe report’s aftermath was a learning experience. The data that had been collected during the GhostNet investigation\nincluded sensitive information about compromised computers in over a hundred countries. Many of the victims\nwere understandably concerned about which of their computers were targeted and compromised, and came to us\nfor information. On our side, we felt unsure about the protocol around information sharing, and were in an awkward\nposition to be able to give information over to governments and affected parties directly without being entirely clear\nabout whom would be responsible and whether or not our interlocutors were appropriate authorities. The notification\nproblems around Ghostnet informed our approach to the Shadows in the Cloud investigation, including being more\nconscious from the outset of documenting our notification procedures.\n\nThe title of the report ­— Shadows in the Cloud: An Investigation into Cyber Espionage 2.0 — is suggestive of\nseveral threads that wind their way through the investigation. First, the malware networks we document and\nanalyze are to a large degree organized and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control\nservers. Second, although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and\n\n\n-----\n\nof a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification. The 2.0 designation\nalso contains a double entendre: it refers to a generational shift we believe is unfolding in malware networks in\nmultiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread\nacross redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. The 2.0 reference is also meant to note how the Shadow investigation\nis both a re-engagement with, but also a departure from, its predecessor: the Tracking GhostNet investigation.\n\nThis report is a continuation of Tracking GhostNet, but also represents a significantly new investigation yielding\ndifferent and more nuanced evidence and analysis of the evolving cybercrime and cyber espionage environment. As with GhostNet, we are interested in better understanding the evolving nature and complex ecosystem\nof today’s malware networks and see this investigation as helping to build a knowledge base around cyber security research. In this respect, Shadows in the Cloud is very much a work-in-progress, insofar as we began this\ninvestigation by picking up several threads that were left open-ended or unanswered in the original GhostNet\ninvestigation, and expect to continue to examine threads that are left hanging in this report.\n\nThe aim of this present investigation is to further refine the methodologies used to investigate and analyze\nmalware networks through a fusion methodology, which combines network-based technical interrogation, data\nanalysis and visualization, and field-based contextual investigations (See Box 2, below). The combination of\nmethods from different disciplines is a critical and common feature of both the GhostNet and Shadow investigations and analyses. Network-based technical interrogation, open source data mining and analysis (using tools\nsuch as Google), key informant interviews and field-based investigations on their own can accomplish a great\ndeal, but it is through their fusion that a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding can be achieved.\n\nBox 2. Operationalizing the Fusion Methodology\n\nOver the past decade we have been developing a _fusion methodology for investigating the exercise of political_\npower in cyberspace. This approach combines quantitative, qualitative and technical data, and draws on\nmultidisciplinary analysis techniques to derive results. In our field investigations, we conduct research among\naffected target audiences and employ techniques that include interviews, long-term _in situ interaction with our_\npartners, and technical data collection involving system monitoring, network reconnaissance, and interrogation.\nData and in situ analysis from field investigations are then taken to the lab where they are analysed using a variety\nof data fusion and visualization methods, based around the Palantir data fusion system. Leads developed on\nthe basis of in-field activities are pursued through technical investigations and the resulting data and analysis\noutputs are shared with our in-field teams and partners for verification and for generating additional entry points\nfor follow-on field investigations. We then interpret results from these investigations through a variety of theoretical\nlenses drawing from disciplines of political science, international relations, sociology, risk analysis, and criminology\n(among others). We believe that through this mixed methods interdisciplinary approach we are able to develop a\nricher understanding than would be possible from studies that focus solely on technical analysis or that primarily\nconsist of legal, policy or theoretical investigations.\n\nThe Shadow investigation began as a follow-up of unexplored paths discovered during the GhostNet investigation. It started in the offices of Tibetan organizations who suspected they were targets of cyber espionage, and\nbroadened to include a much wider list of victims. The investigation used a number of techniques, including\na DNS sinkhole we established by registering domains that had previously been used by the attackers targeting Tibetan institutions, such as a computer system at the offices of the Dalai Lama. This reinforces our view\nthat the combination of technical analysis and field investigation forms a fruitful starting point of inquiry that\nultimately leads to important insights into the attackers’ capabilities, the ability to investigate a much wider\ndomain of infected targets, and a contextual understanding of the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs was the case with GhostNet, dozens of high-level government networks, embassies, international organizations and others have been penetrated, and confidential, sensitive, and private documents stolen. The Shadows\nreport underscores the interconnected and complex challenges of cyber security. In particular, it points to the\npossibility of a perfect storm that may result from a lack of international consensus, ill-developed and implemented security practices, a paucity of notification mechanisms, and the growing confluence of cyber crime,\ntraditional espionage, and the militarization of cyberspace.\n\n##### 1.2 About the Shadows in the Cloud Investigation:\n#### Beyond GhostNet\n\nThe Tracking GhostNet report revealed a small piece of the underground cyber espionage world. After the\nreport was published, several of the command and control servers listed in the report and part of the network\nwent offline. However, targeted cyber attacks against Tibetan interests and various governments did not suddenly cease. The Shadowserver Foundation had also been looking into several similar cyber attacks both prior\nto and after the GhostNet report was published. Approximately six months after the report’s publication, the\nShadowserver Foundation and the Information Warfare Monitor began a collaborative effort to further investigate new and related attacks, as well as any remaining parts of GhostNet.\n\n_Shadows in the Cloud thus departs from Tracking GhostNet in several ways. Research on cyber security is_\nrapidly developing, and several groups with widely differing skill sets and experience are working on related areas.\nInformation sharing, generally speaking, is immature and underdeveloped, often hampered by proprietary\nconcerns surrounding the commercial market for cyber security services. Progress on research in this area will\nonly stand to benefit from greater dialogue and information sharing among security researchers. Shadows in the\n_Cloud was thus undertaken jointly by the Information Warfare Monitor, which itself is a collaborative engage-_\nment between a public and private institution, and the Shadowserver Foundation, which is an all-volunteer\nwatchdog group of security professionals who gather, track and report on malware, botnet activity, and electronic fraud. The Information Warfare Monitor and the Shadowserver Foundation have several complementary\nresources and data sets. Combining efforts in this way contributed to a much greater pool of knowledge and\nexpertise from which to draw strategic choices along each step of the investigation, and for overall analysis.\nLastly, the information sharing that went into Shadows in the Cloud extended to the Office of His Holiness the\nDalai Lama (OHHDL), the Tibetan Government in Exile (TGIE) and Tibetan non-governmental organizations.\nInformation sharing among victims of network intrusions and espionage is rare. The Tibetan organizations were\nwilling to provide access and share information with our investigation that proved to be invaluable.\n\n_Shadows in the Cloud is also distinct from Tracking GhostNet in terms of the type of data unearthed during the_\ncourse of the investigation. With GhostNet, while we were able to monitor the exfiltration of sensitive documents\nfrom computers to which we had field access, we were unable to otherwise determine which documents were\nstolen from victims that we had identified, and thus could only infer intentionality on the part of the attackers. In\n_Shadows, we were able to recover a significant volume of stolen documents, some of which are highly sensitive,_\nfrom a drop zone connected to one of the malware networks under observation. Although not unprecedented\namong cyber security research, access to stolen documents such as those which are analysed here offers a\nunique but partial insight into the type of information that can be leaked out of compromised computers. It may\neven help answer some lingering questions about the intentionality and attribution of the attackers, although\nthat is not clear by any means. We pick up both of these threads in detail in our report below.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1.3 Research Framework\n\nAlthough the research that we engage in is investigatory, it is not simply a report of the facts per se. Our aim is\nto engage the cyber security research community by building upon prior research in a structured, focused manner\nthrough a systematic research framework. Several overarching research questions structure the Shadow investigation and our analysis. We outline these here, and pick up on them throughout our report.\n\n###### Observation and Characterization of the Ecosystem of Malware\n\nOne of the aims of cyber security research is to observe and characterize the evolving nature and complex\necosystem of today’s malware, botnets, cyber espionage and cyber crime networks. This is not a simple task,\nas the ecosystem of malware is very much like a complex adaptive system, only one that is dispersed across\nmultiple ecosystems, operated by clandestine actors with potential criminal and/or espionage motivations who\nhave shown a propensity to adapt their techniques to new software tools, social networking platforms and other\ntechnologies. Crimeware networks, which to some extent are the oldest and most widespread malware networks, target generalized population sets in a mostly undiscriminating fashion. Alongside crimeware networks,\nhowever, there are other networks that are more discriminating, often characterized by the use of custom-made\nsoftware attacks, and which seek to exploit and infiltrate not random pools of victims but rather deliberately\nselected targets. Within each of these two major types of malware networks are likely many sub-types, including networks that specialize in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Confusing matters further is that\ntoolkits and techniques used in one instance are borrowed from another, making classification difficult and\nincreasingly questionable. Being able to map the ecosystem of malware, however, is critical for research, policy\nand operational matters, and so is one of the primary aims of our research in Shadows in the Cloud (Adair 2010).\n\n###### From Criminal Exploitation to Political Espionage?\n\nCyber crime is as old as cyberspace itself, and criminal networks, as alluded to above, are longstanding characteristics of the dark side of the Internet. What is more novel is the use of criminal exploitation kits, techniques\nand networks for purposes of political espionage (Villeneuve 2010). Debates about whether or not governments\nare actively involved in cyber espionage and computer network exploitation, either through agencies they\ncontrol directly or through some kind of privateering, now dominate the headlines and have become part of a\ngrowing politicization of the cyber security arena. One of the aims of our research is to discern to what extent\nwe can impute motivations behind the attacks we document, to help understand whether in fact the networks\nunder our observation are part of a criminal network, a political espionage network, an industrial espionage\nnetwork, an opportunistic network, or some combination of these. Such questions, it should be pointed out, are\nentirely distinct (though not unrelated) to the question of attribution (i.e., who is responsible?).\n\nWe hypothesize that political espionage networks may be deliberately exploiting criminal kits, techniques and\nnetworks both to distance themselves from attribution and strategically cultivate a climate of uncertainty. To\nanswer these questions requires a high degree of nuance, as the information we have been able to obtain is\nincomplete, and so a great deal of our analysis rests on inferences made on the basis of multiple data sources\nand our fusion methodology (See Box 2, page 3).\n\n###### Collateral Compromise\n\nOrganizations from around the world have moved swiftly to adopt new information and communication\n\n\n-----\n\nmilitary sectors. They exchange information as a matter of routine, across social networking and cloud computing platforms, using flash drives and other portable devices, and thus become co-dependent on each others’\ninformation and computer and network security practices. The vulnerabilities of one actor can quickly and\nunintentionally compromise unwitting third parties, which in turn can become the basis for actionable intelligence against those third parties. We hypothesize that there is a high probability for collateral compromise\nin any malware network because of this mutual dependence. A key consideration, of course, is how to discern\nintended from unintended victims, a problem that is difficult to solve.\n\n###### Actionable Intelligence around Exfiltrated Data\n\nRelated to collateral compromise is the issue of the strategic value of exfiltrated data. Access to this data can\noffer important clues about the motivation and attribution of the attackers. It can also provide insight about\nthe strategic value of the type of data that can be accessed through malware networks. In the course of our\ninvestigation, we assumed that we would get, at best, only a partial picture of the exfiltrated data, but even that\npartial picture would provide some potentially meaningful information for those who acquire it. While each individual data point may be of little value, when combined with other data acquired through other means (e.g.,\nopen source searching) a very detailed operational picture can be assembled. We try to assess and evaluate the\nexfiltrated data we were able to access with these issues in mind.\n\n###### Attribution\n\nExamining attribution is an arduous but important component of any cyber security investigation and has\nbecome a major political issue at the highest levels around several recent cyber attacks. In order to characterise\nthe attackers, a variety of technical indicators as well as behavioural indicators need to be analysed (Parker et\nal. 2004; Parker et al. 2003). These characteristics are interpreted in the context of the nature of the targets and\nthe objective of the attack. The nature and timing of the attack, the exploit, the malware, and the command and\ncontrol infrastructure, are just some of the components that go into determining attribution. Knowing the methods and behaviour of the attackers as well as the character of the tools the attackers use once inside the target’s\nnetwork, the data that the attackers exfiltrate and where that data goes, are also crucial parts of the overall assessment (Bejtlich 2010; Cloppert 2009; Mandiant 2010).\n\nMoreover, historical information and ongoing intelligence collection are crucial when trying to understand the\nscope of the threat (Deloitte & Touche LLP, 2010). It is difficult to assess attribution when examining an isolated\nattack; it is the broader patterns, connections and contextual information that inform the process. However, it is\nuncommon to have a complete data set covering all aspects of the attackers’ operations. Some may have access\nto data regarding the attackers’ activities once inside a particular network. Others may have extensive collections of malware samples and historical data on command and control infrastructure. Others may have information on how the attackers use various exploits, or craft targeted spear phishing emails and other methods focused\non compromising particular targets. Others may have data retrieved from the attackers that indicate the identity\nof those who have been compromised. And finally still others may have the necessary geopolitical knowledge to\ninterpret the attacks within a broader context.\n\nOften, investigations do not have the luxury of such a full data set and must rely on incomplete information and\npartial observations. Further complicating matters is that any of this information is often dependent on mistakes\nmade by the attackers, which typically lead to slices of an overall network instead of a comprehensive view.\nAny questions concerning attribution must therefore always be set against a context of a complete consideration\nof alternative explanations and qualified observations\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART 2: Methodology and Investigative Techniques\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2.1 Methodology\n\nThe core of the methodology employed in the Shadows in the Cloud investigation rests at the nexus of technical\ninterrogation, field investigation, data analysis, and geopolitical, contextual research (See Box 2, page 3). No one\nmethod alone is capable of providing a comprehensive understanding of malware networks; it is through their\ncombination that a complete picture is derived. For example, a technical analysis of exploits and malware used\nby attackers alone can provide a great deal of insight into capabilities and targets. The command and control\nservers used by the malware can be enumerated, and can sometimes reveal additional information that can be\nused to identify those who have been compromised and data that may have been exfiltrated from these targets.\nHowever, the technical analysis of exploits and malware samples alone only provides one crucial data set.\n\nField research is a critical, although sometimes neglected, component of malware research. While much of the\nemphasis in existing malware research is focused on technical analysis of malware samples, this purely technical approach is unlikely to yield a complete picture. For example, through field research we have found compromised computers checking in with command and control servers that we have not seen in malware samples\ndistributed by the attackers. There is some evidence to suggest that attackers may migrate compromised hosts\nto new command and control servers and/or command compromised computers to install new malware that is\nnot publicly disseminated through spear phishing and other targeted malware attacks. The field research component can thus provide an equally important insight into the attackers’ capabilities once the target’s network\nis compromised, as well as updated command and control locations. Moreover, it allows for the investigation\nof the context surrounding the the target and why the victims may have been targeted in the first place. Finally,\nthe wider geopolitical considerations, derived from both field investigations and contextual research, place the\ncollection of information in a broader context that supplies details around issues such as the timing of the attacks, the nature of the exploitation, including the use of any social engineering techniques, and potentially the\nidentity and motivation of the attackers.\n\nWe present our methodology in the following sequence – field investigation first, followed by technical investigations. However, in practice the two are iterative processes. In some circumstances, field investigations begin\nfirst, followed by technical investigations, while in other cases the opposite is true. In this case, a technicalbased investigative technique (sinkhole analysis) is probably the closest to an actual starting point, although\neven that method was informed by prior knowledge derived from field and contextual research reaching back\nto the Tracking GhostNet report. In almost all circumstances, geopolitical and contextual research informs both\nthe technical and field research components. In practice, therefore, fusion methodology is a holistic, non-linear\napproach, but one that takes place in a very structured and focused fashion.\n\n##### 2.2 Field Investigation\n\nOur objective is to ultimately understand the capabilities and motivations of those engaged in targeted malware\nattacks. Field research provides critical insight into the methods and operations of the attackers. By analyzing\ncomputers at locations that are routinely targeted by (similar) attackers, we aim to identify portions of command and control infrastructure that the attackers use for particular targets as well as document the type of\ndata that the attackers exfiltrate from the targets. However, our research aims to be more than just extracting\ninformation from those who have been compromised\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Tracking GhostNet investigation revealed significant compromises at Tibetan-exile and Indian targets. It\nwas also found that Indian government related entities, both in India proper and throughout the world, had\nbeen thoroughly compromised. These included computers at Indian embassies in Belgium, Serbia, Germany,\nItaly, Kuwait, the United States, Zimbabwe, and the High Commissions of India in Cyprus and the United\nKingdom. During the GhostNet investigation we had discovered evidence of multiple infections for which the\ninformation available was incomplete, and to which we wanted to return for follow up. In particular, we found\none piece of malware uploading sensitive documents. Another report published soon after Tracking GhostNet,\nentitled “The Gh0st in the Shell: Network Security in the Himalayas,” analysed the network traffic of Air Jaldi,\na community WiFi network in Dharamsala, India. It found that computers in Dharamsala were connecting with\ntwo of the control servers documented in our report (Vallentin et al. 2009).\n\nWith the aim of focusing on both these wider pattern of compromises, and the hanging threads from the previous investigation, we worked with our existing approach, informed by the view that collecting data as close\nto the intended target as possible was likely to yield actionable evidence of breaches that could be followed\nthrough to their source, lead to wider pools of target sets, and yield information on the attackers.\n\nIn conducting the field research we were influenced by the Action Research (AR) literature (Lewin 1946; Curle\n1947) that has evolved since the 1940s, as well as other field-based investigation and research techniques. The\nAR field-based approach feeds into the fusion methodology that guides our overall investigatory process. It\nemploys ethical and participatory observations and structured focused interviews. We combined this grounded\nresearch with technical interrogation, including network monitoring activities. As with GhostNet, we were\nfortunate to have the cooperation of Tibetan organizations, and benefited tremendously from the willingness of\nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama and other Tibetans to share information with our investigators. As a result, for the\n_Shadow investigation we conducted primary field research in Dharamsala, India from August until December_\n2009. (Dharamsala is the location of the OHHDL as well as the TGIE).\n\nThe primary objectives of the field investigations were to research the wider patterns of compromised Indian\nand Tibetan related targets, investigate the reports of targeted malware attacks that have emerged from the\nTibetan community, and raise information and computer security awareness within the Tibetan community\nand assist in their security planning and implementation. Throughout the field investigation process, we also\ninvestigated the broader social, political, military, and intelligence context. We conducted extensive on-site\ninterviews with officials in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, the Office of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan NGOs.\nThese interviews allowed us to gain an understanding of the security practices and network infrastructure of\ncompromised locations. We also used network monitoring software during field investigations in order to collect\ntechnical data from compromised computer systems and perform an initial analysis to confirm the existence\nof malware and the transfer of information between compromised computers and command and control servers. The network monitoring tools allowed us to collect samples from compromised computers and identify\ncommand and control servers used by the attackers. The network monitoring was undertaken with the explicit\nconsent of the Tibetan organizations.\n\nWhile monitoring the network traffic of a local NGO, Common Ground, as part of an Internet security audit,\ntraffic from a local WiFi mesh network, TennorNet was also captured, revealing malicious activity. An anomaly\nwas detected when analyzing this traffic: computers in Dharamsala were beaconing or checking in with a command and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43) located in Chongqing, PRC. The location of Chongqing\nis contextually interesting as it has a high concentration of Triads — well known Asian-based organized criminal networks — who have significant connections to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party\n(Lam 2009) The Triads have extended their traditional criminal activities to include technology enabled crime\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as “computer software piracy and credit card forgery and fraud” (Choo 2008).\n\nAn investigation revealed that the computer on TennorNet generating the malicious traffic belonged to Mr. Serta\nTsultrim, a Tibetan Member of Parliament, editor of of the weekly Tibetan language newspaper Tibet Express\nand the director of the Khawa Karpo Tibet Culture Centre. Tsultrim is also the coordinator of the Association of\nTibetan Journalists (ATJ). We probed for his threat perception, and who he felt might be targeting him and why.\nWe sought to establish his perception of what documents and correspondence might be particularly sensitive.\nTsultrim was particularly concerned about this network being compromised.\n\nFollowing the discovery of this compromise, we approached the OHHDL and formally requested permission\nto audit network traffic to determine whether we could identify similar beacon packets associated with the\ncommand and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43). A representative of OHHDL agreed that we could\naccess the office network under an agreement similar to the initial GhostNet investigation. In consultation with\nOHHDL staff, we focused our attention on the desktop machines that were most likely to be compromised, and\ncommenced a network tap of a number of workstations. Interestingly, it was one of these workstations that\nwas the origin of the GhostNet investigation, where we had observed sensitive documents being exfiltrated in\nSeptember 2008. Almost immediately we identified malicious traffic connecting with the command and control\nserver (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43).\n\nOur next step was to refer to the management interface in the ICSA-certified Cyberoam firewall that the OHHDL\nhad installed in their network as part of their extensive upgrading of security procedures in the wake of the\n_GhostNet breach. We isolated all outbound traffic to the command and control server and identified any other_\nmachines on the office Local Area Network that were currently, or had recently, been communicating with the\ncommand and control server. From the Cyberoam interface we were able to identify one other machine that was\ncompromised. We proceeded to tap the traffic from this machine and began to see domain names associated\nwith the distributed social media command and control channels that we would later identify in the lab as part\nof the command and control infrastructure. Similarly, the lab investigation was able to reconstruct the documents\nthat were exfiltrated from OHHDL machines and we were able to brief OHHDL on the extent of the breach.\n\n##### 2.3 Technical Investigative Activities\n\nOur technical investigation was comprised of several interrelated components:\n\n� **DNS Sinkholing - Through registering expired domain names previously used in cyber espionage attacks as**\ncommand and control servers, we were are able to observe incoming connections from still-compromised\ncomputers. This allowed us to collect information on the methods of the attackers as well as the nature of\nthe victims.\n\n� **Malware Analysis - We collected malware samples from a variety of attacks that allowed us to determine**\nthe exploits the attackers used, the theme used to lure targets into executing the malware, as well as the\ncommand and control servers used by the attackers. We also analysed additional malware found on servers\nunder the control of the attackers. Malware samples consisted primarily of the files with the PDF, DOC, PPT\nand EXE file extensions.\n\n� **Command and Control Server Topography - We were able to map out the command and control infrastruc-**\nture of the attackers by linking information from the sinkhole, the field investigations and the malware analysis. We collected the domain names, URL paths and IP addresses used by the attackers. This allowed us to find\nlinks between our research and other command and control servers observed in other attacks in prior research\n\n\n-----\n\n� **Victim Identification - We were able to identify victims that the attackers had compromised by analyzing**\nsinkhole server connections, recovering documents that had been exfiltrated, and viewing control panels\nused by the attackers to direct the compromised computers.\n\n� **Data Recovery - We were able to retrieve documents that had been sent to drop zones from victim systems**\nand stolen by the attackers.\n\nWe carried out this research carefully, guided by principles rooted in the computer security field (Burstein 2008;\nCooke et al. 2005; Stone-Gross et al. 2009; Smith and Toppel 2009). Our aim was to understand and document\nthe activities of the attackers as well as gather enough information to enable notification of those who had been\ncompromised. The principles that guided our field and technical investigations include the following:\n\n� We collected network data in the field from computers that had been compromised by malware with the\nconsent of the owners of the computers.\n\n� We monitored command and control infrastructure and recovered exfiltrated data in order to gather enough\ninformation to understand the activities of the attackers and obtain enough information to enable notification of the victims before moving to notify the service providers and hosting companies to seek to have the\nnetworks shut down.\n\n� We worked with government authorities in multiple jurisdictions to notify those who had been compromised and to take down the attacker’s command and control infrastructure.\n\n� We were careful to store and handle all of the data we collected in a secure manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART 3: Mapping the Shadows in the Cloud\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order for us to begin to map the Shadows in the Cloud, it was important for us to have clear starting points.\nThe first and easiest starting point that we identified was to look back at what was related to and still operational from the previous Tracking GhostNet report. We focused primarily on the domains described in GhostNet\nand set out to see what we could learn from them in their current state. The second was to continue collecting\nand analyzing information on attacks gleaned from field research and reports that were shared with us by thirdparties. Each of these starting points branched off from one another and crossed paths in various ways, revealing at least two distinct cyber espionage networks.\n\nWe previously mentioned that a large portion of the domain names mentioned in Tracking GhostNet went offline\nfollowing the initial report. As a result, several of the domain names described in it were abandoned. The domains ultimately expired and were available for re-registration. This gave us the opportunity to take over these\ndomains and monitor any connections that might come to them. Doing this allowed us to see connections from\nvictims that were still infected, and learn more about how the command and control server was configured. The\nShadowserver Foundation has utilized this technique for a long time (Higgins 2008).\n\nThe investigation was broadened further when field research by the Information Warfare Monitor crossed paths\nwith research being done by the Shadowserver Foundation. The field research revealed that a computer system\nin the OHHDL had been compromised by at least two different types of malware associated with targeted\nmalware intrusions. Based on our understanding of the malware, the domains and on-going research, we assess\nthat this compromise also involved at least two different cyber espionage groups and potentially even a third\none. Analysis of several malware components and their associated command and control servers ultimately led\nto the discovery of an accessible drop zone for documents being siphoned off compromised systems.\n\nThe attackers’ command and control infrastructure is a critical component of maintaining persistent access to\ncompromised computers. Through this infrastructure, the attackers issue commands to the compromised machines as well as exfiltrate data to drop zones or to the command and control servers themselves. By carefully\nexamining the relationships between command and control servers we were able to map out the extent of one\nsuch network and link it with other similar malware networks.\n\nThis report focuses on only one of these networks, one that we have named the Shadow network. This is a\ncomplex network that leveraged social networking websites, webmail providers, free hosting providers and\nservices from some of the largest companies on the Internet as disposable command and control locations.\nThe first layer of control used blogs, newsgroups, and social networking services to maintain persistent control\nas these system are unlikely to be detected as malicious. As compromised computers accessed these services,\nthey received another command and control location, often located on free web hosting providers. The command and control servers on the free hosting services are often disabled over time – most likely due to reports\nof malicious activity. When the command and control servers on free web hosting services were disabled, the\ncompromised systems would receive commands from the social networking layer and then beacon (i.e., attempt\na connection) to a more stable inner core of dedicated systems located in the PRC. Unlike the command and\ncontrol servers on free web hosting services, these dedicated servers hosted in the PRC have proven to be quite\nstable over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.1 Analysis of Data while in the Field\n\nDuring the field investigation we collected samples of network traffic from computers at the OHHDL and other\nTibetan-related locations. Inspection of network traffic from these computers revealed that at least three of them\nwere compromised and were communicating with the same set of command and control servers. The traffic\nanalysis revealed that these systems were all connecting to the domain jdusnemsaz.com. At the time it resolved\nto the IP address 119.84.4.43, which is assigned to China Telecom in the province of Chongqing, PRC. The commands sent by the command and control server were identical to malware we found at the Tibetan NGO Drewla\nand the OHHDL during our GhostNet investigation a year earlier, although were not part of the network that\nwas described in that initial report.\n\nThere is a similarity between the commands sent by the command and control server jdusnemsaz.com and\na previously identified control server, lookbytheway.net. In both cases, the network traffic captured from the\ncompromised computers revealed that the malware was exfiltrating sensitive documents.\n\nTable 1: Command and Control: Similarities with previous attacks\n\n**OHHDL (T)** **OHHDL (D)** **TIBETAN MP** **Drewla**\n**Nov 2009** **Nov 2009** **Oct 2009** **Sep 2008**\n\njdusnemsaz.com jdusnemsaz.com jdusnemsaz.com lookbytheway.net\n119.84.4.43 119.84.4.43 119.84.4.43 221.5.250.98\n\n/two/zq2009/index.php /two/zq2009/index.php /two/zq2009/index.php /cgi-bin/NQueryFileop\nNQueryFileop NQueryFileop NQueryFileop NQueryFileop\n\nFurther analysis of the network traffic also revealed that at least one of the systems was infected with additional\nmalware not associated with the aforementioned command and control servers. The system was attempting\nDNS resolutions of multiple hostnames. Two of the hostnames resolved to IP addresses but were not available\nwhen the system attempted to communicate to them. The other hostname did not resolve at all.\n\nThe failed DNS resolution was for www.assam2008.net, which is a domain that has been used by a different\ngroup of attackers in the past in conjunction with the Enfal trojan, and suggests a limited connection between\nthe current malware under investigation and malware used in previous attacks on other targets. This domain\nname was available for registration and was added to our ongoing sinkhole project.\n\nWhile recording network traffic in the field, we observed the attackers removing two senstive documents from\nthe OHHDL (see fig. 1, page 15). The data was compressed using CAB, split into 100kb chunks when necessary, encoded with base64, and then uploaded to a command and control server. In this case, data was being\nuploaded to c2etejs.com, which is hosted on the same IP address (119.84.4.43) as jdusnemsaz.com.\n\nWe reconstructed the documents that were exfiltrated from the OHHDL: “letters - current.doc” and “letters - master\n2009.doc (see fig. 2, page 15).” The documents contained over 1,500 letters sent from the Dalai Lama’s office\nbetween January and November 2009. While many of the letters are perfunctory — responses to various invitations\nand interview requests — they allow the attackers to collect information on anyone contacting the Dalai Lama’s\noffice. Moreover, there are some communications contained within these documents that could be considered sensitive, such as communications between the OHHDL and Offices of Tibet around the world. Some communications\ncontain generic information of the Dalai Lama’s travelling details including schedule of appearances – but very\n\n|OHHDL (T) Nov 2009|OHHDL (D) Nov 2009|TIBETAN MP Oct 2009|Drewla Sep 2008|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|jdusnemsaz.com 119.84.4.43|jdusnemsaz.com 119.84.4.43|jdusnemsaz.com 119.84.4.43|lookbytheway.net 221.5.250.98|\n|/two/zq2009/index.php NQueryFileop|/two/zq2009/index.php NQueryFileop|/two/zq2009/index.php NQueryFileop|/cgi-bin/NQueryFileop NQueryFileop|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1:\n\nA screen capture of a sensitive document being uploaded to a command and control server.\n\nFigure 2:\n\nThe Word Documents Exfiltrated from the OHHDL\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.2 Technical Investigation\n\nDuring the technical investigation we examined the data collected from the field, third-party sources, and from\nour DNS sinkhole project in order to determine the attack vectors used to exploit and compromise the victims.\nWhile we were unable to determine how any one individual computer came to be compromised, we documented a variety of exploits used by the attackers. We mapped out the broader command and control infrastructure\nby discovering new pieces of malware located on servers that we identified, and catalogued any new servers\nthat these instances of malware were configured with. We also looked at domains that were co-hosted on the\nsame servers we had already identified, and used searches to identify Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu\nBlogs, blog.com, and Yahoo! Mail accounts that were misused by the attackers to update compromised computers with new command and control locations. We also discovered a panel or listing of compromised computers.\nDuring our investigation into one of the servers we made a significant discovery: we were able to recover data\nthat was being exfiltrated by the attackers from compromised computers. These documents were only available\non the command and control server for a short time after being uploaded by the compromised systems, as the\nattackers frequently removed them at irregular time intervals.\n\n###### 3.2.1 Attack Vectors / Malware\n\nVictims of cyber espionage are often specifically targeted by the attacker and not by happenstance. While it is\npossible for a cyber criminal to mass-distribute malware across the Internet with specific intent to compromise\na select set of individuals or organizations, it is not likely to be the most effective tool for the intended job. The\ndifferences in approaches, based on an analysis of tools and kits, can therefore provide some insight into the\nbranching of cyber espionage from cyber crime, or at least help distinguish more “connected” attackers from\n“less connected” ones. The varying levels of sophistication in tools, research and delivery set these actors apart,\ncan make them more or less effective, and establish their level of connection within the underground community. A very sophisticated attacker, for example, will likely be part of a network in the criminal underground\nthat has access to the latest exploits and kits that generate files with exploits to install their malicious payload.\nThese kits and files are not readily available to the average cyber criminal. A slightly less sophisticated attacker\nmight have access to the same kits and exploits once the vulnerability has been publicly disclosed, but prior to\nthere being a security patch issued for them. While from time to time various methods of generating malicious\nPDFs and other document types will appear on websites like the Metasploit (www.metasploit.com) and milw0rm (www.milw0rm.com), the vast majority of these exploits and kits are not available publicly.\n\nThe ability to successfully compromise a target relies on more than just code designed to exploit vulnerabilities\nin software – it requires “exploiting the human element” as well (Nolan and Levesque 2005). The digital traces\nindividuals leave behind on the Internet can be used to manipulate trust, and are used by attackers to encourage\ntargets to execute malicious code on their systems. The first phase of a targeted attack usually involves an\n“information acquisition phase,” in which information on potential targets is compiled from a variety of public\nsources, including social and professional networking sites, conference proceedings, academic papers and project\ninformation, in order to generate a profile of the target (Smith and Toppel 2009).\n\nTargeted malware attacks often leverage publicly available information to make their social engineering attempts\nmore plausible. Individuals are much more likely to become victims of targeted attacks if malware is sent to\nthem from what appears to be an acquaintance or a colleague (Jagatic et al. 2007). Targeted malware attacks\nare, in many cases, personalised at the individual or organizational level. Moreover, an attacker may leverage\nthe credentials of a previously compromised acquaintance to add increased levels of legitimacy to the attack. As\n\n\n-----\n\nresulting in the attackers gaining full control.\n\nTypically, a user receives an email, possibly appearing to be from someone that they know who is a real person\nwithin his or her organization, with some text — sometimes specific, sometimes generic — that urges the user\nto open an attachment (or visit a web site), usually a PDF or Microsoft Office document (e.g., DOC, PPT, XLS\nand others). These attacks may be spoofed or even come from the real email account of someone else who\nhas fallen victim to a similar attack, in what can be called a man-in-the-mailbox attack (Markoff and Barboza\n2010). If the user opens the attachment with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader or Microsoft Office (other\ntypes of software are also being exploited) and no other mitigations are in place, their computer will likely be\ncompromised (F-Secure 2010). A clean version of the document is typically embedded in the malicious file and\nis opened upon successful exploitation, so as not to arouse suspicion of the recipient. What is done next is then\nonly limited to the imagination and abilities of the attacker.\n\nIn a recent report, Symantec’s Message Labs revealed that the bulk of the targeted email attacks that they\nhave studied originates from the PRC (28.2%), Romania (21.1%) and the United States (13.8%). Leveraging\nbusiness-related information or popular topics in the news, the attackers largely target those with a “a high or\nmedium ranking seniority” within an organization. The most freguently targeted individuals include defence\npolicy experts, diplomatic missions, and human rights activists and researchers (Symantec 2010). The antivirus\ndetection for these documents is usually relatively low, and if the exploit is a 0day — an exploit for which there\nis no fix from the vendor available — the chances of compromise are very good.\n\nIn the attacks documented in this report, the user’s computer checks in with a command and control server\nafter it is compromised. Our attackers used free services from various providers to instruct infected systems to\nbeacon to new command and control servers that were setup and fully managed by them. This check-in or beaconing activity is conducted using an HTTP connection and blends in with normal web traffic. When beaconing\nthe compromised computer sends some information, usually its IP address and operating system information,\nand receives a command which it then executes. At this point the attacker has full control of the user’s system.\nThe attacker can steal documents, email and send other data, or force the compromised computer to download\nadditional malware and possibly use the infected computer as a mechanism to exploit the victim’s contacts\nor other computers on the target network. In our examination of the network, it appeared systems were most\nfrequently instructed to upload documents and download additional executables.\n\n###### 3.2.2 Malicious Documents and Command and Controls\n\nWhile we only have limited insight into the motivations and methods of the attackers, we believe they infected\nvictims primarily via email using social engineering techniques to convince their victims to open malicious file\nattachments, as described above. The people behind the Shadow attacks used a variety of exploits and filetypes\nto compromise their victims. We observed the group using PDF, PPT, and DOC file formats to exploit Adobe\nAcrobat and Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word 2003 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2003. The themes of their attacks\nappear to involve topics that would likely be of interest to the Indian and Tibetan communities. This can be\nobserved through the file names of the malicious exploit files, as well as looking at the clean or non-malicious\nfiles they then open after exploitation.\n\nWe were able to obtain dozens of exploit files that were used by the attackers when targeting their victims.\nThe Microsoft Word 2003 and PowerPoint 2003 files were mostly older exploits, which have been circulating in\nthe underground hacker community for some time. The PDF files, on the other hand, took advantage of much\nmore recent exploits at the time of their use We observed them using PDF files that exploited CVEs 2009 0927\n\n\n-----\n\n2009-2990, and 2009-4324 within a few weeks or months of the vulnerability being first patched. Our research\ndid not reveal them using exploits that were 0day at the time, but we only have limited insight into their attacks\nand may have easily not been privy to information from such attacks at the time. It is also worth noting that the\nexploits they used in their attacks are not generated from freely available tools or publicly posted exploit code.\nOur attacks appear to have some level of access to PPT, DOC, and PDF exploit generation kits that allow them\nto create exploit files on the fly that install their malware.\n\nTable 2 below is a sampling of each of the malicious document file formats that we observed and analyzed that\nwere used by these attackers in targeted attacks.\n\nTable 2: Malicious Document File Formats\n\nDate 2009-08-11\n\nFilename Sino-India_Border.ppt\n\nFile Type PPT\n\nTarget Microsoft PowerPoint 2003\n\nMD5 c35b3ea71370cb5bfe2b523c17705ecb\n\nC2 (initial) Stage 1: http://groups.google.com/group/estolide/feed/rss_v2_0_msgs.xml\n\nC2 (cmd) Stage 2: http://www.idefesvn.com/test/ieupdate.php\n\nDate 2010-01-08\n\nFilename Schedule2010_of_HHDL.pdf\n\nFile Type PDF\n\nTargeted Adobe Acrobat/Reader (CVE-2009-0927)\n\nMD5 dfc76b1f94ec13cbd8ae3b3371f23841\n\nC2 (initial) Stage 1: http://groups.google.com/group/tagyalten/feed/rss_v2_0_msgs.xml\n\nC2 (cmd) Stage 2: http://www.c2etejs.com/kk/all.php\n\nDate 2009-08-20\n\nFilename China_should_break_up_India.doc\n\nFile Type DOC\n\nTarget Microsoft Word 2003\n\nMD5 17a26441eb2be5efb8344e53cbd7d499\n\nC2 (initial) Stage 1: http://hiok125.blog.com\n\nC2 (cmd) Stage 2: http://www.erneex.com/boboshell/all.php\n\n###### 3.2.3 Malicious Binaries found on Command and Controls\n\nDuring our investigation we were able to acquire twenty-seven malicious binaries used by the attackers.

It is also used by law enforcement and many others\nwho require anonymity.\n\nIn 2007, a computer security researcher, Dan Egerstad collected data and email login credentials for a variety of\nembassies around the world by monitoring the traffic exiting from Tor exit nodes, an anonymous communications\nnetwork. He was able to obtain user names and passwords for a variety of email accounts, and recovered data associated with the Dalai Lama’s office as well as India’s Defence Research and Development Organization (Zetter 2007a).\n\nTor does not automatically encrypt everything that a user does online. Unless the end-point of a connection\nis encrypted, the data passing through an exit node in the Tor network will be in plain text. Since anyone can\noperate a Tor exit node, it is possible for a malicious user to intercept the plain text communications passing\nthrough it. However, Egerstad believes that the entities whose credentials and data he was able to collect were not\nusing Tor themselves. Rather, he concluded that attackers may have been using the Tor network as a mechanism\nto exfiltrate data:\n\n_The embassy employees were likely not using Tor nor even knew what Tor was. Instead, we suspected_\n_that the traffic he sniffed belonged to someone who had hacked the accounts and was eavesdropping on_\n_them via the Tor network. As the hacked data passed through Egerstad’s Tor exit nodes, he was able to_\n_d it_ _ll (Z tt_ _2007b)_\n\n|Filename|setup.exe|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|7e2e37c78bc594342e498d6299c19158|\n|C2|sonamtenphel@yahoo.com|\n|C2|www.indexindian.com|\n|Download|sites.google.com/site/wwwfox99/Home/|\n|Filename|20090930165916978|\n|MD5|abef3f0396688bfca790f8bbedac3e0d|\n|C2|zhengwai@yahoo.com|\n\n|Filename|20091221165850243|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|2ca46bcdfda08adc94ab41d3ed049ab6|\n|C2|cxingpeng.byethost9.com|\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 5: Enfal\n\nFilename 20090924152410520\n\nMD5 9f0b3d0672425081cb7a988691535cbf\n\nC2 www.indexnews.org\n\nOn one of the command and control severs, we also discovered that the attackers were using Enfal, a well\nknown Trojan. The malware connected to www.indexnews.org and requested the following file paths: /cgi-bin/\nOwpq4.cgi and /httpdocs/mm/[HOSTNAME]_20090610/Cmwhite. We explore the broader connections and\nsignificance of use of Enfal in section 3.3.1 below.\n\n##### 3.3 Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nFigure 3:\n\nThe Shadow Network’s Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nThis Palantir screen capture demonstrates the integration of social networking and blogging platforms (green), domain names (blue) and web servers (red).\n\n|Filename|20090924152410520|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|9f0b3d0672425081cb7a988691535cbf|\n|C2|www.indexnews.org|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers’ command and control infrastructure consists of three interrelated components. The first\ncomponent consists of intermediaries that simply contain links, which can be updated, to command and control\nservers. During our investigation we found that such intermediaries included Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot,\nBaidu Blogs, and blog.com. The attackers also used Yahoo! Mail accounts as a command and control component\nin order to send new malicious binaries to compromised computers. On at least one occasion the attackers also\nused Google Pages to host malware. To be clear, the attackers were misusing these systems, not exploiting any\nvulnerability in these platforms. In total, we found three Twitter accounts, five Yahoo! Mail accounts, twelve\nGoogle Groups, eight Blogspot blogs, nine Baidu blogs, one Google Sites and sixteen blogs on blog.com that were\nbeing used as part of the attacker’s infrastructure. The attackers simply created accounts on these services and\nused them as a mechanism to update compromised computers with new command and control server information. Even a vigilant network administrator looking for rogue connections exiting the network may overlook\nsuch connections as they are routine and generally considered to be safe web sites. The use of social networking platforms, blogs and other services offered by trusted companies allows the attackers to maintain control\nof compromised computers even if direct connections to the command and control servers are blocked at the\nfirewall level. The compromised computers can simply be updated through these unblocked intermediaries to\npoint to a new, as yet unknown, control server.\n\nSuch techniques are not new per se, and nothing in and of itself was invented by the Shadow attackers that had\nnot been done before (See Box 3). Rather, the attackers are learning from the experiences of others and adapting\nthe techniques to meet their needs. By using these kind of intermediaries and platforms, the attackers are able\nto conceal their activities and maintain a resilient command and control infrastructure. In the Shadow case, the\nattackers did not rely on only one social networking, cloud computing or Web 2.0 service, but rather used a\nvariety of such services in combination with one another.\n\nBox 3: Social Network Sites as Control Channels for Malware Networks\n\nThe use of social networking sites as elements of command and control for malware networks is not novel. The attackers\nleverage the normal operation of these systems in order to maintain control over compromised system. In 2009,\nresearchers found that Twitter, Jaiku, Tumblr, Google Groups, Google AppEngine and Facebook had all been used as the\ncommand and control structure for malware. In August 2009, Arbor Networks’ Jose Nazario found that Twitter was being\nused as a command and control component for a malware network. In this case, the malware was an information stealer\nfocused on extracting banking credentials from compromised computers located mostly in Brazil. Twitter was not the only\nchannel being used by the attackers. They also used accounts on Jaiku and Tumblr (Nazario 2009a). Furthermore, Arbor\nNetworks found another instance of malware that used the Google AppEngine to deliver malicious URLs to compromised\ncomputers (Nazario 2009b). The Unmask Parasites blog found that obfuscated scripts embedded in compromised web\nsites used the Twitter API to obscure their activities. While the method was clever, the code was unreliable and appeared\nto have been abandoned by the attackers (Unmask Parasites 2009). Symantec found that Google Groups were being\nused as command and control for another instance of malware. In this case, a private Google group was used by the\nattackers to send commands to compromised computers which then uploaded their responses to the same Group\n(Symantec 2009a) Symantec also found an instance of malware that used Facebook status messages as a mechanism\nof command and control. (Symantec 2009b). The use of these social networking and Web 2.0 tools allows the attackers\nto leverage the normal operation of these tools to obscure the command and control functions of malware.\n\nOne platform leveraged by the attackers in particularly interesting ways was the webmail service provided by\nYahoo!. We discovered five Yahoo! Mail accounts being used by the attackers as a component of command and\ncontrol. Once a computer was compromised, the malware connected to the Yahoo! Mail accounts using Yahoo’s\nAPI and created a unique folder in the Inbox of the mail account, into which an email was inserted containing\nthe computer’s name, operating system and IP address. The attacker would then send an email to the account\ncontaining a command or a command along with additional malware as an attachment The next time that a\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised computer checks in with the email account, it then downloads and executes the malicious attachment. Upon execution, the compromised computer placed an acknowledgement mail in the Yahoo! Mail Inbox.\nThe email addresses used by the attackers were:\n\n� zhengwai@yahoo.com\n� wwwfoxperter@yahoo.com\n� swwwfox@yahoo.in\n� ctliliwoy5@yahoo.com\n� sonamtenphel@yahoo.com\n\nThe attackers used these Yahoo! Mail accounts as command and control in conjunction with traditional mechanisms, such as HTTP connections to web servers. Therefore, even if the traditional web-based command and\ncontrol channels were shut down the attacker could retain control using the Yahoo! Mail mechanism.\n\nMoreover, the web-based component of command and control was also resilient. We found that command and\ncontrol servers were being operated on free hosting sites and on free domain providers such co.tv and net.ru.\nWe found command and control servers on the following free web hosting providers:\n\n� byethost9.com\n� 6te.net\n� justfree.com\n� sqweebs.com\n� yourfreehosting.net\n� kilu.de\n� 5gighost.com\n� hostaim.com\n� 5webs.net\n� 55fast.com\n� surge8.com\n\nIn addition we found servers on free domains provided by co.tv and net.ru. All of the IP addresses to which the\nsub-domains of these control servers resolve are in the United States, with the exception of one that is hosted in\nGermany. The command and control servers on free hosting are:\n\n� changemore.hostaim.com\n� choesang.5gighost.com\n� freegate.kilu.de\n� freesp.6te.net\n� hardso.yourfreehosting.net\n� scjoinsign.sqweebs.com\n� tshkung01.justfree.com\n� www.99fm.co.tv\n� www.j5yr.co.tv\n� zcagua.6te.net\n� cxingpeng.byethost9.com\n� lobsang.net.ru\n� freesp 55fast com\n\n\n-----\n\n� iloveusy.justfree.com\n� zenob.surge8.com\n� bigmouse.5webs.net\n\nAs some of the free hosting accounts became unavailable, the attacker’s modified blog posts on the intermediaries to point to new command and control servers, most often to servers that appear to be the core of the\nnetwork. The core command and control servers reside on domain names that appear to be registered by the\nattackers themselves and on dedicated servers. These control servers are:\n\n� c2etejs.com\n� erneex.com\n� idefesvn.com\n� jdusnemsaz.com\n� peose.com\n� indexnews.org\n� lookbytheway.net\n� microsoftnews.net\n� tibetcommunication.com\n� intoplink.com\n� indexindian.com\n\nAll of these domain names are hosted in the PRC.\n\nThe first group of domain names (c2etejs.com, erneex.com, idefesvn.com, jdusnemsaz.com, peose.com) were\nall hosted on the same IP address ­— 119.84.4.43 — but moved to another IP address ­— 210.51.7.155 — which\nis associated with the more well known domain names indexindian.com and tibetcommunication.com. The\ndomains indexnews.org and lookbytheway.net are on 61.188.87.27, microsoftnews.net is on 61.188.87.79, and\nintoplink.com is on 60.160.182.113. The domains indexindian.com, indexnews.org and lookbytheway.net are\nwell known malware domain names associated with more than one instance of malware.\n\n###### 3.3.1 Malware Connections: Enfal\n\nOne of our objectives in this report was to explore the broader ecosystem of malware. While analysis of individual\nattacks may yield interesting data, a broader understanding of connections between malware networks allows us\nto better understand the methods, targets and capabilities of the attackers. Based on the malware tools and\ncommand and control infrastructure collected as part of the Shadows in the Cloud investigation we were able to\ndraw connections between the Shadow network and at least two other, possibly affiliated, malware networks.\n\nWhen grouping malware networks together we interpret relationships between the command and control\ninfrastructures, characteristics of the malware, attack vectors and exploits used, and any identifying information\nleft behind by the attackers. This allows us to track the activities of similar yet distinct groups of attackers over\ntime. More importantly, this historical perspective allows us to apply a granular level of analysis when investigating attacks, rather than simply grouping attackers and malware together by the country of origin. When\ngrouping malware we focus on:\n\n� IP address relationships - the historical relationship between command and control domains that resolve to\n\n\n-----\n\n� Malware connection relationships - malware found on one command and control server that connects to a\ndifferent command and control server.\n\n� Malware file path relationships - the presence of distinctive file paths on multiple command and control\nservers.\n\nThere are limitations to this approach. For example, multiple attackers could operate on a common infrastructure, perhaps supplied by a group that specialises in malicious hosting or selling registered domain names to\nbe used as command and control servers. Different groups of attackers could use the same, or very similar,\nmalware. However, when the malware is not publicly available or for sale, its use remains limited.\nDuring the Shadow investigation we found the Enfal trojan among the instances of malware used by the attackers. The Enfal trojan is not widely available and appears to be in use by affiliated malware networks that\nsometimes share a common command and control infrastructure.\n\nIn fact, domain names that have been used as Enfal command and control servers by separate, but possibly\naffiliated, attackers — assam2008.net, msnxy.net, sysroots.net, womanld.com, womannana.com, lookbyturns.\ncom, macfeeresponse.com and macfeeresponse.org — have now been incorporated into our sinkhole project.\nThis allows us to observe compromised computers that are still checking in with the command and control\nservers as well as the file paths being requested. In some cases, we can obtain the names of documents located on the compromised computers. These domain names are associated with Enfal and can also be linked\nto the active command and control servers in the Shadow network through common command and control\nserver IP addresses.\n\nAnother group of attackers that also used the Enfal trojan were documented in 2008 by Maarten Van\nHorenbeeck. He published information concerning his investigation into the targeted malware attacks which\nincluded the use of the Enfal Trojan dating back to 2007. Van Horenbeeck systematically documented a series\nof targeted attacks and clearly articulated the methodology of the attackers, one of which is now commonplace.\nThe attackers leverage social engineering tactics to entice the target into clicking on a malicious link or email\nattachment. The malware then exploits a vulnerability in the user’s client side software, such as a browser,\nMicrosoft Word, Adobe Reader and so on, and begins communicating with a command and control server. Enfal\nis recognisable due to the consistent filenames the malware requests from the command and control server,\nmost notably “/cgi-bin/owpq4.cgi”. Van Horenbeeck identified domain names used by Enfal, *.bluewinnt.\ncom and *.ggsddup.com, which are still in use today (Van Horenbeeck 2008a; Van Horenbeeck 2008b; Van\nHorenbeeck 2007).\n\nWhile we were unable to find any instances of common command and control infrastructure between the Enfal\nnetwork that Van Horenbeeck documented, the methods and tools of these attackers and the Shadow network\nare very similar. The common use of the Enfal Trojan suggests that the attackers may be exchanging tools and\ntechniques. The profile of the victims from two separate Enfal-based networks in our DNS sinkhole suggest\nthat the attackers have an interest in compromising similar sets of targets. Finally, the failed DNS resolution for\nwww.assam2008.net found on a computer at the OHHDL also compromised by the Shadow network indicates a\npossibly closer connection, or that they at least have both common tools and target sets.\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART 4: Targets and Effects\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.1 Compromised Victims: The Evidence\n\nMistakes on the part of the attackers allowed us to view the attackers’ list of victims at four command and\ncontrol locations. In addition, we were able to recover exfiltrated data from two locations. This provided us with\na snapshot of the computers that have been compromised by the attacks. Thus, this is not a complete list of all\nthose compromised by this attacker. Rather, it is simply those checking in with or uploading data to the portions\nof the network that we were able to view. Moreover, there was considerable overlap between different methods\nof command and control, with individual computers checking in at multiple locations. Therefore, we do not\nhave consistent data across all compromised computers. There are two categories of victims: those for whom\nwe only have technical identifying information, such as IP addresses; and those from whom we have recovered\nexfiltrated data but for whom we do not have IP addresses. In cases where we do not have IP addresses, the\nidentity of the victim is determined from the contextual information found within the exfiltrated data itself.\n\nWe obtained information on victims from:\n\n� a web-based interface that lists cursory information on compromised computers located on one command\nand control server;\n\n� text files in web-accessible directories on three command and control servers that list detailed information\non compromised computers;\n\n� information obtained from email accounts used for command and control of compromised computers\n\n� information obtained from one command and control server from which we retrieved exfiltrated documents\n(but not necessarily technical identifying information);\n\n� information obtained from our DNS sinkhole.\n\nThe primary method of identification used in this section is based upon the IP address of the compromised\ncomputer. We looked up the associated IP address in all five Regional Internet Registries (RiR) in order to identify the country and network to which the IP address is assigned. We then performed a reverse Domain Name\nSystem (DNS) look-up on each IP address. DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses;\nreverse DNS is a system that translates an IP address into a domain name. This can potentially provide additional information about the entity that has been assigned a particular IP address. If we discovered a domain\nname, we then looked up its registration in WHOIS, which is a public database of all domain name registrations\nand provides information about who registered the domain name.\n\nIt was possible to identify the geographic location of the compromised computer at the country level as well as\nthe network to which the IP address was assigned. However, in most cases there was little information in the\nRiRs pertaining to the exact identity of the compromised entity. Where possible, we note the entity identified by\ndata obtained from the RiRs.\n\nThe following list of compromised computers was generated by parsing information from unique victims, not\nsolely IP addresses. The attackers assign the compromised computer a name based on the host name of the computer, which allows us to identify unique victims rather than relying only on IP addresses. In fact, several of the\nunique victims have multiple IP addresses associated with them, sometimes spanning multiple countries. Here we\nhave generated a geographic breakdown based on the first IP addresses recorded for each compromised computer\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4:\n\nLocations of Compromised Computers in the Shadow Network\n\nWhile there is considerable geographic diversity, there is a high concentration of compromised computers\nlocated in India. However, we were only able to identify two of the compromised entities:\n\n� Embassy of India, United States\n� Embassy of Pakistan, United States\n\n###### 4.1.1 Sinkhole\n\nA DNS sinkhole server is a system that is designed to take requests from a botnet or infected systems and record\nthe incoming information. The sinkhole server is not under the control of the malware authors and can be used\nto gain an understanding of a botnet’s operation. There are a few different techiques that are used to sinkhole\nbotnet traffic. The easiest method is to simply register an expired domain that was previously used to control\nvictim systems. Being able to do this generally indicates the botnet operator has lost control of the domain, forgotten to renew it, or that the botnet has been abandoned. Another method focuses on reverse-engineering the\nmalware to determine if it has “fail over” command and control servers or special methods to compute future\ndomains. This may require that a domain name generation algorithm be discovered and that one must register\nthe domain names before the attacker does (Stone-Gross et al. 2009).\n\nDuring the GhostNet investigation we found that a computer at the OHHDL was compromised by both the\n_GhostNet and what we are now calling the Shadow network. We had a list of serveral domains that were_\nexpiring that we had linked to attacks against OHHDL. We were able to register several of these domain names\ni d t th i f ti b t th t k’ d d t l i f t t i ti th d\n\n\n-----\n\nand victim systems. We were able to register and monitor four of the domain names mentioned in Tracking\n_GhostNet. In addition, we were able to register several others which we linked to the Shadow network along_\nwith one, www.assam2008.net, which we believe to be yet another separate, but possibly affiliated, network.\n\n� www.assam2008.net\n� www.msnxy.net\n� www.sysroots.net\n� www.womanld.com\n� www.womannana.com\n� www.lookbyturns.com\n� www.macfeeresponse.com\n� www.macfeeresponse.org\n\nWe were able to observe the file paths associated with malware that were requested by compromised computers. In total, we found that during this period 6,902 unique IPs requested paths associated with the malware\nthat used these hosts as command and control servers. However, counting the number of infected hosts purely\nby IP addresses is problematic. In fact, botnets are generally much smaller than the total sum of unique IP\naddresses would suggest (Stone-Gross et al. 2009; Rajab et al. 2007). This network, which is focused on stealing\ndocuments from specific targets, is expected to be small in size.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nRelationship between the DNS Sinkhole and Live Command and Control Servers\n\nThis Palantir screen shot captures the relationship between the domain names in our sinkhole (green) the web servers they were formerly hosted on (red) and\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is more notable is the distribution of compromised computers across countries.\n\nFigure 6:\n\nLocations of Compromised Computers in our Sinkhole\n\nFrom the recovered IP addresses we were able to identify the following entities of interest:\n\n� Honeywell, United States\n� New York University, United States\n� University of Western Ontario, Canada\n� High Commission of India, United Kingdom\n� Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuania\n� Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania\n� National Informatics Centre, India\n� New Delhi Railway station (*railnet.gov.in), India\n� _Times of India, India_\n� Petro IT, (reserved123.petroitg.com), India\n� Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, India\n� Commission for Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South, Pakistan\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.2 Victim Analysis on the Basis of \n#### Recovered Documents\n\nIn total we recovered data from 44 compromised computers. The documents recovered from the OHHDL were\nreconstructed from captured network traffic, while the remainder were retrieved from an open directory on\none command and control server. Only seven of the remaining 43 compromised computers (not counting the\nOHHDL computer) for which we were able to recover exfiltrated data also checked in with the same control\nserver. Therefore we can only identify the IP addresses of these seven computers. Five of these seven computers\nhave IP addresses that are assigned to India, while the remaining two are assigned to Thailand and the PRC. As\nnoted below, the Chinese IP address represents the attacks on IP addresses along with two test (junk) text files\nthat appear to have been used for testing the malware.\n\nWe determined the country and entity from which the documents were exfiltrated based on the content of the\ndocuments themselves in cases where we did not obtain an IP address. In addition, we assigned two country\ncodes to the compromised computers: one country code indicates the physical (IP) country in which the computer is located, and the second country code indicates the country of ownership. Thus a compromised computer at a foreign embassy would be assigned a country code based on its geographical region, and a second\nbased on the home country to which the foreign mission belongs.\n\nBased on geographic location, the vast majority are in India.\n\nFigure 7:\n\nLocations of Compromised Computers from which Documents were Exfiltrated\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the country of ownership, the results show an even higher number for India.\n\nFigure 8:\n\nLocations of Ownership of Exfiltrated Documents\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.3 Geographic Victim Distribution\n\nFigure 9:\n\nGeographic distribution of compromised hosts\n\nThis screen capture of Palantir’s heatmap application demonstrates the concentrations of (non-unique) IP addresses of compromised hosts. The largest\nconcentration (red) is in India.\n\n###### 4.3.1 Targets\n\nDiplomatic Missions and Government Entities\n\nDiplomatic missions and government entities exchange sensitive information, which sometimes finds its\nway onto unclassified systems. During our investigation, we recovered documents that are extremely sensitive from a national security perspective as well as documents that contain sensitive information that could\nbe exploited by an adversary for intelligence purposes. We recovered one document that appears to be an\nencrypted diplomatic correspondence, two documents classified as “SECRET”, six as “RESTRICTED”, and five\nas “CONFIDENTIAL”. These documents contain sensitive information taken from a member of the National\nSecurity Council Secretariat concerning secret assessments of India’s security situation in the states of Assam,\nManipur, Nagaland and Tripura, as well as concerning the Naxalites and Maoists. In addition, they contain\nconfidential information taken from Indian embassies regarding India’s international relations with and assessments of activities in West Africa, Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States and the Middle East, as well as\ni li ti t ffi i l d di l ti d Th tt k l filt t d d t il d\n\n\n-----\n\npersonal information regarding a member of the Directorate General of Military Intelligence. These compromises\nand the character of the data exfiltrated extends to non-governmental targets as well. Some of the academics\nand journalists that were compromised were interested in and regularly reporting on sensitive topics such as\nJammu and Kashmir.\n\nNational Security and Defence\n\nDuring our investigations we suspected that a variety of military computers had been compromised as well as\nthe computers of defence-oriented academics and journals. While none of the information obtained was classified, the documents we recovered reveal information regarding sensitive topics. Although there is public information available on these miltary projects, it indicates that the attackers managed to compromise the right set\nof individuals that may have knowledge of these systems that is not publicly known. We recovered documents\nand presentations relating to the following projects:\n\n� Pechora Missile System - an anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile system.\n� Iron Dome Missile System - a mobile missile defence system (Ratzlav-Katz 2010).\n� Project Shakti - an artillery combat command and control system (Frontier India 2009).\n\nWe also found that documents relating to network centricity (SP’s Land Forces 2008) and network-centric\nwarfare had been exfiltrated, along with documents detailing plans for intelligence fusion and technologies for\nmonitoring and analysing network data (Defence Research and Development Organisation 2009).\n\nAcademics/Journalists focused on the PRC\n\nDuring our investigations we found that a variety of academic targets had been compromised, including those at\nthe Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) as well as journalists at India Strategic defence magazine\nand FORCE magazine. The exfiltrated papers included those discussing the containment of the PRC, Chinese\nmilitary exports, and Chinese foreign policy on Taiwan and Sino-Indian relations. More specifically, there were\ndocuments that focused on ethnicity, religion and politics in Central Asia, and the links between armed groups\nand the PRC. Although the academic papers exfiltrated by the attackers are publicly available, the content of the\nmaterial indicates that the attackers managed to compromise those with a keen interest in the PRC.\n\n###### 4.3.2 Affected Institutions\n\nDuring our investigations we found that a variety of personal information belonging to individuals had been\ncompromised. This included various lists of contacts along with their personal details that could be used by the\nattackers. It also included information about travel, including air and rail tickets, receipts, invoices and other\nbilling information. In addition we found personal banking information, scans of identification documents,\njob (and other) applications, legal documents and information about ongoing court cases. The attackers also\nexfiltrated personal email communications. All of this information can be leveraged for future attacks, especially\nattacks against those within the compromised individual’s social network.\n\n� **National Security Council Secretariat, India**\nThe National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) of India is comprised of the Joint Intelligence Committee\nand is a component of the National Security Council established in 1998 along with a Strategic Policy\nGroup and an Advisory Board. The National Security Council is headed by the Prime Minister of India and\nis responsible for strategic planning in the area of national security (Subrahmanyam 2010; Indian Embassy\n1998). We assess that a computer at the NSCS was compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the\nattackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, fourteen documents, including two documents marked “SECRET ” were exfiltrated In addition to documents containing the personal and financial\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation of what appears to be the compromised individual, the exfiltrated documents focus on India’s\nsecurity situation in the states of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura as well as the Naxalites, Maoists,\nand what is referred to as “left wing extremism.”\n\n� **Diplomatic Missions, India**\nIndia maintains numerous diplomatic missions abroad that provide consular services relating to passports\nand visas as well as faciltaing trade, commerce and engaging in diplomatic relations (Indian government\n2010). We assess that computers at the Embassy of India, Kabul, the Embassy of India, Moscow, the\nConsulate General of India, Dubai, and the High Commission of India in Abuja, Nigeria were compromised\nbased on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers,\n99 documents, including what appears to be one encrypted diplomatic correspondence as well as five documents marked “RESTRICTED” and four documents marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” were exfiltrated. In addition\nto documents containing personal, financial, and travel information on embassy and diplomatic staff, the\nexfiltrated documents included numerous visa applications, passport office circulars, and country assessments and reports. Confidential visa applications from citizens of Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, the PRC,\nCroatia, Denmark, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Philippines, Senegal, Switzerland, Uganda,\nand the United Kingdom were among the exfiltrated documents.\n\n� **Military Engineer Services, India**\nThe Military Engineer Services (MES) is a government construction agency that provides services to the\nIndian Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, the MES services the government sector and civil works projects.\nWe assess that computers at the MES-Bengdubi, MES-Kolkata, MES(AF)-Bangalore, and MES-Jalandhar were\ncompromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored\nthe attackers, 78 documents were exfiltrated. While these documents included manuals and forms that would\nnot be considered sensitive, they also included documents that contained private information on personnel,\nand documents and presentations concerning the financing and scheduling of specific engineering projects.\n\n� **Military Personnel, India**\nWe assess that computers linked with the 21 Mountain Artillery Brigade in the state of Assam, the Air Force\nStation, Race Course, New Delhi and the Air Force Station, Darjipura Vadodara, Gujarat were compromised\nbased on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers,\nsixteen documents were exfiltrated. One document contained personal information on Saikorian alumni of\nthe Sainik School, Korukonda, which prepares students for entry into the National Defence Academy. One\ndocument is a detailed briefing on a live fire exercise while others pertain to surface-to-air missile systems\nand moving target indicators.\n\n� **Military Educational Institutions, India**\nWe assess that computers at the Army Institute of Technology in Pune, Maharashtra and the Military College\nof Electronics and Mechanical Engineering in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh were compromised based on\nthe documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, twentyone documents, including one marked “RESTRICTED”, were exfiltrated. There are documents and presentations detailing the finances of one of the institutions as well as personal and private information on students\nand their travel. There is also a document that describes “Project Shakti,” the Indian Army’s command and\ncontrol system for artillery (India Defence 2007).\n\n� **Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, India**\nWe assess that computers at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) were compromised based\non the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, 187\ndocuments were exfiltrated. While many of the documents were published papers from a variety of academic\nsources there were internal documents such as an overview of the IDSA research agenda minutes of\n\n\n-----\n\nmeetings for the Journal of Defence Studies, budgets and information on a variety of speakers, visitors, and\nconference participants.\n\n� **Defence-oriented publications, India**\nWe assess that computers at the India Strategic defence magazine and FORCE magazine were compromised\nbased on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers,\n58 documents were exfiltrated. While these documents include publicly accessible articles and previous\ndrafts of those articles, there is also private information regarding the contact details of subscribers and conference participants. The documents also include interviews, documents, and PowerPoint presentations from\nconferences that detail national security topics, such as network data and monitoring for national security,\nand responses to combat cyber threats.\n\n� **Corporations, India**\nWe assess that computers at YKK India Private Limited, DLF Limited, and TATA were compromised based\non the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, five\ndocuments were exfiltrated. These documents include rules overseeing busiiness travel, a presentation on\nroadmap and financial status, and an annual plan for a business partnership.\n\n� **Maritime, India**\nWe assess that computers at the National Maritime Foundation and the Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal\nCompany Limited were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period\nin which we monitored the attackers, 53 documents were exfiltrated. These documents include a summary\nof a seminar as well as numerous documents relating to specific shipping schedules, financial matters and\npersonal medical information.\n\n� **United Nations**\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is based in\nThailand and facilitates development in the Asia-Pacific region. We assess that a computer at UNESCAP has\nbeen compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. In addition to information concerning a variety of conferences and presentations, there were also internal Mission Report documents regarding\ntravel and events in the region.\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART 5: Tackling Cyber Espionage\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.1 Attribution and Cyber Crime / Cyber Espionage\n\nDuring this investigation we collected malware samples used by the attackers, which were primarily PDFs that\nexploited vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. In addition, we collected malware used by the attackers after successfully compromising a targeted system as well as network traffic captured from the OHHDL.\nWe were able to map out the command and control infrastructure of the attackers and in several cases view\ndata that allowed us to identify targets that had been compromised and recover exfiltrated documents. We did\nnot have access to data regarding specific attacks on any of the targets we have identified. In other words, we\ncannot definitely tell how any one individual target was compromised. And, more importantly, we do not have\ndata regarding the behaviour of the attackers once inside the target’s network.\n\nHowever, we do have two key pieces of information: the first is an email address used in a document in the\nattackers’ possession that provided steps on how the attackers could use Yahoo! Mail as a command and control\nserver; the second is the IP addresses used by the attackers to send emails from Yahoo! Mail accounts used as\ncommand and control servers.\n\nEmail addresses used by the attackers have proven to provide critical clues in past investigations. Following the\nrelease of the GhostNet investigation, The Dark Visitor — a blog that researches Chinese hacking activities —\ninvestigated one of the email addresses we published that was used to register the domain names the attackers\nutilized as command and control servers. While these were not GhostNet domain names, one of them is the\nsame as one used by the attackers in this investigation: lookbytheway.net (Henderson 2009a).\n\nThe email address used to register lookbytheway.net is losttemp33@hotmail.com. The Dark Visitor found\nforum posts made by losttemp33@hotmail.com, who also used the alias “lost33.” Further searching revealed “an\nindividual who was associated with Xfocus, Isbase,” two popular Chinese hacking forums, and “seems to have\nstudied under Glacier” (Henderson 2009b). Glacier is known as “Godfather of the Chinese Trojan” (Henderson\n2007a), and an association with him indicates lost33’s connections to the hacking underground in the PRC. Using\ninformation found on lost33’s blog, The Dark Visitor was able to find another blog used by lost33, now operating\nunder the alias “damnfootman”, and had a text chat conversation with him on the Chinese instant messenger\nservice QQ, where the individual admitted to being the owner of the email address losttemp33@hotmail.com.\n\nFrom this information, The Dark Visitor was able to determine this individual has connections to the forums of\nXfocus and Isbase (the Green Army), NSfocus and Eviloctal, as well as connections to the hackers Glacier and\nSunwear. He was born on July 24, 1982, lives in Chengdu, Sichuan, and attended the University of Electronic\nScience and Technology of China, which is also located in Chengdu.\n\nOur investigation also indicated strong links to Chengdu, Sichuan. The attacker used Yahoo! Mail accounts as command and control servers, from which the attacker sent emails containing new malware to the already compromised\ntargets. All of the IP addresses the attacker used when sending these emails are located in Chengdu, Sichuan.\n\nWe were able to retrieve a document from the attackers that indicated the steps neccessary to use Yahoo! Mail\naccounts as command and control servers. There was also an account used by the attackers in this document\nfor testing purposes. Searches for this email address returned several advertisements for apartment rentals in\nChengdu Sichuan\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infrastructure of this particular network is tied to individuals in Chengdu, Sichuan. At least one of these individuals has ties to the underground hacking community in the PRC and to the University of Electronic Science\nand Technology of China in Chengdu. Interestingly, when the Honker Union of China, one of the largest hacking groups in the PRC, was re-established in 2005, its new leader was a student at the University of Electronic\nScience and Technology in Chengdu. Chengdu is also the location of one of the People’s Liberation Army\n(PLA)’s technical reconnaissance bureaus tasked with signals intelligence collection. While it would be disingenuous to ignore these correlations entirely, they are loose at best and certainly do not meet the requirements\nof determining motivation and attribution. However, the links between the command and control infrastructure\nand individuals in the PRC provide a variety of scenarios that point toward attribution.\n\n###### 5.1.2 Patriotic Hacking\n\nThe PRC has a vibrant hacker community that has been tied to targeted attacks in the past, and has been linked\nthrough informal channels to elements of the Chinese state, although the nature and extent of the connections\nremains unclear. One common theme regarding attribution relating to attacks emerging from the PRC concerns\nvariations of a privateering model, in which the state authorizes private persons to perform attacks against\nenemies of the state. This model emerged because studies have shown that there is no direct government control over the loosely connected groups of hackers in the PRC (Henderson 2007b). Even within the privateering\napproach there is much dispute regarding the exact relationship. The degrees of the reported relationship vary\nbetween “authorize” to “tacit consent” to “tolerate” (Henderson 2007b).\n\nHowever, this ambiguous relationship does not mean that there is no connection between the activities of\nChinese hackers and the state. The PRC’s intelligence collection is based on the gathering of bits of information\nacross a broad range of sources:\n\n_China relies on a broad informal network of students, tourists, teachers, and foreign workers inside of_\n_host nations to collect small bits of information to form a composite picture of the environment. Rather_\n_than set a targeted goal for collection, they instead rely on sheer weight of information to form a clear_\n_understanding of the situation. (Henderson 2007b)_\n\nAs a result, information that is independently obtained by the Chinese hacker community is likely to find its\nway to elements within the Chinese state. However, the Chinese state is not monolithic. It is a complex entity\nthat includes cooperation and competition amoung a variety of entities, including the Communist Party, the PLA\nand the Government of China. In addition, within each of those entities there are factions and rivalries. Further\ncomplicating matters is that there are reported relationships between the edges of the government and networks\nof organized crime in the PRC, as in many other countries (Bakken 2005; Keith and Lin 2005). These complex\nrelationships further complicate our understanding of the connections between the Chinese hacker community\nand the Chinese state.\n\nWhile the PLA is developing computer network operations (CNO), as are the armed forces of a wide variety of\ncountries, its relationship with the hacker community appears to be minimal, as a recent study reports:\n\n_Little evidence exists in open sources to establish firm ties between the PLA and China’s hacker community,_\n_however, research did uncover limited cases of apparent collaboration between more elite individual_\n_hackers and the PRC’s civilian security services. The caveat to this is that amplifying details are extremely_\n_limited and these relationships are difficult to corroborate. (Northrop Grumman 2009)_\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, the same study found that there is nothing that “suggests that the PLA or state security bureaus intend\nto use hacktivist attacks as a component of a CNO campaign” (Northrop Grumman 2009). In addition, there are\na variety of factors, such as the lack of command and control, precision targeting and the inability to maintain\nsurprise and deception, that argue against the use of non-state hackers as part of the PLA’s CNO strategy.\n\nIn fact, the relations between the hacker community and the state is more likely to be a concern of the Ministry\nof Public Security (Northrop Grumman 2009; Henderson 2007b). Interestingly, the Ministry of Public Security\nhas focused primarily on internal security matters, which links with the emphasis on the Tibet-related targets\ndocumented in this report. (the PRC views Tibet as an internal problem.)\n\n###### 5.2.2 Cyber Crime\n\nThe activity of cyber criminals in the PRC parallels the activities of cyber criminals around the globe. The\nChinese hacker community has been known to engage in criminal activities, primarily motivated by profit.\nActing independently of state direction, they are involved in the buying and selling of malware, theft of intellectual\nproperty, theft of gaming credentials, fraud, blackmail, music and video piracy, and pornography (Henderson\n2007b). This activity is complex and further obfuscated by the move of Eastern European-based criminal\nnetworks into Chinese cyberspace (Vass 2007). Researchers have identified several core components of the\ncyber crime ecosystem in the PRC:\n\n� **Malware Authors – motivated by profit and/or stature within the blackhat community, malware authors le-**\nverage their technical skills to create and distribute exploits (including 0day vulnerabilities) as well as trojan\nhorse programs. Their services are often advertised on discussion forums.\n\n� **Website Masters/Crackers – by maintaining malicious websites, exploiting vulnerable websites and provid-**\ning hosting for the command and control capabilities of trojans, the website masters/crackers provide the\ninfrastructure for cybercrime in the PRC\n\n� **“Envelopes” Stealers – focus on acquiring username and password pairs, known as envelopes, through the**\nuse of malware kits, which are then sold. They operate and maintain networks of infected computers but\npurchase services from malware authors and website masters/crackers to compensate for their general lack\nof technical skill.\n\n� **Virtual Asset Stealers/Sellers – by exploiting their knowledge of the underground economy, virtual asset**\nstealers/sellers purchase compromised credentials from envelopes stealers and sell virtual assets to online\ngames players, QQ users and others who drive the demand for stolen virtual goods (Choo 2008; Thibodeau\n2010; Zhuge et al. 2009).\n\nIn additional to politically sensitive information, we did find that personal information, including banking\ninformation, was exfiltrated by the attackers. It is possible that in addition to exploiting the politically sensitive\ninformation the attacks may have also had an interest in exploiting the financial data that was stolen although\nwe have no direct knowledge of such events occurring.\n\n###### 5.2.3 Overall Assessment\n\nAttribution concerning cyber espionage networks is a complex task, given the inherently obscure modus\n_operandi of the agents or groups under investigation. Cyber criminals aim to mask their identities, and_\nthe networks investigated in this report are dispersed across multiple platforms and national jurisdictions.\n\n\n-----\n\ntions around information warfare. Clearly this investigation and our analysis tracks back directly to the PRC,\nand to known entities within the criminal underground of the PRC. There is also an obvious correlation to be\ndrawn between the victims, the nature of the documents stolen, and the strategic interests of the Chinese state.\nBut correlations do not equal causation. It is certainly possible that the attackers were directed in some manner\n— either by sub-contract or privateering — by agents of the Chinese state, but we have no evidence to prove\nthat assertion. It is also possible that the agents behind the Shadow network are operating for motives other\nthan political espionage, as our investigation and analysis only uncovered a slice of what is undoubtedly\na larger set of networks. Even more remote, but still at least within the realm of possibility, is the false flag\nscenario, that another government altogether is masking a political espionage operation to appear as if it is\ncoming from within the PRC.\n\nDrawing these different scenarios and alternative explanations together, the most plausible explanation, and the\none supported by the evidence, is that the Shadow network is based out of the PRC by one or more individuals\nwith strong connections to the Chinese criminal underground. Given the often murky relationships that can exist\nbetween this underground and elements of the state, the information collected by the Shadow network may end\nup in the possession of some entity of the Chinese government.\n\n###### 5.3 Notification\n\nInvestigations of malware activity, such as that undertaken as part of the Shadow and GhostNet investigations,\ncan yield information about the network infrastructure of the attackers, information about those who have been\ncompromised, and confidential or private documents or other data that may have been exfiltrated without prior\nknowledge. Access to this information on all levels raises a number of practical, ethical and legal issues, many\nof which are unclear given the embryonic nature of the field of inquiry as a whole.\n\nThroughout this investigation, we have been conscious of these issues and have attempted to meet a professional standard in terms of planning and documenting our steps taken in the process of notification. This\nentailed research into existing practices and principles, and engagement with the law enforcement, intelligence\nand security communities in a number of countries. We were also conscious of the need to comply with the domestic laws in whose context this investigation was undertaken — namely those of India, the United States and\nCanada — as well as principles governing all academic research at the University of Toronto, where the Citizen\nLab is located.\n\nNotification itself can be broken down into several categories, each of which entails complicating factors.\nFirst, there is notification that is required to takedown the command and control infrastructure, typically to the\nhosting and service provider companies through which the malware networks operate and on which they are\nhosted. Complicating matters, these services can be located in numerous national jurisdictions and subject to a\nvariety of privacy laws and norms. Second, there are issues around notification of victims, such as governments,\nbusinesses, NGOs and individuals. This type of notification is perhaps the most challenging on ethical, practical\nand legal grounds. Notification of governments, for example, can be a very sensitive matter, especially if classified documents are involved or information is retrieved that is relevant to national security concerns. The same\nholds true of notification to individuals or businesses. At what point should a researcher notify a victim? Who\nwithin the organization, whether it is a government, a business or an NGO, is the appropriate point of contact\nfor the notification? What if the notification jeopardizes a third party’s security, or leads to some kind of retaliation or retribution? Should researchers notify law enforcement and intelligence agencies in their own countries\nbefore reaching out to foreign governments?\n\n\n-----\n\nExisting practices in this area are underdeveloped and largely informal. In part, this reflects the fact that global\ncyber security is still an embryonic field. But it also speaks to the very real problem of competitive power\npolitics at the highest levels of national security, which tend to restrict information sharing in sensitive areas\naround cyber crime and espionage. Generally speaking, information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence agencies across borders is tentative at best, with the exception of that which occurs among close allies\nwith deeply entrenched and long-standing links. Outside of those security communities, notification of services\nand governments tends to be restricted to specialist technical communities, telecommunications operators, and\nnetwork administrators, if it occurs at all. Consequently, notification of the types referred to above can be ad\nhoc and inconsistent, largely contingent on the informal connections among professional communities.\n\nAll of these issues were grappled with in the aftermath of the Tracking GhostNet report, and throughout the\ncourse of the Shadow investigation. Our experiences in the aftermath of GhostNet, where notification was left\nincomplete, prompted a more deliberate and self-conscious approach with the Shadow investigation. We were\nalso fortunate to have within our collaboration the experiences of the Shadowserver Foundation, whose counsel\non notification helped in making decisions about timing and contacts.\n\nBy the end of November 2009, we were confident in our access to the basic command and control infrastructure\nand identification of some of the key documents at hand. Upon the realization that some information about\nindividual Canadians was compromised, we notified Canadian authorities in December 2009 about the investigation, the compromise of Canadian-related information, and requested assistance on outreach with one of the\nvictims, namely the Indian government. At the same time, we independently explored whom we might contact\nin the Indian government, including making inquiries with Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs. By February\n2010, we were able to find on our own what we thought was an appropriate contact in the Indian government, and\ngave a detailed notification to the National Technology Research Organization. Our notification for takedown of\nthe command and control infrastructure came later in the investigation, after we had collected and analyzed all\nof the information related to this report, but prior to its release.\n\nOur experiences illustrate the intricate, nuanced and often confusing landscape of global cyber security notification practices. The notification process will continue after the publication of this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART 6: Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shadows in the Cloud points to a disturbing complex ecosystem of malware. Although malware networks,_\ncyber crime and espionage have been around for years, the evidence presented here shows how these networks\ncan be aggressively adaptive systems, multipying and regenerating across multiple vectors and platforms, and\nexploting the vulnerabilties within the latest Web 2.0 technologies to expand their reach and impact. Although\nthere is rich detail to what is uncovered in the Shadow investigation, so much of the origins, architecture and\naims of these networks ultimately remain a mystery and await further investigation and analysis. However, even\nwith the partial insights and fleeting glimpses acquired here, we can draw some conclusions and implications\nfor further research, policy and operations.\n\nFirst, the research here shows, as with Tracking GhostNet, how even a relatively small research sample — in\nthis case Tibetan organizations — can expand, upon investigation and analysis, into an astonishingly large pool\nof victims. The connections drawn out here beg the question of what would emerge if the research began with a\ndifferent group, from a different region of the world, with a different target set of compromised actors? Clearly,\nan area of methodological advantage for both the Tracking GhostNet and the Shadows in the Cloud investigations was to have access in the field to compromised computers and be able to work outwards in a structured\nand systematic fashion, using a combination of technical investigations and data analysis. An area of further\nresearch is to extend such efforts to other locations in other regions of the world. Such investigations may reveal\nother malware networks, or entirely new and unanticipated modes of crime and espionage.\n\nSecond, Shadows in the Cloud underscores the extent to which the global networked society into which we\nhave evolved socially, politically, economically, and militarily carries with it an underground ecoystem that is\nequally networked, though far less visible to those whom it compromises. Governments, organizations and\nother actors around the world have been quick to adopt computerized public and administration systems,\nincluding state security actors. Their investments into these technologies have developed at a much faster rate\nthan the appropriate security policies and practices (Deibert and Rohozinski 2010).\n\nAlthough the Government of India was the most victimized according to what we uncovered in Shadows in the\n_Cloud — and that certainly should yield a major consideration of public policy and security for that country —_\nobservations about India in this respect need to be qualified in at least two ways. First, Shadows in the Cloud\nreports only on observations and existing evidence, which by definition remain partial. There could be other\ncountries victimized, involving these very same malware networks attackers, but of which we are unaware\nbecause of our limited samples. Second, and most importantly, there are numerous other countries and international organizations that are targeted here, perhaps not to the same extent, but targeted and infiltrated nonetheless. We can only infer what type of data was exfiltrated from these other actors that is of strategic value.\nOverall, however, the key point to draw is that networked societies can be compromised through networks in\nwhich they are invariably linked and mutually dependent.\n\nThird, and related, Shadows in the Cloud demonstrates clearly the potential for collateral compromise, one\nof the key hypotheses informing our research framework. This investigation indicates that data leakage from\nmalware networks can compromise unwitting third parties who are not initially targeted by the attackers. Data\ncontained on compromised machines can also contain valuable information on third parties that while on\nits own may not be significant, but when pieced together with other information can provide actionable and\noperational intelligence. The policy and operational implications of collateral compromise are serious and wideranging, and reinforce that security is only as strong as the weakest link in a chain. In today’s networked world,\n\n\n-----\n\nnational jurisdictions. Paying attention to domestic cyber security is therefore only a partial solution to a much\nwider problem. Today, no country or organization is a secure island in the global sea of information.\n\nFourth, another implication raised by Shadows in the Cloud is for criminal networks to be repurposed for political\nespionage as part of an evolution in signals intelligence. Although our conclusions are necessarily circumscribed\nby our lack of complete information in this respect, we may be seeing a blurring of the lines in malware genotypes among crimeware and more politically-motivated attacks. Part of that blurring may be deliberate on the\npart of actors wishing to obscure attribution, but part of it may also be a newly emerging and largely organic\nmarket for espionage products that was either contained or nonexistent in the past, and which now supplements the market for industrial espionage. This market may present opportunities for actors that, in turn, produce a refinement in their approach or methodology. Criminal actors may troll for targets widely as a first cut,\ntriaging among the available sources of information to zero-in on those that yield commercial value on both the\nindustrial and political espionage markets. Such a development would pose major policy and operational issues,\nand accelerate existing trends down the road of cyber privateering.\n\nFinally, a major implication of the findings of Shadows in the Cloud relates to the evolution towards cloud\ncomputing, social networking and peer-to-peer networking technologies that characterize much of the global\nnetworked society today. These new modes of information storage and communication carry with them many\nconveniences and so now are fully integrated into personal life, business, government and social organization.\nBut as shown in the Shadow investigation, these new platforms are also being used as vectors of malware\npropagation and command and control (Office of Privacy Commissioner of Canada 2010).\n\nIt is often said that dark clouds carry with them silver linings, but in this case the clouds contain within them\na dark hidden core. As we document above, blog hosting sites, social networking forums and mail groups were\nturned into support structures and command and control systems for a malignant enterprise. The very same\ncharacteristics of those social networking and cloud platforms which make them so attractive to the legitimate\nuser — reliability, distribution, redundancy and so forth — were what attracted our attackers to them in setting\nup their network. Clouds provide criminals and espionage networks with convenient cover, tiered defences,\nredundancy, cheap hosting and conveniently distributed command and control architectures. They also provide\na stealthy and very powerful mode of infiltrating targets who have become accustomed to clicking on links and\nopening PDFs and other documents as naturally as opening an office door. What is required now is a much\ngreater reflection on what it will take, in terms of personal computing, corporate responsibility and government\npolicy, to acculturate a greater sensibility around cloud security.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Bibliography\n\n**Adair, Steven.
