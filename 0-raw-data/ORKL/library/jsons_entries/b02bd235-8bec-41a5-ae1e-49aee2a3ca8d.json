    "plain_text": "# Bad Actors Trying to Capitalize on Current Events via Shameless Email Scams\n\n**[fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/bad-actors-capitalize-current-events-email-scams](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/bad-actors-capitalize-current-events-email-scams)**\n\nMarch 23, 2022\n\nMalicious email and phishing scams are usually topical and follow a pattern of current\nevents. They are usually crafted around calendar and/or trending issues as attackers realize\nthat victims are interested in all things relevant to the moment. Threat actors are aware that\nnot all recipients will bite, but some will, hence the origination of the term “phishing.”\n\nThreat actors often put in the least amount of work possible for a maximum return, sending\nout phishing emails to thousands of targets. Even if less than one percent of victims respond,\nthe return on investment is still significant due to the gain of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) and/or establishing a foothold within an organization using stolen\ncredentials, malware, or other means.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis blog highlights some examples we ve encountered that may help users better spot\nsuspicious emails. Recent examples observed by FortiGuard Labs include emails related to\ntax season and the Ukrainian conflict, which reflect the timeliness of current and newsworthy\nevents at the time of writing.\n\n**Affected Platforms: Windows**\n**Impacted Users: Windows users**\n**Impact: Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor. Stolen personally**\nidentifiable information (PII), credential theft, monetary loss, etc.\n**Severity Level: Medium**\n\n## Tax Season Scams\n\nTax season comes around annually, like other seasonal events or holidays. Targeting\ncalendar-based events enables threat actors to prepare ahead of time and have a new\nselection of targets on rotation.\n\nThe following set of examples highlights two IRS/tax-themed scams. The first is a malicious\nemail pretending to originate from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) containing a\nmaliciously crafted Microsoft Excel file to deliver malware (Emotet). The second is a phishing\nscam that asks a recipient to send personally identifiable information (PII) via written\ncorrespondence to a phone number.\n\n### IRS-themed email delivering Emotet\n\nThis attack starts with an IRS impersonation email that contains a ZIP attachment called “W9 form.zip”. The email is sent to the target, and a password is provided within the body of the\nemail for convenient extraction. The zipped attachment contains a file, “W-9 form.XLM.” The\nXLM extension is simply an Excel file that contains Excel 4.0 macros:\n\nFigure 1. Fake IRS email with malicious attachment\n\nFor those not familiar with Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and\nCertification), it is used by U.S. individuals to provide a correct taxpayer identification number\n(TIN) to payers (or brokers) who are required to file information returns with the IRS. Red\nflags that this is a phishing scam include the non-capitalization of “assistant” and the\nincorrect usage of “Treasure” instead of “Treasury” in the signature body. It should also be\nnoted that the IRS does not communicate with U.S. taxpayers via email and instead uses the\ntraditional postal service for all communications.\n\n### Analysis\n\n[Upon observation, and in a similar fashion to our recent Emotet blog, the XLM file asks the](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ms-office-files-involved-in-emotet-trojan-campaign-pt-one)\nuser to enable macros upon opening the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe XLM file contains the following obfuscated Excel 4.0 macro:\n\nFigure 2. Screenshot of Excel 4.0 macro\n\nThe document contains five hidden sheets: \"Vfrbuk1\", \"Sheet\", \"Lefasbor1\", \"EFALGV\", “Je1”\nand “Je2”. Sheet EFALGV contains the main code, which uses the other sheets to compile\ncommands. It does this without user interaction, performing its behind-the-scenes magic to\ndownload a copy of Emotet from multiple remote locations:\n\nFigure 3. Hidden Sheets\n\nAnother variation observed was sent to a State Attorney General’s office in the United\nStates. The “From” address is clearly seen in the email. It was sent from an automotive tire\nshop located in Japan, which is most likely compromised and serves as an open mail relay:\n\nFigure 4. Variation of the same scam\n\n### Microsoft takes action\n\nMicrosoft [announced in January 2022 that Excel 4.0 macros are disabled by default starting](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/excel-4-0-xlm-macros-now-restricted-by-default-for-customer/ba-p/3057905)\nin Excel (Build 16.0.14427.10000). The move came as no surprise because the feature is\ncontinuously abused by threat actors. Other welcome news from Microsoft is the restricted\nusage of macros in Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word by default starting in April\n2022 via the disablement of VBA macros (also abused by Emotet). Based on the examples\nshown above, we can see this did not deter the attacker one bit from abusing Excel 4.0\nmacros.\n\nAlso, administrators are able to control the usage of Excel 4.0 macros via group policy\nsettings, as well as cloud and ADMX policies. This feature was introduced in July 2021. For\nmore details, please visit Microsoft’s tech community page - “Restrict usage of Excel 4.0\n(XLM) macros with new macro settings control”.\n\nIt’s important to note that these potential victims were not targeted. Emotet utilizes what is\ncolloquially known in the industry as a “spray and pray” tactic to spread via malicious email\ncampaigns. Emotet is known to have delivered other malware variants in the past, with the\nmost disruptive being ransomware. Some ransomware as a service (RaaS) groups have\nspecific policies to not deploy ransomware to government sectors, defense industry, and\nother critical infrastructures (hospitals, etc.). However, actual attacks are often carried out by\nRaaS affiliates who may or may not abide by the policy set by RaaS groups.\n\n### Request to fill and send a W-8 form via a fax number\n\nA different scam recently observed is an email with the subject line of: “NEW YEAR-NONRESIDENT ALIEN TAX EXEMPTION UPDATE.” This example contains an attachment, titled\n“W8-ENFORM.PDF.” While not malicious, this PDF file is essentially a photocopy of the IRS\n\n\n-----\n\nW-8 form. It is simply the W8 form from the IRS with an appended number added by the bad\nactors at the end of the document.\n\nRed flags within the body of the email are the improper usage of grammar, typos, and\npunctuation:\n\nFigure 5. W-8 themed tax scam\n\nThis scam uses social engineering verbiage to target nonresident aliens of the United States\nbased on “official” records discovery. However, in a weird miscue, the email contains a\ncontradictory statement:\n\n“if you are a USA citizen and resident, this W8BEN-FORM is not meant for you…”\n\nThe email continues with instructions to reply back and to state on the attached form that the\nrecipient is, indeed, a U.S. citizen/resident. After this step is completed, the bad actor\nprovides a different form to complete.\n\nFigure 6. W-8 Form\n\nFigure 7. W8 Form with added phone number to document\n\nOnce this form is filled out, all PII included on this form appears to be sent to an 806 phone\nnumber, which is the area code for the state of Texas. As of the time of writing this number\nhas an active fax service, which most likely is internet-based and can receive the content\nand distribute as an attachment to the malicious actor anywhere in the world. It is possible, if\nthere are a lot of respondents, they could be using OCR (Optical Image Recognition) image\ntechnology to store victim data in a database for later use.\n\nIt is important to again note that the IRS does not handle any official correspondence via\nemail. Official W-9 forms are available on the IRS Web [page. Official W8 forms can be found](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf)\n[here.](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8)\n\n## Refugee war scams\n\nSpam commonly uses techniques such as current events (sports, tax season), using money\nas an incentive to click, playing on our natural greed (tax refunds, free money) and use the\nthreat of running out of time to get us to take immediate action.\n\nIn the example below, all three techniques are employed, albeit in a more unusual way –\nwith an impassioned plea give money to others with the subject line “URGENT RESPONSE\nREQUIRED! (UKRAINE).”\n\nWhile the email does not contain a malicious attachment or link, the scammer is asking for a\nresponse. This is likely to contain a follow up message for further information. Perhaps the\nthreat actor may engage in dialog with the victim and will ask the victim to send payment via\n\n\n-----\n\nwire transfer, third-party payment processors (such as Venmo, Zelle, etc.), or via\ncryptocurrency. The email address of the sender uses a gmail.com email address to likely\nevade spam filters.\n\nFigure 8. Email Screenshot\n\n### Bitcoin Variation\n\nThe screenshot below highlights a brazenly opportunistic scam with the subject line\n“URGENT DONATION RESPONSE FOR WAR REFUGEE CAMP IN UKRAINE.” It purports\nto originate from a trusted organization, The United Nations. Red flags are the forged email\naddress of the UN High Commissioner “info@seca[.]cam” in the “From” line, as well as some\ngrammatical and punctuation errors. Another red flag is that the seca[.]cam domain was only\nregistered a few weeks ago, on February 23, 2022.\n\nFigure 9. Refugee scam soliciting for Bitcoin\n\nChecking the Bitcoin wallet address, we can see that this is an active wallet that had its first\ntransaction on September 29th, 2021. Since the first discovery of the campaign on the 7 ofth\nMarch, several transactions have been made to this wallet. Its current value at time of writing\nis $46.82 USD, with total transactions valued at $712.79 USD. Assuming that this wallet was\nused for malicious purposes, it appears that various campaigns have netted the threat actor\na modest profit. However, it can also be safely surmised that this might not be the scammers\nonly wallet. As with the IRS, it is also important to mention is that the U.N. will never send\n[unsolicited emails for donations. For further details, please reference the U.N. Fraud Alert](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/fraud-alert)\npage.\n\nFigure 10. Bitcoin wallet details\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**_Emotet and the War in Ukraine_**\n\nWith the current tragic situation in Ukraine unfolding, internal chatter within ransomware\ngroups have surfaced. Some ransomware groups side with Russia and other groups side\nwith the West. A well-known RaaS group (which used Emotet)—that we will not publicize for\nobvious reasons—has made a very strong statement that any attacks directed towards\nRussia will be met with a retaliatory act towards the West.\n\nAs the situation is fluid, and with potentially compromised government sectors likely being\ninfected or targeted with ransomware at this very moment either for monetary or political\nreasons, this threat is not out of the question. The point is that important sectors such as\ngovernment agencies are no longer exempt from attacks, especially from Emotet threat\nactors, regardless of bias or opinion.\n\n\n-----\n\nPhishing scams aren t going anywhere. They are a part of the threat landscape and will likely\nalways be a component of an attackers’ arsenal. This is because the return on investment for\nan attacker is very high. A crafted email containing specific language designed to trick users\ninto opening an attachment, following a link, responding with confidential or sensitive\ninformation, etc. will always work on a percentage of targets. This is because of the one\nmajor weakness security software cannot address: the human element.\n\nTraining programs constantly remind and teach users how to spot malicious\nemail/phishing/spearphishing scams for a good reason. Out of thousands of recipients, it\nonly takes a few to respond to make it all worthwhile to an attacker. And when the right\nperson falls prey it can unleash a trove of information to the attacker that can be exploited for\nvarious purposes. Although such scams are well known and publicized, they are still\npervasive for one simple fact—they work and will continue to work for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Things to Consider:\n\n1. Think twice when enabling macros (they are disabled by default for good reason)\n\nespecially in tax form XLM files.\n2. The IRS will never send correspondence via email (including attachments) without first\n\nobtaining your consent. IGNORE all unsolicited emails purporting to be from the IRS as\nthey are not real.\n3. The IRS has a dedicated webpage to report scams along with an FAQ page - Report\n\nPhishing | Internal Revenue Service (irs.gov) (Note: Scams mentioned in this blog\nhave been sent to the IRS before publication)\n4. The UN will also never send unsolicited emails for donations. According to the UN\n\nwebsite, “The United Nations strongly recommends that the recipients of solicitations,\nsuch as those described above exercise extreme caution in respect of such\n[solicitations” Please see the U.N Fraud Alert page for further details. IGNORE all](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/fraud-alert)\nunsolicited emails purporting to be from the UN as they are not real. (Note: Scams\nmentioned in this blog have been sent to the UN before publication)\n5. Unsolicited emails asking for donations of any kind via email (especially via\n\ncryptocurrency) is a red flag regardless of cause.\n6. Responding to any email (even if it doesn’t contain a link or malicious attachment) from\n\nan untrusted sender will validate your email address to threat actors, either adding you\nto spam lists or subjecting to future attacks and scams.\n\n### Remember:\n\nThreat actors are playing the numbers game. If they spam out 1,000 emails at a very minimal\ncost, and 10 people bite giving them valuable data, then the effort spent was well worth the\nreturn on investment.\n\n### Fortinet Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\nFortinet customers are protected from this campaign by FortiGuard Web Filtering, AntiVirus,\nFortiMail, FortiClient, FortiEDR, and CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) services, as\nfollows:\n\nThe malicious macro inside the Excel sample (Emotet) can be disarmed by the FortiGuard\nCDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service.\n\nFortiEDR detects both the Excel file and Emotet-related files as malicious based on behavior.\n\nAll relevant URIs to campaigns mentioned in the blog are blocked by the FortiGuard Web\nFiltering service.\n\nThe malicious Excel sample and associated downloaded files are detected as:\n\n“XML/Dloader.802!tr, “W32/Emotet.C!tr\", “W32/Emotet.CV!tr”, and “W32/Emotet.1150!tr” are\nblocked by the FortiGuard AntiVirus service.\n\nThe IRS phishing email targeting nonresident aliens is detected as:\n\nIRS PDF/Fraud.10F1!phish\n\n### Ukraine Related Scams\n\nURGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED!
