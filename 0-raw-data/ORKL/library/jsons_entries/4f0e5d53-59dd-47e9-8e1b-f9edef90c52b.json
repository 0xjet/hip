    "plain_text": "**Prepared Statement of Kevin Mandia, CEO of FireEye, Inc.**\n**before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence**\n\n**March 30, 2017**\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chairman Warner, and Members of the Senate\nIntelligence Committee, for the opportunity you have given me today to share our\nobservations and our experiences regarding this important topic, as well as for your\nleadership on cybersecurity issues. As requested, I am going to discuss three topics\nhere today: 1) the role of overt and covert cyber operations in support of Russian\nactive measures, disinformation, and influence campaigns; 2) the cyber capabilities\nand techniques attributed to Russian state and non-state actors; and 3)\nrecommendations to prevent and mitigate the threat posed by such cyber operations.\n\n**1.** **Background.**\n\nBefore I turn to your specific questions, let me share some background on myself and\nmy company to inform the context of my narrative. I have been working in\ncybersecurity for over two decades, since I was first stationed at the Pentagon at the\noutset of my career as a Computer Security Officer in 1993. During my time\ninvestigating computer intrusions while I was in the Air Force, I came to recognize\nthat the biggest cyber threats to our infrastructure were intrusions from other\ncountries, most notably Russia and China. I founded Mandiant in 2004 to create a\ncompany with that could effectively respond to these threats and innovate\ntechnologies to help detect and respond to advanced attacks. Fast forward a few\nyears, Mandiant was bought by FireEye, and I became FireEye’s CEO last June in 2016.\n\nAs I testify today, FireEye employees are on the front lines of the cyber battle,\nresponding to active computer intrusions at dozens of the largest companies and\norganizations on a global scale, including incidents in cyber “hot zones” such as the\nMiddle East and Southeast Asia. Over the last 13 years, we have responded to\nincidents at hundreds of companies around the world.  During that time, we have\ninvestigated millions of systems, and we receive calls almost every single day from\norganizations that have suffered a cybersecurity breach.\n\nIn addition to the 300-plus security professionals responding to computer intrusions,\nFireEye has over 150 cyber-threat analysts on staff in 19 countries and speaking 32\ndifferent languages, to help us predict threats and better understand the adversary –\noften by considering the political and cultural environment of the threat actors. We\nhave an enormous catalog of threat intelligence, and it continues to grow everyday\ncoincident with the continually increasing attacks on organizations around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe information I will share today, then, is derived from our experiences responding\nto computer security breaches, as well as intelligence derived from our experienced\nteam of cyber threat analysts and collected from more than 5000 customers who use\nour products to detect intrusions into their networks and respond to these attacks.\n\n**2.** **The Role of Overt and Covert Cyber Operations in Support of Russian**\n\n**Active Measures, Disinformation, and Influence Campaigns.**\n\nThe role of nation-state actors in cyber attacks was perhaps most widely revealed in\nFebruary 2013 when Mandiant released the report, “APT1: Exposing One of China’s\nCyber Espionage Units,” which detailed a professional cyber espionage group based\nin China. [1] Several months later in 2014 we released another report, this time\nregarding Russian cyber activities, entitled, “APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber\nEspionage Operations?” [2] In that report, FireEye identified APT28 as a suspected\nRussian government-sponsored espionage actor, basing our conclusion on forensic\ndetails left in the malware employed since at least 2007. Since release of the initial\nreport on APT28, we have continued to gather intelligence and collect data on the\ngroup’s activities, and most recently, in January of this year, released “APT28: At the\nCenter of the Storm”[3] which provides additional detail on the continued evolution of\nRussian cyber operations.\n\nAs shown in our most recent report, an analysis of the activities of APT28 indicates\nthe group’s interest in foreign governments and militaries, particularly those of\nEurope, as well as regional security organizations. In addition, our research indicates\nthat APT28 network activity has likely supported information operations designed to\ninfluence the domestic politics of foreign nations. We provide an extensive listing of\ntargets including the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the U.S. Democratic\nNational Committee, Mr. John Podesta, the U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee (DCCC), as well as TV5Monde and the Ukrainian Central Election\nCommission (CEC).\n\nAll of these breaches involved the theft of internal data – mostly emails – that was\nlater strategically leaked through multiple forums and propagated in a manner\nalmost certainly intended to advance particular Russian Government goals. We noted\nthat the combination of network compromises and subsequent data leaks align\nclosely with the Russian military’s publicly stated intentions and capabilities. Russian\nstrategic doctrine has for a long time included what the West terms ‘information\n\n1 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n2 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rptapt28.pdf.\n3 https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/APT28-Center-of-Storm-2017.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\noperations’ which have been further developed, deployed and modernized. The\nrecent activity in the United States is one of many instances of such operations\nconducted in support of Russian political objectives. I note that our conclusions were\nconsistent with the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence report released\non January 7, 2017 in which this activity is described as “an influence campaign.”[4]\n\n**3.** **Cyber Capabilities and Techniques Attributed to Russian State and Non-**\n\n**State Actors**\n\nSo how was this done, and why do we assess that the Russian government was likely\nbehind this activity? **_Let me first speak to the methodologies used. During the_**\ncourse of our APT28 investigations, we analyzed over 550 customer malware\nvariants, identified approximately 500 domains, over 70 lure documents and dozens\nof spear phishing emails to help us understand their tools, techniques, and\nprocedures.  We find that APT28 continues to evolve its toolkit and refine its tactics\nin an effort to maintain its operational effectiveness in the face of heightened public\nexposure and scrutiny. In addition to the continued evolution of the group's firststage tools, we have also noted that APT28 is:\n\n1 - Leveraging at least five zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, Java, and\nWindows in 2015 alone, including CVE-2015-1701, CVE-2015-2424, CVE-2015-2590,\nCVE-2015-3043, CVE-2016-7193, and CVE-2015-7645.\n2 – Increasing its reliance on public code depositories, such as Carberp, PowerShell\nEmpire, P.A.S. webshell, Metasploit modules, and others in a likely effort to accelerate\ntheir development cycle and provide plausible deniability.\n3 - Obtaining credentials through fabricated Google App authorization and Oauth\naccess requests that allow the group to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) and\nother security measures, and\n4 - Moving laterally through a network relying only on legitimate tools that already\nexist within victims' systems, at times forgoing their traditional toolset for the\nduration of the compromise.\n\nOver the past two years we have witnessed an escalation of APT 28’s overall activities\nand one notable change in its rules of engagement. Specifically, since 2014 we have\nseen APT28 in many instances compromise a victim organization, steal information,\nand subsequently leak the stolen data into the public. Many of these leaks have been\nconducted through the use of “false hacktivist personas”, including, among others,\n“CyberCaliphate”, “Guccifer 2.0”, “DC Leaks”, “Anonymous Poland”, and “Fancy Bears’\nHack Team”. These “personas” appropriated pre-existing hacktivist or political\nbrands likely to obfuscate their true identify, provide plausible deniability, and to\ncreate the perception of credibility.\n\n4 https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA 2017 01.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough we can link the collection activity to APT28, we have not been able to\nestablish whether the APT28 operators themselves directly control the false personas\nthat then leak material or if that responsibility instead resides with a separate entity.\nHowever, we do see similar patterns in infrastructure procurement between APT28\nand some personas to suggest they played at least some role. For example, we believe\nthat the actors behind the DCLeaks persona attempted to register the domain\n“electionleaks.com” one-week prior to “DCLeaks.com” in April 2016 – approximately\ntwo months prior to the first election-related leaks. These domains were registered\nusing the service provider we have seen APT28 frequently use in the past to support\ncyber attacks. Thus, our intelligence indicates that APT28 likely operated with the\nknowledge that the data they stole during cyber intrusions would leverage these\ndomains for public exposure of the data.\n\nI include the following timeline and analysis to illustrate the use of these techniques\nover the last few years.\n\nIn June of 2014, Ukrainian officials revealed the investigation into the compromise of\nthe Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) internal network identified custom\nmalware traced to APT28. During the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election,\npurported pro-Russian hacktivists “CyberBerkut” conducted a series of malicious\nactivities against the CEC, including a system compromise, data destruction, a data\nleak, a distributed denial-of- service (DDoS) attack, and an attempted defacement of\nthe CEC website with fake election results.\n\nIn February of 2015, FireEye identified APT28 (CORESHELL) traffic beaconing from\nTV5Monde's network, revealing APT28 had compromised TV5Monde's network. In\nApril 2015, alleged pro-ISIS hacktivist group CyberCaliphate defaced TV5Monde's\nwebsites and social media profiles and forced the company's 11 broadcast channels\noffline. We identified overlaps between the domain registration details of\nCyberCaliphate's website and APT28 infrastructure.\n\nIn July of 2016, the U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)\nannounced that it was investigating an ongoing \"cybersecurity incident\" that the FBI\nbelieved was linked to the compromise of the DNC. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi later\nconfirmed that the DCCC had suffered a network compromise. Investigators\nindicated that the actors may have gained access to DCCC systems as early as March.\nIn August, the Guccifer 2.0 persona contacted reporters covering the U.S. House of\nRepresentative races to announce newly leaked documents from the DCCC pertaining\nto Democratic candidates. From August to October, Guccifer 2.0 posted several\nadditional installments of what appear to be internal DCCC documents on its\nWordPress site.\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween March and October of 2016, investigators found that John Podesta, Hillary\nClinton's presidential campaign chairman, was one of thousands of individuals\ntargeted in a mass phishing scheme using shortened URLs that security researchers\nattributed to APT28. Throughout October and into early November, WikiLeaks\npublished 34 batches of email correspondence stolen from Mr. Podesta's personal\nemail account. Correspondence of other individuals targeted in the same phishing\ncampaign, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Clinton campaign\nstaffer William Rinehart, were published on the \"DC Leaks\" website.\n\nIn April through September, 2016, the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC)\nsuffered a network compromise and a subsequent investigation found evidence of\ntwo breaches, attributed to APT28 and APT29. FireEye analyzed the malware found\non DNC networks and determined that it was consistent with our previous\nobservations of APT28 tools. In June 2016, shortly after the DNC's public\nannouncement about the breach, the Guccifer 2.0 persona claimed responsibility for\nthe DNC breach and leaked documents taken from the organization's network.\nGuccifer 2.0 continued to leak DNC documents through September of 2016.\n\nAnd finally, in September of 2016, WADA confirmed that APT28 had compromised its\nnetworks and accessed athlete medical data. On Sept. 12, 2016, the \"Fancy 'Bears'\nHack Team\" persona claimed to have compromised WADA and released athletes'\nmedical records as \"proof of American athletes taking doping.\"\n\nLet me now turn to explaining **_why we assess that the Russian government was_**\n**_likely behind this activity._**\n\nIn order to make such an assessment, we reviewed and compared intrusion\nmethodologies and tools, malware or authored exploits and use of shared personnel.\nWe also examined forensic details that were left behind, such as the specific IP\naddresses or email addresses from spear phishing attacks, file names, MD5 hashes,\ntimestamps, custom functions, encryption algorithms, or backdoors that may have\ncommand and control IP addresses or domain names embedded.\n\nTargeting was also critical to our assessment. Knowing the types of organizations,\nindividuals, or data that a threat group targets provided us with insight into the\ngroup's motivations and objectives. Gathering this type of data about a group\ntypically requires visibility into the group's operational planning, their initial attacks\nor infection attempts, or into actual victim environments. We track all of the\nindicators and significant linkages associated with identified threat groups in a\nproprietary database that we have developed over many years comprised of millions\nof nodes and linkages between groups, and then analyze this information carefully in\nthe context of the relevant political and cultural environment to develop our\nassessments.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our extensive collected intelligence and analysis in this instance, we have\ndetermined that APT28’s cyber operations are consistent with government\nsponsorship and control. Specifically, APT28 has relied upon a steady supply of\nsophisticated tools that would only have been available to a nation-state or stateprotected contractor, pursued targets where Russian interests would be high,\nmaintained a level of activity over several years requiring significant financial and\npersonnel resources with no clear profit motive, and closely integrated its cyber\nattacks into broader propaganda efforts of benefit to a nation-state actor.\n\nThere are alternative explanations for APT28’s sponsorship, however in our view\nthese only appear plausible for explaining one incident at a time, and are not credible\nin the context of the totality of APT28’s operations. By combining an increasingly\nwide range of technical intelligence, hands-on remediation of compromised systems,\nand an understanding of Russia’s geopolitical aims based on its own public\nstatements, our confidence in assessing Russian government sponsorship or control\nof APT28 has only grown since release of our initial report in 2014.\n\nMoreover, the activities of APT28 are not consistent with any basic criminal activities\nto which we have responded, nor are they consistent with those perpetrated by a lone\nactor. The size of the infrastructure, the targeted information, the amount of malware\nand the totality of the sophistication, suggests a long-term, well-resourced espionage\ncampaign in which Russia is the benefactor.\n\nIn summary, while we do not have pictures of a building, names of individuals, or a\ngovernment agency to name, our assessment is supported by evidence of longstanding, focused operations that indicates a Russian government sponsor and\ngovernment capability.\n\n**4.** **Recommendations to Prevent and Mitigate the Threat Posed by Such**\n\n**Cyber Operations.**\n\nToday, and into the foreseeable future, it is our view that the United States will face a\nmotivated, technically sophisticated, and well-resourced adversary intent on\naccessing our private data, and potentially leaking it publicly. While many\norganizations are actively trying to counter these attacks, there currently exists a\nsizeable gap between what their safeguards can prevent and the ability of motivated\nattackers to circumvent those safeguards. Therefore, we will need to explore ways,\nboth within and outside the cyber domain, to help deter these attacks.\n\nOf course, all enterprises – private sector or government – should work to accurately\nassess their own risk profiles, and utilize updated technology and best practices to\n\n\n-----\n\nprotect their networks and systems. However, organizations cannot buy, hire or train\ntheir way to perfect security and we must consider effective deterrence and\nproportional response outside of the cyber domain as well.\n\nWhile diplomacy is not often cited as a primary tool in this arena, evidence collected\nregarding Chinese activity appears to reinforce its potential effectiveness. We\nconducted a comprehensive study of 182 compromised U.S. targets by 72 Chinese\ncyber threat groups going back to 2013, and we saw a sharp decline in these\noperations after September 2015 – when President Obama and President Xi met and\nspecifically agreed to curtail cyber operations for commercial benefit. To be sure,\nChinese cyber operations for traditional espionage remain, and US companies are still\ntargeted for the security, political, economic, and military intelligence that Beijing\nseeks. However, it appears that the agreement had an impact, demonstrating that\ndiplomacy can also be a useful tool for reducing the cyber threat both countries face,\ncoupled with the public-private sector collaboration. This experience leaves me\noptimistic that with the combined efforts of both governments and the private sector,\ndiplomatic engagement with Russia and other nations to restrict harmful cyber\nactivity would be enforceable.\n\nIn addition to Russia, North Korea and Iran have been tied to a series of escalating\nattacks that go back several years. We have been surprised by the audacity of the\nsponsoring nation and their willingness to surpass “redlines” that we previously\nbelieved were established. It is entirely reasonable to suspect that these nations are\nemboldened by each other’s behavior, and it is important to note that any response\nto the Russian cyber activities discussed today will likely be assessed by other\ncountries.\n\nAgain, we applaud the leadership shown by this Committee to bring important issues\nsuch as those discussed today to light, and we in the private sector look forward to\ncontinuing to work with you to disseminate and support industry best practices and\nencourage adoption of comprehensive and effective cybersecurity programs across\ngovernment and industry. I look forward to answering your questions today.\n\n                  -                   -                   \n\n-----",
