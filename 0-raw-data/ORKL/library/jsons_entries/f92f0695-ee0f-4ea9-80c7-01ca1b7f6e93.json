The Threat Analysis Reports investigate these\nthreats and provide practical recommendations for protecting against them.\n\nIn this Threat Analysis report, Cybereason GSOC team analysts have analyzed a case that\n[involved a Bumblebee Loader infection. Following this introduction, we describe in detail the attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\nchain from the initial Bumblebee infection to the compromise of the entire network.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**User-Driven Execution: The majority of the infections with Bumblebee we have observed**\n[started by end-users executing LNK files which use a system binary to load the malware.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-alert-raspberry-robin-worm-abuses-windows-installer-and-qnap-devices)\nDistribution of the malware is done by phishing emails with an attachment or a link to the\nmalicious archive containing Bumblebee.\n**Intensive Reconnaissance and Data Exfiltration: Bumblebee operators conduct intensive**\nreconnaissance activities and redirect the output of executed commands to files for\nexfiltration.\n**Active Directory Compromise: The attackers compromised Active Directory and leveraged**\nconfidential data such as users’ logins and passwords for lateral movement. The time it took\nbetween initial access and Active Directory compromise was less than two days.\n**Under Active Development: Cybereason GSOC has observed threat actors transitioning**\nfrom BazarLoader, Trickbot, and IcedID to Bumblebee, which seems to be in active\ndevelopment and generally the loader of choice for many threat actors.\n**Critical Severity: Attacks involving Bumblebee must be treated as critical. Based on GSOC**\nfindings, the next step for the threat actors is ransomware deployment, and this loader is\nknown for ransomware delivery.\n**Cybereason Managed Detection and Response (MDR): The Cybereason GSOC team has**\na zero-tolerance policy towards attacks involving Bumblebee and any other loader, and\ncategorizes such attacks as critical, high-severity incidents. The Cybereason GSOC MDR\nTeam issues a comprehensive report to customers when such an incident occurs. The report\nprovides an in-depth overview of the incident, which helps to understand the scope of the\ncompromise and the impact on the customer’s environment. These reports also provide\nattribution information whenever possible, as well as recommendations for threat mitigation\nand isolation.\n**Detected and Prevented: The** [Cybereason Defense Platform effectively detects and](https://www.cybereason.com/platform#graphic)\nprevents infections from Bumblebee.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[In March 2022, a new malware loader was discovered by Google Threat Analysis Group. ​​This](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\nloader is named Bumblebee because of its unique user agent, “Bumblebee,” that is used as part of\nthe communication with the command and control server (C2).\n\nCybereason GSOC observed the distribution of the loader via spear phishing emails which contain\narchives with ISO files as attachments or links to download the archive from external sources. The\ninitial execution relies on the end-user execution which has to extract the archive mount an ISO\n\n\n-----\n\nimage file, and click a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.\n\nAfter initial execution, the most notable post-exploitation activities performed by Bumblebee are\nprivilege escalation, reconnaissance, and credential theft, which are detailed in this report.\n\nBumblebee operators use the Cobalt Strike framework throughout the attack. The threat actors use\nthe obtained credentials to access Active Directory and make a copy of ntds.dit containing data for\nthe entire Active Directory. Lastly, a domain administrator account is used to move laterally, create\nlocal user accounts, and exfiltrate data using Rclone software.\n\nCybereason GSOC has observed threat actors transitioning from BazarLoader, Trickbot, and IcedID\n[to Bumblebee, which seems to be in active development and generally the loader of choice for](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/bumblebee-is-still-transforming)\nmany threat actors.\n\n[We have previously analyzed the loader in detail, and the report is available here. In this research,](https://elis531989.medium.com/the-chronicles-of-bumblebee-the-hook-the-bee-and-the-trickbot-connection-686379311056)\nwe chose to focus on post-exploitation actions and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Timeline\n\nFollowing table summarizes the activities timeline from initial compromise to the data exfiltration:\n\n**Activities** **Time**\n\n**Initial access** T0\n\n**Reconnaissance / nltest, net, whoami** T0 + 30 minutes\n\n**Command and Control / Loading Meterpreter agent** T0 + 4 hours\n\n**Privilege Escalation / Zerologon exploitation** T0 + 4 hours\n\n**Command and Control / Cobalt Strike beacon execution** T0 + 6 hours\n\n**Credential Theft / registry hive** T0 + 6 hours\n\n**Reconnaissance / adfind, ping, curl** T0 + 6 hours and 30\nminutes\n\n\n**Credential Theft and Privilege Escalation / LSASS memory dump**\nwith procdump64.exe\n\n\nT0 + 19 hours\n\n\n-----\n\n**Credential Theft / NTDS.dit exfiltration with Active Directory full**\nprivilege\n\n\nT0 + 22 hours\n\n\n**Lateral Movement / Cobalt Strike socks-tunnel (RDP)** T0 + 24 hours\n\n**Data Exfiltration / Rclone** T0 + 3 days\n\n### Initial Access and Execution\n\nCybereason GSOC team observed the following distribution method to deliver the Bumblebee\nmalware:\n\nA spear phishing email is received containing an archive or a link to an external source to\ndownload the archive.\nUser extracts the archive and mounts the resulting ISO image.\nThe content of the mounted ISO image is a LNK file executing the Bumblebee payload upon\nuser interaction:\n\n_Bumblebee infection flow_\n\nBumblebee operators host malicious websites that implement a drive-by download. To infect the\nsystem, an end-user has to first manually decompress the archive containing the ISO file, mount\nthe file and then execute the Windows shortcut (LNK).\n\nThe LNK file has an embedded command to run Bumblebee Dynamic-link library (DLL) using\n[odbcconf.exe Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBin) and response (.rsp) file. The file [Bumblebee](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Odbcconf/)\n_specific name].rsp has the reference to the Bumblebee DLL:_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bumblebee infection steps_\n\n_An end-user interactively decompresses and executes a LNK file that Bumblebee operators_\n_distribute as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\n_[Odbcconf.exe loadsBumblebee DLL with the internal name LdrAddx64.dll. The figure below](https://www.cynet.com/blog/orion-threat-alert-flight-of-the-bumblebee/)_\nillustrates the ISO image content (DLL, RSP and LNK files) for Bumblebee:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Content of the mounted ISO image_\n\nBumblebee DLL is executed using odbcconf.exe -f [Bumblebee specific name].rsp in the LNK file\ntarget property. [Bumblebee specific name].rsp has a reference to [Bumblebee specific name].dll\nwhich is the Bumblebee payload\n\n### Foothold\n\nAfter the initial infection, Bumblebee injects code into multiple processes in order to establish a\nstrong foothold on infected endpoints. The process odbcconf.exe creates local Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI) calls to spawn new processes.\n\nAs a result, the following two processes are spawned from wmiprivse.exe (Windows Management\nInstrumentation Provider Service) :\n\n_wabmig.exe (Microsoft contacts import tool) with injected Meterpreter agent code (Meterpreter_\nagent is a security product used for penetration testing and provides remote control\ncapabilities).\n_wab.exe (Microsoft address book application) with an injected Cobalt Strike beacon:_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bumblebee leveraging WMI to run wab.exe and wabmig.exe with injected floating code as seen in_\n_the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\n### Privilege Escalation and Cobalt Strike deployment\n\n[Bumblebee performs privilege escalation by loading an exploit for CVE-2020-1472 (Zerologon) into](https://github.com/leitosama/SharpZeroLogon)\n_rundll32.exe:_\n\n_Exploitation of CVE-2020-1472, Zerologon as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\nBumblebee uses a User Account Control (UAC) bypass technique to deploy post exploitation tools\n[with elevated privileges on infected machines. The method uses fodhelper.exe which is a trusted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-uac-bypass-uses-apps-and-features-utility/)\nbinary, meaning Windows 10 won't show a UAC window when launched into execution:\n\n_UAC bypass using fodhelper.exe and code injection into winlogon.exe as seen in the Cybereason_\n_Defense Platform_\n\n\n-----\n\nFodhelper.exe is used to run _cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\[Cobalt_\n_strike].dll”,MainProc where [Cobalt strike].dll is a Cobalt Strike framework beacon and MainProc is_\nthe exported function to run.\n\nCobalt Strike is an adversary simulation framework with the primary use case of assisting red team\noperations. However, Cobalt Strike is also actively used by malicious actors for conducting postintrusion malicious activities. Cobalt Strike is a modular framework with an extensive set of features\nthat are useful to malicious actors, such as command execution, process injection, and credential\ntheft.\n\n### Credential Theft\n\nAfter obtaining system privileges on the infected machine, Bumblebee performs credential theft\nusing two methods detailed below.\n\nFirst method used is Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory dump.\nOn Windows systems domain, local usernames and passwords are stored in the memory space of\nthe LSASS process. Bumblebee dumps the memory of this process using procdump64.exe to\naccess the sensitive information:\n\n_Bumblebee dumping lsass.exe memory as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\nThe second method of credential theft that Bumblebee operators use is registry hive extraction\nusing reg.exe:\n\n**HKLM SAM: The Security Account Manager (SAM) database is where Windows stores**\ninformation about user accounts.\n**HKLM Security: Local Security Authority (LSA) stores user logins and their LSA secrets.**\n**HKLM System: Contains keys that could be used to decrypt/encrypt the LSA secret and SAM**\ndatabase:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bumblebee extracting registry hives as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\nBumblebee operators :\n\nObtain registry dumps\nCompress the data\nExfiltrate it over their network tunnel:\n\n_Bumblebee exfiltrating dumps containing credentials as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\n\n-----\n\nBumblebee operators process retrieved credentials offline, attempting to extract cleartext\npasswords. The time between credentials theft and the next activity is approximately 3 hours.\n\n### Reconnaissance\n\nAfter the attackers gain a foothold in the organization network, they gather information in various\nways. We have observed attackers using tools such as nltest, ping, netview, tasklist and Adfind to\ncollect wide information related to the organization. The attackers collect information such as the\ndomain names, users, hosts and domain controllers.\n\n_AdFind (named “af.exe”) is a publicly available tool for querying Active Directory and has been used_\nby multiple threat actors:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bumblebee executed multiple reconnaissance commands as seen in the Cybereason Defense_\n_Platform_\n\nDuring the reconnaissance phase, Bumblebee operators contacted more than 200 IP addresses\nand domain names within the organization. The most notable ones are Microsoft Exchange,\nWindows Server Update Services (WSUS) servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following table summarizes the reconnaissance commands observed by Cybereason GSOC\nanalysts:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n_nltest /domain_trusts_ Enumerates trust relationships in a Windows Active Directory (AD)\nenvironment.\n\n_nltest /dclist:_ Enumerates all domain controllers in the domain.\n\n\n_af.exe -f \"_\n_(objectcategory=person)\"_\n\n_> ad_users.txt_\n\n_af.exe -f_\n_\"objectcategory=computer\"_\n\n_> ad_computers.txt_\n\n\nEnumerates all user objects in Active Directory and stores the\noutput in a file.\n\nEnumerates all computer objects in Active Directory and stores the\noutput in a file.\n\n\n_whoami /all_ Displays all information in the current access token, including the\ncurrent user name, security identifiers (SID), privileges, and groups\nthat the current user belongs to.\n\n_curl ifconfig[.]me_ Retrieves the publicly visible IP address of the machine using an\nexternal service.\n\n_ping {hostname} -n 1_ Enumerates live hosts.\n\n_Tasklist /s {IP address}_ Enumerates a list of processes on a specific host.\n\n\n_net user {username}_\n_/domain_\n\n_net group \"domain admins\"_\n_/domain_\n\n\nSwitch forces the net user to execute on the current domain\ncontroller instead of on the local computer.\n\nEnumerates users that are members of the domain admins group\nsuch that the designated Domain Controller (DC) is conducting the\nenumeration activity.\n\n\n_net view \\\\{IP address} /all_ Enumerates all shared computers and resources on a specific\nsystem.\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nBumblebee uses a Cobalt Strike agent for lateral movement. We can see multiple connections from\nthe process to internal addresses on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on TCP port 3389:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bumblebee lateral movement from Cobalt Strike agent as seen in the Cybereason Defense_\n_Platform_\n\nFollowing the lateral movement, the attacker persists on the organization network using the remote\nmanagement software “any desk”:\n\n_Bumblebee operators using Anydesk for lateral movement as seen in the Cybereason Defense_\n_Platform_\n\n### Active Directory Compromise\n\nAfter the attacker obtains a highly privileged user and its password, the attacker accesses the\nshadow copy. Shadow Copy is a technology included in Microsoft Windows that can create backup\ncopies or snapshots of computer files or volumes.\n\nBumblebee accesses the remote Active Directory machines using Windows Management\nInstrumentation command-line utility (WMIC) and creates a shadow copy using vssadmin\ncommand. In addition, the attacker steals the ntds.dit file from the domain controller.\n\nThe ntds.dit file is a database that stores Active Directory data, including information about user\nobjects, groups and group membership. The file also stores the password hashes for all users in\nthe domain:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bumblebee creates shadow copies on remote Active Directory server and exfiltrates Ntds.dit as_\n_seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\nThe following are the commands related to credential theft used to escalate privileges on the Active\nDirectory:\n\n**_​wmic /node:\"[Active Directory IP address]\" /user:\"[Compromised user name]\" /password:\"_**\n\n_[Compromised user password]\" process call create \"cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C:_\n_2>&1\"_\n\n**_wmic /node:\"[Active Directory IP address]\" /user:\"[Compromised user name]\" /password:\"_**\n\n_[Compromised user password]\" process call create \"cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >>_\n_c:\\log.txt\"_\n\n**_type \\\\[Active Directory IP address]\\c$\\log.txt_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_wmic /node: [Active Directory IP address] /user: [Compromised user name] /password:_**\n\n_[Compromised user password]\" process call create \"cmd /c copy \\\\?_\n_\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy635\\Windows\\NTDS\\NTDS.dit_\n_c:\\ProgramData\\nt & copy \\\\?_\n_\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy635\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SYSTEM_\n_c:\\ProgramData\\nt & copy \\\\?_\n_\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy635\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SECURITY_\n_c:\\ProgramData\\nt\"_\n\n**_7za.exe a -mx3 nt.7z \\\\[Active Directory IP address]\\c$\\ProgramData\\nt_**\n\nIn order to obtain maximum privileges on the Active Directory domain, the threat actor:\n\nCreates a shadow copy of the machine file’s volume\nLists all available shadow copies and stored the result in a file.\nCopies the Active Directory database (ntds.dit) as well as registry hives containing credentials\nand sensitive data from the shadow copy.\nCompress the output directory for exfiltration.\n\n### Account Creation and Data Exfiltration\n\nThe threat actor uses a domain administrator account obtained previously to move laterally on\nmultiple systems. After initial connection, they create a local user and exfiltrate data using Rclone\nsoftware.\n\nUser creation commands are as follows :\n\nnet user [Attacker created username] P@ssw0rd!1 /add\nnet localgroup Administrators [Attacker created username] /add\n\n_Creation of a local user and exfiltration of data using rclone.exe as seen in the Cybereason_\n_Defense Platform_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe rclone.exe process transfers approximately 50 GB of data to an endpoint with an IP address\nover TCP port 22 (SSH), which is located in the United States.\n\n## Detection and Prevention\n\n### Cybereason Defense Platform\n\n[The Cybereason Defense Platform is able to detect and prevent infections with Bumblebee and](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\npost exploitation activities, using multi-layer protection that detects and blocks malware with threat\nintelligence, machine learning, and Next-Gen Antivirus (NGAV) capabilities:\n\n_The Cybereason Defense Platform labels as suspicious the execution of a malicious Bumblebee_\n_DLL script using odbcconf.exe_\n\n_The Cybereason Defense Platform detects the credential theft with both reg.exe and_\n_procdump64.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\n_The Cybereason Defense Platform detects data exfiltration activities_\n\n_The Cybereason Defense Platform detects a Meterpreter agent_\n\n## Cybereason GSOC MDR\n\nThe Cybereason GSOC recommends the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nEnable the Anti-Malware feature on the Cybereason NGAV and enable the Detect and\nPrevent modes of this feature.\nSecurely handle files downloaded from the Internet and email messages that originate from\nexternal sources.\nRegularly backup files to a secured remote location and implement a data recovery plan.\nRegular data backups ensure that you can restore your data after a ransomware attack.\nUse secure passwords, regularly rotate passwords, and use multi-factor authentication where\npossible.\nFollow [Best Practices for Securing Active Directory provided by Microsoft.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/best-practices-for-securing-active-directory)\nTo hunt for infections with Bumblebee proactively, use the Investigation screen in the\nCybereason Defense Platform and the query in the Hunting Queries section to search for\nmachines that are potentially infected with this malware. Based on the search results, take\nfurther remediation actions such as isolating the infected machines.\n\nCybereason is dedicated to teaming with defenders to end cyber attacks from endpoints to the\n[enterprise to everywhere.
