While DHS does not endorse any particular company or their findings, we believe the breadth of literature created by multiple sources enhances the overall understanding of the threat. DHS encourages analysts to review these resources to determine the level of threat posed to their local network environments.\n\n DHS Resources\n\n JAR-16-20296 provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. Government, political, and private sector entities. JAR-16-20296 remains a useful resource for understanding APT28 and APT29 use of the cyber kill chain and exploit targets. Additionally, JAR-16-20296 discusses some of the differences in activity between APT28 and APT29. This AR primarily focuses on APT28 and APT29 activity from 2015 through 2016.\n\n DHS Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR)-10105049 UPDATE 2 was updated January 27, 2017 to provide additional analysis of the artifacts identified in JAR 16-20296. The artifacts analyzed in this report include 17 PHP files, 3 executables and 1 RTF file. The PHP files are web shells designed to provide a remote user an interface for various remote operations. The RTF file is a malicious document designed to install and execute a malicious executable. However, DHS recommends that analysts read the MIFR in full to develop a better understanding of how the GRIZZLY STEPPE malware executes on a system, which, in turn, downloads additional malware and attempts to extract cached passwords. The remaining two executables are Remote Access Tools (RATs) that collect host information, including digital certificates and private keys, and provide an actor with remote access to the infected system.\n\n Open Source\n\n Several cyber security and threat research firms have written extensively about GRIZZLY STEPPE. DHS encourages network defenders, threat analysts, and general audiences to review publicly available information to develop a better understanding of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of APT28 and APT29 and to potentially mitigate against GRIZZLY STEPPE activity. \n\n The below examples do not constitute an exhaustive list. The U.S. Government does not endorse or support any particular product or vendor.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ESET En Route with Sednit - Part 2: Observing the Comings and Goings ATP 28\n\n|Source|Title|Group|\n|---|---|---|\n|Crowdstrike|Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the DNC|APT28/2 9|\n|ESET|En Route with Sednit version 1.0|APT28|\n|ESET|Visiting The Bear Den|APT28|\n|FireEye|APT28: A Window Into Russia's Cyber Espionage Operations?|APT28|\n|FireEye|HAMMERTOSS: Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cyber Threat Group|APT29|\n|FireEye|APT28: At the Center of the Storm - Russia strategically evolves its cyber operations|APT28|\n|F-Secure|BlackEnergy & Quedagh the convergence of crimeware and APT attacks, TLP: WHITE|APT28|\n|F-Secure|The Dukes 7 years of Russian cyberespionage|APT29|\n|F-Secure|COSMICDUKE: Cosmu with a twist of MiniDuke|APT29|\n|F-Secure|OnionDuke: APT Attacks Via the Tor Network|APT29|\n|F-Secure|COZYDUKE|APT29|\n|Kaspersky|Sofacy APT hits high profile targets with updated toolset|APT28|\n|Crysys|Miniduke: Indicators|APT29|\n|Palo Alto Networks|‘DealersChoice’ is Sofacy’s Flash Player Exploit Platform|APT28|\n|Palo Alto Networks|Sofacy’s ‘Komplex’ OS X Trojan|APT28|\n|Palo Alto Networks|The Dukes R&D Finds a New Anti-Analysis Technique - Palo Alto Networks Blog|APT29|\n|Palo Alto Networks|Tracking MiniDionis: CozyCar’s New Ride Is Related to Seaduke|APT29|\n|PwC|APT28: Sofacy?

The phases of the Cyber Kill Chain are Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and Actions on the Objective. This section will provide a high-level overview of GRIZZLY STEPPE activity within this framework. \n\n Reconnaissance\n\n GRIZZLY STEPPE actors use various reconnaissance methods to determine the best attack vector for compromising their targets. These methods include network vulnerability scanning, credential harvesting, and using “doppelganger” (also known as “typo-squatting”) domains to target victim organizations. The doppelganger domains can be used for reconnaissance when users incorrectly type in the web address in a browser or as part of delivery as a URL in the body of a phishing emails. DHS recommends that network defenders review and monitor their networks for traffic to sites that look similar to their own domains. This can be an indicator of compromise that should trigger further research to determine whether a breach has occurred. Often, these doppelganger sites are registered to suspicious IP addresses. For example, a site pretending to be an organization’s User Log In resolving to a TOR node IP address may be considered suspicious and should be researched by the organization’s security operations center (SOC) for signs of users navigating to that site. Because these doppelganger sites normally mimic the targeted victim’s domain, they were not included in JAR-16-20296. \n\n Before the 2016 U.S. election, DHS observed network scanning activity that is known as reconnaissance. The IPs identified performed vulnerability scans attempting to identify websites that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks. When GRIZZLY STEPPE actors identify a vulnerable site, they can then attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the targeted network. Network perimeter scans are often a precursor to network attacks and DHS recommends that security analysts identify the types of scans carried out against their perimeters. This information can aid security analysts in identifying and patching vulnerabilities in their systems.\n\n Another common method used by GRIZZLY STEPPE is to host credential-harvesting pages as seen in Step 4 and Step 5 of the GRIZZLY STEPPE attack lifecycle graphic. This technique includes hosting a temporary website in publicly available infrastructure (i.e., neutral space) that users are directed to via spear-phishing emails. Users are tricked into entering their credentials in these temporary sites, and GRIZZLY STEPPE actors gain legitimate credentials for users on the targeted network. \n\n\n-----\n\n### Weaponization\n\n GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have excelled at embedding malicious code into a number of file types as part of their weaponization efforts. In 2014, it was reported that GRIZZLY STEPPE actors were wrapping legitimate executable files with malware (named “OnionDuke”) to increase the chance of bypassing security controls. Since weaponization actions occur within the adversary space, there is little that can be detected by security analysts during this phase. APT28 and APT29 weaponization methods have included:\n\n  Code injects in websites as watering hole attacks\n  Malicious macros in Microsoft Office files\n  Malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) files with embedded malicious flash code\n\n Delivery\n\n As described in JAR-16-20296 and numerous publicly available resources, GRIZZLY STEPPE actors traditionally use spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious attachments or URLs that lead to malicious payloads. DHS recommends that network defenders conduct analysis of their systems to identify potentially malicious emails involving variations on GRIZZLY STEPPE themes. Inbound emails subjects should be reviewed for the following commonly employed titles, text, and themes:\n\n  efax, e-Fax, efax #100345 (random sequence of numbers)\n  PDF, PFD, Secure PDF\n  Topics from current events (e.g., “European Parliament statement on…”)\n  Fake Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) log-in emails\n  Invites for cyber threat events\n Additionally, GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have infected pirated software in torrent services and leveraged TOR exit nodes to deliver to malware since at least 2014. These actors are capable of compromising legitimate domains and services to host and deliver malware in an attempt to obscure their delivery methods. DHS notes that the majority of TOR traffic is not GRIZZLY STEPPE activity. The existence of a TOR IP in a network log only indicates that network administrators should review the related traffic to determine if it is legitimate activity for that specific environment. \n Exploitation\n\n GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have developed malware to exploit a number of Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs). DHS assesses that these actors commonly target Microsoft Office exploits due to the high likelihood of having this software installed on the targeted hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n### While not all-encompassing, the following CVEs have been targeted by GRIZZLY STEPPE actors in past attacks. \n\n  CVE-2016-7855: Adobe Flash Player Use-After-Free Vulnerability\n  CVE-2016-7255: Microsoft Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n  CVE-2016-4117: Adobe Flash Player Remoted Attack Vulnerability\n  CVE-2015-1641: Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n  CVE-2015-2424: Microsoft PowerPoint Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n  CVE-2014-1761: Microsoft Office Denial of Service (Memory Corruption) \n  CVE-2013-2729: Integer Overflow in Adobe Reader and Acrobat vulnerability\n  CVE-2012-0158: ActiveX Corruption Vulnerability for Microsoft Office \n  CVE-2010-3333: RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability for Microsoft Office \n  CVE-2009-3129: Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Remote Attacks \n\n Installation\n\n GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have leveraged several different types of implants in the past. Analysts can research these implants by reviewing open-source reporting on malware families including Sofacy, and Onion Duke. Recently, DHS analyzed 17 PHP files, 3 executables, and 1 RTF file attributed to GRIZZLY STEPPE actors and the findings are located in MIFR- 10105049-Update2 (updated on 1/26/2017). The PHP files are web shells designed to provide a user interface for various remote operations. The RTF file is a malicious document designed to install and execute a malicious executable. DHS recommends that security analysts review their systems for unauthorized web shells. \n\n Command and Control\n\n GRIZZLY STEPPE actors leverage their installed malware through Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, which they traditionally develop via compromised sites and publicly available infrastructure, such as TOR. C2 IOCs are traditionally the IP addresses or domains that are leveraged to send and receive commands to and from malware implants. \n\n Actions on the Objective\n\n GRIZZLY STEPPE actors have leveraged their malware in multiple campaigns with various end goals. GRIZZLY STEPPE actors are capable of utilizing their malware to conduct extensive data exfiltration of sensitive files, emails, and user credentials. Security operation center (SOC) analysts may be able to detect actions on the objective before data exfiltration occurs by looking for signs of files and user credential movement within their network. \n\n\n-----\n\n## Detection and Response\n\n### The appendixes of this Analysis Report provide detailed host and network signatures to aid in detecting and mitigating GRIZZLY STEPPE activity. This information is broken out by actor  and implant version whenever possible. MIFR-10105049 UPDATE2 provides additional YARA rules and IOCs associated with APT28 and APT29 actors. \n\n## Contact Information\n\n### Recipients of this report are encouraged to contribute any additional information that they may have related to this threat.

Deploying a webshell typically requires adding to, or modifying, the code presented by the web server and is often accomplished via an exploit of a web server vulnerability. Patching all components that service the web server provides a substantial mitigation against most commonly known vulnerabilities.\n  Adhere to least privilege principles for server access and management. Through following\n the principle of least privilege, lateral movement and privilege escalation is made more challenging to an attacker by restricting access on the box and across the network.\n  Restrict write access to all folders that contain files served by the web server. All content\n served by the web server should be tightly controlled in such a way that only web administrator accounts can modify or add content. This would force an attacker to gain specific sets of credentials before they could add any malicious content to be delivered by the server.\n  Restrict access to all ports and administrative panels. Server ports are typically very\n predictable, and access to those ports should be constrained to only the services and users that require them. This will reduce the attack surface on the web server and supporting applications.\n  Deploy and configure Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) on supported Linux specific\n systems. SELinux has the capability to lock down web services such as Apache and can be configured to allow the service to access only certain directories. The administrators could possibly include /var/www/html, which contains the actual pages being served up. If a site has upload capabilities, then SELinux could help with least privilege by restricting read/write access on these folders as well. The web service already runs in a lower privilege context, but SELinux would also limit the file locations that it can actually access. This would prevent arbitrary file writes and possible malware uploads to areas that an admin would not normally detect.\n  Conduct regular vulnerability scans and establish a remediation strategy focusing on the most\n detrimental findings first. Regular scanning and remediation measures will remove opportunities to exploit known attack vectors by an adversary.\n  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF). WAF technologies defend against common web\n exploitation techniques such as SQL injection and cross site scripting. Deploying this capability helps reduce the likelihood of a successful web attack on the server that could otherwise allow the perpetrator to modify code and deploy the webshell.\n\n\n-----\n\n###  Where third party products are integrated into the website (e.g., Adobe ColdFusion) ensure\n that the product is configured according to DoD or vendor published hardening best practices.[1]\n\n#### Detect\n\n###  Conduct regular log review. Key sources should include the network and host firewalls,\n Intrusion Prevention System, proxy, and local event logs. Events of interest should include high usage rates to suspicious IPs, odd timestamps on web files (dates that don’t match previous content updates), odd connections destined for internal networks, suspicious files in internet accessible locations, references to key words such as cmd.exe or eval.[4] Auditing should involve some kind of aggregator to store and secure the logs remotely. Even the best auditing on the web server is useless if the attacker can just manipulate or delete them once they have obtained control. The logs should be protected and regularly rolled up to a centralized location for integration into a security information and event management system.\n  Develop all content in an offline environment and maintain a hash list of all web files.\n Frequently compare the hashes of the files on the web server to the known good list maintained offline (an automated method is preferred).\n  Obtain regular full system backups (including snapshots if it is a virtual machine).\n Forensically the known good data that these can provide is extremely useful for detection. Having a copy of the filesystem before a compromise to compare against the post- compromise filesystem can be a benefit to any analysis. \n  Analyze traffic flows looking for certain anomalous behaviors such as prolonged\n connections, data frequently being pushed to the server (e.g., commands being sent to the shell), frequent large data transfers (an indication of data exfiltration), and abnormal encryption (anything that is not SSL/TLS or that negotiates using an alternate certificate) as indicators of potential nefarious activity.[2]\n\n#### Contain\n\n###  Internet facing web servers should be deployed to a DMZ. All traffic to internal networks\n from the DMZ should be significantly constrained and highly monitored.\n  Restrict outbound communications from the DMZ to all other networks. Communications\n originating in the DMZ destined for the internal network should be minimal at most (ideally this should never happen). An attacker who gains access to a web server in the DMZ should have no capability to leverage that access in order to gain direct additional access in the internal network. Web server communications to the internet should be restricted to http/https only. All other ports and protocols should be blocked. \n\n#### 1 https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/community-documentation/coldfusion-lockdown-guide.html 2 https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-314A\n\n\n-----\n\n###  When a Domain Controller (DC) is necessary in the DMZ, it is recommended that a\n standalone DC and forest structure be deployed. Additionally, all accounts and resources in the DMZ instance should have no association or likeness to the internal network. \n  Ensure separation of admin accounts. The web admin account should not be the same admin\n account that is used elsewhere on the domain. \n\n#### Respond\n\n###  When a compromise is found, reset all credentials associated with the webserver (this may\n expand to all accounts in the DMZ if it is suspected that the compromise has expanded to the DC). This should include all user and service accounts, all domain accounts that have logged onto that host and all local accounts, to include the Kerberos master ticket granting ticket on the DC. Depending on the circumstances, it may also be necessary to take the suspected server(s) or network offline during the remediation process.\n  All server files should be wiped and restored from a known good source. The organization\n should prepare for a disaster recovery situation that includes a system compromise. Regular backups and offline storage of the data files should be made before being transferred to the DMZ production environment.\n  When all other response techniques have failed at remediating the suspected compromise, the\n server(s) should be completely rebuilt or replaced. All data reconstitution efforts should stem from a known good source (offline backup). \n Defending Against Spear Phishing Attacks\n\n#### Defend\n\n###  Enforce application whitelisting on all endpoint workstations to prevent droppers or\n unauthorized software from gaining execution on endpoints. Many phishing attacks involve an executable that is dropped and installed on the victim’s machine. Application Whitelisting will allow the organization to monitor programs and allow only those that are on the approved whitelist to execute. This would help to stop the initial attack, even if the user has clicked the link or opened a malicious attachment. There are many baseline rulesets that come with the vendor product, but the organization should ensure that at least the user Temp directories are blocked for execution since this is where numerous phishing emails attempt to drop and execute malware.\n  Disable Macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing code through\n an attached office document. Macros were often used as a means for initial exploitation in the late 1990s and early 2000s but have seen a recent resurgence in frequency of use. Some office products allow for the disabling of macros that originate from outside of the organization and can provide a hybrid approach when the organization depends on the legitimate use of macros. For Windows, specific settings can be configured to block Internet originated macros from running. This can be done in the Group Policy Administrative Templates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). For example, to enable the policy setting for Microsoft Word 2016, in the\n\n\n-----\n\n### Group Policy Management Editor, select: User Configuration > Administrative Templates\n > Microsoft Word 2016 > Word Options > Security > Trust Center > Block macros from running in Office files from the Internet[3]\n  Utilize up to date web browsers on the network for increased security enhancements. These\n improvements may include a sandboxing feature that would allow the browser to contain any malicious content and protect the endpoint if an emailed link is clicked.\n  Deploy web and email filters on the network and configure these devices to scan for known\n bad domains, sources, and addresses; block these before messages are received and downloaded. This action will help to reduce the attack surface at the network’s first level of defense. In addition, attachments should be filtered. The network defenses should only allow approved extensions to pass through to the email client. Most .exe, scripting extensions (including .bat, .js, and .ps1) and other executable extensions should be blocked.\n  Scan all emails, attachments, and downloads both on host and at the mail gateway with a\n reputable antivirus solution that includes cloud reputation services. Taking advantage of cloud reputation advancements provides rapid response capabilities and the integration of a broad base of cyber defense intelligence. \n  Organizations should ensure that they have disabled HTML from being used in emails, as\n well as disabling links. Everything should be forced to plain text. This will reduce the likelihood of potentially dangerous scripts or links being sent in the body of the email, and also will reduce the likelihood of a user just clicking something without thinking about it. With plain text, the user would have to go through the process of either typing in the link or copying and pasting. This additional step will allow the user an extra opportunity for thought and analysis before clicking on the link.\n  Establish a training mechanism to inform end users on proper email and web usage as well as\n common indicators of phishing to be aware of. This training should be done at least annually and should include a test that is scored and available for viewing by management and/or the IT Security department. The training should inform users what suspicious emails look like, what to do when they suspect phishing, as well as explain what they should post on any websites in terms of personally identifiable information (PII) that may be used for phishing campaigns (including email addresses, job titles, names, etc.). Consider real life interactive training simulations where users are sent suspicious emails on a semi regular basis and subsequently redirected to a phishing training site should they fail to adhere to the organization’s best practices and policies.\n\n#### Detect\n\n###  Monitor event logs, email logs, and firewall logs for any indicators of a potential attack.\n These could include emails from suspicious domains, installation of programs on machines\n\n#### 3 https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2016/03/22/new-feature-in-office-2016-can-block- macros-and-help-prevent-infection/\n\n\n-----\n\n### that are unusual or not approved, unusual call outs to the internet from office products, non- smtp traffic from the email client, strange child processes under the parent office process, or spoofed domains sending or receiving traffic from the network. Strange Traffic/Behavior (e.g., Spamming others) should also be looked for in the various logs. This is a strong indicator that machine(s) are compromised in some way.\n  Using the antivirus software that is installed on the mailbox server and all of the clients,\n review the alerts and logs regularly for any activity on the network. The sooner detection can take place, the sooner remediation steps can start, and the amount of damage can be minimalized. \n  Users play an important role in the detection of spear phishing if they understand the proper\n reporting procedures of the organization. Users should be able to identify the correct handling and alerting procedure that the users should follow for any suspicious email they receive.\n  Using the logs from the organizations firewalls/filters/security devices/workstations,\n administrators should always ensure that their whitelisted and blacklisted domains are up to date. Admins should also check DoD blacklists for known bad domains and add these to their filters as well. Using these logs and lists, the organization may benefit from other incidents that have occurred to help in the future\n\n#### Contain\n\n###  Utilize application containment products that can be used to prevent the downloading and\n propagation of malicious software on the network. If the organization is using some form of web email, the browser must be containerized. If the organization is using a program for email (e.g., Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird), then that program should be containerized for protection. The Application Containment will open the browser or email program in its own Virtual Machine and isolate it from the rest of the system. This allows the execution of potential malware in a sandboxed environment so the host system is protected.\n  Implement front and back end email servers when running on site instantiations of mail\n services. Having a front-end server allows the organization to have an extra layer of protection on the network since the front-end mailbox server contains no user data and allows a firewall to be placed before the back end server. This is also safer and more convenient for any web accessed email since web traffic is not being allowed directly into the network, protects from denial-of-service attacks, and authenticates requests before proxying them to the back end server.[4]\n  Control where and when an administrator can log on, as well as what they can do when\n logged onto a system. This can minimize the damage of a spear phishing attack. Admins should never be allowed to browse the internet, nor should they be allowed to open any email program. This will reduce the likelihood of an accidental click or download of a program that could be malicious. This also will reduce the chances that a successful attacker will gain\n\n#### 4 https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124804(v=exchg.65).aspx\n\n\n-----\n\n### admin privileges immediately when they gain access to the system. Organizations can accomplish this restriction a number of ways, including application whitelisting, VLAN separation, dedicated administrator boxes, etc.\n  Ensure that standard user accounts are not a part of the local administrators group. The local\n administrator account should also be denied network access and all built in local administrator accounts should have a unique password value. It is a common tactic to look for local administrator credentials as a method of expanding access across the network. Making these values unique for each machine and denying that account network access removes the attacker’s capability to easily expand access using the same credentials[5]. \n\n#### Respond\n\n###  If a phishing email is discovered or suspected, the organization needs to start their normal\n investigation procedures. It may be as simple as deleting that email and updating the email filter to prevent this address/domain from sending to the organization again, but it could also trigger a normal incident response. If the email contained a link that was clicked, an attachment that was downloaded, or a program that was executed, the organization may have to remove any malicious content, discover the extent of the possible spread, detail any exfiltration of data, or even remove the affected machine(s) or rebuild them.\n  Reset user credentials and all credentials associated with all compromised boxes. This should\n include services accounts and machine accounts as well as the supporting Kerberos tickets. \n  Monitor all accounts associated with the spear-phishing event. User accounts who are\n suspected to have been the victim of a successful phishing campaign should be forensically monitored for abnormal behaviors including unusual connections to non-standard resources, attempts to elevate privileges, enumeration behaviors on the local host machine as well as remote systems, and attempts to execute odd programs or applications.\n\n#### 5 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036\n\n\n-----\n\n## APPENDIX D: Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR)-10105049 UPDATE 2 (TLP WHITE) \n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) - 10105049-Update2\n\n 2017-01-23\n\n#### Notification\n\nThis report is provided \"as is\" for informational purposes only.

For\nexample, the malware searches the Windows registry for keys utilized by multiple types of Windows email software. If found, the malware\nattempts to extract email passwords from these keys. This appears to be an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the victim users emails.\n\nIn addition, the software attempts to find registry keys used by the Windows file management software named Total Commander. This\nappears to be an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the victim users stored files. The software also contains a list of commonly used\npasswords. This indicates the malware provides an operator the capability to brute force their way into a victim users email accounts or\nlocations where their files are stored.

infection:\n\nprivate.directinvesting.com\ncderlearn.com\n204.12.12.40\n209.236.67.159\n176.114.0.120\neditprod.waterfilter.in.ua\ninsta.reduct.ru\n146.185.161.126\none2shoppee.com\nritsoperrol.ru\nlittjohnwilhap.ru\nwilcarobbe.com\nmymodule.waterfilter.in.ua/system/logs/xtool.exe\n176.114.0.157\n\nUS-CERT would like to remind users and administrators of the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their\norganization's systems:\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the\nfile header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumbdrives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats; implement appropriate ACLs.\n\n#### Contact Information\n\n1-888-282-0870\nsoc@us-cert.gov (UNCLASS)\nus-cert@dhs.sgov.gov (SIPRNET)\nus-cert@dhs.ic.gov (JWICS)\n\nUS-CERT continuously strives to improve its products and services. You can help by answering a very short series of questions about this\nproduct at the following URL: https://forms.us-cert.gov/ncsd-feedback/\n\n#### Document FAQ\n\n**What is a MIFR? A Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) is intended to provide organizations with malware analysis in a timely manner. In**\nmost instances this report will provide initial indicators for computer and network defense. To request additional analysis, please contact\nUS-CERT and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nshould be directed to the US-CERT Security Operations Center at 1-888-282-0870 or soc@us-cert.gov.\n\n**Can I submit malware to US-CERT? US-CERT encourages you to report any suspicious activity, including cybersecurity incidents, poss ble**\nmalicious code, software vulnerabilities, and phishing-related scams. Reporting forms can be found on US-CERT's homepage at www.uscert.gov. Malware samples can be submitted via https://malware.us-cert.gov.
