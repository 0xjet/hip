These IP addresses and files are known to be used in](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ransomware-maze/)\nprevious attacks by the Maze ransomware actors.\n\nThere was also a hash for a new unnamed file, but there is no further information about it.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Security research Vitali Kremez has released a Yara rule that can be used to detect the](https://github.com/k-vitali/Malware-Misc-RE/blob/master/2020-04-18-maze-ransomware-unpacked-payload.vk.yar)\nMaze Ransomware DLL.\n\nWhen we contacted the Maze operators about this attack, they deny being responsible.\n\nIn the past, Maze has been reticent to discuss attacks or victims until negotiations stall. As\nthis attack is very recent, Maze is likely not discussing it to avoid complications in what they\nhope would be potential ransom payment.\n\nAfter reporting on this attack, Cognizant posted a statement to their web site that confirms\nthe cyber attack was by Maze Ransomware:\n\nCognizant can confirm that a security incident involving our internal systems, and causing\nservice disruptions for some of our clients, is the result of a Maze ransomware attack.\n\nOur internal security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, are actively\ntaking steps to contain this incident. Cognizant has also engaged with the appropriate law\nenforcement authorities.\n\nWe are in ongoing communication with our clients and have provided them with Indicators of\nCompromise (IOCs) and other technical information of a defensive nature\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat actors were likely on the network for weeks\n\nIf the Maze operators conducted this attack, they were likely present in Cognizant's network\nfor weeks, if not longer.\n\nWhen enterprise-targeting ransomware operators breach a network, they will slowly and\nstealthily spread laterally throughout the system as they steal files and steal credentials.\n\nOnce the attackers gain administrator credentials on the network, they will then deploy the\nransomware using tools like PowerShell Empire.\n\n## If it was Maze, it must be treated as a data breach\n\nBefore deploying ransomware, the Maze operators always steal unencrypted files before\nencrypting them.\n\nThese files are then used as further leverage to have the victim pay the ransom as Maze will\nthreaten to [release the data if a victim does not pay.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-not-getting-paid-leaks-data-left-and-right/)\n\n**Chubb info on Maze news site**\nThese are not idle threats as Maze has created a \"News' site that is used to publish stolen\ndata from non-paying victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf Maze was not behind the attack as they claim, there is still a good chance that data was\nstolen as that has become a standard tactic used by ransomware operators.\n\nFor this reason, all ransomware attacks must be treated as data breaches.\n\n_This is a developing story._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
