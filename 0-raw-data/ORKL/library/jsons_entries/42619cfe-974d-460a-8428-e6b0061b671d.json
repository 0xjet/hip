Security Joes\n\nAnother case of particular interest is ‘lsassDumper’, a custom tool also written in GoLang,\nused by the actors for automatic exfiltration from the LSASS process to the “transfer.sh”\nservice.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity Joes claims this is the first time lsassDumper has been spotted in the wild, which\nagain demonstrates the particular threat actor’s capacity and sophistication.\n\n**lsassDumper**\n\n**code snippet** _(Security Joes)_\nAlso, direct dumping of credentials from LSASS is another typical method of ransomware\ngangs, so it's another element that backs this hypothesis.\n\nFinally, the network infiltrators used ADFind for network reconnaissance, a freely available\ntool that adversaries use to gather information from the Active Directory, also very common\nin the ransomware space.\n\n“Based on the behavior, the tools seen in this intrusion and the targeted sectors, we\nconcluded that the attackers behind this operation are tightly related to a Russian-speaking\nransomware gang, which is taking tools used by other groups and adding their personal\nsignature to them.” - concludes the report from Security Joes.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Ligolo](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ligolo/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russian](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russian/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
