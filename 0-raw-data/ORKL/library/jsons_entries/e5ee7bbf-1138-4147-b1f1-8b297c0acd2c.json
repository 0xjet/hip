Motion sensor data was used to evade detection.\n\nBy: Kevin Sun January 17, 2019 Read time: ( words)\n\nWe recently found two malicious apps on Google Play that drop wide-reaching banking\nmalware. The two apps were disguised as useful tools, simply named Currency Converter\nand BatterySaverMobi. Google has confirmed that both these apps are no longer on the Play\nStore.\n\nThe battery app logged more than 5,000 downloads before it was taken down, and boasted a\nscore of 4.5 stars from 73 reviewers. However, a close look at the posted reviews show signs\nthat they may not have been valid; some anonymous usernames were spotted and a few\nreview statements are illogical and lack detail.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe looked into this campaign and found that the apps dropped a malicious payload that we\n[can safely link to the known banking malware Anubis (detected by Trend Micro as](https://securityintelligence.com/anubis-strikes-again-mobile-malware-continues-to-plague-users-in-official-app-stores/)\nANDROIDOS_ANUBISDROPPER ). Upon analysis of the payload, we noted that the code is\nstrikingly similar to known Anubis samples. And we also saw that it connects to a command\nand control (C&C) server with the domain aserogeege.space, which is linked to Anubis as\nwell.\n\nBesides aserogeege.space, 18 other malicious domains map to the IP address 47.254.26.2\nand we confirmed that Anubis uses the subpath of these domains. These domains change IP\naddresses quite frequently and may have switched six times since October 2018, showing\njust how active this particular campaign is.\n\n[Fig 1.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis1a.png)\n\n[Fig 1.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis1b.png)\n\n[Fig 1.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis1c.png)\n\n_Figure 1.

Victim distribution for all BatterySaveMobi samples_\n\n**How the apps evade detection**\n\nThese apps don’t just use traditional evasion techniques; they also try to use the user and\ndevice’s motions to hide their activities.\n\nAs a user moves, their device usually generates some amount of motion sensor data. The\nmalware developer is assuming that the sandbox for scanning malware is an emulator with\nno motion sensors, and as such will not create that type of data. If that is the case, the\ndeveloper can determine if the app is running in a sandbox environment by simply checking\nfor sensor data.\n\nThe malicious app monitors the user's steps through the device motion sensor. If it senses\nthat the user and the device are not moving (if it lacks sensor data and thus, might be\nrunning in a sandbox environment), then the malicious code will not run.\n\n[Fig 2.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis2.png)\n\n_Figure 2. The malware tracks the user's movement; the malicious code will run if it senses_\n_motion_\n\n**Command** **Action**\n\n\n-----\n\n_“::apk::”_ _Download apk and trick user to install_\n\n_“kill”_ _Stop running malicious code_\n\n_Table 2. C&C server commands_\n\nIf the malicious code runs, then the app will try to trick the users into downloading and\ninstalling its payload APK with a fake system update.\n\n[Fig 3.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis3.png)\n\n_Figure 3. Fake system update_\n\nOne of the ways the app developers hide the malicious server is by encoding it in Telegram\nand Twitter webpage requests. The bank malware dropper will request Telegram or Twitter\nafter it trusts the running device. By parsing the response’s HTML content, it gets the C&C\nserver (aserogeege.space). Then, it registers with the C&C server and checks for commands\nwith an HTTP POST request. If the server responds to the app with an APK command and\nattaches the download URL, then the Anubis payload will be dropped in the background. It\nwill try and trick users into installing it with the fake system update seen in Figure 3.\n\n[Fig 4.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis4.png)\n\n_Figure 4. The encoded server URL, showing the text results in the URL of the C&C server_\n\n**The Anubis payload**\n\nThe Anubis malware masquerades as a benign app, prompts the user to grant it accessibility\nrights, and also tries to steal account information. Banking trojans usually launch a fake\noverlay screen when the user accesses a target app and tries to steal information when the\nuser inputs account credentials into the overlay. However, Anubis’ process is a little different.\nIt has a built-in keylogger that can simply steal a users’ account credentials by logging the\nkeystrokes. The malware can also take a screenshot of the infected users’ screen, which is\nanother way to get the victims credentials.\n\nOur data shows that the latest version of Anubis has been distributed to 93 different\ncountries and targets the users of 377 variations of financial apps to farm account details.\nWe can also see that, if Anubis successfully runs, an attacker would gain access to contact\nlists as well as location. It would also have the ability to record audio, send SMS messages,\nmake calls, and alter external storage. Anubis can use these permissions to send spam\nmessages to contacts, call numbers from the device, and other malicious activities. Previous\nresearch from security company Quick Heal Technologies shows that versions of Anubis\neven function as a ransomware.\n\n[Fig 5.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/01/anubis5.png)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Some of the financial apps Anubis targets_\n\nGaps in mobile security can lead to severe consequences for many users because devices\nare used to hold so much information and connect to many different accounts. Users should\nbe wary of any app that asks for banking credentials in particular and be sure that they are\nlegitimately linked to their bank.\n\n**_Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\nTrend Micro’s [Mobile App Reputation Service](https://mars.trendmicro.com/)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**_SHA256 and URLs_** **_Definitions_**\n\n\nb012eb5538ad1d56c5bdf9fe9562791a163dffa4\nbc87c9fffcdac4eea1b84c62842ce1138fd90ed6\n7e025e21d445be9b6b12a9181ada4bab3db5819c\ne29c814c2527ebbac11398877beea2bc75b58ffd\n\n\nIoCs\n\n\n16fc9bc96f58ba35a04ade2d961b0108d135caa5 Payload\n\n\nareadozemode.space selectnew25mode.space twethujsnu.cc\nproject2anub.xyz taiprotectsq.xyz uwannaplaygame.space\nprojectpredator.space nihaobrazzzahit.top aserogeege.space\nhdfuckedin18.top dingpsounda.space wantddantiprot.space\nprivateanbshouse.space seconddoxed.space firstdoxed.space\noauth3.html5100.com dosandiq.space protect4juls.space wijariief.space\nscradm.in\n\nTags\n\n[Mobile |](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research.html?category=trend-micro-research:environments/mobile) [Malware |](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research.html?category=trend-micro-research:threats/malware) [Research](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research.html?category=trend-micro-research:article-type/research)\n\n\nCommand\nand control\n\n\n-----",
