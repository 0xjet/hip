Since\nthe lack of information and the absence of a proper nomenclature of this malware family, we\ndecided to dub it as Revive to better track this family inside our internal Threat Intelligence\ntaxonomy.\n\nThe name Revive has been chosen since one of the functionality of the malware (called by\nthe TAs precisely “revive”) is restarting in case the malware stops working.\n\nRevive belongs to a category of malware used for persistent campaigns, as it was developed\nand tailored for a specific target. This type of malware is quite different from other famous\n[Android banking trojans, such as TeaBot or](https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/teabot-is-now-spreading-across-the-globe) [SharkBot, that are able, at the same time, to](https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/sharkbot-a-new-generation-of-android-trojan-is-targeting-banks-in-europe)\nattack multiple banks/crypto apps installed on the infected device through their modular\narchitecture.\n\nHowever, the attack’s methodologies of Revive are similar to other banking trojans as it still\nabuses the Accessibility Services to perform keylogging activities and to intercept SMS\nmessages of the victim. The combination of these features are enough to perform Account\nTakeover attacks (ATO), since TAs are able to obtain login credentials and the 2FA/OTP sent\nvia SMS by banks.\n\nSo far, both samples of Revive have a very low detection rate by Antivirus solutions (AVs).\nAs shown by Figure 2, the second sample has zero detection rate, since the malware is\nclearly still under development.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – Two samples of Revive and their AV detection\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nFigure 3 - Phishing website used to deliver Revive\nAs in the majority of cases, Revive uses different Social Engineering techniques to appear as\na legitimate app in order to mislead the victims. In fact, the malware is delivered through a\nphishing page and it hides behind a new 2FA app of the targeted bank.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the victim downloads the malware, Revive tries to obtain the Accessibility Service\nfeature through a pop-up. This permission is used for functionality, therefore monitoring and\nstealing information from the victim device.\n\nFigure 4 – Installation of Revive\nWhen the victim opens the malicious app for the first time, Revive asks to accept two\npermissions related to the SMS and phone calls. After that, a clone page (of the targeted\nbank) appears to the user (as shown in Figure 5) and if the login credentials are inserted,\nthey are sent to the C2 of the TAs. After that, the malware shows a generic home page, with\ndifferent links that redirect to the legitimate bank website.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Stolen credentials are sent to the C2\nAnalyzing the code, our hypothesis is that the developer of Revive took inspiration from an\n[open source spyware called “Teardroid”, available on GitHub[3], since there are some code](https://github.com/ScRiPt1337/Teardroid-phprat)\nand name similarities both in the application and in the C2 infrastructure used. However,\nTeardroid is a spyware with different capabilities, while Revive has been developed with a\ndifferent purpose. TAs removed some features of Teardroid and added new ones in this new\nvariant, enabling ATO attacks. This is why Revive can be considered a banking trojan\ninstead of a spyware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Teardroid project hosted on Github\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Example of comparison between Teardroid and Revive\nMoving to its C2 infrastructure, other similar features can be observed as well, since both of\nthem appear to be based on FastAPI, a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in\nPython, similar to Django/Flask.\n\n[In fact, it appears that TAs also create a variant of the Teardroid control panel [4], adapting it](https://github.com/ScRiPt1337/Teardroidv4_api)\nfor their needs during a fraud operation (e.g. collecting valid credentials, intercepting SMS\nmessages, etc..).\n\nThe following figure shows some of the similarities found during our investigation:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 – C2 infrastructure similarities\nRevive has been developed with the goal of performing ATO attacks against a specific target.\nIn order to achieve this task, the malware has three capabilities:\n\nSteal the login credentials. The following task can be achieved both with the clone\npage shown to the user and with the keylogger feature, through the abuse of the\nAccessibility Services.\nIntercept all messages received from the infected devices, with the aim of obtaining the\n2FA of the bank sent to the user via SMS.\nGrab everything that the user writes on the device (e.g credentials, messages, phone\nnumbers etc, as shown in Figure 10). Those information are saved on a local database\nand sent to the C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Information stolen by Revive and sent to the C2 server\n\nFigure 10 - Keylogger functionality\n\n[3] [https://github.com/ScRiPt1337/Teardroid-phprat](https://github.com/ScRiPt1337/Teardroid-phprat)\n\n[4] [https://github.com/ScRiPt1337/Teardroidv4_api](https://github.com/ScRiPt1337/Teardroidv4_api)\n\n## Final Considerations\n\nConcurrently to the well-known Android Banking Trojan, like SharkBot, TeaBot or\nOscorp/UBEL, that are complex malware with multiple features able to carry out advanced\nattacks like ATO/ATS, there are also small and tailored campaigns, probably conducted by\nlocal TAs. The latter types of scenarios sometimes could be more difficult to intercept, since\nthe malware are usually written from scratch (often not detected by antivirus solutions), with\nfew features tailored for only one target and the campaigns are carried out for only a few\ndays.\n\nAt the time of writing, it is difficult to make an hypothesis about the future of Revive, since the\nmalware is still in its early stages (although it is already able to perform ATO attacks); TAs\ncould improve it following multiple paths (e.g.adding new features and transform Revive into\na RAT or customizing the malware for other targets).\n\n**Appendix 1: IOCs**\n\n\n-----\n\n**IoC** **Description**\n\n\n4240473028f88a3ef54f86f1cd387f24\ncf704e63652c23c2d609e9a01659511c\n\n\nRevive samples\n\n\n80[.]85[.]153[.]49 C2 server\n\n\nbbva.appsecureguide[.]com\nbbva.european2fa[.]com\n\n\nPhishing website used to deliver Revive\n\n\n-----",
