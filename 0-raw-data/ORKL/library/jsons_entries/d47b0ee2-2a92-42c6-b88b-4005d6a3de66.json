At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/security-operations-center)\nElite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to\nthreats within minutes.\n\nWe have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our\nspace – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.\n\nOur Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat\nResponse and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU\nteam.\n\nIn TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent\nthreat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what\nrecommendations we have going forward.\n\n**Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…**\n\n## What did we find?\n\n\n-----\n\nAn information stealing malware called Mars Stealer in a customer s environment\nwithin the consumer services industry.\n\n## Summary of the Incident\n\n[The victim downloaded and executed a fake Chrome installer (chromesetup.iso) from](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b683168a7df182ec4cfc046d17fc02c59dff1edacbf21c047b47e1f503165309)\n>hxxps[:]//googleglstatupdt[.]com/LEND/ChromeSetup.iso.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ISO contains [chromesetup.exe.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/625265b4ee161c1e04c6d06904463666a2cc579d0c0cefec060db6d5ed4c4118)\n\nWhen manually executed by the victim, the fake setup process initializes the\nNetSupportManager RAT (remote access tool) and the legitimate Chrome setup\nas a decoy (Figure 1).\n\nNetSupportManager is commonly used to remotely control systems for\nmalicious purposes.\nA shortcut is also added to the user’s startup directory for persistence.\n\n_Figure 1 Endpoint view of NetSupportManager execution and decoy payload._\n\nUsing the NetSupportManager RAT session, the threat actor copied obfuscated\nscripts with a .wmd extension that are responsible for creating a renamed AutoIT\nbinary and an loading an obfuscated version of Mars Stealer from\n%TEMP%/IXP<3-digit number> .TMP.\nOne of the obfuscated scripts contains an embedded payload encrypted with\nRC4 using the hardcoded key ‘344868553478223918282826525’ (Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2 Snippets from AutoIT script showing embedded payload and decryption_\n_routine._\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce loaded, Mars Stealer performs several HTTP requests to retrieve\nconfiguration and DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files required for Mars Stealer to\noperate successfully and upload stolen data (Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3 Mars Stealer network communications._\n\nLastly, Base64 decoded part of the configuration retrieved from\n/7AgkTb5xcS.php:\n\n1|1|1|1|0|5qDlPuVKoR|Telegram|0|%APPDATA%\\Telegram\n\nDesktop\\tdata\\|*D877F783D5D3EF8C*,*map*,*configs*|1|0|0|rdp|3|%DESKTOP%\\\n|*.rdp|0|1|0|cer|3|%DESKTOP%\\|*.cer|0|1|0\n\n## Background on Mars Stealer\n\nIn June 2021, Mars Stealer was advertised on XSS, the Russian-language criminal\nforum, by MarsTeam for $140/month or $800 for a lifetime subscription.\nMars Stealer’s capabilities include:\n\nCryptocurrency theft (“Our software was developed taking into account the\n_wishes of people working in crypto, so at Mars you can find everything you need_\n_to work with crypto and more.” – MarsTeam post on XSS forum)._\n\nThe stealer supports dozens of popular browser plugins for popular\ncryptocurrency platforms, such as Coinbase.\nAdditionally, in December 2021, MarsTeam announced the release of “Mars\nClipboardChanger”, which substitutes crypto wallet addresses in the victim’s\nclipboard cache to hijack payments.\nData theft from major web browsers, including two-factor authentication (2FA)\nChrome-based browser extensions (“Collects passwords, cookies, cc,\n_autocomplete, browsing history, file download history.” - MarsTeam post on XSS_\n_forum)._\nProfiling or fingerprinting the infected system.\nExfiltrating files from the infected system.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Mars Stealer admin panel_\n\n## How did we find it?\n\n[MDR for Endpoint identified the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated](https://www.esentire.com/how-we-do-it/signals/endpoint)\nwith NetSupportManager RAT and AutoIT malware deployment.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nOur team of [24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts alerted the customer of the activity.](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/security-operations-center)\n\n## What can you learn from this TRU positive?\n\nDrive-by attacks involving malware masquerading as legitimate software are becoming\nincreasingly common since they require no exploits and rely on a victim running code\non the attacker’s behalf.\nMars Stealer has seen continued development since its release, and targets a wide\narray of credentials, particularly those used for cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIdentifying information stealing malware as early as possible is critical to minimize\nlosses from fraud and hijacked accounts.\n\n## Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:\n\nWhile rapid identification and containment of successful exploits is necessary to limit impact,\nunsuccessful attempts still present an opportunity to shore up defenses. The best approach\nto preventing drive-by attacks is by using a layered defense, such as:\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.\nUse a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product to\ndetect and contain threats.\nAudit your environment and endpoints regularly to ensure endpoints are patched with\nthe latest vendor security updates.\nIncrease awareness of social engineering threat tactics with your users through\n[phishing and security awareness training.](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/managed-vulnerability-and-risk/technical-testing/security-awareness-training-managed-phishing-training)\n\nEnsure users are aware of risks associated with downloading applications from\nthe web.\nAlways ensure software is downloaded from a legitimate source.\n## Ask Yourself\n\nDo you have the capability to rapidly identify and contain malicious code\nexecuted unwittingly by users in your environment?\nAre you monitoring your endpoints 24/7 and what degree of control do you have\nto initiate a kill switch when required?\nWhat level of managed endpoint support do you have in place?\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n|Indicators of Compromise|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Value|Note|\n|googleglstatupdt[.]com|Hosting fake Chrome setup ISO|\n|zrianevakn1[.]com|NetSupportManager RAT C2|\n|115d1ae8b95551108b3a902e48b3f163|‘ChromeSetup.iso’|\n|b15e0db8f65d7df27c07afe2981ff5a755666dce|ChromeSetup.exe|\n|37c24b4b6ada4250bc7c60951c5977c0|NetSupportManager RAT|\n|5[.]45.84.214|Mars Stealer C2|\n|71672a495b4603ecfec40a65254cb3ba8766bbe0|Esitanza.exe.pif (renamed AutoIt)|\n|e3c91b6246b2b9b82cebf3700c0a7093bacaa09b|ANpRAHx.exe (disguised as 3uAirPlayer, drops Mars Stealer and obfuscated AutoIt scripts)|\n|5c4e3e5fda232c31b3d2a2842c5ea23523b1de1a|Installer_ovl.exe|\n|2a2b00d0555647a6d5128b7ec87daf03a0ad568f|consoleappmrss.exe|\n|3c80b89e7d4fb08aa455ddf902a3ea236d3b582a|Fervore.wmd (obfuscated AutoIt script)|\n\n\n-----\n\n26136c59afe28fc6bf1b3aeba8946ac2c3ce61df Vai.wmd (obfuscated AutoIt\nscript)\n\ne6f18804c94f2bca5a0f6154b1c56186d4642e6b Una.wmd (obfuscated AutoIt\nscript)\n\neSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) is a world-class team of threat researchers who\ndevelop new detections enriched by original threat intelligence and leverage new\nmachine learning models that correlate multi-signal data and automate rapid response\nto advanced threats.\n\nIf you are not currently engaged with an MDR provider, eSentire MDR can help you\nreclaim the advantage and put your business ahead of disruption.\nLearn what it means to have an elite team of Threat Hunters and Researchers that\nworks for you.
