    "plain_text": "# Mandiant Azure AD Investigator\n\n**github.com/fireeye/Mandiant-Azure-AD-Investigator**\n\nmandiant\n\n### Focusing on UNC2452 TTPs\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository contains a PowerShell module for detecting artifacts that may\nbe indicators of UNC2452 and other threat actor activity. Some indicators are\n\"high-fidelity\" indicators of compromise, while other artifacts are so called \"dualuse\" artifacts. Dual-use artifacts may be related to threat actor activity, but also\nmay be related to legitimate functionality. Analysis and verification will be\nrequired for these. For a detailed description of the techniques used by\nUNC2452 see our blog.\n\nThis tool is read-only. It does not make any changes to the Microsoft 365\nenvironment.\n\nIn summary this module will:\n\nDo a best effort job at identifying indicators of compromise that will\nrequire further verification and analysis\n\nIt will not:\n\n\n-----\n\nIdentify a compromise 100% of the time, or\nTell you if an artifact is legitimate admin activity or threat actor activity.\n\nWith community feedback, the tool may become more thorough in its detection\nof IOCs. Please open an [issue,](https://github.com/mandiant/Mandiant-Azure-AD-Investigator/issues) [submit a PR, or contact the authors if you have](https://github.com/mandiant/Mandiant-Azure-AD-Investigator/pulls)\nproblems, ideas, or feedback.\n\n## Features\n\n### Federated Domains (Invoke-MandiantAuditAzureADDomains)\n\nThis module uses MS Online PowerShell to look for and audit federated\ndomains in Azure AD. All federated domains will be output to the file\n```\nfederated domains.csv .\n\n```\n**Signing Certificate Unusual Validity Period - Alerts on a federated**\ndomain where the signing certificates have a validity period of > 1 year.\nAD FS managed certificates are valid for only one year. Validity periods\nthat are longer than one year could be an indication that a threat actor\nhas tampered with the domain federation settings. They may also be\nindicative of the use of a legitimate custom token-signing certificate. Have\nyour administrators verify if this is the case.\n**Signing Certificate Mismatch - Alerts on federated domains where the**\nissuer or subject of the signing certificates do not match. In most cases\nthe token-signing certificates will always be from the same issuer and\nhave the same subject. If there is a mismatch, then it could be an\nindication that a threat actor has tampered with the domain federation\nsettings. Have your administrators verify if the subject and issuer names\nare expected, and if not consider performing a forensic investigation to\ndetermine how the changes were made and to identify any other\nevidence of compromise.\n**Azure AD Backdoor (any.sts) - Alerts on federated domains configured**\nwith `any.sts as the Issuer URI. This is indicative of usage of the Azure`\nAD Backdoor tool. Consider performing a forensic investigation to\ndetermine how the changes were made and to identify any other\nevidence of compromise.\n**Federated Domains - Lists all federated domains and the token issuer**\nURI. Verify that the domain should be federated and that the issuer URI is\nexpected.\n**Unverified Domains - Lists all unverified domains in Azure AD.**\nUnverified domains should not be kept in Azure AD for long in an\nunverified state. Consider removing them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Examples**\n```\n!! Evidence of AAD backdoor found.\nConsider performing a detailed forensic investigation\nDomain name: foobar.com\nDomain federation name:\nFederation issuer URI: http://any.sts/16B45E3B\n\n```\n‼ The script has identified a domain that has been federated with an issuer URI\n[that is an indicator of an Azure AD Backdoor. The backdoor sets the issuer URI](https://github.com/Gerenios/AADInternals/blob/master/FederatedIdentityTools.ps1)\nto hxxp://any.sts by default. Consider performing a forensic investigation to\ndetermine how the changes were made and identify any other evidence of\ncompromise.\n```\n!! A token signing certificate has a validity period of more than 365\ndays. \nThis may be evidence of a signing certificate not generated by AD FS.\nDomain name: foobar.com\nFederation issuer uri: http://sts.foobar.com\nSigning cert not valid before: 1/1/2020 00:00:00\nSigning cert not valid after: 12/31/2025 23:59:59\n\n```\n⚠ The script has identified a federated domain with a token-signing certificate\nthat is valid for longer than the standard 365 days. Consult with your\nadministrators to see if the token-signing certificate is manually managed and if\nit is expected to have the stated validity period. Consider performing a forensic\ninvestigation if this is not expected.\n\n### Service Principals (Invoke- MandiantAuditAzureADServicePrincipals)\n\nThis module uses Azure AD PowerShell to look for and audit Service Principals\nin Azure AD.\n\n**First-party Service Principals with added credentials - First-party**\n(Microsoft published) Service Principals should not have added\ncredentials except in rare circumstances. Environments that are or were\npreviously in a hybrid-mode may have credentials added to Exchange\nOnline, Skype for Business, and AAD Password Protection Proxy Service\nPrincipals. Verify that the Service Principal credential is part of a\nlegitimate use case. Consider performing a forensic investigation if the\ncredential is not legitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Service Principals with high level privileges and added credentials -**\nIdentifies Service Principals that have high-risk API permissions assigned\nand added credentials. While the Service Principal and added\npermissions are likely legitimate, the added credentials may not be. Verify\nthat the Service Principal credentials are part of a legitimate use case.\nVerify that the Service Principal needs the listed permissions.\n\n**Examples**\n```\n!! Identified first-party (Microsoft published) Service Principals with\nadded credentials.\nOnly in rare cases should a first-party Service Principal have an added\ncredential.\nVerify that the added credential has a legitimate use case and consider\nfurther investigation if not\n*******************************************************************\nObject ID      : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nApp ID       : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nDisplay Name    : Office 365 Exchange Online\nKey Credentials   :\nCustomKeyIdentifier :\nEndDate       : 12/9/2017 2:10:29 AM\nKeyId        : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nStartDate      : 12/9/2015 1:40:30 AM\nType        : AsymmetricX509Cert\nUsage        : Verify\nValue        :\n\n```\n⚠ The script has identified a first-party (Microsoft) Service Principal with\nadded credentials. First-party Service Principals should not have added\ncredentials except in rare cases. Environments that are or were previously in a\nhybrid-mode may have credentials added to Exchange Online, Skype for\nBusiness, and AAD Password Protection Proxy Service Principals. This may\nalso be an artifact of UNC2452 activity in your environment. Consult with your\nadministrators and search the audit logs to verify the credential is legitimate.\nYou can also use the \"Service Principal Sign-Ins\" tab in the Azure AD Sign-Ins\nblade to search for authentications to your tenant using this Service Principal.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n!! Identified Service Principals with high risk API permissions and added\ncredentials.\nVerify that the added credential has a legitimate use case and consider\nfurther investigation if not\nObject ID      : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nApp ID        : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nDisplay Name     : TestingApp\nKey Credentials   :\n  CustomKeyIdentifier :\n  EndDate       : 1/7/2025 12:00:00 AM\n  KeyId        : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\n  StartDate      : 1/7/2021 12:00:00 AM\n  Type        : Symmetric\n  Usage        : Verify\n  Value        :\nPassword Credentials :\nRisky Permissions  : Domain.ReadWrite.All\n\n```\n⚠ The script has identified a Service Principal with high-risk API permissions\nand added credentials. This may be expected, as some third-party or custombuilt applications require added credentials in order to function. This may also\nbe an artifact of UNC2452 activity in your environment. Consult with your\nadministrators and search the audit logs to verify the credential is legitimate.\nYou can also use the \"Service Principal Sign-Ins\" tab in the Azure AD Sign-Ins\nblade to search for authentications to your tenant using this Service Principal.\n\n### Applications (Invoke-MandiantAuditAzureADApplications)\n\nThis module uses Azure AD PowerShell to look for and audit Applications in\nAzure AD.\n\n**Applications with high level privileges and added credentials - Alerts**\non Applications that have high-risk API permissions and added\ncredentials. While the Applications and added permissions are likely\nlegitimate, the added credentials may not be. Verify that the Application\ncredentials are part of a legitimate use case. Verify that the Applications\nneeds the listed permissions.\n\n**Example**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n!! High privileged Application with credentials found.\nValidate that the application needs these permissions.\nValidate that the credentials added to the application are associated\nwith a legitimate use case.\nObjectID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nAppID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nDisplayName: Acme Test App\nKeyCredentials:\nPasswordCredentials:\nCustomKeyIdentifier :\nEndDate       : 12/22/2021 4:01:52 PM\nKeyId        : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nStartDate      : 12/22/2020 4:01:52 PM\nValue        :\nCustomKeyIdentifier :\nEndDate       : 12/21/2021 6:32:54 PM\nKeyId        : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\nStartDate      : 12/21/2020 6:33:16 PM\nValue        :\nRisky Permissions: \nMail.Read (Read mail in all mailboxes)\nDirectory.Read.All (Read all data in the organization directory)\n\n```\n⚠ The script has identified an Application with high-risk API permissions and\nadded credentials. This may be expected, as some third-party or custom-built\napplications require added credentials in order to function. This may also be an\nartifact of UNC2452 activity in your environment. Consult with your\nadministrators and search the audit logs to verify the credential is legitimate.\n\n### Cloud Solution Provider Program (Invoke- MandiantGetCSPInformation)\n\nThis module checks to see if the tenant is managed by a CSP, or partner, and if\ndelegated administration is enabled. Delegated administration allows the CSP\nto access a customer tenant with the same privileges as a Global\nAdministrator. Although the CSP program enforces strong security controls on\nthe partner's tenant, a threat actor that compromises the CSP may be able to\naccess customer environments. Organizations should verify if their partner\nneeds delegated admin privileges and remove it if not. If the partner must\nmaintain delegated admin access, consider implementing Conditional Access\nPolicies to restrict their access.\n\nOrganizations can check and manage partner relationships by navigating to the\n[Admin Center and navigating to](https://admin.microsoft.com/) `Settings ->` `Partner Relationships on`\nthe left-hand menu bar.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mailbox Folder Permissions (Get- MandiantMailboxFolderPermissions)\n\nThis module audits all the mailboxes in the tenant for the existance of\nsuspicious folder permissions. Specifically, this module will examine the \"Top of\nInformation Store\" and \"Inbox\" folders in each mailbox and check the\npermissions assigned to the \"Default\" and \"Anonymous\" users. Any value other\nthan \"None\" will result in the mailbox being flagged for analysis. In general the\nDefault and Anonymous users should not have permissions on user inboxes as\nthis will allow any user to read their contents. Some organizations may find\nshared mailboxes with this permission, but it is not recommended practice.\n\n### Application Impersonation (Get- MandiantApplicationImpersonationHolders)\n\nThis module outputs the list of users and groups that hold the\nApplicationImpersonation role. Any user or member of a group in the output of\nthis command can use impersonation to \"act as\" and access the mailbox of any\nother user in the tenant. Organizations should audit the output of this command\nto ensure that only expected users and groups are included, and where\npossible further restrict the scope.\n\n### Unified Audit Log (Get-MandiantUnc2452AuditLogs)\n\nThis module is a helper script to search the Unified Audit Log. Searching the\nUnified Audit Log has many technical caveats that can be easy to overlook.\nThis module can help simplify the search process by implementing best\npractices for navigating these caveats and handling some common errors.\n\nBy default, the module will search for log entries that can record UNC2452\ntechniques. The log records may also capture legitimate administrator activity,\nand will need to be verified.\n\n**Update Application - Records actions taken to update App**\nRegistrations.\n**Set Domain Auth - Records when authentication settings for a domain**\nare changed, including the creation of federation realm objects. These\nevents should occur rarely in an environment and may indicate a threat\nactor configuring an AAD backdoor.\n**Set Federation Settings - Records when the federation realm object for**\na domain is modified. These events should occur rarely in an\nenvironment and may indicate a threat actor preparing to execute a\nGolden SAML attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Update Application Certificates and Secrets - Records when a secret**\nor certificate is added to an App Registration.\n**PowerShell Mailbox Logins - Records Mailbox Login operations where**\nthe client application was PowerShell.\n**Update Service Principal - Records when updates are made to an**\nexisting Service Principal.\n**Add Service Principal Credentials - Records when a secret or**\ncertificate is added to a Service Principal.\n**Add App Role Assignment - Records when an App Role (Application**\nPermission) is added.\n**App Role Assignment for User - Records when an App Role is**\nassigned to a user.\n**PowerShell Authentication - Records when a user authenticates to**\nAzure AD using a PowerShell client.\n**New Management Role Assignments - Records when new**\nmanagement role assignments are created. This can be useful to identify\nnew ApplicationImpersonation grants.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Required Modules\n\nThe PowerShell module requires the installation of three Microsoft 365\nPowerShell modules.\n\nAzureAD\nMSOnline\nExchangeOnlineManagement\n\nTo install the modules:\n\n1.
