When users\nattempt to download software from one of these sites, they are redirected multiple times, and\nend up on a page containing the download instructions and archived password-protected\nmalware masquerading as the desired piece of software. When a user extracts and executes\nNullMixer, it drops a number of malware files to the compromised machine. These malware\nfamilies may include backdoors, bankers, credential stealers and so on. For example, the\nfollowing families are among those dropped by NullMixer: SmokeLoader/Smoke,\n_LgoogLoader, Disbuk, RedLine, Fabookie, ColdStealer._\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Initial infection\n\nThe infection vector of NullMixer is based on a ‘User Execution’ (MITRE Technique: T1204)\nmalicious link that requires the end user to click on and download a password-protected\nZIP/RAR archive with a malicious file that is extracted and executed manually.\n\nThe whole infection chain of NullMixer is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe user visits a website to download cracked software, keygens or activators. The\ncampaign appears to target anyone looking to download cracked software, and uses\nSEO techniques to make these malicious sites more prominent at the top of search\nengine results.\n\n**_Top Google search engine results for “crack software” contain malicious_**\n**_websites delivering NullMixer_**\n\nThe user clicks on the download link for the desired software.\nThe link redirects the user to another malicious website.\nThe malicious website redirects the user to a third-party IP address webpage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe webpage instructs the user to download a password-protected ZIP file from a file\nsharing website.\n\n**_Malware execution instructions_**\n\nThe user extracts the archived file with the password.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe user runs the installer and executes the malware.\n\n**_Example of NullMixer infection chain execution_**\n\n### NullMixer description\n\nNullMixer is a dropper that includes more than just specific malware families; it drops a wide\nvariety of malicious binaries to infect the machine with, such as backdoors, bankers,\ndownloaders, spyware and many others.\n\n### NullMixer execution chain\n\nThe real infection occurs when the user extracts the ‘win-setup-i864.exe’ file from the\ndownloaded password-protected archive and runs it. The ‘win-setup-i864.exe’ file is an NSIS\n(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) installation program, which is a very popular installation\ninstrument used by many software developers. In our case, it dropped and launched another\nfile, ‘setup_installer.exe’, that is in fact an SFX archive ‘7z Setup SFX’ wrapped into a\nWindows executable. The ‘setup_installer.exe’ file dropped dozens of malicious files. But\ninstead of launching them it launches a single executable – setup install exe – which is a\n\n\n-----\n\nNullMixer starter component. NullMixer s starter launches all the dropped executable files. To\ndo so, it contains a list of hardcoded file names, and launches them one by one using\n‘cmd.exe’.\n\n**_List of files hardcoded into NullMixer starter component_**\n\n**_NullMixer execution chain_**\n\nIt also tries to change Windows Defender settings using the following command line.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n\"cmd.exe /c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive Command Set\nMpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend\n-MAPSReporting Disable\"\n\n\nImmediately after all the dropped files have been launched, the NullMixer starter beacons to\nthe C&C about a successful installation. From this point, all the dropped and launched\nmalicious files are left to their own devices. With a little monitoring we can identify a wide\nvariety of malicious binaries that are spread by the NullMixer malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_NullMixer and malware families it drops_**\n\nSince the number of families turned out to be quite large, we decided to give only a brief\ndescription of each in this report. A full technical description will be provided in subsequent\nreports.\n\n### SmokeLoader\n\n\n-----\n\nSmokeLoader (aka Smoke) is a modular malware that has been known since 2011,\ndistributed via phishing emails and drive-by downloads. It has evolved its capabilities with\nadditional modules over the years. For example, disabling of Windows Defender and antianalysis techniques have been added to the malware. However, most threat actors only use\nthe main functionality – payload downloading and executing.\n\nIn contrast to the simplest downloaders that download malicious files using hardcoded static\nURLs, SmokeLoader communicates with the C&C in order to receive and perform download\ntasks.\n\n### RedLine Stealer\n\nRedLine Stealer has been known since early 2020 and developed through 2021. The\nmalware is known to be sold on online forums, and distributed via phishing emails.\n\nA newer method of spreading RedLine Stealer is by luring Windows 10 users to get fake\nWindows 11 upgrades. When the user downloads and executes the binary, they’re actually\nrunning the malware.\n\nRedLine’s main purpose is to steal credentials and information from browsers, in addition to\nstealing credit card details and cryptocurrency wallets from the compromised machine.\nMoreover, the malware also collects information about the system, such as: username,\nhardware details and installed security applications.\n\n### PseudoManuscrypt\n\n[PseudoManuscrypt has been known since June 2021, and used as MaaS (Malware as a](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2021/12/16/pseudomanuscrypt-a-mass-scale-spyware-attack-campaign/#kvbwoercdlcjawq6)\nService). PseudoManuscrypt doesn’t target particular companies or industries, but it has\nbeen observed that industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the\nmilitary-industrial complex and research laboratories, are the most significant victims.\n\nThe malware is known to be distributed via other botnets such as Glupteba. The main aim of\nthe PseudoManuscrypt threat actors is to spy on their victims by stealing cookies from\nFirefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Yandex Browser, keylogging and\nstealing cryptocurrency by utilizing the ClipBanker plugin. A distinctive feature of the malware\nis the use of the KCP protocol to download additional plugins.\n\n### ColdStealer\n\nColdStealer is a relatively new malicious program that was discovered in 2022. Like many\nother stealers its main purpose is to steal credentials and information from web browsers, in\naddition to stealing cryptocurrency wallets, FTP credentials, various files and information\n\n\n-----\n\nabout the system such as OS version, system language, processor type and clipboard data.\nThe only known method of delivering stolen information to cybercriminals is by sending a ZIP\narchive to an embedded control center.\n\n**_ColdStealer Main() function_**\n\n### FormatLoader\n\nFormatLoader is a downloader that got its name for using hardcoded URLs as format strings,\nwhere it needs to fill a single digit to get a link to download an additional binary. The available\ndigit range is also hardcoded.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\nhttps://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw%d.exe =>\nhttps://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw3.exe\n\nhttps://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw%d.exe =>\nhttps://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw4.exe\n\n…\n\nhttps://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw%d.exe =>\nhttps://signaturebusinesspark[.]com/360/fw6.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nFormatLoader s main purpose is to infect the machine with an additional malicious file by\ndownloading the binary to the compromised machine. To do so, the malware adds digits from\nthe hardcoded range one by one to the hardcoded format strings, and accesses the\ndownload links.\n\nIn addition, FormatLoader uses a third-party website service for tracking the compromised\nmachine. It sends a ‘GET’ request to a specific URL of an IP logger service, which collects\ninformation such as IP address and IP-based geolocation.\n\n### CsdiMonetize\n\nCsdiMonetize is known to be an advertising platform that used to install many different PUAs\n(Potentially Unwanted Applications) on a Pay-Per-Install basis after infecting the user’s\nmachine. Later on, rather than just infecting their victim with PUAs, CsdiMoneitze began\ninfecting their victims with actual Trojans, like the Glupteba malware.\n\nNowadays, CsdiMonetize infects its victims with additional malware family types such as:\nFabookie, Disbuk, PseudoManuscrypt and more.\n\n**_Csdi execution chain_**\n\nThe infection begins with NSIS installer ’61f665303c295_Sun1059d492746c.exe’, which\ndownloads the Csdi installer ‘MSEkni.exe‘. The Csdi installer requests the current\nconfiguration from the C&C and a list of additional Csdi components to install. Configuration\nis stored in several registry keys in encrypted and base64 encoded form. The next step is to\ndownload additional components, the most notable being publisher and updater\ncomponents. The Csdi publisher component is responsible for showing advertisements by\nlaunching the browser with URLs as command line parameters. The updater component is\nresponsible for a Pay-Per-Install service. It receives the list of URLs from the C&C and\ninstructions on how to drop and execute downloaded files.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Disbuk\n\nDisbuk (aka Socelar) is known to disguise itself as a legitimate application, such as PDF\neditor software.\n\nThis malware was found to mainly target Facebook Ads and evolved to steal Facebook\nsession cookies from Chrome and Firefox by accessing the browser’s SQLite database. After\nretrieving this information, the malware attempts to extract additional information like access\ntokens, account IDs, etc. After further evolution, Disbuk has also started retrieving Amazon\ncookies.\n\nBesides stealing data, Disbuk also installs a malicious browser extension that masquerades\nas a Google Translate extension. To get more information about a user’s Facebook account,\nDisbuk queries Facebook Graph API.\n\n### Fabookie\n\nFabookie is another stealer that targets Facebook Ads. Its functionality is similar to the\nDisbuk malware, and includes stealing Facebook session cookies from browsers, using\nFacebook Graph API Queries to receive additional information about a user’s account, linked\npayment method, balance, friends, etc. Stolen credentials can later be used to run ads from\nthe compromised account.\n\nUnlike Disbuk, this malware does not contain built-in malicious browser extensions, but\ncontains two embedded NirSoft utilities – ‘Chrome Cookies View’ and ‘Web Browser\nPassword Viewer’ – that are used to extract data from browsers.\n\n### DanaBot\n\nDanaBot is a Trojan-Banker written in Delphi that spreads via email phishing, and is known\nto have evolved since it was discovered in 2018.\n\nDanaBot is a modular malware that includes various additional modules; the most popular\nfunctionalities of these modules are stealing information from compromised machines and\ninjecting fake forms into popular ecommerce and social media sites to collect payment data.\nIt can also provide full access to infected systems with remote desktop, or mouse and\nkeyboard access by utilizing a VNC plugin.\n\n### Racealer\n\nRacealer (aka RaccoonStealer) is known to be a stealer-type malware that mostly extracts\nuser credentials and exfiltrates data from compromised machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nRacoon is also known to have evolved over the years since it was discovered in 2019. For\nexample, it now uses Telegram to retrieve C&C IP addresses and malware configurations.\nMoreover, additional modules are now being downloaded from the malware’s C&Cs that are\nalso used to extract credentials.\n\n### Generic.ClipBanker\n\nGeneric.ClipBanker is a clipboard hijacker malware that monitors the clipboard of the\ncompromised machine, and specifically searches for cryptocurrency addresses in order to\nreplace them. When a user copies an address of a cryptocurrency wallet the malware\nreplaces the address of the wallet with their own cryptocurrency wallet address, so the end\nuser sends cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) to them rather than to the intended wallet\naddress.\n\n**_Screen with cryptocurrency addresses from Generic.ClipBanker binary_**\n\n\n-----\n\n### SgnitLoader\n\nThe SgnitLoader is a small Trojan-Downloader written in C#. The downloader binary size is\nabout 15 Kbytes. However, the original file is packed with Obsidium, which makes the binary\nsize grow to more than 400 Kbytes.\n\nThe SgnitLoader contains a few hardcoded domains in its binary, to which it appends the\npath and adds a number from 1 to 7. Unlike the FormatLoader malware, it doesn’t use a\nformat string, but simply adds a number to the end of the string in order to get the full URL.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n\"https://presstheme[.]me/\" + \"?user=\" + \"l10_\" + \"1\"  =>  \"https://presstheme.me/?\nuser=l10_1\"\n\n\"https://presstheme[.]me/\" + \"?user=\" + \"l10_\" + \"2\"  =>  \"https://presstheme.me/?\nuser=l10_2\"\n\n…\n\n\"https://presstheme[.]me/\" + \"?user=\" + \"l10_\" + \"7\"  =>  \"https://presstheme.me/?\nuser=l10_7\"\n\n\nAfter the download and execute procedures are completed, SgnitLoader pings back to the\nC&C with a ‘GET’ request. The original pingback URL is hidden with the ‘iplogger.org’ URL\nshortener service.\n\n### ShortLoader\n\nAnother small Trojan-Downloader written in C#. Its binary is half the size of SgnitLoader. Its\nmain function code is fairly short and it uses the ‘IP Logger‘ URL shortener service to hide\nthe original URL that it downloads the payload from. That’s why it’s called ShortLoader.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ShortLoader Main() function_**\n\n### Downloader.INNO\n\nThe original file is an ‘Inno Setup’ installer that utilizes ‘Inno Download Plugin’ download\nfunctionality.\n\nThe setup script is programmed to download a file from the URL\n‘http://onlinehueplet[.]com/77_1.exe‘ placing it into the ‘%TEMP%‘ directory as\n‘dllhostwin.exe‘ and executing it with the string ’77’ as an argument.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Part of Inno Setup installation script_**\n\nThe downloaded file belongs to the Satacom Trojan-Downloader family. However, in the\ncourse of our research we discovered that this file was replaced on the server with legitimate\nPuTTY software, a popular SSH client.\n\n### LgoogLoader\n\nThis file is another software installer that uses the Microsoft Cabinet archive-file format. After\nexecution, it drops three files: a batch file, an AutoIt interpreter with a stripped executable\nheader and an AutoIt script. Then it executes the batch file with ‘cmd.exe’. The task of the\nbatch file is to restore the AutoIt interpreter executable, and launch it with a path to the AutoIt\nscript as a command line argument.\n\nAutoIt script performs a few AntiVM and AntiDebug checks. If all the checks are successful,\nthen it starts AutoIt interpreter once again, decrypts and decompresses the embedded\nexecutable and injects it into the newly created process. The injected executable is\nLgoogLoader.\n\nLgoogLoader is a Trojan-Downloader that downloads an encrypted configuration file from a\nhardcoded static URL. It then decrypts the configuration, extracts additional URLs from it and\ndownloads and executes the final payloads. It was called LgoogLoader due to its use of\nstrings from ‘Google Privacy Policy’.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Google Privacy Policy strings in LgoogLoader’s binary_**\n\n### Downloader.Bitser\n\nThe original file is an NSIS installer that tries to install PUA: Lightening Media Player. The file\nis downloaded by CsdiMonetize’s updater component (MD5:\n[98f0556a846f223352da516af66fa1a0). However, the installation script is configured not only](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/98f0556a846f223352da516af66fa1a0/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\nto set up Lightening Media Player, but also to run the built-in Windows utility ‘bitsadmin’ to\ndownload additional files, which is why we call it Bitser. In our case, the utility was used\ninside the installation script of the NSIS installer, and used to download a 7z passwordprotected archive. The password for the 7z archive and instructions for unpacking and\nexecution are also hardcoded into the installation script.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Downloader.Bitser’s infection chain_**\n\nA legitimate 7-Zip Standalone Console application is dropped by the installer under the name\n‘data_load.exe‘ and launched with arguments to unpack files from the downloaded archive.\n\n**_Part of NSIS script with download and execute instructions_**\n\n### C-Joker\n\nC-Joker is an incredibly simple Exodus wallet stealer. It uses the Telegram API to send\nnotifications about successful or failed installations. In order to steal credentials, it downloads\na backdoored version of the ‘app.asar’ file and replaces the original file from the Exodus\nwallet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_String in C-Joker’s binary_**\n\n### PrivateLoader\n\nPrivateLoader is yet another example of a Pay-Per-Install malicious loader like LgoogLoader\nand SmokeLoader. It uses a single-byte XOR encryption key to receive URLs from the\ncontrol center.\n\n### Satacom\n\nSatacom is also known as LegionLoader. Discovered in 2019, Satacom uses different antianalysis tricks that were probably borrowed from the al-khazer stress tool. The embedded\nuser agent varies from sample to sample, but in our case the user agent is “deus vult”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Strings in Satacom binary_**\n\nThe latest version receives the main control center address from TXT-record. Satacom\nsends a DNS TXT-query to ‘reosio.com‘ and receives a response with a base64 encoded\nstring.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Satacom DNS request and response_**\n\nAfter decoding and decrypting with the XOR key “DARKMATTER” it gets the real C&C URL\n‘banhamm.com‘.\n\n**_Satacom C&C communication_**\n\n### GCleaner\n\nGCleaner is another Pay-Per-Install malicious loader. It was discovered at the beginning of\n2019. Initially it was distributed as a cleaning tool called Garbage Cleaner or G-Cleaner\nthrough a fake website mimicking popular cleaning tools like CCleaner. The main loader was\nused to download potentially unwanted applications together with malware such as Azorult,\nVidar, PredatorTheThief, miners and so on. GCleaner is now distributed by various crack\nwebsites along with other malware. This PPI platform uses C&C-based geolocation\ntargeting, meaning it can push different malware depending on the victim’s IP address.\nAlthough the GCleaner loader is no longer mimicking cleaning tools, there are some still\n\n\n-----\n\nremnants of this in its binary code such as encrypted strings like\n“Software\\GCleaner\\Started” or “\\Garbage.Cleaner”. The sample of GCleaner that we\ndetected when analyzing this campaign was trying to download the Vidar password stealer.\n\n### Vidar\n\nVidar is an info-stealer. It downloads DLL files freebl3.dll, mozglue.dll, msvcp140.dll, nss3.dll,\nsoftokn3.dll and vcruntime140.dll from its C&C for use in password-grabbing routines. Vidar\ncan also receive settings from the C&C that tells it exactly what to do. It is able to steal\nautofill information from web browsers, cookies, saved credit cards, browser history, coin\nwallets and Telegram databases. It also can make and send screenshots to the C&C, as well\nas any file that matches a specified mask.\n\n**_Vidar downloads DLL files and uploads collected data_**\n\n## Victims\n\nSince the beginning of the year we’ve blocked attempts to infect more than 47,778 victims\nworldwide. Some of the most targeted countries are Brazil, India, Russia, Italy, Germany,\nFrance, Egypt, Turkey and the United States.\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe are currently unable to directly attribute NullMixer to any group.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nTrying to save money by using unlicensed software can be costly. A single file downloaded\nfrom an unreliable source can lead to a large-scale infection of a computer system. As we\ncan see, a large proportion of the malware families dropped by NullMixer are classified as\nTrojan-Downloaders, which suggests infections will not be limited to the malware families\ndescribed in this report.
