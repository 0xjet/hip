During our monitoring operations we frequently face malware samples based on known\nfamilies and code-bases, mangled and then used to conduct even more sophisticated attacks.\n\nRecently, we intercepted a particularly representative attack campaign of this phenomenon. We found and analyzed a infection chain\nleveraging the WSH-RAT kit, a complete Remote Administration tool sold in the underground and frequently abused by criminal actors\nrelying on off-the-shelf kits to build their offensive campaigns.\n\nIn this report, we dissect the entire infection chain of the malware in order to investigate the threat capabilities of one of the latest WSHRAT versions, and how attackers weaponize it to survive the traditional perimetral defences.\n\nWSH-RAT Announce\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe initial stage of the infection chain is weaponized RTF malicious document document having the following static information:\n\n\n-----\n\nHash a4933a4607727ada5ae7ed0c79607911b7199876995e8e7dc835fe32437a6b06\n\nThreat RTF document weaponized with MS-17-11882\n\nBrief Description WSH RAT dropper\n\nSsdeep 384:HgTRA9Zw4Fg4+GUAhvasrLWRkpbaQL4IYbTiFxHGDb:ATRYw8kGNvaUfb4bTiHHGX\n\nTable 1. Sample information\n\nThe exploit used to prepare the document is the “classic” MS-17-11882. It reveals to be also in 2021 one of the most active threats for the\nusers.\n\nFigure 1: Evidence of the exploit MS17-11882\n\nThe shellcode of the equation editor downloads the second component of the infection chain from a previously compromised WordPress\nwebsite. This component is an executable file having the following static information:\n\nHash a2b55ffb492faeced1033c534e4f462d3c0ac9f914f991361ba67067538a05d1\n\nThreat WSH RAT\n\nBrief Description WSH RAT .NET packer\n\nSsdeep 24576:Yma+QZG0nbLYR1yTb6h0BacWadNihTIvGn7Rk3w6hWNudTzIfAH:jcZnbLYXyTb6oacjosOu8O0G\n\nTable 1. Sample information\n\nFigure 2: Signature Evidence\n\nThis sample is only a wrapper opportunely packed and with the only purpose to deploy the next stage, the entire Visual Basic Script of\nWSH-Rat. Anyway, before talking about that, let’s dig into the packer.\n\n## The .NET Packer\n\nThis packer is heavily obfuscated and we proceeded to the debug it:\n\nFigure 3: Resource “Formulario” routine\n\nThe highlight of the sample is when the packer loads a resource named “Formulario.Properties.Resources”, a sort of bitmap image which\nis decrypted using a custom algorithm.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Preview of the encrypted resource\n\nOnce loaded the byte array, a static method named “KeepAlive.Kuchi” is used to decrypt the byte array seen in the following figure inside\nthe variable “array”:\n\nFigure 5: Evidence of the loading of the encrypted\n\nresource and the subsequent decrypting routine\nThe decrypted array is another .NET PE file, immediately executed through the “<Assembly>.Invoke” routine:\n\nFigure 6: Decryption routine complete and invoking\n\nroutine\nAt this point, we started to debug this second binary file and, debugging it, we obtained a similar situation, arriving to obtain another MZ\nheader, as shown in the following screen.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Evidence of the decryption routine of the\n\nsecond PE file\nThis third MZ file is quite particular, because it contains a long base-64 encoded string. We extracted that payload using the basic\n“strings” tool and the base64-decode and we obtained the WSH-RAT payload.\n\nFigure 8: Piece of the base-64 encoded payload\n\n## The WSH-RAT Core\n\nThe core of the infection is the WSH-RAT payload, obtained from the previous stage. In this section we’ll deepen inside to the capability\nand also to the configuration of this malware.\n\nHash 13b1302f2e0c9fbfebba0ff3f133d2403a03eed5d66f60121dc26549180c4f50\n\nThreat WSH RAT\n\n\nBrief\nDescription\n\n\nWSH RAT VBS payload\n\n\nSsdeep 3072:VAg8xSdAmshISeWJQ0bamQvEz7ZAbURC3eGK/6xbIpklgVDSxGfmuZ1D:VAg8xSymshISeWmM6iRC3eGKoAklgF28\n\nTable 2. Sample information\n\nThe first interesting note appears on the header:\n\nFigure 9: Malware configuration and seller\n\nWe have the details of the actor who forked that malware and re-coded it for its purposes. After that, there is the malware configuration\nwith all the settings of the current RAT. After some variable declaration we’ll skip, we have the starting of the real malicious code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Initial code script\n\nThe rows of code reported in the above script are the first of the real malicious code of the WSH-RAT. The install subroutine performs the\noperations to guarantee the persistence of the sample through the copy of itself inside the\n“C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup” directory.\n\nHowever, it is more interesting to spend more words on the C2 mechanism. We have a sort of gathering of the C2 though the GetHost\nfunction seen in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 11: Retrieving of the C2\n\nThe malware retrieves the real C2 from a Pastebin’s page and during the analysis the real C2 was “hxxp://mercedez].duckdns.]org:7723”,\ndynamic DNS from a private IP. The master of the malicious page is able to change every moment the second C2, making all the\ninfrastructure very flexible.\n\nAfter that, the bot retrieves the commands to execute from the C2 and it saves the inside the variable “cmd” seen at the last row of Figure\n9. The command list is quite easy to understand, because, at this level of analysis we don’t have any level of obfuscation. Thus, we can\nsynthetize the commands in the following table.\n\n**_Command_** **_Description_**\n\ndisconnect Exit the Wscript.exe process of the RAT\n\nreboot Reboot the PC\n\nshutdown Shutdown the PC\n\nexecute Execute a command\n\ninstall-sdk Download from the C2 a file zip named “wshsdk.zip” and install it into the folder of the infection\n\nremove-sdk Remove the sdk files\n\nget-pass Execute the module PassGrabber useful to steal the credentials of the common web browsers and mail clients and\nthen upload on the C2\n\n\nget-passoffline\n\n\nThe same command of “get-pass” but the stolen credential will be stored on the machine\n\n\nupdate Update the WSH-RAT core\n\nuninstall Remove all the files of the infection\n\nup-n-exec Upload a file on the C2 and execute it\n\nbring-log Upload the “wshlogs” folder onto the C2\n\ndown-n-exec Download a file and Execute it\n\nfilemanager Install a Service for the filemanager\n\nrdp Install a Remote Desktop Protocol plugin\n\nhbrowser Install a minimal web browser plugin\n\nrev-proxy Install a Reverse Proxy on a port\n\nexit-proxy Disable The reverse PRoxy\n\n\n-----\n\nkeylogger Install the Keylogger module and the immediately update the captured keystrokes\n\n\nofflinekeylogger\n\n\nThe same of keylogger but the captured keystrokes are saved offline\n\n\nbrowse-logs Print the captured log and upload onto the C2\n\ncmd-shell Spawn a CMD shell\n\n\ngetprocesses\n\n\nPrint the running processes and upload on the C2\n\n\ndisable-uac Disable the UAC protection system\n\ncheck-eligible Check the presence of a specific file and notify to the C2\n\nrev-rdp Install a Reverse RDP plugin\n\nuvnc Install a UltraVNC plugin\n\nforce-eligible Check the privileges of a file and notify that to the C2\n\nelevate Elevate the privileges of the WSH-RAT\n\nif-elevate Check if the WSH-RAT has high privileges and notify the C2\n\nkill-process Kill a specific Process\n\nsleep Sleep for a certain time\n\nTable 3: Synthesis of the commands\n\nBesides that command we want to keep your attention to two technical details we found inside the malicious code. The first one is that\nsome plugins are embedded inside the script, like the following example:\n\nFigure 12: Example of decoding function\n\nThe “faceMask” function has to decode the plugin payload from the string. It is actually encoded in base64 format and compressed in\nGZip format. The called functions are the following:\n\nFigure 13: Decoding functions\n\nThe two functions reported in Figure 13 show the mechanism adopted to install and execute the plugin. The first function is “faceMask”\nwhich decodes the string through a Powershell script and stores the result into a temporary registry key named\n“HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\test”. After that, the “loopTill” function reads the content of the regkey, deletes it and, finally, returns the\nresult.\n\n## The Payload Launcher\n\nThe second interesting element is that the code launches every plugin through a pre-built RunPE hackTool written in .NET Framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Evidence of the “payloadLauncher”\n\nfunction\nEvery plugin is executed through the “payloadLauncher” function and, so, we decided to deepen that.\n\nFigure 15: Snippet of “payloadLauncher” function\n\nInside the function there is another string encoded in the same mode previously described and it actually is a component we saw in\nanother [older campaign we tracked, and it is aimed at perform the Process Hollowing technique to inject the malicious plugins inside](https://yoroi.company/research/the-evolution-of-aggah-from-roma225-to-the-rg-campaign/)\nother host processes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe so-called “commodity malwares” are the part of the underground cyber criminal that enables a wide range of attackers to leverage\nadvanced capabilities to conduct intrusion operations and frauds, lowering the entry bar of cyber-crime and hacking.\n\nDuring our threat intelligence monitoring operations and defence services we used to stay up to date with the evolution of this “known\nunknowns”. In fact, despite the fact the malware families are actually known, intrusion kits like WSH-RAT are continuously customized\nand wrapped by additional layers of multi-language code, most of the time unknown to the community. This is one of the reasons why\nhere in Yoroi, we leverage Threat Intelligence operations and Malware Analysis capabilities to enable our managed defence services to\noffer superior detection, protection and response capabilities, to prevent, mitigate and handle cyber risks.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nDropurl\n\nhttp]://192].210].218[.29/regasm/document.doc\nhttp://kinghome].logsik].net/wp-includes/dozz.exe\nC2:\n\nhxxp://mercedez].duckdns.]org:7723\nHash\n\na4933a4607727ada5ae7ed0c79607911b7199876995e8e7dc835fe32437a6b06\n9db1edd8eab084ef0e078e850ead4e743a0067c5ad9ded073edd3f533b3efd76\na2b55ffb492faeced1033c534e4f462d3c0ac9f914f991361ba67067538a05d1\n13b1302f2e0c9fbfebba0ff3f133d2403a03eed5d66f60121dc26549180c4f50\n400b411a9bffd687c5e74f51d43b7dc92cdb8d5ca9f674456b75a5d37587d342\n64c1d1108c04bff24f629f60a43419424001087f3f9f032cfaad422b1abd99ff\n272e64291748fa8be01109faa46c0ea919bf4baf4924177ea6ac2ee0574f1c1a\nd24396bab076f62921a8be8f54e5255a641b646ff47aa72292bcf40d04aec25e\nd65a3033e440575a7d32f4399176e0cdb1b7e4efa108452fcdde658e90722653\nbb2bb116cc414b05ebc9b637b22fa77e5d45e8f616c4dc396846283c875bd129\n0421fab0c9260a7fe3361361581d84c000ed3057b9587eb4a97b6f5dc284a7af\n\n## Yara Rules\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara Rule for WSH rat .NET packer of February 2021 \"\n   author = \"Yoroi Malware ZLab\"\n   last_updated = \"2021-03-09\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n   category = \"informational\"\n  strings:\n          $a1 = { BE DD 60 8C 34 49 9A 54 D2 40 }\n          $a2 = { 1D D7 24 22 47 A6 B1 A5 }\n          $a3 = { 13 30 03 00 07 00 00 00 01 } \n          $a4 = { 11 02 03 7D 78 00 00 04 2A }\n          $a5 = { A8 8A F4 C8 61 2B CA 07 }\n $a6 = { 15 AE 5E AB 5A 20 FE B5 56 B4 61 2B BB 06 2A}\n  condition:\n          uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and 3 of them\n}\n\n```\n_This blog post was authored by Luigi Martire and Luca Mella of Yoroi Malware ZLAB_\n\n\n-----",
