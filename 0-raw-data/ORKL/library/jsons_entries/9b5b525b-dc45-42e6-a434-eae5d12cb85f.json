Mandiant Threat Intelligence has observed FIN11 attempting to monetize their\noperations at least once using named point-of-sale (POS) malware and, more frequently,\nusing ransomware combined with traditional extortion techniques. In addition to their highvolume spam campaigns, FIN11 is also notable due their consistent evolvement of malware\ndelivery tactics and techniques. Join Genevieve Stark and Andy Moore from Mandiant Threat\nIntelligence for a look into the motivations, tactics and operations of this newly “graduated”\nthreat group, including the group’s previous activity, common TTPs, and anticipated future\nfocus.\n\n\n-----\n\n### More from this channel\n\nUpcoming talks (5)\nOn-demand talks (420)\nSubscribers (91607)\nMandiant provides public and private organizations and critical infrastructure worldwide with\nearly threat insights through unmatched intelligence and response expertise for the highestprofile incidents.\n\n\n-----",
