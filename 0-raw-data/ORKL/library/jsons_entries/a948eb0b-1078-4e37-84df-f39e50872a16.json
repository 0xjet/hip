He allegedly infected more than 1,000 computers and demanded\nthe equivalent of $1,200 for decrypting each one.\n\n“Access to the admin panel for managing the ransomware botnet was carried out via the\ndarknet, which allowed the attacker to remain anonymous for a long time,” the news release\nstates.\n\n“Part of the profits was transferred to the administrators (operators) of the server he leased,”\nZaitsev said.\n\nThe hacker”s victims span several countries, including India, the US, Ukraine, UK, Germany,\nFrance, Italy and Russia â€“ where most of his victims resided.\n\nLast week, Europol announced that the No More Ransom decryption tool repository had\namassed over 4.2 million visitors from 188 countries as the service turned four years old.\nThe agency said the repo helped save an estimated $632 million for ransomware victims\nworldwide. Bitdefender calculates that its GandCrab decryptors alone are responsible for\n12% of that figure.\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[industry news](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/industry-news/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Filip TRUȚĂ\n\n\n-----\n\nFilip has 15 years of experience in technology journalism.
