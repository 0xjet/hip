Notably,\nthis targeting has been geographically concentrated, with the\nidentified SLDCs located in North India, in proximity to the\ndisputed India-China border in Ladakh. One of these SLDCs\nwas also targeted in previous RedEcho activity. This latest\nset of intrusions, however, is composed of an almost entirely\ndifferent set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting\nof power grid assets, we also identified the compromise of a\nnational emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary\nof a multinational logistics company by the same threat activity\ngroup. To achieve this, the group likely compromised and co- 1 Typically, Insikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group or campaign,\nopted internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts have data corresponding to at least 3 points on\n\nthe Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium confidence.

Although tensions reduced,\n[aided by partial troop disengagement, in February 2021 following](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-china/india-china-complete-troop-pullout-from-lake-area-idUSKBN2AL0E6)\nprolonged border stand-offs in the Ladakh region, there has\nbeen limited progress between the states regarding respective\nterritorial claims.\n\n\nOur February 2021 RedEcho [report highlighted the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\ncompromise of 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations,\nincluding 4 of the 5 of the country’s Regional Load Despatch\nCentres (RLDC), 2 ports, a large generation operator, and other\noperational assets. These assets offer minimal value as economic\nespionage or other traditional intelligence targets, which led\nus to assess a likely goal of pre-positioning network access to\nsupport Chinese strategic objectives. Following that February\n2021 report, we observed the group abandon the operational\ninfrastructure highlighted and shift its infrastructure modus\noperandi. Despite this, evidence of targeting of Indian power\nassets and organizations with links to critical infrastructure\nfrom Chinese state-sponsored actors continued. This included\nthe targeting of an Indian managed service provider (MSP) and\noperational technology (OT) vendor using ShadowPad, which\naligns with activity described in recent Dragos [reporting. We](https://hub.dragos.com/hubfs/333%20Year%20in%20Review/2021/2021%20ICS%20OT%20Cybersecurity%20Year%20In%20Review%20-%20Dragos%202021.pdf?hsLang=en)\nattribute this particular activity to a separate activity group we\ntrack as Threat Activity Group 26 (TAG-26). We have observed\nTAG-26 targeting multiple high-value organizations in India using\nShadowPad, Poison Ivy, and the RoyalRoad RTF weaponizer.\n\nThe use of ShadowPad across Chinese activity groups\ncontinues to grow over time, with new clusters of activity\nregularly identified using the backdoor as well as continued\nadoption by previously tracked clusters. At this time, we track\nat least 10 distinct activity groups with access to ShadowPad,\n[which is assessed to have likely been originally](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf) [developed and](https://assets.sentinelone.com/c/Shadowpad?x=P42eqA)\nused by MSS-linked contractors linked to the APT41 (BARIUM)\nintrusion set.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Timeline of TAG-38 C2 infrastructure detection and network traffic analysis (NTA) exfiltration events (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nSince at least September 2021, we have observed TAG38 intrusions targeting the identified victim organizations. The\ngroup has employed probable compromised infrastructure for\ncommand and control of ShadowPad implants used to target the\n[identified networks, as well as using the open source tool Fast](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\n[Reverse Proxy (FRP). Figure 3 highlights ongoing TAG-38 C2](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\ndetection and network traffic analysis exfiltration events from\nvictim networks within the Recorded Future platform between\nSeptember 2021 and March 2022.\n\n##### Targeting of Indian Power Sector\n\nThe identified victimology within this latest campaign is\nconfined to Indian targets, specifically at least 7 SLDCs, the\nIndian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company, and\na national emergency response system. As shown in Figure\n4, the identified SLDCs were all located in Northern India, in\nproximity to the disputed China-India border in Ladakh. SLDCs\nare responsible for carrying out real-time operations for\ngrid control and electricity dispatch within these respective\nstates, similar to the Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDCs)\npreviously targeted in reported RedEcho [activity. This makes](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\nthese organizations critical for maintaining grid frequency and\nstability, with SLDCs maintaining access to supervisory control\nand data acquisition (SCADA) systems present across respective\nstates for the purpose of grid control and electricity dispatch. At\nthis time, we have not observed evidence of access to industrial\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Map of TAG-38 victim State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC) locations. Previously reported RedEcho victim locations also displayed in gray (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n##### TAG-38 Infrastructure Clustering\n\nUsing a combination of proactive infrastructure detection\ntechniques and network traffic analysis, we uncovered a cluster\nof C2 infrastructure engaged in this prolonged targeting of\nIndian critical infrastructure over several months. Based on our\nanalysis, the adversary infrastructure cluster identified consists\nentirely of likely compromised internet-facing, third-party DVR/\nIP camera devices. The compromise of often poorly secured\ninternet-of-things (IOT) devices such as IP cameras for use in\nfollow-on intrusion activity has previously been seen for threats\n[ranging from Mirai-based botnets (1,2) to the Chinese state-](https://duo.com/decipher/mirai-based-botnet-infects-vulnerable-surveillance-cameras)\n[sponsored threat activity](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-013.pdf) [group RedBravo (APT31/ZIRCONIUM).](https://www.sekoia.io/en/walking-on-apt31-infrastructure-footprints/)\nAt this time, we have not determined the means in which these\ndevices were originally compromised, which may include the use\nof default credentials. Using a series of analytical techniques\nand heuristics, we were able to cluster a network of these C2\nIPs together, all of which matched all or most of the following\ncriteria:\n\n  - Victim infrastructure observed communicating to all of\n\nthe identified C2 servers consisted solely of the same\noverlapping Indian power grid victims, logistics company,\nand Indian emergency response system.\n\n  - All C2 servers were likely compromised DVR/IP camera\n\ndevices and were primarily geolocated in Taiwan or\n\n\n\n- Likely compromised devices were observed with the\n\ndefault open ports 80/554/9090 associated with\nthe compromised device, as well as an additional\nactor-controlled port(s) opened for malware C2\ncommunications.\n\n- A large proportion were confirmed as ShadowPad\n\nC2 servers using Recorded Future C2 detection\nmethodologies, a technique previously used in historical\nInsikt Group reporting on RedEcho and other Chinese\n[state-sponsored activity groups (1,2,3).](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\n\n- A large proportion of the identified C2s had the open\n\n[source tool Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) server component](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\nconfigured on port 8443. FRP can read predefined\nconfigurations and allows you to expose local services\nthat are hidden behind the NAT or a firewall to the\ninternet. This tool has been abused by numerous state[sponsored groups, including the Iran-linked group](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/)\n[Phosphorus and several Chinese actors (1,2).](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/10BhbuMHkILY)\n\n- A large proportion of the identified C2s\n\nshared a unique SSL certificate spoofing\nMicrosoft on port 443 (SHA1 fingerprint:\n0f6afc6e4e383883a6308fcf8d84b14a5bf4ccaf). This\ncertificate has multiple links to wider Chinese statesponsored cyber espionage activity and is discussed in\nfurther detail below.\n\n\n-----\n\n|ShadowPad C2 IP Address|ASN|First Seen|\n|---|---|---|\n|14.43.108[.]22|AS4766|Aug 27, 2021|\n|210.123.140[.]200|AS45361|Sep 15, 2021|\n|112.171.218[.]39|AS4766|Jan 12, 2022|\n|114.35.191[.]224|AS3462|Jan 12, 2022|\n|59.10.140[.]47|AS4766|Jan 13, 2022|\n|121.151.212[.]101|AS4766|Oct 18, 2021|\n|119.200.211[.]197|AS4766|Feb 8, 2022|\n|124.216.159[.]70|AS4766|Feb 23, 2022|\n|211.184.160[.]108|AS4766|Feb 28, 2022|\n\n\n_Table 1: Sample list of ShadowPad C2 servers linked to TAG-38 targeting of Indian power sector and_\n_additional victims_\n\n##### Overlaps With Other China-Nexus Threat Activity\n\nWhile investigating the TAG-38 intrusion activity, we\nuncovered multiple links to other suspected Chinese statesponsored activity. Of note, the targeting and use of ShadowPad\nis consistent with previously reported RedEcho activity, and this\nlatest activity also includes a repeated SLDC victim. However,\nthere were distinct differences in the infrastructure TTPs used\nin this latest campaign, and at this time we have not identified\nsufficient technical evidence tying these 2 activity groups\ntogether beyond the common targeting sets and capability use.\n\n_Figure 5: Maltego chart of TAG-38 infrastructure clustering_\n\n\nThe use of a shared SSL certificate (SHA1 fingerprint\n0f6afc6e4e383883a6308fcf8d84b14a5bf4ccaf) exhibited on\nseveral TAG-38 servers was also notable. This SSL certificate\nwas also identified historically on a few dozen other servers\nwith links to Chinese cyber espionage activity. For example,\none of the IP addresses historically exhibiting this certificate,\n185.243.41[.]240, concurrently hosted several domains attributed\nto the group we track as TAG-26 referenced earlier in this report\n(including supership.dynv6[.]net, supermarket.ownip[.]net, and\ngreatsong.soundcast[.]me). At this time, we believe it is unlikely\nthat the use of this certificate is exclusive to a single activity\ngroup. This is based on wider context such as differing targeting\npatterns, infrastructure TTPs, and capability use linked to the\ninfrastructure historically sighted exhibiting this certificate,\nwhich may instead be indicative of a shared capability.\n\nSubject: CN=www.microsoft.com\n\nIssuer: CN=www.microsoft.com\n\nDecimal: -3057430298263606566302079470361224100\n\nHex: 0xfdb3290c46b41fb24a0fefd16e565c5c\n\nValidity: 2021-06-07 14:29:51 to 2039-12-31 23:59:59\n\nNames: www.microsoft.com\n\nSHA-256: B63e14d24e0893f85e80b4b94ad0bd800d6e105\n\n70dc93ec56bbe75cd665385b0\n\nSHA-1: 0f6afc6e4e383883a6308fcf8d84b14a5bf4ccaf\n\nMD5: d06cc3e6f5673b2e9bfdac55944109a5\n\n_Figure 6: Shared SSL certificate linked to TAG-38 and wider Chinese cyber espionage activity_\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nWe recommend that users conduct the following measures\nto detect and mitigate activity associated with TAG-38 activity:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),\n\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network\ndefense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking connection attempts to and\nfrom — the external IP addresses and domains listed in\nthe appendix.\n\n  - Recorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious\n\nserver configurations in the Command and Control\nSecurity Control Feed. The Command and Control list\nincludes tools used by TAG-38 and Chinese statesponsored threat activity groups, such as ShadowPad.\nRecorded Future clients should alert on and block these\nC2 servers to allow for detection and remediation of\nactive intrusions.\n\n  - Monitor for consistent anomalous outbound traffic from\n\nyour network to unusual servers, such as compromised\nDVR/IP camera systems in this case, which may be\nindicative of malware beaconing activity.\n\n  - Ensure software and firmware associated with IOT\n\ndevices, such as DVR/IP camera systems, are kept up to\ndate. Always change any default passwords to a strong,\ncomplex password and turn on two-factor authentication\n(2FA) if available. Where possible, avoid exposing these\ndevices directly to the internet.\n\n  - Recorded Future Threat Intelligence, Third-Party\n\n[Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence module users can](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nmonitor real-time output from network traffic analysis\nanalytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity\ninvolving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n\n#### Outlook\n\nRecorded Future continues to track Chinese state-sponsored\nactivity groups targeting a wide variety of sectors globally. A\nlarge majority of this conforms to longstanding cyber espionage\nefforts, such as targeting of foreign governments, surveillance\nof dissident and minority groups, and economic espionage.\nHowever, the coordinated effort to target Indian power grid\nassets in recent years is notably distinct from our perspective\nand, given the continued heightened tension and border disputes\nbetween the two countries, we believe is a cause for concern.\n\nBased on the complexity present across national critical\ninfrastructure systems, this often necessitates lengthy\nreconnaissance operations to better understand the inner\nworkings of these systems, both in a technological and a physical\nsense. This is reflected in publicly documented targeted intrusion\nactivity targeting industrial control system (ICS) networks\nhistorically, which can often [span years. At this time, we have](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/triton-actor-ttp-profile-custom-attack-tools-detections)\nnot identified evidence of compromise of ICS networks by TAG38 operators from our visibility, although we cannot discount\nthis possibility. Given the prolonged targeting of both SLDCs\nand RLDCs within India, first from RedEcho and now in this latest\nTAG-38 activity, we believe this targeting is a strategic priority\nfor these actors and is likely to continue.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A — Indicators\n\n[Readers can access the indicators listed below in our public Insikt Group Github repository: https://github.com/Insikt-Group/](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research)\n[Research](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research) **(Continued Targeting of Indian Power Grid Assets by China State-sponsored Activity Group - March 2022).**\n\n_Note: We have observed a portion of the compromised infrastructure listed below indiscriminately scanning the internet_\n_outside of the First Seen/Last Seen dates associated with TAG-38 activity.
