    "plain_text": "# APT43: North Korean Group Uses Cybercrime to Fund Espionage Operations\n\n\n-----\n\n### Executive Summary\n## APT43\n\n              - APT43 is a prolific cyber operator that supports the interests of the North Korean regime. The group\n\ncombines moderately-sophisticated technical capabilities with aggressive social engineering tactics,\nespecially against South Korean and U.S.-based government organizations, academics, and think tanks\nfocused on Korean peninsula geopolitical issues.\n\n              - In addition to its espionage campaigns, we believe APT43 funds itself through cybercrime operations to\n\nsupport its primary mission of collecting strategic intelligence.\n\n              - The group creates numerous spoofed and fraudulent personas for use in social engineering, as well as\n\ncover identities for purchasing operational tooling and infrastructure.\n\n              - APT43 has collaborated with other North Korean espionage operators on multiple operations,\n\nunderscoring the major role APT43 plays in the regime’s cyber apparatus.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Details\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that APT43 is a\nmoderately-sophisticated cyber operator that supports the\ninterests of the North Korean regime. Campaigns attributed to\nAPT43 include strategic intelligence collection aligned with\nPyongyang’s geopolitical interests, credential harvesting and\nsocial engineering to support espionage activities, and\nfinancially-motivated cybercrime to fund operations. Tracked\nsince 2018, APT43 collection priorities align with the mission of\nthe Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North Korea's main\nforeign intelligence service. The group’s focus on foreign policy\nand nuclear security issues supports North Korea’s strategic and\nnuclear ambitions. However, the group’s focus on health-related\nverticals throughout the majority of 2021, likely in support of\npandemic response efforts, highlights its responsiveness to\nshifting priorities from Pyongyang.\n\n- Publicly reported activities attributed to APT43 are frequently\n\nreported as “Kimsuky” or “Thallium” and include credential\nharvesting and espionage activity most likely intended to\ninform North Korean leadership on ongoing geopolitical\ndevelopments.\n\n- Their most frequently observed operations are spear\nphishing campaigns supported by spoofed domains and email\naddresses as part of their social engineering tactics. Domains\nmasquerading as legitimate sites are used in credential\nharvesting operations.\n\n\n\n- We have not observed APT43 exploiting zero-day\n\nvulnerabilities.\n\n- APT43 maintains a high tempo of activity, is prolific in its\n\nphishing and credential collection campaigns, and has\ndemonstrated coordination with other elements of the North\nKorean cyber ecosystem.\n\n- Targeting is regionally focused on South Korea and the U.S., as\n\nwell as Japan and Europe, especially in the following sectors:\n\n– government\n\n– education/research/think tanks focused on geopolitical and\n\nnuclear policy\n\n– business services\n\n– manufacturing\n\nAlthough the overall targeting reach is broad, the ultimate aim of\ncampaigns is most likely centered around enabling North Korea’s\nweapons program, including: collecting information about\ninternational negotiations, sanctions policy, and other country’s\nforeign relations and domestic politics as these may affect\nNorth Korea’s nuclear ambitions.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Shifts in Targeting\n\nCampaigns attributed to APT43 are closely aligned with state\ninterests and correlate strongly with geopolitical developments\nthat affect Kim Jong-un and the hermit state’s ruling elite. Since\nMandiant has been tracking APT43, they have consistently\nconducted espionage activity against South Korean and U.S.\norganizations with a stake in security issues affecting the\nKorean peninsula.\n\n- Prior to October 2020, APT43 primarily targeted government\n\noffices, diplomatic organizations, and think tank-related\nentities with a stake in foreign policy and security issues\naffecting the Korean peninsula in South Korea and the U.S.\n\n- From October 2020 through October 2021, a significant portion\n\nof APT43 activity targeted on health-related verticals and\n\n\npharmaceutical companies, most likely in support of COVID-19\nresponse efforts in North Korea. Although it is unclear how any\ntargeted information benefited the regime, cooperation with\nand across other North Korean cyber operators provides some\nindication of significant resourcing and prioritization of this\neffort during the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\n- Throughout this period APT43 espionage campaigns targeting\n\nSouth Korea, the U.S., Europe and Japan were ongoing.\n\n- Notably, observed APT43 activity varied slightly according\n\nto targeting, including differences in malware deployed. For\nexample, the use of VENOMBITE (a loader), SWEETDROP (a\ndropper), and BITTERSWEET (a backdoor) was distinct to\nAPT43 activity targeting South Korea during the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\n\n**FIGURE 1. Countries targeted by APT43 (dark red indicating more frequently observed activity).**\n\n\nCivil society and non-profits\n\nEducation\n\nGovernments\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n**FIGURE 2. Industries targeted directly by APT43.**\n\n\nConstruction/Materials\n\nDefense/Aerospace\n\nTelecoms\n\nHigh-tech industry\n\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nConsulting/Professional services\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cyber Operations\n\nAPT43 most commonly leverages tailored spear-phishing emails\nto gain access to victim information. However the group also\nengages in various other activities to support collecting strategic\nintelligence, including using spoofed websites for credential\nharvesting and carrying out cybercrime to fund itself.\n\n- The actors regularly update lure content and tailor it to the\n\nspecific target audience, particularly around nuclear security\nand non-proliferation.\n\n- APT43 is adept at creating convincing personas, including\n\nmasquerading as key individuals within their target area (such\nas security and defense), as well as leveraging stolen personally\nidentifiable information (PII) to create accounts and register\ndomains.\n\n- APT43 uses highly relevant lure content together with spoofed\n\nemail addresses.\n\n– APT43 also leverages contact lists stolen from compromised\n\nindividuals to identify additional targets for spear-phishing\noperations.\n\n- APT43 steals and launders enough cryptocurrency to buy\n\noperational infrastructure in a manner aligned with North\nKorea’s juche state ideology of self-reliance, reducing fiscal\nstrain on the central government.\n\n**Espionage**\n\nWe consider cyber espionage to be the primary mission for APT43\nand available data indicates that the group’s other activities are\ncarried out to support collecting strategic intelligence.\n\n- The group is primarily interested in information developed\n\nand stored within the U.S. military and government, defense\nindustrial base (DIB), and research and security policies\ndeveloped by U.S.-based academia and think tanks focused on\nnuclear security policy and nonproliferation.\n\n- APT43 has displayed interest in similar industries within\n\nSouth Korea, specifically non-profit organizations and\nuniversities that focus on global and regional policies, as\nwell as businesses, such as manufacturing, that can provide\ninformation around goods whose export to North Korea\nhas been restricted. This includes fuel, machinery, metals,\ntransportation vehicles, and weapons.\n\n\n\n- APT43 poses as reporters and think-tank analysts to build\n\nrapport with targeted individuals to collect intelligence (Figure\n[3). Corroborated by public reporting, the group has convinced](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korean-cyber-spies-deploy-new-tactic-tricking-foreign-experts-into-writing-2022-12-12/)\nacademics to deliver strategic analysis directly to espionage\noperators.\n\n**FIGURE 3. A sample email exchange in which APT43 builds rapport with a**\npotential victim by masquerading as a journalist\n\n- Technical indicators linked to APT43 partially corroborate\n\n[Korean language reporting that the group targeted South](https://www.boannews.com/media/view.asp?idx=104989)\nKorean political organizations, especially ahead of South\nKorea’s presidential elections in 2022, most likely to glean\ninsight into possible policy shifts.\n\nWe have some indication that APT43 also carries out internal\nmonitoring of other North Korean operations, including noncyber activities. APT43 has compromised individual espionage\nactors, including those within its own operations. However it is\nunclear if this is intentional for self-monitoring purposes or\naccidental and indicative of poor operational security.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Credential Collection**\n\nAPT43 operates credential collection campaigns to directly compromise financial data, PII, and client data from entities within the\nacademic, manufacturing, and national security industries—especially in South Korea. In particular, the group registers domains\nmasquerading as popular search engines, web platforms, and cryptocurrency exchanges in relevant target countries of interest. We\nbelieve these credentials are used to support operations that further APT43 missions.\n\n- Collected credential data was used to create online personas and set up infrastructure for cyber espionage operations, including sites\n\nspoofing legitimate services (Figure 4).\n\n**FIGURE 4. A credential collection website at APT43-controlled sesorin.lol, spoofing Cornell University**\n\n- The group has leveraged both compromised and actor-owned infrastructure to host and deliver malware to targets and collect\n\ncredentials.\n\n– Compromised websites were used as part of network infrastructure to deliver both PASSMARK and LATEOP malware in 2018\n\nChanges in targeting may reflect tactical shifts in collection requirements.\n\n- In late 2021, APT43 resumed credential harvesting campaigns against religious groups, universities, and non-governmental\n\norganizations (NGOs), providing some indication that these campaigns were targeting \"track two\" diplomatic channels between North\nKorea and counterparts in South Korea and Japan. Notably, the activity represented a return to a primary focus on espionage targeting\nafter a temporary focus on COVID-19 related organizations.\n\n- In early 2022, Mandiant Intelligence observed multiple credential collection campaigns targeting academics, journalists, politicians,\n\nbloggers, and other private sector individuals, primarily in South Korea.\n\n- By mid-2022, credential theft campaigns shifted to targeting South Korean bloggers and social media users associated with South\n\nKorean affairs, human rights, academia, religion, and cryptocurrency.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cryptocurrency Targeting**\n\nAPT43 has targeted cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-related\nservices. In contrast to other North Korean groups such as APT38,\nwhich are likely primarily tasked to bring in funds for the regime,\nAPT43 most likely carries out such operations to sustain its own\noperations.\n\n- We have identified APT43 using cryptocurrency services\n\nto launder stolen currency. Associated activity included\nidentified payment methods, aliases, and addresses used for\npurchases (Figure 5), and the likely use of hash rental and cloud\nmining services to launder stolen cryptocurrency into clean\ncryptocurrency.\n\n**FIGURE 5. APT43 likely used stolen Bitcoin to pay for Namecheap services**\n\n\n– For a fee, these hash rental and cloud mining services\n\nprovide hash power, which is used to mine cryptocurrency to\na wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based\nassociation to the buyer’s original payments.\n\n– Several payment methods were used for infrastructure and\n\nhardware purchases including PayPal, American Express\ncards, and Bitcoin likely derived from previous operations.\n\n- APT43 used a malicious Android app to most likely target\n\nChinese users looking for cryptocurrency loans. The app and\nan associated domain probably harvested credentials, as\ndepicted in Figure 6.\n\nDirty crypto\npays for hash\nrental\n\n**CRYPTO MINING**\n\n**HASH POWER**\n\nClean coin with no\nblockchain-based\nconnections\n\n**FIGURE 6.The laundering of cryptocurrency via hash rental services**\nas used by APT43\n\n- The prevalence of financially-motivated activity among North\n\nKorean groups, even among those which have historically\nfocused on cyber espionage, suggests a widespread mandate\nto self-fund and an expectation to sustain themselves without\nadditional resourcing.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT43 is a state-sponsored\ncyber operator that acts in support of the North Korean\ngovernment’s wider geopolitical aims.\n\n- The group’s targeting is consistent with North Korea’s\n\nshifting interests, although its dominant activity is to collect\nintelligence on the country’s primary rival: South Korea.\n\n– By extension, the United States’ support of South Korea also\n\nmakes it a priority target.\n\n- APT43 has shared infrastructure and tools with known North\n\nKorean operators, highlighting its role and mission alignment\nin a wider state-sponsored cyber apparatus.\n\n\nMore specifically, Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence\nthat APT43 is attributable to the North Korean Reconnaissance\nGeneral Bureau (RGB), the country’s primary foreign intelligence\nservice.\n\n- Elements of APT43 have been identified cooperating with\n\nother RGB-linked cyber espionage operators, namely TEMP.\nHermit (e.g. UNC1758). This is detailed further in the next\nsection.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Links to Other Espionage Operators\n\n\nAPT43 operations have at times, overlapped with those of other\nNorth Korean cyber espionage operators. However, we assess\nthese groups to be distinct and separate and, believe the\noverlaps are likely the result of ad hoc collaborations or other\nlimited resource sharing. These overlaps principally take the\nform of malware families that had historically been used by a\nsingle North Korean cluster being employed by additional actors.\n\n- APT43 employed malware first associated with suspected\n\nTEMP.Hermit clusters (often publicly reported as “Lazarus”)\nduring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this\ndemonstrated some shared resources between APT43\nand TEMP.Hermit clusters, we assess that these links were\ntemporary (Figure 7).\n\n– Specifically, such activities included campaigns targeting\n\nglobal organizations involved in COVID-19 response. In some\nof these operations, a subset of APT43 almost certainly\nworked closely with other RGB-linked units, including sharing\nexisting malware tools, developing new tools initially used in\nthe expanded tasking, and carrying out sustained campaigns\nagainst healthcare research and related organizations.\n\n  - Distinct tools derived from APT43 malware—such as the\n\ndownloader PENCILDOWN—for use in these campaigns\nincluded PENDOWN, VENOMBITE, and EGGHATCH (also all\ndownloaders, see Figure 7).\n\n  - These tools were used alongside core APT43 tooling such\n\nas LOGCABIN and LATEOP.\n\n  - APT43's use of malware variants such as HANGMAN.V2, a\n\nderivative of the HANGMAN backdoor usually linked with\nTEMP.Hermit, suggests some level of cross-pollination\noccurred during coordinated operations in 2020.\n\n\n\n- These apparent cross-group operations were publicly reported\n\nas “Bureau 325” and also matched activity reported as “Cerium”.\n\n- Additional uncategorized clusters have been identified\n\nleveraging some of the same tools as APT43. A cluster using\nPENCILDOWN, for example, compromised an Android mobile\nwallet app to steal cryptocurrency.\n\n- Conversely, in a separate instance we observed APT43\n\ndeploying LONEJOGGER, a tool strongly associated with\nUNC1069 cryptocurrency targeting.\n\n– UNC1069 is a suspected North Korean cybercrime operation\n\nwith low confidence links to APT38.\n\nOpen sources often include additional operations in public\nreporting on “Kimsuky” activity. However, Mandiant continues to\ntrack these separately, especially those that leverage malware\nfamilies such as KONNI and related tools CABRIDE and\nPLANEPATCH. Although these clusters of activity have overlaps\nwith APT43, we believe that these links are tenuous and are the\nwork of a separate group.\n\n\n-----\n\n|2018|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|2019|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|Col25|2020|Col27|Col28|Col29|Col30|Col31|Col32|Col33|Col34|Col35|Col36|Col37|Col38|2021|Col40|Col41|Col42|Col43|Col44|Col45|Col46|Col47|Col48|Col49|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR||MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN||JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN||FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JULY|AUG|SEP|OCT|\n||||||LATEOP / APT43||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||DRIVEDOWN / APT43|||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||1873|||||||LOGCABIN / APT43|||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||L|OG|CAB|IN|/ U|NC|1873||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|MONKE|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||MONKE|||YC|HER|RY|/ U|NC|78|6||||||||||||||||||||||MON|KE|YC|HE|RR|Y /|UN||C2|226||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||W|||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||W|OR|RY|W|ART|/|UN|C22||26|||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||CUTELOOP / UNC1758|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|HOTCORE / UNC786|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|H||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||T43|||\n||H|AN|GM|AN|/ U|NC|785|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||HA|NG|MA|N.v|2 /|AP|T43|||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||C1758||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||F|ALL|CH|ILL|/|UN|C1758||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||PENCILDOWN / APT43|||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||PENDOWN / APT43||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||VENOMBITE / APT43||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||T43|||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||EG|GHA|TC|H /|AP||T43|||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||T43|||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||BI||TT|ER|SW|EE|T /|AP|T43|||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||3||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||S|WE|ET|DRO|P /|AP||T4|3||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\nActivity\n\n‘Core’ APT43 tooling\n\nAPT43 tools developed during overlap period\n\n\nTEMP.Hermit\n\nOther assorted North Korean groups\n\n\n**FIGURE 7. Convergence between APT43, TEMP.Hermit, and other tracked North Korean clusters based on malware deployment**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware\n\nAPT43 relies on a relatively large toolkit composed of both non-public malware and widely available tools. Most open source reporting on\nAPT43 tracks the group using LATEOP (known publicly as “BabyShark”), but we have observed a steady evolution and expansion of the\noperation’s malware library over time. Some of the tools borrow code heavily from preceding tools (Figure 8), implementing improvements\nand adding features.\n\n- The group has deployed publicly available malware including gh0st RAT, QUASARRAT, and AMADEY, but its activities are much better\n\nknown for being associated with LATEOP, a backdoor based on VisualBasic scripts.\n\n- APT43 has developed different variants of some of their tools, enabling multi-platform targeting. For example, we have identified an\n\nAndroid variant of PENCILDOWN, a Windows-based downloader.\n\n\nDINOLAB LATEOP\n\nBOTTLECRAB LANDMARK GOLDDROP BENCHMARK\n\nWORRYWART GREASE Decode Routine DRIVEDOWN\n\nCert GOLDPICK Similar Parsing\n\nGOLDDRAGON Similar PDB\n\nGRAYZONE GOLDNUGGET SPICYTUNA\n\nURI Callout Doc Image\n\n**FIGURE 8.

We believe North Korea has become increasingly dependent\non its cyber capabilities and, APT43’s persistent and continuously-developing operations reflect the country’s sustained investment and\nreliance on groups like APT43.\n\nAs demonstrated by the group’s sudden but temporary shift towards healthcare and pharmaceutical-related targeting, APT43 is highly\nresponsive to the demands of Pyongyang’s leadership. Although spear-phishing and credential collection against government, military,\nand diplomatic organizations have been core taskings for the group, APT43 ultimately modifies its targeting and tactics, techniques and\nprocedures to suit its sponsors, including carrying out financially-motivated cybercrime as needed to support the regime.\n\n\nTechnical Annex: Attack Lifecycle\n\n\n\n- Shortcut modification\n\n- Scheduled task\n\n- Windows service\n\n- Office application startup\n\n- Browser extensions\n\n- Registry run keys/startup folder\n\n- Web shells\n\n- BRAVEPRINCE\n\n- FASTFIRE\n\n- GOLDDRAGON\n\n- GOLDDROP\n\n- GRAYZONE\n\n- JURASSICSHELL\n\n- LATEOP\n\n- LONEJOGGER\n\n- PENCILDOWN\n\n- PASSMARK\n\n- QUASARRAT\n\n- SOURDOUGH\n\n- TROIBOMB\n\n- XRAT\n\n\n**INITIAL COMPROMISE** **ESTABLISH FOOTHOLD** **COMPLETE MISSION**\n\n\n\n - Spear-phishing emails with\nlinks or attachments\n\n - Macros\n\n - Stolen credentials\n\n - GOLDDRAGON.POWERSHELL\n\n - LATEOP\n\n - LOGCABIN\n\n - LONEJOGGER\n\n - SPICYTUNA\n\n**FIGURE 9.
