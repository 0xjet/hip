    "plain_text": "# Continuing our work to hold cybercriminal ecosystems accountable\n\n**[blog.google/technology/safety-security/continuing-our-work-to-hold-cybercriminal-ecosystems-accountable/](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/continuing-our-work-to-hold-cybercriminal-ecosystems-accountable/)**\n\nMike Trinh April 26, 2023\n\nSafety & Security\n\n[Last year, we shared details about our success in holding operators of the Glupteba botnet](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/a-ruling-in-our-legal-case-against-the-glupteba-botnet/)\nresponsible for their targeting of online users. We noted that our work was not done and that\nwe would continue raising awareness around issues and working to disrupt groups looking to\ntake advantage of users. Today, we’re sharing another milestone in that work.\n\nYesterday, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York unsealed our civil action\nagainst the malware distributors of Cryptbot, which we estimate infected approximately\n670,000 computers this past year and targeted users of Google Chrome to steal their data.\nWe’re targeting the distributors who are paid to spread malware broadly for users to\ndownload and install, which subsequently infects machines and steals user data.\nCybercriminals often operate like businesses, specializing in a particular function, and\npartner with other criminal specialists to profit off harm to innocent users. This lawsuit\ntargeting Cryptbot’s malware distributors shows our commitment to protecting users from\neach level of the cybercriminal ecosystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n## About CryptBot\n\nCryptBot is a type of malware often referred to as an “infostealer” because it is designed to\nidentify and steal sensitive information from victims’ computers such as authentication\ncredentials, social media account logins, cryptocurrency wallets, and more. CryptBot then\nsends the stolen data to be harvested and eventually sold to bad actors to use in data\nbreach campaigns. CryptBot distributors offer maliciously modified versions of many software\npackages, including Google Earth Pro and Google Chrome. Users download and install\nthese packages, without realizing that doing so infects their machines with malware. Recent\nCryptBot versions have been designed to specifically target users of Google Chrome, which\nis where Google’s CyberCrimes Investigations Group (CCIG) and Threat Analysis Group\n(TAG) teams worked to identify the distributors, investigate and take action.\n\n## Legal strategy and disruption\n\nOur litigation was filed against several of CryptBot’s major distributors who we believe are\nbased in Pakistan and operate a worldwide criminal enterprise. The legal complaint is based\non a variety of claims, including computer fraud and abuse and trademark infringement. To\nhamper the spread of CryptBot, the court has granted a temporary restraining order to\nbolster our ongoing technical disruption efforts against the distributors and their\ninfrastructure. The court order allows us to take down current and future domains that are\ntied to the distribution of CryptBot. This will slow new infections from occurring and\ndecelerate the growth of CryptBot. Lawsuits have the effect of establishing both legal\nprecedent and putting those profiting, and others who are in the same criminal ecosystem,\nunder scrutiny.\n\n## Dangers of unknown software\n\nTo further combat security risks, [Cybercrime Support Network recommends additional steps](https://fightcybercrime.org/)\nusers should take to protect themselves against malware like CryptBot:\n\n**Download from well-known and trusted sources: Only download software from the**\n[official website or app store and take Chrome Safe Browsing warnings seriously.](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)\n**Read reviews and do your research: Before downloading any software, do research**\non the product, and read reviews from others who have already downloaded and used\nthe software.\n**Keep your operating system and software up-to-date: Make sure to regularly**\nupdate your device's operating system and software to the latest version. Updates\noften include security patches and bug fixes that can help protect from threats.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n\n-----\n\nThis litigation is another step forward in holding cybercriminals accountable, by not just\ntargeting those that operate botnets, but also those that profit from malware distribution. With\nthese, and future actions, we look forward to continuing our ongoing commitment to help\nprotect the safety of online users.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Safety & Security](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/%20)\n\n\n-----",
