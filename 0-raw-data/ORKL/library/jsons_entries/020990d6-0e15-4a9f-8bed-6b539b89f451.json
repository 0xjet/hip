The technical analysis conducted jointly by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty\nInternational’s Security Lab identified 18 additional victims who have been targeted as part of\nthe same campaign. The email and other sensitive data of at least three of them had been\ncompromised: a correspondent for a major US newspaper, a women’s rights defender based\nin the Gulf region, and Nicholas Noe, an advocacy consultant for Refugees International\nbased in Lebanon\n\n\n-----\n\nIran s state-backed hackers are aggressively using sophisticated social engineering and\ncredential harvesting tactics to access sensitive information and contacts held by Middle\nEast-focused researchers and civil society groups,” said [Abir Ghattas, information security](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/abir-ghattas)\ndirector at Human Rights Watch. “This significantly increases the risks that journalists and\nhuman rights defenders face in Iran and elsewhere in the region.”\n\nFor the three people whose accounts were known to be compromised, the attackers gained\naccess to their emails, cloud storage drives, calendars, and contacts and also performed a\n[Google Takeout, using a service that exports data from the core and additional services of a](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout)\nGoogle account.\n\nVarious security companies have reported on phishing campaigns by APT42 targeting\nMiddle East-focused researchers, civil society groups, and dissidents. Most of them identify\nAPT42 based on targeting patterns and technical evidence. Organizations such as Google\n[and the cybersecurity companies Recorded Future,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/suspected-iran-nexus-tag-56-uses-uae-forum-lure-for-credential-theft-against-us-think-tank/) [Proofpoint, and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta453-uses-multi-persona-impersonation-capitalize-fomo) [Mandiant have linked](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises)\nAPT 42 to Iranian authorities. Identifying and naming a threat actor helps researchers to\nidentify, track, and link hostile cyber activity.\n\nIn October 2022, a Human Rights Watch staff member working on the Middle East and North\nAfrica region received suspicious messages on WhatsApp from a person pretending to work\nfor a think tank based in Lebanon, inviting them to a conference. The joint investigation\nrevealed that the phishing links sent via WhatsApp, once clicked, directed the target to a fake\nlogin page that captured the user’s email password and authentication code. The research\nteam investigated the infrastructure that hosted the malicious links and identified additional\ntargets of this ongoing campaign.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International contacted the 18 high profile individuals\nidentified as targets of this campaign. Fifteen of them responded and confirmed that they had\nreceived the same WhatsApp messages at some point between September 15 and\nNovember 25, 2022.\n\nOn November 23, 2022, a second Human Rights Watch staff member was also targeted.\nThey received the same WhatsApp messages from the same number that contacted other\ntargets.\n\nSocial engineering and phishing attempts remain key components of Iranian cyberattacks.\n[Since 2010, Iranian operators have targeted members of foreign governments, militaries,](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/01/04/iran-s-internal-targets-pub-75142)\n[and businesses, as well as political dissidents and human rights defenders. Over time, these](https://www.miaan.org/publication/spiraling-attacks/)\nattacks have become more sophisticated in the ways they execute what is known as “social\nengineering.”\n\nAccording to [Mandiant, a US-based cybersecurity company, APT42 has been responsible for](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises)\nseveral phishing attacks in Europe, the US, and the Middle East and North Africa region. On\nSeptember 14, 2022, the US Office of Foreign Asset Control at the Treasury Department\n\n\n-----\n\n[imposed sanctions on individuals affiliated with the group.](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0948)\n\nThe investigation also revealed inadequacies in Google’s security protections to safeguard\nits users’ data. Individuals successfully targeted by the phishing attack told Human Rights\nWatch that they did not realize their Gmail accounts had been compromised or a Google\nTakeout had been initiated, in part because the security warnings under Google’s account\nactivity do not push or display any permanent notification in a user’s inbox or send a push\nmessage to the Gmail app on their phone.\n\nGoogle’s security activity revealed that the attackers accessed the targets’ accounts almost\nimmediately after the compromise, and they maintained access to the accounts until the\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International research team informed them and assisted\nthem in removing the attacker’s connected device.\n\nGoogle should promptly strengthen its Gmail account security warnings to better protect\njournalists, human rights defenders, and its most at-risk users from attacks, Human Rights\nWatch said.\n\n“In a Middle East region rife with surveillance threats for activists, it's essential for digital\nsecurity researchers to not only publish and promote findings, but also prioritize the\nprotection of the region's embattled activists, journalists, and civil society leaders,” Ghattas\nsaid.\n\n**Technical Analysis of the Phishing Campaign**\n\nOn October 18, 2022, a Human Rights Watch staff member working on the Middle East and\n[North Africa region received a message on WhatsApp that claimed to be from a Lebanon-](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/lebanon)\nbased think tank and invited the recipient to a conference. The invitation used the same\nformat as previous invitations from the think tank, indicating a sophisticated level of social\nengineering. The person impersonated by the threat actor group APT42 in the WhatsApp\nmessages previously worked for the think tank.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch staff member forwarded these messages to the information\nsecurity team, which confirmed they were a phishing attempt. If the person had clicked on\nthe cutly[.]biz link, they would have been redirected to the URL\n_https://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/BI-File-2022.html which hosts a fake Microsoft login_\npage.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the fake login page hosted on sharefilesonline[.]live (October 2022)\nThe cutly[.]biz domain is a custom URL shortener deployed and managed by the attacker’s\ngroup, designed to mimic the name of the legitimate URL shortener cutt.ly.\n\nThe phishing link sent to the Human Rights Watch staff member included a random path of\nfive characters, both lowercase letters and numbers, which represents around 6 million\ncombinations, making it possible to enumerate all of the existing paths on the attacker’s\ninfrastructure to find other existing links. This enumeration led to the discovery of 44 valid\nURLs, with many of them redirecting to a phishing page that displayed the email address of\nthe target. The phishing pages were specifically crafted to mimic Microsoft, Google, or Yahoo\nlogin pages.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of a phishing page imitating the Yahoo login page (October 2022).\nFurther investigation showed that the phishing kit allowed the bypass of multi-factor\nauthentication methods other than a hardware security key. Multi-factor authentication (MFA),\noften called two-factor authentication, or 2FA, requires a second means of authentication, in\naddition to a password. Common second factors include a temporary code delivered by\nSMS, a temporary code given by a smartphone application (such as FreeOTP or Google\nAuthenticator), and a code generated by a Hardware Security Key (like Yubikey or Solo Key).\nThrough different technical means, it is possible to create phishing toolkits that bypass MFA\nwhen the temporary code is delivered by SMS or by a smartphone application. It is not\npossible at present for a phishing kit to bypass multi-factor authentication using hardware\nkeys.\n\nThe WhatsApp chats of those who were known to be successfully targeted reveal that the\nattackers were repeatedly engaging with the targets as they clicked through the phishing\nlinks. After entering their credentials on the phishing page, targets were prompted to enter a\ncode on the 2FA bypass page, which the attackers used to gain access to their email\naccounts. Phishing kits with MFA bypass features have been common since at least 2018,\nand Amnesty International’s Security Lab has documented multiple usages of such kits\n[against human rights defenders in 2018 and](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/12/when-best-practice-is-not-good-enough/) [2020.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/03/targeted-surveillance-attacks-in-uzbekistan-an-old-threat-with-new-techniques/)\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the multi-factor authentication bypass page (October 2022).\n**Targeting of Journalists and Human Rights Defenders by APT42**\n\nIn addition to the two Human Rights Watch staff members, Human Rights Watch and\nAmnesty International identified 18 other email accounts targeted as part of the same\ncampaign, including six journalists.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International contacted all of the individuals and 15\nresponded. They confirmed they were all targeted with the exact same social engineering\napproach during the period between September 15 and November 25, 2022. Out of the 20\ntargets, at least three had been compromised by the threat actor. Confirming the\ncompromise led the research team to additional information about the data exfiltration\nprocess. Human Rights Watch also supported the journalists by disconnecting the attackers\nfrom their accounts and re-securing them.\n\nThe compromise gave the attackers access to the targets’ emails, cloud storage drives,\ncalendars, and contacts. In at least one case, the attacker synced the target’s mailbox and\nperformed a Google Takeout, a service that exports all of an account’s activity and\ninformation including web searches, payments, travel and locations, ads clicked on, YouTube\nactivity, and additional account information. It is the most comprehensive and intrusive\nmethod to export data in a Google account.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle s security activity revealed that the attackers had accessed the targets accounts\nalmost immediately after the compromise and that they had access for about five days until\nHuman Rights Watch informed the targets and helped remove the attacker’s connected\ndevice.\n\nScreenshot of the Google Activity of one of the targets of the phishing campaign, showing a\nGoogle data request from the attackers. (October 2022).\n**Attribution**\n\nThe Human Rights Watch Information Security team attributes these attacks with high\nconfidence to the Iranian threat actor APT42, also called TA453 by [Proofpoint, Phosphorus](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/badblood-ta453-targets-us-and-israeli-medical-research-personnel-credential)\nby [Microsoft, and Charming Kitten by ClearSky and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-vigilant/) [CERTFA based on specific technical](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/fake-interview-the-new-activity-of-charming-kitten/)\nindicators linked to the phishing attacks and operational infrastructure used by the attackers\nwhen accessing compromised accounts. The list of APT42’s targets that Human Rights\nWatch identified all relate to the Middle East, including Iran, and one compromised account\nwas accessed by an IP address based in Tehran (see the technical details sections).Several\norganizations have confirmed this attribution based on their own research into related\ncampaigns.\n\n[Many organizations, such as Google, and the cybersecurity companies Recorded Future and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/suspected-iran-nexus-tag-56-uses-uae-forum-lure-for-credential-theft-against-us-think-tank/)\n[Proofpoint, who have investigated APT42 attacks, have concluded that APT42 operates on](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta453-uses-multi-persona-impersonation-capitalize-fomo)\nbehalf of Iranian authorities. In September, the American cybersecurity company, Mandiant,\n[attributed APT42’s activities to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises)\n\nThe source code of the phishing page used against the 20 targets includes JavaScript code\nthat is very similar to code that was used on a phishing page hosted on the domain mailerdaemon[.]net in November 2022, which was part of a phishing campaign attributed by\n\n\n-----\n\n[Recorded Future to the Iranian threat actor APT42. The same code was also found on](https://www.recordedfuture.com/suspected-iran-nexus-tag-56-uses-uae-forum-lure-for-credential-theft-against-us-think-tank)\ncontinuetogo[.]me in August 2021, which was part of a phishing campaign attributed by\n[Google to Iranian government-backed threat actors.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-iran/)\n\n\n-----\n\nComparison of the source code of the phishing pages hosted on sharefilesonline[.]live and\nmailer-daemon[.]net and continuetogo[.]me.\nThe second Human Rights Watch staff member who was targeted on November 23, 2022,\nreceived the same WhatsApp messages from the same number that contacted other targets.\nThe malicious link shared with the staff was hosted on mailer-daemon[.]org and the attackers\nused the same URL shortener (cutly[.]biz) to hide the full name of the domain.\n\nThe use of fake, uncommon, or custom URL shorteners was also seen in attacks attributed\nto other Iranian threat actors such as Phosphorus against Israeli and US targets in June\n2022, for which they used litby[.]us.\n\nThe investigation of the attacker’s infrastructure showed that the same group registered the\ndomain uani[.]us, a typo-squatted domain that copies an advocacy group based in the United\nStates called United Against Nuclear Iran, which was targeted by Charming Kitten in\nNovember 2021.\n\nAll of the IP addresses used to connect to the compromised accounts were from the Express\nVPN (Virtual Private Network) service. Nevertheless, Human Rights Watch found one Iranian\nIP address, 5.160.239.XXX, that connected to one of the target’s inboxes. This could\npotentially be the public IP address of the attacker’s own network, perhaps revealed after\nthey forgot to enable their VPN before connecting.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the connection logged on a compromised Google account (October 2022).\n[One of the most notable characteristics of Iranian government-backed threat groups is their](https://www.recordedfuture.com/social-engineering-remains-key-tradecraft-for-iranian-apts)\nhighly targeted spear-phishing, social engineering techniques, and impersonation of\nconference and summit organizers to build trust and rapport with their targets. In this attack,\nAPT42 used the Lebanon-based think tank to trick their targets. The organizers of the\n[Munich Security Conference and Think 20 (T20) Summit in Saudi Arabia have been](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/)\nimpersonated in similar ways.\n\nThe recent Mandiant report on APT42 has provided more detailed information into the\ndifference and links between the APT35 and APT42 groups, both of which Mandiant\nattributes to Iran’s IRGC. The CERTFA, for instance, [has reattributed a campaign to APT42](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-can-we-wave-a-meeting/#fn:20)\ninstead of APT35 after this publication.\n\n**Technical Details on Post-Compromise Action and Indicators of Compromise**\n\nDuring the investigation, Human Rights Watch supported journalists and human rights\ndefenders who were compromised by this phishing campaign. This gave Human Rights\nWatch insight into the attackers’ post-compromise actions.\n\nIn at least one case, the attackers performed a Google Takeout request, a service that\nexports all of an account’s activity and information, including web searches, payments, travel\nand locations, ads clicked on, YouTube activity, and additional account information. It is the\n\n\n-----\n\nmost comprehensive and intrusive method to export data in a Google account. The use of\nGoogle Takeout to extract data from a compromised account is in line with the features of the\nHYPERSCRAPE tool identified by the Google TAG team, although Human Rights Watch\ncould not confirm if the tool was used based on logs to which it had access.\n\nFor several targets, the attacker synchronized the compromised mailbox to a Microsoft\nservice in order to export the contents of the mailbox. As far as we know, it is the first time\nthat this behavior is reported as a post-compromise tactic used by APT42.\n\nGoogle’s security activity revealed that the attackers accessed the targets’ accounts almost\nimmediately after the compromise, and that they maintained access until we informed the\ntargets and assisted them to remove the attacker’s connected device.\n\nBased on Google Security logs, we identified the IP addresses used to connect to a\ncompromised account.\n\nWe observed the same computer name connected to all of the compromised accounts:\nDESKTOP-F8QNCC0.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the computer name connected to all of the compromised accounts.\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nWhatsApp numbers used by the attackers:\n\n1. +1-234-312-1624\n2. +1-209-233-0560\n3. +1-804-500-1154\n\ncutly[.]biz\n\nhxxps://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/BI-File-2022.html\n\nhxxps://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/G-check-first.html\n\nhxxps://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/G-transfer.html\n\nhxxps://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/continue.html\n\nhxxps://sharefilesonline[.]live/xxxxxx/index.php\n\nhxxps://mailer-daemon[.]net/file=sharing=system/xxxxxx/first.check.html\n\nhxxp://mailer-daemon[.]org/ xxxxxx /index.php\n\n\n-----\n\nDESKTOP-F8QNCC0\n\n5.160.239.XXX\n\n## Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\nTopic\n\n[Technology and Rights](https://www.hrw.org/topic/technology-and-rights)\n\n\n-----",
