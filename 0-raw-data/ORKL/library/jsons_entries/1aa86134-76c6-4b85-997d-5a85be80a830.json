Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP: WHITE information may be distributed without restriction.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise Associated with OnePercent Group Ransomware\n\n### Summary\n\n The FBI has learned of a cyber-criminal group who self identifies as the “OnePercent Group” and who have used Cobalt Strike to perpetuate ransomware attacks against US companies since November 2020. OnePercent Group actors compromise victims through a phishing email in which an attachment is opened by the user. The attachment’s macros infect the system with the IcedID[1] banking trojan. IcedID downloads additional software to include Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike moves laterally in the network, primarily with PowerShell remoting. \n\n OnePercent Group actors encrypt the data and exfiltrate it from the victims’ systems. The actors contact the victims via telephone and email, threatening to release the stolen data through The Onion Router (TOR) network and clearnet, unless a ransom is paid in virtual currency. OnePercent Group actors’ extortion tactics always begin with a warning and progress from a partial leak of data to a full leak of all the victim’s exfiltrated data. The extortion/data leak typically follows these steps:\n\n\n1 IcedID can also be delivered using TA551 (also known as Shathak and GoldCabin).\n\n\n-----\n\n### • Leak Warning: After initially gaining access to a victim network, OnePercent Group actors leave a\n ransom note stating the data has been encrypted and exfiltrated. The note states the victim needs to contact the OnePercent Group actors on TOR or the victim data will be leaked. If the victim does not make prompt communication within a week of infection, the OnePercent Group actors follow up with emails and phone calls to the victim stating the data will be leaked.\n • One Percent Leak: If the victim does not pay the ransom quickly, the OnePercent Group actors\n threaten to release a portion of the stolen data to various clearnet websites.\n • Full Leak: If the ransom is not paid in full after the “one percent leak”, OnePercent Group actors\n threaten to sell the stolen data to the Sodinokibi Group[2] to publish at an auction.\n\n Ransom Note Details and TOR Website\n\n OnePercent Group ransom notes are uniquely named and provide a link to the TOR website, which victims must access by downloading and using a TOR browser. This website is used to communicate the ransom amount, provide technical support, and negotiate with the victims via an online chat functionality. The victims are instructed to pay the ransom to a Bitcoin address, and advised that a decryption key will be provided in 24-48 hours after payment.\n\n Details Onion Domain:\n```\n 5mvifa3xq5m7sou3xzaajfz7h6eserp5fnkwotohns5pgbb5oxty3zad.onion\n BTC Address: bc1qds0yly3fn608gtm332gag029munvlute2wxktn\n\n File Names and Tools used by Attackers\n\n The following applications are leveraged by OnePercent actors to compromise victims. While some of these applications support legitimate purposes, they can also be used by threat actors to aid in system compromise or exploration of a victim company’s enterprise network:\n\n```\n2 Sodinokibi is a Russia-based ransomware-as-a-service group.\n\n\n\n### • Leak Warning: After initially gaining access to a victim network, OnePercent Group actors leave a\n\n\n-----\n\n### • AWS S3 cloud \n • IcedID \n • Cobalt Strike\n • Powershell\n • Rclone \n • Mimikatz \n • SharpKatz\n • BetterSafetyKatz\n • SharpSploit\n\n Technical Details\n\n OnePercent Group actors gain unauthorized access to victim networks through phishing emails with a malicious zip file attachment. The zip file includes a Microsoft Word or Excel document that contains malicious macros that allow the actors to subsequently infect the victim’s system with the banking Trojan IcedID. The actors use IcedID to install and execute the software Cobalt Strike on the victim’s network to move laterally to other systems within the environment through PowerShell remoting. The actors use rclone for data exfiltration from the victim’s network. The actors have been observed within the victim’s network for approximately one month prior to deployment of the ransomware.\n\n Once the ransomware is successfully deployed, the victim will start to receive phone calls through spoofed phone numbers with ransom demands and are provided a ProtonMail email address for further communication. The actors will persistently demand to speak with a victim company’s designated negotiator or otherwise threaten to publish the stolen data. When a victim company does not respond, the actors send subsequent threats to publish the victim company’s stolen data via the same ProtonMail email address.\n\n The FBI identified the following indicators of compromise (IOCs) that we assess are likely associated with this activity.\n\n|Indicators|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|File Extension of Encrypted Files:|The file extension presents itself as a random 8 character string. .dZCqciAv is an example of an extension seen by a victim company.|\n\n\n\n### • AWS S3 cloud \n\n\n-----\n\nFile Name of [8 character random string]-readme.txt\n\n\nTOR URL: http://5mvifa3xq5m7sou3xzaajfz7h6eserp5fnkwotohns5pgbb5oxty3zad.\nonion\n\n**Email Addresses** **Provided by OnePercent Group Threat Actors**\n1percentransom@protonmail.com 1percentransomware@protonmail.com\n\n**IPs and Domains**\n157.245.239.187 31.187.64.199 206.189.227.145 167.71.224.39\n80.82.67.221 138.197.179.153 134.209.203.30 nix1.xyz\ngolddisco.top delokijio.pw june85.cyou intensemisha.cyou\nbiggarderoub.cyou d30qpb9e10re4o.cloudfront.net\n\n### Recommended Mitigations\n\n Due to the attackers in question utilizing the rclone program, it is recommended that affected organizations be aware of the following hashes associated with rclone:\n\n**Rclone File Hashes**\nSHA256 ECA9FAC6848545FF9386176773810F96323FEFF0D575C4B6E1C55F\nRclone.exe (64 bit) 8DB842E7FE\n\nSHA1 C00CFB456FC6AF0376FBEA877B742594C443DF97\nRclone.exe (64 bit)\n\nSHA256 E70ED531C8A12E7ECCE83223D7B9AA1895110DC140EDF85AFC31C\nRclone.exe (32 bit) 8C5CD580116\n\nSHA1 A1D985E13C07EDDFA2721B14F7C9F869B0D733C9\nRclone.exe (32 bit)\n\nTOR URL: http://5mvifa3xq5m7sou3xzaajfz7h6eserp5fnkwotohns5pgbb5oxty\n3zad. onion\n\n|File Name of Ransom Note|[8 character random string]-readme.txt This readme file will share the same random characters as the encrypted files. .dZCqciAv-readme.txt is an example seen by a victim company|\n|---|---|\n|Observed Malware Filename:|%TEMP%\\Temp1_request.zip\\[FILENAME].doc %PROGRAMDATA%\\vexby.txt|\n|TOR URL:|http://5mvifa3xq5m7sou3xzaajfz7h6eserp5fnkwotohns5pgbb5oxty3zad. onion|\n\n|Email Addresses Provided by OnePercent Group Threat Actors|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|1percentransom@protonmail.com|1percentransomware@protonmail.com|\n\n|IPs and Domains|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|157.245.239.187|31.187.64.199|206.189.227.145|167.71.224.39|\n|80.82.67.221|138.197.179.153|134.209.203.30|nix1.xyz|\n|golddisco.top|delokijio.pw|june85.cyou|intensemisha.cyou|\n|biggarderoub.cyou|d30qpb9e10re4o.cloudfront.net|||\n\n|Rclone File Hashes|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256 Rclone.exe (64 bit)|ECA9FAC6848545FF9386176773810F96323FEFF0D575C4B6E1C55F 8DB842E7FE|\n|SHA1 Rclone.exe (64 bit)|C00CFB456FC6AF0376FBEA877B742594C443DF97|\n|SHA256 Rclone.exe (32 bit)|E70ED531C8A12E7ECCE83223D7B9AA1895110DC140EDF85AFC31C 8C5CD580116|\n|SHA1 Rclone.exe (32 bit)|A1D985E13C07EDDFA2721B14F7C9F869B0D733C9|\n|TOR URL:|http://5mvifa3xq5m7sou3xzaajfz7h6eserp5fnkwotohns5pgbb5oxty 3zad. onion|\n\n\n-----\n\n### • Back-up critical data offline.\n • Ensure administrators are not using “Admin Approval” mode.\n • Implement Microsoft LAPS, if possible.\n • Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage device.
