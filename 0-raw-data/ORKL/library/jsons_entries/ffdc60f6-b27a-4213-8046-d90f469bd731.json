The email contained a link to a Google\ndrive ZIP file.\n\nThe contents of FYI.zip downloaded from the Google Drive link\n\nThe ZIP archive contained three files – an August 2019 policy brief downloaded from Freedom\nHouse regarding the Democratic Crisis in Hong Kong, a September 2019 Hong Kong report\ndownloaded from Human Rights First, and a supposed RTF file from the Nikkei Asian Review.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic document from Freedom House\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic document from Human Rights First\n\nThe third file masquerading as a Nikkei Asian Review document is actually a LNK shortcut file\nwhich had a double extension. When LNK files are viewed through archiving software, the double\nextension “.rtf.lnk” will be shown correctly. If the file was extracted and viewed through the\nWindows Explorer, however, the operating system always hides the LNK extension by default.\n\n_Analysis of the LNK file shows running it will execute msiexec.exe to download and run a remote MSI file_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe LNK file is actually a shortcut to the Windows utility msiexec.exe, which can be used as a\nLOLBin to remotely download and run MSI files which have the PNG extension. In this case, the\nMSI file is remotely downloaded from a GitHub repository and account which was created on\nOctober 10.\n\n_A snapshot of the GitHub repository on October 29_\n\n## siHost64\n\nThe MSI file, “siHost64.png”, was created using a registered or cracked EXEMSI program.\nRunning it will drop and run “siHost64.exe” in the %APPDATA% folder. This executable is a\nPyInstaller executable which has over a thousand files inside it, but the main important file is the\ncompiled python script “siHost64”.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnpacking the PyInstaller executable shows the real files, some of which cannot be seen when performing\n\ndynamic analysis\n\nBy restoring the first eight missing bytes of “siHost64” which is typically required for such\nPyInstaller files, we are then able to decompile the compiled python script and analyze the\nfunctionality of this malware:\n\nUse the Python requests library to call the DropBox API which connects to DropBox and\nuses it as a HTTPS C2 server\nUse the system proxy for communications if any\nAdd itself to the registry AutoRun location\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the registry name “siHost64”.\nOn October 31, the new version of the malware changed the registry name used to\n“Dropbox Update Setup”.\nPerform AES encryption with CBC mode on uploaded files with the key\n“ApmcJue1570368JnxBdGetr*^#ajLsOw” and a random salt\nCheck in to the C2 server by creating an encrypted file containing the operating system\nversion and architecture, date, computer name, and logged in user\nCheck for files from the C2 server which contain encrypted arbitrary commands to be run,\nexecute that command, and create a new encrypted file containing the results of the\nexecuted command.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example of the malware using the Dropbox API to check in_\n\nBased on the check in information from infected machines, it appears that there is a single\ninfected Hong Kong victim of interest to this threat actor connecting to the Dropbox app besides\nthe target we described at the start. The files exfiltrated from this victim appeared to be personal\ndocuments related to the victim traveling to the United States, business forms, and Christian\nhymns.\n\nBesides those exfiltrated documents, the C2 server also appeared to host their next stage\nmalware such as two files named “GetCurrentRollback.exe” and “GetCurrentDeploy.dll”.\n“GetCurrentRollback.exe” is a signed Microsoft executable which seems to be for upgrading the\nprevious Windows operating system version to Windows 10, and “GetCurrentDeploy.dll” likely\nbeing the name of the DLL which is side loaded. The first version of “GetCurrentRollback.exe” we\ncould find was since 2016 and the latest in 2019 November, which means all version might be\nexploitable by DLL Sideloading at first glance.\n\n\n-----\n\nA version of GetCurrentRollback.exe signed on November 13, 2019 is still vulnerable to DLL Sideloading\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the victim profile and the exfiltrated files, it appears one of the intelligence requirements\nof the threat actor is to monitor people with relations to the Hong Kong protests, targeting either\nthem or the people around them. There are multiple possibilities for this requirements, with the\nmost likely being to understand the inner thoughts of pro-democracy movement, or to support or\nundermine the movement behind the scenes.\n\nUsing Dropbox and other legitimate services such as Google Drive and GitHub\nthroughout the attack life cycle is not a new concept for threat actors, allowing them to easily\nbypass network detection. To counter this threat, enterprises or teams within enterprises\nnowadays block or detect such Shadow IT services if they are not in official use, but individual or\nnon-enterprise users which may be targeted by state sponsored threat actors rarely have this\nluxury.\n\nThe full report detailing each event together with IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) and\nrecommendations is available to existing NSHC ThreatRecon customers.
