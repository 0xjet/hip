    "plain_text": "# The Evolution of Point-of-Sale (PoS) Malware\n\n**[trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-evolution-of-point-of-sale-pos-malware](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-evolution-of-point-of-sale-pos-malware)**\n\nIn 2014, we saw several data breach incidents where Point of sale (PoS) malware was used\nto hit organizations, institutions, and users. Since the bad guys naturally go where the money\nis, it's easy to see why cybercriminals target PoS terminals, given that they know the different\nplaces where credit cards are routinely used. As we have observed multiple PoS malware\n\n\n-----\n\nfamilies, it is important to learn that personal and sensitive information stolen from credit and\ndebit cards can be used to impersonate unsuspecting customers. This could result in\nfraudulent purchases, financial loss, and damaged credit standing.\n\nPoS malware has evolved rapidly over the past few years, targeting mostly big retail\ncompanies from which they could obtain large chunks of data as opposed to individual\nsources.\n\n## PoS Systems and Evolving Threats\n\nA PoS device is designed to complete transactions as it calculates the amount of purchases\nmade by a customer, as well as provide other operational information such as inventory\nmanagement, accounting, and tracking sales. PoS systems require a connection to a\nnetwork to validate payments by sellers. Small businesses may use a cellular data\nconnection, while bigger companies employ internal networks. Most PoS devices run on\nWindows and UNIX operating systems, making them easy to operate, maintain and develop\nsoftware for devices. However, this also means that malware could easily be developed to\ninfect these systems.\n\nIn the past, criminals devised physical skimmers to rub payment cards and steal data. This\nrequired the bad guys to be physically close to the PoS terminal and thus risked being found\nout. Today, cybercriminals resort to using malware for stealing data primarily from credit\ncards, and the malware used has continually evolved. As shown in the timeline below,\nthey've branched out into various malware families that target PoS devices. And where does\nall the stolen data go? They're either used for illegal purchases, or traded in underground\nmarkets.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How PoS Malware Works\n\nThe payment card industry complies with a set of security standards that enforce end-to-end\nencryption of sensitive payment data captured from payment cards during transactions.\nHowever, the data that can be found inside the PoS device memory could be in stored in an\nunencrypted form. Typical PoS RAM scraper malware captures the payment card information\ndirectly from the memory, where it scrapes customer data and information.\n\nWhile they all typically share a similar end-goal, the different PoS malware types are\ndesigned to do the deed in different ways. Here are some of the notable PoS malware types\nwe have reported on in the past few months:\n\n**Backoff – a successor of Alina (aka Track) whose variants are known for scanning all**\nrunning processes to retrieve card track data and gather affected system information,\n[Backoff, uses the same installation technique used in the Alina family of PoS RAM-scraping](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-212A)\n[malware. Based on our research, Backoff implements an updated data search function and](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-pos-malware-backoff-targets-us/)\ndrops a watchdog process to ensure that it continuously runs in the system. Discovered by\nthe US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT), this PoS malware targeted the\nUS. Interestingly, we saw a clear decrease of hits during “dead hours” specifically at 2:00\nAM, and an apparent recurring rise of hits at 10:00 AM. This trend follows regular business\noperation hours wherein PoS devices are more likely to be active and in use. Generally, the\nhits increase during business hours and decline during off-hours.\n\n**BlackPoS** **version 2.0 – this PoS malware clones the exfiltration technique that the**\nBlackPoS variant used to compromise US retailer Target. [BlackPoS version 2.0 pretends to](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-blackpos-malware-emerges-in-the-wild-targets-retail-accounts/)\nbe an antivirus product installed on a system to avoid user suspicion. Our researchers in\nTrend Micro found that the source code of the original BlackPoS was leaked, enabling other\ncybercriminals to enhance its code. According to our findings, this malware appears to have\nbeen used in the massive data breach that targeted Home Depot.\n\n**[Read:** **[Home Depot confirms breach, reported to be largest on record]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/home-depot-confirms-breach-of-us-and-canada-stores-reported-to-be-largest-in-record)**\n\n[In 2014 alone, PoS malware was used to hit several large retail companies in the US. In the](http://blog.trendmicro.com/target-breach-shows-need-create-secure-payment-systems/)\n[wake of these attacks, we also recently found a new PoS malware that emerged in time for](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-pos-malware-kicks-off-holiday-shopping-weekend/)\nthe holiday shopping weekend. Called GetMyPass, this new PoS malware is dependent on\nits configuration file, which means that it was designed to be flexible. Based on other PoS\nmalware routines we analyzed, GetMyPass appears to be designed as a multicomponent\nmalware similar to an earlier BlackPoS variant. We continue to monitor this malware as it\ndevelops.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n## Defending Against PoS Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nPoS malware attacks continue to be prevalent, as shown by new malware families that have\nbeen recently discovered. As such, we have brought together some recommendations for\nboth companies and their customers to protect against such attacks.\n\nSince most attacks target mostly [retail and hospitality industries, it is critical for merchants to](https://www.trendmicro.com.ph/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-pos-system-breaches.pdf)\ntake these preventive measures:\n\nSecure PoS devices and networks\nComply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) security guidelines\nStrengthen anti-malware security\nDeploy patches accordingly\n\nCustomers must also take some steps to ensure that their accounts are not at risk:\n\nCheck your bank and credit statements.
