The people behind the attacks are likely\nattempting to gain access to computers where banking transactions are performed, in order\nto steal banking credentials.\n\nBy examining the global detections from Symantec endpoint products for the past two\nmonths, we can confirm that W32.Extrat infections are more prevalent in Colombia than in\nany other region.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Top five regions reporting W32.Extrat infections_\n\nWe combined email data from Symantec.cloud with telemetry from Symantec endpoint\nproducts to cluster together attack activity. Through our analysis, we identified what appear\nto be distinct sets of attackers. Over 2015, at least four main groups have been sending\nemails with W32.Extrat attachments in order to compromise Colombia-based targets. We\nalso found that there are other smaller groups actively distributing this threat in emails.\n[Similar uses of W32.Extrat have been documented in the past.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/02/xtremerat-nuisance-or-threat.html)\n\nSymantec calls the four attack teams Caramel, Cuent, Maga, and Molotos. During our\nresearch, we grouped clusters of activity according to the attackers’ command-and-control\n(C&C) domains. It is possible that some of these clusters are actually related to each other.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Number of computers infected with W32.Extrat per attack group for one month_\n\nThe attack groups generally use similar email subjects in their W32.Extrat campaigns.\n\n**Subject** **Group**\n\nNOTIFICACION FOTO COMPARENDO Caramel\n\nFORMATO CORRECTO TERCERA CITACION AUDIENCIA PUBLICA Caramel\n\nCITACION AUDIENCIA PUBLICA DENUNCIA CIVIL Caramel\n\nDetalles Informacion Cuent\n\nInformacion Detallada Cuent\n\nDemanda Asignada Cuent\n\nEstado de cuenta Cuent\n\nJuzgado Citacion Cuent\n\nCobro Juridico Cuent\n\nCitacion Juzgado Cuent\n\nQuiero que todos vean este archivo Cuent\n\nQuiero que vean este archivo Cuent\n\nCarta De Cobro Cuent\n\nRecibos En Mora Cuent\n\nProceso En Mora Cuent\n\nEstado De Cuenta Maga\n\n\n-----\n\n**Subject** **Group**\n\nSoporte de Consignacion Maga\n\nCOBRO JURIDICO Maga\n\nCuenta de Cobro Maga\n\nVinculados Por Corrupcion Maga\n\nNIT SUSPENDIDO Molotos\n\nSoporte de Consignacion Molotos\n\nSuspencion de la Inscripcion en el Registro Unico Tributario Molotos\n\nInvitacion a pagar de manera urgente sus Obligaciones Molotos\n\n_Table 1. W32.Extrat email subjects per attack group_\n\nThe email subjects usually have a legal connotation or are related to payments and tax. The\ncontents of the messages continue with these themes and appear as legitimate emails. One\nexample email was sent from what appeared to be a compromised email account and its\nsubject matter was relevant to the recipient organization’s industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. An example of a malicious email with a W32.Extrat attachment, which was sent_\n_from a compromised account_\n\nIt is likely that the various attackers are based in Colombia, as they consistently use\nColombian IP addresses for command and control. All of the attackers use dynamic DNS\ndomains for their C&C infrastructure. These dynamic DNS domains resolve to IP addresses\nthat are assigned to internet service providers (ISPs), not hosting facilities.\n\nThe lifespan of the IP addresses reflect these findings. The majority of the attackers’\ndomains change to a new IP address in 24-hour periods, with some lasting from three to\nfour days.\n\nSome example hashes and domains for each group are listed in the following table.\n\n**MD5** **C&C domain** **Group**\n\n084299bef9f83f42b9281c9c6155a4f3 auxilio.duckdns.org Maga\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **C&C domain** **Group**\n\n8fef5053d9d96637ccc26c452aaf73dc magalyamaya.mooo.com Maga\n\n516186e260d8cba116a470efcf84cf34 caramelochpetinnew2.ddns.net Caramel\n\n00adadf595c062ebaaa05a1c23a1c13a cuentadns.mooo.com Cuent\n\n0f0d4493705264ddcc337f22abe50266 yiyik13.no-ip.biz Cuent\n\n629725ca22c9b2bcfb086d4593214e01 molotos4.no-ip.biz Molotos\n\n_Table 2. MD5 hashes of samples and domains per group_\n\n**Mitigation**\nAttacks targeting the financial departments of businesses are a regular occurrence. The\napproaches that the attackers take include emails with malicious attachments, phishing\nattacks claiming to be from senior management, and social engineering involving phone\ncalls. Employees should take the following precautions to prevent these campaigns from\nsucceeding:\n\nDo not open attachments or click on links in suspicious email messages\nAvoid providing any personal information when answering an email\nNever enter personal information in a pop-up web page\nKeep security software up to date\nIf you’re uncertain about an email’s legitimacy, contact your internal IT department or\n[submit the email to Symantec Security Response through this portal.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/submitsamples.jsp)\n\n**Protection**\nA full protection stack helps to defend against these attacks, including Symantec.cloud\nemail blocking, web gateway security, and endpoint security.\nSymantec and Norton products detect the payload of these attacks through the following\ndetections:\n\n**AV**\n\n[W32.Extrat](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-111221-3742-99)\n\n**IPS**\n\n\n-----",
