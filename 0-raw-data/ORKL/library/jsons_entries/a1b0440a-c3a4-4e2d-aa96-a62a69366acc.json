    "plain_text": "# Access Brokers: Their Targets and Their Worth\n\n**crowdstrike.com/blog/access-brokers-targets-and-worth/**\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence Team February 23, 2022\n\nAccess brokers have become a key component of the eCrime threat landscape, selling\naccess to threat actors and facilitating myriad criminal activities. Many have established\n[relationships with big game hunting (BGH) ransomware operators and affiliates of prolific](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-on-the-rise-again-according-to-ecrime-index/)\n[ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) programs. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team analyzed](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\nthe multitude of access brokers’ advertisements posted since 2019 and identified trends in\ntargeting preferences, as well as insights into the perceived value of different victims.\n\n## Top Targets\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAccess brokers have advertised organizations from more than 30 different sectors,\ndemonstrating an eclectic range of targets. Among these, the academic, government and\ntechnology sectors were the most frequently advertised, accounting for a combined 49% of\nthe total advertisements.\n\n[The academic sector has historically been a popular focus of ransomware operations, with](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\nintrusions timed to coincide with the start of a new school term to cause the greatest\ndisruption and in turn encourage a quick ransom payment. Almost 40% of the academic\nsector advertisements were for access to U.S.-based institutions, with a spike in activity\nnoted in August 2021 that coincides with the start of the new semester.\n\nGeographically, advertisements for access to U.S.-based entities far surpass those for all\nother countries, claiming 55% of the total. Organizations based in Brazil and the UK secure\nsecond and third spots with 8% and 7%, respectively.\n\nThis geographic targeting trend corresponds with other eCrime activity, including data theft\ncampaigns that frequently result in stolen credentials being traded online in criminal\nunderground marketplaces. Access brokers are known to purchase such credentials and\n\n\n-----\n\nabuse them to acquire access.\n\n## Controversial Targets\n\nThe healthcare sector has been a divisive target among eCrime actors during the past two\nyears because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some adversaries actively avoided operations\nagainst frontline services in particular. Access brokers showed varying interest in targeting\nthe sector — it sits in joint fourth place alongside financial services for the total number of\nidentified advertisements, but the timing of the advertisements fluctuated.\n\nOnly one advertisement was posted for a healthcare entity in Q1 2020 — coinciding with the\nemergence of the pandemic — yet several were posted in Q3 2020 and Q1 2021. The\nincrease corresponded with news of successful vaccination programs, potentially prompting\nincreased interest among eCrime adversaries. Law enforcement scrutiny of cybercrime\ntargeting critical infrastructure, which includes healthcare, also likely impacted supply and\ndemand for access to this sector.\n\nThe energy sector was another controversial target in 2021. The fallout from the Darkside\n[ransomware incident against Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 had a knock-on effect on access](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-ransomware-adversaries-reacted-to-the-darkside-pipeline-attack/)\nbrokers, as criminal forum moderators imposed restrictions on ransomware-related\ndiscussions. Since ransomware operators account for a high proportion of access brokers’\ncustomer base, the ban likely impacted sales for some brokers. Many switched to private\ncommunication channels, selling only to trusted buyers and hindering efforts to track who\nwas selling to whom.\n\nDespite the Colonial Pipeline incident prompting these changes, demand for access to the\nenergy sector never truly waned, though the asking price for access briefly dipped.\n\n## What Is Access Worth?\n\nSeveral factors determine the worth of access, and asking prices vary significantly among\nsectors, countries and access brokers. Access with elevated privileges typically attracts a\nhigher asking price, as does access to large corporations with higher annual revenues or\nadvertisements by more-established access brokers. Some brokers auction the access,\noffering a “buy-it-now” price or attempting to encourage a bidding war.\n\nThe sectors attracting the highest average asking price for access were government,\nfinancial services, and industrial and engineering organizations. The most advertised sector\ndoes not necessarily attract the highest asking price; for example, access to the academic\nsector was, on average, priced at $3,827 USD. In comparison, the government sector —\nwhich was the second most advertised — attracted an average asking price of $6,151 USD.\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations based in the U.S., the UK, and Canada on average attracted higher asking\nprices than other countries, reflecting the demand in targeting these locations. It is worth\nnoting that the advertised price is not necessarily what’s paid, and the majority of access\nbrokers appear open to negotiation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFluctuations in asking prices are also common and often reactive to the market. CrowdStrike\n[reported an increase in asking price among access brokers in April 2021, with some](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/increasing-relevance-of-access-broker-market-shown-in-improved-ecx-model/)\ncorporate entities attracting five-figure sums, indicating that threat actors likely receive a\nsignificant return on their investment. When the same access is being advertised by two\ndifferent access brokers, variations in the asking price are also observed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe advertisements provide an interesting snapshot of an increasingly lucrative component\n[of the eCrime ecosystem, where reputation and timing both play important roles. There is](https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/global-threat-report-highlights-ecrime-trends-and-nation-state-activity/)\nalmost certainly an opportunistic element to access broker operations, such as the\navailability of exploitable vulnerabilities or the validity of stolen credentials that facilitate\nintrusions.\n\nThe fallout from the Colonial Pipeline incident and its impact on access brokers’ sales\nappears to have been short lived, as in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 CrowdStrike Intelligence has\nwitnessed a resurgence in advertisements and the emergence of new brokers. Purchasing\naccess saves time and resources for many eCrime adversaries, and the demand for these is\nalmost certain to remain high throughout 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Falcon X Recon, CrowdStrike s digital risk protection solution, goes beyond the dark web to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/threat-intelligence/falcon-x-recon/)\ninclude forums with restricted access on the deep web, breach data and messaging apps —\nall resources commonly used by access brokers to trade or advertise.
