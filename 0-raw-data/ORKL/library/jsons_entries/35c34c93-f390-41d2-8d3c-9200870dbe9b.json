The malicious emails seem to be replying to already existing email chains, with\nthe addition of an attached .zip file (Figure 1). The .zip files are not password protected. The\nthemes of the attached files include finances and invoices.\n\n_Figure 1: Sample Emotet email with attached .zip file._\n\nThe .zip files attached to these recent Emotet emails contain an Office Document with\nmacros (Figure 2). Once opened, the user is prompted to “Enable Content”, which will allow\nthe malicious macros to run. The macros will download an Emotet .dll from an external site\nand execute it locally on the machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Office document with macros to download and execute Emotet._\n\nIt is unclear how long this round of email activity will last. While an earlier round of activity in\n2022 extended across multiple weeks, the last round occurred over less than two weeks in\nNovember 2022, with more than three months of inactivity on either side.\n\n\n-----",
