    "plain_text": "# GIMMICK Malware Attacks macOS to Attack Organizations Across Asia\n\n**cybersecuritynews.com/gimmick-malware-attacks/**\n\nGuru March 24, 2022\n\nAn espionage threat actor from China known for attacking target organizations across Asia\nhas been linked to a new malware implant for macOS devices.\n\nAs Volexity’s Network Security Monitoring service monitored an environment late in 2021, it\ndetected an intrusion. Cybersecurity firm Volexity believes the group responsible for the\nattacks is called Storm Cloud while describing the malware as “GIMMICK.”\n\nIn an intrusion campaign, the data was recovered from a compromised MacBook Pro running\nmacOS 11.6 (Big Sur) through memory analysis. Apart from this, several instances of the\nmalware family have been encountered by Volexity.\n\nFor commands and controls (C2) GIMMICK uses Google Drive, a public cloud hosting\nservice since GIMMICK is a multi-platform malware.\n\n## GIMMICK Malware (macOS Variant)\n\nWindows versions are written in both .NET and Delphi, while the newly identified macOS\nvariant, GIMMICK is written mostly in Objective C.\n\n\n-----\n\nVolexity tracks the malware under the same name, regardless of the programming\nlanguages used and the operating systems targeted. However, this happened due to the\nfollowing factors:\nShared C2 architecture.\nFile paths.\nBehavioral patterns used by all variants.\n\nVolexity researchers Damien Cash, Steven Adair, and Thomas Lancaster stated:\n“Storm Cloud is an advanced and versatile threat actor, adapting its toolset to match different\noperating systems used by its targets.”\n\nIn order to integrate with Target’s network traffic, GIMMICK communicates with its Google\nDrive-powered C2 server only during working hours and days. While as part of Volexity’s\nwork with Apple, all users now have protection against GIMMICK malware.\n\n### Startup & Initialization\n\nAfter the implementation of GIMMICK malware on the infected system, GIMMICK can run\neither as an ‘application’ or as a ‘daemon’ and is designed to mimic the behavior of a\nprogram commonly used by the user-targeted.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm, Volexity has observed that in the Windows variant of GIMMICK\nmalware there is no concept of setting its own persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to blend in with the network traffic in the target environment, GIMMICK only\ncommunicates with its Google Drive C2 server on working days. A JSON object with OAuth2\ncredentials for accessing Google Drive is retrieved from the first decoding loop.\n\nSecond, the 32-byte string is decoded, which is then run through a third-party conversion\nstage. After decoding the 32-byte string, two characters are converted to numeric\nrepresentations at a time, and the resulting byte is written to a buffer.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of the final decoding, the configuration data is a 200byte binary blob that only\nshows a few overlapping data boundaries.\n\nIn addition, the backdoor has its own uninstall feature that allows it to remove itself from the\ncompromised machine, in addition to retrieving arbitrary files and executing commands from\nthe C2 server.\n\n**Custom ObjectiveC classes of GIMMICK**\n\nThere are three custom Objective-C classes of GIMMICK malware, and here below we have\nmentioned them all:\nDriveManager\nFileManager\nGCDTimerManager\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo prevent similar attacks Volexity has recommended the following mitigations:\nAlways audit and monitor the persistence locations.\nTo keep track of anomalous proxy activity and internal scanning always monitor\nnetwork traffic.\nOn macOS, systems make sure to enable XProtect and MRT from Apple.\nAlways use complex passwords.\nMake sure to enable a multi-factor security mechanism.\n\n\n-----",
