spyware\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iphones-running-latest-ios-hacked-to-deploy-nso-group-spyware/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iphones-running-latest-ios-hacked-to-deploy-nso-group-spyware/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJuly 19, 2021\n05:03 AM\n2\n\nHuman rights non-governmental organization Amnesty International and non-profit project\nForbidden Stories revealed in a recent report that they found spyware made by Israeli\nsurveillance firm NSO Group deployed on iPhones running Apple's latest iOS release,\nhacked using zero-day zero-click iMessage exploits.\n\n\"Amnesty International has observed evidence of compromise of the iPhone XR of an\nIndian journalist (CODE INJRN1) running iOS 14.6 (latest available at the time of writing) as\n[recently as 16th June 2021,\" the report reads.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\n\n\"Lastly, Amnesty International has confirmed an active infection of the iPhone X of an\nactivist (CODE RWHRD1) on June 24th 2021, also running iOS 14.6.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost recently, a successful zero-click attack has been observed exploiting multiple zerodays to attack a fully patched iPhone 12 running iOS 14.6 in July 2021.\"\n\nThe NGO also sad that it reported this information to Apple, who said that they are\ninvestigating the matter.\n\n\"Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop,\noften have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals,\" Ivan Krstić, head of\n[Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, told The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/)\n\n\"While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we\ncontinue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new\nprotections for their devices and data.\"\n\n_[Countries where journalists were targeted with spyware (Forbidden Stories)](https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-the-new-global-weapon-for-silencing-journalists/)_\n\n## Findings confirmed by Citizen Lab's peer review\n\n[Bill Marczak, a research fellow at academic research lab Citizen Lab, also revealed that an](https://twitter.com/billmarczak/status/1416801514685796352)\n[independent peer review of Amnesty's report said that the forensic methodology is sound](https://twitter.com/citizenlab/status/1416799718949244932)\nand led to additional evidence supporting the report's findings.\n\nCitizen Lab was able to independently observe NSO Pegasus spyware deployed on an\niPhone 12 Pro Max running iOS 14.6 (the OS's latest release), hacked via a zero-day zeroclick iMessage exploit, which does not require interaction from the target.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe researchers also discovered zero-click iMessage attacks that led to Pegasus being\ninstalled on an iPhone SE2 phone running iOS version 14.4 and an iPhone SE2 device\nrunning iOS 14.0.1.\n\n\"The mechanics of the zero-click exploit for iOS 14.x appear to be substantially different\nthan the KISMET exploit for iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7, suggesting that it is in fact a different\nzero-click iMessage exploit,\" Citizen Lab added.\n\nPegasus is a spyware tool developed by NSO Group and marketed as a surveillance tool\n\"licensed to legitimate government agencies for the sole purpose of investigating crime and\nterror.\"\n\n\"These most recent discoveries indicate NSO Group's customers are currently able to\nremotely compromise all recent iPhone models and versions of iOS,\" Amnesty International\nand Forbidden Stories said in their report.\n\nIt also indicates that Apple has a MAJOR blinking red five-alarm-fire problem with\niMessage security that their BlastDoor Framework (introduced in iOS 14 to make\nzero-click exploitation more difficult) ain't solving.\n\n[— Bill Marczak (@billmarczak) July 18,

documenting NSO Group's Pegasus\nspyware being used to spy on human rights defenders (HRDs) and journalists worldwide.\n\nFor instance, two years ago, [Facebook sued Israeli cyber-surveillance firm NSO Group and](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030051115/https://faq.whatsapp.com/help/video-calling-cyber-attack)\nits parent company for creating and selling a WhatsApp zero-day exploit.\n\nThe zero-day exploit was later used to hack and infect the devices of high-profile targets\nsuch as government officials, diplomats, and journalists with spyware.\n\n[Researchers at Citizen Lab revealed in 2018 that they found some Pegasus licensees using](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/)\nit actively for cross-border surveillance and in countries with a history of abusive behavior\nby state security services.\n\n[In collaboration with Microsoft, Citizen Lab also reported last week that they found links](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-israeli-firm-used-windows-zero-days-to-deploy-spyware/)\nbetween another Israeli surveillance firm known as Candiru to new Windows spyware\ndubbed DevilsTongue deployed on targets' computers via now patched Windows zero-day\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\"Candiru is a secretive Israel-based company that sells spyware exclusively to\ngovernments,\" Citizen Lab said. \"Reportedly, their spyware can infect and monitor iPhones,\nAndroids, Macs, PCs, and cloud accounts.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft researchers discovered at least 100 victims in Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon,\nYemen, Spain, United Kingdom, Turkey, Armenia, and Singapore,\" with the list of victims\nincluding \"politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and\npolitical dissidents.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Newly found zero-click iPhone exploit used in NSO spyware
