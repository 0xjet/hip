The report includes summary of victimized firms, Top 5 targeted countries\nand industrial sectors, status of dark web forum posts by ransomware operators, etc.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nCompared to SoW 5 months ago (W1 Jan), the number of victimized firms increased\nby about 2.6 times, and the ransomware threat groups increased by 1.6 times,\nrequiring attention to ransomware attacks.\nThe United States was mostly positioned at top in terms of the rate of victim infection,\nbut as the number of active ransomware threat groups increased, the percentage of\nvictimized firms’ country locations also varied.\nUsers who worked as affiliate partners with Darkside (as a pentester) claiming to the\nadmin of XSS forum as Darkside did not pay their portion properly, which accepted and\npermanently suspended the Darkside account.\nBabuk ransomware rebranded as Payload Bin and their first victim was CD PROJEKT.\nThe CD PROJEKT’s source code leak is an incident found to be related to HelloKitty\nransomware as Babuk ransomware announced last week planning to integrate a\nplatform by gathering ransomware partners who did not operate their own data leak\nsite.\n\n## 1. Weekly Status\n\n A. Status of the victimized firms (5/24 ~ 5/30)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFor a week, a total of 80 victimized firms were mentioned and a change in the state of\nthe data leaked from the victims in the ransomware site was detected.\n11 threat groups’ activities were detected.\nCompared to previous statistics 5 months ago, the number of victims increased by\nabout 2.6 times, and the ransomware threat groups increased by 1.6 times that needs\nto raise awareness about ransomware attacks.\n\n[Link to W1 Jan | EN | Story of the Week: Ransomware on the Darkweb](https://medium.com/s2wlab/story-of-the-week-ransomware-on-the-darkweb-w1-jan-739c62424f2a)\n\n\n-----\n\n## B. TOP 5 targeted countries\n\nThe United States was mostly positioned at top in terms of the rate of victim infection, but as\nthe number of active ransomware threat groups increased, the percentage of victimized\nfirms’ country locations also varied.\n\n1. United States — 26.3%\n2. Germany — 11.3%\n3. France — 8.8%\n4. United Kingdom — 5.0%\n5. Norway — 3.8%\n\n## C. TOP 5 targeted industrial sectors\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Manufacturer — 18.8%\n2. industrial — 11.3%\n3. Education — 8.8%\n4. Financial & Consultancy & Service — 6.3%\n5. Health Care & Store & Real estate — 5.0%\n\n## 2. Posts related to Ransomware threat actors @Dark Web\n\n A. Darkside permanently banned from XSS forum\n\nOn May 14th, the user (qwety1) of the XSS Forum claimed to the admin that the user did not\nreceive any amount working as a pentester participating with the affiliate program of\nDarkSide Ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe administrator of the XSS Forum mentioned they begin the procedure for paying\ncompensation with the rule of XSS Forum as below.\n```\nreturn to the victims occurs from the balance, dividing proportionally between the\nvictims in a% ratio. Consideration of the return process takes place directly in\nblack, within 7 days .\n\n```\nThe administrator started reviewing proofs for 6 asserting users of participated in Darkside\nransomware affiliate program. After that, 3 users were confirmed and compensated its loss\nby admin.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nXSS.IS adminThanks to all. The question is closed.darksupp(Darkside ransomware s\nOperator) - the status is set. But I want to emphasize that the status is set purely\non a formal basis.Appeared faded> there was a \"cut\" of the deposit> the status is\nset. This is the observance of the procedure, nothing more.Since I do not know\nanything, I am not ready to take responsibility for any loud statements and will not\nhang labels.My job is just to follow the rules honestly, clearly and correctly.\n\n```\nAs a consequence, Darkside is banned by administrator violating the forum policy as a\nscammer.\n\n## B. Babuk ransomware rebranded as Payload[.]bin\n\n[Link to W4 May | EN | Story of the Week: Ransomware on the Darkweb](https://medium.com/s2wlab/w4-may-en-story-of-the-week-ransomware-on-the-darkweb-5f5b8d4c3b6f)\n\n\n-----\n\nLast week, we covered a post where the Babuk ransomware launch an integrated platform\ngathering partners who don’t have a data leak site, and operate them instead. On May 31,\nthe Babuk ransomware rebranded as Payload Bin and re-organised the homepage.\n\nAll leaks data previously disclosed by the Babuk ransomware disappeared with renewal but\nCD Projekt’s source code data. The CD PROJEKT’s source code leak is an incident found to\nbe related to HelloKitty ransomware on Feb 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware damage announced by CD Projekt\n\n\n-----\n\nRansom note released by CD Projekt via Twitter\n\nAfter the announcement, there was a user looking for the leaked data regarding CD Projekt’s\nincident.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, there wasn’t any free sharing page on DDW, rather a seller appeared trying to sell\nthe source code of CD Projekt on DDW as a form of auction.\n\nAs Babuk announced, the data appears to be CD Projekt’s data which was stolen by\nHelloKitty ransomware regarding previous incident, and they seem to be partnered with\nBabuk ransomware now rebranded as Payload Bin.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe number of victims mentioned on data leak site operated by ransomware is rapidly\nincreasing compared to 5 months ago, so it needs to be vigilant\nBabuk ransomware rebranded as Payload Bin, appears to strengthen its strategy of\nthreatening victims by focusing on exfiltrating the data by partnering with the previously\nactive ransomware groups who did not have their own data leak page.\n\n\n-----",
