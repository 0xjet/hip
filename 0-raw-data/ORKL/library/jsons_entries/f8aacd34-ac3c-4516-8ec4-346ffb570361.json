Upon running\nthe script file with the VBS extension, the malware runs the innocuous PDF file that exists\ninternally to trick the user into thinking that they opened an innocuous document file and\nuses a malicious DLL file to leak information. Taking PDF file into consideration, it seems the\nattacker is targeting precise-refinement industries. See the figure below for details of PDF\nfile.\n\nFilename: Application receipt-Small business technology innovation and development\nproject_Market expansion_Green conversion_S???????.pdf.vbs\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Innocuous PDF file used as bait\nThe team presumes this to be the work of the Kimsuky group due to the following evidence.\n\nMalware is run via ‘regsvr32.exe’ similar to the existing [AppleSeed](https://download.ahnlab.com/global/brochure/Analysis%20Report%20of%20Kimsuky%20Group.pdf)\nkro.kr domain, known to be used by Kimsuky, is used as C&C\nWhen relaying attacker’s commands, commands such as tasklist, net user, and\nsysteminfo are run\n\nThe attacker also added ‘.pdf’ in front of the extension to trick users. For many ordinary\nusers, ‘Hide extensions for known file types’ is enabled by default (see Figure 2), resulting in\nthe users mistaking the file for a PDF file even though it is a VBS file. Ultimately, when the\nuser runs the VBS, a malicious activity commences in parallel with the execution of the PDF\nfile.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Feature of hiding file extension\nThe malicious VBS creates and runs the innocuous PDF file in the path where the VBS was\nrun, and Base64-encoded DLL in the path ‘C:\\ProgramData’. The filename of the DLL\ncreated by the internal code is random as shown below.\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\tewl8.aqdzkz\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\ltbpq.brv5la\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\ihjq6.xvcdkk\n\nThe malicious DLL that is run at the end creates the cmd.exe process and waits for the pipe\ncommunication with the C&C server. The confirmed attacker commands during the standby\nare as follows.\n\nsysteminfo command\ntasklist command\nwhoami command\nnet user command\n\nAhnLab is continuously monitoring and responding to such APT attacks, and users must\ndisable ‘Hide extensions for known file types’ that is enabled by default (see Figure 2) to\nprevent being tricked by such a technique.\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, is currently detecting and blocking the files using the\nfollowing aliases.\n\n**[IOC]**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[MD5]**\n– Innocuous PDF file: b3c7df17420d48f61bbfcf2bac3ae4a3\n– VBS file: 64cbd6f435538175dc06ea4b84cba46d\n– Final DLL (backdoor): 856072827cec7b74ead3ce40e55bd8d1\n– DLL created by VBS: 3ea9b50289aecccc7ffd04fa814c1a5c\n\n[Detection Name (Engine version)]\n– VBS file: Dropper/VBS.Akdoor (2022.03.24.00)\n– Final DLL (backdoor): Trojan/Win.Kimsuky.C5025515 (2022.03.24.00)\n– DLL created by VBS: Trojan/Win.Kimsuky.C5025516 (2022.03.24.00)\n\n**[C&C]**\n– hxxps://regular.winupdate.kro.kr/index.php\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information/)\n\n[Tagged as:APT,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/apt-en/) [Kimsuky](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/kimsuky-en/)\n\n\n-----",
