In these](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/08/05/compromised-youtube-accounts-spreading-malware/)\ntypes of campaigns, the Threat Actor (TA) usually hosts the malicious file in the free file hosting platform.\n\nStill, in this case, the TA has created phishing pages mimicking legitimate websites that provide service to\nusers for downloading various software, games, and other tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoing through the different campaigns, we identified several phishing websites mentioned in the video\ndescription. The TA has created phishing pages to increase the chances of successful infection. Also, the\nimpact of this campaign can be calculated based on the number of views on each video posted. The\nmaximum number of views we observed on a single video is 18k, indicating the campaign is widespread.\n\nFigure 1 – Views on Videos\nThe below image depicts the comments in the YouTube videos. Similar comments from different YouTube\nvideos conclude that the TA adds these to convince users to think this software is legitimate.\n\nFigure 2 – Comments in the Videos\n\n## YouTube Campaigns Analysis:\n\nDuring our research, we observed that the TA responsible for running these campaigns primarily targets\npeople looking to get paid software for free such as games, programs, etc. To get this software for free,\npeople usually search keywords like “software cracks,” “keygens,” etc. The search result of these keywords\nredirects users to these YouTube videos, guiding them to install malicious executables pretending to be the\nsoftware they wanted to install.\n\n## Campaign 1\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below image depicts a website hosted on the URL: hxxps://teensoft[.]org/, which is being used by the\n[YouTube video campaign to deliver Info stealer.

The website targets more than 100 applications that\ncome under the categories of games, crack software, plugins, Roblox scripts, and cheats to lure users into\ninstalling info stealers on the user’s machine. These websites deliver RecordBreaker stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Website Delivering RecordBreaker Stealer\n\n## Campaign 4\n\nThe figure below showcases a website hosted on the URL: hxxps://appshigha[.]com/, which is used by the\nmalicious YouTube video campaign to deliver malicious programs.\n\nOn the website, software such as Sapphire Plugin, Twixtor Plugin, Valorant Hack, GTA Online Mod Menu,\nMS Office, CCleaner PRO, and AutoCAD are listed and available for download. When the users try to\ndownload the software, a payload of RecordBreaker stealer is executed silently in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Website Delivering RecordBreaker Stealer\nThe below table shows the list of software targeted by the TAs to deliver stealers.\n\nWondershare Filmora Driver Booster PRO CCleaner Professional FL Studio\n\niCloud Bypass iOS 15 Lumion 12 Pro Sketchup Bandicam\n\nVoicemod Pro Sony Vegas Pro 19 AutoCAD 3ds Max\n\nAdobe Illustrator Adobe XD Adobe After Effects Adobe Photoshop\n\nAdobe Acrobat Adobe InDesign DaVinci Resolve Movavi Video Editor\n\nAbleton Live\n\nThe below table shows the list of gaming software the TA claims to deliver for free to infect users.\n\n\nValorant Hack GTA Online Mod\nMenu\n\n\nFortnite Hack Fortnite Skin Changer Genshin Impact\nHack\n\n\nWarzone Hack Rust Hack Spider-Man\nRemastered\n\n\nSynapse X Hack NBA 2K23\n\n\nMarvel’s\nSpider-Man\n\nWanderer\nDownload\n\nMonster\nHunter Rise\n\n\nF1 Manager Saints Row Elden Ring Dying Light 2\n\n\nExpeditions\nRome\n\nThe Kids We\nWere\n\n\nBlackwind\nDownload\n\n\nTom Clancy’s Rainbow Six\nExtraction\n\n\nAery –\nDreamscape\n\n\nGod of War Weird West Far Cry 6\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below table shows the list of ROBLOX scripts targeted by the YouTube campaign.

The malware infection happens in multiple stages and at the end, executes the stealer payload.\nThese stealers mainly exfiltrate sensitive user data such as cookies, system information, login credentials,\netc. to their Command and Control (C&C) server.\n\nThis exfiltrated data is referred to as Stealer Logs, which are usually sold on cybercrime marketplaces and\ncan be leveraged by other TAs to target individuals or get into corporate networks. The phishing campaign\ndiscussed in this blog was mainly distributing Vidar and RecordBreaker stealer.\n\n### Vidar Stealer\n\nVidar InfoStealer is based on C/C++ programming language. The Vidar malware family, which was first\nidentified in 2018, can steal sensitive data from the victim’s PC. This includes banking information, saved\npasswords, IP addresses, browser history, login credentials, and crypto wallets, which can then be\ntransferred to the TAs Command and C&C. We witnessed in past also where TAs used delivery\nmechanisms such as spam mail, cracked software, keygens, etc. to distribute this malware.\n\n### RecordBreaker Stealer\n\n[RecordBreaker stealer is suspected to be a recent version of the Raccoon stealer, which was spotted in](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/10/21/raccoon-stealer-under-the-lens-a-deep-dive-analysis/)\nthe wild in 2022. While executing, this stealer performs several GET\\POST requests with Command and\nControl (C&C) Server. Initially, it fetches the configuration and DLLs and then exfiltrates the victim’s data to\nC&C using a POST request. The stealer can also deliver other malware payloads based on the\nconfiguration’s settings. The figure below shows the stealer receiving configuration file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7\nRecordBreaker Configuration File\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat Actors are constantly enhancing their techniques to deliver malicious programs. In this particular\ncase, the TA uses YouTube channels to spread malicious payloads hosted on phishing websites. This\ncampaign primarily leverages YouTube videos (with step-by-step tutorials) to trick users into installing\nmalicious programs on their systems. CRIL has been observing increasing trends in social media scams of\nlate.\n\nCyble Research and Intelligence Labs’ mission is to continuously monitor and alert our audience to hightech cyber scams and protect our clients in cyberspace by supporting them in achieving their goals.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers.
