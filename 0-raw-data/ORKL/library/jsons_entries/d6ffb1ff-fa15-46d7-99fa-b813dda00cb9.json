The attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations.\nThe objective of the attacks is clearly espionage – they involve gaining access to top\nlegislative, executive and judicial bodies around the world.\n\n1. The attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017,\n\nwith the main focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine.\nHigh-profile organizations have also been targeted in other regions. The number of\nattacks has decreased since the beginning of 2018.\n2. The attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted\n\npolitical figures in the MENA region. At first the attacks looked to be the work of the\n[low-sophistication Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), but further analysis painted a](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-updated-2017-activity/82765/)\nvery different picture.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Targets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and\n\nofficials, political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media\noutlets, research centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading\ncompanies, and other unknown entities.\n4. The malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers,\n\nenabling them to execute any scripts/commands and receive the result via HTTP\nrequests.\n[5. Kaspersky Lab users and Threat Management and Defense clients are protected from](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-management-defense-solution)\n\nthe attacks.\n\n[Cisco Talos recently published a blogpost describing targeted attacks in the Middle East](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/targeted-attacks-in-middle-east.html)\nregion which we believe may be connected.\n\n## Victimology and Statistics\n\nBased on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown\ngeopolitically motivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing\njust enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when\nneeded and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive\norganizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The\nvictim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain\ncontroller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those\nresponsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.\n\nVictims have been spotted in the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi\nArabia, Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada,\nthe USA, the UK, Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea\nand Denmark.\n\n**Victim organization type** **Number of victim organizations**\n\nUnknown 91\n\nSenates/Parliaments 7\n\nPrime Ministerial Offices 3\n\nMilitary/Intelligence Agencies 5\n\nOther Gov./Ministerial/Diplomatic Offices 20\n\nFinancial/Banking Institutions 5\n\nMedia Outlets 2\n\nOlympic/Sports Bodies 2\n\n\n-----\n\nResearch Centers/Scholars 2\n\nElection Commissions 1\n\nDistribution/Logistics 1\n\nThe number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn’t represent the full scope of the\nattacks – only a portion.\n\n## Attack description and attribution\n\nOperation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle\nEast region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another\nattack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before\nproceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting\nseems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the\ndesired data or access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously\n[seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an](https://securelist.com/the-desert-falcons-targeted-attacks/68817/)\nelaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical\nand/or digital).\n\n\n-----\n\nWith deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a\nhard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such\nas the Middle East.\n\nSee the following for more information and examples of false flags being used in\ncyberattacks:\n\n[Wave your false flags! …or the Nightmares and Nuances of a Self-Aware Attribution Space](https://securelist.com/wave-your-false-flags/76273/)\n\n[OlympicDestroyer is here to trick the industry](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/)\n\n## Malware description\n\nThe malware was first seen packed with VMProtect; when unpacked the sample didn’t show\nany similarities with previously known malware. All the strings and settings were encrypted\nand obfuscated. Functionality was identified that enables HTTP communication with the C&C\nserver and invokes “processcreate” based on parameters received as a response.\n\nThe configuration and strings are encrypted using 3DES and Base64 encoding. Data sent to\nthe C&C server is also encrypted using 3DES and Base64. Different keys are used for local\nand network encryption.\n\nThe malware starts communicating with the C&C server by sending basic information about\nthe infected machine. The C&C server then replies with the encrypted serialized\nconfiguration.\n\nThe malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers,\nenabling them to execute scripts/commands and receive the results via HTTP requests.\n\n_Sample of the C&C response with encrypted commands and configurations_\n\n## Examples of attack decoys\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: Contacts list of media personnel_\n\n_Translation: Relations between UAE and Jordan, and the impact caused by the non-boycott of Qatar_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: Military retirement statement 2017 June_\n\n_Translation: The new Hamas structure for Gaza strip 2017_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Translation: Clarification report (on Gaza employee salaries)_\n\n## What should high-profile organizations do?\n\nHigh-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity. Attacks against them\nare inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease. These organizations need to pay particular\nattention to their security, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well\nprotected. Anti-targeted attack solutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data flows,\ndefault-deny application lockdown, endpoint detection and response, data leak and insider\nthreat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped networks should form the basis of any\nstrategy for protecting organizations in the current threat landscape.\n\nThe victims of Operation Parliament need to re-evaluate their approach to cybersecurity.\n\n## Additional information\n\nFor more information about the attacks and the indicators of compromise, please contact:\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\nAlternatively, please visit: https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/apt-intelligencereporting\n\nTo find more information about cybersecurity awareness training for enterprise or\ngovernment staff, go to [Kaspersky Security Awareness.](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/cybersecurity-awareness)\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eNpu4ku8tg4\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nOperation Parliament, who is doing what?\n\nYour email address will not be published.
