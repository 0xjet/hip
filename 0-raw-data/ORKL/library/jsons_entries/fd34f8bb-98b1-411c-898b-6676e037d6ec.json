It uses the Mersenne Twister PRNG and not the ISAAC PRNG asth_\n_initially written._\n\nAs the recent hostilities started between Russia and Ukraine, ESET researchers discovered several malware families targeting Ukrainian\norganizations.\n\nOn February 23, 2022, a destructive campaign using HermeticWiper targeted multiple Ukrainian organizations.rd\nThis cyberattack preceded, by a few hours, the start of the invasion of Ukraine by Russian Federation forces\nInitial access vectors varied from one organization to another. We confirmed one case of the wiper being dropped by GPO, and\nuncovered a worm used to spread the wiper in another compromised network.\nMalware artifacts suggest that the attacks had been planned for several months.\nOn February 24, 2022, a second destructive attack against a Ukrainian governmental network started, using a wiper we have namedth\nIsaacWiper.\nESET Research has not yet been able to attribute these attacks to a known threat actor.\n\n\n## Destructive attacks in Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\ns stated t s S esea c _[t eet a d](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181)_ _[S b ogpost,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/)_ e u co e ed a dest uct e attac aga st co pute s U a e t at sta ted\naround 14:52 on February 23, 2022 UTC. This followed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)rd _[attacks against major Ukrainian websites and](https://www.politico.eu/article/minister-ukraine-websites-down-in-another-massive-online-attack/)_\npreceded the Russian military invasion by a few hours.\n\nThese destructive attacks leveraged at least three components:\n\n**HermeticWiper: makes a system inoperable by corrupting its data**\n**HermeticWizard: spreads HermeticWiper across a local network via WMI and SMB**\n**HermeticRansom: ransomware written in Go**\n\nHermeticWiper was observed on hundreds of systems in at least five Ukrainian organizations.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, we detected yet another new wiper in a Ukrainian governmental network. We named it IsaacWiper and we areth\ncurrently assessing its links, if any, with HermeticWiper. It is important to note that it was seen in an organization that was not affected by\nHermeticWiper.\n\n### Attribution\n\nAt this point, we have not found any tangible connection with a known threat actor. HermeticWiper, HermeticWizard, and HermeticRansom do\nnot share any significant code similarity with other samples in the ESET malware collection. IsaacWiper is still unattributed as well.\n\n### Timeline\n\nHermeticWiper and HermeticWizard are signed by a code-signing certificate (shown in Figure 1) assigned to Hermetica Digital Ltd issued on\nApril 13, 2021. We requested the issuing CA (DigiCert) to revoke the certificate, which it did on February 24, 2022.th th\n\n_Figure 1. Code-signing certificate assigned to Hermetic Digital Ltd_\n\nAccording to a _[report by Reuters, it seems that this certificate was not stolen from Hermetica Digital. It is likely that instead the attackers](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyprus-games-writer-denies-links-malware-found-before-russian-invasion-2022-02-24/)_\nimpersonated the Cypriot company in order to get this certificate from DigiCert.\n\nESET researchers assess with high confidence that the affected organizations were compromised well in advance of the wiper’s deployment.\nThis is based on several facts:\n\n\nHermeticWiper PE compilation timestamps, the oldest being December 28, 2021th\nThe code-signing certificate issue date of April 13, 2021th\nDeployment of HermeticWiper through GPO in at least one instance suggests the attackers had prior access to one of that victim’s\nActive Directory servers\n\nThe events are summarized in the timeline in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Timeline of important events_\n\n### Initial access\n\n HermeticWiper\n\nThe initial access vector is currently unknown but we have observed artifacts of lateral movement inside the targeted organizations. In one\nentity, the wiper was deployed through the default domain policy (GPO), as shown by its path on the system:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\GroupPolicy\\DataStore\\0\\sysvol\\<redacted>\\Policies\\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\\Machine\\cc.exe\n\nThis indicates that attackers likely took control of the Active Directory server.\n\n[In other instances, it is possible that Impacket was used to deploy HermeticWiper. A Symantec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) _[blogpost states that the wiper was deployed](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia)_\nusing the following command line:\n\ncmd.exe /Q /c move CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\temp\\sys.tmp1 CSIDL_WINDOWS\\policydefinitions\\postgresql.exe 1>\n\\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1636727589.6007507 2>&1\n\nThe last part is the same as the default behavior in Impacket’s wmiexec.py, found on _[GitHub.](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/cd4fe47cfcb72d7d35237a99e3df95cedf96e94f/examples/wmiexec.py#L295)_\n\nFinally, a custom worm that we have named HermeticWizard was used to spread HermeticWiper across the compromised networks via SMB\nand WMI.\n\n### IsaacWiper\n\nThe initial access vector is also currently unknown. It is likely that attackers used tools such as Impacket to move laterally. On a few\n[machines, we have also observed RemCom, a remote access tool, being deployed at the same time as IsaacWiper.](https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom)\n\n## Technical analysis\n\n### HermeticWiper\n\nHermeticWiper is a Windows executable with four drivers embedded in its resources. They are legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition\nMaster software signed by CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co., and they implement low-level disk operations. The following files were\nobserved:\n\n0E84AFF18D42FC691CB1104018F44403C325AD21: x64 driver\n379FF9236F0F72963920232F4A0782911A6BD7F7: x86 driver\n87BD9404A68035F8D70804A5159A37D1EB0A3568: x64 XP driver\nB33DD3EE12F9E6C150C964EA21147BF6B7F7AFA9: x86 XP driver\n\nDepending on the operating system version, one of those four drivers is chosen and dropped in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\<4 random\nletters>.sys. It is then loaded by creating a service.\n\n\n-----\n\ne et c pe t e p oceeds by d sab g t e o u e S ado Copy Se ce ( SS) a d pes tse o d s by o e t g ts o e t\nrandom bytes. This anti-forensic measure is likely intended to prevent the analysis of the wiper in a post-incident analysis.\n\nIt is interesting to note that most of the file operations are performed at a low level using DeviceIoControl calls.\n\nThe following locations are overwritten with random bytes generated by the Windows API function CryptGenRandom:\n\nThe master boot record (MBR)\nThe master file table (MFT)\n$Bitmap and $LogFile on all drives\nThe files containing the registry keys (NTUSER*)\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs\n\nIn addition, it also recursively wipes folders and files in Windows, Program Files, Program Files(x86), PerfLogs, Boot, System Volume\nInformation, and AppData folders, using a FSCTL_MOVE_FILE operation. This technique appears to be quite unusual and very similar to\n[what is implemented in the Windows Wipe project on GitHub (see the wipe_extent_by_defrag function). It also wipes symbolic links and big](https://github.com/bleachbit/windows-wipe/blob/master/filewipe.py)\nfiles in My Documents and Desktop folders by overwriting them with random bytes.\n\nFinally, the machine is restarted. However, it will fail to boot, because the MBR, the MFT, and most files were wiped. We believe it is not\npossible to recover the impacted machines.\n\n### HermeticWizard\n\nLooking for other samples signed by the same code-signing certificate (Hermetica Digital Ltd), we found a new malware family that we named\nHermeticWizard.\n\nIt is a worm that was deployed on a system in Ukraine at 14:52:49 on February 23, 2022 UTC. It is a DLL file developed in C++ that exportsrd\nthe functions DllInstall, DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer. Its export DLL name is Wizard.dll. It contains three resources, which are\nencrypted PE files:\n\nA sample of HermeticWiper (912342F1C840A42F6B74132F8A7C4FFE7D40FB77)\nexec_32.dll, responsible for spreading to other local computers via WMI (6B5958BFABFE7C731193ADB96880B225C8505B73)\nromance.dll, responsible for spreading to other local computers via SMB (AC5B6F16FC5115F0E2327A589246BA00B41439C2)\n\nThe resources are encrypted with a reverse XOR loop. Each block of four bytes is XORed with the previous block. Finally, the first block is\nXORed with a hardcoded value, 0x4A29B1A3.\n\nHermeticWizard is started using the command line regsvr32.exe /s /i <path>.\n\nFirst, HermeticWizard tries to find other machines on the local network. It gathers known local IP addresses using the following Windows\nfunctions:\n\nDNSGetCacheDataTable\nGetIpNetTable\nWNetOpenEnumW(RESOURCE_GLOBALNET, RESOURCETYPE_ANY)\nNetServerEnum\nGetTcpTable\nGetAdaptersAddresses\n\nIt then tries to connect to those IP addresses (and only if they are local IP addresses) to see if they are still reachable. In case the -s\nargument was provided when HermeticWizard was started (regsvr32.exe /s /i:-s <path>), it also scans the full /24 range. So, if 192.168.1.5\nwas found in, for example, the DNS cache, it incrementally scans from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. For each IP address, it tries to open a\nTCP connection on the following ports:\n\n20: ftp\n21: ftp\n22: ssh\n80: http\n135: rpc\n137: netbios\n139: smb\n443: https\n445: smb\n\nThe ports are scanned in a random order so it’s not possible to fingerprint HermeticWizard traffic that way.\n\nWhen it has found a reachable machine, it drops the WMI spreader (detailed below) on disk and creates a new process with the command\nline rundll32 <current folder>\\<6 random letters>.ocx #1 -s <path to HermeticWizard> – i <target IP>.\n\n\n-----\n\nt does t e sa e t t e S sp eade (deta ed be o ) t at s a so d opped cu e t o de \\ 6 a do ette s oc, but t d e e t\nrandom letters.\n\nFinally, it drops HermeticWiper in <current folder>\\<6 random letters>.ocx and executes it.\n\n### WMI spreader\n\nThe WMI spreader, named by its developers exec_32.dll, takes two arguments:\n\n-i: The target IP address\n-s: The file to copy and execute on the target machine\n\nFirst, it creates a connection to the remote ADMIN$ share of the target using WNetAddConnection2W. The file provided in the -s argument is\nthen copied using CopyFileW. The remote file has a random name generated with CoCreateGUID (e.g., cB9F06408D8D2.dll) and the string\nformat c%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X.\n\nSecond, it tries to execute the copied file, HermeticWizard, on the remote machine using DCOM. It calls CoCreateInstance with\nCLSID_WbemLocator as argument. It then uses WMI Win32_Process to create a new process on the remote machine, with the command\nline C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start C:\\windows\\system32\\\\regsvr32.exe /s /i C:\\windows\\<filename>.dll.\n\nNote that the -s argument is not passed to HermeticWizard, meaning that it won’t scan the local network again from this newly compromised\nmachine.\n\nIf the WMI technique fails, it tries to create a service using OpenRemoteServiceManager with the same command as above.\n\nIf it succeeds in executing the remote DLL in any way, it sleeps until it can delete the remote file.\n\n### SMB spreader\n\nThe SMB spreader, named by its developers romance.dll, takes the same two arguments as the WMI spreader. Its internal name is likely a\nreference to the EternalRomance exploit, even if it does not use any exploit.\n\nFirst it attempts to connect to the following pipes on the remote SMB share (on port 445):\n\nsamr\nbrowser\nnetlogon\nlsarpc\nntsvcs\nsvcctl\n\nThese are pipes known to be used in lateral movement. The spreader has a list of hardcoded credentials that are used in attempts to\nauthenticate via NTLMSSP to the SMB shares:\n\n— usernames —\n\nguest\n\ntest\n\nadmin\n\nuser\n\nroot\n\nadministrator\n\nmanager\n\noperator\n\n— passwords —\n\n123\n\nQaz123\n\nQwerty123\n\nThis list of credentials is surprisingly short and is unlikely to work in even the most poorly protected networks.\n\nIf the connection is successful, it attempts to drop, to the target ADMIN$ share, the file referenced by the -s argument. As for the WMI\nspreader, the remote filename is generated by a call to CoCreateInstance.\n\nIt then executes, via SMB, the command line cmd /c start regsvr32 /s /i ..\\\\<filename> & start cmd /c \\”ping localhost -n 7 & wevtutil cl\nSystem\\”.\n\n### HermeticRansom\n\n\n-----\n\nS esea c e s a so obse ed e et c a so a so a e tte Go be g used U a e at t e sa e t e as t e\nHermeticWiper campaign. HermeticRansom was first reported in the early hours of February 24, 2022 UTC, in ath _[tweet from AVAST. Our](https://twitter.com/AvastThreatLabs/status/1496663206634344449)_\ntelemetry shows a much smaller deployment compared to HermeticWiper. This ransomware was deployed at the same time as\nHermeticWiper, potentially in order to hide the wiper’s actions. On one machine, the following timeline was observed:\n\n2022-02-23 17:49:55 UTC: HermeticWiper in C:\\Windows\\Temp\\cc.exe deployed\n2022-02-23 18:06:57 UTC: HermeticRansom in C:\\Windows\\Temp\\cc2.exe deployed by the netsvcs service\n2022-02-23 18:26:07 UTC: Second HermeticWiper in C:\\Users\\com.exe deployed\n\nOn one occasion, we observed HermeticRansom being deployed through GPO, just like HermeticWiper:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\GroupPolicy\\DataStore\\0\\sysvol\\<redacted>\\Policies\\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F00C04FB984F9}\\Machine\\cpin.exe\n\nA few strings were left in the binary by the attackers; they reference US President Biden and the White House:\n\n_/C_/projects/403forBiden/wHiteHousE.baggageGatherings\n_/C_/projects/403forBiden/wHiteHousE.lookUp\n_/C_/projects/403forBiden/wHiteHousE.primaryElectionProcess\n_/C_/projects/403forBiden/wHiteHousE.GoodOffice1\n\nOnce files are encrypted, the message in Figure 3 is displayed to the victim.\n\nFigure 3. HermeticRansom’s ransom note\n\n### IsaacWiper\n\nIsaacWiper is found in either a Windows DLL or EXE with no Authenticode signature; it appeared in our telemetry on February 24, 2022. Asth\nmentioned earlier, the oldest PE compilation timestamp we have found is October 19, 2021, meaning that if its PE compilation timestampth\nwas not tampered with, IsaacWiper might have been used in previous operations months earlier.\n\nFor DLL samples, the name in the PE export directory is Cleaner.dll and it has a single export _Start@4.\n\nWe have observed IsaacWiper in %programdata% and C:\\Windows\\System32 under the following filenames:\n\nclean.exe\ncl.exe\ncl64.dll\ncld.dll\ncll.dll\n\nIt has no code similarity with HermeticWiper and is way less sophisticated. Given the timeline, it is possible that both are related but we\nhaven’t found any strong connection yet.\n\nIsaacWiper starts by enumerating the physical drives and calls DeviceIoControl with the IOCTL IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER\nto get their device numbers. It then wipes the first 0x10000 bytes of each disk using the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom generator. The\ngenerator is seeded using the GetTickCount value.\n\nIt then enumerates the logical drives and recursively wipes every file of each disk with random bytes also generated by the Mersenne Twister\nPRNG. It is interesting to note that it recursively wipes the files in a single thread, meaning that it would take a long time to wipe a large disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nO eb ua y 5, 0, attac e s d opped a e e s o o saac pe t debug ogs s ay d cate t at t e attac e s e e u ab e to\nwipe some of the targeted machines and added log messages to understand what was happening.

At this point, we have no indication that other countries wereth th\ntargeted.\n\nHowever, due to the current crisis in Ukraine, there is still a risk that the same threat actors will launch further campaigns against countries\nthat back the Ukrainian government or that sanction Russian entities.\n\n[A list of IoCs can also be found in our GitHub repository.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/ua_wipers)\n\n_For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us at_ _[threatintel@eset.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:threatintel@eset.com)_\n\n_ESET Research now also offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
