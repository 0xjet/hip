However around the beginning of 2011, the attackers’ fo­\ncus shifted dramatically, with international think tanks, the manu­\nfacturing industry, and defense contractors who have interests in\nTaiwan consistently being targeted. The chart below illustrates the\nvolumes and the industries targeted using Taidoor over the last\nthree years. The shift in targets is clearly portrayed in figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1\n###### Targeted Taidoor attacks per industry 2009-2011\n\nIn 2011 the US had been involved in a variety of discussions with Taiwan, the most public of which was in relation\nto the upgrade of the Taiwanese Air Force. Around the same time Taidoor started to almost exclusively target in­\ndividuals from influential think tanks, specifically those who have expertise in South Asian and South-East Asian\npolicy and military strategy. Although these are Figure 2\nnot the first attacks on think tanks, the persis­\n\n###### Increase of Trojan.Taidoor targeted attack emails\n\ntence and sheer volume of the Taidoor attacks\nhas made them more notable. A timeline of\nthe attacks highlights the increased volume of\ntargeted Taidoor emails sent between May and\nOctober 2011, including their peak during the\nUS-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference that\nwas held September 18-20, 2011, as shown in\nfigure 2.\n\nWhile Taidoor’s targets have changed over the\nyears, the attack methodology has remained\nconsistent. Currently the only known attack\nvector for Taidoor is through targeted emails.\nThe email attachments exploit a variety of\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerabilities, yet the payload Trojan itself has seen little change in terms of functionality. Taidoor is limited to\nusing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities; no zero-day exploits have been seen in use. This separates Taidoor from\nmore recent high-profile attacks—such as those involving Duqu or the recent attacks on RSA—where the at­\ntacks are highly sophisticated and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. The Taidoor group appears to play a numbers\ngame when it comes to breaching networks, relying on targeting users running out-of-date, unpatched versions\nof software for the attacks. As one particular campaign gathered momentum, the attackers resorted to sending\nbroad and repeated barrages of emails to large groups of individuals at the target organizations in an attempt to\ncompromise the network.\n\nThe rest of the document will discuss these attacks in more detail, beginning with a breakdown of the typical\nstages of a Taidoor attack. Starting with crafting the targeted email, the focus will then move to the attachment\nand its components: the Taidoor dropper containing the true payload—an embedded, encrypted back door\nTrojan offering remote access to the attacker on the compromised computer. Detailed analysis of the commandand-control (C&C) functionality will be revealed, including the observation of hacked third-party servers as part\nof its infrastructure to forward communications to the attackers. During the analysis some live interactive ses­\nsions were captured revealing interaction with a human attacker, and his or her intentions once on the box. One\nof these interactive sessions is presented. The final section provides attributes that may point to the profile of\nthe attackers.\n\nTaidoor is not going away. It’s persistent, it’s constantly evolving, and the adaptability of the attackers will en­\nsure that it remains a danger to any organization that falls within its scope.\n\n#### Technical details\n\n##### The email\n\n\nThis is the breach component of Taidoor, which is\npivotal to the attack. Taidoor emails are created\nwith varying degrees of sophistication and are\ntypically employed in a two-pronged attack.\n\nThe vast majority of emails used in these recent\nattacks are sent from mail servers based in Tai­\nwan and the US, as shown in figure 3. The coun­\ntry of origin will change depending on the targets\nof the attack. For example the mails from France\ncontained subject matter related to the G20 sum­\nmit in Paris, while those coming from Turkey were\ndirected at targets with Turkish email addresses.\n\n###### Crafting the email\n\nTo begin with, the main target of interest is\nidentified. The content of the email is specifically\ncrafted in order to entice the chosen target into\nopening it. The email is then either sent solely to\nthe target of interest or the target of interest plus\na group of other personnel working at the same\norganization. This second strategy is popular with\nmore recent Taidoor attacks, as it would prove\nuseful in situations where compromising the main\ntarget is proving difficult. Compromising a lowervalue target still provides a foothold within the\norganization from where the attacker can then\nattempt to move towards the true target.\n\n\nFigure 3\n###### Mail server country of origin for Taidoor emails\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two types of content typically found in Taidoor emails. The first type is simple, requiring little-or-no\nbackground research on the target. The content is general, typically including a catchy Subject line, a funny im­\nage, a brief message, or a topical subject that may entice the user into opening the malicious attachment, such\nas that displayed in figure 4.\n\nFigure 4\n###### A generic Taidoor email\n\nThe second type requires some background research on the intended target. Far more preparation is required,\nas the email will need to contain content relevant to the target. The subject line, the message body and the at­\ntached document will all contain information that might entice them into reading what is inside the attachment.\nThe content is typically related to policy or events that the target would be interested in or would likely attend.\nThe sender’s email address will also be doctored so that it appears to have come from a reputable source; some­\none they would probably recognize by name. This would likely be a co-worker, a speaker at an upcoming event, or\na prominent individual in their chosen field\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is an example of a targeted attack that took place on October 24, 2011. Over the course of the day, targeted\nmails were sent to 25 individuals working at three separate organizations. The same malicious file was attached\nto all the emails; however, the subject line and the message content differed. Examining the malicious attach­\nment we could see it was identical for each email. Here are the four subject lines used in these emails, followed\nby an example email:\n\n_•_ _Fwd: Panetta criticizes North Korea for reckless acts_\n\n_•_ _Panetta criticizes North  for reckless acts_\n\n_•_ _Returned mail: see transcript for details_\n\n_•_ _Warning: could not send message for past 4 hours_\n\nFigure 5\n###### An targeted Taidoor email\n\nOut of the 25 emails, 22 were sent through a Taiwanese mail server. They targeted individuals working at an\ninfluential international think tank located in the US and were sent in quick succession. Later that day two more\nemails containing an identical attachment were sent through a mail server located in the US. However this time\nthe emails targeted three prominent figures working at three separate organizations: one located in the US (the\nthink tank that was targeted in the earlier batch of emails) and two others in Germany. These three targets are\nsubject experts on military strategy and policy in South-East Asia. This tactic is typical of Taidoor, as mentioned\nearlier, where one of these targets appears to be the “real” target of interest and the rest appear to be of lesser\ninterest but could offer up useful information or be used as a stepping stone toward the true target\n\n\n-----\n\nDetermining who the targets of interest are is\nstraightforward when examining the frequency\nof targeted emails sent to individuals. As an\nexample, a target of interest at one of these\norganizations is referred to as “Mr. X”.\n\nMr. X was sent up to 23 targeted Taidoor\nemails in June 2011 —a substantial increase\nfrom previous months. This individual was\nconsistently targeted for over nine months—by\nfar the most targeted individual. Such focus\ndemonstrates the persistence of the Taidoor\nattackers. The repeated attempts indicate that\nthis target has been extremely difficult to com­\npromise and is considered of high value.\n\n##### The attachment\n\n\nFigure 6\n###### Emails targeting “Mr. X” (2011)\n\n\nThe sample email above contained a mali­\ncious PDF attachment; however, Taidoor\ndoesn’t confine itself to PDFs. Taidoor has\nbeen used in a wide variety of attachments,\nincluding malicious Microsoft PowerPoint,\nWord (.doc and .rtf file formats), and Excel\nfiles. Malicious executables and even DLLs\n(BID 47741) have been used as part of\nrecent attacks. In these cases the malicious\nfile is typically contained within an archive.\nIn more recent attacks Word documents\nand PDFs have been the most popular at­\ntack vectors. However the malicious attach­\nments constantly change, with new exploits\nappearing regularly.\n\nThe malicious attachments have used a\nlarge set of vulnerabilities over the years,\ncovering all main document formats. This\nclearly indicates that this group has both\nthe focus and the intent to keep these\nexploits relevant and up-to-date. The group\nis clearly not afraid to try out new exploits.\nThe number utilized is remarkable.\n\n\nFigure 7\n###### Popularity of attachment type\n(.dll, .scr, and .exe files are typically contained within archive files)\n\n\n\n- [Microsoft PowerPoint Malformed Record Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 18382)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18382)\n\n- [Microsoft Word Malformed Data Structures Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 21518)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21518)\n\n- [Adobe Acrobat and Reader Multiple Arbitrary Code Execution and Security Vulnerabilities (BID 27641)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/27641)\n\n- [Microsoft PowerPoint Sound Data (CVE-2009-1129) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 34839)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34839)\n\n- [Adobe Reader and Acrobat ‘newplayer()’ JavaScript Method Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 37331)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37331)\n\n- [Microsoft Excel ‘FEATHEADER’ Record Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 36945)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36945)\n\n- [Adobe Flash Player CVE-2011-0611 ‘SWF’ File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability (BID 47314)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/47314)\n\n- [Multiple Microsoft Products DLL Loading Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 47741)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/47741)\n\n- [Adobe Acrobat and Reader CVE-2011-2100 DLL Loading Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 48252)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/48252)\n\nIt is worth noting again that none of the vulnerabilities used by Taidoor are zero-day exploits. Taidoor simply\nleverages publicly disclosed security bugs in popular applications and therefore relies on the target or targets to\nbe running unpatched software.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 shows the email attachment\ntypes chosen by attackers in 2011.\n\nWe can see a marked increase in the\nuse of vulnerable Word documents in\nthe run-up to the US-Taiwan Defense\nIndustry Conference in September\n2011. The group probably found\nmore success with the Word exploit\nfor this period of the campaign.\nHowever they switch to older vulner­\nabilities if the new ones are proving\nless successful, which was the case\nfor BID 47741.\n\n\nFigure 8\n###### Breakdown of malicious attachment types for 2011\n(.dll, .scr, and .exe files are typically contained within archive files)\n\n\nThe goal of the email is to entice the\nrecipient into opening the malicious\nattachment. The goal of the attach­\nment is to surreptitiously copy the\nembedded Trojan onto Figure 9\nthe user’s computer and\n\n###### Taidoor PDF attachment\n\nlaunch it without drawing\nattention to the fact that\nthe user has just been\ncompromised.\n\nTaking the attachment\nin the previous targeted\nemail, let’s examine what\nhappens if the malicious\ndocument is opened.\nThe PDF is exploiting BID\n47314, a vulnerability\nin Adobe Reader that\nleads to code execution\nof the attacker’s choos­\ning. This code decrypts,\nextracts, and executes\nthe embedded Taidoor\ndropper. It also extracts\nand presents the clean\nPDF in figure 9, so as not\nto alarm the user to any\nunusual behavior.\n\nThe content in the PDF was scraped from an Associated Press article that started to appear on most major news\nfeeds the very day the email was sent: October 24, 2011.\n\n##### The dropper\n\nOnce the user has opened the malicious attachment the infection process is set into motion. Once the dropper\nis created in the file system, it is executed. It starts one of the following legitimate processes, after which it will\nreplace this clean, in-memory image with the malicious back door component:\n\n   - services.exe\n\n   - svchost.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nThe back door component is normally present in the form of either an encrypted resource entry or as an encrypt­\ned binary array within the code section of the dropper. Figure 10 helps illustrate the layout of each file and the\nsteps taken once the malicious attachment is launched.\n\nFigure 10\n###### Taidoor file layout\n\n**services.exe / svchost.exe**\n\n**PDF Exploiting**\n\n**BID 47314**\n\n**Back door**\n\n**Taidoor**\n**dropper**\n\n**Encrypted**\n\n**Decrypts** **Injects**\n**Taidoor**\n\n**Encrypted** **Encrypted**\n\n**back door** **C&C**\n**component** **servers**\n\n**Clean**\n\n**PDF**\n\n##### The payload\n\nThe final payload is now in place. This is the back door component that communicates with the C&C server. The\nback door stores configuration information in the “.data” section which is setup by the attackers. This configu­\nration information contains up to three C&C servers, up to three ports per server, and a default sleep interval.\nOnce the back door is successfully installed on the system it will attempt to communicate with the C&C server\nusing the HTTP protocol. Let us examine this in more detail.\n\n##### Command-and-Control server\n\n###### Protocol\n\nTrojan.Taidoor communicates with the controlling server using the HTTP protocol with requests using the follow­\ning format and detailed in table 1:\n```\n  http://[C&C _ SERVER]:[PORT]/[RANDOM].php?id=[RAND][ID][OPTIONAL]\n\n```\nTable 1\n###### HTTP communication format Variable Description\n\n[C&C_SERVER] Up to three configurable C&C servers\n\n[PORT] Up to three configurable ports\n\n[RANDOM_PATH] Five random, lower-case letters. Recreated every time Taidoor initializes or fails to contact its configured servers.\n\n[RAND] Six-decimal, random number recreated for each request. The values are between 0-32767 (limited by RAND_MAX).\n\n[ID] Twelve characters derived from MAC address of the compromised computer.\n\n[OPTIONAL] Is \"&ext=[FILENAME]\" which may be present in requests related to specific commands\n\n|http://[C&C _ SERVER]:[PORT]/[RANDOM].php?id=[RAND][ID][OPTIONAL]|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Table 1||\n|HTTP communication format||\n|Variable|Description|\n|[C&C_SERVER]|Up to three configurable C&C servers|\n|[PORT]|Up to three configurable ports|\n|[RANDOM_PATH]|Five random, lower-case letters. Recreated every time Taidoor initializes or fails to contact its configured servers.|\n|[RAND]|Six-decimal, random number recreated for each request. The values are between 0-32767 (limited by RAND_MAX).|\n|[ID]|Twelve characters derived from MAC address of the compromised computer.|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the message body is present in a request or response, it is encrypted using RC4. The RC4 key is simply a\nstring representation of the compromised computer’s adapter address (e.g. 01-27-89-AB-CD-EF). This means\nthat the C&C server must be able to compute the RC4 key from the [ID] present in the HTTP request. Because\nsuch an [ID] is unique for each computer it could also be used by the controlling server for tracking purposes.\n\nTrojan.Taidoor uses an algorithm when generating the ID field. First it obtains a string representation of the\nadapter address. A default value of “01-01-01-01-01-01” is used if it fails to obtain the adapter address. It strips\nthe “-” characters from the string and then increments the value of each character. If it encounters ‘9’ this value\nwill be set to ‘0’. For example “01-27-89-AB-CD-EF” would convert to “123890BCDEFG”\n\nTrojan.Taidoor periodically queries the C&C server for commands by sending GET requests with an empty mes­\nsage body. This period is configurable by the attacker and is stored, along with the C&C information, in the\ndata section. Values for this sleep interval has been seen as low as two and as high as 600 seconds. The server\nresponds with RC4-encrypted commands in the message body. The first byte of decrypted message body is the\ncommand ID, followed by an optional parameter. Table 2 details the commands available to the attacker.\n\nTable 2\n###### Taidoor C&C commands ID* Format Command Details\n\n2 DWORD Set Delay Period in milliseconds for the sleep time in between requests.\n\n3 STRING Execute Command to be executed.

This improves Trojan.Taidoor’s response time to subsequent commands sent by the attacker. Over the\nnext 60 seconds the attacker will look for the following information about the compromised host:\n\n- Currently running services.\n\n- Contents of the “Documents and Settings” folder: What users are on the system?\n\n- Contents of the “Recently Used Documents” item.\n\n- Contents of the “Program Files” folder: What software is installed?\n\n- Contents of the Desktop.\n\n- A list of the currently open TCP/IP connections.\n\n- A list of available network connections.\n\n\nThe attacker initially searches for docu­\nments and users of interest on the com­\npromised computer. If the user is not a\ntarget of interest, the attacker can search\nfor other computers of higher value on the\nnetwork using the shell or by downloading\nadditional tools on to the compromised\ncomputer in order to assist in traversing\nthe network. It is worth noting that this is\nnot automated, but that an actual attacker\nsitting at the other end, typing these com­\nmands.\n\n###### Hacked third-party servers\n\nSome basic reconnaissance was done on\nthe C&C servers used by Trojan.Taidoor.\nMany of the Taidoor C&C servers probed\nappeared to be compromised third-party\nservers, as opposed to leased servers\ncommonly used as part of a C&C infra­\nstructure. The servers are probably used\nin an effort to hide the true location of\nthe attacker and they simply forward the\nmalicious communication to another loca­\ntion. The highest concentrations of Trojan.\nTaidoor C&C servers are in the US and\nTaiwan, as shown in figure 11.\n\nSimple fingerprinting on these computers\nrevealed that they were consistently run­\nning a number of services. It is probable\nthat such services were vulnerable to basic\nattacks, as several of the C&C servers had\nbeen compromised by third-party hackers\nprior to their use by the Taidoor attack­\ners. The screenshot in figure 12 is from a\ncached Web page defacement of one par­\nticular server. Such defacements are typi­\ncally performed by attackers with limited\nskill sets. This implies that the services on\nthe computer were trivial to compromise\nor that it was poorly maintained, with little\nor no patching.\n\n\nFigure 11\n###### C&C servers by country\n\nFigure 12\n###### Previously hacked C&C server, as shown in a\n publicly accessible website\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Variants\n\nTo date we have seen at least 14 different variants of Trojan.Taidoor. The earliest compilation date is March 11,\n2008. Trojan.Taidoor doesn’t track version information itself. However, examining modifications to the compiled\ncode section of the back door component over time allows for version tracking. Most of the distinct PE images\nshare identical code sections, and only the details of the C&C servers in the data section differ between attacks.\nSome versions have seen extensive use, while others have been seen far less frequently, and for very brief peri­\nods of time. Figure 13 tracks the modifications over time.\n\nFigure 13\n###### Taidoor versioning 2008-2011, based on PE code section similarity\n\nThis chart shows the date and timestamp of the compiled files with the identified version of the back door.\nVersion 1 was used on March 11, 2008 and version 13 was used from March 16, 2011 up until August 13, 2011.\nThere is very little overlap in use of the back doors between versions. This indicates that a single entity is re­\nsponsible for development. If the source code of the threat was shared amongst multiple entities, there would be\na much larger number of versions,\n\nFigure 14\n\nand their use would overlap more.\nSeveral variants were used for an Taidoor version distribution in emails (2010-2011)\nextended period of time, the most\nwidely being version 13—the ver­\nsion used to target think tanks.\n\nThe chart in figure 14 compares\nthe date of emails, instead of\ncompile time, with the back door\nversion. There is some degree\nof overlap, but the majority of\nusage is again distinct between\nversions. This reinforces the as­\nsumption that a single entity is in\ncontrol of the source code.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Patterns of activity\n\nSome interesting patterns of behavior were observed during the interactive sessions with the C&C servers. For\nmost of the day the servers would issue a connection reset or return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) message. These\nservers then “woke up” for certain periods of the day. These times typically occurred between 1:00 and 8:00\nUTC. This was the case for the majority of successful C&C interactions logged, indicating some regular pattern of\nactivity for these attackers.\n\n##### Attacker profile\n\nAttributing the Taidoor attacks to a particular party is not likely, but there are a number of factors in the Trojan.\nTaidoor attacks that may offer an indication as to the source of the threat.\n\nTaidoor has been maintained with new versions and new exploits relatively consistently from 2008, up to the end\nof 2011. Such consistency is possible for an individual working full-time. However, the additional work required\nto maintain the infrastructure behind Taidoor—hacking C&C servers, investigating targets in order to tailor\nattacks, and then actually spreading within a network once it is compromised—is beyond the capabilities of an\nindividual. A number of people are clearly involved. This is likely an organized group of individuals who have a\nbroad range of skills and a reasonable level of hacking ability, given the number of compromised C&C servers. It\nis quite possible that individuals within the group are given particular roles for each stage of the operation, since\nthis work would divide up easily.\n\nHowever, although the group is active and must consist of several people, their resources are limited. No zeroday exploits have been found associated with Taidoor; only previously published ones. The group does not have\nthe skills to develop a zero-day, nor the funds to obtain them. The C&C servers are hacked, not purchased.\nAlthough hacking of the C&C servers does offer a level of anonymity, it is also an unreliable method of control.\nThe hacked C&C servers may be discovered by the owner of the compro­\nmised computer and shut down at any time. As such, it is unlikely that Table 4\nthe group has access to substantial funds. Time zones\n\n###### Region Local Time\n\nThe times of operation of the attackers may be an indicator as to their\nlocation. As described earlier, interactions with the C&C servers oc­ Japan 10:00am—5:00pm\ncurred primarily between 1:00 and 8:00 UTC. Table 4 shows these times Taiwan 9:00am—4:00pm\nfor various countries around the world.\n\nChina (Beijing) 9:00am—4:00pm\n\nIn addition, the group can write competent emails in both English and India 6:30am—1:30pm\nTraditional Chinese. Russia (Moscow) 5:00am—12:00pm\n\nUK 1:00am—8:00am\n\nThe motivations of the group are difficult to determine. Clearly there\nwas a major shift in the group in 2011, judging from the change in tar­ US (Eastern) 8:00pm—3:00am\ngets. Initially starting with a wide range of disparate targets, the group US (Pacific) 5:00pm—12:00pm\nbegan to focus almost exclusively on one particular type of target—\npolicy think tanks—and in relation to one particular topic: US-Taiwanese dealings. The nature of the topic is\nsomething that would be of most interest to parties involved in the discussions, parties who may be affected by\nthe discussions such as private industry looking for a competitive advantage or nation states, or possibly hackers\nlooking to expose confidential information on such discussions for ideology or fame.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nTrojan.Taidoor’s attack methodology follows a consistent pattern associated with targeted attacks: a crafted\nemail with a malicious attachment. It’s clear that this group is highly motivated and persistent, which is evi­\ndent from the longevity of the Taidoor campaign and the variation in targeted organizations. These attacks are\nongoing, so we will continue to provide Symantec customers with cutting-edge solutions to protect themselves\nagainst both current and future Taidoor attacks.\n\n|Table 4|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Time zones||\n|Region|Local Time|\n|Japan|10:00am—5:00pm|\n|Taiwan|9:00am—4:00pm|\n|China (Beijing)|9:00am—4:00pm|\n|India|6:30am—1:30pm|\n|Russia (Moscow)|5:00am—12:00pm|\n|UK|1:00am—8:00am|\n|US (Eastern)|8:00pm—3:00am|\n|US (Pacific)|5:00pm—12:00pm|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Symantec protection\n\nMany different Symantec protection technologies play a role in defending against this threat, including:\n\n##### File-based protection (traditional antivirus)\n\n[Traditional antivirus protection is designed to detect and block malicious files and is effective against files as­](http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=star&tabID=2)\nsociated with this attack.\n\n     - [Trojan.Taidoor](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-072816-0504-99)\n\n     - [Trojan Horse](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-021914-2822-99)\n\n     - [Trojan.Pidief](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-121708-1022-99)\n\n##### Network-based protection (IPS)\n\n[Network-based protection in Symantec Endpoint Protection can help protect against unauthorized network ac­](http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=star&tabID=3)\n[tivities conducted by malware threats or intrusion attempts.
