Analysis revealed\n[Vidar is an information stealer that is a copycat or fork of Arkei malware. Since that time,](https://fumik0.com/2018/12/24/lets-dig-into-vidar-an-arkei-copycat-forked-stealer-in-depth-analysis/)\nVidar has led to other Arkei-based variants. Today's diary reviews Vidar and two additional\nvariants: [Oski Stealer and](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/meet-oski-stealer-an-in-depth-analysis-of-the-popular-credential-stealer) [Mars Stealer based on analysis of their infection traffic.](https://cyberint.com/blog/research/mars-stealer/)\n\n_Shown above: At least two new Arkei variants seen since Vidar in 2018._\n\n**_Legitimate files used by Vidar, Oski, & Mars Stealer_**\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring Vidar infections, the initial malware retrieves legitimate DLL files hosted on the same\nC2 server used for data exfiltration. These files are not malicious, but they are used by the\nVidar malware binary.\n\n**_freebl3.dll (DLL for Thunderbird)_**\n**_mozglue.dll (DLL for Thunderbird)_**\n**_msvcp140.dll (Microsoft C runtime library)_**\n**_nss3.dll (DLL for Thunderbird)_**\n**_softokn3.dll (DLL for Thunderbird)_**\n**_vcruntime140.dll (Microsoft C runtime library)_**\n\nTo the above list, Oski Stealer and Mars Stealer add another legitimate DLL:\n\n**_sqlite3.dll (used for SQLite operations)_**\n\nDuring Vidar infections, the initial malware binary requests each file from its C2 server. The\nimage below reveals separate HTTP GET request for each of the legitimate DLL files caused\nby [this Vidar sample from September 2019.](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/b4c9aadd18c1b6f613bf9d6db71dcc010bbdfe8b770b4084eeb7d5c77d95f180/)\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from a Vidar infection in September 2019 filtered in Wireshark._\n\nLike Vidar, Oski Stealer retrieves each of the legitimate DLL files separately. But Oski does\nnot use the file names in its URLs for the DLLs. Traffic generated by this Oski Stealer\nsample from January 2022 is shown below.\n\n_Shown above: Traffic caused by an Oski Stealer infection in January 2022 filtered in_\n_Wireshark._\n\n\n-----\n\n[Malware advertised in underground forums as Mars Stealer started to appear in 2021.](https://cyberint.com/blog/research/mars-stealer/)\n[Current samples of Mars Stealer (like this one) retrieve legitimate DLL files as a single zip](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/7022a16d455a3ad78d0bbeeb2793cb35e48822c3a0a8d9eaa326ffc91dd9e625/)\narchive.

All three types of\nmalware send a zip archive containing data stolen from the infected Windows host. But the\npatterns have changed. Below are images that illustrate the HTTP POST requests that send\nstolen data to their C2 servers. Arrows highlight the zip archives.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Data exfiltration from a Vidar infection in September 2019 (part 1 of 2)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Data exfiltration from a Vidar infection in September 2019 (part 2 of 2)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Data exfiltration from an Oski Stealer infection in January 2022._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Data exfiltration from a Mars Stealer infection in March 2022._\n\nThe content of zip archives posted by Vidar, Oski Stealer, and Mars Stealer has also\nevolved.
