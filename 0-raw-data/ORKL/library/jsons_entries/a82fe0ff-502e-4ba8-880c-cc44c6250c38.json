The defendant was\nalso ordered by the court to pay restitution in the amount of $2,500,000.\n\nAccording to documents filed in the case, statements made at the sentencing, and public\ndocuments, Andrii Kolpakov, 33, who has used a number of different names, served as a\nhigh-level hacker, whom the group referred to as a “pen tester,” for FIN7. He was arrested in\nLepe, Spain, on June 28, 2018, at the request of U.S. law enforcement and was extradited to\nthe United States on June 1, 2019. In June 2020, he pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to public documents, since at least 2015, members of FIN7 (also referred to as\nCarbanak Group and the Navigator Group, among other names) engaged in a highly\nsophisticated malware campaign to attack hundreds of U.S. companies, predominantly in the\nrestaurant, gambling and hospitality industries. FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer\nsystems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers that were then used or\nsold for profit. FIN7, through its dozens of members, launched waves of malicious\ncyberattacks on numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad. FIN7\ncarefully crafted email messages that would appear legitimate to a business’s employees\nand accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the emails. Once\nan attached file was opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the\nCarbanak malware, in addition to an arsenal of other tools, to access and steal payment card\ndata for the business’s customers. Since 2015, many of the stolen payment card numbers\nhave been offered for sale through online underground marketplaces.\n\nIn the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of businesses\nin all 50 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 20 million customer card\nrecords from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate\nbusiness locations. According to court documents, victims incurred enormous costs that,\naccording to some estimates, exceeded $1 billion. Additional intrusions occurred abroad,\nincluding in the United Kingdom, Australia and France. Companies that have publicly\ndisclosed hacks attributable to FIN7 include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili’s, Arby’s, Red Robin\nand Jason’s Deli.\n\nKolpakov was involved with FIN7 from at least April 2016 until his arrest in June 2018. He\nalso managed other hackers tasked with breaching the security of victims’ computer\nsystems. During the course of the scheme, Kolpakov received compensation for his\nparticipation in FIN7, which far exceeded comparable legitimate employment in Ukraine.\nMoreover, FIN7 members, including Kolpakov, were aware of reported arrests of other FIN7\nmembers, but nevertheless continued to attack U.S. businesses.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal\nDivision; Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman for the Western District of Washington; and\nSpecial Agent in Charge Donald M. Voiret of the FBI’s Seattle Field Office made the\nannouncement.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Seattle Cyber Task Force of the\nFBI and the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department’s Office of International\nAffairs, the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, numerous computer security\nfirms and financial institutions, FBI offices across the nation and globe, as well as a number\nof international agencies provided significant assistance. Spanish law enforcement\nauthorities provided significant assistance by arresting Kolpakov.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Anthony Teelucksingh of the Criminal Division s\nComputer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Francis\nFranze-Nakamura and Steven Masada of the Western District of Washington.\n\n\n-----",
