In this research, we focus on two key aspects:\n\n**A Glimpse Into the Underground: A survey of Raccoon’s origin, team members, business model, and marketing**\nefforts, as well as Raccoon’s reception by the underground cybercrime community and the existing feuds between\nRaccoon’s team and their direct competitors.\n**A Technical Breakdown: A comprehensive technical overview of Raccoon’s current capabilities and delivery**\nmethods, with a look into their future plans for the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[The top 10 malware mentions over seven months in 2019 from Recorded Future.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/measuring-malware-popularity/)_\n\n[The Raccoon stealer is one of the 2019 top 10 most-mentioned malware in the underground economy and is widely](https://www.recordedfuture.com/measuring-malware-popularity/)\nknown to have infected hundreds of thousands of devices around the world, despite it not being overly sophisticated or\ninnovative. This strain of malware first emerged as recently as 2019, and has already established a strong following\namong cybercriminals. Its popularity, even with a limited feature set, signals the continuation of a growing trend of the\ncommoditization of malware as they follow a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) model and evolve their efforts.\n\n_Build an iterative defense that addresses threats like these.

Although it is not an advanced malware, it is estimated to have infected hundreds of thousands of\n[devices around the world and is in the top 10 mentioned in the underground communities for 2019.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/measuring-malware-popularity/)\n\nRaccoon is written in C++ and works on both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems. Though it was originally classified as\na password stealer by many AV companies, we and others in the community see it leverage broader capabilities and\ncategorize it as an information stealer.\n\nRaccoon searches system files for a range of confidential data which it saves and sends to its operator. It is able to\ncollect the following data:\n\nCredit Card Data\nCryptocurrency Wallets\nPasswords\nEmails\nData from All Popular Browsers Including Credit Card Info, URLs, Usernames, Passwords\nCookies\nSystem Information\n\n## Threat Actor Overview\n\nThe Raccoon stealer is developed by a team that appears to originate in Russia and be Russian-speaking. The team\ninitially promoted the stealer in exclusively Russian-speaking hacking forums, but now actively promotes it in Englishspeeaking communities as well. It is aggressively marketed in the cybercrime underground and has been since April\n2019.\n\n_Raccoon stealer marketed in a Russian underground forum._\n\nRaccoon is sold as a MaaS with features like an easy-to-use automated backend panel, bulletproof hosting, and 24/7\n[customer support in both Russian and English.

The development](https://www.lastline.com/blog/malware-as-a-service-the-9-to-5-of-organized-cybercrime/)\nteam seems to be quick, responsive, and dedicated, using short development cycles to release updates, bug fixes, and\nnew features within days. They are also highly active in underground communities under the username raccoonstealer.\nThey post daily and reply to community questions and comments within hours in underground forums and on Telegram.\n\n### Who is behind the Raccoon Stealer?\n\nWhile the identity of the team behind Raccoon remains unknown, some members in the underground community\nattribute the project to another well-known member, glad0ff. Alexuiop1337, the [author of predator stealer and one of the](https://securelist.com/a-predatory-tale/89779/)\nstrongest critics of Raccoon, [was one of the first to make this allegation. Of course, the accusations made by direct](https://telegra.ph/Raccoon-stealer---nazad-v-proshloe-04-24)\ncompetitors should be taken with a grain of salt. However, the leads Alexuiop1337 provided in his blog can potentially\ntie glad0ff to Raccoon.\n\nAn analysis of the Raccoon stealer’s [hacked panel and](https://telegra.ph/Raccoon-stealer---nazad-v-proshloe-04-24) [leaked customer base could imply the admin of Raccoon is a](https://pastebin.com/YJQqLTmu)\nuser with the online handle glad0ff. The user glad0ff was created in the Raccoon stealers database in February of 2019,\nroughly two months before the team began aggressively marketing Raccoon to the underground community.\n\n_glad0ff user creation date in Raccoon’s database._\n\n_One of the first mentions of Raccoon in underground forums._\n\n## Who is glad0ff?\n\n\n-----\n\n_glad0ff is a long time threat actor_ [responsible for developing malware like the](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/the-cv-of-a-cybercriminal/) [Decrux and](https://app.any.run/tasks/74cca06d-f876-4d02-b7f3-f4286fdadae5/) [Acrux cryptominers, the](https://twitter.com/0btemos_bhs/status/1017239171805646848?lang=en-gb)\n[Mimosa RAT and the](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/the-cv-of-a-cybercriminal/) [ProtonBot loader. glad0ff caters to less sophisticated cyber criminals looking for easy-to-use, end-](https://fumik0.com/2019/05/24/overview-of-proton-bot-another-loader-in-the-wild/)\nto-end solutions. Similar to customers of Raccoon, customers from many of glad0ff’s previous projects praise the quality\n[of service, dedication, and responsiveness when fixing issues. It was previously believed that glad0ff operated alone,](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/the-cv-of-a-cybercriminal/)\nhowever, there are indications that the Raccoon stealer involved other members, as we discuss later on.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that glad0ff stopped posting in many underground forums in April of 2019, which aligns with\nthe launch of the Raccoon stealer.\n\n_Last seen date for the glad0ff user._\n\n### Is Raccoon Tied to Malware from Other Threat Actors?\n\nOther members in the underground community have questioned whether Raccoon is linked to other stealers like Vidar\nand Baldr, as they noticed great similarities between the aforementioned infostealers. Raccoon team members\nconsistently deny any ties to other stealers.\n\n_“Do you have any relation to the Vidar team?” Reply: “No.”_\n\n## Raccoon’s Reception in the Underground Community\n\nIt is interesting to note that many individuals choose to write reviews for Raccoon. As malware authors turn to MaaS,\nthey follow many of the same paths as a legitimate SaaS business: marketing efforts, relying on positive reviews,\nresponsive customer support, and regularly improving features in their product.\n\n### Positive Feedbacks and Endorsements\n\nGenerally, feedback around Raccoon in the underground community is positive. Many in the community praise and\nendorse Raccoon’s malware capabilities and the services the team provides. Some voices in the community even\n[endorse it as a worthy replacement for the famous Azorult stealer. However, it is important to note that there are some](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/watch-where-you-browse-the-fallout-exploit-kit-stays-active)\ndissenting opinions. Advanced members in the community find Raccoon to be simple and lacking in features when\ncompared to other information stealers. With that said, many in the community believe that while the malware may lack\nin features, sophistication, or innovation, it largely makes up for it with consistency and an impressive level of service,\nsupport, and quality user experience.\n\n\n-----\n\nRaccoon s popularity combined with its limited feature set yet high adoption speaks to a growing trend of the\ncommoditization of malware, as malware authors shoot to create platforms for crime instead of committing the crimes\ndirectly.\n\n**Example #1: Early Adopter Replaces Azorult**\n\nThis early adopter of Raccoon claims he has been using it since the initial launch. After Azorult was shut down at the\nend of 2018, he tried almost every stealer on the market before settling on Raccoon.\n\n_“I am among the first clients of these guys, practically using their product since the initial launch. I have used many other_\n_stealers before, essentially i tried all there is in this market to offer. After the “death” of “azora” (Azorult malware), I_\n_searched for a long time for a decent replacement and finally, found it in Racoon!_\n\n**Example #2: Praise for Excellent Service**\n\nThis user leveraged a free trial of Raccoon, and deemed it an excellent product they were interested in switching to.\nThey specifically reference one instance where there was a bug in the panel’s search engine that was fixed immediately\non the fly.\n\n_“They let me try the stealer for a few days. In general, first impressions were good. The rate of successful infection is_\n_very good. Had an issue with the control panel’s search engine. Problem was solved immediately, on the fly ) There is_\n_no support for IE, and the download of all logs, but i have been told that these features will be added in the near future._\n_Not bad at all. Thinking of getting it as soon as my current lease is over)”_\n\n**Example #3: User Testimonial - A Worthy Replacement for Azorult**\n\nThis user switched from Azorult to Raccoon because of how easy the control panel was to use. In addition, the user\nexperiences a very high success rate and is a big supporter of the quality of service.\n\n\n-----\n\n_“I switched from azor (Azorult) to raccoon and got a great joy of how convenient the admin control panel is,_\n**_there are no extra, unnecessary details such as in vidar (Vidar malware) but there are these small, little details that_**\n_are helpful and mandatory for people who process a large amount of logs. If judging the build, that everything is alright,_\n_with azor i always had around 60%+ of successful infection rate and here i found a good crypter and have 90% of rate…_\n\n_[snipped] What surprised me is the support that treats you as a VIP class client, they will do whatever you_\n**_demand and with expressing gratitude, etc. it is very nice and I have never seen experienced it anywhere else.”_**\n\n### Criticism of Raccoon by Members of the Underground Community\n\nSince day one, some members of the underground community have criticized Raccoon, specifically targeting it's lack of\ncapabilities, poor coding, and several security issues in the infrastructure and admin panel code.\n\n[Perhaps one of the most negative reviews comes from Alexuiop1337. Alexuiop1337 wrote](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/predator-the-thief-new-routes-delivery.html) [a very detailed blog](https://telegra.ph/Raccoon-stealer---nazad-v-proshloe-04-24)\ndissecting and criticizing the malware and its infrastructure. According to Alexuiop1337, Raccoon has vulnerabilities that\nlet attackers DDoS their servers and dump sensitive data. In his review, Alexuiop1337 also tries to expose the identity of\none of the developers behind Raccoon by claiming it is glad0ff/wankfbi, another member of the underground community\n\nOther negative reviews voiced by customers or testers complain that Raccoon has:\n\n1. A low success rate for infection at about 45%.\n2. Some bugs that make it difficult to access logs and delete logs from the control panel.\n3. Some missing information or version compatibility issues in its stealing modules.\n\n_“- The stealer often doesn’t still software or its version, and for me it was important_\n\n_The cookies from the stealer are often transferred incomplete,_\n\n_I don't understand why it does it, but in the previous stealer there were no such problems ”_\n\n**Public Disputes and Controversies with the Raccoon Team**\n\nWithin the underground community, the Raccoon team is also facing some public disputes and controversies. These\ndisputes offer an important glimpse into the inner workings of the team and give a broader sense of just how competitive\nthe commodity malware market is.\n\nIn addition, these conflicts validate our hypothesis that Raccoon is not operated by a single user, but by a team. It\ngives insight into the types of relationships the team members have and how fragile and opportunistic those ties can be.\n\n**Internal Disputes Shed Light on the Raccoon Team Dynamics**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first public signs of tension between Raccoon team members began shortly after their launch in April. Following a\nleak of their customer database, the team released a statement claiming their servers were not hacked, but that the leak\nwas caused by a disgruntled team member using the database as blackmail for more money. When the team member\ndemands were not met, they released the database to embarrass the Raccoon team. Though the team explicitly states\n[the blackmailer was not working directly with their competitors, they did accuse Alexuiop1337 and overdot of hyping the](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/04/say-hello-baldr-new-stealer-market/)\nsituation in order to capitalize on it.\n\n_“The aforementioned user had access to the intra-team test API (dock), had all the links, had a password from the_\n_admin account, which allowed us to document the list of users and register accounts for their unfortunate pentesters._\n_Yes, our mistake was that after the reorganization of the team, we did not react quickly enough, no one expected such_\n_meanness.”_\n\n_“This person will do what it takes, for personal revenge against the project. On the launch day, he demanded money_\n_from us, threatened us, but even after that we couldn’t believe that he was capable of such baseness.”_\n\n_“We do not claim that @Alexuiop1337 and @overdot work directly with this person, but an attempt to hype this situation_\n_on behalf (of the aforementioned person)”_\n\nAdditionally, in June of 2019 raccoonstealer published an unusual post that revealed an internal feud with former team\nmembers. Allegedly, Participant 777 (777@raccoon.biz) stole $900 from the community balance and left the project.\n\n_\"Attention!_\n\n_We do not offer any services except the rental of our software! Participant 777 left the project, taking $900 from the_\n_shared common fund. There was scam attempt from the telegram account @enot_support._\n\n_In the “expe” (a Russian slang for the infamous “exploit[.]in” underground hacking community), they blacklisted the_\n_aforementioned account._\n\n**_THE ONLY CONTACTS FOR CONTACTING US!_**\n\n_Jabber: support@raccoon.biz randomuser@ucia.icu green@raccoon.biz Telegram: @ darkgr33n“_\n\n\n-----\n\nThese two incidents make it clear that Raccoon is developed by several individuals that work together, but are not\nnecessarily a tight-knit team.\n\n## Raccoon Stealer Overview\n\n### How is Raccoon Delivered?\n\nRaccoon is delivered in multiple ways, though we see Raccoon delivered most often through exploit kits, phishing\nattacks, and through bundled malware.\n\n**Delivery by Exploit Kit**\n\n[Exploit kits automatically exploit vulnerabilities on a victim’s machine while they are browsing the web. In browsing the](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/exploit-kits-shade-into-new-territory)\nweb, the user visits a malicious page that redirects to a landing page containing exploit code, often executed without the\nusers consent or interaction.\n\n[In order to deliver Raccoon, the attackers leverage the Fallout exploit kit to spawn a PowerShell instance from Internet](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/watch-where-you-browse-the-fallout-exploit-kit-stays-active)\nExplorer and subsequently download the main payload of the infostealer.\n\n_The Fallout exploit kit delivers Raccoon, as seen in the Cybereason platform._\n\n**Delivery by Phishing**\n\nPhishing is a social engineering attack where a user is tricked into executing malicious content. Most commonly, the\nuser receives an email with an attached Office document. This document contains embedded malicious macro code\nthat, when opened, executes.\n\nIn order to deliver Raccoon, the attackers use an email with an attached Word document. Upon opening the Word\ndocument and enabling macros, the macro code creates a connection to a malicious domain and downloads the main\npayload of the infostealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The malicious Word document downloading the Raccoon stealer payload, as seen in the Cybereason platform._\n\n**Delivery by Bundled Malware**\n\nBundled malware is malware that is bundled with legitimate software downloaded from “shady” websites. The bundled\nmalware is often hidden from the user during installation or makes use of social engineering techniques to enable\ninstallation.\n\nIn order to deliver Raccoon, the attackers use legitimate software bundled with the main payload of the infostealer to\ninfect unsuspecting users. Raccoon installs itself behind-the-scenes, hidden from the user.\n\n### Exploring Raccoon’s Code and Core Functionality\n\n_The internal path from malware compilation on the attackers machine._\n\nAs mentioned above, the Raccoon team appears to be of Russian origin. A typo found in the internal path also suggests\nthey are not native English speakers.\n\n_The Raccoon team issuing a recommendation for a third-party crypter._\n\n[The main payload of Raccoon is not packed and does not include built-in anti-debug or](https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/367-anti-reverse-engineering-protection-techniques-to-use-before-releasing-software) [anti-VM protections. It is sold](https://www.cyberbit.com/blog/endpoint-security/anti-vm-and-anti-sandbox-explained/)\n_as-is without any protection from analysts or detection. However, the Raccoon team does recommend a third-party_\n[crypter call GreenCrypt to evade antivirus products and protect against detection and analysis.](http://greencrypt.io/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Raccoon s Communication with its C2 Server**\n\nOnce the loader executes on the target machine, it unpacks itself in memory and connects to its C2 server. Raccoon\nsends a POST request with Base64-encoded parameters bot_id and config_id.\n\n_Raccoon sending a POST request with two parameters._\n\nUpon successful connection and verification of Raccoon’s Bot ID, it downloads a compressed zip file with multiple\ndifferent DLLs. These DLLs are not necessarily malicious on their own, but Raccoon depends on them to successfully\ncollect and steal data on the target machine.\n\n**Gathering Local Settings on the Target Machine**\n\n_The Raccoon stealer code checks the target machine’s local settings._\n\nHowever, the Raccoon stealer does check the target machine’s local settings and compare it against a list of languages,\nincluding Russian, Ukrainian, Belarussian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Armenian, Tajik, and Uzbek. If the target machine’s local\nsettings match one of these languages, the malware immediately aborts. This is common practice by malware\n[originating from CIS countries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States)\n\n**Collecting Sensitive Data**\n\nAfter initial infection, the Raccoon stealer uses several methods to collect sensitive information. It stores any sensitive\ninformation it finds in the Temp folder.\n\n**Capturing Screenshots from Infected Machine**\n\n_The Raccoon stealer code takes a screen capture of the target machine_\n\n\n-----\n\nRaccoon takes a screen capture of the target machine using GetDesktopWindow and CreateCompatibleBitmap, and\nstores it as screen.jpeg in the Temp folder.\n\n**Stealing System Information**\n\nRaccoon collects system information from the infected machine, including username, IP address, language settings, OS\nversion, information on installed apps, and CPU and memory information. The information is stored in a text file found\nin:\n\n_C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\machineinfo.txt_\n\n_Information collected by the Raccoon Stealer._\n\n**Stealing Browser Information**\n\nA lot of saved browser data is stored within SQLite database files on a local machine. For example, when a user saves\ntheir username and password in the browser, the browser stores the data in a Login Data SQLite database file. The\nbrowser also stores cookie information in a cookies file, and other autofill data, like credit card data, in a Web Data file.\n\nRaccoon steals this information from over thirty different browser types. It searches the registry software hive for\ninstalled browsers and steals credentials, cookies, and autofill data from targeted browsers.\n\nBrowsers Targeted by the Raccoon Stealer\n\nChrome Amigo RockMelt Sputnik\n\nChromium Orbitum 360Browser Kometa\n\nXpom Bromium Vivaldi uCozMedia\n\nComodo Nichrome Opera QIP Surf\n\nEpic Privacy Browser CocCoc Suhba Chedot\n\nCentBrowser Elements Browser Safer Technologies - Secure Browser Superbird\n\n7Star TorBro Rafotech - Mustang Torch\n\n\n-----\n\nFirefox WaterFox SeaMonkey Pale Moon\n\nGO!\n\n_Example of Raccoon’s browser stealing configuration code_\n\nRaccoon copies targeted browser data files to the Temp folder with random names. It uses a DLL, SQLite3.dll,\ndownloaded from its C2 server to parse the files and extract sensitive data. The stolen information is divided into several\ntext files named after their associated browser and saved under Temp/browsers.\n\nRaccoon also creates one master file with the name passwords.txt that contains any and all passwords stolen from the\nvictim’s machine.\n\n_Example of the format of passwords.txt, containing passwords stolen by Raccoon._\n\n**Stealing Outlook Accounts**\n\n_Raccoon’s code to extract information about Microsoft Outlook accounts._\n\nRaccoon extracts information about Microsoft Outlook accounts from registry keys on the target machine.\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Outlook\\OMI Account Manager\\Accounts\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows Messaging\nSubsystem\\Profiles\\Microsoft Outlook Internet Settings\n\n\n-----\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows Messaging\nSubsystem\\Profiles\\Outlook\n\nIn addition, Raccoon searches the Windows Registry for sensitive information stored in Mail clients, such as usernames\nand passwords, then saves it to a text file under Temp/mails.\n\n_Raccoon gathering information from Mail client accounts on the target machine._\n\n**Stealing Cryptocurrency Wallets**\n\nRaccoon searches for multiple cryptocurrency wallets on the machine, including:\n\nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Electrum\\wallets\nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Jaxx\\Local Storage\nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Exodus\\exodus.wallet\nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ethereum Wallet\n\nIf any cryptocurrency wallets are found, they are saved under Temp.\n\nFor the convenience of the client, Raccoon has a service that automatically processes all cryptocurrency wallets without\nneeding to search for specific logs among all the stolen data.\n\n**New features to come?**\n\nCurrent versions of Raccoon do not have keylogging functionality. Several users in the underground community are\nasking for this feature, and the Raccoon team has suggested it may be available in the future.\n\n_Screenshot from the underground community of the Raccoon team considering adding support for keylogging._\n\n### Data Exfiltration & Self Deletion\n\nRaccoon saves all stolen data to a zip file gate.zip and sends the information to its C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_All stolen data Raccoon has collected on the target machine._\n\nAfter it successfully exfiltrates all sensitive data, Raccoon deletes its binary from the victim’s machine, as can be seen in\nthe following screenshot of Raccoon’s process spawning cmd.exe with ping.exe and executing the deletion command.\n\n_The malicious process Raccoon creates to delete any trace on the machine._\n\n## How is Raccoon Affecting Businesses and Individuals?\n\nBased on the logs for sale in the underground community, Raccoon is estimated to have infected over 100,000\nendpoints worldwide within a few months. It is easy to operate for technical and nontechnical individuals alike, lending it\nmass appeal. Moreover, the team behind Raccoon is constantly working to improve it and provide responsive service. It\ngives individuals a quick-and-easy way to make money stealing sensitive data without investing a lot of funds or having\na deep technical background.\n\nRaccoon collects a wide swath of information, including credit card information, cryptocurrency wallets, usernames and\npasswords, and browsing data, which is used to steal corporate data, money, and other sensitive information. This data\n[is used against victims as blackmail or monetized by cybercriminals selling it in underground communities.](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/billion-dollar-computer-malware-industry)\n\n## Cybereason Vs.

Based on testimonials from the underground community, The Raccoon team\nprovides reliable customer service to give cybercriminals a quick-and-easy way to commit cybercrime without a huge\npersonal investment.\n\nThis has not come without strife. The team has faced several public disputes in underground forums, and has received\nsome criticism from competitors. Despite this, Raccoon has quickly become one of the top ten mentioned malware in\nthe underground community, despite being launched in early 2019. Overall, sentiment around Raccoon is positive, with\nsome calling it the best replacement available for the now defunct Azorult infostealer.\n\nRaccoon’s popularity combined with its limited feature set yet high adoption speaks to a growing trend of the\ncommoditization of malware, as malware authors shoot to create platforms for crime instead of committing the crimes\ndirectly. As malware authors choose to develop MaaS, they must partake in many of the same activities as a legitimate\nSaaS business: marketing efforts, relying on positive reviews, responsive customer support, and regularly improving\nfeatures in their product. We only expect this trend to continue into 2020 and push the evolution of MaaS forward.\n\n**_Endpoint protection is key to defending against techniques like these._** **_Learn more during our webinar on_**\n**_Endpoint Protection Platforms._**\n\n## APPENDIX\n\n### INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n_[Review the Indicators of Compromise for the Raccoon Stealer here.](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/Indicators%20of%20Compromise/Raccoon%20-%20Indicators%20of%20Compromise.pdf)_\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES BREAKDOWN\n\n\n**Initial**\n**Access**\n\n**Spear**\n**[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/)**\n**Attachment**\n\n**Drive-by**\n**Compromise**\n\n**Exploitation**\n**[for Client](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/)**\n**Execution**\n\n\n**Execution** **Defense**\n**Evasion**\n\n\n**Discovery** **Collection** **Exfiltration** **Command**\n**and Control**\n\n\n**System Time**\n**Discovery**\n\n**Account**\n**Discovery**\n\n**File and**\n**[Directory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)**\n**Discovery**\n\n\n**Execution**\n**[through](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/)**\n**API**\n\n**Command-**\n**Line**\n**Interface**\n\n\n**Software**\n**Packing**\n\n**Deobfuscate**\n**/ Decode**\n**Files or**\n**Information**\n\n**Obfuscated**\n**[Files or](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)**\n**Information**\n\n\n**Credential**\n**Access**\n\n**Credential**\n**Dumping**\n\n**Credentials**\n**in Files**\n\n**Input**\n**Capture**\n\n\n**Data from**\n**[Local](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)**\n**System**\n\n**Screen**\n**Capture**\n\n\n**Data**\n**Encrypted**\n\n\n**Remote File**\n**Copy**\n\n**Standard**\n**[Cryptographic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1032/)**\n**Protocol**\n\n**Standard**\n**Non-**\n**[Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/)**\n**Layer**\n**Protocol**\n\n\n-----\n\n**System**\n**[Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)**\n**Discovery**\n\n**Query**\n**Registry**\n\n**Process**\n**Discovery**\n\n**System**\n**[Owner/User](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/)**\n**Discovery**\n\n**Remote**\n**[System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/)**\n**Discovery**\n\n**System**\n**Network**\n**Configuration**\n**Discovery**\n\n\n**Standard**\n**Application**\n**Layer**\n**Protocol**\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n**Cybereason Nocturnus**\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team has brought the world’s brightest minds from the military, government intelligence,\nand enterprise security to uncover emerging threats across the globe.
