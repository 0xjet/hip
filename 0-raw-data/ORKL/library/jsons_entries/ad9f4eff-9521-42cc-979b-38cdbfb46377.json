When Redline is executed, the value is extracted first.\nAfter that, the information is collected and leaked by referring to the configuration data received\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom the C2 server, and the collected information is composed of Environment Details and\n**Credential Details. The collected information includes system information, browser credentials,**\ncrypto wallet information, FTP information, Telegram and Discord information, etc.\n\nAfter collecting and leaking information, Redline Stealer also has the ability to download\nexecutable files and perform additional malicious actions.\n\n## Introduction of Redline Stealer\n\nSince its release in February 2020, Redline Stealer has been delivered through various\nchannels. Redline Stealer is mostly distributed through Phishing Emails or malicious software\ndisguised as installation files such as Telegram, Discord, and cracked software. However,\nrecently, Phishing Link that downloads Chrome Extension containing Redline Stealer by\nabusing is utilized, or Python Script that runs Redline Stealer through FTP is being distributed.\n\n\n-----\n\nIssues related to Redline Stealer\nAccording to BleepingComputer released in October 2020, Redline Stealer was distributed\nthrough malicious links posted on YouTube Video Description related to free downloading of\nspecific utility.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline via YouTube Video Description Link (Source: )\n\n## Redline Stealer in DDW\n\nRedline Stealer first appeared in a Russian-based forum in February 2020. The user with the\nnickname “REDGlade” posted the promotion article and has been updating the version of\nBuilder and Panel until at least January 2022. Redline Stealer is being rented for $100 per\nmonth and sold for $150 per month and $800 for a lifetime. Additional services, such as\nscanner and crypto subscription, appear differently depending on the cost.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe builder program of Redline Stealer is sold by the official seller on the DDW forum, but also\nby other users who sell the cracked version of Redline Stealer. In addition, some users sell only\nthe collected Redline Stealer Logs.\n\nRedline Stealer Promotion Article\n\n## Redline Stealer’s Pricing Policy\n\nRENT ($100 / a month)\n\n1 month of cryptor @spectrcrypt_bot (autocrypt + scanner)\n\nLITE ($150 / a month)\n\n\n-----\n\n1 month of crypt subscription\n\nPRO ($200 / forever)\n\n3 months of scanner subscription\n3 months of cryptor @spectcrypt_bot\n\n## Channels operated by Redline Stealer Seller\n\nTelegram channels operated by the Redline Stealer official seller are divided into 3 categories:\n**Official Page, Official Chat, and Buy Redline bot. Announcement and updated information**\nare posted on the Official Page channel, chat is freely available on the Official Chat channel,\nand Redline Stealer is sold on the Buy Redline bot.\n\n**Redline Stealer Telegram Channel**\n\n@REDLINESTEALER — Official page\n@REDLINE_EN — Official Chat\n@REDLINESUPPORT_bot — Buy Redline bot\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer Telegram Channel: Official Page\n\n## Cracked Redline Stealer & Log Seller\n\nAs Redline Stealer is an infostealer malware used by attackers a lot, there are several cracked\nversions, and other stealers derived from it. In addition, stealer logs collected through Redline\nStealer are sold on the DDW forums, and they account for the largest portion of infostealer logs.\n\n\n-----\n\nCracked Redline Stealer Sales Post\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer Log Sales Post\n\n## Redline Stealer Update Information\n\nRedline Stealer Seller notifies update information on Telegram channel. As of January 2022, it\nhas been updated to Builder v23, Panel v3.3.4. The main update information posted so far is\nshown in the table below.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer Major Update\nEspecially among the updates in May 2020 to June 2020, supporting *.scr extension and\nadded Browser Extension Wallet **information were also applied to issues related to NFT**\nhacking that occurred in June 2021. At that time, most of the victims infected by Redline Stealer\nhad *.scr extension. Also, the victims’ stolen crypto wallets were leaked by Redline Stealer.\n\n## Malware analysis\n\n Sample Information\n\nFile Name: 9882_1643998124_6086.exe\nFile Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows\nMalware Type: Redline Stealer v22\nMD5: d81d3c919ed3b1aaa2dc8d5fbe9cf382\nSHA256: cd3f0808ae7fc8aa5554192ed5b0894779bf88a9c56a7c317ddc6a4d7c249e0e\n\n\n-----\n\n## Redline Stealer Execution Flow\n\n1. The attachment in phishing mail contains cracked software with Redline Stealer.\n2. When the cracked software is executed, Redline Stealer is also executed in the\n\nbackground.\n3. Encoded data such as C2 Server IP and Unique ID are decoded along with the XOR key\n\nand used for C2 communication.\n4. After finishing the decoding process, Redline Stealer requests configuration data from the\n\nC2 Server.\n\nEntity2: a structure that stores configuration data.\n\n5. The C2 Server transmits configuration data to the infected PC.\n\n6. Information is collected from the infected PC referring to stored configuration data.\n\nEntity7: a structure that stores collected results. (Environment Details + Entity1)\nEntity1: a structure that stores Credential Details.\n\n7. The information is leaked twice.\n\nEnvironment Details including infected PC information\nCredential Details including crypto wallet, accounts, and user data information\n\n8. Collected information is converted into XML format and transmitted to the C2 Server through\nSOAP Message.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer Execution Flow\n\n## Configuration of C2 Communication\n\n**Redline Stealer with WCF**\n\nThe framework Redline Stealer uses for C2 communication is WCF(Windows Communication\nFoundation). WCF is a system that allows endpoints to exchange messages and communicate\nacross multiple computers connected to the network.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt least one endpoint must be configured to use WCF. When configuring the endpoint, three\nelements are required: Address, Binding,and Contract. ‘Address’ is the address providing the\nservice, ‘Binding’ is the information related to the communication protocol used to access the\nservice, and ‘Contract’ defines the service interface. The WCF Client can call the service\ndefined as Service Contract, and when a specific method is called, a method of the same name\nimplemented in the server is called. [ServiceContract] keyword, a service interface, is used to\ndefine the contract, [DataContract] keyword is used to define a data structure to be transmitted,\nand [OperationContract] keyword is used to define the function of the service.\n\nWCF Communication\n\n\n-----\n\nThe previous Redline Stealer used BasicHTTPBinding() for communication. However, from\nRedline Stealer v22 updated in August 2020, the communication protocol was changed to\nNetTcpBinding(). NetTcpBinding() has a performance advantage compared to\nBasicHTTPBinding() because SOAP messages are binary encoded and delivered.\n\nRedline Stealer collects information by specifying a Service Contract named Entity and defines\n24 Operation Contracts and 17 Data Contracts. When a method defined as Operation Contract\nis called from an infected PC to the C2 Server, a method of the same name implemented on the\nC2 Server is called. At this time, ‘Entity7 result’ is delivered to the C2 Server.\n\nWCF Service Call/Response\n**Decoding C2 Server and Unique ID**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Redline Stealer, the encoded C2 Server address and Unique ID are hard-coded. Therefore,\nwhen the malware is executed, they are decoded and used for C2 communication.\n\nHardcoded data\n\nC2 Server address: Dw0oGCQnJh4tByxCDjRVWScZLlUvOTwJDDZcUA\nUnique ID: DyMgXCcJKlcvBwJB\nMessage: “”\nVersion: 1\n\nDecoding Process\n\nFromBase64 → XOR → FromBase64\nXOR Key: Agamis\n\nDecoding Result\n\nC2 Server address: 62.182.159.86:65531Unique ID: 405794696Message: “”\nVersion: 1\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoding Method: Read()\n**Communication Method**\n\nAs mentioned, Redline Stealer uses WCF for C2 communication.\n\nEndpoint Configuration: Address & Binding\n\nAddress: net.tcp//62.182.159.86:65531/\nBinding: NetTcpBinding()\n\nEndpoint Configuration: Contract\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer has a Service Contract named Entity, 17 Data Contracts that define the\nstructure to store information, and 24 Operation Contracts that define the functionality of the\nservice. Among them, the description of the Data Contract storing information is shown in the\ntable below.\n\n(*Functional descriptions for each Operation Contract are described in Appendix.)\n\nData Contract List\n\nTry to connect\n\nAfter configuring the endpoint, Redline Stealer tries to connect with the C2 Server and receives\nthe response. Redline Stealer periodically checks whether it maintains a connection with the C2\nServer during execution.\n\n## Configuration Data Request/Receive\n\n**Request configuration data**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Redline Stealer requests configuration data that specifies what information to collect, and\nincludes the paths and keywords required to collect browser and local file information, and the\nname of crypto wallets to be explored.\n\n**Response configuration data**\n\nThe configuration data is stored in Entity2 and used to collect information to be leaked. The\nconfiguration data consists of Flag indicating whether each item is collected and Setting\nindicating paths and keywords for collecting files.\n\n## Collected information\n\n\n-----\n\n**Way to collect and store information**\n\nThe information collected from the infected PC is stored in Entity7. Entity7 includes\nEnvironment Details and Entity1, and Entity1 separately stores Credential Details information.\nEach item in Entity1 uses the structure of Entity3~Entity5, Entity8~Entity12, and Entity14 to\nstore related information. At this time, Entity1 may or may not be used depending on Redline\nStealer’s information leakage mode.\n\nA structure of Entity7\n**Way to leak information**\n\nRedline Stealer defines two ways to leak information.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Default)\n\nThe “Send Log by Parts” is a method of collecting information from the infected PC and then\npartially leaking it. That is, the collected ‘Environment Details’ are first leaked to the C2 Server\nby putting it in Entity7. In this case, each item of Entity1 is stored empty. After that, ‘Credential\nDetails’ are collected, but not stored in Entity1 and immediately leaked after being collected by\nthe item.\n\nSend Log by Parts Flow\n\nThis method stores all the collected information in Entity7 and leaks it. First, ‘Environment\nDetails’ are collected and stored in Entity7. Credential Details are then collected and stored in\nEntity1 If Environment Details and Entity1 are filled in Entity7 it is leaked to the C2 Server\n\n\n-----\n\nSend Log by Full-Flow\nThe biggest difference between the two methods is whether Entity1 is used or not. Environment\nDetails and Entity1 collected from the infected PC are stored in Entity7, while Entity1 stores\nCredential Details. In the “Send Log by Full” method, Entity1 is used to leak information at once,\nbut in the “Send Log by Parts” method, Entity1 is not used and each item of Credential Details\nis leaked as soon as it is collected.\n\nWhat method Redline Stealer uses can be checked through the “Version” value among hardcoded data. If the version is 1, “Send Log by Parts” method is used, and in other cases, “Send\n**Log by Full” method is used. In the case of the sample, since the version is set to 1, the “Send**\n\n\n-----\n\nLog by Parts method can be seen, which partially leaks the collected information to be used.\nTherefore, among the collected information, Credential Details is collected for each item and\nthen leaked immediately.\n\n**Collect Environment Details**\n\nDevice information of the infected PC is collected and stored in Entity7.\n\nEntity7 includes hardware information, Unique ID, machine name, OS information, available\nlanguages, monitor information, IPv4, the malware file location, Redline Stealer infection\nhistory, and monitor screenshots where each item of Credential Details (Entity1) excluding\nmonitor screenshots is stored empty.\n\n**Leak Environment Details**\n\nEnvironment Details stored in Entity7 result prepares to access service via Id6() method.\nThereafter, the collected information is leaked by calling the defined [OperationContract] Id4()\nmethod. Upon receiving the leaked information, the C2 Server sends a response to the infected\nPC, which is stored and delivered in Entity13. The response type can be divided into\nUnknown(Entity13.Id1), Success(Entity13.Id2), RepeatPart(Entity13.Id3),\nNotFound(Entity13.Id4)\n\n\n-----\n\nPreparing to leak information\n\n(Left) / Leaked information after accessing service (Right)\n**Collect & Leak Credential Details**\n\n‘Credential Details’ are leaked whenever one item is collected. The information leakage process\nis the same as ‘Environment Details’ leakage process, but there is a difference in the\ninformation delivered to the C2 Server. Each item of Credential Details is leaked by calling the\n\n\n-----\n\nmatched [OperationContract] Id#() method. When the C2 Server receives information, it sends\na response to the infected PC, which is the same type of response it receives when\nEnvironment Details is leaked.\n\n\n-----\n\nPreparing to leak information (Left) / Leaked information after accessing service (Right)\n**Result: Collected Information**\n\nTargets collected by Redline Stealer are largely divided into infection device information,\ninstallation information, crypto wallet information, account information, User Data information,\nand local file information. In the case of crypto wallet information, in addition to the crypto wallet\nlist specified in configuration data, the installed Browser Extension Wallet list is checked to\ncollect related information. The table summarizing the collected information by type is as\nfollows.\n\nSummarizing of collected information by type\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRedline Stealer is one of the most popular infostealers along with Vidar, Raccoon, and\nFicker.\nLogs stolen through Redline Stealer are the most traded logs on DDW Forums.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer has been updating versions until recently, and continuous analysis is\nneeded in that the structure of Redline Stealer is gradually changing according to major\nupdates.\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Description of each Operation Contract function.**\n\n**Chromium-based Browser List**\n```\nBattle.net, Chromium, Chrome, Opera Software, ChromePlus, Iridium, 7Star, CentBrowser,\nChedot, Vivaldi, Kometa, Elements Browser, Epic Privacy Browse, uCozMedia, Sleipnir5,\nCitrio, Coowon, liebao, QIP, Orbitum, Comodo Dragon, Amigo, Torch, Yandex, 360Browser,\nMaxthon3, K-Melon, Sputnik, Nichrome, CocCoc, Uran, Chromodo, Mail.Ru, BraveSoftware,\nEdge, VIDIA GeForce Experience, Steam, CryptoTab Browser\n\n```\n**Gecko-based Browser List**\n```\nFirefox, Waterfox, K-Meleon, Thunderbird, Comodo, Cyberfox, BlackHaw, Pale Moon\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Browser Extension Wallet List**\n```\nYoroiWallet, Tronlink, NiftyWallet, MetaMask, Coinbase, BinanceChain, BraveWallet,\nGuardaWallet, EqualWallet, JaxxxLiberty, BitAppWalllet, iWallet, AtomicWallet, Wombat,\nAtomicWallet, MexCx, GuildWallet, SaturnWallet, RoninWallet, TerraStation,\nHarmonyWallet, Coin98Wallet, TonCrystal, KardiaChain, Phantom, Oxygen, PaliWallet,\nBoltX, LiqualityWallet, XdefiWallet, NamiWallet, MaiarDeFiWallet, Authentiator\n\n```\n**Methods collecting Environment Details**\n\n**Methods collecting Credential Details**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Redline Stealer IoCs\n\nd81d3c919ed3b1aaa2dc8d5fbe9cf382 |\ncd3f0808ae7fc8aa5554192ed5b0894779bf88a9c56a7c317ddc6a4d7c249e0e\naf90600728c9d3d1270dd4da39a0f9e5 |\n38a5b96fd07f03041f6eff913b85fc621fa314e1de87326accb00ee218c37756\nd6e630749bdd4f16c37ca15886fc6bdc |\n020fbe48b4da34a90d3422f211aa0338681a7cb9e99292b2b9d738a354ed97de\nce70574f6c90835076d9b195e90cd275 |\nc6d48514031cc6e83445b95f9ed4e975f2cdcebc2e9cc1914605058ff7af7764\n10adb0969eb2b385d6bb8ad8e91bb0c4 |\n9ac01cc861cfe9e340c66a5cd527ab8a7e3de345b851ebcf07a7ca08eeee2f88\n\n\n-----",
