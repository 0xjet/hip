We follow a real case involving**\n**the REvil ransomware - from initial infection and negotiation, through to the**\n**cryptocurrency payment and laundering of the funds.**\n\nThe scale and severity of ransomware attacks continue to grow. Cybercriminal groups such\n[as DarkSide have received hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency ransom](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/darkside-ransomware-has-netted-over-90-million-in-bitcoin)\n[payments, having crippled critical infrastructure providers such as Colonial Pipeline. In early](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/elliptic-follows-bitcoin-ransoms-paid-by-darkside-ransomware-victims)\nJuly, hundreds of businesses were infected with REvil ransomware (also known as\nSodinokibi), through an attack on Kaseya - a provider of IT management software to those\nvictims.\n\nAt Elliptic, we monitor and investigate ransomware groups in order to collect information on\nthe cryptocurrency wallets they use to receive ransoms. These insights are then made\n[available in our software, enabling law enforcement to follow the money and potentially](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions)\nfreeze the funds or identify the individuals behind the attacks. Cryptocurrency exchanges\n[and financial institutions use our software to screen customer deposits for links to these](https://www.elliptic.co/customers/crypto-businesses)\nwallets, and ensure that the ransomware groups cannot cash-out their proceeds.\n\nThis research gives us unique insights into the entire lifecycle of a ransomware attack - from\nthe initial malware infection and ransom demand, through the negotiation and payment\nprocess, and finally the laundering of the funds. In this article we follow one specific attack by\nthe Russia-linked REvil ransomware group, which took place within the past few weeks.\nSome images have been edited to protect the identity of the victim.\n\n**1. The victim is infected with the REvil malware**\n\nOnce the REvil malware has made its way onto the computer system, it encrypts the victim’s\nfiles - leaving behind a text file containing the ransom note, shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe note directs the victim to a website (the “victim portal”) on Tor (an anonymous version of\nthe internet often used to host darknet markets), to access further instructions.\n\n**2. Accessing the victim portal**\n\nThe victim portal displays the ransom demand - $50,000 in Monero, a privacy-focused\ncryptocurrency that is very difficult to trace. If the ransom is not paid within a certain\ntimeframe, the ransom will be doubled to $100,000.\n\nThe portal provides instructions on where the Monero can be purchased, and where exactly\nit should be sent:\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. Chat support**\n\nSimilar to an e-commerce site, the portal allows the victim to speak directly to REvil, through\nthe “Chat Support” tab. Here we see the victim (blue) initiate a conversation with REvil\n(green) and begin to negotiate the ransom down:\n\n\n-----\n\n**4. Verifying that paying a ransom will lead to decryption**\n\nThe victim then asks for proof that paying the ransom will work - i.e. that their files will be\ndecrypted. They upload two of their encrypted files, and REvil responds with the proof - the\ndecrypted files:\n\n**5. Requesting payment in Bitcoin instead of Monero**\n\nMany ransomware victims find it difficult to obtain the Monero required to pay a ransom (not\nmany exchanges list it, especially in the US), or do not want to pay in Monero due to\nconcerns about violating sanctions. Most of the ransomware response companies that\n\n\n-----\n\nnegotiate and pay on behalf of victims simply refuse to pay Monero ransoms.\n\nIn this case the victim has requested to pay in Bitcoin instead and REvil has allowed it, albeit\nwith a 10% surcharge. This higher amount reflects the increased risk faced by REvil when\naccepting Bitcoin payments, due to its traceability. The portal updates to show a Bitcoin\npayment address:\n\n**6. Negotiating the ransom amount**\n\nHaving already negotiated a 20% discount on the original $50,000 ransom demand, the\nvictim goes further - offering just $10,000. They claim that this is all they can pay at such\nshort notice, but the offer is rejected by REvil. The victim then says that they may be able to\nborrow some extra money, and they eventually agree on a ransom payment of $25,000.\n\n\n-----\n\n**7. Sending the Bitcoin ransom payment**\n\nThe address that the bitcoin ransom should be sent to is displayed at the top of the portal,\nbut the victim asks REvil to confirm that it is correct. Cryptocurrency payments are\nirreversible, so it is important to verify the destination address before making a transaction.\n\nThe victim sends the $25,000 in Bitcoin, and REvil confirms that they have received it:\n\n\n-----\n\n**8. The decryption tool is provided**\n\nOnce the ransom is paid, the victim portal updates to provide access to the decryptor. (Of\ncourse in general there is no guarantee that such a tool will be provided.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the victim, the process is now complete. They can use the decryptor tool to regain\naccess to their files and resume operations.\n\n**9. The Bitcoin is laundered**\n\nFor REvil the next step is to launder and cash-out the Bitcoin ransom payment. The image\n[below is from our cryptocurrency investigations software, Elliptic Forensics, showing the](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-investigations)\ndestination of the Bitcoin ransom paid by this specific victim. Most exchanges that allow\nBitcoin to be converted into traditional currency make use of Elliptic’s tools in order to trace\ncustomer deposits and ensure that they are not connected to illicit activity such as this.\n\nREvil must therefore attempt to launder the funds and break the transaction trail. They\nattempt this by “layering” the funds - splitting them and passing them through many different\nwallets, and by mixing them with bitcoins from other sources. This laundering process in this\ncase is still ongoing, but nevertheless we can already trace some of the funds to exchanges.\nThose exchanges will have information on the identities of people whose accounts received\nthe funds - providing strong leads for law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victim in this case appears to have been a small business rather than a large\ncorporation - reflected in the relatively small ransom demanded. Small businesses make up\n[50-75% of all ransomware victims, and the impact on these attacks can be catastrophic.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-secretary-warns-ransomware-attacks-rise-targets-include/story?id=77512872)\n\nAt Elliptic we believe that ransomware can be combated by limiting the degree to which the\ncriminals responsible can profit from their crimes. By mapping and understanding the\ncryptocurrency flows from ransomware wallets, we can aid law enforcement and financial\ninstitutions to identify the perpetrators and freeze their funds.\n\nJoin our upcoming webinar, on July 29: **Tracking Ransomware with Blockchain**\n**Analytics, as we discuss how and why ransomware makes use of cryptocurrency, and**\nshowcase how it can be countered using blockchain analytics - including ‘following the\nmoney’ from cybercriminal wallets.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis blog is provided for general informational purposes only.
