PyXie has been\nobserved in the wild since at least 2018 without much attention from the cybersecurity industry.\n\nPyXie has been deployed in an ongoing campaign that targets a wide range of industries. It has been seen in conjunction with Cobalt\n[Strike beacons as well as a downloader that has similarities to the Shifu banking Trojan. Analysts have observed evidence of the threat](https://securityintelligence.com/shifu-masterful-new-banking-trojan-is-attacking-14-japanese-banks/)\nactors attempting to deliver ransomware to the healthcare and education industries with PyXie.\n\nBlackBerry Cylance has conducted multiple incident response (IR) engagements in which PyXie was identified on hosts in the victim\nenvironment.\n\nKey highlights of the PyXie campaign include:\n\nLegitimate LogMeIn and Google binaries used to sideload payloads.\nA Trojanized Tetris app to load and execute Cobalt Strike stagers from internal network shares.\nUse of a downloader with similarities to Shifu named \"Cobalt Mode\".\nUse of _[Sharphound to collect active directory information from victims.](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound)_\nA custom compiled Python interpreter that uses scrambled opcodes to hinder analysis.\nUse of a modified RC4 algorithm to encrypt payloads with a unique key per infected host.\n\nThe main focus of this blog will be on PyXie RAT, but IOCs for other parts of the campaign will be listed in the Appendix.\n\n## Attack Overview\n\n_Figure 1: Loader overview_\n\n### First Stage - Loader\n\nThis campaign uses a sideloading technique leveraging legitimate applications to load the first stage components of the malware.\n\nWe have observed two different variants of malicious loaders targeting popular applications which are likely to be found on most\ncomputers:\n\nLMIGuardianDll.dll side-loaded by a signed binary (LmiGuardianSvc.exe) from LogMeIn.\nGoopdate.dll side-loaded by a signed binary (GoogleUpdate.exe) from Google.\n\nThe list of the side-loaded DLLs analyzed, in chronological order by compilation timestamp, is presented in Table 1:\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Timestamp**\n\n\n-----\n\nN/A e0f22863c84ee634b2650b322e6def6e5bb74460952f72556715272c6c18fe8e 3/17/17 12:23\n\nGOOPDATE.dll c9400b2fff71c401fe752aba967fa8e7009b64114c9c431e9e91ac39e8f79497 12/15/17 18:46\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 814357417aa8a57e43d50cb3347c9d287b99955b0b8aee4e53e12b463f7441a0 1/11/18 22:30\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 7330fa1ca4e40cdfea9492134636ef06cd999efb71f510074d185840ac16675d 6/4/18 20:44\n\nGOOPDATE.dll a765df03fffa343aa7a420a0a57d4b5c64366392ab6162c3561ff9f7b0ad5623 7/16/18 16:51\n\nGOOPDATE.dll de44656b4a3dde6e0acdc6f59f73114ce6bb6342bec0dcd45da8676d78b0042e 8/23/18 17:11\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 5937746fc1a511d9a8404294b0caa2aedae2f86b5b5be8159385b6c7a4d6fb40 11/20/18 20:35\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 56e96ce15ebd90c197a1638a91e8634dbc5b0b4d8ef28891dcf470ca28d08078 12/2/18 13:47\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 1d970f2e7af9962ae6786c35fcd6bc48bb860e2c8ca74d3b81899c0d3a978b2b 12/8/18 20:38\n\nGOOPDATE.dll d271569d5557087aecc340bb570179b73265b29bed2e774d9a2403546c7dd5ff 12/10/18 14:26\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 3a47e59c37dce42304b345a16ba6a3d78fc44b21c4d0e3a0332eee21f1d13845 1/9/19 16:58\n\nGOOPDATE.dll 3aa746bb94acee94c86a34cb0b355317de8404c91de3f00b40e8257b80c64741 1/11/19 16:51\n\nGOOPDATE.dll f9290cd938d134a480b41d99ac2c5513a964de001602ed34c6383dfeb577b8f7 1/27/19 15:36\n\nLMIGUARDIANDLL.DLL c3b3f46a5c850971e1269d09870db755391dcbe575dc7976f90ccb1f3812d5ea 4/10/19 14:22\n\nN/A ea27862bd01ee8882817067f19df1e61edca7364ce649ae4d09e1a1cae14f7cc 4/10/19 14:22\n\nGOOPDATE.dll edd1480fe3d83dc4dc59992fc8436bc1f33bc065504dccf4b14670e9e2c57a89 4/11/19 13:08\n\nLMIGUARDIANDLL.DLL 92a8b74cafa5eda3851cc494f26db70e5ef0259bc7926133902013e5d73fd285 6/19/19 14:29\n\nLMIGUARDIANDLL.DLL 78471db16d7bd484932c8eb72f7001db510f4643b3449d71d637567911ca363b 8/14/19 16:29\n\n_Table 1: Malicious side-loaded DLLs_\n\nOnce loaded by the LogMeIn or Google binary, the malicious DLL will locate its corresponding encrypted payload. It does this by taking\nthe full path it was loaded from and appending a .dat extension to it.\n\nFor example, if the malicious DLL is named LmiGuardianDLL.dll, the payload filename would be LmiGuardianDLL.dll.dat.\n\nThe encrypted payload is read from disk and then AES-128 decrypted in CBC mode by the loader. The 16-byte initialization vector (IV)\nand symmetric key are hardcoded into the DLL and can vary from sample to sample. An example of a loader using hardcoded IV and\nKey is shown in Figure 2:\n\n_Figure 2: Payload hardcoded decryption details_\n\nThe result of the decryption is the second stage payload, which is mapped into the loader process address space and executed.\n\n## Second Stage – Installation and Persistence\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second stage malware is primarily responsible for installing itself, setting up persistence, and spawning a new process to inject the\nthird stage payload. The second stage component fingerprints the victim machine by generating a Hardware ID hash. This hash is later\nused as a seed for various functions as well as an encryption key in the subsequent stages.\n\n### Hardware ID\n\nThe Hardware ID is generated by calculating the MD5 hash of an 80-byte buffer containing information collected from the system,\nincluding:\n\nA 64-byte zero-padded Process Brand string obtained through a sequence of calls to the CPUID instruction (with EAX set to\n_0x80000002, 0x80000003 and 0x80000004 values)._\nThe output values of dwNumberOfProcessors and dwProcessorType returned by a call to GetSystemInfo.\nThe volume serial number of the Operating System logical drive obtained through a call to GetVolumeInformationA.\nThe CRC32 hash of the current user obtained through a call to GetUserNameA using the ZLIB-CRC32 implementation with a seed\nof -1 (0xFFFFFFFF).\n\n_Figure 3: Buffer used to compute the Hardware ID_\n\nGiven the buffer in Figure 3, the Hardware ID would be:\n\n_66aafbed7c63b1a1d02899969d97e06f._\n\n### Mutexes\n\nTwo mutexes are created to prevent multiple payload instances from running at the same time.\n\nThe first mutex name is generated using the following algorithm:\n\nThe process infected with the second stage payload is obtained by calling the GetModuleFileNameA API, and the CRC32 of the\ncorresponding binary is computed.\nThe computed hash is XORed with the CRC32 of the currently logged-on user.\nThe hex string representation of the last hash represents the mutex name.\n\nThe second mutex is the last 28 characters of the hex representation of Hardware ID MD5 hash:\n\n_Figure 4: Mutex generated from the Hardware ID_\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nIf the process infected with the second stage payload is running with administrator privileges, the malware will attempt to escalate its\nown privileges. It does so by creating and starting a temporary service, thus respawning and running as a LOCAL SYSTEM process. To\nremain stealthy, the malware deletes the temporary service from the Service Control Manager.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe loader and its corresponding payload are copied to a subdirectory within the %APPDATA% folder. The directory is chosen from the\nlist of strings in Figure 5. Selection is made by using the CRC32 number of the Hardware ID string modulo 21(0x15) result as the index\nin the list:\n\nWireshark WinRAR VisualAssist\n\nUltraVNC TortoiseSVN TeamViewer\n\nSubversion RoboForm Notepad++\n\nMozilla Macromedia KeePass\n\nJGsoft Identities Apple Computer\n\n\n-----\n\nAnyDesk Microsoft FxCop Microsoft Corporation\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio\n\n_Figure 5: Installation targeted APPDATA directories_\n\n## Persistence\n\nPersistence is achieved by creating a registry value whose name is the hex string representation of a dynamically generated DWORD\nunder HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run registry key. The registry value is set to point to the path of the loader\nexecutable.\n\n### Injection of The Next Stage Payload\n\nThe third stage payload is decompressed with a call to RtlDecompressBuffer API and subsequently injected into a newly spawned\nprocess.\n\nThe executable targeted for injection is chosen by enumerating over the executables in the %SYSTEMROOT%\\System32 directory and\nsearching for the first one that meets the following criteria:\n\nIt is not running\nIt has a GUI subsystem\nIt has “Microsoft” in the version information\nIt is signed\n\nThe new process is spawned by using the CreateProcessA API and passing the path to the executable that loaded the seconded stage\nas the lpCommandLine parameter.\n\n## Third Stage - “Cobalt Mode” Downloader\n\nThe third stage is a downloader that has been designated Cobalt Mode based on the debug information left in some of the analyzed\nsamples. An example of the PDB path is shown in Figure 6:\n\n**_Z:\\coding\\pyproject\\compiled\\cobalt_mode\\cobalt_mode.pdb_**\n\n_Figure 6: Third stage debug information_\n\nThe primary function of Cobalt Mode is:\n\nConnecting to a command and control (C&C) server\nDownloading an encrypted payload\nDecrypting the payload\nMapping and executing the payload in the address space of the current process\nSpawning a new process for code injection\n\n_Cobalt Mode malware can carry out a series of environmental checks. It can determine if it is being run from a sandbox or virtual_\nmachine (VM), if a smart card reader is attached, and if requests are being intercepted with a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.\n\nExamining the functions and values used to make these checks revealed code overlap with the Shifu banking Trojan.\n\nThe configuration for Cobalt Mode is stored within the malware as a compressed JSON blob. A decompressed copy of the config\nextracted from our sample is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n{\n\"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 2.1; Windows NT 5.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729;\n.NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)\",\n\n\"check_extra_locale\": 1,\n\n\"mitm_host2\": \"twitter[.]com\",\n\n\"check_mitm\": 0,\n\n\"mitm_host1\": \"google[.]com\",\n\n\"referer\": \"hxxps://www.google[.]com\",\n\n\"download_url\": \"hxxps://tedxns[.]com/api/get_file/c2b469a7-d628-4804-8cca-5b734c5c6b42?hw=\",\n\n\"check_vm\": 0,\n\n\"extra_locale\": \"Ukraine\"\n\n}\n\n_Figure 7: CobaltMode configuration JSON_\n\nA request to the download_url specified in the JSON config is made to retrieve the next stage payload. The same Hardware ID\ndiscussed in the second stage analysis is passed in the request as the hw parameter. The server uses this value as a key to encrypt a\n7zip archive it returns with a modified RC4 algorithm. The archive contains a custom Python interpreter and a zip file containing the\nPyXie RAT bytecode that will be discussed later in our analysis.\n\n### Modified RC4 Algorithm\n\nThe modified RC4 algorithm used by the malware differs from regular RC4 in the way it generates its Substitution Box (S-BOX). After the\nS-BOX is initialized, the key is XORed against the S-BOX rather than using it to swap values.\n\n### Injection\n\nThe same algorithm as in the previous stage is used to select an executable in the %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32 directory, then spawn\na new process for injection. This time %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\worker.exe is used as the lpCommandLine parameter for the call to\n_CreateProcessA API:_\n\n_Figure 8: Third stage spawned process_\n\n## PyXie RAT\n\nThe final stage payload is a full-featured Python RAT compiled into an executable. Rather than using Py2Exe or PyInstaller to create an\nexecutable, the malware authors compiled their own Python interpreter that loads an archive containing the PyXie RAT bytecode from\nmemory.\n\nPyXie RAT functionality includes:\n\n**Functionality**\n\nMan-in-the-middle (MITM) Interception\n\nWeb-injects\n\nKeylogging\n\nCredential harvesting\n\nNetwork Scanning\n\nCookie theft\n\nClearing logs\n\nRecording video\n\nRunning arbitrary payloads\n\n\n-----\n\nMonitoring USB drives and exfiltrating data\n\nWebDav server\n\nSocks5 proxy\n\nVirtual Network Connection (VNC)\n\nCertificate theft\n\nInventorying software\n\nEnumerating the domain with Sharphound\n\n_Table 2: PyXie RAT functionality_\n\n[The custom interpreter is bundled with an obscure library named memzipimport which imports a zip file containing the compiled RAT](https://github.com/zyobi/memzipimport)\nbytecode directly from memory. The zip contains over 1,500 files of Python bytecode, many of which are third party libraries.\n\nThe core RAT consists of approximately 79 bytecode files.

However, after attempting to decompile them with uncompyle2 researchers](https://github.com/wibiti/uncompyle2)\nrecognized that this was not the case:\n\n_Figure 9: Uncompyle2 error_\n\nUpon closer examination, we discovered these .pyx files have had the first 8 bytes stripped. These bytes typically would contain a 4-byte\nmagic number, which denotes the version of the Python that generated them along with a 4-byte timestamp. The removal of these bytes\nis a well-known copy-protection trick aimed at preventing some tools from decompiling the files and getting access to the code.\n\nThe workaround for this is simple. All that is needed is to add the appropriate magic number and a timestamp. A quick look at the strings\nfrom the malicious interpreter indicates that it may be based on Python 2.7.15:\n\nz:\\coding\\pyproject\\python_static_2.7.15\\pyuv-1.x\\src\\common.c\n\nz:\\coding\\pyproject\\python_static_2.7.15\\pyuv-1.x\\deps\\libuv\\src\\win\\handle-inl.h\n\nz:\\coding\\pyproject\\python_static_2.7.15\\pyuv-1.x\\deps\\libuv\\src\\win\\req-inl.h\n\n_Figure 10: Strings identifying the Python version_\n\nOnce the appropriate header for Python 2.7.15 was added along with an arbitrary timestamp, researchers attempted to decompile the\n_.pyx bytecode files again. This worked better than our first attempt, but something still wasn't right. Disassembly still failed when using a_\nclean install of Python 2.7.15:\n\n_Figure 11: Disassembler error_\n\nOur exercise led researchers to believe that the interpreter may have remapped opcodes. This would prevent other interpreters from\ncorrectly parsing the bytecode generated by it.\n\n\n-----\n\nRemapping opcodes is not new. It is a technique often used by commercial applications such as Dropbox. The workaround for this is\n[well known and documented in 'pyREticʼ – In memory reverse engineering for obfuscated Python bytecode and](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-10/whitepapers/Smith/BlackHat-USA-2010-Smith-pyREtic-Reversing-wp.pdf) _Looking inside the_\n_(Drop) box. The basic premise covers compiling the same Python script in both a standard and modified interpreter. The generated_\nbytecode can then be compared to derive the remapped opcodes. This is typically straightforward if arbitrary code can be executed in\nthe modified interpreter.\n\nUnfortunately, PyXie is not a friendly Python interpreter and does not provide a mechanism to trivially run arbitrary code. Our solution\nwas to analyze the modified interpreter in IDA Pro and compare it to the Python 2.7.15 source code. By using strings for reference, it\nwas possible to locate the native PyRun_SimpleStringFlags() function. This function can be used to run Python code from an in-memory\nstring.\n\nOnce the location of PyRun_SimpleStringFlags() was found, a debugger was used to attach to the process running the PyXie interpreter.\n\nPrior to redirecting the execution to a code cave, the script we wanted compiled is dropped in the working directory. For this controlled\n[execution we used all.py from](https://github.com/kholia/dedrop/blob/master/src/dedrop/all.py) [DeDrop. Then:](https://github.com/kholia/dedrop)\n\nWrite the “import all.py” string into the memory.\nPush the address of the “import all.py” string to the stack.\nCall PyRun_SimpleStringFlags() which caused the interpreter to execute all.py and in turn emit compiled bytecode to all.pyx.\n\n_Figure 12: Code cave importing all.py_\n\nThe all.py file was then executed within the standard Python 2.7.15 interpreter to output compiled bytecode as all.pyc. The bytecode in\n_all.pyx was compared to bytecode in all.pyc to determine the remapped opcodes.

Indicators in the code lead researchers to believe that the malware authors may also be planning to add\nthe following C&C channels:\n\n_Figure 14: C&C communication channels_\n\n[C&C domains can be resolved internally via DNS servers specified in the config or by utilizing the servers from the OpenNIC Project.](https://www.opennic.org/)\n\nRecent samples we collected are configured to connect back to a subset of the following domains:\n\ntedxns[.]com\n\nbenreat[.]com\n\nplanlamaison[.]com\n\nsarymar[.]com\nteamchuan[.]com\n\nc1oudflare[.]com\n\n_Figure 15: C&C domains_\n\n[Earlier samples utilize Namecoin “.bit” domains:](https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-namecoins-and-bit-domains)\n\nathery[.]bit\n\nbabloom[.]bit\n\nfloppys[.]bit\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Namecoin .bit C&C domains_\n\nAn example of a C&C request is shown in Figure 17:\n\n_Figure 17: C&C sample request_\n\n### Commands\n\nPyXie RAT currently supports the following commands:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n!load Download and run an executable\n\n!get_config Retrieve current config\n\n!set_config Set config\n\n!update Update\n\n!update2 Update\n\n!update3 Update\n\n!get_keylog Retrieve keylog\n\n!get_cookies Retrieve cookies\n\n!get_sysinfo Retrieve system info\n\n!scan_lan SMB scan local network\n\n!scan_lan_ex SMB scan specified IP ranges\n\n!webdav Start WebDAV server\n\n!webdav_stop Stop WebDAV server\n\n!active_sk Start SOCKS5 server\n\n!deactive_sk Stop SOCKS5 server\n\n!active_bc Start HVNC module\n\n!deactive_bc Stop HVNC module\n\n!eval Download and execute Python code\n\n!self_destruct Uninstall RAT\n\n!get_screens Retrieve Screenshots\n\n\n-----\n\n!mem_load Download and execute DLL in memory\n\n!shellcode Download and execute shellcode\n\n!get_passwords Dump passwords with LaZagne\n\n!docfind Retrieve file\n\n!filefind Find files matching certain criteria\n\n!del_cookies Clear cookies\n\n!export_certs Retrieve certificates from certificate store\n\n!del_keylog Clear keylog\n\n!reboot Reboot system\n\n!check_soft Check for installed software\n\n!install_ffmpeg Download ffmpeg binaries\n\n!record_video Record video with ffmpeg\n\n!shell Run command and capture output\n\n!kill_lgmn_tokens Retrieve LogMeIn credentials\n\n!get_lgmn_tokens Clear LogMeIn credentials\n\n!sharphound Enumerate domain with Sharphound\n\n!bot_hashes Retrieves hashes of loader and DLL\n\n!mimi_32 Download Mimikatz\n\n!mimi_64 Download Mimikatz\n\n!mimi_grab Execute Mimikatz\n\n!get_kdbx Retrieve keepass databases\n\n!research_domain SMB scan of computers identified by Sharphound\n\n!research_full SMB scan and port scan of computers identified by Sharphound\n\n!wipe_rdp_creds Clear RDP creds\n\n_Table 5: RAT commands_\n\n## Configuration\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration for PyXie RAT is stored as an encrypted JSON blob. Fernet algorithm is used for the encryption and the symmetric key\nis base64 encoded and hardcoded in config.pyx as the internal_key variable. A full sample of the decrypted configuration JSON can be\nfound in the Appendix.\n\nFor the majority of samples analyzed, the following internal_key value was used:\n\n**_eJxLsnDOzElOLyrOsvTKrrQsNUspNoxISfMxDE1y043IydGtMAhyNMkNMy/OtgUAVu0OyQ==_**\n\n_Figure 18: Configuration snippet_\n\n## Tool.exe – Trojanized Tetris Game\n\nOur researchers have also observed PyXie RAT being deployed by and in conjunction with Cobalt Strike and a custom shellcode loader.\nWe’ve also seen evidence of this loader being used in several Ransomware incidents.\n\n[The loader is a Trojanized open source Tetris game. It has been modified to load an encrypted shellcode payload named “settings.dat”](https://github.com/VincentJYZhang/tetris-game)\nfrom an internal network share and inject it into a new process:\n\n_Figure 19: Trojanized Tetris Game_\n\nThe payload is decrypted using a single-byte XOR with the key 0xFA, and it is injected into a new process using the same injection\nroutine previously described in our analysis of the Second Stage – Installation and Persistence and Third Stage - “Cobalt Mode”\nDownloader components:\n\n_Figure 20: Payload being loaded from a network share and decrypted_\n\nIn the cases that we have observed, the encrypted payloads have been Cobalt Strike stagers that connect back to one of the servers\nlisted below:\n\nfearlesslyhuman[.]org\n\n185[.]82[.]202[.]109\n\nfoods-pro[.]com\n\ndopearos[.]com\n\n_Figure 21: Cobalt Strike servers_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPyXie RAT has been quietly lurking in systems since at least 2018. It has been observed targeting a wide range of industries while\nsuccessfully maintaining a low profile.\n\nThe PyXie RAT developers take a number of steps to obfuscate key components. In our analysis, we covered the different stages of the\nmalware and shared the techniques we used to analyze the custom Python interpreter with remapped opcodes. We also provided a\nnumber of indicators that can help identify an infection.\n\nBlackBerry Cylance uses artificial intelligence-based agents trained for threat detection on millions of both safe and unsafe files. Our\nautomated security agents block PyXie RAT based on countless file attributes and malicious behaviors instead of relying on a specific\nfile signature. BlackBerry Cylance, which offers a [predictive advantage over zero-day threats, is trained on and effective against both](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/cylance-vs-future-threats-the-predictive-advantage.html)\n[new and legacy cyberattacks.
