Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence this actor is linked to\nIran, which is notable given the strong focus on shipping and the ongoing naval conflict\nbetween Iran and Israel. While we believe this actor is focused on intelligence collection, the\ncollected data may be leveraged to support various activities, from hack-and-leak, to\nenabling kinetic warfare attacks like those that have plagued the shipping industry in recent\nyears.\n\nMandiant assesses with moderate confidence that UNC3890 conducts espionage and\nintelligence collection activity to support multiple Iranian interests and operations. Targeting\npatterns indicate a strong interest in Israeli entities and organizations of various sectors,\nincluding government, shipping, energy and healthcare. We observed several limited\ntechnical connections to Iran, such as PDB strings and Farsi language artifacts.\n\nThis campaign has been active since at least late 2020, and is still ongoing as of mid-2022,\nand though it is regional in nature, targeted entities include global companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nUNC3890 uses at least two unique tools: a backdoor which we named SUGARUSH, and a\nbrowser credential stealer, which exfiltrates stolen data via Gmail, Yahoo and Yandex email\nservices that we’ve named SUGARDUMP. UNC3890 also uses multiple publicly available\ntools, such as the METASPLOIT framework and NorthStar C2.\n\nIn addition, Mandiant discovered UNC3890 operates an inter-connected network of\nCommand-and-Control (C2) servers. The C2 servers host domains and fake login pages\nspoofing legitimate services such as Office 365, social networks such as LinkedIn and\nFacebook, as well as fake job offers and fake commercials for AI-based robotic dolls. We\nobserved the C2 servers communicating with multiple targets, as well as with a watering hole\nthat we believe was targeting the Israeli shipping sector, in particular entities that handle and\nship sensitive components.\n\nThis blog post details the activity of UNC3890, including their proprietary malware, TTPs we\nhave not previously seen deployed by Iran, and the publicly available tools we identified in\nour investigation. Mandiant continues to track UNC3890 as well as other potentially related\nclusters of activity by the same threat actor.\n\n### Attribution\n\nMandiant uses the label “UNC” groups – or “uncategorized” groups – to refer to a cluster of\nintrusion activity that includes observable artifacts, such as adversary infrastructure, tools,\nand tradecraft that we are not yet ready to give a classification such as TEMP, APT, or FIN\n[(learn more about how Mandiant tracks uncategorized threat actors). Mandiant found no](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors)\nsignificant connections between UNC3890 and other clusters of activities we currently track,\nand therefore sees it as a standalone group. However, we identified several connections\nsuggesting the activity is conducted by an Iran-nexus group:\n\nUsage of Farsi words, as observed in strings left by the developers in the newest\nversion of SUGARDUMP, for example “KHODA” (the Farsi word for “God”) and “yaal”\n(the Farsi word for a horse’s mane).\nFocused targeting of Israeli entities and organizations, or organizations operating in\nIsrael, consistent with other clusters of activity operated by Iranian threat actors,\nspecifically UNC757.\nUsage of the same PDB path as another Iranian cluster of activity Mandiant tracks as\nUNC2448 (operated by the Iranian IRGC, according to public sources), publicly\n[referred to in a U.S. government statement from November 17, 2021. Several](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\n[publications suggested that UNC2448 is linked to APT35/Charming Kitten cluster of](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/)\nactivities, which according to several public sources is operated by the Iranian Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). UNC2448 has been targeting Israeli entities as\nwell, among other countries of interest to Iran.\n\n\n-----\n\nUtilization of NorthStar C2 Framework, a C2 framework preferred by other Iranian\nactors . However, since it is a publicly available framework used by multiple threat\nactors, we consider this link circumstantial.\n\n### Targeting\n\nIn late 2021, Mandiant identified UNC3890 targeting Israeli entities and showing interest in\nvarious sectors, including government, shipping, energy, aviation and healthcare. Even\nthough the targeting we observed is focused to Israel, some of the entities targeted by\nUNC3890, especially in the shipping sector, are global companies. Therefore, the potential\nimpact of UNC3890 activity described in this blog may extend beyond Israel. The activity is\nconsistent with historical Iranian interest in these targets. Targeting patterns and lures used\nby UNC3890 indicate an attempt to disguise their activity as legitimate login activity,\nlegitimate services and social network applications, and technology-related visual content.\n\n### Malware Observed\n\nMandiant observed UNC3890 deploy the following malware families.\n\n\n**Malware**\n**Family**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nSUGARUSH SUGARUSH is a backdoor written to establish a connection with an\nembedded C2 and to execute CMD commands.\n\nSUGARDUMP SUGARDUMP is a credential harvesting utility, capable of password\ncollection from Chromium-based browsers.\n\n\nSUGARDUMP\nSMTP-based\n\nSUGARDUMP\nHTTP-based\n\n\nA more advanced version of SUGARDUMP, exfiltrating the stolen\ncredentials via Gmail, Yahoo and Yandex email addresses. Uses a\ncommercial for robotic dolls as a lure.\n\nThe newest version of SUGARDUMP, exfiltrating the stolen credentials to\na dedicated server over HTTP. Uses a fake job offer as a lure.\n\n\nMETASPLOIT METASPLOIT is a penetration testing software, often abused by\nmalicious threat actors.\n\nUNICORN UNICORN is a publicly available tool for conducting a PowerShell\ndowngrade attack and to inject a shellcode into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nNORTHSTAR\nC2\n\n\nNORTHSTAR C2 is an open-source C2 framework developed for\npenetration testing and red teaming.\n\n\n### Outlook and Implications\n\nUNC3890 has been operating since at least late 2020. Their focused targeting poses a threat\nto Israel-based organizations and entities, particularly those affiliated with the government,\nshipping, energy, aviation and healthcare sectors. While we are not aware of targeting\noutside Israel, it is possible such targeting has occurred, or will occur. UNC3890 utilization of\nlegitimate or publicly available tools, in addition to their unique exfiltration method using\nGmail, Yahoo and Yandex email addresses, may reflect their efforts to evade detection and\nto bypass heuristics or network-based security measures.\n\n### UNC3890 Attack Lifecycle\n\n**Establish Foothold**\n\nWhile Mandiant primarily identified post-exploitation implants utilized by UNC3890, there are\nsome findings that shed light about their initial access methodologies. Mandiant identified\nUNC3890 potentially used the following initial access vectors:\n\n**Watering holes – Mandiant identified a potential watering hole hosted on a login page**\nof a legitimate Israeli shipping company, which was likely compromised by UNC3890.\nThe watering hole was active at least until November 2021, and upon entering the\nlegitimate login page, the user would be sending a POST request with preliminary data\nabout the logged user to an attacker controlled non-ASCII Punycode domain\n(lirıkedin[.]com, interpreted as xn--lirkedin-vkb[.]com).\n\nThe URL structure of the POST request:\n\n_hxxps[:]//xn--lirkedin-vkb[.]com/object[.]php?browser=<user_browser>&ip=<user_ip>_\n\nWhen we inspected the watering hole, it was already inactive, but it was most likely used to\ntarget clients and users of that Israeli shipping company, in particular, one’s shipping or\nhandling heat-sensitive cargo (based on the nature of the compromised website). We have\nan additional indication of an attempted targeting of another major Israeli shipping company\nby UNC3890, which is consistent with the watering hole.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Credentials harvesting by masquerading as legitimate services – we uncovered**\nseveral domains resolving to UNC3890’s C2 servers. Some of the domains were\nmasquerading as legitimate services and entities, as can be observed in the table\nbelow. UNC3890 may have used these domains to harvest credentials to legitimate\nservices, to send phishing lures, or to overall mask their activity and blend in with\nexpected network traffic.\n\nIt should be noted that many of these domains were hosted on the same infrastructure used\nby UNC3890, but date back to late 2020, which is before we can corroborate UNC3890 has\nbeen active.\n\n**UNC3890 Domain** **Legitimate entity/service** **Comment**\n\n\nlirıkedin[.]com (xn-lirkedin-vkb[.]com)\n\n\nLinkedIn C2 domain of\nwatering hole\n\n\npfizerpoll[.]com Pfizer Hosted a fake\nCitrix login\npage\n\nrnfacebook[.]com Facebook\n\noffice365update[.]live Office 365\n\nfileupload[.]shop n/a\n\ncelebritylife[.]news n/a\n\n\nnaturaldolls[.]store Part of a robotic dolls commercial which was used\nto harvest credentials and as a lure to install\nSUGARDUMP\n\nxxx-doll[.]com\n\n\nHosts a fake\nOutlook login\npage\n\n\nIn addition, we identified an UNC3890 server that hosted several ZIP files containing scraped\ncontents of Facebook and Instagram accounts of legitimate individuals. It is possible they\nwere targeted by UNC3890, or used as lures in a social engineering effort.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: A fake Outlook Web Access login page hosted on UNC3890’s domain\nnaturaldolls[.]store\n**Fake job offers, potentially as part of a phishing or watering hole campaign – we observed**\nUNC3890 utilize a .xls lure file designed as a fake job offer (MD5:\n639f83fa4265ddbb43e85b763fe3dbac) which installs SUGARDUMP, a credential harvesting\ntool. The job offer was for a software developer position in LexisNexis, a company offering a\ndata analytics solution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: A fake LexisNexis job offer which drops SUGARDUMP\n\n**Fake commercials for AI-based robotic dolls – one of UNC3890’s most recent**\nendeavor to target victims includes the usage of a video commercial for AI-based\nrobotic dolls, used as a lure to deliver SUGARDUMP. In addition, we observed\nUNC3890 usage of domains with similar themes such as naturaldolls[.]store (hosting a\nfake Outlook login page) and xxx-doll[.]com. In addition, UNC3890 infrastructure\nhosted a fake page for the alleged purchasing of robotic dolls, redirecting victims to an\nattacker controlled infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: a screenshot taken from the social engineering video played when SUGARDUMP\nexecutes\n\nFigure 4: HTML page hosted on UNC3890 infrastructure, with references to purchasing of\nrobotic dolls\n\n**Post-Exploitation: From Credentials Harvesting to Full Access and Control**\n\nAfter gaining initial access, UNC3890 utilizes a broad toolset to access and control the\nvictim’s environment. In this sector we will focus on the analysis of two of UNC3890’s\nproprietary tools we identified in our investigation: the SUGARUSH backdoor, and the\nSUGARDUMP credential harvesting tool. We will also provide a brief analysis of the public\ntools utilized by UNC3890.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the tools were available for download directly from UNC3890 controlled\ninfrastructure, indicating they may have been served as 1 stage implants. Alternatively, theyst\nmay have been used as 2nd stages (or later), but UNC3890 may have misconfigured their\ninfrastructure, making it publicly accessible.\n\nSUGARUSH Analysis: A Small But Efficient Backdoor\n\nSUGARUSH is a small custom backdoor that establishes a reverse shell over TCP to a\nhardcoded C&C address.\n\nUpon first execution, SUGARUSH will create a new service called “Service1”. Subsequently,\nSUGARUSH creates a logging folder called “Logs”, and stores it under its current execution\npath. A new folder named\n\n“ServiceLog” is created in the “Logs” folder, and a new log file is written with the message\n“Service is started at <current_date>”. The name of the log files is the current date of the\ninfected machine.\n\nSUGARUSH will then check for internet connectivity of the host and will create a log file\nindicating the result with message “You are online at <current_date>” or “You are offline at\n<current_date>”. If the attempt for internet connection is successful, SUGARUSH will\nestablish a new TCP connection to an embedded C&C address via port 4585.\n\nSUGARUSH then waits to receive an answer from the C2 which will be interpreted as a CMD\ncommand for execution.\n\nSUGARUSH Samples:\n\n37bdb9ea33b2fe621587c887f6fb2989\n3f045ebb014d859a4e7d15a4cf827957\na7a2d6a533b913bc50d14e91bcf6c716\nd528e96271e791fab5818c01d4bc139f\n\nSUGARDUMP Analysis: A Browser Credential Harvesting Tool\n\nSUGARDUMP is a small custom utility used for harvesting credentials from Chrome, Opera\nand Edge Chromium browsers.\n\nWhen executed SUGARDUMP will access the following paths:\n\n%AppData%\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\n%AppData&\\\\Opera Software\\\\Opera Stable\n%AppData%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Edge\\\\User Data\n\nOut of each path SUGARDUMP will attempt collect specific folders:\n\n\n-----\n\n\\\\Default\\\\Login Data\n\\\\Login Data\nAny other folder that has the string “Profile” in its name.\n\nAfterwards, SUGARDUMP will extract all of the available usernames and passwords from\nthese folders.\n\nThe collected information is subsequently stored in the following format:\n\nFigure 5: SUGARDUMP exfiltrated data format\nWe observed several versions of SUGARDUMP:\n\nSUGARDUMP first known version, dated to early 2021. This early version stores the\ncredentials without exfiltrating them. It is possible it was an unfinished version, or that\nUNC3890 used other tools and/or manually connect to the victim to exfiltrate the stolen\ncredentials.\nSUGARDUMP using SMTP-based communication, dated to late 2021-early 2022. This\nversion utilizes Yahoo, Yandex and Gmail addresses for exfiltration, and uses a\ncommercial AI-driven robotic dolls as a lure.\nSUGARDUMP using HTTPs-based communication, dated to April 2022. This version\nuses a fake NexisLexis job offer as a lure.\n\n**SUGARDUMP first known version – dated to early 2021, we observed two variants of this**\nversion: the first one saves the stolen credentials under in a .txt file under the path:\n“C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Desktop\\\\test2.txt”. The second variant prints the stolen credentials as a\nCMD output.\n\nWe observed two PDB paths contained in SUGARDUMP samples:\n\n**C:\\Users\\User\\source\\repos\\passrecover\\passrecover\\obj\\Release\\passrecover.pdb –**\nwe observed a similar PDB path (the part in bold) used in a toolset (for example, MD5:\n69b2ab3369823032991d4b306a170425) by UNC2448, an actor affiliated with Iran,\nwhich was mentioned in a U.S. government statement in November 17, 2021. Since\nthis is a rather generic PDB path, this similarity may be circumstantial, and we consider\nit a weak link.\nC:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\sourc\\Chrome-Password-Recovery-master\\Chrome-PasswordRecovery-master\\obj\\Debug\\ChromeRecovery.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\n**SUGARDUMP using SMTP for C2 communication – dated to late 2021-early 2022. This**\nvariant was downloaded from a known UNC3890 C2 (URL: hxxp://128.199.6[.]246/3-VideoVLC.exe), and is a slightly more advanced version with similar credential harvesting\nfunctionality.\n\nThe downloaded file “3-Video-VLC.exe” (MD5: ae0a16b6feddd53d1d52ff50d85a42d5) is a\nWindows installer which, upon execution, drops and executes two files under the path\n%AppData%\\\\Roaming\\\\:\n\n1. CrashReporter.exe (MD5: 084ad50044d6650f9ed314e99351a608) – a browser\n\ncredential harvesting tool (SUGARDUMP).\n2. RealDo1080.mp4 (MD5: d8fb3b6f5681cf5eec2b89be9b632b05) – a social engineering\n\nvideo, played using Windows Media Player while CrashReporter.exe is executed. The\nvideo contains a commercial for AI-driven robotic dolls.\n\nUpon first execution, CrashReporter.exe (SUGARDUMP) attempts to locate the folder:\n_%AppData%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Edge\\\\User Data\\\\CrashPad\\\\_\n\nIf it wasn’t found it will search for folder: %AppData%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Internet\n_Explorer\\\\TabRoaming\\\\_\n\nIf the latter folder is not found as well, the malware proceeds to create it. The malware will\nthen copy itself into “TabRoaming” folder again under the name “CrashReporter.exe”.\nSubsequently, a scheduled task is created, which ensures the persistence of this version of\nSUGARDUMP:\n\nIn Windows 7 the scheduled task is called:\n\"MicrosoftInternetExplorerCrashRepoeterTaskMachineUA\", and contains the\ndescription \"Keep your Microsoft software without any bugs. If this task is disabled or\n_stopped, your Microsoft software may not work properly, meaning bugs that may arise_\n_cannot be fixed and features may not work.”_\nIn other Windows OS versions the scheduled task is called:\n\"MicrosoftEdgeCrashRepoeterTaskMachineUA\", and contains the description “Keep\n_your Microsoft software without any bugs. If this task is disabled or stopped, your Edge_\n_browser may not work properly, meaning bugs that may arise cannot be fixed and_\n_features may not work.”_\n\nThe scheduled task is configured to execute CrashReporter.exe during user logon.\n\nThe malware then attempts to connect to “smtp.yandex.com” and “smtp.mail.yahoo.com” via\nport 587. If the attempt is successful, the malware starts to harvest bowser related\ninformation on the host.\n\nThis version of SUGARDUMP harvest credentials from the following browsers:\n\n\n-----\n\nFirefox (added functionality with relation to the previous version)\nChrome\nOpera\nEdge\n\nFor each browser the malware attempts to extract login credentials from the following paths:\n\n%Appdata%\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\n%Appdata%\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\n%Appdata%\\\\Opera Software\\\\Opera Stable\n%Appdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Edge\\\\User Data\n\nThis version of SUGARDUMP also extracts the browser’s version, browsing history,\nbookmarks, and cookies.\n\nThe extracted data structure looks as follows:\n\nFigure 6: Exfiltrated data format of SUGARDUMP\nThe collected data is subsequently encoded using base64 and stored under: %\n_<malware_execution_folder>%\\\\CrashLog.txt_\n\nThe malware will then send the file “CrashLog.txt” via email, by connecting and sending it\nfrom one of the two following email addresses:\n\n\n-----\n\njohn.macperson2021@yandex[.]com\njohn.macperson2021@yahoo[.]com\n\nThe email is sent to one of these four email addresses:\n\njohn.macperson2021@yandex[.]com\njohn.macperson2021@yahoo[.]com\njohn.macperson2021@gmail[.]com\njohn.macperson@protonmail[.]com\n\nThe subject for each message would be “VLC Player”, with “CrashLog.txt” attached.\n\nIf SUGARDUMP fails to send the message, it creates a new file under: %\n_<malware_current_execution_path>%\\\\CrashLogName.txt, and writes to the file the error_\ndetails. \"CrashLogName.txt\" is also sent via email, using the same method mentioned\nabove. Afterwards, the malware terminates its execution.\n\n**SUGARDUMP using HTTP for C2 communication – dated to April 2022, this version**\nsends the stolen credentials to an UNC3890 C2 server (144.202.123[.]248:80). We observed\nthis version dropped by a .xls file which contains a fake job offer to a software developer\nposition in NexisLexis, a data analytics platform (MD5:\n639f83fa4265ddbb43e85b763fe3dbac).\n\nThe .xls file contains a Macro, which upon enablement attempts to execute an embedded PE\nfile using RunDLL (MD5: e125ed072fc4529687d98cf4c62e283e). The PE file is the newest\nversion of SUGARDUMP we observed so far.\n\nLike previous versions, this version of SUGARDUMP harvests credentials from Chromiumbased browsers Chrome, Opera and Edge. The data is saved in a new file under\n_%TEMP%\\\\DebugLogWindowsDefender.txt._\n\nThe collected data is subsequently encrypted using AES encryption using Cipher Block\nChaining (CBC) mode. The encryption key is the Sha256 of an embedded password:\n“1qazXSW@3edc123456be name KHODA 110 !!)1qazXSW@3edc”. The word “KHODA”\nmeans god in Farsi.\n\nAfter the encryption process, the data is also encoded using Base64, and subsequently sent\nover HTTP to an UNC3890 C2 server: 144.202.123[.]248:80.\n\nThe .NET project for this version of SUGARDUMP was named \"yaal\", which is the Farsi word\nfor a horse’s mane. This, along with the use of the word “KHODA” in SUGARDUMP’s\nencryption key, may strengthen the possibility that the developers of SUGARDUMP are Farsi\nspeakers.\n\nSUGARDUMP
