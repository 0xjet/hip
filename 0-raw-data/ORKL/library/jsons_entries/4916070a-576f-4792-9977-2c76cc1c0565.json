But certainly not the last.\n\n**[macworld.com/article/3234650/macs/keranger-the-first-in-the-wild-ransomware-for-macs-but-certainly-not-the-last.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/3234650/macs/keranger-the-first-in-the-wild-ransomware-for-macs-but-certainly-not-the-last.html)**\n\nBy Liviu Arsene,\n\nRansomware has been one of the most lucrative threats for cybercriminals. With the FBI\n[estimating financial losses were up $1 billion dollars in 2017 alone, by the end of 2018 it’s](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&url=https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/how-ransomware-turned-into-a-billion-dollar-business-15981.html&xcust=1-1-230621-1-0-0&sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/230621/keranger-the-first-in-the-wild-ransomware-for-macs-but-certainly-not-the-last.html)\nreasonable to speculate that those numbers will be significantly higher.\n\nAlthough most ransomware targets systems running Windows, Mac ransomware became a\nreality when Brazilian researchers posted a proof-of-concept (dubbed Mabouia) in early\n2015. Whether by coincidence or design, the first truly damaging ransomware sample for\nMacs emerged about a month later, delivered using a tampered version of a popular filesharing application known as Transmission.\n\n**The Keranger Mac Ransomware**\n\n\n-----\n\nDubbed Keranger, the Mac ransomware had the same ability as its Windows counterpart,\nmeaning once loaded it could encrypt locally stored files, documents, and even Time\nMachine backups while demanding a bitcoin payment for the decryption key.\n\nAlthough Macs have a built-in system that prevents installation of unauthorized or un-signed\n[applications from third-party marketplaces, the Keranger ransomware was bundled inside](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&url=https://labs.bitdefender.com/2016/01/third-iteration-of-linux-ransomware-still-not-ready-for-prime-time/&xcust=1-1-230621-1-0-0&sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/230621/keranger-the-first-in-the-wild-ransomware-for-macs-but-certainly-not-the-last.html)\nTransmission – a torrent application – after attackers managed to breach the official\nTransmission website and replace the legitimate .dmg file with a tampered version.\n\nInterestingly, to dodge GateKeeper’s app validation mechanism, attackers signed the\ntampered Transmission app with a valid Apple developer certificate, making it seem\nlegitimate. Unsuspecting users who visited the official website and installed the application\nwhile it was live became the first-ever Mac ransomware victims.\n\n**More Evidence of Mac Ransomware**\n\nWhile Keranger was the first “in-the-wild” and documented ransomware outbreak for Macs, it\nwas not the last, by far. Security researchers have identified a ransomware-as-a-service that\nenabled interested “customers” to purchase Mac-hostile ransomware in exchange for upfront payments or shared revenue from infected victims.\n\nWhile ransomware-as-a-service is not uncommon for Windows-based systems, its\nemergence for Macs suggests an increased interest from “customers” to start buying\nransomware kits that can be deployed on Mac OS.\n\nA great example that further bolsters the case of Mac ransomware-as-a-service: the\nKeranger’s source code is publicly available to anyone interested in writing their own variant\nof Mac ransomware—and its developer only asks for 30% of what the “customer” gets from\npaying victims.\n\nStaying away from both ransomware and any other type of Mac threat is a simple matter of\n[installing a Mac security solution that can accurately identify potentially malicious](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&url=https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html?cid=ban%7Cc%7CArticle%7CMacWorld%7Cus&xcust=1-1-230621-1-0-0&sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/230621/keranger-the-first-in-the-wild-ransomware-for-macs-but-certainly-not-the-last.html)\napplications or threats. This type of security solution also keeps Mac users safe from\nphishing, fraudulent, or malware-serving websites that might trick users into installing or\nrevealing sensitive data.\n\n_Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small_\n_commission.
