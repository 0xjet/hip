TwoFace++](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/twoface-twoface/)\n\nSummary\n\nUnit 42 is well aware of the OilRig threat group conducting testing activities on their tools prior to their use in active\noperations. We first discussed OilRig’s testing activity in our April 2017 blog OilRig Actors Provide a Glimpse into\nDevelopment and Testing Efforts, which provided an analysis of the changes made to the Clayslide delivery\ndocuments in order to evade detection.\n\n[On November 15, 2017, we observed an OilRig developer testing the TwoFace webshell, which we first wrote](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/twoface/)\n[about in in our July 2017 blog TwoFace Webshell: Persistent Access Point for Lateral Movement. We specifically](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/07/unit42-twoface-webshell-persistent-access-point-lateral-movement/)\nobserved the developer testing a version that we that we call the TwoFace++ variant.\nIn this blog, we will provide an analysis of the testing activities carried out in this series of testing, which clearly\nshows the developer making changes to the TwoFace webshell and looking for increases and decreases in the\ndetection rate to determine the detected content. Please reference our previous blog titled TwoFace Webshell:\nPersistent Access Point for Lateral Movement for details on the construction and functionality of the TwoFace\nwebshell.\n\nTesting Activity\n\n[As in our previous analysis of OilRig testing activities, our analysis of this testing activity began with gathering a](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/)\ncollection of related TwoFace loader samples. For this blog, we included only the TwoFace loader samples that\nwere created specifically to determine what security vendors detect within the TwoFace loader script. We used the\n[same methodology to analyze the testing activity as previous OilRig testing activities, specifically by comparing](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/)\neach file in sequence to see the changes the developer made in each iteration of testing.\n\nThe flowchart in Figure 1 has similar elements to the flowchart we included with our previous analysis of OilRig\ntesting activities. However, we have changed the decisions (diamond shapes) in the flowchart to more closely\nreflect the activities we observed in the testing of TwoFace. The testing of TwoFace did not stop when the\n\n\n-----\n\ndeveloper successfully reduced the detection rate to 0, as the developer continues to make modifications to\ndetermine the exact code within TwoFace that caused detection. The developer only ceases testing activities when\nthey know exactly what the security vendors are using to detect the script.\n\n_Figure 1 Flowchart of OilRig's process of testing TwoFace_\n\nTesting Analysis\n\nThe testing activity started on November 15, 2017 at 8:51 AM and ended at 9:07 AM (UTC), which resulted in the\ndeveloper making 22 modifications to the TwoFace loader script in sixteen minutes throughout the iterations of\n[testing. If you recall from our previous research, TwoFace is comprised of two parts: a loader script and an](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/07/unit42-twoface-webshell-persistent-access-point-lateral-movement/)\nembedded payload webshell. The observed testing activity focused on the TwoFace loader script, which is\nresponsible for obtaining a decryption key from inbound requests, decrypting an embedded webshell and saving\nthe decrypted webshell to the webserver.\n\nTable 1 shows the files created during the iterations of testing activity, along with their filename and the number of\nvendors detecting the file as malicious. The delta column shows the time between each testing iteration, which\n\n\n-----\n\nshows that the developer was rapidly making changes to these files. Also, there is a noticeable pattern in the\nfilenames with a majority of the names being “out2.aspx”, but “out1.aspx”, “in1.aspx” and “w1.aspx” being used as\nwell.\n\n**Iteration** **Date** **Delta (min:sec)** **SHA256** **Filename** **AV**\n\nBase 11/15/17 8:00 4be8a58d4bd73af4d4e2... out1.aspx 3\n\n1 11/15/17 8:02 01:30 23dd0e94999d9f7dc764... in1.aspx 3\n\n2 11/15/17 8:04 02:02 da280d5b0955fc1dce27... out2.aspx 2\n\n3 11/15/17 8:14 09:41 e7963620205f52b5e264... out2.aspx 2\n\n4 11/15/17 8:14 00:55 387738ad7e732ad3b63a... out2.aspx 2\n\n5 11/15/17 8:20 05:18 a443f6918d4ea0caca0b... out2.aspx 0\n\n6 11/15/17 8:21 01:27 bd0d9f267318da819791... out2.aspx 1\n\n7 11/15/17 8:23 02:06 fcecc7392b8a51c215f5... out2.aspx 0\n\n8 11/15/17 8:25 01:18 bc76fea3f9b549799f73... out2.aspx 0\n\n9 11/15/17 8:27 02:16 a6c62217c27a0bc0a5d9... w1.aspx 0\n\n10 11/15/17 8:28 01:22 9fd3672c9d3d43755495... out2.aspx 1\n\n11 11/15/17 8:40 12:05 d3983d0bccd38b6198f9... w1.aspx 0\n\n12 11/15/17 8:42 01:19 5979506165bb489dae08... out2.aspx 0\n\n13 11/15/17 8:43 00:50 3b2546a57b6edf57c7dc... out2.aspx 0\n\n14 11/15/17 8:44 01:00 9ecd1f1761988994511a... out2.aspx 0\n\n15 11/15/17 8:45 01:04 fc35c1b6524969320365... out2.aspx 0\n\n16 11/15/17 8:46 01:27 59155e0db84ca2aa4a4f... out2.aspx 0\n\n17 11/15/17 8:47 00:57 aa8be54babad2c70d51a... out2.aspx 0\n\n18 11/15/17 8:48 00:46 e3f1e7021604e7d7a7a7... out2.aspx 1\n\n19 11/15/17 8:53 05:08 65d744d907c8d69100ba... out2.aspx 1\n\n20 11/15/17 8:56 03:32 672a43ef6914f6090c20... out2.aspx 1\n\n21 11/15/17 9:07 10:08 03e2c6850887702ae70d... out1.aspx 1\n\n22 11/15/17 9:07 00:49 3e0c251962976395fff4... out1.aspx 0\n\n11/15/17 9:09 01:27 3efe6ed1864fa36df9d4... 2222.aspx 0\n\n_Table 1 Samples associated with OilRig's testing of TwoFace loader shell_\n\nWe have included analysis of all the changes made throughout the testing activities in the iterations listed in Table\n1 in the Appendix; however, it is important to discuss the more interesting activities we observed during testing. The\nmost important observation is the developer systematically removes lines of code until they observe a change in\ndetection rate, specifically a decrease to locate the lines of code that are used by security vendors for detection.\nOnce they determine the line of code detected, they add the line of code back but in a modified state and look for a\nchange in the detection rate, specifically an increase to see if they can determine the specific data within that line of\n\n\n-----\n\ncode that is detected.\nWe see this general process of making changes and monitoring for increases and decreases in detection rate\nthroughout the activity. Using this process, the developer was able to first determine that the cause of detection\nrelied on the encoded and encrypted data for the embedded webshell. The developer was able to determine that\ndetection did not solely rely on the embedded webshell. Rather, the detection was based on both the embedded\nwebshell and a line of code that allowed an actor to update the embedded payload webshell by writing the encoded\nand encrypted data to be used as the embedded payload to the TwoFace loader file. The developer ended testing\nwith a zero-detection rate by leaving the encoded and encrypted data for the embedded webshell unchanged, but\nremoved the embedded payload update functionality within the TwoFace loader script.\n\nPossible TwoFace++ Embedded Payload\nAs you may have noticed, Table 1 has 24 files listed for the 22 iterations of testing, which seems one too many. The\nlast file in Table 1, specifically 2222.aspx is not a TwoFace loader sample, rather it is another webshell entirely. It\nappears the developers refer to this as DarkShell based on the string in the authentication routine of\n“DarkShellPasswordSet”. We are tracking this webshell under the name DarkSeaGreenShell, as the webshell has\na table border color set to “darkseagreen” and DarkShell has already been used to track another malware family.\n\n_Figure 2 DarkSeaGreenShell's user interface_\n\nWe believe the 2222.aspx may be a variant of the payload webshell embedded within the TwoFace loader samples\nseen in testing activities. We cannot confirm as we have been unable to decrypt the 3DES encrypted payload\nwebshell in the TwoFace loader scripts seen during testing. However, the 2222.aspx file is 8,213 bytes in size and\nthe decoded ciphertext of the embedded webshell in the TwoFace files is 8,224 bytes in length. While the two differ\nby 11 bytes, it is possible the differences in sizes was caused by changes made to the webshell prior to testing. We\nknow a developer modified the 2222.aspx file to some extent, as the authentication routine within the webshell\nsuffers from obvious logic errors that appear to be the result of a developer attempting to determine what is causing\ndetection.\n\nFor example, the ‘chk’ function seen in the code block below authenticates inbound requests to the webshell,\nhowever, this function contains several major errors that break the authentication mechanism. As you can see from\n\n\n-----\n\nthe code block, successful authentication requires the Base64 encoded SHA1 hash of a password in the pass\nvariable match the hardcoded string “DarkShellPasswordSet.” A successful match is impossible, as there is no\nSHA1 hash that can be Base64 encoded to match the “DarkShellPasswordSet” string.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\n\nprotected bool chk(string pass)\n{\ntry\n{\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.SHA1 sha = new\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();\nbyte[] hash = sha.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pass));\nstring aut = Convert.ToBase64String(new\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.SHA1CryptoServiceProvider().ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(pass)));\n\nif (aut != \"DarkShellPasswordSet\")\n{\nthis.__VIEWP.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;\nreturn false;\n}\nelse\n{\nthis.__VIEWP.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Green;\nreturn true;\n}\n\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\nLabel1.Text = ex.Message;\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n\n\nWe believe the developer made changes to this authentication routine during testing activities. To test its\nfunctionality (and to generate the screenshot in Figure 2), we had to modify the webshell’s code to successfully\nauthenticate. The changes to portions of the authentication routine in DarkSeaGreenShell may explain the 11-byte\ndifference in size between the 2222.aspx file and the payload embedded within the TwoFace loader test files.\n\nConclusion\nThe OilRig threat group continues to test their toolset systematically and methodically prior to use. Based on our\nanalysis, the developer used very similar processes to test the TwoFace loader script that we previously saw in the\n[testing activities of the Clayslide macros. The process involves testing each file, making modifications to the file,](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/)\nretesting the newly modified file, and checking for increases and decreases in the detection rate. The testing of the\nTwoFace loader script clearly shows the developer attempting to determine exactly what lines of code are causing\ndetection. The testing also shows the developer attempting to modify the lines of code that were detected in order\nto evade detection while maintaining functionality. At the end of testing, the developer just removed the ability for\nan actor to remotely update the embedded payload within the TwoFace loader script. We believe the developer\nchose to remove this functionality to evade detection, as an actor could just deploy the embedded payload\nwebshell within the TwoFace loader script and upload a new TwoFace loader script to satisfy the same\nfunctionality.\n\nAppendix\n\nThe subsections in this appendix will provide details of each iteration of testing of the TwoFace loader script.\nAdditionally, we provide our analysis of the changes the developer made in each iteration. We also provide a\n\n\n-----\n\nscreenshot of the differences made to the TwoFace loader script generated using Github s unified diffing\nfunctionality, where lines of code with red backgrounds were removed during the iteration, the lines of code with a\ngreen background were added and the lines of code with a white background remained the same.\n\nIteration 1\n**Files: 4be8a58d4bd73af4d4e2741a31b30ad16a733ce824afe445277c92ae5de08ab4  vs**\n23dd0e94999d9f7dc764615f230d24180dc623cf89e06997743d68f51e3ce163\n**Filenames: out1.aspx vs in1.aspx**\n**Delta: 1 minute 30 seconds**\n**Positives: 3 -> 3**\n**Analysis:**\nIn the first iteration, the actor removes the HTML tags that surround the core TwoFace loader code, including the\n'Page Language=\"C#\"' header.

These changes lowered the detection rate to 0, which suggests to the developer that the detections are\noccurring on the embedded webshell's encoded ciphertext.\n\nWe believe the developer formatted the script using pretty print to make it easier to make granular modifications to\nthe script in upcoming iterations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Changes made in iteration 5 of testing_\n\nIteration 6\n\n**Files: a443f6918d4ea0caca0bee8afb41e972bc5f9b7b49a1b72e8a254fdb887988ba vs**\n\n\n-----\n\nbd0d9f267318da8197913a56f240f0a0152a5ad96acddc85eed97096d42b0479\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n**Delta: 1 minute 27 seconds**\n**Positives: 0 -> 1**\n**Analysis:**\nThe developer changes the variable (\"NQkRIVFnXc\") used to store the embedded webshell to the original Base64\nencoded ciphertext of the webshell seen in the first testing sample.

Therefore, the differences between the sample generated in\nthis testing iteration compared to the initial file results in only formatting, as the current file is formatted using pretty\nprint and the original sample was not.\n\n_Figure 8 Changes made in iteration 6 of testing_\n\nIteration 7\n\n**Files: bd0d9f267318da8197913a56f240f0a0152a5ad96acddc85eed97096d42b0479 vs**\nfcecc7392b8a51c215f569bb56044409ceb4ab9beccabb6128e9458add1deac1\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 2 minutes 6 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 1 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer removes the line that sets the password salt variable (\"hnRwONTdZ\") and removes all but the first 4\nbytes of the Base64 encoded ciphertext within the variable (\"NQkRIVFnXc\") used to store the embedded webshell.\nWe believe the developer is checking to see if the password salt variable/value or the first four bytes of the\nencoded ciphertext of the webshell were causing detection.\n\n_Figure 9 Changes made in iteration 7 of testing_\n\n\n-----\n\nIteration 8\n**Files: fcecc7392b8a51c215f569bb56044409ceb4ab9beccabb6128e9458add1deac1 vs**\nbc76fea3f9b549799f73c675a5f141d32c775e6afac53a71c06124dbece65e7c\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n**Delta: 1 minute 18 seconds**\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n**Analysis:**\nThe developer reintroduces the line that sets the password salt variable (\"hnRwONTdZ\") and its original value and\nsets the variable (\"NQkRIVFnXc\") used to store the embedded webshell to an empty string.

The detection rate dropped to 0, which\nsuggests that the code used to write the embedded webshell to the system is not responsible for detection, rather\nportions of the removed lines cause detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 Changes made in iteration 11 of testing_\n\nIteration 12\n**Files: d3983d0bccd38b6198f9dcc9d0a0eec46d31ccad0e7b9575e25368e740b51a6a vs**\n5979506165bb489dae0826daa8051588f3944a711bb5c9bdff7f5cfe5b616ea3\n**Filenames: w1.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n**Delta: 1 minute 19 seconds**\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n**Analysis:**\nIn this iteration, the developer reintroduced the following portions of the TwoFace loader script that were removed\nin the previous iteration, specifically:\n\nAdded line of code used to set password salt variable (\"hnRwONTdZ\") with its original value\nAdded line of code used to get the base64 encoded password from the inbound request, decode it and saves\nit to a variable (\"BSfbQohad\")\nAdded line of code used to compare a hardcoded hash to the SHA1 of the inbound password and password\nhash for authentication\nAdded line of code used to obtain the physical path on the IIS server (\"PATH_TRANSLATED\")\nAdded line of code to check the inbound request for the filename (Request.Form[\"n\"]) to write the embedded\nwebshell\n\nThe developer omitted the lines of code responsible for checking the inbound request for data and the lines of code\nto update the embedded webshell within the file. The detection rate did not increase, suggesting that the developer\ndetermined that the detection is occurring in the code that allows for remote updating of the embedded webshell.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14 Changes made in iteration 12 of testing_\n\nIteration 13\n\n**Files: 5979506165bb489dae0826daa8051588f3944a711bb5c9bdff7f5cfe5b616ea3 vs**\n3b2546a57b6edf57c7dc3f062a79a6f18e4dbb78570eede232431b36b5c51089\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 50 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nUsing insight into the cause for detection from the previous iteration, the developer slowly reintroduces portions of\nthe code used to remotely update the embedded webshell. In this iteration, the developer reintroduces the if\nstatement that checks the inbound request for the data to use to update the embedded webshell within the file. The\ndetection rate did not change; therefore, the developer knows that this line is not causing detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15 Changes made in iteration 13 of testing_\n\nIteration 14\n\n**Files: 3b2546a57b6edf57c7dc3f062a79a6f18e4dbb78570eede232431b36b5c51089 vs**\n9ecd1f1761988994511ade39e38f22e28c9200bea3b6a1194de032d3877da757\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 1 minute**\n\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer adds another line from the code used to update the embedded webshell. The line added in this\niteration is responsible for reading the contents of the TwoFace loader webshell (path stored in 'LlGKKnqJdfya')\nand stores the contents in a variable ('cXUIJeCnEz'). The detection rate stayed the same, which suggests to the\ndeveloper that this line of code is not causing detection.\n\n_Figure 16 Changes made in iteration 14 of testing_\n\nIteration 15\n\n**Files: 9ecd1f1761988994511ade39e38f22e28c9200bea3b6a1194de032d3877da757 vs**\nfc35c1b652496932036544758d43d629696e7f33e547638b90dc9a0a0fbfd755\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 1 minute 4 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer adds another line from the code used to update the embedded webshell. The line added in this\niteration creates a variable that it stores a string. The string stored in the variable contains code used in TwoFace\nloader to initialize the variable ('NQkRIVFnXc') that stores the embedded webshell. Adding this line of code to the\nfile did not change the detection rate, which suggests to the developer that this code does not cause detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17 Changes made in iteration 15 of testing_\n\nIteration 16\n\n**Files: fc35c1b652496932036544758d43d629696e7f33e547638b90dc9a0a0fbfd755 vs**\n59155e0db84ca2aa4a4fc0c0a4f7a71446bb963e2544f131c81aa902f7c3b38d\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 1 minute 27 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer adds yet another line from the update code. The added line initializes a variable that stores the\nlength of the string stored in the variable added in the previous iteration. The detection rate did not increase based\non the addition of this line.\n\n_Figure 18 Changes made in iteration 16 of testing_\n\nIteration 17\n\n**Files: 59155e0db84ca2aa4a4fc0c0a4f7a71446bb963e2544f131c81aa902f7c3b38d vs**\naa8be54babad2c70d51a0146fd42c947f5fc0705bc9edc237f61a05275cf2f31\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 58 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 0 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer adds two more lines from the update code. The first line added finds the index of the double quote\ncharacter in the string in the line of code introduced two iterations prior. The second line of code essentially\nreplaces the embedded webshell read in from the TwoFace loader file with the data provided from the inbound\nrequest. The addition of these two lines did not change the detection rate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19 Changes made in iteration 17 of testing_\n\nIteration 18\n\n**Files: aa8be54babad2c70d51a0146fd42c947f5fc0705bc9edc237f61a05275cf2f31 vs**\ne3f1e7021604e7d7a7a7c500c2564abb5b3a9c278bd7cef131e650654ef796bd\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 46 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 0 -> 1**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer adds one more line from the update code, which is responsible for writing the variable that contains\nthe TwoFace loader script with its newly updated embedded webshell to a file. This essentially updates the\nTwoFace loader file to include a new embedded webshell. The addition of this line of code increased the detection\nrate, which lets the developer know that detection of the TwoFace loader stems from this line of code.\n\n_Figure 20 Changes made in iteration 18 of testing_\n\nIteration 19\n\n**Files: e3f1e7021604e7d7a7a7c500c2564abb5b3a9c278bd7cef131e650654ef796bd vs**\n65d744d907c8d69100bad5ce14ad780d57688eb6f0f1276bbf956711adfcea99\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 5 minutes 8 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 1 -> 1**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer now starts making changes to the line of code that writes the new TwoFace loader script to a file. In\nthis iteration, the developer does nothing more than concatenating the 2 character to the data before writing it to\nthe file. We believe the developer is testing to see if detection is based on the exact line of code, but this\nmodification did not change the detection rate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21 Changes made in iteration 19 of testing_\n\nIteration 20\n**Files: 65d744d907c8d69100bad5ce14ad780d57688eb6f0f1276bbf956711adfcea99 vs**\n672a43ef6914f6090c20c19348af1bfed05919177f1bfb03dc8dbde0c8bbd49d\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out2.aspx**\n**Delta: 3 minutes 32 seconds**\n**Positives: 1 -> 1**\n**Analysis:**\nThe developer adds two lines of code before and two lines of code after the line that writes the new TwoFace\nloader script to the file. The developer had already determined that the lines of code added in this iteration did not\ncause an increase in detection, as the lines of code added is the same as introduced in iteration 15. These\nadditions did not change the detection rate, suggesting that padding the offending line of code with additional lines\nof code did not affect the detection rate.\n\n_Figure 22 Changes made in iteration 20 of testing_\n\nIteration 21\n\n**Files: 672a43ef6914f6090c20c19348af1bfed05919177f1bfb03dc8dbde0c8bbd49d vs**\n03e2c6850887702ae70db57582653d7c31c6f92d116746c610d379014a5ff4a0\n\n**Filenames: out2.aspx vs out1.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 10 minutes 8 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 1 -> 1**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer removes the four lines of code added in the previous iteration, as well as several newlines between\nlines of code earlier in the TwoFace loader script. These changes did not affect the detection rate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23 Changes made in iteration 21 of testing_\n\nIteration 22\n\n**Files: 03e2c6850887702ae70db57582653d7c31c6f92d116746c610d379014a5ff4a0 vs**\n3e0c251962976395fff489a985290afe02175baf0cdf3d14eb3e01b3821414e9\n\n**Filenames: out1.aspx vs out1.aspx**\n\n**Delta: 49 seconds**\n\n**Positives: 1 -> 0**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe developer completely removes the update code from the TwoFace loader script. This change brings the\ndetection rate back down to 0.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24 Changes made in iteration 22 of testing_\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
