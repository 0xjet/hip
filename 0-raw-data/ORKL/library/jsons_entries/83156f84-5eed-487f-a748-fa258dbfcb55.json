This overlap could indicate that the](https://www.secureworks.com/research/revil-sodinokibi-ransomware)\n[GOLD SOUTHFIELD cybercriminal threat group that operates REvil sold the source code,](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-southfield)\nthat the source code was stolen, or that GOLD SOUTHFIELD shared the code with another\nthreat group as part of a partnership. CTU™ analysis confirmed that the GOLD\nNORTHFIELD threat group, which operates LV, replaced the configuration of a REvil v2.03\nbeta version to repurpose the REvil binary for the LV ransomware.\n\nCTU researchers have not observed LV ransomware advertisements on underground forums\nas of this publication. However, variations in partner and campaign IDs across LV\nconfigurations and the practice of naming and shaming victims could indicate that GOLD\nNORTHFIELD is launching a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offering.\n\n## LV packer\n\nThe packed LV ransomware samples identified by CTU researchers appear to use the same\nbasic crypter. Figure 1 shows the entire contents of the packed executable's main function,\nwhich contains five of the executable's nine functions.\n\n_Figure 1. Main function for the packer used to unpack and execute LV ransomware. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nThe packed executable stores the LV ransomware binary as RC4-encrypted data within a\nsection named 'enc' (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Encrypted LV ransomware binary stored in the enc section of the packer_\n_executable. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe packed samples analyzed by CTU researchers use the hard-coded\n\"kZlXjn3o373483wb6ne1LIBNWD3KWBEK\" key to decrypt the contents of the enc section.\nThe \"This program cannot be run in DOS mode\" string is removed from decrypted binaries'\nPE headers (see Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Strings removed from header of decrypted LV binary. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nOnce decrypted, the ransomware binary is copied into a new memory allocation created with\nRead/Write/Execute (RWE) access rights. The packer then executes the unpacked\n[ransomware binary by jumping to the entry point defined in the PE header.](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/2-malware-researchers-handbook-demystifying-pe-file/)\n\n## Origin and configuration\n\nThe code structure and functionality of the LV ransomware sample analyzed by CTU\nresearchers are identical to REvil. The version value in the LV binary is 2.02, its compile\ntimestamp is 2020-06-15 16:24:05, and its configuration is stored in a section named\n'.7tdlvx'. These characteristics align with REvil 2.02 samples first identified in the wild on\nJune 17, 2020. The LV sample also contains a code segment that is unique to REvil 2.03.\nThe only purpose of this code segment in REvil binary is to taunt prominent security\nresearchers. LV replaces the insults with the space character (see Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. LV code segment duplicating REvil 2.03 code but replacing strings with spaces._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThis type of code modification suggests that GOLD NORTHFIELD does not have access to\nREvil's source code. The threat actors likely used a hex editor to remove potentially\nidentifying characteristics from the binary to conceal that LV is a repurposed version of REvil.\nThe hard-coded 2.02 version value and the unique REvil 2.03 code suggests that GOLD\nNORTHFIELD used a beta version of REvil 2.03 as the basis for LV ransomware.\n\n### REvil binary repurposing\n\nThe GOLD NORTHFIELD threat actors replaced the REvil configuration stored within the\nbinary's '.7tdlvx' section with their own configuration. Successful replacement required the\nformat of the REvil and LV configurations to be identical. Figure 5 shows the LV configuration\nextracted from the REvil binary. It is a JSON-formatted string containing key elements utilized\nby REvil (e.g., sub, net, dmn, pk).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. LV configuration. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nGOLD NORTHFIELD then had to RC4-encrypt the LV configuration with a 32-byte key. To\nbypass REvil's anti-tamper control that ensures the integrity of the configuration (see Figure\n6), GOLD NORTHFIELD also had to generate a CRC32 hash of the updated encrypted\nconfiguration and then replace the hard-coded precalculated CRC32 hash stored in the\nbinary with the updated configuration's CRC32 hash. These changes are necessary because\nthe REvil code calculates the configuration's CRC32 hash value at runtime and terminates if\nthe calculated and hard-coded hashes do not match.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Configuration anti-tamper control implemented in the REvil binary. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nFinally, GOLD NORTHFIELD could add the RC4 key used to encrypt the configuration, the\nCRC32 hash of the encrypted configuration, the length of the encrypted configuration, and\nthe encrypted configuration itself to the REvil binary via the identified configuration section\n(.7tdlvx) in the defined order (see Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7. REvil configuration structure when stored in the binary. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIf done correctly, the binary will successfully execute using LV's updated configuration. Files\non the victim's system will be encrypted with session keys that are protected by LV's public\nkey, and victims will be directed to LV's ransom payment site via the updated ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Configuration comparisons\n\nCTU analysis of numerous LV configurations led to several insights:\n\nThe dmn configuration element was consistently assigned an empty string (e.g., \"dmn\":\n\"\"). In a standard REvil configuration, this value contains over 1,200 command and\ncontrol (C2) domains that the malware uses to communicate infection information to\nthe threat actor. This information can include the ransomware version, session keys\nused for file encryption, public key used to encrypt the session keys, and victims'\ndetails such as username, hostname, and region. Although the net configuration key is\nset to False in the LV samples, removal of all domains from the dmn configuration key\nensures that LV ransomware victims' data is not sent to REvil C2 servers. Removing\nthese domains rather than replacing them with C2 domains operated by GOLD\nNORTHFIELD suggests that the group may not be capable of maintaining C2\ninfrastructure or developing the backend automation required to process and track\nvictims' data.\nThe partner ID (pid) varied in some of the configurations. This variation suggests that\nGOLD NORTHFIELD could leverage this element to track individual RaaS partners,\nwhich is how GOLD SOUTHFIELD uses this element. However, LV configurations had\nmatching [bcrypted partner IDs across different configurations. Although the pid is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)\nhashed, a partner could be tracked using the bcrypted hash value. REvil generates a\nnew bcrypted hash for each configuration, making partner tracking impossible.\nThe campaign ID (sub) varied in some of the configurations. GOLD NORTHFIELD\nmight have adopted GOLD SOUTHFIELD's approach of using this element to track\nindividual campaigns or configuration builds.\nThe attacker's public key (pk) was different in each configuration. GOLD NORTHFIELD\nneeds a master encryption key pair to decrypt files encrypted by LV ransomware. The\npk rotation across configurations suggests the creation of a unique key pair for each\nvictim, which prevents file decryption across multiple victims if the attacker's private key\nis obtained.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe only ransom note (nbody) change from the standard REvil format was replacing\nREvil's ransom payment Tor domain with LV's domain (see Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8. LV ransom note. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Ransom payment site\n\nAfter accessing the ransom payment site, victims are presented with a basic form that\nrequests the key from the ransom note (see Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. LV ransom payment site key submission form. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nPrevious CTU analysis of the REvil ransom note determined that this key represents\ninformation about the ransomware infection that has been encrypted and then Base64encoded:\n\nCompromised host details:\n\nCPU architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)\nFixed-drive information (drive letter, drive type, total size, and free space)\nWorkgroup/domain\nConfigured locale, and whether it aligns with one of the specified countries where\nthe malware cannot be used\nHostname\nOperating system\nRansomware details:\n\nConfigured partner ID\nThreat actor's configured public key\nEncrypted session private key\nConfigured campaign ID\n[Unique ID based on host's volume serial number and CPUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID)\nVictim's username\nRansomware version\n\nAs of this publication, CTU researchers have identified three ransom payment Tor domains\nspecified in LV ransom notes. Each of the domains successfully loads the landing page, but\nCTU researchers' attempts to submit the key from the ransom note returned HTTP errors\n(see Table 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom payment domain** **HTTP error**\n\n\n4to43yp4mng2gdc3jgnep5bt7lkhqvjqiritbv4x2ebj3qun7wz4y2id .\nonion\n\nl55ysq5qjpin2vq23ul3gc3h62vp4wvenl7ov6fcn65vir7kc7gb5fyd .\nonion\n\n36yvrbzhbzyuzia7qxahsaw2yizcr3heljw2jtde3smyuhkokjnb2sid .\nonion\n\n_Table 1. LV ransom payment domains and HTTP errors._\n\n\n502 - Bad\nGateway\n\n403 - Forbidden\n\n403 - Forbidden\n\n\nThe HTTP errors may be caused by anti-analysis controls implemented by GOLD\nNORTHFIELD to inspect characteristics of the submitted key for suspicious or undesirable\nactivity. They may also indicate that the threat group is struggling to maintain resilient\ninfrastructure due to lack of skill or insufficient resources.\n\nWhen key submission is successful, the site displays a page showing the ransom amount in\nU.S. dollars and how much time the victim has to pay the ransom before sensitive data is\ndisclosed (see Figure 10). The page also includes a live chat function for the victim to\ninteract with the threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. LV ransom payment site. (Source:_ _[ID Ransomware blog)](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2020/10/lv-ransomware.html&prev=search&pto=aue)_\n\n## Leak sites\n\nCTU researchers identified two LV ransomware leak sites that have an identical structure but\nappear to be operated independently. The sites listed victims during the same timeframe, but\nonly one victim was listed on both sites (see Figure 11). It is unclear why GOLD\nNORTHFIELD would operate two leak sites.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Victims added to LV leak sites between March 7 and April 14, 2021. Only one_\n_victim (highlighted in yellow) was listed on both sites. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe leak sites name and shame victims. The threat actors coerce the victims into paying the\nransom by threatening to publish their sensitive information (see Figure 12).\n\n_Figure 12. LV leak site. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nGOLD NORTHFIELD typically threatens to publicly release sensitive information if victims do\nnot initiate contact within 72 hours. The threat actors post screenshots of the victim's\nsensitive files on the leak sites to support their claims. However, it appears that none of the\nvictims' data has been released as of this publication. It is unclear if victims paid the ransom\nand the threat actors just keep the full list of victims on the leak site as evidence of their\nconquests.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU analysis revealed that the LV ransomware is not a distinct ransomware family; it is\nrepurposed REvil ransomware. By modifying the binary of a prolific ransomware family, the\nGOLD NORTHFIELD threat actors significantly expedited their maturity within the\nransomware ecosystem. Without expending resources on ransomware development, the\ngroup can operate more efficiently than its competitors while still offering a best-in-class\nransomware offering, ultimately resulting in a more profitable business model. GOLD\nNORTHFIELD's unauthorized manipulation of REvil will likely prompt GOLD SOUTHFIELD\nto implement additional anti-tamper controls and modify configuration storage and\nprocessing to impede future attempts to overwrite the REvil configuration.\n\nIt is too early in GOLD NORTHFIELD's evolution to evaluate the threat it poses. The ability to\nrepurpose the REvil binary suggests that the threat actors have technical capabilities.\nAdditionally, the complexity required for this repurposing and the configuration variations\nacross LV samples suggest that GOLD NORTHFIELD may have automated the process.\nAlthough a RaaS for the LV ransomware could provide direct competition for GOLD\nSOUTHFIELD's RaaS offering, the lack of a reliable and organized infrastructure needed to\noperate a successful RaaS offering suggests that GOLD NORTHFIELD has to expand its\ncapabilities and resources to compete with other ransomware operations.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 2 can be used to detect activity related to LV ransomware.
