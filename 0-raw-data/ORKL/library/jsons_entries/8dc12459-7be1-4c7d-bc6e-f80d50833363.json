Dragos identified\nthree new activity groups adding to the five we discovered\nin 2017. This is consistent with previous Dragos\nassessments – as our capabilities in threat hunting and\nidentification of ICS-focused threats expand, we achieve\ngreater visibility into the threat landscape and can create\na more holistic picture of the threats, behaviors, and\ntradecraft affecting ICS environments.\n\nICS security risk grew in 2018 even absent any destructive\nattacks. This year, four major elements contributed\nsignificantly to greater risk:\n\n1) More numerous intrusions into ICS networks enabling\nresearch and reconnaissance of ICS operations and\ntechnology\n2) Commodity malware and wormable ransomware\ncausing ICS infections\n3) Infrastructure-targeting activity groups adopting\nLiving off the Land tactics and behaviors that bypass\ntraditional security protection mechanisms\n4) The compromise of several industrial control\nequipment manufacturers enabling potential supplychain threats and vendor-enabled access to ICS\nnetworks\n\nAdversaries using traditional malware and techniques\nto make the jump from IT to operations continued\nto be a major issue across ICS, including continued\nWannaCry infections impacting ICS environments.\nOlympic Destroyer,[1] though not specifically targeted to\nICS, provided an example of how operational systems\nmay be impacted through future wormable malware that\navoids the use of exploits.\n\n1. https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic\ndestroyer.html\n\n\nIn 2018, Dragos identified three more activity groups\ntargeting ICS: ALLANITE, XENOTIME, and RASPITE, the\nlatter of which is linked to newly-identified behavior\ntargeting US electric utilities. ALLANITE targeting also\nincludes electric utilities in the US, in addition to UK\nentities. XENOTIME, the activity group associated with\nTRISIS, expanded its operations beyond the Middle\nEast and the Triconex safety instrumented system\nincluding compromising several ICS manufacturers.\nDragos also identified new behaviors and victimology\nfrom adversaries first discovered in 2017.\n\nDragos identified no new malware with life-threatening\nor ICS-specific destructive capabilities. However,\nnumerous intrusions into ICS networks stole the\ntype of information that would be valuable to future\nICS-disruptive capabilities such as HMI screenshots\nand process historian information. We anticipate\nincreased risk of operational losses due to incidental\nmalware infections in ICS environments; the results of\nmishaps during initial intrusion and reconnaissance\noperations within the OT realm; and new disruptive\nattacks based on the results of increasing research\nand reconnaissance activity. Malicious activity is\nincreasing, and it will have large impacts – but there\nare people hard at work securing infrastructure to\ndefend against the growing threat landscape.\n\nThis year Dragos championed private sector collectives\nlike the Cyber Threat Alliance[2] and government\ncooperation to promote critical infrastructure\ncybersecurity.[3] Recognizing that smaller entities\nprovide an environment for adversaries to train and\nprepare undetected, as well as localized attacks,\nDragos also began work on Neighborhood Keeper,[4]\na research and development effort done in concert\nwith the Department of Energy, Idaho National Labs,\nthe Electric ISAC, Ameren, First Energy, and Southern\nCompany, to bring affordable threat detection\ntechnology and shared insight to a broader set of\ninfrastructure providers.\n\nFurther, Dragos provided a variety of public resources\nincluding monthly webinars[5] and ICS security training\nfor practitioners looking to expand their knowledge of\nICS and threats facing these industries.\n\n3. https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/3/\n\nfull-committee-hearing-to-examine-cyber-security-in-our\n\n-----\n\n## THREATS\n### IN DETAIL\n\n###### Dragos witnessed a concerning number of ICS\n\n\n###### DISRUPTIVE IT MALWARE\n\n\n## THREATS\n### IN DETAIL\n\n\n###### Dragos witnessed a concerning number of ICS threats targeting vendors, integrators, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and other third-party OT players. Of all threats, the following are the most concerning to Dragos.\n\n MID-POINT NETWORK ACCESS\n\n SUPPLY CHAIN/ THIRD-PARTY COMPROMISE\n\n SIGNIFICANT  TTPS\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Disruptive IT Malware\n\nIT malware impacting operations is not new or unique,[6] and Dragos expects these types of infections will continue\nto be prevalent for years to come due to ease of use, effectiveness within enterprise environments, and the widelyavailable nature of commodity malware.\n\nWannaCry and wormable ransomware leveraging vulnerabilities detailed in Microsoft bulletin MS17-010 continues to\nbe a major threat to ICS. The MS17-010 vulnerabilities were first weaponized in May 2017, and despite patches being\navailable since spring of that year, many enterprises – especially those within the OT space – have not or cannot\nupdate machines due to poor patch management, refusal to accept downtime, or system end-of-life considerations.\n\nThis remains a continuing threat. In August, an operational error during software installation at Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company caused a WannaCry infection and affected over 10,000 machines, leading to a financial impact\nof at least $250 million.[7]\n\nOlympic Destroyer — the malware known for causing a network disruption during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter\nOlympic Games — represented another IT-focused malware with the potential to bridge the IT-ICS gap. Although not an\nimmediate threat to ICS networks, Olympic Destroyer provides an example for exploit-less propagation within a victim\nnetwork paired with a disruptive effect that could cause significant disruption in ICS environments.\n\n6. https://dragos.com/blog/mimics/\n\nh h i k 2018 08 06 l\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mid-point Network Access\n\nIn May, researchers identified VPNFilter router malware targeting small office/home office (SOHO) network devices and\nsome commercial equipment that harvested information, stole credentials, and could cause a denial of service. While\nthis malware does not appear to be targeted towards ICS, a Ukrainian chemical plant reportedly identified VPNFilter[8]\non its network. The malware alone does not have destructive capabilities, however information gathered could further\n\nlead to a damaging attack. SOHO equipment is sometimes connected to ICS environments in an out-of-band manner\nwithout approval from IT departments, thus a VPNFilter infection could cause major issues.\n\n8. https://dragos.com/blog/20180716UkraineChemicalPlantEvent.html\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Supply Chain/Third-party Compromise\n\nThird-party access to OT networks is a common and necessary component of modern operations. However, the OT\nnetwork access granted to vendors and others can also expose an asset operator to significant risk as compromises\ncan move from vendors’ networks to the asset operator’s network. Third-party or supply chain[9] compromise leverages\nexplicit trust between parties and bypasses a large part of the security stack, potentially including perimeter defenses,\nsuch as firewalls or proxy servers, to access a target. Once an adversary accesses the victim network, it is possible\nto pivot throughout the network, steal credentials or other sensitive data, and further embed themselves within IT or\noperations.\n\nMost concerning to Dragos are several compromises of ICS vendors and manufacturers in 2018 by activity associated\nwith XENOTIME, providing potential supply chain threat opportunities and vendor-enabled access to asset owner and\noperator ICS networks. We suspect that there are other unknown manufacturer/vendor compromises and that this trend\nwill continue because the value of such access is high. Other significant activity of interest involves the compromise of\nlegitimate websites enabling exploitation and access of networks when engineers and operators access these sites or\ndownload legitimate-looking software (e.g., ICS watering holes).\n\nIn April, a business tool used by a number of energy firms for communication purposes experienced a cyber incident,[10]\nexclusively affecting business communications across oil and gas and electric utility sectors. It forced a number of\nenergy companies to shut down communication connections and hampered data processing. Further underscoring\npotential for third-party infections, the Department of Justice in December indicted[11] alleged members of the APT 10\nhacking group in part for accessing companies’ Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to gain access into primary victim\nnetworks to steal sensitive information. Additionally, in August Schneider Electric alerted customers that some USB\nmedia shipped with two Conext products may have been infected with unidentified malware during manufacturing by a\nsupplier.[12] No customers publicly reported incidents of infection in this case.\n\n9. https://dragos.com/blog/20180522SupplyChainThreats.html\n\n10. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/cyberattack-bleeds-into-utility-space-as-duke-sees-billing-delay\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Significant TTPs\n\nICS-directed threat behavior continues to transition away from unique malware and vulnerabilities for most operations,\nwhich is concerning because many OT security practices rely on anti-virus and vulnerability-based protection schemes\nto reduce risk. Thus, their fundamental behavior becomes a key detection element for defense.\n\nDuring earlier phases of operation threats increasingly use a methodology known as Living off the Land, leveraging\nnative system commands, applications, and software to gain access to the system and move throughout the network\nundetected. Most ICS-impacting incidents still begin in an enterprise IT network although with the interconnection of\nindustrial environments to vendors, integrators, and others, it is important to note that the enterprise IT network the\ncompromise begins in may not belong to the organization that owns and operates the ICS. Living off the Land can allow\nan adversary to execute behaviors ranging from conducting research to executing an attack on a target while evading\nmany signature- and blacklist-based detection methods. Living off the Land techniques encompass abuse of native\nfunctionality and features in the ICS, such as operations of HMIs, and should not simply be considered the same Living\noff the Land techniques common in enterprise IT security.\n\nFive out of eight of the activity groups Dragos tracks use some Living off the Land techniques to accomplish earlyphase operations. While detecting commodity malware and Living off the Land techniques seems straightforward, it\noften fails by traditional IT security approaches because of the complex nature and mission requirements of operations\nenvironments. As anti-virus products, detection software, and other threat detection methods become more robust and\ncapable of detecting various malicious activity, adversaries must modify their methods to evade capture by blending in\nwith the environment and not leaving behind identifiable artifacts.\n\nDragos has also identified a growing trend of adversaries using open source or commercially-available penetration\ntesting tools in real-world campaigns. Mimikatz is the most popular and effective tool that lets adversaries capture\nWindows credentials from system memory. Multiple activity groups, including ELECTRUM, ALLANITE, and DYMALLOY,\nuse Mimikatz, and major wormable malware including NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer with built-in Mimikatz-like\nfunctionality for credential capture to propagate through infected networks. This tool can be leveraged for a pivot point\nwithin the network and used for traversing the IT and ICS boundary. Other tools include penetration testing frameworks\nMetasploit and PowerShell Empire, both of which contain versions of Mimikatz.\n\nLater operational phases against ICS networks see the usage of ICS-specific knowledge, technology, processes, and\ncapabilities. Threats continue to require months-to-many years of dedicated ICS research and reconnaissance to\nachieve any specific intent – hence our concern of the growing number of ICS intrusions which are the precursor to\nany disruptive action. Later operational phases leverage ICS-specific technologies and protocols to interact with and\nultimately disrupt an industrial process. This means that a comprehensive ICS cybersecurity strategy must incorporate\nICS-specific defenses and IT cybersecurity mechanisms.\n\nOther tools include penetration testing frameworks Metasploit and PowerShell Empire, both of which contain versions\nof Mimikatz.\n\n\n-----\n\n## ACTIVITY\n### GROUPS\n\n\n###### Dragos categorizes behavior by activity group,[13] creating analytics that provide comprehensive data around actions, capabilities, and intentions. We currently publicly label eight ICS-focused activity groups and track more unlabeled activity of interest. The following summaries include newly-identified activity groups as well as recent activity that Dragos links with high confidence to tracked activity groups.\n\n\n## ACTIVITY\n### GROUPS\n\n###### Dragos categorizes behavior by activity group,[13] creating analytics that provide comprehensive data around actions, capabilities, and intentions. We currently publicly label eight ICS-focused activity\n\n\n###### MAGNALLIUM\n\n\n###### COVELLITE\n\n\n-----\n\n###### XENOTIME\n\nXENOTIME is the group behind TRISIS, the destructive, ICS-tailored malware targeting Triconex safety instrumented\nsystems (SIS) in the Middle East. In 2018 Dragos identified new XENOTIME activity targeting entities in the US, and\ndevices beyond Triconex. While TRISIS would be difficult to replicate to other SIS’s, the malware provided a roadmap\nfor other adversaries to target these types of devices. In addition to customizing the malware specifically for the target\n\nenvironment, the group uses stolen credentials to move between networks, legitimate but compromised servers for\ncommunication, and some Living off the Land techniques.\n\nDragos identified TRISIS targeting an oil and gas facility in Saudi Arabia in the fall of 2017. It represented an escalation\nof ICS attacks due to its targeting of safety systems that could lead to potential loss of life and physical damage.\n\nXENOTIME has operated since at least 2014 and it is not currently linked to any other known groups. Dragos assesses\nthis is one of the most adept and notable ICS-targeting activity groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ALLANITE\n\nIn 2018, Dragos identified victims and attack methodology that sufficiently differentiated ALLANITE from other activity\ngroups. This group targets business and ICS networks in the US and UK electric utility sectors and maintains access to\nunderstand the operational environment and for potential disruptive events.\n\nALLANITE uses phishing and compromised websites, called watering holes, for credential theft. Dragos assesses\nthe group’s operations are limited to information gathering and have not yet demonstrated disruptive capabilities.\nALLANITE avoids custom malware, instead utilizing Living off the Land techniques.\n\nALLANITE activity includes the Palmetto Fusion[14] event described by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\nIn October 2017, a DHS advisory[15] documented ALLANITE technical operations combined with activity with a group\nSymantec calls Dragonfly 2.0 (the latter has links to the activity group Dragos tracks as DYMALLOY).\n\n14. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-officials-say-russian-government-hackers-have\npenetrated-energy-and-nuclear-company-business-networks/2017/07/08/bbfde9a2-638b-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RASPITE\n\nIn August 2018, Dragos identified a new group targeting access operations in the US electric utility sector, with additional\nvictims in Saudi Arabia, Japan, and potentially Europe. The group appears active since at least mid-2017.\n\nRASPITE compromises websites its targets are likely to visit in an attempt to gain initial access to victim networks.\n\nSimilar to ALLANITE and DYMALLOY, RASPITE will embed a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection and\nsteal Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to RASPITEcontrolled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine. The group shares similarities\nwith a group known as Leafminer by Symantec.\n\nDespite demonstrating the steps necessary for initial intrusion into an IT network and potentially preparing a path\nfor an ICS event at a later time, there is no indication the group currently has a destructive capability that could, for\ninstance, cause energy sector disruptions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DYMALLOY\n\nIn fall 2018, Dragos identified multiple new malware infections matching DYMALLOY’s behavior. These observations\nmay indicate a potential resurgence of DYMALLOY activity, or a different entity leveraging similar toolsets. This\ndiscovery is concerning; the malware Dragos recently identified as part of new activity is only associated with known\nintrusions into ICS networks.\n\nThe DYMALLOY activity group, associated with “Dragonfly 2.0,” uses methods such as spearphishing and watering\nhole attacks for initial access, and commodity backdoors Goodor, DorShel, and Karagany for post-exploitation activity.\nThe group first emerged in late 2015, and was able to successfully compromise multiple ICS targets in Turkey, Europe,\nand North America, including obtaining access to human machine interface (HMI) devices and stealing screenshots.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MAGNALLIUM\n\nIn 2018, MAGNALLIUM’s victimology expanded to additional targets, including entities in Europe and North America.\nMAGNALLIUM used phishing emails purporting to be job advertisements relating to oil and gas companies to gain\naccess to victims’ machines. The group used publicly-available phishing kits to construct the emails’ contents, and\nleveraged variants of the StoneDrill wiper and TURNEDUP malware family in infection events before transitioning to\n\nPowerShell based post-exploitation tools in 2018.\n\nAlthough the expansion is concerning, MAGNALLIUM’s capabilities appear to still lack an ICS-specific capability, and\nremain focused on initial IT compromise and information gathering.\n\nDragos identified MAGNALLIUM in 2017 and determined that the group targeted IT operations at petrochemical and\naerospace manufacturers since at least 2013. The group initially targeted Saudi Arabian energy firms and an aircraft\nholding company, but new intelligence suggests the group is expanding their targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ELECTRUM\n\nIn summer 2018, Dragos identified multiple samples of a malicious tool previously associated with ELECTRUM’s 2016\nCRASHOVERRIDE event in Ukraine. Although some samples of this tool had been previously identified “in the wild,” this\ntool is only associated with ELECTRUM activity. Dragos also identified new intelligence providing additional information\ninto ELECTRUM infiltration techniques and the capabilities of the CRASHOVERRIDE malware.\n\nThe group does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities, instead leveraging common exploitation behaviors and tools,\nincluding Mimikatz. Our intelligence indicates that the group remains active and is no longer focusing exclusively on\nUkraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHRYSENE\n\nDragos uncovered multiple samples of CHRYSENE-related malware and other activity this year, indicating the group\nremains active and is evolving in more than one area, including revising and updating its malicious software toolkit.\nCHRYSENE aims to evade existing anti-virus and other detection mechanisms.\n\nCHRYSENE developed from an espionage campaign which first appeared on the public’s radar after the destructive\nSHAMOON cyberattack in 2012 impacting Saudi Aramco. The activity group targets petrochemical, oil, gas, and electric\ngeneration sectors and has shifted targeting outside the Gulf Region.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### COVELLITE\n\nCOVELLITE compromised networks associated with electric energy, primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North America.\nThe group lacks an ICS-specific capability at this time. Dragos identified COVELLITE activity targeting US electric\nutilities in 2017.\n\nWhile technical activity linked to COVELLITE behaviors exist in the wild, there has been no evidence or indications\nthis group remains active from an ICS-targeting perspective, nor has Dragos identified new activity against electric\ninfrastructure specifically.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n###### Organizations can lower their risk profiles and proactively protect against common attack techniques by performing security best practices. Implement proper security hygiene and the principle of least privilege based on a deep knowledge of the environment. For instance: question whether tools like PSExec are necessary for every user; use access control lists and restrict administration rights across\n\n\n###### DEFENDING THE ENTIRE KILL CHAIN\n\n\n###### Organizations can lower their risk profiles and proactively protect against common attack techniques by performing security best practices. Implement proper security hygiene and the principle of least privilege based on a deep knowledge of the environment. For instance: question whether tools like PSExec are necessary for every user; use access control lists and restrict administration rights across all devices; prohibit OT devices, including engineering workstations, from connecting to the internet or email services wherever possible; and ensure employees are trained to identify and report phishing and malicious activity. Additionally, increase visibility into host and ICS processes as a means to identify suspicious behavior within otherwise legitimate processes, such as PowerShell execution resulting in network connectivity.\n\n LEVERAGE THREAT BEHAVIOR ANALYTICS\n UNDERSTAND AND ANTICIPATE THREATS\n\n\n##### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n###### Organizations can lower their risk profiles and proactively protect against common attack techniques by performing security best practices. Implement proper security hygiene and the principle\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DEFENDING THE ENTIRE KILL CHAIN\n\nDefending against a dynamic threat landscape requires adopting a “Whole of Kill Chain”[16] approach, keying in on\nadversary behaviors from the initial intrusions through second-stage impacts. Defenders can use a mix of modern\nthreat detection strategies including indicator- or behavior-based methods, or approaches relying on modeling and\nconfiguration.[17] Diversifying threat detection strategies can help asset owners and operators identify threats earlier,\nand achieve greater visibility into potential threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LEVERAGE THREAT BEHAVIOR ANALYTICS\n\nAs adversaries increasingly adopt Living off the\nLand and ICS-specific techniques, leveraging Threat\nBehavior Analytics (TBA) – or identifying patterns\nin behavior and malicious activity alongside static\noperations – can help improve identification of\nmalicious activity within the environment. Dragos\ndevelops TBAs[18] to help define activity groups,\nproviding analytic identifiers that allow defenders to\ndetect malicious behavior holistically, regardless of\nwhether the individual indicators of compromise (IOCs)\nrelating to the analytic change in different attacks.\n\n###### UNDERSTAND AND ANTICIPATE THREATS\n\nICS threat intelligence can give asset owners and\noperators actionable information to anticipate and\ndefend against threats by providing visibility into\nthe current landscape, trends, and targeting. Threat\nintelligence combines information from various sources\nand expert assessments to form conclusions that\ndecision-makers can use to implement vertical-specific\ncontrols that result in effective security postures.\n\n18. https://dragos.com/blog/20180226ThreatAnalyticsAndActivityGroups.html\n\n\n-----\n\n## COMBATING\n### FUD\n\n\n###### FEAR\n\n\n## COMBATING\n\n\n###### UNCERTAINTY\n\n\n###### DOUBT\n\n\n-----\n\n###### COMBATING FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, AND DOUBT\n\nDragos frequently receives feedback that ICS security practitioners take weeks or months to address FUD, or fear,\nuncertainty, and doubt, caused by misreported or misunderstood incidents. Addressing FUD keeps them from actually\ndefending networks, thereby making ICS security worse by a significant margin.\n\nFor instance, in July, the media reported[19] the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publicly disclosed Russian\nhacking activity targeting US electric utilities. But the article contained previously-reported information: activity linked\nto the DYMALLOY and ALLANITE activity groups. This reporting and the exaggerated statements reported within\ncontinued coverage generated concern because it was not clear that the activity and had been known for some time.\n\nAs the scope and number of reported threats or cyberattacks against ICS entities expands, it’s important to ensure a\nrealistic understanding of what malicious activity organizations in the electric, oil and gas, manufacturing, aerospace,\nand a variety of other industries face. Industrial infrastructure is defensible, and destructive attacks are difficult to\nexecute and scale. Further, while numerous, incidental malicious activity commonly occurs in industrial networks (like\ncommodity malware or phishing attacks), ICS-specific or ICS-tailored malware remains rare.\n\n19. https://dragos.com/blog/20180806ElectricGridThreats.html\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This year Dragos expects to identify more activity targeting ICS, due to greater visibility into OT networks and adversary behavior driven by ICS threat intelligence. Adversaries will continue to bridge IT and OT networks leveraging traditional malware and Living off the Land techniques, while largely avoiding the use of zero-days.\n\n We anticipate growing our list of publicly-tracked adversaries and providing our customers the most in-depth and intelligence-driven ICS threat analysis. Dragos will continue our efforts to bring ICS cybersecurity resources to all levels and encourage collaboration across all sectors to ensure a greater understanding of the threats these industries face and how to combat them.\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n\n-----",
