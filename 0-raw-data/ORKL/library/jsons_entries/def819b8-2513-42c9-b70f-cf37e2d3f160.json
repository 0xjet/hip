    "plain_text": "# New Octo Banking Trojan Spreading via Fake Apps on Google Play Store\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/04/new-octo-banking-trojan-spreading-via.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/new-octo-banking-trojan-spreading-via.html)**\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nA number of rogue Android apps that have been cumulatively installed from the official Google Play\nStore more than 50,000 times are being used to target banks and other financial entities.\n\nThe rental banking trojan, dubbed Octo, is said to be a rebrand of another Android malware called\nExobotCompact, which, in turn, is a \"lite\" replacement for its Exobot predecessor, Dutch mobile\n[security firm ThreatFabric said in a report shared with The Hacker News.](https://threatfabric.com/blogs/octo-new-odf-banking-trojan.html)\n\nExobot is also likely said to have paved the way for a separate descendant called Coper, that was\n[initially discovered targeting Colombian users around July 2021, with newer infections targeting](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14259)\nAndroid users in different European Countries.\n\n\"Coper malware apps are modular in design and include a multi-stage infection method and many\n[defensive tactics to survive removal attempts,\" Cybersecurity company Cyble noted in an analysis](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/03/24/coper-banking-trojan/)\nof the malware last month.\n\n\n-----\n\nLike other Android banking trojans, the rogue apps are nothing more than droppers, whose primary\nfunction is to deploy the malicious payload embedded within them. The list of Octo and Coper\ndroppers used by multiple threat actors is below \nPocket Screencaster (com.moh.screen)\nFast Cleaner 2021 (vizeeva.fast.cleaner)\nPlay Store (com.restthe71)\nPostbank Security (com.carbuildz)\nPocket Screencaster (com.cutthousandjs)\nBAWAG PSK Security (com.frontwonder2), and\nPlay Store app install (com.theseeye5)\n\nThese apps, which pose as Play Store app installer, screen recording, and financial apps, are\n\"powered by inventive distribution schemes,\" distributing them through the Google Play store and\nvia fraudulent landing pages that purportedly alert users to download a browser update.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe droppers, once installed, act as a conduit to launch the trojans, but not before requesting users\n[to enable the Accessibility Services that allow it a wide breadth of capabilities to exfiltrate sensitive](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/teabot-android-banking-malware-spreads.html)\ninformation from the compromised phones.\n\nOcto, the revised version of ExobotCompact, is also equipped to perform on-device fraud by\ngaining remote control over the devices by taking advantage of the accessibility permissions as well\n[as Android's MediaProjection API to capture screen contents in real-time.](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection)\n\nThe ultimate goal, ThreatFabric said, is to trigger the \"automatic initiation of fraudulent transactions\nand its authorization without manual efforts from the operator, thus allowing fraud on a significantly\nlarger scale.\"\n\nOther notable features of Octo include logging keystrokes, carrying out overlay attacks on banking\napps to capture credentials, harvesting contact information, and persistence measures to prevent\nuninstallation and evade antivirus engines.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"Rebranding to Octo erases previous ties to the Exobot source code leak, inviting multiple threat\nactors looking for opportunity to rent an allegedly new and original trojan,\" ThreatFabric noted.\n\n\"Its capabilities put at risk not only explicitly targeted applications that are targeted by overlay\nattack, but any application installed on the infected device as ExobotCompact/Octo is able to read\ncontent of any app displayed on the screen and provide the actor with sufficient information to\nremotely interact with it and perform on-device fraud (ODF).\"\n\nThe findings come close on the heels of the discovery of a distinct Android bankbot named\n[GodFather — sharing overlaps with the Cereberus and Medusa banking trojans — that has been](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/03/23/godfather-malware-under-the-lens/)\nobserved targeting banking users in Europe under the guise of the default Settings app to transfer\nfunds and steal SMS messages, among others.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn top of that, a [new analysis published by AppCensus found 11 apps with more than 46 million](https://blog.appcensus.io/2022/04/06/the-curious-case-of-coulus-coelib/)\ninstallations that were implanted with a third-party SDK named Coelib that made it possible to\ncapture clipboard content, GPS data, email addresses, phone numbers, and even the user's\nmodem router MAC address and network SSID.\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
