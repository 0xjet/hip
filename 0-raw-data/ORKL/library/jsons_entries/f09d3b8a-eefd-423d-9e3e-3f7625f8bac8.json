Further, the same campaign very likely\ntargeted other NATO members or countries cooperating with NATO exercises,\" stated the\ncompany.\n\nOn discovering the malicious activity, QuoIntelligence had reported their findings to the\nFrench law enforcement bodies.\n\n## More than an image, dangerously so\n\nThe malicious file distributed by APT28 is titled, \"Course 5 – 16 October 2020.zipx\"\n\nNaturally, to an unsuspecting user, this would appear to be a ZIP bundle containing course\nmaterials.\n\nIn our test, BleepingComputer further noticed when renamed to \".jpg,\" the ZIP archive\nbehaves almost like a legitimate image file.\n\nThis is because, as QuoIntelligence researchers have explained, the file comprises a\nlegitimate JPG image with a ZIP archive appended to it.\n\n**When**\n\n**renamed to a JPG, the ZIP archive behaves entirely as an image**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe file metadata and properties also show an \"image/jpeg\" MIME type with references\nto \"JPEG image data.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThis technique works because JPEG files are parsed from the beginning of the file and\nsome Zip implementations parse Zip files from the end of the file (since the index is located\nthere) without looking at the signature in the front,\" the researchers explain.\n\nAt the time of analyses by both Qi'anxin Red Raindrops team and QuoIntelligence, the\nmalware sample had a very low detection rate of 3/61 on VirusTotal.\n\nEven today, less than half of the known antivirus engines are flagging the infection on\n[VirusTotal, as observed by BleepingComputer:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e6e19633ba4572b49b47525b5a873132dfeb432f075fbba29831f1bc59d5885d/detection)\n\n**Even today the malware sample showed a 24/60 detection rate on VirusTotal**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\"The technique is also used by threat actors to evade AVs, or other filtering systems since\nthey might mistake the file for a JPEG and skip it.\"\n\nWhen extracted the ZIP contains a corrupted Excel (.xls) file and another file with the same\nname \"Course 5 - 16 October 2020\" but an EXE extension.\n\nOn Windows systems, the \"Course 5 - 16 October 2020.exe\" file shows a PDF icon\n(executables allow usage of custom file icons on Windows).\n\nQuoIntelligence researchers hypothesize this might be an intentional tactic employed by the\nhacking group, and similar techniques to bypass email gateways have been seen in the\npast.\n\nBy providing course materials in a ZIP file that has a deliberately corrupted XLS file may\ntempt the user into double-clicking what looks like a PDF—the EXE file.\n\n## Steals and uploads private data to the server\n\n\n-----\n\nZebrocy, used by this campaign, is a persistent malware infection and a backdoor known to\ncarry multiple capabilities, such as system reconnaissance, file creation/modification, taking\nscreenshots on the infected machine, arbitrary command execution, and creating\nWindows scheduled tasks.\n\n[The sample is also known to drop multiple files on an infected system making it \"quite loud\"](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/09/24/no-summer-vacations-zebrocy/)\nas in, its activities raise alarms of leading security products.\n\nIn this case, Zebrocy payload (present in \"Course 5 - 16 October 2020.exe\") works by\nreplicating itself into \"%AppData%\\Roaming\\Service\\12345678\\sqlservice.exe\" and further\nadds a randomized 160-byte blob to the newly generated file. The padded data makes\nhash-based detection by signature-based antivirus engines hard by altering the resulting\n[file's checksum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Verifying_the_integrity_of_messages_and_files)\n\nFurther, the malware created a Windows scheduled task which runs every minute posting\nstolen data to the Command & Control (C2) server, state the researchers:\n\n\"The task runs regularly and tries to POST stolen data (e.g. screenshots)\nto hxxp://194.32.78[.]245/protect/get-upd-id[.]php\"\n\nThe data transmitted by the malware appeared to have obfuscated and encrypted bytes but\na numerical ID (12345678 in this example) remained constant between requests.\n\n**Request showing data transferred by the malware**\n\nSource: QuoIntelligence\nThe researchers suspect this is a unique identifier of the infected machine included in every\nrequest by the malware.\n\n## Suspicion: Azerbaijan government targeted\n\nQuoIntelligence suspects this malware targeted Azerbaijan government bodies based on a\n[previous ReconHellcat campaign analyzed by the company.](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/08/blackwater-malware-leveraging-beirut-tragedy-in-new-targeted-campaign/)\n\nThe three similarities between these samples provide medium-high confidence to the\nresearchers that this attack was aimed at a specific government organization, at least in\nAzerbaijan:\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth the compressed Zebrocy malware and the OSCE-themed lure used to drop the\nBlackWater backdoor were uploaded the same day, on 5 August.\n\nBoth samples were uploaded by the same user in Azerbaijan and are highly likely by\nthe same organization.\n\nBoth attacks happened in the same timeframe.\n\nA complete list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), IDS detection rule(s), and detailed\n[research findings have been provided by QuoIntelligence.](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/09/apt28-zebrocy-malware-campaign-nato-theme/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers can hack your online accounts before you even register them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-can-hack-your-online-accounts-before-you-even-register-them/)\n\n[Russian hackers perform reconnaissance against Austria, Estonia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-hackers-perform-reconnaissance-against-austria-estonia/)\n\n[NVIDIA fixes ten vulnerabilities in Windows GPU display drivers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nvidia-fixes-ten-vulnerabilities-in-windows-gpu-display-drivers/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Google fixes actively exploited Android kernel vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-actively-exploited-android-kernel-vulnerability/)\n\n[APT28](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt28/)\n[Cyber-espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Government](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/government/)\n[Security](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/security/)\n\n[Ax Sharma](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ax-sharma/)\n\nAx Sharma is a Security Researcher and Tech Reporter.
