Otherwise, read_\n_on for a quick breakdown of what happened to the Colonial Pipeline, how to detect the_\n_ransomware, and view MITRE ATT&CK mappings._\n\n## Introduction to the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack\n\nIt might be more expensive for you to take that Great American Road Trip this summer\n[because filling up the tank of the Family Truckster may cost you some serious Dogecoin.](https://driving.ca/ford/auto-news/news/the-wagon-queen-family-truckster-is-headed-to-the-barrett-jackson-auction)\nLet us give you a little bit more color on this:\n\n\n-----\n\nLate on Friday, May 7th, one of the US s largest gasoline pipelines was preemptively shut\n[down by operator Colonial Pipeline, because their corporate computer networks were](https://www.colpipe.com/)\naffected by [Ransomware-as-a-Service authored and maintained by the group DarkSide.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-network-disruption-at-colonial-pipeline)\nThis 5500 mile pipeline transports about 45% of the East Coast’s fuel supplies, and at the\ntime of this blog, Colonial Pipeline had not returned to full operation. Now, mind you, the\n**_ransomware did not directly cause the pipeline to shut down - rather, Colonial shut_**\n_down operations voluntarily out of an abundance of caution. But until they can be sure that_\nthe adversary leveraging the DarkSide ransomware for the attack does not have the ability\nto affect operations, the pipeline will remain dry. Colonial is hoping to get the pipeline back\nto operation by the end of this week.\n\nRegardless of how all of this plays out, what Splunk customers want to know is how to\ndetect and mitigate DarkSide ransomware, especially if they work in critical infrastructure. In\nfact, last year [CISA released an alert about ransomware targeting pipeline operators - so](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a)\n[we know this is a big deal. And, they just updated it today with new alert guidance (AA21-](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-131a)\n131A) specific to DarkSide.\n\nAfter review, we’re happy to find that the behavior of this ransomware isn’t particularly\nnovel, and all of the guidance we’ve shared for years on ransomware detection and\nmitigation applies. Let’s review that guidance, and update it where appropriate.\n\n## What You Need to Know\n\n[One of the last significant ransomware events was the Ryuk ransomware at the end of](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/ryuk-and-splunk-detections.html)\nOctober 2020, however our specialists pointed out that Ryuk wasn’t particularly novel in\nterms of its operation. Our Threat Research team also posted about detecting the Clop\n[ransomware last month and recently updated further.](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/clop-ransomware-detection-threat-research-release-april-2021.html)\n\nIs the DarkSide variant of ransomware more interesting than either of these? No, it isn’t!\nHowever, there’s significant worldwide interest because of the target chosen. We also see\n[these “affiliate” actors attempt a “double extortion” where not only have they encrypted](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/hacking-group-darkside-reportedly-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-shutdown.html)\ncritical business data, they’re also threatening to release it publicly if additional ransom is\nnot paid. DarkSide also contains a killswitch if it detects a Russian language environment.\n[There are also reports that the ongoing global pandemic has made infections like this](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57050690)\neasier, because operational staff may be working from home and that may broaden the\nattack surface. However, this is not new, as remote access for Operational Technology (OT)\nnetworks is commonplace and long predates the pandemic.\n\n### Splunk & Ransomware: Not Our First Rodeo\n\nAs we’ve stated, this blog ain’t the first time we’re covering our approach to Ransomware.\nFeast your eyes on the following corpus of material from days of yore:\n\n\n-----\n\n.conf talks and videos\n\n[Splunking the Endpoint 2016: Ransomware Edition! and](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/slides/splunking-the-endpoint-hands-on.pdf) [Video](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/recordings/splunking-the-endpoint-hands-on.mp4)\nHow Splunk Can Help You Prevent Ransomware From Holding Your Business\nHostage\nWindows Ransomware Detection with Splunk (1 of 6) – Vulnerability Detection\nand Windows Patch Status\nDetections Blogs\n\n[Clop Ransomware Detection: Threat Research Release, April 2021](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/clop-ransomware-detection-threat-research-release-april-2021.html)\n[Ryuk and Splunk Detections Splunk Blogs](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/ryuk-and-splunk-detections.html)\n[Detecting Ryuk Using Splunk Attack Range](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detecting-ryuk-using-splunk-attack-range.html)\nWhitepaper\n\n[Splunk Security: Detecting Unknown Malware and Ransomware](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/detecting-unknown-malware.html)\nPhantom Responses\n\n[Automate Your Response to WannaCry Ransomware](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/automate-your-response-to-wannacry-ransomware.html)\n[Playbook: Detect, Block, Contain, and Remediate Ransomware](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/playbook-ransomware-detect-block-contain-and-remediate.html)\nMachine Learning Method\n\n[Detect Ransomware in Your Data with the Machine Learning Cloud Service](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detect-ransomware-in-your-data-with-the-machine-learning-cloud-service.html)\nOperationalizing Detections\n\n[Operationalize Ransomware Detections Quickly and Easily with Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/industries/operationalize-ransomware-detections-quickly-and-easily-with-splunk.html)\n\nAlso, looking for some fun Ransomware eye-candy to survey the kinds of infections\nrampant within the US over the past several years? Check out this interactive map from\nStatescoop.\n\n## Detection and Remediation of DarkSide Using Splunk\n\nAs regular readers of our blogs will expect, we normally fill this section with TTPs pulled\nfrom the zero-day or possibly a breakdown of a new malware variant. But, after reviewing\nthe last six seven years of content that Splunk has created, we are again proud to say we\nalready have you covered. In the list of detections below, you will notice that we did not\nbreak out IOCs. As David Bianco has pyramidized in the past, IOCs are ephemeral and\nchange often! I recommend working with a threat intel provider for any low-level IOCs like\n[hashes or IPs. Throw them into a Lookup table or](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/hunting-covid-themed-attacks-with-iocs.html) [ES threat intel framework, and off you go!](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/how-do-i-add-covid-threat-intelligence-from-the-internet-to-enterprise-security.html)\nIf you don’t have a threat intel provider, start skimming Twitter for some tremendous opensource lists.\n\n[The fine folks at CyberReason have a detailed walkthrough of how DarkSide behaves after](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware)\nthe initial foothold. From a Splunk detection perspective, here are some things we suggest\ncollecting:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Process execution logs, from our favorite Windows Security 4688 events, or Sysmon](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peeping-through-windows-logs.html)\nEventCode 1, or any commercial EDR, are, as always, key to detection of the\nparent/child process relationships involved in actions on intent and lateral movement\nas well as the [deletion of Volume Shadow Copies.](https://redcanary.com/blog/its-all-fun-and-games-until-ransomware-deletes-the-shadow-copies/)\n[PowerShell Script Block Logging is also critical, so that you can detect certain](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/slides/powershell-power-hell-hunting-for-malicious-use-of-powershell-with-splunk.pdf)\nmodules like WebClient.DownloadFile being used where you don’t expect, as well as\nthe use of encoded PowerShell.\n[Windows System events, so that you can detect Scheduled Tasks being created and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syi4IFrtEuw)\nenabled (4698, 4700).\n\nAnd as always, unusual network connections from servers and endpoints (can be\naccomplished via firewall, proxy, [Sysmon EventCode 3, or EDR logs) and](https://medium.com/threatpunter/detecting-lateral-movement-using-sysmon-and-splunk-318d3be141bc) DNS query\nlogging will be helpful.\n\n### Splunk Security Essentials\n\nIn case you are unaware (or living under a rock for the last two years), Splunk Security\nEssentials is the place to get Splunk’s security content. And since our last-go round with\n[Ryuk, we’ve updated Splunk Security Essentials and made it a fully-supported Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/)\nproduct (but it’s still free!). When you boot up the app, navigate to “Security Content\nLibrary,” and search for Ransomware, you get a plethora of content!\n\n\n-----\n\nSplunk Security Essentials - Ransomware content\n\n\n## Splunk Enterprise Security and ESCU\n\n### Know Thyself\n\nWhile we have spent some time explaining this attack and effort needs to be put toward\ninvestigating this, it is also important to note that the basics are important. Basic asset\nmanagement, hopefully via your asset and identity framework, will tell you where your\nvulnerable systems reside. Running regular vulnerability scans that integrate into Splunk\nwill display which systems are vulnerable and can help you prioritize your patching\nschedule and better focus your detection efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\nSplunk Enterprise Security and ESCU\n\n\n### Threat Intelligence Framework\n\n[If you are using Splunk Enterprise Security (ES), many organizations are posting IOCs that](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/enterprise-security.html)\ncan be ingested easily into the threat intelligence framework. Perhaps you aren’t sure how\nto do that? No worries, we published some guidance and a how-to on integrating lists of\n[IOCs into the Enterprise Security threat intelligence framework. We won’t be publishing a](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/smoothing-the-bumps-of-onboarding-threat-indicators-into-splunk-enterprise-security.html)\nlist of IOCs along with this blog as they are quite ephemeral, but use of the Threat\nIntelligence Framework (or standard lookups within Splunk) will allow you to easily perform\nIOC matching.\n\n### Enterprise Security Content Updates (ESCU)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor folks using ESCU, our Splunk Threat Research team will release a new Splunk Analytic\nStory called Darkside Ransomware by the end of this week containing detections for this\nthreat. Saying that, check out the MITRE ATT&CK table below. If you have ESCU running\ntoday, you already have some great coverage!\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n[Reviewing one of the first blog posts on DarkSide Ransomware from Digital Shadows in](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/)\nSeptember 2020, we extracted their MITRE ATT&CK tactics and then linked to Splunk\nContent to help you hunt for that information. Be aware; these searches are provided as a\nway to accelerate your hunting. We recommend you configure them via the Splunk Security\nEssentials App. You may need to modify them to work in your environment! Many of these\n[searches are optimized for use with the tstats command.](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/slides/how-to-scale-from-raw-to-tstats.pdf)\n\nFinally, as more information becomes available, we will update these searches if more\nATT&CK TTPs become known.\n\n\n**ATT&CK Technique** **Technique/Sub-**\n**Technique**\n\nT1098 Account\nManipulation\n\nAWS IAM Successful

Hopefully, these searches, blogs, videos, conference\npapers, and whitepapers will provide you the ability to have more visibility into your\nenvironment and any malicious activity that you might be experiencing. If they don’t work\nperfectly, think of them as “SplunkSpiration” :-). As soon as we have more information, we\nwill update this blog and, as we talked about earlier, be on the lookout for some more\ndetailed info about DarkSide and an Analytic Story delivered via ESCU from our Splunk\nThreat Research team.\n\n---------------------------------------------------Thanks!\nJames Brodsky\n\nPosted by\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/admin.html)**\n\n\n-----",
