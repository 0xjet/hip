See Advisory.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-335a)_\n\n### Summary\n\nThe threat actor known as RomCom is running a series of new attack campaigns that take\nadvantage of the brand power of SolarWinds, KeePass, and PDF Technologies. The BlackBerry\nThreat Research and Intelligence Team uncovered the campaigns while analyzing network artifacts\n[unearthed during our recent report on RomComRAT, which was targeting Ukrainian military](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/unattributed-romcom-threat-actor-spoofing-popular-apps-now-hits-ukrainian-militaries)\ninstitutions through spoofed versions of Advanced IP Scanner software.\n\nIn our latest discovery, our team found RomCom impersonating the following products in their\ncampaigns: SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, KeePass Open-Source\n**Password Manager, and PDF Reader Pro.**\n\nWhile Ukraine still appears to be the primary target of this campaign, we believe some Englishspeaking countries are being targeted as well, including the United Kingdom. This is based on the\nterms of service (TOS) of two of the malicious websites and the SSL certificates of a newly created\ncommand-and-control (C2).\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the geography of the targets and the current geopolitical situation, it's unlikely that the\nRomCom RAT threat actor is cybercrime-motivated.\n\n### Attack Vector\n\nIn preparation for an attack, the RomCom threat actor performs the following simplified scheme:\nscraping the original legitimate HTML code from the vendor to spoof, registering a malicious\ndomain similar to the legitimate one, Trojanizing a legitimate application, uploading a malicious\nbundle to the decoy website, deploying targeted phishing emails to the victims, or in some\ninstances, using additional infector vectors, which we will go into in more detail below.\n\n### RomCom Weaponization\n\n**RomCom SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor Campaign**\n\nTake a look at the two screen shots below to see how the real SolarWinds NPM site and the spoofed\nsite compare.\n\n_Figure 1 – Legitimate SolarWinds website_\n\n_Figure 2 – Fake SolarWinds website_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe deployment of this attack is through a Trojanized version of the SolarWinds Network\nPerformance Monitoring (NPM) application. While downloading a free trial from the spoofed\nSolarWinds site, a legitimate registration form appears. If filled out, real SolarWinds sales\npersonnel might contact the victim to follow up on the product trial. That technique misleads the\nvictim into believing that the recently downloaded and installed application is completely\nlegitimate. Instead, the victim has unknowingly downloaded a dropper for the malicious RomCom\nremote access Trojan (RAT).\n\n**Hashes (md5,** 7c003b4f8b3c0ab0c3f8cb933e93d301\n**sha-256)**\n\n246dfe16a9248d7fb90993f6f28b0ebe87964ffd2dcdb13105096cde025ca614\n\n**File Name** Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip\n\n**File Size** 124,671,897 bytes\n\n_Figure 3 – Extracted contents of \"SolarWinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip\"_\n\nThe “Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe” file contains a digital certificate from “Wechapaisch\nConsulting & Construction Limited.” The threat actor previously used the same certificate\ninformation in the “advancedipscanner.msi” file, a detail which we uncovered in our previous\n\n|Hashes (md5, sha-256)|7c003b4f8b3c0ab0c3f8cb933e93d301 246dfe16a9248d7fb90993f6f28b0ebe87964ffd2dcdb13105096cde025ca614|\n|---|---|\n|File Name|Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip|\n|File Size|124,671,897 bytes|\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigation into this threat actor. It is important to note that the legitimate file is digitally signed\nby “SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC.”\n\nThe “Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe” contains three embedded x64 files in the resource section:\n\n**X86 – Contains “c:\\users\\123\\source\\repos\\ins_asi\\win32\\release\\instlib.pdb,” the same**\nPDB path we have previously seen in the “setup.exe” files.\n**X87 – A clean, digitally signed, SolarWinds Orion installer.**\n**X88 – RomCom RAT dropper.

The\nRomCom team created a new attack campaign abusing a popular password keeper called KeePass.\nWhen someone downloads the application from the fake but legitimate-looking KeePass website,\nthe attacker drops a malicious bundle onto the victim’s machine with the name \"KeePass-2.52.\"\n\n|Hashes (md5, sha-256)|4E4ECA58B896BDB6DB260F21EDC7760A ABE9635ADBFEE2D2FBAEA140625C49ABE3BAA29C44FB53A65A9CDA02121583EE|\n|---|---|\n|ITW File Name|combase32.dll, winver.dll|\n|Compilation Stamp|Tue Aug 02 16:20:43 2022|\n|File Type/Signature|PE 64 DLL|\n|File Size|623616 bytes|\n|Compiler Name/Version|Microsoft Visual C++|\n|C2|combinedresidency[.]org|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Legitimate KeePass website_\n\n_Figure 5 – Fake KeePass website_\n\nThe fake KeePass.org website drops a Trojanized bundle called \"KeePass-2.52.zip.\" Once\nunpacked, it contains the following files:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 –_ _Contents of the malicious archive_\n\nAs shown in the screenshot above, two malicious files are contained in the KeePass-2.52.zip file:\n\n**Setup.exe – The file that launches the RomCom RAT dropper: PDB**\nC:\\Users\\123\\source\\repos\\ins_asi\\Win32\\Release\\setup.pdb\n**hlpr.dat is a RomCom RAT dropper.**\n\nOur team followed the RomCom Netflows and uncovered both spoofed KeePass and PDF Reader\nPro sites in Ukrainian language. Both of these spoofed websites host their terms of service pages on\nthe same URL and imply the software providers are hosted by UK companies.\n\nhref=\"privacy/uk_privacy.html\"\nhref=\"privacy/uk_term.html\"\nhref=\"privacy/uk_disclaimer.html\"\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – KeePass spoofed website in Ukrainian_\n\n_Figure 8 – PDF Reader Pro spoofed website in Ukrainian_\n\nNetflow analysis by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team also led to the discovery of a\nnew C2 registered on Oct. 27, utilizing SSL certificates that emulate UK ownership:\n\nIssuer: C=GB, ST=Greater London, L=Harmondsworth, O=British Government,\nOU=dgtlocean.com, CN=ca dgtlocean.com/emailAddress=ca(at)mail.com Issuer: C=GB,\nST=Greater London, L=London, O=Government Digital Service, OU=you-supported.com, CN=ca\nyou-supported.com/em\n\ndepth=0 C = GB, ST = British, L = Chesterfield, O = Royal Mail Group Ltd, OU = Group1, CN =\nGroup1.A, emailAddress = server(at)mail.com\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe RomCom threat actor is actively deploying new campaigns targeting victims in Ukraine and\nEnglish-speaking targets worldwide. Based on the TOS, it is possible that victims in the United\nKingdom are a new target, while Ukraine continues to be the main focus.\n\nIt’s important to note:\n\nThe Trojanized bundles that the threat actor built do not indicate the mentioned vendors\nwere compromised\nThe legitimate companies are not involved in any attack\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors created fake websites to mimic the real ones\n\n[RomCom RAT, Cuba Ransomware, and Industrial Spy have an apparent connection. Industrial Spy](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/04/threat-thursday-blackberry-protect-vs-cuba-ransomware)\nis a relatively new ransomware group that emerged in April 2022. However, given the targets'\ngeography and characteristics, combined with the current geopolitical situation, it's unclear if the\nreal motivation of the RomCom threat actor is purely cybercriminal in nature.\n\n### RomCom RAT Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n|Filename MD5 SHA256|Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip 7C003B4F8B3C0AB0C3F8CB933E93D301 246DFE16A9248D7FB90993F6F28B0EBE87964FFD2DCDB13105096CDE025CA614|\n|---|---|\n|Filename MD5 SHA256|KeePass-2.52.zip 1a21a1e626fd342e794bcc3b06981d2c 596eaef93bdcd00a3aedaf6ad6d46db4429eeba61219b7e01b1781ebbf6e321b|\n|Filename MD5 SHA256|Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe D1A84706767BFB802632A262912E95A8 9D3B268416D3FAB4322CC916D32E0B2E8FA0DE370ACD686873D1522306124FD2|\n|Type MD5 SHA256 MD5 SHA256|RomCom RAT Dropper CB933F1C913144A8CA6CFCFD913D6D28 AC09CBFEE4CF89D7B7A755C387E473249684F18AA699EB651D119D19E25BFF34 8284421bbb94f3c37f94899cdcd19afd 8b8dff5d30802fd79b76ee1531e7d050184a07570201ef1cd83a7bb8fa627cb0|\n|Type MD5 SHA256 MD5 SHA256|RomCom RAT Launcher (Setup.exe) 6310A2063687800559AE9D65CFF21B0A F7013CE417FCBA0F36C4B9BF5F8F6E0E2B14D6ED33FF4D384C892773508E932E 550f42c5b555893d171285dc8b15b4b5 5f187393acdeb67e76126353c74b6080d3e6ccf28ae580658c670d8b6e4aacc1|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Type MD5 SHA256 MD5 SHA256|RomCom RAT Payload 4E4ECA58B896BDB6DB260F21EDC7760A ABE9635ADBFEE2D2FBAEA140625C49ABE3BAA29C44FB53A65A9CDA02121583EE a7172aef66bb12e1bb40a557bb41e607 3252965013ec861567510d54a97446610edba5da88648466de6b3145266386d9|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**You might also be interested in:**\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats, providing\nintelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\n[Back](javascript:history.back())\n\n\n-----",
