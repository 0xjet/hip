Once](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#:~:text=Synopsis,object%20that%20describes%20a%20pod.)\nge�ng a foothold into a Kubernetes cluster, the malware a�empted to spread over as many containers\nas possible and eventually launched cryptojacking opera�ons. Based on the tac�cs, techniques and\n[procedures (TTP) that the a�ackers used, we believe this is a new campaign from TeamTNT. We refer to](https://www.cadosecurity.com/post/team-tnt-the-first-crypto-mining-worm-to-steal-aws-credentials)\nthis new malware as Hildegard, the username of the tmate account that the malware used.\n\nTeamTNT is known for exploi�ng unsecured Docker daemons and deploying malicious container\n[images, as documented in previous research (Cetus, Black-T and TeamTNT DDoS). However, this is the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cetus-cryptojacking-worm/)\nfirst �me we found TeamTNT targe�ng Kubernetes environments. In addi�on to the same tools and\ndomains iden�fied in TeamTNT’s previous campaigns, this new malware carries mul�ple new\ncapabili�es that make it more stealthy and persistent. In par�cular, we found that TeamTNT’s Hildegard\nmalware:\n\n[Uses two ways to establish command and control (C2) connec�ons: a tmate reverse shell and an](https://tmate.io/)\n[Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel.](https://modern.ircdocs.horse/)\n\nUses a known Linux process name (bioset) to disguise the malicious process.\n\n[Uses a library injec�on technique based on LD_PRELOAD to hide the malicious processes.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)\n\nEncrypts the malicious payload inside a binary to make automated sta�c analysis more difficult.\n\nWe believe that this new malware campaign is s�ll under development due to its seemingly incomplete\ncodebase and infrastructure. At the �me of wri�ng, most of Hildegard’s infrastructure has been online\nfor only a month. The C2 domain borg[.]w� was registered on Dec. 24, 2020, the IRC server went\nonline on Jan. 9, 2021, and some malicious scripts have been updated frequently. The malware\ncampaign has ~25.05 KH/s hashing power, and there is 11 XMR (~$1,500) in the wallet.\n\n**There has not been any ac�vity since our ini�al detec�on, which indicates the threat campaign may**\n**s�ll be in the reconnaissance and weaponiza�on stage. However, knowing this malware’s capabili�es**\nand target environments, we have good reason to believe that the group will soon launch a larger-scale\na�ack. The malware can leverage the abundant compu�ng resources in Kubernetes environments for\ncryptojacking and poten�ally exfiltrate sensi�ve data from tens to thousands of applica�ons running in\nthe clusters.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from this threat by the Run�me](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nProtec�on feature, Cryptominer Detec�on feature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes\nCompliance Protec�on, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes configura�on and provides secure\nalterna�ves.\n\n\nThis site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for\npersonalized content and ads.

A�acker and malware’s movement._\n\n## Tac�cs, Techniques and Procedures\n\nFigure 1 illustrates how the a�acker entered, moved laterally and eventually performed cryptojacking in\nmul�ple containers.\n\n1. The a�acker started by exploi�ng an unsecured Kubelet on the internet and searched for containers\nrunning inside the Kubernetes nodes. A�er finding container 1 in Node A, the a�acker a�empted to\nperform remote code execu�on (RCE) in container 1.\n\n[2. The a�acker downloaded tmate and issued a command to run it and establish a reverse shell to](https://tmate.io/)\ntmate.io from container 1. The a�acker then con�nued the a�ack with this tmate session.\n\n[3. From container 1, the a�acker used masscan to scan Kubernetes’s internal network and found](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)\nunsecured Kubelets in Node B and Node C. The a�acker then a�empted to deploy a malicious crypto\nmining script (xmr.sh) to containers managed by these Kubelets (containers 2-7).This site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for\n\npersonalized content and ads.

These files are either\nshell script or Executable Linkable Format (ELF). The IOC sec�on at the end of the blog contains the\nhash and details of each file.\n\n**Container 1: TDGG was dropped and executed via Kubelet. TDGG then subsequently downloaded**\nand executed tt.sh, api.key and tmate. The a�acker used the established tmate connec�on to\ndrop and run sGAU.sh, kshell, install_monerod.bash, setup_moneroocean_miner.sh\nand xmrig (MoneroOcean).\n\n**Container 2-7: xmr.sh was dropped and executed via Kubelet.**\n\n**Container 4: The a�acker also established a tmate session in this container. The a�acker then**\ndropped and executed pei.sh, pei64/32, xmr3.assi, aws2.sh, t.sh,\n```\ntmate,x86_64.so, xmrig and xmrig.so.\n\n```\n[Figure 2 maps the malware campaign’s TTP to MITRE ATT&CK tac�cs. The following sec�ons will](https://attack.mitre.org/)\ndetail the techniques used in each stage.\n\n_Figure 2. A�acker’s tac�cs, techniques and procedures._\n\n## Ini�al Access\n\n[kubelet is an agent running on each Kubernetes node. It takes RESTful requests from various](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#:~:text=The%20kubelet%20is%20the%20primary,object%20that%20describes%20a%20pod.)\ncomponents (mainly kube-apiserver) and performs pod-level opera�ons. Depending on the\nconfigura�on, kubelet may or may not accept unauthen�cated requests. Standard Kubernetes\n[deployments come with anonymous access to kubelet by default. However, most managed Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/#kubelet-authentication)\n[services such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Kubernetes](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)\n[opera�ons (Kops) all enforce proper authen�ca�on by default.](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)\n\n\nThis site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for\n\nWe discovered that TeamTNT gained ini�al access with the Hildegard malware by execu�ng commandspersonalized content and ads. By continuing to browse this site, you › **Cookie Settings**\n\nk b l t th t ll Thi hi d b i th k b l t’ d\n\n\n-----\n\n## Execu�on\n\nHildegard uses kubelet’s API to execute commands inside containers. The ini�al commands create a\ntmate reverse shell that allows the a�acker to carry out the subsequent opera�on. Unlike the\ntechniques that TeamTNT used in the past, this malware campaign did not pull or run any new\ncontainer image.\n\n## Privilege Escala�on\n\nAlthough Unit 42 researchers have not observed an a�empt to perform privilege escala�on, the\n[malware dropped two adversarial tools, Peirates and BOtB, which are capable of breaking out of](https://github.com/inguardians/peirates)\ncontainers via known vulnerabili�es or accessing cloud resources via exposed cloud creden�als.\n\n##### Container Breakout\n\nBOtB can perform a container breakout using a known vulnerability such as CVE-2019-5736. It can\nalso escape from privileged containers that have enabled CAPS and SYSCALLS.\n\n##### Access to Cloud Resources\n\nPeirates can gather mul�ple infrastructures and cloud creden�als. It looks for iden�ty and access\nmanagement (IAM) creden�als from cloud metadata services and service account tokens from the\nKubernetes clusters. With the iden�fied creden�als, it then further a�empts to move laterally or gain\ncontrol of the cluster. While we observed Peirates in use, the container it was executed in had no\ncreden�als.\n\n## Defense Evasion\n\n##### Library Injec�on\n\n[Hildegard uses LD_PRELOAD to hide the malicious process launched inside the containers. The](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)\nmalware modified the /etc/ld.so.preload file to intercept shared libraries’ imported func�ons. In\n[par�cular, the malware overwrites two func�ons: readdir() and readdir64(), which are](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man3/readdir.3.asp)\nresponsible for returning the directory entries in the file system. The overwri�en func�ons filter out\nqueries made to directory entries under /proc. The func�ons then drop queries with keywords such\nas tmate, xmrig and ziggy. This way, when applica�ons try to iden�fy the running processes (by reading\nfiles under /proc) in the containers, tmate, xmrig and ziggy will not be found. Linux tools such as This site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for [ps, top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html)\nand many other container monitoring tools will be blinded from these malicious processes.personalized content and ads.

Func�on that overwrites readdir64() in X86_64.so._\n\n##### Encrypted ELF Binary\n\n[Hildegard deploys an IRC agent built from the open-source project ziggystartux. To avoid being](https://github.com/isdrupter/ziggystartux)\ndetected by automated sta�c analysis tools, the ziggystartux ELF is encrypted and packed in another\nbinary (ziggy). When the binary is executed, the ziggystartux ELF is decrypted by a hardcoded\nAdvanced Encryp�on Standard (AES) key and executed in memory.\n\n\nThis site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for\npersonalized content and ads. By continuing to browse this site, you › **Cookie Settings**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### g\n\nThe malware names the IRC process “bioset”, which is the name of a well-known Linux kernel process\n```\nbioset. If one is only looking at the names of the running processes on a host, one can easily overlook\n\n```\nthis disguised process.\n\n**DNS Monitoring Bypass**\nThe malware modifies the system DNS resolvers and uses Google’s public DNS servers to avoid being\ndetected by DNS monitoring tools.\n\n_Figure 5. DNS resolver modifica�on._\n\n##### Delete Files and Clear Shell History\n\nAll the scripts are deleted immediately a�er being executed. TeamTNT also uses the “history -c”\ncommand to clear the shell log in every script.\n\n_Figure 6. The script clears the history and deletes itself._\n\n## Creden�al Access\n\nHildegard searches for creden�al files on the host, as well as queries metadata for cloud-specific\ncreden�als. The iden�fied creden�als are sent back to the C2.\n\nThe searched creden�als include:\n\n\nCloud access keys.\n\nThis site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for\npersonalized content and ads.

By continuing to browse this site, you › **Cookie Settings**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\nHildegard mainly uses the unsecured kubelet to move laterally inside a Kubernetes cluster. During the\ndiscovery stage, the malware finds the exploitable kubelets and the containers these kubelets manage.\nThe malware then creates C2 channels (tmate or IRC) and deploys malicious crypto miners in these\ncontainers. Although not observed by Unit 42 researchers, the a�acker may also move laterally with\nthe stolen creden�als.\n\n## Command and Control\n\nOnce gaining the ini�al foothold into a container, Hildegard establishes either a tmate session or an IRC\nchannel back to the C2. It is unclear how TeamTNT chooses and tasks between these two C2 channels,\nas both can serve the same purpose. At the �me of wri�ng, tmate sessions are the only way the\na�acker interacts with the compromised containers. Unit 42 researchers have not observed any\ncommands in the IRC channel. However, the IRC server’s metadata indicates that the server was\ndeployed on Jan. 9, 2021, and there are around 220 clients currently connected to the server.\n\n_Figure 9. Tmate named session created by the malware._\n\n_Figure 10.

The\ncryptojacking opera�on can quickly drain the en�re system’s resources and disrupt every applica�on in\n[the cluster. The xmrig mining process joins the supportxmr mining pool using the wallet address](https://supportxmr.com/)\n```\n428uyvSqdpVZL7HHgpj2T5SpasCcoHZNTTzE3Lz2H5ZkiMzqayy19sYDcBGDCjoWbTfLBnc3tc9\nrG4Y8gXQ8fJiP5tqeBda. At the �me of wri�ng, the malware campaign has ~25.05 KH/s hashing\n\n```\npower and there is 11 XMR (~$1,500) in the wallet.\n\n_Figure 12. Mining ac�vity on supportxmr._\n\n\nThis site uses cookies essential to its operation, for analytics, and for\npersonalized content and ads.

Given the abundant resources in a Kubernetes\ninfrastructure, a hijacked Kubernetes cluster can be more profitable than a hijacked Docker host. This\nnew TeamTNT malware campaign is one of the most complicated a�acks targe�ng Kubernetes. This is\nalso the most feature-rich malware we have seen from TeamTNT so far. In par�cular, the threat actor\nhas developed more sophis�cated tac�cs for ini�al access, execu�on, defense evasion and C2. These\nefforts make the malware more stealthy and persistent. Although the malware is s�ll under\ndevelopment and the campaign is not yet widely spread, we believe the a�acker will soon mature the\ntools and start a large-scale deployment.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from this threat by the Run�me](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nProtec�on features, Cryptominer Detec�on and by the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance\nProtec�on, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes configura�on and provides secure alterna�ves.\n\n_Figure 13.
