We asked him to try the Silent Push**\n**service to see how it could help him and his team to get their work done quicker. This**\n**is written in Mahesh’s own words and only uses one of our features, DNS Explore.**\n\n## Reconnaissance\n\nReconnaissance is performed to gain as much information on the target before beginning\nthe penetration testing. ‘Recon’ is an essential element of any penetration testing. Recon on\na target can be done in two ways: passive and active reconnaissance.\n\nDuring the recon process researchers try to collect information about the subdomains\nassociated with the target and their respective IP address. Most of today’s applications are\nprotected using WAFs and CDNs and it is often challenging to identify the real IP address\nassociated with an application. That is where the subdomains associated with the\napplication help researchers get more information about the main application and expand\nthe attack surface.\n\nThe Silent Push application can be used for passive reconnaissance quickly.\n\n**Case Study :**\n\nDomain : magicbricks.com\n\nFor the past few years I have been testing web applications and spend around 2 to 5 days\non collecting the information about each target. The information that I collect includes all the\ndomains that are associated with the company and their respective subdomains and IP\naddresses and information about the OS.\n\nThere are different search engines available for collections of the above information but\nthere is no single place where we can find more information at a time.\n\n\n-----\n\nI have worked on the application mentioned above a couple of months back and was not\nable to collect more information. Then I gave it a try with Silent Push and the information i\ngathered was just done in a few minutes, normally it will take me a few days to get that\ninformation from different sources.\n\nI started by using their Explore DNS feature which accepts wildcards.\n\n_Explore DNS history using wildcards proved very powerful_\n\nI first searched for Any records associated with the test domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Gathering all the DNS information in one place using Silent Push’s explore feature_\n\nI then realized I could use a wildcard and gather subdomains and see what CNAME records\nwere gathered and what IPs subdomains were using.\n\n_Gathering all subdomain info using a wildcard_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis allowed me to pivot off this information and see what else was pointed to the same\ninfrastructure.\n\n_I could see all A records pointing to the same IP straight away_\n\nI could enrich that information to find out more about ‘the neighbours’ and see what sort of\nreputation was associated with them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_This looked like a clean domain_\n\nSo in conclusion, even though I am not on a threat intelligence team, the simple data\ngathering capabilities of this part of the Silent Push application saved me enormous\namounts of time. Quite literally this saves me days per job. The use cases across entire\nsecurity teams is tremendous.\n\n## Subscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nThank you!\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
