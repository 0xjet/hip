    "plain_text": "# Malicious OAuth applications abuse cloud email services to spread spam\n\n**microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/22/malicious-oauth-applications-used-to-compromise-email-servers-and-spread-**\nspam/\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\nMicrosoft researchers recently investigated an attack where malicious OAuth applications\nwere deployed on compromised cloud tenants and then used to control Exchange Online\nsettings and spread spam. The investigation revealed that the threat actor launched credential\nstuffing attacks against high-risk accounts that didn’t have multi-factor authentication (MFA)\nenabled and leveraged the unsecured administrator accounts to gain initial access. The\nunauthorized access to the cloud tenant enabled the actor to create a malicious OAuth\napplication that added a malicious inbound connector in the email server. The actor then used\nthe malicious inbound connector to send spam emails that looked like they originated from the\ntargets’ domain. The spam emails were sent as part of a deceptive sweepstakes scheme\nmeant to trick recipients into signing up for recurring paid subscriptions.\n\nMicrosoft has been monitoring the rising popularity of OAuth application abuse. One of the first\n[observed malicious usage of OAuth applications in the wild is consent phishing. Consent](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/14/microsoft-delivers-comprehensive-solution-to-battle-rise-in-consent-phishing-emails/)\nphishing attacks aim to trick users into granting permissions to malicious OAuth apps to gain\naccess to user’s legitimate cloud services (mail servers, files storage, management APIs,\netc.). In the past few years, Microsoft has observed that more and more threat actors,\n[including nation-state actors, have been using OAuth applications for different malicious](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/25/nobelium-targeting-delegated-administrative-privileges-to-facilitate-broader-attacks/)\npurposes – command-and-control (C2) communication, backdoors, phishing, redirections, and\nso on.\n\nThis recent attack involved a network of single-tenant applications installed in compromised\norganizations being used as the actor’s identity platform to perform the attack. As soon as the\nnetwork was revealed, all the related applications were taken down and notifications to\ncustomers were sent, including recommended remediation steps.\n\nThis blog presents the technical analysis of this attack vector and the succeeding spam\ncampaign attempted by the threat actor. It also provides guidance for defenders on protecting\norganizations from this threat, and how Microsoft security technologies detect it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Overview of the attack chain. The time between application deployment and usage_\n_varied; there were cases where the actor took months before using the application._\n\n## Initial access\n\nFor the attack to succeed, the threat actor needed to compromise cloud tenant users with\nsufficient permissions that would allow the actor to create an application in the cloud\nenvironment and give it admin consent. The actor performed credential stuffing attacks against\ntheir targets, attempting to access users with the global admin role. The authentication\nattempts, which originated from a single IP address, were launched against the Azure Active\nDirectory PowerShell application (app ID: 1b730954-1685-4b74-9bfd-dac224a7b894). The\nsame application was later used to deploy the rest of the attack.\n\nBased on the success ratio of the authentication attempts, it is inferred that the attacker used\na dump of compromised credentials. The investigation also revealed that 86% of the\n[compromised tenants had at least one admin with a real-time high risk score, which means](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks)\nthey were flagged by Azure AD Identity Protection to be most likely compromised. It is also\nimportant to note that all the compromised admins didn’t have MFA enabled, which could have\nstopped the attack. These observations amplify the importance of securing accounts and\nmonitoring for high-risk users, especially those with high privileges.\n\n## Deploying malicious OAuth application\n\nOnce the threat actor gained access to privileged users, their next step was to set up the\nmalicious application. Based on analysis of the event user agent (SwaggerCodegen/1.4.0.0/csharp) and how quickly the deployment of the application was done, it is\nlikely that the actor ran a PowerShell script to perform the following Azure Active Directory\n(AAD) management activities in all targeted tenants:\n\n\n-----\n\nRegister a new single–tenant application with the naming convention of [domain\n_name]_([a-zA-Z]){3} (for example: Contoso_GhY)_\nAdd the legacy permission Exchange.ManageAsApp which can be used for app-only\nauthentication of Exchange Online PowerShell module\nGrant admin consent to the above permission\nGive global admin and Exchange Online admin roles to the previously registered\napplication\nAdd application credentials (key/certificate/both)\n\nThe threat actor added their own credentials to the OAuth application, which enabled them to\naccess the application even if the initially compromised global administrator changed their\npassword.\n\nThe activities mentioned gave the threat actor control of a highly privileged application. It was\nobserved that the threat actor did not always use the application right after it was deployed. In\nsome cases, it took weeks or months before the application was utilized. Also, in organizations\nthat didn’t monitor for suspicious applications, the applications were deployed for months and\nused multiple times by the threat actor.\n\n## Modifying Exchange Online settings\n\nThe threat actor used the privileged application to authenticate the Exchange Online\nPowerShell module and modify the Exchange Online settings. There were two modifications\nwhich allowed them to perform the next step in the attack chain:\n\n### Create a new inbound connector\n\n[Connectors are a collection of instructions that customize the way email flows to and from](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow/connectors/connectors?view=exchserver-2019)\norganizations using Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Most organizations using Microsoft 365 and\nOffice 365 don’t need custom connectors for regular mail flow, but some use it when they need\nto process messages from another messaging system that’s not running Exchange Online, or\nif they have a network appliance that performs policy checks and then routes messages to\ntheir Exchange Online service.\n\nThe threat actor set a new inbound connector with the naming convention Ran_([a-zA-Z]){5}\n(for example Ran_xAFzd). The purpose of the inbound connector was to allow mails from\ncertain IPs (that are related to the attacker’s infrastructure) to flow through the victim’s\nExchange Online service. This allowed the threat actor to send emails that looked like they\noriginated from the compromised Exchange domain. The configuration information for the\nnewly created connectors were seen in Exchange Online audit event New-InboundConnector.\nThe following table shows the configuration parameters in the audit event related to this\nchange:\n\n**Name** **Value**\n\n\n-----\n\n“Name” “Ran_jBelh”\n\n“Enabled” “True”\n\n“CloudServicesMailEnabled” “True”\n\n“RestrictDomainsToCertificate” “False”\n\n“SenderDomains” “smtp:*;1”\n\n“SenderIPAddresses” “170.75.174.97;170.75.172.8;170.75.170.69;170.75.174.95;\n54.39.94.145;149.56.200.36;158.69.21.185;66.70.201.131”\n\n“RestrictDomainsToIPAddresses” “True”\n\n“ConnectorSource” “HybridWizard”\n\n“EFSkipIPs” “170.75.174.97;170.75.172.8;170.75.170.69;170.75.174.95;\n54.39.94.145;149.56.200.36;158.69.21.185;66.70.201.131”\n\n“TreatMessagesAsInternal” “False”\n\n“ConnectorType” “OnPremises”\n\n“RequireTls” “False”\n\n### Create transport rules\n\n[Transport rules (also known as mail flow rules) are sets of actions that can be taken on any](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules)\nmail that flows in the organization. The threat actor utilized this feature to set 12 new transport\nrules with the naming convention of Test01 to Test012. Each of these transport rules were\nresponsible for deleting the following specific headers from every mail that flowed in the\norganization:\n\nX-MS-Exchange-ExternalOriginalInternetSender\nX-MS-Exchange-SkipListedInternetSender\nReceived-SPF\nReceived\nARC-Authentication-Results\nARC-Message-Signature\nDKIM-Signature\nARC-Seal\nX-MS-Exchange-SenderADCheck\nX-MS-Exchange-Authentication-Results\nAuthentication-Results\nX-MS-Exchange-AntiSpam-MessageData-ChunkCount\n\n\n-----\n\nBy deleting these headers, the attacker tried defense evasion to prevent security products or\nemail providers detecting or blocking their emails and increase the success rate of the spam\ncampaign. The configuration information for the newly created transport rules were seen in\nExchange Online audit event New-TransportRule. The following table shows the configuration\nparameters in the audit event related to this change:\n\n**Name** **Value**\n\n“Name” “Test06”\n\n“SenderAddressLocation” “Header”\n\n“RemoveHeader” “ARC-Message-Signature”\n\nThese modifications to the Exchange Online settings allowed the threat actor to perform their\nprimary goal in the attack: sending out spam emails. After each spam campaign, the actor\ndeleted the malicious inbound connector and transport rules to prevent detection, while the\napplication remained deployed in the tenant until the next wave of the attack (in some cases,\nthe app was dormant for months before it was reused by the threat actor).\n\nFigure 2. An example of the PowerShell script used for setting new Exchange Online\nconnector and transport rules\n\n## Spam email campaign sent through Exchange Online connector\n\nThe actor behind this attack has been actively running spam email campaigns for many years.\nBased on our research, this actor has sent high volumes of spam emails in short timeframes\nthrough other methods, such as connecting to mail servers from rogue IP addresses or\nsending directly from legitimate cloud-based bulk email sending infrastructure.\n\nThe actor’s motive was to propagate deceptive sweepstakes spam emails designed to trick\nrecipients into providing credit card details and signing up for recurring subscriptions under the\nguise of winning a valuable prize. While the scheme possibly led to unwanted charges for\ntargets, there was no evidence of overt security threats such as credential phishing or\nmalware distribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe spam campaign carried the hallmarks of this actor: programmatically generated\nmessages containing two visible hyperlinked images in the email body, as well as dynamic\nand randomized content injected within the HTML body of each mail message to evade spam\nfilters.\n\n_Figure 3. An example of spam email sent through the Exchange Online inbound connector_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hyperlinked images within the spam messages implied to recipients that they were eligible\nfor a prize. Once clicked, the hyperlink directed recipients to a website where they were asked\nto complete a survey and provide credit card details to pay for the shipping of their prize.\nFamiliar brand logos, names, and websites were used throughout the spam email, likely to\ngive an illusion of legitimacy.\n\n_Figure 4. Clicking the image in the spam email leads to this website indicating a prize has_\n_been won_\nThe fine print, visible only by scrolling to the very bottom of a subsequent page, revealed that\nin providing their credit card information, recipients were not paying a shipping fee for their\nprize, but were in fact agreeing to be charged fees for several paid subscription services in\norder to enter into a sweepstakes for the prize. It is likely the threat actor’s main motive was\npotential financial gain from people who fell victim to this deceptive sweepstakes spam\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. The fine print shows the chance to win a prize is only through a sweepstakes after_\n_paying fees_\nLikely to achieve scale and further maximize the chances of successful email delivery, the\nactor triggered this spam campaign from cloud-based outbound email infrastructure outside of\nMicrosoft, mainly Amazon SES and Mail Chimp. These email platforms enable sending of\nmass bulk email, normally for marketing and other legitimate purposes.\n\nThe campaign also utilized techniques to generate unique dynamic URLs underpinning the\nhyperlinked images within each spam email message, as shown in the examples below.\n\n_Figure 6. Examples of dynamic URL generation (domain obfuscated)_\nThis spam campaign exclusively targeted consumer email accounts. In the case of spam\nmessages sent to Microsoft-hosted consumer email accounts (outlook.com), the spam emails\nwere moved into customers’ junk folders before they could be viewed and clicked.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nWhile the follow-on spam campaign targets consumer email accounts, this attack targets\nenterprise tenants to use as infrastructure for this campaign. This attack thus exposes security\nweaknesses that could be used by other threat actors in attacks that could directly impact\naffected enterprises.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the main initial access vector of the attack was to obtain the admin s credentials, we\nrecommend organizations take the following steps to reduce their attack surface:\n\n### Mitigate credential guessing attacks risks\n\nA key step in reducing the attack surface is securing the identity infrastructure. The most\ncommon initial access vector observed in this attack was account compromise through\ncredential stuffing, and all the compromised administrator accounts did not have MFA enabled.\n[Implementing security practices that strengthen account credentials such as enabling MFA](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/steps-secure-identity)\nraises the cost of an attack.\n\n### Enable conditional access policies\n\n[Conditional access policies are evaluated and enforced every time the user attempts to sign](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)\nin. Organizations can protect themselves from attacks that leverage stolen credentials by\nenabling policies such as device compliance or trusted IP address requirements.\n\n### Enable continuous access evaluation\n\n[Continuous access evaluation (CAE) revokes access in real time when changes in user](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation)\nconditions trigger risks, such as when a user is terminated or moves to an untrusted location.\n\n### Enable security defaults\n\nWhile some of the features mentioned above require paid subscriptions, the security defaults\nin Azure AD, which is mainly for organizations using the free tier of Azure Active Directory\nlicensing, are sufficient to better protect the organizational identity platform, as they provide\npreconfigured security settings such as MFA, protection for privileged activities, and others.\n\n## Detections for related techniques\n\n[Leveraging its cross-signal capabilities, Microsoft 365 Defender alerts customers using](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\n[Microsoft Defender for Office 365,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-office-365) [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-cloud-apps) Application governance\nadd-on, and [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection to detect the techniques covered in the](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/azure-active-directory-identity-protection)\nattack through the attack chain.

Note, however, that these alerts may\nalso be triggered by unrelated threat activity. We’re listing them here because we recommend\nthat these alerts be investigated and remediated immediately.\n\n**Email messages from a campaign removed after delivery​. This alert is generated when**\n[any messages associated with a campaign are delivered to mailboxes in an organization.](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/campaigns?view=o365-worldwide)\nMicrosoft removes the infected messages from Exchange Online mailboxes using zero-hour\nauto purge (ZAP) if this event occurs.\n\n### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps\n\n**Activity from suspicious IP addresses. This alert is generated when there is activity from an**\nIP address that has been identified as risky by Microsoft Threat Intelligence or by the\norganization. These IP addresses were identified as being involved in malicious activities,\nsuch as performing password spray, botnet C2, and may indicate a compromised account.\n\n**Activity from a password-spray associated IP address. This alert is generated when a**\nsuccessful sign-in from an IP address that had been identified as participating in password\nspray was observed.\n\n### App governance\n\n\n-----\n\n[App governance is an add-on to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, which can detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-manage-app-governance)\nmalicious OAuth applications that make sensitive Exchange Online Administrative activities\n[along with other threat detection alerts. Activity related to this campaign will trigger the](https://docs.microsoft.com/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-anomaly-detection-alerts)\nfollowing alert:\n\n**OAuth app with suspicious metadata has exchange permission​. This alert is generated**\nwhen a line of business OAuth app with suspicious metadata has privilege to manage\npermission over Exchange Online, which can lead an OAuth App to perform data collection or\nexfiltration activities or attempts to access and retrieve sensitive information.\n\n### Azure AD Identity Protection\n\nAzure AD Identity Protection automatically detects and remediates identity-based risks. It\ndetects suspicious sign-in attempts and raises any of the following alerts:\n\n**Anomalous Token. This alert flags a token’s unusual characteristics, such as its token**\nlifetime or played from an unfamiliar location.\n**Unfamiliar sign-in properties. In this phishing campaign, the attackers used multiple**\nproxies or VPNs originating from various countries or regions unfamiliar to the target\nuser.This alert flags anomalies in the token claims, token age, and other authentication\nattributes.\n**Anonymous IP address. This alert flag sign-in attempts from anonymous IP addresses**\n(for example, Tor browser or anonymous VPN).\n\n## Hunting queries\n\nTo locate related activity, Microsoft 365 Defender customers can run the following advanced\nhunting queries:\n\n**Applications given the “Exchange.ManageAsApp” permission:**\n```\nCloudAppEvents\n\n| where Timestamp > ago(30d)\n\n| where ActionType == \"Add app role assignment to service principal.\"\n\n| where RawEventData.ResultStatus == \"Success\"\n\n| where RawEventData has \"dc50a0fb-09a3-484d-be87-e023b12c6440\" //Exchange.ManageAsApp\nRole Id\n\n| project Timestamp, AccountObjectId,AccountDisplayName, AppId =\nRawEventData.ModifiedProperties[0].NewValue, AppName =\nRawEventData.ModifiedProperties[6].NewValue\n\n```\n**New transport rules that remove anti-spam headers from emails:**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nCloudAppEvents\n\n| where ActionType == \"New-TransportRule\"\n\n| mvexpand Param = RawEventData.Parameters\n\n| where Param.Name == \"RemoveHeader\" and Param.Value contains \"X-MS-Exchange-AntiSpamMessageData\"\n\n| project Timestamp, AccountObjectId, AccountDisplayName, ServicePrincipalId =\ntostring(RawEventData.AppId)\n\n```\n**Update 09/23/2022 – Updated instances ‘Exchange server’ to ‘Exchange Online” to**\nclarify that attackers were not able to compromise on-premises Exchange servers, but\nthat the permissions they gained during their compromise of cloud tenants allowed the\nattackers to modify Exchange Online settings.\n\n\n-----",
