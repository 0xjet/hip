This approach is used in order\nto give end-users more time to update their vulnerable devices before the same bug is\nweaponized by other threat actors.\n\nCVE-2021-1048 marks the sixth Android zero-day vulnerability that was exploited this year.\n\n[Google patched similar zero-days in the January and](https://therecord.media/google-android-bug-detected-exploited-in-the-wild/) [May Android security bulletins as well.](https://therecord.media/arm-and-qualcomm-zero-days-quietly-patched-in-this-months-android-security-updates/)\n\nThe previous zero-days didn’t impact the Android OS kernel itself but rather add-on\ncomponents from Qualcomm and Arm, respectively.\n\n**[CVE-2021-11261 – Memory management logic error in Qualcomm kgsl graphics driver.](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-01-01.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[CVE-2021-1905 – Use-after-free vulnerability in Qualcomm GPU.](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-05-01.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-1906 – Improper error handling in Qualcomm GPU.](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-05-01.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-28663 – Use-after-free vulnerability in Arm’s Mali GPU.](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-05-01.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-28664 – Writes to read-only memory bug in Arm’s Mali GPU.](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-05-01.html)**\n\nWhile six vulnerabilities were exploited in Android devices before patches were available\n(hence the zero-day categorization), Apple has had a harder time this year and the company\npatched 15 zero-days this year that impacted its iOS/iPhone userbase.\n\nTags\n\n[Android](https://therecord.media/tag/android/)\n[Android security bulletin](https://therecord.media/tag/android-security-bulletin/)\n[Google](https://therecord.media/tag/google/)\n[security update](https://therecord.media/tag/security-update/)\n[vulnerability disclosure](https://therecord.media/tag/vulnerability-disclosure/)\n[zero-day](https://therecord.media/tag/zero-day/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
