It is known for its rapid\nreleases and has seen at least ten different releases since its inception. The malware is advertised and\nsold on underground forums, and despite being banned for allowing the targeting of Russian and/or\nformer USSR entities, it is still being actively sold. The fee structure starts at $250 for 30 days of\naccess, making it an affordable and attractive option for cybercriminals.\n\nRhadamanthys is a full-featured information stealer that supports collecting system information,\ncredentials, cryptocurrency wallets, browser passwords, cookies, and a wide range of other\napplications. It includes numerous anti-analysis techniques that complicate analysis efforts and make it\ndifficult for the malware to run successfully in a sandbox environment.\n\nInsikt Group obtained and analyzed the most recent version of Rhadamanthys, 0.7.0, and noted many\nnew features that have been added. The most innovative new feature is its ability to use AI (via optical\ncharacter recognition [OCR]) to extract cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases from images automatically.\nThis feature has client- and server-side components that allow Rhadamanthys to identify seed phrase\nimage candidates on the client and fully extract the seed phrase after the image has been exfiltrated\nback to the malware's command-and-control server. Additionally, a new feature was added to allow\nthreat actors to run and install Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) files, which may not be flagged as\nmalicious by conventional detection systems.\n\nRhadamanthys is a popular choice for cybercriminals. Coupled with its rapid development and\ninnovative new features, it is a formidable threat all organizations should be aware of. Organizations are\nencouraged to implement the mitigation strategies outlined in this report. In addition to the mitigations,\nvarious detections are available to identify Rhadamanthys and a mutex kill switch is described in the\nreport that can be used as a vaccine against current infections.\n\nInformation stealers represent a significant threat to organizational security. The widespread practice of\npassword reuse exacerbates this issue, as credentials stolen from personal accounts can often be\nleveraged to gain unauthorized access to corporate systems. For example, an attacker could retrieve an\nindividual's personal email and password from a compromised social media account and then use that\nsame password to infiltrate their professional email account, especially if the email address can be\neasily guessed or found on professional networking sites like LinkedIn.\n\nAdditionally, the increasing overlap between personal and professional use of devices further\ncomplicates the security landscape. Employees frequently use work laptops for personal activities,\ninadvertently downloading infostealers through malicious advertisements or compromised websites.\nSimilarly, when individuals log in to work accounts from personal devices, those credentials may\nbecome compromised if an employee or their family member unknowingly becomes infected with an\ninfostealer. These scenarios underscore the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures, including\n\n1 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nstringent password policies, regular employee training on safe browsing practices, and rigorous access\ncontrols to mitigate the risks posed by infostealers and compromised credentials.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - Rhadamanthys, now in its latest version, 0.7.0, is a rapidly evolving malware family that\ncontinuously updates with new features, making it a formidable weapon for cybercriminals. It is\nglobal, affecting various sectors and regions, with most targets in North and South America.\n\n  - Insikt Group identified a killswitch to prevent Rhadamanthys from executing its stealers and\nextensions by setting known Rhadamanthys mutexes on a non-infected machine.\n\n  - Rhadamanthys, leading the trend of incorporating AI into malware with client-side features like\nOCR for extracting seed phrases from images, demonstrates how AI is weaponized to enhance\ndata theft and is expected to remain at the forefront of this evolving trend.\n\n  - The threat actor “kingcrete2022\", the developer of Rhadamanthys, is banned on both XSS and\nExploit Forums. The ban was imposed because the threat actor had been accused of targeting\nRussian and/or former USSR entities. Currently, the threat actor relies on private messaging via\nTOX, Telegram, and Jabber to continue advertising new versions of the Rhadamanthys stealer.\n\n  - Insikt Group has identified a new feature of Rhadamanthys involving the use of MSI packages,\nrepresenting an additional defense evasion technique. MSI files, typically associated with\nlegitimate software installations, often bypass security scrutiny because they are perceived as\ntrustworthy and may not be detected by conventional systems.\n\n  - Rhadamanthys has a built-in way to prevent re-execution within a configurable time frame. In\nversion 0.7.0, the author updated this feature to make it tamper-proof through encryption and\nhashing.\n\n2 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Background\n\nRhadamanthys is an advanced information stealer that first appeared in the cybercrime ecosystem in\nSeptember 2022. The malware is attributed to an individual or group known under the alias\n“kingcrete2022”. kingcrete2022 started advertising the malware on various special-access forums,\nincluding XSS, Exploit, Best Dark, Opencard, and Center-Club, with the following fee structure.\n\n**License Type** **30 Days** **90 Day**\n\nNormal $250 $550\n\nVIP $300 $750\n\n**_Table 1: Rhadmanthys fee structure (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThe threat actor used different handles on different forums, including “kingcrete2022” on Exploit\n(currently banned for unknown reasons), “freeide” on XSS (currently banned for targeting Russian\nand/or former USSR entities, as shown in Figure 1 below), “kingcrete” on Opencard and Best Dark, and\n“rhadamanthys” on Center-Club.\n\nThe threat actor uses TOX\n(5BCB80569AC334FDA5B7806ABC05DDFE3AF8F126E08D0EA6D21DA3C13B43F164188C3EEE89E9),\nan open-source, free, and encrypted communication protocol favored by many Russian- and\nEnglish-speaking threat actors as a contact method. The threat actor also uses Telegram (@kingcrete),\nJabber (rhadamanthys@exploit[.]im), and kingcrete2022@thesecure[.]biz for communication.

The second video was named “Wallter crack & Customized dictionaries”, which\nshowed how the infostealer targets cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n5 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion 0.7.0 is the most recent version of the Rhadamanthys stealer, released in late June 2024.\nAccording to the banner message on TOX, the threat actor is working on Version 0.8.\n\n#### Malware Capabilities and Versions\n\n[Rhadamanthys targets Windows operating systems and is designed to collect system information,](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-v0-5-0-a-deep-dive-into-the-stealers-components/)\ncredentials, cryptocurrency wallets, browser passwords, and cookies, among others. The stealers’\ncollection targets are comprehensive, covering many targets, from major web browsers like Google\n[Chrome to less common software such as the Pale Moon browser and Auvitas Wallet. The stealer not](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-the-everything-bagel-infostealer/)\nonly exfiltrates data automatically upon infection but also allows operators the flexibility to deploy\nextensions and execute additional commands on compromised machines. The extensibility, constant\nupdates, and feature expansions make Rhadamanthys a formidable tool for cybercriminals​.\n\n**Anti-Behavioral Analysis: Rhadamanthys employs techniques to avoid behavioral**\nanalysis by analysis tools. These methods include timing and delay checks and\nmonitoring for memory-write actions, making it harder for security researchers to trace its\nactions.\n\n**Anti-static Analysis: Rhadamanthys uses static analysis evasion techniques, including**\nobfuscating its executable code, which makes it challenging for analysts to dissect and\ncomprehend the malware’s underlying structure.\n\n**Defense Evasion: Rhadamanthys uses sophisticated evasion tactics to bypass detection,**\nincluding encrypting and encoding its files to obscure its contents, hijacking execution\nflow by exploiting legitimate Windows function calls, and altering file and directory\npermissions to avoid being flagged by security tools.\n\n**Execution: Rhadamanthys can leverage shared modules and command or scripting**\ninterpreters, such as PowerShell, to execute malicious payloads, enhancing its versatility\nin different environments.\n\n**Collection: Rhadamanthys collects data from infected systems, including credentials,**\nbrowser data, system information, and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n**Command-and-Control: Rhadamanthys communicates with a command-and-control**\nserver to receive instructions and exfiltrate stolen data. It typically uses HTTP/HTTPS\nprotocols.\n\n#### Malware Versions\n\nMultiple versions of Rhadamanthys have been developed, with each iteration adding more features and\nrefining existing ones. The malware’s core capabilities have remained unchanged, focusing on\n\n6 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation stealing, but its deployment and execution have evolved. Reviewing the change logs on the\ndeveloper's Telegram account, we identified the versions below and summarized their change logs. The\nchange logs can be found in Appendix B.\n\n**_Figure 3: Rhadamanthys version timeline (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n  - **Version 0.4.0 provided major changes that were incompatible with prior versions. This version**\nalso required users to back up their configurations before updating and included new installation\ninstructions and server panel access details.\n\n  - **Version 0.4.1 implemented critical fixes, such as preventing global download tasks from**\ntriggering when certain records were empty and addressing a significant security vulnerability\nrelated to panel session management. New features like customizable Telegram notification\ntemplates and enhanced support for third-party encryption services were also introduced.\n\n  - **Version 0.4.5 improved the client and panel by including a dedicated shim server and full**\ntransport layer security (TLS) support. It also added the capability to perform terminal operations\ndirectly from the panel. This update also focused on enhancing log export capabilities and\nimplementing a download loader task system.\n\n  - With version 0.4.8, the client was completely rewritten to include independent encryption keys\nfor each build, with extensive testing across various Windows versions. Server-side\nenhancements included password cracking algorithms, URL validity detection, and the ability to\nhandle multiple crypt services.\n\n  - **Version 0.4.9 focused on refining existing features, such as resolving issues with log export**\nrecords and enhancing panel search functionality. Improvements were also made to the\nTelegram notification system and stub cleanup processes.\n\n  - **Version 0.5.0 introduced observer mode and stub construction options and significantly**\nimproved the client execution process. It also expanded wallet cracking capabilities, improved\nDiscord token acquisition, and upgraded panel search settings. This version added a plug-in\nmodule for task execution and introduced keylogger and data spy plug-ins, supporting\nsecondary development.\n\n7 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - **Version 0.5.1 included a new Clippers plug-in, enhanced Telegram notification options, Google**\nAccount Cookie Recovery, and default build stub cleaning to bypass Windows Defender.\n\n  - **Version 0.5.2 enhanced the Shim Server disconnection detection with backend servers to better**\nidentify and repair connection issues. Clippers plug-in version 0.2 fixed bugs related to repeated\nuploads and log paging, introduced a full-text replacement feature for various copy operations\nand added a switch to ensure addresses were replaced only once. The reverse proxy plug-in\nnow requires a separate virtual private server (VPS) for installation, with updates affecting only\nserver-side files, ensuring no disruption to the running client system.\n\n  - **Version 0.6.0 enhanced server and panel functionalities, including geo- and IP- blocking,**\noptimized log writing processes, and added support for new extended wallets. This version also\nimproved the protection of the index database, simplified directory compositions for better\ncompatibility with automatic processing tools, and enhanced stub cleaning and Windows\nDefender bypass features.\n\n  - **Version 0.7.0, the most recent version, includes a complete rewrite of both client-side and**\nserver-side frameworks, improving the program's execution stability. Additionally, 30\nwallet-cracking algorithms, AI-powered graphics, and PDF recognition for phrase extraction\nwere added. The text extraction capability was enhanced to identify multiple saved phrases.\nBugs and issues from the previous version were resolved. The Telegram module was rewritten to\nsupport HTML formatting and multi-token polling, while the synchronization module now\nincludes file transfer protocol (FTP) support for remote log transfers. The search filter module\nhas been rewritten, and an application programming interface (API) interface with an open\nplatform has been introduced.\n\n#### Rhadamanthys Identity Intelligence and Incidents\n\nRecorded Future collects and analyzes [malware log files](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/malware-logs.pdf) from various information stealers advertised\non underground markets. This data provides unique insight into information stealers' victimology and\nthe markets in which they are advertised. The data [analyzed](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/identity-intelligence-module.pdf) from Rhadamanthys malware logs, as per\nRecorded Future Identity Intelligence, shows that Rhadamanthys is used globally, with most targets in\nNorth America and Brazil (see Figure 4).\n\n8 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Rhadamanthys victimology geographic locations (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nAlthough only a few uses of Rhadamanthys have been reported publicly, several notable events from\nthe last twelve months are listed below.\n\n  - In October 2023, Rhadamanthys [was dropped](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/ghostpulse-haunts-victims-using-defense-evasion-bag-o-tricks) in an attack using the GHOSTPULSE loader.\nRhadamanthys is delivered via [MSIX installers masquerading as legitimate software like Google](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview)\nChrome or Webex. GHOSTPULSE uses advanced techniques, including side-loading malicious\ndynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and encrypting payloads, to evade detection by security tools​.\n\n  - [In February 2024, Rhadamanthys was distributed](https://cofense.com/blog/recently-updated-rhadamanthys-stealer-delivered-in-federal-bureau-of-transportation-campaign/) through a phishing campaign targeting the oil\nand gas sector. The emails spoofed the Federal Bureau of Transportation and referenced a\nvehicle incident urging the recipient to download a malicious ZIP file containing an executable.\n\n  - [In March 2024, TA547 targeted](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta547-targets-german-organizations-rhadamanthys-stealer) German organizations with a phishing campaign impersonating\nthe German retail company Metro. The emails contained password-protected ZIP files containing\nmalicious LNK files. Executing the LNK files runs a PowerShell script that decodes and executes\nRhadamanthys in memory without writing it to disk. This attack chain likely uses a large language\nmodel (LLM)-generated PowerShell script that introduces a novel tactic that leverages\nmachine-generated code for delivery while the payload remains the same​.\n\n9 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - In August 2024, Rhadamanthys was [delivered via phishing emails targeting Israeli users. The](https://cybersecuritynews.com/rhadamanthys-stealer-rar-credentials/)\nemails contained a password-protected RAR archive that, once extracted, revealed an exe, dll,\nand image file. When executed, Rhadamanthys was dropped and run.\n\n## Threat/Technical Analysis\n\nInsikt Group analyzed a sample of Rhadamanthys v0.7.0 and found that its core functionalities have not\n[changed significantly from v0.5.0. The Rhadamanthys modules](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-v0-5-0-a-deep-dive-into-the-stealers-components/) [and XS](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/from-hidden-bee-to-rhadamanthys-the-evolution-of-custom-executable-formats/) custom binary format remain the\nsame, as does its overall infection chain, which relies on the below three stages and multiple modules\nloaded at runtime (Figure 5).\n\n  - **Stage 1 (Unpacking and Loading of Stage 2): Stage 2 shellcode is copied to the '.textbss'**\nsection of the portable executable (PE) file, which is then executed. This marks the beginning of\nthe unpacking and loading process for Stage 2.\n\n  - **Stage 2 (Prepare System and Download Stealers from C2): The system is prepared for further**\nexploitation by performing process injection, unhooking, and various process and evasion\nchecks. It then loads the proto.x86 and netclient.x86 modules to communicate with the C2\nserver and subsequently loads the CoreDLL (Stage 3).\n\n  - **Stage 3 (Run Stealers): Various modules are loaded, and default stealers are executed.**\nImage/OCR processing and additional extensions are also run. The system then reports the\ncollected data back to the C2 server.\n\n10 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n11 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n12 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n13 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nNine mutexes are opened by Rhadamanthys using the Windows API function `OpenMutexW().

In terms of false positives, even if the formats matched precisely, the odds of using the same\nbytes as Rhadamanthys would make the occurrence of a false positive highly unlikely.\n\n#### Re-Execution Delay Feature\n\nRhadamanthys contains a feature to prevent re-execution within a configurable time frame. The unique\nregistry values used by this feature can be used to detect live and historical Rhadamanthys infections.\n\nThe configurable time frame for the re-execution delay is specified in minutes. It is contained in offsets\nfive and six in the Rhadamanthys configuration (see Figure 10) and is calculated by taking the integer\nvalue of the two bytes. For Rhadamanthys v0.7.0, the twelve bytes in the configuration at offset 12\n```\n(hex 0x0c) are used as a nonce during ChaCha20 encryption of the timestamp information.\n\n```\n**_Figure 10: Rhadamanthys’s configuration and re-execution value (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nAt startup, Rhadamanthys retrieves the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970,\nvia the time() function.\n\nThe re-execution delay feature implementation steps are:\n\n1. SHA1 of the timestamp obtained at startup is calculated.\n2. SHA1 of the timestamp is added to the front of a 128-byte buffer.\n3. A null byte and then the timestamp itself is added to the above 128-byte buffer.\n4. The above 128-byte buffer is encrypted using ChaCha20 with the following crypto parameters:\n\n    - 64-byte key: SHA256 hash of the C2 URL against a zero-filled 128-byte buffer\n\n    - 12-byte nonce: Taken from the configuration at offset 12 (hex 0x0c)\n\n    - Counter: 64\n5.

The classes.dex file serves as the extension and contains several key elements:\n\n  - License check\n\n  - Loader code\n\n21 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n- LZMA-compressed extension in XS2 format\n\n\nThis new structure allows Rhadamanthys to enhance its functionality further and maintain its\nadaptability in malware operations.\n\nExtensions in Rhadamanthys are loaded and executed in a six-step process involving the CoreDLL and\nTaskCore modules:\n\n1. TaskCore is injected into a process on the injected host.\n2. CoreDLL sends the extension to TaskCore via a Named Pipe.\n3. TaskCore verifies the extension's license to ensure it is valid for execution.\n4. The extension is decompressed.\n5. TaskCore executes the decompressed extension.\n6. The compressed extension package is sent to TaskCore for further operations.\n\nThis process ensures that only licensed extensions are run and allows for efficient transmission and\nexecution of malicious components.\n\n**_Figure 18: Rhadamanthys extension loading (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n22 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Keylogger\n\n\nThe keylogger extension provides standard keylogging functionality. The core functionality revolves\naround hooking keystrokes, recording key presses and releases, and logging active window details to\ncontextualize the stolen data. It achieves this by leveraging the GetKeyboardLayout API to understand\nkeyboard layouts and correctly interpret keystrokes, regardless of language settings. The\n```\nGetKeyState API helps track the state of special keys like Shift, Ctrl, and Alt, ensuring the\n\n```\naccurate capture of uppercase characters and key combinations. The malware monitors active\nwindows by polling the GetForegroundWindow API and recording titles and process IDs through\n```\nGetWindowTextW and GetWindowThreadProcessId.\n\n```\nThe keylogger also monitors the clipboard, exhibiting an intent to capture sensitive data often copied by\nusers. The code explicitly uses a combination of `IsClipboardFormatAvailable`,\n`OpenClipboard`, `GetClipboardData`, and `GlobalLock` to detect when text content is copied,\naccess the clipboard data, and read it.\n\nThe keylogger parses the config.dat, which is loaded in memory and passed from the CoreDLL,for\nthe configuration items in Table 4:\n\n|Configuration Item|Description|\n|---|---|\n|bufsize|Record keyboard content buffer size.|\n|interval|The maximum interval time to wait for sending. If the interval exceeds the last sending time and the keyboard buffer is not full, the data must be sent to the server.|\n|max clip|Records the maximum number of bytes copied to the clipboard simultaneously. If the text data in the clipboard exceeds this setting, it will be discarded.|\n|filters|A base64 string, which only performs keylogging of the process name set in the filter. The process names are not case-sensitive and are separated by a comma.|\n\n\n**_Table 4: Keylogger configuration items (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n\n##### Data Spy\n\n\n[The purpose of the data spy plug-in is to steal login information. As of now, it targets remote desktop](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rhadamanthys-stealer-malware-evolves-with-more-powerful-features/)\nprotocol (RDP) credentials. Given the focus on remote access tools, future extension developments\nwould likely include stealing credentials for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops or virtual private network\n(VPN) solutions.\n\n23 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Clipper\n\n\nClipper is a cryptocurrency clipper malware designed to hijack clipboard operations and steal funds by\nreplacing copied wallet addresses with those controlled by the attacker. The clipper demonstrates\ncapabilities in identifying cryptocurrency addresses using a multi-faceted approach.\n\n  - First, the clipper uses pattern-matching techniques, using the built-in list of wallets and the\nreplacement values found in the —wallet-dict= parameter passed in the configuration file\n```\n   config.dat, which is in memory.\n\n```\n  - The clipper then implements checksum algorithms for each recognized cryptocurrency, ensuring\nonly valid target addresses and maintaining high accuracy in targeting a wide range of\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nApart from the dictionary mentioned above parameter, the configuration also contains the keys in the\ntable below.\n\n|Configuration Item|Description|\n|---|---|\n|fulltext|Enables address replacement over a full-text search and replace|\n|once|Restricts replacing the same address to only one time|\n|wallet-dict|Contains the list of target addresses to replace|\n\n\n**_Table 5: Clipper configuration items (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n\n##### Reverse Proxy\n\n\nThe reverse proxy looks for the –server value in the config.dat containing the reverse proxy server\nto connect to and routes traffic to that address.\n\n|Configuration Item|Description|\n|---|---|\n|server|Provides the reverse proxy connection details|\n\n\n**_Table 6: Reverse proxy configuration items (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n\n## Mitigations\n\n\n#### Mutex Kill Switch\n\n\nBy setting the known Rhadamanthys mutexes in the table below on a non-infected machine, a\nkillswitch/vaccine to prevent Rhadamanthys from running its stealers and extensions can be created.\n\n24 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, general hardening and logging techniques should be implemented to detect and mitigate\nattack methods commonly associated with stealer activity. Examples of these mitigations are listed\nbelow:\n\n  - **User Training: Train employees on how to spot phishing emails and other common initial access**\nmethods used by threat actors to deliver stealer malware.\n\n  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Use MFA for credentials to make using them more difficult**\nfor threat actors. However, please note that MFA can still be bypassed with session cookies.\n\n  - **Least Privilege Access: Follow the principle of least privilege by granting users and devices only**\nthe minimum level of access needed for their job functions. If remote access solutions are\ncrucial to daily operations, all remote access services and protocols (for example, Citrix and\nRDP) should be implemented with multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n  - **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Implement SIEM solutions to centralized**\nlog security incidents across the network.\n\n  - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Deploy EDR solutions on endpoints to monitor**\nsuspicious behavior commonly associated with stealer malware.\n\n  - **Recorded Future Hunting Packages: Implement YARA, Sigma, and SNORT rules like the ones in**\nRecorded Future Hunting Packages.\n\n  - **Credential Leaks: Look for or create Recorded Future alerts for your credentials in dumps and**\ncriminal sale sources. A reset is recommended for every access method to any discovered\ncredentials (cookies, sessions, passwords, and so on).\n\n## Outlook\n\nRhadamanthys has a rapid development cycle and is consistently evolving, with new versions being\nworked on even as the previous ones are released. This dynamic nature is evident when work on\nversion 0.8.0 began after version 0.7.0 was released. Each version introduces significant enhancements\nin functionality, security, and evasion techniques. With the addition of AI features in 0.7.0 enhancing\nimage detection capabilities, more advanced AI functionalities will probably be present in future\n\n25 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nreleases. While the detections and kill switch discussed in this report will prove valuable overall, the\nmalware's consistent introduction of new features and evasion techniques will soon render the\ndetections useless, continuing the difficult nature of detection engineering.\n\nRhadamanthys’s global reach includes multiple campaigns targeting regions from North America to\nEurope and beyond. It is a popular tool in cybercriminal circles, supported by its versatile attack vectors\nand flexible plug-in system, making it a significant player in the underground malware market. Given\nthis widespread adoption and continuous development, its influence will likely persist globally​.\n\n26 MTP-2024-0926 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\n\n**Tactic: Technique** **Description** **ATT&CK**\n**Code**\n\n**Initial Access: Phishing** Rhadamanthys is distributed via phishing campaigns, often T1566\nusing email attachments like LNK files to deliver the malware.\n\n**Execution: Command** Rhadamanthys uses PowerShell scripts as part of its T1059\nand Scripting Interpreter infection process, leveraging encoded commands to execute\n\nits payload.\n\n**Execution: User** The infection often starts with user interaction, such as T1204\nExecution executing an LNK file from a phishing email.\n\n**Defense Evasion:** Rhadamanthys uses multiple stages of obfuscation, including T1027\nObfuscated Files or PowerShell scripts and encoded payloads, to evade\nInformation detection.\n\n**Defense Evasion:** The malware uses signed binaries, such as AppLaunch.exe, T1218\nSigned Binary Proxy to execute its code and evade detection.\nExecution\n\n**Defense Evasion:** Rhadamanthys injects code into legitimate processes to T1055\nProcess Injection avoid detection and ensure its malicious payload runs under\n\nthe radar.\n\n**Defense Evasion:** Rhadamanthys includes anti-virtual machine.
