Because of this opportunity,\nit is incredibly important for the CTV ecosystem and brands to work together through a collectively\nprotected advertising supply chain to ensure fraud is recognized, addressed and eliminated as\nquickly as possible as bad actors always follow the money. Ad fraud can happen when you buy\ninventory through unprotected channels. Ad fraud can be eliminated quickly through protected\nchannels where there are direct relationships, trust, and full transparency. Working together\nthrough a collectively protected supply chain will ensure the ecosystem realizes the full benefits of\ncreating a great CTV customer experience that is ad fraud free.\n\nA new CTV ad fraud operation—named ICEBUCKET—started in a part of programmatic\nadvertising where the supply chain is less transparent, sellers are not reported in sellers.json files,\nand buyers and sellers typically don't have a direct relationship. The bad actors behind\nICEBUCKET had a good thing going until they tried to expand and scale their efforts, including\nthe partners we protect. However, by working with our partners, we blocked the attack, protected\nand shared data across our partner network, and improved the efficacy of our platform to ensure\nwe stay ahead of ad fraud and the bad actors behind it. Our success speaks to the long-term\nplanning, processes, and practices in place between us and our partners.\n\n[The White Ops Satori Threat Intelligence and Research team recently uncovered the largest and](https://www.whiteops.com/satori)\nwidest Connected TV (CTV) related fraud operation to date. At its peak, the ICEBUCKET bot\n**operation impersonated more than 2 million people in over 30 countries. The operation**\ncounterfeited over 300 different publishers, stealing advertising spend by tricking advertisers into\nthinking there were real people on the other side of the screen, when in reality, these were bots\npretending to be real people watching TV. The operation hid its sophisticated bots within the\n\n\n-----\n\nlimited signal and transparency of server side ad insertion (SSAI) backed video ad impressions.\n[The White Ops Bot Mitigation Platform is able to detect this fraud scheme and protect partners](https://www.whiteops.com/products/platform)\nfrom falling victim to this operation, and similar ones.\n\nHere are the details on how the ICEBUCKET operation was detected and stopped from impacting\na collectively protected supply chain. In an effort to further protect advertisers, we lay out our\nrecommendations to the CTV ecosystem and brands to remain fraud free.\n\n\n## One Ice, Two Ice, 28% Ice\n\nThe ICEBUCKET operation is the largest case of SSAI spoofing that has been uncovered to date.\nAccording to our internal data, near its peak nearly 28% of the programmatic CTV traffic White\nOps has visibility into, or around 1.9 billion ad requests per day for the month of January\n**came from this single operation.**\n\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n\n0%\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||IC|EB|UC|KE|T|||\n|||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||\n\n\nJan 01, 2020 Jan 31, 2020\n**Date**\n\n\n_Figure 1: percentage of programmatic CTV traffic implicated in this operation for January 2020._\n\nIn January 2020, 66% of programmatic CTV-related SSAI traffic and 15% of programmatic\nmobile-related SSAI traffic that White Ops protects was a part of this scheme. When we look at\nthe devices the operation used, we see various CTV devices alongside the mobile traffic. The top\nspoofed devices in this scheme are given below. Some of the devices that the fraudsters spoofed\nin this operation are from discontinued product lines. White Ops provided information into this\nthreat to Roku, which allowed them to check the results against their internal systems. They\nconfirmed the spoofing nature of the operation, as there was no ICEBUCKET activity on the Roku\nplatform.\n\n\n_Table 1: Proportion of ICEBUCKET traffic in January 2020 for various declared devices_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis operation masqueraded SSAI servers by\ngenerating traffic for fictional edge devices\n(specifically CTV and mobile devices) into the\nad tech ecosystem. To do this, the operation\nused:\n\nMore than 1,000 different user-agents,\naround 500 of which only appear in this\noperation\nMore than 300 different appIDs from various publishers\nAt least 2 million spoofed IP addresses from 30+ countries, where over 99% of those\naddresses are located in the United States\nAbout 1,700 SSAI server IPs located in 9 countries generating the traffic\n\nIn order to fully understand the magnitude of the ICEBUCKET operation, it’s important to have a\nsense of how SSAI works, the role it plays in programmatic advertising on CTV platforms, why\nSSAI spoofing is so difficult to detect, and what makes SSAI spoofing such an attractive target for\nfraudsters.\n\n## What is server-side ad insertion (SSAI)?\n\nServer-side ad insertion, or SSAI, was developed by publishers to create a better end-user ad\nexperience. Ads are “stitched” into the fabric of video content so that there aren’t delays or\nhiccups caused by launching an ad player. SSAI is commonly used for advertising on several\n“edge” device types, such as CTVs, smart phones, gaming consoles, and others. Delivering video\nad content through SSAI offers advertisers many benefits, including user personalization and\nlatency reduction.\n\n_Figure 2: Schematic of how SSAI spoofing relates to the ad tech ecosystem_\n\nWhile SSAI is an elegant solution to ad serving, it’s still in its infancy. As with all new technologies,\nWhite Ops can see fraudsters finding the holes in the system and wiggling their way through.\nFraudsters have found a way to spoof edge devices to replicate SSAI services.\n\n\n-----\n\nSSAI spoofing, the key fraud technique that ICEBUCKET’s operators used, occurs when\nfraudsters send out a bunch of ad requests from data centers for “spoofed” or faked edge\ndevices. The data center source is expected for real SSAI providers. Rather than show the ads to\nhumans, the fraudsters call the reporting APIs indicating the ad has been “shown”. Often, the\ninformation available to advertisers in an SSAI environment is limited to the device user-agent\nand IP address. This information may be sent in the “X-Device-User-Agent” and “X-Device-IP”\nHTTP headers, as per the [IAB VAST guidelines, or through other similar headers. While falsifying](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/vast/)\nthis data is relatively simple, the nuance of doing so convincingly makes this a form of a\nsophisticated bot attack.\n\nAdvertisers pay for their ads to be viewed by a human audience that are open to their products or\nservices. Instead, these fraudsters take the advertisers’ money and pocket it; the ads that are\n“served” either never see the light of day or are never viewed by a human. An audience of\nsophisticated bots is really just an empty audience.\n\n## The ICEBUCKET Operation\n\nThe ICEBUCKET operation presented its traffic as coming from a legitimate SSAI provider (based\non the inclusion of standard HTTP headers) for a variety of devices and apps, using custom code.\nICEBUCKET assembled requests for ads to be inserted into video content for viewers using CTV\nand mobile devices, but none of those devices or viewers actually exist. The user-agents used in\nthe operation largely refer to obsolete device types that are no longer used in the general\npopulation, or devices that never existed in the first place. The IP addresses showed signs of\nbeing algorithmically generated to mimic desirable audiences.\n\nThese ad requests originated from a small set of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).\nAutonomous Systems make up the back-end routing infrastructure of the internet, in the same\nway that roads connect traffic between different cities. Each system is identified with a number,\nthe ASN, similar in function to a postal code. While we can’t know for sure the threat actor’s\nmotivation for using these ASNs in the operation, we can make a few comments on possible\nreasons. The ASNs have:\n\nWeak enforcement from network operators regarding malicious activity conducted from\ntheir data center\nCheap Virtual Private Server (VPS) services available\nA large number of hosts within that IP space that are vulnerable or otherwise left open for\nexploitation\n\nIt is likely the actor behind ICEBUCKET operated from these ASNs due to their confidence that\ntheir behavior would not be caught. Not all traffic from these ASNs are part of the ICEBUCKET\noperation, as there is non-ICEBUCKET traffic from these ASNs as well.\n\nThe ICEBUCKET operation is unique in that a subset of the traffic is being generated to benefit\napp publishers directly through direct deals. We've observed cases where such publishers are\nmixing up organic and ICEBUCKET traffic in what seems to be early signs of traffic sourcing\nschemes for CTV traffic. From our observation of this “mixed up” traffic, we have two hypothesis\nas to why this would occur:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hiding the operation: By creating a subset of traffic that is not benefiting the operation**\ndirectly, the fraudsters have created noise around identifying the operation. The spoofed\napps are then unwitting beneficiaries to the generated traffic.\n**Fraud-as-a-service: The operation is generating traffic on behalf of the app publishers.**\nThe subset of fraudulent activity becomes harder to detect, and the operation has an extra\nrevenue source for the scheme.\n\nAt this point, we cannot make a conclusive determination between these two possibilities. There\nis the possibility that both of these options could be at play, depending on the particular subset of\nthe traffic in question.\n\n## Freezing Fraudsters Out\n\nThe White Ops Bot Mitigation Platform allows us to protect our partners by stopping sophisticated\nbots once we’ve accurately identified the signatures of the particular threat. By monitoring for\nthose threat signatures in our pre-bid traffic, we can automatically block fraudulent traffic and\nensure money does not go into the pockets of the fraudsters. The platform also allows us to\nhighlight those portions of the ad-tech ecosystem where this operation is flourishing, so our\npartners can take actions into their own hands.\n\nSpoofing of any kind is designed to make the spoofed entity resemble the victim (a consumer, an\nadvertiser, an app developer - the target depends on the operation). Using several fraud markers,\nwe can distinguish between the real, human traffic and the traffic from these spoofed devices.\nWhite Ops is careful not to negatively impact apps that are victims in fraud schemes just because\nfraudsters are taking advantage of their appIDs. We work to cut the flow of money to the actual\n_fraudsters, not the organizations they target._\n\n14,000,000\n\n12,000,000\n\n10,000,000\n\n8,000,000\n\n6,000,000\n\n4,000,000\n\n2,000,000\n\n0\n\nJan 05, 2020 Jan 19, 2020 Feb 02, 2020 Feb 16, 2020 Mar 01, 2020 Mar 15, 2020 Mar 29, 2020\n**Date**\n\n_Figure 3: post-bid impressions associated with ICEBUCKET for 2020._\n\nAs noted above, ICEBUCKET is an ongoing operation. The volumes shown in Figure 3 have not\ngone down to zero. The fraudsters are still out there, but we are able to execute our bot mitigation\nand bot prevention techniques to detect them and protect against their attacks; we’re disclosing\nthis discovery now so others can do the same. We have already rolled out defenses against\n\n\n-----\n\nsimilar operations, and have expanded our collective protection coverage further into the\n“purported SSAI” subset of our observed traffic. Our detection and bot prevention techniques are\ncontinually evolving to counter emergent threats, as well as to anticipate new ones.\n\n## Stopping the Ice Storm\n\nSince CTV and SSAI spoofing are currently lucrative options for our adversaries due to the high\nCPMs on CTV consumers, we expect to see similar operations start, or that existing operations\nmay shift from web and mobile toward CTV traffic.\n\nThere are a couple things our peers in the industry can do to try to mitigate SSAI spoofing:\n\nEnsure you work with a collectively protected advertising supply chain where there are\ndirect relationships, trust, and full transparency\nConsistent appID/bundleID declarations to provide stronger links from app to publisher,\nsuch as the [IAB app identification guidelines](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/OTT_Store_Assigned_App_Identification_Guidelines_IABTechLab_2019-12.pdf)\nConsult frequently with your ad tech partners throughout the ecosystem to ensure that this\nnew threat model is well understood by everybody in your orbit.\nDevelop more standards that will increase transparency for CTV inventory such as:\n\nExpand the [app-ads.txt standard to fully support CTV traffic](https://www.whiteops.com/blog/why-app-ads-txt-matters)\nFully adopt [sellers.json to support visibility into the entire supply chain](https://iabtechlab.com/sellers-json/)\nDevice manufacturers and SSAI providers should support the development and\nadoption of standards that verify the authenticity of a device (e.g. via\ncryptographically signing their requests). This would be a great step forward at\ncombating device impersonation.\n\nWe’ve seen actions like this have a ripple effect. When the scheme becomes less profitable, then\nwe have done our job: by cutting into the revenue streams of bad actors, we push them out of the\necosystem. [White Ops’ Advertising Integrity offering protects advertisers from falling victim to the](https://www.whiteops.com/products/advertising-integrity)\nmost sophisticated bot attacks on the internet.\n\nEducation on SSAI spoofing is just the beginning - teams need to start monitoring for this\nbehavior. The programmatic advertising ecosystem needs industry standards in order to “ice” out\nthese fraudsters once and for all.\n\n## Appendix\n\nSubset of ASNs identified as the traffic sources for this operation:\n\nNot all traffic from these ASNs are part of the ICEBUCKET operation, as there is nonICEBUCKET traffic from these ASNs as well.\n\n**User-agents present:** **[icebucket-uas.txt](https://www.whiteops.com/hubfs/icebucket_uas.txt)**\n\nNot all of the included user-agents are unique to the ICEBUCKET operation. Since the operation\nis trying to look like legitimate traffic, there are some devices represented here that will be seen\noutside of this operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recent Satori Research and Investigations:\n\n15 days\nago\n\n### The impact of social distancing on digital advertising\n\n[Read Article](https://www.whiteops.com/blog/the-impact-of-social-distancing-on-digital-advertising)\n\n\n-----\n\n2 months\nago\n\n### Doppelganger's Delight: How One Person is Exploiting Your WiFi Router\n\n[Read Article](https://www.whiteops.com/blog/doppelgangers-delight-how-one-person-is-exploiting-your-wifi-router)\n2 months\nago\n\n### The Cybercrime Starter Kit: Inside Anti-Detection Browsers and Account Takeovers\n\n[Read Article](https://resources.whiteops.com/research-and-investigations/the-cybercrime-starter-kit-inside-anti-detection-browsers)\n\n**[Read more Satori investigations.](https://resources.whiteops.com/research-and-investigations)**\n\n\n-----",
