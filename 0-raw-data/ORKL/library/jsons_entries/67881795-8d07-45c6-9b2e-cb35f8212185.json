Unbeknownst to shoppers, criminals are harvesting their personal information,\nincluding payment details in the online equivalent of ATM card skimming.\n\nMost often the skimming code—written in JavaScript and obfuscated—is hosted on\ninfrastructure controlled by attackers. Over time, they have created thousands of domain\nnames mimicking Magento, the CMS platform that is by far most targeted.\n\nHowever, as we sometimes see in [other types of compromises, threat actors can also abuse](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/12/malicious-cryptominers-from-github.html)\n[the resources of legitimate providers, such as code repository GitHub, acquired by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/)\nlast year.\n\nThis latest skimmer is a hex-encoded piece of JavaScript code that was uploaded to GitHub\n[on April 20 by user momo33333, who, as it happens, had just joined the platform on that day](https://github.com/momo33333)\nas well.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the above and below screenshots, you can see that the threat actor was fine tuning the\nskimmer, after having done a few tests:\n\n\n-----\n\nJust like with any other kind of third-party plugins, compromised Magento sites are loading\nthis script within their source code, right after the CDATA script and/or right before the\n</html> tag:\n\nAccording to a [search on urlscan.io, there are currently over 200 sites that have been](https://urlscan.io/search/#%22raw.githubusercontent.com%5C%2Fmomo33333%5C%2Fmage%5C%2Fmaster%22)\ninjected with this skimmer:\n\nA look at the deobfuscated script reveals the exfiltration domain (jquerylol[.]ru) where the\nstolen data will be sent to:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt’s worth noting that the compromised Magento sites will remain at risk, even if the GitHubhosted skimmer is taken down. Indeed, attackers can easily re-infect them in the same\nmanner they initially injected the first one.\n\nIt is critical for e-commerce site owners to keep their CMS and its plugins up-to-date, as well\nas using secure authentication methods. Over the past year, we have identified thousands of\nsites that are hacked and posing a risk for online shoppers.\n\nWe reported the fraudulent GitHub account which was quickly taken down. We are also\nprotecting our users by blocking the exfiltration domain.\n\n\n-----",
