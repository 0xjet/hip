Our\nresearch into the group found that it’s been attacking a broad range of industries—including aviation,\nbroadcasting, and finance—to drop back door Trojans.\n\nSymantec Security Response has been actively monitoring Patchwork, also known as Dropping Elephant,\nwhich uses Chinese-themed content as bait to compromise its targets’ networks. Two security companies,\nCymmetria and Kaspersky, each recently released reports on the campaign, most of which are in line with\nour observations.\n\nPatchwork group widens scope to include broad range of industries in multiple regions\n\n**Targets**\nAs other researchers observed, Patchwork originally targeted governments and government-related\norganizations. However, the group has since expanded its focus to include a broader range of industries.\n\nWhile most of the interest still lies in the public sector, more recent attacks were found targeting the following\nindustries:\n\nAviation\nBroadcasting\nEnergy\nFinancial\nNon-governmental organizations (NGO)\nPharmaceutical\nPublic sector\nPublishing\nSoftware\n\nAccording to Symantec telemetry, targeted organizations are located in dispersed regions. Although\napproximately half of the attacks focus on the US, other targeted regions include China, Japan, Southeast\nAsia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAviation, NGOs, energy, financial, among industries targeted by Patchwork cyberespionage group\n\n|Joji Hamada|Symantec Employee|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nOur first observation of an attempted attack related to this campaign dates back to November 2015,\nalthough Symantec telemetry data indicates that the campaign may have already existed in early 2015 or\nperhaps even earlier.\n\nThe threat actor mainly relies on a legitimate mailing list provider to send newsletters to a select number of\ntargets. The newsletter includes a link to the attacker’s website, which has content focusing on topics related\nto China to draw the target’s interest. These websites are hosted on the same domains as the mailing list\nprovider. Each website is customized for the intended target, and contains specialized topics related to the\ntargeted industries.\n\n_Figure 1. A customized website with content related to a Chinese public hospital_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. A customized website with content related to the Chinese military_\n\nThe malicious sites link to files hosted on different domains, which appear to be solely used for malicious\npurposes. The domains are registered under names that pose as legitimate sources for Chinese\nintelligence. Several domains predominantly used in the attacks are hosted on two servers with the IP\naddresses 212.83.146.3 and 37.58.60.195.\n\nThese websites host two different types of malicious files: a PowerPoint file (.pps) and a rich text file with a\nWord .doc extension.\n\nThe PowerPoint files appear to exploit the Microsoft Windows OLE Package Manager Remote Code\n[Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114), which was used in the Sandworm attacks against American and](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/sandworm-windows-zero-day-vulnerability-being-actively-exploited-targeted-attacks)\nEuropean targets in October 2014. The rich text files typically attempt to exploit the Microsoft Office Memory\nCorruption Vulnerability (CVE-2015-1641), which was patched in April 2015. We have also confirmed an\nolder flaw being exploited, the Microsoft Windows Common Controls ActiveX Control Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).\n\nFrom what we can confirm, the documents contain copies of publicly available content taken from legitimate\nwebsites. Topics range from military/defense, hospital, naval disputes, and even malware removal.\n\n**Malicious PowerPoint files**\nThe .pps files likely exploit the Microsoft Windows OLE Package Manager Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability (CVE-2014-4114). However, the exploit for this particular campaign is a slight variation of\nsimilar exploits observed in the past. The exploit takes advantage of how the patch is designed to only warn\nusers, rather than completely prevent malware infections without user interaction.\n\nNothing happens when the file is opened on PowerPoint 2016. However, when the file is opened on older\nversions of PowerPoint, it displays a security warning asking whether the user wants to open driver.inf\ndepending on the environment, such as the version of the operating system and the patch applied.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Opening the .pps file on PowerPoint versions earlier than 2016 displays this prompt_\n\nIf the user chooses to open the file, the computer will be compromised. If the user chooses not to open it, the\n[computer will not be infected. However, Backdoor.Enfourks will be dropped, though not executed, into the](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-053106-2208-99)\ntemporary directory when the .pps file is opened. This poses a risk of compromise to the intended target.\n\nWe have confirmed this issue on all versions of PowerPoint tested in the lab. Users should manually remove\nany potential dropped files which would typically be named “sysvolinfo.exe”.\n\n**Malicious Word .doc file**\nBesides the .pps file, the threat actor uses rich text files to deliver the malware. While other researchers have\nreported that these files exploit CVE-2012-0158, Symantec has also observed CVE-2015-1641 being\n[exploited to drop Backdoor.Steladok.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-060613-0635-99)\n\n**Main payloads**\nBoth the .doc and .pps files mainly drop two malware families. Typically, the PowerPoint Slide file drops\nBackdoor.Enfourks, an AutoIT executable which is usually bloated with meaningless data and targets mainly\n32-bit systems. The .doc file drops Backdoor.Steladok.\n\nWhile both back door Trojans wait for commands from the threat actor, they can search for files and upload\nthem to the specified server once activated. For unknown reasons, both threats use Baidu, the Chinese\nsoftware vendor, in their routines. The Trojans confirm an internet connection by pinging Baidu’s server and\ncreate a registry entry with the vendor’s name to run every time Windows starts. As two file types are used\nto deliver two different payloads, there are likely multiple individuals or groups contributing to the malware\ndevelopment efforts.\n\n**Mitigation**\nUsers should adhere to the following advice to prevent Patchwork’s attacks from succeeding:\n\nDelete any suspicious-looking emails you receive, especially if they contain links or attachments.\nSpear-phishing emails are frequently used by cyberespionage attackers as a means of luring victims\ninto opening malicious files.\nKeep your operating system and other software updated. Software updates will frequently include\npatches for newly discovered security vulnerabilities which are frequently exploited by attackers.\nKeep your security software up to date to protect yourself against any new variants of this malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec and Norton products detect Patchwork s malware as follows:\n\n**Antivirus:**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system:**\n\n[System Infected: Backdoor.Steladok Activity](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=29400)\n[System Infected: Backdoor.Enfourks Activity](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=29380)\n\n**Indicators of compromise**\nThe following details suspicious domains, IP addresses, and files, which may indicate that Patchwork has\ncompromised a computer:\n\n**Suspected domains and IP addresses:**\n\nchinastrats.com\nepg-cn.com\nextremebolt.com\ninfo81.com\nlujunxinxi.com\nmilitaryworkerscn.com\nmilresearchcn.com\nmodgovcn.com\nnewsnstat.com\nnudtcn.com\nsocialfreakzz.com\n81-cn.net\ncnmilit.com\nnduformation.com\nexpatchina.info\ninfo81.com\nclimaxcn.com\nexpatchina.info\nmiltechcn.com\nmiltechweb.com\nsecurematrixx.com\n46.166.163.242\n212.129.13.110\n\n**Detection name** **MD5** **File name**\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 0bbff4654d0c4551c58376e6a99dfda0\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 1de10c5bc704d3eaf4f0cfa5ddd63f2d MilitaryReforms2.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 2ba26a9cc1af4479e99dcc6a0e7d5d67 2016_China_Military_PowerReport.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 375f240df2718fc3e0137e109eef57ee PLA_UAV_DEPLOYMENT.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 38e71afcdd6236ac3ad24bda393a81c6 militarizationofsouthchinasea_1.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 3e9d1526addf2ca6b09e2fdb5fd4978f How_to_easily_clean_an_infected_computer.pps\n\nT j PPD 475 29 d9373 2 04b7 3df6766761 b PLA F th i R l ti i D t i l Aff i\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 4dbb8ad1776af25a5832e92b12d4bfff maritime_dispute.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 4dbb8ad1776af25a5832e92b12d4bfff Clingendael_Report_South_China_Sea.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 543d402a56406c93b68622a7e392728d 2016_China_Military_PowerReport.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 551e244aa85b92fe470ed2eac9d8808a Assessing_PLA_Organisational_Reforms.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 6877e60f141793287169125a08e36941 Clingendael_Report_South_China_Sea.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 6d8534597ae05d2151d848d2e6427f9e cn-lshc-hospital-operations-excellence.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 74fea3e542add0f301756581d1f16126 Clingendael_Report_South_China_Sea_20160517Downloaded.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 812a856288a03787d85d2cb9c1e1b3ba\n\nTrojan.PPDropper 8f7b1f320823893e159f6ebfb8ce3e78\n\nTrojan.PPDropper b163e3906b3521a407910aeefd055f03 china_security_report_2016.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper d456bbf44d73b1f0f2d1119f16993e93\n\nTrojan.PPDropper e7b4511cba3bba6983c43c9f9014a49d Chinastrats.com netflix2.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper ebfa776a91de20674a4ae55294d85087 Chinese_Influence_Faces_2.pps\n\nTrojan.PPDropper eefcef704b1a7bea6e92dc8711cfd35e Top_Five_AF.pps\n\n_Table 1.
