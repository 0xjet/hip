The certificate looks to be a public SSL cert\nfrom Naver, a Korean search engine and service provider.\n\n\n-----\n\n## McAfee: Oops, our bad. Sharpshooter malware was the Norks Lazarus Group the whole time\n\n[READ MORE](https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/04/sharpshooter_malware_campaign_lazarus_group_mcafee/)\nWithin the bundle of files, US-Cert says, the malware package is able to perform a number of\nremote control and spyware activities. This includes the ability to read and write local files,\ncreate, terminate, or modify running processes and registry settings, and connect to a\nremote host to upload and download files.\n\nThe Lazarus Group is something of an oddity in the world of government-backed hacking\ngroups. Unlike other state-sponsored operations, the primary focus of the group has not\n[been espionage or intellectual property theft, but rather financial crime aimed at helping the](https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/11/chile_bank_wiper_prelude_cyberheaist/)\nisolated nation get cash into its coffers.\n\n[Lazarus/Hidden Cobra was also famously credited with pulling off the high-profile 2014](https://www.theregister.com/2018/04/30/thaicert_seizes_machine_from_university/)\nattack on Sony Pictures.\n\nThe group has typically used spear-phishing techniques to get its malware onto foreign\nforeign targets, and US-Cert recommends admins and users take basic security measures\n(such as patching systems regularly and maintaining up-to-date malware protections) in\norder to safeguard from attacks. ®\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\nExperts: AI should be recognized as inventors in patent law\n\nPlus: Police release deepfake of murdered teen in cold case, and more\n\n[Katyanna Quach Sat 28 May 2022 // 11:23 UTC 13](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nIn-brief Governments around the world should pass intellectual property laws that grant\nrights to AI systems, two academics at the University of New South Wales in Australia\nargued.\n\nAlexandra George, and Toby Walsh, professors of law and AI, respectively, believe\nfailing to recognize machines as inventors could have long-lasting impacts on\neconomies and societies.\n\n\"If courts and governments decide that AI-made inventions cannot be patented, the\n[implications could be huge,\" they wrote in a comment article published in Nature.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01391-x)\n\"Funders and businesses would be less incentivized to pursue useful research using AI\ninventors when a return on their investment could be limited.
