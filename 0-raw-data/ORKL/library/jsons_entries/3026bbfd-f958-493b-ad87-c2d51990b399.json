This threat group has been [reported on](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-us-phishing-tensions/) [consistently for years, but our recent findings show that](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/09/20/iran-hacker-crew-apt33-heading-for-destructive-cyberattacks/)\nthe group has been using about a dozen live Command and Control (C&C) servers for extremely narrow\ntargeting. The group puts up multiple layers of obfuscation to run these C&C servers in extremely targeted\nmalware campaigns against organizations in the Middle East, the U.S., and Asia.\n\nWe believe these botnets, each comprising a small group of up to a dozen infected computers, are used to\ngain persistence within the networks of select targets. The malware is rather basic, and has limited\ncapabilities that include downloading and running additional malware. Among active infections in 2019 are\ntwo separate locations of a private American company that offers services related to national security, victims\nconnecting from a university and a college in the U.S., a victim most likely related to the U.S. military, and\nseveral victims in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nAPT33 has also been executing more aggressive attacks over the past few years. For example, for at least two\nyears the group used the private website of a high-ranking European politician (a member of her country’s\ndefense committee) to send spear phishing emails to companies that are part of the supply chain of oil\nproducts. Targets included a water facility that is used by the U.S. army for the potable water supply of one of\nits military bases.\n\nThese attacks have likely resulted in concrete infections in the oil industry. For example, in the fall of 2018,\nwe observed communications between a U.K.-based oil company with computer servers in the U.K. and\nIndia and an APT33 C&C server. Another European oil company suffered from an APT33 related malware\ninfection on one of their servers in India for at least 3 weeks in November and December 2018. There were\nseveral other companies in oil supply chains that had been compromised in the fall of 2018 as well. These\ncompromises indicate a big risk to companies in the oil industry, as APT33 is known to use destructive\nmalware\n\n\n-----\n\n12/31/16 recruitment@alsalam.aero Job Opportunity\n4/17/17 recruitment@alsalam.aero Vacancy Announcement\n7/17/17 careers@ngaaksa.com Job Openning\n9/11/17 jobs@ngaaksa.ga Job Opportunity\n11/20/17 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning\n11/28/17 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning\n3/5/18 jobs@mail.dyn-corp.ga Job Openning\n7/2/18 careers@sipchem.ga Job Opportunity SIPCHEM\n7/30/18 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning\n8/14/18 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning\n8/26/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy\n8/28/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy\n9/25/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga AramCo Jobs\n10/22/18 jobs@samref.ga Job Openning at SAMREF\n\nTable 1. Spear phishing campaigns of APT33. Source: Trend Micro’s Smart Protection Network\n\nThe first two email addresses in the table above (ending in .com and .aero) are being spoofed by the threat\ngroup. However, the addresses ending in .ga are from the attacker’s own infrastructure. The addresses are all\nimpersonating known aviation and oil and gas companies.\n\nAside from the relatively noisy attacks of APT33 against oil product supply chains, we found that APT33 has\nbeen using several C&C domains for small botnets comprised of about a dozen bots each.\n\nIt appears that APT33 took special care to make tracking more difficult. The C&C domains are usually hosted\non cloud hosted proxies. These proxies relay URL requests from the infected bots to backends at shared\nwebservers that may host thousands of legitimate domains. The backends report bot data back to a data\naggregator and bot control server that is on a dedicated IP address. The APT33 actors connect to these\naggregators via a private VPN network with exit nodes that are changed frequently. The APT33 actors then\nissue commands to the bots and collect data from the bots using these VPN connections.\n\nIn fall of 2019 we counted 10 live bot data aggregating and bot controlling servers and tracked a couple of\nthem for months. These aggregators get data from very few C&C servers (only 1 or 2), with only up to a\ndozen victims per unique C&C domain. The table below lists some of the older C&C domains that are still\nlive today.\n\n**Domain** **Created**\n\nsuncocity.com 5/31/16\n\nzandelshop.com 6/1/16\n\nsimsoshop.com 6/2/16\n\nzeverco.com 6/5/16\n\nqualitweb.com 6/6/16\n\nservice-explorer.com 3/3/17\n\nservice-norton.com 3/6/17\n\nservice-eset.com 3/6/17\n\nservice-essential.com 3/7/17\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Schema showing the multiple obfuscation layers that APT33 uses\n\nThreat actors often use commercial VPN services to hide their whereabouts when administering C&C servers\nand doing reconnaissance. But besides using VPN services that are available for any user, we also regularly\nsee actors using private VPN networks that they set up for themselves.\n\nSetting up a private VPN can be easily done by renting a couple of servers from datacenters around the world\nand using open source software like OpenVPN. Though the connections from private VPN networks still\ncome from seemingly unrelated IP addresses around the world, this kind of traffic is actually easier to track.\nOnce we know that an exit node is mainly being used by a particular actor, we can have a high degree of\nconfidence about the attribution of the connections that are made from the IP addresses of the exit node. For\nexample, besides administering C&C servers from a private VPN exit node, an actor might also be doing\nreconnaissance of targets’ networks.\n\nAPT33 likely uses its VPN exit nodes exclusively. We have been tracking some of the group’s private VPN\nexit nodes for more than a year and we have listed known associated IP addresses in the table below. The\nindicated timeframes are conservative; it is likely that the IP addresses have been used for a longer time.\n\n**IP address** **First seen** **Last seen**\n5.135.120.57 12/4/18 1/24/19\n5.135.199.25 3/3/19 3/3/19\n31.7.62.48 9/26/18 9/29/18\n51.77.11.46 7/1/19 7/2/19\n54.36.73.108 7/22/19 10/05/19\n54.37.48.172 10/22/19 11/05/19\n54.38.124.150 10/28/18 11/17/18\n88.150.221.107 9/26/19 11/07/19\n91.134.203.59 9/26/18 12/4/18\n109.169.89.103 12/2/18 12/14/18\n\n\n-----\n\n137.74.157.84 12/18/18 10/21/19\n185.122.56.232 9/29/18 11/4/18\n185.125.204.57 10/25/18 1/14/19\n185.175.138.173 1/19/19 1/22/19\n188.165.119.138 10/8/18 11/19/18\n193.70.71.112 3/7/19 3/17/19\n195.154.41.72 1/13/19 1/20/19\n213.32.113.159 6/30/19 9/16/19\n216.244.93.137 12/10/18 12/21/18\n\nTable 3. IP addresses associated with a few private VPN exit nodes connected to APT33\n\nIt appears that these private VPN exit nodes are also used for reconnaissance of networks that are relevant to\nthe supply chain of the oil industry. More concretely, we have witnessed some of the IP addresses in Table 3\ndoing reconnaissance on the network of an oil exploration company and military hospitals in the Middle East,\nas well as an oil company in the U.S..\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. APT33’s usage of a private VPN network\n\nAPT33 used its private VPN network to access websites of penetration testing companies, webmail, websites\non vulnerabilities, and websites related to cryptocurrencies, as well as to read hacker blogs and forums.\nAPT33 also has a clear interest in websites that specialize in the recruitment of employees in the oil and gas\nindustry. We recommend companies in the oil and gas industry to cross-relate their security log files with the\nIP addresses listed above.\n\n**Security recommendations**\n\n[The continued modernization of facilities for oil, gas, water, and power is making it](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/internet-of-things/securing-the-industrial-internet-of-things-protecting-energy-water-and-oil-infrastructures) more difficult to secure\nthem. Outright attacks, readily exploitable vulnerabilities, as well as exposed SCADA/HMI are serious\nissues. Here are some of the best practices that these organizations can adopt:\n\nEstablish a regular patching and update policy for all systems. Download patches as soon as possible to\nprevent cybercriminals from exploiting these security flaws.\nImprove employee awareness on the latest attack techniques that cybercriminals use.\n\n\n-----\n\noutbound traffic easier.\nInstall a [multilayered protection system that can detect and block malicious intrusions from the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/all-solutions.html)\ngateway to the endpoint.\n\nSecuring supply chains to these complex and often multinational systems is also difficult, as they usually\nhave necessary third-party suppliers that are embedded in their core operations. These parties may be\noverlooked in terms of security, and vulnerabilities in the communication or connections with them are often\n[targeted by cybercriminals.
