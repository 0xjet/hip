The police added that\nthe server receiving the data from the latest infections has been shut down.\n\nThe prizes were handed out from December 11 to December 12, when complaints from the\npublic started arriving, but 34 of the drives are still in circulation somewhere. ®\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n\n-----\n\nStolen university credentials up for sale by Russian crooks, FBI warns\n\nForget dark-web souks, thousands of these are already being traded on public bazaars\n\n[Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 22:34 UTC](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Jessica-Lyons-Hardcastle)\nRussian crooks are selling network credentials and virtual private network access for a\n\"multitude\" of US universities and colleges on criminal marketplaces, according to the\nFBI.\n\nAccording to a warning issued on Thursday, these stolen credentials sell for thousands\nof dollars on both dark web and public internet forums, and could lead to subsequent\ncyberattacks against individual employees or the schools themselves.\n\n\"The exposure of usernames and passwords can lead to brute force credential stuffing\ncomputer network attacks, whereby attackers attempt logins across various internet\nsites or exploit them for subsequent cyber attacks as criminal actors take advantage of\nusers recycling the same credentials across multiple accounts, internet sites, and\n[services,\" the Feds' alert [PDF] said.](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220526.pdf)\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2022/05/27/fbi_warning_stolen_university_credentials/?td=keepreading-btm)\nBig Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation\n\nStudy claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules\n\n[Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Thomas-Claburn)\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public\nstatements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common\norganizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.\n\n[That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time)\ncorporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown\nstate privacy bills.\n\nThe report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy\nlegislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,\nApple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the\nState Privacy and Security Coalition.\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2022/05/27/big_tech_privacy/?td=keepreading-btm)\n\n\n-----\n\nSEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake\n\nMeanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors\n\n[Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nAmerica's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed\nhis purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media\ncompany hangs in the balance.\n\n[A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he \"[did] not appear\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000000000022003713/filename1.pdf)\n[to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter \"required 10 days](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/04/elon_musk_twitter/)\nfrom the date of acquisition,\" and asked him to provide more information.
