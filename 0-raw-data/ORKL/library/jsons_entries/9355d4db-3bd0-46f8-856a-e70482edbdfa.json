In the UK, the attack particularly\naffected the NHS, although it was not the specific target. At 4 pm on 12 May, NHS England\ndeclared the cyber attack a major incident and implemented its emergency arrangements\nto maintain health and patient care. On the evening of 12 May a cyber‑security researcher\nactivated a kill-switch so that WannaCry stopped locking devices.\n\n2 According to NHS England, the WannaCry ransomware affected at least 81 out of\nthe 236 trusts across England, because they were either infected by the ransomware or\nturned off their devices or systems as a precaution. A further 603 primary care and other\nNHS organisations were also infected, including 595 GP practices.\n\n3 Before the WannaCry attack the Department of Health (the Department) and its\narm’s-length bodies had work under way to strengthen cyber-security in the NHS. For\nexample, NHS Digital was broadcasting alerts about cyber threats, providing a hotline\nfor dealing with incidents, sharing best practice and carrying out on-site assessments to\nhelp protect against future cyber attacks; and NHS England had embedded the 10 Data\nSecurity Standards (recommended by the National Data Guardian) in the standard NHS\ncontract for 2017-18 and was providing training to its Board and local teams to raise\nawareness of cyber threats. In light of the WannaCry attack, the Department announced\nfurther plans to strengthen NHS organisations’ cyber-security.\n\n4 Our investigation focuses on events immediately before 12 May 2017 and up\nuntil 30 September 2017. We only cover the effect the WannaCry attack had on the\nNHS in England. We do not cover how the WannaCry attack affected other countries\nor organisations outside the NHS. A cyber attack on either the health or social care\nsectors could cause disruption across the whole health and social care sector. For\nexample, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) told us that, as some trusts were unable\nto communicate with social services, there could have been delays in the discharge\nof patients from hospital to social care, although the CQC relayed advice from NHS\nDigital and NHS England to social care providers to help manage any disruption.\nThis investigation sets out the facts about:\n\n###### • the ransomware attack’s impact on the NHS and its patients;\n\n • why some parts of the NHS were affected; and\n\n • how the Department and NHS national bodies responded to the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Summary\n\n1 The WannaCry attack affected NHS services in the week from 12 May to\n19 May 2017. The Department of Health (the Department) and NHS England worked with\nNHS Digital, NHS Improvement, the National Cyber Security Centre, the National Crime\nAgency and others to respond to the attack.\n\n###### Key findings\n\n The risk of a cyber attack affecting the NHS\n\n2 WannaCry was the largest cyber attack to affect the NHS, although individual\ntrusts had been attacked before 12 May 2017. For example, two of the trusts infected\nby WannaCry had been infected by previous cyber attacks. One of England’s biggest\ntrusts, Barts Health NHS Trust, had been infected before, and Northern Lincolnshire and\nGoole NHS Foundation Trust had been subject to a ransomware attack in October 2016,\nleading to the cancellation of 2,800 appointments (paragraph 3.7 and Figure 5).\n\n3 The Department was warned about the risks of cyber attacks on the\nNHS a year before WannaCry and although it had work under way it did not\nformally respond with a written report until July 2017. The Secretary of State for\nHealth asked the National Data Guardian and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to\nundertake reviews of data security. These reports were published in July 2016 and\nwarned the Department that cyber attacks could lead to patient information being\nlost or compromised and jeopardise access to critical patient record systems. They\nrecommended that all health and care organisations needed to provide evidence that\nthey were taking action to improve cyber-security, including moving off old operating\nsystems. Although the Department and its arm’s-length bodies had work under way to\nimprove cyber-security in the NHS, the Department did not publish its formal response\nto the recommendations until July 2017 (paragraphs 3.6 and 3.11).\n\n\n-----\n\n4 The Department and its arm’s-length bodies did not know whether local NHS\norganisations were prepared for a cyber attack. Local healthcare organisations such\nas trusts and clinical commissioning groups are responsible for keeping the information\nthey hold secure, and for having arrangements in place to respond to an incident or\nemergency, including a cyber attack. Local healthcare bodies are overseen by the\nDepartment and its arm’s-length bodies. The Department and Cabinet Office wrote to\ntrusts in 2014, saying it was essential they had “robust plans” to migrate away from old\nsoftware, such as Windows XP, by April 2015. In March and April 2017, NHS Digital had\nissued critical alerts warning organisations to patch their systems to prevent WannaCry.\nHowever, before 12 May 2017, the Department had no formal mechanism for assessing\nwhether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance. Prior to the\nattack, NHS Digital had conducted an on-site cyber-security assessment for 88 out of\n236 trusts, and none had passed. However, NHS Digital cannot mandate a local body\nto take remedial action even if it has concerns about the vulnerability of an organisation\n(paragraphs 2.5, 2.7, 2.10 to 2.12 and 3.2, and Figure 4).\n\n###### How the WannaCry attack affected the NHS\n\n5 The attack led to disruption in at least 34% of trusts in England although\nthe Department and NHS England do not know the full extent of the disruption\n(Figure 1). On 12 May, NHS England initially identified 45 NHS organisations including\n37 trusts that had been infected by the WannaCry ransomware. Over the following days,\nmore organisations reported they had been affected. In total, at least 81 out of 236\ntrusts across England were affected. The trusts included:\n\n###### • 37 infected and locked out of devices (of which, 27 were acute trusts); and\n\n • 44 not infected but reporting disruption. For example, these trusts shut down their\nemail and other systems as a precaution and on their own initiative, as they had not\nreceived central advice early enough on 12 May to inform their decisions on what\nto do. This meant, for example, that they had to use pen and paper for activities\nusually performed electronically.\n\nNHS England and NHS Digital identified a further 21 trusts that were attempting to\ncontact the WannaCry domain, but were not locked out of their devices. There are two\npossible reasons for this. Trusts may have become infected after the kill-switch had been\nactivated, and were therefore not locked out of their devices. Alternatively, they may have\ncontacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.\n\nA further 603 primary care and other NHS organisations were infected by WannaCry,\nincluding 595 GP practices. However, the Department does not know how many NHS\norganisations could not access records or receive information, because they shared\ndata or systems with an infected trust. NHS Digital told us that it believes no patient data\nwere compromised or stolen (paragraphs 1.2 to 1.5 and 1.9, and Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n6 Thousands of appointments and operations were cancelled and in five\nareas patients had to travel further to accident and emergency departments.\nBetween 12 May and 18 May, NHS England collected some information on cancelled\nappointments, to help it manage the incident, but this did not include all types of\nappointment. NHS England identified 6,912 appointments had been cancelled, and\nestimated more than 19,000 appointments would have been cancelled in total, based\non the normal rate of follow‑up appointments to first appointments. NHS England told\nus it does not plan to identify the actual number because it is focusing its efforts on\nresponding appropriately to the lessons learned from WannaCry. As data were not\ncollected during the incident, neither the Department nor NHS England know how many\nGP appointments were cancelled, or how many ambulances and patients were diverted\nfrom the five accident and emergency departments that were unable to treat some\npatients (paragraphs 1.7, 1.8 and 1.10, and Figure 1).\n\n7 The Department, NHS England and the National Crime Agency told us that\nno NHS organisation paid the ransom, but the Department does not know how\nmuch the disruption to services cost the NHS. The Department, NHS England and\nthe National Crime Agency told us no NHS organisation paid the ransom. NHS Digital\ntold us it advised the trusts it spoke to not to pay the ransom, and wrote to all trusts on\n14 May advising against the payment of ransoms. The Department does not know the\ncost of the disruption to services. Costs include: cancelled appointments; additional IT\nsupport provided by local NHS bodies, or IT consultants; or the cost of restoring data and\nsystems affected by the attack. National and local NHS staff worked overtime including\nover the weekend of 13-14 May to resolve problems and to prevent a fresh wave of\norganisations being affected by WannaCry on Monday 15 May (paragraphs 1.11 and 1.12).\n\n8 The cyber attack could have caused more disruption if it had not been\nstopped by a cyber researcher activating a ‘kill-switch’. On the evening of 12 May\na cyber-security researcher activated a ‘kill-switch’ so that WannaCry stopped locking\ndevices. This meant that some NHS organisations had been infected by the WannaCry\nransomware, but because of the researcher’s actions, they were not locked out of\ntheir devices and systems. Between 15 May and mid-September NHS Digital and\nNHS England identified a further 92 organisations, including 21 trusts, as contacting\nthe WannaCry domain, although some of these may have been contacting the\ndomain as part of their cyber-security activity. Of the 37 trusts infected and locked\nout of devices, 32 were located in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East\nNHS region. NHS England believes more organisations were infected in these regions\nbecause they were hit early on 12 May before the WannaCry ‘kill-switch’ was activated\n(paragraphs 1.14 and 2.2, and Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The NHS response to the attack\n\n9 The Department had developed a plan, which included roles and\nresponsibilities of national and local organisations for responding to an attack,\nbut had not tested the plan at a local level. This meant the NHS was not clear what\nactions it should take when affected by WannaCry. NHS England found that responding\nto WannaCry was different from dealing with other incidents, such as a major transport\naccident. Because WannaCry was different it took more time to determine the cause\nof the problem, the scale of the problem and the number of organisations and people\naffected (paragraph 3.3 and Figure 2).\n\n10 As the NHS had not rehearsed for a national cyber attack it was not\nimmediately clear who should lead the response and there were problems with\ncommunications. The WannaCry attack began on the morning of 12 May. At 4 pm\nNHS England declared the cyber attack a major incident and at 6:45 pm initiated\nits existing Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response plans to act as the\nsingle point of coordination for incident management, with support from NHS Digital\nand NHS Improvement. In the absence of clear guidelines on responding to a national\ncyber attack, local organisations reported the attack to different organisations within\nand outside the health sector, including local police. Communication was difficult in\nthe early stages of the attack as many local organisations could not communicate with\nnational NHS bodies by email as they had been infected by WannaCry or had shut down\ntheir email systems as a precaution, although NHS Improvement did communicate\nwith trusts’ chief executive officers by telephone. Locally, NHS staff shared information\nthrough personal mobile devices, including using the encrypted WhatsApp application.\nAlthough not an official communication channel, national bodies and trusts told us it\nworked well during this incident (paragraphs 3.3 to 3.5 and Figure 2).\n\n11 In line with its existing procedures for managing a major incident, NHS\nEngland initially focused on maintaining emergency care. Since the attack occurred\non a Friday this caused minimal disruption to primary care services, which tend to\nbe closed over the weekend. Twenty-two of the 27 infected acute trusts managed to\ncontinue treating urgent and emergency patients throughout the weekend. However,\nfive – in London, Essex, Hertfordshire, Hampshire and Cumbria – had to divert patients\nto other accident and emergency departments, and a further two needed outside help\nto continue treating patients. By 16 May only two hospitals were still diverting patients.\nThe recovery was helped by the work of the cyber-security researcher that stopped\nWannaCry spreading (paragraphs 1.7, 1.13 and 1.14).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Lessons learned\n\n12 NHS Digital told us that all organisations infected by WannaCry shared\nthe same vulnerability and could have taken relatively simple action to protect\nthemselves. All NHS organisations infected by WannaCry had unpatched or\nunsupported Windows operating systems so were susceptible to the ransomware.\nHowever, whether organisations had patched their systems or not, taking action\nto manage their firewalls facing the internet would have guarded organisations\nagainst infection. NHS Digital told us that the majority of NHS devices infected were\nunpatched but on supported Microsoft Windows 7 operating systems. Unsupported\ndevices (those on XP) were in the minority of identified issues. NHS Digital has also\nconfirmed that the ransomware spread via the internet, including through the N3\nnetwork (the broadband network connecting all NHS sites in England), but that there\nwere no instances of the ransomware spreading via NHSmail (the NHS email system)\n(paragraphs 1.2, 1.6 and 2.4 to 2.6).\n\n13 There was no clear relationship between vulnerability to the WannaCry\nattack and leadership in trusts. We found no clear relationship between trusts\ninfected by WannaCry and the quality of their leadership, as rated by the Care Quality\nCommission (paragraph 2.8).\n\n14 The NHS has accepted that there are lessons to learn from WannaCry and\nis taking action. Lessons identified by the Department and NHS national bodies\ninclude the need to:\n\n###### • develop a response plan setting out what the NHS should do in the event of a\ncyber attack and establish the roles and responsibilities of local and national\nNHS bodies and the Department;\n\n###### • ensure organisations implement critical CareCERT alerts (emails sent by\nNHS Digital providing information or requiring action), including applying\nsoftware patches and keeping anti-virus software up to date;\n\n###### • ensure essential communications are getting through during an attack\nwhen systems are down; and\n\n###### • ensure that organisations, boards and their staff are taking the cyber threat\nseriously, understand the direct risks to front-line services and are working\nproactively to maximise their resilience and minimise impacts on patient care.\n\nSince WannaCry, NHS England and NHS Improvement have written to every trust,\nclinical commissioning group and commissioning support unit asking boards to\nensure that they have implemented all 39 CareCERT alerts issued by NHS Digital\nbetween March and May 2017 and taken essential action to secure local firewalls\n(paragraphs 3.8 and 3.9).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Part One\n\n### The impact of the cyber attack\n\n1.1 WannaCry was the largest ever cyber attack to affect the NHS in England.\nThe timeline of the main events relating to the WannaCry ransomware attack which affected\nNHS services in the week from 12 May to 19 May 2017 is set out in Figure 2 overleaf.\n\n###### The scale of the attack\n\n1.2 NHS Digital told us that the ransomware spread via the internet, including through\nthe N3 network. As shown in Figure 1 (page 7), the WannaCry ransomware attack\naffected at least 81 out of 236 trusts across England. These numbers are based on\nNHS organisations’ own reports to NHS England. Of these 81 trusts, there were:\n\n###### • 37 trusts infected and locked out of devices (of which, 27 were acute trusts); and\n\n • 44 trusts not infected but reporting disruption.\n\nNHS England and NHS Digital identified a further 21 trusts that were attempting to\ncontact the WannaCry domain, but were not locked out of their devices. There are two\npossible reasons for this. Trusts may have become infected after the kill-switch had been\nactivated, and were therefore not locked out of their devices.[1] Alternatively, they may\nhave contacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.\n\n1.3 The trusts infected by the WannaCry ransomware experienced two main types of\ndisruption including:\n\n###### • NHS staff being locked out of devices, which prevented or delayed staff accessing\nand updating patient information, sending test results to patients’ GPs and\ntransferring or discharging patients from hospital; and\n\n###### • medical equipment and devices being locked, or isolated from trusts’ IT systems to\nprevent them being locked. This meant trusts’ radiology and pathology departments\nwere disrupted as the trusts relied on the equipment and devices for diagnostic\nimaging (such as MRI scanners) and for testing blood and tissue samples.\n\n1 A ‘kill-switch’ is a mechanism that is incorporated into software to shut down that software, or the device on which it\nsits, in an emergency situation in which it cannot be shut down in the usual manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Friday 12 May – begin to report problems Late morning First trusts – First notification to Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response team of the attack 1:06 pm NHS England’s declares the cyber attack a national major incident – 4:00 pm NHS England – Decision that would lead the response, co-ordinating with key partners, particularly NHS Digital 6:45 pm NHS England – discovers ‘kill-switch’ and stops malware spreading further Evening Cyber expert – 3,486 GP By the evening of Sunday 14 May – Only two trusts – Incident Tuesday 16 May 5:30pm Friday 19 May practices (44%) had applied necessary patches diverting patients away from A&E is stood down by NHS England|Col2|ay|– First phase of NHS England’s response: Focus on securing emergency care pathways Friday 12 May – Sunday 14 May – Second phase of NHS England’s response: Ensure that primary care services were stable Saturday 13 May – Monday 15 May – Third phase of NHS England’s response: Remedial phase Monday 15 May – Friday 19 May 595 GP practices and 45 other NHS organisations infected, NHS England Ensuring trusts Friday 12 May including 27 acute trusts worked with and primary care Front-line staff in organisations were calling up either IT suppliers of organisations had Five trusts were unable to provide emergency care, so arranged to NHS England or NHS Digital as well as the police GP practices up-to-date antivirus divert patients to other locations (commissioning software installed on Social media was also reporting the cyber attack support units or their systems There was no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS Initially unclear as to who was taking the lead. The private sector organisations had complied with NHS Digital’s instructions, so Department of Health leads on cyber issues, but support) to ‘patch’ one was put in place. This involved NHS England’s Emergency once it was clear it was a major operational incident GPs’ IT systems Preparedness, Resilience and Response team requiring providers NHS England took the lead to confirm action had been taken on a number of items|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|||Friday 19 M||\n|||||\n|||Monday 15 May||\n|||||\n|||Friday 12 May - Global ransomware attack||\n|||||\n\n\n-----\n\nAs at 19 May 2017, NHS England had identified 1,220 pieces of diagnostic equipment\nthat had been infected, 1% of all such NHS equipment. Although a relatively small\nproportion of devices, the figure does not include devices disconnected from IT systems\nto prevent infection. The trusts we spoke to told us about the disruption they had\nexperienced due to diagnostic equipment being infected or isolated, such as not being\nable to send MRI scan results to clinicians treating patients in other parts of the hospital.\n\n1.4 The disruption at trusts not infected by the ransomware was caused by:\n\n###### • the absence of timely central direction, leading to the trusts taking actions on their\nown initiative to avoid becoming infected, including shutting down devices or isolating\ndevices from their networks to protect themselves from the ransomware; or\n\n###### • trusts not being able to access electronic patient records or receive information,\nsuch as test results, because they shared data or systems with an infected trust\nwhich had shut down its systems; or\n\n###### • trusts disconnecting from the N3 network, the broadband network connecting all\nNHS sites in England.\n\n1.5 The disruption at these trusts took a number of forms. For example, some trusts\nhad to use manual workarounds to perform their usual tasks, such as providing\nmedication to patients, and record information using pen and paper. In addition,\norganisations could not receive external emails, so communication with national bodies\nand others outside their trust was severely limited.\n\n1.6 Despite widespread local disruption, NHS Digital told us that national NHS IT\nsystems managed by NHS Digital were not infected, such as the NHS Spine (a service\nholding secure databases of demographic and clinical information) and NHSmail\n(the NHS email system).\n\n1.7 Of the 27 acute trusts infected and locked out of devices, five had to divert\nemergency ambulance services to other hospitals. The five trusts and hospitals were:\n\n###### • Barts Health NHS Trust (Royal London Hospital);\n\n • Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust (Broomfield Hospital);\n\n • East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust (Lister Hospital);\n\n • Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Basingstoke Hospital); and\n\n • North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (West Cumberland Hospital).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The impact on patients\n\n1.8 As infected NHS organisations could not access important information and\nelectronic systems, including patient records, they had to cancel appointments and\noperations and some trusts had to divert patients to other accident and emergency\ndepartments. Between 12 May and 18 May, NHS England collected some information\non how many appointments had been cancelled to help it manage the incident, but\ndid not collect data on all types of appointment. NHS England identified that the NHS\nhad cancelled 6,912 appointments, but this figure does not include repeat outpatient\nappointments and cancellations identified after 18 May. NHS England estimated the total\nnumber of cancelled appointments as being around 19,494, based on the normal rate\nof follow-up appointments to first appointments, but told us it does not plan to identify\nthe actual number because it is focusing its efforts on responding appropriately to the\nlessons learned from WannaCry. NHS England did not collect data on how many GP\nappointments were cancelled or how many ambulances and patients were diverted from\nthe accident and emergency departments that were unable to treat patients.\n\n1.9 NHS organisations did not report any cases of harm to patients or of data being\ncompromised or stolen. If the WannaCry ransomware attack had led to any patient harm\nor loss of data then NHS England told us that it would expect trusts to report cases\nthrough existing reporting channels, such as reporting data loss direct to the Information\nCommissioner’s Office (ICO) in line with existing policy and guidance on information\ngovernance. NHS Digital also told us that analysis of the WannaCry ransomware\nsuggested that the cyber attack was not aimed at accessing or stealing data, although\nit does not know for certain that this is the case.\n\n1.10 The NHS continued to provide emergency care from 12 May to 19 May, although\nsome patients had to travel further as five hospitals had diverted services (paragraph 1.7).\nPatients with planned appointments experienced most disruption. Cancer charities,\nincluding Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Research UK, reported cancellations\ncausing distress to patients. NHS England’s own review identified at least 139 patients\nwho had an urgent referral for potential cancer cancelled, as at 18 May, although the\nactual number may be higher if trusts misreported during the data collection or identified\ncancellations after 18 May.\n\n###### The financial impact\n\n1.11 The Department of Health (the Department), NHS England and the National Crime\nAgency have told us that no NHS organisations paid the ransom. NHS Digital told us it\nadvised against the payment of the WannaCry ransom during site visits and telephone\nconferences with infected trusts. Furthermore, NHS England and NHS Digital wrote to\nall trusts on 14 May advising them against the payment of ransoms, but these emails\ndid not always reach trusts after that attack had begun.\n\n\n-----\n\n1.12 The NHS has not calculated the total cost of cancelled appointments; of NHS staff\novertime; of additional IT support provided by NHS local bodies or IT consultants; or the\ncost of restoring data and systems affected by the attack. For example, trusts and other\nNHS organisations had to roll back systems and restore data and systems, including\nre-entering data recorded manually while trusts’ systems were down. National and local\nNHS staff had to work overtime, including over the weekend of 13–14 May, to resolve\nproblems and to prevent a fresh wave of organisations being affected by WannaCry\non Monday 15 May.\n\n###### The recovery\n\n1.13 In line with its established procedures for responding to a major incident, NHS\nEngland focused its initial response on maintaining emergency care, and within 24 hours\nbegan attending to primary care. Since the attack occurred on a Friday it caused\nminimal disruption to primary care services, which tend to be closed over the weekend.\nTwenty-two of the 27 infected acute trusts continued treating urgent and emergency\npatients throughout the weekend. However, five trusts, including Barts Health NHS\nTrust, were unable to see some patients and had to divert them to other hospitals, and\na further two needed outside help to continue treating patients. NHS England worked\nwith trusts to ensure diverts were put in place and help provided. By Tuesday 16 May,\nonly two hospitals were still diverting patients: Lister Hospital in Hertfordshire and\nBroomfield Hospital in Essex. NHS England ‘stood down’ the incident on Friday 19 May.\n\n1.14 The recovery was aided by the work of a cyber-security researcher who activated\na kill-switch so that WannaCry stopped locking devices. The researcher triggered the\nkill-switch on the evening of Friday 12 May. This meant that some NHS organisations\nwere infected by the WannaCry malware, but because of the actions of the researcher\nthey were not locked out of their devices and systems. Between 15 May and\nmid‑September, NHS Digital and NHS England identified a further 92 organisations,\nincluding 21 trusts, attempting to contact the WannaCry domain, in addition to the initial\n45 organisations they had identified as being infected. Although some of these trusts\nmay have contacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Part Two\n\n### Why some parts of the NHS were affected\n\n2.1 NHS organisations across England were affected by the WannaCry attack.\nFigure 3 sets out the location of the trusts affected and shows the:\n\n###### • 37 trusts infected by the WannaCry malware; and\n\n • 44 trusts not infected by the malware but reporting disruption.\n\n2.2 Of the 37 trusts infected, 32 were located in the North NHS region and the\nMidlands and East NHS region. NHS England believes more organisations were infected\nin these regions because they were hit early on 12 May before the WannaCry kill-switch\nwas activated.\n\n###### Failure to patch and update systems and reliance on old software\n\n2.3 It is not possible to eliminate all cyber threats but organisations can prevent harm\nthrough good cyber-security. Such practice includes maintaining up-to-date firewalls and\nanti-virus software, and applying patches (updates) in a timely manner. NHS England’s\nview is that WannaCry infected some parts of the NHS mainly because organisations\nhad failed to maintain good cyber-security practices.\n\n2.4 NHS Digital told us that all the infected trusts had a common vulnerability in their\nWindows operating systems which was exploited by the WannaCry attack. All NHS\norganisations infected by WannaCry had unpatched, or unsupported, Windows\noperating systems. However, whether organisations had patched their systems or\nnot, taking action to manage their firewalls facing the internet would have guarded\nthe organisations against infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 shows Disruption to front-line services affected all parts of the country but was concentrated in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East NHS region\n\n###### Figure 3 Trusts affected by the cyber attack\n\nDisruption to front-line services affected all parts of the country but was concentrated\nin the North NHS region and the Midlands and East NHS region\n\nAcute trust infected\n\nOther trust infected\n\nAcute trust affected, but not infected\n\nOther trust affected, but not infected\n\nNote\n1 NHS England believes the concentration of infected trusts in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East NHS\nregion does not refl ect variations in cyber-security, but may be partially explained by these organisations becoming\ninfected earlier in the day, before the WannaCry ‘kill-switch’ was activated.\n\nSource: National Audit Offi ce analysis of NHS England data\n\n\n-----\n\n2.5 NHS Digital told us that the majority of NHS devices infected were unpatched but\non the supported Windows 7 operating system. Trusts using Windows 7 could have\nprotected themselves against WannaCry by applying a patch (or update) issued by\nMicrosoft in March 2017, and NHS Digital had issued CareCERT alerts on 17 March and\n28 April asking trusts to apply the patch.[2] According to the Department of Health (the\nDepartment), more than 90% of devices in the NHS use the Windows 7 operating system.\n\n2.6 A second issue was that some trusts were running the older Windows XP\noperating system on some devices. This made the trusts vulnerable because Microsoft\nwas no longer releasing patches for this operating system, and so they could not\nprotect their systems from WannaCry unless they isolated those devices from the\nnetwork. Some trusts also experienced issues with some medical equipment, such\nas MRI scanners that have Windows XP embedded within them (see paragraph 1.3).\nThis equipment is generally managed by the system vendors and local trusts are not\ncapable of applying updates themselves. Support from the vendors of these devices\nwas often poor according to NHS England and NHS Digital. However, trusts running\nWindows XP on their medical equipment could have protected themselves by isolating\nthese devices from the rest of the network (although this may necessitate manual\nworkarounds). In July 2017, as part of its response to the National Data Guardian review,\nthe Department told local bodies to ensure that they had moved away from, or were\nactively managing, unsupported software by April 2018.\n\n2.7 The Department and Cabinet Office had written to trusts in 2014 offering some\ntemporary help with security for old equipment until April 2015, after which time there\nwould be no support. This meant that it was essential that all NHS organisations had\n“robust plans” to migrate away from Windows XP. Despite this, the Department told\nus about 5% of the NHS IT estate, including computers and medical equipment, was\nstill using Windows XP on 12 May 2017. This is partly explained by the fact that it is not\nalways possible to remove or update Windows XP in applications and IT services based\non that operating system. Immediately after the WannaCry attack Microsoft issued a\npatch for Windows XP that would prevent WannaCry and similar ransomware.\n\n###### Leadership and size of trusts\n\n2.8 We found no clear relationship between those trusts infected by WannaCry and\nthe quality of their leadership, as rated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Of the\n37 trusts infected by WannaCry, four (11%) had been rated as ‘inadequate’ against the\n‘well-led’ domain at their last CQC inspection, compared with 7% of NHS organisations\nnot infected.[3] However, CQC had not focused on how well led trusts were in relation to\ncyber-security in their inspections before 12 May 2017. We understand CQC has plans\nto enhance its line of questions regarding information and digital systems as part of\nits inspection of the leadership of trusts in the future.\n\n2 A CareCERT alert is an email sent by NHS Digital providing information or requiring action from NHS organisations.\n3 Of the 37 trusts infected by WannaCry, 36 had a CQC rating.\n\n\n-----\n\n2.9 We also found that infected trusts tended to employ more staff than average.\nOf the 37 infected trusts:\n\n###### • 14 (38%) were among the 25% of trusts employing the most staff; and\n\n • 26 (70%) employed more than the median number of staff.\n\nAlthough there is limited evidence on why this should be the case, we found that:\n\n###### • some of the trusts we spoke to told us that integrating IT systems when trusts\nmerge (and become larger) and running many different versions of Windows\noperating systems, not all of which are supported, can be a challenge; and\n\n###### • WannaCry exploited weaknesses within parts of Microsoft’s Windows operating\nsystem used to share files within organisations. This meant it spread automatically\nin some cases, and organisations with large Windows networks were among the\nworst affected.\n\n###### Prepared for a cyber attack\n\n2.10 Before 12 May, the Department and its arm’s-length bodies did not know whether\ntrusts had complied with CareCERT alerts as no formal mechanism of assessment\nexisted at that time. On 12 May, NHS Digital worked with NHS England to put in place\na formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with\nCareCERT alerts. Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) teams\nrequested a positive return from providers by midnight on 12 May that, for example\nwhere they had:\n\n###### • not been subject to an attack, they had implemented the patch; and\n\n • been subject to an attack, they had implemented remedial works; had been\nable to roll back their systems; and could continue to provide emergency\nservices or – if not – had put mitigations in place.\n\n2.11 Before the WannaCry attack, NHS Digital offered an on-site inspection to hospitals\nto assess their cyber-security (known as ‘CareCERT Assure’). This inspection was\nvoluntary. By 12 May, NHS Digital had inspected 88 out of 236 trusts and none had\npassed. NHS Digital’s review of the WannaCry attack concluded that CareCERT\nadvice and guidance (including inspections) was mostly followed by organisations with\nrelatively mature cyber‑security arrangements, while vulnerable trusts were not taking\naction to improve their security. NHS Digital also found that, in general, trusts had\nnot identified cyber-security as being a risk to patient outcomes, and had tended to\noverestimate their readiness to manage a cyber attack. NHS Digital believes this reflects\na lack of understanding of the nature of cyber risk among trusts, rather than a neglect\nof cyber‑security.\n\n\n-----\n\n2.12 The Department and its arm’s-length bodies did not hold information on how\nprepared local organisations were to respond to a cyber attack, such as whether\ncyber-security appeared on organisations’ risk registers or whether trusts complied with\ngood practice. The Department and its arm’s-length bodies also had limited central\ninformation on trusts’ IT and digital assets such as anti-virus software and IP addresses.\nAt the start of its investigation, the National Crime Agency had to gather evidence from\nall sites, including information on the devices affected, IP addresses and network traffic,\nto assess the impact of WannaCry on the NHS, rather than being able to access the\ninformation centrally.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Part Three\n\n### How the Department and the NHS responded\n\n###### Devolved responsibility for cyber-security\n\n3.1 The Department of Health (the Department) has overall national responsibility for\ncyber-security resilience and responding to incidents in the health sector. However, the\nDepartment devolves responsibility for managing cyber-security to local organisations –\nNHS trusts, GPs, clinical commissioning groups and social care providers. Regulators\nand other national bodies oversee and support local NHS organisations. While NHS\nfoundation trusts are directly accountable to Parliament for delivering healthcare services,\nthey are held to account by the same regulators as NHS trusts. Roles and responsibilities\nfor cyber-security as at September 2017 are set out in Figure 4 on pages 22 and 23.\nIn particular:\n\n###### • NHS Improvement holds trusts and NHS foundation trusts to account for\ndelivering value for money; and\n\n###### • the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulates health and social care providers\nfor safety and quality of their services.\n\n3.2 Both bodies can mandate local NHS organisations to improve their performance.\nThey also have a role in ensuring that local bodies have appropriate cyber-security\narrangements, but neither are primarily concerned with cyber or information technology\nissues. NHS Digital provides guidance, alerts and support to local organisations on\ncyber-security, and can visit organisations to evaluate cyber-security arrangements if\nasked to do so, as part of CareCERT Assure.[4] However, NHS Digital cannot mandate\na local body to take remedial action even if it has concerns about the vulnerability of\nthat organisation.\n\n4 Prior to the WannaCry attack, NHS Digital offered an on-site inspection to hospitals to assess their cyber-security.\nThis was known as ‘CareCERT Assure’ and was voluntary. NHS national bodies are currently revising this system.\n\n\n-----\n\n<Multiple intersecting links> <\n\n###### Figure 4 Roles and responsibilities for cyber-security in the NHS as at September 2017\n\nNational and local bodies share responsibility for cyber-security in the health sector\n\nCabinet Office leads on Key guidance is published by\n(non-mandatory) policies Cabinet Office the National Cyber Security\nand principles, although all Centre, and it is supported\ndepartments and bodies are by the National Crime Agency\naccountable and responsible in leading the response\nfor their own cyber-security GCHQ National Cyber National Crime Home Office to major cyber-security\n\nSecurity Centre Agency incidents in the UK, including\n\ncriminal investigations\n\nDepartment of Health\n\nLead government Department and leads the health and care system, including overseeing cyber-security resilience and incident responses\n\nManages the interface between health and social care with the Cabinet Office, other government departments and agencies\n\nDuring a cyber incident coordinates briefings to ministers and the National Data Guardian\n\nCoordinates involvement in central government responses to incidents\n\nContributes to cross-government briefings when responding to a major incident, including when a COBRA response is called\n\nCoordinates public communications in agreement with other organisations\n\nNational Information Board NHS England NHS Digital\n\nProvides leadership across Provides information about cyber-security to commissioners Works with local healthcare to\nthe health and care sector on understand and advise on their\n\nWorks with clinical commissioning groups (CCGs),\n\nIT, including setting annual cyber-security requirements\n\ncommissioning support units and audit chairs at a leadership\n\ncommissioning priorities for\n\nlevel to support board ownership of cyber-security and overall Communicates its role in managing\n\nNHS Digital and turning these\n\nresponse when cyber incidents occur cyber-security and incidents to other\n\ninto an agreed delivery plan\n\nhealthcare organisations\n\nResponsible for helping to embed cyber-security standards\nin the health sector, eg through the NHS Standard Contract Maintains key IT systems used by healthcare\nand through the inclusion of requirements for services it organisations, such as N3 and SPINE\ncommissions, such as IT for general practioners\n\nProvides advice to the health and social\n\nResponsible for ensuring CCGs and providers (eg trusts) have care system about how to protect against,\n\nNational Data Guardian appropriate plans in place to respond to an incident or emergency or respond to, a cyber incident\n\nProvides independent advice Lead organisation when major incident called.

However, the Department had not tested the plan at a local level. This\nmeant the NHS was not clear what actions it should take when affected by WannaCry,\nincluding how it should respond at a local level. On 12 May 2017, NHS England\ndetermined that it should declare a national major incident and decided that it would\nlead the response, coordinating with NHS Digital and NHS Improvement. NHS England\ntreated the attack as a major operational incident through its existing Emergency\nPreparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) processes. However, as NHS England\nhad not rehearsed its response to a cyber attack it faced a number of challenges. The\ncyber attack was less visible than other types of incident and not confined to local areas\nor regions in the way a major transport accident would have been, for example. This\nmeant that it took more time to determine the cause of the problem, the scale of the\nproblem and the number of people and organisations affected.\n\n3.4 Without clear guidelines on responding to a national cyber attack, organisations\nreported the attack to different sources including the local police, NHS England and\nNHS Digital. For the same reason communications to patients and local organisations\nalso came from a number of sources. These included the National Cyber Security\nCentre, which was providing support to all UK organisations affected by the attack,\nNHS England and NHS Digital. In addition, the use of email for communication was\nlimited, although NHS Improvement did communicate with trusts’ chief executive officers\nby telephone. Affected trusts shut down IT systems, including some trusts disconnecting\nfrom NHS email and the N3 network as a precautionary measure.[5] The Department\ncoordinated the response with the centre of government, briefing ministers, liaising\nwith the National Cyber Security Centre and National Crime Agency, and overseeing\nNHS England’s and NHS Digital’s operational response.\n\n3.5 Affected trusts were triaged through the EPRR route and, where necessary,\nreceived assistance from national bodies, including advice and physical technical\nsupport from NHS Digital, which sent 54 staff out to hospitals to provide direct support.\nStaff at the Department, NHS England, NHS Improvement and NHS Digital, as well\nas large numbers of staff in other organisations across the NHS, worked through the\nweekend to resolve the problem and avoid further problems on Monday. NHS England’s\nIT team did not have on-call arrangements in place, but staff came in voluntarily to help\nresolve the issue. Front-line NHS staff adapted to communication challenges and shared\ninformation through personal mobile devices, including using the encrypted WhatsApp\napplication. NHS national bodies and trusts told us that this worked well on the day\nalthough is not an official communication channel.\n\n5 N3 is the broadband network connecting all NHS sites in England.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The risk of a cyber attack had been identified before WannaCry\n\n3.6 The Secretary of State for Health asked the National Data Guardian and CQC\nto undertake reviews of data security. These reports were published in July 2016 and\nwarned the Department about the cyber threat and the need for the Department to\nrespond to it. They noted the threat of cyber attacks not only put patient information\nat risk of loss or compromise but also jeopardised access to critical patient record\nsystems by clinicians. They recommended that all health and care organisations needed\nto provide evidence that they were taking action to improve cyber-security, such as\nthrough the ‘Cyber Essentials’ scheme.[6]\n\n3.7 Although WannaCry was the largest cyber-security incident to affect the\nNHS, individual NHS organisations had been victims of other attacks in recent\nyears (Figure 5 overleaf). WannaCry infected one of England’s biggest trusts, Barts\nHealth NHS Trust. This was the second cyber attack to affect the trust in six months.\nA ransomware attack had also affected Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation\nTrust in October 2016, which had led to it cancelling 2,800 appointments.\n\n###### Lessons learned\n\n3.8 The NHS has accepted that there are lessons to learn from WannaCry and is\nalready taking action. The NHS has identified the need to improve the protection of\nservices from future cyber attacks. These include the need to:\n\n###### • develop a response plan setting out what the NHS should do in the event of a\ncyber attack and establish the roles and responsibilities of local and national\nNHS bodies and the Department;\n\n###### • ensure organisations implement critical CareCERT alerts, including applying\nsoftware patches and keeping anti-virus software up to date and identifying;\n\n###### • ensure essential communications are getting through during an incident\nwhen systems are down; and\n\n###### • ensure that organisations, boards and their staff are taking the cyber threat\nseriously, understand the direct risks to front-line services and are working\nproactively to maximise their resilience and minimise the impact on patient care.\n\n3.9 Following the WannaCry attack, NHS England and NHS Improvement wrote to\nevery trust, clinical commissioning group and commissioning support unit asking boards\nto ensure that they had implemented all 39 CareCERT alerts issued by NHS Digital\nbetween March and May 2017 and had taken essential action to secure local firewalls.\n\n6 Cyber Essentials is a government-designed cyber-security certification scheme that sets out a baseline of\ncyber‑security and can be used by any organisation in any sector, see: www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/\n\n\n-----\n\n|ISIS-linked 7 February 2017 – 13 January 2017 Barts Health hackers display graphic one of the largest trusts NHS Trust, images on NHS websites in the NHS, suffers cyber attack – Variant of Globe2 ransomware 30 October 2016 – Private files 28 February 2017 attack on the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole stolen from which has Landauer, NHS Foundation Trust personal details of NHS staff – had been 2016 Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust – Global WannaCry 12 May 2017 infected by a cyber attack once before 2016, and was attack affects the NHS the subject of multiple, unsuccessful attacks during 2016|2017|Landauer was employed by the NHS to Princess of Wales Hospital, Scunthorpe General The Royal London, St Bartholomew’s, Whipps Cross and monitor radiation levels among staff Hospital and Goole and District Hospital affected as Newham hospitals were affected. well as United Lincolnshire Hospital NHS Trust due to At least 2000 current and former staff Shut down file-sharing system to investigate the attack shared IT access thought to have had details compromised Initially reported to be ransomware but later concluded by the Cancelled appointments, operations and diagnostic trust to be Trojan malware, which was successfully contained procedures.

NHS Digital has built a\nnew CareCERT Collect portal to provide assurance that trusts have implemented cyber\nalerts and to collect central data on IT and digital assets in the NHS. Since 2015, the\nDepartment has made £50 million available to provide central support to the health and\ncare system through the CareCERT suite of services.\n\n3.11 Following the WannaCry attack, in July 2017 the Department published its\nresponse to the National Data Guardian and CQC recommendations. The response built\non existing work to strengthen cyber-security in the NHS, involving the Department and\nits arm’s-length bodies. For example, NHS Digital was developing its existing services to\nsupport local organisations, including broadcasting alerts about cyber threats, providing\na hotline for dealing with incidents, sharing best practice across the health system and\ncarrying out on-site assessments to help protect against future cyber attacks; and\nNHS England had embedded the 10 Data Security Standards, recommended by the\nNational Data Guardian, in the standard NHS contract for 2017-18, and was providing\ntraining to its Board and local teams to raise awareness of cyber threats. The Department\nalso told us that a revised version of the Information Governance Toolkit is being developed\nfor use in 2018-19, and that the inspection framework used by the CQC will be updated to\nincorporate the data standards.[7]\n\n7 The Information Governance Toolkit draws together the legal rules and central guidance issued by the Department\nof Health, and presents them in a single standard as a set of information governance requirements. All health and\nsocial care providers, commissioners and suppliers are required to carry out self-assessments of their compliance\nagainst these requirements. The Toolkit is commissioned by the Department and is maintained by NHS Digital.\nSee www.igt.hscic.gov.uk/\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix One\n\n### Our investigative approach\n\n###### Scope\n\n1 We conducted an investigation into the WannaCry cyber attack that affected\nthe NHS in England on 12 May 2017. We investigated:\n\n###### • the WannaCry attack’s impact on the NHS and its patients;\n\n • why some parts of the NHS were affected; and\n\n • how the Department, NHS national bodies (NHS England, NHS Digital and\nNHS Improvement) and other national bodies, such as the National Cyber\nSecurity Centre and National Crime Agency, responded to the incident.\n\n###### Methods\n\n2 In examining the issues in paragraph one, we drew on a variety of evidence sources.\n\n3 We conducted semi-structured interviews with officials from:\n\n###### • Department of Health\n\n • NHS England\n\n • NHS Digital\n\n • NHS Improvement\n\n • Care Quality Commission\n\n • National Cyber Security Centre\n\n • National Crime Agency\n\n • Cabinet Office.\n\n\n-----\n\n4 We visited four local trusts to examine their roles and responsibilities in relation to\ncyber-security; the impact of WannaCry on the trust and its patients; and how the trust\nresponded to the incident:\n\n###### • Barts Health NHS Trust;\n\n • Bedford Hospital NHS Trust;\n\n • Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust; and\n\n • the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\n\n5 We reviewed documents relating to the WannaCry ransomware attack including\ndocuments setting out roles and responsibilities for cyber-security in the NHS and\nacross the wider public sector. We also reviewed published and unpublished research\nand reports relating to the NHS and WannaCry and cyber-security more generally.\n\n6 We carried out analysis of data provided by NHS England, NHS Digital and the\nCare Quality Commission.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix Two\n\n### Trusts infected or disrupted by WannaCry\n\n###### Figure 6 Trusts infected, or affected, by the WannaCry attack\n\nTrusts infected by WannaCry, and locked out of devices\n\n\nBarts Health NHS Trust\n\nBirmingham Community Healthcare\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nBlackpool Teaching Hospitals\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nBradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust\n\nBridgewater Community Healthcare\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nCentral Manchester University Hospitals\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nColchester Hospital University\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nCumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust\n\nEast and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust\n\nEast Cheshire NHS Trust\n\nEast Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nEssex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust\n\nGeorge Eliot Hospital NHS Trust\n\nGreater Manchester Mental Health\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nHampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\nHull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nHumber NHS Foundation Trust\n\nJames Paget University Hospitals\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nSource: NHS England\n\n\nLancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust\n\nLancashire Teaching Hospital NHS Trust\n\nMid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust\n\nNorfolk and Norwich University Hospital\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nNorth Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nNorthern Lincolnshire and Goole\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nNorthumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust\n\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust\n\nPlymouth Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nRoyal Berkshire Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\n\nSalford Royal NHS Foundation Trust\n\nShrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust\n\nSolent NHS Trust\n\nSouthport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust\n\nThe Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust\n\nUnited Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nUniversity Hospitals of Morecambe Bay\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nWrightington, Wigan and Leigh\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nYork Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\n\n-----\n\nTrusts not infected by WannaCry but known to have experienced disruption\n\n\nAiredale NHS Foundation Trust\n\nAshford and St Peters Hospitals\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nBarking, Havering and Redbridge University\nHospitals NHS Trust\n\nBarnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\n\nBedford Hospital NHS Trust\n\nBradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\nBrighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nBuckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust\n\nCalderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust\n\nCentral London Community Healthcare NHS Trust\n\nChelsea and Westminster Hospital\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nDoncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nDorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust\n\nEast Kent Hospitals University\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nGuy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust\n\nHarrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust\n\nKettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\n\nKingston Hospital NHS Trust\n\nLeeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust\n\nLeeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust\n\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nSource: NHS England\n\n\nLeicestershire Partnership NHS Trust\n\nLincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust\n\nLincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust\n\nLondon North West Healthcare NHS Trust\n\nLuton and Dunstable NHS Trust\n\nMid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nMoorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\n\nNorth West Ambulance Service NHS Trust\n\nNorthampton General Hospital NHS Trust\n\nNorthamptonshire Healthcare\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nRotherham, Doncaster and South Humber\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nSheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust\n\nSheffield Health and Social Care\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nSheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\nSouth West Yorkshire Partnership\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nSouth Western Ambulance Service\nNHS Foundation Trust\n\nSussex Community NHS Foundation Trust\n\nThe Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust\n\nUniversity Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust\n\nWest Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nWest London Mental Health NHS Trust\n\nYorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report has been printed on Evolution\nDigital Satin and contains material sourced\nfrom responsibly managed and sustainable\nforests certified in accordance with the FSC\n(Forest Stewardship Council).\n\nThe wood pulp is totally recyclable and\nacid-free.
