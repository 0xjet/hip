The moment the leader of one\nof the largest economies on the planet uttered the words 'cybersecurity',\n'ransomware', and 'executive order', quite literally every single discussion about\nransomware became political in nature. To ignore that reality is to avoid uncomfortable\nconversations but doesn't change the basic fact that everything has political\nundertones and is maneuvered by those waves of activity and power.\n\n[nicecube - 10 months ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1173756/nicecube/)\n\nGood news, I hope they got pulled over by the Russian police.\n\n\n-----\n\n[herbman - 10 months ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/827130/herbman/)\n\nContrary to what the media insist is the truth the overwhelming majority of cyber\nattacks are coming from China NOT Russia.\n\nIf you're one of those people that actually believe what the media report then you\nclearly don't have a clue to the truth but let me give you an example and the below is\nreported from the far left Guardian who eventually decided to come clean about who\nreally colluded with Russia.\n\n\"It’s Confirmed, John Brennan Colluded with Foreign Spies to Get Trump\"\n\nAn article in the Guardian last week provides more proof that one side did collude with\nforeign powers and interfered in the election. It was Hillary’s side.\n\nThen-CIA director John Brennan was the ringleader. He colluded with foreign powers\nin a massive political espionage scheme to defeat Trump according to the Guardian.\n\nI can't speak for malware in general, but I disagree when it comes to ransomware,\nwhich this article is about.\n\n\n-----\n\nPost a Comment [Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
