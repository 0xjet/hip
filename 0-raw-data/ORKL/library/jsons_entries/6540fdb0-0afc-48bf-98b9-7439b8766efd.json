The targets of this recent campaign spanned Australia, Malaysia, and Europe, as well\nas entities that operate in the South China Sea. Proofpoint’s research has been assisted by\nthe PwC Threat Intelligence team to provide the information security community with a\ncomprehensive view of the threat activity described.\n\n## Introduction\n\nProofpoint and PwC Threat Intelligence have jointly identified a cyber espionage campaign,\nactive since April 2022 through June, delivering the ScanBox exploitation framework to targets\nwho visit a malicious domain posing as an Australian news website. The joint efforts of\nProofpoint and PwC researchers provide a moderate confidence assessment that recent\ncampaigns targeting the federal government, energy, and manufacturing sectors globally may\nrepresent recent efforts by TA423 / Red Ladon. Activity which overlaps with this threat actor\nhas been publicly referred to in governmental indictments as “APT40” and “Leviathan.” This\nblog analyzes the structure and capabilities of the sample of ScanBox and the plugins\nidentified in this campaign. It also correlates this campaign and its observed victimology with\nprevious campaigns conducted by TA423 / Red Ladon which leveraged RTF template\ninjection.\n\nThe blog details:\n\nRecent targeted phishing campaigns that use URLs impersonating Australian media\nentities to deliver the ScanBox reconnaissance framework;\nHow this custom ScanBox script and related modules work;\nHow this campaign correlates to threat activity dating back to June 2021 which\nleveraged RTF template injection;\n\n\n-----\n\nThe history of the ScanBox framework; and,\nThe targeting focus of TA423/Red Ladon on domestic Australian organisations, as well\nas entities involved with offshore energy exploration in the South China Sea.\n\n**TA423 / Red Ladon: TA423 / Red Ladon is a China-based, espionage-motivated threat actor**\nthat has been active since 2013, targeting a variety of organisations in response to political\nevents in the Asia-Pacific region, with a focus on the South China Sea. Targeted organisations\ninclude defence contractors, manufacturers, universities, government agencies, legal firms\ninvolved in diplomatic disputes, and foreign companies involved with Australasian policy or\nSouth China Sea operations.\n\n## TA423 / Red Ladon Targets the Australian Government and Wind Turbine Fleets in South China Sea \n\nBeginning on 12 April 2022, and continuing through mid-June 2022, Proofpoint identified\nseveral waves of a phishing campaign resulting in the execution of the ScanBox\nreconnaissance framework, in part based on intelligence shared by PwC Threat Intelligence\nrelated to ongoing ScanBox activity. The phishing campaign involved URLs delivered in\nphishing emails, which redirected victims to a malicious website posing as an Australian news\nmedia outlet. The website’s landing page delivered a JavaScript ScanBox malware payload to\nselected targets. In [historic instances, ScanBox has been delivered from websites that were](https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-watering-hole-attacks)\nthe victim of strategic web compromise (SWC) attacks with legitimate sites being injected with\nmalicious JavaScript code. In this instance, the threat actor controls the malicious site and\ndelivers malicious code to unsuspecting users.\n\n**[A ScanBox Primer: ScanBox, detailed in open source as early as 2014 by AlienVault, is a](https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-watering-hole-attacks)**\nJavaScript based web reconnaissance and exploitation framework which allows threat actors\nto profile victims, and to deliver further malware to selected targets of interest. PwC Threat\n[Intelligence assesses it is highly likely that ScanBox is shared privately amongst multiple](https://pwc.blogs.com/files/cto-tib-20150223-01a.pdf)\nChina-based threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. A timeline of activity involving ScanBox since 2014 to May 2022_\n\nThe following China-based threat actors have been observed using ScanBox:\n\nRed Sylvan (a.k.a.

One of the ScanBox server domains used in that campaign,\nmlcdailynews[.]com, hosted several articles about Cambodian affairs and US and East Asia\nrelations, for which contents were copied from legitimate publications (Khmer Post, Asia\n[Times, Reuters, Associated Press). These were likely used as lures in phishing emails to](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections)\nconvince targets to follow malicious links to the actor-controlled ScanBox domain.\n\n## The 2022 ScanBox Campaign \n\nThe April 2022 to June 2022 ScanBox campaign primarily targeted:\n\nlocal and federal Australian Governmental agencies;\nAustralian news media companies; and,\nglobal heavy industry manufacturers which conduct maintenance of fleets of wind\nturbines in the South China Sea.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis demonstrated the comingling of targets involved in Australian governmental affairs as\nwell as offshore energy production in the South China Sea. Proofpoint previously observed\nsimilar targeting in June 2021 by TA423 / Red Ladon, wherein the threat actor would deliver a\ndownloader in DLL format via RTF template injection. The campaign showed a consistency of\nvictimology spanning thirteen months and bridging diverse phishing tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs).\n\nThe ScanBox-related phishing campaigns identified in April through June 2022 originated from\nGmail and Outlook email addresses which Proofpoint assess with moderate confidence were\ncreated by the threat actor, and utilized a variety of subjects including “Sick Leave,” “User\nResearch,” and “Request Cooperation.” The threat actor would frequently pose as an\nemployee of the fictional media publication “Australian Morning News”, providing a URL to the\nmalicious domain and soliciting targets to view its website or share research content that the\nwebsite would publish.\n\nIn emails, the threat actor claimed to be starting a “humble news website” (sic) and solicited\nuser feedback while providing a link to australianmorningnews[.]com. While this is not\nimpersonating an existing Australian media publication, it does copy content from legitimate\nnews publications (including the BBC and Sky News) which was then displayed when victims\nnavigated to the website.\n\nUpon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework.\nThe impersonation of a fictional media publication local to targets of interest is a tactic that\nProofpoint and PwC Threat Intelligence had previously observed being used in historic TA423\n[/ Red Ladon ScanBox campaigns identified preceding the Cambodian elections in 2018. The](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections)\ncontent of the emails and the malicious URL technique reprised a technique previously\nobserved in September 2021 TA423 / Red Ladon campaigns detailed later in this blog, in\nwhich the threat actor impersonated Australian media publications with its malware delivery\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. TA423 Phishing Emails 28 April 2022 and 1 June 2022_\n\n_Figure 3. The homepage of australianmorningnews[.]com, posing as “Australia’s largest news_\n_[site”. The same exact headline, picture, and text can be found in the BBC’s coverage.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-61055915)_\n\nAn interesting commonality to earlier activity can be observed across several of the\ncampaigns identified from April through May 2022. The malicious URLs provided in the emails\nalso appear to use values that are customized for each target, although they all redirect to the\nsame page and serve the same malicious payload. In one instance the threat actor was\nobserved appending the URI extension “?p=23-<##>”. It appears that p=23 specifies the page\nvalue for landing page the user is redirected to, while the number string that follows it, e.g. the\n“11” in “?p=23-11”, appears to be a unique identifier for each recipient. Proofpoint had also\nobserved customized URLs, and URL redirect destinations distinct for each target, in TA423’s\n\n\n-----\n\nearlier campaigns in March 2022. This may be an attempt by the threat actor to correlate\ntraffic to its servers, which host the page infected by ScanBox malware, with custom user\nidentifiers which targets received within the URLs via email:\n\nhxxp://australianmorningnews[.]com/?p=23-7\nhxxp://australianmorningnews[.]com/?p=23-11\nhxxp://australianmorningnews[.]com/?p=23-24\nhxxp://australianmorningnews[.]com/?p=23-27\n\n## Malware \n\nScanBox can deliver JavaScript code in one single block, or, as is the case in the April 2022\ncampaign, as a plugin-based, modular architecture. While delivering the entire code at once\nwould allow threat actors full functionality on a victim system, PwC threat intelligence analysts\nassess that a primary motivation for selectively loading plugins is likely a way to prevent\ncrashes or errors that might tip off the owners of compromised websites. PwC assesses that\nanother likely motivation to adopt a modular architecture was to reduce researchers’ visibility\nand access into the plugins and the threat actor’s toolset.\n\nCampaigns from May through June 2022 delivered the same JavaScript file with contents\nsimilar to those PwC had originally encountered in samples of ScanBox as early as 2014:\n\n**SHA-256** 7795936ed1bdb7a5756c1ff821b2dc8739966abbb00e3e0ae114ee728bf1cf1a\n\n**Filename** cwhe18nc\n\n**File type** JavaScript\n\n**File size** 24,768 bytes\n\n**.info.seed** 0c62cf7354f80d5519b71656540567a1\n\nThe malicious file executed in victim’s browsers was originally hosted at the URL:\nhxxp://image[.]australianmorningnews[.]com/i/?cwhe18nc\n\n**Main Script and Overall Characteristics: The modular architecture of ScanBox works by**\nexecuting a main JavaScript payload, and then loading additional modules to profile the\nvictim. At the very end of the code of its main module, ScanBox sets up its configuration,\nwhich includes the C2 server to contact (hxxp://image.australianmorningnews[.]com/i/ followed\nby specific URLs as described later in this blog), and the information to gather from victim\nsystems, as seen in Figure 4 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. The 2022 ScanBox initial script setting up its configuration_\n\n_Figure 5. A 2015_ _[sample of ScanBox’s initial script setting up its configuration](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/scanbox-framework/)_\n\nThe initial script harvests several types of information from visitors and serves as a setup for\nthe following stages of information gathering and potential follow-on exploitation or\ncompromise. From PwC's analysis, the capabilities of the initial ScanBox JavaScript executed\nin victim’s browsers include:\n\nGetting the current time;\n\n\n-----\n\nGetting the language of the victim s browser;\nGetting the major and minor version of Adobe Flash installed on the victim’s browser, if\nany;\nChecking if the victim’s browser is Safari or Internet Explorer;\nChecking whether the C2 is alive and responding;\nSending Information about the victim’s browser back to the C2, including:\n\nVersion of Flash installed\nLocation (that is the URL being visited);\nThe URI the victim was redirected from;\nTitle of the webpage being visited;\nDomain being visited;\nReferrer;\nUser-Agent;\nCookie;\nCharacter encoding;\nScreen width and height;\nUnderlying Operating System;\nLanguage;\nScreen’s colour depth;\nLoading further ScanBox plugins and parsing their responses back into JSON to send to\nthe C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. The initial ScanBox script checks whether it s ready and able to connect to the C2 to_\n_send back victim information_\n\nThe modular ScanBox architecture works by sending data to different responsive PHP scripts\nhosted on a same server-side folder, which in many cases in the past few years has been\ncalled /i/, and which in this case is hxxp://image[.]australianmorningnews[.]com/i/. The scripts\nperform different functions, as follows:\n\n**URI path** **Action**\n\n/i/v.php?m=b Send victim information back to the C2\n\n/i/c.php?data= Load a specified child JavaScript object\n\n/i/k.php?data= Create an iframe, or replace one, containing the data in the URL\n\n/i/p.php?data= Execute a ScanBox plugin\n\n/i/v.php?m=a&data= Heartbeat to the C2 server to know whether the C2 is online\n\n/i/v.php?m=p&data= Get information on the plugin\n\n/i/v.php?m=plug URL that plugins send gathered data back to\n\nThe one-letter script names closely match their functionality, as p.php refers to executing a\nScanBox plugin, k.php relates to keylogger data, while v.php handles victim information\nharvested by the ScanBox scripts.\n\nModern versions of ScanBox have function names prepended by a seemingly random set of\n32 alphanumeric characters (which could represent an MD5 hash), which are also referred to\nin ScanBox scripts as the .info.seed parameter. We identified other samples of the main\nScanBox script which embed different .info.seed parameter within the script on the URL:\nhxxp://image[.]australianmorningnews[.]com/i/?cwhe18nc:\n\n**SHA-256** 2f204f3b3abc97efc74b6fa016a874f9d4addb8ac70857267cc8e4feb9dbba26\n\n**Filename** cwhe18nc.js\n\n**File type** JavaScript\n\n\n-----\n\n**File size** 24,685 bytes\n\n**.info.seed** 4845456f078aa3b7ed5221b8fcda5bb4\n\n**SHA-256** 18db4296309da48665121899c62ed8fb10f4f8d22e44fd70d2f9ac8902896db1\n\n**Filename** cwhe18nc.htm\n\n**File type** JavaScript\n\n**File size** 24,518 bytes\n\n**.info.seed** d78bd216a4811d8eba37576dbe186492\n\n## Infection Chain and ScanBox Control Flow \n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. A diagram of the infection chain and ScanBox control flow_\n\n_Figure 8. A summary of ScanBox installation, control flow, and plugin activity_\n\nKeylogger plugin: The keylogger plugin records any key pressed by the victim within the\niframe created by the ScanBox code and sends data back to the C2. PwC has described an\nextremely similar module in a 2017 report on ScanBox, with the code having remained roughly\nthe same since the first ScanBox keylogger plugins were observed in 2014.\n\nVictim browser plugins Identification: This plugin gathers the name, filename, and description\nof any legitimate browser plugin installed in the victim’s browser, sending the result back to the\nC2 as a list.\n\nBrowser fingerprinting plugin: This plugin gathers further information about the victim’s\nbrowser, likely for the threat actor to understand the available attack surface and which\ncapabilities might be required for follow-on exploitation. It checks, among other details:\n\nWhether Java is installed, and if so what version;\n\n\n-----\n\nThe version of ActiveX installed;\nWhether specific Java web applications are installed;\nWhether the victim’s browser is Internet Explorer, iPhone, Firefox, Chrome, Safari,\n“Other” from the Netscape family, Opera, or “unknown”; and,\nWhether the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM) is installed in the victim’s\nbrowser.\n\nPeer connection plugin: PwC had previously documented this module in a 2017 report (‘A\nScanBox darkly’, PwC Cyber Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20170713-01A). The module\nimplements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers,\nwhich allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication\n(RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a\nset of pre-configured targets. In this sample, the targets are STUN servers at the following\nURL:\n\nstun:stun.l.google[.]com:19302, on a legitimate Google address.\n\n[STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) is a standardised set of methods, including a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN)\nnetwork protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and\nmessaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways. STUN is\nsupported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the\nInternet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP\naddress and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application's User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN\nservers as part of [Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment)\nmethod used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to\ncommunicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions.\n\nThis means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and\ncommunicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT.\n\nSecurity check plugin: The final plugin that this ScanBox instance delivers to targets checks\nwhether Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) is installed on the victim machine. This is achieved\nby calling the JavaScript method Element.getElementsByTagName(). The method checks any\nHTML Element in the victim’s browser for the value kaspersky-labs.com or klTabId_kis, which\nsignals whether code has been injected into the user's browser by Kaspersky Internet\nSecurity.\n\n## Infrastructure \n\nThe ScanBox C2 domain image[.]australianmorningnews[.]com has resolved to three IP\naddresses:\n\n\n-----\n\nIP address **First seen** **Last seen**\n\n198.13.45[.]227 2022-06-06 2022-07-08\n\n139.180.161[.]195 2022-04-26 2022-06-05\n\n45.77.237[.]243 2022-04-25 2022-04-25\n\naustralianmorningnews[.]com was first registered on 8th April 2022 with the following unique\nWHOIS information, which has not been used to register any other domain:\n\n**Email** suzannehhu316@outlook.com\n\n**Name** Florence Gourley\n\n**City** Logandale\n\n**Phone** 103,104 bytes\n\nThis domain first started resolving on 8th April 2022 to 104.168.140[.]23, a probable dedicated\nserver which also hosts an FTPd server, a Dovecot mail delivery agent, an Exim mail server,\nand a MariaDB database.\n\n## Correlating ScanBox Campaigns to Earlier TA423 RTF Template Injection Campaigns \n\nBeginning in March 2021, Proofpoint began to observe a consistent pattern of targeting\nagainst entities based in Malaysia and Australia, as well as against entities that are involved in\nthe operations and supply chain of offshore energy projects in the South China Sea. From\nJune 2021 through May 2022, Proofpoint observed an ongoing phishing campaign which\ninvolved malicious RTF attachments weaponized through template injection. Additionally, this\ncampaign made use of malicious URLs which delivered RTF template injection files. Both\ninitial infection vectors delivered first-stage downloader malware to targets. The downloaders\nretrieved XOR-encoded versions of Meterpreter shellcode.\n\nThroughout this campaign, Australian targets regularly included military academic institutions,\nas well as local and federal government, defense, and public health sectors. Malaysian targets\nincluded offshore drilling and deep-water energy exploration entities as well as global\n\n\n-----\n\nmarketing and financial companies. Several global companies were also targeted that appear\nto relate to the global supply chains of offshore energy projects in the South China Sea. These\nincluded:\n\nheavy industry and manufacturers responsible for the maintenance of offshore wind\nfarms;\nmanufacturers of installation components used in offshore wind farms;\nexporters of energy from prominent energy exploration sites in the South China Sea;\nlarge consulting firms providing expertise at projects in the South China Sea; and,\nglobal construction companies responsible for the installation of Offshore energy\nprojects in the South China Sea.\n\n_Figure 9. A Visualization of Targeted Countries_\n\nProofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the campaigns were conducted by the\nChina-based, espionage-motivated threat actor TA423, which PwC tracks as Red Ladon and\nwhich also overlaps with “Leviathan,” “GADOLINIUM,” and “APT40.”\n\nThis threat actor has demonstrated a consistent focus on entities involved with energy\nexploration in the South China Sea, in tandem with domestic Australian targets including\ndefense and health care. Both the CopyPaste attacks targeting the Australian government\nin [2021, attributed publicly to TA423 / Red Ladon, and the threat actor’s historic focus on the](https://www.cyber.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-12/ACSC-Advisory-2020-008-Copy-Paste-Compromises.pdf)\nSouth China Sea, align with the observed victimology of the long running campaign described\nin this blog. More distinctly, this threat actor has repeatedly targeted both Australian\ngovernmental and energy-related target sets within a single campaign over multiple years.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, this threat actor has been observed using both ScanBox in a watering hole capacity as\nwell as Meterpreter in intrusions within the geographic areas that this observed threat actor is\ncurrently operating.\n\nThe technical evolution of the observed campaigns can be divided into three phases.\n\n_Figure 10. A timeline of detected phishing activity involved in ongoing TA423 Campaign May_\n_2021 – June 2022_\n\nPhase 1: March 2021 – September 2021: The first phase of this campaign consisted of\nphishing targeting users in Australia and Malaysia. The emails delivered Zip Archive\n[attachments containing RTF template injection files as well as in some cases simply RTF](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/injection-new-black-novel-rtf-template-inject-technique-poised-widespread)\nattachments (not contained in Zip archives). These files would retrieve either further Zip\narchives, or macro-laden Word documents using RTF template injection which serve as a next\nstage downloader.\n\nRegardless of the nature of the downloader, the following stage payload would consist of a\nlegitimate PE and a malicious DLL stager. This DLL stager is executed using DLL sideloading\nand communicates with a threat actor-controlled server to retrieve a response encoded with a\nsingle-byte XOR. The decoded response is Meterpreter shellcode which is executed on the\nvictim’s machine.\n\nSimilarly to ScanBox activity in April 2022 to June 2022, several of the domains utilized to\ndeliver malware payloads and to communicate with threat actor C2 servers were themed\naround Australian news media. Most notably, the domains impersonated “The Australian” and\n“Herald Sun.” Examples of malicious URLs originating from RTF Template Injection phishing\nattachments from this phase of the campaign include:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://theaustralian[.]in/europa.eeas (RTF Template URL Retrieving Macro\nDocument)\nhxxps://theaustralian[.]in/office (Macro Initiated Request Retrieving Legitimate PE)\nhxxps://theaustralian[.]in/word (Macro Initiated Request Retrieving DLL Loader/Stager)\nheraldsun[.]me (Meterpreter C2)\n\nPhase 2: March 2022: The second observed phase of this campaign occurred in March 2022,\nand consisted of phishing campaigns which used RTF template injection attachments\nleveraging template URLs that were customized for each target. Despite returning the same\npayload to all victims, these URLs were distinct, with each including a victim ID number that\ncorrelated to the intended victims, allowing the threat actor to track active infections based on\nthe initial URL beacons to the staging server.\n\nThe RTF template injection URL returned a macro-laden Microsoft Word document. The\nmacro contains a series of hardcoded hex bytes stored as strings. These strings are\nreassembled by the macro and converted into two files, a PE and a DLL, which are saved to\nthe victim host and executed. The macro also makes a URL request seemingly to return an\n“UpdateConfig” value which may be used by the final installed payload. At the time of\ndiscovery, Proofpoint could not successfully retrieve the payload. However, Proofpoint\nanalysts have previously observed the weaponised RTF files ultimately delivering a DLL\ndownloader which retrieves an XOR encoded Meterpreter payload response. Notably, the\nrecurring use of custom URLs that are unique to each victim, likely for infection tracking\npurposes, is a commonality to the ScanBox phishing URLs observed later in April 2022.\n\nPhase 3: April 2022 – June 2022: The current phase of this ongoing campaign consisted of\nmalicious Australian media-themed URLs delivered in phishing emails characterized above.\nThese URLs utilized victim-specific URLs in some instances, and redirected users to a\nwebsite posing like that of an Australian media themed site. While this version of ScanBox has\nbeen customized to download subsequent modules, it is unencoded and heavily resembles\nearlier versions of standard ScanBox code base.\n\n## A Case Study in Victimology: Targeting of the Kasawari Gas Field and Entities Involved with its Supply Chain \n\nOn 2 June 2021 numerous emails were sent from a Gmail email address to several\ncompanies involved with deep water drilling, oil and petroleum exploration, and Australian\nNaval Defense. The emails used “COVID19 passport services in Australia” themes to deliver\nthe aforementioned ZIP and RTF attachments that utilize RTF template injection to download\na DLL stager and downloader payload leading to a Meterpreter payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. RTF Template Injection Attachment titled “COVID-19 and passport services_\n_Australia.”_\n\nThis campaign focused heavily on Malaysia, and specifically on companies that appear to be\ninvolved in either the engineering, extraction of natural gasses, or export of natural gas\nproducts from the Kasawari Gas Project off the coast of Malaysia. Specifically, four of the eight\nentities targeted by this campaign were associated directly with this project. Additional targets\nobserved in this campaign were involved in Australian Defense universities, consumer\nhealthcare in Australia, and large financial banking entities in Malaysia. A similar array of\ntargeting across Australian domestic entities and organisations operating in the South China\nSea was later observed in the May 2022 ScanBox campaign that was described in the Phase\n3 phishing activity section of this publication.\n\nIn close temporal proximity to the cyber espionage campaigns targeting these entities, the\n[Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported disruption at the project site stemming from](https://amti.csis.org/contest-at-kasawari-another-malaysian-gas-project-faces-pressure/)\nChinese Coast Guard Intervention. Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this\nactivity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon,\nwhich [multiple](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-200a) [reports](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor) [assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China. A 2021 indictment by](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/15/hainan-xiandun-technology-company-is-apt40/)\nthe US Department of Justice [assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1412916/download)\nsupport to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS). One of TA423’s longest\nrunning areas of responsibility is assessed to include the South China Sea, with the US\nDepartment of Justice indictment indicating that the threat actor has historically focused on\nintellectual property related to naval technology developed by federally-funded defense\ncontractors globally. This indictment also explicitly included the mention of the existence of the\nYulin Naval Base which has been stated to be located on Hainan Island.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile a direct correlation cannot be drawn between the cyber espionage campaign targeting\nentities involved with the site and portions of its supply chain in the days directly preceding\nkinetic naval intervention, the historic targeting focus of TA423 / Red Ladon and the\nsubsequent naval intervention may suggest that this project in the South China Sea was\nhighly likely an area of priority interest for the threat actor.\n\n## A Case Study Extended: TA423 Targets the Supply Chain of the Yunlin Offshore Windfarm in the Strait of Taiwan \n\nOn 24th, 28th, and 29th March 2022, Proofpoint observed phishing activity leveraging RTF\ntemplate injection that targeted a European manufacturer of heavy equipment utilized in the\ninstallation of an offshore windfarm in the Strait of Taiwan. Specifically, the manufacturer\ntargeted was a key supplier of equipment for entities involved in the construction of the Yunlin\nOffshore Windfarm. This is a project which begun in 2020 and was projected to be completed\n[in 2022. However, the project began to encounter construction delays which resulted in](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/sapura-energy-pulls-out-taiwan-offshore-wind-farm-project)\nseveral major contractors terminating contracts and leaving the project unfinished between\n[November 2021 and February 2022. This offshore energy project resumed in late April 2022.](https://www.offshorewind.biz/2022/04/29/construction-on-yunlin-offshore-wind-farm-resumes/)\n\nThe dates of the observed phishing activity align with the period between 2nd February 2022\nand 28th April 2022 where the project’s future was uncertain. The targeting of supply chain\nentities by TA423 during this period of project uncertainty is notable, since the group has\npreviously targeted projects in the South China Sea during key moments in their development\ntimeline.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 12. Map of Projected Offshore Windfarms in the Strait of Taiwan Circa 2018](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/43091476)_\n\n## Conclusion \n\nThis blog examined several phases of a sustained phishing campaign, running for over a year\nand currently ongoing, that Proofpoint and PwC threat intelligence analysts attribute to the\nChina-based, espionage motivated threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon. The campaign has an\ninternational reach, but a heavy focus on the Asia Pacific region, Australian governmental\nentities, and companies and countries operating in the South China Sea. In particular,\nProofpoint has observed TA423 / Red Ladon targeting entities directly involved with\ndevelopment projects in the South China Sea closely around the time of tensions between\nChina and other countries related to development projects of high strategic importance, such\nas the Kasawari Gas field developed by Malaysia, and an offshore wind farm in the Strait of\nTaiwan.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, other than its custom toolset and offensive security tools like\nMeterpreter, TA423 / Red Ladon has also returned to ScanBox. The last time that TA423 / Red\nLadon was publicly documented using ScanBox was in 2018. While ScanBox activity has\nbeen reported more sporadically since its first appearance in 2014 and heavy use in 2015, it\n\n\n-----\n\nremains a tool available to, and shared among, China-based threat actors to selectively\ndeploy in campaigns. We have observed TA423 / Red Ladon using ScanBox, both in 2018\nand 2022, in campaigns using an upcoming national election as a lure, wherein the threat\nactor built local news-themed malicious websites to draw targets to in order to infect them.\n\nFollowing the US Department of Justice indictment and public disclosure in July 2021,\nProofpoint analysts have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo specifically\nfor phishing campaigns associated with TA423/Red Ladon. While the indictment attributed this\nthreat actor to a specific entity operating with support of a Chinese state intelligence agency,\nthe technical details included did not cover the tactics currently in use by the group in the wild.\nAs a result, the group was free to continue its usage of novel phishing techniques like RTF\nTemplate Injection which began in early 2021 (before the indictment) and persisted through\nMarch 2022.\n\nOverall, Proofpoint and PwC collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its\nintelligence-gathering and espionage mission primarily targeting countries in the South China\nSea, as well as further intrusions in Australia, Europe and the United States.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Phase 3 IOCs (April to June 2022)**
