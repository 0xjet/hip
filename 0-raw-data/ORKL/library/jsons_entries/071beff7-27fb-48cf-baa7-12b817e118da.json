Targeted email containing malicious PowerPoint_**\n\nIn one example, opening the PowerPoint attachment displays a series of video stills\nshowing a missile destroying a jet plane. During the final PowerPoint slide, a dialog\nwindow is displayed to the user requesting permission to run an executable file:\n\n**_Figure 2. Final PowerPoint slide prompts user to run a .scr file_**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Symantec detects this malicious executable as Trojan.Madi using the latest LiveUpdate](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-071723-0755-99)\ndefinitions. It is capable of stealing information—including keylogging functionality. The\nTrojan can also update itself. We have observed Trojan.Madi communicating with\ncommand-and-control servers hosted in Iran and, more recently, Azerbaijan.\n\nTargets of the Madi campaign appear to be all over the spectrum but include oil\ncompanies, US-based think tanks, a foreign consulate, as well as various governmental\nagencies, including some in the energy sector.\n\n**_Figure 3. Heat map distribution of global Madi infections_**\n\nAlthough Madi has been seen targeting various Middle Eastern countries, it has also been\nfound across the globe from the United States to New Zealand.\n\n**_Figure 4. Infection percentages of Madi from December 2011 to July 2012_**\n\nWhere high profile attacks such as Flamer, Duqu, and Stuxnet utilize different techniques\nto exploit systems—including leveraging zero-day attacks—the Madi attack relies on social\nengineering techniques to get onto targeted computers.\n\nTargets like Iran, Israel, and Saudi Arabia might suggest involvement of a nation state,\nhowever our research has not found evidence that this is the case. Instead, the current\nresearch indicates these attacks are being conducted by an unknown Farsi-speaking\nhacker with a broad agenda.\n\n**Update [July 18, 2012] - Distribution map (Figure 3) and pie chart (Figure 4) updated to**\nreflect telemetry data.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
