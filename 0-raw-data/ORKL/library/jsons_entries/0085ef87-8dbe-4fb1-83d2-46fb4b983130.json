DroidJack is a program\nthat facilitates remote spying and recently made news when European law enforcement\nagencies made arrests and raided the homes of suspects as part of an international malware\ninvestigation.\n\nOmniRat and DroidJack are RATs (remote administration tools) that allow you to gain remote\nadministrative control of any Android device. OmniRat can also give you remote control of\nany Windows Linux or Mac device Remote administrative control means that once the\n\n\n-----\n\nsoftware is installed on the target device, you have full remote control of the device.\n\nOn their website, OmniRat lists all of the things you can do once you have control of an\nAndroid, which include: retrieving detailed information about services and processes running\non the device, viewing and deleting browsing history, making calls or sending SMS to any\nnumber, recording audio, executing commands on the device and more.\n\nLike DroidJack, OmniRat can be purchased online, but compared to DroidJack, it’s a\nbargain. Whereas DroidJack costs $210, OmniRat costs only $25 to $50 depending on which\ndevice you want to control.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, “Why is software like this being sold on the Internet?”.\nAccording to DroidJack’s creator, Sanjeevi, “Droidjack is a parental tool for Android remote\nadministration,” but Europol has made it very clear that using software like DroidJack for\nmalicious purposes can have major consequences. In an investigation supported by Europol\nand Eurojust, law enforcement agencies in Europe and the U.S. arrested users of DroidJack.\n\n## OmniRat variant in the wild\n\nA custom version of OmniRat is currently being spread via social engineering. A user on a\nGerman tech forum, Techboard-online, describes how a RAT was spread to his Android\ndevice via SMS. After researching the incident, I have come to the conclusion that a variant\nof OmniRat is being used.\nThe author of the post received an SMS stating an MMS from someone was sent to him (in\nthe example, a German phone number is listed and the SMS was written in German). The\nSMS goes on to say “This MMS cannot be directly sent to you, due to the Android\nvulnerability StageFright. Access the MMS within 3 days [Bitly link] with your telephone\nnumber and enter the PIN code [code]“. Once the link is opened, a site loads where you are\nasked to enter the code from the SMS along with your phone number.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce you enter your number and code, an APK, mms-einst8923, is downloaded onto the\nAndroid device. The mms-einst8923.apk, once installed, loads a message onto the phone\nsaying that the MMS settings have been successfully modified and loads an icon, labeled\n“MMS Retrieve” onto the phone.\n\nOnce the icon is opened by the victim, mms-einst8923.apk extracts OmniRat, which is\nencoded within the mms-einst8923.apk. In the example described on Techboard-online, a\ncustomized version of OmniRat is extracted.\n\nThe OmniRat APK requires users to accept and give OmniRat access many permissions,\nincluding edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, modify or delete the contents of the\nSD card. All of these permissions may seem evasive and you may be thinking, “Why would\nanyone give an app so much access?”, but many of the trusted and most downloaded apps\non the Google Play Store request many of the same permissions. The key difference is the\nsource of the apps. I always recommend that users read app permissions carefully. However,\nwhen an app you are downloading directly from the Google Play Store requests permissions,\nit is rather unlikely the app is malicious. I therefore advise you only download apps directly\nfrom the Google Play Store. If, like this in case, the app is downloaded from an untrusted\nsource, users should be highly suspicious of the permissions being requested.\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.android.engine\n\n\nOnce installed, OmniRat gives full remote administrative control of the device to the attacker.\nEven if the victim deletes the original “MMS Retrieve” icon installed with the mms-einst8923,\nOmniRat remains on the infected device. The victim then has no idea their device is\n**being controlled by someone else and that every move they make on the device is**\n**being recorded and sent back to a foreign server.**\n\n**Furthermore, once cybercriminals have control over a device’s contact list, they can**\n**easily spread the malware to more people. Inside this variant of OmniRat, there is a**\n**function to send multiple SMS messages. What makes this especially dangerous is**\n**that the SMS spread via OmniRat from the infected device will appear to be from a**\n**known and trusted contact of the recipients, making them more likely to follow the link**\n**and infect their own device.**\n\nWe know that the data collected by the customized version of OmniRat targeting the German\nperson from the Techboard-online forum post is being sent back to a Russian domain, based\non the command and control (C&C) server address the data is being sent to.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “.ru” server address tell us the data\n\nis being sent back to a Russian domain.\n\nThe left image above was taken from OmniRat’s Website and shows the audio data that is\nbeing extracted from the victim’s device. The right image is of the custom version of OmniRat\nand shows the similarity of the data (and the order) that it is being gathered in and sent back\nto a Russian domain.\n\nIn the image above,\n\nwe can see all the dex classes of the second APK file that gather various information about\nthe device and sends it back to the server.\n\n## How to protect yourself\n\nMake sure you have an antivirus solution installed on your smartphone to detect\nmalware, like OmniRat. Avast detects OmniRat as Android:OmniRat-A [Trj].\n\n\n-----\n\nDo not open any links from untrusted sources. If an unknown number or email address\nsends you a link, do not open the link.\nDo not download apps from unknown sources to your mobile device. Only download\napps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.\n\n\n-----",
