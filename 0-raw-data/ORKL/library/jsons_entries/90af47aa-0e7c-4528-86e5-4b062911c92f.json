This will cause two drivers to be extracted to the folder; the vulnerable GIGABYTE\ngdrv.sys driver and the malicious RobbinHood driver called rbnl.sys.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Drivers in the Windows Temp Folder**\nROBNR will now install the GIGABYTE driver and exploit it to disable Windows driver\nsignature enforcement.\n\n**Installed vulnerable GIGABYTE gdrv.sys driver**\nOnce driver signature enforcement is disabled, ROBNR can now install the malicious\nrbnl.sys driver, which will be used by Steel.exe to terminate and delete antivirus and\nsecurity software.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Installed RobbinHood driver that kills processes**\nThe Steel.exe program will read the list of processes that should be terminated and\nservices whose files should be deleted from a file called PLIST.TXT. It will then look for\neach of the listed processes or files and either terminate or delete them.\n\n**Code used by the driver to**\n\n**delete files**\n\nSource: Sophos\nAt this time, Sophos has told BleepingComputer that they have been unable to gain access\nto the PLIST.TXT file and do not know what processes and services are being targeted.\n\nWhen Steel.exe has finished terminating security software, the ransomware will now be\nable to encrypt a computer without fear of being detected.\n\nWith the high payouts of network-wide ransomware attacks, attackers are investing a lot of\nresources into new and innovative methods to bypass security software and protections in\nWindows.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs these attacks cannot take place without a network first being compromised, the best way\nto protect yourself is to make the network less vulnerable.\n\nThis includes performing phishing recognition training, making sure security updates are\ninstalled, and removing access to Internet exposed services like Remote Desktop Services.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Driver](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/driver/)\n[GIGABYTE](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gigabyte/)\n[LoLBin](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/lolbin/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[RobbinHood](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/robbinhood/)\n[Security Software](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/security-software/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
