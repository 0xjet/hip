The campaign consists\nof two phases: A reconnaissance phase that involves a custom file enumerator and infector\nto the victims and an attack phase that deploys a variety of commodity RATs, such as DcRAT\nand QuasarRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How did it work?\n\nThe threat actor registered multiple domains with political and government themes. These\ndomains hosted malware payloads that were distributed to their victims. Their malicious lures\nalso contained themes related to Afghan entities, specifically diplomatic and humanitarian\nefforts. We assess with high confidence that the threat actor behind these attacks is an\nindividual operating under the guise of a Pakistani IT firm called \"Bunse Technologies.\"\n\nThe infection chains consist of malicious RTF documents and PowerShell scripts that\ndistribute malware to victims. We've also observed the usage of C#-based downloader\nbinaries to deploy malware while displaying decoy images to victims to appear legitimate.\n\n## So what?\n\nThis campaign is a classic example of an individual threat actor employing political,\nhumanitarian and diplomatic themes in a campaign to deliver commodity malware to victims.\n[Commodity RAT families are increasingly being used by both crimeware and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/rat-campaign-targets-latin-america.html) [APT groups to](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\ninfect their targets. These RATs are packed with multiple functionalities to achieve complete\ncontrol over the victim's endpoint - from preliminary reconnaissance capabilities to arbitrary\ncommand execution and data exfiltration. These families also act as excellent launch pads\nfor deploying additional malware against their victims. Furthermore, these out-of-the-box\nfeatures enable the attackers to make minimal configuration changes to the RATs taking\naway the need for a full-fledged development cycle of custom malware by an actor.\n\nThe use of a custom file enumerator and infector module by the attackers indicates their\nintent to proliferate by infecting benign, trusted documents to achieve an even greater\ndegree of infection.\n\n## Campaign phases\n\nA typical infection would consist of a malicious document, such as an RTF file exploiting\n[CVE-2017-11882, a stack overflow vulnerability that enables arbitrary code execution on a](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11882)\nvulnerable version of Microsoft Office.\n\nThe recon phase deployed a custom file enumerator and infector module. This module\naimed to discover all the different Office files on an infected endpoint. The infector module is\nmeant to weaponize all .doc, .docx and .rtf files present in removable drives connected to the\nsystem to exploit CVE-2017-11882.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attack phase consists of deploying RAT payloads, such as DcRAT and QuasarRAT, to\nthe victim's endpoint instead of the file recon and infector modules seen previously. All the\nmalware observed in the attack phase of the campaign consisted of commodity RATs\ncompiled and deployed with minimal changes.\n\n### Reconnaissance phase\n\nIn the beginning of 2021, the actor used a particularly interesting infection chain. The\n[malicious RTF would exploit CVE-2012-11882 — a code execution vulnerability in Office —](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11882)\nto execute a malicious PowerShell command (called Stage 1 here) to extract and execute\nthe next stage PowerShell script (Stage 2).\n\nStage 1 base64 decodes the next-stage payload via certutil.exe, drops it to disk and\nexecutes it.\n\nStage 2 payload base64-encoded as a fake certificate in the maldoc.\n\nStage 2 is another PowerShell script that base64 decodes another payload (this time a\nloader executable) and activates it on the infected endpoint.\n\nStage 2 PowerShell script snippet.\n\n**Stage 3 — Loader**\n\nThe loader executable begins by establishing persistence for itself via a shortcut in the\ncurrent user's Startup directory.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then compiles hardcoded C# code into an executable assembly and invokes the entry point\nfor the compiled malicious code. This malicious source code is a custom file enumerator and\ninfector, which we'll cover later.\n\n**Stage 4 — Final payload**\n\nThe final payload is C# code compiled and invoked into the Stage 3 compiler process. This\ncode consists of two key functionalities:\n\nFile Enumerator: This component lists specific file types on the endpoint and sends the\nfile paths to the C2.\nFile Infector Modules: The infector modules here aren't the popular executable infectors\nseen usually in the wild. These modules are used for infecting benign Office documents\nwith malicious OLE objects to weaponize them to exploit CVE-2017-11882.\n\n### Attack phase\n\nSubsequent infection chains used by the actor around July and August 2021 saw the\nintroduction of infection chains with minor variations, now deploying RATs — including dcRAT\n— as the final payloads. Again, these infection chains use malicious RTF documents\nexploiting CVE-2017-11882 to execute a Stage 2 PS1 script. The Stage 2 script would then\ncreate a BAT file on disk which would, in turn, execute another PowerShell command to\ndownload and activate the final payload on the infected endpoint.\n\nPowerShell command.\n\nThe BAT file subsequently downloads the final payload from the remote location specified\nand executes it on the endpoint.\n\nSo far, we've observed the delivery of three types of payloads from the remote locations\ndiscovered in this phase of the campaign: DcRAT, QuasarRAT and a legitimate copy of the\nremote desktop client AnyDesk.\n\n## Final malicious payloads\n\n\n-----\n\nThese attacks deliver either of the three types of payloads to a target endpoint with the first\nbeing a legitimate copy of AnyDesk. This indicates a focus on manual operations where the\nactor would have logged into the infected devices to discern if the access was of any value.\n\n### Custom file enumerator and infector\n\nWe've also observed the use of a custom stealer and infector component delivered in early\ninfection phases of the campaign as either:\n\nHardcoded source code, compiled on the fly and invoked into the loader.\nCompiled binaries embedded in malicious RTFs.\n\nIt consists of four key functionalities:\n\nUpdater\n\nGet the version number from the C2 server and download a newer version if needed.\nFile enumerator\n\nThe file enumerator lists files with specific file extensions via cmd.exe for every Fixed drive\non the system. This information is recorded into a file on disk and subsequently exfiltrated to\nthe C2. The files extensions of interest are: .docx, .xlsx, .xls, .doc, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .xlt, .xla,\n.xll, .pps, .pot and .inp.\n\nFile enumeration via cmd.exe.\n\nFile infector\n\nTraditional file infectors usually target executables such as EXEs to infect targets with\nmalicious code. Other script-based worms, such as Jenxcus, would replace the target-benign\n\n\n-----\n\ndocuments on a removable drive with malicious shortcuts to ensure the execution of their\nmalicious hidden scripts.\n\nThis particular infector seen in these attacks, however, goes after Office documents,\nspecifically .doc, .docx and .rtf files. The infector checks for the presence of removable, CDROM or Network drives attached to the endpoint to find either of the file extensions. Any files\nfound are weaponized using an embedded RTF file to exploit CVE-2017-11882. The\ndocuments are basically reconstructed as a malicious RTF to consist of:\n\nA weaponized RTF exploiting CVE-2017-11882 to execute the Stage 1 PowerShell\nscript.\nThe benign copy of the target document (converted to RTF format).\nThe malicious PS1 script (Stage 1) embedded in the final RTF's overlay after a\nspecified marker.\n\nDOCX infector code.\n\nThis is an interesting method of proliferation to ensure the spread of the infection within\nrestricted networks. Infecting benign documents in an enterprise carries two advantages:\n\nInfecting existing files, especially documents, takes away the need to social engineer\nmore victims into executing external infection vectors such as suspicious attachments\nor clicking on untrusted links to infect themselves.\nInfected files also carry with them the inherent trust of the original authors of the benign\ncontent, thus increasing the likelihood of victims infecting themselves.\n\nBrowser credential stealer\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stealer tried to gather the login data for the following browsers:\nBrave, Google Chrome, Opera, Opera GX, Microsoft Edge, YandexBrowser and Mozilla\nFirefox.\n\n### DcRAT\n\nDcRAT is a relatively new commodity RAT family observed in the wild in 2019. In the current\ncampaigns, we've discovered multiple DcRAT payloads hosted on attacker-controlled\nwebsites. These payloads were then delivered to their victims during the infection phase of\nthe campaign.\n\nThe DcRAT payloads have minimal changes to their configuration, with only the C2 server\nconfiguration modified.\n\nDcRAT contains a variety of functionalities including remote shells, process management, file\nmanagement and keylogging.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nDcRAT features are listed by the malware author.\n\n### QuasarRAT\n\nAnother highly prolific RAT family used by the threat actor is QuasarRAT. Quasar provides a\nplethora of functionalities, including the standard features such as remote shell, file\nmanagement, arbitrary command execution and credential stealing.\n\nQuasarRAT features.\n\n### AndroRAT\n\nWe've also discovered versions of AndroRAT, another commodity Android RAT utilized by\nthe attackers sharing the same C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe author's AndroSpy description.\n\n## Observations and analysis\n\n### Domains and themes\n\nThe domains registered by the actor include several different themes. One of the domains\ncalled jayshreeram[.]cf was a reference to a religious Hindu slogan. This domain was then\nused to host DdcRAT.\n\nIn other instances, the attackers registered and employed domains posing as those of\nAfghan entities such as af-gov[.]ml and afghancdn[.]world.\n\nSome of the decoy images downloaded and displayed also use Afghan themes, such as one\nposing as the White House's official press release on the June 2021 visit from Afghanistan's\nvice president and the chairman of the HCNR, the Afghan council established to negotiate\nwith the Taliban.\n\n\n-----\n\nA decoy image bearing an Afghan theme.\n\nThe attacker also used an image hosted on a Pakistani news channel — samaa[.]tv. The\ndecoy image depicted the Wesh-Chaman border crossing between Pakistan and\nAfghanistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nA decoy image depicting the Wesh-Chaman border.\n\nInterestingly, this news channel's website has previously been reported to have been\n[breached and defaced twice in 2014 by allegedly Pakistani hackers.](http://zone-h.com/archive/filter%3D1/fulltext%3D1/domain%3Dsamaa.tv)\n\nThe picture above is also used as an icon for multiple RAT downloaders contacting\njayshreeram[.]cf to download malicious payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early 2021, this actor used a list of Afghan refugee high schools in Quetta, Pakistan to\nserve the malicious file enumerator and infector implant to targets.\n\nOne of the lures used in the campaign contains a list of high schools in a Pakistani town.\n\n### Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that an actor operating under the moniker \"A.R.\nBunse\" facilitated or actively carried out this malicious campaign. The actor appears to be\nmasquerading as the owner of a fake Pakistan-based IT firm, Bunse Technologies, a\ncompany the adversary uses to issue SSL certificates to their malicious websites.\n\nA Bunse Technologies-issued SSL certificate for one of the actor-controlled domains,\nafghancdn[.]world.\n\n**What is Bunse Technologies?**\n\nBunse Technologies (BunseTech) is a software development and marketing agency based\nout of Lahore, Pakistan. Their domain bunsetechnologies[.]com was first registered in April\n2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nBunseTech on Facebook.\n\nThis company appears to be a spurious entity set up to facilitate the actor's malicious\nactivities. Its website, bunsetechnologies[.]com, does not resolve currently. It has a small\nsocial media presence, with only one follower on Twitter and less than 60 followers on\nFacebook.\n\n**The owner and operator**\n\nThe Facebook page for BunseTech claims the CEO of the company is an individual named\n\"A.R. Bunse,\" an experienced cybersecurity analyst and project manager. We shall refer to\nthis individual as \"A R \" A R also has a presence on social media specifically Twitter where\n\n\n-----\n\nthey post pro-Pakistani content. This content dates back to 2016 with nationalist themes\nthroughout the actor's timeline, from pro-Taliban content to anti-Indian sentiments.\n\nA.R. on Twitter.\n\nA.R. is active with other projects, as well. Starting in August 2021, they offered training\nclasses online for individuals interested in different topics that consisted of (among others):\nmarketing, social media, web and video game development, along with malware\ndevelopment and hacktivist courses.\n\n**The GitHub Repositories**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe discovered a GitHub account hosting a couple of suspicious repositories. This account\nwas again owned and maintained by the individual \"A.R.\"\n\nGithub account of the campaign author A.R.\n\nWhat's interesting here is that the individual maintained two specific repositories of interest:\n\n**DcRat: A repo containing the source code of the leaked commodity RAT.**\n**drive-cdn: Drive-cdn is a repo that contains a single malicious ZIP file called \"File.zip.\"**\n\nGitHub repo containing the malicious archive.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis ZIP file contains an obfuscated copy of DcRAT connecting to afghancdn[.]world to\ndownload and display an Afghanistan-related decoy image to the infected victim.\n\nRAT embedded (on June 26, 20212021-06-26) in the ZIP archive hosted on A.R.'s GitHub.\n\nBased on these findings, we believe with moderate confidence that the A.R. actor helped\nfacilitate or actively spread the maldocs carried out the maldoc campaigns.\n\nThe decoy image is a press release dated June, 20 2021, the same date as the White\nHouse's official statement.\n\nThe press release is a statement on the Afghan dignitaries' visit to the White House on\nJune 25, 2021.\n\nThe GitHub repo \"drive-cdn\" and the DcRAT sample(s) were built on June 26, 2021,\none day after the diplomatic meetings were held.\n\nThe malicious domain afghancdn[.]world was registered on June 15, 2021, likely in\npreparation for this particular attack on Afghan entities.\n\nThese findings indicate that this is an actor operating malware campaigns under the guise of\na software development firm. These attacks aim to deploy a variety of commodity RATs\nagainst their victims. Based on the lures and decoys, these victims are almost certainly\nIndian and Afghan government and diplomatic entities.\n\n## Downloaders and loaders\n\nTalos has also discovered the use of multiple C#-based downloaders to proliferate the RAT\nfamilies. The typical execution chain involved downloading and displaying a decoy image\nwhile activating the malicious RAT on the victim's system.\n\nThere were four major types of downloaders observed in this campaign, which we'll outline\nbelow.\n\n**Downloaders using PowerShell**\n\nThese downloaders are C#-based and usually obfuscated. They consist of an encrypted\nPowerShell command executed to download the next-stage payload executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloader containing the encrypted PowerShell command.\n\nThe decrypted PowerShell command performs some rudimentary anti-virtual machine\nchecks, downloads and opens a decoy image and the actual payload to the endpoint:\n\nMalicious PowerShell command executed by the downloader.\n\n**Simple C#-based downloaders**\n\n\n-----\n\nThese downloaders are straightforward in their implementation (C#-based) where, again,\nthey download and open a decoy image and the actual malware payload. The difference\nhere, however, is that the malware payload downloaded is double base64-encoded.\n\nWe've observed these downloaders deploying obfuscated copies of QuasarRAT to\nendpoints.\n\n\n-----\n\nC#-based downloader downloading a double base64-encoded malware payload.\n\n**The source code compilers**\n\nDuring the reconnaissance phase, the attackers used loaders consisting of hardcoded\n\n\n-----\n\nsource code that was compiled on the fly and invoked by the loader process. The hardcoded\nsource code was that of the custom file enumerator and infectors.\n\nThe attackers utilized similar downloaders during their attack phase. These downloaders\nwould, however, download the malicious source code from a remote location, compile it and\nexecute in the downloader process' memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource code downloaded and compiled on the fly.\n\nThe malicious source code is meant to base64 decode an embedded executable, drop it to\n\n\n-----\n\ndisk, establish persistence for it and, finally, run it on the infected endpoint.\n\nThe binaries seen embedded in the source code were obfuscated copies of QuasarRAT.\n\nMalicious source code downloaded from a remote location.\n\n**Loaders**\n\nIn some cases, we also observed the use of obfuscated loaders containing embedded RAT\nexecutables such as DcRAT. The loader would simply perform anti-analysis checks and drop\nthe RAT to disk, set up persistence and execute it.\n\nIn other cases, the actors used C-based loaders to load and invoke the compiled C# file\nenumerator module in memory.\n\nFile enumerator and infector strings in loader process' memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis threat actor, A.R., uses a front company to procure infrastructure for operationalizing\ntheir crimeware campaign. This campaign uses a variety of political and government-related\nthemes in their icons and decoys. The infection chains utilized by the actor are simple and\nconsist of delivering commodity RATs such as dcRAT, Quasar and AndroRAT to their victims.\nTheir use of custom downloaders for delivery, file enumerators for reconnaissance, and\ninfectors to weaponize benign documents indicates attempts at aggressive proliferation.\nThese tools also indicate that the threat actor is actively pursuing creating bespoke tools to\nshift away from commodity malware.\n\nCommodity malware is extremely popular with malware operators these days. It allows the\nattackers to focus on operational aspects of their campaigns without having to put in effort\ninto development of novel malware families. Coupled with small customized file infectors,\ngenerating straightforward infection chains enables an attacker to automate their proliferation\nefforts. Organizations should remain vigilant against such threats that are highly motivated to\nproliferate using automated mechanisms .\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
