The threat actor presents Stealc as a fully featured and ready-to-**\nuse stealer, whose development relied on Vidar, Raccoon, Mars and Redline stealers. This information suggests that this\nnewcomer could be a serious competitor to the popular widespread malware families mentioned above.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early February 2023, SEKOIA.IO identified a new malware family when tracking infrastructures distributing information\nstealers. The Command and Control (C2) communications of the associated samples share similarities with those of Vidar and\nRaccoon. Further analysis by SEKOIA.IO allowed us to associate this new malware family with Stealc.\n\nThe investigation led us to discover several dozens of Stealc samples distributed in the wild, and more than 40 Stealc C2 servers,\ncertainly an indication that this new infostealer became widespread and popular among cybercriminals distributing stealers.\nSEKOIA.IO therefore conducted an in-depth analysis of this emerging threat.\n\nThis blog post aims at presenting the activities of the Stealc’s alleged developer, a technical analysis of the malware and its C2\ncommunications, and how to track it. We also share details on Stealc capabilities (Annex 1) and an infection chain distributing it\n(Annex 2).\n\n[In a follow-up blog post, we will share a write-up on the reverse engineering of Stealc to take a look at the different techniques](https://blog.sekoia.io/stealc-a-copycat-of-vidar-and-raccoon-infostealers-gaining-in-popularity-part-2/)\nimplemented by the malware.\n\n## A successful entry into the cybercrime market\n\n### First Stealc advertisement\n\nOn 9 January, 2023, Plymouth advertised the Stealc information stealer for the first time on XSS and BHF Russians-speaking\nunderground forums. The threat actor published a detailed description of the new malware to list its wide stealing capabilities, the\nfully featured and well designed administration panel, and some technical characteristics.\n\nFigure 1. Advertisement for Stealc stealer on XSS, published by Plymouth on 9 January, 2023\nBy default, Stealc targets sensitive data from most used web browsers, browser extensions for cryptocurrency wallets,\n**desktop cryptocurrency wallets and information from additional applications, including email client and messenger software.**\nCompared to other stealers SEKOIA.IO analysed, the data collection configuration can be customised to tailor the malware to the\ncustomer needs.\n\nStealc also implements a customisable file grabber, allowing its customers to steal files matching their grabber rules. The stealer\nalso has loader capabilities that would be usually expected for an information stealer sold as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS). A\ncomplete list of Stealc capabilities is shared in Annex 1.\n\nThe administration panel is also fully featured and allows its users (i.e. threat actors distributing the stealer), to:\n\nset up the malware configuration;\nparse, display, filter, sort and analyse the stolen data;\n\n\n-----\n\ndownload the logs (stolen data) with several options.\n\nSEKOIA.IO observed that logs handling is a key feature for all information stealers entering the MaaS market. Threat actors\nare likely to sell the stolen data on logs marketplace and therefore need to download it in a personalised way. In addition, they\nneed to identify and extract the valuable credentials and files from the large amounts of collected data. Thus, we assess\n_Plymouth, the Stealc presumed developer, almost certainly dedicated a great effort to develop the administration panel on_\n**sorting and downloading logs features.**\n\n### Plymouth’s activity carried out in a professional manner\n\nAfter the first publication on 9 January, 2023 on XSS and BHF, Plymouth continued to advertise its infostealer to reach a larger\naudience on additional channels, including Exploit hacking forum and Telegram messaging application.\n\nTo gain the trust of potential customers, developers often offer free malware tests to cybercrime forum users to collect\nreviews and possibly positive feedback on their product. This is considered as a guarantee of quality, similarly to a Bitcoin\n**deposit on a cybercrime forum. On some forums, it is even required to make a deposit or have relevant feedback from an**\nadministrator, moderator or experienced user to sell a product or service.\n\nAs shown in the following figure, Plymouth fulfils both: a 0.02 Bitcoin deposit (around $400 at the time of deposit), and free weekly\ntests offered to XSS users. We assess with high confidence that its alleged developer quickly established itself as a reliable threat\nactor, and its malware gained the trust of cybercriminals dealing with infostealers.\n\nFigure 2. Plymouth’s post offering Stealc\n\nfree weekly tests, Plymouth’s profile indicates a deposit of 0.02 Bitcoin on XSS forum (translated from Russian)\nIn addition, Plymouth released several versions of Stealc and published changelogs on different forums, as well as on a dedicated\nTelegram channel (hxxps://t[.]me/stealc_changelog). The changelogs introduce new features and bug fixes. Main changes for each\nrelease are listed in the following figure.\n\nFigure 3. Timeline of Stealc releases and Plymouth’s activities\n_Plymouth’s publications and observed activities indicate that Stealc is under ongoing development with new features added on a_\nweekly basis. While the stealer is already functional and adopted by several threat actors, the developer continues to improve both\nmalware and administration panels, likely to expand its customer base.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nBefore analysing Stealc’s execution process and C2 communications, we present how we associate the new malware family with\nthe malware advertised by Stealc.\n\n### Malware sample association\n\nIn early February 2023, SEKOIA.IO analysts found a sample of an unknown malware by investigating an infrastructure typically\nused to distribute stealers (SHA256: a2465fc5059ea57c7b64b1dc01caf8735422a005ddb7fabeddfa3cbc89085ccf,\n[https://tria.ge/230212-pkc69adh37). The sample execution raises two specific characteristics:](https://tria.ge/230212-pkc69adh37/behavioral2)\n\nThe download of a legitimate third-party DLLs, already observed being abused by stealers (sqlite3.dll, freebl3.dll, mozglue.dll,\n_msvcp40.dll, nss3.dll, softokn3.dll and vcruntime140.dll);_\nThe execution of a command deleting all DLLs in C:\\ProgramData.\n\nFrom these behaviours, we pivoted on dozens of samples that appear to belong to the same malware family using the following\nquery on VirusTotal:\n```\nbehaviour:\"C:\\ProgramData\\*.dll\" behaviour:\"timeout /t 5\" behaviour:\"sqlite3.dll\"\n\n```\nFigure 4. Search on specific behaviours of the malware sample on VirusTotal yielding to packed and unpacked samples\nThe results returned standalone samples of about 80KB (SHA256:\n77d6f1914af6caf909fa2a246fcec05f500f79dd56e5d0d466d55924695c702d), we analysed it in depth to corroborate the\nassociation of this new malware family to Stealc. Here is a summary of the association of Stealc features as advertised by\n_Plymouth and sample features observed by SEKOIA.IO._\n\n\n**Stealc features, as described by Plymouth on**\n**XSS**\n\n_When developing our solution, we relied on Vidar,_\n_Raccoon, Mars and RedLine_\n\n\n**SEKOIA.IO observations based on samples of the new malware**\n**family**\n\nStealc, Vidar, Raccoon and Mars all download legitimate third-party DLLs\n(sqlite3.dll, nss3.dll, etc.), as the found sample.\n\n\n_Current build weight – 78kb_ The standalone sample is approximately 80KB.\n\n_stealc was written in pure C using WinAPI_ C written malware uses WinAPI functions.\n\n_all functions are dynamically loaded_ Once the strings are deobfuscated, the malware loads the WinAPI\nfunctions using GetProcAddress and LoadLibraryA.\n\n\n_import table is taken by couple of imports from_\n_mscrt_\n\n\nThe import address table imports 6 functions from MsvcrtDLL.\n\n\n-----\n\n_All lines of work are obfuscated._ All strings are obfuscated using RC4 and base64, except a few ones\nwhich are related to new features (update v1.1.2).\n\n\n_stealc does not generate an archive on the client_\n_side, each file to be collected is sent to the server in_\n_a separate request_\n\n\nThe malware exfiltrates the collected data file by file and doesn’t wait to\nreceive all configuration to collect and send data.\n\n\n_more than 23 supported browsers_ Based on the configuration sent by the C2, the malware targets 22\nbrowsers.\n\n_more than 70 web plugins_ Based on the configuration sent by C2, Stealc targets 75 plugins.\n\n_more than 15 desktop wallets_ Based on the configuration sent by C2, Stealc targets 25 wallets.\n\n_email clients_ The sample collects data from Outlook files (\\Outlook\\accounts.txt), the\nconfiguration is stored in the obfuscated data.\n\n\n_added random name generation for script-gate_\n_(api.php), in stealc update v1.1.2_\n\n_recorded user-agents in the system_info.txt file, in_\n_stealc update v1.1.2_\n\n_recorded ip and country in file system_info.txt, in_\n_stealc update v1.1.2_\n\n\nThe first samples communicated on /api.php and downloaded the DLLs\nfrom /libs/. Recent samples used random paths ([a-f0-9]{16}) for data\nexfiltration and DLL download.\n\nThe malware exfiltrates victim host’s user agents.\n\nIP address and country of the infected host (ISO) are exfiltrated to the C2.\n\n\nTable 1. SEKOIA.IO observations on the advertised Stealc features and collected samples\nBased on this comparative table, SEKOIA.IO analysts assess this new malware family found in the wild matches Stealc infostealer\nwith high confidence.\n\n### Technical overview of Stealc sample\n\nSEKOIA.IO reverse engineered Stealc and will publish an in-depth analysis to share further details. In the meantime, here is an\noverview of the main steps of Stealc execution.\n\nOnce executed, Stealc deobfuscates all its RC4-encrypted and base64-encoded strings. It then compares the system date to\nthe hardcoded date in the obfuscated strings. If the execution occurs after the hardcoded date, the malware stops. This check is\nlikely implemented by the stealer developer to limit the customer’s activity to the licence validity period.\n\nStealc also checks for virtual or sandbox environments by comparing the machine name to HAL9TH and the user name to\n_JohnDoe, solely used by Microsoft Defender emulator._\n\nThe malware dynamically loads the different WinAPI functions using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, and initiates the\ncommunication to its C2 server. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the malware communication:\n\n1. Stealc first sends the victim’s host HWID (Hardware Identifier) and build name to its C2 server, using a POST request on the\n\nserver gate (name=”hwid”, name=”build”). The server responds with the base64-encoded configuration, such as:\n```\n d325580bb149e327a7c8338ec6c9ac7227e7c319411261441d8d3097b2a2d6e5fef3ce48|isdone|docia.docx|\n 1|1|0|1|1|1|1|1|\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Stealc C2 communication, first POST request to send the victim host HWID and build name\n\n1. The malware sends the command browsers to the C2 to retrieve its configuration for data collection from web browsers,\n\nusing a POST request on the server gate (name=”token”, name=”message” (browsers)). Again, the server responds with the\nbase64-encoded configuration, such as:\n```\n Google Chrome|\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data|chrome|Google Chrome Canary|\\Google\\Chrome SxS\\User\n Data|chrome|Chromium|\\Chromium\\User Data|chrome|Amigo|\\Amigo\\User Data|chrome|Torch|\\Torch\\User\n Data|chrome|Vivaldi|\\Vivaldi\\User Data|chrome|Comodo Dragon|\\Comodo\\Dragon\\User\n Data|chrome|EpicPrivacyBrowser|\\Epic Privacy Browser\\User Data|chrome|CocCoc|\\CocCoc\\Browser\\User\n Data|chrome|Brave|\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\User Data|chrome|Cent Browser|\\CentBrowser\\User\n Data|chrome|7Star|\\7Star\\7Star\\User Data|chrome|Chedot Browser|\\Chedot\\User Data|chrome|Microsoft\n Edge|\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data|chrome|360 Browser|\\360Browser\\Browser\\User\n Data|chrome|QQBrowser|\\Tencent\\QQBrowser\\User Data|chrome|CryptoTab|\\CryptoTab Browser\\User\n Data|chrome|Opera Stable|\\Opera Software|opera|Opera GX Stable|\\Opera Software|opera|Mozilla\n Firefox|\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles|firefox|Pale Moon|\\Moonchild Productions\\Pale Moon\\Profiles|firefox|Opera\n Crypto Stable|\\Opera Software|opera|Thunderbird|\\Thunderbird\\Profiles|firefox|\n\n```\nFigure 6. Stealc C2 communication, second POST request to get the data collection configuration for web browsers\n\n1. Using the same format, it sends the command plugins to the C2 to retrieve its configuration for data collection from web\n\n**browser extensions, using a POST request on the server gate (name=”token”, name=”message” (plugins)). The server**\nresponds with the base64-encoded configuration, such as:\n```\n MetaMask|djclckkglechooblngghdinmeemkbgci|1|0|0|MetaMask|ejbalbakoplchlghecdalmeeeajnimhm|1|0|0|\n MetaMask|nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn|1|0|0|TronLink|ibnejdfjmmkpcnlpebklmnkoeoihofec|1|0|0|\n Binance Wallet|fhbohimaelbohpjbbldcngcnapndodjp|1|0|0|Yoroi|ffnbelfdoeiohenkjibnmadjiehjhajb|1|0|0|\n Coinbase Wallet extension|hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad|1|0|1|Guarda|\n hpglfhgfnhbgpjdenjgmdgoeiappafln|1|0|0|(redacted)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n1. Stealc exfiltrates fingerprint data of the infected host, using a POST request on the server gate (name _token,_\n_name=”file_name”, name=”file”). The file is named system_info.txt and includes information on network, system summary,_\nuser agents, installed apps and process list.\n\n2. It downloads 7 legitimate third-party DLLs from the C2 server, using GET requests, in the following order:\n\n_sqlite3.dll_\n_freebl3.dll_\n_mozglue.dll_\n_msvcp40.dll_\n_nss3.dll_\n_softokn3.dll_\n_vcruntime140.dll_\n\n3. Stealc exfiltrates files one by one, using POST requests on the server gate (name=”token”, name=”file_name”,\n\n_name=”file”). Files collected and exfiltrated by the malware correspond to those defined in the received configuration, such as_\n(for a victim host having Mozilla Firefox installed):\n\n_history\\Mozilla Firefox_*.default-release.txt_\n_autofill\\Mozilla Firefox_*.default-release.txt_\n_cookies\\Mozilla Firefox_*.default-release.txt_\n\n4. It sends the command wallets to the C2 to retrieve its configuration for data collection from desktop cryptocurrency\n\n**wallets, using a POST request on the server gate (name=”token”, name=”message” (wallets)). Again, the server responds**\nwith the base64-encoded configuration, such as:\n```\n Bitcoin Core|\\Bitcoin\\wallets\\|wallet.dat|1|Bitcoin Core\n Old|\\Bitcoin\\|*wallet*.dat|0|Dogecoin|\\Dogecoin\\|*wallet*.dat|0|Raven Core|\\Raven\\|*wallet*.dat|0|Daedalus\n Mainnet|\\Daedalus Mainnet\\wallets\\|she*.sqlite|0|Blockstream Green|\\Blockstream\\Green\\wallets\\|*.*|1|Wasabi\n Wallet|\\WalletWasabi\\Client\\Wallets\\|*.json|0|Ethereum|\\Ethereum\\|keystore|0|Electrum|\\Electrum\\wallets\\|*.*|0|\n (redacted)\n\n```\n1. It also sends the command files to the C2 to retrieve its configuration for the file grabber, using a POST request on the\n\nserver gate (name=”token”, name=”message” (files)). The server responds with the base64-encoded configuration, such as:\n```\n DESKTOP|%DESKTOP%\\|*.txt|15|1|0|Doki|%DOCUMENTS%\\|*.txt|15|1|0|\n\n```\n1. Again, it exfiltrates the collected data using the same pattern as previously described in step 6 (name=”token”,\n\n_name=”file_name”, name=”file”). With the previous configuration, the file files\\DESKTOP\\SwitchSearch.txt is collected and_\nexfiltrated by the malware.\n\n2. Finally, Stealc obfuscated data includes the file path or the Windows Registry key related to sensitive data of Discord,\n\n**Telegram, Tox, Outlook and Steam. The malware gathers the targeted files and exfiltrates then with the same pattern as**\ndescribed before.\n\n3. Once the malware finishes retrieving all configurations and exfiltrating collected data, it sends the command done using a\n\nPOST request on the server gate (name=”token”, name=”message” (done)).\n\nStealc C2 communications are verbose when the infected host has multiple web browsers, extensions, desktop wallets or files\nmatching the collection configuration.\n\nOnce the data collection process is done, the malware removes itself and the downloaded DLL files from the compromised host by\nexecuting the following command:\n```\n cmd.exe /c timeout /t 5 & del /f /q \"$STEALERPATH\" & del \"C:\\ProgramData\\*.dll\" & exit\n\n## Tracking Stealc in its many forms\n\n### Standalone samples\n\n```\nAn efficient way to detect the Stealc standalone samples consists in writing a YARA rule on the specific strings which are not\nobfuscated (those which were added in the v1.2.0 Stealc release).\n\nFor this purpose, we compare the common strings embedded in all the Stealc standalone samples. Here are the characteristic\nstrings included in all standalone samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n ASCII: ------      paddr: 69704, 69726\n ASCII: \\..\\     paddr: 69844\n ASCII: block      paddr: 69856\n ASCII: Network Info:      paddr: 69864\n ASCII: - IP: IP?      paddr: 69881\n ASCII: - Country: ISO?     paddr: 69893\n ASCII: - Display Resolution:      paddr: 69913\n ASCII: User Agents:     paddr: 69936\n\n```\nWe can also sign the malware function that loops over the obfuscated strings to deobfuscate them. A YARA rule based on both\nmethods is shared in IoCs & Technical Details.\n\n### Packed samples\n\nYARA signatures based on the malware strings or functions are not efficient when the sample is packed using a commercial\npacker, a custom loader, embedded in a shellcode, or else. In that scenario, dynamic detection is a valid option.\n\nTo this end, we can use a YARA rule for VirusTotal Livehunt to detect the specific commands executed by Stealc or the specific C2\ncommunications, including:\n```\n /c timeout /t 5\n del /f /q \"%SAMPLEPATH%\"\n del \"%ProgramData%\\*.dll\"\"\n /sqlite3.dll\n .php\n\n```\nAs we did above to pivot on this malware family, we can correlate these specific behaviours in a YARA rule using VirusTotal\nLivehunt. A YARA rule is shared in IoCs & Technical Details.\n\n## C2 servers\n\nTracking the Stealc C2 servers can be done using the HTTP and HTML default responses which seem to be characteristic. Most of\nthe scanned C2 servers responds an HTTP 200 status code with an HTML page containing a “404 Forbidden” Apache server on\nthe port 80, as shown below:\n```\n HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n Date: <REDACTED>\n Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)\n Vary: Accept-Encoding\n Content-Length: 145\n Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n <html> <head><title>404 Forbidden</title></head> <body> <center><h1>404 Forbidden</h1></center> <hr>\n <center>apache</center> </body> </html>\n\n```\nTo confirm that a server matching this specific HTML response and an HTTP 200 status code corresponds to a Stealc C2 server,\nwe can scan some URIs opened on Stealc servers, such as “/modules/” and “/index.php/”.\n\nAt the time of writing, SEKOIA.IO found 35 active servers associated with Stealc C2 with high confidence (listed below in IoCs &\nTechnical Details), and more than 40 Stealc samples.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStealc is another fully featured infostealer sold as a MaaS which emerged on underground forums in early 2023. Plymouth\ndrew on the today’s trendy infostealers on the market (Vidar, [Raccoon, Redline and Mars) to develop a malware that quickly](https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-1-the-return-of-the-dead/)\nbecame popular among Russian-speaking cybercriminals.\n\nSince customers of the Stealc MaaS own a build of its administration panel to host the stealer C2 server and generate stealer\nsamples themselves, it is likely that the build will leak into the underground communities in the medium term. For that matter\nSEKOIA.IO further assess the Plymouth business possibly will not be viable over several years, as Vidar or Raccoon projects\nare. However, it is likely that a cracked version of the Stealc build may be released in the future which may be used for many\nyears to come.\n\nHowever, we expect that the Stealc infostealer will become widespread in the near term, as multiple threat actors add the\nmalware to their arsenal while it is poorly monitored Companies facing stealer compromise need to be aware of this malware\n\n\n-----\n\nTo provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA.IO analysts will continue to monitor emerging and prevalent\ninfostealers, including Stealc.\n\n## Annex\n\n###

steps:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Cracked software catalogue website (rcc-software[.]com) luring the user to download Stealc sample\n\n1. YouTube videos on stolen accounts describing how to install a cracked software for free and providing a link (hxxps://rcc\n_software[.]com/services);_\n2. From the link provided in the YouTube video, the victim can access a “cracked software catalogue” website;\n3. The payload embeds Stealc infostealer. The user downloads it, decompresses the archive using the password 55555 and\n\nexecutes the file “setup.exe” (hxxps://streetlifegaming[.]com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pass_55555_Setup.rar);\n[4.
