Probably not, but if your machine is\ninfected with ChromeLoader, you might not have a choice.\n\nAs its name suggests, ChromeLoader’s goal is to compromise popular browsers like Google Chrome, and alter the victim’s browser settings\nto direct traffic to dubious advertising websites. It can even conduct browser hijacking to compromise the user’s password and login\ninformation.\n\nChromeLoader has been rapidly evolving ever since appearing back in January of this year, with the malware boasting a wide range of\nvariants that have been discovered in-the-wild in recent months. In newer examples of ChromeLoader, we’ve observed that the malware has\nadditionally begun to focus on ‘click fraud’, an internet-focused type of scam that forces users to visit unwanted sites to generate revenue\nfrom pay-per-click online advertising.\n\nAs we head into the winter of 2022, ChromeLoader is showing no signs of stopping or slowing the orchestration of multiple malicious\ncampaigns across both Windows® and macOS® operating systems alike. In this blog post, we’ll examine how it operates.\n\n### Operating System\n\n Risk & Impact\n\n ChromeLoader Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nC o e oade s a u t staged a a e des g ed to co p o se te et b o se s e t eat acto s be d t ut e a s g ca t u be\nof initial infection vectors, and the malware’s variants target both macOS and Windows.\n\nEarly versions of the malware focused on account and credential compromise. However, more recent renditions of the malware are stealthier\nin deployment, and possess additional methods to conduct fraud and adware redirection.\n\nChromeLoader initially used PowerShell for its Windows-based variants and Bash for its macOS variants, but has since moved to JavaScript\nfor its Windows malware.\n\nThough the abilities of the malware can cause considerable collateral damage, it’s the potential secondary and tertiary actions following\ninfection that can make it so damaging.\n\n### ChromeLoader Version History\n\n**Windows**\n\nInitial versions of ChromeLoader used Auto Hotkey (AHK) compiled executables and a Chrome extension in the earliest known forms of the\nmalware.\n\n_Figure 1: AHK script found in resources of ChromeLoader v1.0_\n\nIt was widely reported in January 2022 that Chromeloader used versions 2.0-4.4 of the Chrome extension as its payload, and dropped an\nobfuscated PowerShell executable.\n\nHere’s an example of the Trojanised executables used:\n\nCSinstaller.exe\nDownload.exe\n\nThis variant of ChromeLoader’s execution starting point is an ISO file, which consists of two components. The meta.txt file contains an\nencrypted PowerShell script that uses a substitution cipher. The downloader.exe is a .NET executable.\n\nThe .NET code that describes how this executable file functions is provided below:\n\n_Figure 2: .NET code related to PowerShell execution_\n\nUpon execution of download.exe, the victim will see an error message warning of an incompatible OS, as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: The initial Trojan gives an execution error. However, the malware is now running in the background._\n\nThis is intended as a decoy for the victim, lulling them into a false sense of security by leading them to believe that there was an issue with\nthe software or tool they just downloaded. However, this is definitely not the case, as the malware is now covertly running in the background.\n\nAt this stage of infection, ChromeLoader gets busy executing a malicious Base64 encoded PowerShell command.\n\n_Figure 4: Execution of PowerShell relating to ChromeLoader_\n\nAs an example, the %download.exe% snippet containing a dictionary from Dnspy is shown below. We see it here utilizing a substitution\ncipher.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Data Dictionary utilized for substitution cipher_\n\nIt uses this hard-coded dictionary of substitution letters to decrypt the PowerShell script in meta.txt. The Chrome extension %archive.zip% is\ndownloaded from a compromised malware server by the decrypted PowerShell script and installed discreetly onto the victim’s device.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Decryption of cipher using CyberChef_\n\nOnce added to the device’s internet browser, this malicious Chrome extension hijacks the browser and modifies search engine results that\nare returned to the user.\n\nThe final payload of this malware is a unique browser extension. When later activated (in another version seen from February to April), it uses\nthe 6.0 version of the Chrome extension. Its initial dropper is an obfuscated executable.\n\nExamples of Trojanised executables used:\n\nTone.exe\nBloom.exe\nEnergy.exe\n\nThis variant is the same as the one shown above. An ISO file containing a new executable serves as the starting point for the execution of\nthis ChromeLoader variant.\n\nOnly the Windows shortcut (.lnk file) is visible to the user. The .lnk file runs a batch script named %resources.bat%.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Link file to ChromeLoader’s %resource.bat% file_\n\nThe following shows the content of the .bat file:\n\n_Figure 8: Contents of %resource.bat% showing registry adds to %CurrentVersion\\Run%_\n\nThe script extracts the contents of the app.zip file into the user's %AppData% folder.\n\nThe zip archive contains an executable file named Tone.exe, which is stored in a registry key by the batch script, making the infection\npersistent. The rest is identical to the initial variants, including the installed Chrome extension.\n\n**Latest Version**\n\nChromeLoader has been consistently active in recent months, with its Windows variant utilizing JavaScript over PowerShell. This latest\nvariant became widely active between August and September, using random applications like:\n\nFLBmusic.exe\nCash.exe\nOpensubtitles-uploader.exe\n\nThe example utilized in this instance is flbmusic, whose execution begins with extracting the ISO file and dropping configurations.bat, Install,\nconf.ico and files.zip, which require unzipping and contains the flbmusic.exe, along with other files shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Contents of ISO_\n\nThe %\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run% attribute appears in all the application .bat file content, indicating that it was inserted for persistence\nafter the application was executed.\n\nThe contents of the.bat files for the various applications utilized are as follows:\n\n**Flbmusic.exe**\n\n_Figure 10: FlbMusic %configurations.bat% script_\n\n**Opensubtitles-upoader.exe**\n\n_Figure 11: Opensubtitles-uploader.exe %properties.bat% script_\n\n**Energy.exe**\n\n_Figure 12: Energy.exe %resource.bat% script_\n\nStatic analysis of an FLB music sample revealed that it contains the PDB path electron.exe.pdb, indicating that Electron was used.\n\n_Figure 13: PDB Path suggests the utilization of Electron_\n\nElectron is a framework for building native desktop applications using web technologies such as JavaScript. It allows you to distribute web\napplications packaged together with their own instance of the Chromium browser, just like NodeJS, but with better access to the operating\nsystem of the client.\n\nThe problem with applications built with JavaScript is that it makes tampering with the source code remarkably simple. Any applicationspecific or proprietary code is likely to reside in the /resources subdirectory, not the root directory.\n\nFor example: Flbmusic/resources\n\nIn Electron, source code files are archived in a tar-like format in a subdirectory called app.asar to avoid exposing the source code. Here is\nwhat we found when we unpacked the archive named app.asar.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Extracted path of FlbMusic_\n\n**MacOS**\n\nChromeLoader malware started targeting Mac users during March 2022, when it infected them by directing them to an infected pay-perdownload website.\n\nThe dropper consists of a disk image (DMG) file containing several files, including a script written in bash. There are several similarities\nbetween the bash script and the scheduled PowerShell script. It downloads the payload and then loads it into the target's browser.\n\n**ChromeLoader Execution Chain**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: Chromeloader execution chain_\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Tactics & Techniques\n\n\n-----\n\n**Use** **ecut o** **a c ous** C o e oade s o te osted o co p o sed ebs tes o t oug a c ous s s eads to use\nexecution though these links. (MITRE ATT&CK® tactic [T1204.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/)\n\n**User Execution: Malicious File: The malware will often appear as a legitimate tool or application, leading to the victim executing the**\nmalware unknowingly. (MITRE ATT&CK tactic [T1204.002)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/)\n\n**Command and Script Interpreter: Once on a victim device, many iterations of ChromeLoader will use JavaScript or PowerShell to achieve**\nits malicious goals. (MITRE ATT&CK tactic [T1059)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)\n\n**Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task: A persistence mechanism used by ChromeLoader is to implement a scheduled task to maintain a**\nfoothold on the system. (MITRE ATT&CK tactic [T1053.005)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)\n\n**Modify Registry: The malware across all iterations will add itself to the %CurrentRun% Registry to allow itself to re-execute and survive**\nreboots and shutdowns. (MITRE ATT&CK tactic [T1112)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\n\n**Browser Extensions: ChromeLoader is rather unconventional when it comes to its attack vector, relying on the abuse of browser extensions**\nto conduct its malicious means. (MITRE ATT&CK tactic [T1176)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176/)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChromeLoader is a multi-stage malware with a wide distribution vector. Each iteration contains more advanced obfuscation to thwart analysis\nand deceive automation sandboxes, with an end-goal of deploying Trojanised browser extensions.\n\nChromeLoader can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, with the malware family experiencing significant changes and evolutions as\nobserved by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team in the past few months alone.\n\nThe malware often hijacks the victim’s browser and can, in turn, also redirect the victim to unwanted websites. Furthermore, the malware in\nsome variants can compromise the security of a victim’s internet browser, leading to sensitive information like passwords and credentials\n(both personal and corporate) being exposed to the malware and extracted for secondary gains.\n\nBrowser extensions are often overlooked in the context of enterprise security, something the threat actors behind ChromeLoader attempt to\nexploit.\n\nRegardless of the scale of an organisation both large or small, ignoring the risk of rogue browser extensions can come with a hefty price-tag.\nOften, the accidental installation of Trojan browser extensions can lead to the compromise of the user’s device, and provide access to\nsecondary payloads used for credential stealing or other malicious activities.\n\n[Other commodity malware often sold as-a-service, for example, RedLine Infostealer, can be weaponised as a secondary payload for such](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/10/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer-update)\nmalware. RedLine and others like it are often used as precursors to a full-scale ransomware attack, where credentials are stolen via the\nmethods outlined above, and later offered up on underground forums to the highest bidder to obtain access to an organization. Ultimately\nwithout adequate endpoint protection, when one cybersecurity domino falls, they all fall.\n\n### Who is Affected?\n\nChromeLoader does not have any evident specific target(s), often relying on a lack of cybersecurity awareness and the digital ethnicity of an\nindividual to achieve its goals, rather than having a specifically targeted campaign or targeted organization.\n\nThe malware has also been noted to appear on corporate systems due to the sheer scale of its malware campaigns, and also due to its\nattack vector of unconventional means, limiting its use of the traditional Windows Portable Executable (PE).\n\nAdditionally, the malware targets the macOS operating system with one noted variant, increasing the attack surface of the malware family\nbeyond the realms of just Windows-based devices.\n\nNoted areas of compromise/focus:\n\nEducation\nCivil Service\nFinancial\n\n### Mitigation Tips\n\n**File Hashing: Deploying a hashing detection on a device can be an effective way of blocking/quarantining this malware if it appears on a**\n[device.
