A couple of these can be\nhelped enormously by “Infra-Tagging”. It’s a new term so just go with it for now while I\nexplain.\n\nThe problem: I’m looking at a bunch of domains and want to see how they are related.\nThere are many different ways to do this and each involves numerous look-ups and then\nsaving the results to compare them.\n\nThis is where Infra Tagging steps in. We just do one API call for each domain to generate\nan Infra-tag. The tag will be of the form {mx.ns.as.reg} where MX= the domain portion of the\nfirst mail exchange record in DNS, NS= the domain portion of the top last seen Name\nServer, AS= the AS name of the assigned IP address of the A record, Reg- the registrar\nmentioned in Whois if available. If any field is unavailable it is replaced with a _.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis results in something like the below\n\nExample 1\n\nAPI\n\nhttps://api.silentpush.com/api/v1/merge-api/explore/domain/infratag/zicanotes[.]com\n\nResult\n\n\"tag\": \"_:dns.com:cnservers:key-systemsgmbh\"\n\nExample 2\n\nSo lets try this for a particular bunch of domains from a related campaign.\n\n\"domain\": \"dimetriadit[.]top\", \"tag\": \"_:cloudflare.com:hz:porkbunllc\"\n\n\"domain\": \"glooverdoover[.]top\", \"tag\": \"porkbun.com:cloudflare.com:hz:porkbunllc\"\n\n\"domain\": \"sillkolo[.]space\", \"tag\": \"porkbun.com:cloudflare.com:hz:_\"\n\n\"domain\": \"woodabeg[.]fun\", \"tag\": \"porkbun.com:cloudflare.com:hz:porkbunllc\"\n\nThese domains are related to IcedID infrastructure\n\nHaving this tag alongside each domain in your security tools is very useful as any analyst\nhas a chance of being able to spot trends with a glance.\n\nHowever there are even greater advantages such as being able to search for tags in data.\nThat means we can do this in a couple of places.\n\n1. Search for similar tags in threat feeds and see which items may be related.\n\n2. Search in Passive/Active DNS to see what else is out there with the same Infra-Tag\n\nand similar\n\nWould you like to use our Infra-Tags API? Would you like to help us make tools like this for\nyou.\n\nPlease contact us to join our Beta program.\n\nName\n*\nThank you!\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
