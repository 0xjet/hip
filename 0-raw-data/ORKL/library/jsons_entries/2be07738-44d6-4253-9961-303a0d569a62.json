Threat Intelligence\n\n Unwrapping ‘Understand’\n\n Challenge\n\n New threats emerge, and it is challenging for most organizations to proactively scan, assess and understand the many issues and dynamic risks that impact their business. It is also hard to objectively identify own weaknesses, and thereby define and operationalize own risk appetite.\n\n Organizations needs to increase their situational awareness – from yearly transitioning to daily\n\n Why is it needed\n\n • Reduce time to detect and respond to cyber incidents by massively expanding monitoring coverage of IT infrastructure\n  Focus on endpoint monitoring and response to increase radius of action\n  Fully adopt real-time analytics in monitoring\n  Obtain deeper visibility in partner compliance (e.g. via monitoring)\n\n\n###### Understand your business\n • Crown jewels\n\n Core components\n • Threat Intelligence\n • Risk Analytics\n • Business impact analysis\n (Crown Jewels)\n • Vulnerability assessments\n • Actualized Risk appetite\n reporting\n\n Threat Landscape\n • Who might attack?\n • What are they after?\n • What tactics will they\n use?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What is Threat Intelligence?\n\n Threat intelligence is actionable knowledge and insight on adversaries and their malicious activities enabling defenders and their organizations to reduce risks through better security decision-making.\n\n (From Sergio Caltagirone)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • Who adversaries are\n\n • What adversaries use\n\n • Where adversaries target\n\n • When adversaries act\n\n • Why adversaries attack\n\n • How adversaries operate\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat intelligence is not a feed of observables such as IP addresses, domains or hashes\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### GENESIS: How is Cyber Threat Intelligence Created?\n\n\n###### Threat Intelligence Production Lifecycle\n\n\n###### Dissemination\n Activities associated with the distribution,\n integration and sharing of intelligence products with the appropriate teams and/or\n technologies to be actioned accordingly\n\n Production\n\n Activities associated with the generation of intelligence products and outputs [e.g.\n threat advisories, intelligence feeds]\n\n\n###### Planning & Direction\n\n Activities associated with mapping of business risks to threats and creating PIRs & IRs to set the direction for collections activities\n\n Collection & Triage\n\n Activities associated with monitoring of data and intelligence sources for relevant threats and triage of the information collected\n\n\n###### 5\n\n 1\n\n 4\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n\n###### Analysis\n\n Activities associated with the analysis of information about threats, assessment of associated risks and development of courses of action to protect against the threats and mitigate\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Defining Intelligence Requirements and Risks\n\n|Commander’s Critical Information Requirements|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|PIR|SIR|EEI|\n|Which adverseries target naval industry?|Which TTPs are leveraged by Temp.PERISCOPE against targets?|How does the actor perform reconnaisance?|\n|||Which techniques are used in spear phishing emails?|\n|||Which implants are utilized by the actors?|\n|||Which tactics does the actor use post- compromise?|\n|||Which NBI is current depoyed by the actor?|\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nGET /templater.hta HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1;\nTrident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR\n3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nHost: www.thyssenkrupp-marinesystems.org\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### P\n I V O\n T\n I N G\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### \"[Green] pid=%d tid=%d modulePath=%s|\"\n\n\n###### Interesting… we will get back to this\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Tying it together\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TEMP.PERISCOPE\n\n State-sponsored, mission-driven adversary conducting espionage activities to fulfil predefined EEIs\n\n DIAMOND\n INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n Various VPS providers\n\n VICTOMOLOGY\n\n Nexus of CDCs, Universities, Aerospace as well as Engineering, Chemical, Government, Shipping Sectors\n\n\n###### TEMP.PERISCOPE\n\n DIAMOND\n MODEL\n\n VICTOMOLOGY\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### What is?

Intelligence-driven incident response\n\n Unwrapping ‘Control’\n\n Challenge\n\n When a crisis occurs, the executive response is highly scrutinized and must be rapid, coordinated and precise. Information is imperfect, things escalate quickly, and mistakes are very costly to the reputation of the company – and increasingly to its leaders.\n\n What is needed? Acting quickly and in control takes decisiveness:\n • Mobilize crisis management team and support\n • Decide your strategic intent\n • Find necessary information\n • Formulate position and key message\n • Contain the situation\n • Communicate with internal and external\n stakeholders\n • Evaluate continuously.\n\n Core components\n\n • Executive coaching, advice\n and 2[nd] opinion\n • (Cyber) incident response\n • Forensics & intelligence\n • Crisis communication\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What is?

SAF-T, eAudit and real-time reporting\n\n • Electronic transfer of large datasets to tax authorities.\n • Move towards real-time reporting with daily or monthly submissions of\n 100+ data points, including e-invoicing.\n • Covers multiple areas, including GL, AP, AR, FA, cash, and journal data.\n\n 2. Making Tax Digital\n\n • From April 2019, the UK VAT return should be digitally submitted\n to HMRC via an API, with digital links between systems involved in the VAT return process, including ERP systems.\n • Other taxes to follow after VAT.\n\n 3. US Tax Reform\n\n • US Tax Reform impacting global organisations with a US footprint\n mean additional compliance requirements and potential impact on system set-up. Also consider impact of Wayfair decision on local nexus\n\n 4. SAP S/4 HANA and tax solutions\n\n • Organisations to move from ECC/ERP to SAP HANA S/4\n • In addition, HANA has 4 dedicated new tax products, including a tax\n engine, an external tax reporting solution, an e-docs solution, and a data\n\n\n###### 5. VAT complexity\n\n • VAT complexity is increasing from place of supply rules across borders to the\n provision of digital services and digital invoicing.\n • Obtaining partial exemption data or calculating mixed recovery rates in\n systems is becoming increasingly more sophisticated.\n\n 6. BEPS & Country-By-Country Reporting\n\n • BEPS guidelines are designed to stop artificial movement of profits\n to low-tax jurisdictions.\n • CBCR is a reporting tool gathering financial and non-financial data\n such as revenue and tax paid, or employee numbers and business activity.\n\n 7. Operational Transfer Pricing\n\n • Parts of the BEPS agenda focus on how profits are linked to the\n underlying activity.\n • Operational TP supports real time review of prices against actual and\n forecast data.\n • Tax and finance can make joint price setting decisions for recharges. 8. Data\n\n Data is becoming more and more important for many reasons. Advances in technology and increasing legislation (e.g. GDPR) means that the importance of d t t b i d d d d i ti l ki t h t d t\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tax part of your finance transformation?\n why is it important to consider tax when implementing ERP\n\n • Ever increasing (and often system-intrusive) legislative requirements means that tax cannot be ignored when implementing finance\n transformation programmes. In addition, there are a number of reasons why tax has to be considered differently from other finance processes.  These include:\n\n • Tax spans the system – other processes are naturally grouped by business function (finance, supply chain, etc.); tax has dependencies\n across all of these areas\n\n • The number of different taxes within ‘tax’ – it cannot be viewed as a single process, but must consider a wide range of different elements\n including corporate taxes; VAT; transfer pricing; withholding taxes; employee tax reporting requirements (even where payroll is not in scope);\n\n • Getting tax right is a statutory requirement - ‘nearly right’ is not an option, there are reputational and financial penalties for non compliance and, in some jurisdictions, even criminal sanctions. BEPS Actions as well as newer requirements around eAudit and eFilings looking to increase the need for compliant systems and processes for tax (see Systems Audit below).\n\n • Cash benefits to be gained – it is our usual experience that, by providing more tax-optimised data from the system, there can be substantial\n cash savings globally to the business. This usually only requires finessing of the system design, rather than wholesale changes so does not attract a large cost – the savings are most commonly found in the jurisdictions where there is no in-country tax team and we have a checklist of accelerators to identify such savings (see Common Areas of Benefit slide).\n\n • The level of localisation required – each jurisdiction has a unique set of tax requirements – whilst these can usually be pooled into groups\n of countries with similar requirements, the amount of localisation required for tax (and standardised processes) is often underestimated and this impacts adversely on the quality of the final design that can be achieved. \n\n • Systems audit – much more systems data and information is being collected by Tax Authorities which opens up an organisation’s ERP systems\n to much more scrutiny than ever before. This includes newer global requirements around e-audit and e-filing of detailed information directly from core systems, e.g. SAF-T and iXBRL in Europe and SPED in Brazil.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tax part of your finance transformation?\n Common failures in ERP and tax\n\n System failures…\n\n • Tax determination logic: automation can still contain errors, manual leaves determination open to human error\n\n • Tax codes: often insufficient tax codes to meet reporting requirements leading to manual intervention\n\n • Reporting: standard reports often insufficient for each country\n\n • Invoicing: layout or number sequences can be incorrect\n\n • Foreign VAT: challenge to accommodate tax regimes and rules\n\n • Master Data: Fields not set-up correctly, not mandatory, not owned\n\n Other failures…\n\n • Manual Work, Duplication of Effort, Interfaces: all raise risks\n\n • Ownership: process and master data ownership not clear\n\n • Training: inadequate for tax function on tax technology, and business on tax items\n\n • Communication: not joined up approach during or after implementation\n\n • Documentation: either insufficient or too technical\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tax part of your finance transformation?\n However, the benefits of doing it right\n\n Monetary…\n\n • Global tax burden: May be improved with commercially integrated tax planning\n\n • Cash flow benefits: accuracy, timing, earlier reclaims, bad debts\n\n Data and Processes…\n\n • Data Capture: improved data capture leading to more accurate tax treatment\n\n • Transparency: transparent data allowing drill-down into details\n\n • Consistency: Effective process with data applied consistently across the organisation\n\n • Documentation: easier succession planning, and improve relations with tax authority\n\n • Reconciliation: reduced reconciliation needed e.g. Intrastats to VAT return\n\n • Pricing: difficult to get transparency and detailed data for pricing for transfer pricing purposes\n\n • Errors: Potential for high profile errors reduced\n\n Resources…\n\n • Investigations: reduced cost of compliance to respond to enquiries and/or investigations\n\n • Errors: reduces manual effort leading to reduction in cost and potential for human error\n\n • Timely and accurate: no need to rework data so can focus on value-added activities\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Tax Transformation Change in operating model: insource, outsource, operate\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tax Transformation Why tax? Why now? - trends\n\n Globalisation Companies are increasing cross-border investments to grow and diversify and they are leveraging new delivery models.\n\n Competition Lower economic growth is causing an increasing need to put capital to work and grow the top line.

The human workforce will represent a diverse cross-section of skills focused mainly on tax planning for the organization. The workplace will be more networked, devolved, mobile, team, and project-based, collaborative, real-time, and fluid than ever before.\n\n In this future, tax professionals face new demands. Critical reasoning and thinking skills, the ability to connect the dots across multiple areas, and a deep understanding of the business will become as essential as the technical tax experience they worked so hard to acquire. Done well, however, this future has the potential to be the most engaging and fulfilling in the history of a much-respected profession\n\n\n-----\n\n# Visualize your\n\n##### - Tax Technology Roadmap\n -
