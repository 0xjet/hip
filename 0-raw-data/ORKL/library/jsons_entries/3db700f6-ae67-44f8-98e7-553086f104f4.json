This new tool attempts to dupe victims into installing\nmalware that is ultimately aimed at siphoning off sensitive information from Turla’s targets.\n\nThe group has long used **[social engineering to lure unsuspecting targets into executing faux Adobe Flash Player installers. However, it doesn’t](http://www.virusradar.com/en/glossary/social-engneering)**\nrest on its laurels and continues to innovate, as shown by recent ESET research.\n\nNot only does the gang now bundle its backdoors together with a legitimate Flash Player installer but, compounding things further, it ensures that\nURLs and the IP addresses it uses appear to correspond to Adobe’s legitimate infrastructure. In so doing, the attackers essentially misuse the\nAdobe brand to trick users into downloading malware. The victims are made to believe that the only thing that they are downloading is authentic\nsoftware from adobe.com. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe campaigns, which have been leveraging the new tool since at least July 2016, bear several hallmarks associated with the group, including\nMosquito, a **[backdoor believed to be the group’s creation, and the use of IP addresses previously linked with the group. The new malicious tool](http://www.virusradar.com/en/glossary/backdoor)**\nalso shares similarities with other malware families spread by the group.\n\n## Attack vectors\n\nESET researchers have come up with several hypotheses (shown in Figure 1) for how Turla-related malware can make it onto a victim’s computer\nvia the new method of compromise. Importantly, however, it is safe to rule out a scenario involving some sort of compromise of Adobe. Turla’s\nmalware is not known to have tainted any legitimate Flash Player updates, nor is it associated with any known Adobe product vulnerabilities. The\npossibility involving a compromise of the Adobe Flash Player download website has also been practically discarded\n\n|Type your keyword...

Note that the\n\nscenario under #5 is seen as very unlikely.\n\n\nThe possible attack vectors ESET researchers considered are:\n\nA machine within the network of the victim’s organization could be hijacked so that it acts as a springboard for a local Man-in-the-Middle\n(MitM) attack. This would effectively involve on-the-fly redirection of the traffic of the targeted machine to a compromised machine on the local\nnetwork.\n\nThe attackers could also compromise the network gateway of an organization, enabling them to intercept all the incoming and outgoing traffic\nbetween that organization’s intranet and the internet.\n\nThe traffic interception could also occur at the level of internet service providers (ISPs), a tactic that – as evidenced by **recent ESET research**\n**into surveillance campaigns deploying FinFisher spyware – is not unheard of. All the known victims are located in different countries, and**\nwe identified them using at least four different ISPs.\n\nThe attackers could have used a **[Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to re-route the traffic to a server controlled by Turla, although this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking)**\ntactic would probably rather quickly set off alarm bells with Adobe or BGP monitoring services.\n\nOnce the fake Flash installer is downloaded and launched, one of several backdoors is dropped. It could be Mosquito, which is a piece of Win32\nmalware, a malicious JavaScript file communicating with a web app hosted on Google Apps Script, or an unknown file downloaded from a bogus\nand non-existent Adobe URL.\n\nThe stage is then set for the mission’s main goal – exfiltration of sensitive data. This information includes the unique ID of the compromised\nmachine, the username, and the list of security products installed on the device. ‘Only’ the username and device name are exfiltrated by Turla’s\nbackdoor Snake on macOS.\n\nAt the final part of the process, the fake installer drops – or downloads – and then runs a legitimate Flash Player application. The latter’s installer is\neither embedded in its fake counterpart or is downloaded from a Google Drive web address.\n\n## Mosquito and JavaScript backdoors\n\nESET researchers have seen in the wild, new samples of the backdoor known as Mosquito. The more recent iterations are more heavily\nobfuscated with what appears to be a custom **[crypter, to make analysis more difficult both for malware researchers and for security software’s](http://www.virusradar.com/en/glossary/packer-crypter-protector)**\ncode.\n\nIn order to establish persistence on the system, the installer tampers with the operating system’s registry. It also creates an administrative account\nthat allows remote access.\n\nThe main backdoor CommanderDLL has the .pdb extension. It uses a custom encryption algorithm and can execute certain predefined actions.\nThe backdoor keeps track of everything it does on the compromised machine in an encrypted log file.\n\nTurla has been operating for a number of years and its activities have been monitored and analyzed by ESET research laboratories. Last year, the\nanalysts released pieces covering **[new versions of another Turla backdoor called Carbon,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/)** **watering hole campaigns misusing a Firefox**\n**browser extension and, most recently, a backdoor called** **[Gazer.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/08/30/eset-research-cyberespionage-gazer/)**\n\n\n### Follow usRead ESET’s latest findings about Turla here in: Diplomats in Eastern Europe bitten by a Turla mosquito\n\n**Sign up to our newsletter**\n\nThe latest security news direct to your inbox\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
