    "plain_text": "# BRONZE UNION Cyberespionage Persists Despite Disclosures\n\n**secureworks.com/research/bronze-union**\n\nCounter Threat Unit Research Team\n\nTuesday, June 27, 2017 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\n\n## Summary\n\n[In 2015, the SecureWorks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team documented the BRONZE](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage)\nUNION threat group (formerly labeled TG-3390), which CTU™ analysis suggests is based in the People's\nRepublic of China (PRC). Since that analysis, CTU researchers have observed multiple BRONZE UNION\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat campaigns that illustrate the evolution of the group s methods and espionage objectives. Despite\nmultiple public disclosures of their activities, BRONZE UNION remains an active and formidable threat as\nof this publication.\n\n[CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about this group into two sections: strategic and](https://www.gartner.com/doc/2487216/definition-threat-intelligence) tactical.\nExecutives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to determine how to reduce risk to\ntheir organization's mission and critical assets. Computer network defenders can use the tactical\ninformation gathered from incident response investigations and research to reduce the time and effort\nassociated with responding to the threat group's activities.\n\n## Key points\n\nCTU researchers assess it is highly likely that the BRONZE UNION threat group gathers defense,\nsecurity, and political intelligence from organizations around the world. CTU researchers have\nobserved it targeting organizations in the aerospace, government, defense, technology, energy, and\nmanufacturing verticals.\nCTU researchers assess it is likely that the group is located in the People's Republic of China.\nBRONZE UNION has historically used strategic web compromises (SWCs) in its campaigns, CTU\nresearchers have also observed it exploiting vulnerable Internet-facing services to gain access to\ntargeted networks.\nAfter accessing a network, the threat actors leverage a range of proprietary, publicly available, and\nnative tools to search for and acquire desirable data.\n\n## Strategic threat intelligence\n\nAnalysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which organizations could\nbe at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic defensive decisions regarding this\nthreat.\n\n### Intent\n\nBased on BRONZE UNION's targeting activity, CTU researchers assess it is highly likely that the group\nfocuses on political and defense organization networks. In 2016, the threat actors conducted a strategic\nweb compromise (SWC) on the website of an international industry organization that affected aerospace,\nacademic, media, technology, government, and utilities organizations around the world. During a discrete\nperiod of activity, this SWC was used to specifically target Turkish government, banking, and academic\nnetworks. These focused attacks suggest a concerted effort to compromise strategically significant\nnetworks in Turkey, possibly due to Turkey's political, economic, and military relationships in Europe and\nthe Middle East.\n\nIn addition, BRONZE UNION activity on multiple U.S.-based defense manufacturer networks included the\nthreat actors seeking information associated with aerospace technologies, combat processes, and naval\ndefense systems. Third-party [analysis suggests that systemic issues in the PRC’s defense technology](http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/6db76427-8c94-4fcd-8ac8-8cf75cfa3815)\nindustries could influence demand for this type of information because this type of data could potentially\naddress innovation and supply deficits which exist within this industry sector in the PRC.\n\n### Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2015, CTU researchers assessed that BRONZE UNION likely originates in the PRC based on factors\nsuch as targeting, operating hours, and tool selection. Observed activity since 2015 reinforces that\nassociation; for example:\n\ncontinued focus on information that would be of interest to individuals or groups living in a country\nthat has a significant manufacturing base and a strategic interest in U.S. military capabilities\nuse of web shells that have historically been leveraged by threat groups believed to be operating in\nthe PRC\nconnections between a subset of the group's operational infrastructure and PRC-based Internet\nservice companies\n\n### Capability\n\nBRONZE UNION has consistently demonstrated the capability to conduct successful large-scale\nintrusions against high-profile networks and systems. CTU researchers identified evidence of the group\nexploiting vulnerabilities in Internet-facing service desk software to gain an initial foothold on desirable\nnetworks, while concurrently compromising systems of interest via SWCs. During the observed intrusions,\nthe group rapidly collected account credentials, escalated privileges, and deployed multiple web shells\npresumably to extend its access across the compromised network.\n\nBRONZE UNION is disciplined and takes proactive steps to avoid detection. For example, at the end of\n2016 CTU researchers observed the threat actors using native system functionality to disable logging\nprocesses and delete logs within a network. The group also manipulated native Windows features on\ncompromised systems to access additional legitimate functionality. These behaviors indicate that the\nthreat actors quickly gain a detailed understanding of the environments they compromise and use this\nunderstanding to conceal their activity from network defenders. Although CTU researchers have observed\nBRONZE UNION modifying its tools, likely in response to public reporting on its activities, there is no\nevidence that the group's capabilities have changed substantially or that its operations have been\ndeterred.\n\n## Tactical threat intelligence\n\nInvestigating BRONZE UNION activity and evicting the threat actors from compromised networks have\ngiven CTU researchers unique insight into the group's tools and tactics.\n\n### Tools\n\nCTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION using the following tools in intrusions since the 2015\nanalysis, but clients should assume that the threat group still has access to the previously reported tools.\n\nOwaAuth — This web shell and credential stealer deployed to Microsoft Exchange servers is\ninstalled as an ISAPI filter. Captured credentials are DES-encrypted using the password “12345678”\n(see Figure 1), and are written to a text file (log.txt) in the system's root directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Configuration file from OwaAuth.dll. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\nChina Chopper web shell — This web-based executable script communicates with a full-featured\nuser interface to allow threat actors to transfer and create files, open a command terminal, and\ninteract with database servers.\nRcmd — This lateral movement tool facilitates the execution of commands on systems across the\ntarget environment.\nWrapikatz — This tool wraps Mimikatz code in a custom loader to evade antivirus detection, and\nchanges the command-line usage to evade process-telemetry detection and make the tool easier to\nuse. This tool is not exclusive to BRONZE UNION. CTU researchers have observed various threat\ngroups leveraging Wrapikatz binaries with different usage options.\n[Netview — This publicly available host-enumeration tool presents details about IP addresses,](https://github.com/mubix/netview)\nnetwork shares, remote sessions, and logged-on users.\nKekeo — This [publicly available toolset manipulates the Kerberos authentication protocol. CTU](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/kekeo)\nresearchers identified BRONZE UNION actors using a file named ms.exe that was likely a\ncredential-abuse tool from the Kekeo toolset.\n\n### Tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\nObservations of BRONZE UNION activity during several network compromises gave CTU researchers\ninsight into the tactics the group employs.\n\n**Access vectors and command and control**\n\nCTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION delivering malware to systems via SWCs and scan-andexploit techniques. The threat actors appear to be able to create and leverage multiple SWCs in parallel.\nThey have also demonstrated the ability to create SWCs and malware-staging sites by leveraging\nwebsites linked to networks previously compromised by the group. Apparent overlap between existing\ncompromises and new campaigns suggests that the group considers leveraging existing network\ncompromises when planning infrastructure requirements. Figure 2 shows a BRONZE UNION infection\nchain leveraging an SWC.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Likely BRONZE UNION infection chain observed in 2016. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\nIn multiple instances, CTU researchers observed artifacts from unsuccessful attempts to create a web\nshell on web-accessible JBOSS-based service desk software, followed by use of a functional shell to gain\naccess to the environment. These events strongly suggest that the threat actors leveraged the web\napplication as part of the initial compromise vector.\n\nBRONZE UNION appears to use a combination of self-registered IP addresses and commercial VPN\nservices in its command and control (C2) and operational infrastructure. The threat actors also integrate\ninfrastructure they likely previously compromised for espionage purposes. For example, CTU researchers\nidentified the group using IP addresses owned by several, presumably compromised, research\norganizations to interact with web shells in other target environments.\n\n**Host enumeration and lateral movement**\n\nAfter gaining an initial foothold in a compromised environment, the threat actors quickly identify and\nexplore accessible systems. In one example, BRONZE UNION actors leveraged initial web shell access\non Internet-facing systems to conduct internal reconnaissance, including domain enumeration and\nnetwork state, via ipconfig, net use, net user, and net view commands. In a separate incident, CTU\nresearchers identified a file named s.txt, which is consistent with the output of the Netview hostenumeration tool.\n\nKnowledge of the compromised environment allows the threat actors to move laterally between systems.\nCTU researchers identified ten compromised hosts in one environment that contained artifacts associated\nwith the Rcmd lateral-movement tool. Use of the tool leaves a small helper script (read.vbs) on the target\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem. This script relays commands and output between the controller and the system.\n\n**Defensive evasion**\n\nCTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION actors reconfiguring legitimate Windows features to\n[establish PowerShell remoting and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enable-psremoting?view=powershell-7.1) [WinRM (see Figure 3). These remote management technologies allow](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2015/10/27/compromising-yourself-with-winrms-allowunencrypted-true/)\na full range of configuration, data transfer, and remote execution capabilities over HTTP/HTTPS channels.\nEnabling these features gives the threat actor a remote control channel to persistently access the victim's\nenvironment without using malicious software that could be detected.\n\n_Figure 3. PowerShell commands. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\nSome payloads leveraged DLL side loading, a technique that involves running a legitimate, typically\ndigitally signed, program that loads a malicious DLL. The DLL acts as a stub loader, which loads and\nexecutes shell code. BRONZE UNION previously used this technique to enable execution of PlugX and\nHttpBrowser tools in a way that is challenging for network defenders to detect.\n\nIn 2016, CTU researchers observed the group using native system functionality to disable logging\n[processes and delete logs within a compromised environment. The threat actors used the appcmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/getting-started-with-iis/getting-started-with-appcmdexe)\ncommand-line tool to unlock and disable the default logging component on the server\n(systsm.webServer/httplogging) and then delete existing logs from the system (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Threat actor using appcmd to delete logs and disable logging. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n**Credential access**\n\nBRONZE UNION uses various tools for credential theft. In one incident, the threat actor used the\nWrapikatz tool (w.exe) with a usage statement that retrieves various passwords and Windows credentials\nfrom memory and compiles them in w.txt:\n```\nc:\\programdata\\w.exe –w –l –c>>c:\\programdata\\w.txt\n\n```\nIn a separate incident, the threat actor used access provided by extensive web shell deployment to\nharvest account credentials:\n```\n2016-10-03T09:27:47  dir\n2016-10-03T09:28:11  w64.log >ppp.log\n2016-10-03T09:30:10   PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File getpwd.ps1 >iistail.log\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIn another example, BRONZE UNION leveraged the Kekeo credential abuse tool to exploit CVE-20146324, a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol.\nExploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate privileges on the affected system.\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nBRONZE UNION has also leveraged various web shells to collect and stage data for exfiltration. In one\ninstance, the threat actor gained remote access to a high-value system in a compromised network, ran\n[quser.exe to identify existing RDP sessions on the device, immediately ran a command to compile a RAR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/quser)\narchive that specified file types the threat actor did not want, and used a password to encrypt the archive:\n```\nYYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss   quser\nYYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss   C:\\windows\\temp\\svchost.exe a -m5 -v2000m -hp{password} -inul -r \"\n{destination_file.rar}\" \"{multiple user directories linked to the victim's projects}\" -x*.exe x*.msi -x*.cab -x*.inc -x*.dll -x*.db -x*.mdb -x*.htm -x*.html -x*.css -x*.jar -x*.js -x*.tmp x*.bak -x*.dat -x*.log -x*.xml -x*.dmp -x*.dbf -x*.avi -x*.mp3 -x*.mp4 -x*.mpg -x*.mpeg -x*.asp x*.aspx -x*.gif -x*.jpg -x*.mpp -x*.pst\n\n```\nThe threat actors typically rename the encrypted RAR archives. In the following example, archives for\nexfiltration were renamed as .tmp files:\n```\nmove \\\\{FILE PATH}\\c$\\programdata\\AT.part01.rar \\\\{FILE PATH}\\c$\\programdata\\at01.tmp\n\n```\nThe TMP files were then staged for exfiltration on Internet-facing servers that had previously been\ncompromised with the China Chopper web shell. From those servers the threat actor could use a web\nshell to retrieve the encrypted archives:\n```\ncopy \\\\{FILE PATH}\\c$\\programdata\\*.tmp \\\\{FILE PATH}\\ServiceDesk\\custom\\style\n\n```\nAfter exfiltrating the files, the threat actor used web shell access on the staging server to delete the staged\nRAR archives and detach their network shares, likely to avoid detection. Figure 5 shows the commands\nused to perform these activities on a RAR archive renamed with a *.jpg extension.\n\n_Figure 5. BRONZE UNION commands. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n**Reentry attempt**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter BRONZE UNION was evicted from a compromised environment, which involved blocking the\ngroup's known infrastructure, CTU researchers observed the group attempting to reconnect to its OWA\nweb shells and a backup web shell it had deployed during the intrusion. The threat actor also attempted to\nuse OWA account credentials likely acquired during an earlier phase of the intrusion. BRONZE UNION\nappeared to leverage other compromised infrastructure, presumably to make reentry attempts seem\nlegitimate. This attempt illustrates the importance of thorough planning when conducting an eviction and\nthe need for continuous vigilance for evidence of reentry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs of this publication, BRONZE UNION remains a formidable threat group that targets intellectual property\nand executes its operations at a swift pace. Its activities indicate a preference for leveraging SWCs and\nscan-and-exploit techniques to compromise target systems. To mitigate these threats, CTU researchers\nrecommend that clients conduct regular internal vulnerability scanning, patching, and upgrading of priority\n[systems, particularly Internet-facing systems and users' devices. Advanced endpoint threat detection](https://www.secureworks.com/capabilities/managed-security/endpoint-security/endpoint-threat-detection)\n(AETD) can help detect activity associated with web shells and lateral movement, and network\ntechnologies that use sandboxing techniques to detonate binaries in network traffic can prevent malicious\ntraffic from reaching internal systems. Early detection and response can minimize exposure and damage.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 1 are associated with BRONZE UNION activity.
