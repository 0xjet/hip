    "plain_text": "# Computer Networks in South Korea Are Paralyzed in Cyberattacks\n\n**[nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html)**\n\nChoe Sang-Hun March 20, 2013\n\nContinue reading the main story\nSEOUL, South Korea — Computer networks running three major South Korean banks and\nthe country’s two largest broadcasters were paralyzed Wednesday in attacks that some\nexperts suspected originated in North Korea, which has consistently threatened to cripple its\nfar richer neighbor.\n\nThe attacks, which left many South Koreans unable to withdraw money from A.T.M.’s and\nnews broadcasting crews staring at blank computer screens, came as the North’s official\nKorean Central News Agency quoted the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as threatening to\ndestroy government installations in the South, along with American bases in the Pacific.\n\nThough American officials dismissed those threats, they also noted that the broadcasters hit\nby the virus had been cited by the North before as potential targets.\n\nThe Korea Communications Commission said Thursday that the disruption originated at an\nInternet provider address in China but that it was still not known who was responsible\n\n\n-----\n\nMany analysts in Seoul suspect that North Korean hackers honed their skills in China and\nwere operating there. At a hacking conference here last year, Michael Sutton, the head of\nthreat research at Zscaler, a security company, said a handful of hackers from China “were\nclearly very skilled, knowledgeable and were in touch with their counterparts and familiar with\nthe scene in North Korea.”\n\nBut there has never been any evidence to back up some analysts’ speculation that they were\ncollaborating with their Chinese counterparts. “I’ve never seen any real evidence that points\nto any exchanges between China and North Korea, ” said Adam Segal, a senior fellow who\nspecializes in China and cyberconflict at the Council on Foreign Relations,\n\nWednesday’s attacks, which occurred as American and South Korean military forces were\nconducting major exercises, were not as sophisticated as some from China that have struck\nUnited States computers, and certainly less sophisticated than the American and Israeli\ncyberattack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. But it was far more complex than a “denial of service”\nattack that simply overwhelms a computer system with a flood of data.\n\nThe malware is called “DarkSeoul” in the computer world and was first identified about a year\nago. It is intended to evade some of South Korea’s most popular antivirus products and to\nrender computers unusable. In Wednesday’s strikes, the attackers made no effort to disguise\nthe malware, leading some to question whether it came from a state sponsor — which tend\nto be more stealthy — or whether officials or hackers in North Korea were sending a specific,\nclear message: that they can reach into Seoul’s economic heart without blowing up South\nKorean warships or shelling South Korean islands.\n\nNorth Korea was accused of using both those techniques in attacks over the past three\nyears.\n\nThe cyberattacks Wednesday come just days after North Korea blamed South Korea and the\nUnited States for attacks on some of its Web sites. The North’s official Korean Central News\nAgency said last week that North Korea “will never remain a passive onlooker to the\nenemies’ cyberattacks that have reached a very grave phase as part of their moves to stifle\nit.”\n\nThe South Korean government cautioned that it was still too early to point the finger for\nWednesday’s problems at the North, which has been threatening “pre-emptive nuclear\nattacks” and other, unspecified actions against its southern neighbor for conducting the\nmilitary exercises with the United States this month and for supporting new American-led\nUnited Nations sanctions against the North.\n\n“We cannot rule out the possibility of North Korean involvement, but we don’t want to jump to\na conclusion,” said Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe military raised its alert against cyberattacks, he added, and the Korea Communications\nCommission asked government agencies and businesses to triple the number of monitors for\n[possible hacking attacks. South Korea’s new president, Park Geun-hye, instructed a civilian-](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/park_geunhye/index.html?8qa)\ngovernment task force to investigate the disruptions.\n\nImage\nThe computers of South Korea’s cable channel YTN were frozen during the attacks on\nWednesday.Credit...YTN/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\nIt could take months to determine the true source of the attacks, and sometimes\ninvestigators never come to a firm conclusion. In 2009, a similar campaign of coordinated\ncyberattacks over the Fourth of July holiday hit 27 American and South Korean Web sites,\nincluding South Korea’s presidential palace, called the Blue House; its Defense Ministry; and\nWeb sites belonging to the United States Treasury Department, the Secret Service and the\nFederal Trade Commission.\n\nBut those were all “distributed denial of service” attacks in which attackers flood the sites\nwith traffic until they fall offline. While many suspected North Korea, a clear link to the\ncountry was never established.\n\nSouth Korea’s two leading television stations, the publicly financed Korean Broadcasting\nSystem and MBC, maintained normal broadcasts but said their computers were frozen. The\ncable channel YTN reported a similar problem. The KBS Web site was shut down.\n\nShinhan Bank, the country’s fourth-largest lender, reported that its Internet banking servers\nhad been temporarily blocked. Technicians restored operations, the government’s Financial\nServices Commission said in a statement.\n\nTwo other banks, NongHyup and Jeju, reported that operations at some of their branches\nhad been paralyzed after computers were infected with viruses and their files erased, the\ncommission said. After two hours, the banks’ operations returned to normal, they said. A\nfourth bank, Woori, reported a hacking attack, but said it had suffered no damage.\n\n[The Web site of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea was](http://www.hrnk.org/)\nhacked by an entity calling itself “Hitman 007-Kingdom of Morocco,” which stole the\ncommittee’s publications and other documents, said its executive director, Greg Scarlatoiu.\n\nHe said he did not know whether the attack was linked to the disruptions in South Korea, but\nnoted that it came a day before the United Nations Human Rights Council was to vote on the\nresolution calling for the establishment of an independent investigation of North Korean\nhuman rights abuses, including its running of prison gulags. The committee has been an\nactive supporter of such an inquiry.\n\n“This type of mishap is not to be unexpected, given the nature of our work,” Mr. Scarlatoiu\nsaid.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn testimony to Congress last year, Gen. James D. Thurman, the American commander in\nSouth Korea, described what he called North Korea’s “growing cyberwarfare capability.”\n\n“North Korea employs sophisticated computer hackers trained to launch cyberinfiltration and\ncyberattacks” against South Korea and the United States, General Thurman said. “Such\nattacks are ideal for North Korea,” he added, “providing the regime a means to attack” South\nKorean and American businesses “without attribution.”\n\nBut security researchers and foreign policy experts say that North Korea faces significant\nhurdles. “They simply don’t have access to the same technology due to sanctions,” said Mr.\nSutton, of Zscaler. “And a large portion of their population does not have ready access to the\nInternet, so they don’t have that natural pool of talent to recruit from.”\n\nLee Seong-won, an official at the communications commission, told reporters on Wednesday\nthat the malicious code, once activated, disrupted the booting of computers. “It will take time\nfor us to find out the identity and motive of those who were behind this attack,” he said.\n\nThe government investigators were also checking whether the images of skulls that\nreportedly popped up on some computer screens had anything to do with the virus attack.\n\nIn recent years, North Korea has vowed to attack South Korean television stations and\nnewspapers for carrying articles critical of its government, even citing the map coordinates of\ntheir headquarters.\n\n\n-----",
