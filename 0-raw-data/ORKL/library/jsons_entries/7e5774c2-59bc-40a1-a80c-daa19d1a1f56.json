The U.S. Secret Service, in partnership with DHS, followed up with an](http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2014/07/backoff-technical-analysis.html)\n[advisory.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1279345-secret-service-malware-announcement.html)\n\nAlthough very thorough, the existing public analyses of Backoff are missing a very\nrelevant piece of information: the command-and-control (C&C) servers. However, if you\nhave access to the samples it isn’t hard to extract this information. At the end of this\ndocument, you can find a full list together with other IOCs (indicators of compromise).\n\n_Backoff malware configuration, with C&Cs_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe sinkholed two C&C servers that Backoff samples used to communicate with their\nmasters. These C&C servers are used by certain samples that were compiled from\nJanuary – March 2014. Over the past few days, we observed over 100 victims in\nseveral countries connecting to the sinkhole.\n\n## Statistics:\n\nThere were several interesting victims among them:\n\nA global freight shipping and transport logistics company with headquarters in North\nAmerica.\nA U.K.-based charitable organization that provides support, advice and information\nto local voluntary organizations and community groups.\nA payroll association in North America.\nA state institute connected with information technology and communication in\nEastern Europe.\nA liquor store chain in the U.S.\nAn ISP in Alabama, U.S.\nA U.S.-based Mexican food chain.\nA company that owns and manages office buildings in California, U.S.\nA Canadian company that owns and operates a massive chain of restaurants.\n\nThere are also a lot of home user lines, mostly in the U.S. and Canada, connecting to the\nsinkhole. This is to be expected as many smaller businesses generally tend to run those\nrather than dedicated corporate connections.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe success of Backoff paints a very bleak picture of the state of point-of-sale security.\nOur sinkhole covers less than 5% of the C&C channels and the sinkholed domains only\napply to certain Backoff samples that were created in the first quarter of this year. Yet,\nwe’ve seen more than 85 victims connecting to our sinkhole.\n\nMost of these victims are located in North America and some of them are high profile.\nTaking into account the U.S. Secret Service statement, it’s a pretty safe bet that the\nnumber of Backoff infections at businesses in North America is well north of 1,000.\n\nSince its appearance last year, Backoff has not changed dramatically. The author created\nboth non-obfuscated and obfuscated samples. This was likely done to defeat the security\ncontrols on the targeted networks. However, the defenses running on a PoS terminal\nand/or network should not have been affected by this. This speaks volumes about the\ncurrent state of PoS security, and other cybercriminals are sure to have taken note.\n\nIt’s very clear that PoS networks are prime targets for malware attacks. This is especially\n[true in the US, which still doesn’t support EMV chip-enabled cards. Unlike magnetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV)\nstrips, EMV chips on credit cards can’t be easily cloned, making them more resilient.\nUnfortunately, the US is adopting chip and signature, rather than chip and PIN. This\neffectively negates some of the added security EMV can bring.\n\nThis may prove another costly mistake. Not adopting EMV along with the rest of the world\nis really haunting retail in the U.S. and the situation is not likely to change anytime soon.\n\n## IOCs / C&Cs:\n\n### Trojan file paths:\n```\n%APPDATA%\\AdobeFlashPlayer\\mswinsvc.exe\n%APPDATA%\\AdobeFlashPlayer\\mswinhost.exe\n%APPDATA%\\AdobeFlashPlayer\\Local.dat\n%APPDATA%\\AdobeFlashPlayer\\Log.txt\n%APPDATA%\\mskrnl\n%APPDATA%\\nsskrnl\n%APPDATA%\\winserv.exe\n%APPDATA%\\OracleJava\\javaw.exe\n%APPDATA%\\OracleJava\\javaw.exe\n%APPDATA%\\OracleJava\\Local.dat\n%APPDATA%\\OracleJava\\Log.txt\n\n Kaspersky names for the Trojans:\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Invader\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\nBackdoor.Win32.Backoff\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.ahhia\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.agvmh\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.aeyfj\nTrojan-Spy.Win32.Recam.qq\nTrojan-Dropper.Win32.Sysn.ajci\nTrojan.Win32.Bublik.covz\nTrojan-Dropper.Win32.Dapato.dddq\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.agufs\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.ahbhh\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.agigp\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.aeqsu\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.ahgxs\nTrojan.Win32.Inject.mhjl\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.ahbhh\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.ahhee\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.ahgxs\n\n### MD5s:\n684e03daaffa02ffecd6c7747ffa030e\n3ff0f444ef4196f2a47a16eeec506e93\n12c9c0bc18fdf98189457a9d112eebfc\n14cca3ad6365cb50751638d35bdb84ec\nd0f3bf7abbe65b91434905b6955203fe\n38e8ed887e725339615b28e60f3271e4\n7b027599ae15512256bb5bc52e58e811\n5cdc9d5998635e2b91c0324465c6018f\n821ac2580843cb0c0f4baff57db8962e\nb08d4847c370f79af006d113b3d8f6cf\n17e1173f6fc7e920405f8dbde8c9ecac\n874cd0b7b22ae1521fd0a7d405d6fa12\nea0c354f61ba0d88a422721caefad394\n6a0e49c5e332df3af78823ca4a655ae8\n8a019351b0b145ee3abe097922f0d4f6\n337058dca8e6cbcb0bc02a85c823a003\n842e903b955e134ae281d09a467e420a\nd1d544dbf6b3867d758a5e7e7c3554bf\n01f0d20a1a32e535b950428f5b5d6e72\nfc041bda43a3067a0836dca2e6093c25\n4956cf9ddd905ac3258f9605cf85332b\nf5b4786c28ccf43e569cb21a6122a97e\ncc640ad87befba89b440edca9ae5d235\n0b464c9bebd10f02575b9d9d3a771db3\nd0c74483f20c608a0a89c5ba05c2197f\nb1661862db623e05a2694c483dce6e91\nffe53fb9280bf3a8ceb366997488486e\nc0d0b7ffaec38de642bf6ff6971f4f9e\n05f2c7675ff5cda1bee6a168bdbecac0\n9ee4c29c95ed435644e6273b1ae3da58\n0607ce9793eea0a42819957528d92b02\n97fa64dfaa27d4b236e4a76417ab51c1\n82d811a8a76df0cda3f34fdcd0e26e27\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n0b7732129b46ed15ff73f72886946220\n30c5592a133137a84f61898993e513db\naa68ecf6f097ffb01c981f09a21aef32\nbbe534abcc0a907f3c18cfe207a5dfca\n29e0259b4ea971c72fd7fcad54a0f8d0\n\n### C&C domains and hostnames:\n00000000000.888[.]ru\n10000000000.888[.]ru\nadobephotoshop11111[.]com\nadobephotoshop22222[.]com\ndomain12827312[.]com\nhelloflashplayers12345[.]com\nhellojavaplayers12345[.]com\nilovereservdom213ada2[.]ru\niownacarservice[.]ru\niownacarservice1[.]com\nmsframework1[.]com\nmsframework1[.]ru\nmsframeworkx64[.]com\nmsframeworkx86[.]com\nmsframeworkx86[.]ru\nmsoffice365net[.]com\nnullllllllllll[.]com\nollygo030233[.]com\nollygo030233[.]ru\npop3smtp5imap2[.]com\npop3smtp5imap3[.]com\npop3smtp5imap4[.]ru\nreservedomain12312[.]ru\ntotal-updates[.]com\n\n C&C IPs:\n\n```\n```\n146.185.233.32\n\n```\n```\n81.4.111.176\n\n```\n```\n95.211.228.249\n217.174.105.86\n\n```\n\n-----",
