ScarCruft is a Korean-speaking and allegedly state-sponsored\nthreat actor that usually targets organizations and companies with links to the Korean\npeninsula. The threat actor is highly skilled and, by all appearances, quite resourceful.\n\nWe recently discovered some interesting telemetry on this actor, and decided to dig\ndeeper into ScarCruft’s recent activity. This shows that the actor is still very active and\nconstantly trying to elaborate its attack tools. Based on our telemetry, we can\nreassemble ScarCruft’s binary infection procedure. It used a multi-stage binary infection\nto update each module effectively and evade detection. In addition, we analyzed the\nvictims of this campaign and spotted an interesting overlap of this campaign with another\nAPT actor known as DarkHotel.\n\n## Multi-stage binary infection\n\nThe ScarCruft group uses common malware delivery techniques such as spear phishing\nand Strategic Web Compromises (SWC). As in [Operation Daybreak, this actor performs](https://securelist.com/operation-daybreak/75100/)\nsophisticated attacks using a zero-day exploit. However, sometimes using public exploit\ncode is quicker and more effective for malware authors. We witnessed this actor\nextensively testing a known [public exploit during its preparation for the next campaign.](https://github.com/smgorelik/Windows-RCE-exploits)\n\nIn order to deploy an implant for the final payload, ScarCruft uses a multi-stage binary\ninfection scheme. As a rule, the initial dropper is created by the infection procedure. One\nof the most notable functions of the initial dropper is to bypass Windows UAC (User\nAccount Control) in order to execute the next payload with higher privileges. This\nmalware uses the public privilege escalation exploit code [CVE-2018-8120 or](https://github.com/leeqwind/HolicPOC/blob/master/windows/win32k/CVE-2018-8120/x86.cpp) [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)\nwhich is normally used by legitimate red teams. Afterwards, the installer malware creates\na downloader and a configuration file from its resource and executes it. The downloader\nmalware uses the configuration file and connects to the C2 server to fetch the next\npayload. In order to evade network level detection, the downloader uses steganography.\nThe downloaded payload is an image file, but it contains an appended malicious payload\nto be decrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Multi-stage binary infection_\n\n\nThe final payload created by the aforementioned process is a well known backdoor, also\nknown as [ROKRAT by Cisco Talos. This cloud service-based backdoor contains many](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/11/ROKRAT-Reloaded.html)\nfeatures. One of its main functions is to steal information. Upon execution, this malware\ncreates 10 random directory paths and uses them for a specially designated purpose.\nThe malware creates 11 threads simultaneously: six threads are responsible for stealing\ninformation from the infected host, and five threads are for forwarding collected data to\nfour cloud services (Box, Dropbox, Pcloud and Yandex). When uploading stolen data to\na cloud service, it uses predefined directory path such as /english, /video or /scriptout.\n\n\n_Cloud-based backdoor_\n\n\nThe same malware contains full-featured backdoor functionality. The commands are\ndownloaded from the /script path of a cloud service provider and the respective\nexecution results are uploaded to the /scriptout path. It supports the following\ncommands, which are enough to fully control the infected host:\n\n\n-----\n\nGet File/Process listing\nDownload additional payload and execute\nExecute Windows command\nUpdate configuration data including cloud service token information\nSave screenshot and an audio recording\n\nThe ScarCruft group keeps expanding its exfiltration targets to steal further information\nfrom infected hosts and continues to create tools for additional data exfiltration. During\nour research, we confirmed that they have an interest in mobile devices.\n\nWe also discovered an interesting piece of rare malware created by this threat actor – a\nBluetooth device harvester. This malware is responsible for stealing Bluetooth device\ninformation. It is fetched by a downloader, and collects information directly from the\ninfected host. This malware uses Windows Bluetooth APIs to find information on\nconnected Bluetooth devices and saves the following information.\n\nInstance Name: Name of device\nAddress: Address of device\nClass: Class of the device\nConnected: Whether the device is connected(true or false)\nAuthenticated: Whether the device is authenticated(true or false)\nRemembered: Whether the device is a remembered device(true or false)\n\nThe attackers appear to be increasing the scope of the information collected from\nvictims.\n\n\n_Build path of Bluetooth information harvester_\n\n\n## Victimology\n\nWe have found several victims of this campaign, based on our telemetry – investment\nand trading companies in Vietnam and Russia. We believe they may have some links to\nNorth Korea, which may explain why ScarCruft decided to closely monitor them.\nScarCruft also attacked a diplomatic agency in Hong Kong, and another diplomatic\nagency in North Korea. It appears ScarCruft is primarily targeting intelligence for political\nand diplomatic purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Victimology of this campaign_\n\n\n## Overlap with other actors\n\nWe discovered one victim from Russia that also triggered a malware detection while\nstaying in North Korea in the past. The fact that this victim visits North Korea makes its\nspecial and suggests that it may have valuable information about North Korean affairs.\nScarCruft infected this victim on September 21, 2018. But before the ScarCruft infection,\nhowever, another APT group also targeted this victim with the host being infected with\nGreezeBackdoor on March 26, 2018.\n\nGreezeBackdoor is a tool of the [DarkHotel APT group, which we have previously written](https://securelist.com/the-darkhotel-apt/66779/)\nabout. In addition, this victim was also attacked by the Konni malware on 03 April 2018.\nThe Konni malware was disguised as a North Korean news item in a weaponized\ndocuments (the name of the document was “Why North Korea slams South Korea’s\nrecent defense talks with U.S-Japan.zip”)\n\n\n_Infection timeline_\n\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen an overlap of ScarCruft and DarkHotel actors.\nMembers from our team have already presented on the conflict of these two threat\nactors at [security conferences. We have also shared more details with our threat](https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2017/10/vb2017-paper-walking-your-enemys-shadow-when-fourth-party-collection-becomes-attribution-hell/)\nintelligence customers in the past. They are both Korean-speaking threat actors and\nsometimes their victimology overlaps. But both group seem to have different TTPs\n(Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) and it leads us to believe that one group regularly\nlurks in the other’s shadow.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ScarCruft has shown itself to be a highly-skilled and active group. It has a keen\ninterest in North Korean affairs, attacking those in the business sector who may have\nany connection to North Korea, as well as diplomatic agencies around the globe. Based\non the ScarCruft’s recent activities, we strongly believe that this group is likely to\ncontinue to evolve.
