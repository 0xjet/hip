    "plain_text": "# Ransomware Gangs Now Outing Victim Businesses That Don’t Pay Up\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ransomware-gangs-now-outing-victim-businesses-that-dont-pay-up/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ransomware-gangs-now-outing-victim-businesses-that-dont-pay-up/)**\n\nAs if the scourge of ransomware wasn’t bad enough already: Several prominent purveyors of\nransomware have signaled they plan to start publishing data stolen from victims who refuse\nto pay up. To make matters worse, one ransomware gang has now created a public Web site\nidentifying recent victim companies that have chosen to rebuild their operations instead of\nquietly acquiescing to their tormentors.\n\nThe message displayed at the top of the Maze Ransomware public shaming site.\n\nLess than 48 hours ago, the cybercriminals behind the Maze Ransomware strain erected a\nWeb site on the public Internet, and it currently lists the company names and corresponding\nWeb sites for eight victims of their malware that have declined to pay a ransom demand.\n\n“Represented here companies dont wish to cooperate with us, and trying to hide our\nsuccessful attack on their resources,” the site explains in broken English. “Wait for their\ndatabases and private papers here. Follow the news!”\n\nKrebsOnSecurity was able to verify that at least one of the companies listed on the site\nindeed recently suffered from a Maze ransomware infestation that has not yet been reported\nin the news media.\n\nThe information disclosed for each Maze victim includes the initial date of infection, several\nstolen Microsoft Office, text and PDF files, the total volume of files allegedly exfiltrated from\nvictims (measured in Gigabytes), as well as the IP addresses and machine names of the\nservers infected by Maze.\n\nAs shocking as this new development may be to some, it’s not like the bad guys haven’t\nwarned us this was coming.\n\n“For years, ransomware developers and affiliates have been telling victims that they must\npay the ransom or stolen data would be publicly released,” said Lawrence Abrams, founder\n[of the computer security blog and victim assistance site BleepingComputer.com. “While it](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-will-now-publish-victims-data-if-not-paid/)\nhas been a well-known secret that ransomware actors snoop through victim’s data, and in\nmany cases steal it before the data is encrypted, they never actually carried out their threats\nof releasing it.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAbrams said that changed at the end of last month, when the crooks behind Maze\nRansomware threatened Allied Universal that if they did not pay the ransom, they would\nrelease their files. When they did not receive a payment, they released 700MB worth of\ndata on a hacking forum.\n\n“Ransomware attacks are now data breaches,” Abrams said. “During ransomware attacks,\nsome threat actors have told companies that they are familiar with internal company secrets\nafter reading the company’s files. Even though this should be considered a data breach,\nmany ransomware victims simply swept it under the rug in the hopes that nobody would ever\nfind out. Now that ransomware operators are releasing victim’s data, this will need to change\nand companies will have to treat these attacks like data breaches.”\n\nThe move by Maze Ransomware comes just days after the cybercriminals responsible for\n[managing the “Sodinokibi/rEvil” ransomware empire posted on a popular dark Web forum](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sodinokibi&x=0&y=0)\nthat they also plan to start using stolen files and data as public leverage to get victims to pay\nransoms.\n\nThe leader of the Sodinokibi/rEvil ransomware gang promising to name and shame victims publicly in\n\na recent cybercrime forum post. Image: BleepingComputer.\n\nThis is especially ghastly news for companies that may already face steep fines and other\npenalties for failing to report breaches and safeguard their customers’ data. For example,\nhealthcare providers are required to report ransomware incidents to the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services, which often documents breaches involving lost or stolen\nhealthcare data on its own site.\n\nWhile these victims may be able to avoid reporting ransomware incidents if they can show\nforensic evidence demonstrating that patient data was never taken or accessed, sites like the\none that Maze Ransomware has now erected could soon dramatically complicate these\n\n\n-----\n\nincidents.\n\n\n-----",
