The\nBTCWare family of ransomware is distributed by the developers hacking into remote\ncomputers with weak passwords using Remote Desktop services. Once they are able to gain\naccess to a computer, they will install the ransomware and encrypt the victim's files.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by the Nuclear BTCware\nRansomware variant for free. If you wish to discuss this ransomware or receive any support,\n[you can use our dedicated Btcware Ransomware Support Topic. In the past, the developers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/644140/btcware-ransomware-support-topic-nuclear-Nuclear-helptxt/)\nhave released the decryption keys for variants that were no longer in distribution. It appears\nthey decided to no longer offer this to their victims. We hope they change their mind.\n\n**Update 8/30/17:**\n\n[Michael Gillespie discovered that the developers of this variant messed up on the encryption](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nof files greater than 10MB in file size and will not be able to decrypt them. It was also\ndiscovered that this same behavior was seen with other files of random sizes. Therefore, it is\nadvised that you do not pay the ransom as there is a good chance many of your files not be\nable to be decrypted.\n\n### What's New in the Nuclear Ransomware BTCWare Variant\n\nWhile overall the encryption methods stay the same in this variant, there have been some\ndifferences. First and foremost, we have a new ransom note with a file name of HELP.hta.\nThis ransom note contains instructions to contact black.world@tuta.io for payment\ninformation as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Nuclear Ransomware (BTCWare) Ransom Note**\n\nThe next noticeable change is the extension appended to encrypted files. With this version,\nwhen a file is encrypted by the ransomware, it will modify the filename and then append the .\n\n**[affiliate_email].nuclear extension to encrypted file's name. For example, the current**\nversion will encrypt a file called test.jpg and rename it to test.jpg.\n\n**[black.world@tuta.io].nuclear.**\n\nYou can see an example of an encrypted folder below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Folder of Encrypted nuclear Files**\n\nThis variant also uses a different public RSA encryption key that is used to encrypt the\nvictim's AES encryption key. This public encryption key is:\n```\n-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDMwl0XpgillW5xCvuTbug+U+bVtZTaS0SRM+gNgaegG9PwsU\n-----END PUBLIC KEY----\n```\nIf any new information or methods to decrypt the files becomes available, we will be sure to\nupdate this article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n### File Hashes:\n```\nSHA256: d5397a05b745f64ab16ff921fb4571e9072b54437080bc9630047465e6b06a41\n\n Filenames associated with the Nuclear Ransomware Variant:\nHelp.hta\n\n Nuclear BTCWare Ransomware Ransom Note Text:\nAll your files have been encrypted!\nAll your files have been encrypted due to a security problem with your PC.
