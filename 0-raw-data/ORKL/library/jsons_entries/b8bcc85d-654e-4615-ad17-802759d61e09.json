Backdoor functionality\ncan also cross campaigns and tools. For example, sometimes we see an “inject” variant\ndropping a “sys10” backdoor. Or a naikon backdoor dropping a rarstone backdoor.\nAgain, this particular actor is responsible for the MsnMM and Naikon campaigns\ndeploying the following backdoors and tools:\n\n- sslMM\n\n- winMM\n\n- exe_exchange\n\n- wininetMM/sakto\n\n- inject\n\n- sys10\n\n- xsControl/naikon and plugins\n\n- rarstone\n\n- second stage tools\n\nThe Naikon group also deployed a lesser-known set of second stage tools. They mixed\ntogether legitimate system administration tools with offensive network reconnaissance\ntools, including a custom network and service scanner and an attack codeset based\non old Honker Union codebase shared on Chinese-speaking forums. See “Second\nStage Tools”.\n\nFor years, Naikon downloaders/backdoors were delivered to victim systems with kitproduced CVE-2012-0158 spear-phish. This exploit builder kit was shared amongst\nmultiple APTs, because we see the same exploits dropping tools from various\ngroups. Many of these exploit attachments were blocked by our advanced exploit\nprotection (AEP) on customer systems in Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines, and\norganizations related to the energy sector in these and other ASEAN nations. Some\nof these backdoors and spear-phish activities also showed up in the Hardore Charlie\nCEIEC dump. In Jan 2014, we observed in some targets the increase of “right-to-leftoverride” (RTLO) naming schemes for initial payload delivery. In addition to its custom\ntoolset, it appears to test freely-distributed tools – in December 2013, it pushed out\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n“Everything32” to victim systems, and TeamViewer was used as well. It is likely that\nthe group faced difficulties when it came up against anti-malware products and tried\nabusing legitimate tools for anti-malware evasion. Finally, this threat actor deploys\na custom pdf binding tool, to add to its effective but low-tech toolset.\n\nThe Naikon attackers can be, and in fact have been precise in social-engineering their\ntargets. Data collection prior to an attack may have included the following data points:\n\n- full names\n\n- email addresses and status (active or inactive)\n\n- date of birth and age\n\n- interests in current events\n\n- nationality\n\n- gender\n\n- previous email and social network communications to and from a target\n\n- language spoken\n\nVictims of the early campaigns were located mostly throughout Myanmar, Vietnam,\nSingapore, Laos, Malaysia, and the Philippines. There are other locations where Naikon’s\nvictims can be found, but these countries stand out.\n\nTo get in to target networks, the Naikon APT relied on email as an attack vector. It first\ncompromised victim systems using common spear-phishing techniques, such as cve2012-0158 exploit attachments, attachments altered with RTLO techniques, and a com­\nbination of icon-spoofing and name padding for executables. The MsnMM campaigns\nfeatured ripped images and documents re-used for spear-phish decoys, and we see that\ntechnique reapplied throughout other Naikon APT campaigns. The winMM components\nwere also delivered to Myanmar victims throughout mid-2013 using RTLO and iconspoofing techniques and sometimes even simpler icon spoofing+double extension+extra\nspacing in attachment filenames. For example, many of the Backdoor.Win32.MsnMM.i\n(winMM) executable filenames maintained almost 200 spaces, looking like this:\n\n“letter to Gov office.doc .exe”\n\nThe Naikon APT used multiple backdoors presenting a variety of behaviors over time,\nbut clusters of indicators were fairly consistent into 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### SHARED EXPLOIT GENERATION KIT\n\nIt’s interesting that what appear to be multiple campaigns and crews all use a kit that\ngenerates CVE-2012-0158 exploits embedded with arbitrary backdoors for spearphishing. One of the interesting characteristics of the Naikon APT’s kit-produced shell­\ncode is its runtime function offset calculations and control flow are built to jump past\nbehavior-based protection and sandbox analysis. Each of the win32 api shellcode calls\nare carefully executed to land just past function hot patch space and prologues, evading\nuser mode trampolines and hooks.\n\nMsnMM, Naikon and Rarstone backdoors were generally delivered with stock 0158\nexploits. Some dropped iph.bat and an “iExplorer.exe” that began with a “WMcal”\nparameter and profile.dat executable blob loaded into a running IE process. Other\nAPTs use this kit as well. We found Stone Panda Poison Ivy samples delivered with\nthe same CVE-2012-0158 exploits, dropping iph.bat and iExplorer.exe, and running\nthe “iExplorer.exe WMcal” executable filename and parameter.\n\nFinally, we found another exploit builder’s template used to attack Korean-speaking\ntargets. It was used across this group and others for building CVE-2012-0158 files,\nsharing the common author “Tran Duy Linh”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### SHARED STRINGS, FUNCTIONALITY, TARGETS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS CAMPAIGNS\n\nMultiple Naikon tools used in multiple campaigns shared strings, functionality, a deployment\nand content focus on ASEAN organizations and other organizations doing business with\nthem, and the infrastructure itself. Let’s examine some of the toolset’s shared strings and\nfunctionality, then move on to shared infrastructure.\n\n#### Similar strings\n\nWhile the Naikon backdoor maintained the user-agent string “NOKIAN95/WEB”, it also\nmaintained a debug path\n\nf:\\MyProjects\\xServer\\Release\\xServer.pdb\n\nAlso, the Naikon backdoor’s matching management software is called “xsControl”.\nPlugins for the Naikon backdoor included a screenshot grabber named xsAdv.dll, and\na single export “XS_Screencap”.\n\nThis debug path in Naikon backdoors is very similar to the debug path maintained\nin Rarstone backdoors:\n\ng:\\MyProjects\\xsFunction\\Release\\DLL.pdb\n\nThe MsnMM campaign backdoors all maintain an “MM” internal name, and\nthe functionality changes when comparing them:\n\n- WinMM\n\n- WininetMM\n\n- SslMM\n\nA more recent oddity from this group includes a WinMM dropper with the internal name\n“Zhixin”, creating a recently compiled Sys10 backdoor.\n\nSome “MM” executables maintained debug strings across versions and families:\n\nJ:\\chong\\new\\Release\\SslMM.exe\n\nand\n\nJ:\\chong\\nod\\Release\\SslMM.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n#### Shared infrastructure\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some of the shared infrastructure that helps to tie all\nof these campaigns together. MsnMM backdoors and naikon backdoors share por­\ntions of infrastructure across campaigns. For a quick example, early msnMM back­\ndoors like sslMM, and one of the later tools, exe_exchange, share some domains\nwith the nokian95 (naikon) and sys10 backdoors. There is much crossover.\n\nHere, you can see a table recording domains that are shared across the backdoors\nfor command and control infrastructure.\n\n\nexe_exchange sys10 winMM sslMM wininetMM/ sakto xsPlus/naikon\n\n\nahzx.eicp.net yes yes yes\n\nmncgn.51vip.biz yes yes yes\n\nbkav.imshop.in yes yes\n\nubaoyouxiang.gicp.net yes yes yes yes\n\ngooglemm.vicp.net yes yes\n\nmyanmartech.vicp.net yes yes yes\n\n#### Correlating target profiles with spear-phish and decoy content\n\nOne of the most striking characteristics of this APT is that its targeting interest\nis revealed by its spear-phish and decoy content. Malicious actors of all stripes,\nincluding cybercriminals, have for at least the last ten years abused “hot topics”\nin their social-engineering content to better attract and mass-exploit victim sys­\ntems. It’s a pretty worn-out discussion. What is different about the Naikon APT’s\nuse of hot topics in spear-phish and decoy content is that reveals its specific victims\nand how these change over time. Precision social engineering seems to be an ele­\nvated skill set for the group.\n\nA few of the most interesting examples of such content include: a UN discussion\nand vote on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, the MH370 flight, and\nconstruction on the Raytheon-built National Coast Watch Center in PH.\n\nFor example, in the second week of October 2012, during the gang’s intense ongoing\nfocus on SE Asian countries like Cambodia and its diplomats, we find a winMM backdoor\ndetected as \"Trojan.Win32.Agent.udtc\" in New York City. This verdict identified the Naikon\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nAPT’s backdoor on the victim system. The timing is uncanny because, in that same week\nspeeches and views on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were presented by SE\n[Asian country delegates to the United Nations in New York City. An example of such a talk](http://www.un.org/disarmament/special/meetings/firstcommittee/67/pdfs/11%20Oct%20GD%20Cambodia.pdf)\n[is here; a naikon decoy’s content was strikingly similar:](http://www.un.org/disarmament/special/meetings/firstcommittee/67/pdfs/11%20Oct%20GD%20Cambodia.pdf)\n\nMsnMM campaigns most commonly presented spear-phish exploits targeting CVE2012-0158.

After the malicious document is opened and successfully\nexploits CVE-2012-0158 on the victim workstation, the exploit code drops and\nopens this decoy Word document:\n\nThis next example is written with the Laotian Phetsarath OT font, a decoy attempt\nto be a legitimate Daily News Brief from the Laotian Foreign Ministry of Affairs.\nIt demonstrates the group’s intentions to hit targets in Laos:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nAppendix A contains many more example document titles and screenshots.\nThe themes and content that would appeal to politically-interested individuals\nin various parts of the world quickly become obvious.\n\nIn addition to a high volume of files exploiting CVE-2012-0158, the MsnMM attackers\nfor a brief period used RTLO (right to left override) techniques, and then attachments\nexploiting CVE-2010-3333.

Each variant of this tool starts by attempting\nto create a socket, and then creates a new thread implementing a fairly complicated\nkeylogging facility not often seen, using Windows Keyboard Accelerators. Online\ncode demonstrates the technique here:\n\nhttp://thronic.com/Win32%20Keylogging/\n\nThe backdoor retrieves a large number of victim system data points, which it then uses\nto check in to its hardcoded C2. The backdoor reports system identification information\nboth to present the victim’s identifying information and to fingerprint the system for asset\nmanagement:\n\n- OS version\n\n- Service pack information\n\n- Processor speed\n\n- System name\n\n- Logged-on user name\n\n- OS install date\n\nOne of its more interesting features is the ability to fetch and use certificates from\nthe “My” store on Windows systems. The “My” certificate store is created on a peruser basis, and this is where users’ certificates are stored. It is reserved for each\nuser for signing and decrypting data and encrypting network communications.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nFeature list:\n\n- Victim fingerprinting and performance sensitivity – system configuration collection\n\n- Persistence – immediately identifying the Start Menu Startup directory and dropping\n\na LNK to its own executable disguised as a “Office Start”, “Yahoo Talk”, “MSN Gaming\nZ0ne”, or “MSN Talk” shortcut\n\n- Configurable network settings – both a primary and backup C2 string is hard-coded\n\nin each backdoor. At this point, we are aware of almost 50 domains and unique IP\naddresses used to host C2\n\n- Keylogging facility – Windows Accelerators with hidden window and lengthy\n\nAccelerator table\n\n- Flexible network connectivity – proxy support for use with victim systems situated\n\nbehind isolated networks\n\n- GET and POST network code for exfiltrating system information\n\n- Log file capabilities\n\n- File search and file write primitives – identifying and collecting sensitive ondisk\n\ninformation\n\n- Download and execute further arbitrary downloads\n\n- Arbitrary inter-process launch and communication through named pipes\n\n- Process privilege and token adjustments\n\n- Anti-malware kill-process identification and termination\n\n- Digital Certificate stealing and reuse for stealth SSL communications\n\n- Network server listener\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n#### WinMM\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File Size Compilation date Linker version\n\n\nc8c81cca4645e71213f2310cec6c277d %temp%\\wuauc1t.exe\n\n\n118,784 bytes 2012.11.01\n00:53:49\n\n\n6.0\n\n\nWinMM is a full-featured, simple backdoor. Its first actions upon installation are to col­\nlect user and system data and report them back to the C2 over http. It uses NetUser­\nGetInfo to identify that it is running under an “Admin” account on the local system,\nthen retrieves the system name and the version of the operating system that is running,\nincluding its service pack, and collects the system install date from the registry:\n\n\\\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\\nCurrentVersion\\InstallDate\n\nThese values are built into a single string for reporting.\n\nSslMM also maintains this code chunk and functionality but does not immediately\ninvoke it like winMM. Also interesting and different from sslMM, are the decoy Word\ndocuments dropped by many of the winMM droppers. Images of these documents\nare shown in the Appendix. The documents are all written and formatted with a spe­\ncially developed Myanmar2 True Type font, demonstrating the focus on politicallyconnected, native Myanmar speakers as targets. This font is not delivered by default\nwith Microsoft Office. Instead, it must have been specifically installed by the attackers\nand then by the victims, otherwise the documents would not have displayed properly.\n\nThe backdoor maintains multiple primitive functionalities.\n\nSetting a WH_CBT Windows hook for full activity spying (sslMM does not maintain\nthis hooking functionality):\n\n- File search and capture\n\n- Process creation\n\n- Keystroke capture\n\nThe backdoor is usually configured with primary and backup domains for C2\ncommunications, although there are multiple known samples that maintain\nan IP address or only a single domain for communications with no backup.\nCommunication is built to appear as though a web browser is simply making\na request to a remote web server. Some of these backdoors are configured\nto use an unusual port for encrypted communications.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n#### exe_exchange (used in attacks prior to ~2012)\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File Size Compilation date Linker version\n\n\n6a82c153bd370250cc2fed89f1bb5c91 %temp%\\services.exe\n\n\n69,632 bytes 2012-03-13\n07:54:19\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n#### INJECTv1/INJECTRESOURCE\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File Size Compilation date Linker version\n\n\nb295274423c91ad9e254475bf8edd459 wmiprive.exe\n\n\n159,744 bytes May 27, 2013\n\n\n#### The xsPlus/nokian backdoor and keylogger\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File Size Compilation date Linker version\n\n\nd86106faaa398b8d83437176bf5e39c4 281,624 bytes 2011.12.19\n08:06:30\n\n\n6.0\n\n\nIn 2014 the Naikon gang was found to be using another tool that maintains an internal\nname “xsPlus” and “xsControl”. This builder and its backdoors produce components\nwith the “NOKIAN95/WEBx” user-agent strings, for which there are multiple versions.\n[It’s functionality is covered in our previous Naikon APT post.](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/69953/the-naikon-apt/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### NAIKON AND MINOR LINKS WITH APT30\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the backdoor builder is that it also provides a keylogger\nplugin that is used on specific victim systems. And here there are minor, but striking,\nsimilarities with the APT30 tools.\n\nCallback sessions for stolen data include these URLs:\n\nPOST /stonehoof.rar/user=xxx&password=xxx\nGET /stonehoof.rar/user=xxx&password=xxx\n\nSome of the collector components upload data in SQLite3 format, while earlier versions\nof the tool upload xml formatted data. Presenting a similarity with the APT30 artifacts,\ntheir callback domains included stonehoof.com, hosted on several IPs during the naikon\ncampaigns. This name is very unusual, and it is an odd coincidence that it is shared by two\ngeopolitically-focused cyber-espionage groups, both targeting the South China Sea\nregion.\n\nAPT30 - stonehoof.com\n2012-10-07 208.77.46.251 174.36.159.165\n2013-04-03 174.36.159.165 219.90.115.251\n2013-04-14 219.90.115.251 174.36.159.164\n\nWhile the MsnMM components include the unusual “MM” in internal names sslMM,\nwinMM, and wininetMM, some of the strings in the APT30 GEMSTONE software include\nthe same – search and retrieval of the registry key “Software\\Microsoft\\GetMM”, and\nthree function names “MicrosoftGMMExit, MicrosoftGMMHaveExit, MicrosoftGMMZJ”.\nThe APT30 BACKSPACE backdoor also contains a similar potential target reference,\nas discussed in the FireEye paper.\n\n“BACKSPACE Variant Path Possible Target\nZJ Auto (version 1.4) /autoMM/ Myanmar”\n\nSo, the “MM” shared by both of these may be a simple reference to Myanmar, the starting\ntarget for these Naikon APT attacks.\n\nAPT30 backdoors also add “MSN.lnk” shortcuts to the Start Menu Startup location\nfor persistence, just like the MsnMM components spoof “Msn Gaming Zone.lnk”\nand “Msn Talk.lnk” for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n#### Sys10\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File Size Compilation date Linker version\n\n\nc58df5892700ac3f467524f86bf325c0 - update.exe 116.5 kb 2013.02.01\n07:39:12\n\n\n9.0\n\n\nYet another backdoor was used throughout 2013 by Naikon. Several of the C2\ndomains are shared with either Naikon or MsnMM infrastructure. This backdoor\nis a very basic initial component. To give an idea of the sophistication of its develop­\nment, one of the decryption schemes it uses is an xor 0x1 loop on the very begin­\nning of its .data section to decrypt its C2 domain. In this case, 6C 6C 6A 62 66 2F\n74 68 62 71 2F 6F 64 75 01 (lljbf/thbq/odu)  mmkcg.uicp.net.\n\nThis weak level of encryption is odd, because other strings, like the unicode version\nof the callback url “s.y.s.t.e.n.&.c.p.=.%.s.&.l.o.g.=.%.s.&.i.n.d.e.x.=.%.d.”, are maintained\nin plaintext in the .rdata section. Perhaps the authors thought xor’ing the domains\nwould hide their infrastructure for as long as needed, or they were working with\nothers who didn’t understand automated sandboxes and tracing but didn’t want\nthe dns strings present in the binary. It doesn’t seem to make sense, but it appears\nto have been effective enough to leave in the executables.\n\nFor all of the “Sys10” backdoors, URL parameters were used consistently for the initial\nC2 callback:\n\nsysten&cp=&log=&index=\n\nwhere: cp\u0007 = system computername\nlog = signed decimal integer representation of the OS InstallDate\nindex = simply the return value from a GetTickCount call\n\nThe backdoor collects several bits of identifying information to send to the C2:\n\n- computer name\n\n- account name of logged-in user\n\n- group name of logged-in user\n\n- local IP address\n\n- OS versioning information\n\n- OS install date\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nThe backdoor maintains a simple set of primitives:\n\n- http-based communications with hardcoded C2\n\n- download additional components\n\n- start a new process\n\n- terminate a running process\n\n- find files and copy them\n\n- delete files\n\n- create files\n\nWe detected this backdoor on multiple victim workstations with the following verdicts:\n\nTrojan.Win32.Agentb.hyb\nTrojan.Win32.Agentb.iqj\nBackdoor.Win32.MsnMM.p\nUDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic\nTrojan.Win32.Agentb.jwp\n\nAccording to KSN (Kaspersky Security Network)\ndata, almost all of the victims attacked with\nthis backdoor are based in Myanmar, or\nwere Myanmar delegates travelling through\nthe other countries like the US, for example.\nSome of the victims were located in Vietnam\nand Singapore. Victim profiles range from\nglobal political representatives and local IT\nservice companies, to government ministries\ncontrolling media and news content, university\nstudents, and local law enforcement agencies.\n\n#### WininetMM/Sakto\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File Size Compilation date Linker version\n\n\n516f64dd4fce3b9a325ea8501f97a88a 95,744 bytes 2014.11.03\n07:59:14\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### SECOND STAGE TOOLS\n\nMost of the Naikon APT’s second stage tools detected on victim networks are publiclyavailable.

Their ability to move through networks undisturbed appears to have\nmatured over time, demonstrating that they are a seasoned team:\n\n- Windows system utilities: ftp.exe, systeminfo.exe, ipconfig, net view, ping, netstat\n\n-ano, net use, quser, tasklist, netsh interface ip, netsh interface show, netsh\nadvfirewall firewall, reg export, AT\n\n- Sysinternals: procmon.exe, tcpview.exe, procexep.exe, psexec\n\n- Prosolve: winscan.exe\n\n- Rarlabs: rar.exe\n\n- Other: procex.exe, nc.exe, xscan.exe, winscanx.exe, hscan120.rar package (includes\n\nmysql.exe and sqlcmd.exe), cutfile.exe, tftp.exe, Win7 elevation of privilege and UAC\nbypass, ReadPSW.exe (password stealer)\n\nThe Naikon APT frequently used a custom backdoor that appears to be an HDoor\nvariant, based on old “Honker Union” code like “hscan v120”. For example, once\non a victim network, one of the first steps is to run the hdoor -hbs scan to identify\ntarget local network hosts. Alternatively, it may show up on victim networks and\nbe run with a long list of parameters:\n\n“lms.dat -hscan 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.254 /a”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### CUSTOM HDOOR\n\n\nMD5 – Filename File\nSize\n\n\nCompilation\ndate\n\n\nDetection Name\n\n\nbf6d3f52ab8176122be858ddccc22148 - lms.dat 56 kb 2015.05.20 HackTool.Win32.Agent.whj\n\n\nThe Naikon APT’s custom-built HDoor tool is a robust reconnaissance tool for lateral\nmovement, supporting the identification of, interfacing with and attacking of multiple\ntechnologies and resources:\n\n- host, user, group, and related authentication resources and cracking/brute forcing\n\ncapabilities\n\n- network asset scanning and identification, including SQL database, embedded\n\nnetwork devices like home or SMB routers, and other common network services\n\n- fake service listener to sniff traffic\n\n- disk wiping – safe delete with multiple overwrites\n\n- process management\n\n- local filetime modifier\n\n- SQL administration toolset\n\n- SOCKS5 proxy service\n\n- banner-based scanner\n\n- AV killer\n\nPublicly-available hd.exe (40138f3db14e6e137f8d0bdcbb5851d8), as posted by NCPH:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nThe corresponding hbs.txt output file content that is sometimes left behind on victim\nsystems:\n\nThe operator’s scanning is somewhat inconsistent. They will scan for a specific set\nof ports that include 21,22,80,3389,1433,3306, and 389. Sometimes, they add 139\nand 445 to the end of that list. Often, they check for a “PortString”, or banner, which\nis output to a txt file:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### TARGET AND VICTIM PROFILES\n\nTarget profiles included high profile government and military agencies around\nthe South China Sea:\n\n- Law enforcement\n\n- Government – executive, administrative, regulatory\n\n- Military – operations centers\n\n- Economic administration\n\n- State media\n\n- Public/Private energy\n\n- Shared Victims with Cycldek and Comparing Lateral Movement with Cycldek\n\nThe Cycldek APT appeared to follow an operational script across victim systems.\nIt created or used c:\\intel on the victim hard disk to unpack tools and compress/\narchive stolen victim files and data with Winrar, like \"c:\\intel\\1.rar\". Some of these\nvictim systems were occupied by both the Cycldec and Naikon attackers.\n\nThe Cycldek attackers maintained this c:\\intel directory and its subdirectories as a sort\nof staging point. This mirrors what we have seen with Naikon directory setup on some\nvictims.\n\n- a set of subdirectories\n\n- stolen files for exfiltration\n\n- operational logs\n\n- process logs\n\n- Cycldek tools and their config files\n\nThe Naikon APT and Cycldek APT also share a common attraction to Honker Union\ncodebase.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\n### SPEAR-PHISH, DROPPED FILES, WEB BROWSER INJECTION\n\nThe common sequence of events on a vulnerable system falling for related spearphish attacks led to a newly-created Internet Explorer process running with execution\ntransferred to additionally loaded executable code, usually profile.dat, maintaining\nthe connectback C2 communication code and data.\n\nIn this instance, a “naikon backdoor” was delivered initially as a part of a small package\nof objects. The exploit attachment dropped iph.bat, iExplorer.exe, and a clean decoy\ndocument. The exploit executed this batch file, which in turn executed iExplorer.exe\nand opened a decoy document from %temp%. The iExplorer.exe process wrote out\na profile.dat file, launched the legitimate Internet Explorer, and injected the .dat file\ninto this newly created browser process. It transfered control to the injected .dat code\nand terminated itself. The .dat code then connected with a hardcoded C2 from within\nInternet Explorer, a common technique for evading any outbound traffic firewall issues.\n\nThe full email spear-phish and other decoy documents’ content presented here display\nthe campaigns’ focus on ASEAN targets that line up with the MsnMM campaigns.\n\nExample spear-phish and dropped sequence for NOKIAN95/WEB sent to web email\nservice provider users in the US and Southeastern Asian region:\n\nExample Word document decoy\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nExample details, exhibiting the “common” sequence of events on systems:\n\nc334737ea5e8f74567bfdc2fce6717b9,2 SpecialServices.doc\n\nDrops  \u0007%temp%\\iph.bat\n\nc8ed40879e1e3352692fe8c765294955,%temp%\\svchost.exe\nc8ed40879e1e3352692fe8c765294955,C:\\WINDOWS\\\nsystem32\\ymsgr_tray.exe\n\nC2: frankhere.oicp.net:443\n\n1b37457632840b04bf03e0745e51e573,readme.rtf\n\nDrops  \u0007%temp%\\iph.bat  %temp%\\iExplorer.exe WMcal\n\n6cbc73fae7118dbd0fae328ce8ee6050,iExplorer.exe,TrojanDownloader.Win32.Cordmix.cu\nC2: phsenator.vicp.net\nC2: goihang.vicp.net:443\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nExample decoy Word document\n\ncb72e70378755f1e8ab744a5b5e692bd,Asia’s Military Developments.doc (ripped from\n[“Australian Strategic Policy Institute” blog post located here – http://www.aspistrategist.](http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/asias-military-developments/)\n[org.au/asias-military-developments/)](http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/asias-military-developments/)\n\n638c119a82a1b1d470e42e2e9712f3fb,iph.bat\n79de618615e139053ad92ca1e7bb7456,C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Local Settings\\\nTemp\\mshtml.dat\n\n4299846c34fddda2f5a75239f8aca424,C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\upd.exe\nRpcss\n\na3b3a32b6f67e4629133cc4578230efe,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\msictl.exe\n\nC2: us.googlereader.pw:443\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nExample decoy pdf targeting Myanmar government\n\n5f1f6fb3cea3e9c3bd84909b7d37aa8d, ”knu president speech on 65th anniversary of\nkaren resistance day _burmese language_?fdp.scr”  indicates RTLO naming, appeared\nto the target as pdf “knu president speech on 65th anniversary of karen resistance day\n_burmese language_rcs.pdf”\n\n55b8b8779001b7e78a6adc55fb546401,C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\update.exe\n\n8660193a90e70f19a4419ae09306761f,C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\adobe.pdf\n\nC2: ubaoyouxiang.gicp.net\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns TLP White\n\nExample decoy Word document targeting PH gov\n\n27ed7c7dd840ff7936418cf029d56603,\nAFP Summary.doc à  \u0007temp%\\iph.bat\n\nceb6e4499cfd8650f3e94fbcf7de48f6,%temp%\\iExplorer.exe WMcal\nb6424852dd0187ea554a1cbc4e3490f3,%temp%\\profile.dat\n\nC2: ttteco.vicp.net\n\nMany of these backdoors were delivered by simply binding decoy pdfs to\na Naikon backdoor and sending this bundle to target addresses.
