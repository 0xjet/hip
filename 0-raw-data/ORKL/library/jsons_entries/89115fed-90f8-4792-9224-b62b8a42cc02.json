This installer then launches a script that is also\nheavily obfuscated, which is capable of detecting sandboxes and AV emulation, so it won't\nexecute when run on the researcher's devices.\n\n**Obfuscated code of Cryptbot**\n\n_Source: Red Canary_\nMoreover, Cryptobot checks for the presence of \"%APPDATA%\\Ramson,\" and executes its\nself-deletion routine if the folder exists to prevent re-infection.\n\nThe injection of the Cryptbot bytes into memory occurs through the process hollowing\nmethod, while the malware's operational features overlap with previous research findings.\n\nIn summary, Cryptbot is capable of collecting sensitive data from the following apps:\n\nAtomic cryptocurrency wallet\nAvast Secure web browser\nBrave browser\nLedger Live cryptocurrency wallet\n\n\n-----\n\nOpera Web Browser\nWaves Client and Exchange cryptocurrency applications\nCoinomi cryptocurrency wallet\nGoogle Chrome web browser\nJaxx Liberty cryptocurrency wallet\nElectron Cash cryptocurrency wallet\nElectrum cryptocurrency wallet\nExodus cryptocurrency wallet\nMonero cryptocurrency wallet\nMultiBitHD cryptocurrency wallet\nMozilla Firefox web browser\nCCleaner web browser\nVivaldi web browser\n\nBecause Cryptbot’s operation doesn’t rely on the existence of unencrypted binaries on the\ndisk, detecting it is only possible by monitoring for malicious behavior such as PowerShell\ncommand execution or external network communication.\n\nRed Canary shares the following four key points for threat detection:\n\nbinaries containing AutoIT metadata but don’t have “AutoIT” in their filenames\nAutoIT processes making external network connections\nfindstr commands similar to findstr /V /R “^ … $\nPowerShell or cmd.exe commands containing rd /s /q, timeout, and del /f /q together\n\nIn summary, if you thought that KSMPico is a smart way to save on unnecessary licensing\n[costs, the above illustrates why that's a bad idea.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/683336/infected-with-malware-after-trying-to-install-kmspico/)\n\n[The reality is that the loss of revenue due to incident response, ransomware attacks, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/meet-stop-ransomware-the-most-active-ransomware-nobody-talks-about/)\ncryptocurrency theft from installing pirated software could be more than the cost of the actual\nWindows and Office licenses.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Popular NFT marketplace Rarible targeted by scammers and malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/popular-nft-marketplace-rarible-targeted-by-scammers-and-malware/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[New malware targets serverless AWS Lambda with cryptominers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-malware-targets-serverless-aws-lambda-with-cryptominers/)\n\n[Verblecon malware loader used in stealthy crypto mining attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verblecon-malware-loader-used-in-stealthy-crypto-mining-attacks/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\n\n-----\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
