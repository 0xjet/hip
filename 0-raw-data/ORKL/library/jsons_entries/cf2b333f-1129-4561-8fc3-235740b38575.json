Back in 2014[2] and 2017,[3] we wrote about the various attack vectors\n\n and methodologies of this advanced persistent threat (APT) group, which is also\n\n known as APT28, Strontium, and Fancy Bear. Over the years, we have unraveled\n\n how the group has employed spear-phishing emails, phishing sites, and malicious\n\n iframes, and how it targeted entities ranging from the defense industry and\n\n international organizations to media and political parties. Today, Pawn Storm\n\n continues to deploy malware against its targets, but it has also been seen directly\n\n attacking web and cloud services instead of taking the more common route of\n\n infecting targets through spear phishing.\n\n Pawn Storm is a group that has shown ample resources and multifold strategies\n\n in its operations. The group has targeted many organizations, harvested\n\n considerable information, and attempted to influence mainstream media and\n\n public opinion. Due to Pawn Storm’s notoriety, its attack methods have been\n\n well-documented. The threat actors behind Pawn Storm have used sophisticated\n\n social engineering lures, data-stealing malware, several zero-days, and even a\n\n private exploit kit.\n\n This report aims to shed light on some of Pawn Storm’s attacks that did not\n\n use malware in the initial stages. It presents new data on the group’s credential\n\n phishing, direct probing of webmail and Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover servers,\n\n and large-scale scanning activities to search for vulnerable servers. Among the\n\n group’s prominent targets were members of defense companies, embassies,\n\n governments, and the military. We will also disclose how we were able to track\n\n Pawn Storm’s credential phishing campaigns over the past two years through\n\n careful analysis of DNS SPF requests of domain names used to name some of\n\n their computer server images.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Abusing High-Profile Email Addresses for Spam\n\nWe have been closely following waves of the group’s targeted credential phishing attacks and have\n\ncollected thousands of email samples that the Pawn Storm actors sent out since 2014. This data allowed\n\nus to see new trends in Pawn Storm’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nFor instance, in May 2019, we observed something interesting: Pawn Storm started using hacked email\n\naddresses of numerous high-profile targets to send credential spam messages.\n\n**Pawn Storm spammer**\n\nCommercially-shared VPN Dedicated server\n\nUDP packets\nto port 1194\n\nOpenVPN\n\nTCP 993/ Compromised\nTCP 465 credentials\n\n|Commercially-shared VPN Dedicated serve|Dedicated serve|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|UDP packets to port 1194 OpenVPN TCP 993/ Comp TCP 465 crede Sends emails|||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n\n\n**Targets**\n\n\nCommercial email server\n\n\nFigure 1. The setup Pawn Storm frequently used to send credential phishing spam in 2019\n\nThe actor connects to a dedicated server using the OpenVPN option of a commercial VPN provider\n\nand then uses compromised email credentials to send out credential spam via a commercial email\n\nservice provider. The group used this scheme over an extended period in 2019 to 2020, with the most\n\ncompromised email accounts belonging to defense companies in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### United Arab Emirates\n\n India\n\n Pakistan\n\n Jordan\n\n United States\n\n Others\n\n\n###### 45%\n\n 9%\n\n 8%\n\n 7%\n\n 5%\n\n 26%\n\n\nFigure 2. Breakdown of abused email servers for the period of May to December 2019, sorted by country\n\nThe reason for the shift to the use of compromised email accounts of (mostly) defense companies in the\n\nMiddle East is unclear. Pawn Storm could be attempting to evade spam filtering at the cost of making\n\nsome of their successful compromises known to security companies. However, we did not notice a\n\nsignificant change in successful inbox deliveries of the group’s spam campaigns, making it difficult to\n\nunderstand the rationale behind the change in methodology.\n\n\n###### Defense\n\n Banking\n\n Construction\n\n Government\n\n Automotive\n\n Airline\n\n Others\n\n\n###### 38%\n\n 11%\n\n 9%\n\n 8%\n\n 7%\n\n 7%\n\n 20%\n\n\nFigure 3. Breakdown of abused email addresses, sorted by industry for the period of May to December 2019\n\nFigure 3 shows the breakdown of industries whose email addresses were abused to send out credential\n\nphishing spam. How Pawn Storm could be getting the email credentials of their targets is a point of\n\ninterest. Malware could have been utilized to achieve this, but the group could also be using a method\n\nthat involves brute-force attacks.\n\nIn 2019, Pawn Storm performed daily probes on numerous email servers and Microsoft Exchange\n\nAutodiscover servers across the world. The actor group was connecting to a variety of Transmission\n\nControl Protocol (TCP) ports that were related to email. We observed that most of the probing were aimed\n\n\n-----\n\nat TCP port 443 (used by webmail and Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover services), while email protocols\n\nlike the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) [143, 993], the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) [110, 995],\n\nand the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [465, 587] were also checked.\n\nThis was done in an apparent attempt to look for vulnerable systems, brute force credentials, exfiltrate\n\nemail data, and send out spam waves. We have data on months of probing against hundreds of email\n\nservers worldwide and can thus make semi-statistical breakdowns by industry and by country or region.\n\nThese breakdowns strongly depend on the different interests of Pawn Storm that vary over time.\n\nBelow we listed a sample of Pawn Storm’s typical targets from August 2019 to November 2019.\n\n**First Probe** **Last Probe** **Target** **Region**\n\n8/2/19 8/2/19 Defense company Southern Europe\n\n8/5/19 8/5/19 Civil aviation authority Africa\n\n8/7/19 8/7/19 Airport Africa\n\n8/7/19 8/7/19 Government Southern Europe\n\n**8/15/19** **8/21/19** **Military** **South America**\n\n**8/16/19** **8/22/19** **Government** **Middle East**\n\n8/28/19 8/28/19 Law firm Germany\n\n8/29/19 8/29/19 Aeronautics company Europe\n\n9/2/19 9/2/19 Private school France\n\n9/2/19 9/6/19 Railway company Eastern Europe\n\n9/2/19 9/7/19 Oil and gas company UK\n\n9/2/19 9/8/19 Bank US\n\n9/3/19 9/9/19 Academic institution South America\n\n9/6/19 9/9/19 Multinational electronics company Asia\n\n9/7/19 9/7/19 Nutrition company UK\n\n9/8/19 9/8/19 Political party The Nordics\n\n10/3/19 10/3/19 Group of surgeons Australia\n\n10/3/19 10/3/19 IT company France\n\n10/3/19 10/3/19 Private school UK\n\n10/4/19 10/4/19 IT company Netherlands\n\nTable 1. The nature of organizations that had their email server scanned by Pawn Storm\n\n(mail, Autodiscover on port 443 and/or IMAP on port 993)\n\nFor the entries in red, we suspect Pawn Storm performed large-scale data exfiltration, based on\n\nthe significant amount of data that was transferred in those timeframes and the duration of the\n\nconnections made.\n\nWe found some of the group’s typical targets in the list, such as armed forces, defense companies,\n\ngovernments, law firms, political parties, and universities. Surprisingly, the list also included a couple of\n\nprivate schools in France and the United Kingdom, and even a kindergarten in Germany.\n\n|First Probe 8/2/19 8/5/19 8/7/19 8/7/19 8/15/19 8/16/19 8/28/19 8/29/19 9/2/19 9/2/19 9/2/19 9/2/19 9/3/19 9/6/19 9/7/19 9/8/19 10/3/19 10/3/19 10/3/19 10/4/19|Last Probe 8/2/19 8/5/19 8/7/19 8/7/19 8/21/19 8/22/19 8/28/19 8/29/19 9/2/19 9/6/19 9/7/19 9/8/19 9/9/19 9/9/19 9/7/19 9/8/19 10/3/19 10/3/19 10/3/19 10/4/19|Target Defense company Civil aviation authority Airport Government Military Government Law firm Aeronautics company Private school Railway company Oil and gas company Bank Academic institution Multinational electronics company Nutrition company Political party Group of surgeons IT company Private school IT company|Region Southern Europe Africa Africa Southern Europe South America Middle East Germany Europe France Eastern Europe UK US South America Asia UK The Nordics Australia France UK Netherlands|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Not-so-Subtle Scanning of Servers\n\nPawn Storm appeared to do large-scale scans on TCP ports 445 and 1433 as well, but in a way that\n\nwasn’t subtle. The same IP address that has been hosting some of Pawn Storm’s websites (for phishing\n\nfree webmail credentials of high-profile users) has been scanning port 445 and port 1433 of computer\n\nservers across the world. This appears to be an attempt to find vulnerable servers running Microsoft SQL\n\nServer and Directory Services.\n\n\n###### Europe\n\n United States\n\n Asia\n\n South America\n\n Africa\n\n Middle East\n\n\n###### 50%\n\n 37%\n\n 7%\n\n 3%\n\n 2%\n\n 1%\n\n\nFigure 4. Breakdown of Pawn Storm’s port scans on target IP address (via port 445), by country/region\n\nThe scans were done from the IP address 185.245.85[.]178 from November until December 2019. It\n\nshould be noted that the exact statistics could differ in other time ranges because the targets of Pawn\n\nStorm’s scanning depend on specific campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Europe\n\n Asia\n\n United States\n\n Middle East\n\n South America\n\n Africa\n\n\n###### 65%\n\n 13%\n\n 12%\n\n 4%\n\n 4%\n\n 2%\n\n\nFigure 5. Breakdown of Pawn Storm’s port scans on target IP address (via port 1433), by country/region\n\nThe scans were done from the IP address 185.245.85[.]178 from November to December 2019. Similarly,\n\nthe exact statistics will be different for other time ranges because the targets of Pawn Storm’s scanning\n\ndepend on specific campaigns that have a start and an end.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credential Phishing Attacks via DNS SPF Requests\n\nFor over two years, we were able to observe a significant number of Pawn Storm’s credential phishing\n\ncampaigns through careful analysis of DNS SPF (Sender Policy Framework) requests of the domains\n\nthey used. In the spring of 2017, we noticed that the Pawn Storm actors had assigned particular domain\n\nnames to some of their server images. These servers were repeatedly used to send credential phishing\n\nspam emails to high-profile targets that used free webmail services.\n\nPawn Storm did not bother to register these domain names though, so we took the opportunity to register\n\nthem and possibly get more information on their operations. We set up an infrastructure to passively log\n\nall DNS requests for the five domain names. (It is worth noting that Pawn Storm has since ceased to use\n\nthese five domains since summer of 2019; the group has been using a generic server named server[.]com\n\nat the time of writing.)\n\nFigure 6. Pawn Storm uses particular domain names during the EHLO command\n\nin the email protocol sessions of many of its credential phishing campaigns\n\nSome of the domain names, which were free to register in 2017, refer to the internal naming of Pawn\n\nStorm’s server images. This enabled Trend Micro to gather data on the group’s credential phishing\n\ncampaigns from 2017 to 2019. It appears that receiving email servers send DNS SPF requests for the\n\ndomain names used in the Extended HELO (EHLO) command as part of their spam filtering algorithms.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese campaigns included spam waves against two U.S.-based free webmail providers, one Russian free\n\nwebmail provider, and one Iranian webmail provider. Pawn Storm’s continued use of the domain names\n\nalso put the actor at risk of revealing some of their other operations, such as moving around their server\n\nimage from one IP address to another and management tasks of the server.\n\nEven for an advanced threat actor like Pawn Storm, it takes a lot of discipline to prevent leaks related to\n\nDNS requests outside of careful VPN connection setups that obscure their home base.\n\n\n**Pawn Storm spammer**\n\n\n\n[spambox].com\nShared VPN owned by Pawn Storm\n\nDNS request logging\n\n\nDNS SPF DNS SPF DNS SPF DNS SPF\n\n**Mail servers**\n\nFigure 7. The setup we used to monitor Pawn Storm’s email campaigns for more than two years\n\nPawn Storm regularly uses the OpenVPN option of commercial VPN service providers to connect to a\n\ndedicated host that sends out spam. The dedicated spam-sending servers used particular domain names\n\nin the EHLO command of the SMTP sessions with the targets’ mail servers.\n\n|DNS SPF DNS SPF|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n||||\n\n\n-----\n\n40\n\n0 JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB\n2017 2018 2019\n\nFigure 8. Yahoo phishing campaigns by Pawn Storm from late June 2017 to early March 2019\n\nFigure 8 shows the credential phishing campaigns against Yahoo users, coming from a particular server\n\nimage owned by Pawn Storm. It is measured by incoming DNS SPF requests. The vertical axis uses a\n\nlogarithmic scale.\n\nWe could correlate the statistics of email campaigns derived from our DNS monitoring with the email\n\nsamples we gathered over the years. Although our dataset of actual emails is smaller, the two datasets\n\nwere consistent with each other.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion and Security Recommendations\n\nIf our previous reports on Pawn Storm is any indication, the threat actor group has plenty of resources\n\nthat allow them to run lengthy campaigns, determined in the pursuit of their targets. Their attacks, which\n\nrange from compromising DNS settings and tabnabbing[4] to creating watering holes and taking advantage\n\nof zero-days,[5] have been nothing short of sophisticated. And as evidenced by their recent activities, we\n\nexpect even more direct attacks against webmail and cloud services that don’t rely on malware.\n\nWe have seen Pawn Storm’s activities since 2004, and we expect the threat actor group to be active for\n\nyears to come. Since Pawn Storm uses a wide range of tools and tactics, organizations must secure their\n\nperimeter to reduce the risks from any potential entry or jump-off points. Here are some measures users\n\nand organizations can take to defend against Pawn Storm’s methods:\n\n- **Enforce the principle of least privilege. Minimize risks in the network by limiting traffic, enabling**\n\nonly the services needed, and disabling those that are outdated or unused.\n\n- **Mind the security gaps. Keep the system updated and its applications patched, create strong patch**\n\nmanagement policies, and consider virtual patching[6] for known and unknown vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Regularly monitor the infrastructure. Aside from employing firewalls, incorporate intrusion detection**\n\nand prevention systems that inspect traffic in real-time and automatically remediate vulnerable\n\nsystems.[7]\n\n- **Require two-factor authentication. Corporate email accounts, network access, and outsourced**\n\nservices should have multiple authentication measures when used.\n\n- **Educate employees. Raise awareness of phishing techniques and common attack vectors and**\n\nprohibit the use of personal webmail and social media accounts for work purposes.\n\n- **Maintain data integrity. Regularly back up data and encrypt stored sensitive information.**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n|IP addresses 185.245.85[.]178 81.19.210[.]149 82.118.242[.]171 172.111.161[.]232 89.238.178[.]14 185.227.68[.]214|First 8/4/19 5/22/19 10/1/19 9/26/19 9/20/19 12/1/19|Last 12/17/19 9/20/19 12/9/19 10/7/19 12/9/19 2/18/20|Activity Phishing; scanning for port 445 and 1433 Spam; scanning (webmail) Scanning (webmail) Spam VPN use Phishing and scanning|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Domains 0xf4a54cf56[.]tk 0xf4a5[.]tk id24556[.]tk 546874[.]tk id6589[.]com id451295[.]com change-password[.]ml 0x4fc271[.]tk yahoo-change-password[.]com|Activity Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing Credential phishing|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### References\n\n1 Trend Micro.
