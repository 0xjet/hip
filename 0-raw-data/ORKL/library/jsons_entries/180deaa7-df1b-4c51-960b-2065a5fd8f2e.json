The HSE\nconsists of approximately 4,000 locations, 54 acute\nhospitals and over 70,000 devices (PCs, laptops,\netc). Services are provided through both community\ndelivered care and care provided through the hospital\nsystem as well as the national ambulance service.\nCorporate services and other services that support\nhealthcare delivery are provided through the national\ncentre.\n\nThe HSE is the largest employer in the Irish state, with\nover 130,000 staff including direct employees and\nthose employed by organisations funded by the HSE[1].\nIt therefore comprises an extensive community who\nare increasingly dependent on connected and reliable\nInformation Technology (“IT”) solutions and varying\nlevels of IT support from the HSE national centre\nto deliver clinical services. This includes the HSE’s\nnational IT infrastructure. The HSE is classified as a\ncritical infrastructure operator under the EU Network\nand Information Security Directive (“NISD”)[2], also\nknown as an Operator of Essential Services (“OES”).\n\n###### Introduction to the Incident\n\nIn the early hours of Friday 14 May 2021, the HSE\nwas subjected to a serious cyber attack, through the\ncriminal infiltration of their IT systems (PCs, servers,\netc.) using Conti ransomware. The HSE invoked its\nCritical Incident Process, which began a sequence of\nevents leading to the decision to switch off all HSE\nIT systems and disconnect the National Healthcare\nNetwork (“NHN”) from the internet, in order to attempt\nto contain and assess the impact of the cyber\nattack[3]. These actions removed the threat actor’s (the\n“Attacker”) access to the HSE’s environment.\n\nThis immediately resulted in healthcare professionals\nlosing access to all HSE provided IT systems including patient information systems, clinical\ncare systems and laboratory systems. Non-clinical\nsystems such as financial systems, payroll and\nprocurement systems were also lost. Significant\n\n\ndisruption immediately occurred and many healthcare\nprofessionals had to revert to pen and paper to\ncontinue patient care. Healthcare services across\nthe country were severely disrupted with real and\nimmediate consequences for the thousands of people\nwho require health services every day.\n\nNormal communication channels, both at HSE’s\nnational centre and within operational services\nwere also immediately lost. This included email\nand networked phone lines. Staff switched to\ncommunicating using mobile and analogue phones;\nfax; and face to face meetings.\n\nThe aim of the Attacker was to disrupt health services\nand IT systems, steal data, and demand a ransom for\nthe non-publication of stolen data and provision of a\ntool to restore access to data they had encrypted.\n\nThe HSE initially requested the assistance of the\nGarda National Cyber Crime Bureau, the International\nCriminal Police Organisation (“Interpol”) and the\nNational Cyber Security Centre (“NCSC”) to support\nthe response. The ransomware created ransom notes\nwith instructions on how to contact the Attacker. The\nAttacker also posted a message on an internet chat\nroom on the dark web, with a link to several samples\nof data reportedly stolen from the HSE. The HSE and\nthe Irish Government confirmed on the day of the\nattack that they would not pay a ransom[4].\n\nThe Incident had a far greater and more protracted\nimpact on the HSE than initially expected, with\nrecovery efforts continuing for over four months.[5]\n\n###### Growing threat of cyber attacks\n\nCybercrime is increasing in frequency, magnitude\nand sophistication, with cybercriminals easily\noperating across jurisdictions and country borders.\nThese incidents can cause major damage to safety\nand the economy[6]. As outlined in Ireland’s National\nCyber Security Strategy, 2019-2024, “recent years\n_have seen the development and regular use of_\n_very advanced tools for cyber enabled attacks and_\n_espionage, and, likely for the first time, the physical_\n_destruction of Critical National Infrastructure by cyber_\n_enabled means”[7]. In April 2020, Interpol, warned_\nthat cybercriminals were targeting critical healthcare\ninstitutions with ransomware[8].\n\n\n1 Health Service Employment Report: August 2021\n2 This occurred in July 2016. See NIS Compliance Guidelines for Operators of Essential Service\n3 Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance and Admin V1.10 31052021\n4 https://www2.hse.ie/services/cyber-attack/how-it-may-affect-you.html\n5 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n6 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_13_94\n7 National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf\n8 https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-healthcare-institutions-withransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware attacks have risen significantly over the\nlast few years. Whilst precise figures on the number\nof ransomware victims are not available, there are\nstatistics that indicate the rate of growth of these\nattacks. For example, the US agency FinCEN’s[9]\nanalysis of ransomware-related Suspicious Activity\nReports (SARs) filed during the first half of 2021\nindicates that $590 million[10] was paid in ransomwarerelated transactions (likely representing payments\noriginating from the US to ransomware groups),\nwhich exceeds the value reported for the entirety of\n2020 ($416 million).\n\nDespite claims by ransomware groups that they\nwould not seek to harm people, there are several\nrecent examples of attacks against healthcare\nproviders. Hospitals including St. Lawrence Health\nSystem (USA), Sonoma Valley Hospital (USA), and\nSky Lakes Medical Center (USA), all reported that\nthey were impacted by ransomware attacks in 2020.\nOn 20 May 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(“FBI”) identified at least 16 Conti ransomware\nattacks targeting US healthcare[11]. Healthcare\norganisations that have been the target of similar\nattacks this year include, Waikato District Health\nBoard, New Zealand (May 2021), Eskenazi Health,\nUSA (August 2021), Memorial Health System, USA\n(August 2021) and Macquarie Health Corporation,\nAustralia (October 2021). More recently, much of the\nprovincial healthcare system in Newfoundland was\nimpacted by a cyber attack (November 2021). The\nransomware attack against the HSE would appear\nto be the first occurrence of an entire national health\nservice being impacted by such an attack.\n\n###### Scope of our review\n\nIn June 2021, PwC was commissioned by the Board\nof the HSE, in conjunction with the Chief Executive\nOfficer (“CEO”) and the Executive Management Team\n(“EMT”), to conduct an independent post incident\nreview (“PIR”) to urgently establish the facts in relation\nto the HSE’s technical and operational preparedness\nfor an incident of this nature; and to identify the\nlearnings from this Incident both for the HSE and\nfor State and non-State organisations to inform their\nfuture preparedness. We initially undertook a scoping\nphase, to develop our understanding of the Incident\nand our approach to the review, followed by the PIR\nengagement which was conducted over a 14 week\nperiod.\n\nWe took a sample approach to review the\ninvolvement of the hospitals and Community\nHealthcare Organisations (“CHO”) within the HSE’s\n\n\ncommunity, focusing on how the HSE’s strategy was\nimplemented at tactical levels and the effectiveness\nof the HSE’s coordination of efforts.\n\nThis is a complex PIR. In recognition of this\ncomplexity, we brought together an experienced\nmulti-disciplinary team of international cybersecurity\nand crisis management specialists. Our team\nincluded forensic investigation and response, IT\n/ cybersecurity, crisis management, culture and\nbehaviour, and regulatory experts with extensive\nexperience in cybersecurity PIRs.\n\n###### Timeline of the Incident\n\nOn 18 March 2021, the source of the cyber-attack[12]\noriginated from a malicious software (“Malware”)\ninfection on a HSE workstation (the “Patient Zero\nWorkstation”). The Malware infection was the result\nof the user of the Patient Zero Workstation clicking\nand opening a malicious Microsoft Excel file that was\nattached to a phishing email sent to the user on 16\nMarch 2021.\n\nAfter gaining unauthorised access to the HSE’s\nIT environment on 18 March 2021, the Attacker\ncontinued to operate in the environment over\nan eight week period until the detonation of the\nConti ransomware on 14 May 2021. This included\ncompromising and abusing a significant number\nof accounts with high levels of privileges (typically\nrequired for performing administrative tasks),\ncompromising a significant number of servers,\nexfiltrating data and moving laterally to statutory and\nvoluntary hospitals.\n\nThe Incident was not identified and contained until\nafter the detonation of the Conti ransomware on 14\nMay 2021, which caused widespread IT disruption.\nThere were several detections of the Attacker’s\nactivity prior to 14 May 2021, but these did not result\nin a cybersecurity incident and investigation initiated\nby the HSE and as a result opportunities to prevent\nthe successful detonation of the ransomware were\nmissed. The key events from 18 March 2021 to 14\nMay 2021 are set out in the diagram overleaf.\n\n\n9 www.fincen.gov\n10 https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/Financial%20Trend%20Analysis_Ransomware%20508%20FINAL.pdf\n11 https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210521.pdf\n12 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Summary Timeline 18 March - 14 May 2021**\n\n\nIn the early hours of 14 May 2021, the HSE identified that they had been a victim of a cyberattack and they\nbegan to mobilise a response, drawing on their experiences from previous crises, including COVID-19. The key\nresponse and recovery events from 14 May 2021 are set out in the diagram below.\n\n\n**Figure 2: Summary Timeline 14 May - 21 September 2021**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HSE was assisted by the Defence Forces and\nthe NCSC as well as third parties in the early weeks\nof the Incident, to provide structure to the response\nactivities. The response teams could not initially focus\non the highest priority response and recovery tasks\ndue to the lack of preparedness for a widespread\ndisruptive IT event e.g. through not having a preprepared list of prioritised clinical systems and\napplications to focus their efforts.\n\nOn 15 May 2021, the HSE senior management set\nup a war room at a third party’s office building on\nMolesworth Street. On 20 May 2021, the Defence\nForces attended Molesworth Street for further\ndiscussions around the level of support that was\nrequired by the HSE during the response and\nrecovery phases of the Incident and on 21 May 2021,\nthe HSE set up a physical situation centre (“SitCen”)\nin CityWest to manage the response and recovery.\nThe HSE engaged a third party Incident Response\norganisation (“HSE’s Incident Response provider’’) to\ninvestigate the cyber attack.\n\nOn 20 May 2021, the HSE secured a High Court\ninjunction[13] restraining any sharing, processing,\nselling or publishing of data stolen from its computer\nsystems. On the same day, the Attacker posted a\nlink to a key that would decrypt files encrypted by\nthe Conti ransomware. The HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider validated that the decryption key worked\non 21 May 2021 and provided it to the HSE, allowing\nthem to gain access to the data that had been\nencrypted by the Conti ransomware. Without the\ndecryption key, it is unknown whether systems could\nhave been recovered fully or how long it would have\ntaken to recover systems from backups, but it is\nhighly likely that the recovery timeframe would have\nbeen considerably longer.\n\nFrom 22 May 2021 onward, the HSE Information and\nCommunications Technology (“ICT”) team moved\nfrom the response phase into the recovery phase,\nwhere they focused their efforts on decrypting\nsystems, cleansing workstations, restoring\nsystems and the recovery of applications. The HSE\nrecovered their primary identity systems (\nActive Directory (“AD”) domain) within days of the\nIncident, but decryption of servers and acute and\ncommunity services applications took place largely\nover the following three months. By 21 September\n2021, the HSE had recovered all servers and 1,075\napplications, out of a total of 1,087 applications[14].\n\nAt the time of issuing this report, the HSE had notified\nthe Data Protection Commissioner (“DPC”) in relation\nto the Incident, however, they have not made any\n\n\ndata subject notifications for personal data exposure\nor exfiltration. The HSE’s Legal and Data workstream\ncontinues to work closely with the DPC in relation to\nthis matter.\n\n###### Mitigating factors impacting on the Incident\n\nThere were a number of mitigating factors which had\na considerable effect in reducing the severity and\nimpact of the Incident.\n\n**Relative simplicity of the attack and the release of**\n**the decryption key**\n\nBased on the forensic examination of the Attacker’s\nactivity, it would appear that the Attacker used\nrelatively well-known techniques and software to\nexecute their attack. A more sophisticated attack\nmay have involved gathering intelligence in advance,\nbefore it could be successfully and subtly exploited.\nThe impact of the Incident on the HSE and health\nservices could have been significantly greater, with far\nmore severe clinical impact. Some examples of this\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n\n**•** if there had been intent by the Attacker to target\nspecific devices within the HSE environment (e.g.\nmedical devices);\n\n**•** if the ransomware took actions to destroy data at\nscale;\n\n**•** if the ransomware had auto-propagation and\npersistence capabilities, for example by using\nan exploit to propagate across domains and\ntrust-boundaries to medical devices (e.g. the\nEternalBlue exploit used by the WannaCry and\nNotPetya[15] attacks);\n\n**•** if cloud systems had also been encrypted such as\nthe COVID-19 vaccination system.\n\nAn additional mitigating factor was the release of the\ndecryption key by the Attackers on 20 May 2021,\nwhich allowed for an accelerated recovery process.\nIt is unclear how much data would have been\nunrecoverable if a decryption key had not become\navailable as the HSE’s backup infrastructure was only\nperiodically backed up to offline tape. Therefore it is\nhighly likely that segments of data for backup would\nhave remained encrypted, resulting in significant data\nloss. It is also likely to have taken considerably longer\nto recover systems without the decryption key.\n\n\n13 https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/order-perfected-20-may-2021.pdf\n14 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n15 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A\n\n\n-----\n\n**Significant ‘in-the moment’ efforts in response to**\n**the Incident**\n\nA recurring theme observed throughout the PIR was\nthe dedication and effort observed at all levels during\nthe response to the Incident. This included individuals\nfrom across the HSE, impacted hospitals, CHOs, and\nthird parties all going “above and beyond” in their\ncall of duty. This illustrates that, in times of significant\nchallenge or emergencies, staff in the health services\nare resilient, respond quickly, and have an ability to\nimplement actions and workarounds to maintain even\na basic continuity of service to their patients.\n\n**National support**\n\nThe impact of the Incident was at a national scale\nwhich encouraged support and presence from other\nstate agencies and third parties, who provided\nstructure, governance, technical expertise and\nresources to assist the response and recovery.\n\n**Lessons learned from COVID-19 and previous IT**\n**disruptions**\n\nWhilst the HSE had not previously encountered\nan incident of this scale, they have been exposed\nto other significant incidents both directly (e.g\nCOVID-19) and through observations of ransomware\nattacks on other healthcare organisations globally\n(e.g WannaCry ransomware attack) over the past\nfive years. Each of these incidents highlighted key\nlearnings that have led to an improved level of crisis\nmanagement maturity within the HSE.\n\n###### Strategic recommendations and findings\n\nThe Incident demonstrated that the HSE and\norganisations connected to the NHN are vulnerable\nto common cyber attacks that can cause significant\nimpact to the provision of health services.\nTransformational change is required across the\ntechnology foundation for provision of health services\nand its associated cybersecurity, that will need to be\nexecuted over the coming years.\n\nIn order to deliver a significant and sustainable\nchange in the exposure to cybersecurity risk, four\nareas of strategic focus are required across the HSE\nand other parties connected to the NHN. There are\ndependencies across these four areas and they need\nto be progressed in parallel. They are summarised\nbelow, with further detail provided in Section 4.1.\nMore detailed findings and recommendations are\nprovided in Section 5.\n\n\n**1.** **Implement an enhanced governance structure**\n**over IT and cybersecurity that will provide**\n**appropriate focus, attention and oversight.**\n\n\nWith a fragmented set of decision rights over IT\ndevelopment and support across the provision of\nhealth services, a necessary enabler for driving\ntransformational change will be the establishment\nof an executive level committee, chaired by the\nChief Technology and Transformation Officer (see\nRecommendation 2 below), that can agree the\npriorities for IT development and investment, and\nalign all interested parties behind a clear vision,\nstrategy and plan. Critical to its success will be the\n\n\n**1.1 Establish clear responsibilities for IT and**\n**cybersecurity across all parties that connect to**\n**the NHN, share health data or access shared**\n**health services. Establish a ‘code of connection’**\n**that sets minimum cybersecurity requirements**\n**for all parties and develop an assurance**\n**mechanism to ensure adherence.**\n\n\nOne of the challenges faced by the HSE is that\ncybersecurity risk materialises as a ‘common risk’\nto all organisations connected to the NHN given\nthe interconnected nature of the IT systems. Under\nthe governance constructs of the health service,\norganisations have varying levels of autonomy over\nIT and cybersecurity decision making, yet the risk is\nshared - with organisations dependent on each other\nfor cybersecurity. There is no ‘code of connection’\nfor all parties that connect to the NHN, share health\ndata or use shared services in order to set a minimum\nbaseline of security standards.\n\n\n**1.2 Establish an executive level cybersecurity**\n**oversight committee to drive continuous**\n**assessment of cybersecurity risk and a**\n**cybersecurity transformation programme across**\n**the provision of health services.**\n\n\nWithin the HSE, there is no dedicated executive\noversight committee that provides direction and\noversight to cybersecurity, both within the HSE and\nall organisations connected to the NHN. A known\nlow level of cybersecurity maturity, including critical\nissues with cybersecurity capability, has persisted.\nIt is important that the cybersecurity oversight\ncommittee includes participation from user groups,\nso that culturally cybersecurity moves from being\nperceived as an IT challenge, to being perceived\nas ‘how we work’. The cybersecurity oversight\ncommittee should be accountable for ensuring\ncompliance with the evolving requirements of the EU\nNISD for essential services across the health service.\n\n\n**1.3 Establish an executive level oversight**\n**committee for IT.**\n\n\n-----\n\nparticipation of IT leaders from across the health\nservice.\n\n\n**1.4** **Establish a board committee (or repurpose**\n**an existing one) to oversee the transformation**\n**of IT and cybersecurity to deliver a future-**\n**fit, resilient technology base for provision of**\n**digitally-enabled health services, and ensure**\n**that IT and cybersecurity risks remain within**\n**a defined risk appetite. Consider the inclusion**\n**of further specialist non-executive members**\n**of the committee in order to provide additional**\n**expertise and insight to the committee.**\n\n\nCybersecurity was recorded as a ‘High’ risk in the\nCorporate Risk Register in Q1 2019.[16] At the time\nof the Incident, the risk rating for cybersecurity on\nthe Corporate Risk Register was 16, based on a\nlikelihood scoring of 4 (likely, with a 75% probability)\nand an impact scoring of ‘Major’.[17] The HSE’s risk\nassessment tool is described in Appendix H.\n\nRisks on the Register are subject to a quarterly review\nprocess and the quarterly reports are reviewed by\nthe relevant Board Committee. The Performance\nand Delivery Committee of the Board reviewed the\ncyber risk with management in September 2020[18]\nand this was followed by a revised mitigation\nplan. The Committee includes two experienced IT\nleaders in large organisations, although they are not\ncybersecurity specialists. This revised mitigation plan\nhad a number of actions due to be completed post\nthe date of the Incident. The actions completed prior\nto the Incident did not materially impact the risk faced\nin this area.\n\nThe HSE’s IT-related risks had been presented at\nBoard level on a number of occasions. However,\nthe gravity of cybersecurity exposure was not fully\narticulated to the Board, given the HSE’s level\nof vulnerability to a cyber attack, or assessed\nagainst a defined risk appetite. Known issues with\ncybersecurity capability have made limited progress\nover the course of several years.\n\nGiven the scale of change required across the\nprovision of health services, it is recommended that\na focused committee of the board is established,\nwith relevant training provided. Consideration\nshould be given to appointing additional individuals\nto that committee with specialist skills to act in a\nnon-executive capacity and enhance the ability\nfor the committee to support and oversee the IT\nand cybersecurity transformation. A key role for\nthe committee will be to ensure that HSE requests\nfor government funding (e.g. to the Department of\n\n\nPublic Expenditure and Reform (“DPER”)) to invest\nin addressing IT and cybersecurity issues are clearly\narticulated, and the risks associated with lack of\ninvestment are communicated and understood.\n\n**2.** **Establish a transformational Chief Technology**\n**& Transformation Officer (“CTTO”) and office**\n**to create a vision and architecture for a**\n**resilient and future-fit technology capability;**\n**to lead the delivery of the significant**\n**transformation programme that is required,**\n**and to build the increased function that will**\n**be necessary to execute such a scale of IT**\n**change.**\n\nThe national health service is operating on a frail IT\nestate with an architecture that has evolved rather\nthan be designed for resilience and security. The NHN\nis primarily an unsegmented (or undivided) network,\nand can be described as a “flat” network, to make\nit easy for staff to access the IT applications they\nrequire. However, this design exposes the HSE to\nthe risk of cyber attacks from other organisations\nconnected to the NHN, as well as exposing other\norganisations to cyber attacks originating from\nthe HSE. This network architecture, coupled with\na complex and unmapped set of permissions for\nsystems administrators to access systems across the\nNHN, enabled the Attacker to access a multitude of\nsystems across many organisations connected to the\nNHN and create the large-scale impact that they did.\n\nThe parts of the health service that were arguably\nbest-equipped to maintain clinical services in the face\nof prolonged IT outages were those that rely on paper\nrecords for patient services. Whilst this was a positive\nfeature in managing the Incident, it highlights the\nextent to which modernisation is required across the\nhealth service to enable the adoption of digital health\nservices.\n\nReducing cybersecurity risk requires both a\ntransformation in cybersecurity capability (see\nrecommendation 3) and IT transformation, to\naddress the issues of a legacy IT estate and build\ncybersecurity and resilience into the IT architecture.\n\n\nThe HSE has operated since the end of 2018 with\nan interim Chief Information Officer with limited\n\n\n**2.1 Appoint a permanent CTTO with the**\n**mandate and authority to develop and execute**\n**a multi-year technology transformation, build**\n**an appropriate level of IT resource for an**\n**organisation the scale of the HSE and oversee**\n**the running of technology services.**\n\n\n16 Q1, 2019 CRR COMBINED Document for April LT meeting.pdf\n17 CRR Q4 2020 Full Report post EMT meeting February 2021 v0.1 09 02 21.pdf\n18 Minutes-hse-performance-and-delivery-committee-18-september-2020.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\npractical mandate, authority and resources to effect\nchange across all organisations connected to the\nNHN. The level of resourcing in critical IT functions\nis significantly lower than we would expect for an\norganisation of this size.\n\nThe CTTO should assume responsibility for all\ncapabilities that currently sit within the Office of the\nChief Information Officer (“OoCIO”), as well as a\nbroadened capability to drive rapid transformation.\nThe CTTO should be a member of the EMT reporting\nto the CEO.\n\n\n**2.2 Under the office of the CTTO, develop an IT**\n**strategy to achieve a secure, resilient and future-**\n**fit IT architecture, required for the scale of the**\n**HSE organisation.**\n\n\nThe HSE has had a plan for the development of IT\nthat has been used to secure funding for individual\nprojects. However it has not been tied to a vision,\nstrategy and architecture that is deliverable over\na period of years and that provides the necessary\nlevel of resilience through investment in enabling IT\narchitecture and fallback solutions in the event of\ncore technology failure. Many interviewees expressed\nfrustration with an apparent approach of investing\nin ‘new projects’ or ‘new features’ rather than the\nholistic delivery and maintenance of a technology\nfoundation for health service provision.\n\nIn order to deliver the transformation required, a\nclear strategy is required that can be used to secure\ncommitment to execution across all organisations\ninvolved in the provision of health services, and the\nsignificant funding that will be required over many\nyears.\n\n**3.** **Appoint a Chief Information Security**\n**Officer (“CISO”) and establish a suitably**\n**resourced and skilled cybersecurity function.**\n**Develop and drive the implementation of a**\n**cybersecurity transformation programme.**\n\nThe HSE has a very low level of cybersecurity\nmaturity (Section 5.3 of this report gives an\nevaluation of maturity against the industry\nstandard “NIST CSF” framework). Examples of\nthe lack of cybersecurity controls in place at the\ntime of the Incident include:\n\n**•** The IT environment did not have many of the\ncybersecurity controls that are most effective\nat detecting and preventing human-operated\nransomware attacks;\n\n\n\n**•** There was no security monitoring capability\nthat was able to effectively detect, investigate\nand respond to security alerts across HSE’s\nIT environment or the wider NHN;\n\n**•** There was a lack of effective patching\n(updates, bug fixes etc.) across the IT estate\nthat is connected to the NHN; and\n\n**•** Reliance was placed on a single antivirus\nproduct that was not monitored or effectively\nmaintained with updates across the estate.\nFor example, the workstation on which the\nAttacker gained their initial foothold did not\nhave antivirus signatures updated for over a\nyear.\n\nThe low level of cybersecurity maturity,\ncombined with the frailty of the IT estate,\nenabled the Attacker in this Incident to achieve\ntheir objectives with relative ease. The Attacker\nwas able to use well-known and simple attack\ntechniques to move around the NHN, extract\ndata and deploy ransomware software over large\nparts of the estate, without detection.\n\n\n**3.1** **Appoint a CISO and establish a suitably**\n**resourced and skilled cybersecurity function**\n\n\nThe HSE does not have a single responsible\nowner for cybersecurity at either senior executive\nor management level to provide leadership and\ndirection. This is highly unusual for an organisation\nof the HSE’s size and complexity with reliance on\ntechnology for delivering critical operations and\nhandling large amounts of sensitive data. As a\nconsequence, there was no senior cybersecurity\nspecialist able to ensure recognition of the risks\nthat the organisation faced due to its cybersecurity\nposture and the growing threat environment.\n\nThe CISO should be at National Director level, a\ndirect report to the CTTO, and have appropriate\naccess to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure that\ncybersecurity risks are understood and considered\nin all decision-making. Whilst recruitment of a\npermanent CISO may take some time, appointment\nof an interim CISO should be considered in the short\nterm.\n\nThe HSE also had only circa 15[19] full-time equivalent\n(“FTE”) staff in cybersecurity roles, and they did not\npossess the expertise and experience to perform the\ntasks expected of them.\n\n\n19 This comprises eight FTE within the Information Security Framework and Control team (two of which are students), the Security\nOperations team of five FTE and the Security, Standard and Policies team of two FTE. Figures are based on interviewee assertion\nand/(or) OoCIO Operating Model – 2020 Current State, December 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nA critical requirement for the HSE to begin to develop\nthe ability to prevent and detect a similar incident in\nthe future is the appointment of senior cybersecurity\nleadership and the development of a suitably skilled\nand resourced cybersecurity function. These skilled\nresources are currently scarce and the HSE may need\nto consider co-sourcing arrangements to support\nresource requirements in this area.\n\n\nThe HSE should establish an Operational Resilience\nPolicy and Steering Committee to drive integration\nbetween resilience-related disciplines across the\norganisation, such as incident management, crisis\nmanagement, clinical and services continuity and\nenterprise risk management plus disciplines that\ncan impact on resilience such as cybersecurity and\nphysical security.\n\n\n**3.2 Develop and drive the execution of a multi-**\n**year cybersecurity transformation programme**\n**to deliver an acceptable level of cybersecurity**\n**capability for a national health service.**\n\n\n**4.2 Enhance crisis management capabilities to**\n**encompass events such as wide-impact cyber**\n**attacks or large-scale loss of IT.**\n\n\nA multi-year programme to transform cybersecurity\ncapability in a holistic way is required to be led by the\nCISO, to ensure that the provision of health services\nin Ireland, and the data that those health services\nhandle, becomes less vulnerable to cyber attacks.\nThis programme will include the formalisation of\ncybersecurity training and awareness.\n\n**Implement a clinical and services continuity**\n**transformation programme reporting to the**\n**National Director for Governance and Risk,**\n**and enhance crisis management capabilities to**\n**encompass events such as wide-impact cyber**\n**attacks or large-scale loss of IT.**\n\n\n**4.1** **Implement a clinical and services continuity**\n**transformation programme reporting to**\n**the National Director for Governance and**\n**Risk. Establish an Operational Resilience**\n**Policy and Resilience Steering Committee to**\n**drive integration between resilience-related**\n**disciplines, and an overarching approach to**\n**resilience.**\n\n\nThe HSE has recognised that clinical and services\ncontinuity (business continuity) as a risk discipline\nhas not developed at the pace needed with\nexecutive oversight and focus. A National Director\nfor Governance and Risk (equivalent to a Chief\nRisk Officer) was appointed on 14 June 2021, and\nassigned responsibility for establishing a clinical and\nservices continuity framework, through which risk\nmanagement and continuity plans will be reviewed,\nmaintained and validated. Responsibility for clinical\nand service continuity under the HSE’s accountability\nstructure will remain with operational and functional\nmanagers. A programme and resource is required\nto develop the consistency and breadth of planning\nacross the health service, including establishing clear\nrequirements for disaster recovery capability to be\nimplemented by the IT transformation programme,\nand the mapping of clinical processes to IT systems\nand data.\n\n\nThe HSE has extensive experience in managing\ncrises, for example in the critical role it has fulfilled\nfor the nation in navigating the COVID-19 crisis. This\nhas resulted in some effective mechanisms for crisis\nmanagement not just being designed, but regularly\nused.\n\nHowever, the nature of the crisis resulting from\nthe ransomware attack was different, and required\nelements of capability that have not previously been\nrequired. For example: communicating with all staff\nin the health service without internal emails or other\nIT collaboration tools; establishing a wide variety\nof communication channels and forums to gather\ninformation and feedback to prioritise recovery of\nsystems, and issuing clear guidance to all parties\nimpacted by the Incident that was relevant to their\nlocalised situation.\n\nThe nature of a ransomware attack, resulting in\neffectively total loss of IT, makes it particularly\nchallenging to manage with a unique set of issues\nto be navigated. Investment is required in crisis\nmanagement planning, resourcing and tools and\nprocesses in the HSE and associated organisations in\norder to be prepared to manage this kind of crisis in\nthe future.\n\n###### Tactical recommendations\n\nGiven the high risk of exposure at present, below are\ntactical recommendations which require immediate\nattention to achieve urgent impact and to contribute\nto the development and implementation of the\nstrategic recommendations. These recommendations\nare described in more detail in Section 4.2 of\nthis report. Further detail of key findings and\nrecommendations are included in Section 5 of this\nreport.\n\n**1.** **Response to the Incident**\n\n**1.1.** Complete the ongoing work being performed\nby the Legal and Data workstream and\ncontinue to work closely with the Data\nProtection Commissioner (DPC).\n\n\n-----\n\n**1.2.** Continue to reconcile medical data stored\nand managed through interim processes\npost the ransomware attack and place\ncentralised governance over these\nactivities.\n\n**1.3.** Collate and manage artefacts created in\nresponse to the Incident, including initial\nproduction of an asset register.\n\n**1.4.** Appoint an interim senior leader for\ncybersecurity (a CISO) to be responsible\nfor driving forward tactical cybersecurity\nimprovements, managing third-parties that\nprovide cybersecurity services and leading\nthe cybersecurity response to cyber\nincidents.\n\n**1.5.** Formalise a programme and governance\nto respond to tactical recommendations\narising from the Incident Response\ninvestigation and provide assurance over\ntheir implementation.\n\n**2.** **Security monitoring**\n\n**2.1.** Ensure that the HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider’s managed defence service or\nan equivalent is maintained to detect and\nrespond to incidents on endpoints (i.e.\nlaptops, desktops, servers etc.) to provide\nprotection to the entirety of the NHN.\n\n**2.2.** Establish an initial cybersecurity incident\nmonitoring and response capability to\ndrive immediate improvement to the ability\nto detect and respond to cybersecurity\nevents.\n\n**3.** **Ability to respond to a similar incident in the**\n**near future**\n\n**3.1.** Review the process for managing internal\ncrisis communications including resources.\n\n**3.2.** Develop a plan for response and\nmanagement of an NHN-wide similar\nincident taking recent learnings into account.\n\n**3.3.** Establish retainers with appropriate service\nlevel agreements (“SLAs”) for third party\nincident and crisis management response\nsupport, together with processes and\nsufficient internal expertise to direct and\nmanage the third-parties\n\n**4.** **IT environment**\n\n**4.1.** Implement an upgrade to National\nIntegrated Medical Imaging System\n(“NIMIS”) to allow Windows 10 upgrade,\n\n20 HSE National Service Plan 2021\n\n\nthereby addressing known vulnerabilities\nand support issues associated with current\nwide deployment of Windows 7.\n\n**4.2.** Formalise existing roles and responsibilities\nfor IT across the entities accessing the\nNHN and establish SLAs for centrallyprovided services, while also ensuring\ninformation security policies align with\nthose responsibilities.\n\n###### Next Steps\n\nThe seriousness of the deficiencies identified persist\nand necessitate transformational change in the HSE\nas well as immediate tactical actions. We recommend\nthat the HSE improve their cybersecurity, IT and\noperational resilience governance, leadership and\ncapability, to allow them to stand up a remediation\nprogramme to address our recommendations.\n\nIn 2021, the HSE had a combined revenue and capital\nbudget of nearly €22 billion, which included an IT\noperating budget of €82 million and IT capital budget\nof €120 million (including €25 million for Covid-19\ncapital spend)[20]. The HSE is currently estimating its\nIT operating budget will increase to €140m and its\nIT capital budget will increase to €130m in 2022.\nWhilst it is outside the scope of the PIR to quantify\nthe incremental cost to the HSE of implementing the\nrecommendations set out in this report, it is clear\nthat it will require a very significant investment on an\nimmediate and sustained basis.\n\nThe HSE will need to develop an investment case\nfor this remediation programme, as the successful\nimplementation of the strategic and tactical\nrecommendations will be dependent on a well\nresourced plan, against which funding will need to be\nsecured and progress tracked. This will be a complex\nprogramme, with interdependencies between our\nrecommendations, and the programme will also need\nto be highly integrated with existing project delivery\nand business as usual operations. The investment\ncase will be complex to develop due to for example:\ni) it can be challenging to segregate core IT spend\nand cybersecurity investment (e.g. upgrading to\nWindows 10 or Individual Health Identifier); ii) costs\nto release and backfill service staff i.e. clinical and\noperational subject matter experts who are critical to\ncomplex e-health projects, will be a relevant cost of\nthe remediation programme and this will need to be\nincorporated into the investment commitment; and iii)\na significant number of cybersecurity and clinical and\nservice continuity resources need to be put in place,\nto deliver on the execution of the plan.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cost of the remediation programme, in addition\nto underlying technology and operational resilience\ncosts, is likely to be a multiple of the HSE’s current\ncapital and operating expenditure in these areas\nover several years. Our recommendations need to\nbe developed into a prioritised plan, with tactical\nrecommendations implemented on an accelerated\nbasis. On the basis of this plan, cost estimates for\nyear one can be established with a reasonable level\nof accuracy. Subsequently, within the first year, high\nlevel cost estimates for years 2-5 can be estimated\n(possibly over a longer duration, depending on\ninterdependencies with other change programmes).\n\n###### Learnings for other organisations\n\nA number of the vulnerabilities that the ransomware\nattack highlighted are not unique to the HSE, and\nissues identified in this report will be found in other\norganisations. All organisations therefore need to\nconsider the extent to which they are protected from\na major cyber incident, and be prepared to respond\nand recover should they experience such an event.\nWe have outlined these recommendations in Section\n1 of this report.\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nWhile reviews of this nature tend to focus on what\nwent wrong to identify learnings, it is also important\nto recognise that the Incident was caused by an\nAttacker and the HSE was the victim of a cybercrime.\nThere was a considerable effort made by personnel,\nincluding IT and operations personnel in HSE centre,\nthe hospitals and CHOs, and healthcare professionals\nin all areas, to respond to the Incident, to recover\nfrom the Incident and to continue to provide patient\ncare throughout the Incident. If this significant effort\nhad not been made by these people, the impact of\nthe Incident on the Irish public healthcare system\nwould certainly have been much worse.\n\nThe HSE is operating on a frail IT estate that has\nlacked the investment over many years required to\nmaintain a secure, resilient, modern IT infrastructure.\nIt does not possess the required cybersecurity\ncapabilities to protect the operation of the health\nservices and the data they process, from the\ncyber attacks that all organisations face today. It\ndoes not have sufficient subject matter expertise,\nresources or appropriate security tooling to detect,\nprevent or respond to a cyber attack of this scale.\nThere were several missed opportunities to detect\nmalicious activity, prior to the detonation phase of the\nransomware.\n\nThe relative disadvantage in this Incident for\norganisations who have greater dependency on\ntechnology services, illustrates the critical need for\n\n\nresiliency to be built into the IT architecture and\nsystems, to foster the confidence required to enable\nfuture migration to more digital provision of health\nservices.\n\nEmergency and crisis planning at the HSE previously\nfocused on scenarios such as adverse weather,\npandemic, serious accidents and terrorist action,\nwhich generate a temporary surge in demand for\nacute services. The assumption was that all critical\ninfrastructure and processes would remain available\nto support the response. Similar to many other\norganisations, the HSE did not conduct contingency\nplanning for a cyber attack or any other scenario\ninvolving the complete loss of infrastructure,\npeople, or facilities. Clinical and services continuity\nhas not been a corporate priority in the HSE until\nrecently. In order to maximise the learnings from the\nresponse to the Incident, the HSE must expand upon\ninitiatives already started, and implement a coherent\noperational resilience capability, including clinical and\nservices continuity and crisis management, across\nthe organisation.\n\nReducing cybersecurity risk requires both a\ntransformation in cybersecurity capability and IT\ntransformation, to address the issues of a legacy\nand complex IT estate and build cybersecurity and\nresilience into the IT architecture. Whilst this will need\nto be executed over a period of several years, there\nis an imperative for the HSE to act with urgency to\nensure that the necessary plans, vision, leadership,\ncommitted investment and resourcing are in place\nto drive this significant change to build a secure,\nresilient and future-fit technology foundation for\nprovision of national healthcare services. The required\ninvestment commitment is likely to be a multiple of\nthe HSE’s current expenditure on technology and\noperational resilience, but is essential to protect the\nHSE against future attacks which are inevitable and\nhave the potential to be even more damaging.\n\nThe HSE, the State and non-State organisations now\nhave an opportunity to take the key lessons from this\nmajor Incident to build a more robust and resilient\ncyber frontier nationally.\n\nThe HSE remains vulnerable to cyber attacks similar\nto that experienced in the Incident, or cyber attacks\nthat may have an even greater impact.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 1\n\n\n### Learnings\n\n###### Whilst the purpose of this report is to highlight recommendations and findings specific to the HSE to be taken from the Incident, there are a number of recommendations and key learnings that can be applied to all organisations. \n\n\n-----\n\n**As dependency on technology deepens across**\n**society, the impact of destructive cyber attacks**\n**such as ransomware will undoubtedly grow even**\n**further. Investing in cybersecurity needs to be a**\n**priority even for organisations that previously have**\n**not considered cyber attacks as a threat to their**\n**operations. A number of the vulnerabilities that**\n**the ransomware attack highlighted are not unique**\n**to the HSE, and issues identified in this report**\n**will also be found in many other organisations.**\n**All organisations therefore need to consider the**\n**extent to which they are protected from a major**\n**cyber incident, and be prepared to respond and**\n**recover should they experience such an event.**\n\nThe points below are presented as recommendations\nthat all organisations should consider in the light\nof the experience of the HSE, in order to learn\nlessons from this Incident more broadly. They are not\nintended to be exhaustive, but act as an instructive\nset of learnings to consider in response to this\nIncident.\n\n###### Governance and cybersecurity leadership\n\n**1.** **Understanding of technology dependency**\n**and governance of technology risk**\n\nBoards and executive leadership of organisations\nshould ensure that they understand the extent to\nwhich their critical operations are dependent on\ntechnology. Governance must ensure that risks\nassociated with technology are properly understood\nand actively managed, including the resiliency of\nthe organisation to widespread technology failure\nor compromise from an attack (which may occur\nindirectly through the supply chain). Governance over\ntechnology should ensure that sufficient investment\nis focused on: maintenance of robust foundational\ntechnology infrastructure; realising opportunities\nfrom new technology (such as infrastructure and\napplications in the cloud) to manage risks in a\nnew way, and managing risks that arise from new\napplication of technology.\n\n**2.** **Cybersecurity strategy and leadership**\n\nOrganisations should ensure they have a\ncybersecurity strategy that defines the key\ncybersecurity risks to the organisation, how those\nrisks are being mitigated and the resourcing and\ninvestment to execute the strategy. Organisations\nshould have a single accountable senior leader\nresponsible for delivering the strategy. An element of\nthe strategy should be consideration of the cyber risk\nposed by legacy IT, how this risk can be mitigated in\nthe short-term, and how technology modernisation\n\n\nwill address the root-cause issue.\n\n###### Effective cybersecurity capability\n\n**3.** **Ransomware-specific assessment**\n\nOrganisations should perform a cybersecurity\nassessment specific to the threat of ransomware,\ngiven the heightened threat posed by ransomware\nattacks. This will highlight the extent to which the\norganisation’s cybersecurity controls are appropriate\nand effective to defend against this threat, and\nidentify areas that may require urgent investment.\n\nKey examples of cybersecurity controls that\nshould be assessed include: sufficiency of security\nmonitoring to detect and contain ransomware\nattacks in the early stages, ability to prevent and\ndetect the compromise of ‘privileged’ (e.g. systems\nadministrator) accounts, and the robustness of user\nauthentication.\n\nSeveral organisations that provide ransomwareresponse services can provide such assessments,\nand publicly available frameworks and guidance\nare available from organisations such as the\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n(“CISA”) in the USA.\n\n**4.** **Effective cybersecurity monitoring**\n**and response**\n\nOrganisations must possess an effective security\nmonitoring capability that can detect and respond to\nthe tools and techniques used by human-operated\nransomware groups. This should include deploying\na capable ‘Endpoint Detection & Response’ tool to\ndetect and prevent malicious activity on workstations\n(fed by current cyber threat intelligence) and ensuring\nthe development of skilled resources and processes\nso that security alerts are rapidly triaged, investigated\nand responded to.\n\n**5.** **Testing of cybersecurity capability**\n**through simulated attacks**\n\nTesting of cybersecurity capability through the use\nof ethical hackers simulating end-to-end attack\ntechniques (i.e. ‘red team’ testing) is essential\nto provide a threat- based perspective of an\norganisation’s vulnerability to ransomware and other\ntypes of attacks. This can be used to rapidly identify\nand prioritise key security improvement areas and\nensure that the organisation can effectively detect\ncommon attacker tools, with the necessary people\n\n\n-----\n\nand processes are in place to investigate and\nrespond to alerts.\n\n###### Preparedness to  respond and recover\n\n**6.** **Cybersecurity-specific incident response**\n**and crisis management plans**\n\nOrganisations should develop and exercise\ncybersecurity-specific incident response and crisis\nmanagement plans that define how a response\nshould be led, managed and coordinated. These\nshould be challenged to ensure they are effective\nin a catastrophic ransomware scenario where\nall IT platforms, cybersecurity tools and usual\ncommunication channels are unavailable, and\nrecovery efforts may have to be sustained for weeks\nor months.\n\n**7.** **Business continuity planning and IT disaster**\n**recovery planning for a ransomware scenario**\n\nOrganisations should prioritise business continuity\nplanning and disaster recovery planning that\nwould ensure provision for continuity of critical\noperations and the ability to recover in the face\nof a ransomware attack that results in total loss\nof IT and associated data.\n\nBusiness continuity planning should be based on\nrigorous ‘Business Impact Analysis’, and ensure that\nworkarounds are defined for the scenario of total loss\nof IT for up to several weeks.\n\nOrganisations’ IT disaster recovery plans should be\nbased on a prioritised list of applications and systems\nto recover, should the technology base of the\norganisation have to be rebuilt or recovered, informed\nby an up-to-date asset register and mapping of\ncritical operations to technology. Offline backups (or\nbackups that are verified as inaccessible to attackers\nwith full control of production IT) must be available for\nall critical systems, data and infrastructure, including\ncore IT infrastructure such as Active Directory (“AD”),\nwith a well-defined and tested restore procedure that\nincludes verification of ability to recover all systems\nto a common point-in-time.\n\n\n**8.** **Retained incident and crisis support**\n\nOrganisations should establish contractual retainers\nwith key third parties that may be required to support\na crisis response. Third party support that may likely\nbe required during an incident include: forensic and\ntechnical incident response; crisis response; external\nlegal counsel, and public relations.\n\nRetainers should include: service level agreements;\nspecification of third party roles and responsibilities;\nreviews of the technical preparedness of the\norganisation for incident response (by forensic and\ntechnical incident response providers), and preagreed legal requirements (such as non-disclosure\nagreements). These will ensure that partners can\nbe engaged to support, and be integrated into, a\nresponse immediately and scale to the size of the\nresponse required.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction and background\n# 2\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.1 Overview of the ransomware  cyber attack\n\nIn the early hours of Friday 14 May 2021, the HSE\nbecame aware of a major cyber attack (the “Incident”)\nagainst their IT systems. The Incident was carried\nout by the criminal infiltration of these systems using\nConti ransomware.[21] As a result of the Incident, the\nHSE shut down all IT systems and disconnected\nnetworks causing significant disruption to healthcare\nservices across the country.\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the HSE was over a year\ninto a complex crisis response to the unprecedented\nemergency of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The\nnational healthcare service was subject to one of the\nmost serious cyber attacks ever in Ireland, one which\naffected almost every part of the critical infrastructure\nof the country’s healthcare system. It was reported by\nHSE management that 80% of the HSE’s environment\nacross corporate IT services, hospitals, CHOs and\nelectronic health records (“EHR”) was encrypted[22],\ncausing a severe and long lasting disruption to\nhealthcare services.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Incident,\nmany hospitals were forced to cancel outpatient\nappointments completely while others were operating\nwith significant delays and reverted to using pen\nand paper to continue recording patient care. Over\nhalf of the hospitals in the country announced\ncancellations of at least some of their outpatient\nappointments.[23] The impact of the Incident on\nservices varied depending on several factors\nincluding the type of care being offered, the reliance\non software applications to record and manage\npatient data, existing IT infrastructures and local IT\nsupport.[24] The Incident had a significant impact on\ndiagnostic services due to loss of NIMIS and also\nlaboratory systems. There was a significant impact\non radiotherapy services, with cessation of radiation\ntreatment across the five HSE centres (a Model 3\n\n21 \u0007Ransomware Attack on Health Sector https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/HSE_Conti_140521_\nUPDATE.pdf\n22 \u0007Percentage confirmed in interview by the CTO within\nOoCIO Infrastructure and Technology\n23 \u0007HSE cyber attack – which hospitals are affected?\nHere is everything you need to know.

In\n2021, the HSE had a combined operating and capital\nbudget of nearly €22bn[28].\n\nCommunity healthcare services are delivered across\nnine geographically organised CHOs while acute\nhospital services are delivered across a network of\nsix Hospital Groups and Children’s Health Ireland\n(“CHI”). Within the Hospital Groups, there are\n54 acute hospitals. These are made up of public\nhospitals directly under the authority of the HSE and\nvoluntary hospitals who receive state funds through\nthe HSE. The latter are independently owned and\nprovide services on behalf of the HSE under Section\n38 of the Health Act, 2004. They have their own IT\nteams and infrastructure but also utilise the national\nIT infrastructure as referred to below.\n\nThe HSE employs approximately 130,000 people,\nincluding those directly employed by the HSE[29] as\nwell as those employed by organisations funded by\nthe HSE.

There were no recommendations for\nmajor changes to IT or cybersecurity in this review\n(outside the change outlined below). However, the\nchange did create a more centralised governance\nand risk function with the appointment of a National\nDirector for Governance and Risk (equivalent to a\nChief Risk Officer) with responsibility for establishing\nEnterprise Resilience and Business Continuity\nFrameworks, through which risk management\nand business continuity plans will be reviewed,\nmaintained and validated. Responsibility for clinical\nand service continuity under the HSE’s accountability\nstructure will remain with operational and functional\nmanagers.\n\n\nThese and other initial organisational changes took\neffect approximately 1 month post the Incident, on 14\nJune 2021, including:\n\n**•** Healthcare Strategy (to include Strategy and\nResearch, Change and Innovation, Governance\nand Risk and Capital and Estates);\n\n**•** Clinical (to include Quality & Patient Safety,\nIntegrated Care Design and Innovation);\n\n**•** Integrated Operations (to include Service\nPlanning, Patient and Service User Experience,\nNational Schemes and Reimbursement,\nOperational Performance and Integration);\n\n**•** eHealth and Disruptive Technology (to include\nSAP Centre of Excellence);\n\n**•** Finance (to include Financial Costing and Pricing,\nFinance Shared Services and Procurement);\n\n**•** Human Resources (to include Capability and\nCulture, HR Shared Services and the National\nIntegrated Staff Records & Pay Programme\n(“NiSRP”)); and\n\n**•** Audit (to include Health Care Audit).\n\nIt is planned that further changes will be made to the\nNational Centre, including a Population Health and\n\n\n-----\n\nPrevention function that will include the areas\nof Test and Trace, Public Health, Environmental\nHealth and Health and Wellbeing, as well as a\nmove towards a more integrated structure for\nAcute and Community Services.\n\n###### HSE organisational structure on 14 June 2021\n\n\n**Figure 4: HSE organisational structure on 14 June 2021**\n\n|Internal Audit|Col2|Col3|Corporate Affairs|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||C|EO||\n\n|Ac Oper|ute ations|\n|---|---|\n\n|Comm Oper|unity ations|\n|---|---|\n\n|Hospital Groups|National Ambulance Service|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Acute hospital care**\n\nAcute hospital services are delivered across the\nnetwork of six acute Hospital Groups and CHI\nand provide scheduled care, unscheduled care\n(unplanned or emergency care), diagnostic services,\nspecialist services, cancer services, trauma services,\nmaternity and children’s services and the National\nAmbulance Service. Hospital services are provided\nthrough a mix of HSE funded and directly managed\nhospitals and voluntary public hospitals funded\npredominantly through State funds.\n\n\n**Community healthcare services**\n\nCommunity healthcare services include primary\ncare, social inclusion, older persons’ and palliative\ncare services, disability and mental health services\nfor both children and adults. Community healthcare\nservices are currently delivered across nine\ngeographically organised CHOs and are provided\nthrough a mix of HSE directly provided services\nand indirectly provided services through voluntary\nsection 38 and 39 service providers, GPs and private\nproviders.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Background to the HSE IT Infrastructure**\n\nIn health services, there is an extensive community\nwho are increasingly dependent on connected and\nreliable technological solutions and varying levels of\nIT support from the HSE National Centre to deliver\nclinical services. This includes the HSE’s national IT\ninfrastructure that enables patient care and patient\nsafety as referred to further below.\n\n\n**Figure 5: Scale of the HSE**\n\n**Over**\n\n###### 70K\n**Devices**\n\n###### c.350 IT Staff\n\nThe OoCIO manages more than 4,500 servers,\nover 70,000[30] end user devices and over 1,000\napplications[31 ]with a team of approximately 350\npeople.[32]\n\n\n30 Cyber Security Board Awareness Draft V7.2.pptx\n31 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n32 Cyber Security Board Awareness Draft V7.2.pptx\n\n\n-----\n\n**National Healthcare Network**\n\nThe HSE utilises a NHN for the connectivity and\ndelivery of critical national health services. The\nmanagement of the NHN is the responsibility of the\nOoCIO within HSE National Centre, but it is accessed\nby the many organisations within the health services.\n\n\n**Figure 6: National Healthcare Network**\n\n\nThe NHN is primarily a ‘flat’ network to make it easier\nfor staff to access the IT applications they require.\nHowever, this design exposes the HSE to the risk of\ncyber attacks from other organisations connected to\nthe NHN, as well as exposing other organisations to\ncyber attacks originating from the HSE - since once\nan attacker has a presence on the network they have\n‘freedom to roam’.\n\nThe HSE has a complex IT environment including a\nsignificant number of legacy systems. At the time of\nthe Incident just under two thirds of the server estate\nwere described as modern[33], with the remaining\nestate deemed end of life and operating on extended\n\n33 \u0007Software that is in mainstream support from the\nvendor\n\n\nsupport or out of support.[34] HSE also had over 30,000\nWindows 7 workstations that were deemed end of life\nby the vendor.[35] The HSE assessed its cybersecurity\nmaturity rating as low.[36] For example they do\nnot have a CISO or a Security Operation Centre\nestablished.\n\n34 \u0007As confirmed by the General Manager Head of\nTechnology Infrastructure & Deployment\n35 \u0007Data provided from the antivirus management\nserver (the server) of systems that last\ncommunicated with within the last three\nmonths, September 2021\n36 VI Cybersecurity effectiveness assessment\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HSE is classified as a critical infrastructure\noperator under the EU NISD[37], also known as an OES.\nThe purpose of this classification system is to ensure\nthere is a common, high level security of network\nand information systems for Operators of Essential\nServices (“OES”) in each EU member state. The\nNCSC produces guidelines to assist OES in meeting\nthese requirements.[38]\n\n###### Impact of the Incident on healthcare services\n\nHealthcare services across the country were\nseverely disrupted by the Incident, with real and\nimmediate consequences for the thousands of\npatients who require healthcare services on a daily\nbasis. In frontline healthcare delivery, patient care\nand patient safety is enabled by IT applications,\nsuch as diagnostic systems (primarily laboratory and\nradiology systems), electronic health records and\npharmacy systems.[39] Some of the main impacts of\nthe Incident were in the areas of patient identification,\nordering and performing diagnostics, reporting\nresults, prescribing medication and delays in\nproviding treatment.[40] Whilst there is no evidence of\nthe Attacker compromising medical devices directly,\nthere was a loss of information flows in and out of\nthose devices whilst IT systems were down.\n\nThe impact on clinical care processes was evident\nimmediately and the HSE issued guidance that\ndirected providers towards emergency, urgent and\ntime scheduled care only[41]. Clinical contingency\narrangements were put in place with providers\ncurtailing services. On the morning of the Incident,\n31 of the 54 acute hospitals announced cancellations\nof at least some of their services.[42 43] Cancellations\nvaried by hospital and included some outpatient\nclinics, diagnostic imaging, radiotherapy, certain\npathology tests and certain elective surgeries.\n\n37 \u0007This occurred in July 2016.

Community based services\ntended to have less reliance on IT other than email\nas compared to the acute hospitals. The COVID-19\ntesting centres were able to repurpose Healthmail\nto generate appointments. The vaccination program\ncontinued with the online vaccination system taken\noffline for a few hours only, although the COVID-19\nreporting system was lost for a period of time.[44] The\nNational Ambulance Service was not impacted.\n\nHSE business continuity plans did not envisage\na severe but plausible total IT loss scenario for a\nperiod of weeks. Workarounds were quickly put in\nplace in many instances, to ensure continuity of\nservices for as long as possible. Certain hospitals\nhad a manual approach pre-prepared for particular\nprocesses, whilst others did not and staff needed to\nbe innovative in their approach.\n\n**Impact example: For laboratory tests, healthcare**\n**professionals reverted to handwritten forms, with**\n**staff taking them to the lab to be manually entered**\n**and analysed with a similar process for returning**\n**results. This resulted in an increased likelihood**\n**of delay and risk of error with these manual**\n**processes.**\n\nThere was no access to patient information systems\nsuch as Integrated Patient Management System\n(“iPMS”). This resulted in challenges in identifying\npatients, retrieving patient paper files, accessing\ncontact details, managing DNAs (Did Not Attends),\ntransferring patients between services and managing\npatient waiting lists.\n\n44 \u0007Reporting on epidemiology of COVID-19 from the\nnational Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting\n(CIDR) system to recommence on 02/09/2021.\nSource: HSE website. Date: September 2 2021\nhttps://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/\ncoronavirus/novelcoronavirus/surveillance/\nrecommencementofreportingfromcidr/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Impact example: A GP received a phone call from**\n**a consultant surgeon questioning the location of**\n**a patient due for surgery, when that patient had**\n**already been operated on.**\n\n**Impact example: One example hospital had no**\n**way to access their appointment data. Unless**\n**people showed up with their appointment letter**\n**in their hand, they did not know how to process**\n**them.**\n\nWhere electronic healthcare records were relied upon,\naccess to these records was no longer available.\nFor example the four maternity hospitals using the\nMaternal & Newborn Clinical Management System\n(“MN-CMS”) no longer had access. These hospitals\nswitched to paper records and charts. Whilst\nbusiness continuity plans envisaged an IT outage\non MN-CMS for a short period, for example due to\na system upgrade, a data centre outage or similar\nissue, the length of time without MN-CMS access\nincreased risks to patient care, particularly due to the\nlack of access to patient history.\n\nDiagnostic systems such as the shared service for\nhandling medical imaging, NIMIS and compuscope\nsystem were unavailable.\n\n**Impact example: For some oncology patients**\n**in the middle of treatment, the Incident meant**\n**that hospitals didn’t have access to the patient’s**\n**radiotherapy plans and could not safely continue**\n**treatment without new medical imaging. Some**\n**hospitals used adjacent private facilities where**\n**available, to take new medical images to continue**\n**providing radiotherapy treatment to patients.**\n\nAt the time of the PIR, there is a lack of empirical\ndata to clearly identify the impact of the Incident on\npatient care during this period. This is partially due to\nincomplete data in many areas due to a backlog of\nmanual records, but also the difficulty in separately\nidentifying the impact of the Incident from other\nissues affecting public healthcare services during this\ntime, such as COVID-19, shortage of consultants and\nother capacity issues.\n\nThe Incident disrupted public hospitals’ ability to\nprovide complete waiting list data to the National\nTreatment Purchase Fund (“NTPF”), therefore no data\nwas published for June 2021.[45]\n\nThis extremely difficult operating environment,\ncaused by the Incident, put additional stress on a\nsystem of healthcare professionals that were already\nexhausted by four waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrustrations were expressed at not being able to\nprovide care in the normal way. Administration and\n\n45 https://www.ntpf.ie/home/outpatient.htm\n\n\nother staff experienced difficulties dealing with\nvarying levels of frustration and aggression from\npatients and members of the public.[46]\n\n**Impact example: “Staff is (sic) fatigued as they**\n**continue to deal with the pandemic, along with IT**\n**issues and workarounds”. “It has had an impact**\n**on staff – the two serious issues coming one after**\n**the other, we haven’t experienced anything like it**\n**before”.**\n\n**Impact example: During the response, the CIO,**\n**Head of Occupational Health and the National**\n**Ambulance Service identified a risk of staff**\n**burnout. It was at this point Occupational Health**\n**were requested to attend the war room to**\n**check responders’ health, and staff rotas were**\n**implemented.**\n\nThe HSE has commissioned a study[47] to review the\nmitigations and contingencies which were adopted to\nminimise the impact of the Incident on patient safety,\nwith a focus also on what worked well to inform future\nplanning for IT outages. It is a longitudinal study so\nwill take into account the longer term impact from\nthe Incident. We were provided with a draft report of\nthis study, but the study is ongoing and therefore the\nreport is incomplete at the date of this PIR report.\nThis study when completed will provide further insight\ninto the impact of the Incident on healthcare services.\n\nThere were also many non-clinical impacts from\nthe Incident on the HSE and organisations that are\nfunded by it. These are varied and wide ranging.\nSome examples include:\n\n**Impact example: Whilst payments of wages and**\n**salaries to HSE staff generally continued, travel**\n**and subsistence claims could not initially be paid.**\n**Pandemic Placement Grant (“PPG”) for student**\n**nurses and midwives, which was due to be paid**\n**by the 1st June 2021, was delayed in many areas**\n**and in some instances was only partially paid.**\n\n**Impact example: Inability to use HSE email**\n**accounts led to a delay in the General Register**\n**Office process leading to delays in child benefit**\n**payments for new births or delays in issuing**\n**passports.**\n\n46 \u0007Healy, O.

Given the seriousness of the Incident, the\nimpact it has had on people dependent on health\nservices and the associated patient safety risks as\nwell as the heightened vulnerability for the HSE as\na result of the current disruption, it was agreed by\nthe Board of the HSE (“the Board”) in conjunction\nwith the CEO and the EMT that this review would be\ncarried out as an independent PIR.\n\nIn June 2021, PwC was commissioned by the\nBoard in conjunction with the CEO and the EMT to\nundertake an immediate and independent PIR into\nthe circumstances surrounding the infiltration of the\nHSE’s IT systems. The PIR was carried out under the\nterms as set out in the HSE’s Incident Management\nFramework. Following an initial four week scoping\nphase, the PIR was conducted over a period of 14\nweeks.\n\nThe purpose of the PIR was to:\n\n**•** Urgently establish the facts in relation to the\ncurrent preparedness of the HSE in terms of\nboth its technical preparedness (Information and\nCommunications Technology (“ICT”) systems,\ncyber and information protections) and its\noperational preparedness (including Business\nContinuity Management planning) for a strategic\nrisk of this nature;\n\n**•** Identify the learnings from this Incident to identify\nimprovements to the HSE’s preparedness for and\nresponse to other major risks including immediate\nrisks and incidents that cause major business\ndisruption; and\n\n**•** Share those learnings within the HSE and\nexternally with State and non-State organisations\nto inform their future preparedness.\n\n###### 2.3 Scope of our review\n\nThe scope of the PIR covers the HSE National Centre\nand their provision and interaction with the nine\nCHOs, the six Hospital Groups and CHI.\n\nWe took a sample approach to review the\ninvolvement of the CHOs and the hospitals within\nthe Hospital Groups, specifically looking at how the\nHSE’s strategy was implemented at tactical levels\n\n48 \u0007HSE Incident Management Framework & Guidance 2020\n\n\nand the effectiveness of the HSE’s coordination of\nefforts. We selected a sample of two CHOs and\nnine hospitals,each of which were impacted by the\nIncident. This sample included a mix of voluntary\nand HSE managed hospitals, a geographical spread\nand differences in disruption levels caused by\nthe Incident. We did not review the technical and\noperational preparedness and response of each\nindividual hospital or CHO.\n\nThe review did not cover other agencies such as\nTUSLA or third party healthcare service providers.\nOur review did not cover the cyber attack at the\nDepartment of Health (“DoH”), though the timing of\nthis attack is referenced in our review.\n\nThe scope of the review did not cover an evaluation\nof the appropriateness of the HSE’s current or\nhistoric spend on cybersecurity/ defence or the\nappropriateness of its annual IT expenditure generally.\nWe did not validate the work performed as part of any\nprevious information security audits or related work\non which the HSE historically made decisions.\n\nA technical forensic investigation was carried out\nby the HSE’s Incident Response provider after\nthe Incident. Though we relied on outputs from\nthe HSE’s Incident Response provider to inform\nour assessment, we did not re-examine the HSE’s\nIncident Response provider’s evidence nor did we\nre-perform their forensic analysis as part of the\nreview. Moreover, we limited analysis of technical\nsecurity controls to those implemented to address\nthe specific attack techniques identified to be used\nduring the Incident.\n\nMore details of the scope of our review can be found\nin Appendix A.\n\n###### 2.4 Our review approach\n\nUndertaking a review of this nature is complex\nand requires a deep understanding of the context\nin which the Incident occured, the environment in\nwhich the HSE operates, the structure of public\nhealthcare services in Ireland and the structure of\nthe HSE itself. In order to rapidly understand and\nanalyse the intricacies of the HSE’s preparation and\nresponse for this Incident, we brought together an\nexperienced team of IT and cybersecurity experts in\nboth Ireland and the UK as well as specialists in crisis\nmanagement, forensic investigation and response,\ndata privacy, healthcare and regulatory experts with\nextensive experience in cybersecurity PIRs.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recognition of the complexity and multifaceted\nnature of the Incident, we approached our review\nthrough the lens of three connected but distinct areas\nof focus.\n\n\n**Focus area 1**\n\n\nTo review the technical investigation and response\n\n**Focus area 2**\n\nTo review the organisation-wide preparedness and\nstrategic response\n\n**Focus area 3**\n\nTo review the preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber\nrisks\n\n\n###### Focus area 1\n\nIn this area, we reviewed the technical investigation\nand response to the Incident and the subsequent\nrecovery and investigation activities undertaken\nby the HSE. We reviewed the effectiveness of\nthe response and recovery, the sufficiency of the\ninvestigation to support the conclusions made and\nthe ability of the HSE to detect and prevent similar\nincidents in the future.\n\nWe took a phase-based approach to this focus\narea, looking at preparedness to defend against and\nrespond to a ransomware cyber attack, response\nto the Incident, recovery from the Incident and\nsustainable reduction of risk since the Incident.\nWe used our proprietary “Ransomware Capability\nFramework”[49] to assess the cybersecurity controls\nin place at the time of the Incident. In addition,\nwe reviewed the HSE’s network and AD structure,\nincluding the architecture of the NHN and conducted\nan analysis of the recovery of specific applications.\n\nIn each phase, we deep-dived into specific areas of\ninterest that were identified during our review. This\nwas done through:\n\n**•** review of relevant documentation including\na sample of daily incident Situation Reports\n(“SITREP”s), investigation reports, RAID logs and\nrecovery plans;\n\n**•** interviews with key stakeholders involved in the\nresponse, the investigation and the recovery and\n\n49 \u0007PwC’s proprietary ransomware readiness framework\nlists the most important cybersecurity controls we\nhave identified to prevent, detect and respond to\nhuman-operated ransomware attacks.\n\n\n\n**•** interviews with technical teams to understand\nthe cybersecurity controls in place at the time\nof the Incident and assess these against our\n“Ransomware Capability Framework”.\n\n###### Focus area 2\n\nIn this area, we reviewed the organisation-wide\npreparedness and the strategic response to the\nIncident and the corresponding response and\nrecovery activities completed by the HSE, including\nthe subsequent communication and coordination\nactivities undertaken.\n\nThis review was carried out through a three-phased\napproach looking at\n\n**•** crisis preparedness;\n\n**•** crisis response ; and\n\n**•** crisis recovery.\n\nIt was structured using the International Organisation\nfor Standardisation (“ISO”) and technical\nspecifications guiding the implementation and\nmaintenance of both business continuity and\ncrisis management capabilities. ISO 22301:2019\n_“Security and resilience - Business continuity_\n_management systems (BCMS) - requirements guides_\nthe construction, maintenance and validation of an\neffective Business Continuity Management System. In\nthe context of the HSE, the term clinical and services\ncontinuity is used throughout the report, rather\nthan business continuity. It refers to all acute and\ncommunity services, as well as corporate services,\nincluding, but not limited to HR, procurement,\nfinance, training, ICT etc. PD CEN /TS 17091:2018\nis the internationally recognised specification which\nprovides guidance to strategic decision makers\nto plan, implement, establish, operate, monitor,\nreview, maintain and continually improve a crisis\nmanagement capability. The review was done\nthrough;\n\n**•** review of relevant documentation relating to the\nstructure of the HSE, crisis management and\nbusiness continuity procedures in place prior to\nthe Incident,\n\n**•** a sample review of SITREPs, morning briefings\nand other communication channel conversations\nused during the response;\n\n**•** interviews with key stakeholders involved in the\norganisational response to the Incident;\n\n\n-----\n\n**•** workshops to examine:\n\n– risk, business continuity, incident and crisis\nmanagement structures and processes in\nplace at the time of the Incident;\n\n– impacts on operational and clinical services;\n\n– crisis response effectiveness;\n\n– security control failures and organisational\nsecurity cultural and behavioural causes.\n\n###### Focus area 3\n\nIn this area, we performed an assessment of\nthe HSE’s cyber preparedness, resilience and\nability to respond to future incidents. To carry\nout this assessment, we developed a “PIR\nCybersecurity Framework” which was based on\nthe NIST Cybersecurity Framework[50] and Control\nAssociation Control Objectives for Information and\nRelated Technologies (“COBIT”). These are both\ninternationally recognised standards used frequently\nby organisations to assess their information security\ncapabilities and IT governance processes. Our “PIR\nCybersecurity Framework” incorporates NIST’s five\nkey domains and 23 supporting sub-domains along\nwith the governance aspects from COBIT. This was\nperformed through:\n\n**•** review of relevant documentation relating to\nthe HSE’s information security controls and\nprocesses to measure their effectiveness and\nmaturity in terms of NIST CSF;\n\n**•** review of relevant documentation to assess\nthe resilience of the HSE’s information security\ncontrols and processes with a focus on people\nand business continuity management using\nCOBIT as a reference;\n\n**•** interviews with key stakeholders involved in\ninformation security and IT governance.\n\n50 https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\n\n\n###### Our approach in summary\n\nIn summary, our review involved:\n\n**•** The analysis of more than of 2,500 artefacts\nincluding documents, records and data.\n\n**•** A total of 81 interviews with over 190 people from\nthe National Centre, hospitals, CHOs, GPs as well\nas third parties including:\n\n– 53 one to one interviews with National Centre\npersonnel;\n\n– Four workshops with National Centre\npersonnel;\n\n– Meetings with representatives of nine\nhospitals;\n\n– Meetings with representatives of two CHOs;\n\n– Workshop with GP representatives; and\n\n– 12 interviews with third parties involved in the\nimmediate response to the Incident.\n\n**•** Detailed analysis of a wide range of aspects of\nthe review;\n\n**•** Factual accuracy checking and verification\nexercises.\n\n**Important comment on our approach:**\n\nActivities relating to the HSE’s response have been\nevidenced up to 31 July 2021 throughout this report.\nWhere applicable, some evidence of activity after\n31 July 2021 has been included to provide further\ncontext, but this has been highlighted and noted\nspecifically in relevant sections.\n\nDuring our historic review of the preparedness for\nthe Incident and the HSE’s structure, processes and\ninfrastructure, the maximum period of look back is\nfive years.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Summary approach to focus areas:**\n\n\n**Figure 7: Summary approach to focus areas**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.5 Structure of our report\n\nIn the following sections of our report we set out:\n\n**•** **Timeline of the Incident: A timeline of the**\nIncident prior to and after the execution of\nransomware, including actions taken by the\nHSE during the containment, investigation and\nrecovery phases of the Incident, Section 3;\n\n**•** **Key recommendations and findings: Our**\nassessment of the steps that should be taken to\naddress the issues identified in our report and\nour strategic recommendations to remediate the\nissues, Section 4;\n\n**•** **Detailed findings and recommendations by**\n**focus area: Our further detailed findings and**\ntactical recommendations by focus area, which\nincludes the learnings that the HSE can take to\nprotect themselves from a similar major cyber\nincident, Section 5\n\n\n-----\n\n### Timeline of the Incident\n# 3\n\n\n-----\n\nOn 14 May 2021, the HSE was subjected to a\nsignificant cyber attack, through the criminal\ninfiltration of its IT systems using Conti ransomware\nsoftware. The Incident impacted all nine domains\nwithin the NHN, which included statutory and\nvoluntary hospitals and CHOs across the country. A\ndetailed timeline is included in Appendix E and F.\n\nAs part of the response, the HSE engaged the HSE’s\n\n\nIncident Response provider to undertake a forensic\ninvestigation to establish an understanding of what\nthe Attacker did while present on HSE systems prior\nto the Incident. Evidence was identified as to how the\nAttacker was able to gain unauthorised access to the\nHSE’s IT environment and what the Attacker did once\nthey were able to gain this access. The key events\nidentified during this investigation are set out in the\ndiagram below:\n\n\n**Figure 8: Timeline of the Incident**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The timeline of the Incident is broken down, in a chronological order of events from oldest to newest, under the following headings:\n\n • Timeline prior to the Incident;\n\n • Timeline prior to the Incident and the response at Hospital A, a Specialty Hospital (“Hospital C”) and the DoH;\n\n • Timeline of the Incident and the response at the HSE on 14 May 2021;\n\n • Timeline post the Incident and the response and recovery at the HSE.\n\n Timeline prior to the Incident\n\n This section provides a timeline of what the Attacker did while present on HSE systems prior to the execution of the Conti ransomware, including the actions taken by the HSE in response to antivirus detections.\n\n On 18 March 2021, a HSE staff member interacted with a malicious Microsoft Office Excel file attached to a phishing email. This resulted in a Malware\ninfection of the Patient Zero Workstation.\n\nOn 23 March 2021, the Attacker created a\npersistence mechanism on the Patient Zero\nWorkstation to ensure the Attacker retained access to\nthe HSE’s environment if the Patient Zero Workstation\nwas rebooted or powered off.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the HSE’s antivirus software\ndetected the execution of two software tools\ncommonly used by ransomware groups: Cobalt Strike\nand Mimikatz, on the Patient Zero Workstation. The\nantivirus software was set to monitor mode so it did\nnot block the malicious commands.\n\nThe HSE’s Incident Response provider identified no\nsignificant Attacker activity between 1 April 2021 and\n6 May 2021.\n\nOn 7 May 2021, the Attacker installed additional\npersistent Malware on the Patient Zero Workstation,\nconducted AD and domain reconnaissance, and\ncompromised further systems within the HSE. The\nAttacker was identified as using highly privileged\naccounts for the first time.\n\nOn 8 May 2021, first identified evidence of the\nAttacker compromising systems within Hospital K\nand Hospital D.\n\nOn 9 May 2021, first identified evidence of the\nAttacker compromising a system within Hospital J.\n\n\nOn 10 May 2021, first identified evidence of the\nAttacker compromising systems within Hospital\nC and Hospital L. Hospital C’s antivirus software\ndetected Cobalt Strike on two systems but failed to\nquarantine the malicious files.\n\nOn 11 May 2021, first identified evidence of the\nAttacker compromising a system within Hospital A.\nAfter numerous failed logon attempts, the Attacker\nlikely exploited an unpatched known vulnerability,\n\n, to gain access to the domain. Hospital\nA’s antivirus software detected and deleted the\nmalware on several systems.\n\nOn 12 May 2021, first identified evidence of the\nAttacker compromising a system within Hospital B.\nThe Attacker was identified browsing folders, opening\nfiles, creating archives and accessing or attempting\nto access file sharing websites on systems within\nHospital A, Hospital B and Hospital D. The HSE’s\ncybersecurity solutions provider emailed the HSE’s\nSecurity Operations team to escalate alerts on two\nservers and requested a full on demand scan be\ncompleted.[51] The HSE responded on the same day to\nconfirm the scans had been executed.[52]\n\nOn 13 May 2021, first identified evidence of the\nAttacker browsing folders, opening files, creating\narchives and accessing a file sharing website on\nsystems within the HSE. The HSE’s cybersecurity\nsolutions provider emailed the HSE’s Security\nOperations team and outlined that there were\nunhandled threat events since 7 May 2021 on at\nleast 16 systems; the HSE Security Operations team\nrequested that the Server team restart servers.\n\nOn 14 May 2021, the Attacker executed ransomware\non systems within the HSE, Hospital C, Hospital K,\nHospital D, Hospital L, Hospital J and Hospital B.\n\n###### Timeline prior to the Incident and the response at Hospital A, Hospital C and the DoH\n\nTwo voluntary hospitals, Hospital A and Hospital C,\nidentified suspicious activity prior to the Incident.\nIn addition, the DoH, a third party to the HSE’s\nenvironment, successfully acted on a detection of the\nAttacker which prevented the execution of the Conti\nransomware across the vast majority of the DoH.[53]\n\n51 \u0007Email with subject RE: Threat not handled,\n13 May 2021\n52 \u0007Email with subject RE: Threat not handled,\n13 May 2021\n53 \u0007https://www.gov.ie/en/news/d48b2-a-note-forthe-public-on-the-recent-cyber-attack-on-thedepartment-of-health/\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following timeline describes the key activities at\nHospital A, Hospital C and the DoH prior to the Incident.\n\nOn 10 May 2021, Hospital C asked Hospital C’s\ncybersecurity solutions provider whether they should\nbe concerned about Cobalt Strike alerts. They were\nadvised by Hospital C’s cybersecurity solutions\nprovider that since the threat had been remediated\nby their antivirus software, their risk was low.[54]\nHospital C did not initiate a cyber incident response\ninvestigation.\n\nOn 12 May 2021, Hospital A engaged Hospital A’s\nIncident Response provider to investigate alerts of\nmalicious activity. They reset passwords for 4,500\naccounts[55] and made firewall configuration changes[56]\nto contain the activity, and made contact with the\nHSE to request information on two IP addresses.[57]\nTo further contain the activity, Hospital A utilised their\nexisting security tooling across their environment.\n\nOn 13 May 2021, the HSE identified the IP addresses\nreported by Hospital A related to two servers within\nthe HSE’s domain. The HSE conducted an\ninvestigation into the activity identified by Hospital A\nand incorrectly concluded in an email between the\nHSE teams[58] that the suspicious activity originated\nfrom Hospital A, rather than the other way round.\n\nOn 13 May 2021, DoH’s cybersecurity solutions\nprovider[59] alerted the DoH to a potential attack on\ntheir network. DoH contacted the NCSC and engaged\nDoH’s IR Provider[60] who installed endpoint detection\nand response (“EDR”) security tooling on the majority\nof their systems. These actions blocked the execution\nof the Conti ransomware across the vast majority of\nthe DoH’s infrastructure, including critical and data\nservers.\n\n###### Timeline of the Incident and the response at the HSE on 14 May\n\nThe following timeline describes the key activities at\nthe HSE on the day of the Incident, 14 May 2021.\n\nOn 14 May 2021 at approximately 01:00, the Attacker\nexecuted ransomware on systems within the HSE,\nHospital C, Hospital K, Hospital D, Hospital L,\nHospital J and Hospital B.\n\n54 \u0007Logging call with Hospital C’s cybersecurity solutions\nprovider on 10/05/2021 17:06\n55 \u0007Information gathered from an interview with Hospital A\n56 \u0007Information gathered from an interview with Hospital A\n57 \u0007Email with subject: Recognise these addresses??,\nMay 2021\n58 \u0007Email with subject RE: Summary, May 2021\n59 \u0007Information gathered from an interview with the NCSC\n60 \u0007Information gathered from an interview with the NCSC\n\n\nAt 02:50, the HSE’s national service desk received\nthe first of multiple reports from hospitals of\nmultiple systems being unavailable as a result of the\nIncident.[61]\n\nAt 04:36, the HSE identified malicious encryption on\nmultiple servers in the HSE’s data centre.[62]\n\nAt 04:41, due to the widespread reports of\nencryption, and the presence of ransomware in the\nHSE’s data centre, the HSE invoked their Critical\nIncident Process.\n\nAt 05:10, an initial critical incident call was held\nbetween network and infrastructure subject matter\nexperts (“SMEs”). Decisions were taken to contain\nthe threat including removing all internal and external\nconnectivity for the NHN, and to begin engagement\nwith voluntary hospitals.\n\nAt approximately 06:00, the CEO notified the Board of\nthe Incident.\n\nAt 07:00, RTÉ News released a news bulletin on\nthe Incident. Shortly afterwards, the CEO notified\nthe EMT and National Crisis Management Team\n(“NCMT”).\n\nAt 07:28, HSE Live, the HSE contact centre, issued\na tweet notifying the public of an incident and the\nshutdown of services. Shortly afterwards, the HSE’s\nData Protection Officer (“DPO”) rang the office of the\nDPC.\n\nAt 08:30, the first meeting of the NCMT was held.[63]\n\nAt 09:22, The HSE informed Primary Care\nReimbursement Service (“PCRS”) of the cyber\nincident and PCRS decided to shut down their\nsystems.\n\nAt 10:00, it was reported during a Major Incident\n(“MI”) call that the HSE had initiated a preventative\nlockdown strategy to contain the impact of the attack\nby switching off all systems within the HSE. The\nGarda National Cyber Crime Bureau, Interpol and the\nNCSC were brought in to support the response.\n\nAt 10:30, with the support of the NCSC, the HSE\nengaged the HSE’s Incident Response provider to\nprovide incident response services for the HSE. The\nHSE also engaged others such as Third Party C,\nThird Party A, Third Party D, Third Party B and Third\nParty E to provide tactical incident response and\n\n61 \u0007CIM 2 - Conti Ransomware Incident coordination\nForm Ver 2.1(2), 2021\n62 \u0007CIM 2 - Conti Ransomware Incident coordination\nForm Ver 2.1(2), 2021\n63 \u0007Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance\nand Admin V1.10 31052021\n\n\n-----\n\nrecovery support.\n\nAt 12:00, it was reported that a Malware sample was\nsent to a threat research organisation for analysis.\n\nAt 14:00, it was reported that the HSE sent a text\nmessage to all HSE work devices notifying staff\nmembers of a ransomware attack impacting the HSE,\nand voluntary and statutory hospitals.\n\nAt 16:30, it was reported that the HSE’s Incident\nResponse provider began deployment of their\nendpoint security monitoring software to gain visibility\nof the HSE’s environment and enable a full forensic\ninvestigation of systems within the HSE. The MI\nmeeting established a once daily operating rhythm.\n\nLate on the evening of 14 May 2021, the HSE\ninformed the DPC about the Incident.[64]\n\n###### Timeline post the Incident and the response and recovery at the HSE\n\nThe following timeline describes the key activities\npost the Incident from a response and recovery\nperspective at the HSE.\n\n**Response**\n\nOn 15 May 2021, the HSE senior management set\nup a war room at a third party’s office building on\nMolesworth Street.[65] Initial workstreams were set up to\nenable a coordinated response and recovery from the\nIncident. The HSE’s DPO issued a formal notification\nto[66] the DPC about the Incident and the HSE’s\nIncident Response provider was engaged by voluntary\nhospitals to provide incident response support and\nquestionnaires were sent to the voluntary hospitals\nto get an understanding of which entities were\ncompromised. The HSE’s senior leadership team were\nprovided with clean Microsoft mailboxes\nto allow for communication during the initial stages of\nthe response, and a mailbox[67] was set up to deal with\nissues relating to the ransomware attack.\n\nFrom 17 May 2021, the HSE coordinated daily\nincident management meetings between all parties\nsupporting the response to the Incident to ensure that\nthere was a forum to collect and share information.\nThe OoCIO’s Communications team also established\na twice daily meeting rhythm. These forums were\nused to share information about the response and\nto communicate new processes to the rest of the\nbusiness, in an effort to move to a recovery phase,\n\n64 DPC Report 15 July 2021\n65 Programme RAID Log, 2021\n66 Original DPC Notification_May 2021\n67 \u0007Minutes of Cyber Attack MI Meeting 10 am 15052021\n\n\nand to keep members of the public up to date on the\nresponse to the Incident. Key response activities over\nthe following days included, but were not limited to:\n\n**•** An initial list of priority applications was identified,\nthe AD domain was recovered which\nallowed the HSE to build their foundational IT\ninfrastructure;\n\n**•** A ‘go-to-green’ process was proposed for\nrecovering systems and was communicated\nto internal stakeholders for consideration;\n\n**•** A social media monitoring system Talk Walker\nwas set up to scan the web for leaked\npatient data;\n\n**•** The first call between the HSE and the Defence\nForces was held to discuss support requirements;\n\n**•** The application NIMIS was recovered with a\nModel 4 Hospital[68] being the first hospital with\nNIMIS to go live.\n\nIt was also within this timeframe that the CIO, Head\nof Occupational Health and the National Ambulance\nService identified a risk of staff burnout. It was at this\npoint, Occupational Health were requested to attend\nthe war room to check responders’ health, and staff\nrotas were implemented.[69]\n\nFrom 19 May 2021, key response activities included,\nbut were not limited to:\n\n**•** The first clean laptops were distributed to a select\nnumber of HSE staff members and HSE staff\nmembers were given derogation to use personal\nemails and devices for crisis communications;\n\n**•** The initial list of priority applications was\nreprioritised and informed by clinical priorities, as\ndictated by the clinical and integrated governance\nstructure that was initially set up to guide the\noperational response and in an effort to enable a\ntwo way flow of information; and\n\n**•** The HSE established a Legal and Data\nworkstream to oversee the appointment and\nsubsequent work of their legal advisers and to\nsupport the work of the DPO in coordinating the\nHSE’s data protection investigation, engagement\nwith An Garda Síochána and subsequent\nreporting to the DPC.[70]\n\nFive days into the response, the lack of integrated\nprogramme management was recognised as a risk by\n\n68 \u0007NIMIS RE-ENABLEMENT TRACKER CYBER ATTACK\nRECOVERY, 2021\n69 Programme RAID Log\n70 Document subject to legal privilege\n\n\n-----\n\nthe HSE. This led to a request for assistance from the\nDefence Forces who established defined Information\nManagement processes which were scalable and\nagile and could cope with the complexity of a\ncyber crisis.\n\nOn 20 May 2021, the Defence Forces attended\nMolesworth Street for further discussions around the\nlevel of support that was required by the HSE during\nthe response and recovery phases of the Incident.\nIt was reported that on the same day, the Attacker\nposted a link to a software application that would\ndecrypt files encrypted by the Conti ransomware\nduring the Incident. The HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider, on behalf of the HSE, validated that the\ndecryption software worked, reverse engineered\nits capabilities, and produced a new, more stable\ndecryption software that was also supported\nby them.[71] The HSE also secured a High Court\ninjunction[72] restraining any sharing, processing,\nselling or publishing of data stolen from its computer\nsystems.\n\nOn 21 May 2021, the SCA recognised the enormous\nimpact the Incident had on doctors, nurses, midwives\nand allied healthcare professionals, on the provision\nof health and social care services and clinical care\nwithin the HSE.[73] As these professionals were obliged\nto practice without the usual back up of essential\nsystems, clinical imaging and other diagnostic-related\nresults to assist in their assessment and treatment\nof patients, the SCA confirmed these professionals\nwere fully covered by the Clinical Indemnity Scheme\nin relation to their ongoing clinical decision-making, in\nthe absence of such clinical support. Separately, the\nphysical SitCen was also established in CityWest.[74]\n\nOn the same day, the availability of the decryption\nkey allowed the HSE to create efficiencies during the\nrecovery process by deploying a decryptor across the\nenvironment to decrypt files on impacted systems.\nThis enabled HSE to scale their recovery effort and\nmake the overall process\nmore efficient.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nFrom 22 May 2021 onward, the HSE moved from\nthe response phase into the recovery phase, where\nthey focused their efforts on decrypting systems,\n\n71 \u0007HSE’s Incident Response provider, Intrusion\nInvestigation Report\n72 \u0007https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/orderperfected-20-may-2021.pdf\n73 \u0007https://stateclaims.ie/uploads/publications/\nState-Indemnity-Guidance_IT-cyber-attackon-the-health-and-social-care-sector-from-14may-2021_21.5.21_2021-05-21-150239_tytw.pdf\n74 \u0007Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance\nand Admin V1.10, 31 May 2021\n\n\ncleansing workstations, restoring systems and the\nrecovery of applications.\n\nOn 24 May 2021, the HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider and the HSE released their ‘go-to-green’\nprocesses to internal stakeholders, to ensure the\nsecure recovery of systems, reduce the risk of further\nransomware attacks, and to provide guidance in\nrecovering systems. The HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider and the HSE developed requirements that\nevery system within the HSE, voluntary hospitals and\nCHOs had to meet before being able to rejoin the\nnetwork, and for organisations to be reconnected\nback to the NHN.\n\n|Duration|Progress made|\n|---|---|\n|One month after the Incident|The HSE had decrypted 47% of servers and fully restored 48% of Acute applications, 40% of Community Services applications and 64% of business services applications75.|\n|Two months after the Incident|This increased to 94% of servers decrypted and fully restored, 85% of Acute applications, 94% of Community Services applications and 79% of business services applications76.|\n|Three months after the Incident|The HSE reported that 100% of servers were considered decrypted and they had fully restored 95% of Acute applications, 98% of Community Services applications and 91% of business services applications77.|\n\n\nBy 21 September 2021, the HSE had recovered 1,075\napplications, out of a total of 1,087 applications.[78]\nFinally, at the time of issuing this report the HSE had\nnotified the DPC in relation to the Incident, however,\nthey have not made any data subject notification for\npersonal data exposure or exfiltration, however, they\ncontinue to work closely with the DPC in relation to\nthis matter.[79]\n\n75 SITCEN SITUATION REPORT, 18:30 14 June 2021\n76 Weekly Brief, 20 July 2021\n77 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n78 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n79 Document subject to legal privilege\n\n\n**Figure 9: Summary of progress over the following**\n**three months**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key recommendations and findings\n\n###### The Incident demonstrated that the HSE and other organisations connected to the NHN are vulnerable to common cyber attacks that can cause significant impact to the provision of health services. Transformational change is required across the technology foundation for provision of health services, and its associated cybersecurity, that will need to be executed over the coming years. There is an imperative for the HSE to act with urgency in ensuring the necessary plans, vision, leadership, resource and budget are in place to drive this significant change to build a secure, resilient and future-fit technology foundation for provision of national healthcare services.\n# 4\n\n\n-----\n\nSection 4.1 summarises from the detailed findings\nfour strategic areas where transformational change is\nrequired, likely over a period of several years. Further\ndetails that underpin these can be found in Section 5.\n\nGiven the high risk exposure at present, we highlight\nin Section 4.2 some tactical recommendations\nfor which immediate attention is required to\nachieve urgent impact and to contribute to the\ndevelopment and implementation of the strategic\nrecommendations.\n\nSection 5 describes in detail a number of\nrecommendations to address learnings that the HSE\nshould take from the Incident, with a supporting key\nrecommendation mapping in Appendix G.\n\n###### 4.1 Strategic recommendations\n\nIn order to deliver a significant and sustainable\nchange in the exposure to cybersecurity risk, four\nareas of strategic focus are required across the HSE\nand other parties connected to the NHN:\n\n**•** Governance of IT and cybersecurity;\n\n**•** Leadership and transformation of the IT\nfoundation on which provision of health services\ndepends;\n\n**•** Leadership and transformation of cybersecurity\ncapability; and\n\n**•** Development of clinical and services continuity\nand crisis management capability to encompass\n‘service-wide’ events such as prolonged total\noutage of IT.\n\nThere are dependencies across these four areas\nand they need to be progressed in parallel. They are\ndescribed in the strategic recommendations below,\nwith further supporting recommendations provided\nin Section 5 of this report.\n\n\n###### 1. Implement an enhanced governance structure over IT and cybersecurity that will provide appropriate focus, attention and oversight.\n\n\n**1.1 Establish clear responsibilities for IT and**\n**cybersecurity across all parties that connect to**\n**the NHN, share health data or access shared**\n**health services. Establish a ‘code of connection’**\n**that sets minimum cybersecurity requirements**\n**for all parties and develop an assurance**\n**mechanism to ensure adherence.**\n\n\nOne of the challenges faced by the HSE is that\ncybersecurity risk materialises as a ‘common risk’\nto all organisations connected to the NHN given\nthe interconnected nature of the IT systems. This\nhas resulted from the direction of digital healthcare\ndemanding greater interconnectivity, ability to share\ninformation and access to common services. Under\nthe governance constructs of the health service,\norganisations have varying levels of autonomy over\nIT and cybersecurity decision making, yet the risk is\nshared - with organisations dependent on each other\nfor cybersecurity. There is no ‘code of connection’\nfor all parties that connect to the NHN, share\nhealth data or use shared services in order to set a\nminimum baseline of security standards. The HSE’s\nIT Security Policy was written in 2013, with the last\nupdate in 2014, and does not reflect the controls and\ncapabilities required to manage cyber risk in 2021.\n\nIn order to manage the ‘common risks’ effectively,\nclarity is required over responsibilities and decision\nrights of all parties. In addition, the HSE must be able\nto set minimum standards for IT and cybersecurity,\nand ensure compliance to those standards by all\norganisations connected to the NHN. These minimum\nstandards are required in order to ensure there is\nconfidence in all organisations connected to the\nNHN that they are not themselves exposed due to\ninadequate cybersecurity controls in an organisation\nthat they are connected to.\n\n\n-----\n\n**1.2 Establish an executive level cybersecurity**\n**oversight committee to drive continuous**\n**assessment of cybersecurity risk and a**\n**cybersecurity transformation programme across**\n**the provision of health services.**\n\n\nof autonomy over IT decisions remains. It will also be\ncrucial in directing the evolution of an IT infrastructure\nand service provision that aligns with the objectives\nof Sláintecare, and establishment of appropriate\nlevels of resourcing.\n\n\nThe HSE has initiated a number of tactical\nimprovements post the Incident to better secure\nsystems as they have been recovered. However,\nthis will not lead to the level of cyber risk reduction\nrequired to significantly and sustainably reduce the\nrisk of further ransomware (or other) attacks.\n\nWithin the HSE, there is no dedicated executive\noversight committee that provides direction and\noversight to cybersecurity, both within the HSE and\nall organisations connected to the NHN. A known\nlow level of cyber security maturity, including critical\nissues with cybersecurity capability, has persisted\nfor years with little progress. An Information Security\nProject Board ceased operating in 2013.\n\nA challenge faced in ensuring cybersecurity of\nhealth systems is balancing the need for ease-ofuse, especially for clinical staff, with cybersecurity\nimperatives. For example, implementation of\nincreased levels of cybersecurity controls such as\n‘Multi Factor Authentication’ will have an impact on\nworking procedures. It is therefore important that\nthe cybersecurity oversight committee includes\nparticipation from user groups, so that culturally\ncybersecurity moves from being perceived as an IT\nchallenge, to being perceived as ‘how we work’.\n\nFinally, the cybersecurity oversight committee should\nbe accountable for ensuring compliance with the\nevolving requirements of the EU NISD for essential\nservices across the health service.\n\n\n**1.4 Establish a board committee (or repurpose**\n**an existing one) to oversee the transformation**\n**of IT and cybersecurity to deliver a future-**\n**fit, resilient technology base for provision of**\n**digitally-enabled health services, and ensure**\n**that IT and cybersecurity risks remain within**\n**a defined risk appetite. Consider the inclusion**\n**of further specialist non-executive members**\n**of the committee in order to provide additional**\n**expertise and insight to the committee.**\n\n\n**1.3 Establish an executive level oversight**\n**committee for IT.**\n\n\nWith a fragmented set of decision rights over IT\ndevelopment and support across the provision of\nhealth services, a necessary enabler for driving\ntransformational change will be the establishment\nof an executive level committee that can agree the\npriorities for IT development and investment, and\nalign all interested parties behind a clear vision,\nstrategy and plan.\n\nThis committee should be chaired by the Chief\nTechnology & Transformation Officer (see\nRecommendation 2 below) and drive reporting on\nall aspects of IT hygiene (such as status of legacy\nsystems) as well as progress in implementation\nof strategy. Critical to its success will be the\nparticipation of IT leaders from across the health\nservice, in particular hospital groups, where a degree\n\n\nCybersecurity was recorded as a ‘High’ risk in the\nCorporate Risk Register in Q1 2019.[80] At the time\nof the Incident, the risk rating for cybersecurity on\nthe Corporate Risk Register was 16, based on a\nlikelihood scoring of 4 (likely, with a 75% probability)\nand an impact scoring of ‘Major’.[81] The HSE’s risk\nassessment tool is described in Appendix H.\n\nRisks on the Register are subject to a quarterly review\nprocess and the quarterly reports are reviewed by\nthe relevant Board Committee. The Performance\nand Delivery Committee of the Board reviewed the\ncyber risk with management in September 2020[82]\nand this was followed by a revised mitigation\nplan. The Committee includes two experienced IT\nleaders in large organisations, although they are not\ncybersecurity specialists. This revised mitigation plan\nhad a number of actions due to be completed post\nthe date of the Incident. The actions completed prior\nto the Incident did not materially impact the risk faced\nin this area.\n\nThe HSE’s IT-related risks had been presented at\nBoard level on a number of occasions. However,\nthe gravity of cybersecurity exposure was not fully\narticulated to the Board, given the HSE’s level\nof vulnerability to a cyber attack, or assessed\nagainst a defined risk appetite. Known issues with\ncybersecurity capability have made limited progress\nover the course of several years.\n\nOther organisations with a critical cybersecurity\nexposure, and a need to drive significant technology\ntransformation have found a dedicated committee of\nthe board beneficial in order to raise the priority and\nfocus to an appropriate level and ensure risks are\nappropriately communicated and understood.\n\n80 \u0007Q1, 2019 CRR COMBINED Document for April LT\nmeeting.pdf\n81 \u0007CRR Q4 2020 Full Report post EMT meeting February\n2021 v0.1 09 02 21.pdf\n82 \u0007Minutes-hse-performance-and-delivery-committee18-september-2020.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the scale of change required across the\nprovision of health services, it is recommended that\na focused committee of the board is established,\nwith relevant training provided. Consideration\nshould be given to appointing additional individuals\nto that committee with specialist skills to act in a\nnon-executive capacity and enhance the ability\nfor the committee to support and oversee the IT\nand cybersecurity transformation. A key role for\nthe committee will be to ensure that HSE requests\nfor government funding (e.g. to DPER) to invest in\naddressing IT and cybersecurity issues are clearly\narticulated, and the risks associated with lack of\ninvestment are communicated and understood.\n\n###### 2. Establish a transformational Chief Technology & Transformation Officer (CTTO) and office to create a vision and architecture for a resilient and future-fit technology capability; to lead the delivery of the significant transformation programme that is required, and to build the increased function that will be necessary to execute such a scale of IT change.\n\n**The national health service is operating on a**\n**frail IT estate with an architecture that has**\n**evolved rather than be designed for resilience**\n**and security.**\n\nThe NHN is primarily an unsegmented (or undivided)\nnetwork, and can be described as a “flat” network,\nto make it easy for staff to access the IT applications\nthey require. However, this design exposes the HSE\nto the risk of cyber attacks from other organisations\nconnected to the NHN, as well as exposing other\norganisations to cyber attacks originating from the\nHSE - since once an attacker has a presence on the\nnetwork they have ‘freedom to roam’. This network\narchitecture, coupled with a complex and unmapped\nset of permissions for systems administrators to\naccess systems across the NHN, enabled the\nAttacker to access a multitude of systems across\nmany organisations connected to the NHN and create\nthe large-scale impact that they did.\n\nPart of the frailty of the IT estate is an over-reliance\non legacy systems.\n\nThe HSE also has\nover 30,000 outdated Windows 7 legacy systems\nrunning on workstations. One reason cited for the\ncontinued proliferation of Windows 7 systems is that\na key shared service for handling medical imaging,\n\n\nNIMIS, is not supported by the manufacturer to\nfunction on more modern Windows desktops\nwithout being upgraded. The upgrade has not been\nrolled out, despite Windows 7 being deemed ‘endof-life’ by Microsoft in January 2020, with many\norganisations upgrading to Windows 10 several years\nprior to that. Some hospitals have implemented an\nunofficial workaround to enable NIMIS to operate on\nWindows 10 machines, with potential implications\non the support and warranty arrangements for their\nuse of the application, and work to minimise the\ndependency on Windows 7 is continuing.\n\nThe parts of the health service that were arguably\nbest-equipped to maintain clinical services in the face\nof prolonged IT outages were those that rely on paper\nrecords for patient services. Whilst this was a positive\nfeature in managing the Incident, it highlights the\nextent to which modernisation is required across the\nhealth service to enable the adoption of digital health\nservices. The relative disadvantage in this Incident for\norganisations who are more dependent on technology\nservices illustrates the critical need for resiliency to\nbe built into the IT architecture and systems to foster\nthe confidence required to enable future migration to\nmore digital provision of health services.\n\nReducing cybersecurity risk requires both a\ntransformation in cybersecurity capability (see\nrecommendation 3) and IT transformation, to\naddress the issues of a legacy IT estate and build\ncybersecurity and resilience into the IT architecture.\n\n\nThe HSE has operated since the end of 2018 with\nan interim Chief Information Officer with a limited\npractical mandate, authority and resource to effect\nchange across all organisations connected to the\nNHN. The level of resourcing in critical IT functions\nis significantly lower than we would expect for an\norganisation with the size of IT estate that the HSE\nhas; the IT organisation consists of approximately\n350 FTE, serving a population of over 70,000 enduser devices. This observation has been consistently\nmade in interviews, both within the HSE and from\nexternal parties who interfaced with them during the\nIncident, and was a known issue within HSE prior to\nthe Attack with an additional 300 FTE approved for\nrecruitment shortly before the Incident.\n\nThe lack of investment in IT resources over a\nsustained period of time has clearly limited the ability\nof the HSE to drive modernisation and maintain\n\n\n**2.1 Appoint a permanent Chief Technology**\n**& Transformation Officer with the mandate**\n**and authority to develop and execute a**\n**multi-year technology transformation, build**\n**an appropriate level of IT resource for an**\n**organisation the scale of the HSE and oversee**\n**the running of technology services.**\n\n\n-----\n\nthe IT estate to be resilient and secure. In addition,\nthe scarce resource in critical IT functions resulted\nin significant key-person dependencies during the\nIncident management and recovery, which was\nundoubtedly a contributing factor to the extended\nlength of the recovery process.\n\nIn interviews with hospitals and other providers,\nit was observed that this incident has highlighted\nthe need to build greater IT resource within many\nof those organisations, as well as at HSE centre,\nincluding representation on leadership committees.\nThe CTTO should develop a resourcing plan for the\nwhole health service that will be sufficient to deliver a\ntransformational strategy, and maintain a resilient and\nsecure IT estate.\n\nThe CTTO should assume responsibility for all\ncapabilities that currently sit within the OoCIO,\nas well as a broadened capability to drive rapid\ntransformation. The CTTO should be a member of the\nEMT reporting to the CEO.\n\nThe ransomware incident has served to highlight the\nextent to which the provision of health services is\ndependent on an effective and resilient IT capability.\nThe opportunity needs to be seized to reflect this\nincreased understanding of the criticality of IT with\na repositioning of leadership, funding and level of\nresource.\n\n\n**2.2 Under the office of the CTTO, develop an IT**\n**strategy to achieve a secure, resilient and future-**\n**fit IT architecture, required for the scale of the**\n**HSE organisation.**\n\n\nIn order to deliver the transformation required to the\ntechnology foundation of the health service in Ireland,\na clear strategy is required that can be used to secure\ncommitment to execution across all organisations\ninvolved in the provision of health services, and the\nsignificant funding that will be required over many\nyears.\n\nThe HSE has had a plan for the development of IT\nthat has been used to secure funding for individual\nprojects. However it has not been tied to a vision,\nstrategy and architecture that is deliverable over\na period of years and that provides the necessary\nlevel of resilience through investment in enabling IT\narchitecture and fallback solutions in the event of\ncore technology failure. Many interviewees expressed\nfrustration with an apparent approach of investing\nin ‘new projects’ or ‘new features’ rather than the\nholistic delivery and maintenance of a technology\nfoundation for health service provision.\n\nThe development of the IT strategy and target\narchitecture also needs to explicitly address the\n\n\narchitecture for deployment of medical devices.\nWhilst not in scope for this review, it is apparent that\nreliance is placed on medical device manufacturers\nto specify how they should be deployed within\nthe overall IT architecture, with no HSE-mandated\napproach to ensuring they could not be impacted by\na cyber attack.\n\nA key requirement for the IT transformation plan that\nwill be critical to the ability to recover from a similar\nincident in the future will be clear alignment between\ncritical clinical services and the IT applications and\ninfrastructure they depend on. The recovery activities\nfollowing the ransomware incident would have\nbenefited greatly from such a view, and speed of\ndecision-making and recovery increased.\n\n###### 3. Appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and establish a suitably resourced and skilled cybersecurity function. Develop and drive the implementation of a cybersecurity transformation programme.\n\nThe HSE has a very low level of cybersecurity\nmaturity (Section 5.3 of this report gives an evaluation\nof maturity against the industry standard ‘NIST’\ncybersecurity framework). Examples of the lack of\ncybersecurity controls in place at the time of the\nIncident include:\n\n**•** The IT environment did not have many of the\ncybersecurity controls that are most effective\nat detecting and preventing human-operated\nransomware attacks;\n\n**•** There was no security monitoring capability\nthat was able to effectively detect, investigate\nand respond to security alerts across HSE’s IT\nenvironment or the wider NHN;\n\n**•** There was a lack of comprehensive effective\npatching (updates, bug fixes etc.) across the\nIT estate of all organisations connected to the\nNHN; and\n\n**•** Reliance was placed on a single antivirus product\nthat was not monitored or effectively maintained\nwith updates across the estate. For example, the\nworkstation on which the Attacker gained their\ninitial foothold did not have antivirus signatures\nupdated for over a year.\n\nThe low level of cybersecurity maturity, combined\nwith the frailty of the IT estate, enabled the Attacker\nin this incident to achieve their objectives with relative\nease. The Attacker was able to use well-known and\nsimple attack techniques to move around the NHN,\n\n\n-----\n\nextract data and deploy ransomware software over\nlarge parts of the estate, without detection.\n\n\n**3.2 Develop and drive the execution of a multi-**\n**year cybersecurity transformation programme**\n**to deliver an acceptable level of cybersecurity**\n**capability for a national health service.**\n\n\n**3.1 Appoint a CISO and establish a suitably**\n**resourced and skilled cybersecurity function.**\n\n\nThe HSE has not had a single responsible owner\nfor cybersecurity at either senior executive or\nmanagement level, responsible for cybersecurity\nleadership and direction. This is highly unusual for\nan organisation of the HSE’s size and complexity\nwith reliance on technology for delivering critical\noperations and handling large amounts of sensitive\ndata. As a consequence, there was no senior\ncybersecurity specialist able to ensure recognition\nof the risks that the organisation faced due to\nits cybersecurity posture and the growing threat\nenvironment.\n\nThe HSE lacked a detailed and holistic cybersecurity\nstrategy, operating model and transformation plan\nthat outlined the strategic, tactical and operational\nactivities required to mitigate known weaknesses and\nreduce cyber risk exposure.\n\nThe CISO should be at National Director level, a\ndirect report to the CTTO, and have appropriate\naccess to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure that\ncybersecurity risks are understood and considered in\nall decision-making. They should be responsible for\ncybersecurity operations as well as driving strategic\nand tactical actions to transform cybersecurity\ncapability, and providing updates to the Board. Whilst\nrecruitment of a permanent CISO may take some\ntime, appointment of an interim CISO should be\nconsidered in the short term.\n\nThe HSE also only had circa 15 FTE in cybersecurity\nroles, and they did not possess the expertise and\nexperience to perform the tasks expected of them.\nFor example, alerts were generated by antivirus\nsoftware on key systems in the days leading up to the\nattack, which were passed to the cybersecurity team.\nHowever, there was insufficient expertise, and a lack\nof expertly-designed triaging processes to appreciate\nthe significance of the alerts and take appropriately\nurgent action to prevent the attack resulting in\nsignificant disruption to systems. As a result,\nopportunities to prevent the crisis were missed.\n\nA critical requirement for the HSE to begin to develop\nthe ability to prevent and detect a similar incident in\nthe future is the appointment of senior cybersecurity\nleadership and the development of a suitably skilled\nand resourced cybersecurity function. These skilled\nresources are currently scarce and the HSE may need\nto consider co-sourcing arrangements to support\nrequirements in this area.\n\n\nIt is apparent that significant capability and controls\nneed to be built and implemented across HSE and\nother organisations involved in the provision of health\nservices, in order to achieve even a basic level of\nprotection against cyber attacks. This will need\nto dovetail with the transformation of IT, but also\nextend beyond IT into ‘the way people work’ (see\nrecommendation 1.2 above).\n\nThere will therefore need to be a multi-year\nprogramme to transform cybersecurity capability in\na holistic way to ensure that the provision of health\nservices in Ireland, and the data that those health\nservices handle, becomes less vulnerable to cyber\nattacks. Further detail as to a suggested structure of\nthe programme is given in Section 5.\n\n###### 4. Implement a clinical and services continuity transformation programme reporting to the National Director for Governance and Risk and enhance crisis management capabilities to encompass events such as wide-impact cyber attacks or large-scale loss of IT.\n\n\nThe HSE and associated organisations such as\nhospitals, CHOs, and GPs have dealt with a number\nof crises over recent years that have required\ndevelopment of clinical and services continuity plans\nand the ‘muscle memory’ that comes from repeatedly\nmanaging incidents. Indeed one voluntary hospital\ndescribed the short-term outage of certain local IT\nsystems as a regular occurrence that their BusinessAs-Usual processes were designed to accommodate.\n\nIt is apparent that much of the planning for clinical\nand services continuity (a more appropriate name for\nthe ‘business continuity’ discipline in the HSE) has\noccurred at local level, for specific organisations,\nand there has not been a programme to ensure\nconsistency of clinical and services continuity\nplanning across all health service organisations\nand the HSE centre itself, and cross-sharing of\nleading thinking.\n\n\n**4.1 Implement a clinical and services continuity**\n**transformation programme reporting to the**\n**National Director for Governance and Risk.**\n**Establish an Operational Resilience Policy**\n**and Resilience Steering Committee to drive**\n**integration between resilience-related disciplines,**\n**and an overarching approach to resilience.**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, as is the case with many other\norganisations, the scenario of sustained loss of IT\nacross the entire health service has not been planned\nfor, with specific considerations and playbooks. As\na result, both within organisations and at the HSE\ncentre, great efforts were required ‘in the moment’\nto manage the impacts of the ransomware attack\non clinical services, implement workarounds and\nmanage patient risk. The success of these efforts was\nsignificantly due to the personal commitment, energy\nand ingenuity of individuals across all organisations,\nwith no plans or playbooks for such an event that\ncould be relied upon.\n\nA particular challenge faced during the recovery\nprocess was the identification and prioritisation of\ncritical systems for recovery. Processes were rapidly\ndeveloped during the days and weeks following the\nIncident, to identify the most critical health services\nfor recovery and to map them back to IT systems\nand infrastructure. However, the understanding and\nmap of the dependencies between specific clinical\nservices and IT systems had not been developed\nprior to the Incident. Development of this dependency\nmap is a critical requirement for clinical and services\ncontinuity planning for future similar events.\n\nDuring the recovery process in the days following\nthe ransomware attack it became apparent that\ndisaster recovery (DR) arrangements for IT systems\nwere ad hoc and inconsistent. With the Attacker\nable to corrupt some primary data stores for disaster\nrecovery, there was a requirement to identify\nsecondary stores and attempt to recover from them.\nA workstream was initiated to attempt to locate them\nand test the viability of recovery. Were systems to\nhave been recovered using this method, they would\nhave been recovered to different points in time\nthat backups were available for, and there was no\nconfidence in the completeness (or in some cases\ntested viability) of recovery solutions. As a result,\nwhen the decryption key became available from\nthe Attacker, the decision was made to abandon\nwork to recover from backups, and instead recover\nsystems from their production environment, using\nthe decryption capability provided by the Attacker. It\ncannot be confidently asserted that all health services\nwould have been able to recover in a timely manner\n(or even at all) without the provision of the decryption\nkey by the Attacker.\n\nThe HSE has recognised that clinical and services\ncontinuity as a risk discipline has not developed\nat the pace needed with executive oversight\nand focus. A National Director for Governance\nand Risk (equivalent to a Chief Risk Officer) has\nbeen appointed, and assigned responsibility for\nestablishing a clinical and services continuity\nframework, through which risk management and\ncontinuity plans will be reviewed, maintained and\n\n\nvalidated. Responsibility for clinical and service\ncontinuity under the HSE’s accountability structure\nwill remain with operational and functional managers.\nA programme and resource is required to develop\nthe consistency and breadth of planning across\nthe health service, including establishing clear\nrequirements for disaster recovery capability to be\nimplemented by the IT transformation programme,\nand the mapping of clinical processes to IT systems\nand data.\n\nIn addition, the HSE should establish an Operational\nResilience Policy and Steering Committee to\ndrive integration between resilience-related\ndisciplines across the organisation, such as incident\nmanagement, crisis management, clinical and\nservices continuity and enterprise risk management\nplus disciplines that can impact on resilience such as\ncybersecurity and physical security.\n\n\n**4.2 Enhance crisis management capabilities to**\n**encompass events such as wide-impact cyber**\n**attacks or large-scale loss of IT.**\n\n\nIt is indisputable that the HSE has extensive\nexperience in managing crises, for example in the\ncritical role it has fulfilled for the nation in navigating\nthe COVID-19 crisis. This has resulted in some\neffective mechanisms for crisis management not\njust being designed, but regularly used. In addition,\nsignificant effort has been expended in planning for\nlarge-scale external events that the health service\nwill be required to manage such as a plane crash\nor security incident in a city. Mechanisms that have\nbeen developed from previous crises served well\nin managing this crisis - of particular note was the\neffectiveness of communications out to the general\npublic and media.\n\nHowever, the nature of the crisis resulting from\nthe ransomware attack was different, and required\nelements of capability that have not previously been\nrequired. For example: communicating with all staff\nin the health service without internal emails or other\nIT collaboration tools; establishing a wide variety\nof communication channels and forums to gather\ninformation and feedback to prioritise recovery of\nsystems, and issuing clear guidance to all parties\nimpacted by the Incident that was relevant to their\nlocalised situation. Even establishing a coherent set\nof facts from which to build communications to the\npublic proved to be challenging, as is typical in\na ransomware recovery situation.\n\nThe establishment of a crisis management centre\nand working group, initially in a third party\norganisation’s offices and subsequently in City West,\nwere examples of crisis management structures that\nhad to be developed ‘in-the-moment’ rather than\n\n\n-----\n\nbeing pre-planned. Support from the Defence Forces\nand other parties enabled an effective structure and\nset of information flows to be developed rapidly, but\nthis evolved over several days and critical time was\nlost in the recovery process as a result.\n\nThe nature of a ransomware attack, resulting in\neffectively total loss of IT, makes it particularly\nchallenging to manage with a unique set of issues\nto be navigated. Investment is required in crisis\nmanagement planning, resourcing tools and\nprocesses in the HSE and associated organisations\nin order to be prepared to manage this kind of\ncrisis in the future.\n\n###### 4.2 Immediate tactical actions\n\n**As highlighted above, there is a requirement**\n**for a transformational body of work over**\n**several years to make strategic changes to**\n**the governance, leadership and capability**\n**across IT, cybersecurity, clinical and services**\n**continuity and crisis management. Given the**\n**high risk exposure at present, we highlight in**\n**this section some tactical recommendations**\n**for which immediate attention is required to**\n**achieve urgent impact and to contribute to the**\n**development and implementation of the strategic**\n**recommendations. Further information on these,**\n**and other recommendations, is given in Section 5.**\n\n###### 1. Response to the Incident\n\n\n\n**•** Determine the course of action to be taken, such\nas, informing data subjects and referring identified\npotential data breaches to other organisations.\n\nThe DPO should continue to work closely and\nmaintain regular dialogue with the DPC until the\nconclusion of the HSE’s data protection investigation\n(see key recommendation FA2.KR20 in section 5.2).\n\n\nAs the HSE has moved out of the ‘crisis phase’ of\nresponding to the ransomware attack, it should put\nin place sustainable governance to manage and\nresolve the risks and issues originating from the\nIncident to HSE’s data (see FA2. KR22.2 in section\n5.2).\n\nDuring the Incident, workarounds were implemented\nacross the HSE, Hospital Groups/hospitals and CHOs\nto allow clinical services to continue operating. This\noften resulted in teams reverting back to paperbased records. There are multiple ongoing efforts to\nreconcile these paper based records with the data in\nrecovered clinical applications. Until this is complete\nthere is a risk\nthat clinical services are impacted by patients\nnot having up-to-date medical records in the\nappropriate systems.\n\nMembers of staff used personal email accounts and\ndevices for information sharing and communication.\nThe HSE issued a communication in August 2021 to\nstand down the use of personal emails and ensure all\ndata was deleted from local storage areas. However,\nsome stakeholders from hospitals and CHOs reported\nthey have not received clear guidance on the steps\nrequired to address this risk.\n\nThe HSE should establish centralised governance\nover these activities. This should initiate a review of\nthe scope of work required to resolve these risks and\nissues, provide the necessary resources to prioritise\nthis work and track it through to completion, across\nall HGs/hospitals and CHOs.\n\n\n**1.2 Continue to reconcile medical data stored**\n**and managed through interim processes post**\n**the ransomware attack and place centralised**\n**governance over these activities.**\n\n\n**1.1 Complete the ongoing work being performed**\n**by the Legal and Data workstream and continue**\n**to work closely with the Data Protection**\n**Commissioner (DPC).**\n\n\nThe HSE established a Legal and Data workstream\nto support the work of their Data Protection Officer\n(DPO) in coordinating the HSE’s data protection\ninvestigation, engagement with An Garda Síochána,\nand subsequent reporting to the DPC.\n\nThrough forensic analysis of systems, and review\nof data sets, this workstream will need, to the\nextent possible, undertake the following actions:\n\n**•** Assess the likelihood that the attacker took\na copy of data from systems on the NHN;\n\n**•** Assess the content of data sets at risk for\npersonal data;\n\n**•** Assess whether any potential breaches meet\nthe threshold to be reported to the DPC;\n\n\nThe HSE should collect, organise and document\nartefacts created as part of the response and\nrecovery to the ransomware cyber attack.\n\nThe HSE was able to gather a significant amount\nof information during the response to the Incident,\n\n\n**1.3 Collate and manage artefacts created**\n**in response to the Incident, including initial**\n**production of an asset register.**\n\n\n-----\n\nfor example key information about the technology\nunderpinning the clinical applications that were\nbeing used across the HSE, hospitals and CHOs.\nIn addition, response processes and plans were\ndeveloped that would be invaluable in the event\nof a similar attack in future.\n\nThese documents will provide a foundation for\ndeveloping an up-to-date asset and application\nregister, as well as plans that will assist in\nthe response to future incidents (see key\nrecommendation FA1.KR11 in section 5.1\nfor further detail).\n\n\nHSE should also bring the governance of ongoing\ntactical IT and cybersecurity improvement projects,\nthat have been initiated following recommendations\nfrom the retained Incident Response provider under\nthe tactical cybersecurity improvement programme\n(see key recommendation FA1.KR7 and KR8 in\nsection 5.1).\n\n###### 2. Security monitoring\n\n\n**1.4 Appoint an interim senior leader for**\n**cybersecurity (a CISO) to be responsible**\n**for driving forward tactical cybersecurity**\n**improvements, managing third-parties that**\n**provide cybersecurity services and leading the**\n**cybersecurity response to cyber incidents.**\n\n\n**2.1 Ensure that the HSE’s Incident Response**\n**provider’s managed defence service or an**\n**equivalent is maintained to detect and respond**\n**to incidents on endpoints (i.e. laptops, desktops,**\n**servers etc.) to provide protection to the entirety**\n**of the NHN.**\n\n\nThe HSE should appoint an interim senior leader\nfor cybersecurity (a CISO) who has experience in\nrapidly reducing the vulnerability of organisations to\nthreats, and designing cyber security transformation\nprogrammes (see key recommendation FA1.KR1\nin section 5.1).\n\nThis role should be responsible for placing\ngovernance around cybersecurity improvements\n(see immediate tactical action 1.5), identifying a\nsustainable medium-term managed detection and\nresponse solution (see immediate tactical action 2.1),\nand leading the cybersecurity response to cyber\nincidents. The role should also be responsible for\ndeveloping processes to manage third-parties that\nprovide security services, and providing the expertise\nto oversee the successful delivery of these.\n\n\nThe HSE has engaged their Incident Response\nprovider to continue providing a managed detection\nand response service. This capability is the most\ncrucial defence HSE has against further ransomware\nattacks at present, providing a valuable ‘safety net’\ngiven the inherent weaknesses in cyber security\ncontrols across the estate (see key recommendation\nFA1.KR6 in section 5.1).\n\nThe HSE should identify a sustainable plan to\nensure the HSE’s Incident Response provider\nservice or an equivalent service is continued across\nall organisations connected to the NHN. Whether\nthrough formalising the continuation of the current\nservice, or replacing in parts of the NHN with a\nnew service, the objective should be to ensure that\nequivalent levels of service are maintained, including:\nusing Endpoint Detection and Response tooling\nto detect malicious activity on endpoints; 24/7\nmonitoring; and triage and investigation of\nsecurity alerts.\n\n\n**1.5 Formalise a programme and governance to**\n**respond to tactical recommendations arising**\n**from the Incident Response investigation and**\n**provide assurance over their implementation.**\n\n\n**2.2 Establish an initial cybersecurity incident**\n**monitoring and response capability to drive**\n**immediate improvement to the ability to detect**\n**and respond to cybersecurity events.**\n\n\nThe HSE should mobilise a tactical cybersecurity\nimprovement programme, with governance that feeds\ninto the interim CISO (see immediate tactical action\n1.4) and can provide updates on the programme’s\nprogress into the Board committee. Dedicated\nresources should be used to deliver this programme.\n\nThe programme should be structured around tactical\nwork packages that can be delivered at pace\nusing focused governance and reporting to drive\naccountability. The programme should also include\na process to triage all third party recommendations,\nand fixes to security control gaps identified internally,\ninto tactical or strategic activities.\n\n\nThe HSE should drive immediate improvement to\nthe ability to detect and respond to cybersecurity\nevents, by augmenting the existing security\noperations function with additional team members\nwith experience and expertise in cybersecurity\nmonitoring and response. This augmented team\nshould document, establish and operate an initial\nprocess to triage, investigate, contain and respond to\ncybersecurity events (see key recommendation FA1.\nKR11 a in section 5.1).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. Ability to respond to a similar incident in the near future\n\n\n**3.1 Review the process for managing internal**\n**crisis communications including resources.**\n\n\nThe HSE should formalise and document the process\nrequired to manage internal communications during\na crisis response similar to that required in the\nIncident, including cascading call trees and audience\nsegmentation via secure ‘out of band’ notification and\ncommunication platforms (see key recommendation\nFA2.KR19 in section 5.2).\n\nThe HSE should assess the requirements of their\ninternal communications process and plan for a crisis\nresponse similar to that required in the Incident and\nallocate adequate resources to grow the Internal\nCommunications team (see key recommendation\nFA2.KR6 in section 5.2).\n\n\nthe third-parties are reporting to them (see immediate\ntactical recommendation 1.4).\n\nThe HSE should work with the retained cybersecurity\nincident response provider to ensure they have\nsufficient understanding of the HSE’s organisation\nand technology, and be available within defined\nservice level agreements to assist the HSE respond\nto security alerts (see key recommendation\nFA1.KR11 f in section 5.1).\n\n###### 4. IT environment\n\n\nThe HSE should prioritise the remediation of critical\nlegacy systems. Immediate efforts should focus on\nprioritising the upgrade of the NIMIS system, as this\nis currently inhibiting the upgrade of a significant\nproportion of 30,000 Windows workstations from\nWindows 7 to Windows 10.\n\nIn considering the acceleration of the NIMIS upgrade,\nHSE should review if the configuration changes\nmade in one hospital (Hospital A) to enable the\napplication to run on Windows 10 can be more\nwidely implemented, and supported by the vendor,\nto expedite the central Windows 10 rollout plans (see\nkey recommendation FA1.KR11 g in section 5.1).\n\n\n**4.1 Implement an upgrade to NIMIS to allow**\n**Windows 10 upgrade, thereby addressing known**\n**vulnerabilities and support issues associated**\n**with current wide deployment of Windows 7.**\n\n\n**3.2 Develop a plan for response and**\n**management of an NHN-wide similar incident**\n**taking recent learnings into account.**\n\n\nThe HSE should develop, document and exercise a\nplan for managing and coordinating a cybersecurity\nincident involving multiple organisations connected\nto the NHN. This plan should be invoked by any\norganisations connected to the NHN if they detected\na security incident that may have wider implications.\n\nThe HSE IT and security teams should identify\ndocuments required to respond to a ransomware\nattack (e.g. network diagrams, asset list) and secure\nthese in a cloud repository (see key recommendation\nFA1.KR11 f in section 5.1).\n\n\n**4.2 Formalise existing roles and responsibilities**\n**for IT across the entities accessing the NHN and**\n**establish SLAs for centrally-provided services,**\n**while also ensuring information security policies**\n**align with those responsibilities.**\n\n\n**3.3 Establish retainers with appropriate SLAs**\n**for third party incident and crisis management**\n**response support, together with processes and**\n**sufficient internal expertise to direct and manage**\n**the third-parties.**\n\n\nThe HSE should ensure it has a fit-for-purpose set\nof capabilities under retained contract with external\nproviders to enable a more effective response\nto an incident similar to the Incident in the near\nfuture. This should include support for operation\nof crisis management functions, legal support and\ncybersecurity incident response services (see FA2.\nKR13 in section 5.2).\n\nThe HSE should also ensure that they have\ndeveloped the processes to effectively manage these\nretained third-parties in the event of an incident,\nand that they have sufficient expertise to provide\nchallenge and understand the implications of what\n\n\nThe HSE should establish clear responsibilities for\nIT and cybersecurity across all parties that connect\nto the NHN, or share health data, or access shared\nhealth services. This formalisation of responsibilities\nshould include specification of Service Level\nAgreements (SLAs) for centrally-provided services,\nincluding availability requirements.\n\nThe HSE should define a code of connection that\ndefines the minimum acceptable level of security\ncontrols necessary to connect into the NHN, to be\nagreed by all parties connected to the NHN, including\nrequirements for central reporting of cybersecurity\nalerts and incidents. The HSE should establish\na programme to monitor and enforce ongoing\ncompliance with this code of conduct. Compliance\nwith the code of connection should become part\nof the onboarding process of any connecting\norganisation (see key recommendation FA1.KR11 e\nin section 5.1).\n\n\n-----\n\n# 5\n\n\n### Focus areas - key findings and recommendations\n\n\n-----\n\n### Focus areas - key findings and recommendations\n\nAs outlined in section 2.3, our review focused on three connected but distinct areas. The detailed findings and\nrecommendations in this section are categorised by these focus areas, as follows:\n\n|Focus area 1|Col2|Focus area 2|Col4|Focus area 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Review the technical investigation and response||Review the organisation-wide preparedness and strategic response||Review the preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber risks|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.1 Focus area 1 - review of technical investigation and response\n\n|Focus area 1|Col2|Focus area 2|Col4|Focus area 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Review the technical investigation and response||Review the organisation-wide preparedness and strategic response||Review the preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber risks|\n|Summary of the Incident|||||\n|Key findings and recommendations|||||\n|Conclusion|||||\n\n\n###### Summary of the Incident\n\nThe HSE’s Incident Response provider’s\ninvestigation[83] determined the ransomware attack\noriginated from a malware infection on a workstation\n(“patient zero”) on 18 March 2021. Patient zero was\ninfected with malware after the workstation’s user\ninteracted with a malicious Microsoft Office Excel\ndocument that was attached to a phishing email\nreceived on 16 March 2021.\n\nThe user of patient zero was targeted with phishing\nemails with the same email subject on four other\noccasions between 14 December 2020 and 9\nFebruary 2021, but the workstation was not\nsuccessfully infected with malware. The HSE’s\nIncident Response provider attributed the phishing\nemails sent to patient zero to an Attacker[84] they refer\nto as UNC2633.[85] The investigation also identified\nadditional workstations that were infected with\nmalware (as a result of phishing emails sent by\nthe Attacker UNC2633), with the earliest identified\ninfection occurring on 24 November 2020. However,\nthere is no evidence to indicate these infections\ncontributed to the ransomware incident.\n\n\nAfter this Attacker gained unauthorised access to the\nHSE’s IT environment on 18 March 2021, a second\nAttacker continued to operate in the environment\nuntil the execution of ransomware on 14 May 2021.\nThe HSE’s Incident Response provider identified\nthat the Attacker compromised 180 systems and\nat least highly privileged accounts (typically\nrequired for performing administrative tasks (‘highly\nprivileged accounts’)) across eight organisations and\n19 domains. The Incident Response provider also\nidentified over 2,800 servers and 3,500 workstations\nacross 15 domains, with evidence of encryption.\nThis likely represents a lower bound on the number\nof systems encrypted, as some systems were\nrestored from backups or rebuilt prior to endpoint\nagent deployment, reducing the Incident Response\nprovider’s ability to determine if encryption had\noccurred.\n\nThe HSE’s Incident Response provider attributed\nthe second Attacker to be one that they refer to as\nUNC2727.[86] When investigating human-operated[87]\nransomware attacks it is common to identify evidence\nof two Attackers, one that specialises in gaining\naccess to organisations, and another that specialises\nin deploying ransomware and extortion. For the\npurpose of clarity, unless otherwise stated when this\nreport refers to ‘the Attacker’, these references will\nbe to the activity attributed to the second Attacker\n\n\n83 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n84 An individual or a group posing a threat.\n85 This is a threat actor that sends phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links to gain access to organisations’\nnetworks\n86 This is a financially motivated group that the HSE’s Incident Response provider has tracked since April 2021. This group is known\nto deploy Conti ransomware and / or exfiltrates victim data in support of their extortion efforts.\n87 Human-operated ransomware attacks are different to traditional ransomware attacks in that they are ‘hands-on-keyboard’ attacks.\nThis involves human attackers using knowledge of offensive techniques and weaknesses in enterprise IT systems, to methodically\ncompromise organisations’ networks, compromise systems, overcome defence and cause maximum impact. The ransomware\nattack that impacted HSE is an example of a human-operated ransomware attack.

Prior to this, none of the unauthorised\naccess, which began as early as 14 December\n2020, was actively identified or contained within the\nHSE environment. There were several detections of\nmalicious activity, but these did not result in a cyber\nsecurity incident or investigation being initiated.\n\nIt was reported by the HSE’s management that 80%\nof the IT environment across corporate IT services,\nhospitals, CHOs and EHRs was encrypted,[88] severely\ndisrupting healthcare services. The HSE’s Incident\nResponse provider identified encrypted files on 15\nAD domains across the HSE, Hospital C, Hospital K,\nHospital D, Hospital L, Hospital J and Hospital B.[89]\nThe HSE’s Incident Response provider’s investigation\nidentified information exposure events relating to\nemail, AD data and file data across the HSE, Hospital\nA, Hospital B, Hospital C and Hospital D.[90]\n\n\nOur review noted that the impact of the ransomware\nattack could have been more severe, for example:\n\n**•** if there had been intent by the Attacker to target\nspecific devices within the HSE environment (e.g.\nmedical devices);\n\n**•** if the ransomware took actions to destroy data at\nscale;\n\n**•** if the ransomware had auto-propagation and\npersistence capabilities, for example by using\nan exploit to propagate across domains and\ntrust-boundaries to medical devices (e.g. the\nEternalBlue exploit used by WannaCry and\nNotPetya[91]);\n\n**•** if cloud systems had also been encrypted such as\nthe COVID-19 vaccination system.[92]\n\nOur review also noted that the timeframe for\nrecovery could have been significantly longer had the\ndecryption key not been sourced, as the HSE would\nhave had to rely on recovering applications and\nsystems from backups at scale.\n\nFor more detail on the technical timeline, see\nAppendix E.\n\n\n**Figure 10: Focus area 1 summary of key findings and recommendations**\n\n|Thematic area|No. of key findings|No. of immediate key recommendations|No. of medium-term key recommendations|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nNote: Recommendations are categorised as immediate (starting immediately and completed within six months)\nand medium-term (with a phased plan for implementation to be developed and completed within 18 months).\n\n88 Percentage confirmed in interview by the CTO within OoCIO Infrastructure and Technology\n89 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n90 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n91 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A\n92 The COVID-19 vaccination system was designed to be cloud hosted and separate from the HSE IT environment to increase\nsecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Focus area 1 - key findings\n\n Preparedness to defend against and respond to a ransomware cyber attack\n\nThere was a lack of preparedness within the HSE to\ndefend against or respond to a ransomware cyber\nattack. Key findings that contributed to this position\ninclude:\n\n**1.** **FA1.KF1 The HSE did not have a single**\n**responsible owner for cybersecurity, at senior**\n**executive or management level at the time**\n**of the Incident. Limited scenario planning was**\nperformed to prepare for a ransomware incident\n(see focus area 2, area 12: scenario planning\nbelow for further detail). Nor were there clear\narticulations of the HSE’s risk to a large-scale\nransomware cyber attack that considered known\ncybersecurity weaknesses. These, alongside\nthe lack of a detailed cybersecurity strategy,\noperating model or transformation plan can likely\nbe attributed to this cybersecurity leadership\nabsence.\n\n**2.** **FA1.KF2 There was no dedicated committee**\n**that provided direction and oversight of**\n**cybersecurity and the activities required**\n**to reduce the HSE’s cyber risk exposure.**\nA cybersecurity forum[93] had previously been\nestablished within the OoCIO but subsequently\ndisbanded before August 2019[94] without\nreplacement. There was a process where risks\nwere raised to OoCIO management, but there\nwas no centralised decision making committee to\nprovide direction and decide on a suitable course\nof action to mitigate these risks, considering the\ncybersecurity capabilities and controls required.\n\n**3.** **FA1.KF3 There were known weaknesses and**\n**gaps in key cybersecurity controls. The Board**\npresentation on cybersecurity[95] presented on\n27 November 2020 highlighted there were many\nareas of known cybersecurity weaknesses,\nincluding known issues with excessive privileges\non accounts.\n\n\n**4.** **FA1.KF4 The lack of a cybersecurity forum**\n**in the HSE hindered the ability for granular**\n**cyber risks to be discussed and documented,**\n**and for mitigating controls to be identified**\n**and rapidly delivered. When gaps or issues**\nwith cybersecurity controls and capabilities were\nidentified, there was no cybersecurity forum for\nthese to be raised at by OoCIO staff[96] (see FA1.\nKF2). As a result, once cyber risks were identified,\naction was not always taken with sufficient\npriority. One interviewee reported that petitioning\nfor security tool or process changes was a “war\nof attrition”.\n\n**5.** **FA1.KF5 The HSE did not have a centralised**\n**cybersecurity function that managed**\n**cybersecurity risk and controls. There was**\nno centralised team to set the vision and\ntone for security and perform critical security\nfunctions, most notably security monitoring and\ncybersecurity control assurance activities. Further,\nit should be noted that at the time of the Incident\nthe senior cybersecurity SME, the Information\nSecurity Manager, was not performing their\nbusiness as usual role that included the NISTbased cybersecurity review of OES systems,\nbut was working on evaluating the security\ncontrols for the COVID-19 vaccination system.\nThis illustrates the lack of resources available for\nimportant cybersecurity activities.\n\n**6.** **FA1.KF6 It was a known issue that the teams**\n**that included elements of cybersecurity in their**\n**remit were under-resourced.[97] Further, within**\nthe three cybersecurity teams (which had a total\nFTE of 15[98]), team members predominantly had\nIT backgrounds, not expertise and experience\nin cybersecurity. These cybersecurity team\nsizes do not correlate with the 4,000 locations\n(1,200 networked), 130,000 staff,[99] over 70,000\ndevices and 54 hospitals[100] that make up the\nhealth service. The HSE was therefore overly\nreliant on its already stretched IT resources to\nperform cybersecurity activities in good faith,\nas evidenced by interview comments such as\n“security is not in my job description but I do it\npart time’’.\n\n\n93 HSE OoCIO Security Advisory Group (SAG) Terms of Reference, February 2018\n94 CLOSED - HSE Internal Audit Tracking_ICTA015OCIO0916_Internet Access Controls - Follow Up Audit, 28 August 2019\n95 Cyber Security Board Awareness Draft V7.2.pdf, November 2020\n96 Email with subject RE: FW: CI security solutions discussion document, UNDATED Reported as June 2020\n97 Minutes of HSE Board Meeting, 27 November 2020\n98 This comprises eight FTE within the Information Security Framework and Control team (two of which are students), the Security\nOperations team of five FTE and the Security, Standard and Policies team of two FTE.

The HSE has a complex**\ntechnological environment that includes a\nsignificant number of legacy systems, multiple onpremise email systems and multiple AD domains.\n\nThis included between\n30,000 and 40,000 Windows 7 workstations[101]\nthat were deemed end of life by the vendor and\noperating on extended support. Projects to\nmodernise, standardise and reduce complexity of\nthe IT estate were incomplete at the time of the\nIncident. This can likely be attributed to: delays\nreported in interviews as caused by the response\nto COVID-19; the under-resourcing of technology\nteams; the lack of a single governed programme\nthat maintained oversight, and the complexities of\nthe IT environment.\n\n**8.** **FA1.KF8 The HSE had a large and unclear**\n**security boundary that encompassed many**\n**of the organisations connected to the NHN.**\nThe ‘flat’ design of the NHN with a lack of\nnetwork segmentation, paired with bi-direction\ntrust relationships between many AD domains,\nresulted in many of the organisations connecting\nto the NHN effectively being within the HSE’s\nsecurity boundary. This exposed the HSE to the\nrisk of cyber attacks from other organisations\nconnected to the NHN, as well as these other\norganisations connected to the NHN to cyber\nattacks originating from the HSE.\n\n\n**9.** **FA1.KF9 The HSE’s effective security boundary**\n**did not align with its ability to mandate**\n**cybersecurity controls. The HSE created a**\nnetwork infrastructure where they did not have\nthe ability to mandate cyber controls to prevent\nand detect ransomware attacks within all\norganisations that fell within its security boundary\n(see key finding FA1.KF8).\n\n**10. FA1.KF10 There was no effective security**\n**monitoring capability that was able to detect,**\n**investigate and respond to security alerts**\n**across the HSE’s IT environment. The HSE did**\nnot have the modern security tooling needed to\ndetect and prevent ransomware, nor did it have\ntrained security analysts internally or within a\nSecurity Operations Center (“SOC”) that were\nable to monitor the available antivirus alerts to\ninvestigate, triangulate and respond to potential\nthreats.\n\n**11. FA1.KF11 The antivirus tool (** **Endpoint**\n**Security) was over-relied upon to detect and**\n**prevent threats on endpoints. Solely relying on**\nantivirus is not sufficient to protect against the\ntools and attack techniques used by ransomware\ngroups (and many other modern attackers).\nFurther it should be noted that this antivirus tool:\n\n**•** was not monitored 24/7;\n\n**•** was not deployed across the full endpoint\nenvironment;\n\n**•** was evidenced as not being correctly\nconfigured on all workstations;\n\n**•** was not configured to block malicious activity\nwithin the server estate, only to monitor it.\n\n\n101 Data provided from the antivirus management server (the server) of systems that last communicated with\nwithin the last 3 months, September 2021\nNational health network (NHN) describes the technology network for the delivery of Health services primarily to HSE staff and\nsecondarily to the staff in the voluntary sector\n\n\n-----\n\n**12. FA1.KF12 The IT environment had high-**\n**risk gaps relating to 25 out of 28 of the**\n**cybersecurity controls[102] that are most**\n**effective at detecting and preventing human-**\n**operated ransomware attacks.[103] A high-**\nlevel assessment of the HSE’s cybersecurity\ncapabilities, using PwC’s proprietary ransomware\nreadiness framework,[104] at the time of the\nIncident is shown in Figure 11. Further, of the\ncybersecurity controls implemented, limited\nassurance activities were performed to test their\noperational efficiency. This assessment has been\nperformed to provide an illustration of the level\nof cybersecurity controls in place at the time of\nthe incident specifically in relation to ransomware\nattacks.\n\nA Board presentation[105] on cybersecurity\npresented on 27 November 2020 highlighted how\nseveral of these controls were areas of known\ncybersecurity weakness, although the link to a\nrisk of widespread impact from a ransomware\nattack was not made. Implementing many of\nthese controls would have been highly likely to\nhave prevented or detected techniques used by\nthe Attacker and therefore significantly increased\nthe Attacker’s difficulty in compromising the HSE\nand achieving their objectives.\n\n**13. FA1.KF13 The HSE did not have a documented**\n**cyber incident response plan and had not**\n**performed typical preparatory activities**\n**such as exercising the technical response.**\nThe HSE did not have an exercised plan for\nmanaging and coordinating a cybersecurity\nincident that impacted the HSE as well as multiple\norganisations across the NHN. There were no\ndocumented cyber incident response runbooks\nor IT recovery plans (apart from documented AD\nrecovery plans) for recovering from a wide-scale\nransomware event.\n\n102 Based on PwC’s proprietary ransomware capability framework (see section Preparation: cybersecurity controls before the\nransomware attack for further detail), HSE is scored high or very high risk against 25 of the 28 capabilities\n103 Human-operated ransomware attacks are different to traditional ransomware attacks in that they are ‘hands-on-keyboard’ attacks.\nThis involves human attackers using knowledge of offensive techniques and weaknesses in enterprise IT systems, to methodically\ncompromise organisations’ networks, compromise systems, overcome defence and cause maximum impact. The ransomware\nattack that impacted HSE is an example of a human-operated ransomware attack. For further details see: https://www.pwc.com/\njg/en/publications/responding-to-growing-human-operated-ransomware-attacks-threat.pdf\n104 PwC’s proprietary ransomware readiness framework lists the most important cybersecurity controls we have identified to prevent,\ndetect and respond to human-operated ransomware attacks. Focus area 1 used this framework as it allowed the review to evaluate\nHSE’s cyber security controls at the time of the Incident against the specific threat of human-operated ransomware attacks.

The**\ninvestigation determined that the ransomware\nattack originated from a malware infection on\npatient zero on 18 March 2021, when the user\nopened a malicious Microsoft Office Excel\ndocument that was attached to a phishing email.\nFollowing this, the Attacker continued to operate\nin the environment, including compromising and\nabusing a significant number of highly privileged\n(e.g., system administrator) accounts and moving\nlaterally to both statutory and voluntary hospitals.\nMany of the tools and techniques employed\nby the Attacker during this time period (which\nincluded the use of basic and non-obfuscated\nmalicious PowerShell commands), were wellknown to be used by ransomware groups. As\nsuch, they would have almost certainly been\nidentified by modern security monitoring tooling\nand a security monitoring capability. It should\nbe noted that the HSE’s antivirus tool (\nEndpoint Security) did record detections of these\ntools[106] but these were not actively identified or\nthoroughly investigated by the HSE’s teams (see\nnext finding).\n\n\n**2.** **FA1.KF15 The HSE’s antivirus identified a**\n**tool commonly used by ransomware groups**\n**(Cobalt Strike) on six servers on 7 May 2021**\n**(and several more servers in the following**\n**days) but these alerts were not appropriately**\n**actioned. The HSE did not identify these alerts**\nuntil after their cybersecurity solutions provider\nflagged them on 12 May 2021[107] and 13 May\n2021.[108] At that point, the retained third party\n‘critical incident response service’, was not\ninvoked,[109] despite the alerts being for a tool\ncommonly used by ransomware groups (Cobalt\nStrike) and being across multiple servers. The\nresponse to these detections was not sufficient as\nthe HSE did not; invoke a cybersecurity incident;\nescalate the cybersecurity incident; identify the\nseverity of the threat; or thoroughly investigate\nand contain the threat. This was a result of\ninsufficient cybersecurity expertise to understand\nthe significance of these detections and an\nabsence of cyber response governance and\nprocesses to guide the response to cybersecurity\nincidents.\n\n**3.** **FA1.KF16 Two voluntary hospitals identified**\n**suspicious activity prior to the execution of**\n**ransomware, but a HSE centralised response**\n**was not initiated. On 10 May 2021, Hospital C**\nidentified activity on a domain controller (“DC”)\nthat they suspected as malicious and so sought\nadvice from Hospital C’s cybersecurity solutions\nprovider on whether the alerts warranted\nconcern.[110] The third-party stated that since\nthe threat has been handled by their antivirus\ntool that “the risk is low here”. As a result of the\nthird party’s email response, Hospital C did not\ninitiate a cyber incident response investigation,\nand therefore did not identify a cybersecurity\nincident. On the evening of 12 May 2021, Hospital\nA notified the OoCIO that its network had been\ncompromised[111] and suspected malicious activity\nwas originating from the HSE.[112,113] The HSE\nperformed an IT-centric investigation on 13 May\n2021 that incorrectly concluded that the HSE was\n“under threat from Hospital A, not the other way\naround”.[114] Following this, the HSE did not seek\nthe help of an external cyber incident response\nfirm nor the NCSC to investigate and provide\nguidance on how to respond to the detections.\n\n\n106 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n107 Email from the HSE’s cybersecurity solutions provider to the SecOps team with subject “Threat Not Handled”, 12 May 2021\n108 Email from the HSE’s cybersecurity solutions provider to the SecOps team with subject “Threat Not Handled”, 13 May 2021\n109 Appendix 7: Services Contract, Health Service Executive and the HSE’s cybersecurity solutions provider Information Systems\nLimited Agreement Relating to the Provision of Services pursuant to Request for Tenders for the Establishment of a Multi Supplier\nFramework for the provision of Security Software and Associated Reseller Services, 24 December 2017\n110 Logging call with Hospital C’s cybersecurity solutions provider on 10/05/2021 17:06, 10 May 2021\n111 Email with subject: Query, 12 May 2021 23:53\n112 Email with subject: FW: Recognise these addresses??, 12 May 2021 23:36\n113 Email with subject: FW: Query, 12 May 2021 23:53\n114 Email with subject: RE: Summary 13 May 2021 12:47\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HSE did not link these events to the antivirus\ntool detections that their cybersecurity solutions\nprovider had notified.\n\n**4.** **FA1.KF17 Two organisations successfully**\n**acted on detections of the Attacker preventing**\n**the deployment of ransomware within their**\n**estates. The DoH and Hospital A successfully**\nacted on alerts and detections of suspicious\nactivity, and engaged third-party incident\nresponse services. The DoH quickly deployed\nEDR security tooling[115] that was then able to\nprevent the ransomware from executing on the\nmajority of its infrastructure, including critical and\ndata servers. Hospital A engaged the Hospital\nA’s Incident Response provider, who worked\nwith them to use their already deployed security\ntool. Had the HSE responded in a similar fashion\n(particularly following the escalations made by\nHospital A and the HSE’s cybersecurity solutions\nprovider) then it is likely that the widespread\nencryption of the HSE environment would have\nbeen prevented.\n\nKey findings relating to the response to the\ndetonation phase of the ransomware attack include:\n\n**1.** **FA1.KF18 The HSE with the help of third-**\n**parties mobilised a response to the**\n**ransomware attack and overcame many of**\n**the significant challenges the ransomware**\n**attack presented, drawing on their experience**\n**responding to crises, including COVID-19. The**\nHSE recognised the need for additional resources\nand specialist skills and engaged third parties\nfor incident response[116,117] legal and forensics\nsupport early on. The impact of the Incident\non a national scale encouraged goodwill from\nthird party support and vendors, including the\nprovision of pro bono work. This allowed a good\ncadence to be established within 24-48 hours\nthat included multiple daily standups, Major\nIncident (MI) meetings and other programme\ngovernance. The HSE developed effective\nresponse structures and processes that evolved\nover the course of the response. The decision to\nset up a physical hub for operations in Citywest\n(on 21 May 2021[118]) was widely reported as being\ninvaluable to working collaboratively between\ndifferent response and recovery teams, whilst also\nboosting morale.\n\n\n**2.** **FA1.KF19 The HSE was reliant on third-parties**\n**in the early weeks of the Incident to provide**\n**structure to the response activities. The first**\nphysical hub for senior management was set\nup 15 May 2021[119] in a third party organisation,\nbefore moving to accommodation at Citywest\non 21 May 2021.[120] The Defence Forces were\nbrought in 18 May 2021 and were widely reported\nin interviews to have provided key response\nstructures.\n\n**3.** **FA1.KF20 Time was lost during the response**\n**due to a lack of pre-planning for high impact**\n**technology events. The HSE was not prepared**\nto respond to a cyber incident of this scale\n(“everything going offline”) due to the lack of\ndefined and exercised response processes and\nplans. Key examples of this include:\n\n**•** No cybersecurity response plans and\nplaybooks;\n\n**•** No security tooling capable of investigating\nand remediating security alerts;\n\n**•** No centralised list of contact details for all\nHSE staff or asset register;\n\n**•** No offline copies of key IT and security\ndocumentation were kept, for example\nnetwork diagrams;\n\n**•** No pre-established prioritised list of\napplications and systems for recovery, based\non clinical services, that was cognisant of\ncross-technology dependencies;\n\n**•** No pre-agreed, setup and tested out-of-band\ncommunication system that would enable\nusers to communicate in the event of a\ncybersecurity incident. Multiple collaboration\nand communication platforms were used\nafter the Incident resulting in confusion and\nteam members not being able to easily\ncommunicate; increasing the day-to-day\ndifficulty of responders.\n\n\n115 Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)\n116 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n117 Minutes of Cyber Attack MI Meeting 10 am - 14052021, 14 May 2021\n118 Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance and Admin V1.10, 31 May 2021\n119 Programme RAID Log, 2021\n120 Programme RAID Log, 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.** **FA1.KF21 The HSE spent a significant**\n**amount of time during the response**\n**gathering information about applications,**\n**as this information was not recorded and**\n**up-to-date in a central or offline application**\n**register. The lack of centralised information**\nabout applications caused inefficiencies in the\nresponse as the HSE did not have up-to-date\ninformation on applications. This meant that as\npart of their response, they had to develop a\nlist of applications that were in use within the\ncorporate, acute and community spaces. As well\nas identify and define missing details such as\nthe application’s owner, its priority for recovery,\ndetails of the systems they were hosted on and in\nsome cases the application’s purpose. For some\napplications, the HSE was reliant on vendors to\npull this information together, and provide the\ninformation critical to the application’s recovery.\n\n**5.** **FA1.KF22 There was a heavy reliance on**\n**specific individuals during the response. This**\n**likely contributed to a recovery timeline that**\n**was longer than could have been achieved.**\nThere was a heavy reliance on key members\nof staff in IT teams that effectively caused\nbottlenecks. This was due to the large scope\nof their BAU IT roles and responsibilities, the\nlack of IT resourcing and a lack of documented\nand standardised information and procedures.\nThis concentration of knowledge prevented\nopportunities for further delegation (such as\nacquiring more burst capacity from third parties)\nand meant that the HSE had limited response\nresilience if these individuals had become\nunavailable during the critical weeks of the\nresponse.\n\n**6.** **FA1.KF23 The response initially prioritised**\n**the recovery of foundational systems,**\n**and applications on the OES list[121], before**\n**advancing to an approach that focused on**\n**clinical risks and the recovery of end-to-end**\n**clinical services. Before the incident there**\nwas not a complete and documented list that\nprioritised all HSE applications and systems. As\na result IT teams initially focused on restoring\nthe seven priority clinical applications that were\nidentified in the OES list.[122] The recovery strategy\nadvanced from the restoration of these seven\napplications, to be centered around recovery\nof end-to-end clinical service (including the\ndependencies of applications to restore end-to\n\nend clinical services) following the co-location of\nall responders to Citywest on 21 May 2021.[123]\n\n**7.** **FA1.KF24 There was a lack of clearly defined**\n**and delineated decision making authority**\n**between the HSE, hospitals and CHOs in the**\n**case of a health service-wide crisis. After the**\nransomware attack was identified, the OoCIO\ngave a central mandate to power down systems\nand wait for instructions (whilst they assessed\nthe impact and established next steps) as there\nwas not a delineated decision making structure\nto allow for local nuances. At least one hospital\n(Hospital B) used a third party to review their\nenvironment and confirm that it was unaffected by\nthe ransomware. Invoking local decision making\nduring this initial interim period allowed the\nhospital to regain IT systems and provide critical\nradiotherapy services within the first week of the\nIncident.\n\n**8.** **FA1.KF25 The OoCIO was not able to provide**\n**or source (through third party burst capacity)**\n**the scale of the IT support required by**\n**hospitals and CHOs during the extended**\n**response to restore applications, systems**\n**and services at pace. The centralised IT team**\nstructure of the HSE meant that little IT subject\nmatter expertise was available locally within the\nHSE’s hospitals and CHOs. It was widely reported\nby hospitals and CHOs[124] that they were heavily\nreliant on the central OoCIO IT resources for\nresponse activities and on personal relationships\nwith OoCIO IT teams to progress and unblock\ntasks. The OoCIO IT resources were however,\nalready stretched performing national ransomware\nattack response activities and therefore struggled\nto effectively prioritise this help.\n\n**9.** **FA1.KF26 The HSE had limited to no ability to**\n**investigate the attack using its own tooling.**\nThe HSE was not centrally collecting and retaining\nlogging from systems, network and security\ntooling. The central collation point for their\nantivirus alerts (the antivirus management server)\nwas encrypted and deemed unrecoverable as a\nresult of the ransomware attack. The encryption\nof the antivirus server meant that the HSE was\nunable to determine the circumstances and audit\ntrail surrounding what detections were reported\nback to the central console in the lead up to the\nransomware execution. Therefore, without the\ndeployment of their Incident Response provider’s\n\n\n121 The Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS-D) 2016/1148 was signed into Irish law on 18 September 2018. It involves the\napplication of security obligations on operators of essential services (OES).

FA1.KF27 The HSE’s Incident Response**\n**provider identified evidence of how the**\n**Attacker was able to gain unauthorised access**\n**to the HSE’s IT environment and the Attacker’s**\n**subsequent activities. The HSE worked closely**\nwith their Incident Response provider to ensure\nthey had the available information required to\nenable an effective investigation and response.\nThis resulted in an investigation that identified\nevidence of how the Attacker was able to gain\nunauthorised access to the HSE’s IT environment\nand what the Attacker did once they were able to\ngain this access.\n\nKey findings from the investigation[125] included that\nthe Attacker:\n\n**•** gained unauthorised access to the HSE network\nthrough a phishing email on 18 March 2021 (this\nactivity was attributed to the Attacker the HSE’s\nIncident Response provider refer to as UNC2633);\n\n**•** used a number of tools commonly utilised by\nhuman-operated ransomware groups to perform\nreconnaissance and move laterally through the\nHSE’s environment (compromising 180 systems);\n\n**•** used the network connectivity provided by the\nNHN as well as the bidirectional trust between\nseveral AD domains to easily move laterally\nacross to six voluntary hospitals and one statutory\nhospital;\n\n**•** used an exploit that was widely publicised as a\ncritical patch[126] to gain access to the networks of\ntwo hospitals;\n\n**•** compromised at least highly privileged\naccounts[127] across HSE, Hospital A, Hospital K,\nHospital L, Hospital J and Hospital B;[128]\n\n**•** browsed local or remote folders on systems\nacross HSE and four organisations;\n\n\n\n**•** opened files and attempted to view them using\nRDP;[129]\n\n**•** made copies of files;\n\n**•** created archives (.zip and .rar) of files;\n\n**•** accessed the file sharing website Domain A; and,\n\n**•** deployed ransomware throughout several\norganisations connected to the NHN.\n\nAdditionally, the malware (which\nincludes an Outlook module to harvest contact\ninformation and email content from infected hosts)\nwas identified on several hosts within the HSE’s\nenvironment. An output from the execution of this\nmodule was identified on one system within the\nHSE’s domain.\n\nThe investigation was unable to identify conclusive\nevidence that data exposed to the Attacker was\nthen successfully exfiltrated by the Attacker out of\nthe HSE’s environment (for example to a file sharing\nwebsite). However, it is known that the Attacker\nprovided samples of the HSE’s and Hospital D’s\n(a Section 38 hospital and therefore independent\ndata controller[130]) data in a chat room (accessed via\na link in the ransom note) and that some data was\npublished on the dark web.[131] It is also known that\nthe Financial Times published redacted extracts of\nthe published data (which was verified as originating\nfrom the attack on 14 May 2021)[132] and then worked\nto provide a copy of this data to the HSE’s Incident\nResponse provider on 25 May 2021.[133]\n\nHospital D conducted its own review of the data\nprovided by the Financial Times and made a decision\nto notify identified data subjects as per Article 34\nGDPR.[134] The HSE reviewed the data provided by\nthe Financial Times and confirmed that the HSE\ndata related to a Statutory Hospital (“Hospital M”),\nfor which the HSE is the data controller. The HSE\nassessed the personal data risk to the rights and\nfreedoms of individuals within this data set to be\nlow[135] and therefore it was deemed not necessary to\ninform the relevant data subjects.\n\n\n125 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n126 The threat actor used the exploit to gain access to the networks of Hospital A and Hospital B. The\nexploit was widely publicised and given a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS which is a framework for communicating\nthe characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities) score of 10/10.\n127 The compromised accounts consist of two ‘enterprise admins’, 26 ‘domain admins’, two ‘administrator’, one ‘admin’ and two\n‘service desk admin’.\n128 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n129 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides a user a graphical interface to connect to a remote computer over a network connection.\n130 Response to questions raised by the Data Protection Commission to HSE DPO on June 2021, July 2021\n131 Privileged and Confidential Terms of Reference Legal and Data Steering Group V004, June 2021\n132 Privileged and Confidential Terms of Reference Legal and Data Steering Group V004, June 2021\n133 Draft OoCIO Cyber Governance Report v0.2, UNDATED\n134 Response to questions raised by the Data Protection Commission to HSE DPO on June 2021, July 2021\n135 Response to questions raised by the Data Protection Commission to HSE DPO on June 2021, July 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HSE retained a third party to conduct additional\nin-depth forensic analysis on the systems identified\nby their Incident Response provider (where data\nwas exposed to the threat actor), to determine the\nprobability of data exfiltration from these systems\nand to identify any other potential data exposure and\nexfiltration sources. The HSE has also retained two\nthird party services to perform ongoing dark web and\nweb monitoring activities.\n\nAt the time of this report, the work aligned to the\nHSE’s Legal and Data workstream established on\n19 May 2021[136] is ongoing. As of yet, therefore the\nHSE has not made any data subject notifications but\ncontinues to work closely with the DPC.\n\n###### The impact of and recovery from the ransomware cyber attack\n\nDue to the scale and impact of the ransomware,\npaired with the complex and legacy IT environment,\nthe technical recovery of IT systems has been\nchallenging. Key findings on the technical impact of\nthe Incident include:\n\n**1.** **FA1.KF28 The impact of the ransomware on**\n**the IT environment was reported by the HSE’s**\n**management to lead to 80%[137] encryption. The**\nHSE’s Incident Response provider’s investigation\nidentified encrypted files on systems within the\nHSE and the following voluntary and statutory\nhospitals: Hospital C; Hospital K; Hospital D;\nHospital L; Hospital J and Hospital B.[138] The\nHSE was the most impacted by the ransomware\nattack, with all nine of its domains displaying\nevidence of encryption.[139] In total, the HSE’s\nIncident Response provider identified over\n2,800 servers and 3,500 workstations across 15\ndomains, with evidence of encryption.[140] This\nlikely represents a lower bound on the number\nof systems encrypted, as some systems were\nrestored from backups or rebuilt prior to endpoint\nagent deployment, reducing the HSE’s Incident\nResponse provider’s ability to determine if\nencryption had occurred.\n\n\n**2.** **FA1.KF29 The impact of the ransomware**\n**attack on communications was severe, as the**\n**HSE almost exclusively used on-premise email**\n**systems (Exchange and** **) that**\n**were encrypted, and therefore unavailable,**\n**during the attack. The HSE had begun to**\nmigrate users to Exchange Online\nbut this was limited to pilot projects at the time\nof the Incident and had been identified by the\nHSE as a complex project to deliver. Had the\nHSE invested in reducing email complexity and\ncompleted migrating staff to Exchange Online, the\nimpact of the ransomware on email would have\nlikely been minimal, reducing the impact to team\ncollaboration. See key finding FA1.KF38 for the\ndetail regarding email recovery.\n\nKey findings on the recovery include:\n\n**3.** **FA1.KF30 The HSE took action to contain**\n**the ransomware attack by powering down**\n**systems and disconnecting the NHN from the**\n**internet. These containment steps restricted the**\nability of the Attacker to further their activities and\nin the face of spreading ransomware within an\narchitecturally open environment were the most\npragmatic. The HSE did not have the realistic\noption of carrying out a more compartmentalised\napproach that accounted for the impact on\norganisations, due to the open design of the\nNHN, the immaturity of cybersecurity controls and\ngovernance, and as this had not been planned for\nor rehearsed.\n\n**4.** **FA1.KF31 It is unclear how much data would**\n**have been lost if a decryption key had not**\n**become available. It was reported that online**\nbackups were encrypted in places and that\nsecondary backups to tape were only made\nperiodically. Therefore it is highly likely that\nsegments of data would have been unrecoverable\nfrom backups, and a full recovery of data was\nonly possible due to the provision of a decryption\nkey by the Attacker.\n\n**5.** **FA1.KF32 Without the decryption key, it is**\n**unknown how long it would have taken to**\n**recover systems from backups but it would**\n**have likely taken considerably longer. Prior**\nto receiving the decryption key, the HSE was\nrecovering systems from backups. This would\nhave required a significant amount of IT resources\nand equipment to be undertaken at the scale\nrequired to recover all servers and applications.\n\n\n136 Privileged and Confidential Terms of Reference Legal and Data Steering Group V004, June 2021\n137 Percentage confirmed in interview by the CTO within OoCIO Infrastructure and Technology\n138 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n139 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n140 HSE’s Incident Response provider Intrusion Investigation Report, September 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**6.** **FA1.KF33 The HSE missed opportunities for**\n**efficiencies in the recovery of systems and**\n**applications due to a lack of preparedness.**\nThe lack of preparedness for a widespread\ndisruptive IT event often created bottlenecks and\nprevented teams from being able to get to work\non the highest priority tasks. In particular, the\nlack of a comprehensive, current asset register\nmapped to critical services delayed recovery\nefforts due to the wait between teams as this\ninformation was gathered and through unknown\ndependencies creating inefficiencies.\n\n**7.** **FA1.KF34 The processes and response**\n**structures for recovering systems and**\n**applications were designed and developed in**\n**response to the Incident. Many of the processes**\nused to recover systems and applications were\ndeveloped during the crisis. This resulted in a\nlack of immediate awareness, understanding and\nimplementation of agreed processes from staff\nmembers potentially increasing the HSE’s cyber\nrisk at the time of the response. For example,\nthere was at least one instance of a potentially\ncompromised system being reconnected to the\nnetwork (before it was confirmed as clean and\npre-authorised by the HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider and the Tech Team[141]), inadvertently\nexposing the HSE to a heightened level of risk.\n\n**8.** **FA1.KF35 The HSE’s Incident Response**\n**provider and the HSE, developed go-to-**\n**green processes[142,143,144] to ensure the secure**\n**recovery of systems and reduce the risk of**\n**further ransomware attacks. The HSE’s Incident**\nResponse provider and the HSE developed\nrequirements that every system within the HSE,\nvoluntaries and CHOs must meet before being\nable to rejoin the network, and for organisations\nto be reconnected back to the NHN and the\ninternet.\n\n\n**9.** **FA1.KF36 The complexities of recovering**\n**applications and systems were not well**\n**understood. Due to the unknown dependencies**\nbetween systems and a lack of recovery process\npre-planning, recovery efforts were complicated.\nFor example, recovery teams reported that it was\ndifficult to facilitate vendor support. As a result,\nworkarounds (such as using screen shares to\nprovide vendors with temporary access) had\nto be employed. These workarounds were also\nin some cases further complicated through the\ninconsistency in access to collaboration tools\n(see response to the detonation phase of the\nransomware attack key findings FA1.KF18 - FA1.\nKF27).\n\n**10. FA1.KF37 Despite the challenges presented**\n**by the ransomware attack and the lack of**\n**preparedness, the HSE was able to recover**\n**1,075 applications and over 87,000 systems.[145]**\nOur review consistently noted the willingness\nof HSE staff members across the organisation\nto come together and contribute wherever\nneeded to deliver services to patients. The\nHSE recovered their primary identity systems (\n\nAD domain) within a matter of days\nafter the ransomware attack. The HSE was able\nto prioritise and restore applications and systems\nduring the response including:\n\n**•** After one month, the HSE was able to decrypt\n47% of servers and fully restore 48% of Acute\napplications, 40% of Community Services\napplications and 64% of business services\napplications.[146]\n\n**•** After two months, the HSE was able to\ndecrypt 94% of servers and fully restore 85%\nof Acute applications, 94% of Community\nServices applications and 79% of business\nservices applications.[147]\n\n**•** After three months, the HSE reported that\n100% of servers were decrypted and they\nwere able to fully restore 95% of Acute\napplications, 98% of Community Services\napplications and 91% of business services\napplications.[148]\n\n\n141 Minutes of Cyber Attack MI Meeting 11 am - 19052021, 19 May 2021\n142 Voluntaries and Go-to-Green, 26 May 2021\n143 CTO Document Device Go Green Draft Approach, 23 May 2021\n144 CTO Document Remote Access Go Green Draft Approach, 24 May 2021\n145 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n146 SITCEN SITUATION REPORT, 18:30 14 June 2021\n147 Weekly Brief, 20 July 2021\n148 Weekly Brief, 21 September 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**11. FA1.KF38 HSE had significant issues with**\n**restoring email back to normal operations**\n**for users, resulting in ongoing disruption to**\n**employees. Due to the complexity of the email**\ninfrastructure, even when the service was itself\nrestored, user level disruptions such as empty\nmail boxes continued to affect staff’s ability to\nperform recovery and BAU activities. Ongoing\ndisruption with email services impacted the staff’s\nability to recover applications and systems. Since\nthe ransomware attack, there has been over\n38,000 tickets raised with the national service\ndesk relating to ongoing issues with email.[149] Over\n20,000 of those tickets were raised between 20\nJuly 2021[150] and 21 September 2021.[151]\n\n**12. FA1.KF39 The strategy to prioritise national**\n**systems recovery over local systems meant**\n**that statutory hospitals and CHOs that were**\n**not yet using ‘standard’ infrastructure (some**\n**with limited local IT resources) experienced**\n**recovery delays. Organisations not yet**\nusing ‘standard’ infrastructure (for example,\norganisations not using national applications)\nwere effectively deprioritised by the strategy to\nprioritise national systems. This was then further\ncompounded for hospitals and CHOs with little\nto no IT resource and who were therefore wholly\nreliant on the OoCIO for their recovery.\n\n###### Sustainable reduction of risk since the ransomware attack\n\nThe focus of the HSE’s activities since the attack has\nbeen on implementing recommendations provided\nby third parties and to continue to recover systems.\nLimited evidence has been provided to show that\nactivity has yet to take place to ensure that the HSE’s\ncyber risk exposure is reduced sustainably.\n\nKey findings on the improvements made by the HSE\npost cyber incident, and on HSE’s current approach\nand current ability to sustainably reduce cyber risk,\ninclude:\n\n\n**1.** **FA1.KF40 The HSE engaged their Incident**\n**Response provider to continue providing a**\n**managed detection and response service to**\n**March 2022. This capability is the most crucial**\ndefence the HSE has against further ransomware\nattacks at present, and provides a valuable ‘safety\nnet’ given the inherent weaknesses in cyber\nsecurity controls across the estate. The HSE has\nnot yet identified a long-term replacement for the\nmanaged detection and response service, with\nthe current solution ending in March 2022.[152]\n\n**2.** **FA1.KF41 The HSE increased the scope of**\n**services provided by the current third parties**\n**to provide 24x7 monitoring capability of its**\n**antivirus tool[153] and cloud environment.[154]**\nThe HSE’s cybersecurity solutions provider\nand Third Party B provide a 24x7 security\nmonitoring service limited to the antivirus tool (\n\nEndpoint Security) and Microsoft Cloud\nplatforms[155] (which includes the HSE\ntenancy[156]) respectively.\n\n**3.** **FA1.KF42 Improvements to the HSE’s in-house**\n**Security Operations capability (for example**\n**defining processes and documenting response**\n**roles) have not yet been implemented. These**\nimprovements along with other immediate\nimprovements identified are critically important\nto ensure that alerts of malicious activity will be\ninvestigated and escalated with due care. As of\nyet there is little evidence to show that any ‘quick\nfixes’ to the HSE’s security monitoring capability\nhave been implemented beyond the retaining of\nthird party monitoring services.\n\n\n149 21 September 2021 Weekly Brief, 2021\n150 20 July 2021 Weekly Brief, 2021\n151 21 September 2021 Weekly Brief, 2021\n152 https://irl.eu-supply.com/ctm/Supplier/PublicTenders/ViewNotice/248668\n153 Service Contract Agreement – Addendum 1 Managed Security Monitoring & Incident Response Service 24-Hours / 365 Days,\nPrepared 21 June 2021 (Unsigned)\n154 Response to questions raised by the Data Protection Commission to HSE DPO on June 2021, July 2021\n155 Response to questions raised by the Data Protection Commission to HSE DPO on June 2021, July 2021\n156 Confirmed by the General Manager Head of Technology, Infrastructure & Deployment within OoCIO Infrastructure and Technology\nby email, 8 October 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.** **FA1.KF43 The HSE was not empowered to**\n**mandate that voluntary hospitals continue**\n**with the improved levels of security monitoring**\n**(or other security controls); this could expose**\n**the health service to the risk of further cyber**\n**attacks. The HSE does not have the authority to**\nmandate voluntary hospitals continue to use the\nHSE’s Incident Response provider’s Managed\nDefence monitoring agent or replace this with\na like-for-like replacement (which will require\nongoing cybersecurity expenditure). If voluntary\nhospitals do not maintain the current capability\nor procure a similar, market leading solution, then\nthis will expose the HSE and wider health service\nto risk of further cyber attacks. This illustrates\nhow the HSE’s security boundary continues\nto be misaligned with their ability to mandate\ncybersecurity controls.\n\n**5.** **FA1.KF44 A finalised security improvement**\n**plan[157,158,159,160] does not exist and the**\n**draft security improvement plan and**\n**programme[161,162,163,164] is unlikely to significantly**\n**reduce the risk of future ransomware attacks.**\nThe current draft plan and programme is a\nconsolidation of IT projects and identified gaps. It\nalso highlights the need to create a final security\nimprovement plan with defined governance and\naccountability across the organisation. Therefore\nat present no improvement plan exists that is\nstructured or architected using a cyber threat\nview that centres on improvements around key\ncybersecurity capability areas that are most\neffective at detecting and preventing humanoperated ransomware attacks. It does identify\nsome gaps in these capability areas as items\nto be addressed in long-term planning[165] but it\nshould be noted that improvement in these gaps\nare crucial to reducing the risk of ransomware\nattacks in the short term.\n\n\n**6.** **FA1.KF45 A holistic view of cybersecurity**\n**improvement activities does not yet exist**\n**which increases the risk that foundational**\n**improvement activities will be missed. There**\nis a risk that the HSE’s current approach to focus\naction around the remediation activities outlined\nby their Incident Response provider, will likely\nlead to a piecemeal approach that does not\ntake account of the fundamental root causes of\nsuch issues. For example, at present it is well\nknown that there are issues with the coordination\nand tracking of the response to security alerts\nbetween technology teams, but the resolution of\nthis is not yet included within any finalised plans.\n\n**7.** **FA1.KF46 There is no centralised governance**\n**programme that maintains oversight of**\n**identified cybersecurity improvements,**\n**resulting in a lack of clarity about what has**\n**been delivered and what remains to be**\n**done. Improvement actions are currently being**\ndiscussed at technological operational meetings\nand a programme management governance\nstructure to oversee these activities and produce\ncentralised progress figures against agreed\nmilestones is yet to be developed. This has\nresulted in a lack of clarity around what security\nimprovements have been delivered, and what\nsecurity improvements still need to be delivered in\nresponse to the Incident.\n\n**8.** **FA1.KF47 A cybersecurity transformation**\n**programme, that will sustainably reduce**\n**cybersecurity risk in the long term, has not**\n**been planned, approved or resourced. Some**\ninitial security improvement documents[166,167,168,169],\nas outlined in key finding FA1.KF44, exist\nbut these do not articulate the scale of\nnecessary change or detail the plan for such\na transformation. Both a cyber transformation\nplan and a framework to help achieve that plan\nare required that will redesign how the HSE\nmanages and maintains its cyber risk within its\nextensive technological estate (see medium-term\nrecommendation FA1.KR13 for further detail).\n\n\n157 HSE IT Security Planning, UNDATED Last Modification recorded 15 September 2021\n158 Cyber Security Risk Management, UNDATED Last Modification recorded 15 September 2021\n159 CTO Document Security Improvement Programme Draft, 31 August 2021\n160 OoCIO-07 Investment Plan 2020 -Cyber Security Draft, 1 June 2019\n161 HSE IT Security Planning, UNDATED Last Modification recorded 15 September 2021\n162 Cyber Security Risk Management, UNDATED Last Modification recorded 15 September 2021\n163 CTO Document Security Improvement Programme Draft, 31 August 2021\n164 OoCIO-07 Investment Plan 2020 -Cyber Security Draft, 1 June 2019\n165 CTO Document Security Monitoring V1 HSE, 04 June 2021\n166 HSE IT Security Planning, UNDATED Last Modification recorded 15 September 2021\n167 Cyber Security Risk Management, UNDATED Last Modification recorded 15 September 2021\n168 CTO Document Security Improvement Programme Draft, 31 August 2021\n169 OoCIO-07 Investment Plan 2020 -Cyber Security Draft, 1 June 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n**9.** **FA1.KF48 The HSE still has a significant**\n**amount of legacy IT that needs to be**\n**modernised.**\n\n**10. FA1.KF49 Key artefacts created within the**\n**response are not yet being centrally and**\n**systematically collated. The HSE was able to**\ngather a significant amount of information in the\nmiddle of a crisis about the applications that were\nbeing used across the HSE, hospitals and CHOs.\nIn addition, design response processes were\ncreated such as communication structures and\nrecovery tracking dashboards (for example the\ndecryption tracking trello board). These artefacts\nwill be invaluable in the event of a similar attack\nin future. It is therefore critical that information is\nnow collated and appropriately managed going\nforward.\n\n###### Focus area 1 - Key recommendations\n\nKey recommendations are outlined below. These\nhave been split between those that are for immediate\nconsideration and those that should follow in the\nmedium-term (as they require further planning and\npreparation). The HSE should begin planning for\nthe delivery of medium term recommendations\nimmediately, in parallel to implementing the\nimmediate recommendations, and start the\nimplementation phase of these medium-term\nrecommendations within six months:\n\n###### Immediate recommendation 1\n\n**1.** **FA1.KR1 Appoint an interim senior leader for**\n**cybersecurity (a CISO) who has experience**\n**rapidly reducing organisations’ vulnerability**\n**to threats and designing cyber security**\n**transformation programmes (see tactical**\n**_recommendation 1.4 in Section 4.2)._** The\nHSE should appoint an interim senior leader\nfor cybersecurity to be responsible for placing\ngovernance around cybersecurity improvements,\nidentifying a sustainable medium-term managed\ndetection and response solution (see immediate\nrecommendation FA1.KR6), identifying future\nstrategy for detection and response and\nleading the implementation of the immediate\nrecommendations from this review. This role\n\n170 DRR Q2 2021, 19 November 2020\n\n\nshould also be responsible for planning and\nmobilising teams to deliver a cybersecurity\ntransformation required to sustainably reduce\nthe HSE’s risk to ransomware attacks. The\nCISO should be at National Director level, a\ndirect report to the CTTO, and have appropriate\naccess to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure\nthat cybersecurity risks are understood and\nconsidered in all decision-making. This interim\nsenior leader should be given the ability to source\nthe necessary expertise from the market to build\na team that can give effect to the immediate\nrecommendations listed in this section, and to\nbegin planning for the implementation of mediumterm recommendations. The prioritisation for the\napproval of a CISO and a cyber security team\nhas been recorded within the Q2 Divisional Risk\nRegister as an ‘action control’ to Risk ID 130 with\na due date of 30 June 2022.[170]\n\n**2.** **FA1.KR2 Establish an executive-level**\n**cybersecurity oversight committee, to drive**\n**continuous assessment of cybersecurity risk**\n**across the provision of health services (see**\n**_strategic recommendation 1.2 in Section 4.1)._**\nA dedicated executive oversight committee is\nneeded to provide direction and oversight to\ncybersecurity, both within the HSE and across\nother parties connected to the NHN.\n\n**3.** **FA1.KR3 Create a Board committee, to**\n**oversee the transformation of IT and**\n**cybersecurity to deliver a future-fit, resilient**\n**technology base for provision of digitally-**\n**enabled health services (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 1.4 in Section 4.1). The HSE_**\nshould consider the inclusion of further specialist\nnon-executive members of the committee in order\nto provide additional expertise and insight to the\ncommittee.\n\n**4.** **FA1.KR4 Plan a multi-year cybersecurity**\n**transformation programme, and identify**\n**and mobilise the resources to deliver (see**\n**_strategic recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1)._**\nIn parallel to delivering the tactical cybersecurity\nimprovement programme, the HSE’s appointed\ninterim CISO should plan a cybersecurity\ntransformation that will build lasting cybersecurity\ncapabilities and sustainably reduce cyber risk\nexposure. This cybersecurity transformation\nprogramme should be validated at the Board\nlevel. The HSE should also identify suitable\nresources and expertise to plan and deliver this\ntransformation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**5.** **FA1.KR5 Appoint a programme lead and**\n**define the governance framework for the**\n**cybersecurity transformation programme**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 3.1 in Section_**\n**_4.1). A programme lead with experience in_**\ncybersecurity transformation should be appointed\nby the HSE’s interim CISO to drive the execution\nof this transformation. It is critical that this\nprogramme lead can work hand in glove with the\nHSE’s technologies teams, to help orchestrate\nsecure technological transformation.\n\n**6.** **FA1.KR6 Continue to use a managed detection**\n**and response service provided by a third**\n**party and identify a sustainable medium-term**\n**solution (see tactical recommendation 2.1 in**\n**_Section 4.2). The current service provided by the_**\nHSE’s Incident Response provider is the most\ncrucial defence the HSE currently has against\nfurther ransomware attacks. If the HSE decides to\nonboard a new managed detection and response\nservice, it should ensure there is an overlap\nbetween this and the HSE’s Incident Response\nprovider’s current service, so that there are no\nperiods when the IT environment is not monitored.\n\n**7.** **FA1.KR7 Mobilise a tactical cybersecurity**\n**improvement programme[171] (while the**\n**cybersecurity transformation programme is**\n**being planned), with governance that feeds**\n**into the interim CISO and can provide updates**\n**on the programme’s progress into the Board**\n**committee (see tactical recommendation 1.5**\n**_in Section 4.2). Dedicated cybersecurity and_**\ntechnology resources should be used to deliver a\ntactical cybersecurity improvement programme,\nconsisting of tactical work packages that can\nbe delivered at pace using focused governance\nand reporting to drive accountability. To create\nthese work packages, the HSE should action the\nfollowing activities:\n\n**•** **Triage - All third party recommendations and fixes**\nto the security control gaps identified internally\nshould be triaged into tactical or strategic\nactivities. Tactical activities should be those that\nwill rapidly reduce the risk of ransomware attacks\nand are achievable in 60 days or less. Note that\nwhere improvements are identified as strategic,\nthe HSE should consider what additional tactical\nimprovements can be implemented in the shortterm to reduce risk and act as mitigating controls.\n\n**•** **Test and Assess - As well as the**\nrecommendations it has received from\n\n\nthird parties, the HSE should also include\nrecommendations by performing:\n\n– AD security assessments;\n\n– Vulnerability scanning of all internet-facing IP\naddresses;\n\n– Vulnerability scanning of all internal IP address\nranges;\n\n– A comprehensive assessment of current\ncapabilities and planned improvements\nagainst a framework that identifies key\ncapabilities to defend against humanoperated ransomware attacks (such as the\nproprietary ransomware readiness framework\nused in this report or that recently published\nby CISA[172]).\n\n**•** **Architect - Following the triaging activity, the**\nHSE should use cybersecurity experts to architect\nand manage a series of tactical work packages\nto deliver the tactical improvements identified by\nthe triage process. These should be designed\nto deliver directly and rapidly reduce the risk of\nransomware attacks, and be achievable in 60\ndays or less. Examples of tactical work packages\ninclude:\n\n– Uplift detection and response capability;\n\n– Remediate priority infrastructure\nvulnerabilities;\n\n– Lock down remote access methods;\n\n– Protect privileged accounts;\n\n– Improve service account hygiene;\n\n– Remediate AD hygiene issues;\n\n– Secure local administrator accounts;\n\n– Enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for\nall remote access methods;\n\n– Restrict internet access to servers.\n\nThis governance should directly feed progress\nupdates into the Board committee. These progress\nupdates should clearly articulate:\n\n**•** the HSE’s vulnerability to ransomware attacks;\n\n**•** the risk reduction achieved by improvement\nactivities that have been delivered;,\n\n\n171 A programme that is made up of work packages that rapidly reduce the risk of ransomware attacks and are achievable in 60 days\nor less\n172 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/06/30/cisas-cset-tool-sets-sights-ransomware-threat\n\n\n-----\n\n**•** the extent of the improvements required to reduce\nthe risk of ransomware attacks to an acceptable\nlevel.\n\n**8.** **FA1.KR8 Bring the governance of ongoing**\n**IT and cybersecurity improvement projects**\n**under the tactical cybersecurity improvement**\n**programme (see tactical recommendation 1.5**\n**_in Section 4.2). Governance of current on-going_**\nIT projects, that directly or indirectly result in\ncyber risk reduction, should be brought under the\ntactical cybersecurity improvement programme’s\ngovernance (and therefore the CISO see key\nrecommendation FA1.KR7), so the cyber risk\nreduction they deliver can be tracked, and any\nrisk and issues can be resolved. For example,\nmodernisation projects such as the upgrading of\nWindows 7 OS and platform modernisation.\n\n**9.** **FA1.KR9 Use security testing ‘find and fix’ to**\n**identify additional security weaknesses and**\n**vulnerabilities by simulating cyber attack**\n**techniques, before identifying and triaging**\n**pragmatic fixes (see tactical recommendation**\n**_1.5 in Section 4.2). Security testing should be_**\nused to focus tactical improvement activities.\nBy simulating the threat of human-operated\nransomware attacks, improvements that make\nit more difficult for an Attacker to successfully\ncompromise the organisation can be identified.\nThe HSE should bring together red team\nexperts[173] and cybersecurity engineers to\nidentify pragmatic fixes to the vulnerabilities and\nweaknesses identified. These fixes should then\nbe triaged with IT and Security teams to assess\ntheir feasibility and identify how best to deliver\nthem (see key recommendation FA1.KR7 Triage).\nSecurity testing should then be used to validate\nimprovements have been correctly implemented.\n\n**10. FA1.KR10 Schedule a ‘red team’ ethical**\n**hacking exercise for early 2022 to demonstrate**\n**the effectiveness of tactical improvements**\n**made and identify areas for further**\n**improvement (see tactical recommendation 1.5**\n**_in Section 4.2). The HSE’s interim CISO should_**\nschedule a red team for Q1 2022 to simulate a\nhuman-operated ransomware attack from end-toend, to identify whether improvements have been\neffective, and to identify additional priority and\nfocus areas for cybersecurity improvements. This\nshould be scheduled in addition to the recorded\nplans within the Q2 DRR, which recorded an\n‘action control’ to enhance penetration testing\nand red team exercises with a due date of 31\nDecember 2021.[174]\n\n\n**11. FA1.KR11 Implement the following tactical**\n**recommendations identified through**\n**this review, within the mobilised tactical**\n**cybersecurity improvement programme (see**\n**_key recommendation F1.KR7) (see tactical_**\n**_recommendation 1.5 in Section 4.2):_**\n\n**a.** Improve security monitoring capability\n\n**i.** Document a process for how to respond\nto cybersecurity alerts, that clearly outlines\nhow alerts should be triaged, investigated,\ncontained and responded to. This process\nshould also include coordinating the\nresponse to security alerts and incidents\nraised by any organisations connected to\nthe NHN.\n\n**ii.** Augment the Security Operations team\nwith cybersecurity expertise.\n\n**b.** Secure privileged access\n\n**i.** Develop and implement a robust\nprivileged access strategy that aligns\nwith Microsoft good practice and reduces\nthe risk of privileged accounts being\ncompromised.\n\n**c.** Build a vulnerability management capability\n\n**i.** Stand up a vulnerability management\ncapability that continuously scans for\nvulnerabilities that can be exploited by\nattackers.\n\n**d.** Harden the security boundary\n\n**i.** Define and communicate a ‘security\nboundary’ for the HSE to provide a clear\nboundary of cybersecurity responsibilities.\n\n**ii.** Perform hardening activities on the\ndefined perimeter of the HSE.\n\n**iii.** Identify secure methods for clinical staff in\nvoluntary hospitals to access applications\nhosted by the HSE.\n\n**iv.** Use security testing to validate that\nthe HSE can not be compromised by\nmalicious activity from outside its security\nboundary.\n\n\n173 Red team experts are ethical hackers who perform simulated cyber attacks through the use of the same tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs) used by attackers\n174 DRR Q2 2021, 19 November 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n**e.** Improve governance over the NHN\n\n**i.** Risk assess the ‘flat’ network design and\nimplement segmentation controls that\nalign to the defined level of risk appetite.\n\n**ii.** Establish clear responsibilities for IT\nand cybersecurity across all parties that\nconnect to the NHN, or share health data,\nor access shared health services.\n\n**iii.** Increase the resourcing of first and second\nline network teams in line with defined\nsecurity responsibilities.\n\n**iv.** Define a security code of connection for\nconnecting to the NHN.\n\n**v.** Define a minimum security standard for\nthe networking of medical devices.\n\n**f.** Improve preparedness for a ransomware\nattack\n\n**i.** Collect, organise and document artefacts\ncreated as part of the response and\nrecovery to the ransomware cyber attack.\n\n**ii.** Identify documents required to respond\nto a ransomware attack (e.g., network\ndiagrams, asset list) and secure these in\na cloud repository. This should be aligned\nwith work to develop an IT continuity and\nrecoverability process which was recorded\nin the Q2 DRR as an ‘action control’ with a\ndue date of 30 September 2021.[175]\n\n**iii.** Setup and test out-of-band\ncommunication medium that would\nenable IT and security teams, as well as\nemployees, to communicate in the event\nof a cybersecurity incident.\n\n**iv.** Ensure that the HSE has a fit-forpurpose incident response service with\ncomplementing and embedded internal\nprocesses for its invocation.\n\n**v.** Review backups and plan for a widespread failure recovery mode.\n\n**vi.** Document a prioritised list of applications\nfor recovery.\n\n175 DRR Q2 2021, 19 November 2020\n176 DRR Q2 2021, 19 November 2020\n\n\n**g.** Accelerate foundational IT projects\n\n**i.** Accelerate the move to cloud based email\n\nby prioritising the resources\navailable for IT and cybersecurity\nimprovements programmes.\n\n**ii.** Prioritise the remediation of critical\nlegacy systems. Particular attention\nshould be paid to the NIMIS application\nto understand whether the configuration\nchanges made in one hospital (Hospital\nA) to enable the application to run\non Windows 10 can be more widely\nimplemented to expedite the central\nWindows 10 rollout plans. It should be\nnoted that a legacy risk was recorded\nin the Q2 DRR, with an aligned ‘action\ncontrols’ to risk assess the existing estate\nand increase investment for replacing\noutdated structures both with due dates of\n31 December 2021.[176]\n\n**iii.** Define a minimum standard for legacy\noperating systems. For systems that\nmust run on outdated operating systems,\nsufficient mitigation measures must be\ndefined.\n\n**iv.** Define minimum standard requirements for\nOS of medical devices.\n\n**v.** Perform asset discovery activities to\ncontinually update asset lists.\n\n###### Medium-term recommendations\n\n**1.** **FA1.KR12 Appoint suitable long-term senior**\n**leadership for cybersecurity (a CISO) and**\n**establish a suitably resourced and skilled**\n**central cybersecurity function (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 3.1 in Section 4.1). The_**\nCISO should be at National Director level, a\ndirect report to the CTTO, and have appropriate\naccess to the EMT and their agenda, to ensure\nthat cybersecurity risks are understood and\nconsidered in all decision-making. They should\nbe empowered to execute on a defined security\nvision, strategy and transformation to achieve\nsustainable cybersecurity risk reduction across\nthe HSE. In line with this appointment the\ncybersecurity governance and operating model\nshould be defined and subsequently resourced\n(ideally with burst capacity resources used during\nany interim periods that occur while recruitment\ntakes place). This model should align to the\nthree line of defence model. Responsibilities,\n\n\n-----\n\naccountabilities, reporting lines and resourcing\nacross the extended organisation of the HSE\nmust all be defined. This includes within the\nHSE’s cybersecurity and IT teams and between\nthese central teams and those within its extended\norganisation.\n\n**2.** **FA1.KR13 Deliver a multi-year cybersecurity**\n**transformation programme to build defence in**\n**depth over time and address root-cause issues**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 3.2 in Section_**\n**_4.1). Investment is needed in a single programme_**\nof work delivered over the next two - four years\nto develop core cybersecurity capabilities in a\nsustainable manner over the short, mid and long\nterm. We would propose this transformation\nis structured according to a two-track delivery\nmodel with dedicated resources and defined\ntarget states:\n\n**a.** **Tactical track - the HSE should bring**\ntogether red team experts and cybersecurity\nengineers to identify pragmatic fixes to the\nvulnerabilities and weaknesses identified.\nThese should then be triaged between this\ntactical track and the strategic track for any\n\n\nlonger term strategic activities. Within the\ntactical track each activity should be defined\nas being achievable within either ‘two-week\nagile sprints’ or ‘60-days work packages’,\nto deliver rapid risk reduction by addressing\nexposure to specific attack techniques.\nOnce the cybersecurity transformation\nprogramme is operational this track should\nabsorb the tactical cybersecurity improvement\nprogramme.\n\n**b.** **Strategic track - To build the sustainable and**\nenabling foundations that deliver long-term\nreduction and mitigation of cyber risk, the\nHSE should define strategic work packages\nfor activities that will take longer than 60 days\nto implement. This will include the medium\nrecommendations made in this report.\nFor improvements that are identified to be\ndelivered strategically, suitable mitigations\nshould be put in place in the short-term to\nreduce risk.\n\nIt would be typical for tactical and strategic track\nwork packages to be defined across topics/work\nstreams such as those shown in Figure 12:\n\n\n**Figure 12: Overview of key pillars in a cybersecurity transformation. This identifies elements that should be**\n**considered when scoping a cybersecurity transformation programme**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, within the ‘IT Foundations’ work\nstream tactical work packages might include the\nremediation of stale data or extending the scope of\nthe identity directory. Strategic work packages within\nthis work stream could include decommissioning\nend of life systems or implementing an operational\nCMDB to maintain an updated list of all systems and\napplications in the environment.\n\n**3.** **FA1.KR14 Plan the HSE’s future IT**\n**transformation that reduces cybersecurity risk**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 2.2 in Section_**\n**_4.1). The HSE’s IT transformation lead should_**\nbegin documenting and planning the future IT\ntransformation. Executing an IT transformation will\nallow the HSE to sustainably reduce cybersecurity\nrisk in the long-term, as issues within the legacy\nIT estate can be addressed,and cybersecurity and\nresilience can be built into the IT architecture.\n\n**4.** **FA1.KR15 Design and implement a single and**\n**centralised security monitoring capability**\n**for the defined security boundary of the HSE**\n**that reports into the CISO (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 3.2 in Section 4.1)._** This\nshould be for all monitoring aspects including\nnetwork, server and workstation environments,\nas well as services such as email. Any reduction\nin the visibility of assets for monitoring should be\nrisk-assessed to ensure that the HSE’s ability to\nmonitor its full environment is within risk appetite.\nThis implementation should involve establishing\nthe following across the three fundamental pillars\nof people, process and technology:\n\n**•** **People - Employing security monitoring and**\ndetection SMEs (either internally or through third\nparties) that are trained to identify and respond\nto threats detected within and across the HSE\nsecurity boundary.\n\n**•** **Process - Ensuring that detection and response**\nprocesses are documented. This includes incident\nplaybooks that outline the step-by-step response\nactions to be taken, as well as documented\nresponsibilities and accountabilities for reporting\nsecurity events between organisations (such as\nvoluntary hospitals and reporting bodies like the\nNCSC).\n\n**•** **Tooling - Deployment of modern endpoint**\ndetection and response tooling/endpoint\nprotection platform tooling across the HSE\nenvironment and security boundary. This should\nbe in addition to the implementation of a Security\nIncident and Event Manager (“SIEM”) and\nSecurity Operations Centre (“SOC”) to centrally\nanalyse logs from systems and security tools.\n\n\n###### Focus area 1 conclusion\n\nThe HSE was not sufficiently prepared to defend\nagainst or respond to a ransomware cyber attack.\nThe HSE did not have sufficient subject matter\nexpertise, resources or appropriate security tooling\nto detect, prevent or respond to a cyber attack of this\nscale and complexity. As a result, the attacker was\nable to enter the HSE environment and move around\nwith relative ease and there were several missed\nopportunities to detect malicious activity, prior to the\ndetonation phase of the ransomware.\n\nFollowing the execution of ransomware, the HSE\nmobilised a response to overcome the significant\nchallenges posed by both the attack and its lack of\npreparedness. Due to the scale and impact of the\nransomware, paired with the complex and legacy IT\nenvironment, the technical recovery of IT systems\nwas challenging. The timeframe for recovery could\nhave been significantly longer had the decryption\nkey not been sourced, as the HSE would have had\nto rely on recovering applications and systems from\nbackups. The HSE would likely have encountered\nsignificant difficulties with this approach as the\nbackup infrastructure was primarily designed to\nrecover single systems only and not to recover\nmultiple systems at scale and pace.\n\nThe focus of the HSE’s activities since the attack has\nbeen on implementing recommendations provided\nby third parties and to continue to recover systems.\nA finalised cybersecurity improvement plan does not\nexist and limited evidence has been provided to show\nplanning that will significantly and sustainably reduce\nthe HSE’s exposure to future ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.2 Focus area 2 - review of organisation wide preparedness and strategic response\n\n###### Focus area 1 Focus area 2 Focus area 3\n\nReview the organisation-wide Review the preparedness of the\n\nReview the technical\n\npreparedness and strategic HSE to manage\n\ninvestigation and response\n\nresponse cyber risks\n\nKey findings and\nrecommendations\n\nConclusion\n\n###### Key findings and recommendations\n\n|Focus area 1|Col2|Focus area 2|Col4|Focus area 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Review the technical investigation and response||Review the organisation-wide preparedness and strategic response||Review the preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber risks|\n|||Key findings and recommendations|||\n|||Conclusion|||\n\n\n**Figure 13: Focus area 2 summary of key findings and recommendations**\n\n|Themes|Areas|No. of key findings|No. of key recommendations|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nIn reviewing the organisation-wide preparedness and\nstrategic response, we have incorporated guidelines\nand principles from ISO 22301:2019 ‘Security and\nresilience - Business continuity management systems\n(BCMS) - requirements’, BS 11200:2014 ‘Crisis\nManagement. Guidance and good practice’ and PD\nCEN/TS 17091:2018 ‘Crisis management - Guidance\nfor developing a strategic capability.\n\n\nISO 22301 defines business continuity as ‘the\ncapability of an organisation to continue the delivery\nof products and services within acceptable time\nframes at predefined capacity during a disruption’.[177]\nIn the context of the HSE, the term clinical and\nservices continuity is used throughout this section\nof the report. It refers to all acute and community\nservices, as well as corporate services, including, but\nnot limited to HR, procurement, finance, training, ICT\netc.\n\n\n177 ISO 22301:2019 ‘Security and resilience - Business continuity management systems (BCMS) - requirements’, p. 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe European Technical specification for Crisis\nManagement, PD CEN/TS 17091:2018 specifies\nthat organisations should be prepared for an\n‘unprecedented or extraordinary event or situation\nthat threatens an organization and requires a\nstrategic, adaptive, and timely response in order\nto preserve its viability and integrity, with clear,\nuniversally understood structures, roles and\nresponsibilities’.[178] It defines crisis management\nas ‘the developed capability of an organization\nto prepare for, anticipate, respond to and recover\nfrom crises’[179] and states that an organisation’s\ncrisis management capability is not normally part\nof routine organisational management, and should\nbe consciously and deliberately built and sustained\nthrough capital, resource and time investment.\n\nThe findings and recommendations in this section\nare mapped against the key thematic areas derived\nfrom these standards (see section 2.4 - Our review\n_approach). The findings and recommendations follow_\na numbering convention of FA2.KFX (Focus Area\n2: Key Finding X) and FA2.KRX (Focus Area 2: Key\nRecommendation X).\n\nSee Appendix F for a detailed organisational timeline.\n\n###### Crisis Preparedness\n\n Area 1: Governance over crisis and clinical and services continuity management in the HSE and across HGs and CHOs\n\n Introduction and Context\n\nThe HSE has shown itself to be well versed and\nproficient in major emergency management, a\ncapability that has been demonstrated through its\nresponse to several recent events, most notably the\n2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the 2019 nurses’\nstrike. The integration of the Major Emergency\nManagement Framework with the wider national\nemergency management capability enables a\ncomprehensive approach to plan for, to respond and\nto coordinate recovery from major emergencies which\nthreaten persons or infrastructure at a national as well\nas local level.\n\n\nThe organisation’s approach to incident and\nemergency management is detailed in the following\npreparation documents:\n\n**•** A Framework for Major Emergency Management;\n\n**•** Area Emergency Management Plans;\n\n**•** Hospital Major Emergency Plans;\n\n**•** Emergency Management Operational Delivery\nPlan; and\n\n**•** Incident Management Framework.\n\n**FA2.KF1 Crisis management and clinical and**\n**services continuity were not integrated within an**\n**overarching Operational Resilience Programme,**\n**leading to siloed work streams and capabilities**\n\nThere was little active integration between clinical and\nservices continuity, crisis management and the other\nclosely aligned disciplines to ensure they directly\ninformed planning and that preparedness evolved to\nprevailing conditions. The HSE is a large and diverse\norganisation with complex operational structures.\nInitiatives to achieve greater integration of resilience\ndisciplines were proposed in September 2019, when\nan Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) programme\nwas discussed at the Board meeting.[180] Following this\nReview the HSE’s new CEO and Board and Audit and\nRisk Committee led a programme of work to further\ndevelop the corporate governance of risk. This\nincluded greater oversight at Board and ARC level for\ncorporate risks, significant reviews of the Corporate\nRisk Register led by the EMT, work undertaken\nbetween the Board and the EMT to improve the\nrisk management process, the establishment of\na Corporate Risk Support Team and increased\ninvestment provided in the 2021 National Service\nPlan to strengthen the corporate level risk team.\n\nA subsequent review of the HSE’s corporate services\ncommenced in December 2019,[181] ultimately led\nto the proposal that a new role at National Director\nlevel would be established with responsibility for\nGovernance and Risk (“ND G&R”). Responsibilities\ninclude the development of risk and business\ncontinuity management frameworks through which\nrisk management and clinical and service continuity\nplans will be reviewed, maintained and validated.\nResponsibility for clinical and service continuity under\nthe HSE’s accountability structure will remain with\noperational and functional managers.[182] Resilience\n\n\n178 PD CEN/TS 17091:2018 ‘Crisis management - Guidance for developing a strategic capability’, p. 8.\n179 PD CEN/TS 17091:2018 ‘Crisis management - Guidance for developing a strategic capability’, p. 8.\n180 Minutes-hse-board-meeting-27-09-2019\n181 Centre Review Slides June 2021\n182 HSE_CCR_Phase2_HealthcareStrategy_Gov&Risk(Extract)\n\n\n-----\n\nwas also highlighted as a priority at the Performance\nand Delivery Committee meeting in June of 2021.[183]\n\nBoard oversight of the wider risk and resilience\ncapability is currently delivered through a number\nof different committees, under the consolidated\noversight of the Audit & Risk Committee, as follows:\n\n**•** Clinical and services continuity (currently\ndescribed as business continuity) - Audit & Risk\nCommittee; and previously People & Culture\nCommittee until June 2020;\n\n**•** Incident management - Safety & Quality\nCommittee;\n\n**•** Enterprise risk management - oversight and\nmanagement - Audit and Risk Committee; and\n\n**•** Cyber security - Performance & Delivery\nCommittee.\n\nThe workstreams related to these risks often operated\nin silos. Additionally, when risks were identified,\nimprovements to the HSE’s response capability were\nnot always informed by those risks. For example,\nthe Board received a detailed briefing in November\n2020 on the emerging cyber threats faced by the HSE\nand the increase of the ransomware risk to business\ncontinuity.[184,185] Nevertheless, the Cybersecurity and\nBusiness Continuity risk ratings in the CRR remained\nconstant (at a ‘High’ rating of 16).[186,187,188,189]\n\nFollowing the review of corporate services, the ND\nG&R (equivalent to a Chief Risk Officer) reports\nthrough the Chief Strategy Officer to the CEO, Audit &\nRisk Committee and Board on risk management. In a\nmature Operational Resilience Programme, we would\nexpect to see the separate, but related disciplines of\nrisk management, incident management, clinical and\nservices continuity and crisis management integrated\ninto a comprehensive resilience framework under the\ncoordination of a senior executive, usually a Chief\nRisk Officer who has appropriate access to the EMT,\nthe CEO and the Board. The framework allows for\nassurance over the operational capability that is being\ndelivered by relevant owners.\n\n**FA2.KR1.1 Establish governance and oversight**\n**of an Operational Resilience Programme (see**\n**strategic recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)**\n\n\nThe HSE should:\n\n**•** Nominate an executive with responsibility for\noperational resilience which will include the\ncoordination of component parts of crisis\nmanagement (including major emergency\nmanagement), incident management, clinical\nand services continuity and enterprise risk\nmanagement;\n\n**•** Establish a HSE Resilience SteerCo to oversee\nthe design and delivery of an Operational\nResilience Programme, reporting into the\nBoard. This SteerCo should include senior\nrepresentatives from the EMT who own the\nrespective resilience disciplines and related\nfunctions (e.g. cyber security), and any additional\nkey clinical and services and operations\nrepresentatives.\n\n**FA2.KR1.2 Establish an Operational Resilience**\n**Policy and Programme scope, strategy and**\n**structure (see strategic recommendation 4.1 in**\n**Section 4)**\n\nThe HSE should:\n\n**•** Define an overarching policy that incorporates\nthe above resilience disciplines. Clarify ownership\nof the programme (for example, under the ND\nG&R) and integration with existing policies. At a\nminimum, the policy should include a statement\nof leadership commitment, objectives and scope,\nroles and responsibilities, reference to relevant\nindustry standards and an oversight regime;\n\n**•** Define the Operational Resilience Programme\nscope, strategy and structure across the HSE and\nfunded entities. Define the types of incidents in\nscope (e.g. physical, technological, people and\ncyber incidents) and how to build and maintain\na capability to respond across the organisation.\nDefine the operating model or the capability in\nterms of dedicated staff, reporting lines, roles\nand responsibilities within ‘prepare’ and ‘respond\nand recover.’ Specify which areas of the HSE\nand funded entities are included and identify\naccountable teams/individuals for delivering\nspecific components of the programme.

This includes\na structured programme for delivering knowledge\nand skills training, and scenario-based exercises\nto all relevant stakeholders across the HSE\nand funded entities who have a role to play in\nany serious or significant incident or crisis; as\nwell as additional training resources, validation\nprogrammes and independent Internal Audit\nreview to the Board;\n\n**•** Ensure ND G&R and at least one Board member\nhas direct competency/experience in the area of\noperational resilience.\n\n**FA2.KF2 There was no effective governance or**\n**consistent ownership of clinical and services**\n**continuity across the HSE**\n\nThere was no central Clinical and Services Continuity\nManagement System Framework in place in the HSE\nprior to the cyber attack. Roles and responsibilities in\nrespect of the management and oversight of clinical\nand services continuity were not documented, nor\nwere there any structured governance mechanisms\nto implement, monitor and report progress on the\nobjectives contained in the 2016 Business Continuity\nPolicy.[190] In the absence of this framework, clinical\nand services continuity capability was not adequately\nresourced or embedded. This was identified in the\nreview of the HSE’s corporate services, initiated in\n2019; and while enterprise risk management and\n\n190 Business Continuity Management Policy 2016\n191 Site Workshop 6 and 11 (Hospital C and Hospital A)\n192 Audit and Risk Committee TORs\n\n\nclinical and services continuity are now consolidated\nunder the National Director for Governance and Risk\n_(see also finding FA2.KF1), a significant body of work_\nwill be required to address this gap.\n\nDue to the historic lack of governance and oversight\nover clinical and services continuity across HGs\nand the HSE funded entities, a fragmented and\nunvalidated capability was also apparent across\nindividual hospitals and CHOs. There was no\nevidence of Clinical and Services Continuity\nPolicies at any of the sample sites or of formalised\nsteering committees with documented roles and\nresponsibilities for the ongoing and continuous\nmaintenance of the local Clinical and Services\nContinuity Management System. Senior members\nof the HSE commented that there was insufficient\nsupport and resources provided to HGs and CHOs to\nensure standardised and consistent approaches to\nclinical and services continuity management at local\nsite level. While continuity of services is implied in\nservice level agreements with hospitals, there is no\nspecific requirement to demonstrate a clinical and\nservices continuity capability.[191] Internal Audit scrutiny\nof all organisations funded by the HSE is permitted\nin the Audit and Risk Committees ToRs.

Failure to\nconduct a comprehensive Clinical and Services\nImpact Analysis process hinders the development of\nadequate workarounds to maintain critical operations.\n\nStandardised or formalised Clinical and Services\nImpact Analysis processes were not evident at HSE\ncentre, support services, or sample hospital and CHO\nsites. Even those sample sites where the clinical and\nservices continuity posture was proactive and mature\n(e.g. Site Workshop 11), a Clinical and Services Impact\nAnalysis had not been conducted. Some hospital and\nCHO response teams reactively defined their recovery\npriorities during the initial phase of the attack because\nthere was no Clinical and Services Impact Analysis.\nThis diverted effort from the response towards tasks\nwhich should have been completed in advance of\nthe cyber attack, eg., defining a schedule of systems\nfor recovery based on pre-agreed Recovery Time\nObjectives (“RTOs”) and Recovery Point Objectives\n(“RPOs”). Several interviewees noted that in the\nabsence of a Clinical and Services Impact Analysis\nthe early prioritisation scheme was driven by the OES\nlist, before advancing to an approach that focused on\nclinical risks,[194] delaying the recovery of patient critical\nservices (see also finding FA2.KF17). The extent of the\ninitial disruption and maintenance of essential services\nvaried significantly across the sample sites. There\nwas also significant variance in the effectiveness and\navailability of workarounds or recovery strategies to\nensure consistency of critical patient services.\n\n\n193 ISO 22317 Societal security - Business continuity management systems - Guidelines for business impact analysis (BIA)\n194 Site Workshop 8 (Hospital B)\n\n\n-----\n\n**FA2.KR3.1 Establish and embed a clear**\n**and consistent approach to Clinical and**\n**Services Impact Analysis across the HSE to**\n**inform recovery prioritisation (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 4.1 in Section 4)_**\n\nTo ensure a standardised organisation-wide approach\nto the Clinical and Services Impact Analysis process,\nthe Executive Sponsor for clinical and services\ncontinuity at the HSE and each HG/hospital and CHO\nshould:\n\n**•** Establish and embed a formal Clinical and\nServices Impact Analysis process, with clear\nownership at each level, including the criteria for\nthe “RTOs”[195] and “RPOs”[196];\n\n**•** Ensure the results of the Clinical and Services\nImpact Analysis are formally reviewed and\napproved on a periodic basis, by senior\nmanagement, and following any significant\nsystems/process, operational, regulatory or\npersonnel change.\n\n**FA2.KR3.2 Design clinical and services continuity**\n**workarounds, based on the Clinical and Services**\n**Impact Analysis, to enable the HSE to continue**\n**providing critical services while responding to an**\n**incident or crisis (see strategic recommendation**\n**_4.2 in Section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should:\n\n**•** Design and agree clinical and services continuity\nworkarounds, for critical processes, with the\nagility and governance to be maintained for a\nprolonged period, and based on the Clinical and\nServices Impact Analysis;\n\n**•** Assess all workarounds to ensure they do not\npose an unacceptable risk to patient care or to\nthe HSE through the transfer of data or other\nassets between systems;\n\n**•** Align workarounds for similar systems or\nprocesses across the HSE to improve their\neffectiveness and inform a consistent response;\n\n**•** Reflect the workarounds in the relevant Clinical\nand Services Continuity Plan.\n\n**FA2.KF4 There was no standardised approach to**\n**clinical and services continuity planning across**\n\n\n**the HSE**\n\nThere is no framework or mechanism in place at the\nHSE to ensure that the clinical and services continuity\nplanning is aligned to the policy objectives. No\nintegrated and comprehensive clinical and services\ncontinuity planning exists at the HSE. Additionally,\nwhile some hospitals had a level of clinical and\nservices continuity planning in place, there was\nno evidence that this process was consistently\nformalised or conducted across sampled HGs,\nhospitals or CHOs, to deliver a local clinical and\nservices continuity capability.[197] Where workarounds\nwere in place, there was inconsistency in emphasis,\nlayout and terminology and no evidence that the\ndetermination, adoption and resourcing of those\nworkarounds had input or steer from the HSE\ncentrally.\n\nThe absence of pre-prepared Clinical and Services\nContinuity Plans severely impacted the initial stages\nof the response to the cyber attack, as resources\nhad to be diverted away from the response effort to\ncompile essential information, create structures and\nprioritise services for recovery which should have\nbeen formalised and articulated during a preparatory\nphase.[198, 199] Recurring examples given in interviews\nof this were construction of call trees, compiling\nasset registers, critical service prioritisation and\ndefinition and use of alternative communications\nmethods. Furthermore, recovery solutions were often\ninaccessible as hard copies were not available.\n\n**FA2.KR4 Develop and embed consistent Clinical**\n**and Services Continuity Plans at strategic, tactical**\n**and operational levels that align with the Clinical**\n**and Services Impact Analysis (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 4.2 in Section 4)._**\n\n###### To ensure that Clinical and Services Continuity Plans are compatible with the recovery objectives, the HSE should:\n\n**•** Implement Clinical and Services Continuity Plans\nat strategic, tactical and operational levels of the\nHSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs and that they\nformally document workarounds and the steps\ninvolved to resume normal operations;\n\n\n195 Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the period of time following an incident within which a product and service or an activity is\nresumed or resources are recovered (ISO 22300:2021).\n196 Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the point at which information used by an activity is restored to enable the activity to operate on\nresumption (ISO 22300:2021)\n197 A sample of example plans include: Hospital C Business Continuity Plan Dec 2019, Hospital F Pandemic Preparedness Plan,\nHospital E Internal Emergency Response Plan, Midlands SAP Payroll Business Continuity Plan\n198 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n199 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n\n\n-----\n\n**•** Benchmark the Clinical and Services Continuity\nPlan construction against ISO 22331, and ensure\nthey are compatible with future Sláintecare\nobjectives;[200]\n\n**•** Incorporate the testing of these steps into the\nclinical and services continuity management\ntraining and exercising schedule/programme (e.g.\nthrough desktop walkthrough of the resumption\nprocedures to identify any gaps or unforeseen\ndependencies);\n\n**•** Ensure soft and hard copies of Clinical and\nServices Continuity Plans are available in\nappropriate areas.\n\n**FA2.KF5 The HSE did not have an adequate**\n**internal Crisis Management Framework or plans**\n**to support the response to the Conti attack, nor**\n**had they planned for severe but plausible total**\n**loss scenarios**\n\nThe Major Emergency Management and Incident\nManagement Frameworks (as well as interim\nEmergency Management governance arrangements\npublished in 2020) have been invoked on multiple\noccasions and delivered an agile and effective\nresponse to short term surge demands on health\nservices.[201,202]\n\nThere is an inconsistent and interchangeable use\nof the terms ‘major emergency management’ and\n‘emergency management’ and ‘crisis management’.\nCrisis planning throughout the HSE was focused on\nthe scenarios which would mobilise major emergency\nmanagement teams, such as adverse weather,\npandemic, epidemic, serious accidents and terrorist\naction. There was no Crisis Management Plan in\nplace to guide the HSE’s response to an internal\ncrisis impacting the HSE itself, rather than an external\ncrisis such as COVID-19 or Storm Emma; nor has\nit developed and exercised scenario-specific plans\nfor the response to severe disruption scenarios,\n(e.g. total loss of premises, systems or people). A\nfundamental assumption of these plans is that all\nmission critical systems and infrastructure would\nremain available to the response teams. The HSE has\nnot conducted any scenario planning for the total\nloss of a facility, system, process or service (see also\n_finding FA2.KF21). While risks were noted on the_\nCorporate Risk Register (especially cyber security\nand clinical and services continuity), there was limited\nevidence to suggest the HSE undertakes subsequent\nscenario planning to:\n\n**•** Identify potential triggers and escalators for the\nworst, best and most likely scenarios per risk;\n\n\n\n**•** identify likely impacts;\n\n**•** undertake mitigating actions despite the fact that\ncyber security and clinical and services continuity\nwere identified as strategic risks.\n\nSuch scenario-specific plans would outline the likely\nimpacts caused by highly plausible organisational\ncrises, as well as the key considerations, and\ncorresponding pre-agreed decisions to guide the\nstrategic response to those events.\n\n**FA2.KR5.1 Design an end-to-end Crisis**\n**Management Framework (integrated with the**\n**existing MEM and IM Frameworks) and overseen**\n**by the HSE Resilience Steering Group (see finding**\n**_FA2.KR1.1 and strategic recommendation 4.2 in_**\n**_Section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should review the existing incident and\nemergency management structures, and the\nstructures established during the attack and other\nrecent events (e.g. COVID-19), to establish a new\nintegrated end-to-end organisation-wide Crisis\nManagement Framework that is fit-for-purpose across\na wide variety of crisis types. This Framework should\nincorporate all resilience disciplines responsible for\nimplementing organisational preparedness activities\n(e.g. emergency/incident/crisis response, and\nclinical and services continuity management), and\nidentify accountable teams/individuals for specific\ncomponents, as well as define all levels of response\nrequired during an actual event at strategic, tactical\nand operational levels. It should also integrate with\nthe relevant elements of the organisation-wide Major\nEmergency Management and Incident Management\nFrameworks.\n\nThe Framework should include the following\nelements:\n\n**•** Hierarchy of teams required for response.\nTypically this will include three layers operational, tactical and strategic - with\ncommand and control escalating according to the\nnature and severity of the incident;\n\n**•** Defined roles and responsibilities, and decision\nmaking authority, for all those involved in the\nidentification, escalation, response to and\nmanagement of incidents;\n\n**•** Escalation thresholds and formalised\ncommunication channels;\n\n**•** Guidance on how and when to invoke response\nstructure in line with the Incident Classification\nand Severity Matrix (see also finding FA2.KF14);\n\n\n200 ISO 22331 Security and resilience - Business continuity management systems - Guidelines\n201 Incident Management Framework 2020\n202 A Framework for Major Emergency Management\n\n\n-----\n\n**•** Agreed touchpoints and interaction between the\nHSE, and HGs and CHOs;\n\n**•** Tools and templates to be used by all responders\n(across the HSE, HG and CHO levels) during an\nincident (e.g., situation report, classification and\nseverity matrix, impact assessment, decision and\naction logs).\n\n**FA2.KR5.2 Design a suite of crisis response**\n**plans and procedures to underpin the Crisis**\n**Management Framework (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 4.2 in Section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should design:\n\n**•** A Crisis Management Plan providing detailed\nroles and responsibilities for key positions in the\nNCMT and supporting tactical teams (e.g. HG/\nhospital and CHO leadership), including checklists\nof activities and considerations, and details of\nthird party support available;\n\n**•** A Technical/Operational Coordination Guide\nproviding the details of how the technical (e.g. IT\nOps) and operational teams (e.g. clinical response\nteams) would coordinate and work together.\nThis includes detailed roles and responsibilities,\ninformation flows, processes, checklists of key\nactivities and considerations and details of third\nparty support available;\n\n**•** Scenario-specific plans providing detailed stepby-step operational guides for specific scenarios\n(e.g. analyst response to malware, fire response\nplan).

Whilst investment in the External\nCommunications Team has increased to circa 76 full\ntime employees (FTE), the Internal Communications\nTeam consisted of circa six FTE.[204] Stakeholders\nnoted that the Internal Communications Team had\nstruggled to deliver on their growth strategy because\nimmediate crises and operational requirements had\nconsistently diverted the attention of the team.[205]\n\n**FA2.KR6 Ensure that the resources assigned**\n**to internal communications are sufficient (see**\n**_strategic recommendation 4.2 and tactical_**\n**_recommendation 3.1 in Section 4)._**\n\nAn effective Internal Communications Team is critical\nto disseminate information and guidance to all\n130,000 HSE staff[206] all operating across different\nlevels of the response; this requires additional\nresources and staff to what is currently available.\nAs part of their future crisis management planning,\nthe HSE should assess the requirements of their\ncrisis response communications strategy and\nallocate the resources necessary to grow the internal\ncommunications team, to reflect the HSE’s current\noperational architecture, and taking into consideration\nthe impacted and involved stakeholder base.\n\n**FA2.KF7 There was no documented HSE Crisis**\n**Communications Plan in place; and the crisis**\n**communications capability across HG/hospital**\n**and CHOs was fragmented**\n\nThe HSE’s external communications strategy in\nresponse to the ransomware attack, whilst wellexecuted, was based on previous experience for the\norganisation rather than a formally documented Crisis\nCommunications Plan.

Whilst the\nHSE’s national communications teams have a well\nestablished communications network, developed\nthrough weekly meetings during the COVID-19\npandemic, the local communications teams have\nvarying levels of experience and available resources.\nThe absence of a consistent communications\nstrategy across HGs and CHOs resulted in different\nmessages being conveyed to patients; some were\ntold to come in unless told otherwise whilst others\nwere told to stay at home unless explicitly told to\ncome into the hospital. This disparity in experience\nand subsequent strategy has been flagged in the\nCorporate Risk Register since February 2020 under\nthe risk of damage to the HSE’s ‘Organisational\nreputation’, with a corresponding action to ‘enhance\n_communications functions in new Regional Health_\n_Areas’.[208]_\n\n**FA2.KR7 Document the Communications Team’s**\n**existing response structures, processes, tools and**\n**templates in a Crisis Communications Plan (see**\n**_tactical recommendation 3.1 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should document a formal Crisis\nCommunications Plan to ensure consistent and\nefficient communications management across\nthe organisation during an incident/crisis, and to\nguide the actions of new members of the HSE’s\nCommunications Team.\n\n**•** The Communications Team should document the\nresponse processes, tools and templates, and\nstructures they have found most effective during\nprevious incidents, ensuring the resulting plan\ndovetails into any existing Major Emergency and\nCrisis Management Plans and processes, in line\nwith the Crisis Management Framework (see also\n_finding FA2.KF5);_\n\n**•** The Crisis Communications Plan should\nbe reviewed in conjunction with the Crisis\n\n207 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n208 CRR Full Report Summary and Risk Assessments v0.1 28 02 20\n209 Site Workshop 5 (Hospital F)\n210 Site Workshop 10 (Hospital I)\n211 Site Workshop 5 (Hospital F)\n212 Site Workshop 1 (CHO B)\n\n\nCommunications Plans in place at the HGs and\nCHOs to ensure the structures and processes\ninvolved integrate effectively;\n\n**•** Once finalised, all processes and templates,\nespecially those requiring collaboration with other\nHSE teams, should be socialised and ratified to\nensure they are fit for purpose and based on upto-date information;\n\n**•** The Crisis Communications Plan should be\nreviewed regularly to confirm the content is still\ncorrect and relevant, and to incorporate any\nlessons learnt from new incidents.\n\n###### Area 4: Awareness, training and exercising capability at the HSE, HG/ hospitals and CHOs\n\n**FA2.KF8 Awareness, training and exercising**\n**of the crisis management and clinical and**\n**services continuity capabilities were not formally**\n**embedded across HSE**\n\nVarious emergency management exercises have been\nheld across the HSE, covering responses to several\nscenarios such as extreme weather and exposure to\ninfectious diseases. There was also evidence of more\nadvanced training and exercising capabilities in place\nat some HGs and CHOs.[209, 210] However, there was\nno evidence of a HSE-wide training and exercising\nprogramme to ensure the right people, at the right\nlevels, were trained in their functions, roles and\nresponsibilities in a crisis.[211, 212] For example, there\nwas isolated but limited evidence that staff involved\nin the Conti response had received training on the\nHSE’s clinical and services continuity capability,\npriorities and plans prior to the crisis.\n\n\n-----\n\nkey sites to simulate loss/denial scenarios of critical\ninfrastructure. There was also a lack of evidence to\nshow how the risks identified in the Corporate Risk\nRegister informed the design of plausible scenariobased exercises.[213, 214, 215]\n\nWhilst there were pockets of good practice across\nthe organisation where local entities deliver frequent\nemergency management exercises, there was no\nevidence that the clinical and service continuity\nexercises delivered followed a standard approach\nor aligned to best practice design as outlined in\nindustry standards. The absence of a comprehensive\napproach to integrated crisis management training\nand validation across the organisation has resulted\nin the following findings, evidenced in a sample of\nhospitals:\n\n**•** Plans did not capture challenges which could\nhave been identified during a rigorous validation\nprocess; for example, the unavailability of hard\ncopies of Clinical and Services Continuity plans,\nan inability to install WiFi post attack, absence\nof call trees and no alternative communications\nplan;[216]\n\n**•** The absence of well-articulated roles,\nresponsibilities and crisis management structure\n(e.g. local level responders were unsure of their\nroles and the structures in place);[217]\n\n**•** No clear decision making authority, including\ndelegated decision making to HGs/hospitals\nand CHOs, that is clear to the National Crisis\nManagement Team and executives, as well as\nsupporting teams and structures[218];\n\n**•** No Crisis Communications Plan or recognition for\nthe need of a HSE-wide internal alert system or\nalternative communications channels[219] to allow\ncascading information between the HSE, CHOs\nand HGs;\n\n\n**FA2.KR8.1 Establish a formal training and**\n**exercising programme in support of the**\n**Operational Resilience Programme (see also**\n**_Finding FA2.KF1 and strategic recommendation_**\n**_4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should:\n\n**•** Ensure this programme incorporates clinical\nand services continuity and crisis management\nrequirements and that all relevant individuals and\nteams involved at every level of the HSE become\nfamiliar with their roles and responsibilities in a\ncrisis or significant clinical and services continuity\nincident;\n\n**•** Ensure it is aligned to ISO 22398 Security and\n_resilience - Guidelines for exercising and testing._\nDefine and implement standard training and\nexercising templates which articulate scope,\nobjectives, assumptions, results, issues log and\nlessons learned.\n\n**FA2.KR8.2 Deliver training to staff in key**\n**responsible and supporting roles, and new**\n**managers (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in**\n**_section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should:\n\n**•** Provide clinical and services continuity and crisis\nmanagement training for staff in key responsible\nand supporting roles.

This was\ndemonstrated by the speed with which the NCMT\nfirst convened at 08:30 on 14 May and the clear\ngovernance and administrative structures put around\ntheir response activities.[223, 224] Another example is\nthat, with communications platforms unavailable\nacross the HSE, the Internal Communications\nTeam were still able to publish information to the\nHSE website; this was due to a previous decision\n\n\nto reduce the website’s dependency on the HSE\ninfrastructure, based on lessons learned from\nprevious IT disruptions.[225]\n\nAt the hospital and CHO level, several sample\nsites had proactively conducted after action\nassessments[226] of the response to clinical and\nservices continuity events and applied these in a\nlessons learned programme. Notable examples of this\nwere CUH with comprehensive post event analysis\nof Storm Emma and laboratory outages. Moreover,\nexamples of populated lessons learned spreadsheets\nwere shared, illustrating that a wider awareness about\nthe importance of a lessons learned process is in\nplace.[227]\n\nHowever, there is insufficient overarching governance\nand process to ensure that lessons from incident and\nmajor emergency response are not just identified, but\nassigned ownership, addressed, and disseminated to\ninform structural improvements across the HSE and\nfunded entities. Specifically, where individual reviews\nwere conducted, there was a lack of evidence\nindicating lessons learned were shared more broadly\nwith other areas of the HSE, and with HGs and\nCHOs. Actions for implementing lessons learned do\nnot appear to have been assigned owners to ensure\nthey are completed, indicating that while lessons\nmay be identified, they do not systematically lead to\nimprovement or change.\n\n**FA2.KR9 Review and refine the post-incident**\n**review process to ensure ongoing and continuous**\n**improvement of the response capability (see**\n**_strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nFormal and consistent post-incident reviews should\nbe conducted following all incidents or near misses\nto capture both areas of positive performance and\nopportunities for improvement. The Operational\nResilience Steering Group should ensure that all\npost incident reviews are reported centrally to enable\nlearnings to be disseminated across the HSE and\nfunded entities (see also finding FA2.KF1). Mitigating\nactions should be assigned a responsible owner\nand tracked centrally until their completion. The\nprocess should be reflected in the end-to-end Crisis\nManagement Framework (see also recommendation\n_FA2.KR5.1)._\n\n\n221 Incident Management Framework 2020\n222 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n223 Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance and Admin V1.10 31052021\n224 Programme org chart v1 21.05.21\n225 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n226 Site Workshop 8 (Hospital B)\n227 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Area 6: Human factors and cultural contributors\n\n**FA2.KF10 Emergency response was ingrained in**\n**the HSE’s core operations; HSE staff had a natural**\n**ability to respond to emergencies, despite a lack**\n**of organisational preparedness**\n\nAt the time of the cyber attack the HSE was over\na year into a multifaceted and prolonged crisis\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. All workshop\nparticipants stated that staff from all levels across\nthe HSE, impacted hospitals, CHOs and third parties\nwent above and beyond to support the cyber attack\nresponse effort.[228,229,230,231]\n\nIn times of significant challenge or emergencies staff\nacross the health service are able to demonstrate\nresilience, and exhibit efficient and quick decision\nmaking grounded in organisational values (e.g.\nprioritisation of patient service and care). A prevalent\ntheme in interviews is that the staff are ‘perpetually\nresponding to emergencies’[232, 233, 234], and are\ntherefore naturally skilled at it.\n\nHowever, the significant majority of individuals\ninterviewed also clearly stated that the HSE was not\nprepared to manage an event of this magnitude and\nscale.[235] Clinical and services continuity and crisis\n_preparedness, as opposed to emergency response,_\nwas not evidenced as a corporate priority in the\nHSE. Interviewees commonly commented that a\nreactive posture to crisis had largely been normalised\nand accepted day-to-day practice.[236] The apparent\nnormalisation of crises had led to a predominantly\nreactive posture towards crisis response, a\nconfidence in the HSE’s crisis management capability,\nand a reduced perceived need for significant advance\npreparation for wider incidents, organisational crisis\nor ‘black swan’ events.\n\nThe leadership style and decision-making process\nrequired during a crisis is necessarily different than\nthat required during business as usual, even within\nhigh tempo, safety critical operations such as health\ncare. Crises are associated with heightened stress\n\n\nthat impacts on the decision-making process, which\nis made more complex by the constraints of time,\nthe volume of decisions to be made and the scarcity\nof available information. For example, decisions\nhad to be made in the response to the Conti attack\nwhere supporting data was not available and where\nIT and clinical priorities were not understood or\naligned (e.g. the decision to disconnect appliances\nfrom the network, made in the absence of a clinical\nand services impact analysis outlining the critical\nsystems, the impacts to be caused, and service level\nagreements for recovery).\n\nThe consequence of being in perpetual ‘crisis\nresponse’ mode can also create wellbeing impacts on\nstaff members, as illustrated in this case by the level\nof stress and fatigue experienced by staff members\ndealing with both the COVID-19 and concurrent cyber\nattack crises.[237] Chronic stress without recovery,\ndepletes energy reserves, leads to burnout and\nultimately compromises the crisis response capability.\nThis can subsequently compound the inability to act\nand lead clearly, and therefore has the potential to\nfurther increase the risk of patient safety incidents\nand clinical errors as well as further risk of harm\nto staff. Staff who had been deployed during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic reported returning to their roles\nfeeling fatigued before the ransomware attack; the\nconcurrent crises were unlike anything they had ever\nencountered and the response was heavily fuelled by\nstaff members’ ‘can-do attitude’.[238]\n\n**FA2.KR10 Instil a culture of preparedness in the**\n**HSE to reduce the negative impacts of disruption**\n**on its people (see strategic recommendation 4.2**\n**_in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should aim to create a culture that values\nand emphasises crisis preparedness as well as\nhaving confidence in natural ability to respond to\nmajor emergencies. In addition to scenario-specific\nplans to prepare for crisis scenarios (beyond the\ncurrent scope of floods, adverse weather and aviation\ndisasters) recommended below (see also findings\n_FA2.KF8 and FA2.KF21), the HSE should implement_\na comprehensive training and exercising programme\nto familiarise all crisis responders at operational (e.g.\nhospital/CHO, business support services, IT Security,\n\n\n228 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n229 Site Workshop 5 (Hospital F)\n230 Site Workshop 6 (Hospital C)\n231 Site Workshop 1 (CHO B)\n232 Site Workshop 2 (CHO A)\n233 Site Workshop 4 (Hospital E)\n234 Site Workshop 6 (Hospital C)\n235 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n236 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n237 Programme RAID Log\n238 Healy, O.

Conducting scenario-_\nbased desktop and simulation exercises will expose\nindividuals to the (simulated) pressures they will\nexperience, thereby reducing the negative impact\nimposed by external stressors and uncertainty in\nreal life events. Transferring the skills gained in\npsychologically realistic exercises will facilitate more\neffective teamwork and decision making in actual\ncrisis situations when they occur.\n\n###### Crisis Response\n\n Area 7: Notification and activation of NCMT and wider response workstreams\n\n**FA2.KF11 Core senior responders were notified**\n**and the NCMT invoked quickly; however, the**\n**notification of staff and wider stakeholders was ad**\n**hoc and did not follow a pre-planned notification**\n**process or channel**\n\nCore senior responders were notified quickly using\nbest endeavours via phone on the morning of the\nattack, and the first NCMT meeting was held at\n08:30 on the day of the Incident.[239] An initial ‘blast’\nnotification was also issued to HSE mobile devices at\n14:00[240] via Vodafone and Three network providers[241],\nin an effort to inform wider HSE staff of the Incident.\nHowever, there was no evidence to show this\nprocess was formally prescribed and embedded\nin the Incident Management Framework,[242] Major\nEmergency Framework[243] or a Crisis Communications\nPlan, nor was it aligned to an incident severity matrix\nto ensure the correct level of response was activated\nand involved (see also finding FA2.KF14). It was noted\nduring interviews with several stakeholders, and in\nthe Lessons Learned Log that receipt of the initial\nnotification text was ad hoc and did not reach all HSE\nstaff members and contractors.[244, 245, 246] This was in\n\n\npart because the recipient list did not include staff\nmembers or contractors on non-HSE devices.\n\nInterviewees noted that as a result of the ad hoc\nnotification process, some staff members and\ncontractors first heard of the attack on the local news,\nor by experiencing the effects of the ransomware\nattack first hand. Others received multiple notices\nfrom various parties (including impacted hospitals)\nand through multiple channels, while some never\nreceived an initial notification.[247]\n\n**FA2.KR11 Design and implement an integrated**\n**notification and escalation process and acquire**\n**a means of mass notification to all HSE staff and**\n**contractors (see tactical recommendation 3.1 in**\n**_section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should implement a uniform and integrated\nnotification and escalation process within the\nupdated end-to-end response framework, supported\nby an Incident Classification and Severity Matrix\nand an ‘Activation Membership’ list detailing the\nstakeholders to be informed, across all levels of\nresponse, depending on the severity rating of that\nincident. This will allow critical responders to be\nnotified of an event and convene at pace to instigate\na response at the appropriate level to any incident or\ncrisis impacting its operations or services.\n\nThe HSE should review whether the use of mobile\nphone network providers as a method of sending\n‘blast notifications’ meets the required functionality\nfor mass notification and, if not, should consider\ninvesting in a mass emergency notification and\ncommunications tool to improve its wider incident\nnotification capability. The solution should include\nfeatures for notifying all HSE staff members and\ncontractors or smaller groups of staff about any\nserious incident, crisis or clinical and services\ncontinuity event (e.g., a data leak where formal\nnotification and information needs to be disclosed\nwith impacted persons, physical or medical events\nrequiring safety instructions to be issued, or a total\nsystem outage/ransomware attack). Clear authority\nshould be designated to an individual or individuals\nwith an appropriate level of authority to send\ncommunications from this platform, to ensure all\nmessages are consistent and have been signed off by\nthe appropriate parties (e.g. legal).\n\n\n239 Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance and Admin V1.10 31052021\n240 Minutes of Cyber Attack MI Meeting 12 pm - 14052021\n241 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n242 Incident Management Framework 2020\n243 A-Framework-For-Major-Emergency-Management\n244 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n245 Site Workshop 2 (CHO A)\n246 Site Workshop 5 (Hospital F)\n247 Site Workshop 4 (Hospital E)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Area 8: Response structures, resourcing and logistics\n\n**FA2.KF12 The HSE did not follow a pre-defined**\n**and consistent crisis management structure in the**\n**initial phase of the response**\n\nAlthough the HSE ultimately established an effective\ncrisis management structure during their response to\nthe ransomware attack, it was designed reactively to\napply to this specific incident.\n\nThe first NCMT meeting was convened less than\nfour hours after the IT Critical Incident Process was\ninvoked,[248] in part due to the familiarity of operating\nNCMT established during the COVID-19 response.[249]\nWhile invocation was prompt, several stakeholders\nnoted that the initial supporting structures feeding\ninto the NCMT were inconsistent and at times\nconflicted.[250] Both the Regional CMTs[251] and the Area\nCMTs[252] were initially stood up based on different\ndocumentation, and subsequently stood down when\nalternate response governance structures, linking\ndirectly to the HGs and CHOs, were agreed.\n\nTechnology-focused response and recovery\nworkstreams were established in parallel to the CMTs\nbut were not reflected in any of the initial Emergency\nResponse or Incident Management documentation.\nAdditionally, a clinical and integrated governance\nstructure (which later became the integrated clinical\nand operational risk subgroup of the NCMT) was set\nup to capture risks, guide the operational response\nbased on clinical priority, and in an effort to establish\nclear communications between clinical operations\nand IT. This was a critical group that ultimately\ninfluenced the prioritisation of the recovery of the IT\nsystems to enable the resumption of clinical services\nStakeholders noted that the legal workstream had\nnot been considered as a required workstream\nfor an emergency or incident response prior to\nthe attack. Finally, it was identified in the Lessons\n_Learned Programme Log that central reporting_\nwas difficult due to the way individual workstreams\nwere established in silos and without clear central\nguidance (see also finding FA2.KF18).[253]\n\n\nThe lack of integrated programme management\nwas recognised as a risk by the HSE five days into\nthe response.[254] This led to a request for assistance\nfrom the Defence Forces who established defined\ninformation management processes which were\n‘scalable and agile’[255] and could cope with the\ncomplexity of a cyber crisis. Stakeholders interviewed\nnoted a recurring sentiment that the Defence Forces’\nintervention was critical in allowing the HSE to\nestablish tighter governance, better communication\nflows and create mental space for responders to\nfocus on remediation and recovery activities.[256, 257]\n\n**FA2.KR12 Establish a Crisis Situation Centre to**\n**manage an organisation-wide response to a crisis**\n**_(see recommendation FA2.KR5.1 and strategic_**\n**_recommendation 4.2 in Section 4)_**\n\nAs part of the Crisis Management Framework (see\n_recommendation FA2.KR5.1), the HSE should_\nestablish a Crisis Situation Centre construct to\nbe stood up during a crisis response. This should\nincorporate the learnings from the Situation\nCentre introduced by the Defence Forces during\nthe Conti response and include the following\nelements:Guidance on how and when it should be\ninvoked in line with the Incident Classification and\nSeverity Matrix (see also recommendation FA2.KR14);\n\n**•** Guidance on how and when it should be invoked\nin line with the Incident Classification and Severity\nMatrix (see also recommendation FA2.KR14);\n\n**•** The hierarchy of teams required;\n\n**•** Roles and responsibilities and delineated decision\nauthority of each response level;\n\n**•** Escalation thresholds and formalised\ncommunication channels;\n\n**•** Agreed touchpoints and interaction between the\nSituation Centre and HGs and CHOs;\n\n**•** Tools and templates to be used by all responders\n(across the HSE, HG and CHO levels) during an\nincident (e.g., situation report, classification and\nseverity matrix, impact assessment, decision and\naction logs).\n\n\n248 Conti Cyber Response NCMT Structures Governance and Admin V1.10 31052021\n249 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n250 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2; Information Management and Coordination Workshop\n251 Emergency Management Services Delivery Plan 2019 - Regional CMTs\n252 HSE EM Interim Governance Arrangements Jan 2020 - ACMTs\n253 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n254 Programme RAID Log\n255 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n256 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n257 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n\n\n-----\n\n**FA2.KF13 There was lack of oversight and**\n**structure to the coordination and integration of**\n**third party support**\n\nThe HSE recognised the need for additional resources\nand specialist skills and engaged third parties for\nincident response,[258, 259] legal and forensics support\nearly on. The impact of the Incident on a national\nscale encouraged goodwill from third party support\nand vendors, including the provision of pro bono\nwork. The HSE was aware of the reliance they were\nplacing on third parties and set objectives for each, to\nensure they did not undertake activities beyond the\nrequired time period. The HSE also took ownership\nof tasks when sufficient progress was made and the\ninternal resources became available.\n\nIt was noted in interviews that a significant amount\nof time was spent onboarding and integrating\nthird parties, particularly educating them on the\nintricacies of the health sector and for example,\ndifferences between voluntary and statutory\nhospitals.[260] Stakeholders also noted that data\ngathering activities were duplicated because HSE\nstaff did not have visibility of third party activity or\nmiscommunication between third parties and internal\nteams. This diverted focus from other efforts during\nthe critical early stages of the response. The visual\nrepresentation of each team’s priorities at CityWest\nseveral days into the response addressed some of\nthese issues, as it allowed responders to deconflict\ntheir activities and re-engineer their approach where\nrequired.\n\n**FA2.KR13 Establish formal retainers with key third**\n**parties that may be required to support a crisis**\n**response (see tactical recommendation 3.3 in**\n**_Section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should consider the third party support\nthat may be required during an incident, including:\ncrisis response, external legal counsel and public\nrelations. These retainers should include service\nlevel agreements, clear descriptions of third party\nroles and responsibilities, and pre-agreed legal\nrequirements (such as non-disclosure agreements) to\nensure partners can be engaged to support, and be\nintegrated into, a response immediately and scale to\nthe size of the response required.\n\n\nWork should be conducted with third parties\nproviding technical support to familiarise them with\nthe HSE’s IT network, architecture and systems, to\nfacilitate quicker engagement during an incident.\nThe role of retained third parties should be reflected\nin response plans or playbooks and they should be\ninvolved in regular cross-organisation conversations\nand training exercises with the HSE, the HGs\nand CHOs to rehearse efficient coordination and\ncommunication flows.\n\n###### Area 9: Information and data management in a crisis\n\n**FA2.KF14 The initial impact assessment was**\n**hindered due to the absence of an HSE-wide**\n**incident severity matrix**\n\nThere was no integrated HSE-wide Incident\nClassification and Severity Matrix to guide the initial\nimpact assessment following the attack. The ‘HSE\nRisk Impact Table’ in the HSE Incident Management\n_Framework lists five impact levels from Negligible to_\nExtreme across eight different categories.[261] While\nthose categories reflect a spectrum of operational,\nfinancial, compliance and reputational impacts, there\nwas no evidence to indicate that the initial impact\nassessment conducted during the ransomware attack\nwas based on this guidance and subsequently used\nto inform decisions made and actions taken. There\nwas also no evidence provided of an Incident Severity\nMatrix for IT or cyber incidents, specifically.\n\nThe Managing a Major Incident document is designed\nto be used in a ‘critical’ incident that attracts ‘more\n_attention or has a greater impact than “normal” critical_\n_incidents’; [262] however, there were no associated_\ndefinitions for those thresholds. It was also unclear\nhow the impact assessment from an IT incident\nwould be aligned with that of the ‘HSE Risk Impact\nTable’. In the absence of an integrated HSE-wide\nIncident Classification and Severity Matrix (see also\n_finding FA2.KF12), response teams did not have_\nclear thresholds and criteria to assess the (actual\nand potential) business, operational, financial and\nreputational impacts of the cyber incident. As a result,\nthe initial response centred on understanding ‘the\nwhat’, rather than quantifying the impact to inform\nand set the strategic response strategy for effective\ndecision making.\n\n\n258 M_HSE_Intrusion Investigation Report - REDACTED (FINAL).pdf, 2021\n259 Minutes of Cyber Attack MI Meeting 10 am - 14052021\n260 Site Workshop 9 (Hospital H)\n261 HSE-2020-incident-management-framework-guidance\n262 Managing a Major Incident v1 1 and IT Security Incident Plan\n\n\n-----\n\n**FA2.KR14 Develop an integrated HSE-wide**\n**incident classification and severity matrix for**\n**assessing the organisational impact of an incident**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should ensure it includes clear criteria to\ndetermine the level of actual and/or potential likely\nimpacts of the Incident, and align with or supersede\nthe ‘HSE Risk Impact Table’.[263] It should consider\nspecific impact categories - operational, clinical,\nreputational, financial, regulatory/legal - and a method\nfor estimating impact based on impact and likelihood.\n\nThis should be embedded across all organisational\nresponse plans and align with any technical severity\nmatrices, such as those in a technical cyber response\nplan, to support consistency in response. This will\nensure responders are using a consistent approach to\nanticipating immediate, ongoing and future impacts\nto support a shared situational awareness.\n\n**FA2.KF15 The lack of pre-defined information**\n**sharing processes led to inefficiencies in the**\n**creation of a shared understanding of the Incident**\n\nAs mentioned in finding FA2.KF12, the tools and\nprocesses introduced by the Defence Forces on\n18 May, enabled a more efficient meeting tempo\nand information management. Information sharing\nchannels with HGs and CHOs via nominated liaison\nofficers and coordinators subsequently also took\nshape.[264]\n\nSeveral stakeholders noted that the sheer number\nof coordination and information sharing meetings\nrequired placed a strain on several critical HSE\nstakeholders, who struggled to attend all meetings\nand/or action response and recovery tasks.[265]\nInterviewees from several HGs and CHOs also\nreported that some initial meetings with the HSE\nwere time consuming, oversubscribed and, at times,\ndifficult to follow.[266] A recurring theme was that\ntechnical jargon generated confusion and delayed\ndecisions and actions. The lack of in-report standards\nand a clear definition of what constituted ‘Red’,\n‘Amber’ and ‘Green’ also led to initial confusion.[267]\n\nThere were instances when HGs and CHOs sent\nrequests for clarification and further support, but did\nnot receive a response and were unclear about how\nto proceed.[268] Similarly, some hospital stakeholders\n\n\ncited an example where ICT staff had been deployed\nto their site to clean laptops, but the hospital\nleadership were unaware that they were present and\nwere still trying to work with the HSE to organise their\nattendance.[269] These differing understandings may\nalso have been compounded by use of unapproved\nor informal channels for communicating with\nstakeholders; for example many interviewees noted\nthey resorted to individualised phone calls, WhatsApp\nand text messages to relay or obtain information first\nhand where relationships existed.[270, 271]\n\n**FA2.KR15 Designate and train incident information**\n**managers (or coordinators) at all levels across**\n**an incident or crisis response to maintain a**\n**consistent overview of the situation as it develops**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nFurther to recommendation FA2.KR12, the HSE\nshould ensure that each workstream beneath the\nSITCEN, at every command level and workstream,\nhas an information manager (or coordinator)\nappointed as part of the Incident response team.\nThis role should be implemented in all local hospital\nresponse teams, Regional/Area CMTs, and within\neach HSE workstream up to the NCMT. As the\ninformation manager completes their expected role\n(digesting all information to gain a view of the endto-end incident), they should escalate their status\nand update upwards (as with the SITREPs). This will\nallow the SITCEN information manager to articulate\none consolidated account of events, decisions and\nactions which will achieve situational awareness\nacross all teams and parties involved.\n\nTo embed this capability the HSE should train those\nwho have been assigned the role of information\nmanager/coordinator and complete multi-team\nexercises to rehearse information sharing between\nteams to maintain situational awareness. Templates\ncreated as a result of the ransomware attack should\nbe further developed and embedded into scenariospecific response plans, in order to support the\ninformation managers in their role. This structure and\nformat should be used in all teams and work streams\nto maintain consistency.\n\n\n263 HSE-2020-incident-management-framework-guidance\n264 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n265 Programme RAID log\n266 Programme RAID log\n267 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n268 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n269 Site Workshop 7 (Hospital G- identifier to be removed from final report)\n270 Site Workshop 1 (CHO B)\n271 Site Workshop 10 (Hospital I)\n\n\n-----\n\n**FA2.KF16 There was no pre-agreed ‘out-of-band’**\n**technology solution to support coordination,**\n**collaboration and information sharing during a**\n**crisis response**\n\nThe HSE’s communications and information sharing\nplatforms were severely impacted by the attack. A\npatchwork of technology solutions were brought\ntogether to address this gap. The NCSC introduced\n\n      - a secure online chat and file sharing\nplatform - to support the HSE in coordinating and\ncollaborating during the initial incident response. The\nHSE set up ‘clean’ email accounts for a handful of\nkey responders on a new HSEmail.ie domain[272] and\nleadership issued a special derogation and guidelines\nfor HSE staff to use personal emails for information\nsharing.[273]\n\nThe Defence Force SITCEN Information Manager\nestablished a directory and information sharing\nstructure on a Teams instance to facilitate centralised\ncoordination, collaboration and information sharing;\nhowever, it was noted that not all workstreams were\nstoring their documentation in the Teams instance.[274]\n\nMore widely, HSE staff defaulted to the use of\nWhatsApp, text message and phone calls to share\ninformation. Stakeholders from HGs and CHOs also\nnoted in interviews that, in some instances, they\nprocured their own domains and IT infrastructure in\norder to communicate and share information.[275]\n\nThis ad hoc approach ultimately provided a means by\nwhich to share information; however, these solutions\nhad not been pre-agreed, risk assessed or authorised\nfor use by the HSE during ‘prepare’ phases prior\nto the Incident, nor were incident responders and\nstaff made aware before the Incident that they\nshould be used. As a result, the HSE, HGs and\nCHOs lacked a centralised and secure information\nsharing, collaboration and coordination platform from\nthe outset of the Incident. This impeded the initial\nresponse efforts, as well as leading to a long data\nremediation tail (see also finding FA2.KF23).\n\n272 RAID Log, HSEmail.ie was agreed on 17 May 2021\n273 Letter to all Staff - 1 on 26 May 2021\n274 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n275 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n276 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n277 Clinical Risk Group Workshop\n278 Site Workshop 4 (Hospital E)\n279 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n280 20210524-Morning Update Brief - FINAL\n281 20210525-Morning Update Brief - FINAL\n\n\n**FA2.KR16 Identify and acquire a secure and**\n**resilient ‘out-of-band’ technology solution to**\n**ensure an alternative means of information**\n**sharing and communication (see tactical**\n**_recommendation 3.1 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should ensure that the platform can\nfacilitate email, file sharing, call hosting and the\ndissemination of communications to all staff and\nsegmented audiences, and enable all responders to\nsee situations reports, actions and decisions logs\nand other information necessary to support a shared\nunderstanding of the Incident.\n\n###### Area 10: Response leadership, strategy setting and decision making\n\n**FA2.KF17 The overarching response strategy was**\n**underpinned by the core HSE value of patient**\n**care; however, the initial response was driven by**\n**technology priorities**\n\nIt was widely acknowledged by stakeholders that\nthe HSE’s prioritisation strategy in the first week of\nthe Incident was driven by the OES list, informed\nby regular communication between the HSE’s\nOoCIO and COO functions and input from the\nCCO.[276,277,278]Stakeholders noted that the response\nstrategy progressed to an approach that focused\non clinical risks and the recovery of end-to-end\nclinical services, underpinned by the core HSE\nvalue of patient care, following the co-location of all\nresponders to City West.[279]\n\nThe introduction of a ‘higher organisational intent’\ndirected at restoring systems that enable patient\ncare was formalised on day 11 of the response and\nreflected in the daily SITCEN meeting rhythm, which\nwere aligned to facilitate a service-led response\nstrategy.[280, 281] This service-led approach was then\nconsistently adopted and ensured patient care was\nat the heart of all decisions made. The HSE would\nhave benefited from taking this approach earlier in\nthe response to allow for a more efficient recovery\n\n\n-----\n\nprogramme, ultimately reducing impact on patient\ncare.\n\n**FA2.KR17 Ensure the ‘higher organisational intent’**\n**is aligned to the organisational values and drives**\n**the response and recovery strategy; review the**\n**strategy regularly throughout the response as the**\n**situation develops (see strategic recommendation**\n**_4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nIn this incident, the strategic priority was the\nrestoration and protection of systems underpinning\npatient care services. The HSE should ensure that\nall incident response strategies consider both the\ntechnical and business response priorities, and are\ninformed by the impacts and requirements of the\nhospitals, HGs and CHO.\n\nPatient care may not always be restricted to the\nmaintenance of healthcare systems; the possible\nimplications of patient data exposure should be\nconsidered in conjunction with discussions on patient\ncare, and incorporated into the HSE’s strategic intent\nduring a response. Consideration should be given\nto how this strategy is cascaded to all levels of the\norganisation, to direct the actions of the tactical and\noperational response teams (see finding FA2.KF19)\nand to inform the activities of third party support.\n\nThe response strategy should be reviewed regularly\nduring a response based on new information\nand circumstances to ensure it is still valid and\nappropriate. The development and implementation\nof a response strategy should be a key focus\nduring crisis exercising, as this will facilitate a single\nconsistent approach to response and recovery\nactivities.\n\n**FA2.KF18 There was a lack of clearly defined and**\n**delineated decision making authority between the**\n**HSE, HGs and CHOs in the case of an HSE-wide**\n**crisis**\n\nSeveral interviewees noted that there was no\nstrategic Crisis Management Plan or cyber response\nguide with a clearly defined and documented decision\nmaking process for senior leadership to follow, in the\nevent of a total IT outage or cyber crisis.[282]\n\n282 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n283 Site Workshop 6 (Hospital C)\n284 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n285 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n286 Incident Management Framework 2020\n287 Site Workshop 4 (Hospital E)\n288 Programme RAID Log\n289 Site Workshop 6 (Hospital C\n290 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n291 Site Workshop 11 (Hospital A)\n\n\nSenior HSE leadership exhibited agile, yet reactive,\ndecision making in the absence of guidance that\nwas driven by organisational values, and grounded in\njudgement and experience acquired from managing\nprevious crises (see also findings FA2.KF7 and FA2.\n_KF19). There was limited evidence of formal and_\ndocumented decision-making authorities between\nthe HSE, CHOs, HGs/hospitals during an HSE-wide\ncrisis (see also finding FA2.KF12). Existing service\nlevel agreements between these organisations did not\ninclude provision for these authorities,[283, 284, 285] and\nwhile the Incident Management Framework identifies\nthe need for decision-making authority, no specific\ndetails were provided.[286] Interviewees reported that\nthis led to some confusion at the beginning of the\nresponse.[287] The autonomy under which Voluntary\nhospitals operate makes centralised decision making\nmore complex if the restrictions, constraints and\npermissions around decision making authority are not\nformally agreed and documented in advance.\n\nFor example, some hospital stakeholders reported\nthat the unilateral HSE decision to disconnect\nnational systems did not take into consideration\nthe level of system dependencies between the\nHSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs, and potential risks\nassociated with rapid disconnection.[288] There was\nalso no evidence to indicate that the authority for\nthat decision was documented and agreed.[289290]\nConversely, some hospital and CHO stakeholders\nnoted that local decisions were taken contrary to HSE\nguidance when deemed in the hospital’s or CHO’s\nbest interest.[291]\n\n**FA2.KR18 Agree delineated decision making**\n**authority across all teams in the organisation**\n**likely to be involved in an organisation-wide**\n**incident (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in**\n**_section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should establish an organisational crisis\nmanagement structure, incorporating hospitals, HGs,\nCHOs and contracted third parties, which clearly\ndefines the decision making authority at each level.\nThis structure should be socialised and embedded as\npart of a regular training and exercising programme\nfor all responders (see finding FA2.KR8.3) to ensure it\nmeets the different priorities of all parties and remains\nfit for purpose.

Through interviews and workshops it\nwas evident that EMT members involved in media\nmessages displayed a consistent and informed\napproach, receiving support and coaching from the\nexperienced senior Communications team members\nbefore any public event.[292]\n\nIn contrast, the internal communications capability\nwas stretched to meet the demands of the Incident\n_(see also finding FA2.KF6). The absence of a_\ncomprehensive mass emergency notification and\ncommunications tool meant only staff with HSE\ndevices received the initial ‘blast’ messages (see\n_also findings FA2.KF6 and FA2.KF7). There was no_\npre-prepared method by which to communicate with\n\n\nstaff in a segmented manner, therefore there was\nno capability to target different messages to distinct\ngroups of staff. This was exacerbated by the vast\nand diffuse structure of the HSE, including multiple\ndisparate smaller community organisations. The\nInternal Communications team ultimately facilitated\na workaround whereby updates were published on\nthe publicly available HSE website, and staff were\ndirected via phone calls and social media to check for\nupdates.[293]\n\nStakeholders noted that improvements to the internal\ncommunications capability were made following\nWannaCry in 2017 - replacing the ‘antiquated’\nintranet with a new website - and the internal\nCommunications Team was formally established in\n2019; however, the capability is not adequate for\nresponding to crises of this magnitude.[294]\n\n**FA2.KR19 Familiarise the Internal Communications**\n**Team with the ‘out of band’ technology solution**\n**to enable focused and targeted communications**\n**during a crisis (see also recommendation FA2.KR16**\n**_and tactical recommendation 3.1 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should set up user accounts for all staff\nmembers pre-incident on the selected ‘out of band’\ncommunication platform to expedite transition to\nthe new platform during a system outage. Staff\nmembers should be familiarised with the platform\nand its functionality ahead of an incident. Details\nfor all alternative user accounts should be recorded\ncentrally and stored offline to ensure contact\ninformation for all staff members is readily available\nduring any disruption to the HSE’s standard\ncommunications channels. Crisis response and\ncommunications workstream leads should establish\ncascading contact trees to notify staff of an incident,\nto initiate the use of the out of band platform, and\nto enact specific channels for the discussion of\nresponse and recovery activities between core\nresponders. This will allow workstreams to maintain a\ncentral repository of useful information and act as an\naudit trail for post incident review and reporting.\n\n**FA2.KF20 Potential data exposure has heightened**\n**risk to patients and created long remediation**\n**requirements**\n\nThe HSE took several steps to manage the impact of\npotential data exposure following the cyber attack,\ndespite the absence of scenario-specific plans[295]\nand related workstream structures reflected in the\nMEM or IM Frameworks (see also findings FA2.KF5\n\n\n292 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n293 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n294 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n295 The Data Protection Breach Management Policy provides high level guidance but does not include specific steps for a ransomware\nscenario.\n\n\n-----\n\n_and FA2.KF12). They established the Legal and Data_\nWorkstream on the 19th of May to:\n\n**•** Oversee the response and investigation from a\nlegal and data protection perspective arising from\nthe cyber attack;\n\n**•** Maintain a consistent approach to data protection\nand legal actions to ensure all regulatory\nrequirements are met;\n\n**•** Support the Data Protection Officer (DPO) in\ncoordinating the data protection investigation\nand reporting to the Data Protection and\nCommission;[296]\n\n**•** Assist and report on the ongoing investigation of\nAn Garda Síochána[297]\n\nRelated decisions, such as informing the Data\nProtection Commission (DPC),[298]obtaining a court\norder to prevent the publication and sharing of stolen\ndata and setting up web monitoring services,[299] were\nactioned quickly to mitigate the potential impact of\ndata loss. A Legal and Data Steering Committee\nwas subsequently set up to oversee risk-based\ndecisions relating to the approach to, and threshold\nfor, breach notification to data subjects whose\ndata may have been compromised and the wider\npublic.[300] Third parties were also called on to support\nthis risk assessment. This work is ongoing and\nmay continue for an extended period of time as the\nHSE reviews and seeks to mitigate any risk to data\nsubjects’ rights and freedoms. While thresholds for\nnotification have been identified, the HSE is in the\nearly stages of scenario and resource planning of\nthe actual notification process, including the liaison\nwith the HSE Communications team on how these\nnotifications should be rolled out. As such the HSE\nhas not yet made any data subject notifications, and\nno standard resources or templates for notification\nexist, or have yet been tailored/created for this event.\nThe HSE continues to work closely with funded\nentities to understand the extent of the potential\ndata exposure and share their risk assessment\nmethodology for notification threshold.\n\n**FA2.KR20 Review processes, plans and resourcing**\n**for response to future potential data breaches**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should ensure the appropriate resources,\ntools and templates are created with sufficient\nadvance notice and time prior to notifying data\nsubjects of a breach. Having initial notification letters,\nFAQ’s, responses, and sufficiently trained resources\n\n\nto manage an influx of requests for information will be\ncritical to ensuring a successful roll out of notification\nif and when required. The HSE should also review\nand document the processes established during the\nresponse to support their future preparedness. They\nshould:\n\n**•** Complete the work of the Legal and Data\nWorkstream in response to the Incident. This\nincludes reconciling all medical data stored and\nmanaged through interim processes post the\nattack, including data stored on personal devices/\naccounts and in paper form;\n\n**•** Embed the Legal and Data Workstream in\nthe Crisis Management Framework (see also\n_recommendation FA2.KR5.1 and FA2.KR12);_\n\n**•** Update the existing Data Protection Breach\nManagement Policy to support the Legal and\nData Workstream in future responses, including\nthe data breach notification risk assessment;\n\n**•** Rehearse the workstream’s response both\nindividually and as part of wider HSE exercising\nprogramme (see also recommendation FA2.\n_KR8.3);_\n\n**•** Agree retainers with third parties for future web\nmonitoring services;\n\n**•** Ensure materials used to support the notification\nof data subjects, such as letters, FAQs and talking\npoints, are agreed with the Communications\nTeam;\n\n**•** Conduct resource planning for future notification\nprogrammes; for example, call centres to respond\nto the significant influx of incoming requests once\ndata subjects are notified.\n\n###### Area 12: Scenario planning\n\n**FA2.KF21 Scenario planning did not inform**\n**response and recovery strategies**\n\nStakeholders stated that, despite having dealt with a\nvast array of major emergencies, they felt ill-prepared\nfor dealing with an IT outage or cyber crisis of this\nscale, or a specific ransomware attack (see also\n_finding FA2.KF8). Specifically, individuals initially_\nstruggled to comprehend the scale and size of the\nIncident, and felt unable to foresee the contingent\n\n\n296 Terms of Reference - Cyber Attack Legal and Data Workstream Steering Group June 2021\n297 Terms of Reference - Cyber Attack Legal and Data Workstream Steering Group June 2021\n298 DPC Report 15 July 2021\n299 Data Protection Monitoring Process\n300 Terms of Reference - Cyber Attack Legal and Data Workstream Steering Group June 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nimpacts that may occur over time.[301] As with many\norganisations impacted by ransomware attacks, there\nwas initially a belief that the Incident would cause\nimpact for several days to weeks, before a realisation\ndawned that these types of events, and their longer\nterm impacts, play out over several weeks and\nmonths.\n\nThis uncertainty stemmed, in part, from a lack\nof any formal scenario planning process within\nthe existing Major Emergency Management and\nIncident Management Frameworks and pre-prepared\nscenario-specific playbooks. Scenario-specific\nplaybooks define the likely decisions and actions\nrequired of a senior team, given the potential risks\nand impacts of the scenario (see also finding FA2.\n_KF5). The existence of a cyber response plan or_\nransomware playbook would have supported the\nNCMT’s ability to foresee the likely impacts and\nconsequences of the Conti attack, combatting\nwhat one stakeholder described as ‘a failure of\nimagination’.\n\nThe HSE also does not have a formal overarching\nprocess or system to guide the use of scenario\nplanning during crisis response, in order to inform the\nresponse and recovery strategy during an incident,\nirrespective of the nature of that event. This would\ninvolve identifying potential triggers and escalators for\nthe worst, best and most likely scenarios; identifying\nconsequent likely impacts; and implementing\nmitigating measures. While some stakeholders noted\nthey were able to conduct hasty scenario planning\nduring the Incident, particularly when determining\npatient care workarounds, this was performed in an\nad hoc fashion at the hospital or CHO level.\n\n**FA2.KR21 Scenario planning should be informed**\n**by the risk register, the process embedded in**\n**the Crisis Management Plan, and the activity**\n**conducted throughout incident and crisis**\n**response (see strategic recommendation 4.2 in**\n**_section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should ensure that the risk register is\nused to drive the creation of severe but plausible\nscenarios against which the HSE should validate its\nresilience capability is validated. The process should\nbe extended to engage individuals from the HSE’s\nsenior leadership team, risk management, clinical and\nservices continuity and crisis management disciplines\nin regular scenario planning against the organisation’s\n\n\ntop risks.[302,303] This is best conducted in a workshop\nformat to identify potential political, economic,\nsociological, technical, legal and regulatory,\nenvironmental and organisational impacts related to\neach of the HSE’s top risks, and to then explore the\nworst, best and most likely scenarios for each.\n\nMitigating actions resulting from these workshops\nshould be assigned to an owner with the appropriate\nlevel of authority to facilitate organisational change\nwhere required, and tracked throughout their lifecycle\nto confirm they are completed to an acceptable\nlevel. These actions and all other outputs from these\nactivities should be used to inform preparation\nactivities across resilience disciplines, to ensure that\nplans, processes and structures are fit for purpose;\nand where applicable specific response plans to\nbe developed for the most plausible risks (see also\n_findings FA2.KR5.2)._\n\nScenario planning should be included in the Crisis\nManagement Plan to support HSE to prepare for\nlikely outcomes and mitigate subsequent impacts\nduring a response.\n\n###### Area 13: Effectiveness of workarounds\n\n**FA2.KF22 Emergency workarounds implemented**\n**across the HSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs were ad**\n**hoc and not always based on predefined solutions**\n**or processes, and have caused long remediation**\n**tails.**\n\nIt was widely reported that responders across the\nHSE, HGs/hospitals and CHOs implemented timely\nand agile workarounds that allowed core critical\nprocesses to continue in the absence of IT.[304, 305] 306\nThe lack of preparedness for a cyber incident of this\nscale, including a lack of Clinical and Services Impact\nAnalysis and scenario-specific playbooks for cyber\nresponse, meant that whilst many workarounds were\npre-agreed and rehearsed, others were defined in an\nad hoc manner; as there was no systematic approach\nto maintaining continuity of patient-critical processes\n_(see also findings FA2.KF3, FA2.KF4 and FA2.KF23)._\n\nIn some cases, predefined workarounds were familiar\nto responders and well-rehearsed, for example, where\nclinicians were able to switch from digital to paper\n\n301 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n302 The CRR should inform the development of severe but plausible scenarios against which Crisis Management Teams are exercised.\nThe timing, nature and extent of testing should reflect the criticality of the underlying recovery solution / activity\n303 CRR Q1 2021 Review Report Final post EMT meeting 27 04 21 v1.0 27 04 21\n304 Site Workshop 6 (Hospital C)\n305 Communications & Stakeholder Management Workshop\n306 Information Management & Coordination Workshop\n\n\n-----\n\nbased procedures.[307] However, several stakeholders\nnoted that the workarounds were primarily designed\nfor individual systems or processes and proved to be\ntime limited, thereby not suitable for continued use\nthroughout the recovery from a total and lasting IT\noutage. Additionally, whilst staff in community service\nenvironments had experience relying on paper patient\ncharts and were able to adapt quickly, the after action\nreview (AAR) collated by the HSE identified that some\nstaff (clinical and non-clinical) had never worked\nin a paper-based system and so risked missing\nrelevant information from the different format used\nin paper documentation.[308] This introduced a risk of\ninformation loss if it was not ultimately uploaded into\nthe patient data management system.\n\nOther workarounds, although creative, were devised\nduring the Incident and, as a result, had not been\nreviewed from an overarching security or risk\nperspective. Many workarounds were documented\nas issues in the Programme RAID Log,[309] such as the\nuse of runners to convey lab samples and test results,\nand the use of whiteboards and shared excel sheets\non standalone laptops to populate hospital bed\nbureaus, due to the increased risk of human error.\nThe risks associated with the continuation of clinical\ntreatment and the use of operational workarounds\nwere assessed and communicated on a regular basis,\nincluding clinical guidance on how treatments should\nbe prioritised and managed.[310, 311] Many of these\nworkarounds carried a risk of loss or contamination of\npatient data, misplacement of patients and incorrect\ndisclosure of patient data, all with a secondary risk of\npatient care being negatively impacted. One example\nquoted during interviews that illustrates the lack of\naccurate patient data, was of a surgeon questioning\nthe whereabouts of a patient due for surgery, when\nthat patient had already been operated on.\n\nSeveral of the emergency workarounds established\nto support information sharing and allow individuals\nand teams to respond at pace, such as the use of\npersonal emails and devices, WhatsApp and paper\nrecords, have resulted in an ongoing data remediation\nrisk. Many stakeholders noted that some of the\nworkarounds implemented were not designed with\nconsideration of the need to consolidate and retrofit\ndata when systems were restored.[312, 313] Whilst some\ninterviewees noted they had hired extra resources\nto manually enter paper-based clinical information\nto restored systems, the absence of IT systems has\n\n\nresulted in large volumes of paper records, some\nof which are likely to include duplicate, incomplete\nor incorrect data that will need to be investigated\nand remediated. The backload of COVID-19 data\nin conjunction with the clinical data from the\nransomware attack will likely take considerable time,\npeople and resources to rectify.\n\nThe HSE issued a communication on 12 August 2021\nto stand down the use of personal emails and ensure\nall data was deleted from local storage areas.[314]\nHowever, some stakeholders from hospitals and\nCHOs reported they have not received clear guidance\non the steps required to address this risk. The\nabsence of an assigned owner for the remediation of\nclinical data will make it difficult for staff members to\ndirect enquiries relating to correct data handling and\nremediation, resulting in delayed resolution of the\nissue.\n\n**FA2.KR22.1 Design clinical and services**\n**continuity workarounds, informed by the Clinical**\n**and Services Impact Analysis (see strategic**\n**_recommendation 4.1 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should design and agree clinical and\nservices continuity workarounds, for critical\nprocesses, with the agility and governance to be\nmaintained for a prolonged period, and based on\nthe Clinical and Services Impact Analysis (see also\n_recommendations FA2.KR3.1, FA2.KR4 and FA2._\n_KR23)._\n\n**FA2.KR22.2 Design workarounds to support rapid**\n**data remediation post-incident or crisis (see**\n**_tactical recommendation 1.2 in section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should:\n\n**•** Establish a pre-agreed out of band\ncommunications and information sharing\nplatform (see also finding FA2.KR16) to ensure\ndata generated by workarounds outside normal\noperations is captured in a format that can easily\nbe retrofitted with the information held on HSE\nsystems.

This\nis extremely important as it helps identify likely and\npotential impacts to the organisation and responders.\nThese may often need a team and significant\ninvestment to resolve, however even the discussion\nand establishment of hypothetical workarounds will\nlikely reduce the number of ineffective emergency\nprotocols and allow space for creative thinking to\nconsider the ideal solution for all parties involved (see\n_also recommendation FA2.KR8.3)._\n\n**FA2.KR22.4 Consider a review to establish the**\n**longer term clinical impacts of the Conti attack**\n**_(see strategic recommendation 4.2 in section 4)_**\n\nFinally, the HSE should consider conducting a review\nto understand the longer term clinical impacts that\nresulted from the Conti attack. This review should\nbuild on the findings of the draft research report into\nthe effectiveness of the patient safety risk mitigation\nstrategies following the Incident,[315] and inform future\nsteps to improve the HSE resilience against potential\nfuture attacks and minimise the risk to patient care.\n\n###### Crisis Recovery\n\n Area 14: Services and data led recovery strategy\n\n**FA2.KF23 The lack of a comprehensive, current**\n**and accessible Clinical and Services Impact**\n**Analysis, Configuration Management Database,**\n**and asset register delayed recovery efforts**\n\nWhilst the HSE were clear in their intent to prioritise\npatient care and maintain its OES list, without an\nup to date clinical and services Impact Analysis\nor configuration management database (CMDB)\nresponse teams were initially unable to assess\nresource requirements and prioritise the recovery of\ncritical services.\n\n\nAs part of the incident response, the HSE established\na data workstream to build an understanding of all\napplications and their dependencies for recovery,\ncollating data from unaffected systems, existing\ndocumentation and undocumented knowledge from\nHSE staff and supporting vendors. The requirement\nto build this list and then prioritise applications for\nrecovery during the Incident, rather than being able\nto rely on an (offline and accessible) pre-prepared\nClinical and Services Impact Analysis, Configuration\nManagement Database and asset register, delayed\nrecovery efforts. The HSE also noted in their Lessons\n_Learned Log that the complexity and disparate_\nownership of the HSE IT combined with the lack of an\noverarching impact assessment (see also finding FA2.\n_KF14), made it difficult to plan the recovery efforts.[316]_\n\nThe recovery priorities set centrally by the HSE\ninitially focused on the priority restoration of core\nnational applications, e.g., NIMIS.[317] While this\napproach was widely agreed, the subsequent\nprioritisation of the smaller and more disparate\napplications, particularly at the hospital and CHO\nlevel, was less straightforward. Stakeholders noted\nthat following the restoration of core national\napplications, some peripheral applications used by\nCHOs (such as ) to communicate with\npatients and carers, were not prioritised adequately\ngiven their place underpinning critical CHO services,\ndue to a lack of perceived importance.\n\nServices were prioritised into three classifications:\ncategory A (national core applications), category B\n(major clinical applications) and category C (priority\napplications).[318] Applications moved between\nthese categories throughout the response based\non recommendations made during the daily Major\nIncident meetings. Responders attempted to prioritise\nsystems based on the effectiveness of workarounds,\nand how long they could be maintained. However,\nthis approach did not consider the connections\nbetween systems requiring restoration. A recurring\nfinding was that several applications reported to\nbe ‘green’ were not yet functional at the time of\nreporting, due to a lack of data on the dependencies\nbetween impacted infrastructure, applications and\ndata. One example of this is when access to IPMS\nwas initially blocked by delays in the restoration\nof Active Directory and Citrix,[319] a delay that took\nover two weeks to fix, postponing the resumption\nof business as usual services. The recovery of\nsystems requires the restoration of trusted network\nconnections and information exchanges, all of which\n\n\n315 Healy, O.

This should be informed\nby a service model for delivering patient care. The\nHSE should reconcile all medical data stored and\nmanaged through interim processes post the attack,\nincluding data stored on personal devices/accounts\nand in paper form (see also finding FA2.KR22.2).\n\nContingency plans should be developed by the\nbusiness owners and IT teams to maintain priority\nand critical services (as defined in a Clinical and\nServices Impact Analysis) during the disruption of\none or more key systems. These plans should be\nsocialised and embedded across the organisation,\nand a version of them stored offline, to ensure they\ncan be implemented effectively during an incident. In\nthe event of an incident impacting multiple systems,\nas within the Conti attack, recovery prioritisation\nshould be addressed on a regular basis from the\nbeginning of the response, to direct resources to the\nappropriate systems and services from the offset.\n\n**FA2.KF24 Recovery efforts were hindered by**\n**the lack of a predefined recovery process and**\n**targeted supporting resources**\n\nSeveral stakeholders noted that recovery efforts\nwere hindered by the lack of resources and inability\nto allocate them in the most efficient manner. As\nmentioned in finding FA2.KF3, without a Clinical and\nServices Impact Analysis to clearly articulate priorities\nand sequences of recovery, the HSE, HGs and\nCHOs were unable to create an informed recovery\n\n\nstrategy in the initial days. This, coupled with the\nabsence of information available on the HSE’s\nassets and services (see also finding FA2.KF23),\nmeant that technical teams relied on queries and\ninformation submitted to a central mailbox set up for\nthe response and on data gathered from vendors and\nsuppliers. The speed with which applications could\ntherefore be prioritised and communicated to the\ntechnical recovery teams was not therefore optimal.\n\nSpecifically, responders noted that the absence of\na predefined priority list and overall process flow\nmeant the Tech and Data Ops teams were at risk of\nunder- and over-utilisation due to workflow issues.[320]\nThis extended to third party support who relied on\ncentral coordination from the HSE to direct their\nrecovery efforts. There were missed opportunities\nto recover applications in parallel and technical\nresponders risked being redeployed onto other\nrecovery areas,[321] delaying or preventing their return\nto application restoration once a new set of priorities\nwas established. Indeed where responders were left\nwithout targeted guidance on what to restore they\nrelied on informal conversations to determine which\nteams were struggling, and directed their attention\nthere.\n\n**FA2.KR24 Map and document the people and**\n**technology resources and processes required**\n**to recover all critical systems in a pre-defined**\n**sequence (see tactical recommendation 1.3 in**\n**_Section 4)_**\n\nThe HSE should ensure that the Cyber Incident\nResponse Playbook[322] documents a pathway to\nrecovery that maps the people, processes and\ntechnology requirements of each system, to provide a\npathway to recovery in the event of single or multiple\nsystem failure. During a major outage or disruption,\nrecovery priorities should be agreed with central and\nlocal response and IT teams and communicated to all\nresponders to streamline the recovery of integrated\nand independent systems. Once recovery priorities\nhave been agreed, incident response mechanisms\nneed to be invoked that provide the most effective\ncommunication and coordination between teams.\n\nCentral coordination meetings should be held with\nthe asset and application register acting as a tool to\nguide recovery activities. A read-only, and regularly\nupdated, list of prioritised applications should be\nmade available to all technical recovery teams to\ndirect their activities and keep them informed of the\nactions being undertaken across the response.\n\n\n320 Lessons Learned_ Programme Lessons v0.2\n321 Programme RAID Log\n322 Recommendation FA1: 4.1.1, Focus area 1- Technical investigation and response report\n\n\n-----\n\nTo achieve this an operational rhythm needs to be\nestablished by:\n\n**•** Setting up a meeting cadence at and between\neach response level e.g., operational or “Bronze”\n(HG and CHO) meeting followed by a tactical or\n“Silver” (HSE) meeting, then a strategic or “Gold”\n(EMT) meeting to share a cascade of updates\nincreasing in importance, escalating priorities.[323]\nThis waterfall flow between the command levels\nshould also be used in reverse to share decisions\nand actions simultaneously to all teams and\nimpacted sites;\n\n**•** Each meeting following a set agenda to ensure\nall required areas are covered off, particularly in\nterms of situational awareness of the Incident;\n\n**•** Use of uniform templates for collecting incident\nupdates, action tracking and required decisions.\n\nIt is recommended that at each level of response\nthere is a dedicated role to ensure coordination within\nand between teams. This can be the role of a Crisis\nCoordinator or SITCEN Information Manager (see\nalso finding FA2.KF15).\n\n###### Focus area 2 conclusion\n\nDespite a lack of pre-prepared structures and\nprocesses, the HSE exhibited an agile and reactive\nresponse to the Conti ransomware attack in May\n2021. Prior learnings, behaviours and processes,\nmany of which were exercised during the COVID-19\nresponse, were leveraged to ensure critical systems\nand processes were recovered, and to deliver safety\ncritical patient care across the country. The lengths\nto which staff and vendors went to keep patients\nsafe and facilitate a recovery within the operating\nconstraints is a direct reflection of the leadership that\nwas employed during this crisis. The behaviours,\nstructures and processes designed reactively during\nthe response to the attack should be leveraged and\nembedded into new crisis structures, to ensure the\nHSE is better able to respond at pace to future risks\nwhen they materialise.\n\nIndividuals within the HSE have described it as an\norganisation constantly responding to crises. To date,\nthe HSE’s approach to preparedness for disruptive\nevents has been driven through the Major Emergency\nManagement Framework. Events previously in\nscope of the Framework can be categorised as short\nterm, national events caused by adverse weather\nor accidents, which created a temporary surge in\ndemand on the HSE’s clinical and acute services.\nThe normalisation of crisis events in the HSE has\n\n\ngenerated a sense of over confidence throughout\nthe organisation, whereby the forward planning has\nbecome restricted to contingencies for predictable or\nrecognisable threats and risks. Specifically, the HSE’s\ncrisis planning has been based on the assumption\nthat all critical infrastructure and processes would\nbe available to support a crisis response. There was\ntherefore no contingency planning for a cyber attack,\nor any other scenario involving the denial or loss of\ninfrastructure, people, or facilities.\n\nPrior to the cyber attack, outside of the Major\nEmergency Management Framework, there was no\nintegrated organisation-wide Crisis Management\nFramework in place to deal with a major internal\ncrisis event. In the absence of documented plans,\nthe HSE’s COVID-19 response imparted a degree\nof inherent preparedness, which manifested itself in\na flexible and agile response from all of its people\nacross all levels. However, the structures required\nto respond to the crisis caused by the ransomware\nattack were only achieved with assistance from the\nDefence Forces in the weeks following the attack.\nThe lack of pre-planned contingencies contributed\nto increased levels of stress and fatigue in HSE staff\nduring the initial stages of the response and recovery.\nThe HSE requires a Crisis Management Framework,\nwhich sits alongside the MEM Framework, but with a\nseparate focus on responding to crises which do not\nnecessitate an interagency response.\n\nClinical and services continuity has not been a\ncorporate priority in the HSE until recently, when\nenterprise risk management and clinical and services\ncontinuity were consolidated under the National\nDirector for Governance and Risk. Consequently\nthe level of clinical and services continuity and\ncrisis preparedness across the organisation varies\nsignificantly. Due to a historic lack of governance and\noversight, a fragmented and incoherent clinical and\nservices continuity capability has evolved across the\norganisation. This delayed the implementation of an\ninitial coherent response and recovery effort during\nthe Incident.\n\nThere are many learnings to be taken from any\nresponse to an incident this significant. The HSE\nmust expand upon initiatives already taken and\nimplement a coherent operational resilience\ncapability, including clinical and services continuity\nand crisis management, across the organisation. Key\nactions for the HSE to take to establish organisationwide preparedness to significant incidents and crises\ndisrupting its operations include:\n\n**•** Define the governance arrangements and\nstructures to ensure clear and ongoing oversight,\n\n\n323 “Gold, Silver, Bronze” is industry standard phraseology to refer to strategic/tactical/operational level decision making bodies in\nemergency and crisis management\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement, and reporting of the operational\nresilience disciplines, with a particular focus on\nimplementation and integration of the crisis and\nclinical and services continuity disciplines;\n\n**•** Establish the Crisis Management Framework,\ndetailing levels of response and supporting teams\nand processes to manage any significant incident\nor disruption impacting HSE operations;\n\n**•** Develop supporting crisis documentation,\nincluding strategic, tactical and operational\nplans, procedures, tools and templates; scenario\nspecific playbooks for pre-defined threats and\nrisks, supported by clearly defined clinical and\nservices continuity strategies, a resourcing\nassessment and cost base analysis of chosen\nsolutions;\n\n**•** Cascade the Framework, tools and templates\nthroughout the organisation, and to HGs and\nCHOs, to ensure a coherent and standardised\nresponse across all parties involved in a crisis\nresponse;\n\n**•** Embed crisis management and clinical and\nservices continuity across the organisation by\nestablishing a formalised HSE-wide training and\nexercising programme and schedule to develop\nawareness, familiarity, and competence for all\nstakeholders involved in incident response.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.3 Focus area 3 - preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber risks\n\n###### Focus area 1 Focus area 2 Focus area 3\n\nReview the organisation-wide\n\nReview the technical Review the preparedness of the\n\npreparedness and strategic\n\ninvestigation and response HSE to manage cyber risks\n\nresponse\n\nApproach to focus area 3\n\nKey findings and\nrecommendations\n\nConclusion\n\n###### Approach to focus area 3\n\nTo facilitate this review, PwC developed a PIR\nCybersecurity Framework for the HSE which was\nbased on the NIST CSF and the Information Systems\nAudit and Control Association Control Objectives for\nInformation and Related Technologies (COBIT). Both\nNIST CSF and COBIT are internationally recognised\nstandards that organisations frequently use to\nassess their information security capabilities and\nIT governance processes. The PIR Cybersecurity\nFramework incorporates NIST’s 5 key domains\nand 23 supporting sub-domains along with the\ngovernance aspects from COBIT.\n\n|Focus area 1|Col2|Focus area 2|Col4|Focus area 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Review the technical investigation and response||Review the organisation-wide preparedness and strategic response||Review the preparedness of the HSE to manage cyber risks|\n|||||Approach to focus area 3|\n|||||Key findings and recommendations|\n|||||Conclusion|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The PIR Cybersecurity Framework\n\nThe following table illustrates the 5 key domains of the PIR Cybersecurity Framework and their associated\ndefinitions:\n\n\n**Figure 14: The PIR domains and domain definitions**\n\n\n**The PIR Cybersecurity Framework**\n\n|Domain|Domain definition|Sub domains|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### Capability Maturity Model Integration\n\nEach domain and subdomain were allocated a rating\nin accordance with the definitions below. Ratings are\nbased on the Capability Maturity Model Integration\n\n\n(CMMI) cybersecurity process maturity. ISACA’s\nCMMI cyber maturity model helps CISO’s, CIO’s, and\nlarge organisations build cyber maturity, and manage\nenterprise cybersecurity resilience, readiness and\nprovide assurance to the Board.\n\n\n**Figure 15: ISACA CMMI cybersecurity process maturity ratings and associated descriptions**\n\n|Level|Maturity rating|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Key findings and recommendations\n\n\n**Figure 16: Focus area 3 summary of key findings and recommendations**\n\n\n###### HSE maturity assessment ratings\n\nUsing the PIR Cybersecurity Framework, PwC conducted interviews with key stakeholders and reviewed key\ndocuments from the HSE and relevant third parties. This provided PwC with sufficient evidence to enable each\nof the 23 sub-domains to be assessed against the CMMI model. Assessments were then averaged per their\ndomain and an overall maturity rating achieved.\n\nA summary of the maturity ratings by key domain is illustrated below. Our assessment demonstrated that the\nHSE is at an “initial’’ CMMI maturity stage across the 5 key domains. Cybersecurity and governance processes\nare predominantly ad hoc, informal, and not well organised. This represents a very low level of maturity for\ncybersecurity and is significantly behind where an organisation of its size and risk profile should be. It is our\nexperience that organisations with this level of maturity carry an unacceptable level of risk and frequently fall\nvictim to cyber attack, and often regulatory action. An organisation like the HSE should be aiming for a rating\nof at least 3 and higher. The HSE OoCIO has an ambition[324] to reach a maturity rating of between 2.6 and 3.5.\nConsiderable resources and investment will be required to achieve this ambition across all 5 NIST domains. It\nshould be noted that similar organisations that PwC has reviewed have ratings of between 2.6 to 2.95.\n\n\n**Figure 17: The assessment ratings of the key domains**\n\n\n324 Cybersecurity effectiveness assessment, IVI August 2018 (extract reported to the HSE Board November 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Identify - The rating reflects the immaturity in the understanding of cybersecurity within the HSE. There was a**\nlack of understanding of the business context, the resources that supported critical functions, and the related\ncybersecurity risks.\n\n**Protect - The rating is based on the lack of appropriate safeguards that should have ensured delivery of critical**\ninfrastructure services. A mature protect function would support the ability to limit or contain the impact of a\ncybersecurity event.\n\n**Detect - The rating reflects the absence of appropriate activities that were used to identify the occurrence**\nof the cybersecurity event. The incident indicates that the HSE lacked the ability for timely discovery of the\ncybersecurity event.\n\n**Respond - The rating indicates that the appropriate activities to act regarding a detected cybersecurity incident**\nwere lacking in the HSE. The impact of a cybersecurity incident was widespread and was only contained by\nshutting down the network.\n\n**Recover - The rating reflects the immaturity in maintaining plans for resilience and the restoration of any**\ncapabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident in a timely manner, in a way to reduce\nthe incident’s impact.\n\n###### Summary of NIST recommendations\n\nNote: Recommendations are categorised as immediate (starting immediately and completed within six months)\nand medium-term (with a phased plan for implementation to be developed and completed within 18 months).\n\n\n**Figure 18: Focus area 3 key NIST recommendations**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Summary of key findings and recommendations\n\nFrom our assessment, PwC has identified cybersecurity capability gaps in the form of findings and designed\ntactical and strategic recommendations for each domain and subdomain. A summary of key findings and their\ncorresponding recommendations are included below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 19: PIR Cybersecurity Framework**\n\n\n**The PIR Cybersecurity Framework**\n\n|NIST domain|Rating|NIST CSF category/ sub-domain|Key findings|Key recommendations|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n|The PIR Cybersecurity Framework|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|NIST domain|Rating|NIST CSF category/ sub-domain|Key findings|Key recommendations|\n\n\n-----\n\n|The PIR Cybersecurity Framework|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|NIST domain|Rating|NIST CSF category/ sub-domain|Key findings|Key recommendations|\n\n\n-----\n\n**The PIR Cybersecurity Framework**\n\n|NIST domain|Rating|NIST CSF category/ sub-domain|Key findings|Main recommendations|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n**The PIR Cybersecurity Framework**\n\n|NIST domain|Rating|NIST CSF category/ sub-domain|Key findings|Main recommendations|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### Focus area 3 conclusion\n\nPwC’s NIST and COBIT based assessment of cybersecurity capability within the HSE clearly indicates that the\norganisation is operating at a level of maturity that is reactive, ad-hoc and significantly below the level needed\nto afford a basic level of protection against the rapidly increasing level of cyber threats that the organisation\nfaces. Despite efforts and endeavours at the time of the Incident, the HSE was not well prepared to identify,\nunderstand, and respond to cybersecurity attacks. Significant gaps exist across all 5 NIST domains. The cyber\nattack was not detected prior to the ransomware execution, protective controls and technologies were not\nrobust enough to prevent the spread of the ransomware. Furthermore, the response and recovery was based\non ad hoc structures, including processes to identify and prioritise applications and systems to be recovered.\nConsiderable resources and sustained investment will be required to remediate the gaps across all 5 NIST\ndomains. However, the recommendations herein, which are both tactical and strategic, will support the HSE to\nsafeguard and protect against future cyber attacks and will also significantly improve its cybersecurity maturity\nratings across all 5 domains of NIST.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendices\n\n###### • A.

Scope of work\n\n**Our work comprised three focus areas as follows:**\n\n**•** Focus area 1: Review of the technical\ninvestigation and response to the Conti Incident\n\n**•** Focus area 2: Review the organisation-wide\npreparedness and strategic response\n\n**•** Focus area 3: Review the preparedness of the\nHSE to manage cyber risks\n\n###### Focus area 1\n\nIn this area, we reviewed the technical response\nto the Incident and the subsequent recovery and\ninvestigation activities undertaken by the HSE.\nKey considerations included the effectiveness of\nthe response and recovery, the sufficiency of the\ninvestigation to support the conclusions made, and\nthe ability of the HSE to detect and prevent similar\nincidents in the future. To achieve this we separated\nour review into nine phases - in each phase we did a\ndeep dive into specific areas of interest:\n\n**•** Review of relevant documentation including daily\nincident SITREPs, investigation reports, RAID logs\nand recovery plans;\n\n**•** Interviews with key stakeholders that were\ninvolved in the response, investigation and\nrecovery to understand key information, including\npreparedness, the timeline of events, roles and\nresponsibilities, and decision making;\n\n**•** Interviews with contacts at the HSE’s Incident\nResponse provider to review their technical reporting;\n\n**•** Interviews with technical teams to understand\nthe Cyber Security controls that were in place at\nthe time of Incident and assess these against our\nransomware vulnerability framework;\n\n**•** Review of documentation and interviews to\nunderstand HSE’s network and AD structure,\nincluding the architecture of the NHN;\n\n**•** A deep-dive into the recovery of specific\napplications and organisations, including\nstatutory hospitals, voluntary hospitals and CHOs,\nincluding the adequacy of disaster recovery\ncapabilities to contribute to operational readiness\nfor a cyber attack;\n\n**•** Review of Cyber Security improvements planned\nor implemented during the Incident to assess\nwhether they would likely prevent a similar\nIncident reoccurring.\n\n\n###### Focus Area 2\n\nIn this area, we reviewed the organisation-wide\npreparedness and strategic response to the Incident.\nThe work comprised three phases as follows: Crisis\nPreparedness, Crisis Response, and Crisis Recovery.\n\nThe first phase focused on Crisis Preparedness with\nthe following objectives:\n\n**•** Assess the governance in place at HSE for risk,\nclinical and services continuity, incident and crisis\nmanagement;\n\n**•** Assess whether robust emergency, incident and\ncrisis plans were in place prior to the Incident at\nstrategic, tactical and operational level with clear\nroles and responsibilities per team/stakeholder;\n\n**•** Assess whether robust BCM plans were in place\nprior to the Incident at strategic, tactical and\noperational level;\n\n**•** Assess whether crisis communications plans were\nin place at HSE and CHO/hospital (group) level;\n\n**•** Understand the level of security and crisis\nawareness, training and exercising pre-Incident;\n\n**•** Assess whether lessons learned from previous\nlarge scale incidents or emergencies (e.g nurses’\nstrike, COVID-19 response) were applied to the\nConti response.\n\nThe second phase focused on Crisis Response with\nthe following objectives:\n\n**•** Assess whether effective and organised response\nstructures were defined and implemented, when\nand by whom;\n\n**•** Identify whether an effective operating rhythm,\nmatching the pace of the crisis, was set and\nfollowed to ensure command, control and\ncoordination was continuously achieved\nthroughout the response;\n\n**•** Identify whether information and data was shared\neffectively across workstreams and up to the HSE\nNCMT to inform understanding of clinical and\noperational impacts;\n\n**•** Assess whether leadership established an agreed\noverarching response and recovery strategy,\nguided by clear values and response principles;\n\n**•** Assess whether decisions were made effectively\nbased on a situational assessment;\n\n**•** Understand the impact of the prevailing HSE\nemergency response culture on the crisis response.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third phase focused on Crisis Recovery with the\nfollowing objectives:\n\n**•** Assess whether leadership established a recovery\nstrategy/plan;\n\n**•** Assess whether recovery plan was aligned with\nexisting clinical and services continuity, disaster\nrecovery and risk management processes;\n\n**•** Assess whether business/corporate/clinical\npriorities drove recovery plan;\n\n**•** Determine the extent to which workarounds\nimplemented at local hospital, HGO and CHO\nlevel were appropriate; and how this ability was\nimpacted based on organisational preparedness\nand culture;\n\n**•** Understand the long term impacts of the event on\nclinical activities, operations and staff wellbeing;\n\n**•** Understand the planned changes in processes\nand culture driven by this event and how they\nalign with HSE’s organisational strategy.\n\n###### Focus area 3\n\nIn this area, we conducted a review of the HSE’s\ncurrent cyber security capabilities from a strategic\nand operational perspective. Our objective\nwas to determine the level of preparedness in\nthe HSE’s technical capability and operational\nresilience (including clinical and services continuity\nmanagement planning) in terms of managing\ncybersecurity risk. To do this, we:\n\n**•** Examined the appropriateness of any technical\ncontrols implemented and the likelihood\nthey would prevent this or a similar Incident\nreoccurring. Specifically, in the area of Identity\nand Access Management, Data Protection and\nContent Control;\n\n**•** Assessed IT response in terms of how it\nempowered the organisation-wide response and,\nthe structuring and management of the recovery\nof applications supporting key patient care\nservices in the HSE, hospitals, and CHOs;\n\n**•** Assessed if lessons learnt have been\nimplemented from this and other incidents, and\nhave these been shared with State and non-State\norganisations to inform future preparedness;\n\n\n\n**•** Determined if there were organisational, cultural\nor behavioural root causes in the IT areas that\ncould be identified so that we could provide an\ninformed view on the improvements the HSE\nshould consider to improve its Cyber Security\nposture and prevent similar Incidents occurring\nagain.\n\n###### Scope exclusions\n\n**•** We did not perform validation of the\ndocumentation provided to us.\n\n**•** We did not conduct any testing of the operating\neffectiveness of controls.\n\n**•** During our historic review of the Incident and\nHSE’s structure, processes and infrastructure, the\nmaximum period we looked back is five years.\n\n**•** As the remediation work was ongoing during our\nreview, we analysed the activity that had taken\nplace up to 31 July 2021.\n\n**•** We have performed a cyber preparedness\nassessment based on PwC’s NIST CSF and\nCOBIT Frameworks. We conducted this review\nbased on the ten key areas we identified,\nusing the above Frameworks. We note that an\norganisation-wide NIST assessment has not been\nfully completed to date by the HSE.\n\n**•** We have not validated the work performed as\npart of any previous information security audits or\nrelated work on which the HSE historically made\ndecisions.\n\n**•** We have only reviewed how the HSE’s strategy\nwas informed by advice provided by third parties\nand how the HSE’s response strategy allowed\nfor effective coordination of third parties. We\nreviewed the effectiveness of third parties’\nresponse and recovery efforts.\n\n**•** While we have identified learnings from this\nIncident which may apply to other major risks\nand incidents that could cause major business\ndisruption to the HSE, we have not performed a\nfull evaluation of other risks that HSE may face.\n\n**•** While we have reviewed the HSE’s clinical\nand services continuity plans, structures and\nprocesses; the scope of our review did not\ninclude preparing a new clinical and services\ncontinuity plan.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### B.
