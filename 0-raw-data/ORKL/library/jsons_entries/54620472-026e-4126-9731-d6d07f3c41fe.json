Four of the domains\npurported to be genuine news outlets but were actually controlled by the IRGC and targeted\naudiences in the United States, to covertly influence United States policy and public opinion,\nin violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The remainder targeted\naudiences in other parts of the world. This seizure warrant follows an earlier seizure of 92\ndomains used by the IRGC for similar purposes.\n\n“Within the last month we have announced seizures of Iran’s weapons, fuel, and covert\ninfluence infrastructure,” said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National\nSecurity. “As long as Iran’s leaders are trying to destabilize the world through the state\n\n-----\n\nsponsorship of terrorism and the taking of hostages, we will continue to enforce U.S.\nsanctions and take other legal steps to counter them.”\n\n“Today's 29 seizures are another important step against Iran's worldwide disinformation\ncampaign,” said U.S. Attorney Anderson. “This work will continue. We cannot allow Iran's\nattachment to fake news to overtake our commitment to the rule of law.”\n\n“The FBI is aggressively investigating any evidence of foreign influence and the unlawful\nspread of disinformation by hostile nations. Today, we seized 27 additional domains that\nIran’s IRGC was illegally using in attempt to manipulate public opinion in other countries,\nincluding the United States,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair. “Thanks to our\nongoing collaboration with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the FBI was able to disrupt this\nIranian propaganda campaign and we will continue to pursue any attempts by foreign actors\nto spread disinformation in our country.”\n\nThe seizure warrant, issued on Nov. 3, 2020, describes how the 27 seized domain names\nwere being operated in violation of federal law. Control of the domains by the IRGC violated\nthe International Emergency and Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Iranian\nTransactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR), which prohibit U.S. persons from providing\nservices to the Government of Iran without a license. Further, the United States has found\nthat the IRGC has provided material support to a number of terrorist groups, including\nHizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban. As such, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (OFAC) added the IRGC to its list of Specially Designated Nationals,\nimposing additional licensing requirements. As described in the seizure documents, the 27\ndomains were registered with U.S.-based domain registrars and used top-level domains\nowned by U.S.-based registries. Neither the IRGC nor the Government of Iran obtained a\nlicense from OFAC prior to using the domain names and obtaining services from the U.S.\nproviders.\n\nIn addition, four of the 27 domain names, “rpfront.com,” “ahtribune.com,” “awdnews.com,”\nand “criticalstudies.org,” were also seized pursuant to FARA. FARA establishes a\nregistration, reporting, and disclosure regime for agents of foreign principals (including\nforeign governments and their agencies) so that the U.S. government and the people of the\nUnited States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons\nattempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and law.\n\nFARA requires, among other things, that persons subject to its requirements submit periodic\nregistration statements containing truthful information about their activities and the income\nearned from them. Disclosure of the required information allows the federal government and\nthe American people to evaluate the statements and activities of such persons in light of their\nfunction as foreign agents. Here, the four domains purported to be independent news\noutlets, but they were actually operated by or on behalf of the IRGC to target the United\nStates with pro-Iranian propaganda in an attempt to covertly influence the American people\nto change United States policy concerning Iran and the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese domains targeted a United States audience without proper registration pursuant to\nFARA and without notifying the American public with a conspicuous label that the content of\nthe domains was being published on behalf of foreign principals, the IRGC and the\nGovernment of Iran.\n\nVisitors to the sites received the following message:\n\nThis seizure was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe Special Prosecutions Section and Asset Forfeiture Unit of the United States Attorney’s\nOffice for the Northern District of California, and the Counterespionage Section of the\nDepartment of Justice’s National Security Division, are prosecuting the seizure.\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download seizure_affidavit_.pdf](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1334551/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCounterintelligence and Export Control\n\nNational Security\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n20-1203\n\n\n-----",
