It's\nfunction appears to be a general bot-net and is mostly leveraged to\ninstall other malware such as key-logging/banking-trojans such as\nZeus or scareware like the many variants of Fake Anti-virus that is\ncurrently in the wild.\n\nI've been seeing this payload quite often this week. The most common\nway I see it is in fake shipping invoices. Today I received a welltargeted email using obviously-compromised user-contact data. It\nclaimed to be from the state business tax department, and encouraged\nthe recipient to install the (fake) secure-gateway software so that they\ncould continue to pay their sales taxes online.\n\nI'm being intentionally vague about the state since I'm haven't been\nable to contact them (abuse@$STATE$.gov bounces, for shame) but\nneedless to say, if your state is distributing security software to you, it\nshouldn't be hosted in Moldova.\n\nThe detection of the malware was low, only 3 out of 40 at virus total.\nThe host of the command and control server is also well aware of\ncertain public sandboxes' IP addresses; their reports of network\nbehavior were obviously blocked, and I managed to get one of my test\nIP addresses similarly blocked while playing around with the code\ntoday. They're upping their game.\nFor those looking for this on their networks, look for HTTP-like activity\nout to v-medical.org and 89.187.53.203.\n\n\nKevin Liston\n\n292 Posts\n\nISC Handler\nMay 27th 2010\n\n\n[Thread locked Subscribe](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/subscribe/8860/) May 27th 2010\n\n1 decade ago\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe activity and netblock you mention makes me think that this is\nrelated to Bredolab.\n\nhttp://blog.trendmicro.com/bredolab-revealed/\n\nCheck out the PDF near the bottom.\n\n[Quote](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/quote/7333) May 27th 2010\n\n1 decade ago\n\nYeah, Bredolab, Sasfis, Agent, Outbreak... pick one.
