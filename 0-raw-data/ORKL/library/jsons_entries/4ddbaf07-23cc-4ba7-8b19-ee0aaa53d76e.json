The latest\none, was seen on google play masked as a \"fun\" application. However, it downloaded a\nremote payload which contained this Malware.\n\nBankbot is an Android banking trojan that can be found in underground forums. It can be\ndownloaded without paying a penny, so it's a choice for many people. This is why we see\nincreasing numbers, with some variations but maintaining most of the original schema.\nIts functionality covers a wide range:\n\n\n-----\n\nGet device data\nIntercept SMS\nOverlay applications\nSend stolen data to remote C&C\n\nThis looks like a normal setup for an Android banking trojan. However, these communactions\nare taking place under an 'encrypted' schema thus not allowing us to see them. We are\nreleasing a script to decode them given the passwords after a few weeks of testing on\ndifferent bankbots thanks to the encryption routine in the server-side. (Can be found at the\nend of the post)\n\nThe script requires 2 parameters, the first one being the password and the second one being\nthe payload. Once we get this data, it's easy to retrieve the information.\n\nSay this is our example payload:\n\nAnd we are given the password mkleotrghyua then we just have to introduce this data in the\nscript and we will recover the original information.\n\nAnd this is it! All comms can be decrypted provided you have the password. You can now\nget this script [HERE! It has another example payload with other key.](https://gist.github.com/ineedblood/01dd714d9dd786f3c05a73aae4dfbaef)\n\n\n-----\n\nDecrypter: [https://gist.github.com/ineedblood/01dd714d9dd786f3c05a73aae4dfbaef](https://gist.github.com/ineedblood/01dd714d9dd786f3c05a73aae4dfbaef)\n\nSome samples:\n\n[74ace3a2af372887852ddf099db153d986326d926c1bfa3f86219213dbb06a18](https://koodous.com/apks/74ace3a2af372887852ddf099db153d986326d926c1bfa3f86219213dbb06a18)\n[2dfde3d394b7eaf3a45693dc95f9c5540c9fd2b3bc7e89e9ebc9d12963c00bee](https://koodous.com/apks/2dfde3d394b7eaf3a45693dc95f9c5540c9fd2b3bc7e89e9ebc9d12963c00bee)\n\n\n-----",
