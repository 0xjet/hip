However, as the malware developers copied it from an\nunrelated executable, it's marked as invalid due to a binary mismatch.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Invalid**\n\n**signature on the main executable**\n\n_Source: Bitdefender_\nBitdefender discovered that BHUNT is injected into explorer.exe and is likely delivered to\nthe compromised system via KMSpico downloads, a popular utility for illegally activating\nMicrosoft products.\n\nKMS (Key Management Services) is a Microsoft license activation system that software\npirates frequently abuse to activate Windows and Office products.\n\nBleepingComputer recently reported a similar case of malicious KMSPico activators\ndropping cryptocurrency-wallet stealers to pirates' systems.\n\nThis malware has been detected worldwide, with its greatest concentration of infected users\nin India, shown in the heat map below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**BHUNT victim heatmap**\n\n_Source: Bitdefender_\n\n## BHUNT modules\n\nThe main component of BHUNT is 'mscrlib.exe,' which extracts further modules that are\nlaunched on an infected system to perform different malicious behavior.\n\n**BHUNT's execution flow**\n\n_Source: Bitdefender_\nEach module is designed for a specific purpose ranging from stealing cryptocurrency\nwallets to stealing passwords. Using a modular approach, the threat actors can customize\nBHUNT for different campaigns or easily add new features.\n\nThe current modules included in the BHUNT 'mscrlib.exe' executable are described below:\n\n\n-----\n\n**blackjack – steals wallet file contents, encodes it with base 64, and uploads it to the**\nC2 server\n**chaos_crew – downloads payloads**\n**golden7 – steals passwords from the clipboard and uploads the files to the C2 server**\n**Sweet_Bonanza – steals information from browsers (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Opera,**\nSafari)\n**mrpropper – cleans up traces (argument files)**\n\nThe targeted wallets are Exodus, Electrum, Atomic, Jaxx, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and\n**Litecoin.**\n\nAs you can see in the code snippet below, the blackjack module is used to search for and\nsteal cryptocurrency wallets on a user's device and send them to a remote server under the\nattacker's control.\n\n**Blackjack's stealing function**\n\n_Source: Bitdefender_\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the threat actor gains access to the wallet s seed or configuration file, they can use it\nto import the wallet on their own devices and steal the contained cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough BHUNT's focus is clearly financial, its information-stealing capabilities could\nenable its operators to gather much more than just crypto-wallet data.\n\n\"While the malware primarily focuses on stealing information related to cryptocurrency\nwallets, it can also harvest passwords and cookies stored in browser caches,\" - explains\n[Bitdefender's report.](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/poking-holes-in-crypto-wallets-a-short-analysis-of-bhunt-stealer/)\n\n\"This might include account passwords for social media, banking, etc. that might even result\nin an online identity takeover.\"\n\nTo avoid being infected by BHUNT, you should simply avoid downloading pirated software,\ncracks, and illegitimate product activators.\n\n[As it's been proven repeatedly, the projected financial savings from using pirated software](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-rumba-stop-ransomware-being-installed-by-software-cracks/)\nare insignificant compared to the damage they can cause to infected systems.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[German automakers targeted in year-long malware campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-automakers-targeted-in-year-long-malware-campaign/)\n\n[BHUNT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bhunt/)\n[Crypto Wallet](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/crypto-wallet/)\n[CryptoCurrency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cryptocurrency/)\n[Info Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/info-stealer/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Passwords](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/passwords/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
