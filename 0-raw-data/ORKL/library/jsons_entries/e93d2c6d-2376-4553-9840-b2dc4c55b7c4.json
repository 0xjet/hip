Our Attack\nSurface Intelligence (ASI) tool identified open ports that may have been vulnerable to\n**such attacks.**\n\nThese attacks may represent a novel tactic on Vice Society’s part.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Vice Society Ransomware Group**\n\n[According to research into the group conducted by Sekoia and published in July 2022, the](https://blog.sekoia.io/vice-society-a-discreet-but-steady-double-extortion-ransomware-group/)\nVice Society ransomware group first appeared in May 2021 and has targeted educational\ninstitutions quite heavily; more of its victims have been in the education sector than any\nother. Early research into the group suggested that it was a successor to the HelloKitty\n[ransomware, with one researcher noting similarities between the groups’ encryption methods](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1403109032014061568)\nas early as June 2021. However, Sekoia’s more recent research suggests that Vice Society\nsimply uses strains that are relatively easily available through ransomware-as-a-service\noperations that have historically been advertised fairly widely in the Russian-speaking\ncybercriminal underground, including the HelloKitty and, more recently, Zeppelin strains of\n[ransomware (Zeppelin was itself the subject of a recent CISA alert). The Zeppelin strain first](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-223a)\nbecame available in Russian cybercrime forums in 2019 and has appeared in more recent\nVice Society attacks. While the group attracted attention early on in its operations for\n[exploiting the then-novel PrintNightmare vulnerability, the extant public research has not](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/vice-society-ransomware-printnightmare.html)\nlinked Vice Society to SSH brute force attacks, so the activity described below may\n**represent a dimension of the group’s attacks not previously reported.**\n\n**SecurityScorecard Findings**\n\nSecurityScorecard’s platform has observed issues (including configurations) affecting the\nschool district’s assets that are common among ransomware victims according to previous\nSecurityScorecard research.\n\nSecurityScorecard found an open FTP service at an IP address attributed to the school\ndistrict as recently as August 2. Generally speaking, attackers may take an interest in filesharing services because they offer a means of accessing victim data Some ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n[groups have taken a particular interest in it. For example, Sophos warned in February 2021](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/02/16/what-to-expect-when-youve-been-hit-with-conti-ransomware/)\nthat it had observed the Conti group using FTP to steal victim data.\n\nSecurityScorecard also noticed five high-severity vulnerabilities affecting the versions of the\nSSH software running at port 22 of four school district IP addresses between July 20 and\nAugust 7. The vulnerabilities in question are CVE-2010-4478, CVE-2016-10009, CVE-20168858, CVE-2016-10012, and CVE-2016-6515. A remote attacker could exploit CVE-20104478 to bypass certain access controls and authenticate to a system, leverage CVE-201610009 to execute arbitrary code on affected systems, and escalate privileges through\n[exploiting CVE-2016-10012.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10012)\n\n[Meanwhile, CVE-2016-6515 and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6515) [CVE-2016-8858 are both vulnerabilities attackers could](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8858)\nexploit to deny service through affected versions of OpenSSH. These vulnerabilities may be\nparticularly concerning in light of the recent attack not only because Vice Society has, in\n[general, been known to exploit published vulnerabilities (especially for remote code](https://blog.sekoia.io/vice-society-a-discreet-but-steady-double-extortion-ransomware-group/)\nexecution, which CVE-2016-10009 can allow) and because these vulnerabilities affect\nsoftware running at the ports involved in the suspicious traffic uncovered by\nSecurityScorecard’s netflow analysis, but also because, more generally, some attacks with\nthe Zeppelin strain (which Vice Society has employed recently) have exploited vulnerabilities\nin public-facing applications for initial access.\n\nSecurityScorecard also observed exposed credentials, which an adversary could use to\n[launch credential-stuffing attacks; these may have been the particular variety of brute force](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/brute-force-attack)\nattack suggested by the traffic discussed below. SecurityScorecardhas observed 11\ninformation leaks that exposed 239 passwords associated with school district email\naddresses, which attackers could have employed in the SSH attacks discussed below. In\nsome cases, these leaks also contained employees’ personal information, including names,\ndates of birth, password hints, job titles, and physical addresses. These latter categories\npose a less direct threat than exposed passwords. Nonetheless, they represent a significant\nrisk, as attackers could use them to mount social engineering attacks against the employees\nin question and then use information acquired from them to attack the school district.\n\nBeyond the possible avenues of attack enabled by the issues discussed above,\n[SecurityScorecard has previously researched the links between our scorecard factors and](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/organizations-with-diligent-cybersecurity-practices-less-likely-to-fall-victim-to-costly-ransomware-attacks)\nransomware attacks in order to identify which of the issues we observe are more prevalent\namong ransomware victims than other organizations. Many of the issue types identified in\nthis research also affect the school district in question.\n\nSecurityScorecard observed seventeen cases of exposed personal information affecting\nschool district employees. This issue was almost 40% more prevalent among the\nransomware cohort than among non-victim organizations. SecurityScorecard observed TLS\nservices that support weak protocols in use on the district’s networks; this finding is over 30%\nmore prevalent among ransomware victims than non-victims. Our earlier research also noted\n\n\n-----\n\nthat another TLS flaw, TLS Service Supports Weak Cipher Suite, was 30% more prevalent in\nthe ransomware cohort than in the control group. SSC has found services at districtattributed IP addresses to support weak cipher suites. While these findings may not clearly\nillustrate the path attackers took to compromise the school district’s systems, they may\nindicate that the district suffers from issues common to ransomware victims. In order to better\nfocus their efforts to collect network flow (netflow) data likely to yield insights about the attack\nagainst the school district, our researchers used its scorecard’s findings to guide their data\ncollections, limiting their netflow sample to traffic involving the four IP addresses where the\nSecurityScorecard’s platform detected the issues discussed above (207.191.197[.]62,\n207.191.197[.]42, 207.191.197.41, and 72.52.219[.]120).\n\n**Netflow Analysis**\n\nSecurityScorecard’s netflow tool detected considerable traffic that may indicate a series of\npossible SSH brute force attacks against the school district. SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool\nobserved 8,281 flows to the four IP addresses attributed to the school district over a\nmonitoring period lasting from June 5 to August 5, 2022. Of those, a disproportionately large\nnumber (3,571) involved port 22, the standard port for SSH traffic. The dates with the five\nheaviest concentrations of traffic using port 22 were (in descending order by flow count) June\n5, June 7, June 19, June 10, and July 1. As of August 5, ASI has also revealed that SSH was\nstill in use at port 22 of the school district IP addresses involved in these flows.\n\n**June 5**\n\nThe first possible attack appears to have occurred on June 5. Three school district-attributed\nIP addresses saw a relatively large number of flows (640) that used port 22 and involved the\nthree aforementioned IP addresses attributed to the school district.\n\n[These flows involved 22 external IP addresses, all of which other vendors have linked to](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/159.65.240.232%250A188.166.181.167%250A167.99.61.176%250A104.248.157.240%250A128.199.251.65%250A165.22.240.154%250A27.109.12.34%250A31.220.17.31%250A41.63.9.36%250A159.65.154.92%250A103.4.119.20%250A167.71.131.111%250A68.183.142.49%250A139.59.168.22%250A161.35.127.34%250A165.22.49.42%250A159.223.61.129%250A137.184.215.32%250A128.199.145.5%250A164.92.150.6%250A165.227.167.225%250A167.71.204.59/ips)\nmalicious activity:\n\n1. 159.65.240[.]232\n\n2. 188.166.181[.]167\n\n3. 167.99.61[.]176\n\n4. 104.248.157[.]240\n\n5. 128.199.251[.]65\n\n6. 165.22.240[.]154\n\n7. 27.109.12[.]34\n\n\n-----\n\n8. 31.220.17[.]31\n\n9. 41.63.9[.]36\n\n10. 159.65.154[.]92\n\n11. 103.4.119[.]20\n\n12. 167.71.131[.]111\n\n13. 68.183.142[.]49\n\n14. 139.59.168[.]22\n\n15. 161.35.127[.]34\n\n16. 165.22.49[.]42\n\n17. 159.223.61[.]129\n\n18. 137.184.215[.]32\n\n19. 128.199.145[.]5\n\n20. 164.92.150[.]6\n\n21. 165.227.167[.]225\n\n22. 167.71.204[.]59\n\nOf the above IP addresses, both ASI’s malicious reputation data (see the representative\nsample of ASI findings below) and the wider cybersecurity community link the following to\nSSH brute force attacks:\n\n159.65.240[.]232\n\n188.166.181[.]167\n\n104.248.157[.]240\n\n128.199.251[.]65\n\n165.22.240[.]154\n\n31.220.17[.]31\n\n\n-----\n\n41.63.9[.]36\n\n159.65.154[.]92\n\n103.4.119[.]20\n\n167.71.131[.]111\n\n68.183.142[.]49\n\n139.59.168[.]22\n\n161.35.127[.]34\n\n165.22.49[.]42\n\n159.223.61[.]129\n\n137.184.215[.]32\n\n128.199.145[.]5\n\n164.92.150[.]6\n\n165.227.167[.]225\n\n167.71.204[.]59\n\n\n-----\n\n_Images 1-3: ASI has linked many of the non-school district IP addresses involved in the_\n_traffic observed on June 5 to SSH brute force attacks_\n\nWhile ASI does not have any malicious reputation data on the following IP addresses, other\ncommunity members have observed them conducting SSH brute force attacks:\n\n[167.99.61[.]176](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/167.99.61.176/community)\n\n[27.109.12[.]34](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/27.109.12.34/community)\n\n**June 7**\n\nThe next possible attack occurred on June 7, when the same three school district IP\naddresses saw 326 flows using port 22.

It may represent a series of brute force attacks against the school district\nthroughout June and July.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis information was gathered and analyzed to briefly preview some of SecurityScorecard’s\nThreat Intelligence and investigation capabilities. SecurityScorecard was only able to query\nand contextualize some of its in-house sources; it, therefore, bears noting that this is not an\nexhaustive list of issues related to the school district’s overall cyber risk exposure. However,\nthe data researchers have collected and analyzed thus far may offer new insights into the\nattack and Vice Society’s operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe timing of these possible attacks in June and July may suggest that Vice Society\nattempted credential-stuffing attacks on the school district’s SSH services at an earlier stage\nin its operation, prior to the presumed encryption of the district’s systems in early August.\nSuch attacks could have employed the exposed passwords contained in SecurityScorecard’s\ninformation leak findings or attempted to exploit the high-severity vulnerabilities affecting the\nSSH software in use at those IP addresses. Since researchers have not previously linked\nVice Society to SSH brute force attempts, this traffic may represent a novel dimension of\nVice Society’s activity. It is, of course, possible that the suspicious traffic was independent of\nVice Society’s attack on the school district. Still, it is not unheard of for ransomware groups to\nuse SSH brute force attacks to access victim systems, even if analysts have not previously\n[observed Vice Society employing such a tactic: 2016 research linked the FairWare](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-fairware-ransomware-targeting-linux-computers/)\n[ransomware group to such attacks, and Intezer observed ransomware groups employing it in](https://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/seizing-15-active-ransomware-campaigns-targeting-linux-file-storage-servers/)\n2019.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n**Incident Response Support**\n\nSecurityScorecard provides managed incident response and digital forensics teams as a\nprofessional service driven by a large group of former law enforcement and private sector\nexperts with decades of experience in the space.
