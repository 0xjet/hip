This sample was found by Twitter user\n[@GrujaRS on May 4 .th](https://twitter.com/GrujaRS/status/1257251860865519616)\n\n[View the VMRay Analyzer Report](https://www.vmray.com/analyses/8af0d99cef6f/report/overview.html)\n\nThe first step before the ransomware encrypts user files, it disables various services:\n\nwscsvc (Windows Security Center Service)\nWinDefend (Windows Defender Service)\nwuauserv (Windows Update Service)\nBITS\nERSvc (Error Reporting Service)\nand WerSvc (Windows Error Reporting Service)\n\nThe malware author is disabling these services that would lead to an interruption (like\nrestarting after a Windows Update) or an error in encryption (notifying an end-user of\nmalicious activity using Windows Defender).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to stopping the system services, the ransomware tries to stop running tasks of\nMicrosoft Exchange, sqlserver, and sqlwriter. Stopping these tasks is also a way to ensure\nit’s able to encrypt all files which might still be used by Microsoft Exchange during the\nencryption.\n\nBy focusing on Microsoft Exchange this could mean that Rhino Ransomware could be\ntargeting businesses.\n\nIt hinders the recovery from backups by deleting relevant data like shadow copies and the\nbackup catalog as well as disabling the Windows Recovery Mode with bcdedit.\n\nTypically, these commands are hardcoded in the program/malware itself but in this sample,\nthe commands are embedded as a resource file. This design allows the malware author to\nchange/update the commands without changing the logic inside.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo achieve persistence, the sample copies itself to the %AppData% directory as\n“mshtop32bit.exe” and creates a new entry in\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for the value\n“MarvelHost”.\n\nAfter the files have been encrypted, it adds the file marker “Marvel01” at offset filesize-32 to\nthe content and appends the string “.[generalchin@countermail.com].rhino” to the filenames.\nThe email in the appended string is also displayed in the ransom note.\n\nThe ransomware excludes files with the extension exe, sys, lnk, dll, msi and its ransom\nnotes.\n\nTo inform the user about the infection, the text file “ReadMe_Decryptor.txt” is dropped in\nvarious directories. Furthermore, another ransom note (“Decryptor_Info.hta”) is dropped in\n%AppData% and shown to the user.\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA256: 8af0d99cef6fb1d040083ff8934f9a7ce01f358ca796b3c60087a2ebf6335c83\n\n\n-----",
