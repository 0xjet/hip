The group rented IP addresses, servers, and\ndomains to cybercriminal clients who employed this technical infrastructure to disseminate\nmalware used to gain access to victims’ computers, form botnets, and steal banking\ncredentials for use in frauds. Malware hosted by the organization included Zeus, SpyEye,\nCitadel, and the Blackhole Exploit Kit, which attacked U.S. companies and financial\ninstitutions between 2009 and 2015 and caused or attempted to cause millions of dollars in\nlosses to U.S. victims. The defendants also helped their clients evade detection by law\n\n\n-----\n\nenforcement and continue their crimes uninterrupted by monitoring sites used to blocklist\ntechnical infrastructure used for crime, moving “flagged” content to new infrastructure, and\nregistering all such infrastructure under false or stolen identities.\n\n“Cybercrime presents a serious and persistent threat to the United States, and these\nprosecutions send a clear message that ‘bulletproof hosters’ who purposely aid other\ncybercriminals are responsible, and will be held accountable, for the harms their criminal\nclients cause within our borders,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the\nJustice Department’s Criminal Division.\n\n“Given their international nature, and the anonymity of the internet, cybercrime investigations\noften take years,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Saima Mohsin for the Eastern District of\nMichigan. “They can require the resources of multiple law enforcement agencies, the\ncooperation of multiple governments, skilled interpreters, and time-consuming extradition\nprocedures. The persistence and hard work of our law enforcement partners has led to these\nsuccessful prosecutions and sends a message to cybercriminals that they will be brought to\njustice.”\n\n“Over the course of many years, the defendants facilitated the transnational criminal activity\nof a vast network of cybercriminals throughout the world by providing them a safe-haven to\nanonymize their criminal activity,” said Special Agent in Charge Timothy Waters of the FBI’s\nDetroit Field Office. “This resulted in millions of dollars of losses to U.S. victims.\nCybercriminals may believe they are beyond the reach of the FBI and our international\npartners, but today’s proceeding proves that anyone who facilitates or profits from criminal\ncyber activity will be brought to justice.”\n\nAccording to court filings and statements made in connection with the defendants’ guilty\npleas, Skorodumov was one of the organization’s lead systems administrators and, at some\npoints, its only systems administrator. In this role, he configured and managed the clients’\ndomains and IP addresses, provided technical assistance to help clients optimize their\nmalware and botnets, and monitored and responded to abuse notices. Stassi undertook\nvarious administrative tasks for the organization, including conducting and tracking online\nmarketing to the organization’s criminal clientele and using stolen and/or false personal\ninformation to register webhosting and financial accounts used by the organization.\n\nStassi, Skorodumov, Grichishkin and Skvortsov each pleaded guilty to one count of\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy. Grichishkin and\nSkvortsov are pending sentencing and face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A\nfederal district court judge will determine each sentence after considering the U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case with critical assistance from law enforcement partners in\nGermany, Estonia and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n-----\n\nSenior Counsel Louisa K. Marion of the Criminal Division s Computer Crime and Intellectual\nProperty Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick E. Corbett of the Eastern District of\nMichigan prosecuted the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs\nprovided substantial assistance.\n\n\n-----",
