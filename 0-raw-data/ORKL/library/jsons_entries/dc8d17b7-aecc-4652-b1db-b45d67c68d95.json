Proofpoint has only\nseen three different C2 domains in the last six months.\nBandook is an old malware that is not used by many threat actors.\n\n## Overview \n\nProofpoint researchers identified a new and highly active threat group, TA2721, also colloquially referred to by our\nresearchers as Caliente Bandits. The group targets multiple industries from finance to entertainment. The group uses Spanish-languages lures\nto distribute a known – but infrequently used – remote access trojan (RAT) called Bandook. Proofpoint researchers nicknamed the\ngroup Caliente Bandits for their use of Hotmail email accounts – “caliente” is the Spanish word for “hot.”\n\nProofpoint researchers began tracking this group in January 2021 and have observed TA2721 distribute email threats\ndelivering Bandook every week since April. The campaigns are low volume, with fewer than 300 messages per campaign. The threats target\nentities globally, but the threat actors mostly impact individuals with Spanish surnames at these organizations. Cybersecurity firm ESET\nfirst [published details of the malware used by this group.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/07/07/bandidos-at-large-spying-campaign-latin-america/)\n\n## Campaign Details \n\nTA2721 leverages the same type of budget or payment-themed lures throughout its campaigns to prompt a user to download a PDF.\n\n_Figure 1: Email sample masquerading as a budget/quotation proposal._\n\nThe attached PDF contains an embedded URL and password that, when clicked, leads to the download of a password protected compressed\nexecutable that contains Bandook.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: PDF containing a malicious link and password that leads to the download Bandook._\n\nProofpoint researchers observed TA2721 sending low-volume campaigns impacting less than 100 organizations at a time since January\n2021. Targets include entities in manufacturing, automotive, food and beverage, entertainment and media, banking, insurance, and\nagriculture. Targeted organizations included entities in the U.S., Europe, and South America, both multinational organizations as well as\nsmaller businesses. Only a handful of individuals are targeted at each organization, and most have Spanish-language surnames, such as\nPérez, Castillo, Ortiz, etc.\n\nThe targeting suggests TA2721 conducts reconnaissance and attack planning to obtain employee data and contact information. The group\nappears to target individuals that may speak Spanish, increasingly the likelihood of a successful compromise.\n\n## Delivery and Installation\n\nProofpoint researchers have observed this actor distributing two different Bandook variants. Bandook is commodity malware, but the tactics\nused in the campaigns demonstrate some attempts to evade detection and add additional effort for the attacker. The password-protection of\nthe malicious archive is an easy way to make detection by automatic analysis products harder, and the specific focus on Spanish-language\nsurnames coupled with low volume targeting suggests the threat actor conducted reconnaissance before deploying campaigns.\n\nNearly all observed campaigns contained PDF attachments containing links to the Bandook download, however in one June campaign the\nthreat actor began using URLs in the messages directly.\n\nTA2721 sends Spanish-language messages masquerading as companies located in South America, typically Venezuela, and Mexico.\nThey are sent from Hotmail or Gmail email addresses. Subjects and filenames typically contain the\nterms \"PRESUPUESTO (Budget)\", \"COTIZACION (Quotation)\", and \"rcibo de pago (receipt of payment)\".\n\nTA2721 generally uses the same command and control (C2) infrastructure for weeks or months at a time. For example:\n\n“s1[.]megawoc[.]com” was used in January.\n“d1[.]ngobmc[.]com” was used from March to June.\n“r1[.]panjo[.]club” was used since June.\n\nThe URLs observed from January through June 2021 used shortener URLs such as bit[.]ly and rebrand[.]ly links. These redirect\nto spideroak[.]com, an enterprise security file sharing platform. The URLs lead to the download of a password protected RAR file that\ninstalls Bandook.\n\n## Malware Analysis \n\nBandook is a commercially available RAT written in Delphi and has been seen in the wild since at least 2007. Researchers have published\n[details about multiple now publicly-available](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/Lookout_Dark-Caracal_srr_20180118_us_v.1.0.pdf%22%20/) [variants. Bandook can capture screenshots, video, keylogging, and audio on the host, and can be](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/bandook-signed-delivered/)\nused for information gathering operations\n\n\n-----\n\nesp te ts a a ab ty a d age o use, oo po t does ot obse e a y ot e t eat acto cu e t y us g t s a a e act, s ce 0 5,\nProofpoint has observed around 40 total campaigns distributing this malware, with the 2021 TA2721 campaigns making up more than 50% of\nthe observed activity. According to [MITRE ATT&CK’s malware wiki, Bandook is not widely used.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0234/)\n\nThe following is an example of a TA2721 attack chain with the identified sample:\n\nSubject: COMPROBANTE DE PAGO LOGSITICA CARACAS CA\n\nSender: logvenccs@doca-safety[.]com\n\nAttachment: comprobante de pago corporacion alfeca, c.a..pdf\n\nPDF: 5eaa1f5305f4c25292dff29257cd3e14ba3f956f6f8ddb206c0ee3e09af8244e\n\nBandook: 561cb93118fef1966a3233ae7ffd31017823dd5aaad5dc1b2542e717055c197a\n\n_Figure 3: TA2721 attack chain._\n\nThe email contains a PDF attachment. A URL inside the PDF leads to a password protected RAR archive. The password for the RAR can be\nfound in the initial PDF attachment (123456). Although the threat actors have changed URL shorteners and C2 domains, the archive password\nremains the same in every campaign.\n\n_Figure 4: PDF containing a link to malware hosted on the Spider Oak filesharing service._\n\nThe PDF contains the following URL:\n\nhxxps[:]//bit[.]ly/bcomprob-sbaa1\n\n\n-----\n\nc d ects to\n\nhxxps[:]//spideroak[.]com/storage/OVPXG4DJMRSXE33BNNPWC5LUN5PTMNBSHE2TM/shared/1764556-1-1104/COMPROBANTE[.]rar?\ne22cde1331099985a6339fac899e3ebe\n\nAnd downloads COMPROBANTE.rar with the following hash:\n\n39ce7b1e2dc1d4fe3bee24a9be8bea52bcb9028b50090731e5fff586106c264f\n\nThe extracted file contains the following Bandook executable:\n\nFilename: COMPROBANTE.exe\n\nHash: 561cb93118fef1966a3233ae7ffd31017823dd5aaad5dc1b2542e717055c197a\n\nThe executable is packed multiple times (e.g. UPX). The strings are base64 encoded and encrypted which makes it difficult to\nreverse engineer. When executed, it creates a new Internet Explorer process (iexplore.exe) and injects the Bandook payload into it. This\n[process is called Process Hollowing.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/%22%20/)\n\nBandook maintains persistence by creating a copy of itself and adding an entry to the run keys in the Microsoft Registry pointing to the\ncopy that will load every time a user logs on.\n\nKey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\xxhgjyljicoftqsffwxx\n\nData: C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\xxhgjyljicoftqsffwxx\\xxhgjyljicoftqsffwxx.exe\n\n[The Bandook version used by the Caliente Bandits actor is similar to the one reported by Checkpoint in November 2020. The identified](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/bandook-signed-delivered/)\nsamples also use AES encryption in CFB mode for C2 communication using a hardcoded key, and an initialization vector (IV) which is not part\nof the publicly available Bandook versions.\n\nBandook Configuration\n\nPrimary C2: r3[.]panjo[.]club:7893\n\nFallback C2: hxxp[:]//ladvsa[.]club/Hayauaia/\n\nAES_CFB_Key: HuZ82K83ad392jVBhr2Au383Pud82AuF\n\nAES_CFB_IV: 0123456789123456\n\nSo far Proofpoint has observed only one hardcoded AES Key and IV value used by Caliente Bandits.\n\nThe payload connects to the C2 server over TCP and sends AES Encrypted basic information about the infected machine to the C2\nserver.

The specific targeting suggests the threat actor conducts some reconnaissance on target entities before sending email\nthreats.\n\nProofpoint researchers anticipate this actor will continue to use similar email lures, infection chains, and passwords while rotating through C2\ndomains.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\nba1355c5e24c431a34bae10915f7cc9b4b1a8843dc79d9c63f1a13f0f9d099f7 SHA256\nHash\n\n\n**Description**\n\n“cotizacion corporacion\nPDF June 21st\n\n\nhxxps[:]//bit[.]ly/acotiz-abaa1 URL URL inside PDF June 2\n\n\nhxxps[:]//spideroak[.]com/storage/OVPXG4DJMRSXE33BNNPWC5LUN5PTMNBSHE2TM/shared/17645561-1105/COTIZACION 21[.]rar?17afe9bc9463ab5de84bd956cf4dfa9e\n\n\nURL Unshortened Bitly URL\n\n\na37c79c57ae9e2d681e5f9ef92798278d2bec68bcd91f08d96768e3fe8d5af19 SHA256\nHash\n\n561cb93118fef1966a3233ae7ffd31017823dd5aaad5dc1b2542e717055c197a SHA256\nHash\n\n\n“COTIZACION 21.rar”\nDownloaded Rar archiv\n21st (password: 123456\n\n“COTIZACION 21.exe”\ninside Rar June 21st\n\n\nr3[.]panjo[.]club:7893 C2 Primary C2 of Bandook\n21st\n\nhxxp[:]//ladvsa[.]club/Hayauaia/ C2 Fallback C2 of Bandook\n21st\n\n\n-----\n\n5eaa1f5305f4c25292dff29257cd3e14ba3f956f6f8ddb206c0ee3e09af8244e SHA256\nHash\n\n\n”comprobante de pago c\nc.a..pdf” PDF June 21st\n\n\nhxxps[:]//bit[.]ly/bcomprob-sbaa1 URL URL inside PDF June 2\n\n\nhxxps[:]//spideroak[.]com/storage/OVPXG4DJMRSXE33BNNPWC5LUN5PTMNBSHE2TM/shared/17645561-1104/COMPROBANTE[.]rar?e22cde1331099985a6339fac899e3ebe\n\n\nURL Unshortened Bitly URL\n\n\n39ce7b1e2dc1d4fe3bee24a9be8bea52bcb9028b50090731e5fff586106c264f SHA256\nHash\n\n561cb93118fef1966a3233ae7ffd31017823dd5aaad5dc1b2542e717055c197a SHA256\nHash\n\n**ET Signatures**\n\n2003549 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.2 Initial Connection and Report\n\n2003550 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.2 Get Processes\n\n2003551 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.2 Kill Process Command\n\n2003552 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.2 Reporting Socks Proxy Active\n\n2003553 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.2 Reporting Socks Proxy Off\n\n2003554 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.2 Client Ping Reply\n\n2003555 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Initial Connection and Report\n\n2003556 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Keepalive Send\n\n2003557 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Keepalive Reply\n\n2003558 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Create Registry Key Command Send\n\n2003559 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Create Directory Command Send\n\n2003560 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Window List Command Send\n\n2003561 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Window List Reply\n\n2003562 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Get Processes Command Send\n\n2003563 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Start Socks5 Proxy Command Send\n\n2003564 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Socks5 Proxy Start Command Reply\n\n2003565 - ET MALWARE Bandook v1.35 Get Processes Command Reply\n\n2003937 - ET MALWARE Bandook iwebho/BBB-phish trojan leaking user data\n\n2805272 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Variant CnC Checkin\n\n2810120 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Retrieving Payloads set\n\n2810121 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Retrieving Payloads\n\n2810122 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Initial HTTP CnC Beacon\n\n2810123 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Initial HTTP CnC Beacon Response\n\n2810124 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook HTTP CnC Beacon M1\n\n2810125 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook HTTP CnC Beacon M2\n\n2810126 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook HTTP CnC Beacon M3\n\n2810127 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook HTTP CnC Beacon Response\n\n\n“COMPROBANTE.rar”\nDownloaded Rar archiv\n21st (password: 123456\n\n“COMPROBANTE.exe”\ninside Rar June 21st\n\n\n-----\n\n8 0 8 O a doo C C C eaco\n\n2810129 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook TCP CnC Beacon Response\n\n2814671 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Retrieving Payload (cap)\n\n2814672 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook Retrieving Payload (tv)\n\n2839949 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook v0.5FM TCP CnC Beacon\n\n2841218 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook TCP CnC Beacon\n\n2841802 - ETPRO MALWARE Suspected Bandook CnC M1\n\n2841803 - ETPRO MALWARE Suspected Bandook CnC Response\n\n2845793 - ETPRO MALWARE Suspected Bandook CnC M2\n\n2848605 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook TCP CnC Beacon Keep-Alive (Inbound)\n\n2848616 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook TCP CnC Beacon Keep-Alive (Inbound)\n\n2848728 - ETPRO MALWARE Bandook v0.5FM TCP CnC Beacon M2\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
