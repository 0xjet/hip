Some phishing messages contain\nmalicious lures masquerading as official European Union reports on the conflict in Ukraine and its\neffects on NATO countries. Other phishing emails deliver fake \"official\" Ukrainian government\nreports, both of which download malware onto compromised machines.\nMustang Panda has been known to use themed lures relating to various current-day events and\nissues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, international summits and various political topics.\nWhile the Ukraine-related Mustang Panda developments have been reported by at least one other\nsecurity firm, we identified additional samples that have not been cited in open-source reporting.\nApart from targeting European countries, Mustang Panda has also targeted organizations in the\nU.S. and Asia.\nIn these campaigns, we've observed the deployment of Mustang Panda's PlugX implant, custom\nstagers and reverse shells and meterpreter-based shellcode, all used to establish long-term\npersistence on infected endpoints with the intention of conducting espionage.\n\n## Threat actor profile\n\nMustangPanda, also known as \"RedDelta\" or \"Bronze President,\" is a China-based threat actor that has\n[targeted entities all over the world since at least 2012, including American and European entities such as](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\n[government organizations, think tanks, NGOs, and even Catholic organizations at the Vatican.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/)\n\n[We've also observed extensive targeting of Asian countries as well, such as the Taiwanese government,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-tropic-trooper-targets-taiwanese-government-and-fossil-fuel-provider-with-poison-ivy/)\n[activists in Hong Kong, NGOs in Mongolia and Tibet, Myanmar and even Afghan and Indian](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)\ntelecommunication firms.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor heavily relies on sending lures via phishing emails to achieve initial infection. These lures\noften masquerade as legitimate documents of national and organizational interest to the targets. These\ninfection vectors deploy malware predominantly consisting of the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT) with\n[custom stagers, reverse shells, meterpreter and Cobalt Strike, which act as another mechanism for](https://twitter.com/AvastThreatLabs/status/1404864966679678981)\nachieving long term access into their targets. One thing remains consistent across all these campaigns —\nMustang Panda is clearly looking to conduct espionage campaigns.\n\n## Threat actor TTPs\n\nMustang Panda's recent activity targets European entities, including Russian targets, and uses political\nthemes to deliver the PlugX family of malware implants.\n\nTypical infection chains employed by Mustang Panda consist of three key components:\n\n**Benign executable: Used to side-load a malicious DLL.**\n**Malicious DLL (loader): The malicious DLL accompanying the executable is usually a loader for**\nthe PlugX implant, typically an encrypted or encoded blob of data deployed by the loader DLL.\n**PlugX implant: A RAT implant used extensively by Mustang Panda. It consists of a malicious DLL**\nthat can perform a variety of actions on the infected endpoint including downloading and deploying\nnew modules/plugins.\n**Stagers and reverse shells: Instead of using PlugX, the attackers will sometimes use DLLs**\nacting as custom developed stagers, meterpreter-based shellcode downloaders and even custom\nreverse shells.\n\nInfection chains utilized by the APT group typically consist of:\n\n**Executable downloaders: These downloaders are delivered packaged in an archive. The**\ndownloaders are responsible for fetching and instrumenting various infection artifacts, resulting in\nthe deployment of the PlugX implant on the infected endpoint.\n**Archive based infections: Malicious archives delivered to targets typically consist of a benign**\nexecutable with names meant to trick victims into executing them. The executable will load a\nmalicious DLL which can either be the loader for the PlugX implant or a reverse shell or\nmeterpreter-based shellcode downloader.\n**Shortcut files: Shortcuts (LNK files) delivered to victims consist of all the infection components**\nembedded in the LNK files. These consist of intermediate components like BAT files that are meant\nto load the malicious DLLs which may be PlugX loaders or stagers.\n**Maldocs: We've also observed limited use of maldocs to target entities in Asia with the stagers and**\nmeterpreter payloads to execute the next stage of shellcode payloads.\n\n## Targets across the world\n\n### European political lures\n\nThis attacker started attacks earlier this year where a vast majority of the lures and decoys consisted of\nthemes related to the European Union (EU). For example, in early January 2022, we saw the attackers\n\n\n-----\n\nemploy a lure that consisted of a European Commision report on state aid to Greece between 2022 and\n2027. Toward the end of January, the attackers started using a press release from the EU regarding the\nunion's human rights priorities in 2022.\n\nThe attackers also started taking advantage of publications and documents related to the degrading\nrelations between Ukraine and Russia. In late January, the group started spreading a lure containing\nPlugX that disguised itself as a report from the EU's general secretary.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the attackers started using related documents to infect\ntheir targets. A lure from Feb. 28 was disguised as a report on the situation along European borders with\n**_Ukraine, while another one in March consisted of a report on the situation along the European borders_**\nwith Belarus.\n\nWhile the threat actors continued the use of regional and topical events in Eastern Europe, they also used\nother topics of interest to infect their victims. In March, we observed the use of a lure targeting Russian\nagencies, a malicious executable delivering the PlugX implant, named \"Благовещенск Благовещенский Пограничный Отряд.exe\" roughly translating to \"Blagoveshchensk - Blagoveshchensk\nBorder Guard Detachment.exe,\" a report on the border detachment to Blagoveshchensk, a town of\nstrategic importance to Russia, located on the Sino-Russian border.\n\n### American-themed political lures\n\n\n-----\n\n[Since at least May 2016, Mustang Panda has operated campaigns targeting multiple entities in the United](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\nStates. Additionally, the APT has frequently used overlapping topics of interest to multiple entities across\nthe globe. Some of their lures such as \"U.S. Asst Secretary of State Visit to ASEAN Countries.rar\" from\nDecember 2021 and \"Biden's attitude towards the situation in Myanmar.zip\" from February 2021 reaffirm\nthis trend of targeting two birds with one stone. In all these instances, we observed the use of stagers as\nthe final payloads in the infection chains instead of a direct deployment of PlugX.\n\n### Asian-themed lures\n\nMustang Panda has been extremely prolific in targeting various government entities in Asian countries\nover the past few years such as those in Myanmar, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n[The threat actor has aggressively targeted the government of Myanmar since 2019, even breaching their](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1400165767488970764)\nwebsites on multiple occasions to host malware payloads. This targeting continued into 2021 with lures\nrelated to the National Unity Government of Myanmar and its People's Defence Force. All these attacks\nresulted in the deployment of an implant executing meterpreter HTTP shellcode.\n\n[Mustang Panda has frequently used the ASEAN summit as a topic for their lures to infect individuals](https://asean.org/about-us/asean-summit/)\nparticipating in this summit. Using such topics enables the APT to infect a wide range of targets (the\n[ASEAN association consists of 10 member countries in Southeast Asia). This tactic is in line with Mustang](https://asean.org/about-asean/member-states/)\nPanda's practice of using an overlapping topic of interest to target multiple entities with the same lures.\n\nIn March 2021, the APT targeted government entities in Hong Kong using a malicious archive named\n\"Report.rar\". This archive contained a lure named \"Report 18-3-2021 101A.exe\" for sideloading a\nmalicious DLL-based meterpreter stager. The keyword \"101A\" refers to Section 101A of the Criminal\nProcedure Ordinance which dictates terms of use of force in making arrests in Hong Kong, a hot topic on\naccount of recent civil unrest and protests.\n\nJapanese government officials have also been targeted recently using lures masquerading as minutes of\nthe Japanese cabinet's meetings in 2021. Lures such as \"210615_Cabinet_Meeting_Minutes.exe\" and\n\"210831_21st Cabinet Meeting Minutes.rar\" have been actively used to infect victims with custom stagers.\n\n## Latest infection vectors\n\n### Downloaders\n\nBeginning in 2022, we observed Mustang Panda distributing malicious executables acting as\ndownloaders, and disguised as fake reports on various Europe-related subjects as initial infection vectors\nagainst targets in Europe. These executables were usually distributed wrapped up in an archive file to the\n[targets. Recently, ESET disclosed a similar infection delivering a previously unknown PlugX variant.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/)\n\nAs recently as March 2022, we discovered a downloader pretending to be a report on the current situation\nalong European borders with Belarus. In another instance, we observed an executable named\n\"Благовещенск - Благовещенский Пограничный Отряд.exe\" roughly translating to \"Blagoveshchensk\n\n- Blagoveshchensk Border Guard Detachment.exe\", a report on the border detachment to\nBlagoveshchensk, a town located on the Sino-Russian border.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloader loads all the artifacts in the infection chain. All the artifacts are data files that need to be\ndecoded by the various infection components before being activated on the infected endpoint. There are\nfour components downloaded as part of the infection chain:\n\nThe first component is a decoy PDF masquerading as an official European Union report on the\nconflict in Ukraine and its effects on NATO countries. This document is not malicious and only\nserves to project authenticity and distract the victim.\nA benign executable that loads the third component — a malicious DLL-based loader — via the DLL\nsideloading technique. DLL sideloading involves tricking a benign process into loading a malicious\nDLL that disguises itself as legitimate.\nThe DLL loader responsible for decoding, loading and activating the final malicious implant, is also\na DLL. First, it reads a data file downloaded by the downloader binary from a hardcoded location on\ndisk and decodes the data file into a DLL. Then, the loader reflectively loads the final DLL-based\nimplant into the memory of the current process and runs it.\nA RAT called PlugX, Mustang Panda's malware of choice.\n\nDecoy document consisting of a report from the European Commission on the current security status of\nEU borders with Belarus.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe benign executable is executed on the endpoint using a command such as:\ncmd.exe /c ping.exe 8.8.8.8 -n 70&&\"%temp%\\FontEDL.exe\"\n\nThe executable is simply meant to load the DLL and call one of its exported APIs to activate its malicious\nfunctionality.\n\nExecutable loading the PlugX loader DLL.\n\n### Malicious DLL — PlugX loader\n\nThe malicious DLL is the actual loader for the PlugX implant downloaded by the initial downloader as a\nDAT file. This DLL is loaded into by the benign process and carries out the following actions:\n\nRead a data file downloaded earlier by the downloader binary from a hardcoded location.\nDecode the data file into a DLL.\nReflectively load the new DLL into the current process' memory and run it.\n\nThe new DLL is the actual PlugX implant.\n\nPlugX loader decodes and jumps to execute the actual implant DLL in memory.\n\nThe infection chain is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nToward the end of March 2022, however, the attackers made another update to their tactics. This time,\nthe downloader executable would use only two remote URLs to obtain all the components of the infection\nchain. While one URL would host the decoy document, the other URL hosts the benign exe, the implant\nloader DLL and the encrypted PlugX implant. Once the payloads are downloaded and decrypted, they are\nactivated using the same technique illustrated earlier — the EXE loads a DLL-based loader that decrypts\nthe final PlugX payload and deploys it. The themes used in these lures pertained to Europe with malicious\ndownloaders named \"Invitation letter_ECGFF_Frontex_WS_final_countersigned.exe\" and \"Latest\nanalyses of Russia's war on Ukraine.exe.\"\n\n## Archive-based infections\n\nWhile Mustang Panda recently began using downloader executables, the group continues to deliver their\nmalware via archive files consisting of a benign executable that loads and activates the accompanying\nmalware payload DLL, which they have done since at least 2019.\n\n### PlugX\n\nThroughout 2021, we observed the use of malicious archives containing an executable (loader), a DLLbased loader and an encrypted blob of data (DAT file) being delivered to targets. It's responsible for\ndecrypting the DAT file containing the PlugX implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe executable is typically executed via:\n\nSocial engineering: Disguising the initial executable as a legitimate document to trick the target into\nopening it, thereby starting the infection chain.\nShortcut file: A shortcut file that executes an intermediate component, such as a BAT file that runs\nthe executable.\n\nBAT file instrumenting the executable.\n\n### Bespoke stagers\n\nMustang Panda infections in late January 2022 resulted in the deployment of bespoke stagers that\ndownloaded additional shellcode from a remote location that would, in turn, be deployed on the infected\nendpoint.\n\nThe sager typically arrives in the form of an archive on the target's endpoint. The archive contains an\nexecutable that needs to be executed by the victims. Once executed, it loads the accompanying DLL,\nwhich is the key malicious component. The DLL is responsible for decoding an embedded blob of\nshellcode, which, when executed, acts as a stager that can download and execute additional shellcode\nfrom a C2 IP address.\n\nThis infection tactic has been heavily used by Mustang Panda in Asia. For example, in February 2022, in a\ncampaign targeting users from Southeast Asian countries, the group used an archive-file-based lure\n[masquerading as documents pertaining to the ASEAN Summit.](https://asean.org/about-us/asean-summit/)\n\nThe archive consists of an executable named \"ASEAN Leaders'Meeting.exe\" that loads the accompanying\nDLL-based implant. The executable is a legitimate copy of a component belonging to the KuGou Active\nDesktop application. It imports two exported APIs form the malicious PlugX DLL to activate the implant.\n\n**Stager analysis**\n\nThe stager begins by creating persistence for itself across reboots via the registry Run key using the\ncommand and living-off-the-land binaries and scripts (LoLBAS):\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v\nAmdesk /t REG_SZ /d \"Rundll32.exe SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL\n\"C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\active_desktop\\desktop_launcher.exe\"\" /f\n\n\n-----\n\nStager setting up persistence for itself.\n\nAdditionally, it will also set up persistence for itself to run every minute on the infected endpoint by\ncreating a Scheduled Task on the system using the command:\n\nC:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /F /Create /TN Microsoft_Desktop /sc minute /MO 1 /TR\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\active_desktop\\desktop_launcher.exe\n\nThe implant will then decode and activate the next shellcode via a new thread.\n\n\n-----\n\nShellcode decoding functionality interlaced with junk debug strings referencing Qihoo 360's HeliosTeam.\n\nThe shellcode decodes DLL and API names and resolves them for later use. The DLL names are hashed\nusing the ror13AddHash32 algorithm:\n\nImplant building API imports.\n\nThe implant will then collect the following information from the endpoint and send it to the C2:\n\nVolume serial number, which it obfuscates by adding 0x12345678. The final result is sent to C2.\nRetrieves the computer name and username and length.\nRetrieves the uptime of the host.\n\n\n-----\n\nImplant collecting system information to send to the C2.\n\nThe collected host info is RC4 encrypted before sending it over to the C2. The RC4 key used is (hex):78 5a\n12 4d 75 14 14 11 6c 02 71 15 5a 73 05 08 70 14 65 3b 64 42 22 23 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\nPre-encryption:\n\nFormat : 0x0A + <Encoded Volume serial number > + <uptime> + <hostname> + <username>\n\nPost-encryption:\n\nThe shellcode then attempts to connect to the C2 IP address to retrieve additional shellcode that can then\nbe executed on the infected endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nImplant's capability to receive more shellcode from the C2.\n\nExecution of downloaded shellcode on the endpoint.\n\nAnother type of stager employed by Mustang Panda, first seen in 2019 and still active as of December\n2021, binds itself locally to the infected endpoint and listens for any incoming requests. It only accepts\nincoming requests from a hardcoded C2 address and executes any shellcode received from the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nStager binding to local address for listening to incoming requests.\n\n### Meterpreter\n\nAnother type of stager used by Mustang Panda, some as recently as late 2021, are DLL-based implants\nthat decode and execute Meterpreter reverse-HTTP payloads to download and execute even more\npayloads from the C2. We observed this actor using Meterpreter dating back to 2019, when it was\n[deployed via malicious archives hosted on the Myanmar government's website. Meterpreter's use as an](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ff1dcab09f24a4c314af3ee829f80127e5b54f5be2a13e812617f77d0deeef57/relations)\nintermediate access mechanism continued at least into June 2021, with a brief lull, followed by the\nadoption of bespoke stagers in 2022.\n\n### Reverse shell\n\nIn late February 2022, the threat actors used another previously undisclosed Ukrainian-themed lure\nnamed\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Офіційна заява Апарату РНБО України\\Про введення в дію плану оборони України та Зведеного\nплану територіальної оброни України.exe\", which roughly translates to \"official statement from the\nNational Security and Defense Council of Ukraine.\"\n\nThis infection chain consisted of activating a simple, yet new, TCP-based reverse shell using cmd.exe as\nopposed to directly deploying the PlugX implant, stagers and Meterpreter seen in parallel infection chains\nfrom Mustang Panda.\n\nThe reverse shell DLL will copy itself and the executable responsible for loading it into a folder on a target\nmachine's disk, such as:\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\iloveukraine\\Microsoft_Silverlight.exe\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\iloveukraine\\kdump.dll\n\nThe implant is also responsible for setting up persistence on the system to ensure the reverse shell runs\nonce a minute via a scheduled task:\n\nC:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /F /Create /TN Microsoft_Silverlight /sc minute /MO 1 /TR\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\iloveukraine\\Microsoft_Silverlight.exe\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exe-based reverse shell created by the implant.\n\nReverse shell infection chain:\n\n## Shortcut files (LNK)\n\n[The use of shortcut files (LNK) has been a popular technique with Mustang Panda since at least 2019](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\nagainst entities in Asian countries. While the frequency of use of this tactic has reduced over the past\ncouple of years it is still seen being sporadically utilized by the threat actors. As late as March 2021, a\nshortcut file targeting users in Myanmar deployed Mustang Panda's Stager against their targets.\n\nThis shortcut file consists of a command to extract content from itself and execute as a BAT file:\n\n/c for %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do for /f \"delims==\" %i in ('dir \"%x\\2021-03-11.lnk\" /s /b') do (more +540\n/S %i |find \"PGL\">%public%\\gtgc.bat& %public%\\gtgc.bat)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BAT is responsible for extracting the next JavaScript payload and executing it via wscript.exe on the\nendpoint.\n\nThe JS code will extract an executable and a DLL-based stager to disk, followed by the execution of the\nexecutable, thus establishing persistence on the system and establishing communications with the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nJS extracting the DLL-based Stager and activating it via the EXE-based loader.\n\nLNK-based infection chain:\n\n## Maldocs\n\nIn some instances, we also observed the use of maldocs targeting Asian countries such as Taiwan to\ndeploy stagers that could execute meterpreter shellcode to communicate with the C2 server and execute\nthe next payloads on the infected system. The malicious macros contain two more components that are\ndropped to disk on the infected system. One component is a benign executable that is run by the macro to\nload the second component, a malicious DLL, which establishes persistence for the EXE and DLL via the\nregistry Run key.\n\n/C reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v Acerodp /t REG_SZ /d\n\"Rundll32.exe SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\win\\Acrobat.exe\"\" /f\n\nThen, the DLL executes the shellcode embedded in it — a meterpreter reverse HTTP shell to download\nand execute the next payload.\n\nExecutables embedded in the malicious macro.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe macro code for instrumenting the EXE and side-loaded DLL.\n\nIn one instance, the maldoc was named \"海污法修正草案.ppt\". This roughly translates to \"Draft\nAmendment to Marine Pollution Law\" consisting of a politically themed lure targeting Taiwanese\ngovernment entities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the years, Mustang Panda has evolved their tactics and implants to target a wide range of entities\nspanning multiple governments in three continents, including the European Union, the U.S., Asia and\npseudo allies such as Russia. By using summit- and conference-themed lures in Asia and Europe, this\nattacker aims to gain as much long-term access as possible to conduct espionage and information theft.\n\nApart from Mustang Panda's tool of choice, PlugX, we've observed a steady increase in the use of\n\n\n-----\n\nintermediate payloads such as a variety of stagers and reverse shells. The group has also continuously\nevolved its delivery mechanisms consisting of maldocs, shortcut files, malicious archives and more\nrecently seen downloaders starting with 2022. Mustang Panda is a highly motivated APT group relying\nprimarily on the use of topical lures and social engineering to trick victims into infecting themselves.\n\nIn-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in protecting\nagainst such a highly motivated set of threat actors.
