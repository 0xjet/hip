'We want to stop this hemorrhaging,' an official would later say,\" DART's\ncase study report reads.\n\n\"He’d been told the organization had an extensive system to prevent cyberattacks, but this\nnew virus evaded all their firewalls and antivirus software. Now, as they watched their\ncomputers blue-screen one by one, they didn’t have any idea what to do next.\"\n\nBased on what the official said following the incident, although not officially confirmed, the\nattack described by Microsoft's Detection and Response Team (DART) matches a malware\n[attack that impacted the city of Allentown, Pennsylvania in February 2018, as ZDNet first](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-how-one-emotet-infection-took-out-this-organizations-entire-network/)\nnoticed.\n\nAt the time, Mayor Ed Pawlowski said that the city had to pay nearly $1 million to Microsoft\nto clean out their systems, with an initial $185,000 emergency-response fee to contain the\n[malware and up to $900,000 in additional recovery costs, as first reported by The Morning](https://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-allentown-computer-virus-20180220-story.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nCall.\n\n## Emotet infection aftermath and containment procedures\n\n\"Officials announced that the virus threatened all of Fabrikam’s systems, even its 185surveillance camera network,\" DART's report [says.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6824919-Case-Study-Full-Operational-Shutdown-DART.html)\n\n\"Its finance department couldn’t complete any external banking transactions, and partner\norganizations couldn’t access any databases controlled by Fabrikam. It was chaos.\n\n\"They couldn’t tell whether an external cyberattack from a hacker caused the shutdown or if\nthey were dealing with an internal virus. It would have helped if they could have even\naccessed their network accounts.\n\n\"Emotet consumed the network’s bandwidth until using it for anything became practically\nimpossible. Even emails couldn’t wriggle through.\"\n\nMicrosoft's DART — a remote team and one that would deal with the attack on site — was\ncalled in eight days after the first device on Fabrikam's network was compromised.\n\nDART contained the Emotet infection using asset controls and buffer zones designed to\nisolate assets with admin privileges.\n\nThey eventually were able to completely eradicate the Emotet infection after uploading new\nantivirus signatures and deploying Microsoft Defender ATP and Azure ATP trials to detect\nand remove the malware.\n\nMicrosoft recommends using email filtering tools to automatically detect and stop phishing\nemails that spread the Emotet infection, as well as the adoption of multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA) to stop the attackers from taking advantage of stolen credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Emotet infection chain (CISA)**\n\n## Emotet infections can lead to severe outcomes\n\nEmotet, originally spotted as a banking Trojan in 2014, has evolved into a malware\nloader used by threat actors to install other malware families including but not limited to the\nTrickbot banking Trojan (a known vector used in the delivery of Ryuk ransomware\npayloads).\n\nEmotet was recently upgraded with a Wi-Fi worm module designed to help it spread to new\n[victims via nearby insecure wireless networks.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-hacks-nearby-wi-fi-networks-to-spread-to-new-victims/)\n\nRecently, in January 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\nwarned government and private organizations, as well as home users, of increasing activity\n[around targeted Emotet attacks.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/01/22/increased-emotet-malware-activity)\n\nIn November 2019, the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre\n(ACSC) also [warned of the dangers behind Emotet attacks, saying at the time that the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/australian-govt-warns-of-active-emotet-and-bluekeep-threats/)\nmalware \"provides an attacker with a foothold in a network from which additional attacks\ncan be performed, often leading to further compromise through the deployment of\nransomware.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nEmotet ranked first in a Top 10 most prevalent threats ranking published by interactive\nmalware analysis platform Any.Run at the end of December 2019, with triple the number of\nsample uploads submitted for analysis when compared to the next malware in the top, the\nAgent Tesla info-stealer.\n\nCISA provides general best practices to limit the effect of Emotet attacks and to contain\n[network infections within an Emotet Malware alert published two years ago and updated](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A)\nearlier this year.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure included](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/historic-hotel-stay-complementary-emotet-exposure-included/)\n\n[EmoCheck now detects new 64-bit versions of Emotet malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emocheck-now-detects-new-64-bit-versions-of-emotet-malware/)\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[Emotet malware infects users again after fixing broken installer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-infects-users-again-after-fixing-broken-installer/)\n\n[Emotet](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/emotet/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Microsoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
