Human operated ransomware attacks are\n[utilizing the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to exploit customers. #DearCry](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DearCry?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@MsftSecIntel](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[— Phillip Misner (@phillip_misner) March 12, 2021](https://twitter.com/phillip_misner/status/1370197696280027136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Today, McAfee's Head of Cyber Investigations John Fokker told BleepingComputer that](https://twitter.com/John_Fokker)\nthey are seeing victims in United States, Luxembourg, Indonesia, Ireland, India, and\nGermany.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Global DearCry heatmap of victims**\n\n**Source:** **[McAfee Insights](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-insights.html)**\nWhile the detections are still low, Fokker states that the detections are continuing to grow.\n\nAV vendors are currently detecting DearCry using a variety of generic ransomware\ndetections. Below we have listed the more specific detections:\n\nRansomware/Win.DoejoCrypt [AhnLab]\nWin32/Filecoder.DearCry.A [ESET]\nWin32.Trojan-Ransom.DearCry.B [GDATA]\nRansom-DearCry [McAfee]\nRansom:Win32/DoejoCrypt.A [Microsoft]\nRansom.DearCry [Rising]\nRansom/W32.DearCry [TACHYON]\nRansom.Win32.DEARCRY [TrendMicro]\nW32.Ransomware.Dearcry [Webroot]\n\n### How the DearCry ransomware encrypts computers\n\n[MalwareHunterTeam was able to find three samples of this ransomware on](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n[VirusTotal [1,](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2b9838da7edb0decd32b086e47a31e8f5733b5981ad8247a2f9508e232589bff/detection) [2,](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e044d9f2d0f1260c3f4a543a1e67f33fcac265be114a1b135fd575b860d2b8c6/detection) [3], with addition hashes below, all of which are MingW-compiled](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/feb3e6d30ba573ba23f3bd1291ca173b7879706d1fe039c34d53a4fdcdf33ede/detection)\nexecutables. The one analyzed by BleepingComputer includes the following PDB path:\n```\nC:\\Users\\john\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\EncryptFile svcV2\\Release\\EncryptFile.exe.pdb\n\n```\nWhen launched, the DearCry ransomware will create a Windows service named 'msupdate'\nthat is started to perform the encryption. This Windows service is later removed when the\nencryption process is finished.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware will now begin to encrypt files on the computer if they match the following\nextensions:\n```\n.TIF .TIFF .PDF .XLS .XLSX .XLTM .PS .PPS .PPT .PPTX .DOC .DOCX .LOG .MSG .RTF .TEX\n.TXT .CAD .WPS .EML .INI .CSS .HTM .HTML .XHTML .JS .JSP .PHP .KEYCHAIN .PEM .SQL\n.APK .APP .BAT .CGI .ASPX .CER .CFM .C .CPP .GO .CONFIG .PL .PY .DWG .XML .JPG .BMP\n.PNG .EXE .DLL .CAD .AVI .H.CSV .DAT .ISO .PST .PGD .7Z .RAR .ZIP .ZIPX .TAR .PDB\n.BIN .DB .MDB .MDF .BAK .LOG .EDB .STM .DBF .ORA .GPG .EDB .MFS\n\n```\nWhen encrypting files, it will append the .CRYPT extension to the file's name, as shown\nbelow.\n\n**DearCry encrypted files**\nEmbedded in each sample of DearCry is a public RSA-2048 key.\n\n**Embedded public RSA key**\n\n\n-----\n\nGillespie told BleepingComputer that the ransomware uses AES-256 to encrypt the files and\nthe RSA-2048 public key to encrypt the AES key. The ransomware will also prepends the\n'DEARCRY!' string to the beginning of each encrypted file.\n\n**DEARCRY**\n\n**file marker in encrypted file**\nWhen done encrypting the computer, the ransomware will create a simple ransom note\nnamed 'readme.txt' on the Windows desktop. This ransom note contains two email\naddresses for the threat actors and a unique hash, which Gillespie states is an MD4 hash of\nthe RSA public key embedded in the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DearCry ransom note**\nFor at least one of the victims, the ransomware group demanded a $16,000 ransom.\n\nUnfortunately, the ransomware does not appear to have any weaknesses that would allow\nvictims to recover their files for free.\n\n## Patch now!\n\nAccording to new data shared by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks with\nBleepingComputer, tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers have been patched\nover the last three days.\n\nUnfortunately, Palo Alto Networks states that there are still approximately 80,000 older\nservers that cannot directly apply the recent security updates.\n\n“I’ve never seen security patch rates this high for any system, much less one as widely\ndeployed as Microsoft Exchange,” said Matt Kraning, Chief Technology Officer, Cortex at\n[Palo Alto Networks. “Still, we urge organizations running all versions of Exchange to](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/)\nassume they were compromised before they patched their systems, because we know\nattackers were exploiting these zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild for at least two months\nbefore Microsoft released the patches on March 2.”\n\nAll organizations are strongly advised to apply the patches as soon as possible and to\ncreate offline backups of their Exchange servers.\n\nNot only to protect your mailboxes from being stolen but now to prevent them from being\nencrypted.\n\n## DearCry / DoejoCrypt IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n### Associated DearCry hashes:\n```\nSHA256: 2b9838da7edb0decd32b086e47a31e8f5733b5981ad8247a2f9508e232589bff\nSHA256: e044d9f2d0f1260c3f4a543a1e67f33fcac265be114a1b135fd575b860d2b8c6\nSHA256: feb3e6d30ba573ba23f3bd1291ca173b7879706d1fe039c34d53a4fdcdf33ede\nSHA256: FDEC933CA1DD1387D970EEEA32CE5D1F87940DFB6A403AB5FC149813726CBD65\nSHA256: 10BCE0FF6597F347C3CCA8363B7C81A8BFF52D2FF81245CD1E66A6E11AEB25DA\n\n Associated DearCry file names:\nreadme.txt\n\n Associated DearCry emails:\nkonedieyp@airmail.cc\nuenwonken@memail.com\n\n DearCry ransom note text:\nYour file has been encrypted!\nIf you want to decrypt, please contact us.\nkonedieyp@airmail.cc or uenwonken@memail.com\nAnd please send me the following hash!\n[victim id]\n\n```\n_Update 3/11/21: Updated article after confirmation from Microsoft that it is installed via_\nProxyLogon vulnerabilities.
