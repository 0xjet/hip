In past iterations, this information stealer has used exploit kits such as\nRigEK and Fallout EK to gain access to vulnerable machines.\n\nAmadey is a criminal-to-criminal (C2C) botnet infostealer project, meaning it is a service\nmade available on the black market by criminals, for purchase by other criminals. It was first\n[discovered in 2018, and highlighted by the BlackBerry Threat Research Team in 2020. While](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/01/threat-spotlight-amadey-bot)\nit is primarily used for collecting information about a victim’s computing environment, it can\nalso be used to deliver additional malicious modules.\n\nRecently, Amadey has been observed using SmokeLoader loader malware to spread a new\nand highly aggressive Amadey Bot variant. Threat actors have concealed the loader in\n“cracked” software and keygen (key generator) sites, which offer the lure of providing illicit\nfree access to licensed software. The SmokeLoader family has been actively relying on this\nscheme for transmission since at least the beginning of this year.\n\n## Amadey Information Stealing Methods\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter Amadey completes its initial setup processes, it connects to a remote, attackercontrolled command-and-control (C2) server. It then downloads a plugin to collect system,\napplication, and antivirus (AV) information from the victim’s machine. This information allows\nthe threat actor to identify both sensitive information for exfiltration as well as details of any\nantivirus tools on the system, so they can be evaded.\n\nThis recent version of the infostealer includes enhanced features compared to its\npredecessor. These include:\n\nScheduled tasks for persistence\nAdvanced reconnaissance options\nUser account control (UAC) bypassing\nTailored defense evasion strategies\n\nAfter attackers have successfully breached a system, they then have the opportunity to\ninstall additional malicious components.\n\n## Amadey and SmokeLoader Connection\n\nThe BlackBerry Threat Research Team has observed SmokeLoader being hidden in cracks\nand keygens for several brands of popular software applications. The threat actor behind it\nhas been relying on black SEO to seed malicious results to get prime placement at the top of\nsearch engine results, so those seeking cracks can easily find these Trojanized files to\ndownload and run.\n\nSince it’s publicly known that some AV vendors may block cracks and keygens, some people\nexplicitly disable their endpoint security products before downloading these files, or they\nignore detection alerts and proceed with the download. So even if the sample is widely\ndetected, there is room for a successful infection, due to the victim specifically allowing it.\n\nSmokeLoader has been very active of late. According to telemetry monitored by BlackBerry,\nmost targets are in the United States, followed by Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. Over 25,000\ndifferent SmokeLoader samples have been observed in our telemetry during the past three\nmonths.\n\nIt’s notable that a quarter of all attempts to infect have hit targets in the healthcare industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – “Industries most targeted by SmokeLoader worldwide”_\n\n## BlackBerry Stops SmokeLoader and Amadey\n\n[Customers using CylancePROTECT® are protected from SmokeLoader and Amadey](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security/cylance-protect)\naugmented by SmokeLoader.\n\nTo combat this highly effective and infectious malware variant, BlackBerry recommends\nusing artificial intelligence-based agents trained for threat detection on millions of both safe\nand unsafe files. For example, BlackBerry’s [Cylance® AI uses automated security agents to](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security/cylance-ai)\nblock Amadey based on numerous file attributes and malicious behaviors, rather than relying\non a specific file signature.\n\n### About CylancePROTECT\n\n_CylancePROTECT is an endpoint protection platform (EPP) from BlackBerry that employs_\n_Cylance AI’s advanced, seventh-generation, machine learning models to provide a predictive_\n_advantage against both zero-day threats and legacy cyberattacks._\n\n**Related Reading**\n\n\n-----\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats,\nproviding intelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\n\n-----",
