It](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/services/esc/)\ncontained a link to previously unknown malware. Our experts discovered the same malware in 2020 when investigating an information\nsecurity incident at a Russian government agency. During the investigation, several new malware families using a common network\ninfrastructure were also discovered, some of which had not previously been mentioned in open sources.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, [PT ESC revealed traces of compromise of another Russian aerospace enterprise. The organization was duly informed.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/services/esc/)\nAs a result of the investigation, we found connections to the same network infrastructure on its computers. Further research made it possible to\nidentify at least two more organizations in Russia, both partially state-owned, that were attacked using the same malware and network\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe could not unambiguously link the detected malicious activity to any known hacker group, so we gave the attackers a new name—Space\nPirates. The reason for the name was the P1Rat string used in the PDB paths, and the targeting of the aerospace industry. This report describes\nthe group's detected activity, the features of the malware it uses, as well as its connection with other APT groups.\n\n## General information\n\nWe assume that Space Pirates has Asian roots, as indicated by the active use of the Chinese language in resources, SFX archives, and paths to\nPDB files. In addition, the group's toolkit includes the Royal Road RTF (or 8.t) builder (common among hackers of Asian origin) and the\nPcShare backdoor, and almost all intersections with previously known activity are associated with APT groups in the Asian region.\n\nThe group began its activity no later than 2017. The main targets of the criminals are espionage and theft of confidential information. Among\nthe victims identified during the threat study are government agencies and IT departments, as well as aerospace and power enterprises in\nRussia, Georgia, and Mongolia. At least five organizations were attacked in Russia, one in Georgia, and the exact number of victims in\nMongolia is unknown.\n\nSome APT group attacks using malware were also targeted at Chinese financial companies, which suggests a monetary motivation. All potential\nvictims were notified by the respective national CERTs.\n\nAt least two attacks on Russian organizations can be considered successful. In the first case, the attackers gained access to at least 20 servers on\nthe corporate network, where they remained for about 10 months. During this time, more than 1,500 internal documents were stolen, as well as\ninformation about all employee accounts in one of the network domains. In the second case, the attackers managed to gain persistence in the\ncompany's network and remain there for more than a year, obtain information about the computers on the network, and install malware on at\nleast 12 corporate nodes in three different regions.\n\nThe Space Pirates toolkit includes unique downloaders and several backdoors which we have not previously encountered and which are\npresumably specific to the group: MyKLoadClient, BH_A006, and Deed RAT. The criminals also have access to the Zupdax backdoor: its\nmodern variants use a similar MyKLoadClient execution scheme; however, the code of the backdoor itself dates back to 2010 and cannot be\nuniquely attributed to the group.\n\nIn addition, the attackers use well-known malware, such as PlugX, ShadowPad, Poison Ivy, a modified version of PcShare, and the public shell\n[ReVBShell. The](https://github.com/bitsadmin/ReVBShell) [dog-tunnel utility is used to tunnel traffic.](https://github.com/vzex/dog-tunnel)\n\nThe main network infrastructure of the group uses a small number of IP addresses indicated by DDNS domains. Interestingly, the attackers use\nnot only third-level domains, but also fourth- and higher-level ones, for example, w.asd3.as.amazon-corp.wikaba.com.\n\nIn the process of investigating Space Pirates, we found a large number of intersections with previously identified activity, which researchers\nassociate with the following groups: Winnti (APT41), Bronze Union (APT27), TA428, RedFoxtrot, Mustang Panda, and Night Dragon. The\nreason for this is probably the exchange of tools between groups, which is common practice for APT groups in the Asian region.\n\nThe connection between the Space Pirates and TA428 groups should be specially noted. As part of another investigation, we observed the\nactivities of both groups on infected computers, which, however, had no intersections in the network infrastructure. During Operation\n[StealthyTrident, described by ESET, the attackers used Tmanger, attributed to TA428, and Zupdax, associated with Space Pirates. The](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\nconnection with another TA428 malware, in particular Albaniiutas (RemShell), and Zupdax can also be traced in the network infrastructure\nadjacent to the one mentioned in the ESET report. All this suggests that Space Pirates and TA428 can combine their efforts and share tools,\nnetwork resources, and access to infected systems.\n\nThe key connections between the affected organizations, malware families, and fragments of the network infrastructure, as well as public\ninformation about the attackers, can be seen in Figure 1. Later in the report, we will give more details about them.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Key connections\n\n## Analysis of malware and tools\n\n### MyKLoadClient\n\nThis malware was used in attacks on Russian organizations, including government agencies and aerospace enterprises, often being distributed\nthrough targeted phishing. The email analysis shows that Chinese companies providing financial services also became victims.\n\nAmong the malware samples with MyKLoadClient that we found, two typical implementation schemes can be distinguished. The first\n(hereinafter scheme 1) is based on the use of SFX archives as droppers, implements the DLL Side-Loading technique, and uses an auxiliary\nlauncher library AntiVirusLoader.dll. The second (hereinafter scheme 2) includes only a custom-written dropper which transfers control to the\npayload directly. In the second case, gaining persistence in the system is not a feature of the code.\n\nNote that, according to the known data, there is a clear relationship between the attackers' goals and the choice of implementation scheme:\nsamples using scheme 1 were targeted at Russian organizations, whereas scheme 2 was used in attacks on Chinese companies. If we rely on the\ndates of modification and compilation of files (which, however, could be spoofed), the same division can be traced back in time: scheme 1 was\npresumably used in 2018–2019, and scheme 2 in 2020. It is possible that the attackers updated the implementation chain of the previous\nmalware to reduce the likelihood of its detection in new attacks.\n\n**Scheme 1**\n\nA typical example of a sample with the first implementation scheme is a file named Петербургский международный экономический форум\n_(ПМЭФ)____2019.exe (Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF)____2019.exe) with SHA-256_\nd3a50abae9ab782b293d7e06c7cd518bbcec16df867f2bdcc106dec1e75dc80b. The file is an SFX archive that extracts the decoy document\n0417.doc and another SFX archive named apple.exe. The files in the archive were modified in April 2019. The document contains a text with a\ntrue description of SPIEF.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Contents of the decoy document 0417.doc\n\nThe second SFX archive extracts three PE files from itself: the legitimate siteadv.exe, the launcher siteadv.dll, and the library with payload\ncc.tmp. Note that in the samples studied, the first implementation scheme does not always use a decoy. However, in all cases, a similar SFX\narchive is used, which contains files with the same names and purpose.\n\nFigure 3. Contents of the apple.exe archive\n\nThe executable EXE file is signed by McAfee, Inc. and is a component of the McAfee SiteAdvisor installer. At startup, it loads the siteadv.dll\nlibrary, which is responsible for installing and launching the payload. The launcher resources feature a configuration encrypted with RC4 with\nkey \"TDILocker\" and containing the necessary paths, registry key names, and flags.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Siteadv.dll code fragment\n\nThe launcher provides several possible commands that are passed by way of command-line arguments and are responsible for one of the\nimplementation stages:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nstat The command to start the installation. Restarts the process in which the library is loaded (siteadv.exe) with the install_del\ncommand. Additionally passes the path to the parent process.\n\ninstall_del Gains persistence on the infected computer (the registry key is specified in the configuration). In this case, the path to the\nsiteadv.exe file is used with the run or mrun argument. Deletes the file specified by the third argument (the path to the parent\nprocess). Launches the payload in the same way as the run command.\n\nrun Loads a DLL with payload via LoadLibrary and executes the function exported from it (the name is specified in the\nconfiguration).\n\nmrun Not implemented.\n\nins Not implemented.\n\nIn addition to the exported function main, which is called by the legitimate siteadv.exe, in siteadv.dll there is an unused buc_uninstallinterface\n[export that is responsible for bypassing the UAC using the IARPUninstallStringLauncher component.](https://3gstudent.github.io/backup-3gstudent.github.io/%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87COM%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6IARPUninstallStringLauncher%E7%BB%95%E8%BF%87UAC/)\n\nThe launcher library has the export name AntiVirusLoader.dll. In some of its instances, you can find the PDB path:\nD:\\Leee\\515远程文件\\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\\src\\MyLoader_bypassKIS\\snake\\res\\SiteAdv.pdb.\n\nThe cc.tmp payload is a backdoor implemented as a dynamic library with the internal name client.dll. It exports the MyKLoad function, which\nis the actual entry point. We will consider the functionality of the backdoor below.\n\n**Scheme 2**\n\nThe executable file responsible for extracting the decoy and payload acts as a dropper in the second scheme. The binary data is located in the\nbody of the dropper and is XOR-encrypted with a single-byte key. In addition to the standard launch of the extracted payload via the\nCreateProcess call, the dropper also performs reflective loading and execution of the EXE file directly in the current process.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Fragment of the dropper code\n\n[In some cases, the dropper functions are additionally obfuscated using the control flow flattening technique.](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening)\n\nAs a decoy, the investigated samples use a PDF document containing a message about a\n\"corrupt file\" in the Chinese language, or an application stub that displays the message\n\"正在更新浏览器插件，请稍后…\" (The browser plugin is updating, please wait ...) and\n\"更新完毕，请重启浏览器！\" (The update is completed, restart the browser!).\n\nFigure 6. Obfuscated version of the dropper\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. PDF decoy with the text \"Corrupt or incompatible file\"\n\nThe payload in this case is an executable file with the internal name client.exe. Some samples also have the PDB path\nC:\\Users\\classone\\Desktop\\src\\client\\exe_debug\\client.pdb.\n\n**Test sample**\n\nWe also managed to find a test version of the malware created no later than in 2018:\nb1d6ba4d995061a0011cb03cd821aaa79f0a45ba2647885171d473ca1a38c098. This application is a dropper.\n\nInterestingly, it seems to have been created based on the Snake game. This is indicated by several details:\n\nWhen launched, the application creates a window using the string \"Snake\" as its name.\nThere is code presumably responsible for the game logic—in particular, for generating random coordinates of pieces of food on the 50×50\nfield and comparing them with the position of the snake.\nThe application handles presses of the spacebar and cursor keys.\nThe application features a menu with items in Chinese: Start, Pause, Restart, and Quit.\n\nIn addition, among the dropper resources there is also an \"About the program\" window (in Chinese), the content\nof which indicates that this is the second version of the Snake game, which was created in 2016. The email\naddress of the probable author is also given: mexbochen@foxmail.com.\n\nFigure 8. Application menu\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. \"About the program\" window\n\nA Google search for the address throws up the profile of the email owner—a programmer from China who specializes in image processing.\n\nFigure 10. Business card website with the contact address mexbochen@foxmail.com\n\nDespite the connection between the application and the owner of the email, it is impossible to say unequivocally that he is the author of the\nmalware. It is possible that Snake was once an open-source project, and the attackers used it as a basis for implementing the dropper.\n\nThe files extracted by the dropper are contained in its resources in cleartext. Also in the resources is an encrypted configuration that contains\nthe file names—exactly the same configuration is used in the launcher. When files are written to disk, their contents are XOR-encrypted with\nthe 0x80 key, and then the files are reopened and decrypted. The dropper contains the same set of components as SFX archives (scheme 1): a\nlegitimate McAfee SiteAdvisor component, a DLL launcher, and a library with a payload named Client.obj.\n\nAfter extraction, the dropper generates a command line to run the launcher with the install command (for persistence in the registry and\nlaunching the payload), but does not make further use of it. This is probably an error: there is the debug message \"CreateProcess success!\" in\nthe code, but the CreateProcess function is not called.\n\nThe launcher of the test sample differs in its implementation of the mrun command: a variation of the run command responsible for launching\nthe function exported from the DLL with payload. Unlike run, mrun predecrypts the library using the RC4 algorithm with key\n\"GoogleMailData\" and uses reflective loading for its execution.\n\nThe payload of Client.obj is similar to cc.tmp (scheme 1) and has only minor differences. In particular, the entry point function exported by the\nlibrary is called \"main\", which, when run, displays a message box with the text \"just a demo for test!!!\" In addition, the backdoor configuration\nis not encrypted and contains the test C2 127 0 0 1\n\n\n-----\n\n**y**\n\nOptions for implementing the backdoor in the form of the executable file client.exe and the library client.dll have the same functionality.\nHowever, they differ in how they initialize the structure with configuration parameters, which include the address and port of the C2, the\nbackdoor activity flag, as well as the string IDs of the malware sent to the C2.\n\nIn the client.dll library, just like in the launcher (scheme 1), there is a configuration encrypted with RC4 key \"GoogleMailData\" in the payload\nresources. In the EXE version, the structure is filled with values fixed in the code.\n\nThe following table lists the backdoor samples we found and the data specified in their configuration, namely the IDs and the control server.\nThe \"?\" sign means that the string is a random set of bytes.\n\n**SHA-256 of the payload** **Scheme** **ID1** **ID2** **ID3** **C2**\n\n5847c8b8f54c60db939b045d385aba0795880d92b00d28447d7d9293693f622b 1 pwd my vps group 127.0.0.1\n\n56b9648fd3ffd1bf3cb030cb64c1d983fcd1ee047bb6bd97f32edbe692fa8570 1 pwd my vps ? 207.148.121.88\n\nd0fb0a0379248cdada356da83cd2ee364e0e58f4ed272d3369fe1d6ca8029679 1 pwd my vps ? 207.148.121.88\n\n7b7a65c314125692524d588553da7f6ab3179ceb639f677ed1cefe3f1d03f36e 1 pwd my vps ? 207.148.121.88\n\n3ccae178d691fc95f6c52264242a39daf4c44813d835eaa051e7558b191d19ee 1 pwd my vps ? 207.148.121.88\n\n69863ba336156f4e559364b63a39f16e08ac3a6e3a0fa4ce11486ea16827f772 1 pwd my vps ? micro.dns04.com\n\n949cb5d03a7952ce24b15d6fccd44f9ed461513209ad74e6b1efae01879395b1 1 pwd my vps ? microft.dynssl.com\n\nfa3ecd74b9f329a96b5739bba7b1872ef1ab84bb95f89101a69b6b6e780e2063 - pwd memo group 47.108.89.169\n\n84eb2efa324eba0c2e06c3b84395e9f5e3f28a3c9b86edd1f813807ba39d9acb 2 pwd memo group 47.108.89.169\n\nb822a4ec46aacb3bb4c22fe5d9298210bfa442118ee05a1532c324a5f847a9e6 2 gundan memo group 120.78.127.189\n\n944a3c8293ff068d803f8537b15e6adbad7fa1e789f3dc404ba603a8cb7c22aa 2 gundan memo group 121.89.210.144\n\nThe connection to the control server is established over TCP, and the traffic is not encrypted.

If the key is already in the registry, then the existing ID is\nused.\n\n### Zupdax\n\n[The first public mention of this malware can be found in the Unit 42 report on HenBox, a malicious application for Android. In the HenBox](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/)\nnetwork infrastructure, researchers found traces of the use of malware of the PlugX, Zupdax, 9002 RAT, and Poison Ivy families. In 2019, Unit\n42 [combined three years of observed activity related to the above-mentioned set of malware, naming the group (or groups) behind it PKPLUG.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pkplug_chinese_cyber_espionage_group_attacking_asia/)\n\nIn 2020, ESET [discovered traces of an attack on the Able Soft LLC supply chain. One of the attack options was to compromise the Able Desktop](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\ninstaller by adding malicious code to it. The researchers cite the HyperBro and Korplug (PlugX) backdoors as the payload built into the\ninstallers.\n\nAccording to available data, we can say that the payload designated by ESET as Korplug is in fact a Zupdax backdoor. This opinion is shared by\n[NortonLifeLock and Avira analysts, who published a report in the fall of 2021 describing the main features of Zupdax.](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/sites/default/files/2021-10/OPERATION%20EXORCIST%20White%20Paper.pdf)\n\nZupdax has been operating since 2014 at least. Our study focused on 2017–2019 samples, but some details can only be traced in earlier\nversions (2014–2015). We will be referring to them as \"old\".\n\nThe latest versions of Zupdax use the same loading scheme as in the MyKLoadClient test sample. Although there is no Snake game code in\nthem, the main functionality of the dropper is implemented in a similar way: in its resources are the legitimate siteadv.exe, a launcher library, a\npayload, and a XOR-encrypted configuration with file names and flags. The launcher uses exactly the same configuration.\n\nUnlike MyKLoadClient, in almost all samples with Zupdax, the payload (which is extracted under the name ok.obj) is encrypted and launched\nusing the mrun method. Among the launcher samples that are used in conjunction with Zupdax, you can find more functional options that\nsupport UAC bypass (in particular, using buc_uninstallinterface export) and persistence as a service.\n\nIn the dropper and launcher samples are the corresponding PDB paths:\n\nd:\\Leee\\515远程文件\\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\\src\\MyLoaderBypassNorton\\Release\\loaderexe.pdb and\n\nd:\\Leee\\515远程文件\\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\\src\\MyLoader_bypassKIS\\snake\\res\\SiteAdv.pdb.\n\nMalware variants related to the attack on Able Desktop users also contain a PDB with a similar string, MyLoader_bypassKIS:\n\nc:\\Users\\PC-2015\\Desktop\\Badger\\En-v2\\免杀\\MyLoader_bypassKIS\\bin\\loaderdll.pdb.\n\nInterestingly, there is at least one sample (a95dfb8a8d03e9bcb50451068773cc1f1dd4b022bb39dce3679f1b3ce70aa4f9) that is completely\nidentical to the test version of MyKLoadClient and contains exactly the same \"About the program\" window. The payload in it is a Zupdax\nbackdoor.\n\n**Payload**\n\n[For network interaction with C2, the backdoor uses the UDT protocol, which implements data transfer over UDP. The messages have a header](https://udt.sourceforge.io/)\nwith a structure similar to that used in MyKLoadClient. The only difference is the value of the first field equal to 0x12345678:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  _DWORD Magic; // 0x12345678\n  _DWORD CommandId;\n  _DWORD PayloadSize;\n  _DWORD Unknown; // 0\n};\n\n```\nImmediately after establishing a connection with C2, the backdoor collects and sends information about the system, including the computer\nname, user name, OS version, information about disk volume, RAM, and CPU, as well as the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter.\nThe collected information is sent with the 0x1 command ID.\n\nThe set of commands that the backdoor can handle does not change significantly from version to version: its main features are reduced to the\nexecution of additional code that it can get from the control server. Older versions of Zupdax contain debug messages that allow you to see the\noriginal names of operations:\n\n**ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n0x0 CMD_END Shut down the backdoor or restart it (depending on the version)\n\n0x17 CMD_SET_REM Write a new control server to the file (transmitted in the message)\n\n0x19 CMD_UNINSTALL_HOST Perform self-removal from the system\n\n0x28 CMD_TRANSMISSION_PLUGIN Get the plugin name from C2 and run it (the plugin can be a shellcode or an EXE file)\nIf the necessary plugin is not available on the disk, first get it from C2. (Present only\nin old versions)\n\n0x29 CMD_PLUGIN_TRANSMISSION_EXECUTE Get the plugin ID from C2 and launch its entry point (the plugins are stored in\nmemory). If the plugin is not in memory, first get the PE file from the control server\nand reflectively load the exported function from it. (In old versions, it is the same as\nCMD_TRANSMISSION_PLUGIN)\n\n0x38 CMD_UPDATE Download the EXE file from the specified link, save it to disk, and execute it.\n\n0x68 Run the executable file at a fixed path under the name of the current user. The path is\nequal to C:\\ProgramData\\AdobeBak\\avanti.exe. (Present only in the latest versions)\n\n0x77 CMD_ADD_STARTUP See CMD_TRANSMISSION_PLUGIN\n\nOld Zupdax samples also have paths to PDB files:\nh:\\E\\项目问题\\UDPUDP-英文\\bin\\server.pdb\nd:\\磁盘\\E\\项目问题\\版本\\UDPUDP-英文\\bin\\server.pdb\n\nIt follows from them that the original name of the project can be translated as \"UDPUDP-English.\"\n\n**Connection with Redsip**\n\nIn 2011, McAfee described a series of attacks on energy companies that was named Night Dragon. Among the malware used by the attackers\nwas a Redsip backdoor (e3165c2691dc27ddaeb21e007f2bf5aeb14ef3e12ec007938e104d6aed512f39).\n\nApparently, Zupdax is a redesigned version of Redsip. Backdoors, in particular, have an identical structure of network messages (including the\nmagic constant 0x12345678), matching command names and identifiers (CMD_SET_REM and CMD_UNINSTALL_HOST), and similar\ndebug messages. In both cases, the payload is implemented through external plugins.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Fragment of the Redsip code (2010 sample)\n\nFigure 12. Zupdax code fragment (2015 sample)\n\nNote that in 2018 Redsip was used in an attack on a Russian organization associated with the aerospace industry. The attackers used a leaked\ncorporate document as a decoy. We could not find a direct connection between this attack and the activities of Space Pirates.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Internal document used as a decoy\n\n**Connection with Winnti and FF-RAT**\n\nSome Zupdax samples have valid digital signatures. In particular, sample\n24b749191d64ed793cb9e540e8d4b1808d6c37c5712e737674417573778f665b (upinstall.bat) is signed with a YD Online Corp. certificate, and\n84b8bfe8161da581a88c0ac362318827d4c28edb057e23402523d3c93a5b3429 (Slack.exe) is signed with a NFINITY GAMES BILISIM\nANONIM SIRKET certificate.\n\n[Among the files signed with these certificates are components of the PipeMon malware, which is attributed to the Winnti group. Studying the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/21/no-game-over-winnti-group/)\nnetwork infrastructure of the second sample, we also noted the presence of indirect connections with the old Winnti infrastructure, but they\nrequire additional confirmation.\n\nHowever, in the case of Slack.exe, we can state the presence of reliable infrastructure connections with the FF-RAT backdoor, which was\n[described by BlackBerry in 2017. So, both the Zupdax sample and the FF-RAT samples use playdr2.com and gamepoer7.com subdomains as](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2017/06/breaking-down-ff-rat-malware)\nC2.\n\n**Connections with Bronze Union and TA428**\n\n[ESET's previously mentioned report Operation StealthyTrident: corporate software under attack on the compromise of Able Desktop notes the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\npresence of HyperBro and Zupdax backdoors (Korplug according to ESET), as well as Tmanger and ShadowPad as part of a single\ncybercriminal operation. The researchers give several possible explanations for this connection. We were able to identify several additional\nfacts that give more information about the connections between the Bronze Union (LuckyMouse, APT27) and TA428 groups and Zupdax\nmalware.\n\n**Code intersections**\n\nThe Zupdax sample from the ESET report contains a dropper that is standard for this malware (data1.dat,\n2486734ebe5a7fa6278ce6358d995d4546eb28917f8f50b01d8fdd7a1f9627a4), extracting the payload from resources. Of interest is the scheme\nby which it gains control: it side-loads the pcalocalresloader.dll library, which contains a shellcode that decrypts and executes another\n\n\n-----\n\ns e code o t e t u b.db e. e seco d s e code co ta s a b a y co p essed us g t e N a go t, w c t e ect ve y\nloads into memory.\n\nFigure 14. Fragment of the ESET report\n\nBoth shellcodes use an atypical hashing algorithm for the names of imported libraries and functions (see Figure 15). For example, kernel32.dll\nhas the hash 0xD4E88, and ntdll.dll 0x1B708. However, a search for similar samples showed that similar shellcodes can be found in various\n[malware families—for example, in SmokeLoader or in](https://n1ght-w0lf.github.io/malware%20analysis/smokeloader/#shellcode) [exploits for InPage. It is likely that a builder available to various hacker groups was used](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-recent-inpage-exploits-lead-multiple-malware-families/)\nto create the shellcodes.\n\nHowever, the whole scheme, including the legitimate component IntgStat.exe,\npcalocalresloader.dll library, and the encrypted file thumb.db, was used in this form only to\n[download the HyperBro backdoor, as described by Kaspersky. The only difference is that in the](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\ncase of Able Desktop, shikata_ga_nai obfuscation was not applied.\n\nAn auxiliary DLL located in thumb.db handles the simultaneous launch of the dropper (data1.dat)\nand the legitimate Able Desktop installer. It is distinguished by the presence of a large number of\nunused strings in the data section. Some of them are specific only to samples of the HyperBro\nbackdoor:\n\n```\nElevation:Administrator!new:{FCC74B77-EC3E-4dd8-A80B-008A702075A9}\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Uninstall\\\\test\nsystem-%d\nCreateProcessAsUser error %d\n\\\\..\\\\config.ini\nWin2008(R2)\nWin2012(R2)\n\n```\n\nFigure 15. Hash function in auxiliary shellcodes\n\n\nAs follows from the ESET report and our research, the criminals behind the attack on Able Desktop users have access to both HyperBro and\nZupdax. However, most of the code features are specific to the HyperBro backdoor, which, in turn, is attributed to the Bronze Union group.\n\n**Network intersections**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Fragment of the Zupdax network infrastructure\n\nOne of the Zupdax samples (ffe19202300785f7e745957b48ecc1c108157a6edef6755667a9e7bebcbf750b) uses flashplayeractivex.info\nsubdomains, such as update.flashplayeractivex.info and news.flashplayeractivex.info, as C2. For some time in August 2020, these domains\nresolved to the IP address 209.250.239.96. At the same time, the go.vegispaceshop.org domain was present at the same IP address.\n\n[The latter domain, along with the IP address, can be found in the NTT Security report on the Albaniiutas malware from the TA428 toolkit. As](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102gkfp/pandas-new-arsenal-part-2-albaniiutas)\n[the detailed analysis of Albaniiutas samples by our colleagues from Group-IB shows, this malware is a new version of the RemShell backdoor](https://blog.group-ib.com/task)\n(BlueTraveller) [previously identified by PT ESC.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/Operation-Taskmasters-2019-eng.pdf)\n\nAnother domain appearing at the IP address 209.250.239.96 at the same time is nameserver.datacertsecure.info. The datacertsecure.info and\ncheck.datacertsecure.info domains obviously associated with it resolved to the IP address 139.180.208.225 from June to July 2020. The node\n[simultaneously became known as the HyperBro backdoor control server, and was mentioned by ESET in Operation StealthyTrident.](https://twitter.com/vishnyak0v/status/1287308019336990720)\n\nThese connections further unite the attackers' goals: the compromised Able Desktop installers, as well as the above-mentioned samples of\nAlbaniiutas and HyperBro, were used in attacks on organizations in Mongolia.\n\n### Downloaders\n\nIn the Space Pirates network infrastructure, we found two types of downloaders containing decoys with Russian text. One of them was also\nfound in the network of our client, who was attacked by criminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Example of a decoy document\n\n**Downloader.Climax.A**\n\n[The first downloader differs by the use of parts of the source code of the Rovnix bootkit (it was described in detail by Kaspersky). Note that,](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\naccording to our data, the network indicators listed in the report, in particular the bamo.ocry.com domain, as well as IP addresses\n45.77.244.191 and 45.76.145.22, are part of the Space Pirates network infrastructure.\n\nWe have no information about what malware was delivered by this downloader. However, researchers from Kaspersky managed to identify\nlikely samples based on the similarity of PDB paths and identical control servers.\n\nFigure 18. Fragment of the Kaspersky report\n\nIn the screenshots of the payload presented in the report, you can notice a specific technique for storing strings: they are all in one data block\nand indexed by numbers with the prefix \"PS_\". This technique is found in the code of the publicly available PcShare backdoor. The sets of\nstrings highlighted by the researchers correspond exactly to those that can be found in the open backdoor code. A similar correspondence can\nbe made between the commands supported by the malware. As a result, we can confidently say that this payload is based on the PcShare code.\n\n\n-----\n\nNe t, we w co s de a od ed ve s o o cS a e, w c we ca ed t S a e. Note\nthat during the investigation for our client, we found a RtlShare sample connecting to\nC2 202.182.98.74. It is also used by the sample Downloader.Climax.A with SHA-256\ne9c94ed7265c04eac25bbcdb520e65fcfa31a3290b908c2c2273c29120d0617b. Given\nthe above, we can assume that the payload delivered by the downloader is none other\nthan RtlShare.\n\n**Downloader.Climax.B**\n\n\nFigure 19. Fragment of a file of strings from the PcShare code\n\n\nAnother type of downloader can use vulnerabilities in Microsoft Equation Editor for its execution. This vulnerability, in particular, is exploited\nby a document named \"Mayor of Seoul.rtf\" (7079d8c92cc668f903f3a60ec04dbb2508f23840ef3c57efffb9f906d3bc05ff), created using the\nnotorious Royal Road RTF (8.t) builder, widely used by Asian APT groups.\n\nThe code of this downloader is completely different from Downloader.Climax.A, but does boast some similar features. In particular, both\ndownloaders use TCP to connect to C2, and the resulting payload is decompressed using the LZW algorithm in both cases.\n\nDownloader.Climax.B gains persistence in the system via the registry key\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\GetUserConfig. Its task is to get the files named INFOP11.EXE and OINFO11.OCX\nfrom the control server and execute the EXE file. Each of the files has its own numeric identifier, which is sent to C2.\n\nFigure 20. Fragment of the downloader code\n\nAfter loading, the following configuration parameters in the downloader itself are written to the body of the received OCX file: the node and\nport of the control server, the waiting time between calls to C2, the TodaySend string, as well as the generated GUID.\n\n### RtlShare\n\n[The payload of the RtlShare malware is based on the publicly available PcShare backdoor code. The malware has a specific execution chain, the](https://github.com/LiveMirror/pcshare)\ncode of which is not available in open sources. It involves three DLLs, each with its own export name. We will be using these names to refer to\nthe corresponding libraries.\n\nLet's consider RtlShare using the example of 8ac2165dc395d1e76c3d2fbd4bec429a98e3b2ec131e7951d28a10e9ca8bbc46.\n\nInterestingly, the attackers used the hacked website of the Petrozavodsk mathematical conference PICCAnA (piccana.karelia.ru) to deliver it;\n[the site is currently unavailable (web archive). As a control server, it uses the private IP address 192.168.193.165.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200131000411/http://piccana.karelia.ru/)\n\n\n-----\n\nu g c de t vest gat o o ou c e t, we e cou te ed a ost de t ca sa p es us g co t o se ve s 45.76. 45., 4 . 64.35.87, a d\n202.182.98.74.\n\n**Dropper rtlstat.dll**\n\nThe rtlstat.dll library acts as the initial stage of infection, exporting a single function named emBedding. Its task is to extract and run the nextstage library with the internal name rtlmake.dll.\n\nTo do this, the OS bitness is first checked and the necessary data block is selected, after which it is XOR-decrypted with a key in the form of one\nof the strings 4af233f4740c2fde7fc95ed3a834d7b1 (x64) and 3ad6faf2d7b714137de31efef137775b (x86). Then the decrypted data is\ndecompressed using the LZ4 algorithm.\n\nFigure 21. Extracting the required version of rtlmake.dll\n\nA data block containing the configuration is copied to the body of the received library (it is encrypted at this stage). The magic number\n0xAADDEE99 is used as a marker indicating the place where the configuration will be copied.\n\nTo bypass detection based on hash sums, attackers add a random number of random bytes to the end of the library, while updating the\nChecksum field in the PE header of the file. This way, a new file is extracted at each new launch.\n\nThen the dropper checks whether it is running under the SYSTEM user by searching for the config substring in the path to the LocalAppData\nfolder. If the substring is present, the library is restarted under the current user via rundll32.exe.\n\nOtherwise, the resulting library is saved to the file %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WER\\Security\\wuaueng.hlk, and the path to it is\nwritten to the registry using the key HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\\InprocServer32. This section\nis responsible for the MruPidlList COM object used in the library shell32.dll, which, in turn, loads the process explorer.exe—this is a wellknown technique for malware persistence in the system.\n\nAt the end of its operation, the dropper executes the extracted DLL using regsvr32.exe and self-removes via a BAT file.\n\n**Injector rtlmake.dll**\n\nVersions of rtlmake.dll with different bitness have the same functionality, which is confined to extracting the next-stage DLL and embedding\nits code into the process rdpclip.exe (or into the current process).\n\nAt the beginning of its operation, the injector makes sure that it is running in one instance: mutexes are most often used for this purpose, but in\nthis case named file mappings are applied. During the operation of rtlmake.dll, a mapping with the name 55fc3f9a654c500932 is created, while\nthe mapping 7f8b6a2440e5c9e5b6 handles the payload.\n\nThen, using a function similar to the previous step, the DLL with the payload and configuration is decrypted and decompressed (recall that it\nwas previously copied to rtlmake.dll). The configuration encryption key is the string 2ae06f136eb6588508eefd4b5f6c98d8345f1104746d15141,\nand the payload encryption key is 1192f6c4b018c8e0f51d31d6dde22ff3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. RtlShare backdoor configuration\n\nNext, the process in which the payload will be injected is selected. If the current process is explorer.exe (which is true, if the library was loaded\nas a COM component), then the target process will be rdpclip.exe. If rdpclip.exe failed to start, or if the DLL was loaded into another process,\nthe current process becomes the target one.\n\nThe decrypted configuration is written to the memory of the selected process, and after that the injector generates a command line of the form\n/v /c:0x12345678, which contains the configuration address in the address space of the process. The resulting string and payload are also\nwritten to the process memory.\n\nFigure 23. Generating the command line in rtlmake.dll\n\nTo start execution of the payload, the injector determines the offset in the PE file where the exported Putklm function is located, and after that\nit gains control of the CreateRemoteThread call. In this case, the command-line address is passed to it as arguments. Note that there is no\nreflective loading up to this point: the Putklm function actually works as a shellcode.\n\n**Payload rtlmain.dll (rtlmainx64.dll)**\n\nThis DLL is fully implemented based on the code of the main backdoor module PcShare—PcMain. Here are some of its features that are typical\nonly for the RtlShare family:\n\nA reflective loader is implemented inside the library, which is located in the Putklm function. The command-line address that it receives\nis passed to DllEntryPoint via the lpReserved parameter and is XOR-encrypted with the constant 0x73DE2938. Address recovery and\ncommand-line parsing occur inside the DllMain function.\nAfter running rtlmain.dll, all the rdpclip.exe processes are terminated except for the current one.\nThe backdoor string storage, in addition to LZ4 compression (which is present in the open-source code), is AES-encrypted with the key\n68fa504a1aee69f71df454e554c74eaf. Similarly, the messages received (key 48d426ca6d45496e7413cf435516af06) and transmitted (key\n2e5140d04c7d7da454991bae10160369) are encoded.\nSupport for the connection via a proxy server has been added\n\n\n-----\n\ne e s a spec a co a d t at a ows attac e s to ove w te t e co gu at o s de t e jecto t a e.d (t e equ ed o set\ncontains the magic constant 0x76EE38BB).\nThe getip command has been added to the code for implementing the remote command shell, which is done through the call nslookup\nmyip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com.\n\n**Use of RtlShare**\n\n[RtlShare samples can be found in other reports. For example, Recorded Future researchers found PcShare samples in the network](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0616.pdf)\ninfrastructure of the RedFoxtrot group, which have significant similarities with the RtlShare family. In addition, similar samples were\n[previously detected by Bitdefender when investigating the activity of an APT group with Asian roots aimed at government institutions in](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf)\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nThere are no connections in the network infrastructure between the above-mentioned cases, nor between these cases and the activity that we\nfound during incident investigation for our client. This suggests that despite the absence of RtlShare code in open sources, several different\nAPT groups of Asian origin have access to this malware.\n\n### PlugX\n\nWe also found several samples of the PlugX backdoor in our client's network. The samples used micro.dns04.com, microft.dynssl.com,\napi.microft.dynssl.com, and www.0077.x24hr.com addresses as control servers, which are part of the group's network infrastructure and\ndirectly intersect with MyKLoadClient C2.\n\nPlugX is widely used in the cybercriminal environment; it has several versions and multiple modifications. However, the samples identified by\nus have a set of features that make it possible to distinguish them into a separate group.\n\nAs in the usual PlugX, the main payload of the backdoor is implemented in the form of a DLL library, which is reflectively loaded into memory\nduring malware execution. A pointer to the structure is passed to its entry point as an argument; the structure contains, in particular, the\nsignature and address of the encrypted configuration.\n\nIn the original PlugX, the signature is the constant 0x504C5547 (PLUG string), but in our sample group, this value was equal to 0xCF455089.\nThe configuration size, which is 0x1924 bytes, is also nonstandard: we could not find a mention of such a configuration in open sources. Unlike\nmany other variants that have the XV signature instead of MZ and PE, in our case, the header of the PE file with the payload remains\nunchanged.\n\nThe inlining technique is actively used in the backdoor, in particular, for API calls and string encryption.\n\nFigure 24. API function calls in PlugX\n\nTo search for API functions, the backdoor uses CRC32 hashes of their names. The received pointers are cached, while the code fragments\nresponsible for this operation are embedded in every place where access to WinAPI is required.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. String encryption in PlugX\n\nAlmost all the strings in the backdoor are stack-based, most of them are encrypted using the ADD-XOR-SUB method. The decryption code is\ncopied to all places where encrypted strings are used.\n\n[The malware uses a standard set of plugins known from early versions. The original PlugX, during their initialization, uses a parameter that](https://www.lastline.com/labsblog/an-analysis-of-plugx-malware/)\nlooks like a date. For instance, the Disk plugin has the 0x20120325 parameter. In our case, for all plugins, the 2012 combination has been\nchanged to 8102 (which may mean 2018): the same Disk plugin uses the 0x81020325 value.\n\nThe entire backdoor also has a numeric value indicating the version: it is transmitted to C2 along with information about the infected system\n[and is equal to 0x20161127. The same version can be found in Backdoor.PlugX.38 from the Dr.Web report on attacks on state institutions in](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/july/Study_of_the_APT_attacks_on_state_institutions_in_Kazakhstan_and_Kyrgyzstan_en.pdf)\nKazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. However, other unique values from the Space Pirates variant, such as signature and configuration size, are missing\nin BackDoor.PlugX.38. Both variants seem to be based on the base code of the same version of PlugX, but its modifications in each of these\ncases are different.\n\n[We found more precise intersections in other reports. Among the PlugX instances used in the attacks on the Vatican in 2019–2020 are several](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/sites/default/files/2021-10/OPERATION%20EXORCIST%20White%20Paper.pdf)\n[samples similar to those used by the Space Pirates group. In addition, the same backdoor modifications are found in samples associated with](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0616.pdf)\nthe activity of the RedFoxtrot group. However, we failed to detect connections in the network infrastructure, which again suggests the exchange\nof tools between groups. Given the other intersections between the malware used in the attacks (Zupdax and RtlShare), we can also assume\nthat all this activity belongs to one or more jointly operating groups. This, however, requires additional confirmation.\n\n**Demo dropper**\n\nSome samples of the PlugX variant we found are extracted into the system by an interesting dropper, whose executable file can be called\ndemo.exe. It is implemented based on the MFC library. Its job is to create a VBS script named msiexece.vbs or cosetsvc.vbs, and perform its\nsubsequent execution.\n\nThe path to the EXE dropper and the names of the files to be extracted from it are passed to the script as command-line parameters. The files\nare in the demo.exe overlay and can be encrypted with a 1-byte XOR (but in all samples known to us, the key is 0). The overlay offset and the\nlength of each of the files are written in the VBS code. The script extracts the standard PlugX components: a legitimate EXE file, a DLL for sideloading, and encrypted shellcode, after which the legitimate file is executed.\n\nFigure 26. Writing and execution of the VBS file\n\n\n-----\n\n### _ 006\n\nAs in other cases, we found this malware both on our client's resources and when researching the group's network infrastructure. It contains a\nmodified Gh0st backdoor as a payload. The string BH_A006 is constantly found in PDB paths and internal names of DLL libraries associated\nwith the backdoor, which is why it got this name.\n\nBH_A006 has a nontrivial payload execution scheme, which can vary at the initial stages in different samples. Let's consider it using the\nexample of one of the malicious files.\n\n**Stage 0. Loading DLL from the overlay**\n\nSHA-256: 1e725f1fe67d1a596c9677df69ef5b1b2c29903e84d7b08284f0a767aedcc097\n\nThe source sample is an executable file that uses the MFC library. It extracts the contents of the overlay, decrypts itswith XOR with the 0xA0\nkey, and reflectively loads the resulting DLL into memory.\n\n**Stage 1. DLL dropper**\n\nSHA-256: 8bf3df654459b1b8f553ad9a0770058fd2c31262f38f2e8ba12943f813200a4d\n\nextracts the following files:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\resmon.resmoncfg\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SbieIni.dat (install32.dat)\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SbieDll.dll\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SandboxieBITS.exe\n\nAfter that, there is a check for write permission to the system folder. For this, the dropper tries to create a file in it with the name format:\nwmkawe_%d.data. The content is the Stupid Japanese string.\n\nIf there is no permission, and the system is 64-bit, two additional files are extracted:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie.dll (install64.dll)\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie.dat (install64.dat)\n\nThe names given in parentheses are not used, but are present in the code. Apparently, they were left there from another version of the dropper.\n\nAll the files are contained in the data section in packaged form; a variant of the LZMA algorithm is used for compression. This compression\nmethod is also used in further stages of the malware operation. Further in the section, unless otherwise indicated, we will refer to this\nalgorithm.\n\nDepending on the available permissions and the OS bitness, the dropper starts one of the chains to bypass the UAC:\n\n(x32) C:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SandboxieBITS.exe ByPassUAC\n(x64) rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SbieMsg.dll,installsvc ByPassUAC\n\nOr it immediately proceeds to the execution of the next stage:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SandboxieBITS.exe InsertS\n\nIn all three cases, the file %tmp%\\delself.bat is created, which contains commands for self-removal.\n\nNote that it is not the first time researchers have encountered this sample. Another variant of the MFC loader (stage 0) containing the same\n[dropper was mentioned by ESET in the Operation NightScout report, and then studied in detail by our colleagues from VinCSS.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)\n\n**Stage 2. .dat loader (SbieDll.dll / SbieMsg.dll)**\n\nRegardless of the command run by the DLL dropper, execution jumps to one of the extracted DLL libraries. In the case of a 32-bit version, a\n[legitimate component of the Sandboxie utility, which is vulnerable to DLL side-loading, is used for this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandboxie)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27. Loading and running the shellcode in SbieDll.dll\n\nThe code in the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the libraries is almost identical and downloads the corresponding .dat file, decrypts its contents,\nand executes it. For decryption, XOR is used with the byte sequence: 00, 01, 02, ... FF, 00, 01, ... Just as in the code of the previous stage, here\nyou can see alternative paths to .dat files that are not used during operation.\n\n**Stage 3. Shellcode .dat and DLL**\n\nThe shellcode is a reflective DLL library loader, which is located in its body immediately after the loading function. In this case, the library\nfunctionality differs significantly in shellcode versions with different bitness.\n\n**Stage 3.1 ByPassUAC (x64)**\n\n**Stage 3.1.1 Intermediate DLL**\n\nThe 64-bit version is only responsible for implementing the UAC bypass. To perform this task, it extracts another DLL from itself into memory\nand transfers control to it. Reflective loading is performed again using a shellcode, which is predecrypted with XOR using the 0x97 key. The\nshellcode is not autonomous: in addition to the buffer with the PE file, pointers to the necessary functions, such as GetProcAddress and\nLoadLibraryA, are passed to it.\n\nFigure 28. Decryption and execution of the shellcode for reflective loading\n\n**Stage 3.1.2 DLL with UAC bypass implementation**\n\nThe DLL contains the path to the PDB file: e:\\F35-F22\\昆明版本\\ElephantRat\\nwsapagent\\Bin\\ByPassUAC64.pdb.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. Choosing a UAC bypass method\n\nThe UAC bypass method used depends on the presence in the system of the avp.exe process (a component of Kaspersky antivirus products) and\n[on the system version. In total, three well-known methods using sdclt.exe, a](http://blog.sevagas.com/?Yet-another-sdclt-UAC-bypass) [.NET library, and](https://offsec.almond.consulting/UAC-bypass-dotnet.html) [mocking trusted directories have been](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/uac-bypass-by-mocking-trusted-directories-24a96675f6e)\nimplemented.\n\nIf the bypass is successfully implemented using any of the methods, the previously encountered command\nC:\\ProgramData\\Sandboxie\\SandboxieBITS.exe InsertS is run.\n\n**Stage 3.2. ByPassUAC / InstallS (x32)**\n\n**Stage 3.2.1. Intermediate DLL**\n\nThe 32-bit version of the DLL, which is located in the corresponding DAT file, is obfuscated using an unknown protector.\n\nFigure 30. The entry point in the obfuscated PE file\n\nIn the data section of this DLL, there is a compressed shellcode that is decompressed and gains control.\n\n**Stage 3.2.2. Decompression shellcode**\n\nFigure 31. Passing arguments to the function via the return address\n\nThe shellcode starts with calling the sub_20F function, which takes three arguments: a hash on behalf of VirtualAlloc, the size of the buffer to\ndecompress, and a pointer to the data. The arguments are written immediately after the call statement, and the called function accesses them\nusing an offset relative to the return address.\n\nThe sub_20F function gets a pointer to the VirtualAlloc function, for which it finds the kernelbase.dll library in the list of loaded modules\n(which is always assumed to be in second place on the InInitializationOrderModuleList list) and iterates its export table using a hash to find the\nrequired function. Then a buffer of the size specified in the arguments with RWX rights is allocated, and the compressed data is unpacked into\n[it. In this case, compression is done with the NRV family algorithm from the UCL library (used in the UPX packer). The data is another](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/ucl/)\nshellcode to which control is transferred.\n\n**Stage 3.2.3. Relocation shellcode**\n\n\n-----\n\ne a pa t o t e e t s e code s t e co te ts o data a d code sect o s, appa e t y e t acted o so e e. o au c co ect y at t e\nbeginning of its operation, the shellcode performs address correction (relocation). The parameters necessary for it are transmitted in the same\nway as the previous shellcode using the return address. The relocation is performed relative to the standard base address 0x401000. After its\ncompletion, control is transferred to the address of the entry point specified in the parameters (as an offset relative to the end of the relocation\ntable).\n\nFigure 32. Parameters of the relocation shellcode\n\n**Stage 3.2.4. Installer in shellcode format**\n\nThe main function of the installer loads the WinAPI functions necessary for operation, after which it can perform the operation specified in the\ncommand line.\n\nFigure 33. Code fragment of the shellcode installer\n\nThe following commands are supported:\n\nInsertS: create a service named Network Service. The name of the current module with the runsvc parameter is specified as the launch\npath. If there are no avp.exe processes in the list, the service is launched immediately.\n\n\n-----\n\nu svc: de ete a au a y es a d o de s t at cou d be used t e U C bypass. eco p ess g t e e t stage s e code, c eat g a\nsvchost.exe process, and injecting the decompressed shellcode. Interestingly, in the code for impersonation and starting the svchost.exe\nprocess, a special check has been implemented only for the Russian language, which indicates an orientation to Russian-language OS\nversions.\n\nFigure 34. Special processing for the Russian-language version of the system\n\nIn addition, a separate thread is created that checks for Global\\MYKERNELDLLMAPPING06 mapping every 50 seconds. In case of its\nabsence in the system, the creation of svchost.exe and shellcode injection are repeated.\n\nByPassUAC: works completely similar to the 64-bit version (stage 3.1.1)—it decompresses the DLL with the implementation of UAC\nbypass methods and transfers control to it.\nMemload: there is a MemLoadServer debug message in the code. Decompresses the next-stage shellcode and runs it directly in the\ncurrent process.\n\n**Stage 4. MemLoadLibrary**\n\nThe fourth stage has a previously encountered format: the decompression shellcode extracts the relocation shellcode, which in turn executes\nthe main code (obtained from the PE file). The main code in this case is small in volume and is responsible for decompressing and reflectively\nloading the DLL into memory. The reflective loader is implemented in the form of an XOR-encrypted shellcode, as in stage 3.1.1. After loading\nthe library, control is transferred to the exported Online function.\n\nThe DLL is again just an intermediate loader and runs another shellcode.\n\nThe new shellcode is an unpacking shellcode, and stage 4 is repeated exactly, right\nup to calling the Online function from the latest DLL library.\n\nFigure 35. Decompressing the DLL and starting the Online export\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 36. Online function code\n\n**Stage 5. Payload**\n\nIt is a backdoor partially obfuscated with the help of a previously encountered packer (stage 3.2.1), which is based on the Gh0st trojan code.\n\nInterestingly, the signature of network packets (Gh0st in the original) in this version is generated and checked in a special way. In a 4-byte\nvalue, only the lowest bit of each byte carries the payload, the remaining bits are random. The lower bits must satisfy a set of logical relations\ninvolving the lower bits of the magic constant 0x31230C0. Note that a similar algorithm for checking these relations using the same constant\ncan be found in loaders of .dat files (stage 2), but the result of its operation is not used there.\n\nFigure 37. Generating a signature in the constructor of the CClientSocket class\n\nThe library has the export name BH_A006_SRV.dll, and in the PE file overlay, you can find the corresponding PDB path:\n\nD:\\005（fastapp f35 20181009）\\nwsapagent\\KernelTrjoan\\BH_A006_SRV\\BH_A006_SRV\\Debug\\BH_A006_SRV.pdb\n\nWe managed to find a sample of the malware (57d4c08ce9a45798cd9b0cf08c933e26ffa964101dcafb1640d1df19c223e738), which has a similar\nobfuscation and an identical algorithm for generating a network signature, and contains the name BH_A006_SRV.dll. This sample was\nuploaded to VirusTotal in 2015.\n\n**Connection with 9002 RAT**\n\nIn studying the execution chain of the BH_A006 backdoor, it turned out that the technique used for converting a PE file into an autonomous\ncompressed shellcode is not unique. Similar decompression and relocation shellcodes, as well as the procedure for loading WinAPI functions,\nare present in instances of the 9002 RAT malware. For example, they can be found in the sample\n[52374f68d1e43f1ca6cd04e5816999ba45c4e42eb0641874be25808c9fe15005 from the Trend Micro report on attacks on South Korean](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/h/supply-chain-attack-operation-red-signature-targets-south-korean-organizations.html)\ncompanies—one of the last mentions of this malware.\n\n### Deed RAT\n\n\n-----\n\not e type o p ev ous y u ow a wa e, w c we ou d a s g e sta ce ou c e t s ast uctu e, s a odu a bac doo . ased\non the value of the signature used in the header of its modules, we named it Deed RAT.\n\nThe Deed RAT control server ftp.microft.dynssl.com is directly connected to the infrastructure of the Space Pirates group. Another similarity\ncan be found in one of the code features: the [xor 0xBB, sub 0x1] operations are used to encrypt the shellcode in the same way as in the part of\nPlugX samples.\n\nThe payload execution scheme resembles the standard method that PlugX uses: a legitimate EXE file signed by Trend Micro loads a malicious\nlibrary TmDbgLog.dll, which, in turn, runs the encrypted shellcode from the file PTWD.tmp.\n\nHowever, an interesting method of transferring control to the shellcode is used: at the time of loading, the library modifies the executable file\nso that after returning control to the EXE file, the FreeLibrary function is immediately called for it. Having regained control at the time of\nunloading, the library modifies the executable file again, writing assembly instructions for calling the shellcode to it—they will be executed\nimmediately after returning from FreeLibrary.\n\nThe shellcode is the loader of the main module, which is located in compressed and encrypted form after the loading code. The module has a\nspecial structure and uses techniques borrowed from PE files. In particular, the module has three \"sections\" with different access rights and a\nrelocation table completely similar to the one used in PE format.\n\nThe decrypted module consists of a header starting with the signature 0xDEED4554 and a main data block compressed with LZNT1, which\ncontains section data and a relocation table. For each of the sections, the header indicates its actual size and the size in memory, which is\naligned to the 0x1000 boundary. The header structure looks as follows:\n```\nstruct SectionHeader{\n  _DWORD VirtualSize;\n  _DWORD SizeOfRawData;\n};\nstruct ModuleHeader{\n  _DWORD Signature; // 0xDEED4554\n  _DWORD ModuleId;\n  _DWORD EntryPoint;\n  _DWORD OriginalBase;\n  _DWORD AbsoluteOffset; // 0x1000\n  SectionHeader Sections[3];\n  _DWORD Unknown;\n};\n\n```\nDuring operation, the loader allocates the necessary memory area, copies each of the sections into it (taking into account its size in memory),\nand performs address configuration (relocation). The first of the sections contains executable code, and RX permissions are set for its memory\narea, the other sections have RW permissions. After loading the sections, the module entry point specified in the header gain control.\n\nThe main backdoor module has the identifier 0x20 and is responsible for loading and managing plugins that implement various functions. In\nits data section, there are eight encrypted plugins that are initialized at the beginning of operation:\n\n**ID** **Name** **Description** **Network commands**\n\n0x30 Startup A plugin that implements the malware startup algorithm\n\n0x40 Config A plugin that handles the configuration 0x40: transferring the\nconfiguration to C2\n0x41: receiving a new\nconfiguration from C2\n\n0xA0 Install A plugin responsible for persistence on the infected computer. Persistence can be\nachieved through the mechanism of services and through the registry (the key is set by the\nconfiguration)\n\n0xB0 Inject A plugin that implements code injection into a given process (determined by the\nconfiguration)\n\n0x60 Network A plugin that manages network interaction\n\n0x70 NetSocket A plugin that implements various types of connectors for network interaction\n\n\n0x50 Plugin A plugin that implements registry monitoring for the appearance of new plugins in it and\ntheir loading\n\n\n0x50: collecting\ninformation about plugins\n0x51: adding a plugin to\nthe registry and launching\nit\n0x52: removing the plugin\nfrom the registry and\nmemory\n\n\n-----\n\n**ID** **Name** **Description** **Network commands**\n\n0x90 NetProxy A plugin that manages information about available proxy servers. It has a built-in sniffer for\nautomatic detection of proxies used by the infected computer\n\nUnlike the main module, an algorithm based on Salsa20 is used to encrypt plugins. Among the modifications is a custom constant for the key\nextension, equal to arbitraryconstat. The structure of the decrypted plugin completely copies the structure of the main module, and a similar\nalgorithm is used to load it.\n\nEach plugin implements five service operations that are implemented at its entry point:\n\n1. Initialization.\n2. Obtaining the numeric ID of the plugin.\n3. Obtaining the plugin name.\n4. Obtaining a link to the structure with the plugin's API functions.\n5. Resource deallocation.\n\nFigure 38. Entry point of the Config plugin\n\nThe useful functionality of the plugin is available through the structure with its API functions. Among them, there may be a dispatcher function\nresponsible for processing network commands that the plugin supports. The main module also has an API that allows you to access other\nplugins and implements auxiliary functions, such as encryption or access to the registry.\n\nOne interesting feature of the backdoor is the pseudorandom generation of various kinds of strings—registry keys, names of mutexes and pipes,\nand command-line arguments. A string of the required length is created on the basis of a seed, which is generated using the numeric identifier\nof the string and the serial number of the system volume. As a result, each of the infected computers uses its own unique set of string constants.\n\nFigure 39. ID generation algorithm\n\nThe backdoor stores all the necessary data in the registry key [HKLM|HKCU]\\Software\\Microsoft\\. For each type of information, it creates its\nown subkey, the name of which is obtained using the string generator described above. To get all the keys that the backdoor can use, we\nimplemented a script in Python that accepts the serial number of the volume and reproduces the operation of the generator.\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** **y** **y** **g**\n\nThe Network plugin is responsible for the algorithm of interaction with the control server. It extracts the C2 address as a URL string from the\nconfiguration and, depending on the scheme specified in it, selects one of the connectors available in the NetSocket plugin. All of them\nimplement a common interface for uniformly receiving and transmitting network messages. Before sending, messages are compressed using\nthe LZNT1 algorithm and encrypted with a modified Salsa20 using a random key.\n\nTo resolve the domain of the control server, the backdoor consistently uses DNS over HTTPS and the usual DNS servers specified in the\nconfiguration (public servers of Google and other providers), before resorting to the standard mechanism. This gives the malware the\nopportunity to hide the C2 domain from network traffic inspection tools.\n\nSupported connection protocols include TCP, TLS, HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, and DNS.\n\nThe REUSEPORT option is available for TCP—specifying it leads to prebinding of the socket with which the connection to C2 is established.\nBinding is performed on the largest free port in the range of system (well-known) ports. The ports are checked starting from 1022 in\ndescending order. Apparently, this technique is implemented to bypass security measures and disguise traffic as system network services.\n\nThe backdoor also provides for the possibility of obtaining a new C2 over HTTP. To do this, a web page can be used, the address of which is\nspecified in the configuration with the URL:// scheme. After the page loads, its body is searched for the agmsy4 and ciou0 substrings, which\nindicate the beginning and end of the string with the control server. This string is encoded using base16 (hex) with the abcghimnostuyz0456\nalphabet and is processed similarly to the address from the configuration.\n\nTCP/TLS and HTTP/HTTPS connectors support connection via a proxy server, which can be obtained using the NetProxy plugin. The plugin\nhas its own proxy storage, which is located in the registry and can be filled with values from the configuration, system proxies, and data from\ninstalled browsers (Chrome, Opera, and Firefox). In addition, the plugin has the functionality of a built-in sniffer that listens to the traffic of the\ninfected computer using a raw socket. If the sniffer detects an attempt to connect to a proxy server (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, or HTTP) in the\noutgoing packet, it saves information about it in the storage.\n\nBefore connecting to the control server, the backdoor checks the schedule: up to four entries can be specified in its configuration, containing\nthe days of the week and the hours during which the connection is prohibited.\n\nAfter the connection is established, the backdoor can execute the following commands:\n\n**ID** **Description**\n\n0x210 Collect information about the system\n\n0x211 Creation of a separate connection to work with plugins\n\n0x212 Self-removal\n\n0x213 Empty command (ping)\n\n0x214 Connection deactivation\n\n0x215 Update of the shellcode for the injection, which is stored in the registry\n\n0x216 Update of the main shellcode on the disk. All plugins stored in the registry are deleted\n\nIf a command is received that is not on the list above, it is assumed that it is a network command of one of the plugins. Its ID is determined by\napplying the mask 0xFFF0 to the command ID. If the plugin is not available locally, it is preloaded from C2 and saved in the registry.\n\nOn the computer infected with Deed RAT, we were able to detect a single plugin obtained dynamically from the control server. It is called Shell,\nand its ID is 0x270. Shell supports two network commands (0x270 and 0x271); each of them starts the specified process and redirects its I/O\nto C2. In the first case, the interaction takes place in text mode via pipes. In the second case, Windows Console API operations are used, which\nallows attackers to fully emulate a console window on their side, taking into account information about the size of the screen buffer, cursor\nposition, and other parameters.\n\nThe configuration of the sample we examined contained the following set of strings:\n\n**String** **Purpose**\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Test\\Test.exe Path to the legitimate executable file (installation path)\n\nTmDbgLog.dll Library name for DLL side-loading\n\nPTWD.tmp File name with the encrypted shellcode\n\nTest Service name\n\nTrend Micro Platinum Displayed service name\n\n\n-----\n\n**String** **Purpose**\n\nPlatinum Watch Dog Service description\n\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce Key for persistence in the registry\n\n%windir%\\system32\\svchost.exe Process names for injecting code\n\n%windir%\\system32\\taskeng.exe\n\n%ProgramFiles%\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\n\n%windir%\\system32\\WmiPrvSE.exe\n\nhio2cF9VF2Jsdf9n Identifier sent along with system information\n\nasdRFSDabormhkmfgUIYGBDURE Mutex name\n\nhttps://dns.google/dns-query Addresses of DNS over HTTPS servers\n\nhttps://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query\n\nhttps://dns.adguard.com/dns-query\n\nhttps://dns.quad9.net/dns-query\n\nTCP://ftp.microft.dynssl.com:53412 Control server URL\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAPT groups with Asian roots continue to attack Russian companies, as evidenced by the activity of Space Pirates. Cybercriminals both develop\nnew malware that implements non-standard techniques (such as Deed RAT) and use modifications of existing backdoors. Such modifications\nsometimes feature multiple layers of obfuscation to defeat security tools and complicate the analysis procedure—as in the case of BH_A006,\nbuilt on the code of the popular Gh0st backdoor.\n\nA separate difficulty as regards APT groups operating out of the Asian region is accurate attribution: the frequent exchange of tools and, in\nsome cases, joint activity of groups significantly complicate this task. The core part of our research is based on the results of our investigation of\nan information security incident at our client's premises and analysis of specific network infrastructure that uses DDNS domains. The data\nobtained allows us to state with certainty that the same attackers are behind the detected activity.\n\nPT ESC will continue to monitor the threats: new facts may provide more information about the activities of Space Pirates and its relationship\nwith other groups.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### MITRE\n\n**ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n**Initial**\n**Access**\n\nT1566.001 Phishing:
