In recent attacks they set up a fake VPN Web Portal and targeted at least five Israeli IT\nvendors, several financial institutes, and the Israeli Post Office.\n\nLater, the attackers set up two fake websites pretending to be a University of Oxford conference sign-up page and a\njob application website. In these websites they hosted malware that was digitally signed with a valid, likely stolen\ncode signing certificate\n\nBased on VirusTotal uploads, malicious documents content, and known victims – other targeted organisations are\nlocated in Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.\n\n## Fake VPN Web Portal\n\nIn one of the recent cases, the attackers sent the following email to individuals in targeted organisations:\n\nThe email was sent from a compromised account of an IT vendor. Similar emails were sent from other IT vendors in\nthe same time period, suggesting the attackers had a foothold within their networks, or at least could get access to\nspecific computers or email accounts.\n\nThe link provided in the malicious email led to a fake VPN Web Portal:\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon logging in with the credentials provided in the email, the victim is presented with the following page:\n\nThe victim is asked to install the “VPN Client” (an .exe file), or, if download fails, to download a password protected\nzip (with the same .exe file inside).\n\nThe “VPN Client” is a legitimate Juniper VPN software bundled with [Helminth, a malware in use by the OilRig](http://telussecuritylabs.com/threats/show/TSL20160530-07)\nthreat agnet:\n\nJuniperSetupClientInstaller.exe\n[6a65d762fb548d2dc56cfde4842a4d3c (VirusTotal link)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/a367ccb9ca5a958d012e94ae8122feda9a1a7f23a0c84e2bc5ee35c834900b61/analysis/1483354486/)\n\nIf the victim downloads and installs the file, their computer would get infected, while the legitimate VPN software is\ninstalled. The legitimate and the malicious installations can be seen in the process tree when the file is run in a\nCuckoo sandbox. Malicious processes are marked red (click image to enlarge):\n\nThe following malicious files are dropped and run:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\{2ED05C38-D464-4188-BC7F-F6915DE8D764}\\OFFLINE\\9A189DFE\\C7B7C186\\main.vbs\ndcac79d7dc4365c6d742a49244e81fd0\n\n\n-----\n\n7fe0cb5edc11861bc4313a6b04aeedb2\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV\\DnS.ps1\n3920c11797ed7d489ca2a40201c66dd4\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe” /create /F /sc minute /mo 3 /tn “GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI” /tr\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV\\backup.vbs\n7528c387f853d96420cf7e20f2ad1d32\n\nCommand and control server is located in the following domain:\n\ntecsupport[.]in\n\nA detailed analysis of the malware is provided in [two](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/) [posts by Palo Alto networks and in a](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/) [post by FireEye,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html)\nwhich wrote about previous campaigns by this threat agent.\n\n(Note that Juniper networks was not compromised nor otherwise involved in the attack, except for the attackers\nusing its name and publicly available software).\n\n## Digitally signed malware\n\nThe entire bundle (VPN client and malware) was digitally signed with a valid code signing certificate issued by\nSymantec to AI Squared, a legitimate software company that develops accessibility software:\n\nThumbprint: F340C0D841F9D99DBC289151C13391000366631C\nSerial number: 45 E4 7F 56 0B 01 B6 4E 68 39 5E 5D 79 2F 2E 09\n\n[Another Helminth sample, 1c23b3f11f933d98febfd5a92eb5c715, was](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e404f9e9a7c4dc4cf44a4bf3e9738c10dfdc572e5184934af3ec3dd97e18b958/analysis/)\nsigned with a different AI Squared code signing certificate:\n\nThumbprint: 92B8C0872BACDC226B9CE4D783D5CCAD61C6158A\nSerial number:62 E0 44 E7 37 24 61 2D 79 4B 93 AF 97 46 13 48\n\nThis suggest that the attackers had got a hold of an Ai Squared signing\nkey, potentially after compromising their network. Alternatively, the\nattackers might have got Symantec to issue them a certificate under Ai\nSquared’s name.\n\n[[Update 11 February 2017: In a notification in its website, Ai Squared](http://www.aisquared.com/CertificateFix/)\nsays that “The digital certificate used to certify newer ZoomText and\nWindow-Eyes software products has been compromised. As a result, our certificate will be revoked on or around\nJanuary 26th”]\n\n## University of Oxford impersonation\n\nThe attackers registered four domains impersonating The University of Oxford.\n\n**oxford-symposia[.]com, is a fake Oxford conference registration website. Visitors are asked to download the**\n“University Of Oxford Job Symposium Pre-Register Tool”:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded file (which is also signed with an AI Squared certificate), is a fake registration tool built by the\nattackers:\n\nOxfordSymposiumRegTool.exe\nf77ee804de304f7c3ea6b87824684b33\n\nIf run by the victim, their computer would get infected, while they are shown this registration process:\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that after completing the “registration process”, the victim is asked to send the form to an email address\nin oxford-careers[.]com, which also belongs to the attackers.\n\nPreviously the fake website linked to the following documents in a third fake Oxford domain, oxford[.]in:\n\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls1.doc\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls2.doc\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls3.doc\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls4.do\n\nThe documents were unavailable during our research, and their content is unknown to us.\n\nThe attackers used a forth domain, oxford-employee[.]com, to host an “Oxford Job application” website:\n\n\n-----\n\nVisitors are asked to “Download CV Creator” in order “To Join University of Oxford staff”. CV Creator is a malicious\nfile hosted at http://www.oxford-careers[.]com/Files/OxfordCVCreator.exe :\n\nOxfordCVCreator.exe\n5713c3c01067c91771ac70e193ef5419\n\nWhen run, the victim is again presented with a tool created by the attackers, this time a “University Of Oxford Official\nCV Creator”:\n\n\n-----\n\nupdater[.]li\n\n## Other incidents\n\nIn an earlier incident, the attackers sent a malicious excel file impersonating Israir, an Israeli Airline (the content of\nthe file was copied from the company’s public website and we have no indication of it being compromised or\ntargeted):\n\nIsrael Airline.xls\n197c018922237828683783654d3c632a\n\nThe file had a macro that if enabled by the user would infect its computer.\n**In other incidents the attackers used the following files:**\n\nSpecial Offers.xls / Salary Employee 2016.xls\nf76443385fef159e6b73ad6bf7f086d6\n\npic.xls\n3a5fcba80c1fd685c4b5085d9d474118\n\n\n-----\n\nbd7d2efdb2a0f352c4b74f2b82e3c7bc\n\ncv.xls\n72e046753f0496140b4aa389aee2e300\n\nusers.xls\n262bc259682cb48ce66a80dcc9a5d587\n\nEmployee Engagement Survey.xls\n726175e9aba421aa0f96cfc005664302\n\nJuniperSetupClientInstaller.exe\nf8ce7e356e09de6a48dca9e51421b6f6\n\nProject_Domain_No337.chm\n[1792cdd0c5397ff5df445d73276d1a50 (undetected as malicious by any antivirus on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8cb80ac1f955bac9ccf67e843ddc15322b4aa70e8c98269a8a98a02df4cbd8b7/analysis/) )\n\ngcaa_report_series15561.chm\n[d50ab63f4034c6f5eb356e3326320e66 (undetected as malicious by any antivirus on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/172b407b28dff5b2f1110545758f15185668c305b0b371c02c8870770f4f7e7a/analysis/) )\n\n## Infrastructure overlap with Cadelle and Chafer\n\nIn December 2015, Symantec published a [post about “two Iran-based attack groups that appear to be connected,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/iran-based-attackers-use-back-door-threats-spy-middle-eastern-targets)\nCadelle and Chafer” that “have been using Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi to spy on Iranian individuals\nand Middle Eastern organizations”.\n\nBackdoor.Remexi, one of the malware in use by Chafer, had the following command and control host:\n\n87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com\n\nInterestingly, IP address 83.142.230.138, which serve as a command and control address for an OilRig related\nsample (3a5fcba80c1fd685c4b5085d9d474118), was pointed to by 87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com as well.\n\nThis suggest that the two groups may actually be the same entity, or that they share resources in one why or\nanother.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n[Indicators file: oilrig-indicators.csv (also available on PassiveTotal)](http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/oilrig-indicators.csv)\n\nThe graph below depicts the OilRig infrastructure (click to enlarge):\n\n\n-----\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\n[This research was facilitated by PassiveTotal for threat infrastructure analysis, and by MalNet for malware research .](https://www.passivetotal.org/)\n[We would like to thank White-Hat, Tom Lancaster of Palo Alto Networks, Michael Yip of Stroz Friedberg, security](http://white-hat.co.il/)\nresearcher Marcus, and other security researchers and organizations who shared information and provided\nfeedback.\n\n\n-----",
