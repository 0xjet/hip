    "plain_text": "## ELISE: Security Through Obesity\n\n**23 December 2015**\n\n**By Michael Yip**\n\n## Executive Summary \n\n**Taiwan has long been subjected to persistent targeting from espionage motivated threat actors. This blog presents our**\n**analysis of one of the latest malware variants targeting individuals in Taiwan, which exhibits some interesting**\n**characteristics that can be useful for detecting and defending against the threat – including the creation of an obese**\n**file, weighing in at 500MB, as part of its execution.**\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n**The sample which caught our attention for this analysis is a PowerPoint slideshow file named台灣[學⽣網路援交觀]**\n\n**察.pps (translation: “Observations on cyber compensated dating among Taiwanese students”). The sample was**\n**submitted to VirusTotal on 3rd December 2015 from Taiwan and at the time was only detected by 3 out of 54 antivirus**\n**vendors as malicious. An exploit for CVE-2014-4114 is also detected and tagged by VirusTotal.**\n\n**Figure 1: The sample is a PowerPoint file with exploit for CVE-2014-4114 embedded.**\n\n## The initial lure\n\n**The figures below show some of the slides from the slideshow. All the contents in the slideshow are written in**\n**Traditional Chinese, which is typically used in provinces in Southern China such as Guangdong and Hong Kong, as**\n**well as Taiwan. Since the topic of the slideshow relates explicitly to Taiwanese and the submission was from Taiwan,**\n**we assess the attacker was likely targeting Taiwanese individuals.**\n\n**Figure 2: The lure document is a Powerpoint (.pps) slideshow on “Observations into cyber compensated**\n**dating (援交) among Taiwanese students”.**\n\n**Given the use of a malicious document as the initial lure, the delivery method in this campaign is almost certainly**\n**spear-phishing.**\n\n## Exploitation\n\n**Once the slideshow file is opened, whilst the slides are displayed in full screen mode, the malware is dropped in the**\n**background. Specifically, two files are dropped into the %TEMP% directory: hlwyss.jpg and hlwyss.inf.**\n\n\n### Email alerts\n\n**[Join today to receive email alerts when we](http://image.edistribution.pwc.com/lib/fe9d13707566057876/m/1/email-alerts-cyber.html)**\n**publish new articles**\n\n**Search the site**\n\n**Search our archive**\n\n**_Articles by category_**\n\n**_Articles by month_**\n\n**Latest posts from Cyber security**\n**updates**\n\n**_ELISE: Security Through Obesity_**\n\n**_Why 2015 was the tipping point for_**\n**_cybersecurity_**\n\n**_#PrivateBizChat: Cybersecurity - 15_**\n**_December, 12.30pm - 1.30pm_**\n\n**_[We are not one, we are many](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/11/we-are-not-one-we-are-many.html)_**\n\n**_[Ingredients for Consumer Security](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/11/ingredients-for-consumer-security.html)_**\n\n**_It won’t happen to us: An optimistic_**\n**_outlook on breaches_**\n\n**_Is threat intelligence the key to realising_**\n**_cyber insurance potential?_**\n\n**_[UnityGhost: the ghost adventure continues](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/10/unityghost-the-adventure-continues.html)_**\n\n**_Cyber security in engineering and_**\n**_construction_**\n\n**_[A tale of Pirpi, Scanbox & CVE-2015-3113](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/07/pirpi-scanbox.html)_**\n\n### Cyber security\n\n**[Building confidence in your digital future](http://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/cyber-security.jhtml)**\n\n### Breach aid\n\n**[Are you suffering a cyber, privacy or data](http://www.pwc.co.uk/en_UK/uk/breach-aid/index.html)**\n**breach?**\n\n### Data protection and privacy\n\n global insights blog\n\n 2015 Information security\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: File header of hlwyss.jpg shows it's an MS-DOS executable.**\n\n**[The hlwyss.inf is an INF file which specifies file system operations required to install the malware (as shown in](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa376858(v=vs.85).aspx)**\n\n**Figure 4). The use of an embedded INF file for malware installation is consistent with the Metasploit implantation of**\n**[CVE-2014-4114, better known as the ‘Sandworm’ vulnerability.](http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_060_sandworm)**\n\n**Figure 4: Contents of the hlwyss.inf which shows the renaming of hlwyss.jpg to hlwyss.dll and installation of**\n**the RunOnce key for malware execution.**\n\n**As indicated in the INF file, the installation script renames** **hlwyss.jpg to hlwyss.dll and sets up the malware**\n\n**through the creation of two RunOnce keys to ensure the execution of the malicious DLL using** **rundll32.exe, with**\n\n**the entry point Setting.**\n\n## Installation and execution\n\n**On examining logs produced during execution by** **[ProcessMonitor, we find that aside from following the instructions](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx)**\n**outlined in the INF file, the malware proceeds to perform additional operations to complete its installation. In particular,**\n**the malware replicates itself in the %AppData%\\Roaming\\Programs folder and names its cloned copy**\n\n**‘Syncmgr.dll’ (see Figure 5).**\n\n**Figure 5: As part of the installation, another DLL called Syncmgr.dll is also created.**\n\n**To ensure persistence on future restarts a** **Run key is also installed, however, the** **Run key points to the newly created**\n\n**Syncmgr.dll rather than the original** **hlwyss.dll.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Run and RunOnce keys installed to ensure malware execution on boot up.**\n\n**Planting the malware in the user’s** **AppData\\Roaming folder is also a sign that the attacker was likely to be targeting**\n\n**corporate users as corporate users often possess roaming user profiles, a Windows feature that allows users to**\n**access their customised Windows environment from different machines.**\n\n**As Syncmgr.dll is the main malicious payload, we took a closer look at the file. The malware was compiled on 24** **[th]**\n\n**November 2015 and it is a 32-bit DLL. This shows that the sample is recent and indicates the threat actor is currently**\n**active.**\n\n**Examining the PE structure of** **Syncmgr.dll shows a hidden executable embedded as one of the resources:**\n\n**Figure 7: Executable embedded in resource.**\n\n**[Once SyncManager.dll is executed, an iexplore.exe process is spawned:](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/media/poster_2014_find_evil.pdf)**\n\n**Figure 8: A malicious iexplore.exe process spawned.**\n\n**Unsurprisingly, the strings of the** **iexplore.exe process reveals that the malware has injected itself into the process.**\n\n**Figure 9: Malware injected into iexplore.exe.**\n\n**By visualising the ProcessMonitor logs in** **[ProcDOT, we see that two more files are created by the malware:](http://www.procdot.com/faqs.htm)**\n**WEB2013BW6.DAT and 60HGBC00.DAT.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: Malware creates two addition .DAT files.**\n\n**By comparing the code constructs between the embedded resource** **ASDASDASDASDSAD and WEB2013BW6.DAT, we**\n\n**see that they contain the identical code, as shown below:**\n\n**Figure 11: The embedded resource (left) and WEB2013BW6.DAT have similar code constructs.**\n\n**However, WEB2013BW6.DAT is over 500MB in size which is significantly larger than** **ASDASDASDASDSAD which is only**\n\n**51KB in size:**\n\n**Figure 12: Dropped files in AppData\\Roaming\\Programs folder.**\n\n**An examination into the PE structure of** **WEB2013BW6.DAT shows that a significant amount of junk characters are**\n\n**appended to the foot of the file:**\n\n**Figure 13: Padding towards the end of WEB2013BW6.DAT.**\n\n**Based on its contents, the .DAT file is likely a component responsible for network communication. ProcMon logs also**\n**show that only once the iexplore.exe process is spawned, that the .DAT file is loaded into the process. Our current**\n\n**hypothesis is that this is component of the malware often triggers antivirus signatures, and its huge size is an effort by**\n**the authors to evade detection.**\n\n## Network communications\n\n**Once the malware is executed, a HTTP GET request is sent to** **showip[.]net in an attempt to find out the victim’s**\n\n**external IP address.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 14: HTTP GET request to showip[.]net.**\n\n**After obtaining the IP address, the malware then sends out a HTTP GET request to one of three command & control**\n**(C2) servers configured in the malware, such as ustar5.PassAs[.]us. The full HTTP headers are as shown in the**\n\n**figure below:**\n\n**Figure 15: Network traffic to ustar5.PassAs[.]us generated after the malware is executed.**\n\n**There are two interesting aspects to the observed HTTP traffic. Firstly, the user-agent is hardcoded in the malware**\n**and as shown in the above figures, the same user-agent is used in both GET requests. Secondly, the victim IP is**\n**stored as the SHO value in the cookie field in the HTTP GET request to the C2 server. Both characteristics are useful**\n**for detection the presence of this particular malware.**\n\n**The malware is configured to use the following hosts for c2 servers:**\n\n**Domain** **IP** **Last seen**\n\n**203.124.14[.]241** **03/12/2015**\n\n**ustar5.PassAs[.]us**\n\n**103.193.150[.]33** **15/12/2015**\n\n**dnt5b.myfw[.]us** **127.0.0.1** **15/12/2015**\n\n**-** **203.124.14[.]241** **-**\n\n**As the malware attempts to establish contact with each of the designated C2 server, the malware also logs the errors**\n**in a .tmp log file stored in the** **%TEMP% directory:**\n\n**Figure 16: Log file generated by the malware during execution logging failed attempts at establishing contact**\n**with configured C2s.**\n\n## Functionalities\n\n**By examining the code constructs in the malware, we found evidence of the following functions:**\n\n**File upload – upload file to server**\n\n**File download – download file to victim machine**\n\n**Remote shell – spawn remote shell**\n\n**File system reconnaissance – obtain file metadata data**\n\n**Process enumeration – enumerate running processes**\n\n**Some of these functionalities are visible in the ASCII strings from the embedded payload** **ASDASDASDASDSAD:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17: Strings from the malware show hints on the functionalities offered by the malware.**\n\n## Association with LOTUS BLOSSOM\n\n**Our first step in attempting to tie activity to known campaigns is to look for any infrastructure overlaps between the**\n**domains used and those used previously by known threat actors, however we were unable to identify any**\n**infrastructure overlap in this case.**\n\n**However, network infrastructure is not the only method for attribution. Other useful methods include common tools and**\n**techniques used by threat actors, as well as any other behavioural patterns in the modus operandi associated with**\n**specific threat actors.**\n\n**In this case, we believe the sample analysed is associated with the ‘Lotus Blossom’ threat** **[actor based on the](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/ and https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Yarochkin-In-Depth-Analysis-of-Escalated-APT-Attacks-Slides.pdf )**\n**following characteristics which are also seen in other samples associated with the actor:**\n\n**The use of Microsoft Office document with content in Traditional Chinese as initial lure and exploit;**\n\n**The targeting of Taiwanese individuals (Taiwan is often the target of the Lotus Blossom group) ;**\n\n**The malware is written in C++ (like most other malware used by the Lotus Blossom threat actor);**\n\n**The mention of Loader.dll (a filename referenced in other Elise samples);**\n\n**The use of dynamic DNS domains, including use of the same providers;**\n\n**The fixed user-agent Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1** **) ;**\n\n**Mutex string Global\\{7BDACDEE-8BF6-4664-B946-D00FCFF1FFBA};**\n\n**The format of the configuration for the C2 servers (e.g.** **Server1=%s) ; and;**\n\n**The presence of a JSON-like string within the malware matching the following regular expression: \\**\n\n**{\\\"r\\\":\\\"[0-9]{12}\\\",\\\"l\\\":\\\"[0-9]{12}\\\",\\\"u\\\":\\\"[0-9]{7}\\\",\\\"m\\\":\\\"[0-9]**\n\n**{12}\\\"\\}.**\n\n**These relationships are displayed graphically in the Maltego graph below:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 18: Some overlapping features among related samples, including the sample analysed in this blog-**\n**c205fc5ab1c722bbe66a4cb6aff41190.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Taiwan has long been heavily targeted by espionage threat actors and ‘Lotus Blossom’ is one of the most active threat**\n**actors currently targeting the country. The analysis presented in this blog provides an overview of one of their latest**\n**malware variants and new network infrastructure associated with the group. The compile time of the sample shows**\n**that the malware was compiled in November which indicates that the group is still actively targeting Taiwanese**\n**victims.**\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**To help detect the presence of the malware described in this blog, we have included both network and host based**\n**signatures in the Appendix.**\n\n## Further Information\n\n**We specialise in providing the services required to help clients resist, detect and respond to advanced cyber attacks.**\n**This includes crisis events such as data breaches, economic espionage and targeted intrusions, including those**\n**commonly referred to as APTs.
