The choice of target made this campaign\n\nespecially significant – it meant the attackers gained access to a wide range of government\n\nresources at one fell swoop. We believe this access was abused, for example, by inserting malicious\n\nscripts in the country’s official websites in order to conduct watering hole attacks.\n\nThe operators used the HyperBro Trojan as their last-stage in-memory remote administration tool\n\n(RAT). The timestamps for these modules are from December 2017 until January 2018. The anti-\n\ndetection launcher and decompressor make extensive use of Metasploit’s shikata_ga_nai encoder as\n\nwell as LZNT1 compression.\n\nKaspersky Lab products detect the different artifacts used in this campaign with the following\n\nverdicts: Trojan.Win32.Generic, Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Upatre and Backdoor.Win32.HyperBro.

Also the C2 domain update.iaacstudio[.]com was\n\npreviously used in their campaigns. The tools found in this campaign, such as the HyperBro Trojan,\n\nare regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. Regarding Metasploit’s shikata_ga_nai\n\nencoder – although it’s available for everyone and couldn’t be the basis for attribution, we know this\n\nencoder has been used by LuckyMouse previously.\n\nGovernment entities, including the Central Asian ones also were a target for this actor before. Due to\n\nLuckyMouse’s ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect\n\nthat one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject\n\nJavaScripts into them.\n\n## How did the malware spread?\n\nThe initial infection vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear. Even when we\n\nobserved LuckyMouse using weaponized documents with CVE-2017-118822 (Microsoft Office\n\nEquation Editor, widely used by Chinese-speaking actors since December 2017), we can´t prove they\n\nwere related to this particular attack. It’s possible the actor used a waterhole to infect data center\n\nemployees.\n\nThe main C2 used in this campaign is bbs.sonypsps[.]com, which resolved to IP-address, that belongs\n\nto the Ukrainian ISP network, held by a Mikrotik router using firmware version 6.34.4 (from March\n\n2016) with SMBv1 on board. We suspect this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to\n\nprocess the malware’s HTTP requests. The Sonypsps[.]com domain was last updated using GoDaddy\n\non 2017-05-05 until 2019-03-13.\n\n\n-----\n\n_FMikrotik router with two-year-old firmware and SMBv1 on board used in this campaign_\n\nIn March 2017, Wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting Mikrotik called ChimayRed.\n\nAccording to the documentation, however, it doesn’t work for firmware versions higher than 6.30.\n\nThis router uses version 6.34.\n\nThere were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017. Shortly after\n\nthat different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain\n\nupdate.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites. These events suggest\n\nthat the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected.\n\n## What did the malware do in the data center?\n\n\n-----\n\n_Anti-detection stages. Different colors show the three dropped modules: legit app (blue),_\n\n_launcher (green), and decompressor with the Trojan embedded (red)_\n\nThe initial module drops three files that are typical for Chinese-speaking actors: a legit Symantec\n\npcAnywhere (IntgStat.exe) for DLL side loading, a .dll launcher (pcalocalresloader.dll) and the last\nstage decompressor (thumb.db). As a result of all these steps, the last-stage Trojan is injected into\n\nsvchost.exe’s process memory.\n\nThe launcher module, obfuscated with the notorious Metasploit’s shikata_ga_nai encoder, is the\n\nsame for all the droppers. The resulting deobfuscated code performs typical side loading: it patches\n\npcAnywhere’s image in memory at its entry point. The patched code jumps back to the decryptor’s\n\nsecond shikata_ga_nai iteration, but this time as part of the whitelisted application.\n\n\n-----\n\nresolves the necessary API functions, decompresses the embedded PE file with RtlCompressBuffer()\n\nusing LZNT1 and maps it into memory.\n\n## What does the resulting watering hole look like?\n\nThe websites were compromised to redirect visitors to instances of both ScanBox and BEeF. These\n\nredirects were implemented by adding two malicious scripts obfuscated by a tool similar to the Dean\n\nEdwards packer.\n\n_Resulting script on the compromised government websites_\n\nUsers were redirected to https://google-updata[.]tk:443/hook.js, a BEeF instance, and\n\nhttps://windows-updata[.]tk:443/scanv1.8/i/?1, an empty ScanBox instance that answered a small\n\n\n-----\n\nLuckyMouse appears to have been very active recently. The TTPs for this campaign are quite\n\ncommon for Chinese-speaking actors, where they typically provide new solid wrappers (launcher and\n\ndecompressor protected with shikata_ga_nai in this case) around their RATs (HyperBro).\n\nThe most unusual and interesting point here is the target. A national data center is a valuable source\n\nof data that can also be abused to compromise official websites. Another interesting point is the\n\nMikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign. The reasons for this are\n\nnot very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don’t bother disguising their campaigns. Maybe\n\nthese are the first steps in a new stealthier approach.\n\n## Some indicators of compromise\n\nDro ppe rs\n\n22CBE2B0F1EF3F2B18B4C5AED6D7BB79\n\n0D0320878946A73749111E6C94BF1525\n\nLaunche r\n\nac337bd5f6f18b8fe009e45d65a2b09b\n\nHype rBro in-m e m o ry T ro jan\n\n04dece2662f648f619d9c0377a7ba7c0\n\nDo m ains and IPs\n\nbbs.sonypsps[.]com\n\nupdate.iaacstudio[.]com\n\nwh0am1.itbaydns[.]com\n\ngoogle-updata[.]tk\n\n\n-----\n\n####   \n\n\n### Related Posts\n\n###### VPNFilter EXIF to C2 IT threat evolution Q1 mechanism analysed 2018.
