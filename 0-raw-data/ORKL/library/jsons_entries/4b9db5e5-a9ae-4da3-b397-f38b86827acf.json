An Analysis of a New, Never-Before-Seen Malware Variant\n\n**[deepinstinct.com/blog/arid-gopher-the-newest-micropsia-malware-variant](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/arid-gopher-the-newest-micropsia-malware-variant)**\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\n## 100% Prevention Score in the 2022 MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation for Enterprise\n\n[Learn more](https://www.deepinstinct.com/news/deep-instinct-shows-100-percent-score-in-mitre-evaluations)\n\nMarch 21, 2022 | [Simon Kenin, Asaf Gilboa](https://www.deepinstinct.com/author/simon-kenin)\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nDeep Instinct’s Threat Research team has found a new, undocumented malware developed in Golang\nThe malware is attributed to APT-C-23 (Arid Viper)\nFurther research revealed additional, previously unseen second-stage payloads\n\nNew Malware Variant Discovery: Arid Gopher\n\nOur Threat Research team maintains a vigilant watch over the cyber threat landscape, hunting for malware as\na normal course of operations. The team recently encountered an executable file written in the Go\nprogramming language. The identified file was initially submitted to VirusTotal on December 29, 2021 and was\n\n\n-----\n\ndetected by only six security vendors.\n\nAfter initial inspection, two additional similar files written in Go have been found. During the analysis of these\nfiles, the team identified a previously unseen variant of Arid Gopher malware; the new unknown malware is a\nvariant of the Micropsia malware, written and used exclusively by APT-C-23 (Arid Viper).\n\nMicropsia and Arid Viper\n\n[This strain of malware was first identified in 2017 by “360 Security,” but later re-named to Micropsia. This](https://apt.360.cn/orgDetail/27)\nmalware targets computers running Windows OS.\n\nThe threat actor behind the Micropsia malware is known by the name APT-C-23 or Arid Viper. This malware\nhas primarily been used to target the Middle East region, with specific interest against Palestinian targets.\n\nArid Viper also has a unique Android malware that has been used against Israeli targets. Arid Viper has been\n[previously linked to the Hamas organization.](https://www.idf.il/en/minisites/hamas/hamas-uses-fake-facebook-profiles-to-target-israeli-soldiers/)\n\nBoth the Windows and Android malware versions are constantly evolving. In April 2021, Facebook (now Meta)\n[published a threat report about Arid Viper. In the report they identified a new iOS malware developed by APT-](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf)\nC-23. Facebook highlighted the specifics of how the threat actor had constantly changed the programming\nlanguage used for developing the Micropsia malware which included Pascal, Delphi, C++, and even Python.\n\nWhat is Arid Gopher?\n\nDuring our investigation of the three files written in Go, we uncovered a novel variant of the Micropsia malware\nfamily written in Go, which we named Arid Gopher.\n\nThis new variant is still being developed; all the three files share a common baseline, but each file contains\nunique code which is not present in the other files.\n\nBeside the main implant, our investigation revealed a “helper” malware, also written in Go, and a second-stage\nmalware which was downloaded from the C2 server.\n\nWe provide a brief analysis of all the newly found samples and in-depth analysis of just one of them following.\n\nWhat is Arid Gopher V1?\n\nThis variant is written in Go 1.16.5gs and contains public code from libraries found on GitHub:\n\nArid Gopher variant contains public code from libraries in GitHub\nDeveloping the variant in this manner saves the author time by not needing to write some features from\nscratch. It also adds some degree of legitimacy because those libraries are not malicious, but the malware\nauthor abuses the libraries’ capabilities for malicious purposes.\n\nLibrary Usage\n\n\nhttps://github.com/zetamatta/go-windowsshortcut\n\n\nCreate Shortcut for persistence.\n\n\n[https://github.com/go-ole/go-ole](https://github.com/go-ole/go-ole) A dependency of the go-windows-shortcut library.\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://github.com/lxn/win](https://github.com/lxn/win) A Windows API wrapper package for the Go Programming\nLanguage.\n\n[https://github.com/kbinani/screenshot](https://github.com/kbinani/screenshot) Create screenshots of the infected computer\n\n[https://github.com/gonutz/w32](https://github.com/gonutz/w32) Windows API wrapper for the Go Programming Language.\n\nAll of the above libraries also exist in Arid Gopher V2 alongside additional libraries, except for the “gowindows-shortcut” library which has been replaced by another library with similar functionality.\n\nThe function names in V1 have unique and innocent names such as\n“infoSchoolManagerAboutRecievingHomeworksDone” and “wakeUpWhatIsInMyBag,” function names have\nbeen renamed in V2 to be more generic.\n\nThis variant is using the domain “grace-fraser[.]site” as a C2.\n\n[Grace Fraser is the name of a character from HBO TV show “The Undoing.” Arid Viper is](https://theundoing.fandom.com/wiki/Grace_Fraser) [known to use many](https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/apt-attack-middle-east-big-bang/)\nreferences to TV shows; similar behavior was observed with Arid Gopher V2.\n\n[The C2 is using the “Laravel” framework which was used by Arid Viper in previous campaigns.](https://github.com/laravel/framework)\n\nThis variant was uploaded to VirusTotal at the end of August 2021 inside a RAR archive named “ﺗﻌﺮﯾﻒ وأﻫﺪاف\nودواﻓﻊ اﻻﺳﺘﺜﻤﺎر.xz” from the UAE, which might indicate the region in which the target is located.\n\nThe practice of sending variants of Micropsia inside archives with the extension “.xz” has been observed\n[several times in Arid Viper campaigns.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/02/arid-viper-targets-palestine.html)\n\nThe filename roughly translates to “definition, objectives, and motives for investment.”\n\nIn order to trick the user into thinking they are opening an innocent Word document the threat actor uses two\nmasquerading techniques:\n\nFirst, it uses the Microsoft Word Office document icon.\nSecond, it uses a very long file name (see image below), preventing the user from seeing the ‘.exe’ file\nextension.\n\nArid Gopher File Name\nLastly, upon execution of the file, the malware will write a benign decoy office document to the folder\n“C:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPS” and will present It to the victim:\n\n\n-----\n\nArid Gopher Benign Decoy Office Document\nThe combination of those three social engineering elements is intended to fool unsuspecting victims to run the\nmalware and present them with decoy documents as they would expect from opening a Word document. This\nbehavior is consistent in Arid Viper attacks utilizing Micropsia.\n\nThe decoy document contains sections from an academic publication regarding financial investments. The\n[original article can be found in this link.](https://www.iasj.net/iasj/article/50866)\n\n[The malware creates a LNK file and copies it to the startup folder for persistence using the name of the](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd)\nmalware executable.\n\nSystem info collection:\n\n1. The malware writes a base64 blob containing <current_user>_<random_ID> to\n\n“C:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPS\\MSAProfileNotificationHandler.txt”\n2. The malware checks for installed Antivirus products by running the following command: cmd /c WMIC\n\n/Node:localhost /Namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List\n3. The function “app_myLib_student_GetFatherName” returns a string containing the OS version, which\n\nuses RtlGetVersion() and returns a string such as “Microsoft Windows [version 6.1.7601]”\n\nThe malware uses the custom User-Agent “aimxxhwpcc” while sending data to the C2 server\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware creates a mutex named ABCMedia .\n\nWhat is Arid Gopher V2?\n\nWe found two versions of this variant that had been used in the beginning of 2022.\n\nThe main difference between the two samples is the decoy content. We will first show the similarities and later\nwill show the difference between the two V2 samples.\n\nThose samples are written in Go 1.17.4 and contain some of the public libraries found at V1 and the following\nlibraries:\n\nArid Gopher V2 Libraries\n\nLibrary Usage\n\n[https://github.com/bi-zone/wmi](https://github.com/bi-zone/wmi) Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for Go.\n\n[https://github.com/bi-zone/go-ole](https://github.com/bi-zone/go-ole) Dependency for the above WMI library.\n\n[https://github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror) Error handling.\n\n[https://github.com/hashicorp/errwrap](https://github.com/hashicorp/errwrap) Error handling.\n\n[https://github.com/scjalliance/comshim](https://github.com/scjalliance/comshim) Ensures that at least one thread within a Go process\nmaintains an initialized connection to the component\nobject model runtime in Windows.\n\n[https://github.com/btcsuite/winsvc](https://github.com/btcsuite/winsvc) Windows service library written in Go.\n\n[https://github.com/danieloliveira085/autostarter](https://github.com/danieloliveira085/autostarter) Go library that creates a shortcut to run automatically at\nstartup and supports cross-compilation between Windows\nand Linux.\n\n\n[https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice)\n\n(only in PDF sample)\n\n\nGo package that makes working with resources such as\nhtml, js, css, images, templates, etc. very easy.\n\n\nThose samples don’t have the Student/School functions name theme, however, using [BinDiff we identified an](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/03/bindiff-now-available-for-free.html)\nexact match between functions in V1 & V2:\n\n\n-----\n\nV1 function name V2 function name Functionality\n\napp_myLib_student_GetFatherName DSA2_DSA2PKG_Properties_OS Retrieves OS version\nusing RtlGetVersion()\n\napp_myLib_student_GetStudentName DSA2_DSA2PKG_Properties_Name V1: Generates an\nidentifier based on\nthe %USERNAME%,\ncurrent time, and\nrandom seed\n\nV2: The identifier is\nmade from the\nhostname and\n%USERNAME%\n\napp_myLib_driver_DoWhatIsTheDriverWants DSA2_DSA2PKG_Proc_StartCMD Runs “cmd /c\n<argument>” and\nretrieves the output\n\nmain_CreateMutex DSA2_DSA2PKG_Mutex_CreateMutex Calls\nkernel!CreateMutexW\nwith the given string\n\nThose samples are using the domain “pam-beesly[.]site” as a C2.\n\n[Pam Beesly is a yet another name of a character from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Beesly) TV show (The Office) and the same motive has been\nobserved in V1 and older Micropsia variants.\n\nThe following functions exist in V2 version:\n\n\n-----\n\nArid Gopher V2 Functions\n\nIf the process command line doesn’t contain “-st”, then the “main_ExResAndRun” function is called, which\n[extracts the decoy document from the assets of the file using the library bindata.](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata)\n\nThe “SoftTookkitPSA” mutex is attempted to be created and if it fails then os.Exit() is called, terminating the\nprocess:\n\nArid Gopher V2 Mutex code\n\nAs can be seen in the image above the author most likely made a typo: “Tookkit” instead of Toolkit\n\n\n-----\n\nThis mutex ensures there s only one instance of the malware running.\n\nThe malware queries WMI for installed AV products. If “360 Total Security” is present, the malware will call the\nfunction “main_Reg360” to download and execute a second-stage malware we called “Arid Helper.” A\ndescription of “Arid Helper” is provided in a later section of this article.\n\nIf the computer does not have “360 Total Security” antivirus installed, “main_addST” is called:\n\nAridHelper’s AV check\n\nThe function “main_addST” creates a LNK shortcut named “NetworkBoosterUtilities.lnk” in the Startup folder,\nwhich links to the malware full-file path.\n\nArid Gopher V2 LNK persistence code\n\nThe LNK contains the argument “-st” which is used to start the malware without displaying the decoy\ndocument:\n\n\n-----\n\nArid Gopher: -st argument to start the malware\n“-st” is most likely a prefix for the word start. In the [Delphi variants of Micropsia, the LNK contained the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/02/arid-viper-targets-palestine.html)\nargument “-start” for the same purpose.\n\n[The function “DSA2_DSA2PKG_STRun_AddSTShortcut” uses the autostarter library to set up the malware](https://github.com/danieloliveira085/autostarter)\npersistence in the Startup directory of the running user.\n\nAfterwards, the function “main_createMainDir” is called which creates the\nC:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPSK directory that will store screenshots and other information collected\nby the malware.\n\nSystem info collection:\n\n1. Similar to V1, the malware writes a base64 blob, this time also containing the computer name, in the\n\nformat <computer_name>_<current_user>_<random_ID> to\n“C:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPSK\\MSAProfileNotificationHandler.txt”\n2. The malware takes a screenshot and saves it as a PNG file to the same folder mentioned above\n\n“C:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPSK”\n3. The malware (only 3d7d75d66428c55dc81563c3bde5477977fadb3325d0224ef9313da133940077) is\n\nexecuting the following commands:\n\ncmd /c ipconfig /release\n\ncmd /c ipconfig /renew\n\nThis is done by calling “cmd.exe,” similar to the WMI query in V1.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. The malware checks for installed Antivirus products by running a WMI query. Unlike V1 that used\n\ncmd.exe to query WMI, the malware uses the [bi-zone WMI imported library by calling a function named](https://github.com/bi-zone/wmi)\n“DSA2_DSA2PKG_Properties_AV\":\n\nArid Gopher malware checks for installed\n\nantivirus products by running a WMI query\n5. The function “app_myLib_student_GetFatherName” that was present in V1 was renamed to\n\n“DSA2_DSA2PKG_Properties_OS”\n\nThe function “main_sendBasicInfo” collects the following information about the computer and sends it to the\nC&C server:\n\n**Field Name** **Field Value**\n\nename The asset name containing the name of the decoy .pdf to be opened\n\nen Set to 2\n\ndevice_name Base64 encoded

server.](https://github.com/kbinani/screenshot)\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, main_getRequestsAndDoIt is responsible for a loop which sends GET requests to the C2.\n\nThe response is a JSON, unmarshalled into a struct named “main.REQ,\" which has the following definition:\n\nArid Gopher V2: main.REQ definition\n\nThe C&C server needs to send a response with the following JSON object:\n\nArid Gopher V2 server response with JSON object\n\nID: A number that is used later for C&C commands to build a URL\nType: The name of the command to run\nValue: The value of the command\nStatus: Unused\nencoded_file_url: Used in the \"d\" command as the resource file to download\n\nMost of the time an empty array will be sent by the server, which will make the sample wait a random number\nof seconds until it sends another GET request.\n\nHere are the following supported commands (i.e., for the possible “type” field):\n\nType Details\n\ns Takes a screenshot and sends it to the server\n\nc Runs the command in the “value” field in CMD\n\nd If the field “encoded_file_url” is present, download and execute a 2nd-stage payload from\n“<C2_address>/<id>/download_app_download-by-id/<encoded_file_url> to

Palestine, which might indicate the\ncountry in which the target is located, since Arid Viper is known to focus on attacking Palestinian targets.\n\nThe icon of the malware is the exact same Word Icon that was used in V1.\n\nIf a victim opens the file, the malware will write a benign decoy office document to the folder\n“%AppData%\\Local\\Temp\\<random_number>\\” and will present It to the victim:\n\nArid Gopher V2: decoy office document opens in %AppData%\\Local\\Temp\\\\ folder\n[This document contains content from a Saudi blog named “Almrsal” with information on how to write a

archive named “The modified\nopening session program 29-1-2022_ page -0001.xz” from Palestine, which likely indicates which country the\ntarget is located.\n\nThe practice of sending variants of Micropsia inside archives with the extension “.xz” has been observed with\nV1, as well as in [several others Arid Viper campaigns.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/02/arid-viper-targets-palestine.html)\n\nThe archive was downloaded from the URL “https://filetransfer[.]io/data-package/NDqgYm80/download,” a free\nfile upload service, however it is unknown how the victim(s) receive this URL.\n\n\n-----\n\n”In the wild” URL containing archive with Arid Gopher V2 variant\n[This file has been observed by security expert “MalwareHunterTeam” as suspicious, but no formal attribution](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1489591376840957952)\nhas been made.\n\nUnlike V1 and the previous V2 sample, this variant has a PDF icon.\n\nThe malware executable inside the archive contains a double extension “The modified opening session\nprogram 29-1-2022_page-0001 98656456363546 4565546454645 98984938493854 pdf .exe”\n\nThe usage of double extensions, specifically “pdf.exe” with a combination of a long filename, has been\n[observed in previous Arid Viper campaigns.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWvyqGVgjF5DgZ9DntpCRBbwMkHRRP9exiaFx6R-2GdlBNKY_IAt2taKKAbYh6ngo1q8FcUzkdG2MqWWMeCbecC_5prnU01NCPMLuxgJakjDERMB1OCio1wBpWWNdbp5s50dNCUgqZRuaEEzfplrUViZwVIx1ehySepQ_vfxaZ3ivizCTIcxy-u6s9oA=s16000)\n\nIf the victim is opening the file, the malware will write a benign decoy PDF document named “The modified\nopening session program 29-1-2022_page-0001 98656456363546 4565546454645 98984938493854.pdf” to\nthe folder “%TEMP%\\<current_date_and_time>” and will present It to the victim:\n\n\n-----\n\nArid\n\n\nGopher V2: document meeting summary of Palestinian National Council\nThe document contains an official meeting summary of the Palestinian National Council.\n\nAdditional 2nd Stage Payloads\n\nArid Helper:\nDuring the analysis of the V2 sample we noticed that if the WMI query for installed security products returns\n“360 total security” then the malware will call an additional function instead of “main_addST” as can be seen in\nFigure 10.\n\nThe function “main_addST” is responsible for creating the LNK shortcut as we described in V2 analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, if 360 total security is found to be installed, the malware calls a function named main_Reg360.\nThis function then calls another function named “main_DownReqApp” which downloads additional payload\nfrom the C2 server from the following URL: “http[:]//pambeesly[.]site/J2FWAHfmgH573SUB/download_app/download-by-name/SystemNetworkEventsNotification”\n\nThe file is saved as “C:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPSK\\SystemNetworkEventsNotification.txt”.\n\nAfterwards, a function named “DSA_DSA2PKG_FileByte_DecodeByte” is called to convert the downloaded file\ninto an executable named “C:\\ProgramData\\NotificationControllerPSK\\SystemNetworkEventsNotification.exe”\nand the text file is being deleted.\n\nThe final executable is also written in Go language and its’ sole purpose appears to be to create an alternative\npersistence mechanism in case “360 total security” is installed.\n\n[As a side note, 360 Total Security were the first to publish about the Windows malware which was later named](https://apt.360.cn/orgDetail/27)\nMicropsia that Arid Viper continues to develop and improve.\n\nThis “helper” executable can receive the following parameters:\nv=<PersistenceName> - Creates a registry run key with the given value name.\nd=<PathToExecutable> - Sets the registry value to the path provided\n-st - Unused\n-old - Unused\n\n[The executable will use the Golang App Shutdown Hooks library, and set a shutdown hook that will add a run](https://github.com/ztrue/shutdown)\nkey with the parameters used to set persistence.\n\nA shutdown hook function is called when the process receives an event for termination. Since the console for\nthe process is hidden, it is in high likelihood that the intention of this executable is to add a registry run key\nwhen the computer shuts down.\n\nAdditional Second Stage Payload:\n\nWhile analyzing the traffic from the V2 variant, we noticed that at some point a URL that was returning an\nempty JSON response started to respond with data.\n\nThe URL was called from the “main_getRequestsAndDoIt” function.\n\nAt one point, the URL returned a base64 blob, which when decoded, revealed another executable file:\n\n\n-----\n\nPE\n\ninformation for the second stage malware\nThis sample is not written in Go, but in Visual C++ and was compiled on February 14, 2021. It uses\nmozelllittel[.]com as a C2.\n\nThe C2 uses the Laravel framework, which is also used in other Arid Viper C2 servers.\n\nThe sample also creates an LNK in startup for persistence, like the Gopher variants.\n\nThis sample doesn’t display any decoy documents.\n\nWe will provide a further analysis of this sample in another blog post.\n\nConclusion\n\nMost current cybersecurity products fail to detect new malware and APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)\nbecause they rely on manually tuned heuristics. More advanced solutions use manually selected features,\nwhich are then fed into classical machine learning modules to classify the file as malicious or legitimate (and\neven then, the malware detection rates are quite poor). Several methods rely on running the malware in a\nsandbox environment to obtain more information. While this allows for more accurate detection, it comes at the\ncost of protection because it’s a very time-intensive process and will not prevent threats from executing.\n\nThe [Deep Instinct Prevention Platform stops known, unknown, and zero-day threats with the highest accuracy](https://www.deepinstinct.com/platform)\nand lowest false-positive rate in the industry. We stop attacks before they happen, identifying malicious files in\n<20ms, before execution.
