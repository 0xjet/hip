    "plain_text": "# Navigating Cybersecurity During a Pandemic: Latest Malware and Threat Actors\n\n**[umbrella.cisco.com/blog/navigating-cybersecurity-during-a-pandemic-latest-malware-and-threat-actors](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/navigating-cybersecurity-during-a-pandemic-latest-malware-and-threat-actors)**\n\nApril 1, 2020\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak tops all the news, google searches, and social media\nalerts for good reason. Globally, we need to stay informed of the latest news with this health\ncrisis. However, it’s also in the news due to malicious threat actors using COVID-19 as a lure\nto trick people into giving up account credentials, or to download malware.\n\nIn this blog post, we’re going to discuss the latest ways that we’ve seen threat actors using\nthe current health crisis in malicious campaigns, and the increase in Internet requests related\nto COVID-19 material.\n\n## Mass Information\n\nThreat actors often use the latest world events, popular news headlines, holidays etc. as\nthemes for malware content in order to stay relevant and entice victims to visit malicious\nwebsites or open malicious attachments in email. Given the global reach and urgency of the\ncurrent health crisis, it’s not surprising that COVID-19 has become a means for threat actors\nto deliver their latest malicious content.\n\n[Earlier this month, Brian Krebs reported on the use of fake coronavirus live update style](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/live-coronavirus-map-used-to-spread-malware/)\nmaps to spread the AzorUlt information stealing trojan. The public is very interested in\nstaying up to date on where the latest COVID-19 cases are happening around the world. If\n\n\n-----\n\n[we use Cisco Umbrella Investigate to look at the amount of query traffic seen on our](https://umbrella.cisco.com/products/umbrella-investigate?utm_medium=web-referral&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=umb-fy20-q3-content-blog-navigating-cybersecurity-during-a-pandemic&utm_term=pgm)\nresolvers going to one of these domains hosting a malicious live update map, you can see a\nspike in requests to this domain starting on March 11th, and continuing to gain more queries\nand maintain a steady flow of requests.\n\nInvestigate shows query traffic to a domain hosting a malicious COVID-19 map\n\n## A Surge in New Domains\n\nWe have certainly seen a surge in Internet requests to domains that include the word ‘covid’\nor ‘corona’ over the past two months. On February 19, our enterprise customers made\n562,144 queries to 8,080 unique domains containing these keywords. We saw an increase of\n1,907% in requests being made by March 19th, from 11,287,190 requests, across 47,059\ndomains containing these keywords. 4% of these 47k domains were blocked as malicious\nsites.\n\nBelow is a list of popular keywords we’ve seen used together with corona, virus, and covid\nfor new domain registrations:\n\nwuhan\nclinics\nlab\ntests\nselftestkit\npurchase kits\nhelpline\n\n\n-----\n\nA domain for sale using the keywords covid-19-wuhan\n\n## Malspam Attacks\n\nThreat actors continue to use email as an infection method, with malicious documents or\nembedded malicious links. One approach is disguising the email as coming from the World\nHealth Organization.\n\nThe emails state that the attachment contains important safety measures as directed from\nthe WHO. These attachments have been seen to be an archive file, pdf, or doc.\n\nSome of the malware threats that we’re tracking associated with COVID-19 scams are\nhighlighted below.\n\n**Kpot**\n\n_Description: Kpot is an information stealer that steals user data and account credentials. It is_\nvery easily available in various underground forums for a price of around $100 USD.\n\n**Nanocore**\n\n_Description: NanoCore RAT is a Remote Access Trojan which was first spotted in 2013._\nSince then, it has been available on the Dark Web. This trojan can be modified by its users\nas per their needs. The malware is capable of registry editing, process control, upgrade, file\ntransfer, keylogging, and password stealing.\n\n**Guloader**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Description: GuLoader is a downloader, written partly in VB6, which typically stores its_\nencrypted payloads on Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive. It is usually distributed as a\nportable executable (PE) file that is often observed embedded in a container file such as an\n.iso or .rar file. It is used predominantly to download Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and\ninformation stealers such as Agent Tesla, FormBook, NanoCore RAT, Netwire RAT, Remcos\nRAT, Ave Maria/Warzone RAT and Parallax RAT.\n\n**Trickbot**\n\n_Description: TrickBot was first seen in 2016 and is a banking trojan with advanced browser_\nmanipulation techniques, server-side injections and redirection techniques. It has most\nfamously been associated with malspam spread through the Emotet botnet and Trickbot’s\nCommand and Control servers have been seen as IOCs during investigations of Ryuk\nransomware infections. Trickbot has the ability to steal email credentials and address book\ninformation that is used to send malspam from the affected accounts. In 2020, Trickbot\nbegan to target Active Directory DCs and bypass Windows UAC elevated privlege alerts.\nTrickbot can spread laterally through an internal network.\n\n**Formbook**\n\n_Description: Formbook is a trojan information stealer spread through malspam with malicious_\ndocument or archive attachments. It was first observed in 2017. It operates with the\nMalware-as-a-service (MaaS) model making it easy for cyber criminals to operate.\n\n**Netwire**\n\n_Description: NetWire is a remote access trojan (RAT) which is widely used by cybercriminals_\nsince 2012. NetWire has a built-in keylogger that can capture inputs from peripheral devices\nsuch as USB card readers. Other targets include credentials for online accounts and\napplications such as email, property management systems (PMS), and internet browsers.\nOther sensitive information typed by the user, including Social Security numbers, phone\nnumbers, addresses, and birthdates can also be compromised. It was used in attacks\nagainst banks and healthcare companies and scammers to remotely control infected\nsystems.\n\n**MetaMorfo**\n\n_Description: Metamorfo is a banking trojan first seen in April 2018. Metamorfo’s primary_\ntarget location at the onset was Brazil. Today, it’s targets have spread to USA, Chile, Spain,\nMexico and others. The trojan gathers financial information, credit card numbers, and\npersonal data.\n\n## MetaMorfo: ‘Important Information’\n\nWe’re going to look into a malspam campaign that dropped the MetaMorfo payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targets of this malspam campaign were primarily Brazilian citizens. The emails\ncontained a malicious attachment when opened that would lead to the download of a zip\narchive. This file starts the malicious process to drop MetaMorfo onto the victim’s system.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n**_Dear User,_**\n\n**_• Read the conversation history that was sent to this email with WhatsApp_**\n**_Conversation at: 03/25/2020.txt_**\n\nThe hyperlink leads to:\n\nhxxp://www.servicosfcporto[.]com/upcloud7?WhatsApp_Historico_de_Conversas?\nwhatsapphistorico/index.html?visualizar=c06e8cf10aeaf00c33360d2b2bfb6792\n\nOne of the dropper/redirect domains redirecting to download malicious content from Dropbox\n\n\n-----\n\nA 301 call redirect from one of the observed domains to download content from Dropbox\nCisco Umbrella was able to detect the redirect/dropper domains used in this campaign with\nintelligence from our statistical models. We convicted the domain when we saw a suspicious\nspike in query traffic and other dns factors. For a deeper look into the statistical models that\n[caught this campaign and others like it, please see some presented research here by Dhia](https://www.first.org/resources/papers/conf2018/Mahjoub-Dhia_FIRST_20180712.pdf)\nMahjoub.\n\n\n-----\n\nInvestigate shows a spike in query traffic from a dropper/redirect domain\nAllowing the MetaMorfo trojan to execute in a sandbox reveals a command and control\nserver resolving to the following ip addresses:\n\nInvestigate shows the IP addresses associated with this command and control server\nWe had the following top countries requesting these malicious domains on our resolvers:\n\nRequestor geo distribution:\n\nBrazil, US, Canada, China, Italy, Poland, Singapore, Russia, Ireland\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat actors will use what works to increase malware infections, and the current COVID-19\npandemic is no different. Although it may seem urgent given the current circumstances, it’s\nbest to treat any attachments or links received from unknown or even known individuals with\n\n\n-----\n\ncaution before clicking.\n\nCisco continues to track malicious campaigns themed toward COVID-19 along with the many\nother tactics used by cyber criminals. Our statistical models analyze over 200 billion Internet\nrequests per day, convicting malicious infrastructure before it can be used in attack\n[campaigns.
