    "plain_text": "# Cytrox's Predator Spyware Targeted Android Users with Zero- Day Exploits\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/05/cytroxs-predator-spyware-target-android.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/cytroxs-predator-spyware-target-android.html)**\n\nMay 20, 2022\n\nGoogle's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday pointed fingers at a North Macedonian\nspyware developer named Cytrox for developing exploits against five zero-day (aka 0-day) flaws,\nfour in Chrome and one in Android, to target Android users.\n\n\"The 0-day exploits were used alongside n-day exploits as the developers took advantage of the\ntime difference between when some critical bugs were patched but not flagged as security issues\nand when these patches were fully deployed across the Android ecosystem,\" TAG researchers\n[Clement Lecigne and Christian Resell said.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/protecting-android-users-from-0-day-attacks/)\n\nCytrox is alleged to have packaged the exploits and sold them to different government-backed\nactors located in Egypt, Armenia, Greece, Madagascar, Côte d'Ivoire, Serbia, Spain, and Indonesia,\nwho, in turn, weaponized the bugs in at least three different campaigns.\n\n[The commercial surveillance company is the maker of Predator, an implant analogous to that of](https://www.securityweek.com/citizen-lab-exposes-cytrox-vendor-behind-predator-iphone-spyware)\nNSO Group's [Pegasus, and is known to have developed tools that enables its clients to penetrate](https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/experts-uncover-spyware-attacks-against.html)\niOS and Android devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In December 2021, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) disclosed that it had acted to remove](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/facebook-bans-7-cyber-mercenaries.html)\nroughly 300 accounts on Facebook and Instagram that the company used as part of its compromise\ncampaigns.\n\nThe list of the five exploited zero-day flaws in Chrome and Android is below \n**[CVE-2021-37973 - Use-after-free in Portals API](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/urgent-chrome-update-released-to-patch.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-37976 - Information leak in core](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/update-google-chrome-asap-to-patch-2.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-38000 - Insufficient validation of untrusted input in Intents (root cause analysis)](https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/google-releases-urgent-chrome-update-to.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-38003 - Inappropriate implementation in V8, and](https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/google-releases-urgent-chrome-update-to.html)**\n**[CVE-2021-1048 - Use-after-free in Android kernel (root cause analysis)](https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/google-warns-of-new-android-0-day.html)**\n\nAccording to TAG, all the three campaigns in question commenced with a spear-phishing email that\ncontained one-time links mimicking URL shortener services that, once clicked, redirected the\ntargets to a rogue domain that dropped the exploits before taking the victim to an authentic site.\n\n\"The campaigns were limited — in each case, we assess the number of targets was in the tens of\nusers,\" Lecigne and Resell noted. \"If the link was not active, the user was redirected directly to a\nlegitimate website.\"\n\nThe ultimate goal of the operation, the researchers assessed, was to distribute a malware dubbed\nAlien, which acts as a precursor for loading Predator onto infected Android devices.\n\nThe \"simple\" malware, which receives commands from Predator over an inter process\ncommunication (IPC) mechanism, is engineered to record audio, add CA certificates, and hide apps\nto evade detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nThe first of the three campaigns took place in August 2021. It used Google Chrome as a jumping off\npoint on a Samsung Galaxy S21 device to force the browser to load another URL in the Samsung\nInternet browser without requiring user interaction by exploiting CVE-2021-38000.\n\nAnother intrusion, which occurred a month later and was delivered to an up-to-date Samsung\nGalaxy S10, involved an exploit chain using CVE-2021-37973 and CVE-2021-37976 to escape the\n[Chrome sandbox (not to be confused with](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md) [Privacy Sandbox), leveraging it to drop a second exploit](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/google-releases-first-developer-preview.html)\nto escalate privileges and deploy the backdoor.\n\nThe third campaign — a full Android 0-day exploit — was detected in October 2021 on an up-todate Samsung phone running the then latest version of Chrome. It strung together two flaws, CVE2021-38003 and CVE-2021-1048, to escape the sandbox and compromise the system by injecting\nmalicious code into privileged processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle TAG pointed out that while CVE-2021-1048 was fixed in the Linux kernel in September\n[2020, it wasn't backported to Android until last year as the fix was not marked as a security issue.](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=77f4689de17c0887775bb77896f4cc11a39bf848)\n\n\"Attackers are actively looking for and profiting from such slowly-fixed vulnerabilities,\" the\nresearchers said.\n\n\"Tackling the harmful practices of the commercial surveillance industry will require a robust,\ncomprehensive approach that includes cooperation among threat intelligence teams, network\ndefenders, academic researchers and technology platforms.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
