By exploiting security\nflaws or misconfigurations, this type of cyber attack can destroy the firmware and/or basic\nfunctions of system. It is a contrast to its well-known cousin, [DDoS attacks, which overloads](https://www.radware.com/resources/ddos_attacks.aspx)\nsystems with requests meant to saturate resources through unintended usage.\n\n## BrickerBot – Discovery and Analysis of a PDoS Tool\n\n\n-----\n\nOver a four-day period, Radware s honeypot recorded 1,895 PDoS attempts performed from\nseveral locations around the world. Its sole purpose was to compromise IoT devices and\ncorrupt their storage. Besides this intense, short-lived bot (BrickerBot.1), Radware’s\nhoneypot recorded attempts from a second, very similar bot (BrickerBot.2) which started\nPermanent Denial of Service attempts on the same date – both bots were discovered less\nthan one hour apart –with lower intensity but more thorough and its location(s) concealed by\nTOR egress nodes.\n\n**Compromising a Device**\n\nThe [Bricker Bot Permanent Denial of Service attack used Telnet brute force - the same](https://security.radware.com/Security/ddos-threats-attacks/brickerbot-pdos-back-with-vengeance/)\n[exploit vector used by Mirai - to breach a victim’s devices. Bricker does not try to download a](https://security.radware.com/Security/ddos-threats-attacks/threat-advisories-attack-reports/mirai-botnet/)\nbinary, so Radware does not have a complete list of credentials that were used for the brute\nforce attempt, but were able to record that the first attempted username/password pair was\nconsistently 'root'/'vizxv.’\n\n**Corrupting a Device**\n\nUpon successful access to the device, the Permanent Denial of Service bot performed a\nseries of Linux commands that would ultimately lead to corrupted storage, followed by\ncommands to disrupt Internet connectivity, device performance, and the wiping of all files on\nthe device. Below is the exact sequence of commands that performed by the Permanent\nDenial of Service bots:\n\nCommand sequence of BrickerBot.1Figure 1: Command sequence of BrickerBot.1\n\nAmong the An accessible device for a Bricker Bot PDoS AttackFigure 2: An accessible device\nspecial\ndevices targeted are /dev/mtd (Memory Technology Device - a special device type to match\nflash characteristics) and /dev/mmc (MultiMediaCard - a special device type that matches\nmemory card standard, a solid-state storage medium).\n\nThe sysctl commands attempt to reconfigure kernel parameters: net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0\ndisables TCP timestamps which does not affect local LAN IPv4 connectivity but seriously\nimpacts the Internet communication, and kernel.threads-max=1 limits the max number of\nkernel threads to one. Typically, this is in the 10,000s for ARM-based devices.\n\n### Targets\n\nThe use of the 'busybox' command combined with the MTD and MMC special devices\nmeans this attack is targeted specifically at Linux/BusyBox-based IoT devices which have\ntheir Telnet port open and exposed publically on the Internet. These are matching the\ndevices targeted by Mirai or related IoT botnets.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PDoS attempts originated from a limited number of IP addresses spread around the\nworld. All devices are exposing port 22 (SSH) and running an older version of the [Dropbear](https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html)\nSSH server. Most of the devices were identified by Shodan as Ubiquiti network devices;\namong them are Access Points and Bridges with beam directivity.\n\nGeo mapped source IPs of BrickerBot.1Figure 3: Geo mapped source IPs of BrickerBot.1\n\nZoomEye query for Dropbear, port 22 reveals 21 million IPs with almost 5.5 million\ndiscovered/updated in 2017\n**Figure 4: ZoomEye query for Dropbear, port 22 reveals 21 million IPs with almost 5.5 million**\n**discovered/updated in 2017**\n\nIn parallel, Radware’s honeypot recorded over 333 PDoS attempts with a different command\nsignature. The source IP addresses from these attempts are TOR Nodes and hence there is\nno identifying the actual source of the attacks. It is worth noting that these attacks are still\nongoing and the attacker/author is using TOR egress nodes to conceal its bot(s). The first\ncredentials attempted to brute the Telnet login are root/root and root/vizxv. The sequence of\ncommands performed by this bot are:\n\nCommand sequence of BrickerBot.2Figure 5: Command sequence of BrickerBot.2\n\nThe commands used in these PDoS attempts are more thorough than the previously\ndescribed ones. The targeted storage devices are much broader and there is no use of\n'busybox' while attempting both 'dd' and 'cat,’ whichever is available on the breached device.\n\n## The Damage\n\nThe commands at the end are identical to the previously described PDoS attacks and try to\nremove the default gateway, wipe the device through rm -rf /* and disable TCP timestamps\nas well as limiting the max number of kernel threads to one. This time however, similar to the\nstorage corruption commands, extra commands were added to flush all iptables firewall and\nNAT rules and add a rule to drop all outgoing packets.\n\nBoth PDoS attacks started the same day and approximately the same time: March 20, 2017\n9.51PM CET vs March 20, 2017 9.10PM CET. While the first PDoS attacks from BrickerBot.1\nhave stopped, the attacks from BrickerBot.2, which are less dense but better concealed\nusing TOR egress nodes, are still active and ongoing.\n\n## Protecting IoT Devices and Securing the Network\n\n**Change the device’s factory default credentials.**\n**Disable Telnet access to the device.**\n**Network Behavioral Analysis can detect anomalies in traffic and combine with**\nautomatic signature generation for protection.\n**User/Entity behavioral analysis (UEBA) to spot granular anomalies in traffic early.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**An IPS should block Telnet default credentials or reset telnet connections. Use a**\nsignature to detect the provided command sequences.\n\n## Under Attack and in Need of Expert Emergency Assistance?
