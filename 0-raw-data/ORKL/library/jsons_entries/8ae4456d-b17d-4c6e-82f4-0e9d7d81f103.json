rather than just the exploits they\ncreate.\n\nThis is, he explained, a major step in fighting cyber security threats on a new battleground identifying and defending against human adversaries, rather than simply trying to block\nmalicious code.\n\nThe research firm's report says that Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) attacks have\nbecome a favourite attack vector of targeted attack groups originating from China and\nRussia, while the Numbered Panda group from China has been carrying out G20-themed\nspear phishing.\n\nThe Iran-based actor known as Magic Kitten, meanwhile, was spotted targeting prodemocratic activists as a precursor to the May 2013 Iranian elections, whilst the Russian\n_Energetic Bear group was very active against Western energy sector targets._\n\n_Emissary Panda, which CrowdStrike defines as a Chinese nexus intrusion group, has been_\ntargeting foreign embassies to deliver malware in a SWC campaign.\n\nThe report highlights the Russians as being involved in the same type of state-sponsored\n[attacks identified by Mandiant in its 2013 report on Chinese state-sponsored attack vectors.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140129192702/http://www.scmagazineuk.com/mandiant-report-highlights-chinese-cyber-threat-of-apt1/article/280827/)\n\n\"A recent investigation into the activity of a Russian-speaking adversary identified an actor\nwhose services may have been acquired for specific operations on behalf of a nation-state\ncustomer,” reads the analysis.\n\n“This adversary has been involved in targeted activity for nearly a decade, but malware\nanalysis showed significant similarities to known cybercrime activity utilising Sheldor and\nZeuS malware.”\n\n\"The combination of criminal and targeted activity suggests an adversary that conducts\nmalicious activity on its own accord, possibly as part of a continuing criminal enterprise, and\nalso at the direction of a government entity,\" it adds.\n\nThe report adds that the motivations of private entities that conduct operations in support of a\nnation-state may vary, but in certain circumstances, \"it may be that a government will turn a\nblind eye to criminal activity if an actor will use its skills to further the state's interests.\"\n\nIn other attacks, CrowdStrike says that it may well be that the private entity is a company that\nsells its expertise and resources to its government, or to the governments of other countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother motivation could be more nationalistic - possibly like the case of Deadeye Jackal,\nwhere a private group lends its services to the state out of a feeling of patriotism,\" the report\nconcludes.\n\nCommenting on the analysis of the state-sponsored attacks, leading analyst Sarb Sembhi, a\nDirector of Consulting with Incoming Thought, told SCMagazineUK.com that there are some\nassumptions that have to be made about state-level attacks, and one of these is that the\nattacks are very real and have been taking place for many years.\n\n\"If you look at the G20 nations, my observations suggest that if any of these countries are not\ninvolved in cyber warfare, then I would be very surprised,\" he said, adding that, whilst we\nhave yet to reach the stage where a single piece of malware has same damage potential as\na nuclear bomb, it is only a matter of time before that breakthrough is made.\n\nAt that point, says Sembhi - who is a leading light at ISACA, the not-for-profit IT security\nassociation - there will have to be a multi-country agreement on the control of cyber warfare,\njust as there has been with nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Nation states will have to agree on a set of rules in which they work out what can and\ncannot be done with state-sponsored malware and its like,\" he said.\n\n\n-----",
