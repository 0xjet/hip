Wednesday,_\nSeptember 11, 2019 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\n_In March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice_ _[indicted the Mabna Institute and nine Iranian](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-iranians-charged-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf-islamic-revolutionary)_\n_associates for compromising hundreds of universities to steal intellectual property and_\n_benefit financially. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers assigned the_\n\n\n-----\n\n_name COBALT DICKENS to this likely Iranian government-directed threat group. Despite this_\n_indictment and other disclosures of COBALT DICKENS campaigns, the threat group (also_\n_known as Silent Librarian) shows no signs of stopping its activity as of this publication._\n_CTU™ researchers have observed the threat actors using free online services as part of_\n_their operations, including free certificates, domains, and publicly available tools._\n\nIn July and August 2019, CTU researchers discovered a new large global phishing operation\nlaunched by COBALT DICKENS. This operation is similar to the threat group's August 2018\ncampaign, using compromised university resources to send library-themed phishing emails.\nThe messages contain links to spoofed login pages for resources associated with the\ntargeted universities. Unlike previous campaigns that contained shortened links to obscure\nthe attackers' infrastructure, these messages contain the spoofed URL (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Phishing message containing a link to a COBALT DICKENS domain (circled in red)._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nRecipients who click this link are directed to a web page that looks identical or similar to the\nspoofed library resource. After the victims enter their credentials, their web browsers are\nredirected to the next.php file, where the credentials are stored locally in the pass.txt file. The\nvictim's browser is then sent to the legitimate site being spoofed (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Lifecycle of a COBALT DICKENS credential-harvesting phishing operation._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nFor this campaign, the threat actors registered at least 20 new domains targeting over 60\nuniversities in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, and\nSwitzerland. These domains were registered using the Freenom domain provider, which\nadministers the following free top-level domains (TLDs) unless the domain is considered\n[\"special\":](https://www.freenom.com/en/freeandpaiddomains.html)\n\n.ml\n.ga\n.cf\n.gq\n.tk\n\nMany of these domains use valid SSL certificates, likely to make the spoofed pages appear\nauthentic. The overwhelming majority of the certificates observed in 2019 were issued by\nLet's Encrypt, a nonprofit organization that programmatically issues free certificates.\nHowever, past campaigns used certificates issued by the Comodo certificate authority.\n\n\n-----\n\n[COBALT DICKENS uses publicly available tools, including the SingleFile plugin available on](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile)\nGitHub and the free [HTTrack Website Copier standalone application, to copy the login pages](http://www.httrack.com/)\nof targeted university resources. Metadata in a spoofed login page created on August 1\nsuggests that COBALT DICKENS sometimes uses older copied versions of target websites.\nA comment left in the source code indicates it was originally copied on May 1, 2017 (see\nFigure 3). However, the university was targeted by numerous COBALT DICKENS operations,\nincluding the August 2018 and August 2019 campaigns.\n\n_Figure 3. A comment in the source code of a spoofed page created by COBALT DICKENS._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nMetadata in other spoofed web pages supports the assessment that the threat actors are of\nIranian origin. Specifically, a page copied on August 3 reveals an Iranian-related timestamp\n(see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Metadata in COBALT DICKENS spoofed web page indicating that an Iran-based_\n_threat actor may have copied the legitimate website. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAs of this publication, CTU researchers observed COBALT DICKENS targeting at least 380\nuniversities in over 30 countries. Many universities have been targeted multiple times. The\nthreat actors have not changed their operations despite law enforcement activity, multiple\npublic disclosures, and takedown activity.\n\n[Some educational institutions have implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) to](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/monash-uni-deploys-mfa-after-iran-attacks-targeting-universities-528055)\nspecifically address this threat. While implementing additional security controls like MFA\ncould seem burdensome in environments that value user flexibility and innovation, singlepassword accounts are insecure. CTU researchers recommend that all organizations protect\nInternet-facing resources with MFA to mitigate credential-focused threats.\n\nTo provide broader awareness of the threat group's campaigns and curtail its activities, CTU\nresearchers listed all known domains associated with COBALT DICKENS operations in Table\n1. Several domains used prior to the indictment remain in use as of this publication. CTU\nresearchers recommend that organizations use available controls to review and restrict\naccess to these domains. They may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before\nopening them in a browser.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\n-----\n\nmlibo.ml Domain\nname\n\nblibo.ga
