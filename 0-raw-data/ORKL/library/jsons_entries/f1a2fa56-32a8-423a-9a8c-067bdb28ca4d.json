    "plain_text": "# PRC STATE-SPONSORED CYBER ACTIVITY: ACTIONS FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LEADERS\n\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThis fact sheet provides an overview for executive leaders on the urgent risk posed by People’s Republic of China (PRC)\nstate-sponsored cyber actors known as “Volt Typhoon.” CISA—along with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI), and other U.S. government and international partners[1]—released a major advisory on Feb.\n7, 2024, in which the U.S. authoring agencies warned cybersecurity defenders that Volt Typhoon has been pre-positioning\nthemselves on U.S. critical infrastructure organizations’ networks to enable disruption or destruction of critical services in\nthe event of increased geopolitical tensions and/or military conflict with the United States and its allies. This is a critical\nbusiness risk for every organization in the United States and allied countries.[2]\n\nThe advisory provides detailed information related to the groups’ activity and describes how the group has successfully\ncompromised U.S. organizations, especially in the Communications, Energy, Transportation Systems, and Water and\nWastewater Systems Sectors.[3] The authoring organizations urge critical infrastructure owners and operators to review the\nadvisory for defensive actions against this threat and its potential impacts to national security.\n\nCISA and partners[4] are releasing this fact sheet to provide leaders of critical infrastructure entities with guidance to help\nprioritize the protection of critical infrastructure and functions. The authoring agencies urge leaders to recognize cyber\nrisk as a core business risk. This recognition is both necessary for good governance and fundamental to national security.\n\n1 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Australian\nSignals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Communications Security Establishment’s (CSE’s) Canadian\nCentre for Cyber Security (CCCS), United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and New Zealand National Cyber Security\nCentre (NCSC-NZ)\n2 CCCS assesses that Canada would likely be affected as well, due to cross-border integration. ASD’s ACSC and NCSC-NZ assess Australian\nand New Zealand critical infrastructure, respectively, could be vulnerable to similar activity from PRC state-sponsored actors.\n[3 See Critical Infrastructure Sectors | CISA for descriptions of critical infrastructure sectors.](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors)\n4 NSA, FBI, DOE, EPA, TSA, U.S. Department of the Treasury, ASD’s ACSC, CCCS, NCSC-UK, and NCSC-NZ\n\n_This document is marked TLP:CLEAR.

As a first step, organizations should use intelligence-informed prioritization tools, such\n[as the Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) or derived guidance from an SRMA. The CPGs help leaders make strategic](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals)\ninvestments in a limited number of essential actions with high-impact security outcomes. Second, empower and resource\ncybersecurity teams so they can:\n\n  - Effectively apply detection and hardening best Key best practices for your cybersecurity teams\n[practices contained in Identifying and Mitigating](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques) includes ensuring logging, including for access and\n[Living off the Land Techniques and PRC State-](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques) security, is turned on for applications and systems\n\nand logs are stored in a central system. Robust\n\n[Sponsored Actors Compromise and Maintain](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a)\n\nlogging is necessary for detecting and mitigating\n\n[Persistent Access to U.S. Critical Infrastructure. Volt](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a)\n\nliving off the land. Ask your IT teams which logs\n\nTyphoon does not rely on malware to maintain\n\nthey maintain as certain logs reveal commands\n\naccess to networks and conduct their activity. (referenced in the CSA) used by Volt Typhoon\nRather, they use built-in functions of a system. This actors. If your IT teams do not have the relevant\ntechnique, known as “living off the land,” enables logs, ask which resources they may need to\nthem to easily evade detection. To protect against effectively detect compromise.\nliving off the land, organizations need a\ncomprehensive and multifaceted approach, as described in these joint products.\n\n\n\n   - Receive continuous cybersecurity training and skill development that is relevant to the threat environment.\nContinuous training ensures that staff have the capabilities needed to defend their unique environments and\nmaintain good cyber hygiene.\n\n  - Develop comprehensive information security plans and conduct regular tabletop exercises.\n\n`o` Leaders should ensure personnel from all business sections, including executive leadership, are\ninvolved in development of the plan, sign off on it, and are aware of their roles and responsibilities.\nEnsuring comprehensive and tested plans are in place and approved enables cybersecurity teams to\nmake appropriate risk-informed decisions.\n`o` Refresh and test plans on an appropriate basis, and test OT systems and manual mode.\n\nFor smaller organizations without their own in-house cybersecurity teams, leaders should obtain managed security\nservices that can carry out this guidance to maintain sufficient cybersecurity posture.\n\n### Secure Your Supply Chain\n\nEnsure effective risk management policies are in place to minimize the likelihood of damage resulting from a\ncompromise.\n\n   - Establish strong vendor risk management processes to evaluate and monitor third-party risks, ensuring that\nsuppliers and partners adhere to strict security standards and any foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI)\nare clearly identified and managed, including consideration of, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce\nEntities List and Unverified List.\n\n   - Ensure those responsible for procurement:\n\n`o` Exercise due diligence when selecting software, devices, cloud service providers (CSPs), and managed\nservice providers (MSPs).\n\n          - [Use guidance including the secure by design principles](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design) to help inform vendor selection to\nreduce the availability of attack pathways threat actors can leverage. Follow best practices for\nsupply chain risk management and only source from reputable vendors.\n\n          - Ensure that the vendor has a patching plan in place that supports your organization and that\nyou can also support.\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` Identify and limit usage of any products that break the principle of least privilege, do not clearly\nenumerate needed access, or require disabling antivirus tools.\n`o` Select vendors that enable interoperability as a best practice for resilience and to avoid vendor lock-in.\n\nAs a leader, advocate for vendors to deliver secure and resilient systems and support staff efforts to integrate Secure by\nDesign principles into procurement/vendor contracting processes, including mechanisms for ensuring compliance and\npatching. Additionally, direct software development teams to integrate the Secure Software Development Framework\n[(SSDF) throughout your existing practices. Visit our webpage for more on Secure by Design.](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign)\n\n### Drive a Cybersecurity Culture\n\nEnsure performance management outcomes are aligned to the cyber goals of the organization by:\n\n  - Encouraging collaboration between IT, OT, cloud, cybersecurity, supply chain, and business units to align security\nmeasures with business objectives and risk management strategies.\n\n  - Championing organizational cybersecurity risk assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in the\nsecurity posture.\n\n  - Engaging with external cybersecurity experts and advisors for independent assessments and guidance tailored to\nyour organization and performing GAP analysis on findings.\n\n  - Increasing awareness of social engineering tactics and facilitating a culture which encourages incident\nreporting.[5]\n\n## INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\nIf your organization is impacted by an incident or suspected incident:\n\n  - Implement your cyber incident response plan.
