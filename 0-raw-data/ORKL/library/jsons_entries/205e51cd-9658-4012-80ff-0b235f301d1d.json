    "plain_text": "# Silos of Excellence\n\n**pylos.co/2020/05/28/silos-of-excellence/**\n\nJoe 05/28/2020\n\n[A new Twitter account appeared on 27 May 2020 for “NSA Cyber”, claiming the following:](https://twitter.com/NSACyber/status/1265739054563328000)\n```\n“Welcome to the intersection of threat intel, vulnerability analysis, and technical\nexpertise! All to better equip you against malicious #cyber activity.”\n\n```\nThis was a very interesting development, and a separate effort from the US National Security\n[Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) “official” or main Twitter account. Designed as](https://twitter.com/NSAGov)\n[an outlet specific for the NSA’s relatively new Cybersecurity Directorate, the account quickly](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/News-Stories/Article-View/Article/1973871/strengthening-the-front-line-nsa-launches-new-cybersecurity-directorate/)\nproved its bona fides by posting and linking to an NSA/CSS notification on ongoing\nSandworm activity less than a day later.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile interesting on its own for multiple reasons – adding further attribution fuel to the\nSandworm discussion and shedding light on ongoing activity by a particularly nasty actor –\nthis is [not the first time the Cybersecurity Directorate has directly notified the public of](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/News-Stories/Article-View/Article/1982939/nsa-cybersecurity-advisory-malicious-cyber-actors-leveraging-vpn-vulnerabilitie/)\nevents. Yet such actions stir confusion and add to an overall incoherence in US government\ncybersecurity policy and activity.\n\nNSA/CSS is a US Department of Defense (DOD) entity and the largest component of the US\nIntelligence Community. As such, its [mission focuses on signals intelligence, cryptography,](https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission-values/)\nand DOD signals and cyber security. The vast majority of NSA’s mission is offensive (or at\nleast espionage-oriented) in nature, making its role for playing a part in security in any\nnetwork beyond DOD highly contentious and controversial. That NSA/CSS is now utilizing\nthe Cybersecurity Directorate as an external-facing, publicly-communicating cybersecurity\narm is very strange – as presumably this already exists.\n\nCreated only in 2018, the US Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) would apparently fill the role of being the US\n[government’s vector for communicating with private industry given its mission. While CISA is](https://www.cisa.gov/about-cisa)\nfar from perfect, the idea at least finally created a non-military, civilian cybersecurity agency\n\n\n-----\n\nto serve as the focal point of US government non-military cyber efforts. Given NSA/CSS s\nprimary mission of signals intelligence (part of which includes conducting cyber intrusions),\nthe private sector is justifiably concerned that trusting this agency for defense could come at\nsignificant costs. CISA, although junior in age (and potentially expertise), addresses this core\nissue of trust by separating the role of liaison from military agencies.\n\nYet in standing up and using the Cybersecurity Directorate in this way, it would seem that\nNSA specifically (and perhaps DOD in general) are working to undermine CISA’s mission\nand standing as the lead agency responsible for critical infrastructure defense and\ncoordinating responses with US private industry. A healthy interagency relationship would\nlikely involve NSA and DOD communicating with DHS and CISA to share information, with\nCISA then taking the lead to promulgate advice and notifications to stakeholders. By going\ndirect, NSA implicitly has made the statement that CISA does not own this mission, cannot\nbe trusted to handle or analyze certain types of information (such as the Sandworm\nnotification), and that NSA (and DOD) will play an independent role in these matters.\n\nWhile we can argue that NSA will likely retain a capability and talent advantage over any\nDHS (or even other DOD) elements for the foreseeable future, legitimate questions of trust\nand primary mission focus mean NSA will never take a lead role in coordinating cyber\ndefense with private industry. Although imperfect, CISA at least represents a move in the\nproper direction to create a single point of access (and communication) for US government\ncybersecurity capability and concerns to the private sector.\n\nNSA’s use of the Cybersecurity Directorate in this fashion of public communication and\ndefense advisory undercuts CISA’s mission and continues the overall incoherence of US\ncyber policy and cyber defense. For those who have previously worked in the US\ngovernment, such activity is not surprising as cyber remains “sexy” – and a continued item of\nsignificance, which means a source of funding and prestige. Thus a scramble has ensued\nwhere various elements of the overall US government – DOD, DHS, the Department of\nEnergy, the Department of Commerce (hello National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology!), the Department of Justice, etc. – all attempt to “own” some aspect of the cyber\nmission.\n\nInteragency scrambles are especially nasty in the realm of government and private network\ndefense. NSA, US Cyber Command, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the\nDepartment of Energy (for electric and oil and gas activity), DHS, and CISA all have some\nstake in this matter, and some wish to own and direct this mission exclusively. The result is a\nmess where an entity with a question, concern, or an incident doesn’t know who to contact –\nCISA, their local FBI field office, DOE’s office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and\nEmergency Response (CESER), or some other organization.\n\nThe muddled ownership of the US government role in communicating with or assisting the\nprivate sector creates various problems. From lack of clarity in communication, uncertainty in\nidentifying relevant areas of expertise, to “playing one entity against another” tactics where\n\n\n-----\n\norganizations shop around until finding the agency most cooperative all add friction and\ndistraction to the overall defensive mission. Ultimately, the US government has a vested\ninterest in the security of private organizations representing critical infrastructure or national\nvalue (such as intellectual property). That decades into the information age the US\ngovernment is still schizophrenic in its approach to the issue is sad and self-defeating. CISA\nwas (and still could be) a good idea – allowing other entities to basically go rogue and act\nindependently undercuts an agency that is barely two years old, and will create more\nproblems than it may solve.\n\n\n-----",
