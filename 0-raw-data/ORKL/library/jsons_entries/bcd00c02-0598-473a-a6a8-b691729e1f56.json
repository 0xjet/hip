    "plain_text": "# Justice Department Announces Actions to Disrupt Advanced Persistent Threat 28 Botnet of Infected Routers and Network Storage Devices\n\n**[justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)**\n\nMay 23, 2018\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nWednesday, May 23, 2018\n\n## Additional action necessary worldwide to remediate the botnet.\n\nThe Justice Department today announced an effort to disrupt a global botnet of hundreds of\nthousands of infected home and office (SOHO) routers and other networked devices under\nthe control of a group of actors known as the “Sofacy Group” (also known as “apt28,”\n“sandworm,” “x-agent,” “pawn storm,” “fancy bear” and “sednit”). The group, which has been\noperating since at least in or about 2007, targets government, military, security organizations,\nand other targets of perceived intelligence value.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney Scott W.\nBrady for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Assistant Director Scott Smith for the FBI’s\nCyber Division, FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Johnson of the Pittsburgh Division and\nFBI Special Agent in Charge David J. LeValley of the Atlanta Division made the\nannouncement.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Department of Justice is committed to disrupting, not just watching, national security\ncyber threats using every tool at our disposal, and today’s effort is another example of our\ncommitment to do that,” said Assistant Attorney General Demers. “This operation is the first\nstep in the disruption of a botnet that provides the Sofacy actors with an array of capabilities\nthat could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including intelligence gathering, theft\nof valuable information, destructive or disruptive attacks, and the misattribution of such\nactivities.”\n\n“The United States Attorney’s Office will continue to aggressively fight against threats to our\nnational security by criminals, no matter who they work for” said U.S. Attorney Brady. “This\ncourt-ordered seizure will assist in the identification of victim devices and disrupts the ability\nof these hackers to steal personal and other sensitive information and carry out disruptive\ncyber attacks. We will be relentless in protecting the people of Western Pennsylvania - from\ninternational corporations to local businesses to the elderly - from these threats.”\n\n“Today's announcement highlights the FBI's ability to take swift action in the fight against\ncybercrime and our commitment to protecting the American people and their devices,” said\nAssistant Director Scott Smith. “By seizing a domain used by malicious cyber actors in their\nbotnet campaign, the FBI has taken a critical step in minimizing the impact of the malware\nattack. While this is an important first step, the FBI's work is not done. The FBI, along with\nour domestic and international partners, will continue our efforts to identify and expose those\nresponsible for this wave of malware.”\n\n“The FBI will not allow malicious cyber actors, regardless of whether they are statesponsored, to operate freely,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Johnson. “These\nhackers are exploiting vulnerabilities and putting every American’s privacy and network\nsecurity at risk. Although there is still much to be learned about how this particular threat\ninitially compromises infected routers and other devices, we encourage citizens and\nbusinesses to keep their network equipment updated and to change default passwords.”\n\n“This action by the FBI, DOJ, and our partners should send a clear message to our\nadversaries that the U.S. Government will take action to mitigate the threats posed by them\nand to protect our citizens and our allies even when the possibility of arrest and prosecution\nmay not be readily available,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge David J. LeValley. “As our\nadversaries’ technical capabilities evolve, the FBI and its partners will continue to rise to the\nchallenge, placing themselves between the adversaries and their intended victims.”\n\nThe botnet, referred to by the FBI and cyber security researchers as “VPNFilter,” targets\nSOHO routers and network-access storage (NAS) devices, which are hardware devices\nmade up of several hard drives used to store data in a single location that can be accessed\nby multiple users. The VPNFilter botnet uses several stages of malware. Although the\nsecond stage of malware, which has the malicious capabilities described above, can be\ncleared from a device by rebooting it, the first stage of malware persists through a reboot,\nmaking it difficult to prevent reinfection by the second stage.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to identify infected devices and facilitate their remediation, the U.S. Attorney s Office\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania applied for and obtained court orders, authorizing\nthe FBI to seize a domain that is part of the malware’s command-and-control infrastructure.\nThis will redirect attempts by stage one of the malware to reinfect the device to an FBIcontrolled server, which will capture the Internet Protocol (IP) address of infected devices,\npursuant to legal process. A non-profit partner organization, The Shadowserver Foundation,\nwill disseminate the IP addresses to those who can assist with remediating the VPNFilter\nbotnet, including foreign CERTs and internet service providers (ISPs).\n\n**Owners of SOHO and NAS devices that may be infected should reboot their devices**\n**as soon as possible, temporarily eliminating the second stage malware and causing the**\nfirst stage malware on their device to call out for instructions. Although devices will remain\nvulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet,\nthese efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the\ntime available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have also jointly notified trusted ISPs.\nThe Department and the FBI also encourage users and administrators to review the Cisco\n[blog post on VPNFilter, available HERE, for recommendations and to ensure that their](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\ndevices are updated with the latest patches.\n\nThe efforts to disrupt the VPNFilter botnet were led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh and Atlanta\nOffices; FBI Cyber Division; Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security\nDivision’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section; and Assistant U.S. Attorneys\nCharles Eberle and Soo C. Song of the Western District Pennsylvania. Critical assistance\nwas also provided by Richard Green of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section and The Shadowserver Foundation.\n\nNote: The documents filed by the Government as well as the court orders entered in this\ncase are available as attachments below.\n\n\n-----",
