But US officials aren't taking that for granted -- given the history of Russian\ncyber campaigns against US organizations, including an effort a few years ago to breach\nenergy and water firms.\n\n\n-----\n\nRead More\nAt least one previous Russian cyberattack in Ukraine has had global ramifications.\nA 2017 cyberattack that the Justice Department blamed on Russian military intelligence\nbegan by infecting a Ukrainian software provider, but spread around the world, causing\nbillions of dollars of damage.\nNow, US officials are watching closely in case any US response to Russia's military build-up\nportends an increase in the digital threats facing US organizations.\n\"We have the weather forecast [of potential Russian cyber threats],\" a US official told CNN.\n\"Now we're trying to see if there will be any inclement weather in the form of actual cyber\nincidents.\"\nIn addition, top White House cyber official Anne Neuberger is in Europe this week to talk with\nUS allies about how to support Ukraine in the event of Russian cyberattacks.\nRussia knows that \"disabling or destroying critical infrastructure\" through cyberattacks can\npressure another country into \"ceding to Russian objectives,\" Neuberger told reporters\nWednesday. \"We've been working closely with Ukrainians to harden their defenses and will\ncontinue to do so in the days ahead.\"\n\n## Lessons from past Russian hacking\n\nWhite House and federal agencies charged with cybersecurity have been on heightened\nalert, with officials checking in with critical infrastructure firms regularly. The departments of\nEnergy and Treasury, and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, have in\nrecent weeks held a series of briefings for industry executives on Russian hacking\ncapabilities.\nWhile US officials say they are unaware of any credible and specific Russian hacking threats\nto the US homeland, they have told US businesses and state and local governments how\nthat could change.\nRussia would consider conducting a cyberattack on the US homeland if Moscow perceived\nthat a US or NATO response to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine \"threatened\n\n[Russia's] long-term national security,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a\n[January 23 intelligence bulletin first reported by CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/russia-cyberattack-warning-homeland-security/index.html)\nDHS analysts, however, assessed that Moscow's threshold for conducting disruptive or\ndestructive cyberattacks on the US homeland \"probably remains very high.\"\n\n[Call between top US and Russian diplomats doesn't ratchet down Ukraine tensions](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/01/politics/blinken-lavrov-call/index.html)\nThe government is, to some degree, reliant on private companies to report emerging hacking\nthreats because those companies own and operate the majority of US critical infrastructure.\nThe concern among US officials has long been that Russian hackers could gain a foothold\ninto industrial networks that, for example, help distribute electricity or provide other critical\nservices.\n[In 2018, DHS accused Russian government-backed hackers of engaging in a multi-year](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\neffort to infiltrate US energy, water and manufacturing firms. In some case, the hackers took\nscreenshots of sensitive industrial computer systems that help operate machinery.\n\n\n-----\n\nUS critical infrastructure operators have in recent years grown more aware of the threat and\ninvested more in cyber defenses as Russian hacking groups have stayed active around the\nworld.\nRob Joyce, who heads the National Security Agency's Cybersecurity Directorate, said in\nSeptember that US officials had previously \"seen evidence of [Russian] prepositioning\nagainst US critical infrastructure.\"\nThe FBI and other agencies want to know if anything new on that front is happening right\nnow. The questionnaire the bureau sent US businesses last month asked if they were aware\nof any industrial control systems that had been recently compromised by Russian hackers.\nAn FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the request for information.\nThe intelligence sharing has gone both ways.\n\n[Will Vladimir Putin turn the Second Cold War into a hot one?](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/01/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-cold-war-hot-war-analysis-intl/index.html)\nRobert M. Lee, CEO of Maryland-based cybersecurity firm Dragos, told officials at the\nNational Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in\nJanuary that a foreign hacking group had probed the computer networks of US electric\nutilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities, Lee told CNN.\nThe activity, detected in December, involved \"high-level reconnaissance,\" and did not lead to\nany compromises, Lee said.\nThe hacking group -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Xenotime or Temp.Veles -developed tools used in an incident that forced a Saudi petrochemical plant to shut down in\n2017, according to cybersecurity researchers. The Treasury Department in 2020 sanctioned\na Russian government institute for its alleged involvement in that incident.\n\"Right now, the biggest concern we have are preparations for potential impacts to US utilities\nand industrial critical infrastructure,\" Sergio Caltagirone, Dragos' vice president of threat\nintelligence, told CNN.\nAn NSA spokesperson said the agency's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center uses it\nexpertise to \"proactively engage the defense industrial base and its service providers to\ndisrupt ongoing nation-state threats in real-time.\"\n\n## What happens in Ukraine may not stay there\n\nThe US effort to anticipate Russian hacking threats draws on information on the ground in\n[Ukraine, which has had to fend off a string of cyberattacks since mid-January.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/europe/ukraine-cyber-attack-government-intl/index.html)\nOne component of the hacks involved destructive malicious code that wiped data from at\nleast two Ukrainian government agencies. The incident has been contained and not widely\ndisruptive, but it had echoes of the 2017 cyberattack in its use of destructive computer code\nthat was disguised as ransomware.\nUS companies that do business in Ukraine should be wary of spillover from cyberattacks on\nUkrainian networks, government and industry executives have warned.\n\"[D]isruptive and destructive attacks against Ukraine are likely to have broader implications,\nincluding potential impacts to organizations based outside the country,\" US cybersecurity firm\n[CrowdStrike said in an intelligence assessment.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/lessons-from-past-cyber-operations-against-ukraine/)\n\n\n-----\n\nHealth care organizations with a presence in Ukraine -- or that work with suppliers there -are isolating computer networks serving that part of the business to guard against potential\nhacking threats, according to Errol Weiss, chief security officer of the Health Information\nSharing and Analysis Center, a global cyber threat sharing group for health care providers.\n\n\n-----",
