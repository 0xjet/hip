    "plain_text": "# Taurus Loader: User-Guided Infection\n\n**blog.minerva-labs.com/taurus-user-guided-infection**\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\nIn recent months we have seen a spike in events associated with Taurus loader. Although\nTaurus has already been covered extensively by researchers, we think its spreading method\nwas left untouched by the security community. This method allows this malware to generate\nnew samples and infect new devices continuously.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur research saw Taurus being downloaded using promoted cracked software sites. An\nindividual trying to download pirated installations, using Google search engine, will discover\nsites containing this informative GIF:\n\nIt will instruct the unsuspecting user through the installation process of the illicit software of\nhis or her choosing. Alas, following this interactive guide will result in an installation of Taurus\nloader. This social engineering trick increases the infection rate by allowing even nontechnical users to successfully execute this evasive malware. To top it all, the download page\nis protected from bots by captcha, effectively preventing researchers from automatically\nextracting Taurus’ payloads.\n\nAnother less documented aspect of Taurus is its final payload decryption, which is achieved\n[using a specially crafted machine code snippet. As detailed in our previous piece, Taurus](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/taurus-stealers-evolution?hsLang=en-us)\nuses AutoIt to perform various evasion techniques, and if a machine is deemed “safe” a\npayload will be decrypted in memory and executed. Instead of implementing its decryption\nalgorithm in AutoIt, the malware developers have chosen to write an assembly\nimplementation of their chosen stream cipher, RC4.\n\nThe RC4 encryption routine, as seen in Hex-Ray’s decompiler:\n\n\n-----\n\nMinerva prevents Taurus loader with our hostile environment simulation, preventing the\nmalware from using its own code:\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n**Hashes:**\n\nc0cf7e674127446f47f5fe7b86497ecf229e16f73aa2115991d09716006de668\n\n62d7b4a61f5d4b7ca24e76455cb41d2aa797f2ea3927b3bb08b1b48712be4fe2\n\ndd9a3a5efe274380e34fd498215c8e1c4f88a45081a73b023444ddf04295d903\n\nd6a6df7af65dd7b36b5e3fc93e39a9502305d8de61e3d9d85b8a509fb4698002\n\n\n-----\n\neea97d0c1c57a11b629c3b235cbafe52cd41f5c0d8ec6f1f9c7a5b6a7281ece0\n\n03110bdd6c0d0f027422de86d47ce39cfb8cae70c04a616cbb8c325c03853ef6\n\ndafc932c76f461d6ad517dc1a7a125e498bdd954acd0f5f0b217f4e469b10416\n\n2cd5cef50e109e70cba18b914ba9b4de01a7b9f005ec7e08e1ed63e963d67606\n\n141393f1b8984349e7577ca5e12af707f4563f4c9e4fe49d41fc61aff951b1a6\n\n**DNS:**\n\n[https://chcracked[.]com/ (the site redirects to the malicious website)](http://10.10.0.46/about:blank)\n\n[https://profreefiles[.]com](http://10.10.0.46/about:blank)\n\n**References:**\n\nYou can learn more about how Minerva’s technology can prevent even the stealthiest of\n[malware attacks, by contacting us today.](https://minerva-labs.com/contact-us)\n\n\n-----",
