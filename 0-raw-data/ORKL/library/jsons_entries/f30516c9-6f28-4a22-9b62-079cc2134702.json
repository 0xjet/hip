Remediation\ncontinuing.\n\n**UPDATE 2022-04-13: Overnight 2022-04-12/13 we sent out a fourth special report with 537**\nIPs likely infected with Cyclops Blink, corresponding to 281 ASNs in 61 countries. The top\ncountries were still United States (154), Canada (58), Sweden (38), Russia (26), Germany\n(25). A mix of Watchguard and ASUS devices. Remediation continuing, but more patching\nrequired.\n\n**UPDATE 2022-04-08: Overnight 2022-04-07/08 we sent out a third special report with an**\nadditional 553 IPs likely infected with Cyclops Blink, corresponding to 285 ASNs in 61\ncountries. The top countries were United States (157), Canada (58), Sweden (38), Russia\n(27), Germany (26).\n\n**UPDATE 2022-04-06: US** [DoJ announcement about disruption action against Cyclops Blink](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-disruption-botnet-controlled-russian-federation)\ninfected devices.\n\n**[UPDATE 2022-04-01: ASUS released updated firmware for devices impacted by Cyclops](https://www.asus.com/content/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/)**\nBlink.\n\n**[UPDATE 2022-03-25: ASUS released a security advisory about Cyclops Blink impacting](https://www.asus.com/content/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/)**\nASUS devices.\n\n**UPDATE 2022-03-17:** [Trend Micro published research detailing ASUS devices also being](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/cyclops-blink-sets-sights-on-asus-routers--.html)\nimpacted by Cyclops Blink (some ASUS device IPs were included in our second special\nreport, but not explicitly called out at that time, since details were not public).\n\n**UPDATE 2022-03-03: On 2022-03-03 we sent out a second special report with an additional**\n673 IPs likely infected with Cyclops Blink, observed on 2022-02-24. These IPs are different\nto those sent out in the first report. Countries with top infections: USA (188), France (92),\nItaly (65), Canada (55), Germany (39).\n\n## Original Article\n\nOn May 23rd 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation\n[(FBI) and Cisco Talos publicly announced the disruption of a novel multi-stage modular](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)\nmalware platform called VPNFilter. This was designed to infect small office and home office\n\n\n-----\n\n(SOHO) routers and other network devices. At the time, VPNFilter was believed to be\noperated by the threat actor known as APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm,\nSandworm, Sofacy Group, Sednit X-Agent, STRONTIUM and Tsar Team), which was\nallegedly associated with the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU). You can read more\n[about that sinkholing effort in our original 2018 blog post, which includes links to supporting](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/vpnfilter-fbi-sinkholing/)\ntechnical information.\n\nSince then, we have continued notifying VPNFilter victims about infected devices worldwide\nvia [Shadowserver’s free daily network reports.](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/)\n\n[In January 2021, we collaborated with partner Trend Micro on a joint analysis of the](https://twitter.com/Shadowserver/status/1351563113716453376)\nremaining global VPNFilter victim population. This added some further scan-based insights\nabout third stage victim prevalence into our daily datasets.\n\nFrom our vantage point as sinkhole operators, the peak day for VPNFilter infections globally\nwas 2018-07-24, which saw 14,966 unique IP addresses being observed hitting the sinkhole.\nAfter the initial fairly rapid (by global Internet response standards) remediation of infected\ndevices, a typical long tail of not yet remediated victims still remains today:\n\n_Figure 1 – Unique sinkholed VPNFIlter IP address per day_\n\nNote the lack of variation in the daily/weekly number of detected IP addresses. As expected,\nthis suggests that the infected devices are always-on routers (which is unlike the typical\novernight or weekend patterns of change we usually see in sinkholed home or office PCs).\n\nThe IP-geolocated distribution of sinkholed VPNFilter unique IP addresses on that peak day\nwas:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Unique sinkholed VPNFIlter geolocated IP addresses (2018-07-24)_\n\nWith Ukraine having by far and away the most infected victim devices.\n\nThis compares to the current sinkholed VPNFilter IP address distribution observed\nyesterday:\n\n_Figure 3 – Unique sinkholed VPNFIlter geolocated IP addresses (2022-02-22)_\n\n## Cyclops Blink replaces VPNFilter\n\n[On February 23rd 2022, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/joint-advisory-shows-new-sandworm-malware-cyclops-blink-replaces-vpnfilter) Cybersecurity\nand Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the [National Security Agency (NSA) and the](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/23/2002943421/-1/-1/0/CSA_NEW_SANDWORM_MALWARE_CYCLOPS_BLINK_REPLACES_VPNFILTER_20220223.PDF)\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) jointly announced that they had identified that the\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear has deployed a new, large-scale modular\nmalware framework which is affecting network devices. They have named the malware\n**Cyclops Blink. The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA have previously attributed the Sandworm**\nthreat actor to the Russian GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.\n\nThe Cyclops Blink malware is believed to be a more advanced replacement for VPNFilter. It\nis installed on exploited network devices as part of a legitimate firmware upgrade, allowing\npersistence between reboots. The UK NCSC’s analysis explains that it is possible to\nrecalculate the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) value for the modified\nfirmware image because the WatchGuard FireBox devices use a hard-coded key to initialize\nthe hash calculation. This allows their malware to pass checks and appear to be legitimate,\nvendor-supplied firmware updates.\n\nInfected victims’ devices are grouped into clusters, each with a list of Command and Control\n(C2) servers. They communicate with their operators using Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n[running over The Onion Router (Tor) network. To date, Cyclops Blink malware is believed to](https://www.torproject.org/)\n[have been primarily deployed onto WatchGuard firewall devices (which are Linux ELF 32-bit](https://www.watchguard.com/)\nPowerPC big-endian platforms), and all C2 servers identified to date have been for\nWatchGuard firewalls. However, the assessment published today indicates that it is likely that\nthe Cyclops Blink malware could also be compiled and deployed onto other architectures\nand firmware. This botnet appears to have been active since at least June 2019.\n\n[A detailed technical analysis of Cyclops Blink by the UK NCSC can be found here, which](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf)\nincludes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and YARA signatures to assist in detection.\n\n## Cyclops Blink Malware Remediation\n\nWatchGuard have provided remediation information for system owners infected with the\nCyclops Blink malware:\n\n[https://detection.watchguard.com](https://detection.watchguard.com/)\n\nWatchGuard [estimate that Cyclops Blink malware may have infected approximately 1% of](https://www.watchguard.com/uk/wgrd-news/blog/important-detection-and-remediation-actions-cyclops-blink-state-sponsored-botnet-0)\nWatchGuard firewall devices. They advise that the default configuration is to prevent access\nto their management interface from the Internet, so this configuration must be manually\nenabled by the system administrator.\n\nAll WatchGuard device owners should follow each step in these instructions to ensure that\ndevices are patched to the latest version and that any infection is removed.\n\nIf your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, you should assume that any\npasswords present on the device have been compromised and replace them\nimmediately.\nYou should ensure that the management interfaces of your network devices are not\nexposed to the Internet\n\n\n-----\n\n**[UPDATES 2022-03-25 and 2022-04-01: Asus have also provided remediation information](https://www.asus.com/content/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/)**\n[and updated firmaware for impacted customers.](https://www.asus.com/content/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/)\n\n## Shadowserver Cyclops Blink Special Report\n\nWe send out Special Reports whenever we are able to share one-time, high value datasets\nthat we feel should be reported responsibly for maximum public benefit. Although the events\nincluded in these Special Reports sometimes fall outside of our usual 24-hour daily reporting\nwindow, we believe that there would still be significant benefit to our constituents in receiving\nand hopefully acting on the data.\n\nOn February 23rd 2022, we sent out a new Special Report covering network devices that are\nbelieved to be likely infected with the Cyclops Blink malware. This one off Cyclops Blink\nSpecial Report contained:\n\n**1,573 unique victim IP addresses in 495 different Autonomous System Numbers**\n(ASNs) across 70 different countries\n**25 Command and Control (C2) server IP addresses in 19 different Autonomous System**\nNumbers (ASNs) in 7 different countries\n\n[A direct link to the Cyclops Blink Special Report format is here.](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/cyclops-blink-special-report/)\n\n## Cyclops Blink Data Visualisation\n\nThe data contained in this new Cyclops Blink Special Report was provided to Shadowserver\nto disseminate rapidly to National CERTs/CSIRTs and network owners globally, to maximise\nremediation efforts.\n\nOf the 1,573 IPv4 addresses included in the Cyclops Blink Special Report, the majority of\nlikely infected network devices IP-geolocate as being located in the United States, Canada\nand Central Europe:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Map of likely Cyclops Blink infected devices (2022-02-23)_\n\nLooking at the data in another way, more than half of the network devices believed to be\ninfected with Cyclops Blink malware are located in the United States, France, Italy, Canada\nand Germany:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – Tree Map of likely Cyclops Blink infected devices (2022-02-23)_\n\nShadowserver conducts daily Internet-wide scanning of all IPv4 /0, which includes\nidentification of Internet facing devices, where possible, thanks to the EU HaDEA VARIoT\nproject. We began making this information available to National CERT/CSIRTs and Network\nOwners who [subscribe to our](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/get-reports/) [free daily network reports in the form of our](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/) Daily Device\nIdentification Report in September 2021, which can be used to establish your exposed attack\n[surface. We highly recommend subscribing and reviewing this report for your network, since](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/get-reports/)\nthis is the same profile an attacker scanning to perform reconnaissance from the outside will\nalso see.\n\nThe location of the likely Cyclops Blink infected devices generally matches our scan-based\nunderstanding of the global distribution WatchGuard firewall devices which are currently\nexposed to the Internet:\n\n_Figure 6 – Identified WatchGuard firewall devices detected – World (2022-02-22 IPv4 /0_\n_scan)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – Identified WatchGuard firewall devices detected – US States (2022-02-22 IPv4 /0_\n_scan)_\n\n_Figure 8 – Identified WatchGuard firewall devices detected – US Counties (2022-02-22 IPv4_\n_/0 scan)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – Identified WatchGuard firewall devices detected – World (2022-02-22 IPv4 /0_\n_scan)_\n\n_Figure 10 – Identified WatchGuard firewall device models – World (2022-02-22 IPv4 /0 scan)_\n\nShadowserver’s daily scanning will obviously not detect all WatchGuard devices. However,\ncomparing the 1,573 unique IP addresses reported out as potentially infected with Cyclops\nBlink malware to the number of publicly exposed systems identified through scanning, does\nrepresent similar orders of magnitude to the 1% infection ratio suggested by WatchGuard.\n\n## Cyclops Blink C2 Server Distribution\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the 1,573 IPv4 addresses corresponding to likely infected victim network\ndevices included in our Cyclops Blink Special Report, 25 Cyclops Blink C2 servers have also\nbeen identified:\n\n_Figure 11 – Cyclops Blink C2 Server Location Map (2022-02-23)_\n\n_Figure 12 – Cyclops Blink C2 Server Location Countries (2022-02-23)_\n\n## Not Yet Subscribed to Shadowserver’s Free Daily Reports?\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you missed this [Special Report because you were not yet a subscriber to our free daily](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/cyclops-blink-special-report/)\nnetwork reports, do not worry: simply [subscribe for your network or country now and](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/get-reports/)\nspecifically request all recent Shadowserver Special Reports. We will resend the Special\nReport specifically for your network or country (for National CERT/CSIRTs).\n\nIf you have a data set which you feel could also be of benefit to National CERT/CSIRTs and\n[network owners world-wide to help protect victims of cybercrime, please get in touch and](https://www.shadowserver.org/contact/)\ndiscuss the options for using Shadowserver’s proven reporting systems for distribution and\nremediation.\n\n[« Back to News & Insights](https://www.shadowserver.org/news-insights/)\n\n\n-----",
