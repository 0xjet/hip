In contrast to other threat landscape\nreports, this analysis primarily looks at relevant\nincidents that have – or had the potential - to spill into\nthe political realm. Meaning, it does not touch upon\ntraditional cybercrime, background noise activities, or\nminor cyber-related incidents.\n\nSection two provides political background\ninformation on four issues deemed constants in JapanPRC relations, and explains the historical evolution of\ncybersecurity and –defense policies in both countries.\nSection three presents a chronological overview of\nrelevant cyber incidents, including infection vectors\nand attribution assessments. Section four and five\nidentify the various teams connected to these\nincidents, and extends insights into their history and –\nif available - current state of play. Section six then\noutlines social, economic, technical, and international\neffects resulting from the overall cyber threat\nlandscape. And section seven concludes the analysis\nwith a look into the future.\n\n\n#### 2 Background\n\nSince the birth of the People’s Republic of China\non October 1, 1949, diplomatic relations between\nTokyo and Beijing have gone through multiple cycles of\nrapprochement and political tension. Despite, or\nbecause of, these ups and downs, four unbridgeable\nissues have become political constants over time and\nspace that occasionally spill over into the cyber\ndomain.\n\n(1) Historic animosity: Between 1930 and 1945,\nImperial Japan waged an aggressive colonization\ncampaign against large parts of mainland China, which\nsaw mass atrocities, such as the Nanjing massacre, and\nhuman experimentation for biological warfare\npurposes (ex. Unit 731). These war-wounds have never\nhealed despite numerous friendship treaties between\nboth countries, rapidly expanding trade relations,\noffers of reparation payments, and longstanding\nJapanese official development assistance to China.\n\nThe specific reasons are multiple, but to a large\ndegree, historical animosity is still leveraged by Beijing\nto rally support around nationalistic sentiments and to\ndeflect any form of criticism voiced by Tokyo. This\nincludes issues such as China’s rapidly increasing\nmilitary spending and Beijing’s enduring human rights\nviolations - stretching back from the Tiananmen\nmassacre in 1989 to today’s ‘re-education’ of millions\nof Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province. In most\ninstances it is even the other way around, with China\nconsistently calling out Japan on its annual defense\nbudget - despite Beijing currently spending four times\nmore – and accusing Tokyo of re-militarization efforts\nby arguing that Japan is “deny[ing] its history of\naggression, challeng[ing] the post-war order, and\nharm[ing] the feelings of the people of those victimized\nnations” (Deutsche Welle, 2013; Johnson, 2019).\n\nIn the cyber domain, historic animosity most\nnotably manifests itself in the form of Chinese\nhacktivists DDoS’ing and defacing Japanese\ngovernment websites, particularly around the 18[th] of\nSeptember, which marks the beginning of the Japanese\ninvasion of Manchuria in 1931.\n\n(2) **The rise of China: Between 1946 and 1992,**\nJapan experienced an era of rapid economic growth,\npropelling it to become the world’s second largest\neconomy behind the United States. China in turn,\nopened itself up to foreign trade and investment in\n1979, and overtook Japan in 2010/11 when measured\nin nominal GDP (McCurry & Kollewe, 2011). While\nestimates vary, some analysts suggest that the Republic\nwill become the world’s largest economy sometime\nbetween 2028 and 2050.\n\nThe rise of China has serious security\nimplications for Japan, ranging from Beijing’s increased\n\n\n-----\n\nmilitary spending and modernization efforts, Chinese\nhegemonic assertions abroad, and a creeping\nrestructuring of both the global economy and the\ninternational political system at large. It should thus\ncome as no surprise that Tokyo views Beijing’s Belt and\nRoad initiative (BRI) as a vehicle for expanding China’s\neconomic stranglehold across the globe.\n\nTo counter Chinese ambitions, the Japanese\ngovernment developed, and has recently begun to\npromote, its own concept of a ‘Free and Open IndoPacific’ (FOIP) as part of its official foreign policy\n(Miyake, 2019). So far however, FOIP has gained little\ntraction internationally as it only exists on two jumbled\npower point presentations and a short YouTube video\nput together by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs (MOFA, 2019b).\n\nIn its 2019 White Paper, the Japanese Ministry\nof Defense placed - for the first time since 2007 - the\nsection on China’s defense policies second behind the\nUnited States. In all the 12 years prior, the defense\npolicies on the Korean Peninsula occupied the second\nspot. Many analysts have interpreted this subtle\nchange as a strategic shift in the MoD’s threat\nprioritization vis-à-vis the People’s Republic (Kelly,\n2019). The White Paper also specifically identified the\nBelt and Road Initiative as a possible cover for the\nPeople’s Liberation Army (PLA) to advance its activities\nabroad (MoD, 2019a, p. 20).\n\nIn regard to the cyber domain, the rise of China\nproceeds in lockstep with Chinese espionage\ncampaigns against a variety of Japanese industrial\nsectors and government agencies.\n\n(3) **Territorial dispute: Consisting of five islets**\nand three rocks in the East China Sea, the uninhabited\nDiaoyu/Senkaku Islands are currently administered by\nthe Japanese government and claimed by both China\nand Taiwan. [1] The territorial dispute flares up\noccasionally when Chinese submarines, frigates, and\nfishing trawlers enter the contiguous zone around the\nislands, or Chinese jet fighters violate Japanese\nairspace above. On September 7, 2010, a Chinese\nfishing trawler eventually collided with a Japanese\ncoast guard vessel in the disputed waters. After\ndetaining the Chinese skipper, relations between\nBeijing and Tokyo took a nosedive for the worse,\nincluding large-scale protests in both countries, the\ncancellation of bilateral meetings on the ministerial\nlevel and above, and even the arrest of four Japanese\ncitizens in China on the suspicion of illegally filming in a\nmilitary area. On September 24, the Chinese skipper\nwas returned, due to Japanese concerns over further\ndamaging bilateral relations, and on October 9, all four\n\n1 Note: Because Taiwan views itself as the only legitimate Chinese\ngovernment, every historical territorial claim that Beijing puts\nforward, Taiwan emulates in its own way. This is true for the\nDiaoyu/Senkaku islands and the 9-dash line in the South China Sea.\n\n\nJapanese citizens previously arrested were released\nfrom Chinese custody.\n\nThe Diaoyu/Senkaku island dispute in part\noverlaps with the unresolved historic animosity\nbetween both countries. Meaning, any major clash or\nevent touching the islands also mobilizes Chinese\nnationalistic hacktivists into action.\n\n(4) **Military alliance: In the aftermath of World**\nWar II, Japan committed itself to a pacifist constitution,\nwhich under Article 9 proclaims that, “the Japanese\npeople forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the\nnation and the threat or use of force as means of\nsettling international disputes” (Japanese Constitution,\n1946). The article continues to note that “in order to\naccomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land,\nsea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will\nnever be maintained. The right of belligerency of the\nstate will not be recognized” (Japanese Constitution,\n1946).\n\nOn September 8, 1951, Tokyo and Washington\nsigned the ‘Security Treaty between the United States\nand Japan,’ which forms the bedrock of regional\nstability and US military power projection across the\nIndo-Pacific. Consecutive Japanese cabinets\nsubsequently re-interpreted Article 9 to mean that the\nright of self-defense would still be permissible. As a\nresult, Japan has build-up a self-defense naval, air, and\nground force whose military budget is unofficially\ncapped at 1% of GDP – a ceiling established by then\nPrime Minister Takeo Miki in 1976 (Wright, 2016, p. 3).\nAccording to the IISS’ Military Balance 2019, Japan’s\nannual defense budget is the eight highest in the world,\ncurrently standing at $47.3 billion USD (The Military\nBalance, 2019, p. 21).\n\nAs part of the US-Japan alliance agreement,\nJapan is also host to 23 US military bases and\napproximately 50,000 US soldiers. Among them, the 7[th]\ncarrier fleet stationed at Yokosuka naval base, and the\n18[th] Air Wing at Kadena AFB – the self- proclaimed\n“hub of airpower in the Pacific” (kadena.af.mil).\n\nIn terms of military activity, a look at the 2018\nstatistics published by the Japanese Ministry of Defense\nreveals that Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force was\n“scrambled 638 times against Chinese aircraft, an\nincrease of 138 times compared to the previous fiscal\nyear” (MoD, 2019b, p. 1). In its 2018 Defense white\npaper, the Japanese MoD therefore noted that,\n“China’s sea and air power is expanding its operational\nareas surrounding Japan, including the area around\n\n[the] Senkaku Islands” (MoD, 2018a, p. 3).\n\nFrom a Chinese point of view, the US-Japan\nalliance is largely seen as a fulcrum to protect the\ngeopolitical status quo and contain Beijing in East Asia\nand beyond. Chinese analysts however do diverge on\nascertaining whether the US government is actively\ntrying to push Tokyo to revise its pacifist constitution\n\n\n-----\n\nover time, or whether Washington’s influence is\nactually helping to push back against Japan’s full-blown\nre-militarization desires (Glaser, 2015).\n\nIn cyberspace, Tokyo and Washington are both\npushing for deeper cooperation and coordination. At\nthe 2019 Japan-US Security Consultative Meeting, the\nallies affirmed that “international law applies in\ncyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain\ncircumstances, constitute an armed attack for the\npurposes of Article V of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty”\n(MOFA, 2019a, p. 1). To date, no cyberattack against\nJapan has breached this threshold.\n\n##### 2.1 Japanese cybersecurity & defense policy\n\nOn November 30, 1985, the roughly 300member strong Japan Revolutionary Communist\nLeague – also called Chukaku-ha or Middle Core Faction\n( 中核派 ) – simultaneously targeted 35 key rail\ncommunication and signal systems in and around\nTokyo and Osaka. They slashed vital cables in gutters\nalong tracks and set fires inside signal boxes at key\nsections of Japan National Railways (Haberman, 1985).\nThe group subsequently succeeded to knock out\nnumerous switching systems, telephone hookups,\ncomputerized booking operations, and effectively shut\ndown “23 commuter lines during the morning rush\nhour” for approximately 6.5 to 12 million commuters\n(Haberman, 1985; Moosa, 1985). According to\nLittleton, the group “jammed police and rescue radio\nfrequencies in an attempt to hamper and delay\nresponse by the authorities” (Littleton, 1995). The LA\nTimes also reported that, “commuters who switched to\nautomobiles in an attempt to get to work created\ntraffic jams of as long as 28 miles on expressways\nleading into Tokyo,” and that “more than 50 schools in\nthe Tokyo area closed for the day” (Jameson, 1985).\n\nAlthough no one was injured and the severed\ncables were repaired within 24 hours, the incident\nmarked the first and to-date only occurrence in Japan\nof what at the time was coined “techno terrorism.” A\nde-facto pinpoint strategy that was not aimed at\nblowing up infrastructure, but severing critical control\ncircuits to disconnect command and control systems\nand “causing disruption in cyberspace” (Littleton,\n1995). [2]\n\nIt took another 15 years for the Japanese\ngovernment to be eventually ‘shocked’ by two events\nto take cybersecurity and cyber defense increasingly\nseriously.\n\n2 Note: According to the LA Times, “by noon, 48 people, including the\nthree top leaders of the Chukaku-ha […] had been arrested”\n(Jameson, 1985)\n\n\nIn reaction to Tokyo’s decision to allow the goahead for a controversial conference in Osaka on\nJanuary 23, 2000, titled ‘The Verification of the Rape of\nNanking: The Biggest Lie of the 20th Century,’ Chinese\nnationalistic hacktivists mobilized on January 29 and\nbombarded Japanese government e-mail inboxes,\nredirected website queries to porn sites, and defaced\nseveral sites with anti-Japanese messages. Messages\nranged from “Nippon [Japan] is rotten animal,” to\n“Japanese - As all peoples know, it's a folk which has no\nconcern to face the truth of history. They are the\ndisgrace of Asia\" (Watts, 2000). According to The\nGuardian and ScanNetSecurity, the hacktivists also\nwiped census data from the website of the\ngovernment’s statistical bureau, and tried to gain\naccess to the Bank of Japan, the Foreign Ministry, the\nMinistry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture,\nForestry, and Fisheries, the Labor Agency, the Defense\nAgency, and Japan's Management and Coordination\nAgency (BBC, 2000; ScanNetSecurity, 2000). The\nhacktivists signed off as the “Brazil p00 Hackerz” and\n“Billy in Hunan Province” (Watts, 2000;\nScanNetSecurity, 2000)\n\nOn March 2, 2000, Japanese police investigators\nannounced that computer companies affiliated with\nthe Aum Shinrikyo doomsday sect, “developed\nsoftware programs for at least 10 government\nagencies, including the Defense [Agency],” and “more\nthan 80 major Japanese companies” (Sims, 2000).\nAccording to George Wehrfritz at Newsweek, the\ninvestigators also determined that “the first contracts\nwere awarded in 1996--one year after the cult\nmounted a nerve-gas attack on Tokyo's subway system\nthat killed 12, injured 5,000 and stunned the nation”\n(Wehrfritz, 2000). Calvin Sims over at the New York\nTimes aptly explains the significance of this revelation\nby noting that “underscoring the immense fear that the\nsect provokes in Japan, the Defense [Agency] and the\nNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the\ncountry’s main provider of telephone and internet\nservice, immediately suspended the use of all computer\nsoftware developed by companies linked to Aum”\n(Sims, 2000).\n\nCombined with the Chinese hacktivist campaign\none month prior, and the techno terrorism incident of\n1985, the Japanese government decided to prioritize\ncombatting the threat of “cyber terror” (サイバーテロ) front\nand center.\n\nThe Metropolitan police agency for example\n“set up a special squad of 50 police officers to\ninvestigate internet crime,” and the government said it\n“will dispatch officials to the US to seek advice on\nmeasures to prevent cyber terrorism” (Watts 2000). On\nOctober 23, 2001, The Japanese Metropolitan Police\nalso established the Council for Countermeasures\n\n\n-----\n\nagainst Cyber Terrorism (サイバーテロ対策協議会) - which to\nthis day encompasses an important role in Japanese\nlaw enforcement cooperation and coordination with\nkey infrastructure providers. [3] The incidents also\nspurred the adoption of the special action plan to\nprotect Japan’s critical infrastructure from cyber terror,\nwhich includes measures such as reviewing critical\ninfrastructure protection and establishing and\nstrengthening public-private partnerships (ISMPO,\n2000).\n\nIn reaction to the Chinese hacktivist onslaught,\nthe Japanese Self-Defense Forces also decided to setup military Computer Emergency Response Teams\n(CERTs) within the three service wings. The Air Force’s\nComputer Security Evaluation Squadron (航空自衛隊システ\n\nム監査隊) was create on May 8, 2000; the Ground\nForce’s System Protection Technology Unity (陸上自衛隊\n\nシステム防護隊 ) in 2001; And the Maritime Force’s\nCommunication Security Group (海上自衛隊保全監査隊)\nwas founded in March 2002 (NISC 2004, p. 40). [4]\n\nOver the years, the cyber terrorism narrative\nslowly crumbled as there was no clear definition on\nwhat the term cyber terrorism actually included and\nexcluded. The Japanese police for example defined\ncyber terror as broadly as “an electronic attack on a\ncritical system of critical infrastructure or a serious\nfailure in a critical system of critical infrastructure”\n(MPD, n.d.). Already by 2004, Japan’s Information\nTechnology Promotion Agency concluded that\n“according to a strict definition of the term terrorism,\nthere are no known cases of cyber terrorism to date”\n(IPA, 2004, p. 38).\n\nIn February 2006, the Information Security\nPolicy Council (ISPC) released Japan’s ‘First National\nStrategy on Information Security.’ The document\nparticularly focused on raising cybersecurity awareness\nand creating a ‘Japan Model’ IT ecosystem - which was\nto be “regarded as a synonym for high quality, high\nreliability safety and security, or just simply to create ‘a\nnation which should be revitalized by the value of\ntrustworthiness’” (ISPC, 2006, p. 5). Overall, the\ndocument treated cybersecurity as a purely technical\nissue devoid of political and national security\nimplications. Notably absent from the strategy were\nany mentions of advanced persistent threats (APT),\n\n3 The Council has been holding an annual conference since 2001\nwhich brings together government officials and critical infrastructure\noperators, and serves as a coordinating venue to prepare for major\nevents being held in Japan (ex. the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and\nParalympic Games). On Dec. 6, 2018, 65 operators from 14 sectors –\nranging from information and communications, finance, aviation,\nrailway, power, gas, medical, water, logistics, chemical, credit, oil –\nparticipated in the conference (MPD, n.d.).\n\n4 For more information see CSS’ upcoming “National Policy Snapshot:\n\nJapan.”\n\n\nstate sponsored non-state actors, or even nationalistic\nhacktivists. Terrorism was mentioned only twice within\nthe 33-page long document. And both times it was\nqualified as “crimes and terrorism” – following the\ntrend that cyber terrorism was increasingly seen as a\nsub-threat of foreign government supported\ncybercrime.\n\nIn 2009, the ISPC published the ‘Second National\nStrategy on Information Security.’ The new document\nrecognized for the first time the importance of\ninternational partnerships and the discussion of\ncountermeasures in the context of national security\nand protecting critical information infrastructure (ISPC,\n2009, p. 22). While cybercrime was prominently\nfeatured in the report, the threat of ‘cyber terror’\nentirely disappeared.\n\nIn reaction to the July 2009 barrage of denial-ofservice attacks against US and South Korean\ngovernment, media, and financial websites, the ISPC\npushed out the ‘Information Security Strategy for\nProtecting the Nation’ in May 2010 (Weaver, 2009;\nISPC, 2010,). As Gady correctly highlights, “the\ndocument appears to lay out a distinct Japanese\nmindset of the time - seeing cyberattacks as analogous\nto unpredictable natural disasters rather than concrete\nactions of state and non-state adversaries” (Gady,\n2017, p. 12-13).\n\nIn mid- to late-2011, multiple Japanese\ngovernment servers eventually fell victim to targeted\nintrusions - including the Japanese House of\nRepresentatives, the House of Councilors, the Japanese\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal\nAffairs and Communications, multiple Japanese\nembassies across the globe, as well as Japan’s largest\ndefense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The\nISPC’s ‘Information Security 2012’ report soberly\nassessed that “in 2011, threats of targeted attacks,\ncases of which were reported to have previously\noccurred overseas, emerged in Japanese government\nagencies. […] The risk of such possible sophisticated\ncyber attacks aimed at stealing important government\ninformation is expected to further escalate, and thus\nthere is a strong demand for measures to improve and\ncombat such a situation” (ISPC, 2012, p. 2-3).\n\nIn June 2013, the ISPC released Japan’s first\n‘Cybersecurity Strategy.’ The document emphasized\nthat in the near future “there is potential for cyber\nattacks targeting vulnerabilities in the software of […]\nsystems to directly result in obstruction of\ncommunications, transportation disorder, blackouts\nand other large social turmoil and possibly even\ndeaths” (ISPC, 2013, p. 9). For the first time ever, the\nISPC also highlighted the role of the Japanese Ministry\nof Defense in this new warfare domain. Given Japan’s\nconstitutional constraints on offensive operations, the\ndocument exclusively focused on the creation of a\ndedicated Cyber Defense unit within the Japanese SelfDefense Force, to support readiness and preparedness,\n\n\n-----\n\nimproving surveillance capabilities, holding realistic\nexercises, training talented personnel, and carrying out\nadvanced research and development. The strategy\nfurthermore stressed the importance of the application\nof international law to cyberspace, cooperation with\nthe United States in the context of the military alliance,\nas well as specifically providing technical and policy\nsupport to the 12 member states within the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (ISPC, 2013, p. 4951). Overall, Japan’s first cyber strategy emphasized the\ncreation of a resilient cyber nation, including close\npublic-private partnerships and a multi-stakeholder\napproach to internet governance.[5]\n\nIn 2015, Washington and Tokyo eventually\npublished the new ‘Guidelines for Japan-US Defense\nCooperation.’[6] Section 6 in the document outlines that\nthe alliance partners will: “maintain a posture to\nmonitor their respective networks and systems; share\nexpertise and conduct educational exchanges; ensure\nresiliency of their respective networks and systems to\nachieve mission assurance; contribute to whole-ofgovernment efforts to improve cybersecurity; and\nconduct bilateral exercises to ensure effective\ncooperation for cybersecurity in all situations from\npeacetime to contingencies” (MoD, 2015). In the event\nof a serious cyber incident that affects the security of\nJapan, the guidelines note that the “two governments\nwill consult closely and take appropriate cooperative\nactions to respond” (MoD, 2015).\n\nIn July 2018, the Japanese government\npublished its third and latest Cybersecurity Strategy.\nUnder point 4.3.2. the strategy emphasizes that “in\norder to protect Japan’s national security interest from\ncyberattacks, it is important to secure Japan’s resilience\nagainst cyberattacks and increase Japan’s ability to\ndefend the state (defense capabilities), deter\ncyberattacks (deterrence capabilities), and be aware of\nthe situation in cyberspace (situational awareness\ncapabilities)” (Japanese Government, 2018, p. 37).\n\n5 Note: On February 10, 2015, the IPSC was absorbed into the Cyber\nSecurity Strategic Headquarters. See: NISC, 2015\n\n6 Note: The last time the Guidelines for Japan-US Defense\nCooperation were overhauled was in 1997.\n\n\n##### 2.2 Chinese cybersecurity & defense policy\n\nParallel to Beijing opening itself up to the\ninternet in the mid-1990s, Chinese military planners\nand domestic security services recognized the dangers\nof so-called ‘informatization’ – a ominous term that\ndescribes the comprehensive integration of\ninformation technology to impact all aspects of society\nand mechanisms of statehood – including domestic\nsecurity and modern warfare (Griffiths, 2019, p. 35-43).\nWhile China did indeed implement sweeping internet\nregulations and filtering mechanisms prior to allowing\ncommercial access to the internet in 1995 - whose\nelements Wired dubbed the ‘Great Firewall of China’ the stranglehold was still lose enough for citizens to\norganize themselves online (Barme & Ye, 1997).\n\nIn 1999, Beijing’s fears of ‘informatization’\neventually materialized when the spiritual Falun Gong\nmovement – which encompassed an estimated 70\nmillion practitioners in China at the time – organized\nlarge-scale protests in 30 cities, including 10,000\nprotesters amassing around Zhongnanhai - the\nheadquarter of the Communist Party in Beijing - to\ndemand legal recognition of the movement and\nfreedom from state interference. According to Lewis,\n“the Internet was one of the primary tools used to\norganize the demonstrations” (Lewis, 2006, p. 1). What\nfollowed was a massive crackdown with hundreds of\nthousands Falun Gong practitioners arrested, and\nhundreds extrajudicially executed. Alongside this\npurge, the Chinese government also launched a\npropaganda campaign “the like of which had not been\nseen since the heights of the Cultural Revolution,”\nincluding even DDoS attacks against websites overseas\nassociated with the movement (Griffiths, p. 54;\nDenning, 2017).\n\nIn contrast to the initial hopes that the internet\nwould foster democracy, solidarity, and allow for the\nfree flow of information and ideas to and within China,\nBeijing has subsequently regulated, censored, filtered,\nand molded the Chinese internet to exercise political\ncontrol over and through it. US President Clinton’s\nmocking words when he declared in March 2000 that\n“China has been trying to crack down on the Internet.\nGood luck! That's sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the\nwall,” did not age well (NYT, 2000).\n\nIn November 2012, Xi Jinping was appointed\nGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party and\nChairman of the Central Military Commission. As one of\nhis first acts in office he announced the creation of the\nso-called Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and\nInformatization (中央网络安全和信息化领导小组). Over the\nyears this high-level group chaired by Xi has become\ncentral to pulling together China’s fragmented cyberpolicy landscape and direct change from the top.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall Chairman Xi is currently aggressively pushing\nfour interlocked concepts to reposition China in the\nworld.\n\n(1) A harmonious internet - Given China’s broad\nconcept of national security, which spans both\ndomestic stability and countering threats from abroad,\na harmonious internet seeks to guide public opinion,\nsupport good governance, and foster economic growth.\nTo achieve these objectives, Beijing has been exercising\never-tighter control over the content posted online to\nstymie political mobilization and prevent any flow of\ninformation that might undermine the regime. In 2014,\nXi established the Cyberspace Administration of China\n(CAC)(国家互联网信息办公室), which is subordinate to the\nCentral Leading Group and tasked with “controlling\nonline content, bolstering cybersecurity, and\ndeveloping the digital economy” (Segal, 2018). While\nthe CAC has been vital for the development of China’s\ninitial cyberspace governance framework, it also ran\ninto numerous power struggles with other ministries\nunwilling to step aside – most notably the Ministry of\nPublic Security, the Ministry of Propaganda, and the\nMinistry of Industry and Information Technology. In\n2018, the Leading Group was upgraded to the Central\nCyberspace Affairs Commission (中央网络安全和信息化委\n\n员会), allowing the CAC to “depend less on staff and\nresources loaned from relevant ministries and to exert\ngreater authority over functional power centers across\ngovernment.” As a result, Creemers et al. expect the\nCAC to exercise “a stronger role in protecting China’s\ncritical information infrastructure and directing its\ntechnical censorship apparatus via the Great Firewall”\n(Creemers et al., 2018).\n\n(2) **Cyber sovereignty - To support and defend**\nthe harmonious internet from its critics abroad and at\nhome, Beijing has endorsed the concept of state\nsovereignty in cyberspace. According to Xi, cyber\nsovereignty is “the right of individual countries to\nindependently choose their own path on cyber\nregulation and internet public policies, and participate\nin international cyberspace governance on an equal\nfooting” (FMPRC, 2015). As Adam Segal succinctly\nnotes, “China envisions a world of national internets,\nwith government control justified by the sovereign\nrights of states” (Segal, 2018).\n\nWhile there are numerous Chinese laws and\nregulations that have increasingly expanded the legal\nbasis for Chinese sovereignty in cyberspace, two laws\nare at its helm. In 2016, Beijing enacted the Cyber\nSecurity Law of the People's Republic of China (中华人民\n\n共和国网络安全法), which to date is “the most visible\ndocument in a wider Chinese effort to govern\ncyberspace and secure the country’s digital\ninfrastructure” (Triolo et al. 2017). According to\nWagner, “the law requires network operators to\n\n\ncooperate with Chinese crime or security investigators\nand allow full access to data and unspecified ‘technical\nsupport’ to the authorities upon request. The law also\nimposes mandatory testing and certification of\ncomputer equipment for critical sector network\noperators” (Wagner, 2017). In terms of data\nlocalization, the law mandates that network operators\nin critical sectors store all data gathered or produced in\nmainland China. The law also bans “the export of any\neconomic, technological, or scientific data that would\npose a threat to national security or the public interest”\n(Wagner, 2017). The Cyber Security Law came into\neffect on June 1, 2017. Eight months later, Apple\nofficially moved all of its Chinese iCloud operations to a\nlocal firm in southern China, and for the first time ever\n“began hosting its iCloud encryption keys in China,\ninstead of the US” (Liao, 2018).\n\nEnacted on July, 27, 2017, China’s new National\nIntelligence Law (中华人民共和国国家情报法) “repeatedly\nobliges individuals, organizations, and institutions to\nassist Public Security and State Security officials in\ncarrying out a wide array of ‘intelligence’ work”\n(Tanner, 2017). Article 2 starts by explaining that the\nlaw adheres to the “overall national security\nperspective,” a term coined by Xi Jinping in 2014 which\nvirtually puts every issue – whether military, political,\neconomic, social, technological, cultural or otherwise –\nwithin the realm of intelligence collection. Article 7\nthen goes on to explain that “any organization or\ncitizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state\nintelligence work according to law.” According to\nTanner this is a calculated measure “to drive wedges of\nmistrust between U.S. or foreign citizens or firms, and\ntheir Chinese partners” (Tanner, 2017). It is also an\nexpression that Beijing considers itself strong and\neconomically important enough to “call for intelligence\ncooperation even from foreigners doing business in\nChina” (Tanner, 2017).\n\n(3) Techno-Nationalism and military-civil fusion\nIn November 2012, Xi Jinping also set forward the\npolitical guideline of military-civilian fusion, which\nenvisions a two-way technology transfer and a resulting\ninterdependence between the military and the civilindustrial sector. Meaning, on the one hand, it\nencourages civilian participation in the development of\nmilitary technology. On the other, it stipulates the\napplication of military technology in the civilian realm.\nMilitary-civilian fusion walks in lockstep with the idea\nof techno-nationalism e.g. the notion of technological\ninterdependence, a strong high-tech army, and\ndominance in the areas of AI, quantum computing,\nrobotics, and the setting of international standards. To\nachieve this development trajectory as fast as possible,\nthe 2019 Annual Report of the US Department of\nDefense to Congress notes that, “China uses a variety\n\n\n-----\n\nof methods to acquire foreign military and dual-use\ntechnologies, including targeted foreign direct\ninvestment, cyber theft, and exploitation of private\nChinese nationals’ access to these technologies, as well\nas harnessing its intelligence services, computer\nintrusions, and other illicit approaches. In 2018,\nChinese efforts to acquire sensitive, dual-use, or\nmilitary-grade equipment from the United States\nincluded dynamic random-access memory, aviation\ntechnologies, and antisubmarine warfare technologies”\n(OSD, 2019, p. iii).\n\nFalling into the same strategy of military-civilian\nfusion is also the rapid expansion of Chinese tech giants\nabroad and their ever-growing cooperation with the\nChinese government domestically. Huawei and Tencent\nare probably the two most well-known examples, with\nthe former accused of maintaining close links to the\nPeople’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the Ministry of\nState Security (MSS), and the latter being an eager\naccomplice in implementing China’s repressive policies\nat home, while partly owning popular computer games\nplayed by millions abroad – including Fortnite and\nPUBG (Singh, 2019; Cook, 2019).\n\nNote: Some analysts suggest that the global\nexpansion of Chinese high-tech companies and capital\nis synonymous to a digital Silkroad strategy and thus a\nsupporting component to Beijing’s Belt and Road\ninitiative (CSIS, 2019).\n\n(4) **Cybersecurity & defense – Apart from the**\nitems already mentioned under the header of cyber\nsovereignty, China has “publicly identified cyberspace\nas a critical domain for national security and declared\nits intent to expedite the development of its cyber\nforces” (OSD, 2019, p. 64). According to the US\nDepartment of Defense, “PLA writings note the\neffectiveness of [information operation] and\ncyberwarfare in recent conflicts and advocate targeting\nan adversary’s C2 and logistics networks to affect its\nability to operate during the early stages of conflict.\nThey credit cyberattacks on an enemy’s C2 system with\nthe potential to ‘completely disrupt’ these systems,\nparalyzing the victim and thus gaining battlefield\nsuperiority for the attacker. Accordingly, the PLA may\nseek to use its cyberwarfare capabilities to collect data\nfor intelligence and cyberattack purposes; to constrain\nan adversary’s actions by targeting network-based\nlogistics, communications, and commercial activities; or\nto serve as a force multiplier when coupled with kinetic\nattacks during armed conflict” (OSD, 2019, p. 64).\n\nIn 2016, the PLA fused together disparate\ninformation warfare and cyber capabilities to create\nthe Strategic Support Force (SSF)(中国人民解放军战略支援\n\n部 队 ), which serves as “a theater command-level\norganization to centralize strategic space, cyber,\nelectronic, and psychological warfare missions” (OSD,\n\n\n2019, p. 48). The creation of the SSF is in line with\nChinese thinking on ‘cyberspace superiority’ and “using\noffensive cyber operations to deter or degrade an\nadversary’s ability to conduct military operations\nagainst China” (OSD, 2019, p. 57). The DoD further\nnotes that “Chinese writings suggest cyber operations\nallow China to manage the escalation of a conflict\nbecause cyber attacks are a low-cost deterrent. The\nwritings also suggest that cyber attacks demonstrate\ncapabilities and resolve to an adversary. To support\nA2/AD, Chinese cyber attack operations aim to target\ncritical military and civilian nodes to deter or disrupt\nadversary intervention, and to retain the option to\nscale these attacks to achieve desired conditions with\nminimal strategic cost” (OSD, 2019, p. 56).\n\nAs of this writing, – and according to open\nsource - China has not conducted any offensive cyber\noperations against Japan that have touched the\nthreshold for the use of force.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3 Threat landscape chronology\n\nThis section provides a chronological overview\nof relevant events between 2000 and 2019, pertaining\nto the interaction between Japan and the People’s\nRepublic of China in cyberspace. Gold marks events in\nwhich a technical and/or political attribution was\nmade. Light blue marks events with no attribution\nassessment whatsoever, but whose targeting strongly\noverlaps with Chinese national interests. As far as open\nsource information is available, there have been no\nreported cyber incidents in China that were attributed\nto Japan-based threat actors, nor any data breaches in\nChina that might be considered to be in line with\nJapanese national security interests.\n\nSeptember regularly stands out historically as\nthe month that sees very high activity from Chinese\nnational hacktivists hitting Japanese targets. This\nactivity relates to the anniversary of the Japanese\ninvasion of Manchuria in September 18, 1931, and the\nestablishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo. It is\nimportant to note that Chinese hacktivist do not\nmobilize every year with the same veracity. It ebbs and\nflows depending on other factors that are outside the\npurview of this paper. September 2011 for example\nwas a very quiet month, possibly due to the ongoing\nFukushima nuclear incident that captured headlines\naround the world. Meanwhile, September 2012 saw\nthe largest onslaught of Chinese hacktivists to date due\nto the Japanese government officially purchasing the\nDiaoyu/Senkaku Islands on September 11, 2012.\n\nPlease also note that the month of September is\nan exception in terms of causality. It markedly stands\napart from the more opportunistic driven Chinese\nhacktivist campaigns – such as when the Japanese\nPrime Minister visits the Yasukuni Shrine - or other\nJapan-related news that make their way onto Chinese\nsocial media and bulletin boards to inevitably serve as a\nreason to organize anti-Japanese campaigns.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of incidents listed\nbelow have little to no connection to historical dates or\ngeopolitical events. To date, Chinese activity against\nJapan can overall be categorized as a persistent cyber\nespionage campaign in line with supporting China’s\nlong-term strategic interests.\n\n|Date Incident announced (Incident occurred)|Events|\n|---|---|\n|Jan. 29 2000 (Jan. 25-Jan. 30)|In reaction to Tokyo’s decision to give the go- ahead to a controversial conference in Osaka, titled “The Verification of the Rape of Nanking: The Biggest Lie of the 20th Century,” Chinese nationalistic hacktivists bombarded e-mail inboxes, redirected queries to porn sites, and defaced several Japanese websites with anti- Japanese messages. Messages included: “Nippon [Japan] is rotten animal,” and “Japanese - As all peoples know, it's a folk which has no concern to face the truth of history. They are the disgrace of Asia.\" (Watts, 2000) According to The Guardian and ScanNetSecurity, the hacktivists wiped census data from the website of the government’s statistical bureau, and tried to gain access to the Bank of Japan, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, the Labor Agency, the Defense Agency, and Japan's Management and Coordination Agency (BBC, 2000; ScanNetSecurity, 2000) In reaction to the onslaught, the “Metropolitan police agency set up a special squad of 50 police officers to investigate internet crime,” and the government said it “will dispatch officials to the US to seek advice on measures to prevent cyber terrorism” (Watts 2000). The incident also spurred the adoption of a special action plan to protect Japan’s critical infrastructure from cyber terrorism, including measures such as reviewing critical infrastructure protection, and establishing and strengthening public- private partnerships (ISMPO, 2000). The hacktivists signed off as the “Brazil p00 Hackerz” and “Billy in Hunan Province” (Watts, 2000; ScanNetSecurity, 2000)|\n|March 2011 (March 2011- unknown)|According to CrowdStrike, APT12/IXESHE was targeting Japanese organizations during the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which was “most likely done to close intelligence gaps on the ground cleanup/mitigation operation” (Meyers, 2013).|\n|July 10, 2011 (July 10-11, 2011)|A DDoS attack is launched against Japan’s National Policy Agency (NPA), temporarily making the website inaccessible. According to a statement released by the NPA, the attack was organized on a major Chinese bulletin board, in reaction to events surrounding the Diaoyu/Senkaku Island dispute (NPA, 2011).|\n|Sept. 19, 2011 (August 2011)|Japanese defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is breached. In September Japanese media outlets report on the breach citing internal MHI documents. Japanese government officials are furious as this is the first time they hear of the MHI breach, because the company failed to report the incident to the authorities (McCurry, 2011). On September 21, Mitsubishi confirmed that it was breached but that no classified information was leaked (MHI, 2011). Overall, 83 computers in at least 11 locations were infected with eight different malware products. According to the New York Times, the “Tokyo headquarter, factories, and a|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|research and development center were accessed in the breach” (Tabuchi, 2011). The BBC noted that “the viruses targeted a shipyard in Nagasaki, where destroyers are built, and a facility in Kobe that manufactures submarines and parts for nuclear power stations. [And] plant in Nagoya, where the company designs and builds guidance and propulsion systems for rockets and missiles” (BBC, 2011). MHI is a contractor for Raytheon and Lockheed and builds the F-15 fighter jet, Patriot missile defense batteries, as well as the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile in Japan. On October 24, Asahi reports that the attackers “likely netted military data on warplanes and information on nuclear power plants” (Kubota, 2011). Japanese defense contractor IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries also reported that they received malware-ridden emails for months, but their security systems filtered them out (Kubota, 2011).|\n|---|---|\n|Oct. 25, 2011 (July 2011)|According to the Asahi Shimbun, computers and servers used by the Japanese House of Representatives were infected when a Trojan was emailed to a Lower House member in July 2011. The attackers gained access to email communications and stole usernames and passwords. In early November, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Isao Saito further explained that, \"the upper house office has confirmed that seven suspicious emails, the same ones that were sent to the lower house, were found\" (Phys.org, 2011) None of the House of Councilor’s email servers were compromised. (Phys.org, 2011). At the time, Sophos noted that although one exfiltration server was located in mainland China this was not sufficient evidence to leap to a Chinese operation (Cluley, 2011). In September 2013, Kaspersky released its report on Icefog – a small Chinese APT group, possibly mercenaries for hire - which focus on targets in South Korea and Japan. The report goes on to state that, “back in 2011, we analyzed malware samples that were used to attack several Japanese organizations. Among the attacked organizations were the Japanese House of Representatives and the House of Councilors” (Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 14).|\n|Oct. 27, 2011 (unclear)|The Yomiuri Shimbun reports that “at least dozens of computers used at Japanese diplomatic offices in nine countries [Canada, China, France, Myanmar, The Netherlands, South Korea, and the US] have been infected with” an unspecified backdoor (Yomiuri Shimbun, 2011). The Japanese Foreign Ministry launched an investigation, “suspecting the infection was caused by so- called spear attacks targeting the ministry's confidential diplomatic information” (Yomiuri Shimbun, 2011). It is unclear whether the investigation has led to any results.|\n|Oct. 28, 2011 (unclear)|According to then Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism, Takeshi Maeda, a server at Japan’s Geospatial Information Authority (GSI) was illegally accessed. (Geospatialworld.net, 2011) The GSI noted that the affected server was used for “very long baseline interferometry, in which radio waves from stars are picked up through several antennas, and the difference in arrival|\n\n|Col1|time is used to measure distances” (Geospatialworld.net, 2011). No personal or confidential information was accessed, but scientific data may have been compromised. Some analysts speculate that the GSI server might have been targeted as a trusted hop-off point to compromise other government systems (Ryall, 2011).|\n|---|---|\n|January 6, 2012 (July 6, 2011- January 6, 2012)|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) discovers that “a computer terminal used by one of our employees was infected with a computer virus, and information stored in the computer as well as system information that is accessible by the employee have been leaking outside” (JAXA, 2012a). On March 27, the investigation concludes with the result that no classified data was stored on the affected system, and no sensitive data on the H-II Transfer vehicle (HTV) was leaked. According to JAXA, the infection vector was a malicious email send to an employee who “did not update the computer [Office automation] software” (JAXA, 2012b).|\n|March 29, 2012 (June 2011- unclear)|Trend Micro publishes its report on Luckycat. It notes that “in addition to targeting Indian military research institutions, as previously revealed by Symantec, the same [cyber- espionage] campaign targeted entities in Japan as well as the Tibetan community. […] We were able to track elements of this campaign to hackers based in China” (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 1). While Trend Micro does not name any specific Japanese victims, it does state that “the Luckycat campaign […] has been linked to 90 attacks against targets in Japan and India as well as Tibetan activists. […] In sum the Luckycat campaign managed to compromise 233 computers” (Trend Micro, p. 1).|\n|Sept. 18-19, 2012|The dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands intensifies as Tokyo decided to buy the islands on September 11 from the Japanese family who had owned them for the past 100+ years. The date of the purchase coincides with the anniversary of the Mukden Incident of September 18, 1931, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo On September 18 the Honker Union conducts DDoS attacks, doxing campaigns, and defacements against 19 Japanese websites. According to the Japanese National Police Agency, 11 sites were hit with DDoS attacks, including the Japanese Defense Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Japanese Supreme Court, the Tokyo Institute of Technology. At least six other sites were defaced with the Chinese flag (NPA, 2012). At the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the hacktivists also leaked the names and telephone numbers of over 1000 staffers (Muncaster, 2012). Overall, the Honker Union shortlisted around 300 sites with over 4,000 individuals posting messages about planned attacks on the Chinese chat site YY. According to then Minister of Internal Affairs and Communication, Tatsuo Kawabata, the DDoS attacks were most intense on Sunday afternoon (September 16) with 95% of traffic originating from China (Kyodo News, 2012).|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Nov. 30, 2012 (March 17, 2011- Nov. 21, 2012)|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency announces another breach (JAXA, 2012c). The leaked information possibly included specification and operation related information on numerous space launch vehicles. On February 19, 2013 JAXA publishes the results of its investigation. According to the press release a computer terminal was infected on March 17 with a spoofed email dated March 15. The release notes that, “access from the said terminal to an outside malicious website was detected between March 17, 2011 and November 21, 2012. The communication volume and contents were unknown, and we cannot deny the possibility that information has been leaked from the said terminal” (JAXA, 2013a).|\n|---|---|\n|January 1, 2013 (unknown)|Citing government sources, the Daily Yomiuri reports that the computer of an employee at the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries had been infected last year. More than 3000 documents were exfiltrated, including 20 top-secret documents on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact negotiations, documents on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit meeting in November 2011, and the Japan-US summit meeting in April 2012 (Phneah, 2013). The infected computer allegedly communicated with a server in South Korea.|\n|Feb. 5,2013 (unknown)|The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announces that it was informed by the National Information Security Center (NISC) of a “suspicious communication from a computer within MOFA with an external server” (MOFA, 2013). The Ministry suspects that “approximately 20 documents were leaked from the computer” (MOFA, 2013).|\n|Feb. 19, 2013|Mandiant releases its APT 1 report.7 By April 2014, Mandiant observes that APT 1 ceased almost all of its activities between February 13, 2013 to August 1, 2013 (Fung, 2014). Cylance also noticed “a fairly large lul in activity from March-August 2013,” explaining that the “activity didn’t cease entirely, but the volume of malware SPEAR was able to collect during this period was remarkably decreased” (Gross, 2016, p. 4).|\n|April 23, 2013 (April 13-22, 2013)|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is breached for the third time. On July 2, 2013, JAXA published the results of its investigation (JAXA, 2013b). According to the report one server - which stored the ID and passwords of four other servers - was compromised. Technical information related to the Japan Experimental Module “Kibo” (JEM) and the space station replenisher “Kounotori” (HTV) were exfiltrated. Personal email addresses were also leaked.|\n|Sept. 25, 2013|Kaspersky releases its report on Icefog, which notes that the APT also targeted Fuji TV and the Japan-China Economic Association (Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 33).|\n|Sept. 3, 2014|FireEye publishes a blogpost on APT12/IXESHE noting that the group “recently started a new campaign targeting organizations in Japan and Taiwan. APT12 is believed to be a cyber- espionage group thought to have links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. APT12's|\n\n\n7 For the full report see: Mandiant, 2013\n\n|Col1|targets are consistent with larger People's Republic of China (PRC) goals” (Moran & Oppenheim, 2014).|\n|---|---|\n|Sept. 10, 2014|FireEye publishes its report titled ‘Operation Quantum Entanglement’ which identifies two separates yet connected campaigns. The first is the Moafee group, which operates out of Guangdong province and targets “governments and militaries of countries with national interests in the South China Sea” (Haq et al. 2014, p. 17). The second is the DragonOK group operating out of Jiangsu province, “which targets high-technology and manufacturing companies in both Japan and Taiwan” (Haq et al. 2014, p. 4). The report explains that “DragonOK used similar malware to the Moafee group. Specifically, we observed DragonOK employing PoisonIvy, Nflog, Mongall, CT, and NewCT” (Haq et al. 2014, p. 19). The report goes on to note that, “we believe that these groups are from two distinct regions in China and possibly (1) are collaborating, (2) received the same training, (3) have a common toolkit supply chain, or some combination of these three” (Haq et al. 2014, p. 3).|\n|November 12, 2014|Symantec reports that CloudyOmega actively exploited an Ichitaro zero-day in the wild (Japanese Office Suit Software) to target Japanese organizations. Symantec traces CloudyOmega’s campaign back to at least 2011. According to the blogpost “the public sector in Japan is the most targeted sector hit by Operation CloudyOmega” (Symantec, 2014). Other Japanese sectors include: the chemical sector, the financial sector, trading companies, conglomerates, and think tanks.|\n|April 14, 2015 (January-March 2015)|On April 14, Palo Alto Network’s Unit 42 identifies a new DragonOK backdoor deployed against Japanese targets in at least five phishing campaigns. According to the blogpost “all five phishing campaigns targeted a Japanese manufacturing firm over the course of two months, but the final campaign also targeted a separate Japanese high-tech organization” (Miller-Osborn & Grunzweig, 2015).|\n|June 1, 2015 (May 8-23, 2015)|The Japanese Pension Service (JPS) is breached. Since May 8, JPS received 124 malicious emails. Five staffers opened some of them and the infection spread to 31 computers. Between May 21-23 the personal information of 1.25 million Japanese citizens was exfiltrated. On June 1, the JPS publicly announced in a press conference that its network was breached (JPS, 2015). The total amount for remediation cost and recovery is calculated to be around $8 million USD (Kakumaru et al. 2016, slide 4). On May 20, 2018, Japanese law enforcement closes the criminal investigation without any results. On November 6, 2015, JP-CERT/CC notes that the attack against the “Japan Pension Service indeed drew nationwide attention, but Emdivi has victimized several other government and private organizations. This attack campaign, specifically targeting Japan, is also known as ‘CloudyOmega’ named by Symantec, or ‘Blue Termite’ by Kaspersky” (Kubo & Kubo, 2015). As of this writing, the exfiltrated documents of neither breach have been used for malicious purposes, which likely indicates that they are|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|used for operational purposes by a foreign government agency. Note: Around the same time in June the US Office of Personnel Management announced that it was breached and the personal information of 22.1 million US government employees was exfiltrated.|\n|---|---|\n|August 14, 2015|Raytheon submits its secret report on Stalker Panda to the US government. The report notes that the group has possible links to the PLA and has conducted “targeted attacks against Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States” […] centered on political, media, and engineering sectors” (Raytheon, 2015, p. 1).|\n|August 20, 2015|Kaspersky releases its findings on Blue Termite – noting that the Chinese cyberespionage campaign “has been targeting hundreds of organizations in Japan” since 2013 (Kaspersky Lab, 2015).|\n|June 9-25, 2015 (unclear)|In the aftermath of the JPS breach, several Japanese organizations also report that they have been targeted/breached by Blue Termite/CloudyOmega/EMDIVI, including: The Petroleum Association of Japan (June 9), the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry (June 10), the National Institute for Health Services (June 13), the Japan Energy Service Corporation (June 17), Waseda University (June 22), and the Japanese Ministry of Justice (June 25) (Kakumaru et al. 2016, slide 5).|\n|Feb. 24, 2016 (2010-X)|Cylance releases its report on Operation Dust Storm which became active around 2010. The report notes that “attack telemetry in 2015 indicates the Dust Storm group has migrated from more traditional government and defense-related intelligence targets to exclusively seek out organizations involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources. The group recently compromised a wide breadth of victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction” (Gross, 2016, p. 1). Cylance also highlights an attack by Dust Storm in early February 2015 targeted an unnamed “investment arm of a major Japanese automaker” (Gross, 2016, p. 4). And it also discovered two campaigns in July- October 2015 against an unnamed Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility and an unnamed major Japanese oil and gas company (Gross, 2016, p. 6).|\n|April 28, 2016 (2006-X)|Symantec releases a blog post on Tick/Bronze Butler noting that “a longstanding cyberespionage campaign has been targeting mainly Japanese organizations with its own custom-developed malware. The group, known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery. […] Tick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting sectors in Japan” (DiMaggio, 2016a). On Oct. 12, 2017, Secureworks releases its threat analysis on Tick/Bronze Butler. It notes that the group “likely originates in the People’s Republic of China” and has run a long-standing campaign intended to “exfiltrate|\n\n|Col1|intellectual property and other confidential data from Japanese organizations” (Secureworks, 2017).|\n|---|---|\n|November 2016 (July 1, 2014- October 2016)|The Japanese Business Foundation (Keidanren) officially reports that its network has been breached. On July 1, 2014, the Keidanren's International Cooperation Bureau received an email with a malicious attachment that triggered the breach (most likely a backdoor). According to Asahi, the e-mail was sent from an organization that Keidanren officials often worked with, and which was involved in the bilateral relations with China. It was later uncovered that the computer system of that organization had also been hacked earlier. On July 3, a remote access tool was installed on the Keidanren system. Two months later the exfiltration of documents and emails began to a server based in China's Guangdong province (Sudo, 2019). It wasn't until early October 2016 that Keidanren officials were informed by the company overseeing its computer system that suspicious transmissions had been uncovered. According to Kyodo News, the “investigative team found a large amount of suspicious data communications between 10 external servers and 23 infected PCs” (Kyodo News, 2019). Keidanren eventually paid several hundreds of millions of yen to replace its computer system. It is not entirely clear from open source reporting whether APT10 was responsible or not.|\n|Nov., 2016 (September 2016)|According to Kyodo News, the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) - which is the name for the joint network of Japan’s Self- Defense Forces – was targeted by a “sophisticated cyberattack” (Kyodo, 2016). The news report notes that “possibly a state actor, […] gained unauthorized access to computers at the National Defense Academy and the National Defense Medical College, using them as a gateway to enter the [Ground Self-Defense Force’s] computer system” (Kyodo, 2016). According to Kyodo News, “the incident prompted the ministry and the SDF to temporarily ban internal internet use” (Kyodo 2016). To date, no open-source information is available as to what infected the DII, how far it penetrated into the network, nor whether any data was actually compromised or exfiltrated.|\n|January 2017 (unclear)|FireEye reports in July 2017 that: APT10 sent an email related to an annual budget for scientific research to a Japanese government agency to deliver the HAYMAKER and BUGJUICE malware. APT10 targeted a Japanese manufacturer with an email lure related to China’s defense strategy and news events such as the assassination of Kim Jong- Nam. APT10 also targeted a Japanese company in the media and entertainment industry (APSM, 2017).|\n|April 2017|BAE Systems and PwC UK release their report on Operation Cloud Hopper/APT10. According to the report, “in a separate operation, APT10 has been systematically targeting Japanese organization” using ChChes malware, which shares infrastructure with APT10 but exhibits operational differences – suggesting a “potential sub-|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|division within the threat actor” (PwC & BAE Systems, 2017, p. 9). In July 2017, Trend Micro publishes a blog post on the ChessMaster campaign which targets “Japanese academia, technology enterprises, media outfits, managed service providers, and government agencies” (Sy et al. 2017). The post also explains overlaps between APT10, Blue Termite/EMDIVI, and ChessMaster.|\n|---|---|\n|July 2018 (unclear)|FireEye reports that it “detected and blocked what appears to be APT10 (Menupass) activity targeting the Japanese media sector” (Matsuda & Muhammad, 2018). The group used malicious emails that installed the UPPERCUT backdoor (ANEL)|\n|Dec. 21, 2018|In reaction to the US DoJ indictment of two Chinese hackers associated with the Ministry of State Security/APT10, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs releases a statement on APT10 (MOFA, 2018).|\n|July 24, 2019 (2011-X)|German public broadcasters BR and NDR release their investigation into Winnti, noting that it is a “presumably China-based” “digital mercenary” group that is “attacking companies in Japan, France, the U.S. and Germany” (Tanriverdi et al. 2019). The report further notes that Winnti targeted Japan’s biggest chemical company, Shin Etsu Chemical, in 2015, and penetrated the networks of Sumitomo Electric in the summer of 2016 (Tanriverdi et al. 2019).|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 4 Japanese teams targeting China\n\nThe Japanese MoD has a defensive framework in\nplace for responding to cyberattacks against its own\ninformation systems, but the Japanese Self-Defense\nForces do currently not have the legal authority to\noffensively engage adversaries outside the MoD’s wire\nduring peacetime (MoD, n.d.). That being said, the\noverhaul of the National Defense Guidelines in\nDecember 2018 has lain the groundwork for allowing\nthe SDF to – in case of an armed attack against Japan “block and eliminate the attack by leveraging\ncapabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic\ndomains” (Cabinet Secretariat, 2018, p. 12). According\nto the guidelines, this also includes capabilities to\ndisrupt an opponent’s use of cyberspace amidst an\nattack against Japan (MoD 2018b, p. 20).\n\nIn 2019, the MoD outsourced the development\nof offensive cyber capabilities to one or several\nunnamed private Japanese companies – mirroring the\nMoD’s cooperation with Fujitsu in 2012. [8] The\nconceptual idea is that the SDF will utilize these\noffensive cyber capabilities for defensive purposes\nduring wartime and deterrence purposes during\npeacetime. Yet, how this will actually work in practice is\ncurrently anyone’s best guess.\n\nThe most likely route will be that the SDF’s\nCyber Defense Group (サイバー防衛隊) will become the\nMoD’s tip of the spear. [9] The Group was established in\nMay 2013 (Nikkei, 2013) and politically consolidated in\nJune with the adoption of Japan’s first Cybersecurity\nStrategy (ISPC, 2013, p. 42). Currently, the Cyber\nDefense Group serves as the milCERT for the SDF’s joint\nnetwork - called the Defense Information\nInfrastructure. Meaning, the Group’s capabilities are\nsimilar to the CERT teams within the three SDF service\nwings. [10] In FY2019, the SDF’s Cyber Defense Group is\nset to increase its staffing from 150 to 220 (MoD,\n2018c, p. 6). For FY2020, the plan is to increase that\nnumber to 290 (MoD, 2019c, p. 6).[11] As of this writing,\nthe SDF has not conducted any offensive cyber\noperations against Chinese targets.\n\n8 Note: Back in 2012, the MoD outsource the development of a ‘seek\nand destroy’ malware to Fujitsu (Leyden, 2012). Open sources are not\nentirely clear as to whether the Fujitsu malware failed to produce the\nexpected results or why exactly the product was shelved in end.\n\n9 Note: In the official English translation, the provisional name for the\nCyber Defense Group was “Cyber Defense unit” (small u). Its official\nname now is the Cyber Defense Group.\n\n10 Staffing numbers for the three service wing CERTs: The GSDF\nSystem Protection Unit (Army)(FY2020: ~140 personnel), the MSDF\nCommunication Security Group (Navy)(FY2020: ~100 personnel), and\nthe ASDF Computer Security Evaluation Squadron (Air Force)(FY2020:\n~130 personnel).\n\n11 The Cyber Defense Group is a joint unit and thus draws its\nmembers from the three service wings.\n\n\nThere is little to no open-source information\navailable as to what Japan’s intelligence agencies are\ndoing in cyberspace. According to a 2008 NSA memo\npublished by The Intercept in 2018, the MoD’s\nDirectorate for Signal Intelligence (DFS)(電波部) is “still\ncaught in a Cold War way of doing business,” which\nmakes it “very hard to engage with them in\nmultinational forums or even to get them to\ncollaborate across Japanese government lanes.\nBilaterally (NSA-DFS) they are a good partner, but they\nare very reluctant to participate with mixed or larger\ngroups” (The Intercept, 2017, p. 1). The small trove of\nNSA documents tackling the DFS shows that the\ndirectorate has been learning from the NSA since 2012\nto set up its own “SIGINT-enabled cyber operations” to\nenhance and streamline DFS’ data collection efforts\n(The Intercept, 2018). It is unknown whether the DFS,\nor any other Japanese intelligence agency – most\nnotably the Cabinet Intelligence and Research\nOrganization (CIRO), the MoD’s C4 Systems\nDepartment (J6), or the Ministry of Justice’s Public\nSecurity Intelligence Agency (PSIA) - have conducted\nany computer intrusions into Chinese systems.\n\nAs far as available open source information\ngoes, there are also no known Japan-based non-state\nactors that have targeted Chinese companies or\ngovernment agencies. Please note that, given the lack\nof in-depth research on Japanese non-state actors in\ncyberspace, this assessment is very shaky. Future\nhistorical research might reveal dynamics that we know\nlittle about today.\n\nDisclaimer: Research inquiries send to the\nChinese International Press Center (IPC) – to get in\ntouch with the Chinese Ministry of Defense and the\nMinistries of Public and State Security – went\nunanswered despite several follow-up emails. Similarly,\ngetting in touch with information security vendor\nQihoo 360 - to gain insights into China’s threat\nlandscape - were sadly unsuccessful.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5 Chinese teams targeting Japan\n\nThe number of Chinese teams hitting Japanese\nassets can be roughly divided into four categories:\nNationalistic hacktivist, the People’s Liberation Army,\nThe Ministry of State Security, and contractors/\nmercenaries-for-hire. This section discusses the various\nactors, their characteristics, preferred targets and\ntooling as per open source information available.\n\nNote: The section tries to differentiate between\nproprietary and widely available tooling. However, the\nline between these two categories is not as steadfast as\nthe terminology suggests. Widely available tools are\nbroadly defined all those pen-testing and red team\ntooling that is either legitimate (ex. Mimikatz), or\nwhose malware products are extensively used by a\nnumber of different ATP threat actors/cybercriminals.\nOn the other hand, proprietary tools are defined as\ncustom designed malware products that are exclusively\nused by one particular threat actor or group of threat\nactors. The author recognizes that this categorization is\nnot perfect, and that depending on one’s visibility,\nsome proprietary tools could be classified as being\nwidely available.\n\nDisclaimer: Security vendors do occasionally\ndisagree on whether a certain group is responsible for a\nspecific campaign or targeted infection. This paper\nrecognizes that the art of technical attribution has its\nlimitations and difficulties, and that not every security\nvendor will agree with every attribution assessment\nmade. Similarly, this paper understands that it is\ngenerally inappropriate to attribute an attack to a\ngroup solely based on the malware deployed or\ninfrastructure used. Please also note, that each major\nvendor has their own APT naming convention.[12]\n\n##### 5.1 Nationalistic Hacktivists\n\nIn the late 1990s, Chinese nationalistic\nhacktivists mobilized for the first time when riots broke\nout across Indonesia in 1998, and when the US\naccidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade\nduring the Kosovo conflict in 1999.\n\nIn the Indonesian case, Chinese netizens were\noutraged when news of targeted attacks against\nChinese-Indonesians reached the international ethnic\nChinese communities. The May 1998 riots were\nsubsequently labelled as \"anti-Chinese\" and Chinese\nnetizens set up discussion boards and social media\ngroups to organize defacements of Indonesian\ngovernment websites (Desombre & Byrnes, 2018). As\n\n12 For additional APT aliases see: MISP, n.d.; MITRE Att&ck, n.d.;\nThaiCERT, 2019\n\n\nDsombre and Byrnes explained, “many of these boards\nevolved into the first Chinese hacking groups”\n(Desombre & Byrnes, 2018, p. 6).\n\nOne year later, the death of three Chinese\nreporters amidst the US bombing of the Chinese\nembassy in Belgrade, sparked numerous DDoS attacks\nagainst NATO email servers, defacements of US\ngovernment websites, and a flood of malware-ridden\nemails targeting NATO and US government officials\n(Stout, 1999). Out of the ashes - of what Wired labeled\nthe “first Internet war” - emerged the largest and most\nprominent Chinese hacktivist collective – the Honker\nUnion of China – which although fragmented, remains\nactive today.[13]\n\n**Honker Union (中国红客)**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Unknown\nWidely available: Various; HTran\n\n**Targets**\nTargets designated by geopolitical events. Predominately, Japanese\nministerial and agency websites, and Japanese bulletin boards.\n\nThe Honker Union emerged during the late\n1990s and primarily gravitated around the longstanding cnhonker.com forum. Over the years, many\nUnion members ventured into the legitimate\ncybersecurity sector and provided insights into the\ngroup. In a 2013 interview with the South China\nMorning Post, former Union member Liu Qing for\nexample explained that, “I am mature businessman\nnow, but I am proud to have participated in a patriotic\ncyberwar back then” (Nan, 2013). According to Liu, he\njoined the Union after the Hainan Island Incident in\nApril 2011, when an EP-3 US spy plane collided with a J8 Chinese jet fighter in mid-air. The body of the Chinese\npilot was never recovered and the US plane had to\nconduct an unauthorized emergency landing at the\nPLA’s Lingshui air base. According to Liu, hundreds of\nChinese websites suffered attacks believed to have\noriginated from the US in the aftermath of the incident\n– leading Liu and others to discuss counterstrike plans.\nAs Liu put it “we were so angry and decided to fight\nback” (Nan, 2013). For the Honker Union the counterUS campaign on May 1, 2001 was a landmark event.\nAccording to the SCMP, “the group attracted more than\n80,000 members in the following months, making it the\nlargest hacker organization to date in China’s internet\nhistory” (Nan, 2013).\n\nSoberly looking back however, one has to\nconclude that this episode of hacktivist mobilization\nwas one of severe over-interpretation and misguided\nmedia reporting. Back in late-April 2001, Jericho and\nSioda over at Attrition.org summarized it aptly when\n\n13 The term \"honker\" literally translates into \"red guest” in Chinese,\ne.g. “black hat.”\n\n\n-----\n\nthey noted that: (a) Website defacements happen all\nthe time, (b) the US hackers that defaced Chinese\nwebsites initially had no political agenda at all\n(Poisonbox and Pr0phet), and (c) after Wired reported\nabout an ongoing US hacker campaign against China –\nwithout actually providing any tangible evidence –, the\nwhole story developed its own dynamics. As Jericho\nand Sioda put it, “the collective dick-waving of a bunch\nof script-kidiots fueled by so-called journalists\ngenerating media hype” led to “the former trying to\nfeed their egos and the latter to feed their hit counts”\n(Jericho & Sioda, 2001).\n\nIn 2010, the Honker Union prominently went to\n“war” against Iran, after the Iranian Cyber Army\nhijacked the DNS records of China’s most popular\nsearch engine Baidu to redirect its traffic to a website\nfeaturing the sentence \"protesting the military\nintervention of foreign and Israeli sites in our internal\naffairs division and distribution of false news”\n(Danchev, 2010). It is still unclear why the Iranian Cyber\nArmy targeted Baidu in the first place, nor whether\nthey expected Chinese hacktivists to just simply stand\nby and watch. Naturally, it did not take long for several\nIranian websites to be DDoS’d, defaced with Chinese\nflags, and plastered with messages such as \"We are\nChina’s hacker! Let the world hear the voice of China!\nThe state is higher than the dignity of all!\" (China\nEconomic Review, 2010).\n\nToday the Honker Union is largely “fragmented\nand divided between several different forums, with\ndifferent levels of activity” (Edwards, 2018). This\nstructure works rather well to strengthen Chinese\nhacktivism at large, as most platforms maintain a\nhierarchical structure that actively trains new members\non the lower levels, and hones the skills of advanced\nactors at the top. Meaning the Union can mobilize\nquantity over quality without degrading its advanced\noperations.\n\nDespite rumors to the contrary, it is unclear\nwhether the Honker Union, or any of the other Chinese\nhacking communities, had or do currently maintain\ndirect ties to the Chinese government, military, or the\nintelligence services. It is highly likely that the line\nbetween nationalistic hacktivism and working for the\nChinese government is murky at best, non-existent at\nworst.\n\nNote: HTran, also called the HUC Packet\nTransmit Tool, was written by Honker Union member\nlion and bkbll in 2003 (lion & bkbll, 2003). It is a\n“rudimentary connection bouncer, designed to redirect\nTCP traffic destined for one host to an alternate host”\n(Stewart, 2011). Its primary purpose is to “disguise\neither the true source or destination of Internet traffic\nin the course of hacking activity” (Stewart, 2011).\nHTran is widely used outside the Chinese hacktivism\n\n\nscene, including by Chinese threat actors such as APT1,\nAPT12, and DragonOK (Bureau & Jennings, 2018).\n\n**LuckyCat**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Unknown\nWidely available: Sparksrv and Comfoo malware variants; Sojax\nmalware;\n\n**Targets**\nIndian military research organizations; South Asian shipping\ncompanies (some in Malaysia); Japanese entities’ Tibetan\ncommunity and activists\n\nContrary to the ‘loud’ activities by the Honker\nUnion, the LuckyCat hackers are one prominent\nexample of a ‘silent’ campaign executed by members of\nthe Chinese hacking community.\n\nSymantec was the first to publicly report on the\nLuckyCat campaign back in March 2012. According to\nthe report, the group conducted a series of attacks\nagainst Indian military research and South Asian\nshipping organizations. The data stolen varied from\ncase to case, but appeared to be simply geared at\ndocuments with suggestive names. Meaning, the\nhackers also inexplicably exfiltrated documents that\nwere publicly available on the victim’s website. All in\nall, Symantec describes the attackers as “us[ing] very\nsimple malware, which required little development\ntime or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web\nhosting, to implement a highly effective attack”\n(Symantec, 2012a, p. 1).\n\nLater in the same month, Trend Micro took a\ndeeper dive into LuckyCat. In terms of targeting, Trend\nMicro highlighted that the campaign was linked to at\nleast “90 attacks against targets in Japan and India as\nwell as Tibetan activist” (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 1).\nTrend Micro also uncovered significant overlaps with\nother campaigns, including ShadowNet and DuoJeen.\nThe former historically targeting Tibetan activists\nabroad, while the latter targets the Tibetan community\nwithin China (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 12-17).\n\nIn terms of attribution, Trend Micro\n“connect[ed] the email address used to register one of\nLuckyCat’s command-and-control servers to a hacker in\nthe Chinese underground community. He used the\nnickname ‘dang0102,’ and published posts in the\nfamous [Chinese] hacker forum, XFOCUS, as well as\nrecruited others to join a research project on network\nattack and defense at the Information Security Institute\nof the Sichuan University” (Trend Micro, 2012, p. 2).\nSymantec’s findings concur with Trend Micro’s\nattribution assessment, noting that “45 different\nattacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43\nwere within the same IP address range based in\nSichuan province, China” (Symantec, 2012a, p. 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.2 People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\n\nAs early as 2002, the first reports emerged that\na group operating out of Shanghai and linked to the\nPeople’s Liberation Army was conducting computer\nexploitation against US government organizations.\nAccording to a 2008 Wikileaks cable, the US State\nDepartment’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security explained\nthat Byzantine Candor - also known as the Comment\nGroup – hit the “U.S. Army, […] other DoD services, as\nwell as [Department of State], Department of Energy,\nadditional [US government] entities, and commercial\nsystems and networks” (Wikileaks, 2008). In 2013,\nMandiant published its groundbreaking APT1 report,\nwhich identified APT1 as the 2[nd] Bureau of the PLA’s 3[rd]\nDepartment – also known as Unit 61398 - operating out\nof the Pudong New Area in Shanghai (Mandiant, 2013,\np. 3 & 26). The Comment Group was APT1’s first known\ncampaign against a foreign government. On May 1,\n2014, the US Department of Justice indicted five PLA\nofficers – all members of Unit 61398 - for “computer\nhacking, economic espionage and other offenses\ndirected at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear\npower, metals and solar products industries” (US DoJ,\n2014). According to then U.S. Attorney General Eric\nHolder, the case represented “the first ever charges\nagainst a state actor for this type of hacking” (US DoJ,\n2014).\n\nResponding to these development Foreign\nMinistry Spokesperson Qin Gang, merely stated that\n\"the Chinese government, the Chinese military and\ntheir relevant personnel have never engaged or\nparticipated in cyber theft of trade secrets” (Xinhua,\n2014).\n\nTwo PLA-connected Chinese teams are known to\nhave hit Japanese assets.\n\n**APT1/Comment Group**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: PoisonIvy variants; SeaSalt\nWidely available: Various; Mimikatz\n\n**Targets**\nPrimarily US focused: IT sector, aerospace, public administrations,\nsatellites and telecommunications, scientific research and\nconsulting, energy, transportation, construction and manufacturing,\ninternational organizations, engineering services, high-tech\nelectronics, legal services, media and entertainment, navigation,\nchemicals, financial services, food and agriculture, metals and\nmining, healthcare, and education\n\nAPT1 gained notoriety when Mandiant released\nits report in 2013, aptly titled “APT1: Exposing One of\nChina’s Cyber Espionage Units.” Mandiant connected\nAPT1 to activity by the Comment Group in 2002 and\nobserved the group compromising 141 companies\nspanning 20 industrial sectors since 2006. The majority\nof APT1 targets were located in the US (115), with only\n\n\none unnamed target located in Japan (Mandiant, 2013,\np. 22).\n\nAfter the release of the Mandiant report, APT1\ndelayed its return to normal operations following the\nChinese New Year holiday in February 2013. It\neventually re-emerged six months later after shifting its\noperational infrastructure. With the Chinese\ngovernment vehemently denying any connection to\nAPT1, Mandiant’s Laura Galante rightly noted that,\nbecause “APT1 is supporting this denial storyline the\ngovernment is telling, [it] shows that they wanted to be\nseen as not actively doing this, or at least to cover up\ntheir involvement\" (Fung, 2014). It is not exactly clear\nwhen APT1 ceased its activity after re-emerging in\nAugust.\n\nNote: In 2018, McAfee uncovered code based on\nAPT1’s Seasalt malware – which the group last used in\n2010 - in a new implant McAfee named OceanSalt. The\ncurious part of the story is that the “source code used\nby APT1 never became public, nor did it wind up on the\nblack market” (Barrett, 2018). McAfee therefore\nsuggest two possible explanations. Either APT1 has\nreturned, or another adversary is conducting a falseflag operation to suggest that APT1 has re-emerged\n(Samani & Sherstobitoff, 2018). Given the exposure of\nAPT1 in 2013, it is highly likely that the group was split\nand its tooling disseminated to other PLA teams with\nbetter operational security.\n\n**APT12/IXESHE/DynCalc**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Various backdoors including RIPTIDE/Etumbot,\nTHREEBYTE, HIGHTIDE, WATERSPROUD, IXESHE, and Aumlib.\nWidely available: Various; HTran\n\n**Targets**\nJapanese high-tech companies, media outlets, telecommunications\nsector, government organizations\n\nIn October 2012, APT12 famously breached the\ncomputers of 53 employees at the New York Times\n(Perlroth, 2013). According to then NYT chief\ninformation officer Marc Frons, “they could have\nwreaked havoc on our systems. […] But that was not\nwhat they were after” (Perlroth, 2013). As the NYT\nreported four month later, APT12 “appeared to be\nlooking for […] the names of people who might have\nprovided information to [NYT Shanghai bureau Chief]\n\n[David] Baboza,” who published an investigative piece\non October 25, 2012, titled the “Billions in hidden\nriches for family of Chinese leader” (Perlroth, 2013).\nBased on thousands of corporate documents, Barboza\nuncovered and published a piece investigating the\nrelatives of Wen Jiabao – then China’s Prime Minister –\n\n\n-----\n\nwho had accumulated a fortune through shady\nbusiness dealings (Barboza, 2012).[14]\n\nNotably, APT12 also targeted Japanese\norganizations during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in\n2011, which, according to CrowdStrike, was “most\nlikely done to close intelligence gaps on the ground\ncleanup/mitigation operation (Meyers, 2013).\n\nFireEye posits that “APT12 is believed to be a\ncyber espionage group thought to have links to the\nChinese People's Liberation Army. APT12's targets are\nconsistent with larger People's Republic of China (PRC)\ngoals. Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this\ngroup are in-line with PRC goals and self-interest in\nTaiwan” (FireEye, n.d.).\n\nOne particular characteristic of APT12 is that it\nclosely monitors online media related to its tooling and\noperations. Meaning, it adapts very quickly to public\nexposure by using new tools, tactics, and procedures\n(Moran & Oppenheim, 2014). Additionally the group\nlikes to hide its activities by using compromised\nmachines within a target’s internal network as\ncommand and control servers. It also uses the opensource proxy tool HTran to mask its true location\n(Sancho et al., 2012, p. 15).\n\n14 Note: Prime Minister is the informal westernized title. The official\nChinese description is ‘Premier of the State Council of the People's\nRepublic of China.’\n\n\n##### 5.3 Ministry of State Security (MSS)\n\nIt is not entirely clear when exactly China’s main\nintelligence agency - the Ministry of State Security –\nmade its entry into the field of cyber espionage. Three\nMSS connected APTs have stood out in recent years\ndue to being doxed by the ominous group known as\nIntrusion Truth.\n\nStarting in 2009, APT10 conducted numerous\nespionage campaigns against US defense industrial\nbase companies, the technology and communications\nsector, as well as multiple companies around the world\nrelevant to China’s innovation and economic\ndevelopment goals (PwC & BAE Systems, 2017, p. 5). In\n2017, PwC and BAE Systems uncovered the most\nnotable APT10 operation to date, dubbed Cloud\nHopper. The op primarily targeted managed IT services\nproviders (MSPs), which allowed APT10\n“unprecedented potential access to the intellectual\nproperty and sensitive data of those MSPs and their\nclients globally” (PwC & BAE Systems, 2017, p. 4). On\nAugust 15, 2018, Intrusion Truth revealed that APT10\nwas managed out the Tianjin bureau of the Chinese\nMinistry of State Security (Intrusion Truth, 2018). Five\nmonths later, the DoJ unsealed an indictment against\ntwo APT10 members for “conspiracy to commit\ncomputer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud,\nand aggravated identity theft” (US DoJ, 2018).\n\nDubbed Operation Aurora by security vendor\nMcAfee in January 2010, APT17 targeted at least 34\ncompanies in the technology, financial and defense\nsectors starting in late-2009 (Goodin, 2010). Using a\nzero-day in Internet Explorer and “nearly a dozen\npieces of malware and several levels of encryption to\nburrow deeply into the bowels of company networks,”\nAPT17 was “highly successful in obfuscating the attack\nand avoiding common detection methods” (Zetter,\n2010). Dmitri Alperovitch, then vice president of threat\nresearch at McAfee, explained that \"we have never\never, outside of the defense industry, seen commercial\nindustrial companies come under that level of\nsophisticated attack\" (Zetter, 2010). On July 24, 2019,\nIntrusion Truth offered proof that APT17 was run out of\nthe Jinan bureau of the Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity (Intrusion Truth, 2019a). Similar to Chinese\nthreat actor group APT41, APT17 also exhibited\nhallmarks of financially motivated cybercriminal\noperations (Lyngaas, 2019b). According to Intrusion\nTruth, members of APT17 circulated a data for sale list\namongst the Chinese hacking community which also\nincluded packages on Chinese citizens (Intrusion Truth,\n2019b). As of this writing it is unclear whether the MSS\nhas lost control over APT17, or Intrusion Truth has lain\ndown a false flag to create friction between the MSS\nand APT17.\n\n\n-----\n\nUp until 2015, APT3 primarily targeted US and\nUK-based aerospace, defense, telecommunications,\nand transportation companies before shifting inward\nand honing in on Hong Kong-based political targets\n(Symantec, 2016). On May 9, 2017, Intrusion Truth\nidentified APT3 (Boyusec) as a Chinese contractor\nworking for the MSS (Intrusion Truth, 2017). Four\nmonths later the US Department of Justice unsealed an\nindictment against three Boyusec members for\n“computer hacking, theft of trade secrets, conspiracy\nand identity theft” (US DoJ, 2017). As of this writing,\nBoyusec has not resurfaced.\n\nAt least four MSS connected teams have struck\ntargets in Japan.\n\n**APT10/MenuPass/Stone Panda**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: PlugX/TinyX; REDLEAVES RAT; Sogu/Kaba, ChChes,\nHaymaker, Uppercut (ANEL), Snugride, Bugjuice backdoor\nWidely available: China Chopper, PsExec, gsecdump, Mimikatz,\nPowersploit, QuasarRAT\n\n**Targets**\nWorldwide; Broad spectrum of target industries\n\nAPT10 has been active since at least 2009 and\nhas “historically targeted construction and engineering,\naerospace, and telecom firms, and governments in the\nUnited States, Europe, and Japan” (FireEye, n.d.).\n\nAfter PwC and BAE Systems’ write-up on the\nCloud Hopper campaign in 2017, several security\nvendors also reported other APT10 campaigns\nconducted in the same year. According to a SCMP\narticle published in April 2018, FireEye identified two\nAPT10 campaigns against Japanese targets between\nSeptember and October 2017. Curiously the malware\nused also included taunting lines of text, including such\ngems as: “I’m here waiting for u,” “POWERED BY\nAPT632185, NORTH KOREA,” and “According to the\nanalysis report, some Japanese analysts have always\nbeen portrayed as a bit of a joke” (SCMP, 2018).\n\nIn February 2019, Insikt Group and Rapid7\nreported and attributed with “high confidence” an\nAPT10 campaign that took place between November\n2017 and September 2018. According to the analysis,\nthe targets included Visma – “a billion-dollar\nNorwegian [MSP] company with at least 850,000\ncustomers globally” –, an international apparel\ncompany, and a US law firm with “strong experience in\nintellectual property law with clients in the\npharmaceutical, technology, electronics, biomedical,\nand automotive sectors, among others” (Insikt Group &\nRapid7, 2019, p. 1). However, several security\nresearchers took issue with the attribution assessment.\nBenjamin Koehl, an analyst at Microsoft’s Threat\nIntelligence Center tweeted that, “this activity is not\n\n\nAPT10. It is all APT31 (or ZIRCONIUM) in our terms”\n(Koehl, 2019). Similarly, Kris McConkey, head of\ncyberthreat detection and response at PwC stated that\n“none of the stuff that we were tracking as APT10\noverlaps with what Recorded Future and Rapid7 have\nreported” (Lyngaas, 2019a). Sean Lyngaas over at\nCyberscoop summarized the issue neatly by\nhighlighting that these attribution differences happen\nquite regularly and that the lack of a standard\nnomenclature to summarize patterns of unique\ncharacteristics is a problem for identifying new threat\nactors (Lyngaas, 2019a). As of this writing the\nattribution debate in this case has not been resolved.\n\n**ChChes: On January 26, 2017, the Japan**\nComputer Emergency Response Team Coordination\nCenter (JP-CERT) reported the discovery of a new\nmalware/backdoor called ChChes, which was used in a\ncampaign against Japanese organizations since around\nOctober 2016 (Nakamura, 2017). In February, Palo Alto\nNetwork’s Unit 42 confirmed that the campaign\ntargeted “Japanese academics working in several areas\nof science, along with Japanese pharmaceutical and a\nUS-based subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturing\norganizations” (Miller-Osborn & Grunzweig, 2017). Palo\nAlto also additionally explained that “the ChChes\nsamples […] were digitally signed using a certificate\noriginally used by HackingTeam and later part of the\ndata leaked when they [HackingTeam] were\nthemselves hacked” (Miller-Osborn & Grunzweig,\n2017). [15] In July 2017 researchers at Trend Micro\nconnected ChChes to APT10 by noting that, “we first\nsaw ChChes set its sights on an organization that’s long\nbeen a target of APT 10/menuPass. […] ChChes also\nresembles another backdoor, Emdivi, which first made\nwaves in 2014. […] In one instance, we detected PlugX\nand Emdivi on the same machine. This PlugX variant\nconnected to an APT 10/menuPass-owned domain, but\nthe packer is similar to that used by ChChes. While it’s\npossible it was hit by two different campaigns, further\nanalysis told a different story. Both were compiled on\nthe same date, only several hours apart” (Sy et al.,\n2017). It is highly likely that ChChes is not a new APT\ngroup, but an APT10 sub-team.\n\n15 HackingTeam is an Italian, Milan-based company specializing in\n“offensive solutions for cyber investigations.” HT was breached in\nJuly 2015 with more than 400GB of internal files dumped into the\npublic domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Blue Termite/CloudyOmega/EMDIVI**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: various Emdivi versions;, Uppercut (ANEL), Korplug,\nand ZXshell backdoors; self-build logon.exe (see: Tomonaga &\nNakamura, 2015, slide. 25); usp10jpg; BeginX (remote shell tool)\nWidely available: Various; Mimikatz/Quarks; PowerShell (UAC\nbypass); Htran\n\n**Targets**\nJapan: Governmental organizations, manufacturing, financial,\nchemical, satellite, media, medical, food, and education\norganizations.\n\nIn August 2015, Kaspersky’s GReAT team\nreleased a blogpost on a new threat actor dubbed Blue\nTermite, which was running a cyberespionage\ncampaign against “hundreds of organizations in Japan”\nsince at least 2012 (Kaspersky Lab, 2015). Among other\ncharacteristics, Blue Termite stood out due to their\nusage of a zero-day Flash exploit and “a sophisticated\nbackdoor, which [was] customized for each victim.” As\nthe team noted, “this was the first campaign known to\nKaspersky Lab that [was] strictly focused on Japanese\ntargets” (Kaspersky Lab, 2015).\n\nSpeaking at Code Blue in October 2015, Shusei\nTomonaga and Yuu Nakamaura over JP-CERT’s analysis\ncenter, provided a detailed presentation on the Blue\nTermite campaign. Among other items, they explained\nthat (a) the Emdivi malware used was repeatedly\nupgraded, (b) in some cases, the targeted\norganization’s proxy server address was hard-coded,\nand that (c) each Emdivi version possibly only ran on\nspecific computers (encryption of data by computer\nSID) (Tomonaga & Nakamura, 2015, slide 37).\nAccording to Trend Micro, Emdivi appeared first in\n2014 and is the most used remote access tool\nleveraged against targets in Japan (Arai, 2015).\n\nSymantec conducted its own investigation into\nBlue Termite’s activity, which the company identified\nas Operation CloudyOmega in November 2014. In\ncontrast to Kaspersky, Symantec started to look into\nCloudyOmega’s activity because the group exploited a\nzero-day in the popular Japanese word processing\nsoftware Ichitaro. Further investigation revealed that\n“the attack was in fact part of an ongoing\ncyberespionage campaign specifically targeting various\nJapanese organization. […] variants of Backdoor.Emdivi\nare persistently used as payload” (Symantec, 2014).\n\nIn terms of attribution, Kaspersky states that\n“the graphic user interface of the Command and\nControl server as well as some technical documents\nrelated to the malware used in the Blue Termite\noperation are written in Chinese” (Kaspersky Lab,\n2015). Presenting at the 28[th] Annual First Conference in\nSeoul in June 2016, Kakumaru et al. observed that (1)\n97% of IP addresses possibly used by Blue\nTermite/CloudyOmega, were assigned by an ISP in\n\n\nShanghai; (2) The group also made a mistake in one of\ntheir attacks which exposed a one hour time difference\nbetween the attacker’s local time and Japanese\nStandard Time; And (3) the phishing documents were\nwritten in a slightly different character font than the\noriginal Japanese fonts (Kakumaru et al. 2016, slide 1723). Meanwhile, Symantec found tooling overlaps\nbetween CloudyOmega and the Chinese APT group\nHidden Lynx and the creators of the LadyBoyle\nbackdoor (backdoor.boda) (Symantec, 2014; Symantec\n2013).\n\n**Winnti group/Winnti Umbrella**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Winnti backdoor; ZxShell\nWidely available: China Chopper; Metasploit; Cobaltstrike; PlugX;\nPoisonIvy\n\n**Targets**\nGaming companies in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam,\nEurope, Russia, and the US; Pharmaceutical and telecommunication\ncompanies; Tibetan and Chinese journalists, Uyghur and Tibetan\nactivists, China-focused foreign news organizations; The\ngovernment of Thailand\n\nOn April 11, 2013, Kaspersky published its report\non the original Winnti group, which stated that “this\ngroup has been active for several years and specializes\nin cyberattacks against the online video game industry”\n(Kaspersky GReAT, 2013). In 2015, Winnti branched out\nand started pivoting into other sectors, such as\ntargeting large holdings in the telecommunication\nsection and major pharmaceutical companies. In one\ninstance it even signed a driver “with a stolen\ncertificate of a division of a huge Japanese\nconglomerate” (Tarakanov, 2015).\n\nOver the years, security vendors have connected\nWinnti infrastructure and tooling to other campaigns\nand groups, which has led MITRE’s Att&ck database to\nnote that, “some reporting suggests a number of other\ngroups, including Axiom (APT13), APT17, and Ke3chang,\nare closely linked to Winnti Group” (MITRE Att&ck,\nn.d.). Other aliases and sub-teams include LEAD,\nBarium, Wicked Panda, GREF, and PassCV (Hegel, 2018,\np. 4). Thus, nowadays, the name “Winnti” is primarily\nused to refer to a custom backdoor used by teams\nunder the Winnti umbrella. On May 3, 2018,\nProtectWise 401TRG “assesse[d] with high confidence\nthat the Winnti umbrella is associated with the Chinese\nstate intelligence apparatus, with at least some\nelements located in the Xicheng District in Beijing”\n(Hegel, 2018, p. 3).\n\nIn terms of behavior, Winnti stands out for\nsimple operational security mistakes. As one source\nexplained to German broadcaster BR, “these hackers\ndon’t care if they’re found out or not. They care only\nabout achieving their goals\" (Tanriverdi et al., 2019).\nThis characteristic stands in stark contrast to other\n\n\n-----\n\nChinese ATP teams which notably try to hide and cover\nup their involvements.\n\nAccording to Zhang and Ortolani over at Lastline,\n“no new [Winnti] campaign has been publicly reported\nafter the one targeting German Pharmaceutical\ncompanies in April 2019” (Zhang & Ortolani, 2019). On\nDecember 6, 2019, the German Federal Office for the\nProtection of the Constitution (BfV) released – for the\nfirst time ever - a 19-page technical report, warning the\nGerman private sector of the Winnti threat. According\nto the report, the group started targeting German\ncompanies back in 2016, and the BfV currently assumes\nthat Winnti is conducting a wave of persistent attacks\nagainst the German economy (BfV 2019, p. 2).\n\n##### 5.4 Contractors\n\nThis sub-section lists three Chinese APT threat\nactors that have targeted Japan assets, but so far have\nnot been directly linked to any of the aforementioned\ngroups. They are most likely Chinese contractors\nworking for the PLA or the MSS in one way or another.\n\n**Dust Storm**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Misdat backdoor (2010-2011); Mis-type hybrid\nbackdoor (2012); S-type backdoor (2013-2014); ZLIB backdoor\n(2014-2015); Specially crafted HLP files; Several zero-days (CVE2011-0611, CVE-2012-1889, CVE-2014-0322, and maybe CVE 20135990)\nWidely available: Poison Ivy, Gh0st RAT\n\n**Targets**\nPrior to 2015: Government and defense-related intelligence targets\n(incl. US defense companies and Uyghur mailing lists)\nSince 2015: Japanese critical infrastructure, including electricity\ngeneration, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and\nconstruction companies. Also, subdivisions of larger foreign\norganizations\n\nIn February 2016, Cylance released a report on a\nlong-standing persistent threat it dubbed Operation\nDust Storm - which has been active since at least 2010.\nWhile Cylance has not attributed any group or\nindividuals to the Dust Storm campaign, it did highlight\n“a fairly large lull in activity from March -August 2013”\n(Gross, 2016, p. 4). This coincides with APT1’s\ndownturn after Mandiant released its report on APT1 in\nFebruary 2013. Other breadcrumbs that point toward a\nChinese-based APT are the group’s past use of “public\nRATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st Rat,” as well as their\ntargeting of US defense companies and the Chinese\nUyghur ethnic minority (Gross, 2016, p. 2-4).\n\nIn 2015, Dust Storm veered away from\ntraditional government and defense-related\nintelligence targets and migrated to “seek out\norganizations involved in Japanese critical\ninfrastructure and resources” (Gross, 2016, p. 1). By\n2016 it almost entirely shifted to “specifically and\n\n\nexclusively target Japanese companies or Japanese\nsubdivisions of larger foreign organizations” (Gross,\n2016, p. 1). The group also “adopted and eventually\ncustomized several Android backdoors,” and “rapidly\nexpanded their mobile operations in May 2015” (Gross,\n2016, p. 6).\n\nSadly, Cylance also explained that “as the group\nbecame more and more focused on Japan, less and less\nof their tactics and malware appeared in reports or\nwrite-ups” (Gross, 2016, p. 6). As far as open source is\nconcerned, no vendor has published any major report\non Dust Storm since.\n\nNote: Some APT reports view Dust Storm as an\nAPT10 campaign. To this author it is unclear on what\ninformation this attribution assessment is based on.\nMITRE for example categorizes Dust Storm separate\nfrom APT10, while Thales’ Cyberthreat Handbook\nidentifies Dust Storm as APT10’s first major campaign\never (Thales & Verint, p. 38).\n\n**Stalker Panda**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: ?\nWidely available: Elirks, SharpServer, Blogspot RAT, XUni,\nPowerShell scripts\n\n**Targets**\nPrimarily political, media, and engineering sectors in Japan, Taiwan,\nHong Kong, and the US\n\nVery few public reports have been published on\nthe group known as Stalker Panda. The most important\ndocument is an analysis written by Raytheon in August\n2015 and published by WikiLeaks as part of the CIA’s\nVault 7 leak in March 2017.\n\nAccording to Raytheon, “[Stalker Panda] appears\nto have close ties to the Chinese National University of\nDefense and Technology, which is possibly linked to the\nPLA. Stalker Panda has been observed conducting\ntargeted attacks against Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and\nthe United States. The attacks appear to be centered\non political, media, and engineering sectors. The group\nappears to have been active since around 2010 and\nthey maintain and upgrade their tools regularly”\n(Raytheon, 2015, p. 1).\n\nWhile CrowdStrike additionally notes, that\nStalker Panda ”is linked to BlogSpotRAT activity\ntargeting Japan in June 2017” (CrowdStrike, 2018, p.\n26), Raytheon clearly highlights that “there is nothing\ninteresting, unique, or sophisticated about the Blogspot\nRAT” (Raytheon, 2015, p. 1).\n\nMaybe – and this is just speculation on the\nauthors part – Stalker Panda is a team comprised of\nChinese PLA students, rather than staffed by\nprofessional PLA operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Icefog/Dagger Panda**\n\n**Tooling**\nSeveral variants of the Icefog backdoor (Fucobha), HLP files, HWP\nexploits, CVE-2012-1856 and CVE2012-0158\n\n**Targets**\nPrimarily Japan and South Korea: government institutions, military\ncontractors, maritime and shipbuilding groups, telecom operators,\nindustrial and high-tech companies, and media outlets.\n\nIcefog was a Chinese APT threat actor that was\nactive between 2011 and 2014. According to Kaspersky\nit primarily focused on targets in Japan and South\nKorea, including “governmental institutions, military\ncontractors, maritime and shipbuilding groups, telecom\noperators, industrial and high-tech companies and\nmass media” (Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 3). What made\nIcefog stand out at the time were its hit-and-run\ntactics. Meaning, the group avoided long-term\npersistence within a network. It knew what it wanted\nfrom a victim and abandoned the target as soon as they\nhad what they came for. Some analyst therefore\nassume that Icefog were mercenaries for hire (Mimoso,\n2013).\n\nMinor convergence with APT1: Icefog liked to\nuse HLP files to infect their targets. Those HLP files did\nnot contain any exploits, but abused certain Windows\nfeatures to drop malware. As Kaspersky’s GReAT team\nexplains, “it’s interesting to know that Icefog is not the\nonly crew to heavily use HLP ‘exploits’ as part of their\ntoolkit. Well known, very effective APT like the\nComment Crew/APT1 have included the HLP trick in\ntheir kits, along with other lesser known crews”\n(Kaspersky Lab, 2013, p. 10).\n\nIn June 2019, senior FireEye researcher, Chi-en\n(Ashley) Shen, showed that since 2014, several new\nand updated Icefog malware strains were shared\namong numerous threat actors - including Roaming\nTiger, APT15, Temp Group A, and suspected APT9 – to\nhit targets in Europe, Russia, and Central Asia (Shen,\n2019). Shen warned that, “shared malware is a pitfall\nfor attribution, we should not do attribution only based\non malware” (Shen, 2019). Overall, it seems that Icefog\nfollowed the same trajectory as Winnti. Once\nexclusively used by one Chinese APT, new versions of\nthe malware are now “shared among many different\nAPTs, each with its own agenda” (Cimpanu, 2019b).\n\n\n##### 5.5 Unsorted\n\nThis section lists the most prominent Chinese\nthreat actors that have targeted Japanese entities, but\nhave so far not been identified as being part of, or\ncontractually connected to the PLA or the MSS. Minor\nChinese APTs targeting Japan that are not included in\nthis non-exhaustive list are APT16, EvilPost, and Axiom\nAPT/APT17 (Hidden Lynx’s DeputyDog campaign). [16]\n\n**Tick/Bronze Butler/REDBALDKNIGHT**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Daserf, Datper, xxmm, Mimzen, SymonLoader, Gofarer\nand Homamdownloader\nWidely available: Mimikatz, gsecdump\n\n**Targets**\nPrimarily Japan and South Korea: government agencies; companies\nin the biotechnology, electronics manufacturing, and industrial\nchemistry sector; media and broadcasting organizations\n\nThe Tick espionage group has been active since\nat least 2006, and most likely originates in the People’s\nRepublic of China (DiMaggio, 2016a). While Trick\nprimarily targets Japan and South Korea with its own\ncustom developed malware (Daserf), it has also\nsporadically hit organizations in Russia, Singapore, and\neven China itself.\n\nAccording to Secureworks, The group is “able to\ncraft phishing emails in native Japanese and operating\nsuccessfully within a Japanese language environment”\n(Secureworks, 2017). It has also demonstrated the\nability to identify a significant zero-day vulnerability\nwithin a popular Japanese corporate tool and then use\nscan-and-exploit techniques to indiscriminately\ncompromise Japanese internet-facing enterprise\nsystems. […] It has remained undetected in several\ncompromised networks for up to five years”\n(Secureworks, 2017).\n\nTick stands out from the APT crowd in many\ndifferent ways. The group is “highly selective in its\napproach and only appears to deploy its full range of\ntools once it establishes that the compromised\norganization is an intended target” (DiMaggio, 2016a).\nIt “frequently use[s] either privacy protection services\nor domain brokers to mask registration information.\nThese tactics are used to make discovery and\nattribution more difficult” (DiMaggio, 2016a). It was\nalso one of the few initial groups that leveraged\nsteganography within their attacks. Trend Micro\ndescribed one use case by explaining that, “a\ndownloader will be installed on the victim’s machine\nand retrieve Daserf from a compromised site. Daserf\nwill then connect to another compromised site and\ndownload an image file (i.e., .JPG, .GIF). The image is\nembedded in either the encrypted backdoor\n\n16 For more information on APT16 & EvilPost see: Kaspersky GReAT,\n2016; On DeputyDog see: Christopher Ahlberg, 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\nconfigurations or hacking tool. After their decryption,\nDaserf will connect to its C&C and await further\ncommands” (Chen & Hsieh, 2017).\n\nCuriously, in 2018, Palo Alto Network’s Unit 42\nalso discovered that Tick weaponized secure USB drives\nin an older campaign to specifically target air-gapped\ncomputers running out-of-support Windows systems.\nWhile Unit 42 has no information on any active targets,\nit did note that “air-gapped systems are common\npractice in many countries for government, military,\nand defense contractors, as well as other industry\nverticals“ (Hayashi & Harbison, 2018).\n\n**DragonOK**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: FormerFirstRAT; Upheart RAT; custom Sysget malware\nvariants (version 2 and 3); updated IsSpace version (Nflog variant)\nWidely available: PoisonIvy; Nflog; Mongall; CR, NewCT; TidePool;\nPowerShell; PlugX; HTran\n\n**Targets**\nJapan: Manufacturing, energy, and technology companies; Higher\neducation institutions.\nTaiwan: Manufacturing and technology companies\nAlso: Seeking out victims in Tibet and Russia.\n\nIn September 2014, FireEye identified “two\ndistinct campaigns originating from different\ngeographic regions in China using similar tools,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs)” (Haq et al., 2014, p.\n3). FireEye named the first group Moafee (after their\ncommand and control infrastructure), and the second\ngroup DragonOK (after an event name in one of their\npayload executables). Moafee operated out of the\nGuangdong province (HTran backend server location)\nand targeted governments and military organizations\nwith national interests in the South China Sea.\nDragonOK meanwhile appeared to operate out of\nJiangsu province (HTran backend server location) with a\nfocused interest for technology and manufacturing\ncompanies located in Japan and Taiwan (Haq et al.,\n2014, p. 17-19).\n\nIn April 2015, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42\nidentified a new DragonOK backdoor (called\nFormerFirstRAT) that was deployed against Japanese\ntargets in at least five phishing campaigns. According to\nthe blogpost “all five phishing campaigns targeted a\nJapanese manufacturing firm over the course of two\nmonths, but the final campaign also targeted a\nseparate Japanese high-tech organization” (MillerOsborn & Grunzweig, 2015).\n\nIn January 2017, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42\nobserved a number of attacks by DragonOK against\nindividuals and organizations in Japan and Taiwan, but\nalso against targets in Tibet and Russia (Grunzweig,\n2017). Unit 42 summarized its findings by highlighting\nthat “the DragonOK group are quite active and\ncontinue updating their tools and tactics. Their toolset\nis being actively developed to make detection and\n\n\nanalysis more difficult. Additionally, they appear to be\nusing additional malware toolsets such as TidePool”\n(Grunzweig, 2017).\n\nIn June 2017, government servers in Cambodia\nwere targeted by a new remote access Trojan dubbed\nKHRAT. In an article by The Phnom Penh Post, Phnom\nPenh-based cybersecurity researcher Niklas\nFemerstrand is quoted as saying that “the DragonOK\ncampaign has previously targeted organizations in\nTaiwan, Japan, Tibet and Russia, and political\norganizations in Cambodia since at least January, 2017”\n(Sassoon & Taing). On October 27, 2017, Ryan Olsen,\nDirector of Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks,\nwas interviewed on the cyberwire podcast on the\nspecific topic of the KHRAT. According to Olsen,\n“[KHRAT] is a malware tool--that's a Remote Access\nTool or a Remote Access Trojan, depending on your\nterminology--that we associate with a group that's\ncalled DragonOK” (Bittner, 2017).[17]\n\n**Budminer/Taidoor**\n\n**Tooling**\nProprietary: Dripion custom backdoor; Blugger downloader\nWidely available: Taidoor Trojan\n\n**Taidoor Trojan connected Targets**\nSince 2008 (Taidoor trojan): government agencies; media, financial,\ntelecom and manufacturing sectors in Taiwan, Japan, US, South\nKorea (Doherty & Krysiuk, n.d.).\nSince 2011: (Taidoor Trojan): shifted to target think tanks\n(Symantec, 2012b)\nSince 2015 (Dripion backdoor): Taiwan, Brazil, US (DiMaggio, 2016b)\n\nOpen source information is sparse on the\nBudminer APT. The Symantec website only returns two\nsearch hits on the group, and neither MISP nor MITRE\nlist Budminer among any of their APT groups.\n\nSymantec stumbled upon Budminer in August\n2015 when it received three file hashes that had “the\nfunctionality of a back door with information stealing\ncapabilities.” The malware also appeared to be “new,\nrarely detected, and not publicly available,” leading\nSymantec to realize that it was custom-developed\nmalware they termed Dripion. Meaning, there was a\nvery high likelihood that Dripion was tied to a\ncyberespionage campaign.\n\nThe downloader was identified as Blugger,\nwhich is not publicly available and has only been seen\nused by China-based threat actors. As DiMaggio noted,\n“this is the first time we have seen Blugger used to\ndeliver malware other than Taidoor” (DiMaggio,\n2016b).\n\nTaidoor meanwhile is a malware that has been\nused in many other cyberespionage campaigns since at\n\n17 Note: Although often linked to in most of the reporting on the\nKHRAT-DragonOK connection, the Palo Alto’s write-up on KHAT of\nAugust 2017 (Hinchliffe & Miller-Osborn, 2017) does in fact not\nmention DragonOK at all.\n\n\n-----\n\nleast 2008. Further investigation uncovered that “one\nof the Blugger samples associated with Dripion\nconnected with a root domain also used in Taidoorrelated activity” against targets in Taiwan, Japan, South\nKorea, and the US (DiMaggio, 2016b). According to a\n2019 report by Macnica Networks, Taidoor was\nextensively used against Japanese telecommunication\ncompanies (including telecommunication hardware\nmanufacturers) between the end of 2017 and June\n2018. The report speculates that the Taidoor attacks\nwere aimed at obtaining personal customer and\ninfrastructure information for future operations\n(Macnica Networks, 2019, p. 8).\n\nNote: Given the sparse sourcing, it is\nnot clear to this author when Budminer was first\nidentified. None of Symantec’s extensive write-ups on\nTaidoor ever mention the group, and none of the other\nmajor security vendors seem to have designated an\nAPT based on the Dripion backdoor, Blugger use, and\nTaidoor connection. It is also unclear as to how\nextensive Budminer is connected to the overall Taidoor\ndeployments against Japanese targets.\n\n\n#### 6 Effects\n\n##### 6.1 Social effects\n\nSince the MHI breach in 2011, the Japanese\ngovernment has made increasing efforts to change the\ncyber security culture in Japan. While the country is still\nstruggling with non-transparent incident reporting and\na perception that admitting to a breach is a sign of\nweakness and shame, there have been noticeable\nchanges in attitude (Phneah, 2013).\n\nIn 2011, Japanese government officials were\nfurious when they learned of the MHI breach through\nthe media rather than the company reporting the\nincident immediately to the Ministry of Defense. Given\nthat this was the first publicly known case of a Japanese\ndefense contractor having been breached, one could –\nwith a large stretch of imagination - argue that MHI\nwas simply not familiar with the reporting mechanisms\nor did not deem the incident relevant enough to\nactivate it. Then minister of defense Yasuo Ichikawa put\nit most diplomatically by stating that “the ministry has\nbusiness ties with the company, so we will instruct it to\nreview its information control systems” (McCurry,\n2011). According to the New York Times, the MHI\nbreach also fueled concerns in Washington on whether\nTokyo is able to handle delicate information. As the\nTimes explained, the MHI breach came “less than two\nweeks after a Japanese air traffic controller was\nquestioned for posting American flight information on\nhis blog” – including detailed flight plans for Air Force\nOne and data on a US military reconnaissance drone\n(Tabuchi, 2011).\n\nDespite MHI’s assertions that no confidential\ninformation was exfiltrated, the Asahi Shimbun\nreported on October 24, that the attackers “likely\nnetted military data on warplanes and information on\nnuclear power plants” (Reuters, 2011). To date it\nremains unclear whether sensitive defense information\nwas leaked.\n\nIn contrast to the MHI’s public relations fiasco,\nthe breach of the Japanese Pension Service (JPS) in May\n2015 was discernably different. Between May 8 and\nMay 20, 2015, the JPS received 124 suspicious emails\nthat infected five computers and spread to 26 others.\nIn the period of May 21-23, the data of approximately\n1.25 million enrolled citizens was exfiltrated. On May\n28, the infections were discovered, and on June 1 the\nJPS apologized in a televised press conference for\nhaving been breached. According to the JPS statement,\nthey immediately reported the incident to the police\nand requested an investigation, hired an anti-virus\ncompany to analyze and contain the malware, and\nblocked all JPS network connections to the internet\n(JPS, 2015, p. 2). In addition, JPS also set up a system to\ninform each customer individually on whether their\n\n\n-----\n\ndata was affected, and set up a hotline for reporting\nany suspicious phishing activities related to customer\npension information (JPS, 2015, p. 2). According to the\nMainichi Shimbun, the Metropolitan Police Department\n(MPD)'s Public Security Bureau investigated the case\nbut was stymied by the culprit’s use of Tor (Kanamori,\n2018). Three years after the breach – on May 20, 2018 Japanese law enforcement officially closed the criminal\ninvestigation without any results. To date none of the\nrecords exfiltrated from the JPS have been used for\nmalicious purposes. In the aftermath of the JPS breach,\nthe active sharing of indicators of compromise led\nnumerous other companies and government agencies\nto report similar breaches in their networks.\n\nDespite the JPS ‘success’ story, the norm still\nseems to be that after each incident, Japanese\ngovernment officials first reassure the public that no\nconfidential information was leaked, and then walk\nback their statements because the investigation either\nshowed otherwise, or the affected agency/company\nhas no idea what was actually lost. Similarly, it is quite\ndisturbing to note that the more narrowly focused an\nattacker is on Japan, the less and less technical\ninformation becomes publicly available on the attacker.\nMeaning, communicating with the Japanese public and\nthe global security community at large still seems to be\na very low priority for Japanese security vendors,\ncompanies, and government agencies alike (Gross,\n2016, p. 6).\n\nFitting into this gaping hole of public relations\nbuilding was the appointed of Yoshitaka Sakurada to\nthe post of deputy chief of the government’s\ncybersecurity strategy office. Sakurada inevitable\nachieved global fame in November 2018 when he\nadmitted in the Japanese Parliament that he never\nused a computer in his professional life and\n“appear[ed] confused by the concept of a USB drive”\n(McCurry, 2018). As opposition lawmaker Masato Imai\npointedly put it, “it’s unbelievable that someone who\nhas not touched computers is responsible for\ncybersecurity policies” (McCurry, 2018).\n\nThe preparations for the Tokyo Olympics in\n2020 have nonetheless discernably impacted the\ngovernment’s motivation to pro-actively secure Japan\nin cyberspace. In fact, the Japanese government has\ntaken the unusual step of allowing the Japanese\nNational Institute for Information and Communications\nTechnology (NICT) to run dictionary attacks against the\ncountry’s 200 million Internet of Things devices starting\nin February 2019. [18] While the overall purpose of this\n\n18 Dictionary attacks: A brute-force attack based on selecting\npotential passwords from a pre-prepared list. The attacker creates a\n“dictionary” of the most likely sequences of characters and uses a\nmalicious program to check them all in turn in the hope of finding a\nmatch. A special type of dictionary attack uses a list of possible\npassword templates and automatically generates a variable\n\n\n‘campaign’ is to collect data for a survey on default and\neasy-to-guess device passwords, the government’s plan\nalso includes measures to alert vulnerable customers\nand help them to secure their devices (Cimpanu,\n2019a).\n\nApart from these broader security issues, there\nare still numerous attack vectors that remain unique to\nJapan. Kaoru Hayashi over at Palo Alto Network’s Unit\n42, highlighted one curious case in his blog post on July\n24, 2017, involving the Tick group. According to\nHayashi, “many Japanese companies introduced a file\nencryption system for secure data exchange over\nemail. The system encrypts documents with a userspecified password and often creates a self-extracting\n(SFX) file for ease of decrypting the file to recipients.\nWhen sending the SFX file with a password by email,\nsenders usually rename the file extension from .exe to\nsomething else to avoid blocking or detecting the\nattachment by an email gateway or security product”\n(Hayashi, 2017). For an adversary that knows how\nJapanese enterprise users exchange these emails it is a\nvery easy task to craft a spear phishing email that\nexploit this attack vector.\n\n##### 6.2 Economic effects\n\nIt is not clear what actual effects the cyberrelated incidents attributed to Chinese threat actors\nhad on the Japanese economy. While there are a few\npublicly available figures on remediation costs - such as\nthe JPS breach standing at roughly $8 million USD - and\non the quantity of exfiltrated sensitive documents,\nquantifying these damages in a reliable manner is not\npossible.\n\nTo a certain degree Japan’s unique threat\nlandscape has been impacting the country’s economy\neach year around September 18 - the anniversary of\nthe Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese invasion\nof Manchuria and the establishment of the puppet\nstate of Manchukuo. While Chinese nationalist\nhacktivist have been mobilizing DDoS attacks and\ndefacements against Japanese targets in September\nrather regularly over the past decade, activity has\nnotably settled down over recent years. Despite this\ntrend, the Japanese ISP provider Internet Initiative\nJapan rightfully warns that “some [Chinese] cyber\nattacks are linked to real-life historical events and carry\na historical context, so it is necessary to pay attention\nto political and social situations such as historically\nsignificant dates and current international affairs”\n(Saito, 2016, p. 5).\n\ncomponent. For example, based on information about the victim’s\nname, an attacker can test the password denisXXX, substituting XXX\nfor the numbers 001 to 999 (see: Kaspersky IT Encyclopedia, n.d.)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 6.3 Technological effects\n\nThe onslaught of Chinese attacks against\nJapanese infrastructure has in part forced the Abe\ngovernment to outsource the MoD’s development of\noffensive cyber capabilities to one or several unnamed\nprivate Japanese companies in 2019 (Tokyo-np, 2019).\nWhile there are certainly legal hurdles that will still\nhave to be pushed aside, the Japanese government\nalready tried to outsource the development of a ‘seek\nand destroy’ malware to Fujitsu back in 2012 (Leyden,\n2012). Open sources are not entirely clear as to\nwhether the Fujitsu malware failed to produce the\nexpected results or why exactly the product was\nshelved in end. It is anyone’s best guess how the 2019\nplan will work out. According to the Japan Times, the\ndelivery date for the offensive cyber capability is set for\nMarch 2020 (Japan Times, 2019).\n\nIn terms of the heaps of documents that were\nexfiltrated by Chinese APTs over the years from every\nindustrial sector in Japan, it is unclear as to how or\nwhether they benefitted companies and research\ninstitutions in China. Quantifying this impact would\nnecessitate insights into what documents were stolen,\nhow they were disseminated in China, and whether\nthey were actual useful. No such assessment can be\nmade in this report.\n\n##### 6.4 International effects\n\nOn December 21, 2018, the Japanese Ministry of\nForeign Affairs joined the Five Eyes’ collective public\nattribution effort on APT10. According to the statement\nby Press Secretary Takeshi Osuga, “Japan has identified\ncontinuous attacks by the group known as APT10 to\nvarious domestic targets including private companies\nand academic institutions and expresses resolute\ncondemnation of such attacks. […] Japan will continue\nto closely cooperate with the international community\nand make efforts in order to ensure a free, fair and\nsecure cyberspace” (MOFA, 2018). It is important to\nnote that, apart from the Five Eyes, Japan was the only\ncountry that released a written statement. The\nNetherlands, Finland, Sweden, and Demark merely\ntweeted their support, while the German government\nonly comment on APT10 when a government\nspokesperson was specifically asked by a journalist at\nthe Federal Press Conference on Dec 21.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs continues to argue that Beijing has nothing to\ndo with APT10, noting on December 21 that, “the U.S.\nside making unwarranted criticisms of China in the\nname of so-called ‘cyber stealing’ is blaming others\nwhile oneself is to be blamed, and is self-deception.\nChina absolutely cannot accept this” (Wen, 2018).\n\n\nGiven the concerns of industrial espionage at\nhome and Beijing’s global ambitions abroad, the\nJapanese Ministry of Telecommunications also\neffectively blocked Huawei and ZTE from competing in\nJapan’s 5G infrastructure build-up by allocating the 5G\nspectrum to Japanese telecommunications companies\nupon the condition that they “take sufficient\ncybersecurity measures including responding to supply\nchain risk” (Nussey & Shida, 2019). Japan’s ban\nessentially follows similar policies enacted in 2018 by\nthe US, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nIn the context of the US-Japan military alliance,\nUS Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo stated on April 19,\n2019 that, \"the United States and Japan affirmed that\ninternational law applies in cyberspace and that a\ncyberattack could, in certain circumstances, constitute\nan armed attack under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan\nSecurity Treaty. We stressed the need to work together\nto protect classified information, maintain\ntechnological superiority, and preserve our shared\ndefense and economic advantages from theft and\nexploitation\" (Pompeo, 2019). As of this writing it is\nunclear whether Tokyo has negotiated any special\narrangements with Washington within the context of\npersistent engagement/defending forward.[19]\n\n19 For a description of persistent engagement see: US Cyber\nCommand, 2018, p. 6\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 7 Future Outlook\n\nBeijing has a clearly defined grand strategy in\ncyberspace, covering everything from ‘informatization’\nand state-sovereignty to techno-nationalism and cyberdefense. Japan in contrast, has not yet articulated any\ngrand ambitions to define its place in the world of\ntomorrow, nor how it will defend itself in and across\ncyberspace against an increasingly assertive China.\n\nIf the Japanese government is able and willing to\nsignificantly overhaul its defense policy and\nconstitutional maneuverability – and maybe even\nattempt to walk in lock-step with the US strategy of\npersistent engagement – we might witness an intense\ncompetition between Tokyo and Beijing in cyberspace.\nIf however the Japanese government is unable to turn\naround the current one-sided onslaught, then Tokyo\nmight become a liability to US alliance cooperation,\nintelligence sharing, and possibly even power\nprojection across the Indo-Pacific over time.\n\nIn the long run, it is highly likely that Tokyo will\nnot to be able to merely hedge its alliance\ncommitments through the modernization of its\nconventional military assets. Japan’s military absence in\nthe cyber domain will be felt in Washington one way or\nthe other.\n\nFor Beijing the primary challenge in the short\nterm is to push hard against any signs that US Cyber\nCommand is operationally applying persistent\nengagement in the Indo-Pacific. Meaning, Beijing has to\nwalk a tight rope between, on the one hand, continuing\nits industrial- and military espionage against Japanese\nfirms and government agencies. While on the other\nhand, staying clear of any activities that could even\nremotely undermine Japan’s democratic discourse,\npush Tokyo into militarizing cyber space, or heighten\nconcerns in Washington to such a degree that it will\nforce US Cyber Command to pay significant attention to\nthe Indo-Pacific.\n\nIn the long run, Beijing’s will most likely seek to\nsignificantly undermine the trust relationship between\nTokyo and Washington. Depending on the relative\nintelligence gains that Beijing can extract from Tokyo\nover time, China might run the Russian playbook on\ninformation warfare against Japan in the not so distant\nfuture.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 8 Abbreviations\n\n|A2/AD|Anti-Access/Area Denial|\n|---|---|\n|AFB|Air Force Base|\n|APT|Advanced Persistent Threat|\n|ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian
