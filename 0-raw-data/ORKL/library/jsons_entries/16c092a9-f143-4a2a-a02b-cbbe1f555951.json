The malware allows\nthe attacker to connect the compromised computer to a botnet and control it remotely.\n\nThe malware is a modified version of a publicly available backdoor named GoBot2. The\nmodifications to the source code are mainly South Korea-specific evasion techniques,\nwhich are described in detail in this blogpost. Due to the campaign’s clear focus on South\nKorea, we have dubbed this Win64/GoBot2 variant GoBotKR.\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, GoBotKR has been active since March 2018. The detections\nare in the hundreds, with South Korea being the most affected (80%), followed by China\n(10%) and Taiwan (5%).\n\n## Distribution\n\nGoBotKR has been spreading via South Korean and Chinese torrent sites, masquerading\nas Korean movies and TV shows, as well as some games.\n\nThe attackers behind this campaign try to trick users into executing the malware by boobytrapping the contents of the torrents with malicious files that have deceptive filenames,\nextensions and icons. Our analysis shows that the torrents using a movie/TV show disguise\ngenerally contain the following types of files:\n\n1. The expected MP4 file\n[2. A malicious executable masked as a PMA archive file with a filename mimicking](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/PMA)\n\nvarious codec installers\n3. A malicious LNK file with a filename and icon mimicking the expected video file\n\nFigure 1 shows examples of torrent contents from this malicious campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Contents of some torrents delivering the malware (the MP4 video is not displayed on the_\n\n_second screenshot); the malware is executed by an LNK file with a deceptive filename and icon_\n\nSo how exactly do users get compromised?\n\nDirectly opening the intended MP4 file will not result in any malicious action. The catch here\nis that the MP4 file is often hidden in a different directory, and users might encounter the\nmalicious LNK file mimicking it first. Further increasing the chance of users falling for the\nlure is the fact that the extension of the LNK file is normally not displayed when viewed in\nWindows Explorer, as seen in the second screenshot in Figure 1, in the file with the Korean\nname.\n\nClicking on the deceptive LNK file executes the malware. However, it also opens the\nintended file (in this case a video), giving victims little reason to suspect something has\ngone wrong.\n\nRenaming the malicious EXE file to a PMA file is also likely done to prevent raising\nsuspicion of potential victims. We have also seen this technique using games as a lure, and\nwith filenames and extensions relevant to gaming.\n\nDuring our investigation, we have seen the following filenames being used for the malicious\nexecutables: starcodec.pma, WedCodec.pma and Codec.pma (movie/TV show disguise)\nand leak.dll (game disguise). The name “starcodec” mimics the legitimate Korean codec\npack Starcodec.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Capabilities\n\nGoBotKR was built on the basis of a backdoor named GoBot2, the source code of which\nhas been publicly available since March 2017. Both the original and the modified version\nare written in [GoLang, also known as Go. While still relatively rare for malware, new](https://golang.org/)\nvariants of GoLang malware are emerging, likely due to the challenges posed to analysts\nwith the bulky nature of its compiled executables.\n\nThe functionality of GoBotKR largely overlaps with the published GoBot2 source code, with\nonly minimal modifications. Overall, the malware is not particularly complex technically, and\nthe implementation is rather straightforward. Most features are implemented with the use of\nGoLang libraries, and by executing Windows commands (such as cmd, ipconfig, netsh,\nshutdown, start, systeminfo, taskkill, ver, whoami, and wmic), and third-party utilities such\nas BitTorrent and uTorrent clients.\n\n## Collected information\n\nUltimately, the actors behind GoBotKR are building a network of bots that can then be used\n[to perform DDoS attacks of various kinds (e.g. SYN Flood,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood) [UDP Flood, or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_flood_attack) [Slowloris).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security))\nTherefore, after being executed, GoBotKR first collects system information about the\ncompromised computer, including network configuration, OS version information, CPU and\nGPU versions. In particular, it collects a list of installed antivirus software.\n\nThis information is sent to a C&C server, which helps the attackers determine which bots\nshould be used in the respective attacks. All C&C servers that we extracted from the\nanalyzed malware samples are hosted in South Korea and registered by the same person.\n\n## Bot commands\n\nOnce communication with the C&C server is established, the server instructs the\ncompromised computer with backdoor commands. GoBotKR supports fairly standard botnet\nfunctions, which mostly serve three main purposes:\n\nallowing misuse of the compromised computer\nallowing the botnet operators to control, or further extend, the botnet\nevading detection or hiding from the user\n\nThese are the supported commands:\n\ncarry out a DDoS attack on a specified victim\naccess a URL\nexecute a file, a command, a script\nupdate, terminate or uninstall itself\nshutdown/reboot/log off the computer\n\n\n-----\n\nchange homepage in IE\nchange desktop background\nseed torrents\ncopy itself to connected removable media, and setup AutoRun function\ncopy itself to public folders of cloud storage services (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google\nDrive)\nrun a reverse proxy server\nrun an HTTP server\nchange firewall settings, edit hosts file, open a port\nenable/disable Task Manager\nenable/disable Windows registry editors\nenable/disable Command Prompt\nkill a process\nhide a process window\n\nOf particular interest are two commands – seeding torrents and DDoS capability.\n\nThe “seed torrents” command allows the attackers to misuse the victimized machines for\nseeding arbitrary files using the BitTorrent and uTorrent programs, even if these are not\nalready installed on the system. This may be used as a mechanism to distribute the\nmalware further.\n\nThe “carry out a DDoS attack” command lets attackers abuse the victim’s network\nbandwidth to block the availability of targeted services, such as websites. According to our\nanalysis, this is most likely the main purpose of the GoBotKR botnet.\n\n## Evasion techniques\n\nIn this section, we explore the evasion techniques used by the GoBotKR backdoor. While\nmany techniques were already present in the publicly available source code, the authors of\nGoBotKR further expanded them with South Korea-specific features. This shows us that the\nattackers customized the malware for a specific audience, while taking extra effort to remain\nundetected in their campaign.\n\n## Techniques taken from GoBot2\n\nThe following detection evasion and anti-analysis techniques used by GoBotKR have been\nadopted from GoBot2 source code:\n\nThe malware installs two instances of itself on the system. The second instance\n(watchdog) monitors whether the first instance is still active and reinstalls it if it has\nbeen removed from the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware employs antivirus bypass techniques (it allocates large chunks of\nmemory and delays execution of the malicious payload to prevent antivirus engines\nfrom emulating the code due to resource constraints).\nThe malware can detect selected security and analytical tools, such as debuggers. If\ndetected, it terminates itself.\nThe malware terminates itself if IP information of the victim suggests one of several\nblacklisted organizations (e.g. Amazon, BitDefender, Cisco, ESET). It uses external\nlegitimate websites for querying IP information and searches for hardcoded strings in\nthis information (e.g. “cloud”, “Cisco”, “Microsoft”), rather than using API functions.\nThe malware terminates itself if its file name consists of 32 hexadecimal characters,\nwhich prevents the payload from being executed in some automated sandboxes.\n\n## South Korea-specific modifications in GoBotKR\n\nThe authors of GoBotKR added three new evasion techniques, related to their focus on\nSouth Korea:\n\nAs explained in the previous section, the malware uses IP information of the\ncompromised computer to detect whether it is running in one of the blacklisted\norganizations. In GoBot2, the IP address of the victim is determined by accessing\n[Amazon Web Services or](http://checkip.amazonaws.com/) [dnsDynamic and parsing the reply.](http://ip.dnsexit.com/)\n\nIn the samples of GoBotKR we analyzed, these URLs are replaced with South Korean\n[online platforms Naver and](https://map.naver.com/) [Daum.](https://search.daum.net/search?nil_suggest=btn&w=tot&DA=SBC&q=%EC%95%84%EC%9D%B4%ED%94%BC+%ED%99%95%EC%9D%B8)\nGoBotKR features a new evasion technique that scans running processes on the\ncompromised system to detect selected antivirus products (listed in Table 1). If any of\nthe products are detected, the malware terminates itself and removes some traces of\n[its activity from the host. The list of detected processes includes products by AhnLab,](https://global.ahnlab.com/site/main.do)\na South Korean security company.\n\n**Process name substring** **Associated company/product**\n\nV3Lite AhnLab, V3 Internet Security\n\nV3Clinic AhnLab, V3 Internet Security\n\nRwVnSvc AhnLab Anti-Ransomware Tool\n\nKsde Kaspersky\n\nkavsvc Kaspersky\n\navp Kaspersky\n\nAvast Avast\n\nMcUICnt McAfee\n\n\n-----\n\n**Process name substring** **Associated company/product**\n\n360 360 Total Security\n\nkxe Kingsoft Antivirus\n\nkwsprotect Kingsoft Internet Security\n\nBitDefender BitDefender\n\nAvira Avira\n\nByteFence ByteFence\n\n_Table 1. List of security products detected by GoBotKR_\n\nThe malware tries to detect analytical tools running on the system. It terminates itself\nif any of them are detected. The list is internally named “ahnNames”, which might be\nanother reference to AhnLab.\n\n_Figure 2. The malware’s blacklist of running processes is internally named “ahnNames”_\n\nIn addition to the AhnLab references, the defensive techniques described in the second and\nthird points were added into the source code as a file named AhnLab.go, according to the\nmetadata we obtained from the malware.\n\n## Timeline\n\nBecause the malware is spreading via torrents, a lot of the samples are broken or\nincomplete. We were, however, able to recover C&C servers and internal version\ninformation.\n\nSince the malware was first seen, we have detected samples with internal versions 2.0, 2.3,\n2.4, and 2.5. Each of these versions comes with some minor technical improvements or\ndifferences in implementation. The versioning differs from that used in the GoBot2 source\ncode, where an internal name “ArchDuke” is used.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 2 lists the different versions of GoBotKR detected by ESET systems from May 2018\nto the time of writing. The timeline features the malware’s internal versioning and detection\ndates, as PE timestamps have been cleared from the samples.\n\n\n**First**\n**seen**\n\nMay\n2018\n\nJul\n2018\n\nAug\n2018\n\nSep\n2018\n\nSep\n2018\n\nSep\n2018\n\nSep\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJan\n2019\n\n\n**Internal**\n**version**\n\n\n**Functionality linked to**\n**South Korea** **C&C server**\n\n\n2.0 No https://jtbcsupport[.]site:7777/\n\n2.0 Yes https://jtbcsupport[.]site:7777/\n\n2.0 Yes https://higamebit[.]com:6446/\n\n2.3 Yes https://kingdomain[.]site:6556/\n\n2.3 Yes https://bitgamego[.]com:6446/\n\n2.3 Yes https://higamebit[.]com:6446/\n\n2.3 Yes https://helloking[.]site:6446/\n\n2.4 Yes https://kingdomain[.]site:6556/\n\n2.5 Yes https://kingdomain[.]site:6556/\n\n\n_Table 2. GoBotKR version timeline_\n\nAs seen in the table, the first malware samples detected in May 2018 were not yet\ncustomized for South Korean targets and were thus almost identical to the GoBot2 source\ncode. However, we were able to link them to newer samples because they used the same\nC&C server.\n\n## How to stay safe\n\nIf you suspect you might have fallen victim to this malware campaign, we recommend you\nscan your computer with a reliable security solution. ESET products detect and block this\nmalware under the detection name Win64/GoBot2. You can use ESET’s Free Online\nScanner to check your computer for the presence of this threat and remove anything that is\ndetected. Existing ESET customers are protected automatically.\n\n\n-----\n\nPirated content distributed via torrent sites is a well-known vector for spreading all kinds of\nmalware. To steer clear of similar attacks in the future, stick to official sources when\ndownloading content. Before launching downloaded files, pay attention to whether their\nextensions match the intended filetypes. To keep your computer protected, we advise you\nto patch regularly and use reputable security software.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n ESET detection name\n\nWin64/GoBot2\n\n## C&C
