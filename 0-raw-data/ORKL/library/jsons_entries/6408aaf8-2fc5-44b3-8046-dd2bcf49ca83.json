Others\nsay it is useless to use or even improve Metasploit's exe generation since the AV engines will\ndetect the RWX stub, so you have to find your own way to get RWX memory. Some of these\nanswers are just outdated, others still work, but for all of them there is no real evidence\navailable on the Web. The reason for this is simple: AV evasion is like the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle: Whenever you scan a piece of malware (and especially when you upload\n[it to services like VirusTotal, you will affect future detection of the same file or similar files. And,](http://www.virustotal.com/)\na writeup like this will also affect how AV detects files, thus making it harder to evade it.\nTherefore, most researcher try to keep their information about antivirus private, having the\nconsequence that a lot of research is done a lot of times.\n\nThis article tries to given an overview about the current executable generation scheme of\nMetasploit, how AV detects them, and how to evade them. Note that this document only covers\nstandalone EXE files (for Windows) that replace an EXE template's functionality, and not other\npayloads for exploits, service executables (like for the windows/psexec exploit) or\nexecutables that merely add to the original template's functionality (like the -k option of\nmsfpayload). Some situations (like some social engineering \"exploits\", or generating a Java\napplet that calls native meterpreter) will implicitly create such an EXE file, though, so it helps\nthese use cases as well.\n\n[A good writeup about how EXE files are currently generated is available at scriptjunkie's blog.](http://www.scriptjunkie.us/2011/04/why-encoding-does-not-matter-and-how-metasploit-generates-exes/)\n\nThey were uploaded to VirusTotal for analysis, the actual analysis reports are attached to the\nend of this document.\n\nAs of July 2011 (SVN revision 13090), the basic meterpreter image\n```\ndefault_meterpreter.exe is detected by 26 of 43 antivirus engines (60%) listed at\n\n```\nVirusTotal.\n\nThe definitely easiest way to reduce AV detection is using a different EXE template. Almost any\nnative Win32 EXE file can be used, and a typical Windows user has thousands of them on his\nhard disk. Just pick one and AV detection will go down. The more exotic the software, the\nbetter. For this example, I chose notepad.exe from a German WinXP SP3 installation.\n\nThe default executable template (msf3\\data\\templates\\template_x86_windows.exe)\nis detected by 3 AV engines (CAT-QuickHeal, SUPERAntiSpyware, VirusBuster) as malicious.\nConversely, any other Meterpreter payload built from a different template is not detected by\nthese three AV engines. For 4 other AV engines (AhnLab-V3, Emsisoft, Ikarus, Panda), the\n\n\n-----\n\ntemplates themselves are not detected, but payloads built from that template are detected, but\nnot the payloads from the Notepad template. Therefore, just by using a custom template, you\ncan reduce the detection rate from 26 to 19 engines (44%).\n\nImproving payload encoders is much harder, especially since the x86/shikata_ga_nai\nencoder (that uses a polymorphic decoder stub) is excellent for evasion. Testing this option is\neasy, by testing with EXE files without a payload at all. If they are still detected, encoders will\nnot be able to help avoid detection either. When looking at the overall results, there is not a\nsingle antivirus where removing the payload improves detection in all cases. For 6 of them\n(BitDefender, Emsisoft, F-Secure, Ikarus, NOD32, nProtect), removing the payload sometimes\ndereases the detection rate, but not in all cases.\n\nAs a conclusion, considering the amount of time that would be needed to improve encoders\nfurther, improvement of encoders is basically only interesting if it also helps evasion of IDS/IPS\nor similar systems. We will look at different options in this article, though.\n\nAs scriptjunkie wrote in his article, tracing from the entry point over the nop sled to the jump\nthat jumps to the RWX stub is quite easy to do. In case AV is using it for detection, it might be\nan option to look at opportunities to make that code more complex.\n\nTo test this, I modified the EXE generator so that it does not fix the entry point at all, resulting in\nbroken executables that do not run the payload. On the other hand, all the evil code (RWX stub\nand payload) is still in there, so if the AV does not trace execution but detect the payload in\nanother way, it should still detect the file. The following patch was used to achieve this:\n\nThe resulting files were only detected by one antivirus engines (DrWeb); although they still\ncontain the full payload and RWX stub. Some people will now start complaining again that it is\npointless to AV check files that do not run at all. To prove them wrong, I tried a simple\nmodification to the encoder so that it does not create a relative jump, but an indirect one to a\nregister that is initialized via XORing two values. I also added a small loop to make tracing the\nexecution flow harder. The following patch was used to achieve this:\n\nThat way, the binary without a payload was only detected by 4 AV engines, and a binary with\nmeterpreter was detected by 9 AV engines, which is quite an improvement from 19 engines,\nconsidering this primitive way of obfuscation.\n\nJust to make it clear, I do not propose applying this patch to Metasploit - it is easy for the AV\nguys to update their detections. But having some more complicated way of jumping to the entry\npoint (using polymorphic code, for example) could help quite a bit to reduce AV detection and I\nthink it is easier to write polymorphic \"jump anywhere\" code than a polymorphic RWX stub...\n\nObfuscation of the RWX stub is hard, especially since you cannot use self-modifying code. So\nto obfuscate the RWX stub, you are basically limited to replacing opcodes by others with\nsame/similar effect, and to reordering parts. An alternative might be to do a simple \"VM\" that\n\n\n-----\n\nreads instructions from heap or stack, because it can modify the instructions there; however,\nthis is quite some amount of work with no guarantee that it will help for long.\n\nTo assess the potential success of this method, I tried to build executables that do not make\nthe memory RWX before executing it, using the following patch:\n\nThe resulting files were still detected by AVG and DrWeb; when comparing them with the other\n\"broken\" files (with the bad entry point), they do not perform better, but actually they perform\nworse in the sense that only the nop sled seems to be sufficient to make AVG detect it as\nmalicious, while AVG did not detect the executables with the modified entry point. On the other\nhand, the file with the XORed entry point was detected by AVG again, increasing the\nprobability that it is indeed the nop sled (without the following jump) that make AVG detect the\nfile.\n\nConsidering the vast amount of time needed to make a new rwx stub, combined with the low\nsuccess chance (it will not help against AVG or DrWeb), I'll skip this option for now, and look at\nthe other ones.\n\nMetasploit includes an \"old\" option called exe-small to build executables from a template that\nreserves space for the payload and stores its length at a fixed position. Using this template\nmethod, no part of the text section has to be modified dynamically, therefore reducing the risk\nof heuristics detecting the file. On the other hand, the text section is static, making it easy to\ndetect a given sample with static signatures. Therefore, once such a sample is used (and\nmaybe uploaded to VirusTotal, either by you or by your target), the sample has to be\nconsidered \"burnt\" in the sense that a few hours to days later, most AVs will detect your\nsamples with ease. This makes it hard to test the effectiveness of this approach, especially if\nyou want to use the generated samples (if you test them, they will be useless afterwards).\n\nI built a small exe sample using VC++ Express 2008 by creating a console application project\nwithout precompiled headers and changed the Runtime Library option from /MTD to /MT (so\nthat it does not link against VC runtime DLLs).\n\nA small patch was required to make Metasploit detect the new template and properly make the\nsection RWX:\n\n(Un-)Fortunately, even the empty template without payload was detected by one antivirus,\nprobably because of that RWX section. Let's try again, this time without the code that makes\nthe section RWX (commenting out the two lines changed by the patch above) but instead\ncopying the payload ourselves into RWX memory:\n\nNow, the empty payload does not trigger any antivirus (which is correct, since it is not\nmalicious; but at least no heuristics caught this template) and the meterpreter payload is\ndetected only by Microsoft, Kaspersky, F-Secure and other engines that I think use either of\nthese engines, resulting in a 6 of 43 detection rate (14%).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next question that arises: Do those 6 antivirus detect the shikata_ga_nai encoder or do\nthey sandbox the executable and detect the real behaviour (reverse shell)? To test this, I built\nan executable that uses an empty payload, but encoded with shikata_ga_nai 10 times:\n\nThis template is also detected by none of the antivirus engines; the shikata_ga_nai encoder is\nnot the culprit of detection.\n\nAs a conclusion, if you have the time and skill to design your own exe stub, it is the best option\nof all the options tried by now. But remember that you cannot use it very often, since creating\nsignatures for it is very easy (definitely easier than writing the new stub, and also a lot easier\nthan deobfuscating the entry point nop sled), so it is a good option only for \"important\" targets\n(or ones where you can be pretty sure it will not be detected). If you have to target one of the\nantivirus engines that use sandboxing, you will have to evade this separately, though.\n\nTo evade sandboxing, there are basically three ways I can think of (maybe there are more):\n\nTry to use more computing power/time than the sandbox allows you to have\nCall API functions that are hard to emulate, or API functions that indicate the application has\nstarted/finished in the hope that the antivirus will give up\n\nCall API functions where you think a sandbox will emulate them incorrectly, and verify the\nresult; if incorrect, stop immediately (similar to what some current malware does when it\ndetects a VM to complicate reversing)\nI thought of a simple code snippet that tries to implement all the three ways: The first one is\ndone by a Sleep() call, the second one by calling PeekMessage (which usually indicates the\napplication finished initializing), and the third one by verifying with GetTickCount that the Sleep\ncall really slept (in case the sandbox just implemented Sleep as a no-op) and by verifying that\nthe received message is really the same that was posted. Of course, there are more\nsophisticated ways, like starting multiple threads, doing interlocked operations and verifying the\nresults and the timing, but I wanted to start simple.\n\nAs a result, almost all previous detections went away - only Microsoft and Kaspersky still\nbelieve this is malicious. On the other hand, that code seems to trigger a new heuristic in\nSophos, increasing the number of antivirus that still detects the sample to 3 of 43 (7%).\nSandbox evasion can be quite effective if your target AV is using it, you just have to be careful\nnot triggering new heuristics with them... It should be possible to put the sandbox evasion into\na Metasploit encoder (that prepends it) and encoding the result further to make it harder to\ndetect; this is left as an exercise to the reader, though.\n\n_To be continued? I doubt it will get better than 3 of 43..._\n\n**Antivirus** **Version** **Last update** **Result**\n\nAhnLab-V3 2011.07.07.01 2011.07.07 \nAntiVir 7.11.10.246 2011.07.07 \n\n-----\n\nAntiy-AVL
