Black Lives\nMatter protesters surrounding the Clintons’ house in New York and firing gunshots. These\nare a few of the fake scandals that an Israeli news outlet’s hacked Twitter account tried to\nfool readers into believing for a few brief moments earlier this month. Twitter says the trolls\namplifying them are linked to Iran.\n\nThe incident ended as quickly as it began and the outlet, Israel Hayom, [regained control of](https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/10/05/israel-hayoms-english-language-twitter-account-hacked/)\nits account. But the hack wasn’t an isolated event. Over the past year, hackers have broken\ninto a number of news organizations’ Twitter accounts and at least one website to plant fake\nstories. A new investigation by The Daily Beast and Mandiant Threat Intelligence suggests\nthat hackers in Iran may be behind the incidents.\n\nTwitter accounts used to amplify the fake Israel Hayom stories have been used to hype\nbogus articles planted by hackers in an Orthodox Jewish news website and a Bahraini news\noutlet’s Twitter account. The Iranian-linked accounts also garnered attention for a fake\naccount impersonating one of America’s best-known doctors, Zeke Emanuel.\n\nThe Daily Beast shared its findings with Twitter. The social media company then suspended\nroughly 80 accounts for violating its platform manipulation policies on impersonation,\ncoordinated amplification, and spam.\n\n“At this stage, we’re investigating thoroughly but early technical and behavioral indicators\nsuggest that these accounts are interconnected and have their origins within Iran,” a Twitter\nspokesperson said in a statement. “As ever, we disclose every single account and Tweet we\ncan reliably associate with state actors to our public archive — the only one of its kind in the\nindustry.”\n\nThe Daily Beast was unable to identify the specific hackers responsible for the Twitter\naccount and website breaches. But the coordinated, overlapping amplification of the break-in\nby Iranian-linked accounts on social media suggests a relationship between the hackers\nplanting stories and the troll accounts publicizing them.\n\n## A Trail of Hacks\n\nWhen hackers broke into Israel Hayom’s Twitter account to try and fool users into thinking\nTrump was on death’s door and Black Lives Matter was coming after the Clintons, they\nslipped in some telling regional content. Next to the fake tweets about U.S. politics, the\nhackers placed a bogus claim that Israeli authorities had discovered a Hezbollah submarine\noff the coast of Haifa.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs users pointed out the obviously phoney content, a handful of Twitter accounts leapt to a\ncoordinated defense of the storylines with cut-and-pasted talking points to try and beat back\nthe doubters. Examples included “The word hack is used well to cover the real weakness of\nthe Israeli forces!” and \"We must accept the great military capability of Hezbollah which could\nannihilate the Israel.\"\n\nThe amplification attempts, while lame and unsuccessful, point to a trail of similar hacking\nincidents involving Iranian-linked propaganda trolls.\n\nThe Twitter accounts @fahad_alm1989 and @jessica722225874, the latter of which claimed\nto be a former ABC News journalist, spent much of their short existence spamming links to a\nstory posted on Hidabroot, an Orthodox Jewish news and TV organization based in Israel.\n\nThe story, subsequently deleted and written in clumsy Hebrew, included fake quotes from an\nIsraeli minister likening Arab leaders to easily led donkeys in the wake of Israel’s\nnormalization agreement with the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn an email to The Daily Beast, the site’s administrators said that it had been hacked before\nthe fake story was posted.\n\n@fahad_alm1989 also repeatedly spammed legitimate news organizations’ Twitter mentions\nwith links to hacked tweets from Al Bilad, a Bahraini news organization which briefly lost\ncontrol of its Twitter account in August and September. Tweets from Al Bilad’s compromised\naccount have since been deleted but, like the fake Hidabroot story, screenshots captured at\nthe time show the account tweeted criticism of the United Arab Emirates for its normalization\n[of diplomatic relations with Israel. In an Instagram post, Al Bilad confirmed that it had been](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE63UHpl7S6/)\nhacked and subject to a series of break-in attempts at the time.\n\nIt’s still unclear who was responsible for the account break-ins amplified by Iranian linked\ntrolls. But compromising legitimate news sites to post fabricated news articles is a move\ncybersecurity researchers are increasingly concerned about, according to Lee Foster, senior\nmanager for information operations analysis at Mandiant Threat Intelligence.\n\n“The compromise of legitimate news websites to post fabricated stories is a tactic we’ve seen\nfrom various actors, and is one we’re increasingly concerned about given those sites’\nperceived credibility and the direct reach they have with large audiences,” Foster said.\n\n## Impersonators\n\nDrawing attention to hacked stories wasn’t the only way the Iran-linked trolls tried to get\neyeballs on their propaganda. When hackers couldn’t steal real estate on a legitimate news\norganization’s website or Twitter accounts, the Iranian-linked trolls simply imitated famous\npeople in an attempt to mimic their way into an audience.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the targets of their impersonation campaign was Dr. Zeke Emanuel, the brother of\nObama White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and the chair of the department of medical\nethics at the University of Pennsylvania. The fake Zeke Emanuel account warned that Black\nand elderly Americans would be forced to receive treatment for COVID-19 at FEMA camps in\na racist conspiracy narrative echoed by pro-Iranian troll accounts.\n\n“I did not have a Twitter account before that,” Emanuel told The Daily Beast in an email.\n“Someone complimented me on getting onto Twitter and that was the first I learned about the\naccount. Frankly the impersonation was pretty damn good.”\n\nThe impersonation took place in mid May, just as pro-Iranian trolls pushed a similarly racist\n[narrative about the pandemic, previously reported on by The Daily Beast. At that time, an](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-iran-troll-posed-as-who-official-to-push-racist-coronavirus-hoax)\naccount in the name of a real World Health Organization executive, mistakenly verified by the\nsocial media company, pushed a false conspiracy about the Trump administration testing a\ncoronavirus vaccine on Black Americans, in an apparent callback to the Tuskegee\nexperiments, one of the darkest moments in American medical ethics.\n\nIranian trolls also impersonated an Israeli hospital executive in an attempt to embarrass the\npresident of Tajikistan and his son. The account posed as the CEO of a private hospital in\nHerzliya to falsely claim that Rustam Emomali, the chairman of Tajikistan's national assembly\nand the son of Tajik president Emomali Rahmon, had been treated for rectal cancer in Israel.\n[Emomali and the Tajik government have denied the accusations and called them a](https://asiaplustj.info/en/news/tajikistan/politics/20201001/dushanbe-city-hall-rustam-emomali-is-not-sick-he-is-completely-healthy-and-full-of-strength)\n“deliberate provocation.”\n\nThe real Israeli hospital executive did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter\nsuspended the fake account impersonating him after The Daily Beast reported it to the\ncompany.\n\n[Relations between Iran and Tajikistan have reportedly been](https://eurasianet.org/tajikistan-revives-on-off-dispute-with-iran) [strained after Tajik state](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/163954/Iran-summons-Tajik-envoy-over-baseless-accusations)\ntelevision recently broadcast allegations about Iranian-funded militants in the Central Asian\ncountry during a civil war in the 1990s.\n\n## Endless Mayfly\n\nTwitter suspended an additional four accounts found by The Daily Beast and FireEye but as\nyet has not linked them to any larger campaign or actor.\n\nThe accounts, posing primarily as journalists, used a number of tricks similar to the ones\nattributed to Iranian actors, including amplifying fake tweets from hacked Twitter accounts\nused to criticize the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn June, hackers took over a long defunct Twitter account, @ArabiaNow, run by lobbying firm\nQorvis Communications on behalf of the Saudi embassy in Washington, DC, and used it two\ntweet fake stories about the Trump Organization getting construction contracts in Saudi\nArabia and the Saudi government giving contracts to Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point\n\n\n-----\n\nQorvis did not respond to a request from The Daily Beast for comment.\n\nThe four accounts also tweeted spoofed domains meant to resemble the websites of\nlegitimate news organizations in a manner similar to a disinformation campaign known as\n[Endless Mayfly. The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab first identified Endless Mayfly as an](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/)\n“Iran-aligned” disinformation activity that spoofs real news websites with typo-squatting—\nregistering sites with easy to miss spelling mistakes—to push “narratives critical of Saudi\nArabia, the United States, and Israel.”\n\nThe spoofed sites tweeted out by the four suspended accounts look like something right out\nof the Mayfly playbook, with spoofed news sites, narratives focused on the U.S., Israel and\nSaudi Arabia, and amplification of them spammed into the replies of real news outlets’\nTwitter accounts. The sites—meant to look like real pages for The Independent Australia,\n[Israel National News, and](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-iran-troll-posed-as-who-official-to-push-racist-coronavirus-hoax) [Nouvelobs—used a misspelled URL and copied site addresses](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tammy-duckworth-impersonated-in-racist-disinformation-campaign)\nregistered at differing top level domains to spread fake stories about the son of Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu, a fake U.S.-Israeli coup attempt.\n\nAnd while Twitter hasn’t yet attributed the four accounts to any larger activity or actor, they\nshare some overlap to the suspended accounts recently linked to Iran. In particular, the four\naccounts amplified both the fake Zeke Emanuel account and the Al Bilad Twitter account\nhack which featured prominently in the activity of Iranian trolls attributed by Twitter. In other\nwords, they appear to be part of a broader, pro-Tehran disinformation push.\n\n\n-----",
