The targeting\ntook place while he was reporting on Saudi Arabia, and writing a book about Saudi\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe targeting resulted in Pegasus infections in July 2020 and June 2021. Notably,\n[these infections occurred after Hubbard complained to NSO Group that he was](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/reader-center/phone-hacking-saudi-arabia.html)\n[targeted by the Saudi-linked KINGDOM Pegasus operator in June 2018.](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/)\nWhile we attribute the 2020 and 2021 infections to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware with\nhigh confidence, we are not conclusively attributing this activity to a specific NSO\nGroup customer at this time. However, we believe that the operator responsible for the\n[2021 hack is also responsible for the hacking of a Saudi activist in 2021.](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/)\n\nSome forensic artifacts that we connect to NSO Group are present on Hubbard’s\ndevice as early as April 2018, although we are unable to confirm whether this\nrepresents a genuine infection attempt or a feasibility test.\n[A phone number belonging to Hubbard also reportedly appeared on the](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/world/middleeast/israel-nso-pegasus-spyware.html) Pegasus\nProject list in July 2019. Unfortunately, forensic evidence is not available for this\ntimeframe.\n\n## 1. Background: NSO Group’s Zero-Click iPhone Hacking Capabilities\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NSO Group has used and demonstrated zero-click iPhone\n[exploits since at least 2017. A Haaretz story cited a June 2017 zero-click iPhone demo to the](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-company-negotiated-to-sell-advanced-cybertech-to-the-saudis-1.6680618)\n[Saudi Government, and a 2018 Motherboard article described a different zero-click iPhone](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvakb3/inside-nso-group-spyware-demo)\n\n\n-----\n\n[demonstration. Meanwhile, in 2019, WhatsApp announced that NSO Group had been](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/protecting-our-users-from-a-video-calling-cyber-attack/?lang=en)\nexploiting WhatsApp video calling functionality to conduct zero-click infections of Android\ndevices.\n\n**Winter 2019: iMessage Zero-Click Activity**\n\nWe first observed a Pegasus zero-click attack directed against an iPhone in December 2019\nwhen we began running VPNs on the phones of potentially targeted users. We were not able\nto recover any logs from the targeted phone at that time, so we are unsure of the precise\nexploit used.\n\n**Summer 2020: The KISMET Exploit (iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7)**\n\n[This was followed by the KISMET zero-click exploit which NSO customers widely deployed](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/)\nstarting in July 2020 against iOS 13.5.1 and later against iOS 13.7. The iOS14 update\napparently blocked exploitation of KISMET.\n\n**2021: The FORCEDENTRY Exploit (iOS 14.x until 14.7.1)**\n\nNSO Group customers began using the FORCEDENTRY exploit as early as February 2021.\nNSO Group customers were continuing to deploy FORCEDENTRY against iPhones running\niOS versions through 14.7.1 as of September 2021. We [captured the FORCEDENTRY](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/)\nexploit and disclosed it to Apple in September 2021. Apple patched FORCEDENTRY in iOS\n[14.8, six days after our disclosure. Amnesty Tech also saw traces associated with this exploit](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\nduring forensic analyses they performed as part of the Pegasus Project.\n\n## 2. The 2021 Pegasus Hack of Ben Hubbard\n\n_We conclude with high confidence that an iPhone belonging to Hubbard was successfully_\n_hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware on June 13, 2021, with the infection process_\n_starting around 15:45:20 GMT._\n\n**Details from Hack of Saudi Activist**\n\nWe [recovered the FORCEDENTRY exploit from a backup of a Saudi activist’s iPhone. The](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/)\n**_FORCEDENTRY exploit was delivered to the Saudi activist’s phone in 31 iMessage_**\nattachments sent from the iMessage account [EMAIL ADDRESS 1], based on an analysis of\nthe activist’s phone logs, including their com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist file.\nThe FORCEDENTRY exploit was [used to deploy NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware onto the](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/)\nphone of the Saudi activist, and this process involved a file dropped into the Library/Caches\nfolder.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: The FORCEDENTRY exploit on the phone of the Saudi activist.\nWe believe that iMessage accounts used to deliver Pegasus, like [EMAIL ADDRESS 1], are\nused exclusively for this purpose, as other elements of NSO Group’s Pegasus infrastructure,\nsuch as infection servers and command-and-control servers, are used exclusively in relation\nto Pegasus and not for any other uses.\n\n**Similarities between Hubbard’s Phone and Phone of Saudi Activist**\n\nHubbard’s com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist file shows that the same iMessage\naccount [EMAIL ADDRESS 1] communicated with his phone at June 13, 2021 **_15:45:20_**\n**_GMT, about five minutes before a file was dropped in or deleted from the Library/Caches_**\nfolder, and at least 41 iMessage attachments were deleted. Additionally, three items were\ndeleted from Hubbard’s DataUsage.sqlite file, leaving a gap in the sequence of Z_PK values\nin the ZPROCESS table. The deleted items all had timestamps greater than June 9, 2021\n11:56:46 GMT and less than June 16, 2021 8:46:17 GMT. Based on this pattern of facts, we\nconclude with high confidence that Hubbard’s iPhone was hacked with NSO Group’s\nPegasus spyware on June 13, **_2021_** **_15:45:20 GMT._**\n\n## 3. The 2020 Pegasus Hack of Ben Hubbard\n\n_We conclude with high confidence that an iPhone belonging to Hubbard was successfully_\n_hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware on July 12,_ **_2020, with the infection process_**\n_starting around 16:46:01 GMT._\n\n**_DataUsage.sqlite Artifact_**\n\nWe found that Ben Hubbard’s DataUsage.sqlite file showed that process name bh was active\non July 13, 2020 16:46:01. This process name is consistent with NSO Group’s Pegasus\n[spyware, which uses the bh process name apparently as an abbreviation for “bridgehead,”](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\nwhich appears to be a term of art referring to an initial stage of a malicious payload. A\nsubsequent backup of Hubbard’s phone taken in July 2021 (after the 2021 Pegasus hack of\nhis phone) shows that this bh entry was deleted from DataUsage.sqlite, leaving a gap in the\nsequence of Z_PK values in the ZPROCESS table.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found that attachments for at least 13 iMessages were deleted at July 12, 2020 16:45:55,\nseveral seconds before the DataUsage.sqlite artifact, indicating iMessage as the likely vector\nfor Pegasus in this case. NSO Group customers were widely deploying the KISMET zeroclick iMessage exploit at this time to hack target phones.\n\n**_HIPPOCRENE FACTOR Present on Hubbard’s Phone_**\n\nHubbard’s phone logs show a sign of Pegasus infection that we call the HIPPOCRENE\n**_FACTOR. A careful analysis of Hubbard’s logs indicates that the HIPPOCRENE FACTOR_**\nwas introduced onto Hubbard’s phone sometime after January 29, 2020 and before\nDecember 14, 2020. We have attributed the HIPPOCRENE FACTOR to NSO Group’s\nPegasus spyware with high confidence, though we are not describing additional technical\ndetails of the HIPPOCRENE FACTOR here, in order to maintain visibility into NSO Group’s\nspyware.\n\n## 4. The 2018 Pegasus Artifacts on Hubbard’s Phone\n\n_We conclude with high confidence that a Pegasus operator, KINGDOM, sent Hubbard SMS_\n_and WhatsApp messages in June 2018 containing links that, if clicked, would have infected_\n_his phone with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. We also noted that an Apple account that we_\n_believe is linked to Pegasus contacted Hubbard’s phone in April 2018, but we could not_\n_determine if this represented an infection attempt._\n\n**An Odd Email Address is Looked Up**\n\nThe com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist files on Hubbard’s phones records that an\nNSO Group system likely reached out to Hubbard’s phone on April 4, 2018 using Apple’s\n_Thumper cloud calling feature. The outreach was via an Apple account with the email_\naddress [EMAIL ADDRESS 2]. It is presently unclear if this outreach was a bona fide\nhacking attempt, or simply a targeted feasibility test to see whether Hubbard’s phone could\n_have been hacked with Pegasus. Amnesty Tech_ [observed that the presence of an unfamiliar](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\nemail address looked up by the Thumper cloud calling feature was sometimes correlated\nwith Pegasus hacking.\n\n**_KINGDOM Pegasus Messages from 2018_**\n\nWe [previously documented that Hubbard received a Pegasus SMS on June 21, 2018 from](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/)\n**_KINGDOM, a Pegasus operator that we link to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with high_**\n[confidence. Though NSO Group issued an off-the-record denial that the link sent to Hubbard](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/reader-center/phone-hacking-saudi-arabia.html)\nwas related to them, we still connect the link to NSO Group with high confidence. Hubbard’s\nphone also shows a KINGDOM Pegasus WhatsApp message sent on June 2, 2018 8:54:42\nPM GMT (Table 1). The message is largely identical to a Pegasus message targeted at an\nAmnesty International staffer in 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nMr Ben Hubbard is it possible for you to cover [a\ndemonstration] for your brothers detained in Saudi Arabia\nin front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington [DC]?\nMy brother is detained during Ramadan, and I am on a\nscholarship there, so please do not associate me with the\ntopic\n\n[https://akhbar-arabia[.]com/caMVTXn](http://10.10.0.46/about:blank)\n\nCover the demonstration now, it will start in less than an\nhour\n\nWe need your support please\n\n\nاﺳﺘﺎذ ﺑﻦ ﻫﺒﺮد ﻫﻞ ﺑﺎﻻﻣﻜﺎن ﻋﻤﻞ ﺗﻐﻄﯿﺔ\nﻻﺧﻮاﻧﻚ اﻟﻤﻌﺘﻘﻠﯿﻦ ﻓﻲ ﺳﺠﻮن اﻟﺴﻌﻮدﯾﺔ\nاﻣﺎم اﻟﺴﻔﺎرة اﻟﺴﻌﻮدﯾﺔ ﻓﻲ واﺷﻨﻄﻦ\nاﻧﺎ اﺧﻮي ﻣﻌﺘﻘﻞ ﻓﻲ رﻣﻀﺎن واﻧﺎ ﻣﺒﺘﻌﺜﻪ\nﻫﻨﺎك ﻓﺎرﺟﻮ ان ﻻ ﯾﺘﻢ ارﺗﺒﺎﻃﻲ\nﺑﺎﻟﻤﻮﺿﻮع\n\nhttps://akhbararabia[.]com/caMVTXn\n\nﺗﻐﻄﯿﺔ ﻟﻠﻤﻈﺎﻫﺮات اﻻن وﺳﺘﺒﺪا ﺑﻌﺪ اﻗﻞ\nﻣﻦ ﺳﺎﻋﻪ\n\nﻣﺤﺘﺎﺟﯿﻦ دﻋﻤﻚ ﻟﻮ ﺳﻤﺤﺖ\n\n\n**Table 1: The KINGDOM Pegasus WhatsApp message sent to Hubbard on June 2, 2018.**\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nHubbard was repeatedly subjected to targeted hacking with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.\nThe hacking took place after the very public reporting in 2020 by Hubbard and the Citizen\nLab that he had been a target. The case starkly illustrates the dissonance between NSO\nGroup’s stated concerns for human rights and oversight, and the reality: it appears that no\neffective steps were taken by the company to prevent the repeated targeting of a prominent\nAmerican journalist’s phone.\n\nThe hacking of a New York Times’ reporter adds to a long list of documented cases of\njournalists being targeted or hacked using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware:\n\n[In December 2020, the Citizen Lab published a report outlining how the personal](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/)\nphones belonging to 36 journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at Al Jazeera,\nand a personal phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV, were hacked with\nPegasus spyware.\n[Amnesty International’s Security Lab verified that Sevinc Vaqifqizi, a freelance](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/)\njournalist for independent media outlet Meydan TV, had his phone infected with\nPegasus in early 2021.\nAmnesty also confirmed that the devices of Siddharth Varadarajan and MK Venu, cofounders of India’s the Wire, were infected with Pegasus as recently as June 2021.\n[On August 2, 2021, French intelligence investigators confirmed that forensic traces](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/aug/02/pegasus-spyware-found-on-journalists-phones-french-intelligence-confirms)\nassociated with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware had been detected on three French\njournalists’ phones.\nIn September 2021, the Citizen Lab confirmed that the phone of Dániel Németh, a\n[photojournalist working out of Budapest, was also hacked with Pegasus spyware, with](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/sep/21/hungary-journalist-daniel-nemeth-phones-infected-with-nso-pegasus-spyware)\nthe forensic analysis independently verified by Amnesty’s Security Lab.\n\n\n-----\n\nPrior Citizen Lab research has documented targeted espionage against journalists and\n[civic media using Pegasus spyware in cases involving Saudi Arabia and](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/) [Mexico.](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/)\n\nThe extensive and routine abuse of Pegasus spyware to hack journalists is a direct threat to\npress freedom worldwide, and is contributing to a growing chilling climate for investigative\n[journalism. As a recent report by the Center for International Media Assistance notes, “[t]he](https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/spyware-an-unregulated-and-escalating-threat-to-independent-media/)\nuse of spyware poses safety risks to journalists and their sources, encourages selfcensorship, and creates new financial and operational strains for news outlets.” Until steps\nare taken to rein in the mercenary commercial spyware marketplace, repressive\ngovernments will continue to exploit products like NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to\nundermine independent journalism that seeks to hold them to account.\n\n**Acknowledgements: Thanks to Adam Senft and Miles Kenyon for editorial assistance and**\nsupport.
