    "plain_text": "# A former DarkSide listing shows up on REvil’s leak site\n\n**[databreaches.net/a-former-darkside-listing-shows-up-on-revils-leak-site/](https://www.databreaches.net/a-former-darkside-listing-shows-up-on-revils-leak-site/)**\n\n[On May 15, Chum1ng0 reported that German furniture retailer Möbelstadt Sommerlad had](https://www.databreaches.net/de-darkside-threat-actors-attempted-to-extort-mobelstadt-sommerlad/)\nbeen hit by DarkSide threat actors. By then DarkSide’s leak site was down and it had not\nbeen possible to confirm whether DarkSide had ever listed the retailer as a victim or dumped\nany proof of claim, but given the time frame of the attack and the takedown of DarkSide’s\nsite, it seemed unlikely that they had ever been listed. It was the owner of the furniture store\nwho named DarkSide as the threat actors, and who stated that the firm would not be paying\nany ransom.\n\nAs of today, the notice saying that the store is still not functioning remains on their web site\n(the English version):\n\nIMAGE: DATABREACHES.NET\nBut also of note, today Chum1ng0 noticed that REvil (Sodinokibi) threat actors listed this\nattack as their work, and claim to have more than 175 GB of data:\n\nWe downloaded a lot of interesting information from your network. All data are fresh\nand will be stored on our CDN servers for the next 6 month if you do not pay.\n\nIf you need data leak proofs, we are ready to provide them.\n\n\n-----\n\nIMAGE: DATABREACHES.NET\nConsistent with their usual practice, they provided some screencaps of file trees.\n\nThe fact that they listed the firm on their leak site suggests that Möbelstadt Sommerlad’s\nowner has not changed their mind and is continuing to refuse to pay any ransom, but without\nemail and with their Facebook page not available, it’s difficult to confirm this with them.\n\n\n-----\n\nMöbelstadt Sommerlad;s Facebook page on May 26, 2021. IMAGE: DATABREACHES.NET\nWhat the listing by REvil does confirm, however, is some frequent speculation that DarkSide\nand REvil had a collaborative or cooperative relationship somehow. Did one of DarkSide’s\naffiliates now take their data to REvil to help them with the extortion attempt? Perhaps.\n\n_In collaboration with Chum1ng0. Post-publication, I learned that this was first reported on_\n_Twitter by @z0man, so credit to him._\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n[De: Darkside threat actors attempted to extort Möbelstadt…](https://www.databreaches.net/de-darkside-threat-actors-attempted-to-extort-mobelstadt-sommerlad/)\n[DarkSide ransomware decryptor recovers victims' files for…](https://www.databreaches.net/darkside-ransomware-decryptor-recovers-victims-files-for-free/)\n[Fake DarkSide gang targets energy, food industry in…](https://www.databreaches.net/fake-darkside-gang-targets-energy-food-industry-in-extortion-emails/)\n[DarkSide ransomware is creating a secure data leak service…](https://www.databreaches.net/darkside-ransomware-is-creating-a-secure-data-leak-service-in-iran/)\n[Secret Chats Show How Cybergang Became a Ransomware…](https://www.databreaches.net/secret-chats-show-how-cybergang-became-a-ransomware-powerhouse/)\n\n\n-----",
