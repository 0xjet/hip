The\ndifference, in this case, is that the payload is delivered through FTP! It’s pretty unusual\nbecause FTP is today less and less used for multiple reasons (lack of encryption by default,\ncomplex to filter with those passive/active modes). Support for FTP has even been disabled\nby default in Chrome starting with version 95! But FTP remains a common protocol in the\nIoT/Linux landscape with malware families like Mirai. My honeypots still collect a lot of Mirai\nsamples on FTP servers. I don’t understand why the attacker chose this protocol because, in\nmost corporate environments, FTP is not allowed by default (and should definitely not be!)…\n\n[[Read more]](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/RedLine+Stealer+Delivered+Through+FTP/28258/)\n\n\n-----",
