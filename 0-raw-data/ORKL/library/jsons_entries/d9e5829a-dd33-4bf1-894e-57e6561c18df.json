Earlier this year we released a case study on our first Bulletproof Exchanger Project, a](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684900882/The-Bulletproof-Exchanger-Project-How-Binance-Helped-Take-Down-a-Cybercriminal-Group-Laundering-%2442M)\ndedicated anti-ransomware initiative where we worked with the Ukraine Cyber Police to\narrest a major cybercriminal group laundering over $42M of illicit funds.\n\nMore recently Binance Security has been taking part in an international investigation with\nUkraine Cyber Police, Cyber Bureau of Korean National Police Agency, US Law\nEnforcement, Spanish Civil Guard, and Swiss Federal Office of Police, among others, in\n[apprehending a prolific cybercriminal ring. The group -- also known as FANCYCAT -- has](https://cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-xakerske-ugrupovannya-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-virusu-shyfruvalnyka-ta-nanesenni-inozemnym-kompaniyam-piv-milyarda-dolariv-zbytkiv-2402/)\nbeen running multiple criminal activities: distributing cyber attacks; operating a high-risk\n[exchanger; and laundering money from dark web operations and high-profile cyber attacks](https://geminiadvisory.io/fsb-takes-down-top-tier-marketplace-arrests-admins/)\nsuch as [Cl0p and](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252502541/Cl0p-ransomware-gang-clapped-in-irons-assets-seized) [Petya ransomware. In all, FANCYCAT is responsible for over $500M worth](https://fortune.com/2017/06/29/petya-goldeneye-maersk-ransomware-effects/)\nof damages in connection with ransomware and millions more from other cybercrimes.\n\nOperation FANCYCAT\n\nOver the past year we have expanded our in-house AML detection and analytics capabilities.\nBased on our research and analysis, as well as our understanding of cybercriminals' history\nand cashout tactics, we arrived at the conclusion that the biggest security problem in the\nindustry today is money connected to cyber attacks being laundered through nested services\nand parasite exchanger accounts that live inside macro VASPs, including exchanges like\nBinance.com. These criminals enjoy taking advantage of reputable exchanges’ liquidity,\ndiverse digital asset offerings and well-developed APIs.\n\nIn a majority of the cases associated with illicit blockchain flows coming onto exchanges, the\nexchange is not harboring the actual criminal group themselves, but rather being used as a\nmiddleman to launder stolen profits. Figure 1 shows an example of the money laundering\nprocess on an exchange in relation to cyber attacks:\n\n\n-----\n\nBlockchain analysis shows a network of money launderers living inside macro exchanges\nwhich deposit and withdraw to each other to wash the money. Understanding this diagnosis,\nwe are taking the necessary steps to prevent illicit activity. We are applying a two-pronged\napproach: 1) implementing our own detection mechanisms to identify and offboard\nsuspicious accounts 2) collaborating with law enforcement to build cases and take down\ncriminal groups.\n\nWe applied the two-pronged approach to the FANCYCAT investigation: our AML detection\nand analytics program detected suspicious activity on Binance.com and expanded the\nsuspect cluster. Once we mapped out the complete suspect network, we worked with private\nsector chain analytics companies TRM Labs and Crystal (BitFury) to analyze on-chain\nactivity and gain a better understanding of this group and its attribution. Based on our\nanalysis we found that this specific group was not only associated with laundering Cl0p\nattack funds, but also with Petya and other illegally-sourced funds. This led to the\nidentification and eventual arrest of FANCYCAT.\n\nWe are continuing to investigate the FANCYCAT criminal syndicate across multiple\njurisdictions and the connections associated with other cyber attacks.\n\nMaking the International Crypto Ecosystem a Safer Place\n\nAt Binance, we believe that strong controls across exchanges, smart legislation and ongoing\neducation will help immensely with weeding out bad actors. Projects such as our “Bulletproof\nExchanger” and our ongoing partnerships with law enforcement, as well as security and\nblockchain analytics firms, will be a driving force in improving the cybersecurity measures\nacross the wider crypto industry.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Binance\n\nBinance is the world’s leading blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure provider with a\nfinancial product suite that includes the largest digital asset exchange by volume.
