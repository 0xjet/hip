We have identified a new\ndistribution campaign which took place on 4th July. The malware used in this campaign has\nsimilar features to that distributed earlier in 2017 with the following changes:\n\nA new decoy document copy/pasted from an article published on the 3rd of July by\n[Yonhap News Agency in Korea;](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/07/03/0200000000AEN20170703005100315.html)\nThe dropper includes a 64 bit version of KONNI;\nA new CC infrastructure consisting of a climbing club website.\n\nNorth Korea conducted a test missile launch on 3rd July. This campaign appears to be\ndirectly related to the launch and the ensuing discussion of North Korean missile technology.\nThis is consistent with previous KONNI distribution campaigns which have also frequently\nmentioned North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n## N.K. marks anniversary of strategic force, touting missile capabilities campaign\n\nWe identified an executable file, SHA-256 hash sum:\n33f828ad462c414b149f14f16615ce25bd078630eee36ad953950e0da2e2cc90, which when\nopened displays the following Office document:\n\nThe content of the document is a copy/pasted from an article published on July 3rd by\n[Yonhap News Agency in Korea. In addition to displaying this document, the malicious](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/07/03/0200000000AEN20170703005100315.html)\nexecutable also drops 2 different versions of KONNI:\n```\nC:\\Users\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\MFAData\\event\\eventlog.dll (64 bit)\nC:\\Users\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\MFAData\\event\\errorevent.dll (32 bit)\n\n```\nOn 64 bit versions of Windows, both files are dropped; on 32 bit versions of Windows, only\nerrorevent.dll, the 32 bit version is dropped. Unlike previous campaigns, both binaries are\npacked with ASPack. In both cases, the dropped malware is immediately executed via\nrundll32.exe with one of the following registry keys created to ensure that the malware\npersists and is executed on rebooting the compromised system:\n```\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\RTHDVCPE\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\RTHDVCP\n\n```\nThis attack uses a new Command & Control infrastructure hosted on the following domain:\n\n\n-----\n\nmember-daumchk[.]netai[.]net\n\nThe CnC traffic of KONNI takes place as HTTP post requests to web pages hosted as\n/weget/download.php, /weget/uploadtm.php or /weget/upload.php on the domain itself.\n\nThe attackers have gone to some effort to disguise the website as a legitimate climbing club.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the website:\n\nHowever, the website does not contain real text, only the default text of the Content\nManagement System (CMS).\n\nAdditionally, the website contains a contacts section with an address in USA, but the map\nbelow the address is in Korean and points to a location in Seoul, South Korea:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe KONNI malware distributed as part of this campaign is similar to previous versions that\nwe have identified this year. The attackers have added a 64 bit version and used a packer to\ncomplicate analysis. This campaign is directly related to current events and is clearly 'fresh'.\nThe binary was compiled on July 4th, the decoy document was published on July 3rd.\n\nThe threat actors associated with KONNI typically use decoy documents relating to North\nKorea, and this campaign is no exception. However, in contrast to the convincing decoy\ndocument lifted from a third party, the content of the decoy website hosted on the CnC server\ndoes not look legitimate. The text content is not consistent with the website navigation, and\nthe contacts page contains a mis-match of a US address with a Korean map.\n\nNevertheless, this threat actor continues to remain active, and continues to develop updated\nversions of their malware. Organisations which may have an interest in the contents of this\ndecoy document, and that used in previous campaigns should ensure that they are\nadequately protected against this and subsequent campaigns.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/amp-firepower-software-license/tsd-products-support-series-home.html)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html) [WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n[The Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html)\nmalicious network activity by threat actors.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network\n\n## IOC\n\n**File hashes**\n\nDropper:\n33f828ad462c414b149f14f16615ce25bd078630eee36ad953950e0da2e2cc90\n32 Bits binary:\n290b1e2415f88fc3dd1d53db3ba90c4a760cf645526c8240af650751b1652b8a\n64 bits binary:\n8aef427aba54581f9c3dc923d8464a92b2d4e83cdf0fd6ace00e8035ee2936ad\n\n**Network**\n\nMember-daumchk[.]netai[.]net\n\n\n-----",
