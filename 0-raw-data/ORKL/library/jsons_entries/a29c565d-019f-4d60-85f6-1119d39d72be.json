In the\n\nprevious quarter major developments were seen worldwide for\n\nrelease of new directives for cyber security and protection of\n\nCritical Information Infrastructure. India has published its ‘Rules of\n\nInformation Security Practices and Procedures for Protected\n\nSystem’. This aims to strengthen NCIIPC’s efforts in protecting\n\nnational critical assets. In a similar move in March, Australia\n\npassed bill for security of its Critical Infrastructure.\n\nDuring last week of May 2018, European Union has declared\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the Data\n\nof its citizens. The move will have its effect worldwide. Under\n\nGDPR, companies need to nominate a Data Protection Officer\n\nand implement necessary measures for data privacy. On the\n\nother side, The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) finalized the\n\nrelease of Transportation Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 version protocol.\n\nTLS 1.3 will speed up and improve the security of HTTPS protocol.\n\nDuring the previous quarter, evolution of malwares targeting\n\nIndian Critical Infrastructure entities was observed. These\n\nmalwares typically use various Phishing techniques to penetrate\n\nsensitive network. As a precautionary measure, NCIIPC is taking\n\nproactive steps to raise user awareness on protection from such\n\nphishing attacks.\n\nNCIIPC organised cyber security sensitisation workshops at\n\nChandigarh and Puducherry in collaboration with respective\n\nState Governments.\n\nThanks to all our readers for their participation. Kindly keep\n\nmailing your suggestions and contributions at\n\nnewsletter@nciipc.gov.in\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 2** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\n## News Snippets - National\n\n**Rules Defined for Information Security of the ‘Protected System’**\n\n_http://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/Rules_procedures_new2018.pdf_\n\nCentral Government has declared ‘Rules for the Information\nSecurity Practices and Procedures for Protected System’. The\norganisation having ‘Protected System’ shall:\n\n - Constitute an Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC)\n\nwhich shall be the apex body.\n\n - Nominate a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\n - Maintain and continually improve Information Security\n\nManagement System (ISMS) of the ‘Protected System’.\n\n - Ensure that the network architecture of ‘Protected System’ is\n\ndocumented.\n\n - Maintain the documentation of authorised personnel having\n\naccess to ‘Protected System’.\n\n - Maintain and review the documents of inventory of hardware\n\nand software related to ‘Protected System’.\n\n - Ensure that Vulnerability/Threat/Risk (V/T/R) Analysis for the\n\ncyber security architecture of ‘Protected System’ be carried\nout at least once a year.\n\n - Implement and continually improve Cyber Crisis\nManagement Plan (CCMP).\n\n - Ensure conduct of internal and external Information Security\n\naudits periodically.\n\n - Maintain and review documented process for IT Security\n\nService Level Agreements (SLAs).\n\n - Establish a Cyber Security Operation Centre (C-SOC).\n\n - Establish a Network Operation Centre (NOC).\n\n - Maintain and review the process of taking regular backup of\n\nlogs of networking devices, perimeter devices,\ncommunication devices, servers, systems and services\nsupporting ‘Protected System’.\n\nThe CISO will be responsible for implementing various security\nmeasures and share any change related to ‘Protected System’\nwith NCIIPC. He shall also establish process of sharing of relevant\nlogs, records of Cyber Security Operation Centre (SOC)\npertaining to the ‘Protected System’.\n\n\n### The organisation having ‘Protected System’ shall constitute\n an Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC) which shall be the\n apex body.\n\n The CISO will be\n responsible for implementing the security measures suggested by NCIIPC. \n\n\n-----\n\n**NCIIPC NEWSLETTER** **PAGE 3**\n\n\n**Ransomware Attack on UHBVN Billing Data**\n\n\n### Hackers demanded ransom in Bitcoins in order to retrieve the\n data.\n\n “In order to ensure better monitoring, it is\n important to have unfettered supervisory access to data stored\n with these system\n providers.” - RBI \n\n\n_Source: http://www.newindianexpress.com_\n\nOn March 22, computers screens of ‘Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran\nNigam’ flashed a message in which hackers demanded\nransom in Bitcoins in order to retrieve the data. UHBVN monitors\nelectricity billing of nine districts of Haryana and with this cyberattack, billing data of thousands of customers was affected. A\ncase was registered in Panchkula under IT Act and different\nsections of IPC. UHVBN claimed that the cyber-attack on\nAutomatic Meter Reading System did not affect the billing of\nabout 4,000 Industrial consumers as backup of the same was\navailable with the Nigam. An official of the Nigam told that\nthere was no loss of billing data and the billing consumers\nwould not be affected.\n\n**All Payment Operators to Store Payments Data within India Only**\n\n\n_Source: https://rbi.org.in/_\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6[th] April directed Payments\nSystem providers to ensure that the entire data relating to\npayment systems operated by them is stored in India only. This\ndata should include the full end-to-end transaction details /\ninformation collected / carried / processed as part of the\nmessage / payment instruction. RBI has also directed Payment\nOperators to conduct an audit by CERT-IN empanelled auditors\ncertifying completion of activity. “It is observed that not all\n_system providers store the payments data in India.

The statement from\nEPFO came after news reports suggested that the retirement\nfund body had informed the Ministry of Electronics and IT of a\n‘data theft’. EPFO also informed that it has taken advance\naction by ‘closing the server and host service through Common\nService Centres pending vulnerability checks as part of the\ndata security and protection’. Further it added that ‘No\nconfirmed data leakage has been established or observed so\nfar. As such, there is nothing to be concerned about the news\nitem.

Kaspersky Lab experts\nanalysed OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and discovered\nthat implementations of the protocol contained code design\nand writing errors. Overall, 17 zero-day vulnerabilities were\nidentified and reported to the developers. These vulnerabilities\ncould result in heavy damage to industry. There was risk of\nDenial-of-Service to industrial systems by disrupting or shutting\ndown industrial processes. The remote code execution\nvulnerability allows attackers to send any kind of server\ncommands to control industrial processes, or continue their\nintrusion into the network.\n\n**US Company Fined for Noncompliance with Security Standards**\n\n_Source: https://www.tripwire.com/_\n\nA US-based power company has been given a notice of\npenalty regarding non-compliance with cybersecurity\nstandards.\n\n\n### \"No confirmed data\n leakage has been\n established or observed so far.

The data was exposed publicly on the Internet for 70\ndays which includes the usernames of the database and its\ncryptographic information. This would increase the risk of a\nmalicious attacker gaining both physical and remote access to\nthe Critical Systems. The company has agreed to pay a $2.7\nmillion penalty, if approved, the multimillion-dollar fine would be\nthe largest ever in the energy industry involving compliance\nwith cybersecurity regulations.\n\n**Australia Passed the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill**\n\n_Source: https://www.zdnet.com/_\n\nAustralia’s Parliament passed the Security of Critical\nInfrastructure Bill in March 2018 to protect the electricity, gas,\nports, and water sectors from ‘foreign involvement’ that could\nlead to espionage, sabotage, and coercion. It also gives\nMinisters the power to direct companies to conduct risk\nmitigation actions. Under s32(2), the Australian Security\nIntelligence Organisation can provide advice to the Minister in\nthe form of a security assessment, with the Minister then able to\n‘direct critical infrastructure owners or operators to do or not do\na certain thing to mitigate a risk that has been identified as\nprejudicial to security’. The government also launched Critical\nInfrastructure Centre last year that works across electricity,\nwater, ports, and telecommunications to conduct national\nsecurity risk assessments and make suggestions for mitigation\nstrategies.\n\n**Investigators Slam NASA for Cybersecurity Shortcomings**\n\n_Source: https://www.nextgov.com/_\n\nRecent reports from the Government Accountability Office\n(GAO) identified weaknesses in NASA’s (National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration) IT management practices for\nstrategic planning, workforce planning, governance, and\ncybersecurity. GAO found that the agency’s IT strategy fails to\ncomply with Government best practices. The Chief Information\nOfficer (CIO) planned to develop and begin implementing an\nagency wide cybersecurity strategy by September 2016, but\ninvestigators said that no such plan has been drafted. NASA’s\nCIO told GAO that the agency will soon begin rolling out a\nstrategy based on the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology’s cybersecurity framework. The NASA Inspector\nGeneral also highlighted numerous shortcomings in the Security\nOperations Centre, which was founded in 2007 with the intent\nof becoming the agency’s ‘cybersecurity nerve centre’.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 6** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\n**Canadian Banks Warn: Hackers Might have Stolen Data**\n\n_Source: http://www.cbc.ca/_\n\nOn May 28, two major Canadian banks: Bank of Montreal and\nonline bank Simplii Financial — owned by Canadian Imperial\nBank of Commerce (CIBC) warned that hackers might have\naccessed the personal and financial information of nearly\n90,000 customers. Hackers threatened to make this information\npublic unless the lenders pay a $1-million ransom in\ncryptocurrency ‘Ripple’. In an email the hackers said that they\naccessed information such as names, account numbers,\npasswords, security questions and answers, and even social\ninsurance numbers and account balances, by exploiting\nweaknesses in the two banks' security systems. They used\nalgorithm to get account numbers, which allowed them to\npose as authentic account holders who had simply forgotten\ntheir password which was apparently enough to allow them\nto reset the backup security questions and answers, giving them\naccess to the account. Both banks are in contact of those who\nhave been affected and are providing instruction on how to\nmonitor their accounts for suspicious activity.\n\n## Trends\n\n**Use of Power Lines to Steal Data from Air-gapped Computers**\n\n_Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04014.pdf_\n\nPowerHammer is a new type of attack that uses the power lines\nto steal data from air-gapped computers. In this case, a\nmalicious code running on a compromised computer can\ncontrol power consumption of the system by intentionally\nregulating the CPU utilization. Data is modulated, encoded,\nand transmitted on top of the current flow fluctuations, and\nthen it is conducted and propagated through the power lines.\nThis phenomenon is known as a ’conducted emission’. There\nare two versions of this attack. First, Line level power-hammering\nattack, in which the attacker taps the in-home powerlines that\nare directly attached to the electrical outlet. Second, Phase\nlevel power-hammering attack, in which the attacker taps the\npower lines at the phase level, in the main electrical service\npanel. In both versions of the attack, the attacker measures the\nemission conducted and then decodes the data.\n\n\n### Hackers threatened to\n make this information\n public unless the lenders pay a $1 million ransom in\n cryptocurrency\n ‘Ripple’.\n\n The attacker measures\n the emission conducted and then\n decodes the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NCIIPC NEWSLETTER** **PAGE 7**\n\n\n### Nearly 40 percent of\n all Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in energy\n organizations protected by Kaspersky Lab solutions\n were attacked by\n malware at least\n once. \n\n_Ed Skoudis, James Lyne and Johannes_\n\n_Ullrich_\n\n\n**Kaspersky Threat Landscape Report for ICS**\n\n_Source: https://www.automation.com/_\n\nKaspersky Lab released a report on, ‘Threat Landscape for\nIndustrial Automation Systems in H2 2017’.

Attackers have demonstrated they\nhave the inclination and resource to diversify their attacks\nwhich opens up new and concerning possibilities.\n\n_Attackers Monetize Compromised Systems Using Crypto-Miners:_\nMost commonly stolen data like credit card numbers has\ndropped significantly in value. Attackers will instead install\ncrypto coin miners. These attacks are stealthier and less likely to\nbe discovered.\n\n_Hardware Flaws: Hardware is no less complex then software_\nand mistakes have been made just as they are made in\nsoftware. Patching hardware is a lot more difficult and often\nnot possible without replacing entire systems or suffering\nsignificant performance penalties.\n\n**IBM Banned its Staff from Using Removable Storage Devices**\n\n_Source: http://www.theregister.co.uk/_\n\nIBM banned its staff from using removable storage devices\n(e.g.: USB, SD card, flash drive). The move is to minimise the\npossible financial and reputational damage from misplaced,\nlost or misused removable portable storage devices. IBM\nemployees are advised to use company’s sync ‘n’ share\nservice to move data around. Parts of IBM have already been\nworking without portable drives, but the ban now reportedly\nextends to all employees worldwide.\n\n**IETF Released TLS Version 1.3**\n\n_Source: http://www.theregister.co.uk/_\n\nThe IETF finalized Transportation Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 version\nafter 28 drafts. TLS 1.3 protocol provides unparalleled privacy\nand performance compared to previous versions of TLS. With\nTLS 1.3, HTTPS performance has been made faster and safer for\nevery user and every device. TLS 1.3 stopped supporting many\nof the older encryption algorithms that TLS 1.2 supports that over\nthe years people have managed to find holes in. The new\nprotocol aims to comprehensively thwart any attempts by the\neavesdroppers to decrypt intercepted HTTPS connections.

Dragonfly campaign is\n a multi-stage intrusion\n attack, which first targets intermediate\n subjects and finally\n compromises the\n Industrial Control\n Systems of OT. \n\n\n**NCIIPC NEWSLETTER** **PAGE 9**\n\n\n**Multi-Stage Intrusion Campaign Against CII by Nation States**\n\n_Sh. Mohammed Zaki Ahmed, Sectoral Coordinator, Power, NCIIPC_\n\nRecently US-CERT issued an alert on a nation state cyber\nactivity targeting Energy, Nuclear, Commercial Facilities, Water,\nAviation, and Critical Manufacturing Sectors of United States [[1]].\nThis alert refers Symantec Dragonfly reports published on 06\nSeptember 2017 [[2]]. Symantec has been chasing Dragonfly\ngroup since 2011, however their report of September 2017\nspeaks about ‘Dragonfly 2.0’, which is based on their\nassessment of group’s activities since 2015. Confirmed targets of\nthe Dragonfly campaign include US, Canada and Turkey.\nDragonfly campaign is a multi-stage intrusion attack, which first\ntargets intermediate subjects and finally compromises the\nIndustrial Control Systems of OT.\n\nMotive behind the attack may be intelligence gathering,\nsabotage or holding backdoors for future exploitation. The\nattack methodology involves usage of Spear Phishing Emails,\nTrojan Software, and Watering Hole Websites for compromising\nintermediate targets. Intermediate targets may be subjects\ndealing with Business or IT or Safety Networks. Once the\nattacker has access to the Business/IT Network, it sets its\nCommand and Control Centre (CNC-1) and tries to exploit ICS\nsystems of the OT through various vulnerabilities such as SMB,\nNetBIOS; and sets up a web shell (Web/Email) server as\nCommand and Control Centre (CNC-2), where it uploads\ndifferent modules for further exploitation and communication. A\nsecure VPN access is created for communication between\nvictims and the CNC-2. Attackers are able to collect snapshots\nof the HMI Workstations of OT.\n\n_Mitigation Strategy: Organisations may thwart such attacks by_\nfollowing Cyber Security best practices with due diligence:\n\n - Implement Patch Management practices for ICS\ncomponents. Update firmware as and when available.\n\n - Segregate ICS network from Enterprise or Business Network.\n\nIf feasible keep the ICS systems air-gapped.\n\n - Use multi-factor authentication such as biometric access\n\ncontrol for allowing access to ICS/OT from other zones.\n\n - Segregate Safety Systems such as SIS from ICS. Configure\n\ndifferent zones through a firewall.\n\n - Explore possibility of deploying data diodes. This will enable\n\nunidirectional data flow and may help in avoiding\nCommand-and-Control operations of malware.\n\n - Generate awareness in employees for Phishing Attacks and\n\nCyber Security.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 10** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\n\n - Establish Security Operation Centre and monitor ICS traffic\n\nfor security anomalies. ICS devices have a static pattern of\ncommunication over DNP/MODBUS/ICCP/IEC. Any\nabnormal pattern such as a device trying to connect with\nunknown IP Addresses should be monitored and incident\nalert should be issued on priority.\n\n_References:_\n\n[1] https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A\n\n[2] https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat\nintelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks\n\n[3] https://www.scmagazine.com/dragonfly-apt-group-may\nbe-prepping-to-sabotage-us-power-facilities-reportwarns/article/687017/\n\n**AI in Cyber Defence: New Vista for Security Professionals**\n\n_Sh. Shiv Charan Kataria, Analyst, NCIIPC_\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the buzz words\nsince last couple of years. The sophistication of technology to\nhandle big data coupled with Machine Learning and Artificial\nIntelligence has simplified our lives. As businesses and\nGovernments have already adopted Artificial Intelligence and\nMachine Learning, its potential to handle Cyber Security is more\napparent. The sophistication and readily available technology\nsolutions has put Hackers and businesses head-to-head. The\nhackers are able to develop more sophisticated threats and\nbusinesses are looking to implement Artificial Intelligence in\nadvanced threat prevention and mitigation. Some of the\nusages are as follows:\n\n - Re-writing encryption keys continuously to enhance\nsecurity.\n\n - Auto analyse network traffic as Advanced Warning System\n\nthat gives extra layer of protection.\n\n - Identification of vulnerabilities.\n\n - Handling of insider’s threat using behavioural and policy\n\nbreach analysis.\n\nThe real challenge now is to have more expertise in this field.\nAccording to Centre for Cyber Safety and Education there will\nbe a short fall of 1.8 million cyber security professionals by 2022.\nFurther as the existing technologies will mature, organizations\nwill require more expertise in the field to tackle Cyber Security\nrelated issues.\n\n\n### As businesses and Governments have\n already adopted Artificial Intelligence\n and Machine Learning, its potential\n to handle Cyber\n Security is more\n apparent.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: https://cyf4.com_\n\n### Many of the infected\n devices have known public exploits and use\n default credentials,\n meaning that customers who set up\n their home router out of the box and never\n changed the password or updated the firmware could be\n at a higher risk.\n\n\n**NCIIPC NEWSLETTER** **PAGE 11**\n\n\nThis is pertinent for organizations to take advantage of this\nadvancing AI and ML technology.

Niraj Vishnoi, Threat Researcher, NCIIPC_\n\nIn last three months there have been series of reports pointing\nto attacks on Routers. On 25[th] May Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) issued an urgent bulletin [[1]] for anyone with a\nhome or small office router to immediately turn it off and then\nturn it on again as a way to temporarily thwart the spread of\nforeign malware. The malware, called VPNFilter [[2]] targets small\nhome and office routers. Once a router is infected, the hackers\nwould potentially be able to use the device as a jumping-off\npoint to launch further attacks. Talos, the security arm of Cisco\nreported that at least 500,000 devices in at least 54 countries\nhave been infected. Devices manufactured by Linksys, MikroTik,\nNetgear and TP-Link were among those found to have been\naffected, according to the Talos report. Many of the infected\ndevices have known public exploits and use default\ncredentials, meaning that customers who set up their home\nrouter out of the box and never changed the password or\nupdated the firmware could be at a higher risk [[3]].\n\nIn the month of April, United States and United Kingdom issued\na joint statement that state-sponsored hackers are leveraging\nvulnerabilities in routers and other network infrastructure devices\nto target governments, private-sector organizations,\ninfrastructure providers, and ISPs.\n\nKaspersky Lab reported that a targeted phishing campaign\ncalled Roaming Mantis, found primarily in South Korea,\nchanged DNS settings on routers, pointing users to malicious\nwebsites that, in turn, prompted users to ‘update’ apps on\nAndroid phones to deliver a payload that harvested\ncredentials, including those for two-factor authentication [[4]].\n\nAkamai published a report detailing coordinated abuse of\nflawed implementations of UPnP on routers allowing hackers to\ninject NAT rules, creating a proxy for hackers to disguise the\norigin of their traffic. Akamai's report indicated 65,000 routers\ncompromised in this way, with over 4.8 million routers potentially\nvulnerable [[5]].\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 12** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\nIn March, a report from Kaspersky Lab detailed the Slingshot\nmalware, which targeted individuals, government agencies,\nand organizations located primarily in Kenya, Yemen, Libya,\nand Afghanistan. Mikrotik routers were leveraged in the\nSlingshot malware attack [[6-7]].\n\nMost of these routers are at ‘always-on’ condition and rarely\nupdated. Since routers play important role in normal network\noperations, so utilization of these devices in man-in-the-middle\nattacks is extremely attractive for attackers. Considering the\nmultitude of Router models and the difficulty of supporting and\nupdating so many devices, make these devices low hanging\nfruit for hackers. A compromised router can also serve as a\nplatform for attacking other devices on your local network,\nsuch as your phone or laptop, or for launching denial-of-service\nattacks against Internet websites. Router exposed to the\noutside world, is frequently targeted by automated scans,\nprobes and exploits. Compared to other IT devices, router\ndoesn't have an antivirus program or other security software to\nprotect it.\n\n_References:_\n\n[1] https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180525.aspx\n\n[2] https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html\n\n[3] https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/fbi-warns-about\nrussia-linked-malware-threat-home-routers-questions-n878276\n\n[4] https://securelist.com/roaming-mantis-uses-dns-hijacking-to\ninfect-android-smartphones/85178/\n\n[5] https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/white\n\npaper/upnproxy-blackhat-proxies-via-nat-injections-whitepaper.pdf\n\n[6] https://securelist.com/apt-slingshot/84312/\n\n[7] https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-router-based\nattacks-could-be-the-next-big-trend-in-cybersecurity/\n\n**Threat Assessment for Telecom Sector**\n\nSh.

Security\n hardening documentation is usually sparse and\n tightly held by the vendors themselves. \n\n\nHowever, cyber-criminals don’t care for such economic\nrealities, and they have begun to increasingly target telecom\ninfrastructure, especially as it becomes IP-based. This combined\nwith increasing regulations towards telecom security have\ncreated quite a challenge that companies are seeking to\naddress. There are varieties of security issues – some of which\nare solvable, while others will remain known risks till cost-feasible\nmeasures can be found to address them.\n\n_Telecom Security Threats:_\n\nMajor threats to Telecom Security usually fall into the following\ncategories:\n\n- Phone Fraud: Toll Fraud, Cramming, Telemarketing fraud,\nWar dialling and so on\n\n- Theft: Data theft, network abuse, illegal data interception,\nunauthorized data modification (in billing or routing based\nprocesses)\n\n- Malware: Viruses, Trojan horse\n\n- Spam: Sending spam messages via SMS, MMS\n\n- DDoS Attacks: Distributed Denial of Service attacks\nconstitute the great threat to the accessibility of the\ntelecom providers. These attacks occur frequently and may\ntarget authorities, companies and citizens. DDoS attacks\nare carried out online and, to a lesser extent, via mobile\nnetworks, against telecom service providers, their\ncustomers, and the telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n- Data Leakage: Penetrating billing and CRM systems to\nextract customer data\n\nTypical Security Challenges:\n\nTelecom companies face the following security challenges:\n\n- Lack of Vendor’s Concern: Major telecom equipment\nproviders are not always the most security conscious\ninfrastructure providers out there. Security hardening\ndocumentation is usually sparse and tightly held by the\nvendors themselves.\n\n- Lack of Security Awareness: Many security teams in telecom\ncompanies are not aware of various security parameters in\nwhich equipments can be hardened. Equipemnts being\nused with default configurations causes security challenges.\n\n- Absence of Proper Testing Setup: Few companies have\nproper test setups where equipment can be scanned and\nhardened to ensure that vulnerabilities are fixed, yet\nproductivity isn’t being hampered.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 14** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\n\n- Lack of Monitoring: Effective monitoring systems that can\ntrace to individual operator along with details of the\ntimestamp, system from which the command was run, and\nthe actual user running the command must be\nimplemented.\n\n- Supply Chain Risks: In today’s global threat landscape,\ngovernment sponsored intrusions into the integrity of\ntelecom equipment has created concerns for India. In other\ncountries the regulators have stepped in to ensure that\nequipment is tested in an accredited lab.\n\n**Threats for BFSI Sector**\n\nSh. Aniruddha Kumar, Sectoral Coordinator, BFSI, NCIIPC\n\nBFSI Sector remains one of the major targets of rouge actors.\nBased on various sources/feeds, following are some of the\nmajor attack vectors for BFSI sector:\n\n- _Ransomware & Crypto Currencies: In a ransomware attack,_\nfraudsters demand ransom amount in cryptocurrencies like\nBitCoin etc. In last couple of years, these attacks have\nincreased significantly, thus posing considerable risk to\nNational Critical Information Infrastructure (NCII).\nRansomware as a Service (RaaS) is also available online. So\nfar, the most sophisticated ransomware attack in BFSI sector\nhas been the Black Swan attack.\n\n- _Social Engineering Attacks: Social Engineering attacks like_\nPhishing, Vishing, Card Skimming and Spoofing are still\npopular in the BFSI sector.\n\n- _Rogue Apps: Fraudsters are also targeting the legitimate_\nand proprietary mobile apps developed by the financial\nservice providers. After tweaking some of the functionalities\nof the Apps, the culprits are hosting these rogue Apps on\nthird party websites other than the Google Play Store.\n\n- _Deep Web and Dark Web: Information like Credit/Debit_\ncards, bank account credentials, data base leaks, internal\nnetwork schema, employee details, customers detail etc.\npertaining to BFSI sector is available for sale on Dark Web.\n\n## Malware Bytes\n\n**Ransomware Hits HPE iLO Remote Management Interfaces**\n\n_Source: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com_\n\nHPE Integrated Lights-Out (HPE iLO 4), a management\nprocessor, is under the radar of attackers. These processors are\nbuilt into certain HP servers that allow administrators to remotely\nadminister the device. One can connect to the iLO using a\nweb browser or mobile app and will be greeted with a login\npage.\n\n\n### In other countries the\n regulators have stepped in to ensure\n that equipment is\n tested in an accredited lab. \n\n_Source: http://www.channelworld.in_\n\n### The information like Credit/Debit cards,\n bank account credentials, data base\n leaks, internal network\n schema, employee\n details, customers details etc. pertaining\n to the stakeholders of BFSI sector is available\n for sale on Dark Web.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NCIIPC NEWSLETTER** **PAGE 15**\n\n\n### Shodan shows that\n over 5,000 iLO 4\n devices are connected to the\n Internet and are\n vulnerable. \n\n The cybercriminals’ app installed in card chip can say a PIN is valid; no matter what\n PIN was entered. \n\n The document asks\n the user to enable macros in order to prove that the user is\n not a robot.\n\n\nThe ransomware that has been discovered recently has a\n‘Security Notice’ at HPE iLO 4 login screen saying that the\ncomputer's hard drives are encrypted with RSA 2048\nasymmetric encryption and that the owners would have to pay\nfew Bitcoins to get the data back. Hence, it is advisable not to\nconnect iLO 4 to the Internet (use secure VPN) as Shodan shows\nthat over 5,000 iLO 4 devices are connected to the Internet\nwhich are vulnerable.\n\n**Clone Chip-and-PIN Cards**\n\n_Source: https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/chip-n-pin-cloning/21502/_\n\nKaspersky researchers discovered a group of cyber crooks from\nBrazil who has developed a way to steal card data and\nsuccessfully clone chip-and-PIN cards. Brazilian group called\nPrilex uses malware to infect Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals and\ncollect card data. When a customer makes payment at a shop\nwhose POS terminal is infected, the card data is transferred\nright away to the criminals. To steal money, they also needed to\nbe able to clone cards. The Prilex group developed a whole\ninfrastructure that lets create cloned cards. The card-cloners\ncreated an application for cards to run. The application tells\nthe POS terminal not to perform data authentication. That\nmeans no cryptographic operations, sparing them the nearimpossible task of obtaining the card’s private cryptographic\nkeys. But that still leaves PIN authentication. The app installed in\ncard chip can say a PIN is valid; no matter what PIN was\nentered. That means that one can simply enter four random\ndigits — and they’ll always be accepted.\n\n**GravityRAT Malware Targeting Indian Entities**\n\n_Source: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/_\n\nCisco Talos reported a new piece of malware called\nGravityRAT. This malware has been under development for last\ntwo years, during which the developer has implemented new\nfeatures like file exfiltration, remote command execution\ncapability and anti-vm techniques. The majority of the\nmalicious documents crafted by the malware author are\nMicrosoft Office Word documents. The attacker uses an\nembedded macro in order to execute malicious code on the\nvictim's system. The document asks the user to enable macros\nin order to prove that the user is not a robot. By enabling\nmacros, the malware is able to begin its execution. The\nmalware author uses a versioning system starting by the G\nletter. The oldest version we identified is G1.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 16** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\nAll the malicious Office documents, and more specifically the\ndocuments used to test antivirus on VirusTotal, were submitted\nfrom Pakistan. It was found that across all of the C2 domains\nlisted, a large influx of traffic was originated from India. All of the\nC2 domains were at least 50 percent requested by Indian IP\ninfrastructure. This actor is probably not the most advanced\nactor as seen. But it managed to stay under the radar since\n2016. They worked on malicious code, and produced four\nvariants. Each new variant included new features. The\ndeveloper used the same C2 infrastructure all this time. The\ndeveloper was clever enough to keep this infrastructure safe,\nand not have it blacklisted by a security vendor. The actor took\ntheir time to ensure they were not within a virtual environment\nto avoid analysis. However, they did not take any time at all to\nattempt to obfuscate their .NET code. The code was largely\ntrivial to reverse engineer, which meant static analysis was an\neasy option for this piece of malware.\n\n**Malware Avoids Infecting Government and Military Networks**\n\n_Source: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/_\n\nSecurity experts have discovered a new malware GoScanSSH\nthat targets vulnerable Linux-based systems and tries its best to\navoid infecting devices on government and military networks. It\nscans the IP on port 22, looking for an open SSH port. If the IP\nhas an open SSH port, the malware runs to see if the IP hosts\nany websites/domains of the following TLDs — .mil, .gov,. army,.\nairforce, .navy, .gov.uk, .mil.uk, .govt.uk, .mod.uk, .gov.au,\n.govt.nz, .mil.nz, .parliament.nz, .gov.il, .muni.il, .idf.il, .gov.za,\n.mil.za, .gob.es, .police.uk. If not, the malware uses a list of over\n7,000 user-password combos to guess the SSH credentials.\nWhen the malware finds the remote device SSH credentials, it\nreports back to its Command & Control server located on the\nDark Web (communications occur via Tor2Web proxies).\n\n**VPNFilter Malware Targets at least 500K Devices Worldwide**\n\n_Source: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html_\n\nCisco Talos reported a sophisticated modular malware called\n‘VPNFilter’ which overlaps with versions of the Black Energy\nmalware, which was responsible for multiple large-scale attacks\nin Ukraine. It is actively infecting Ukrainian hosts at an alarming\nrate, utilizing a command and control infrastructure dedicated\nto that country. Devices on the perimeter of the network, with\nno intrusion protection system in place, and typically no\navailable host-based protection system such as an anti-virus\npackage are its target. Current estimate states that at least\n500,000 devices in at least 54 countries are infected.

APT36 intrusion campaigns which are\nactive since 2013 reflect a concerted effort to target India,\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United\nNations (UN) that have a stake in the region. Diplomatic and\nmilitary personnel of India have been the target of the majority\nof APT36 campaigns. Open Sources indicate that Indian\nembassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan have also been\ntargeted. APT36 uses social engineering emails, often spoofed\nto appear as if they originate from official personnel that\ninclude malicious attachments or links. APT36 has also used\ncompromised websites as vectors for malware delivery.\nSpoofed personas have included an employee of an Indian\nnews organization, Afghanistan's ambassador to the U.S., and\nthe Afghan Minister of Finance. Malicious attachments of APT36\nhave leveraged Office exploits CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2015-1641,\nCVE-2015-1770, CVE-20103333, and CVE-2017-0199. Links direct\nvictims to malicious payloads hosted on fake or compromised\nwebsites. APT36 employs open-source and custom malware\ntools that range in functionality from keystroke logging to\ntargeting USB devices. SEEGAP malware propagates via USB,\nwhich may facilitate targeting of air-gapped networks used for\nsensitive military or diplomatic information. One of the APT36\nmalware has a feature that queries Google maps API through\nthe registered domain ‘shareboxs.net’ to display information\nabout victims' IP addresses, including satellite imagery of the\nregion.\n\n## Learning\n\n**Big Data Security for Critical Information Infrastructure Protection**\n\n_Sh.

Abhijeet Raj Shrivastava, Sectoral Coordinator, Transport and Sh._\n_Vijay Kant Verma, Analyst, NCIIPC_\n\nShip industry is reliant on a range of electronic devices and\nsoftware systems to operate efficiently in modern digital era,\nwhich includes complex cargo management systems,\nAutomatic Identification Systems (AIS), Global Positioning\nSystems (GPS) and Electronic Chart Displays and Information\nSystems (ECDIS). Automated terminals reduce unnecessary box\nmoves, shorten cycle times, and enables consistent and\npredictable throughput numbers. Fully-automated terminals\nhave the advantage of low operating costs and reliable\noperations. Automation does offer major port hubs better\npredictability and consistency of container moves per hour.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 20** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\nAt the same time, automation reduces the environmental\nimpact since terminals are mostly electrified, giving ports an\nadditional competitive edge in an industry increasingly focused\non sustainability. However, full automation of port management\nhas increased vulnerability surface to cyber risks. This is due to\nthe use of technologically advanced and networked systems.\n\n_Cyber Risks:_\n\n - Lack or missing Cyber Crisis Management mechanism,\n\nBusiness continuity plan / Disaster recovery plan in ports also\nrisk the national economy.\n\n - The difficulty with protecting automated terminals from\n\ncyber risks lies with their complexity. These terminals use\nindustrial control systems that translate sensorial data and\ncommands into mechanical actions. The network links\nbetween mechanical equipment and sensors are exposed\nto the same threats as data networks.\n\n - Operational systems and data networks are not always\n\nupdated /patched or properly secured, allowing\nunauthorized actor to gain comparatively easy access to\ninformation.\n\n - Industrial control systems are not designed with cyber risks or\n\nactive network monitoring in mind. This is especially true for\nships’ control systems, but can also affect the system\ncomponents of ports.\n\n - Personal details of ship crews can still be easily accessed,\n\nmaking them more vulnerable to social engineering via\nphishing or other techniques, unknowingly granting access\nto systems.\n\n_Prevention Mechanism against Cyber Risk in Ports:_\n\n - To prevent the ports and shipping industry from most\n\nattacks, regular operating system updates, stronger\npasswords, secure satellite connections, resilience exercises,\ninformation sharing, and employee awareness campaigns\nshould be practiced.\n\n - Major shipping hubs are part of large and less resilient\n\nsupply chains, which are essential for regional and\ninternational trade. These supply chains depend on a small\nnumber of key ports, which are vulnerable to shocks from\nother ports. To make supply chains and port hubs more\nresilient to cyber risks, the shipping industry as a whole will\nhave to adjust and prepare.\n\n - Major port operators will have to work together and share\n\ninformation on previous or ongoing attacks to NCIIPC and\nother Government organization, so that experiences and\nbest practices can be shared directly. Agencies are able to\nprovide incident response in time.\n\n\n### Full automation of port\n management has increased vulnerability\n surface to cyber risks.

Ashok Kumar Gupta, Analyst, Telecom, NCIIPC_\n\nSignalling System 7 (SS7) is an international telecommunication\nstandard that defines how network elements in a Public\nSwitched Telephone Network (PSTN) exchange information over\na digital signalling network. Nodes in an SS7 network are called\nsignalling points. SS7 is also called Common Channel Signalling\n7 (CCS7).\n\nAttackers could exploit security holes in SS7 to track users'\nmovements, communications and eavesdrop on conversations\nas demonstrated by security researchers in Germany. The\nattack in question is essentially a man-in-the-middle attack on\ncell phone communications that, among other things, exploits\nthe lack of authentication in the communication protocols that\nrun on top of SS7. The possibility of Denial-of-Service attack also\ncannot be ruled out.\n\nHowever, mobile community is working to address these threats\nThe GSMA, security vendors and mobile operators are\ncollaborating to better understand sophisticated adversaries'\nmeans and ways of exploiting networks. Future networks require\nthe same degree of protection across all network types, be it\nGSM, CDMA or LTE.

The purpose of this library is\nto defend Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against Adversarial\nAttacks. DNN is the machine learning model inspired by the\nhuman brain. DNN can be used for identifying objects in an\nimage, translations or finding vulnerability in software. However,\nthe DNN model is vulnerable to Adversarial Attack wherein\nsystem is given specially crafted input to make it mistake. The\nART library written in Python uses state-of-the-art algorithms for\ncreating adversarial examples as well as novel defence\ntechniques for defending DNNs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PAGE 26** **NCIIPC NEWSLETTER**\n\n\nThe primary intention of the library is to improve the adversarial\nattacks against visual recognition systems and other data\nmodes such as speech, text or time series will be taken into\naccount in future.\n\n**PhishProtect Beta**\n\n_Source: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/_\n\nThe team from Phish.ai has released a Google Chrome\nextension that can detect when users are accessing domains\nspelled using non-standard Unicode characters and warn the\nusers about the potential of a homograph attack. Some\nbrowsers have fought back by replacing the Unicode\ncharacters with Punycode, an ASCII-based representation of\nUnicode characters. For example, instead of coịnbạse.com,\nsome browsers like Edge or Vivaldi will show xn--conbsezc8b7m.com instead, clearly highlighting that there's something\nwrong with the URL. But Chrome and Firefox do not show the\nPunycode version of the URL by default. Chrome, displays the\nURL Punycode version in the title bar, but not the address bar.\nThis is where Phish.ai's extension comes to help, by showing a\nbig red window every time the user is attempting to access a\ndomain containing Unicode characters.\n\n**Detecting Phishing Domains using Certificate Transparency**\n\n_Source: https://www.facebook.com/_\n\nFacebook released ‘Certificate Transparency Monitoring Tool’\nwhich is used to detect mis-issued TLS certificates. This tool\nallows anybody to search observed certificates via CT logs and\nsubscribe to domains one might be interested in monitoring.\nFacebook has extended the capabilities of this tool by sending\nalerts when certificates are issued for potential phishing\ndomains. Whenever a new certificate appears in any public\nCertificate Transparency Log, the tool analyses the domains\nspecified by the certificate for phishing attempts by taking into\nconsideration the most common spoofing techniques — such\nas homograph attacks, combo squatting, typo-squatting etc. If\nthe domain looks suspicious, i.e., likely associated with phishing,\nit can notify subscribers.\n\n\n### Warn the users about\n the potential of a homograph attack.\n\n_Certificate Transparency Monitoring_\n\n_tool returning certificate results for_\n\n_facebook.com_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Microsoft demonstrated a new\n project codenamed Trusted Cyber Physical\n Systems to provide security for Internet of\n Things and Industrial\n Control Systems\n devices. \n\n\n**NCIIPC NEWSLETTER** **PAGE 27**\n\n\n**Trusted Cyber Physical Systems**\n\n_Source: https://blogs.windows.com/_\n\nAgainst the backdrop of recent attacks with Trisis/Triton\nmalware, Microsoft has demonstrated a new project\ncodenamed Trusted Cyber Physical Systems (TCPS) at Hannover\nMesse 2018 in Germany to provide security for Internet of Things\n(IoT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) devices. It is a tricomponent system where the first one is a hardware-level\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, ARM\nTrustZone, and SecureElements which process highly-sensitive\ninformation. The second one is a graphical user interface (GUI)\nwhich according to Microsoft is a ‘Secure Confirmation\nTerminal’ operated by a trusted employee. The third and last\none is a cloud-based platform that could be used for\nprovisioning, key management, certificate authority, patch\nmanagement, and tamper-proof logging. Also, one of the most\nimportant properties of TCPS is protection for data in\nexecution— by utilizing TEEs.\n\n## NCIIPC Initiatives\n\n**Integrity Checker**\n\nNCIIPC has developed a windows based utility named ‘Integrity\nChecker’ to calculate and verify the hash of any file input. Hash\nvalue, considered as the fingerprint of a file is processed\nthrough cryptographic algorithm. If contents of file are altered\nin any way, the hash value will be significantly different. This\nutility supports MD5, SHA1, SHA128, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512\nfunctions and can work across various windows platforms. It is\nalso easy to be operated by personnel with limited exposure to\ntechnology.\n\n**NCIIPC at India-U.S. Cooperation on Global Security**\n\nNational Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) and the\nCommittee on International Security and Arms Control (CISAC)\nhave been engaged in the dialogue process on a regular basis\nand have been discussing issues of mutual security and safety\ninvolving nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear safety, space\nsecurity issues, cyber security, missile proliferation and terrorism.\nThis year’s Dialogue under the title of Strategic Threats of the\n21[st] Century was held on 2-4 May at Bangalore.
