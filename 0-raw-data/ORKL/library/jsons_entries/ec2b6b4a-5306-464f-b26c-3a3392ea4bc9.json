It's mostly just bots and trojans. But\nwe just found a new Internet worm, and it's spreading in the wild. The worm is called\n**Morto and it infects Windows workstations and servers. It uses a new spreading vector**\nthat we haven't seen before: RDP.\n\nRDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. Windows has built-in support for this\nprotocol via Windows Remote Desktop Connection. Once you enable a computer for\nremote use, you can use any other computer to access it.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen you connect to another computer with this tool, you can remotely use the\ncomputer, just like you'd use a local computer.\n\nOnce a machine gets infected, the Morto worm starts scanning the local network for\nmachines that have Remote Desktop Connection enabled. This creates a lot of traffic\n**for port 3389/TCP, which is the RDP port.**\n\nWhen Morto finds a Remote Desktop server, it tries logging in as Administrator and tries\na series of passwords:\n\n_admin_\n_password_\n_server_\n_test_\n_user_\n_pass_\n_letmein_\n\n\n-----\n\n_1234qwer_\n_1q2w3e_\n_1qaz2wsx_\n_aaa_\n_abc123_\n_abcd1234_\n_admin123_\n_111_\n_123_\n_369_\n_1111_\n_12345_\n_111111_\n_123123_\n_123321_\n_123456_\n_654321_\n_666666_\n_888888_\n_1234567_\n_12345678_\n_123456789_\n_1234567890_\n\nOnce you are connected to a remote system, you can access the drives of that server\nvia Windows shares such as \\\\tsclient\\c and \\\\tsclient\\d for drives C: and D:,\nrespectively. Morto uses this feature to copy itself to the target machine. It does this by\ncreating a temporary drive under letter A: and copying a file called a.dll to it.\n\nThe infection will create several new files on the system including\n**\\windows\\system32\\sens32.dll and**\n**\\windows\\offline web pages\\cache.txt.**\n\nMorto can be controlled remotely. This is done via several alternative servers, including\n**jaifr.com and qfsl.net.**\n\nWe've seen several different samples. Some MD5 hashes include:\n\n0c5728b3c22276719561049653c71b84\n14284844b9a5aaa680f6be466d71d95b\n58fcbc7c8a5fc89f21393eb4c771131d\n\n[More discussion on the topic at Technet forums.](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserversecurity/thread/31cf740c-818c-4863-8df9-0d9a1d6de6fc)\n\nWe detect Morto components as Backdoor:W32/Morto.A and Worm:W32/Morto.B.\n\n**Updated to add: here's** [a link to our description.](https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/worm_w32_morto_a.shtml)\n\n\n-----",
