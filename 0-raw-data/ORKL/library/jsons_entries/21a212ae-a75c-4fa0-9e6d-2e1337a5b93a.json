Our court case against Phosphorus, filed in the U.S. District Court for Washington\nD.C., resulted in a court order enabling us last week to take control of 99 websites the group\nuses to conduct its hacking operations so the sites can no longer be used to execute attacks.\n\nMicrosoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)\nhave been tracking Phosphorus since 2013. Its activity is usually designed to gain access to\nthe computer systems of businesses and government agencies and steal sensitive\ninformation. Its targets also include activists and journalists – especially those involved in\nadvocacy and reporting on issues related to the Middle East.\n\nPhosphorus typically attempts to compromise the personal accounts of individuals through a\ntechnique known as spear-phishing, using social engineering to entice someone to click on a\nlink, sometimes sent through fake social media accounts that appear to belong to friendly\n\n\n-----\n\ncontacts. The link contains malicious software that enables Phosphorus to access computer\nsystems.\n\nPhosphorus also uses a technique whereby it sends people an email that makes it seem as\nif there’s a security risk to their accounts, prompting them to enter their credentials into a web\nform that enables the group to capture their passwords and gain access to their systems.\n\nBoth attack methods employ the use of websites that incorporate the names of well-known\nbrands, like Microsoft, to appear authentic. Websites registered and used by Phosphorus\ninclude, for example, outlook-verify.net, yahoo-verify.net, verification-live.com, and\nmyaccount-services.net.\n\nWhile we’ve used daily security analytics tracking to stop individual Phosphorus attacks and\nnotify impacted customers, the action we executed last week enabled us to take control of\nwebsites that are core to its operations. Our work to track Phosphorus over multiple years\nand observe its activity enabled us to build a decisive legal case and execute last week’s\naction with confidence we could have significant impact on the group’s infrastructure.\n\nThe action we executed last week enabled us to take control of 99 websites and redirect\ntraffic from infected devices to our Digital Crime Unit’s sinkhole. The intelligence we collect\nfrom this sinkhole will be added to MSTIC’s existing knowledge of Phosphorus and shared\nwith Microsoft security products and services to improve detections and protections for our\ncustomers.\n\nThroughout the course of tracking Phosphorus, we’ve worked closely with a number of other\ntechnology companies, including Yahoo, to share threat information and jointly stop\nattacks. We are grateful for their partnership. We also worked with each domain listing\ncompany listed in our suit prior to filing it and are grateful for their support and help in\ntransferring the website domains registered by Phosphorus to us once a court order was\ngranted. Our case against Phosphorus is similar to cases we’ve filed against another threat\ngroup called Strontium. We have used this approach 15 times to take control of 91 fake\nwebsites associated with Strontium. The legal filings in our case against Phosphorus can be\n[found here.](http://noticeofpleadings.com/phosphorus/)\n\nTags: [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Digital Crimes Unit,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/digital-crimes-unit/) [Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-digital-crimes-unit/) Microsoft Threat\nIntelligence Center\n\n\n-----",
