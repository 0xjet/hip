    "plain_text": "# Sucuri Blog\n\n**blog.sucuri.net/2020/06/gibberish-hack.html**\n\nJustin Channell June 12, 2020\n\nDiscovering some random folder with numbers and letters you don’t remember on your\nwebsite would make any website owner put on their detective cap. At first, you may think,\n“Did I leave my FTP client open and my cat ran across the keyboard?”\n\nBut when you open the folder, you find a series of HTML files, each named with some kind of\nnonsensical phrases like “cheap-cool-hairstyles-photos.html.” If you open one of these files\non the browser, you’ll likely be redirected to something you’re not expecting, such as a\nsuspicious ecommerce site or an error page.\n\nThese are signs that your website was hit with a gibberish hack. Removing this hack is not\njust as easy as deleting a random folder. Even though it just seems like the hackers are\nputting a bunch of nonsense on your site as a defacement, these attacks are far more\n[nefarious than you’d expect. It works similar to the Japanese keyword hack we covered on](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/04/japanese-keyword-hack.html)\nthe blog earlier this month.\n\n## Random folder on a website\n\nHackers put random folders on websites to conceal pages with URLs that will look appealing\nin search results. Attackers sometimes store these URLs in folders with random numbers\nand letters. This is in the hope that less savvy website owners will assume that they are CMS\ncore files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe goal of a gibberish hack is to use a legitimate website s good standing with Google s\nsearch engine to generate traffic to another website. In the example from Google below, we\nsee some of the examples like “cheap-hair-styles-cool.html” and “free-pictures-fun.html.”\n\nHackers will make money by sending traffic to their sites, so they want to keep the hack\ngoing as long as possible. They will do this through cloaking – or hiding the content on your\nsite in a way that is hidden from you, but is visible to your visitors. There are many different\nmethods of cloaking. A basic cloaking techniques include formatting text to blend into the\nbackground color. A more sophisticated method involves injected code that displays one\npage when a search engine indexes the page, and a different page for a human visitor.\n\nThese methods can also be targeted in order to keep the malicious code secret from the\nwebsite owner. In this case, a gibberish page may display 404 error when the owner opens\nit, but redirect any visitors from a different IP address, location, or device.\n\nIf you are at all concerned about whether a random folder on your website is caused by a\ngibberish hack, you can use a free scanning tool like Sucuri’s [SiteCheck to scan your site.](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/)\nAlternatively, you can search your domain in Google with the site: _yourwebsiteurl. However,_\nyou will have to manually check for any suspicious URLs and content if Google hasn’t\nflagged your website yet.\n\n## How to remove folders with random numbers and letters\n\n\n-----\n\nTo clean up a gibberish hack, you may think it s as simple as just deleting the random folder\nwith numbers and letters and any HTML files created by the hackers. Unfortunately, it is likely\nthe hackers left an option to reinfect your website with more spammy content. As a result,\n[you will want to make sure your site is completely clean by following these steps.](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-a-hacked-website/)\n\n### Check Core File Integrity\n\nThe core files of your CMS are vital to making your website run, so they should never be\nmodified or removed. But hackers can make changes to these files, so you’ll need to make\n[sure they haven’t been tampered with. If you’re using WordPress, the Sucuri plugin is the](https://sucuri.net/wordpress-security-plugin/)\nquickest way to check your core files integrity.\n\nFor users of other CMS platforms, you can use the diff command in the terminal. If using the\ncommand line makes you nervous, you can check directories for recently modified files in\nyour FTP client. Just make sure to use FTPS, SFTP, or SSH and not unencrypted FTP to\nkeep that communication channel with your website secure. If you identify any core files that\nhave been compromised, replace them with a fresh copy or a clean backup.\n\n### Clean Hacked Files and Database Tables\n\nIf you have a recent backup that’s not infected, you’re in luck! You can just replace any\nhacked website files with fresh copies from the backup. If you do not have a backup, you’ll\nneed to manually edit malicious code from your website. It’s important to make a backup of\nthe site before doing this, as removing code can cause your website to stop functioning\nentirely. Make sure to test and verify the site is still operational after making any changes to\ncode.\n\nYou will also need to clean your database tables. The functions are used by plugins and\nextensions for legitimate reasons, but hackers can also take advantage of them. To do this\nyourself, it will require some manual searching and removal of suspicious content in your\nwebsite’s database. Again, make sure to do your backups before attempting.\n\n### Deal with the aftermath\n\nAfter your website has been scrubbed, you’ll have to deal with the aftermath, including your\nsite’s standing on Google’s search results page. All those gibberish pages are still in\nGoogle’s index. When users click those links, they will hit a “404 Not Found” error page,\n[which can damage SEO for the site. There are multiple solutions to resolving this problem](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/11/404-errors-search-console-spam-seo.html)\nincluding the URL removal tool in Google and editing the robots.txt file on your server.\n\nIf you’re feeling worried about breaking your website while trying to clean a gibberish hack,\n[you may want to seek assistance from a website security professional.](https://sucuri.net/website-security-platform/signup/)\n\n## Protect your website from the gibberish hack\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce you ve cleaned up a gibberish hack, the last thing you ll want to do is go through it all\n[again. That’s why it’s a good idea to protect and secure your website to prevent hackers from](https://sucuri.net/guides/website-security/)\ngaining access. While it’s impossible to guarantee hackers won’t find a way in, these best\npractices will be helpful in keeping your site away from bad actors.\n\n**Update everything – When website software is updated – whether it be for the CMS,**\nplugins, or themes – developers also patch vital security issues. Without these patches,\nyour website will be vulnerable to attacks. Because most attacks are automated by\nbots that scan for any opportunities to exploit website vulnerabilities, it is important to\nupdate your software as soon as possible. If you need to use outdated software on\nyour website for any reason, consider using a firewall option that allows for virtual\npatching of outdated software to ensure that those vulnerabilities are covered even\nwithout you updating the software.\n**Use strong passwords – Don’t reuse passwords on multiple accounts and make sure**\nthey are long and unique. Avoid using any distinguishable words, too. A good rule of\nthumb is that if you can say your password out loud, it can likely be compromised by\nhackers. If you’re not using a password manager, get one. These services will both\ngenerate strong passwords and keep track of them. Some popular choices include\n[LastPass,](https://www.lastpass.com/) [KeePass, and](https://keepass.info/) [1Password.](https://1password.com/)\n**One site per server or hosting account – Hosting many websites on a single account**\nwith your hosting provider seems like a great idea from a financial standpoint, but it’s\nterrible for website security. Hosting many sites in the same location creates a large\n[attack surface that will allow for cross-site contamination.](https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/11/10-tips-to-improve-your-website-security-2.html)\n**Principle of Least Privilege – Your website users may be targeted by an attacker. As**\na result, you’ll want to make sure to limit any administrator access and practice the\nprinciple of least privilege. This means only giving users a minimal set of privileges in\norder to perform an action and only granting them for the time required to complete\ntheir job.\n**Make frequent backups – Backups are crucial for recovering a website after it has**\nbeen compromised. Make sure your backups are stored off site, as you do not want\nhackers to be able to access and modify them in the event of an attack. Also, make\nsure you can set up automatic backups and create multiple backups for redundancy.\n**Get a website firewall – All of these steps are helpful, but a fully robust website**\n[security plan will include a web application firewall (WAF) to stop website hacks and](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/)\nattacks. The Sucuri cloud-based WAF can instantly block attacks, while also providing\nvirtual patching, protection from zero-day exploits, and faster load times through our\nCDN.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFinding a random folder on your website full of gibberish links is a nuisance that no website\nowner wants to deal with. But you’ll want to get a gibberish hack cleaned up as soon as\npossible.\n\n\n-----\n\nLeaving a compromised website online for an extended period of time will lead to a loss of\nvisitor trust and [search engine blacklisting that can destroy your website’s good standing.
