    "plain_text": "# Defense contractor CPI knocked offline by ransomware attack\n\n**[techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/cpi-ransomware-defense-contractor/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/cpi-ransomware-defense-contractor/)**\n\nZack Whittaker\n\n[Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/) [@zackwhittaker / 2 years](https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker)\n\nA major electronics manufacturer for defense and communications markets was knocked\noffline after a ransomware attack, TechCrunch has learned.\n\nA source with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that the defense contractor paid a\nransom of about $500,000 shortly after the incident in mid-January, but that the company\nwas not yet fully operational.\n\nCalifornia-based Communications & Power Industries (CPI) makes components for military\ndevices and equipment, like radar, missile seekers and electronic warfare technology. The\ncompany counts the U.S. Department of Defense and its advanced research unit DARPA as\ncustomers.\n\nThe company confirmed the ransomware attack.\n\n“We are working with a third-party forensic investigation firm to investigate the incident. The\ninvestigation is ongoing,” said CPI spokesperson Amanda Mogin. “We have worked with\ncounsel to notify law enforcement and governmental authorities, as well as customers, in a\n\n\n-----\n\ntimely manner.\n\nAccording to the source, a “domain admin” — a user with the highest level of privileges on\nthe network — clicked on a malicious link while they were logged in, which triggered the fileencrypting malware. Because the thousands of computers on the network were on the same,\nunsegmented domain, the ransomware quickly spread to every CPI office, including its onsite backups, the source said.\n\nThe source described the company in “panic mode,” as only about one-quarter of its\ncomputers are back up and running as of the end of February.\n\nShort staffing is hampering the effort, the source said. Some computers containing sensitive\nmilitary data have been recovered using the decryption key, which the company obtained by\npaying the ransom. One system is said to have files related to Aegis, a naval weapons\nsystem developed by Lockheed Martin.\n\n“We are aware of the situation with CPI and are following our standard response process for\npotential cyber incidents related to our supply chain,” said a Lockheed spokesperson.\n\nMany of the remaining computers are having their operating systems installed from scratch,\nthe source said. A portion of the defense contractor’s systems — about 150 computers —\nare still running Windows XP, which stopped receiving security patches in 2014.\n\nBut it’s not known what kind of ransomware was used in the attack. CPI’s spokesperson did\nnot answer any of our questions, and declined to comment further beyond the brief\nstatement.\n\nCPI becomes the latest victim in a spate of attacks targeting large companies in the past\n[month. This week alone saw legal services giant Epiq Global knocked offline by a](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/epiq-global-ransomware/)\n[ransomware attack, and Visser, a parts manufacturer for Tesla and SpaceX, was hit by a](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/visser-breach/)\nnew kind of data-stealing ransomware, dubbed DoppelPaymer, which not only encrypts files\nbut first exfiltrates company data to the hackers’ servers.\n\n[The hackers behind the DoppelPaymer attack began publishing Visser’s internal files last](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/visser-breach/)\nweek after the company did not pay the ransom.\n\nBrett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft, said the tactics of traditional fileencrypting ransomware have changed.\n\n“These incidents should be considered to be breaches — and disclosed and reported as\nsuch — from the get-go,” said Callow. “Criminals are getting too much time to misuse data\nwhile companies/people have no reason to be suspicious.”\n\n[As ransomware gets craftier, companies must start thinking creatively](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/)\n\n\n-----",
