In this entry, we\n[share how threat actors are bundling Windscribe VPN installers with backdoors. Backdoors allow cybercriminals to gain access and control of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/backdoor)\ncomputers remotely without the need for proper authentication. The specific backdoor here is detected by Trend Micro as\n[Backdoor.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THA, while the associated malicious files are detected by Trend Micro as](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Backdoor.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THA) [Trojan.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THIOABO.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THIOABO)\n\nIt is important to point out that the installers examined in this report come from fraudulent sources and are not from Windscribe’s official\n[download center or app stores for](https://windscribe.com/download) [Google and](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.windscribe.vpn&hl=en) [Apple. Notably, cybercriminals have previously used the technique of bundling legitimate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/windscribe-vpn/id1129435228)\ninstallers with malicious files for luring users on other platforms such as video conferencing apps.\n\nThe use of a VPN secures the communication between a user’s computer and the internet by encrypting the connection, thus keeping data\nsecure from spying attempts. VPNs have always been useful but are now relied on more than ever as many companies remain in work-fromhome (WFH), away from the presumably more secure office network environment.\n\n**Analyzing the malicious files bundled with the installer**\n\nTo begin with, a user likely gets the file from malicious sources, not knowing that they are downloading a bundled application instead of the\nlegitimate installer alone. The bundled application drops three components to the user’s system: the legitimate VPN installer, the malicious file\n(named lscm.exe) that contains the backdoor, and the application that serves as the runner of the malicious file (win.vbs).\n\nFigure 1. Contents of the bundled application\n\nFigure 2. Code content of win.vbs file\n\nshowing its function of running the malicious file\nThe user sees an installation window on their screen, which possibly masks the malicious activity that occurs in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Installation Window of Windscribe VPN\n\nWithout the user’s knowledge, the file lscm.exe stealthily acts in the background by downloading its payload from a website. This website then\nredirects the user to another page to download an encrypted file named Dracula.jpg.\n\nFigure 4. Code snippet of lscm.exe\n\nshowing the website it downloads its payload from\nThis file, which is obfuscated, has a decryption routine for the first layer stating that all “DTA” should be replaced by “14” and then that the file\nshould be string-reversed. Afterward, it also states that the hex value should be converted to a string. The value will then become an encoded\nbase64 file.\n\nFigure 5.

Decrypted file\n\n\nThe backdoor can also perform some commands like downloading, executing, and updating files, as well as taking screenshots of the user’s\nscreen.\n\nBesides these, the malware gathers the following information:\n\nAntivirus products\nMachine name\nOperating system\nUsername\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEnterprises and individual users alike employ VPNs to bolster their system’s protection. However, inadvertently downloading an installer\nbundled with malicious files does the exact opposite of this as it exposes systems to threats. Therefore, everyone should be reminded that the\ndownload of any application must only be coursed through legitimate avenues such as the app’s official download centers and other legitimate\napp marketplaces.\n\n\n-----\n\noday, a y co pa es st use s o t e setups t oug t e o e s a p ace o e a at o, use s s ou d e e et t e gua d\ndown when it comes to the security of their devices. Rather, it is best for users to stay vigilant in taking steps to protect their data.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAs prevention is better than cure, the best method to avoid malicious files is to be careful not to download them from their sources. For this, the\nfollowing measures are recommended:\n\nDownload applications and files only from official download centers and app stores. When in doubt about the download source, it is best\nto consult with the IT team of one’s company.\nScrutinize URLs to distinguish between spoofed domains of download centers (or app stores) and the legitimate ones. Keep in mind that\nmisspelled domain names are red flags.\nNever download apps and other files from emails sent by untrusted sources.\nDo not select any links from suspicious emails. Instead, hover over a link to get a preview of the URL where the embedded link is\nsupposed to lead to.\n\nLastly, we recommend [Trend Micro™ WiFi Protection, which ensures secure internet connection both at home and in public places. It also](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/WiFi-Protection.html)\nfilters and blocks malicious websites, online fraud, and internet scams.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**SHA256** **Trend Micro Pattern Detection**\n\n3b885d93801f89805020bf2c992048ce0dca499809e6721528ee03fa4544b398 [Trojan.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THIOABO](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THIOABO)\n\nc1f32f166400b5e5c394d30e62ee9f0e42c24f2d839c51fda227d2007f499a81 [Backdoor.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THA](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Backdoor.MSIL.BLADABINDI.THA)\n\n**URLs**\n\n**gamezer1hack[.]sytes[.]net:19811**\nhxxps://onedrive[.]live[.]com/download?cid=9B6546ADF0F7911A&resid=9B6546ADF0F7911A!1195&authkey=ABFIpKKz4bOcT1I\nhxxps://yu0aoq[.]db[.]files[.]1drv[.]com/y4mr4XEohBDL_98XqXLIKJPqiyqV1rhPymTxyJlXe0jmdlUfwDD0zTGUJtmAqyLRdtTJXAYycbv00qkS\ngSTmO3mIT5jCGKwfPRsMgFOcCjm8P9cugtlz0psvZQgiW13JPS_JSu3Wc8nVE0qT8qYTpNjQfCHLwTmNk6fh5zaCvDF0gpJkdKuvrMJ0TsA\ndownload&psid=1\n\n\n-----",
