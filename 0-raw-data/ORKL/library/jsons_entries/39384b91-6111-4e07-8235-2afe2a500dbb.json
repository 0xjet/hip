    "plain_text": "# Nigerian Tesla: 419 scammer gone malware distributor unmasked\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/05/nigerian-tesla-419-scammer-gone-malware-distributor-unmasked/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/05/nigerian-tesla-419-scammer-gone-malware-distributor-unmasked/)**\n\nThreat Intelligence Team May 5, 2022\n\nAgent Tesla is a well-known data stealer written in .NET that has been active since 2014 and\nis perhaps one of the most popular payloads observed in malspam campaigns.\n\nWhile looking for threats targeting Ukraine, we identified a group we call “Nigerian Tesla” that\nhas been dabbling into phishing and other data theft activities for a number of years.\nIronically, one of the main threat actors seemingly compromised his own computer with an\nAgent Tesla binary.\n\nIn this blog, we expose some of the activities from a scammer who started off with classic\nadvance-fee schemes and is now successfully running Agent Tesla campaigns. In the past\ntwo years, this threat actor was able to collect close to a million credentials from his victims.\n\n## Spam campaign\n\nOur investigation started with an email targeting titled Остаточний платіж.msg (Ukrainian\nfor Final payment.msg). It contained a link to a file sharing site that downloads an archive\ncontaining an executable file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Spam email with Agent Tesla\nThis executable is actually an Agent Tesla stealer, capable of exfiltrating data in multiple\nways, though most commonly using SMTP. The technique is really simple as it only requires\nan email account that sends messages to itself containing stolen credentials for each victim\nthat executed the malware on their computer.\n\n## Test successful!\n\nThe attacker sent a number of messages containing the body “Test successful!” from the\nsame machine. Those emails should have been deleted for obvious reasons but this threat\nactor did not and leaked his own IP address allowing us to locate them in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nFigure 2: Test emails sent by the attacker\n\n\n-----\n\nThese messages are checks done by the threat actor to make sure communication with\nAgent Tesla is configured properly. This is typical and is often described in hacking forums\nwhere users ask for help with the ‘software’.\n\nFigure 3: Forum post complaining about issue not receiving logs\nThere were an additional 26 emails sent from the same IP address that weren’t test emails\nbut came from a real Agent Tesla execution. We don’t know exactly how, but the attacker\nmanaged to infect his own machine.\n\nFigure 4: Information exfiltrated from the attacker’s machine\nHere is a list containing some of the services that the Nigerian Tesla threat actor used:\n\nPerfectMoney\n\n\n-----\n\nGlassdoor signupanywhere (could be a source to get victims emails)\nomail.io (service for extracting emails)\nwarzone.ws (Warzone RAT)\nworldwiredlabs (NetWire RAT)\nle-vpn.com and bettervpn.com zenmate.com tigervpn hotvpn (VPN provider)\nsecuritycode.eu cassandra.pw (Code Protector)\nesco.pw (office document protection)\nmonovm hostwinds.com firevps dynu 4server.su (VPS and dedicated servers)\ndnsomatic.com cloudns.net (DNS services)\nspam-lab.su\nfilesend.io 4shared (hosting files)\navcheck.net (offline av test)\nbitshacking.com\narchive.org (used like cloud storage)\nxss.is hackforums.net exploit.in\ntitan.email (.pw accounts, various scams)\n\nRita Bent, Lee Chen and John Cooper are some of the names that have been used in the\npast along with dozens of different email accounts with passwords containing the string\n‘1985’. The following image shows the activity from user rita398 in hackforums asking about\nEsco Crypter:\n\nFigure 5: Rita398 interested in Esco Crypter\n\n\n-----\n\nIn that case, we see Rita complaining about some RDP suspension that happened\neventually to one of his registered domains.\n\nFigure 6: RDP shutdown complain\nThe following email accounts were used in various phishing and data stealing operations:\n\nalong.aalahajirazak.ibrahim@gmail.com\nadministracion@romexpert.es\nadministracioneforce@eforce.es\nsoceanwave244@gmail.com\nbarristeradamssetien@gmail.com\ncatalinafuster@palmaprocura.com\ndavid01smith@yandex.com\ndavidsmith.ntx31@yandex.com\ndavids27smith@yandex.com\nelisabet.valenti@ag.barymont.com\ngestor3@afectadosvolkswagenabogados.com\ninfo@borrellacerrajeros.com\ninfo@crmarismas.org\ninfo@cristaleriagandia.com\ninfogestinsur@grupogestinsur.com\ninstalaciones@gopamar.com\nisabel@grupoatu.com\nm.lopez@forestadent.es\nnacho@alasvigilnevot.com\nrestaurante@elsecretodechimiche.com\nsoceanwave244@gmail.com\ntienda@di-tempo.com\ntorremolinos3@copiplus.es\nv.reino@gooddental.es\nvictor@sugesol.com\nvives@viveselectricitat.com\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on these profiles, we can see this threat actor has an extensive criminal record\nstarting at least from 2014. Back then, they performed classic scams under the Rita Bent\nmoniker.\n\nFigure 7: Scam conducted by the same attacker in the past\nOne of their preferred scams was phishing for Adobe login pages. We have records\nindicating that several Adobe fake pages were deployed from 2015 until recently. Landing\npages looked like the following:\n\nFigure 8: Fake Adobe login page\n\n\n-----\n\nFast forward to 2020, and the threat actor has graduated to malware distributor. He protects\nhis binaries with the Cassandra Protector obfuscator and then checks them against\nAVcheck[.]net.\n\nFigure 9: Cassandra Protector\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: AVcheck[.]net\n\n### Who is behind these attacks?\n\nThe threat actor shared photos of himself back in 2016 and for some reason forgot about\nthem.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Photos of the threat actor\nE.K. was born in 1985 according to his driver license. Remember that 1985 was used in a lot\nof passwords collected from accounts that conducted these illegal activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Threat actor’s drivers license\nAt the moment, we do not have much information about other members in the team. But E.\nK. seems to be the most relevant figure, at least the one who started the scheme.\n\n## From 419 scams to Agent Tesla\n\nNigerian Tesla stole more than 800,000 different credentials from about 28,000 victims. This\nshows how simple and yet effective running one of these campaigns can be. In this case we\nsee an interesting evolution from a threat actor that was performing the classic advance-fee\nscam (419 scam) before moving into the malware distribution world, more or less for the\nsame end goal.\n\nMalwarebytes users are protected against Agent Tesla. We detect this sample as\nSpyware.Password.Stealer.\n\n\n-----",
