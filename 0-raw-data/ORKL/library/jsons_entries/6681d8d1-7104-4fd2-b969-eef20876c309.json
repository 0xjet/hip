The malicious site prompts visitors to\ndownload an app, which is actually a downloader that drops the malware and other tools\nthat gather system information, such as drivers, patch level, network configuration,\nhardware, firmware, domain controller, admin name, and other user account information. It\nalso pulls screen size to determine whether the machine is a sandbox, according to Cisco's\nfindings.\n\nTortoiseshell deploys a remote access Trojan named \"IvizTech,\" which matches the code\nand features Symantec detailed in its report on the backdoor. Neither Symantec nor Cisco\nwould tie Tortoiseshell to a specific nation-state.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how the attackers lure potential victims and whether the site is actively\ninfecting victims at this point. Cisco Talos researchers say the creators thus far have\nemployed weak operations security of their own, leaving behind hard-coded credentials, for\ninstance.\n\n\"There is a possibility that multiple teams from an APT worked on multiple elements of this\nmalware, as we can see certain levels of sophistication existing and various levels of\nvictimology,\" the researchers wrote in their blog post about the threat today.\n\nPaul Rascagneres, a researcher at Cisco Talos, says he and his team don't believe the\nattack is widespread, and the group is still relatively new to the APT scene.\n\n\"Tortoiseshell is not well-documented. [The research] shows that this actor is offensive for\nmonths, they create fake websites, and they probably use social engineering to send\ntargets on these websites,\" he says. \"We identified at least two installers, a couple of\nvariants of the same RAT, a keylogger, and few reconnaissance tools. The toolkit of this\nactor is growing.\"\n\nThe researchers haven't pinpointed the initial infection vector, however. \"[I]t could be spearphishing or social media usage such as LinkedIn, as we saw during DNSpionage\n[campaign,\" he says, referring to an attack campaign last year that used fake job websites.](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/new-hacker-group-behind-dnspionage-attacks-in-middle-east-/d/d-id/1333350)\n\nCrowdStrike, meanwhile, had tagged the group as Imperial Kitten, an Iranian nation-state\noperation that has been operating since 2017. The group has been known to target Saudi\nArabian, United Arab Emirates, and Western maritime, IT services, defense, and military\nveterans, notes Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. Imperial Kitten\nsupports Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operations using tactics such as phony\njob recruitment social media and IT service provider attacks he says\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have observed them active as recent as this month, Meyers says.\n\nThe malicious website is a \"massive shift\" for the hacking group, according to Cisco, as it's\ntargeting a wider net of victims this way. \"Americans are quick to give back and support the\nveteran population. Therefore, this website has a high chance of gaining traction on social\nmedia where users could share the link in the hopes of supporting veterans,\" the Talos team\nwrote [in its blog post about the threat.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/09/tortoiseshell-fake-veterans.html)\n\nJon DiMaggio, a researcher at Symantec who follows Tortoiseshell, says Tortoiseshell may\nbe employing spear-phishing emails to lure victims.\n\n\"Assuming [Cisco Talos'] attribution is correct, it would show that another possible infection\nvector used by Tortoiseshell may have been spear-phishing emails,\" he says. \"We identified\na Web shell being used by the attacker indicating they may have compromised a Web\nserver to deploy malware onto the victims' environment in the supply chain attacks, but\nspear-phishing is very common, and it would not be surprising to see them use more than\none infection vector in various campaigns.\"\n\n**Related Content:**\n\n**_Check out_** **_[The Edge, Dark Reading's new section for features, threat data, and in-](https://www.darkreading.com/Edge.asp)_**\n**_depth perspectives.
