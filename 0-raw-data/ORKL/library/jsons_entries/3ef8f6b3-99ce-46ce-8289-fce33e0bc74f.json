In late August, we started seeing a Fallout exploit kit campaign distributing\nthe Raccoon Stealer via high-traffic adult sites. Shortly after we reported it to the ad network,\nthe same threat actor came back again using the RIG exploit kit instead.\n\nThen we saw possibly the largest campaign to date on top site xhamster[.]com from a\nmalvertiser we have tracked for well over a year. This threat actor has managed to abuse\npractically all adult ad networks but this may be the first time they hit a top publisher.\n\n## Malvertising on popular ad network\n\nThe first malicious advertiser we observed was able to bid for ads on a number of adult sites\nby targeting users running Internet Explorer without any particular geolocation restriction,\nalthough the majority of victims were in the US.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Victims by country on the left, adult sites traffic on the right\nIn this campaign, the crooks abused the popular ad network ExoClick by using different\nredirection pages. However, each time we were able to notify the ad network and get them\nshut down quickly.\n\nThe first domain they used was inteca-deco[.]com, which was setup as a web design agency\nbut visibly a decoy page to the trained eye.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Decoy page used as a gate to exploit kit\nSimple server-side cloaking performs the redirect to a Fallout exploit kit landing page which\nattempts to exploit [CVE-2019-0752 (Internet Explorer) and CVE-2018-15982 (Flash Player)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0752)\nbefore dropping the Raccoon Stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Traffic for Fallout exploit kit\nAbout 10 days later, another domain, websolvent[.]me, became active but used a different\nredirection technique, a 302 redirect, also known as 302 cushioning. This time we see the\nRIG exploit kit which also delivers Raccoon Stealer.\n\nFigure 4: Traffic for RIG exploit kit\n[Beyond a common payload, those two domains are also related. A RiskIQ crawl confirms a](https://community.riskiq.com/search/intica-deco.com/hostpairs)\nrelationship between these 2 domains where the parent host was caught doing a meta\nrefresh redirect to the child:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Passive Total’s host\n\npairs\n\n## Malvertising on top adult site gets maximum reach\n\nThe second malvertiser (‘malsmoke’) is one that we have tracked diligently over the past\nseveral months and whose end payload is often the Smoke Loader malware. It is by far the\nmost daring and successful one in that it goes after larger publishers and a variety of ad\nnetworks. However, up until now we had only seen them on publishers from the adult\nindustry that are still relatively small in scale.\n\nIn this instance, the threat actor was able to abuse the Traffic Stars ad network and place\ntheir malicious ad on xhamster[.]com, a site with just over 1.06 billion monthly visits\n[according to SimilarWeb.com.](https://www.similarweb.com/website/xhamster.com/#overview)\n\nThe gates used by this group also use a decoy site and over time they have registered\ndomains mocking ad networks and cloud providers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Malicious Popunder on xhamster (brought to the forefront)\nThe redirection mechanism is more sophisticated than those used in other malvertising\ncampaigns. There is some client-side fingerprinting and connectivity checks to avoid VPNs\nand proxies, only targeting legitimate IP addresses.\n\nFigure 7: Traffic for xhamster malvertising\nInterestingly, this Smoke Loader instance also downloads Raccoon Stealer and ZLoader.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalsmoke is probably the most persistent malvertising campaigns we have seen this year.\nUnlike other threat actors, this group has shown that it can rapidly switch ad networks to\nkeep their business uninterrupted.\n\nFigure 8: Malvertising campaigns related to malsmoke\n\n## Still using Internet Explorer?\n\nThreat actors still leveraging exploit kits to deliver malware is one thing, but end users\nbrowsing with Internet Explorer is another. Despite recommendations from Microsoft and\nsecurity professionals, we can only witness that there are still a number of users (consumer\nand enterprise) worldwide that have yet to migrate to a modern and fully supported browser.\n\nAs a result, exploit kit authors are squeezing the last bit of juice from vulnerabilities in\nInternet Explorer and Flash Player (due to retire for good next year).\n\nMalwarebytes customers have long been protected from malvertising and exploit kits. We\ncontinue to track and report the campaigns we run into to help do our part in keeping the\nInternet safer.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**Gates used in malvertising campaign pushing Raccoon Stealer**\n\nintica-deco[.]com\n\nwebsolvent[ ]me\n\n\n-----\n\n**Raccoon Stealer**\n\nb289155154642ba8e9b032490a20c4a2c09b925e5b85dda11fc85d377baa6a6c\nf319264b36cdf0daeb6174a43aaf4a6684775e6f0fb69aaf2d7dc051a593de93\n\n**Raccoon Stealer C2s**\n\n34.105.147[.]92/gate/log.php\nchinadevmonster[.]top/gate/log.php\n\n**Smoke Loader**\n\n23bef893e3af7cb49dc5ae0a14452ed781f841db7397dc3ebb689291fd701b6b\n\n**Smoke Loader C2s**\n\ndkajsdjiqwdwnfj[.]info\n2831ujedkdajsdj[.]info\n928eijdksasnfss[.]info\ndkajsdjiqwdwnfj[.]info\n2831ujedkdajsdj[.]info\n928eijdksasnfss[.]info\n\n**Gates used in the malsmoke campaign**\n\neinlegesohle[.]com/indexx.php\nadexhangetomatto[.]space\nencelava[.]com/coexo.php\nencelava[.]com/caac\nuneaskie[.]com/ukexo.php\nbumblizz[.]com/auexo.php\nbumblizz[.]com/auflexexo.php\nbumblizz[.]com/caexo.php\nbumblizz[.]com/caflexexo.php\nbumblizz[.]com/usexo.php\nbumblizz[.]com/usflexexo.php\ncanadaversaliska[.]info/coflexexo.php\ncanadaversaliska[.]info/coflexo.php\ncanadaversaliska[.]info/ukflexexo.php\ncanadaversaliska[.]info/ukflexo.php\ncanadaversaliska[.]info/usflexexo.php\ncanadaversaliska[.]info/usflexo.php\nkrostaur[.]com/jpexo.php\nkrostaur[.]com/jpflexexo.php\nkrostaur[.]com/jpflexo.php\n\n\n-----\n\nleiomity[.]com/ukexo.php\nleiomity[.]com/ukflexexo.php\nleiomity[.]com/usexo.php\nleiomity[.]com/usflexexo.php\nsurdised[.]com/coexo.php\nsurdised[.]com/usexo.php\n\n**Tweets referencing the malsmoke campaign**\n\nhttps://twitter[.]com/MBThreatIntel/status/1245791188281462784\nhttps://twitter[.]com/FaLconIntel/status/1232475345023987713\nhttps://twitter[.]com/nao_sec/status/1231149711517634560\nhttps://twitter[.]com/tkanalyst/status/1229794466816389120\nhttps://twitter[.]com/nao_sec/status/1209090544711815169\n\n\n-----",
