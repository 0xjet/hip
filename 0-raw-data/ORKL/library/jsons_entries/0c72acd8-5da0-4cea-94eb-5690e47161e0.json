This leads to a relatively lower detection rate for malicious IIS](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/)\nextensions compared to script web shells. IIS backdoors are also harder to detect since they mostly reside in\nthe same directories as legitimate modules used by target applications, and they follow the same code structure\nas clean modules. In most cases, the actual backdoor logic is minimal and cannot be considered malicious\nwithout a broader understanding of how legitimate IIS extensions work, which also makes it difficult to determine\nthe source of infection.\n\nTypically, attackers first exploit a critical vulnerability in the hosted application for initial access before dropping a\nscript web shell as the first stage payload. At a later point in time, the attackers then install an IIS backdoor to\nprovide highly covert and persistent access to the server. Attackers can also install customized IIS modules to fit\ntheir purposes, as we observed in a campaign targeting Exchange servers between January and May 2022, as\n[well as in our prior research on the custom IIS backdoors ScriptModule.dll and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/08/threat-actor-dev-0322-exploiting-zoho-manageengine-adselfservice-plus/)\n[App_Web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll. Once registered with the target application, the backdoor can](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/18/analyzing-solorigate-the-compromised-dll-file-that-started-a-sophisticated-cyberattack-and-how-microsoft-defender-helps-protect/)\nmonitor incoming and outgoing requests and perform additional tasks, such as running remote commands or\ndumping credentials in the background as the user authenticates to the web application.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we expect attackers to continue to increasingly leverage IIS backdoors, it s vital that incident responders\nunderstand the basics of how these attacks function to successfully identify and defend against them.\n[Organizations can further improve their defenses with Microsoft 365 Defender, whose protection capabilities are](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\ninformed by research like this and our unique visibility into server attacks and compromise. With critical\n[protection features like threat and vulnerability management and antivirus capabilities, Microsoft 365 Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management?view=o365-worldwide)\nprovides organizations with a comprehensive solution that coordinates protection across domains, spanning\nemail, identities, cloud, and endpoints.\n\nIn this blog post, we detail how IIS extensions work and provide insight into how they are being leveraged by\nattackers as backdoors. We also share some of our observations on the IIS threat landscape over the last year\nto help defenders identify and protect against this threat and prepare the larger security community for any\nincreased sophistication. More specifically, the blog covers the following topics:\n\n## Understanding IIS extensions\n\nIIS is a flexible, general purpose web server that has been a core part of the Windows platform for many years\nnow. As an easy-to-manage, modular, and extensible platform for hosting websites, services, and applications,\nIIS serves critical business logic for numerous organizations. The modular architecture of IIS allows users to\nextend and customize web servers according to their needs. These extensions can be in the form of native\n(C/C++) and managed (C#, VB.NET) code structures, with the latter being our focus on this blog post. The\nextensions can further be categorized as modules and handlers.\n\nThe IIS pipeline is a series of extensible objects that are initiated by the ASP.NET runtime to process a request.\nIIS modules and handlers are .NET components that serve as the main points of extensibility in the pipeline.\nEach request is processed by multiple IIS modules before being processed by a single IIS handler. Like a set of\nbuilding blocks, modules and handlers are added to provide the desired functionality for the target application. In\naddition, handlers can be configured to respond to specific attributes in the request such a URL, file extension,\nand HTTP method. For example, Aspnet_isapi.dll is a pre-configured IIS handler for common .aspx extensions.\n\n### Creating custom managed IIS modules\n\nTo create a managed IIS module, the code must implement the IHttpModule interface. The IHttpModule\ninterface has two methods with the following signatures: Init() and Dispose().\n\n_Figure 1. IIS module skeleton_\n[Inside Init(), the module can synchronize with any number of HTTP events available in the request pipeline,](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/developer/webapps/aspnet/development/http-modules-handlers)\nlisted here in sequential order:\n\nBeginRequest\nAuthenticateRequest\nAuthorizeRequest\nResolveRequestCache\nAcquireRequestState\nPreRequestHandlerExecute\n\n\n-----\n\nPostRequestHandlerExecute\nReleaseRequestState\nUpdateRequestCache\nEndRequest\nPreSendRequestHeaders\nPreSendRequestContent\n\nThe newly created extension should then be mapped with the target application to complete the registration.\n[Generally, there are several methods that can be used to map managed modules for legitimate purposes. On](https://docs.microsoft.com/iis/get-started/introduction-to-iis/iis-modules-overview)\nthe other hand, we observed that attackers used the following techniques to register malicious IIS extensions\nduring attacks:\n\n**Register with global assembly cache (GAC) PowerShell API: Every device with Common Language**\nRuntime (CLR) hosts a device-wide cache called the global assembly cache (GAC). The GAC stores\nassemblies specifically designated to be shared by several applications on the device. GacInstall() is a\nPowerShell API to add modules into the global cache. Once installed, the module is available under the path\n_%windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\assembly and is mapped to IIS (w3wp.exe) using appcmd.exe._\n\n_Figure 2. Attacker command using the GAC PowerShell API_\n**Register using appcmd.exe: Appcmd.exe is the single command line tool for managing IIS. All critical aspects,**\nsuch as adding or removing modules and handlers, can be performed using the utility. In this case, the attackers\ndrop the malicious extension in the target application’s /bin folder and map it using the add module command.\n\n_Figure 3. Attacker command using appcmd.exe_\n**Register using gacutil.exe: Gacutil.exe is a Visual Studio shipped .NET GAC utility. The tool allows the user to**\nview and manipulate the contents of the GAC, including installing new modules using the -I option.\n\n_Figure 4. Attacker command using gacutil.exe_\n**Register using web.config: After dropping the module in the application’s /bin folder, attackers can also edit**\nthe web.config of the target application or the global config file, applicationHost.config, to register the module.\n\n_Figure 5. Malicious web.config entry_\nUpon successful registration, the module is visible inside the IIS manager application.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Installed module visible in the list_\n\n## Attack flow using a custom IIS backdoor\n\nBetween January and May 2022, our IIS-related detections picked up an interesting campaign targeting\nMicrosoft Exchange servers. Web shells were dropped in the path\n_%ExchangeInstallPath%\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\ via_ [ProxyShell exploit.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/ba-p/2684705)\n\nAfter a period of doing reconnaissance, dumping credentials, and establishing a remote access method, the\nattackers installed a custom IIS backdoor called FinanceSvcModel.dll in the folder C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\bin\\. The\nbackdoor had built-in capability to perform Exchange management operations, such as enumerating installed\nmailbox accounts and exporting mailboxes for exfiltration, as detailed below.\n\n### Command runs\n\n_PowerShDLL toolkit, an open-source project to run PowerShell without invoking powershell.exe, was used to_\nrun remote commands. The attacker avoided invoking common living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), such as\n_cmd.exe or powershell.exe in the context of the Exchange application pool (MSExchangeOWAAppPool) to_\nevade related detection logic.\n\n_Figure 7. Using PowerShDLL to run remote commands_\n\n### Credential access\n\nThe attackers enabled WDigest registry settings, which forced the system to use WDigest protocol for\nauthentication, resulting in lsass.exe retaining a copy of the user’s plaintext password in memory. This change\nallowed the attackers to steal the actual password, not just the hash. Later, Mimikatz was run to dump local\n[credentials and perform a DCSYNC attack.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\n\n_Figure 8. Mimikatz usage_\n\n### Remote access\n\nThe attackers used plink.exe, a command-line connection tool like SSH. The tool allowed the attackers to\nbypass network restrictions and remotely access the server through tunneled RDP traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Bypassing network restrictions_\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nThe attacker invoked the IIS backdoor by sending a crafted POST request with a cookie EX_TOKEN. The\nmodule extracts the cookie value and initiates a mailbox export request with the supplied filter.\n\n_Figure 10. Attacker-generated POST request_\nThe value decodes to: ep,06/21/2022,06/21/2022,C:\\Windows\\Web,Administrator, where ep is the command\nto initiate the mailbox export request with filters determining the start and end dates followed by the export path.\nThe final command has the following syntax:\n\n_Figure 11. Attacker-generated mailbox export request_\n\n_Figure 12. Mailbox export code snippet_\nThe table below details all the commands found in the backdoor:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n_test_ Attempts to load Exchange Management Shell (EMS)- Add-PSSnapin\n_Microsoft.Exchange.Management.Powershell.SnapIn_\n\n\n-----\n\n_box_ List all UserPrincipalNames- _foreach ($name in Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited){ Write-_\n_Output $name.UserPrincipalName}_\n\n_ep_ Run New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet with supplied mailbox name, start and end date, and\nexport path as filters.\n\n_gep_ Get the task ID associated with the export request\n\n_ruh_ Tamper with Exchange logs\n\n## Types of IIS backdoors\n\nReviewing the malicious managed (.NET) IIS extensions observed over the past year, we grouped these\nextensions based on various factors such as similar capabilities and sources of origin, as further detailed in the\nbelow sections.\n\n### Web shell-based variants\n\n[Web shells like China Chopper have been widely used in numerous targeted attacks. As China Chopper’s](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/)\nusage increased over the years, so did the detections. As a result, the attackers evolved and added IIS modulebased versions of these web shells that maintain the same functionality. The module uses the same eval()\ntechnique that’s used in the script version for running the code. While most antivirus solutions would detect the\none-liner web shell, such as < %@page language=js%><%eval(request.item(<password>),”unsafe”);%>,\nembedding the same code in an IIS module generates lower detection rates.\n\nIn the module version, the attacker-initiated POST request contains the code along with the arguments in\nparameters z1 and z2, like the script-based version.\n\n_Figure 13. China chopper IIS module – version 1_\n\n_Figure 14. Attacker generated POST data – version 1_\nIn a different version, the module has the backdoor logic hardcoded inside the DLL and only waits for\nparameters z1 and z2. The parameter kfaero has the command exposed as sequential alphabets from ‘A-Q’.\n\n_Figure 15. China chopper IIS module – version 2_\nLike the script version, the IIS module has similar capabilities, such as listing and creating directories,\ndownloading and uploading files, running queries using SQL adaptors, and running commands. To run\ncommands, the attacker-initiated POST request contains the command “M” along with the arguments.\n\n_Figure 16. An example of an attacker generated POST data – version 2_\n\n\n-----\n\nAntsword is another popular web shell widely used in various targeted attacks. Custom IIS modules inspired\nfrom the web shell’s code have been observed in the wild, which include similar architecture and capabilities.\nInteresting new features of these malicious modules include fileless execution of C# code and remote access\nvia TCP socket connection.\n\n_Figure 17. Antsword IIS module code snippet_\nBased on the request, the module can take one of the two code paths. In case of /server-status, a socket\nconnection is initiated from values in the custom header Lhposzrp.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n_FSoaij7_03Ip3QuzbIhvuilKIsoM9a48DTkvQKdwtKNA_ Socket connection\n\n_8CDztbQb4fsQeU5AAuBs9OmRokoyFJ7F5Z_ Close connection\n\n_31FKvk8VDcqZMA3iAq3944wjg_ Send data\n\n_TU_LDzOsv_ Receive data\n\nFor any other URL, the module follows a China Chopper-style architecture of commands, ranging from “A”\nthrough “R”. The additional “R” command allows the attackers to run C# code reflectively.\n\n_Figure 18. Command “R” to invoke code reflectively_\n\n### Open-source variants\n\nGitHub projects on creating backdoors for IIS have been available for some time now. Though mostly shared to\neducate the red team community, threat actors have also taken interest and lifted code from these projects.\nUsing a public project that has been actively leveraged by attackers as an example, the original code includes\nthe following capabilities:\n\n**Command** **Implementation**\n\n\n-----\n\n_cmd_ Run command via cmd.exe /c\n\n_powershell_ Run powershell via RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace()\n\n_shellcode_ Inject supplied shellcode into userinit.exe\n\nIn this case, the in-the-wild variants change the cookie names, keeping the rest of the code intact:\n\n_Figure 19. Side to side comparison of code from an open-source project (left) and code used by attackers (right)_\nOn supplying a whoami command to the backdoor, the generated cookie has the following format:\n\n_Cookie: BDUSS=P6zUsk/1xJyW4PPufWsx5w==_\n\nThe backdoor responds with an AES encrypted blob wrapped in base64. The decoded output has the following\nformat:\n\n_Figure 20. Decoded response from the server_\n\n### IIS handlers\n\nAs mentioned earlier, IIS handlers have the same visibility as modules into the request pipeline. Handlers can\nbe configured to respond to certain extensions or requests. To create a managed IIS handler, the code must\nimplement the IHttpHandler interface. The IHttpHandler interface has one method and one property with the\nfollowing signatures:\n\n_Figure 21. IIS handler skeleton_\n\n\n-----\n\nHandlers can be registered by directly editing the web.config file or using the appcmd utility. The handler config\ntakes a few important fields like path, which specifies the URL or extensions the handler should respond to, and\n_verb, which specifies the HTTP request type. In the example below, the handler only responds to image_\nrequests ending with a .gif extension:\n\n_Figure 22. Malicious web.config entry_\nThe handler is visible in the IIS manager application once successfully installed:\n\n_Figure 23. Installed handler visible in the list_\nMost of the handlers analyzed were relatively simple, only including the capability to run commands:\n\n_Figure 24. IIS handler running commands via cmd.exe_\nInterestingly, the response Content-Type is set to image/gif or image/jpeg, which presents a default image when\nbrowsing the image URL with the output hidden in <pre> tags. A possible reason for this could be to bypass\nnetwork inspection since image files are generally considered non-malicious and are filtered and identified\nbased on extensions.\n\n### Credential stealers\n\nThis subset of modules monitors sign-in patterns in outgoing requests and dumps extracted credentials in an\nencrypted format. The stolen credentials allow the attackers to remain persistent in the environment, even if the\nprimary backdoor is detected.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe modules monitor for specific requests to determine a sign in activity, such as /auth.owa default URL for\nOWA application. On inspecting the request, the module dumps the credentials in a .dat file. The contents are\nencrypted using XOR with a hardcoded value and wrapped with base64 encoding. The below image depicts a\ndecoded sample output:\n\n_Figure 25. Sample decrypted entry_\n\n_Figure 26. Backdoor looking for OWA sign-in URL_\nIn another variant, the module looks for common placeholder variables for passing credentials used in different\nASP.Net applications. The dumped credentials are AES encrypted and wrapped with Base64 encoding, located\nin %programdata%\\log.txt.\n\n_Figure 27. Backdoor looking for common credential placeholder variables_\n\n_Figure 28. Sample decrypted entry_\n\n## Improving defenses against server compromise\n\nAs we expect to observe more attacks using IIS backdoors, organizations must ensure to follow security\npractices to help defend their servers.\n\n### Apply the latest security updates\n\nIdentify and remediate vulnerabilities or misconfigurations impacting servers. Deploy the latest security updates,\nespecially for server components like Exchange as soon as they become available. Use Microsoft Defender\nVulnerability Management to audit these servers regularly for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and suspicious\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Keep antivirus and other protections enabled\n\n[It’s critical to protect servers with Windows antivirus software and other security solutions like firewall protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/windows-antivirus-software?view=exchserver-2019)\nand MFA. [Turn on cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission in Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-antivirus-sample-submission)\nto use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats.\nUse [attack surface reduction rules to automatically block behaviors like credential theft and suspicious use of](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard)\n[PsExec and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Turn on tamper protection features to prevent](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\nattackers from stopping security services.\n\nIf you are worried that these security controls will affect performance or disrupt operations, engage with IT\nprofessionals to help determine the true impact of these settings. Security teams and IT professionals should\n[collaborate on applying mitigations and appropriate settings.](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/windows-antivirus-software)\n\n### Review sensitive roles and groups\n\nReview highly privileged groups like Administrators, Remote Desktop Users, and Enterprise Admins. Attackers\nadd accounts to these groups to gain foothold on a server. Regularly review these groups for suspicious\nadditions or removal. To identify Exchange-specific anomalies, review the list of users in sensitive roles such\n[as mailbox import export and Organization Management using theGet-ManagementRoleAssignment cmdlet in](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-managementroleassignment)\nExchange PowerShell.\n\n### Restrict access\n\nPractice the principle of least-privilege and maintain good credential hygiene. Avoid the use of domain-wide,\n[admin-level service accounts. Enforce strong randomized, just-in-time local administrator passwords and enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access#2-just-in-time-local-admin-passwords)\n[MFA. Use tools like Microsoft Defender for Identity’s](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-for-identity) [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS).](https://docs.microsoft.com/defender-for-identity/security-assessment-laps)\n\nPlace access control list restrictions on virtual directories in IIS. Also, remove the presence of on-premises\nExchange servers when only used for recipient management in Exchange Hybrid environments.\n\n### Prioritize alerts\n\nThe distinctive patterns of server compromise aid in detecting malicious behaviors and inform security\noperations teams to quickly respond to the initial stages of compromise. Pay attention to and immediately\ninvestigate alerts indicating suspicious activities on servers. Catching attacks in the exploratory phase, the\nperiod in which attackers spend several days exploring the environment after gaining access, is key. Prioritize\nalerts related to processes such as net.exe, cmd.exe originating from w3wp.exe in general.\n\n### Inspect config file and bin folder\n\n[Regularly inspect web.config of your target application and ApplicationHost.config to identify any suspicious](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/web-config)\nadditions, such as a handler for image files—which is suspicious itself, if not outright malicious. Also, regularly\nscan installed paths like the application’s bin directory and default GAC location. Regularly inspecting the list of\ninstalled modules using the appcmd.exe or gacutil.exe utilities is also advisable.\n\n**_Hardik Suri_**\n\n_Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team_\n\n## Appendix\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects these threats and related behaviors as the following malware:\n\nBackdoor:MSIL/SuspIISModule.G!gen\nBackdoor:MSIL/SuspIISModule H!gen\n\n\n-----\n\nBackdoor:MSIL/SuspIISModule.K!gen\nBackdoor:MSIL/OWAStealer.B\nBackdoor:MSIL/OWAStealer.C\nBehavior:Win32/SuspGacInstall.B\n\n### Endpoint detection and response (EDR)\n\nSuspicious IIS AppCmd Usage\n\n### Hunting queries\n\nTo locate malicious activity related to suspicious IIS module registration, run the following queries:\n\n**Suspicious IIS module registration**\n```\nDeviceProcessEvents\n\n| where ProcessCommandLine has “appcmd.exe add module”\n\n| where InitiatingProcessParentFileName == “w3wp.exe”\n\nDeviceProcessEvents\n\n| where InitiatingProcessFileName == “powershell.exe”\n\n|where ProcessCommandLine has ” system.enterpriseservices.internal.publish”\n\n| where InitiatingProcessParentFileName == “w3wp.exe”\n\nDeviceProcessEvents\n\n|where ProcessCommandLine has ” \\\\gacutil.exe /I”\n\n| where InitiatingProcessParentFileName == “w3wp.exe”\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n```\n**File name** **SHA-256**\n\nHttpCompress.dll 4446f5fce13dd376ebcad8a78f057c0662880fdff7fe2b51706cb5a2253aa569\n\nHttpSessionModule.dll 1d5681ff4e2bc0134981e1c62ce70506eb0b6619c27ae384552fe3bdc904205c\n\nRewriterHttpModule.dll c5c39dd5c3c3253fffdd8fee796be3a9361f4bfa1e0341f021fba3dafcab9739\n\n\nMicrosoft.Exchange.HttpProxy.\n\nHttpUtilities.dll\n\n\nd820059577dde23e99d11056265e0abf626db9937fc56afde9b75223bf309eb0\n\n\nHttpManageMoudle.dll 95721eedcf165cd74607f8a339d395b1234ff930408a46c37fa7822ddddceb80\n\nIIS_backdoor.dll e352ebd81a0d50da9b7148cf14897d66fd894e88eda53e897baa77b3cc21bd8a\n\nFinanceSvcModel.dll 5da41d312f1b4068afabb87e40ad6de211fa59513deb4b94148c0abde5ee3bd5\n\nApp_Web_system_web.ashx.dll 290f8c0ce754078e27be3ed2ee6eff95c4e10b71690e25bbcf452481a4e09b9d\n\nApp_Web_error.ashx.dll 2996064437621bfecd159a3f71166e8c6468225e1c0189238068118deeabaa3d\n\n\n-----",
