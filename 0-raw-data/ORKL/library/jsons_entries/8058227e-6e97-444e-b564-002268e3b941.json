    "plain_text": "# Cozy Smuggled Into the Box: APT29 Abusing Legitimate Software for Targeted Operations in Europe\n\n**cluster25.io/2022/05/13/cozy-smuggled-into-the-box/**\n\nMay 13, 2022\n\n**Cozy Bear (aka Nobelium, APT29, The Dukes) is a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized**\ncyberespionage group that is believed to work in support of the decision-making process of Russian\ngovernment since at least 2008. Nobelium primarily targets western governments and related\n**organizations, with a particular focus on government, diplomat, political and think tank sectors.**\nRecently we analyzed several spear-phishing campaigns linked with this adversary that involve the\nusage of a side-loaded DLL through signed software (like Adobe suite) and legitimate\n\n\n-----\n\n**webservices (like Dropbox) as communication vector for Command and Control (C&C). The**\nmisuse of legitimate webservices is in attempt to evade the detection from automatic analysis software.\nRecently, [third-party researchers have also reported it used Trello and its REST API to simulate a first-](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns)\nlevel Command & Control server. In addition to this evasion attempt, as we are going to discuss later,\nthe side-loaded DLL tries to unhook the windows libraries loaded in the process memory to evade\npossible EDRs.\n\nTo maximize the chances of success, Nobelium,in at least two cases, sent spear-phishing emails\nfrom spoofed or compromised government addresses. As initial access we identified the following\n**attack vectors:**\n\n1. The first approach involves the distribution of an IMG file which, when mounted, contains an LNK\n\nshortcut and the signed software with the other DLLsand a decoy PDF as hidden files. This attack\nvector lures the user through a masquerading technique by changing the LNK file icon to a\n_folder icon in order to convince the user to click on it. In fact, once triggered, the cmd.exe utility is_\ninvoked to run the signed executable and to start the side-loading of the malicious DLL (i.e.\n**AcroSup.dll).**\n2. The second approach involves the usage of the EnvyScout dropper that is basically an HTML\n\nfile with an embedded JavaScript designed to decode and drop the next-stage payload (HTML\n**Smuggling). In fact, once the HTML file is executed, the JavaScript code decodes a bytes array**\nand saves the result under an archive in the Download directory. In this case, the user is\nresponsible to unzip the archive (that contains the signed software, the relative DLL’s and the lure\nPDF) and to run manually the executable to start the chain (even if the JavaScript code contains\nunused snippet for automating the process).\n\nThe EnvyScout dropper was used by this threat actor in different campaigns. From mid-January 2022\n**Cluster25 internally reported differet Nobelium-linkedcampaigns against European entities that**\nleveraged fairly complex kill-chain started with EnvyScout as well.\n\n**INSIGHTS**\n\nIn the reported case, the signed executable is represented by WCChromeNativeMessagingHost.exe\nfrom the Adobe Create PDF module of the Adobe suite. It’s a plugin for Google Chrome. Since the\nmalware bundle contains a local copy of vcruntime140.dll, once the abused software is executed, the\nlocal copy of this Windows library is loaded into the program memory from the PE import table.\nAnalyzing the local copy of vcruntime140.dll, we noticed that the PE imports of this library have\nbeen modified: it contains an entry to the AcroSup.dll delivered through the malware bundle.\n\nSo, this import chain, leads to the side-loading of the malicious AcroSup.dll and the execution of its\n**DllMain export before the execution of the signed Adobe executable. To evade possible debuggers**\nthe execution of the malicious AcroSup.dll starts with a thread hijacking by overwriting the thread\ncontext of the main thread (updating the RIP register) in the signed executable space. To avoid the DLL\nexecution in suspected processes, before the thread context overwriting the malware checks for the\nprocess image name is currently matching with the name of the signed expected executable, through\nthe K32GetProcessImageFileNameA API.\n\nAfter that the malware iterates on the loaded Windows DLLs through the K32EnumProcessModules\nAPIs to unhook each DLL and evade active EDRs on the system. Basically, for each loaded DLL, the\n**.text section of each of them is freshly mapped to the virtual address of the possible hooked DLL.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom this point the malware enters a pseudo-infinite loop where, each second, goes to contact the\n**Dropbox service to communicate the victim identifier and receive next-stage payloads.**\n\nFirst of all, the api.dropbox.com endpoint is contacted at the /oauth2/token/ URI through an HTTP\n**POST request to receive a refresh token, necessary to contact the Dropbox APIs.**\n\nFor this request the following combination of API key and API secret are used to represent the\nDropbox account used by the threat actor:\n\nAPI key: fm09ogco339u0a9\nAPI secret: scqekoaqqj98sze\n\nIn addition, for all the network-related requests the malware uses a fixed user-agent:\n\n_User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like_\n_Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.75 Safari/537.36 AtContent/91.5.2444.45_\n\nIf the refresh token is received from the Dropbox APIs and successfully parsed, the implant proceeds\nwith the integration of some masquerading and persistence techniques. More in details, a new\nsubprocessis created to open the lure PDF document (an empty PDF) contained in the bundle and\nused to make the user think that he has opened the legit Adobe Acrobat application.\n\nIn the meanwhile, all the files involved in the bundle (signed software and relative DLL’s) are copied\nunder the %APPDATA%\\AcroSup\\ directory and a new registry key under\n**HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ is created to achieve**\npersistence.\n\nThe lure PDF document is not copied under the above mentioned directory so this document will not be\nopened again after a restart of the victim system. To register the victim entry on Dropbox, a victim\nidentifier is created through the hex-encoded combination of the current usernameand current\ncomputer name (e.g., john::windows10). The communication of the new victim is then completed\nthrough a push of a new .mp3 file(named Rock_[VICTIM_ID].mp3) via the Dropbox APIs on\n**/2/files/upload/ URI.**\n\nInterestingly, the pushed .MP3 files identifying the victims, contains always the following string that\nlikely represents the malware family:\n\n_ME3.99.5UUUUUUUUUUU_\n\nFinally, another request is performed to the /2/files/download/ path of Dropbox APIs that tries to\ndownload a file named Rock_VICTIM_ID.mp3.backup. The response is parsed to determine if a next**stage payload exists for the current registered victim. If one does, the malware will allocate a new heap**\nspace to store the downloaded payload and will execute it in the executable space by overwriting again\nthe thread context of the main executable.\n\n**VICTIMOLOGY**\n\nIn recent months Cluster25 had evidence of Cozy Bear‘s campaigns that potentially impacted at least\n**Greece, Italy, Turkey and Portugal especially in government and foreign affairs sectors.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\n**NOBELIUM confirms its interest in government and foreign affairs by targeting organizations in Europe**\nand possibly other parts of the world. The campaigns and the payloads analyzed over time show a\nstrong focus on operating under the radar and lowering the detection rates. In this regard, even the use\nof legitimate services such as Trello and DropBox suggest the adversary’s will to operate for a long\ntime within the victim environments remaining undetected. It is possible to foresee that this actor will\nalso try to change TTPs (Technical and Tactical Procedures) in the near future in order to make any\nmitigation action aimed at its contrast more difficult. In this regard, we provide a wide set of detection\nrules useful for verifying potential malicious activities attributable to this threat actor (see DETECTION\nAND THREAT HUNTING SECTION).\n\n**ATT&CK MATRIX**\n\nTACTIC TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION\n\nT1566.001 Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n\nInitial Access\n\nExecution T1204.001 User Execution: Malicious Link\n\nExecution T1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File\n\nExecution T1059.007 Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript\n\nDefense Evasion T1036 Masquerading\n\nDefense Evasion T1622 Debugger Evasion\n\nDefense Evasion T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1055.003 Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking\n\nDefense Evasion T1553.002 Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing\n\nDefense Evasion T1562.001 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\n\n-----\n\nDefense Evasion T1112 Modify Registry\n\nDefense Evasion T1202 Indirect Command Execution\n\nDefense Evasion T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\nDefense Evasion T1620 Reflective Code Loading\n\nDiscovery T1082 System Information Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1057 Process Discovery\n\nPersistence T1098 Account Manipulation\n\nPersistence T1547.001 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys /\nStartup Folder\n\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\n\nT1105 Ingress Tool Transfer\n\nT1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols\n\nT1102 Web Service\n\n\n**INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE**\n\n**CATEGORY** **TYPE** **VALUE**\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 5292c0f5a7ea80124cf7584eacea1881cf2f0814fa13dcc0de56624e215aaba2\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 32792827c14075cc3091244425e302b1ebe3259c\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 2fbccfc5a1b91b2609e3ae92a93ff7cb\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 9d063a05280fbce6ff0fd62a877f3fd1e80f227522e16918e6bede2e6ee398de\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 05241afa180d70e17647b2d8cbc1660adbe3af88\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 d86283af2d5888b0ce3ea63eb26f60f7\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 4c68c840ae1a034d47900ebdc291116726fd37b3ab0b7e026fad90eaab84d820\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 c9a5314eb247c7441a5262a7cd22abbe1fcba7b6\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 110c4ae194e7b49ed3e3b254d599f7f4\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 7f96d59cb02229529b14761f979f710bca500c68cc2b37d80e60e751f809475e\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 489c36c9ea3fb90f61209d43efffd8d997a362c6\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 9ec1fcb11b597941bec03078cccab724\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 23a09b74498aea166470ea2b569d42fd661c440f3f3014636879bd012600ed68\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 ad33bab4bc6232a6666c2190b3bf9fc2ab2a720a\n\n\n-----\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 454f59dc7d3d7f228bbd4ddd4c250ed8\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 729fb24b6c18232fc05ccf351edaeaa8a76476ba08cba37b8a93d34f98fa05ed\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 900cba1d73ddca31a7bb7b7af5b3b7f1a0bc6fbf\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 6bc8be27898e1e280e402a7981be55ae\n\n**DETECTION** **AND THREAT HUNTING**\n\n**SNORT #SSL_DECRYPT_ONLY**\n\nalert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:”CLUSTER25 NOBELIUM Registration\nvia Dropbox API”; flow:established,to_server; http.uri; content:”/2/files/upload”; http.header;\ncontent:”|22|path|22|”; content:”|22|/Rock_”; fast_pattern; distance:0; content:”.mp3|22|”; distance:0;\nhttp.host; content:”content.dropboxapi.com”; bsize:22; reference:url,cluster25.io/2022/05/13/cozysmuggled-into-the-box/; reference:md5,3f400f30415941348af21d515a2fc6a3; classtype:trojanactivity; sid:7704250; rev:1;)\n\n**SNORT**\n\nalert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:”CLUSTER25 NOBELIUM Backdoor\nDownload via Dropbox API”; flow:established,to_server; http.uri; content:”/2/files/download”;\nhttp.header; content:”|22|path|22|”; content:”|22|/Rock_”; fast_pattern; distance:0;\ncontent:”.mp3.backup|22|”; distance:0; http.host; content:”content.dropboxapi.com”; bsize:22;\nreference:url,cluster25.io/2022/05/13/cozy-smuggled-into-the-box/;\nreference:md5,3f400f30415941348af21d515a2fc6a3; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:7704251; rev:1;)\n\n**YARA**\n\n\n-----\n\nimport “pe”\nrule APT29_Loader_87221_00001 {\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = “Cluster25”\n\ntlp = “white”\n\ndescription = “Detects DLL loader variants used in Nobelium kill-chain”\n\nhash1 = “6fc54151607a82d5f4fae661ef0b7b0767d325f5935ed6139f8932bc27309202”\n\nhash2 = “23a09b74498aea166470ea2b569d42fd661c440f3f3014636879bd012600ed68”\n\nstrings:\n$s1 = “%s\\\\blank.pdf” fullword ascii\n\n$s2 = “%s\\\\AcroSup” fullword ascii\n\n$s3 = “vcruntime140.dll” fullword ascii\n\n$s4 = “ME3.99.5UUUUUUUUUUU” fullword ascii\n\n$c1 = “Rock” fullword ascii\n\n$c2 = “.mp3” fullword ascii\n\n$c3 = “%s.backup” fullword ascii\n\n$sequence1 = { C7 45 ??
