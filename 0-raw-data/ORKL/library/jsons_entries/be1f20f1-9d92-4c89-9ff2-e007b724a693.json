Read](https://www.recordedfuture.com/)_\n_Recorded Future’s_ _[version of this analysis.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/kraken-cryptor-ransomware/)_\n\nRising from the deep, Kraken Cryptor ransomware has had a notable development path in\nrecent months. The first signs of Kraken came in mid-August on a popular underground\n[forum. In mid-September it was reported that the malware developer had placed the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kraken-cryptor-ransomware-masquerading-as-superantispyware-security-program/)\nransomware, masquerading as a security solution, on the website SuperAntiSpyware,\ninfecting systems that tried to download a legitimate version of the antispyware software.\n\nKraken’s presence became more apparent at the end of September, when the security\n[researcher nao_sec discovered that the Fallout Exploit Kit, known for delivering GandCrab](https://twitter.com/nao_sec)\nransomware, also started to deliver Kraken.\n\nThe McAfee Advanced Threat Research team, working with the Insikt group from Recorded\nFuture, found evidence of the Kraken authors asking the Fallout team to be added to the\nExploit Kit. With this partnership, Kraken now has an additional malware delivery method for\nits criminal customers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found that the user associated with Kraken ransomware, ThisWasKraken, has a\npaid account. Paid accounts are not uncommon on underground forums, but usually\nmalware developers who offer services such as [ransomware are highly trusted members and](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/ransomware.html)\nare vetted by other high-level forum members. Members with paid accounts are generally\ndistrusted by the community.\n\n_Kraken Cryptor’s developers asking to join the Fallout Exploit Kit._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kraken Cryptor announcement._\n\nThe ransomware was announced, in Russian, with the following features:\n\nEncoded in C# (.NET 3.5)\nSmall stub size ~85KB\nFully autonomous\nCollects system information as an encrypted message for reference\nFile size limit for encryption\nEncryption speed faster than ever\nUses a hybrid combination of encryption algorithms (AES, RC4, Salsa20) for secure\nand fast encryption with a unique key for each file\nEnables the use of a network resource and adds an expansion bypass mode for\nencrypting all files on non-OS disks\nIs impossible to recover data using a recovery center or tools without payment\nAdded antidebug, antiforensic methods\n\nKraken works with an affiliate program, as do ransomware families such as GandCrab. This\nbusiness scheme is often referred to a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS).\n\nAffiliates are given a new build of Kraken every 15 days to keep the payload fully\nundetectable from antimalware products. According to ThisWasKraken, when a victim asks\nfor a free decryption test, the affiliate member should send one of the victim’s files with its\nassociated unique key to the Kraken Cryptor ransomware support service. The service will\ndecrypt the file and resend it to the affiliate member to forward the victim. After the victim\npays the full ransom, the affiliate member sends a percentage of the received payment to the\nRaaS developers to get a decryptor key, which is forwarded to the victim. This system\nensures the affiliate pays a percentage to the affiliate program and does not simply pocket\nthe full amount. The cut for the developers offers them a relatively safe way of making a\nprofit without exposing themselves to the risk of spreading ransomware.\n\nWe have observed that the profit percentage for the developers has decreased from 25% in\nVersion 1 to 20% in Version 2. The developers might have done this to attract more affiliates.\nTo enter the program, potential affiliates must complete a form and pay $50 to be accepted.\n\nIn the Kraken forum post it states that the ransomware cannot be used in the following\ncountries:\n\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nEstonia\nGeorgia\nIran\n\n\n-----\n\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyzstan\nLatvia\nLithuania\nMoldova\nRussia\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUkraine\nUzbekistan\n\nOn October 21, Kraken’s authors released Version 2 of the affiliate program, reflecting the\nransomware’s popularity and a fresh release. At the same time, the authors published a map\nshowing the distribution of their victims:\n\nNote that some of the countries on the developers’ exclusion list have infections.\n\n## Video promotions\n\nThe first public release of Kraken Cryptor was Version 1.2; the latest is Version 2.07. To\npromote the ransomware, the authors created a video showing its capabilities to potential\ncustomers. We analyzed the metadata of the video and believe the authors created it along\nwith the first version, released in August.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the video, the authors show how fast Kraken can encrypt data on the system:\n\n_Kraken ransomware in action._\n\n## Actor indications\n\nThe Advanced Threat Research team and Recorded Future’s Insikt group analyzed all the\nforum messages posted by ThisWasKraken. Based on the Russian language used in the\nposts, we believe ThisWasKraken is neither a native Russian nor English speaker. To make\nforum posts in Russian, the actor likely uses an automated translation service, suggested by\nthe awkward phrasing indicative of such a service. In contrast, the actor is noticeably more\nproficient in English, though they make mistakes consistently in both sentence structure and\nspelling. English spelling errors are also noticeable in the ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\nThisWasKraken is likely part of a team that is not directly involved in the development of the\nransomware. The actor’s role is customer facing, through the Jabber account\nthiswaskraken@exploit[.]im. Communications with ThisWasKraken show that the actor refers\nall technical issues to the product support team at teamxsupport@protonmail[.]com.\n\n## Payments\n\nBitcoin is the only currency the affiliate program uses. Insikt Group identified several wallets\nassociated with the operation. Kraken’s developers appear to have choose BitcoinPenguin,\nan online gambling site as the primary money laundering conduit. It is very uncommon for\ncriminal actors, and specifically ransomware operators, to bypass traditional cryptocurrency\nexchangers when laundering stolen funds. One of the decisive factors for the unusual choice\nwas likely BitcoinPenguin’s lack of requiring identity verification by its members, allowing\nanyone to maintain an anonymous cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nAlthough in response to regulatory demands cryptocurrency exchangers continue to stiffen\ntheir registration rules, online crypto casinos do not have to follow the same know-yourcustomer guidelines, providing a convenient loophole for all kinds of money launderers.\n\n_Bitcoin transactions associated with Kraken analyzed with the Crystal blockchain tool. The_\n_parent Bitcoin wallet is 3MsZjBte81dvSukeNHjmEGxKSv6YWZpphH._\n\n## Kraken Cryptor at work\n\nThe ransomware encrypts data on the disk very quickly and uses external tools, such as\nSDelete from the Sysinternals suite, to wipe files and make file recovery harder.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The Kraken Cryptor infection scheme._\n\nThe ransomware has implemented a user account control (UAC) bypass using the Windows\nEvent Viewer. This bypass technique is used by other malware families and is quite effective\nfor executing malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The technique is well explained in an article by blogger enigma0x3.](https://enigma0x3.net/2016/08/15/fileless-uac-bypass-using-eventvwr-exe-and-registry-hijacking/)\n\nWe analyzed an early subset of Kraken ransomware samples and determined they were still\nin the testing phase, adding and removing options. The ransomware has implemented a\n“protection” to delete itself during the infection phase:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe” /C ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3 > NUL&&del /Q /F /S\n“C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\krakentemp0000.exe”\n\nThis step is to prevent researchers and endpoint protections from catching the file on an\ninfected machine.\n\nKraken encrypts user files with a random name and drops the ransom note demanding the\nvictim to pay to recover them. McAfee recommends not paying ransoms because doing so\ncontributes to the development of more ransomware families.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kraken’s ransom note._\n\nEach file extension is different; this technique is often used by specific ransomware families\nto bypass endpoint protection systems.\n\nKraken delivered by the exploit kit bypasses the UAC using Event Viewer, drops a file on the\nsystem, and executes it through the UAC bypass method.\n\n_The binary delivered by the exploit kit._\n\nThe authors of the binary forgot during the compilation of the first versions to delete the PDB\nreference, revealing that the file has a relationship with Kraken Cryptor:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe early versions contained the following path:\n\nC:\\Users\\Krypton\\source\\repos\\UAC\\UAC\\obj\\\\Release\\UAC.pdb.\n\nLater versions dropped the PDB path together with the Kraken loader.\n\n## Using SysInternals tools\n\nOne unique feature of this ransomware family is the use of SDelete. Kraken uses a .bat file\nto perform certain operations, making file recovery much more challenging:\n\n\n-----\n\nKraken downloads SDelete from the Sysinternals website, adds the registry key accepting\nthe EULA to avoid the pop-up, and executes it with the following arguments:\n\nsdelete.exe -c -z C\n\nThe SDelete batch file makes file recovery much harder by overwriting all free space on the\ndrive with zeros, deleting the Volume Shadow Copies, disabling the recovery reboot option\nand finally rebooting the system after 300 seconds.\n\n## Netguid comparison\n\nThe earlier versions of Kraken were delivered by a loader before it moved to a direct\nexecution method. The loader we examined contained a specific netguid. With this, we found\nadditional samples of the Kraken loader on VirusTotal:\n\nNot only the loader had a specific netguid but the compiled versions of Kraken also shared a\nnetguid, making it possible to continue hunting samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Comparing versions\n\nKraken uses a configuration file in every version to set the variables for the ransomware.\nThis file is easily extracted for additional analysis.\n\nBased on the config file we have discovered nine versions of Kraken:\n\n1.2\n1.3\n1.5\n1.5.2\n1.5.3\n1.6\n2.0\n2.0.4\n2.0.7\n\nBy extracting the config files from all the versions, we built the following overview of features.\n(The √ means the feature is present.)\n\n\n-----\n\nAll the versions we examined mostly contain the same options, changing only in some of\nthem the antivirtual protection and antiforensic capabilities. The latest version, Kraken 2.0.7,\nchanged its configuration scheme. We will cover that later in this article.\n\nOther differences in Kraken’s config file include the list of countries excluded from encryption.\nThe standouts are Brazil and Syria, which were not named in the original forum\nadvertisement.\n\nHaving an exclusion list is a common method of cybercriminals to avoid prosecution. Brazil’s\naddition to the list in Version 1.5 suggests the involvement of a Brazilian affiliate. The\nfollowing table shows the exclusion list by country and version. (The √ means the country\nappears on the list.)\n\nAll the Kraken releases have excluded the same countries, except for Brazil, Iran, and Syria.\n\nRegarding Syria: We believe that the Kraken actors have had the same change of heart as\nthe actors behind GandCrab, who recently released decryption keys for Syrian victims after a\ntweet claimed they had no money to pay the ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\n_GandCrab’s change of heart regarding Syrian victims._\n\n## Version 2.0.7\n\nThe most recent version we examined comes with a different configuration scheme:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis release has more options. We expect this malware will be more configurable than other\nactive versions.\n\n## APIs and statistics\n\nOne of the new features is a public API to track the number of victims:\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic API to track the number of victims. Source: Bleeping Computer.\n\nAnother API is a hidden service to track certain statistics:\n\nThe Onion URL can be found easily in the binary:\n\nThe endpoint and browser Kraken uses is hardcoded in the config file:\n\nKraken gathers the following information from every infection:\n\nStatus\nOperating system\nUsername\nHardware ID\nIP address\nCountry\nCity\nLanguage\n\n\n-----\n\nHDCount\nHDType\nHDName\nHDFull\nHDFree\nPrivilege\nOperate\nBeta\n\n## Kraken infrastructure\n\nIn Versions 1.2 through 2.04 Kraken contacts blasze[.]tk to download additional files. The site\nhas Cloudflare protection to mitigate against DDoS attacks:\n\nThe domain is not accessible from many countries:\n\n\n-----\n\n## McAfee coverage\n\nMcAfee detects this threat with the
