Recently, we learned\n[of possible new infrastructure related to the threat actor known as OilRig (aka,](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/) [APT34 or](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/apt34)\n[Helix Kitten). In these situations, DomainTools works to understand the background for such](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-november-helix-kitten/)\ninfrastructure and any tendencies which may be revealed by their creation in order to learn\nhow given adversaries operate.\n\nAside from learning about adversaries, such efforts may also yield new, independent results\nthrough further research and analysis. In this case, a preliminary search of DomainTools\ndata yielded a number of interesting, related results to the initial domain:\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **Email** **I**\n\n\n**7hillsgastro[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-19**\n\n\n**aerialthomas101@yandex.com** **1**\n\n\n-----\n\n**ababab[.]biz** **2020-**\n**10-02**\n\n**alcirineos[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-05**\n\n**amazon-loveyou[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-12**\n\n**bargertextiles[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-27**\n\n**berqertextiles[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-27**\n\n**careers-ntiva[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-25**\n\n**cererock[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-02**\n\n**chinaconstructioncorp[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-15**\n\n**clearinghouseinternational[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-17**\n\n**connect-roofing[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-25**\n\n**exmngt[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-18**\n\n**hoganlouells[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-16**\n\n**hscminkjet[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-27**\n\n**huopay[.]top** **2020-**\n**10-11**\n\n**indeptheva[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-05**\n\n**jiabolianjie0[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-01**\n\n**jinkangpu[.]co** **2020-**\n**11-04**\n\n\n**diandianlai@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**user2020-clon@yandex.com** **N**\n\n**lzr0709000@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**N/A** **1**\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**cjay006@yandex.com** **7**\n\n**ibm.partners@yandex.com** **5**\n\n**N/A** **N**\n\n**cjay006@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**mitchd2@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**diandianlai@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**evaluationfront@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**lzr070900@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**user2020-clon@yandex.com** **N**\n\n\n-----\n\n**jlrootfile[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-20**\n\n**kent-lawfirm[.]net** **2020-**\n**11-12**\n\n**klwebsrv[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-26**\n\n**oculus-au[.]info** **2020-**\n**11-18**\n\n**pet188[.]biz** **2020-**\n**10-16**\n\n**petrochinas[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-15**\n\n**renrenbaowang[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-28**\n\n**renrenbaowang[.]net** **2020-**\n**10-28**\n\n**superrnax[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-15**\n\n**svn-stone[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-23**\n\n**us-customs[.]org** **2020-**\n**10-28**\n\n**virtual-slots[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-23**\n\n**virtualcaresadvisor[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-02**\n\n**wilsonconts[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-09**\n\n**wiqzi[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-24**\n\n**zj-tunq[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-18**\n\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**N/A** **1**\n\n**N/A** **N**\n\n**lovelead247@yandex.com** **N**\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**cjay006@yandex.com** **7**\n\n**diandianlai@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**diandianlai@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**phillip.char@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**zhovr04@yandex.com** **N**\n\n**domain45@yandex.com** **6**\n\n**giadafallaci@yandex.com** **2**\n\n**hostmaster@virtualcaresadvisor.com** **2**\n\n**user2020-clon@yandex.com** **N**\n\n**chr1styjoe@yandex.com** **1**\n\n**lovelead247@yandex.com** **N**\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral items stood out in the above list of related infrastructure, notably related to common\nemail addresses linked to registrations:\n\ncjay006[AT]yandex[.]com\nch1styjoe[AT]yandex[.]com\ndiandianlai[AT]yandex[.]com\nlovelead247[AT]yandex[.]com\n\nUsing DomainTools Iris, each of these observed email addresses become a launchpad for\ninvestigating additional, related infrastructure. Although at this point connections appear too\nweak to definitively tie activity back to OilRig behaviors, which is where this investigation\nbegan, we have nonetheless reached an interesting and potentially useful intermediate\nconclusion by identifying linked, suspicious network infrastructure.\n\n## Identifying Network Infrastructure\n\nMost notable among the common items above are those linked to the “cjay006” address:\n\n**Domain** **Email** **IP Address** **Mail Ex**\n\n**anhuisiafu[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **N/A** **mailhos**\n\n**boardexecutivemanagement[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **N/A** **mailhos**\n\n**boardsexecutives[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **198.54.117.197** **mailhos**\n\n**chinaconstructioncorp[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **77.55.219.100** **chinaco**\n\n**cornerstoneconect[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **77.55.217.184** **corners**\n\n**exmngt[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **198.54.117.197** **mailhos**\n\n**groupsexecutive[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **46.28.109.165** **groups**\n\n**lavalingroup[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **77.55.233.217** **lavaling**\n\n**mngtboard[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **46.28.109.164** **mailhos**\n\n**petrochinas[.]com** **cjay006@yandex.com** **77.55.216.70** **petroch**\n\n**stagmein[.]pl** **cjay006@yandex.com** **N/A** **N/A**\n\n[Several themes emerge in the above list, looking at the actual names used for domain](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/extrapolating-adversary-intent-through-infrastructure?utm_campaign=identifying-critical-infrastructure-targeting-through-network-creation&utm_source=Blog)\ncreation:\n\nMimicking corporate or executive themes (e.g., “boardsexecutives,” “mngtboard”).\n\n\n-----\n\nThemes linked to the People s Republic of China (PRC) (e.g., chinaconstructioncorp,\n“petrochinas,” “anhuisiafu”).\nConstruction or engineering company spoofing (in addition to “chinaconstructioncorp,”\n[“lavalingroup” is similar to Canadian engineering company SNC-Lavalin).](https://www.snclavalin.com/en)\n\nHosting patterns aside, reviewing registration and DNS data showed that some domains\nfeatured interesting Mail Exchange (MX) records referring back to the original domain. As\ndescribed in previous DomainTools blogs, identifying certain hosting and functional\ncharacteristics to infrastructure can yield insights into adversary activity. In this case, the\npresence of the MX records, especially for items such as the construction-themed domains,\nmay indicate use for phishing purposes.\n\n## Unearthing a Phishing Campaign\n\nResearching several malware repositories, DomainTools researchers uncovered multiple\nemails sent from the infrastructure described in the previous section. Reviewed messages\nare similar to the following item:\n\nEmail messages had the following purpose and themes:\n\n[Addressed to either the Russian state nuclear energy firm ROSATOM or its nuclear](https://rosatom.ru/en/)\n[fuel production subsidiary TVEL.](https://www.tvel.ru/en/)\nWritten in Chinese with a “password reset” theme.\nSent from the SNC-Lavalin spoofing domain.\n\nFurthermore, all samples identified by DomainTools contained a link to a common resource:\n```\n hXXp://iafflocal290[.]org/sapm/Poland/china[.]php\n\n```\nThe page presents a logon screen:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe page appears to be a straightforward credential harvester, submitting credentials\nentered into the form fields as a POST to the same hosting domain. The domain itself\nappears to be either an abandoned or compromised legitimate website associated with a\nlocal fire department in the United States.\n\nFurther research identified the above as a common spoofed logon page for likely credential\nharvesting purposes. Among other entities identified, DomainTools researchers uncovered\npages targeting:\n\nA major automobile manufacturer.\nA major automotive parts supplier.\nAn Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology company.\n\n## Purpose and Context\n\nThe activity above is interesting on several levels. While Canadian-based SNC-Lavalin has\n[operations worldwide, including in the nuclear industry, the company has no known links to](https://www.snclavalin.com/en/markets-and-services/markets/energy/nuclear)\nRosatom, TVEL, or Chinese nuclear projects. However, [Rosatom and](https://tass.com/russia/744031) [TVEL have](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/TVEL-delivers-fuel-for-China%E2%80%99s-experimental-fast-r)\n[significant operations involving Chinese reactor construction and development. Based on](https://www.rosatom.ru/en/press-centre/news/russia-and-china-signed-the-contract-for-russian-designed-npp-construction-on-the-new-site/)\nthese links, DomainTools assesses some possibility for phishing themes combining Russian\nnuclear organizations with Chinese construction and critical infrastructure entities against\nindividuals working on such projects.\n\n\n-----\n\nYet the samples in question all leverage the Lavalin theme, which does not align with any\nknown projects or activity. The combination of Canadian engineering company spoofing,\nRussian nuclear technology targeting, and Chinese language phishing messages is\ntherefore somewhat confusing.\n\nFurther research identified the credential harvesting pages associated with other entities,\nlargely with technology or manufacturing themes. Based on this information, a likely\nintention for the Lavalin-ROSATOM campaign would appear to be credential harvesting to\nfurther follow-on espionage and data theft. Unfortunately, insufficient evidence exists to\ndefinitively support this claim.\n\nWhile this investigation began by pivoting off of infrastructure linked to OilRig— associated\nwith [Iranian interests by multiple entities—there is nothing conclusive linking the identified](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-oilrig-read-my-lips/)\nphishing activity to behaviors associated with Iranian threat groups. This is especially the\ncase after uncovering the additional, similarly-structured logon pages targeting other\nindustries. At this time DomainTools cannot align the observed phishing activity with any\nknown, tracked threat actor.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat hunters and researchers need to incorporate third-party findings and investigations\ninto their own work to expand horizons and ingest new observations for subsequent\nenrichment. By expanding upon identified work and threat indicators, researchers can\nunearth related or potentially even completely separate campaigns that happen to overlap\nin certain characteristics.\n\nSuch is the case with the above investigation, where initial analysis of likely OilRig-related\nobservables revealed a phishing campaign targeting the Russian nuclear industry with\nChinese language characteristics, as well as several other manufacturing and technology\ncompanies. While much remains unknown about this newly identified campaign, we as\nthreat researchers now have awareness of and insight into the activity that was previously\nunknown based on dogged analysis and enrichment of third-party research.\n\n\n-----",
