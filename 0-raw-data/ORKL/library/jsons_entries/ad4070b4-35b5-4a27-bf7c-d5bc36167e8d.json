These applications\ninclude Firefox, Skype, MSN Messenger, ICQ and others.\n\nThe backdoor also contains code intended to take screenshots and record audio,\nincluding recording Skype calls.\n\nIn addition, the backdoor can be remotely updated. Servers that it connects to include\n83.236.140.90 and 207.158.22.134.\n\nWe do not know who created this backdoor and what it was used for.\n\nWe have no reason to suspect CCC's findings, but we can't confirm that this trojan was\nwritten by the German government. As far as we see, the only party that could confirm\nthat would be the German government itself.\n\nOur generic policy on detecting governmental backdoors or \"lawful interception\" police\n[trojans can be read here.](https://www.f-secure.com/virus-info/bdtp.html)\n\nWe have never before analyzed a sample that has been suspected to be governmental\nbackdoor. We have also never been asked by any government to avoid detecting their\nbackdoors.\n\nHaving said that, we detect this backdoor as Backdoor:W32/R2D2.A\n\nThe name R2D2 comes from a string inside the trojan: \"C3PO-r2d2-POE\". This string is\nused internally by the trojan to initiate data transmission.\n\nWe are expecting this to become a major news story. It's likely there will be an official\nresponse from the German government.\n\nMD5 hashes: 930712416770A8D5E6951F3E38548691 and\n_D6791F5AA6239D143A22B2A15F627E72_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
