By leveraging a large number\nof inconsequential bytes in their documents, they could increase the size of the documents\n\n\n-----\n\nto surpass the maximum file size restrictions that automated analysis platforms like\nsandboxes and anti-virus scanning engines enforce.\n\nThe initial emails were consistent with what has been commonly observed from Emotet in\nrecent years. They typically contained an attached ZIP archive containing a Microsoft Word\ndocument. An example of one such email is shown below.\n\nWhile the ZIP archives are often small, in some cases only ~646KB, the Microsoft Word\ndocument when fully extracted was ~500MB in size.\n\nThe document included a large number of 0x00 bytes, a technique commonly referred to as\n“padding.”\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the documents also featured excerpts from the classic novel “Moby Dick,” another\nattempt to increase the size of the documents for evasion purposes.\n\nThe Office documents featured templates consistent with those used by Emotet in the past,\nas shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Word documents in this campaign contained malicious VBA macros that, when\nexecuted, functioned as a malware downloader, retrieving the Emotet payload from\nattacker-controlled distribution servers and infecting systems, thus adding them to the\nEmotet botnets.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Emotet shifts to OneNote\n\n[Microsoft recently deployed new security mechanisms around protecting endpoints from](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\nmacro-based malware infections, which resulted in various threat actors moving away from\nOffice document-based malspam campaigns. In many cases, these malware distribution\ncampaigns switched to distributing OneNote documents instead, likely as a result of\ndecreased infections and lower success rates. Emotet is no different — shortly after their\nreturn to spamming operations on March 16, 2023, they began distributing OneNote files,\nas well.\n\nIn one example, the sender purported to be from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nand requested that the recipient complete the attached form.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attached OneNote document featured templates similar to what has been observed in\nother Office document formats over the past several years, prompting the user to click\ninside the document to view the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen clicked, an embedded WSF script linked behind the view button containing malicious\nVBScript code is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis VBScript downloader is responsible for retrieving the Emotet malware payload from an\nattacker-controlled server and infecting the system.\n\nMore recently, the embedded object inside of the OneNote files contained JavaScript\ninstead of VBScript but offered the same functionality within the infection chain.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nHovering over the next button indicates that an object called Object1.js will execute when\nthe button is clicked. This is because the attacker has embedded a clickable object behind\nthe lure image as shown below.\n\nThis object is a heavily obfuscated JavaScript downloader responsible for retrieving and\nexecuting the Emotet payload on the system. A snippet from the obfuscated downloader is\nshown below.\n\nIn a relatively short period, Emotet has modified its infection chain several times to\nmaximize the likelihood of successfully infecting victims.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nIndicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with ongoing Emotet campaigns can be found\n[here.](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/tree/main/2023/03?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n\n## Coverage\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
