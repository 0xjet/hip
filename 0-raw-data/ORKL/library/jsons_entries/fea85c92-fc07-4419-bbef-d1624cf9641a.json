While Insikt Group has not identified direct evidence\nof the targeting of US government and political campaign officials, open-source reporting has\nenabled us to establish a credible link.\n\n  - GreenCharlie highly likely operates at the behest of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\n(IRGC); due to its persistent and strategic remit, it is also likely to be associated with the\nIntelligence Organization of the IRGC (IRGC-IO).\n\n2 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n\n#### Infrastructure Analysis\n\n\nGreenCharlie infrastructure detections enable progressive tracking of threat activity believed to overlap\nwith infrastructure used to deliver malware such as POWERSTAR, NokNok, and GorjolEcho, in addition\nto enabling social engineering and phishing attacks. Since May 2024, we observed the group register\nmultiple dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains using a variety of providers that include Dynu, DNSEXIT,\nVitalwerks, Cloud DNS, FreeDNS, and Dia Systems. GreenCharlie hosted most of the identified\ninfrastructure in small clusters. However, in specific circumstances, domains uniquely resolved to IP\naddresses owned by different infrastructure providers. The majority of the infrastructure identified as\npart of this research was hosted on Scalaxy B.V. (AS58061) infrastructure. We also identified\nGreenCharlie infrastructure that used the OVHcloud (AS16276), Worldstream, NL (AS49981), M247\n(AS9009), and Podaon SIA (AS211381) providers for hosting.\n\nInsikt Group has continued to track GreenCharlie threat clusters since we last reported on the threat\ngroup in May 2024. We observed that GreenCharlie continues to register infrastructure via the\nNamecheap registrar (much of which is highly likely active) using themes that overlap with cloud\nplatforms, file sharing services, document visualization services, video conferencing, and\nauthentication-themed domains. These include domains that use terms like “cloud”, “uptimezone”,\n“doceditor”, ”joincloud”, and “pageviewer”, among others.\n\nGreenCharlie uses a multitude of top-level domains (TLDs) for domain registration. In the past we have\ndetected .xyz, .icu, .network, .online, and .site domain clusters registered by the group. As it pertains to\nthe cluster in this report, the majority were registered using the .info TLD. According to Recorded Future\ndatasets, as well as DomainTools, GreenCharlie threat actors used WHOIS privacy protection to\nobfuscate registration details.\n\n3 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n4 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - _37.148.63[.]24_\n\n  - _93.119.48[.]60_\n\n  - _5.106.153[.]245_\n\n  - _5.106.169[.]235_\n\n  - _5.106.185[.]98_\n\n  - _5.106.202[.]101_\n\n  - _5.106.219[.]243_\n\n5 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n6 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n7 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n8 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n9 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n|SHA256 Hash|C2 Domain|IP Address|First Seen|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|n/a|coldwarehexahash.dns-dynamic[.]net|38.180.123[.]231|2024-08-14|\n|n/a|readquickarticle.dns-dynamic[.]net|38.180.123[.]231|2024-08-14|\n|n/a|uptime-timezone.dns-dynamic[.]net|38.180.123[.]231|2024-07-20|\n|c3486133783379e13ed37 c45dc6645cbee4c1c6e62 e7988722931eef99c8eaf3|translatorupdater.dns-dynamic[.]net|38.180.123[.]113|2024-06-16|\n\n\n10 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n11 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n12 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n13 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n14 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains|T1583.001|\n|Resource Development: Establish Accounts: Email Accounts|T1585.002|\n|Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment|T1566.001|\n|Initial Access: Spearphishing Link|T1566.002|\n|Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell|T1059.001|\n|Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell|T1059.004|\n|Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder|T1547.001|\n|Persistence: Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task|T1053.005|\n|Discovery: System Information Discovery|T1082|\n|Discovery: Process Discovery|T1057|\n|Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols|T1071.001|\n\n\n15 CTA-IR-2024-0820 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Recorded Future reporting contains expressions of likelihood or probability consistent_\n_[with US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203: Analytic Standards (published](https://irp.fas.org/dni/icd/icd-203.pdf)_\n_January 2, 2015).
