We’re pleased to see\nactivity moving in the right direction.\n\n\n### Well done, Saudi Arabia!\n\n\nAfter a -12% decrease in the last reporting period,\nSaudi Arabia has finally dropped off the Top 20.

In 2022, a\ncracked version of its command and control (C&C) server\nleaked on underground forums, and its detection rates\nhave significantly increased.\n\nRanking #19, this report highlights that Brute Ratel\nC4 has been frequently detected due to its use by a\nLatrodectus affiliate, which employs Brute Ratel C4 as a\nloader in their campaigns.\n\n### RATs are on the prowl\n\nDespite significant decreases for DCRat (-59%), NjRAT\n(-33%), and AsyncRAT (-29%), Remote Access Trojans\n(RATs) remain the second most common malware type\nassociated with botnet C&C servers, representing 30.45%\nduring the reporting period.\n\nRATs are designed to enable attackers to control an\ninfected computer remotely. Once the RAT is operating,\nthe attacker can send commands to the compromised\nsystem to receive data in response.\n\nThe most prevalent RAT in this reporting period was\nRemcos, which saw a 72% increase between July and\nDecember 2024.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs, Jul-Dec 2024 (continued)\n\n### Android backdoors remain #3 \n\nThe number of botnet C&Cs associated with Android\nbackdoors rose to 20.01% between January and June\n\n**New entries**\n\n2024. However, over the last six months, it has decreased\n\nStealc (#16), Brute Ratel C4 (#19),\n\nslightly to 13.94%. Nevertheless, Android backdoors\n\nDanaBot (#20).\n\nremain the third most popular malware, due to a 152%\nincrease in Coper (#10).\n\n**Departures**\n\nCoper malware targets Android devices by bypassing Bashlite, Qakbot, RisePro.\nsecurity measures, taking remote control of the device,\nand stealing sensitive information.\n\n### Bye, bye Qakbot!\n\nWe are delighted to report that Qakbot has finally\ndeparted from the Top 20 malware associated with\nbotnet C&Cs!\n\nThis notorious malware first entered the charts in Q3\n2022 at #4, and quickly gained momentum. However,\nTuesday August 29th, 2023, the Federal Bureau of\n[Investigation (FBI), announced that it had taken](https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/malware/qakbot-the-takedown-and-the-remediation/)\n[control of the Qakbot infrastructure, in an International](https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/malware/qakbot-the-takedown-and-the-remediation/)\ncoordinated effort.\n\nDespite the takedown efforts, Qakbot activity continued\nto be reported, hence its presence in reports over the\npast year.

That said, .top (#2)\nhad a staggering 974% increase in the number of botnet\n\n**a brief overview**\n\nC&Cs (1514) it hosted between July and December 2024!\nThis is the third largest increase we have seen in the\nhistory of the Botnet Report.\n\n**Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\n\nIt is surprising though to see such a significant increase,\n[especially given that ICANN served a breach notice to .top](https://www.icann.org/uploads/compliance_notice/attachment/1225/hedlund-to-wenxia-16jul24.pdf)\nin July 2024, which, in part, was due to DNS abuse issues.\n\n### Reductions and departures \n\nWe’d like to congratulate all the registries that manage\nTLDs who departed from our listings! Along with those who\nsignificantly reduced the number of associated botnet C&Cs\nusing their TLDs, including .cfd and .site, who both saw a\n70% reduction.\n\n### Interpreting the data \n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains have\ngreater exposure to abuse. For example, between July\nand December 2024, .com had more than 154m domains,\nof which 0.00114% were associated with botnet C&Cs. **New entries**\nMeanwhile, .monster had approximately 50k domains, of\nwhich 0.148% were associated with botnet C&Cs. Both buzz (#18), biz (#20).\nare in the Top 20 of our listings. Still, one had a much\nhigher percentage of domains related to botnet C&Cs **Departures**\nthan the other.\n\n### Working together with the industry for  a safer internet\n\nNaturally, we prefer no TLDs to have botnet C&Cs linked\nwith them, but we live in the real world and understand\nthere will always be abuse. What is crucial is that abuse is\ndealt with quickly. Where necessary, if domain names are\nregistered solely for distributing malware or hosting botnet\nC&Cs, we would like registries to suspend these domain\nnames. We greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries\nwho work with us to ensure these actions are taken.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Jul-Dec 2024 (continued)\n\n\n### Top abused TLDs - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Jan - Jun**\n\n**2024**\n\n\n**Jul - Dec**\n\n**2024**\n\n\n**% Change** **TLD** **Type of TLD**\n\n\n**#1** 2,013 1,757 -13% com gTLD\n\n**#2** 141 1,514 974% top gTLD\n\n**#3** 198 331 67% xyz gTLD\n\n**#4** 224 230 3% net gTLD\n\n**#5** 122 186 52% shop gTLD\n\n**#5** 229 157 -31% org gTLD\n\n**#7** 232 150 -35% store gTLD\n\n**#8** 441 143 -68% online gTLD\n\n**#9** - 141 New entry click gTLD\n\n**#10** 367 111 -70% site gTLD\n\n**#11** 48 110 129% info gTLD\n\n**#12** 229 108 -53% sbs gTLD\n\n**#13** 68 91 34% cn ccTLD\n\n**#14** 50 84 68% ru ccTLD\n\n**#15** 60 80 33% cloud gTLD\n\n**#16** - 75 New entry monster gTLD\n\n**#17** - 67 New entry icu gTLD\n\n**#18** - 62 New entry buzz gTLD\n\n**#18** 189 57 -70% cfd gTLD\n\n**#20** - 55 New entry biz ccTLD\n\n\n**0** **500** **1000** **1500** **2000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,  Jul-Dec 2024\n\n### Huge increases at Nicenic \n\nWe have observed an enormous 757% increase of newly\nregistered botnet C&C domains at the Chinese domain\n\n**New entries**\n\nregistrar, Nicenic, knocking Namecheap (US) off the top\n\nArsys Internet,\n\nspot.

This was predominantly\ndue to Spaceship, Inc., and Sav, both experiencing a -63%\ndecrease.
