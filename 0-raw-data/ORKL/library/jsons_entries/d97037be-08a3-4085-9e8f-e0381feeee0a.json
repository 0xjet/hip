Per this model, developers supply file-encrypting malware to affiliates, who earn\nthe lion’s share from the money extorted from victims.\n\nWith REvil, the developers take 20-30% and the rest of the paid ransom goes to affiliates,\nwho run the attacks, steal data, and detonate the ransomware on corporate networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost work is done by distributors and ransomware is just a tool, so they think that s a fair\nsplit,” REvil representative, Unknown, told Russian OSINT.\n\nThis means that the developers set the ransom amount, run the negotiations, and collect\nthe money that is later split with affiliates.\n\n## Long list of victims\n\nThe cybercriminal operation has encrypted computers at big-name companies, among\nthem [Travelex,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/travelex-reportedly-paid-23-million-ransom-to-restore-operations/) [Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks (GSMLaw),](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-threatens-to-leak-a-list-celebrities-legal-docs/) [Brown-Forman,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-spirits-and-wine-giant-hit-by-cyberattack-1tb-of-data-stolen/) SeaChange\nInternational, [CyrusOne,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-data-center-provider-hit-by-ransomware-attack/) [Artech Information Systems,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-staffing-firm-artech-discloses-ransomware-attack-data-breach/) [Albany International Airport,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-hits-new-york-airport-systems/) Kenneth\nCole, and [GEDIA Automotive Group.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-threatens-to-publish-data-of-automotive-group/)\n\nUnknown says that REvil affiliates were able to breach the networks of Travelex and\nGSMLaw in just three minutes by exploiting a vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN left\n[unpatched for months after the fix became available [1,](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1213536922825420800) [2].](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1261710900890791938?lang=en)\n\nsource: [Bad Packets](https://badpackets.net/)\nREvil’s public-facing representative says that the syndicate has hit the network of a “major\ngaming company” and will soon announce the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey also say that REvil was responsible for the attack in September against Chile s public\nbank, BancoEstado. The incident prompted the bank to close all its branches for a day but\ndid not affect online banking, apps, and ATMs.\n\nAlong with managed services providers (MSPs) that have access to networks of multiple\norganizations, the most profitable targets for REvil are companies in the insurance, legal,\nand agriculture sectors\n\nAs for initial access, Unknown mentioned brute-force attacks as well as remote desktop\nprotocol (RDP) combined with new vulnerabilities.\n\n[One example are vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2020-0609 and](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0609) [CVE-2020-0610 bugs and](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0610)\nknown as [BlueGate. These allow remote code execution on systems running Windows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rce-exploit-for-windows-rdp-gateway-demoed-by-researcher/)\nServer (2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019).\n\n## New money-making avenues\n\nREvil initially made its profit from victims paying the ransom to unlock encrypted files. Since\nthe attackers also locked backup servers, victims had few options to recover, and paying\nwas the quickest way.\n\nThe ransomware business changed last year when operators saw an opportunity in stealing\ndata from breached networks and started to threaten victims with damaging leaks that could\nhave a much worse impact on the company.\n\nEven if it takes longer and causes a significant setback, large businesses can recover\nencrypted files from offline backups. Having sensitive data in the public space or sold to\ninterested parties, though, can be synonymous with losing the competitive advantage and\nreputation damage that is difficult to rebuild.\n\nThis method proved to be so lucrative that REvil now makes more money from not\npublishing stolen data than from decryption ransom.\n\nUnknown says that one in three victims are currently willing to pay the ransom to prevent\nthe leaking of company data. This could be the next step in the ransomware business.\n\nREvil is also thinking to adopt another tactic designed to increase their odds of getting paid:\nhitting the victim with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to force them to at least\n(re)start negotiating a payment.\n\n[SunCrypt ransomware used this tactic recently on a company that had stopped](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-add-ddos-attacks-to-their-extortion-arsenal/)\nnegotiations. The attackers made it clear that they launched the DDoS attack and\nterminated it when negotiations resumed. REvil plans to implement this idea.\n\n\n-----\n\nREvil s model for making money is working and the gang already has plenty in their coffers.\nIn their search for new affiliates, they [deposited $1 million in bitcoins on a Russian-speaking](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-deposits-1-million-in-hacker-recruitment-drive/)\nforum.\n\nThe move was designed to show that their operation generates plenty of profit. According to\nUnknown, this step is to recruit new blood to distribute the malware, as the ransomware\nscene is full to the brim with professional cybercriminals.\n\nAlthough they have truckloads of money, REvil developers are confined to the borders of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, countries in the former Soviet Union)\nregion.\n\nA reason for this is attacking a large number of high-profile victims that prompted\ninvestigations from law enforcement agencies from all over the world. As such, traveling is a\nrisk REvil developers are not willing to take.\n\n## REvil built on older code\n\nThis ransomware syndicate is also referred to as Sodin or Sodinokibi but the name REvil is\ninspired by the Resident Evil movie and stands for Ransomware Evil.\n\nTheir malware was first spotted in April 2019 and the group started looking for skilled\n[hackers (elite penetration testers) shortly after GandCrab ransomware closed shop.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-shutting-down-after-claiming-to-earn-2-billion/)\n\n\n-----\n\nUnknown says that the group did not create the file-encrypting malware from scratch but\nbought the source code and developed on top of it to make it more effective.\n\nIt uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that has a smaller key size than the RSA-based\npublic-key system, with no compromise on security. Unknown says that this is one reason\naffiliates choose REvil over other RaaS operations like Maze or LockBit.\n\nBefore shutting their business, GandCrab developers said they made $150 million, while\nthe entire operation collected more than $2 billion in ransom payments.\n\nClearly, REvil developer’s ambitions are greater.\n\nBleepingComputer was told that Unknown confirmed that the interview (in Russian) was\nreal.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZyQCQ1VZp8s\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
