UNC1151 is likely a state-backed threat actor [1] waging\nan ongoing and far-reaching influence campaign that has targeted numerous countries\nacross Europe. Their operations typically display messaging in general alignment with the\nsecurity interests of the Russian Federation; their hallmarks include anti-NATO messaging,\nintimate knowledge of regional culture and politics, and strategic influence operations (such\nas hack-and-leak operations used in conjunction with fabricated messaging and/or forged\ndocuments). PACT assesses with varying degrees of confidence that there are 81\nadditional, unreported domains clustered with the activity that FireEye and ThreatConnect\ndetailed in their respective reports [1,2,4]. PACT also assesses with High Confidence that\nUNC1151 has targeted additional European entities outside of the Baltics, Poland, Ukraine\nand Germany, for which no previous public reporting exists.\n\n**Situation Overview:**\n\nIn July of 2020, FireEye’s Mandiant released a threat intelligence report [1] on an influence\ncampaign they dubbed “Ghostwriter,” wherein they detailed a cluster of activity that\ndemonstrated an “anti-NATO agenda” that “primarily targeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia,\n\n\n-----\n\nand Poland with narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization s (NATO)\npresence in Eastern Europe.” In April of 2021, ThreatConnect published a Threat Intel\nUpdate [2] that included possible related Ghostwriter infrastructure spoofing military\norganizations in Poland and Ukraine, and quotes German investigative reporting [4] detailing\nGhostwriter activity against members of the German government and claiming a possible\nconnection to the Russian state. Later in April of 2021, Mandiant released an update to their\ninitial report [3], wherein they attributed at least some of the Ghostwriter activity to UNC1151,\n“a suspected state-sponsored cyber espionage actor that engages in credential harvesting\nand malware campaigns.” In May of 2021 (the following month), DomainTools released a\nreport consisting of UNC1151 infrastructure [5] that corroborated previous findings and\nincluded previously unreported infrastructure and network-based IOCs related to UNC1151.\nFinally, in August of 2021, VSQUARE released an exhaustive analysis [6] of the Ghostwriter\ninfluence campaign that corroborated previous findings linking Ghostwriter/UNC1151 activity\nto the Kremlin and detailing the group’s activity back to 2017 (and possibly earlier), during\nwhich time the group was identified using its phishing infrastructure to send targeted\nspearphishing messages and engaging in politically-destructive hack-and-leak operations.\n\nIt may assist the reader to detail a brief timeline of notable events of interest that were\nreliably reported and attributed [6]:\n\n_in 2014, attempts to gain access to the Polish Ministry of National Defence using the_\n_phishing domain `poczta.mon.q0v[.]pl` (later attributed to APT28)._\n_in 2016, similar attempts were made leveraging a phishing domain displaying a similar_\n_pattern: `poczta.mon-gov[.]pl`. The systems of the United States Democratic National_\n_Committee were breached by APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29 (Cozy Bear), likely_\n_operating independently. This access led to an infamous hack-and-leak operation to_\n_damage the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton._\n_in 2017, from March onward, an unidentified group was observed waging a European_\n_disinformation campaign dubbed “Ghostwriter” by FireEye._\n_in 2018, UNC1151 registers phishing domains, among them `poczta.mon-gov[.]ml`_\n_“with the clear intention of stealing data from the address employees used to log into_\n_their email.” The Lithuanian CERT also publishes a report on an attack later attributed_\n_to Ghostwriter [3]._\n_in 2019, the Lithuanian CERT publishes another [3] report on an attack later attributed_\n_to Ghostwriter._\n_in 2020 phishing domains were registered and structured in order to_\n_spoof poczta.ron.mil.pl, used by “employees of Poland’s Ministry of National Defence_\n_working remotely.” [6]. Additional phishing infrastructure is registered. Attackers gain_\n_access to the personal email of the chief of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of_\n_Poland. Various influence operations take place in Poland._\n\n\n-----\n\n_in 2021, UNC1151 was identified targeting the login credentials of German politicians_\n\n_[3]. Influence operations continue, but now inauthentic messaging is being spread from_\n_hijacked accounts as well as fake personas. Influence operations take place in_\n_Lithuania [6]. As a result of domestic strife, a well-known Belarusian opposition_\n_blogger’s flight is hijacked while en route to Lithuania and imprisoned. Previously_\n_observed phishing and influence operations continue into the summer._\n\nPACT identified overlapping TTPs throughout this investigation, notably the techniques used\nto carry out influence operations (e.g., phishing for credentials to engage in hack-and-leak)\nand domain and subdomain naming themes such as `poczta` and other Polish and Ukrainian\nwords. Previous reports [6] have attributed these overlaps in behavior displayed by distinct\ngroups (APT28, APT29, and UNC1151) to hypothesize that all this activity is related in some\nway to the Russian state generally and its intelligence apparatus specifically; PACT agrees\nwith this assessment: it is likely that UNC1151’s activity is either controlled or influenced by\nRussian intelligence services. PACT is not attributing the activity of APT28 and APT29 to\nUNC1151 or vice versa.\n\n**Actor Overview:**\n\nUNC1151 and the associated Ghostwriter campaign are broad in both scope and target;\nprevious reporting indicates targeting of audiences within the Baltic nations (Estonia, Latvia,\nand Lithuania) as well as Germany, Poland, and Ukraine. Analysis of phishing infrastructure\nfrom these reports indicates the group was targeting official government accounts (both civil\nand military) as well as personal accounts. Additional analysis by PACT indicates the\ntargeting of yet other audiences.\n\nPrevious reporting and additional analysis suggest that one of UNC1151’s behaviors is to\nuse root domains with common, seemingly-legitimate words and themes (e.g., `netaccount[.]online` or `login-telekom[.]online`) and then build upon them with specific, targeted\nsubdomains to create long URLs that make their phishing domains look legitimate (e.g.,\n`gmx.net-account.online` or `verify.login-telekom[.]online`). Additional examples appear\nelsewhere in this report and demonstrate UNC1151’s ability to craft convincing domains that\nallow them to capture credentials in highly-targeted spearphishing campaigns that can then\nbe used for follow-on influence operations: hack-and-leak and inauthentic messaging\n(sending forged or manipulated messages or posting inflammatory material from hijacked or\nfake accounts). This ability, combined with UNC1151’s reported capacity to understand and\nexploit pre-existing socio-cultural fissures to sow discord and angst in the targeted states (in\naccordance with Moscow’s security goals) can prove damaging and difficult to counteract,\nand therefore should be underscored.\n\nPACT identified domain and subdomain naming themes that indicated targeting of the\nfollowing audiences: Ukrainian and Polish government (particularly the defense sector)\n(image 1,2), European iPhone and iCloud users (image 3), the French Defense Information\nand Communication Delegation (DICoD) (a department of the French Ministry of the Armed\n\n\n-----\n\nForces) (image 4), and users of popular regional web service providers across Europe and\nRussia (images 5-8), as well as global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter, and\nFacebook (images 9,10).\n\nImage 1: Phishing domain crafted to target Ukrainian government\naccounts.\n\nImage 2: Phishing domain crafted to target Polish government\naccounts.\n\nImage 3: Phishing domain crafted to target European iCloud users.\n\nImage 4: Phishing domain crafted to target French DICoD accounts.\n\nImage 5: Phishing domain crafted to target meta.ua, a popular\nUkrainian web services provider.\n\nImage 6: Phishing domain crafted to target bigmir) net, a large\ninformation and entertainment portal based in Ukraine.\n\nImage 7: Phishing domain crafted to target “interia.pl”, a large\nPolish web services provider.\n\nImage 8: Phishing domain crafted to target “ukr.net”, a Ukrainian\nweb services portal.\n\nImage 9: Phishing domain crafted to target Twitter accounts.\n\nImage 10: Phishing domain crafted to target accounts of major social\nmedia and tech giants.\n\nUNC1151 has proven the effectiveness of these tactics, as hundreds of victims, including\nmembers of the Polish Parliamentary Intelligence Committee and the chief of the\nChancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, took the bait and gave attackers access to their\nprivate email accounts [6]. Unfortunately, the successful phishing of its targets is only an\ninitial, enabling feature of UNC1151’s operational methodology. The actor then uses that\naccess for follow-on influence operations.\n\n**Investigative Methodology**\n\n\n-----\n\nPACT leveraged Prevailion s unique visibility and proprietary intelligence platform, along with\nprevious public reporting, to identify patterns and cross-reference web infrastructure (e.g.,\nhistorical domain registration, TLS certificate, DNS, and hosting data) to aid in the\nidentification of additional UNC1151 infrastructure. PACT identified an additional 83 domains\nassociated with UNC1151 that have not been previously reported: 52 of which PACT\nassesses with High Confidence are or were part of UNC1151’s operational infrastructure,\nand 31 that PACT assesses with Moderate Confidence to be previously-used phishing\ninfrastructure for the actor’s targeted phishing campaigns.\n\nThe High Confidence cluster has been cross-referenced with previous public reporting and is\nlisted at the bottom of this blog; PACT also included the rest of the UNC1151 infrastructure\nfrom previous reporting for defenders’ and researchers’ convenience. This cluster includes\nthe phishing domains that PACT assesses with high confidence were intended to gain login\ncredentials for members of the French Defense Ministry’s DICoD. Much of this cluster\nappears designed to capture login credentials for official and personal accounts of Polish and\nUkrainian audiences (images 11,12); common subdomain themes are shared throughout\n(images 13-16). Activity related to this cluster of domains is ongoing, as evidenced by the\nregistration of `login-inbox[.]site` on 2021-08-20.\n\nImage 11: Phishing domain crafted to target official accounts of a\nPolish audience.\n\nImage 12: Phishing domain crafted to target personal accounts of a\nUkrainian audience.\n\nImage 13-16: Phishing domains displaying common subdomain\nthemes.\n\nThe Moderate Confidence cluster was identified using observed hosting commonalities,\nprevious reporting on widespread phishing campaigns [6], and commonalities of domain and\nsubdomain naming themes [2]. This cluster of activity was active as recently as July 2021,\nbut most of the domain registrations occurred in 2019 with expirations in 2020. The naming\nthemes indicate a targeted audience of Apple (iPhone and iCloud) users in Europe; nearly all\nroot domains have at least one subdomain that includes the words “apple” or “icloud”\n\n\n-----\n\n(images 17,18). Additional subdomains appear to target Paypal and OVH Telecom logins as\nwell (images 19,20). If PACT is correct in attributing this activity to UNC1151, this cluster of\nmostly-expired Moderate Confidence activity indicates a change in targeting around\n2020/2021, as Ghostwriter was primarily aimed at an audience in Poland, Ukraine, and the\nBaltics (as one can easily see with a quick glance at the subdomains in the High Confidence\ncluster). This Moderate Confidence cluster, by contrast, appears to have explicitly targeted\nEuropean iCloud users.\n\nImage 17: Phishing domain crafted to target Apple/iCloud\naccounts.\n\nImage 18: Phishing domain crafted to target Apple/iCloud\naccounts.\n\nImage 19: Phishing domain crafted to target Paypal users.\n\nImage 20: Phishing domain crafted to target OVH Telecom.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPACT is unable to verify that UNC1151 is a homogenous group with central direction; PACT\nalso cannot verify that all Ghostwriter activities were conducted by UNC1151, as PACT\nanalysts only have visibility into the web-based infrastructure. It is possible that phishing\ninfrastructure creation, credential gathering, access, and the influence operations were\ncentrally directed or controlled but carried out by different groups. It is clear, however, that\nthere is an overarching theme and direction to these activities. It is this theme and direction\nthat PACT has identified and continues to track under the UNC1151 actor, which\ncorroborates the reports cited below.\n\nPACT continues to track UNC1151 and the Ghostwriter campaign by leveraging Prevailion’s\nunique and unparalleled visibility into malicious infrastructure creation, and will publish\nfollow-on updates as they are identified and corroborated.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/07/ghostwriter-influencecampaign.html\n\n[2] https://threatconnect.com/blog/threatconnect-research-roundup-threat-intel-update-april1st-2021/\n\n\n-----\n\n[3] https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/04/espionage-group-unc1151-likelyconducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity.html\n\n[4] https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/wdr/hackerangriffe-105.html\n\n[5] https://www.domaintools.com/content/iris-report-unc-1151-domains.pdf?\nutm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=IOC\n\n[6] https://vsquare.org/the-ghostwriter-scenario/\n\n**Appendix (IOCs)**\n\n_PACT Assesses with High Confidence that the following domains are part of UNC1151_\n_operations; additionally, they do not appear in public reporting that has surfaced as part of_\n_PACT’s analysis:_\n\n1. account-signin.online\n2. bigmir-net.online\n3. bigmir-net.site\n4. com-firewall.site\n5. com-verification.site\n6. fr-login.website\n7. i-ua.site\n8. id-passport.online\n9. interia-pl.online\n10. interia-pl.space\n\n11. interia.site\n12. is-lt.online\n13. is-lt.site\n14. login-credentials.online\n15. login-inbox.site\n16. mail-i-ua.site\n17. mail-validation.online\n18. meta-ua.site\n19. must-have-oboron.space\n20. net-login.online\n21. net-login.site\n22. net-login.space\n23. net-login.website\n24. net-mail.space\n25. net-validate.space\n26. net-verification.site\n27. net-verification.website\n28. oborona-ua.site\n\n\n-----\n\n29. passport-account.online\n30. passport-yandex.online\n31. passport-yandex.site\n32. protect-sale.site\n33. receller.space\n34. sales-oboron.space\n35. signin-credentials.online\n36. signin-inbox.online\n37. signin-inbox.site\n38. uazashita.space\n39. vilni-ludi.space\n40. vp-pl.site\n41. vp-pl.website\n42. webmail-meta.online\n43. wirtualna-polska.online\n44. wp-dostep.website\n45. wp-firewall.site\n46. wp-pl.online\n47. wp-pl.site\n48. wp-pl.space\n49. wp-pl.website\n50. yahoo-com.site\n51. yahoo-com.space\n52.
