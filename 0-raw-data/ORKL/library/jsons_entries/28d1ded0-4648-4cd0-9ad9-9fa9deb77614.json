The\n\nUniversity’s web site served repackaged content from the\n\n[Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) with embedded](http://beefproject.com/)\n\nJavaScript content maintaining the potential to hook visitors’ web\n\nbrowsers, identify visited websites and domains, explore for\n\nvulnerabilities (we did not observe any auto­pwning), and provide\n\ntracking through evercookies. Even a partial listing of visited sites\n\ncan be sensitive and valuable information, and this sort of “sites\n\nvisited” data gathering via other techniques, like screengrabbing\n\nand keylogging, were observed in past APT incidents like the\n\n[Madi](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33693/the-madi-campaign-part-i-5/) [campaigns. Currently, it’s advisable to avoid the site.](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33701/the-madi-campaign-part-ii-53/)\n\nThe embedded BeEF content appears not to be fully configured,\n\n\n-----\n\nBeEF.\n\nThis incident is interesting because at the same time and a bit\n\nearlier, another group was heavily relying on repackaging open\n\nsource offensive security product in their toolset by deploying\n\nboth BeEF and Metasploit­produced components across a select\n\nset of strategic web compromises. This particular APT has years\n\nof low­tech elaborate social engineering schemes and re­\n\npurposed open source efforts under its belt.\n\nWhile we call them the NewsBeef APT, they have been reported\n\nin the past as Charming Kitten or Newscaster in 2014, social\n\nengineering their way into sensitive circles of trust with spoofed\n\nLinkedIn profiles and phony news media organizations.\n\nThey continue to be highly active, but this time, they are using a\n\nslightly more technical toolset. On one hand, they have\n\ndeveloped skills or discovered tools to compromise select web\n\napplications and sites, supporting their watering hole campaigns.\n\nOn the other hand, they have repackaged leaked bot source code\n\nand repackaged open source Metasploit and PowerSploit\n\ncomponents to produce and administer backdoors and\n\ndownloaders.\n\nNewsbeef/Newscaster will find a way to compromise a web site,\n\nusually the vulnerability appears to be CMS related, in an\n\noutdated WordPress plugin, Joomla version, or Drupal version.\n\nAttackers usually perform one of two things, Newsbeef has been\n\nperforming the first of the two:\n\ninject a src or iframe link into web pages or css sheets\n\ninject the content of an entire BeEF web page into one of the\n\ninternally linked javascript helpers\n\nThe injected link will redirect visitors’ browsers to a BeEF server.\n\nUsually, the attackers deliver some of the tracking and\n\n\n-----\n\nto exploit and deliver backdoors (we haven’t identified that\n\nexploitation activity in our ksn data related to this group just yet).\n\nSometimes, it is used to pop up spoofed login input fields to steal\n\nsocial networking site credentials. We also haven’t detected that\n\nin ksn, but some partners have privately reported it about various\n\nincidents. But we have identified that attackers will redirect\n\nspecific targets to laced Adobe Flash and other installers from\n\nwebsites that they operate.\n\nSo, the watering hole activity isn’t always and usually isn’t\n\ndelivering backdoors. Most of the time, the watering hole\n\ninjections are used to identify and track visitors or steal their\n\nbrowser history. Then, they deliver the backdoors to the right\n\ntargets.\n\nIn addition to the University site and the NewsBeef APT, in the\n\npast couple of months, we identified a variety of compromised\n\nsites around the world serving the BeEF. Most are cleaned up.\n\nDeployments to interesting and strategic web sites and their true\n\nreach on a global scale appears to be on the increase:\n\nMiddle eastern embassy in the Russian Federation\n\nIndian military technology school\n\nHigh conflict regional presidency\n\nUkrainian ICS Scanner mirror\n\nEuropean Union education diversification support agency\n\nRussian foreign trade management organization\n\nProgressive Kazakh news and politics media\n\nTurkish news organization\n\nSpecialized German music school\n\nJapanese textile manufacturing inspection corporate division\n\nMiddle Eastern social responsibility and philanthropy\n\nsurprisingly popular British “lifestyle” blog\n\nAlgerian University’s online course platform\n\nChinese construction group\n\nRussian overseas business development and holding\n\ncompany\n\nRussian gaming developer forum\n\nRomanian Steam gaming developer\n\nChinese online gaming virtual gold seller\n\nBrazilian music instrument retailer\n\n**BeEF Capabilities**\n\n\n-----\n\nease of use of toolkits like BeEF.\n\nBeEF itself is an open source collection of tools and tricks, some\n\nyears old, that combined together can effectively hook a visiting\n\nweb browser for evaluation and full exploitation. Because of its\n\ncapabilities, we have seen increased adoption of the framework\n\nfor the past year or so.\n\nBrowser enumeration and reporting\n\nPlugin enumeration and reporting\n\nRetrieve visited domains (based on an old browser cache\n\nfetch timing trick)\n\nSocial engineering via live sessions and phishing within the\n\nbrowser\n\nNetwork exploration, discovery, and exfiltration tunneling\n\nMetasploit exploit integration and autopwning\n\nEvercookie deployment for persistent tracking – multiple\n\nplatforms\n\nXSS evaluation and exploitation\n\nAt the same time, many of the techniques implemented are very\n\nold and public. The kit is extensible, customizable, and integrates\n\nwith metasploit for autopwnage. Some of the techniques were\n\ndiscussed during Jeremiah Grossman’s 2006 Black Hat\n\nconference presentation. The delay in deployment for techniques\n\nof this type indicates that some teams are dependent on open\n\nsource tool packaging and ease of use. We have seen this sort of\n\nreliance on both open source offensive toolkits and legitimate\n\n[software in the past from APT like Crouching Yeti, TeamSpy, and](https://securelist.com/blog/research/65240/energetic-bear-more-like-a-crouching-yeti/)\n\nnow the Newsbeef.\n\nFighting against the use of browser hooking frameworks\n\nfor identification, tracking, live session social engineering, and\n\nprecision and auto­exploitation effectively requires a mix of\n\n\n-----\n\nbased detection is required to fully handle more serious incidents.\n\nUnfortunately, these incidents are on the increase. You can\n\ndisable JavaScript in your own browser with NoScript, but that’s\n\nmuch like just moving to Lynx or a text­based browser – people\n\ndon’t want that because it kills functionality in the browser they do\n\nwant. A Chrome plugin that detects the BeEF cookie is easily\n\nevaded by serious players. And preventing the tracking methods\n\naltogether is another whole ball of wax, because much of the\n\nfunctionality is tied into legitimate web pages by third party\n\nmarketers and retailers.\n\nPreventing the social engineering sessions for credential theft\n\nand Metasploit exploit integration makes immediate sense and\n\ncan be incorporated at the network and more effectively at the\n\nhost level. AntiAPT can help wipe out most of an operation on the\n\nnetwork at scale, but these measures can be evaded as well. In\n\nother words, dealing with a determined attacker using tools like\n\nthis one is difficult.\n\n**References**\n\n[NEWSCASTER – An Iranian Threat Inside Social Media](http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/05/newscaster-iranian-threat-inside-social-media/)\n\n[The Browser Exploitation Framework Project](http://beefproject.com/)\n\n[Metasploit: Penetration Testing Software](https://www.metasploit.com/)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n\n##### THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG: AN UNEXPECTED TURN IN THE XDEDIC STORY\n\n\n##### OPERATION DAYBREAK\n\n\n##### XDEDIC – THE SHADY WORLD OF HACKED SERVERS FOR SALE\n\n\n-----",
