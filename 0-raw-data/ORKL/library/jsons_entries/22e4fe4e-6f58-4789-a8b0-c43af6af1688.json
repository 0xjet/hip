    "plain_text": "# Kingdom targeted by new malware\n\n**[phnompenhpost.com/national/kingdom-targeted-new-malware](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/kingdom-targeted-new-malware)**\n\nBy Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon, Rinith Taing\n\nThe Kingdom’s computer networks, including government servers, are reported to be the\ntargets of a virus unique to Cambodia and deployed through spam emails and phishing\ncampaigns, which lure victims with emails disguised as official communications, though\nofficials yesterday maintained they were unaffected.\n\nFirst reported by the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks over the weekend, the attacks are\na form of Trojan – or malware disguised as legitimate software – known as “KHRAT”, which\nbegan circulating in late June.\n\nAttackers used a weaponised Word document in an email attachment labelled “MIWRMP\nphase 3”, a reference to the $15 million World Bank-funded Mekong Integrated Water\nResources Management Phase 3 Project.\n\nAccording to the security firm’s report, the virus grants hackers “access to the victim system,\nincluding keylogging, screenshot capabilities, remote shell access and so on”.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe believe this malware, the infrastructure being used, and the TTPs [tactics, techniques\nand procedures] highlight a more sophisticated threat actor group, which we will continue to\nmonitor closely and report on as necessary,” Palo Alto’s report notes, adding that the attack\ncompromised Cambodian government servers.\n\nChea Pov, head of the Interior Ministry’s cybercrime unit, said while he was aware of the type\nof attack, he had received no indication government officials, websites or servers had been\naffected. “If this problem happens among our officials or institutions, they will submit the\ncomplaint to us, but now I have not seen any. If we receive any complaint, we will work out\nhow to deal with it,” he said.\n\nAccording to the World Bank website, the Mekong water management project is designed “to\nestablish the foundation for the effective management of water resources and fisheries in the\nproject areas of northeast Cambodia”.\n\nThe project also falls within the framework of the Mekong River Commission’s (MRC) work\non water management. Inquiries to the MRC and World Bank went unanswered yesterday.\n\nTe Navuth, general secretary of the project’s implementing partner, the Cambodia National\nMekong Committee, said he was previously unaware of the cyber threat. “Now that I know\nabout it, I will have to think first about how this issue should be dealt with,” he said.\n\nCybersecurity expert Niklas Femerstrand in an email yesterday pointed out that while servers\nin several different countries appear to be the origin the attack, it has been linked to the\nDragonOK campaign.\n\n“The DragonOK campaign has previously [in 2014] targeted organizations in Taiwan, Japan,\nTibet and Russia, and political organizations in Cambodia since at least January, 2017,” he\nwrote, adding that there are “strong indications” the campaign is “an operation funded by\nChina”.\n\n“They’re looking for any intelligence from anybody, and most probably this is linked to a wider\nAdvanced Persistent Threat operation . . . of which right now we are only seeing the iceberg\ntip,” he wrote, referring to a continuous covert hacking process used to target a specific\nentity.\n\nProfessor Carlyle Thayer, an Asian security expert at the University of New South Wales,\nnoted Chinese state-sponsored hacking is not necessarily always targeted, but did recall that\nearlier this year “Chinese directed phishing attacks against Cambodian citizens was\nreported”, and that some “seemed directed at opposition political parties”.\n\n“While some hacking is specific, other hacking efforts are designed just to gather information\nto expand files and data bases,” he wrote.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Femerstrand, the best protection is to not open unexpected attachments in\nemails from unverified senders and to be wary of external links in documents, in addition to\nkeeping antivirus software up to date.\n\n\n-----",
