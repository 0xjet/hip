The data was put for\nsale on several Dark Web marketplaces and is available for further purchase via a\nTelegram channel created by the bad actors.\n\nResecurity, Inc. (USA) is monitoring data leaks and the exposure of digital identity data in\nDark Web and has already alerted law enforcement and Thai CERT.\n\nBased on the acquired samples and additional insights related to the security incident, the\nbad actors were able to gain unauthorized access to the government portal allowing them\nto manage users and records illegally.\n\nAccording to the actors, they were able to steal sensitive and personal information\nincluding but not limited to last name, first name, sex, age, contact details, medical history,\nand related local healthcare identifiers:\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on further engagement it has been confirmed, the bad actors have attacked a\nWEB-app (https://longcovidcheckin.dms.go.th) provided by the Department of Medical\nSciences of Thailand for online-surveying and data collection surrounding COVID-19 from\ncitizens and tourists visiting the country.\n\nThe screenshots acquired via HUMINT (human intelligence) means by Resecurity’s\nHUNTER (threat intelligence and R&D unit) confirmed the source of the leak and\ncompromised WEB-resource:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe access was possible due to an active SQL-injection vulnerability in an authorization\nmodule of the WEB-app. According to OWASP Top 10 classification such vulnerabilities\nare extremely common issue exploited by hackers due to insecure parameters filtering,\nsuch vulnerabilities may lead to a significant risk of data breach. The Resecurity team has\naddressed the proper recommendations to contain vulnerability.\n\nAt the time of breach identification, the bad actors could have accessed at least to 5,151\ndetailed records with a potential exposure of 15,000 in total. The access could also be\nused to monitor further updates and the collection of new records in real time – which\nobviously negatively impact privacy.\n\nThailand is not the only region where cybercriminals hunt for personal and medical data.\nMost healthcare services in Thailand are available in digital form for citizens, that’s why\nthey're always an attractive target for cyberespionage groups, and other Dark Web actors\ncollecting information for malicious purposes, one example purpose is to use the stollen\ndata for further identity theft.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese types of attacks are becoming a common occurance, for example there was an\nattack which saw the release of over 230,000 Indonesian COVID-19 patient records in the\nDark Web. The leaked data consisted of name, address, present address, telephone\nnumber, citizenship, diagnosis date, result, result date, and many more.\n\nTo prevent yourself from being a victim of identity theft – subscribe to Resecurity® Identity\nProtection (IDP), a mobile app and interactive WEB-service featuring a dashboard for\ncontinuous 24/7 protection.
