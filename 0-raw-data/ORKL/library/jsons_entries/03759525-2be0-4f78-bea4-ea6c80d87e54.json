Based on our current knowledge, we have no indication that\nthe malware has been inadvertently distributed to customers or partners.\"\n\nAt the moment, the company said that it has successfully restored all operational processes\nimpacted in last month's malware attack. However, the company is still facing issues in\nsome countries with their email and telephone systems.\n\nMiltenyi Biotec added that customers should expect order delays caused by the temporary\noperational issues affecting systems during the last two weeks.\n\nClients are also advised to reach out whenever they have to deal with any urgent cases that\nrequired immediate assistance.\n\n\"Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you,\" Miltenyi\nBiotec added.\n\nCustomers experiencing difficulties can reach out using a list of alternative contact numbers\n[available here.](https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/about-us/customer-technical-support-1.html)\n\n## Mount Locker ransomware attack\n\nEven though Miltenyi Biotec has not disclosed the nature of the malware that caused the\noperational downtime during the last two weeks, the Mount Locker ransomware gang has\nclaimed the attack earlier this month.\n\nThe ransomware actors have leaked 5% out of the 150 GB of data they claim to have stolen\nfrom the company's network on their data leak site on November 4, 2020, in the form of a\nZIP archive containing just over 1 GB of Miltenyi Biotec documents.\n\n[Mount Locker ransomware became operational in July 2020 after they started to breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mount-locker-ransomware-joins-the-multi-million-dollar-ransom-game/)\ncorporate networks, stealing sensitive data and deploying payloads to encrypt systems on\nthe victims' network.\n\nMount Locker ransom notes seen by BleepingComputer show that, in some cases, the\nMount Locker ransomware gang is demanding multi-million dollar ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mount Locker ransom note**\nThe gang [launched a 'Mount Locker News & Leaks' site used to publish the stolen files of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mount-locker-ransomware-joins-the-multi-million-dollar-ransom-game/)\nvictims who refuse to pay the ransom.\n\nMount Locker is also known for threatening victims to contact the media, TV channels, and\nnewspapers if the ransom is not paid.\n\nUnfortunately, Mount Locker ransomware uses ChaCha20 + RSA-2048 and, at the\nmoment, there is no way to recover encrypted files for free.\n\nBleepingComputer reached out to a Miltenyi Biotec spokesperson for additional details but\ndid not hear back at the time of publication.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Mount Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mount-locker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Research](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/research/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
