The malware in question has ties to a\n[previously](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/konni-malware-under-radar-for-years.html) [reported malware family named KONNI, however, after careful consideration, we](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/a-quick-look-at-a-new-konni-rat-variant.html)\nbelieve enough differences are present to introduce a different malware family name. To reflect\nthe close relationship with KONNI, we chose NOKKI, swapping KONNI’s Ns and Ks.\n\nBecause of code overlap found within both malware families, as well as infrastructure overlap,\nwe believe the threat actors responsible for KONNI are very likely also responsible for NOKKI.\nPrevious reports stated it was likely KONNI had been in use for over three years in multiple\ncampaigns with a heavy interest in the Korean peninsula and surrounding areas. As of this\n\n\n-----\n\nwriting, it is not certain if the KONNI or NOKKI operators are related to known adversary\ngroups operating in the regions of interest, although there is evidence of a tenuous relationship\nwith a group known as Reaper.\n\nThe latest activity leveraging the NOKKI payload likely targets politically-motivated victims in\nEurasia and possibly Southeast Asia. These attacks leverage compromised legitimate\ninfrastructure for both delivery and command and control (C2). These compromised servers\nare largely located within South Korea. In total, we observed two waves of attacks spanning\nfrom early 2018 to at least July 2018 which we were able to cluster via the specific network\nprotocol used for C2. In addition, the decoy documents themselves wer both created and last\nmodified by an author named zeus. The zeus username is a recurring artifact witnessed in all\nof the discussed attacks in this report.\n\nJanuary 2018 Attack\n\nThe earliest observed attack delivering NOKKI took place in January 2018. This attack\nleverages a Microsoft Windows executable file using a PDF icon in an attempt to trick the\nvictim into launching the file. The malware sample contains the properties seen in Table 1:\n\n**MD5** 48f031f8120554a5f47259666fd0ee02\n\n**SHA1** 02ee6302436250e1cee1e75cf452a127b397be8d\n\n**SHA256** b8120d5c9c2c889b37aa9e37514a3b4964c6e41296be216b327cdccd2e908311\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**PDB String** C:\\Users\\zeus\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\virusdropper\\Release\\virus-dropper.pdb\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n**First**\n**Encountered**\n\n\n2018-01-26 00:14:31 UTC\n\n2018-01-26 03:10:12 UTC\n\n\n_Table 1 January NOKKI properties_\n\nThe malware is capable of collecting information on the victim machine, dropping, and\nexecuting a payload, as well as dropping and opening a decoy document.\n\nThe malware will collect data from the victim machine and write this information to\nLOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft Updatea\\uplog.tmp. The following information is collected from\nthe victim:\n\nIP Address\nHostname\nUsername\n\n\n-----\n\nDrive Information\nOperating System Information\nInstalled Programs\n\nThis specific function shares significant code overlap with the KONNI tool first discovered by\n[Talos.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/konni-malware-under-radar-for-years.html)\n\nThe NOKKI payload is written to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft\nUpdatea\\svServiceUpdate.exe prior being executed in a new process. Persistence is achieved\nby writing the file path to the HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\svstartup\nregistry key.\n\nAfter being executed and establishing persistence, NOKKI then connects to 101.129.1[.]104\nfor C2 communication via FTP. This IP does not have a domain name resolution; however,\nWHOis shows the IP assigned to China Central Television.\n\nThe decoy document is written to the same file path as the initial dropper, however, the\nextension is renamed to .pdf and becomes a legitimate document.\n\nBased on the decoy document contents and language, the attack may target\n\nCambodian speakers with an interest in Cambodian political matters.\n\nFigure 1 shows the decoy document used for this sample:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Decoy document for_\n_b8120d5c9c2c889b37aa9e37514a3b4964c6e41296be216b327cdccd2e908311_\n\nApril 2018 Attack\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early April 2018, another attack was observed delivering the NOKKI payload. This attack\nleveraged a malicious executable with an .scr extension that had the original filename referring\nto the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its contents can be found online.\n\nThe file contains the properties as seen in Table 2:\n\n**MD5** 42fbea771f3e0ff04ac0a1d09db2a45e\n\n**SHA1** 2b6b6f24f58072a02f03fa04deaccce04b6bb43b\n\n**SHA256** 9bf634ff0bc7c69ffceb75f9773c198944d907ba822c02c44c83e997b88eeabd\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**PDB String** C:\\Users\\zeus\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\virusdropper\\Release\\virus-dropper.pdb\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n**First**\n**Encountered**\n\n\n2018-04-04 21:06:26 UTC\n\n2018-04-04 12:55:38 UTC\n\n\n_Table 2 April NOKKI Properties_\n\nThis sample contained the same PDB string within it as sample from January 2018.\nFunctionally, it was nearly identical in its behavior as the previous attack.\n\nUnlike the previously witnessed attack that possibly targeted Cambodian language speakers\nwith an interest in Cambodian political matters, the decoy document used in this attack is\nwritten Cyrillic and contains content related to Russian political matters.\n\nOnce the .scr file is executed, the NOKKI payload is installed onto the victim host which then\nconnects to the IP resolving to a likely compromised but legitimate South Korean science and\ntechnology university website.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Decoy document for_\n_9bf634ff0bc7c69ffceb75f9773c198944d907ba822c02c44c83e997b88eeabd_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe content of the decoy document in Figure 2 is a publicly available. Google Translate\nroughly translates to the following:\n\nAbout the meeting of the State Secretary - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia GB\nKarasin and the Director of the Institute of Strategic and Interregional Studies under the\nPresident of Uzbekistan, VI Norov\n\nA second sample was discovered in April 2018, also written Cyrillic and containing content\nrelated to Russian political matters. This file had the following properties as seen in Table 3:\n\n**MD5** 88587c43daff30cd3cc0c913a390e9df\n\n**SHA1** 1cc8ceeef9a2ea4260fae03368a9d07d56e8331b\n\n**SHA256** 07b90088ec02ef6757f6590a62e2a038ce769914139aff1a26b50399a31dcde9\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**PDB String** C:\\Users\\zeus\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\virusdropper\\Release\\virus-dropper.pdb\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n**First**\n**Encountered**\n\n\n2018-04-24 16:42:03 UTC\n\n2018-04-24 06:34:35 UTC\n\n\n_Table 3 Second April NOKKI Properties_\n\nAgain, we see consistency both in the embedded PDB string, as well as the functionality of the\nsample itself. This particular sample connects to an IP address to which a likely legitimate but\ncompromised website of a research institute in South Korea resolves. This server has also\nlikely been compromised and repurposed by the adversary.\n\nMay 2018 Attack\n\nIn May 2018, Unit 42 observed an attack using malware with a filename of briefinglist.exe\nbeing downloaded from the somewhat redacted following URL. Again, it is a likely\ncompromised but legitimate South Korean website and the contents written Cyrillic and\ncontaining content related to Russian political matters.\n\nhttp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/de/de_includes/mail/yandex.ru/download.php\n\nThis sample has the following properties as seen in Table 4:\n\n**MD5** ae27e617f4197cd30cc09fe784453cd4\n\n**SHA1** dc739ca07585eab7394843bc4dba2faca8e5bfe0\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** 9b1a21d352ededd057ee3a965907126dd11d13474028a429d91e2349b1f00e10\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**PDB String** C:\\Users\\zeus\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\virusdropper\\Release\\virus-dropper.pdb\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2018-04-30 17:48:08 UTC\n\n\n_Table 4. Third May NOKKI Properties_\n\nThis sample remains consistent with previous samples of NOKKI in terms of functionality and\nthe embedded PDB string.\n\nThe payload communicates with 145.14.145[.]32, which resolves to files.000webhost[.]com.\nThis same host was witnessed in previously reported KONNI malware activity.\n\nJuly 2018 Attack\n\nIn July 2018, a South Korean engineering organization was identified as compromised and\nhosting malware and C2 infrastructure on their webserver since at least May 2018. Again, a\nfile in Cyrillic with a name referring to the Russian political matters was being distributed from\nthe http://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/common URL.\n\nUnlike attacks leading up to this point, an executable file was not used as the initial malware\nfile. Instead, this attack used a Microsoft Word document leveraging malicious macros to\ndeliver the payload to the victim. Upon opening the file and enabling macros, the document\ndownloaded both the payload and displayed a decoy document referencing political matters.\n\nNOKKI Malware Family\n\nFrom the samples discussed in this blog, we were able to identify two distinct variants of\nNOKKI. The earlier variant witnessed in attacks between January 2018 to May 2018 made use\nof FTP for C2 communications. Alternatively, the newer variant witnessed since June 2018\nmade use of HTTP. While both variants used different network protocols for communication,\nthey both used the same file path structure on the remote C2 server.\n\nThe older variant begins by looking for the presence of the following file:\n\n%TEMP%\\ID56SD.tmp\n\nIf this file does not exist, the malware will generate a random string of 10 upper-case\nalphabetic characters. This string will ultimately be used as the victim’s identifier. It will also\ncreate the %TEMP%\\stass file and write the value of a to it.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware continues to spawn a new thread that is responsible for network communication.\nWithin an infinite loop, this malware will continue connecting to its C2 server via FTP.\n\nAfter successful connection to the C2, it will write the previously written stass file to the\nserver’s public_html folder. It will also upload the previously created uplog.tmp file to the\nremote server. After the upload is completed, NOKKI will then delete the local copy on the\ninfected host. Finally, NOKKI will check for the presence of the [id]-down file on the C2 server,\nwhere [id] is the 10 character alphabetic string created prior. Should this file exist, it will be\ndownloaded and written to %TEMP%\\svchostav.exe prior to being executed in a new process.\nAfter it is executed, the malware deletes the file on the C2 server. The malware will then sleep\nfor 15 minutes between loops.\n\nThe newer variant operates in a slightly different manner.\n\nIn this case, NOKKI begins by extracting and dropping an embedded DLL to the\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft UpdateServices\\Services.dll path. One of two DLLs may be\ndropped, either a 32-bit or a 64-bit compiled options. The appropriate DLL will be dropped\nbased on the victim host’s CPU architecture.\n\nWhile these DLLs are different architectures, they perform the same functions. After the DLL is\nwritten, the malware loads it via the following command-line:\n\nrundll32.exe [%LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft UpdateServices\\Services.dll] install\n\nFinally, the malware will write the following registry key to ensure persistence on the victim\nhost:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\qivService C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\rundll32.exe \"[%LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft\nUpdateServices\\Services.dll]\" install\n\nThe payload’s install function makes a call to SetWindowsHookEx with a thread ID of 0,\nresulting in the function being injected into every GUI process running on the victim machine.\n[This particular process is referenced in this forum post.](http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/40385-creating-global-api-hook-using-windows-hook/)\n\nThe DllMain function of this payload begins by comparing the process executable name,\nseeking out the explorer.exe process. In the event it is not loaded in the context of this\nprocess, nothing occurs. If the malware is running within explorer.exe, it will load its own\nHTTPStart exported function, which performs the malicious actions.\n\nIt begins by writing the ID56SD.tmp file in its current working directory (CWD). A unique\nrandomly chosen 10-byte alphabetic string is written to this file, which will be used as an\nidentifier for the victim. A file named stass is also written in the CWD, with a single byte of a.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload proceeds to enter an infinite loop, with a 15 minute delay between iterations. The\nloop begins by reading in the previously written stass file and uploading it to its embedded C2\nserver via HTTP.\n\nThe data is encoded with base64 and uploaded via a POST parameter of data. Additionally,\nthe victim’s identifier and the current timestamp is uploaded via a POST parameter of subject.\n\n_Figure 3 HTTP request made by NOKKI payload_\n\nAfter this upload request is made, the malware looks for the presence of a file named\nuplog.tmp. In the event this file exists, it is uploaded via the same method as previously noted.\nAfter this file is uploaded via HTTP, the local file is deleted. While this file is not present\noriginally in this malware sample, in other NOKKI variants, it has been observed containing the\nvictim’s system information.\n\nThe malware then looks for the presence of the upfile.tmp file. Again, if this file exists, it is\nuploaded to the remote server and the local file is deleted.\n\nFinally, the malware will look for the presence of the following remote files, where [id] is the\nvictim identifier:\n\nhttp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/down\nhttp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/data/[id]-down\n\nIf the down file is available, it is written to %TEMP%\\wirbiry2jsq3454.exe and executed. If the\n\n[id]-down file is available, it is written to %TEMP%\\weewyesqsf4.exe and executed.\n\nDuring execution, a remote module was downloaded from the down URL:\n\nThis module is responsible for collecting the following information and writing it to the\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft UpdateServices\\uplog tmp file:\n\n\n-----\n\nIP Address\nHostname\nUsername\nDrive Information\nOperating System Information\nInstalled Programs\n\nThis module acted in an identical way as the information collection function witnessed in the\nolder variant of NOKKI.\n\nComparison to KONNI\n\nThe NOKKI malware family differs from KONNI in a number of ways. Unlike KONNI, NOKKI is\nmodular in nature, with multiple steps taken between the initial infection and the final\npayload(s) being delivered. Early versions of NOKKI observed between January 2018 to May\n2018 used a remote FTP server to ultimately accept commands and download additional\nmodules. While newer versions of NOKKI starting in June 2018 use HTTP, the communication\nis quite different from the previously reported KONNI malware, both in the URI structure and\ndata being sent. In addition, while the KONNI samples used C2 infrastructure set up\nspecifically by the adversary, NOKKI mostly leveraged what appeared to be likely\ncompromised legitimate servers for their infrastructure.\n\n**NOKKI URIs** **Previously Reported KONNI URIs**\n\n/./pds/data/upload.php /login.php\n\n/./pds/data/[victim_id]-down /upload.php\n\n/./pds/down /download.php\n\n/common/exe /weget/uploadtm.php\n\n/common/doc /weget/upload.php\n\n_Table 5. URI differences between NOKKI and KONNI_\n\nWhile we consider these malware families to be separate, we identified some similarities with\nKONNI. In addition to overlapping infrastructure between KONNI and NOKKI, a NOKKI module\nused to collect victim information was observed exhibiting very similar characteristics to the\nKONNI victim information collection function as seen in Figure 4. This same function was also\nobserved in early instances of the dropper used to deploy NOKKI between January 2018 and\nMay 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Similarities between KONNI malware family and NOKKI module_\n\nBased on the similarities witnessed, we think it is highly probable there is some amount of\ncode sharing and likely a single adversary group involved.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe adversary operating the NOKKI malware family appears to have begun using NOKKI in\nJanuary 2018 and has continued their activity through 2018. At this time, we can only\nspeculate who these series of attacks may be attributed to based on tenuous relationships.\nHowever, there is significant evidence from our attack telemetry and victimology indicating the\noperator has a strong interest in specific regions of the world such as Eurasia, the Korean\nPeninsula, and Southeast Asia. The general tactics used to deliver NOKKI are similar in nature\nto the actors behind a previously identified malware, KONNI. Additionally, there are overlaps\n\n\n-----\n\nboth in code and some infrastructure with previously reported KONNI activity. Unlike KONNI,\nhowever, this particular malware family makes use of compromised servers for both hosting\nand C2 operations.\n\nThe NOKKI malware itself has been updated in the short period of time it has been observed,\nmoving from FTP to HTTP for C2 operations. The malware is modular in nature, and based on\nanalysis of the information gathering module, it is highly likely the NOKKI operators are the\nsame as the KONNI operators. Unit 42 will continue to monitor this malware family and the\nthreat actor responsible.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by the following:\n\nAll known samples of NOKKI maintain a malware verdict in WildFire\n[AutoFocus customers may learn more via the NOKKI tag](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.NOKKI)\n\nAppendix\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**July 2018 Attack**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n\n\nHash d92c94423ec3d01ad584a74a38a2e817449648a4da3f12d345c611edc5c4cdbd\n\nHash dce53e59b0c48e269dadc766a78667a14f11b72c49f57d95abde62c84ac8d7ae\n\nHash 0657f788e89a437a1e6fe2630c19436736aa55dcf255540698864a7576192611\n\nHash d211815177ce4b9fd2d3c258d2fc6282c23b8458d71f8f6f0df06a9dda89c12f\n\nProcess rundll32.exe [%LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft UpdateServices\\Services.dll]\ninstall\n\n\nRegistry\nKey\n\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\qivService\n\n\nFile ID56SD.tmp\n\nFile stass\n\nFile %LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft UpdateServices\\uplog.tmp\n\nFile %TEMP%\\wirbiry2jsq3454.exe\n\nFile %TEMP%\\weewyesqsf4.exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/data/upload.php\n\n\n-----\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/down\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/data/[id]-down\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/common\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/common/exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/common/doc\n\n**June 2018 Attack**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n\n\nHash 5137f6a59c2c7a54f1a5fc9a9650972b17d52dd0e203f5abefedf5c593c41ff0\n\nHash fd673703c502be907919a4ff2922b7b969d96d206abc572a5cb83e69ab32ca18\n\nHash 4e84f97bb61c2d373a574676fa374131460839ecc7b53064f558ce7ce55528ad\n\nHash fd673703c502be907919a4ff2922b7b969d96d206abc572a5cb83e69ab32ca18\n\nHash 74ddd56b1e33aa3752f143a77e5802a5803fd2c222f2cca77bfa5c740dfc8f5e\n\nProcess rundll32.exe [%LOCALAPPDATA%\\MicroSoft UpdateServices\\Services.dll]\ninstall\n\n\nRegistry\nKey\n\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\qivService\n\n\nFile ID56SD.tmp\n\nFile stass\n\nFile uplog.tmp\n\nFile %TEMP%\\wirbiry2jsq3454.exe\n\nFile %TEMP%\\weewyesqsf4.exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/data/upload.php\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/down\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/./pds/data/[id]-down\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/common\n\n**May 2018 Attack**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n\n\nHash 9b1a21d352ededd057ee3a965907126dd11d13474028a429d91e2349b1f00e10\n\nHash c3172b403068aabc711b7cbe4d923ae1fa705ce11c4cc71271fde83ce751c21c\n\nFolder %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\n\nFile %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\\svServiceUpdate.exe\n\nFile %TEMP%\\uplog.tmp\n\nFile %STARTUP%\\Antdule.lnk\n\nFile %TEMP%\\ID56SD.tmp\n\nFile %TEMP%\\svchostav.exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/de/de_includes/mail/yandex.ru/download.php\n\n**April 2018 Attack**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n\n\nHash 07b90088ec02ef6757f6590a62e2a038ce769914139aff1a26b50399a31dcde9\n\nHash d5fc0ef2d1ed037b5b6389882f9bb4ea15a6b41f21cdc0f5e90752f4e687445c\n\nFolder %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\n\nFile %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\\svServiceUpdate.exe\n\nFile %TEMP%\\uplog.tmp\n\nFile %STARTUP%\\Antdule.lnk\n\nFile %TEMP%\\ID56SD.tmp\n\nFile %TEMP%\\svchostav.exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/de/de_includes/mail/yandex.ru/download.php\n\nIP Address 210.112.239[.]74\n\n**Early April 2018 Attack**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n\n\n-----\n\nHash 9bf634ff0bc7c69ffceb75f9773c198944d907ba822c02c44c83e997b88eeabd\n\nHash c07bea0928a35b9292eebab32563378d01d95434d098e5c7c076e94866a14212\n\nFolder %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\n\nFile %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\\svServiceUpdate.exe\n\nFile %TEMP%\\uplog.tmp\n\nFile %STARTUP%\\Antdule.lnk\n\nFile %TEMP%\\ID56SD.tmp\n\nFile %TEMP%\\svchostav.exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/de/de_includes/mail/yandex.ru/download.php\n\n\nIP\nAddress\n\n\n141.223.125[.]112\n\n\n**January 2018 Attack**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n\n\nHash b8120d5c9c2c889b37aa9e37514a3b4964c6e41296be216b327cdccd2e908311\n\nHash 0d98ca35b29d2a9f7ca6908747c457ebdba999f0e83e182f770848e2335ade5b\n\nFolder %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\n\nFile %LOCALAPPDATA\\MicroSoft Update1\\svServiceUpdate.exe\n\nFile %TEMP%\\uplog.tmp\n\nFile %STARTUP%\\Antdule.lnk\n\nFile %TEMP%\\ID56SD.tmp\n\nFile %TEMP%\\svchostav.exe\n\nURL hxxp://mail.[removed].co[.]kr/de/de_includes/mail/yandex.ru/download.php\n\n\nIP\nAddress\n\n\n101.129.1[.]104\n\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n\n-----\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
