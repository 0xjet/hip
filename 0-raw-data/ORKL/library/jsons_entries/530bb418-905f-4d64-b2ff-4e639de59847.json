Opening the decoy file redirects the\nmessage recipient to a web page prompting the user to save an ISO file.\n\nBut unlike other attacks that route the victim to a phishing domain set up explicitly for downloading\nthe next-stage malware, the latest RAT campaign cleverly uses JavaScript to locally create the ISO\nfile from a Base64-encoded string and mimic the download process.\n\n\"The ISO download is not generated from a remote server but from within the victim's browser by a\nJavaScript code that's embedded inside the HTML receipt file,\" Dereviashkin explained.\n\nWhen the victim opens the ISO file, it is automatically mounted as a DVD Drive on the Windows\nhost and includes either a .BAT or a .VBS file, which continues the infection chain to retrieve a nextstage component via a PowerShell command execution.\n\nThis results in the execution of a .NET module in-memory that subsequently acts as a dropper for\nthree files — one acting as a trigger for the next — to finally deliver AsyncRAT as the final payload,\nwhile also checking for antivirus software and setting up Windows Defender exclusions.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nRATs such as AsyncRAT are typically used to forge a remote link between a threat actor and a\nvictim device, steal information, and conduct surveillance through microphones and cameras. They\nprovide an array of advanced capabilities that give the attackers the ability to fully monitor and\ncontrol the compromised machines.\n\nMorphisec also pointed out the campaign's advanced tactics, which it said allowed the malware to\n[slip through virtually](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1241b9486d3d7c74c0bb1f2a7bdd81ff9597b2c92f2af8a5b3819b296c400336) [undetected by most antimalware engines despite the operation being in effect](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/50d308118008908832fe9c7fa78169ef8aaa960450c788a2c41af0eb5e0a62db)\nfor close to five months.\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
