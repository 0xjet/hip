This is not about\n[classic spyware or Trojans, but so-called stalkerware.](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/stalkerware-spouseware/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\n\nNumber of unique users attacked by stalkerware in 2018–2019\n\nStalkerware can be divided into two major categories:\n\nTrackers.\nFull-fledged tracking apps.\n\nThe creators of trackers generally focus on two main features: tracking victims’ coordinates\nand intercepting text messages. Until recently, many such apps, mostly free, were available\n[on the official Google Play marketplace. After Google Play changed its policy in late 2018,](https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security-deception/malicious-behavior/)\nmost of them were removed from the store, and most developers pulled support for their\nproducts. However, such trackers can still be found on their developers’ and third-party sites.\n\nIf such an app gets onto a device, messages and data about the user’s location become\naccessible to third parties. These third parties are not necessarily only those tracking the\nuser: the client-server interaction of some services ignores even the minimum security\nrequirements, allowing anyone to gain access to the accumulated data.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe situation of full-fledged stalkerware is somewhat different: there are no such apps on\nGoogle Play, but they are actively supported by developers. These tend to be commercial\nsolutions with extensive spying capabilities. They can harvest almost any data on a\ncompromised device: photos (both entire archives and individual pictures, for example, taken\nat a certain location), phone calls, texts, location information, screen taps (keylogging), and\nso on.\n\n_Screenshot from the site of a stalkerware app developer showing the capabilities of the software_\n\nMany apps exploit root privileges to extract messaging history from protected storage in\nsocial networking and instant messaging applications. If it cannot gain the required access,\nthe stalkerware can take screenshots, log screen taps and even extract the text of incoming\nand outgoing messages from the windows of popular services using the Accessibility feature.\nOne example is the commercial spyware app Monitor Minor.\n\n_Screenshot from the site of a stalkerware app developer showing the software’s ability to intercept_\n\n_data from social networks and messengers_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The developers of the commercial spyware FinSpy went one step further by adding a feature](https://securelist.com/new-finspy-ios-and-android-implants-revealed-itw/91685/)\nto intercept correspondence in secure messengers, such as Signal, Threema and others. To\nensure interception, the app independently obtains root privileges by exploiting the\nvulnerability CVE-2016-5195, aka “Dirty Cow”. The expectation is that the victim is using an\nold device with an outdated operating system kernel in which the exploit can escalate\nprivileges to root.\n\nIt is worth noting that the user base of messaging apps includes hundreds of millions. Classic\ncalls and texts are being used less and less, and communication — be it text messages or\nvoice/video calls — is gradually moving to instant messaging applications. Hence the rising\ninterest in data stored in such apps.\n\n### Attacks on personal data: advertising apps\n\n[In 2019, we observed a significant increase in the number of adware threats, one purpose](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/adware/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nbeing to harvest personal data on mobile devices.\n\nThe statistics show that the number of users attacked by adware in 2019 is roughly\nunchanged from 2018.\n\nNumber of users attacked by adware in 2018 and 2019\n\nAt the same time, the number of detected adware installation packages almost doubled from\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of detected adware installation packages in 2018 and 2019\n\nThese indicators typically correlate, but not in the case of adware. This can be explained by\nseveral factors:\n\nAdware installation packages are generated automatically and spread literally\neverywhere, but for some reason do not reach the target audience. It is possible that\nthey get detected immediately after being generated and cannot propagate further.\nOften, such apps contain nothing useful — just an adware module; so the victim\nimmediately deletes them, assuming that they allow removing themselves.\n\nNevertheless, it is the second successive year that adware has appeared in our Top 3\ndetected threats. KSN statistics confirm it to be one of the most common types of threats:\nfour places in our Top 10 mobile threats by number of users attacked in 2019 are reserved\nfor adware-class apps, with one member of the family, HiddenAd, taking the third.\n\nВердикт %*\n\n1 DangerousObject.Multi.Generic 35,83\n\n2 Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh 8,30\n\n3 AdWare.AndroidOS.HiddenAd.et 4,60\n\n4 AdWare.AndroidOS.Agent.f 4,05\n\n\n-----\n\n5 Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.ch 3,89\n\n6 DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML 3,85\n\n7 AdWare.AndroidOS.HiddenAd.fc 3,73\n\n8 Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.cr 2,49\n\n9 AdWare.AndroidOS.MobiDash.ap 2,42\n\n10 Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Necro.n 1,84\n\n_*Share of all users attacked by this type of malware in the total number of users attacked._\n\nIn 2019, mobile adware developers not only generated tens of thousands of packages, but\nalso technically enhanced their products, in particular through the addition of techniques to\nbypass operating system restrictions.\n\nFor example, Android imposes certain restrictions on background operation of applications\nfor battery-saving reasons. This negatively impacts the operation of various threats, including\nadware apps that like to lurk in the background and wait for, say, a new banner to arrive from\nC&C. The introduction of such restrictions made it impossible for apps to show ads outside\nthe context of their own window, thus starving most adware of oxygen.\n\nThe creators of the KeepMusic adware family found a smart workaround. To bypass the\nrestrictions, their software does not request permissions like, for example, malware does.\nInstead, the program starts looping an MP3 file that plays silence. The operating system\ndecides that the music player is running, and does not terminate the KeepMusic background\nprocess. As a result, the adware can request a banner from the server and display it any\ntime.\n\n### Attacks on personal data: exploiting access to Accessibility\n\nThe year 2019 saw the appearance of the first specimen of mobile financial malware (TrojanBanker.AndroidOS.Gustuff.a), featuring enhanced autonomy. Until then, two methods had\nbeen used to steal money from bank accounts:\n\n**Via SMS banking on the victim end. This is an autonomous theft technique that**\nrequires only information about the transfer recipient. This data the bot can either store\nin its body or receive as a command from C&C. The Trojan infects the device and\nsends a text with a transfer request to a special bank phone number. The bank then\nautomatically transfers the funds to the recipient from the device owner’s account. Due\nto the increase in such theft, limits on mobile transfers have been tightened, so this\nattack vector has been relegated to backup.\n\n\n-----\n\n**By stealing online banking credentials. This has been the dominant method in**\nrecent years. Cybercriminals display a phishing window on the victim’s device that\nmimics the bank’s login page and reels in the victim’s credentials. In this case, the\ncybercriminals need to carry out the transaction themselves, using the app on their own\nmobile device or a browser. It is possible that the bank’s anti-fraud systems can detect\nthe abnormal activity and block it, leaving the attackers empty-handed even if the\nvictim’s device is infected.\n\nIn 2019, cybercriminals mastered a third method: stealing by manipulating banking apps.\nFirst, the victim is persuaded to run the app and sign in, for example, using a fake push\nnotification supposedly from the bank. Tapping the notification does indeed open the banking\napp, which the attackers, using Accessibility, gain full control over, enabling them to fill out\nforms, tap buttons, etc. Moreover, the bot operator does not need to do anything, because\nthe malware performs all actions required. Such transactions are trusted by banks, and the\nmaximum transfer amount can exceed the limits of SMS banking by an order of magnitude.\nAs a result, the cybercriminals can clean out the account in one go.\n\nStealing funds from bank accounts is just one malicious use of Accessibility. In effect, any\nmalware with these permissions can control all on-screen processes, while any Android app\nis basically a visual representation of buttons, data entry forms, information display, and so\non. Even if developers implement their own control elements, such as a slider that needs to\nbe moved at a certain speed, this too can be done using Accessibility commands. Thus,\ncybercriminals have tremendous leeway to create what are perhaps the most dangerous\nclasses of mobile malware: spyware, banking Trojans and ransomware Trojans.\n\nThe misuse of the Accessibility features poses a serious threat to users’ personal data.\n[Where previously cybercriminals had to overlay phishing windows and request a bunch of](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/overlaying-overlay-attack/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\npermissions in order to steal personal information, now victims themselves output all\nnecessary data to the screen or enter it in forms, where it can be easily gleaned. And if the\nmalware needs more, it can open the Settings section by itself, tap a few buttons, and obtain\nthe necessary permissions.\n\n### Mobile Trojans on popular marketplaces: Google Play\n\nSlipping malware into the main Android app store delivers much better results than social\nengineering victims into installing apps from third-party sources. In addition, this approach\nenables attackers to:\n\nBypass SafetyNet, Android’s built-in antivirus protection. If a user downloads an app\nfrom Google Play, the likelihood that it will be installed without additional requests — for\nexample, to disable the built-in protection under an imaginary pretext — is very high.\nThe only thing that can protect the user from infection in that situation is a third-party\nsecurity solution.\n\n\n-----\n\nOvercome psychological barriers. Official app stores enjoy far greater trust than thirdparty “markets,” and act as store windows of sorts that can be used for distributing\nsoftware much more efficiently.\nTarget victims without unnecessary spending. Google Play can be used to host fakes\nthat visually mimic, say, popular banking apps. This was the distribution vector used in\n[a spate of attacks on mobile users in Brazil: we detected numerous malicious programs](https://securelist.com/it-threat-evolution-q1-2019-statistics/90916/)\non Google Play under the guise of mobile apps for Brazilian banks.\n\nIn addition to malicious doppelgangers, cybercriminals deployed several other tricks to\nmaximize device infection rates:\n\nThe [case of CamScanner showed that an app’s legitimate behavior can be](https://securelist.com/dropper-in-google-play/92496/)\nsupplemented with malicious functions by updating its code for handling advertising.\nThis could be described as the most sophisticated attack vector, since its success\ndepends on a large number of factors, including the user base of the host app, the\ndeveloper’s trust in third-party advertising code and the type of malicious activity.\n[Another example demonstrates that attackers sometimes upload to Google Play fairly](https://securelist.com/mobile-subscriptions/91211/)\nwell-behaved apps from popular user categories. In this case, it was photo editors.\nThe most depressing case involves a Trojan from the Joker family, of which we have\nfound many samples on Google Play, and still are. Deploying the tactic of mass\nposting, cybercriminals uploaded apps under all kinds of guises: from wallpaperchanging tools and security solutions to popular games. In some cases, the Trojan\nscored hundreds of thousands of downloads. No other attack vector can reach this kind\nof audience within such a short space of time.\n\n[The good news is that Google and the antivirus industry have teamed up to fight threats on](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/11/the-app-defense-alliance-bringing.html)\nthe site. This approach should prevent most malware from penetrating the official Google\napp store.\n\n## Statistics\n\nIn 2019, we discovered 3,503,952 mobile malicious installation packages, which is 1,817,190\nless than in the previous year. We have not detected so few mobile threats since 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of mobile malicious installation packages for Android in 2015–2019\n\nFor three consecutive years, we have seen an overall decline in the number of mobile\nthreats distributed as installation packages. The picture largely depends on specific\ncybercriminal campaigns: some have become less active, others have completely ceased,\nand new players have yet to gain momentum.\n\nThe situation is similar with the number of attacks using mobile threats: whereas in 2018 we\nobserved a total of 116.5 million attacks, in 2019 the figure was down to 80 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of attacks defeated by Kaspersky mobile solutions in 2018–2019\n\nThe figures were back to the year before, before the start of the Asacub banking Trojan\nepidemic.\n\nSince the number of attacks correlates with the number of users attacked, we observed a\nsimilar picture for this indicator.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of users attacked by mobile malware in 2018–2019\n\n\n-----\n\nGeography of attacked users in 2019\n\n**Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by mobile malware:**\n\nCountry* %**\n\nIran 60.64\n\nPakistan 44.43\n\nBangladesh 43.17\n\nAlgeria 40.20\n\nIndia 37.98\n\nIndonesia 35.12\n\nNigeria 33.16\n\nTanzania 28.51\n\nSaudi Arabia 27.94\n\n\n-----\n\nMalaysia 27.36\n\n_*Excluded from the rankings are countries with fewer than 25,000 active users of Kaspersky mobile security solutions in thereporting period.**Unique users attacked in the country as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile security solutions in the country._\n\nIn 2019, Iran (60.64%) again topped the list for the third year in a row. The most common\nthreats in that country come from adware and potentially unwanted software:\nTrojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.bn, AdWare.AndroidOS.Agent.fa, and\nRiskTool.AndroidOS.Dnotua.yfe.\n\nPakistan (44.43%) climbed from seventh to second place, mainly on the back of a rise in the\nnumber of users attacked by adware. The largest contribution was made by members of the\nAdWare.AndroidOS.HiddenAd family. A similar picture can be seen in Bangladesh (43.17%),\nwhose share has grown due to the same adware families.\n\n### Types of mobile threats\n\n\n-----\n\nDistribution of new mobile threats by type in 2018 and 2019\n\nIn 2019, the share of RiskTool-class threats decreased by 20 p.p. (32.46%). We believe the\nmain reason to be the sharp drop in the generation of threats from the SMSreg family. A\ncharacteristic feature of this family is payments via SMS: for example, money transfers or\nsubscriptions to mobile services. Moreover, the user is not explicitly informed of the payment\nor money being charged to their mobile account. Whereas in 2018, we picked up 1,970,742\nSMSreg installation packages, the number decreased by an order of magnitude to 193,043\nin 2019. At the same time, far from declining, the number of packages of other members of\nthis class of threats increased noticeably.\n\n\n-----\n\nName of family %*\n\n1 Agent 27.48\n\n2 SMSreg 16.89\n\n3 Dnotua 13.83\n\n4 Wapron 13.73\n\n5 SmsSend 9.15\n\n6 Resharer 4.62\n\n7 SmsPay 3.55\n\n8 PornVideo 2.51\n\n9 Robtes 1.23\n\n10 Yoga 1.03\n\n_*Share of packages of this family in the total number of riskware-class packages detected in 2019._\n\nSkymobi and Paccy dropped out of the Top 10 families of potentially unwanted software; the\nnumber of installation packages of these families detected in 2019 decreased tenfold. Their\ncreators likely minimized or even ceased their development and distribution. However, a new\nplayer appeared: the Resharer family (4.62%), which ranked sixth. This family is noted for its\nself-propagation through posting information about itself on various sites and mailing it to the\nvictim’s contacts.\n\nAdware demonstrated the most impressive growth, up by 14 p.p. The main source of this\ngrowth was HiddenAd (26.81%); the number of installation packages of this family increased\nby two orders of magnitude against 2018.\n\nName of family %*\n\n1 HiddenAd 26.81\n\n2 MobiDash 20.45\n\n3 Ewind 16.34\n\n4 Agent 15.27\n\n5 Dnotua 5.51\n\n6 Kuguo 1.36\n\n7 Dowgin 1.28\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Triada 1.20\n\n9 Feiad 1.01\n\n10 Frupi 0.94\n\n_*Share of packages of this family in the total number of adware-class packages detected in 2019._\n\nSignificant growth also came from the MobiDash (20.45%) and Ewind (16.34%) families.\nMeanwhile, the Agent family (15.27%), which held a leading position in 2018, dropped to\nfourth place.\n\nCompared to 2018, the number of mobile Trojans detected decreased sharply. A downward\ntrend has been observed for two consecutive years now, yet droppers remain one of the\n[most numerous malware classes. The Hqwar family showed the most notable decrease:](https://securelist.com/hqwar-the-higher-it-flies-the-harder-it-drops/93689/)\ndown from 141,000 packages in 2018 to 22,000 in 2019. At the same time, 2019 saw the\ndebut of the Ingopack family: we detected 115,654 samples of this dropper.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of Trojan-class threats rose by 6 p.p., with the two most numerous\nmalware families of this class being Boogr and Hiddapp. The Boogr family contains various\nTrojans that have been detected using machine-learning (ML) technology. A feature of the\nHiddapp family is that it hides its icon in the list of installed apps while continuing to run in the\nbackground.\n\nThe share of mobile ransomware Trojans slightly increased. The Top 3 families of this class\nof threats remained the same as in 2018: Svpeng, Congur, and Fusob — in that order.\n\n### Top 20 mobile malware programs\n\nThe following malware rankings omit potentially unwanted software, such as RiskTool and\nAdWare.\n\nVerdict %*\n\n1 DangerousObject.Multi.Generic 49.15\n\n2 Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh 10.95\n\n3 Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.ch 5.19\n\n4 DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML 5.08\n\n5 Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Necro.n 3.45\n\n6 Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.cr 3.28\n\n7 Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub.snt 2.35\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Hqwar.bb 2.10\n\n9 Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Lezok.p 1.76\n\n10 Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub.a 1.66\n\n11 Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a 1.65\n\n12 Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng.ak 1.60\n\n13 Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro.b 1.59\n\n14 Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Hqwar.gen 1.50\n\n15 Exploit.AndroidOS.Lotoor.be 1.46\n\n16 Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.cf 1.35\n\n17 Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a 1.33\n\n18 Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.ep 1.31\n\n19 Trojan.AndroidOS.Agent.rt 1.28\n\n20 Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Tiny.d 1.14\n\n_*Share of users attacked by this type of malware out of all attacked users_\n\nAs we wrap up the year 2019, first place in our Top 20 mobile malware, as in previous years,\ngoes to the verdict DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (49.15%), which we use for malware\ndetected with cloud technology. The verdict is applied where the antivirus databases still\nhave no signatures or heuristics for malware detection. This way, the most recent malware is\nuncovered.\n\nIn second place came the verdict Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh (10.95%). This verdict is\nassigned to files recognized as malicious by our ML-based system. Another result of this\nsystem’s work is objects with the verdict DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML (5.08%,\nfourth place in the rating). This verdict is assigned to files whose structure is identical to that\nof malicious files.\n\nThird, sixth, and sixteenth places were taken by members of the Hiddapp family. We assign\nthis verdict to any app that hides its icon in the list of apps immediately after starting.\nSubsequent actions of such apps may be anything from downloading or dropping other apps\nto displaying ads.\n\nFifth and thirteenth places went to members of the Necro family of droppers and loaders. In\nboth threat classes, Necro members did not make it into the Top 10 by number of detected\nfiles. Even the weakened Hwar family of droppers strongly outperformed Necro by number of\n\n\n-----\n\ngenerated objects. That said, users often encountered Necro members due to the family s\npenetration of Google Play.\n\nSeventh and tenth places went to the Asacub family of banking Trojans. Whereas at the start\nof the year, the Trojan’s operators were still actively spreading the malware, starting in March\n2019, we noticed a drop in this family’s activity.\n\nNumber of unique users attacked by the Asacub mobile banking Trojan in 2019\n\nEighth and fourteenth places were reserved for droppers in the Hqwar family. Their activity\ndropped significantly from 80,000 attacked users in 2018 to 28,000 in 2019. However, we\ncontinue to register infection attempts by this family, and do not rule out its return to the top.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of unique users attacked by the Hqwar mobile dropper in 2019\n\nIn ninth position is another dropper, this time from the Lezok family: TrojanDropper.AndroidOS.Lezok.p (1.76%). A notable difference between this Trojan and Hqwar is\nthat the malware penetrates the device before it arrives at the store. This is evidenced by\nKSN statistics showing that the Trojan was most often detected in the system directory under\nthe names PhoneServer, GeocodeService, and similar.\n\nPath to the detected threat Number of unique users attacked\n\n1 /system/priv-app/PhoneServer/ 49,688\n\n2 /system/priv-app/GeocodeService/ 9747\n\n3 /system/priv-app/Helper/ 6784\n\n4 /system/priv-app/com.android.telephone/ 5030\n\n5 /system/priv-app/ 1396\n\n6 /system/priv-app/CallerIdSearch/ 1343\n\nWhen the device is turned on, Lezok dumps its payload into the system; it does so even if\nthe victim deletes the dumped files using regular OS tools or resets the device to the factory\nsettings. The trick is that the Trojan forms part of the factory firmware and can reload\n(restore) the deleted files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final Trojan worthy of attention is Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a (1.56%), which\nfinished eleventh in the rankings. Despite claims to the contrary, it can be removed. However,\nthe infected system contains another Trojan that installs a helper app, which cannot be\nremoved that easily. According to KSN statistics, members of the TrojanDownloader.AndroidOS.Triada and Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap families can act as delivery\nvehicles for the helper. After the victim removes the helper, a member of one of these two\nfamilies loads and reinstalls it.\n\n### Mobile banking Trojans\n\nIn 2019, we detected 69,777 installation packages for mobile banking Trojans, which is half\nlast year’s figure. However, the share of banking Trojans out of all detected threats grew\nslightly as a consequence of the declining activity of other classes and families of mobile\nmalware.\n\nNumber of installation packages of mobile banking Trojans detected by Kaspersky in 2019\n\nThe number of detected installation packages for banking Trojans as well as the number of\nattacks were influenced by the campaign to distribute the Asacub Trojan, whose activity has\nplummeted starting in April 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of attacks by mobile banking Trojans in 2018–2019\n\nIt is worth noting that the average number of attacks over the year was approximately\n270,000 per month.\n\n**Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by banking Trojans**\n\nCountry %*\n\n1 Russia 0.72\n\n2 South Africa 0.66\n\n3 Australia 0.59\n\n4 Spain 0.29\n\n5 Tajikistan 0.21\n\n6 Turkey 0.20\n\n7 USA 0.18\n\n8 Italy 0.17\n\n9 Ukraine 0.17\n\n10 Armenia 0.16\n_*S_ _f_ _f_\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia (0.72%) has headed our Top 10 for three consecutive years: many different Trojan\nfamilies are focused on stealing credentials from Russian banking apps.

Thus, Asacub is the number one threat in Tajikistan,\nUkraine, and Armenia, while the Svpeng family of Trojans is active in Russia and the US.\n\nIn South Africa (0.66%), the most common Trojan was Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.dx,\naccounting for 95% of all users attacked by banking threats.\n\nThe most widespread Trojan in Australia (0.59%) was Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.eq\n(77% of all users attacked by banking threats).\n\nIn Spain (0.29%), banking malware from the Cebruser and TrojanBanker.AndroidOS.Agent.ep families are popular with cybercriminals (49% and 22% of all\nusers attacked by banking threats, respectively).\n\n**Top 10 families of mobile bankers in 2019**\n\nFamily %*\n\n1 Asacub 44.40\n\n2 Svpeng 22.40\n\n3 Agent 19.06\n\n4 Faketoken 12.02\n\n5 Hqwar 3.75\n\n6 Anubis 2.72\n\n7 Marcher 2.07\n\n8 Rotexy 1.46\n\n9 Gugi 1.34\n\n10 Regon 1.01\n\n_*Share of users attacked by this family of mobile bankers out of all users attacked by mobile banking Trojans_\n\n### Mobile ransomware Trojans\n\nIn 2019, we detected 68,362 installation packages for ransomware Trojans, which is 8,186\nmore than in the previous year. However, we observed a decline in the generation of new\nransomware packages throughout 2019. The minimum was recorded in December.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of new installation packages for mobile banking Trojans in Q1–Q4 2019\n\nA similar picture is seen for attacked users. Whereas in early 2019, the number of attacked\nusers peaked at 12,004, by the end of the year, the figure had decreased 2.6 times.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of users attacked by mobile ransomware Trojans in 2018–2019\n\n\n-----\n\nCountries by share of users attacked by mobile ransomware in 2019\n\n**Top 10 countries by share of users attacked by ransomware Trojans**\n\nCountry* %**\n\n1 USA 2.03\n\n2 Kazakhstan 0.56\n\n3 Iran 0.37\n\n4 Mexico 0.11\n\n5 Saudi Arabia 0.10\n\n6 Pakistan 0.10\n\n7 Canada 0.10\n\n8 Italy 0.09\n\n9 Indonesia 0.08\n\n\n-----\n\n10 Australia 0.06\n\n_*Excluded from the rating are countries with fewer than 25,000 active users of Kaspersky mobile solutions in the reportingperiod.**Unique users attacked by mobile ransomware in the country as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile solutions inthe country._\n\nFor the third year in a row, first place by share of users attacked by mobile ransomware went\nto the US (2.03%). Same as last year, the Svpeng ransomware family was the most\ncommonly encountered in the country. It was also the most widespread in Iran (0.37%).\n\nThe situation in Kazakhstan (0.56%) was unchanged: the country still ranks second, and the\nmost prevalent threat there remains the Rkor family.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe year 2019 saw the appearance of several highly sophisticated mobile banking threats, in\nparticular, malware that can interfere with the normal operation of banking apps. The danger\nthey pose cannot be overstated, because they cause direct losses to the victim. It is highly\nlikely that this trend will continue into 2020, and we will see more such high-tech banking\nTrojans.\n\nAlso in 2019, attacks involving the use of mobile stalkerware became more frequent, the\npurpose being to monitor and collect information about the victim. In terms of sophistication,\nstalkerware is keeping pace with its malware cousins. It is quite likely that 2020 will see an\nincrease in the number of such threats, with a corresponding rise in the number of attacked\nusers.\n\nJudging by our statistics, adware is gaining ever more popularity among cybercriminals. In all\nlikelihood, going forward we will encounter new members of this class of threats, with the\nworst-case scenario involving adware modules pre-installed on victims’ devices.\n\n[Adware](https://securelist.com/tag/adware/)\n[Data theft](https://securelist.com/tag/data-theft/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Mobile Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/mobile-malware/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Stalkerware](https://securelist.com/tag/stalkerware/)\n[Trojan Banker](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-banker/)\n[Trojan-stealer](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-stealer/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Victor Chebyshev](https://securelist.com/author/victorchebyshev/)\n\nMobile malware evolution 2019\n\nYour email address will not be published.
