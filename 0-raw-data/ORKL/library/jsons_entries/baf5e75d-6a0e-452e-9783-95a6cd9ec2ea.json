Sodinokibi!\n\n**[dissectingmalwa.re/germanwipers-big-brother-gandgrabs-kid-sodinokibi.html](https://dissectingmalwa.re/germanwipers-big-brother-gandgrabs-kid-sodinokibi.html)**\n\nSat 10 August 2019 in [Ransomware](https://dissectingmalwa.re/category/ransomware.html)\n\nAfter last week's analysis on GermanWiper I thought it would be about time to have a Look at\nSodinokibi aka REvil, the new weird kid on the block.\n\nAccording to [Cybereason the Sodinokibi Ransomware was written by the same guys who](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/the-sodinokibi-ransomware-attack)\ncreated GandCrab, which is a pretty big deal after GandCrab retired recently. The samples\nthat I'll be looking at today were first dropped in Asia, but it did not take long to reach other\ncontinents as well.\n\n**_A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below_**\n**_will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check_**\n**_with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending_**\n**_on where you live._**\n\n### Where I dug up the samples this time:\n\nSodinokibi #1 available @ https://malshare.com/sample.php?\naction=detail&hash=6cb6fda0b353d411a30c5b945e53ea52 `sha256`\n```\nbace25c1ec587d099b4c566b1a07978dd9cb3bd67c2acaa55d2e4644a7877070\n\n```\nSodinokibi #2 available @ https://malshare.com/sample.php?\naction=detail&hash=7354af1a63f222ede4c9e0a6f84d57c2 `sha256`\n```\n2fea45f7be7c7313ee6e4fe7ad9ef64d9966a2391003a00dcbbd6214e9c522ef\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nRunning it through VirusTotal we get a pretty good detection rate, but that is to be expected\n[since REvil is around for a few days already. Here's a direct Link to the VT Analysis.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bace25c1ec587d099b4c566b1a07978dd9cb3bd67c2acaa55d2e4644a7877070/detection)\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at Detect it easy we don t see anything special either. The PE seems to be built with\nMS Visual Studio 2015 (Linker Version 14).\n\nEntropy-wise we can observe a huge drop near the end of the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe imports definitely indicate that somethings is wrong here. Only loading kernel32.dll with\n3 entries is a bit minimalistic for ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor one to get his/her Hands on the actual PE with an intact/complete IAT there are a couple\nof possible ways. Sergei Frankoff explained a very fast, but slightly \"messy\" Method on\nOALive. I'll try to replay this technique and plan to come back to this sample soon to try and\nscript my way out of this hole.\n\n[A dump of the strings in the binary file can be found here. Likewise a sample of the](https://dissectingmalwa.re/other/sodi-strings.txt)\n[ransomnote dropped as a textfile by the malware is available here.](https://dissectingmalwa.re/other/sodi-note.txt)\n\n## The Decryptor\n\n\n-----\n\nThanks to a businessman who shall remain nameless but decided to pay the ransom we can\ntake a look at the Decryptor V1.3 as well. My feeling about this executable is, that it is being\nbuilt to order rather than prepared in case a decryption is requested. The tool feels relatively\nunpolished because of the active debugging, no obfuscation or anti-evasion.\n\nRunning it through Detect it Easy there is nothing spectacular going on here. Consistent with\nthe ransomware itself the decryptor was built with Visual Studio 2015 as well. Entropy-wise\nthere are no surprises either at 4.64889.\n\n\n-----\n\nOL4/y7znO6S6W7qPdbyz7S1iWvOlwRAz6y4Y0qL0+1g= 31869wv07x\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Sodinokibi / REvil Ransomware (SHA256)\n```\nbace25c1ec587d099b4c566b1a07978dd9cb3bd67c2acaa55d2e4644a7877070\n2fea45f7be7c7313ee6e4fe7ad9ef64d9966a2391003a00dcbbd6214e9c522ef\nada9794bcc8e87af05f9982522e26f7ead3d1cb07bb76ce58fac1bf98e41cf53\n\n URLs\nhttx://decryptor[.]top\nhttx://aplebzu47wgazapdqks6vrcv6zcnjppkbxbr6wketf56nf6aq2nmyoyd.onion\n\n```\n\n-----",
