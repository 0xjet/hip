Through technical\nindicators, we connect the attack to several destructive events going back to at least 2009.\n\nThe identity of the perpetrators is unknown, but several of these previous events have been attributed by others to\nNorth Korean threat actors. In this report, we show how we have connected these events to the threat actors\nknown as DarkSeoul or Silent Chollima.\n\nWhoever they are, this group is still active, mainly going after South Korean targets in several sectors. Malware\nbelonging to this threat complex has apparently been produced as late as January 2016.\n\nWe detail the evolution of some of the most common tools used by these attackers and present indicators of\ncompromise and mitigation information where we can.\n\nIn parallel with this report, the security company Novetta is publishing its own independent research covering the\n[same threat complex. This report is available from http://operationblockbuster.com.](http://operationblockbuster.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### INTRODUCTION\n\n\nMuch has been written about the Sony hack. However, hard data has not been as plentiful. In an attempt to\nprovide additional insight, we detail some facts about the malware reportedly used in the attack, and attempt to\ndraw lines to other malware and incidents, beyond the mere speculative.\n\nIn order to expand the case, we will look at a variety of evidence. In most cases, we will not settle for one single\nfactor as the basis for assessments, but instead correlate information of different kinds. Factors that we will include\nare for example:\n\n  - Obfuscation methods\n\n  - Code structure\n\n  - Text strings, such as encryption keys\n\n  - Known localization\n\n  - Digital code signing certificates\n\n**Details about the different indicators are included in the appendixes.**\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nA big thank you goes out to all who helped with this paper – notably Waylon Grange, always an invaluable source of\ninsight and information, and the good folks over at Farsight Security who gracefully provided passive DNS data.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### MALWARE KNOWN TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE SONY CASE\n\n\nTo start at the beginning: The official statements from the FBI (1) and US-CERT (2) mention the md5 hashes of the\nfollowing set of malware files:\n\nd1c27ee7ce18675974edf42d4eea25c6   (dropper)\n760c35a80d758f032d02cf4db12d3e55   (wiper)\ne1864a55d5ccb76af4bf7a0ae16279ba   (web server)\ne904bf93403c0fb08b9683a9e858c73e   (backdoor)\n\nIn the weeks following the attack, a number of other malware instances came to light that were obviously\nconnected; such as\n\n2618dd3e5c59ca851f03df12c0cab3b8   (SMB worm)\nb80aa583591eaf758fd95ab4ea7afe39   (wiper)\n6467c6df4ba4526c7f7a7bc950bd47eb   (backdoor)\n\nMost vendors now use the name Destover for a group of malware that was part of the Sony intrusion. Though\nmany pieces of malware are somewhat different, we’ll use that name as well to avoid confusion.\n\nThe US-CERT advisory also mentions the import hashes of a number of other malware. These are non-unique\nindicators, but can help in locating related samples.\n\n\n##### A NOTE ABOUT THE HANGUL WORD PROCESSOR (*.HWP, HWPX) FORMAT\n\n\nThe Hangul Word Processor is software developed by the Korean company Hancom. It is similar in usage area to\nMicrosoft Word, but is specifically adapted to the Korean written language Hangul.\n\nThe file format used by this software is also somewhat similar to Microsoft Word, with the use of OLE2-based\ndocuments for previous versions of HWP, and ZIP archive-based documents for newer versions.\n\nA number of vulnerabilities have existed for these formats. These have been used maliciously by several different\nthreat actors over time, also by the threat actors mentioned in this paper.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### MALWARE ARCHEOLOGY \n\n\nAs research into this case progressed, it became obvious that we were tracing malware relationships back in time.\nIn fact, the earliest indicators we’ve found go all the way back to at least 2009.\n\nAround this time a malware development project started that would become the backbone of intrusions and\ndestructive attacks against mainly South Korean targets for years to come. In fact, modern-day malware from the\nsame threat actor still contains traces of this first eo-malware. The initial starting points were likely publicly\navailable source codes for Rbot and Mydoom, found on Chinese code sharing sites like Programmers United\nDevelop Net (PUDN).\n\nThere is no universally adopted naming for the early generations of this family in the AV industry. Usually they are\ndetected as Dllbot or Npkon, but these names can also cover other families, thus our use of a different name in this\npaper - KorDllbot.\n\nWe will cover the evolution of KorDllbots and related malware, and how these came to be involved in various\nintrusion cases.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### TIMELINE OF LIKELY DARKSEOUL-RELATED ATTACKS\n\n\n_A timeline of destructive intrusions in or related to the Korean peninsula._\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE KORDLLBOT BACKDOOR FAMILY\n\n\nKorDllbot is a family of small/medium size trojans that usually are configured to be installed as services.\n\nSamples can vary a great deal in functionality - from just listening on a port and accepting commands, to harvesting\ndata, to actively spreading over SMB. This functionality seems almost modular, using different encryption and\nencoding methods and different C&C command words. Build environment for the early generations was typically\nVisual Studio 6.\n\n_KorDllbots use C&C commands starting at different integer offsets depending on version. Here, versions 1.1/1.2/1.5,_\n_1.03, 1.04.2 and 1.05.2 sending success or error status back to remote control client after file deletion._\n\nCommon capability seen in the KorDllbot family is:\n\n- Get bot status\n\n- List logical drives\n\n- List directory\n\n- Change directory\n\n- Get process list\n\n- Kill process\n\n- Execute file\n\n- Delete file\n\n- Change file time\n\n- Execute shell command\n\n- Download file\n\n- Upload file\n\n- Get volume serial number\n\n- Get file attributes\n\nMost of these trojans use encrypted or encoded C&C communication, but the algorithms vary between versions.\n\n\n-----\n\nA very common trait in these bots is for API’s to be dynamically declared through the use of LoadLibrary and\nGetProcAddress, where the API names are obfuscated, encoded or encrypted in some way, and decoded before\nthey are declared. This is not unique to KorDllbots, but is a fairly static common behavior for this family.\n\nAnother trait which is peculiar enough to be an identifier in itself is the way this malware creates command line\nstatements. The construction of the command line is deliberately obfuscated by concatenating string segments.\nTypically, this looks something like this:\n\n\n#### sprintf(commandline, “%sd.e%sc %s >%s 2>&1”, “cm”, “xe /”, command, logfile_name);  //command and tempfile_name are arbitrary strings inserted by the malware.\n\n\nThis translates to “cmd.exe /c command>logfile_name 2>&1”, i.e execute command and direct output to a log file.\nThis particular construct, with very little deviation, is used in almost all KorDllbots and its successors. We’ll\nreference this by the name “CMXE” string obfuscation later on in the paper.\n\nThe earliest KorDllbot we have has a compile timestamp of July 1st. 2007. This date is however possible to falsify.\nThe earliest verified time KorDllbots were observed was mid-2011, with the executable with the sha256 hash of\n87bae4517ff40d9a8800ba4d2fa8d2f9df3c2e224e97c4b3c162688f2b0d832e. This sample listens for connections on\nport 179 and allows remote access through an encoded proprietary protocol.\n\n**Already here we can note a connection to the Sony case. Current antivirus detection of this file includes the**\n**names Destover and Escad, names introduced by AV vendors in connection with the Sony attack. It has a compile**\n**date (May 17th 2011) and import hash that matches data from the US-CERT advisory (2).**\n\nThis malware contains a very noticeable API string obfuscation algorithm where API strings have been broken up\ninto segments of varying size using either spaces or dots as filler. This is presumably done to avoid detection by\nanti-malware solutions or YARA rules. We have called this technique Chopstring, just to have a reference later on.\nChopString is used by many KorDllbots, and also shows up elsewhere in the Sony intrusion case.\n\n_Chopstring’ed strings inside malware._\n\nAs far as we know, this exact method is not in widespread use in the underground or shared between threat actors.\nThese APIs are reconstructed before use by calling special string-deobfuscation functions early in the execution of\nthe program. For details about this and other algorithms, see the Appendix.\n\nHowever, there is another interesting trait of this particular sample, and that is its digital signature.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE MicrosoftCodeSigningPCA CERTIFICATE CLUSTER\n\n\nThe KorDllbot sample 87bae4517ff40d9a8800ba4d2fa8d2f9df3c2e224e97c4b3c162688f2b0d832e is digitally\nsigned using a non-original (and thus non-validating) Microsoft certificate. The file is in reality self-signed.\n\nThis signature doesn’t say much about who made it. However, the way the certificate is constructed is peculiar.\nThe faked issuer in this case is Microsoft Code Signing PCA. The real Microsoft Code Signing PCA is one of the\ncertificate authorities used by Microsoft to sign their software.\n\nThe Subject - i.e. the entity the certificate is supposed to have been issued to - is also Microsoft Code Signing PCA.\nThis is a construct never seen in legitimate certifications, and it is rare enough in faked certificates that it’s\nworthwhile checking other malware signed in this way.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlue Coat maintains a database of code signing certificates which we can mine for this type of information.\n\nWe found several certificate serial numbers matching this pattern. Each serial number identifies a certificate used\nto sign a small number of malware samples – typically on the range of one to four samples, with one outlier at eight\nsamples.\n\nThe malware can be clustered into a few main buckets. Some malwares of different families are signed by the same\ncertificate, which creates a high-confidence link between them.\n\nThis collection of signed malware is dominated by KorDllbots. These are not all identical, there is considerable\nvariation between generations in functionality, encoding and encryption methods, but the similarities in overall\nstructure; string usage etc. is quite unmistakable. (See appendix for a full list of executables with this type of\nsignature.)\n\nOther samples include keyloggers, SMB worms, Yahoo Messenger-communicating backdoor trojans and the\nlegitimate ProxyMini lightweight proxy server.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### KORDLLBOT-RELATED SMB WORMS\n\n\nThe malware samples 163571bd56001963c4dcb0650bb17fa23ba23a5237c21f2401f4e894dfe4f50d and\n**e0cd4eb8108dab716f3c2e94e6c0079051bfe9c7c2ed4fcbfdd16b4dd1c18d4d in the cluster of signed malware do**\nnot look like KorDllbots at first glance.\n\nThe usual service DLL dropper is here replaced with a worm component. After installation and reboot, this worm\ngenerates random IP addresses and attempts to connect to the admin$ share on remote machines using the hard\ncoded usernames “administrator” and “db2admin”. The malware contains a list of common passwords and it will\nalso construct passwords based on the username. If successful, the worm copies itself to the remote machine’s\nsystem directory and installs it as a service there.\n\nIn addition to spreading, these samples drop a backdoor component which is somewhat different in structure to\nthe “standard” KorDllbots. The dropper code logic used in these worms is however used in other KorDllbot dropper\nsamples and is unmistakable - the strings “DGTSIGN” and “www.goog1e.cn” are markers which the malware uses\nto locate its embedded content.\n\n9bc8fe605a4ad852894801271efd771da688d707b\n9fbe208106917a0796bbfdc\n\nThis is a KorDllbot dropper\n\ne0cd4eb8108dab716f3c2e94e6c0079051bfe9c7c\n2ed4fcbfdd16b4dd1c18d4d\n\nThis is an SMB worm\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE JOANAP/BRAMBUL WORM FAMILY\n\n\nSpeaking of SMB worms, a group of malware signed using the MicrosoftCodeSigningPCA pattern were a series of\nSMB worms that had not appeared on our radar before. The variant we found first was named “Joanap” by several\nantivirus vendors; presumably because of name appearing in the TO: field of callback emails from the malware –\n“Joana.”\n\nThe malware comes as a dropper which installs three sub-components – one SMB spreading DLL (wmmvsvc.dll),\none backdoor DLL (scardprv.dll) and one configuration file (mssscardprv.ax).\n\nThe spreader component generates random IP addresses and attempts to copy the dropper and the config file to\nthese over SMB. If successful, the worm sends an email back to its creator via Google’s SMTP server. The backdoor\ncomponent is essentially a KorDllbot. Not only is there code overlap with this family, but it also creates its API\ndecryption AES key based on the same string (“Bb102@jH4$t3hg%6&G1s*2J3gCNwVr*UeI!Dr3hytg^CHGf%ion”)\nas previously mentioned KorDllbots, eg. sha256\na795964bc2be442f142f5aea9886ddfd297ec898815541be37f18ffeae02d32f.\n\nRecently, Symantec published information (3) that links these worms to the Duuzer malware family. As we shall see\nlater on, this is just another connection to our threat actors.\n\nWe were able to locate several variants of Joanap-like malware using different email addresses and containing\ndifferent functionality. The earliest of these were apparently compiled as early as January 2009, with verified\noccurrences of a newer variant late same year. See appendix for more details.\n\nThe latest versions of Joanap we found appear to be the type of SMB worm observed in connection with the Sony\nattack, something also PriceWaterhouseCoopers has mentioned in a blog post (4).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE DOZER (AKA 7.7 DDOS) ATTACK\n\n\nThe Dozer attack in July 2009 was one of the first attacks on South Korean targets that received international\nattention. DDOS bots were distributed with lists of sites to attack – notably various Korean websites covering\ngovernment and bank functions, but also a great deal of US .gov, .mil and .com sites – including whitehouse.gov.\nThis also involved wiping of hard disks of the infected computers.\n\nThere is a known set of malware (7) connected with this incident.\n\nSome of these samples appear to have been written specifically for the Dozer attack. However, the sample with the\nsha256 hash 7dee2bd4e317d12c9a2923d0531526822cfd37eabfd7aecc74258bb4f2d3a643 shares code with\nKorDllbots, as can be seen in the function below, which does network receipt with xor decoding.\n\n_KorDllbot (0075d16d8c86f132618c6365369ff1755525180f919eb5c103e7578be30391d6) vs Dozer_\n_(7dee2bd4e317d12c9a2923d0531526822cfd37eabfd7aecc74258bb4f2d3a643)._\n_The function is identical. This is just one out of several such functions in the sample._\n\nWe can say with reasonable confidence that the threat actors behind the Dozer attack also were involved in the\ncreation of the KorDllbot family or have had access to the source code.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE KOREDOS (AKA 3.4 DDOS) ATTACK\n\n\nOver a few days in the beginning of March 2011, different South Korean organizations were targets of a DDOS\nattack. The malware launching this attack also contained very destructive components that wiped and deleted files\nof certain extensions after some time, as well as overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) of all physical hard\ndrives. Good write-ups of this incident have been published by McAfee (8) and several others.\n\nSome known Koredos malware samples (eg. sha256\n48dee93aa3ea847da119f5104e8f96070b03f1d52c46f39dc345f0102bf38836) use the same RC4 file decryption key “A39405WKELsdfirpsdLDPskDORkbLRTP12330@3$223%!” - as malware in the MicrosoftCodeSigningPCA signed\nKorDllbot cluster mentioned previously (eg. sha256\na795964bc2be442f142f5aea9886ddfd297ec898815541be37f18ffeae02d32f). The RC4 implementation used is\nidentical. The very same KorDllbot also contains an AES key –\n**“Bb102@jH4$t3hg%6&G1s*2J3gCNwVr*UeI!Dr3hytg^CHGf%ion” which is used by several Joanap malware**\nsamples.\n\nWe can say with reasonable confidence that the threat actors behind the Koredos attack, like in the Dozer attack,\nhave been involved in the creation of the KorDllbot family.\n\nSymantec reported another malware to be involved along with the Koredos malware - the stealthy backdoor\nPrioxer (9). Prioxer made a return in connection with the DarkSeoul (often known as Jokra) attacks in 2013. This\nrelationship has been covered by in studies by both Symantec (10) and McAfee (5).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE JOONGANG ILBO ATTACK\n\n\nIn 2012, the conservative daily newspaper Joongang llbo was subject to a disk wiping attack (11).\n\nNot much technical data is in the public domain about this incident. However, a Korean researcher links this attack\nto the Sony attack, based on code similarities (12). We have no reason to doubt this assessment.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE DARKSEOUL (AKA 3.20 OR JOKRA) ATTACK\n\n\nDarkSeoul was a debilitating and destructive attack in March 2013 that affected several Korean banks and news\norganizations. It may be the most well-known of all the Korean “wiper” attacks. The incident has been extensively\nresearched by several vendors; notably the mentioned Operation Troy paper (5) by McAfee covered a good deal of\nthe malware involved.\n\nThe main malware family connected with that attack – an IRC controlled bot – was a programming project that had\nbeen ongoing for years before being employed in the DarkSeoul attack. The earliest sample we have of this family\n(known as XwDoor or Keydoor) was apparently compiled in January 2009. This family is quite easy to spot, as there\nare a number of strings that appear consistently re-used. The intrusion also involved a backdoor family named\nPrioxer. There was no obvious connection to the KorDllbot/Destover complex until Symantec tied the Prioxer\nmalware back to the 2011 Koredos incident (10).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE KORHIGH MALWARE\n\n\nThe Korhigh malware was identified around June 25 2013 in connection with investigations into other attacks on\nSouth Korean targets (13). This date coincided with the 63[rd] anniversary for the start of the Korean War. It had a\ndestructive component, capable of deleting files and overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) of hard drives.\n\nThe malware was apparently created by a group calling itself “High Anonymous.” The following image was\ncontained as a resource in one of the executables:\n\nThere are strong similarities between the Sony malware and the malware used in the Korhigh campaign. These\nsimilarities have been reported by Korean researchers (13), but have gone largely unnoticed in the West.\n\n\n-----\n\nComparing 4d4b17ddbcf4ce397f76cf0a2e230c9d513b23065f746a5ee2de74f447be39b9 from the Sony attack with\n5b5aede68a6b3aa50cd62c5f4f02078620f0b7be4ceb679b6d5dfe25a44b8cb9 from the Korhigh attack we see code\nreuse. Specifically, the code used for spreading over the network is almost identical. The technique used by both\ngoes as follows:\n\n1. Scan for computers that have ports 139 and 443 open\n2. Test the remote login credentials by attempting to access the admin$ share\n3. If successful, create a remote service with the name “RasMgrp “ and description “RasSecruity”.\n4. Use the commands “cmd.exe /q /c net share shared$=%SystemRoot%” and “cmd.exe /q /c net share\nshared$=%SystemRoot% /GRANT:everyone,FULL” to create a “shared$” share.\n5. Copy itself over to the share\n6. Match the new file’s timestamp to that of the local “calc.exe”\n7. Delete the share using the same service name, this time with the command “cmd.exe /q /c net share shared$\n/delete”\n\nEven the filenames used when copying itself over the share are similar:\n\n|Destover filenames|Korhigh filenames|\n|---|---|\n|recdiscm32.exe|recdiscm.exe|\n|taskhosts64.exe|taskhosts.exe|\n|taskchg16.exe|taskchg.exe|\n|rdpshellex32.exe|rdpshellex.exe|\n|mobsynclm64.exe|mobsynclm.exe|\n|comon32.exe|comon32.exe|\n|diskpartmg16.exe|diskpartmg.exe|\n|dpnsvr16.exe|dpnsvr32.exe|\n|expandmn32.exe|expandmn.exe|\n|hwrcompsvc64.exe|hwrcompsvc.exe|\n\n\n-----\n\n_File timestamp matching function comparison_\n\nThere is little doubt that parts of the same codebase has been used in both of these attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the Sony incident, several malware samples contained information that seemed to indicate foreknowledge about\nthe layout of the targeted networks. This included local hostnames, usernames and even passwords.\n\nThis was also the case in the Korhigh attack. At least two samples\n(5b5aede68a6b3aa50cd62c5f4f02078620f0b7be4ceb679b6d5dfe25a44b8cb9,\nd6a07b7ecd5ae7e948cce032603558a5d21100ba5f04056c72aec1ab2d36956e) came with pre-defined\nconfigurations containing domain, hostname, username and password combinations. Though we have no hard data\nto confirm this, it could mean that Korhigh was part of an actual intrusion at the time.\n\n#### Part of a config resource showing network information.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### NOV 2014: SONY ATTACK DESTOVER BACKDOOR SAMPLES ARE BASED ON KORDLLBOT\n\n\nThe Destover “lightweight backdoor” (sha256\n4c2efe2f1253b94f16a1cab032f36c7883e4f6c8d9fc17d0ee553b5afb16330c) mentioned in official statements\nrelated to the Sony intrusion is a digitally signed file. There is also an almost identical unsigned file in existence with\nthe sha256 eff542ac8e37db48821cb4e5a7d95c044fff27557763de3a891b40ebeb52cc55. This unsigned file is the\noriginal. It was established that the signed file was created as a “joke” by a researcher (4).\n\nWe were able to locate more malware samples similar to this backdoor. Many of these were created in a\ntimeframe well before the Sony intrusion came to light. Some also match the import hash indicators mentioned in\nthe US-CERT advisory, though import hashes are non-unique indicators and cannot always be relied upon.\n\nCloser investigation reveals that this Destover sample is indeed derived from the same source base as KorDllbot.\nThis is based on the following indicators:\n\n  - The Chopstring API string obfuscation\n\n  - The CMXE command line construction\n\n  - Same way of declaring API’s\n\n  - Similarities with later samples, such as:\n\n`o` A printf “MessageThread” statement in the beginning of the command handling function (similar\nto Destover “MessageThread” samples)\n`o` Use of the XOR-A7 encoding to decode strings (similar to Destover “b076e058” samples)\n\nThroughout 2014 and 2015 and still ongoing in 2016, Destover-related backdoors have continued to be used in\nvarious campaigns. They share many common traits, but there are also clear differences in functionality, hinting at\na common source repository but where customization is added as needed. Some subfamilies have received their\nown variant names – i.e. Volgmer and Duuzer – while others have no separate moniker. See appendix for detailed\ndescriptions of variants.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### OTHER POSSIBLY RELATED MALWARE ACTIVITY\n\n\nA number of incidents and malware systems have been attributed to either the DarkSeoul group or North Korean\nthreat actors. This chapter will quickly go through some of these.\n\n\n##### THE CASTOV AND CASTDOS CAMPAIGNS (AKA 6.25 DDOS ATTACKS)\n\n\nThe Castov campaign mainly targeted South Korean financial corporations and was discovered in May 2013 (16).\nNotably, these malwares included code to steal banking credentials.\n\nSome were designed to perform DDOS attacks on Korean government servers on June 25[th], 2013 (16) (12) – the\nsame date that the destructive Korhigh malware was also uncovered - though we have no information as to\nwhether these cases were connected.\n\nOn the face of it, there is little to directly connect the Castov malware with the DarkSeoul/Destover complex, as the\ncodebase is largely different. For example, the initial downloader was a crimeware known as Tijcont, distributed by\nthe Gongda exploit kit. The downloaded banking malware was written in Delphi, uncommon for DarkSeoul projects.\n\nHowever, Symantec states clearly in their blog post that they attribute Castov to the DarkSeoul group.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE KIMSUKY SYSTEM\n\n\nThe Kimsuky malware complex was originally detailed in a report from Kaspersky (14) in 2013 and has been an\nactive component of the South Korean threat landscape since then. Ahnlab reported a new campaign in Feb 2014\n(15), and an intrusion attempt into South Korean nuclear facilities in Dec 2014 was also identified to involve\nKimsuky (16).\n\nThe Kimsuky malware is different in structure from the Destover complex. It uses different encoding schemes and\nalgorithms than Destover, and email and FTP is used for C&C communication and exfiltration.\n\nSimilar to Destover, Kimsuky has used HWP exploits as infection vector. A number of samples rely on\nvulnerabilities in the old OLE2-based HWP file format. However, they have not, as far as we have seen, used the\nrecent CVE-2015-6585 HWPX vulnerability which has been used to plant at least three variants of Destover.\n\nThere are some similarities in modus operandi, such as\n\n  - Encoded API usage.\n\n  - Frequent code hand-modifications between samples\n\n  - Malware installed as services\n\n  - Taunting the victim in public fora\n\n  - Posing as hacktivist groups (17)\n\n  - Publication of stolen data (17)\n\nBased on the available data we cannot say that the Kimsuky-based campaigns are connected to the DarkSeoul\ngroup.\n\n\n##### THE BLACKMINE SYSTEM\n\n\nBlackmine is a South Korean focused malware campaign detailed by Ahnlab (18).\n\nThe payload malware in question is a data harvester and uploader, which also allows for download of more\nmalware. In the same way as Kimsuky, there are some similar approaches with Destover – the usage of obfuscated\nAPI names for example – but also enough differences to say that Blackmine probably has not originated from the\nsame codebase. Ahnlab does however state that they see these groups as possibly correlated.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CONCLUSION\n\n\nThe attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment incorporated the use of malware which contained a number of\ncommonalities with malware used in previously known attacks.\n\nThese previous attacks were mainly focused against South Korean entities such as financial institutions,\ngovernment sites, think tanks and other important functions. Targets outside South Korea have also been affected,\nalbeit to a lesser extent: Apart from the Sony intrusion, the Dozer DDOS attacks of 2009 were also directed towards\nUS websites.\n\nThe amount of common factors between the different incidents makes it in our opinion very likely that these\nincidents are perpetrated by the same group, or at least cooperating groups.\n\nIn this paper, we are not commenting on geographical attribution for the Sony attack. We note that a number of\n[the mentioned previous attacks (Dozer (15), Koredos, Korhigh](http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2282616/south-korea-blames-cyber-attacks-on-north-korean-government-hackers) (16), DarkSeoul (17)) have been associated with\nNorth Korean involvement, but these associations have not been examined or validated by us.\n\nIt is worth noting that this threat actor is still active. We have seen Destover-samples compiled as recently as\nJanuary 2016. DarkSeoul should be considered a constant risk factor, particularly for South Korean institutions.\n\nThe Destover malware family seems to be the information gathering workhorse of this group – adapted and\nchanged to fit the purpose du jour, but retaining a lot of the same overall design and methodology. For specific\ntargets more customized malware is often deployed.\n\nCommand and control connections are almost always going to raw IP addresses, and different malware generations\ntend to use different sets of addresses. It is our assumption that most of these IP’s are compromised computers\nwhich probably are running proxies, and as such are easily disposable.\n\n\n© 2016 Blue Coat Systems, Inc. All rights reserved.

This is actually not a worm at all, as there is no code for network propagation present. Instead, it\nis a data harvester and backdoor which bears some similarity with KorDllbots – API’s are dynamically declared,\nharvested data is added to ZIP file before exfiltration, and the command structure uses a set of integers (0x1010 –\n0x1020).\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Joanap malware series contains code snippets from publicly available Rbot code (25).\nThis includes an implementation of the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) which has been somewhat modified, as\nwell as the Rbot PLAIN_CRYPT algorithm. The default key used in the PLAIN_CRYPT public Rbot source is the string\n”9024jhdho39ehe2”. This key is used if there is no other key passed to the algorithm.\n\nHowever, this backdoor uses the same default key as later Joanap variants - “9025jhdho39ehe2”, a one-byte\nchange quite specific to this malware series.\n\nJoanap.A also uses a custom key which is used both in the PLAIN_CRYPT algorithm (for string decryption) and in the\nTEA algorithm (for data file encryption/decryption). This is the string “hybrid!@hybrid!@#” – which is visible in\ncleartext inside the executable.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### JOANAP.B WORM, OCT 2009\n\n\nThis malware is significantly different from the A version. The main similarity between them is the use of the Rbot\nPLAIN_CRYPT algorithm for string decryption with the mentioned “9025jhdho39ehe2” default key. The custom key\nused is now changed to “iamsorry!@1234567”.\n\nThe executable contains two XOR-encrypted objects in its resource section. One is a dictionary file containing\npasswords, stored in resource 101. The other, stored in resource 103, is an executable – a copy of the legitimate\nPsExec tool from SysInternals.\n\nContrary to the A version, this variant is a true worm. It generates random IP addresses and attempts to connect to\nthese over the SMB port 445/tcp. It uses the WNetAddConnection2A API to map the remote machine as a share,\nusing its dictionary of passwords. If this works, it will copy itself to the system folder of the remote server, and\nextract its embedded PsExec application to execute the file remotely.\n\nThe malware does not connect directly to a C&C server. Instead it sends status mails to its controller via GMail’s\npublic mail server gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. The email will appear to be sent FROM ninja@gmail.com TO\n_xiake722@gmail.com. Content is all in the subject field – initially only version (1.1), time, and local IP address._\nUpon successful connection and copy to a remote machine, the malware sends mail again – this time also\ncontaining remote IP, username and password, in addition to its initial fields.\n\n_Above: Email transfer between Joanap and the mail server._\n\nA minor sub-variant of this Joanap generation exists. This sends email just the same way as described above, but\nuses a different TO address (laohu1985@gmail.com) during network propagation.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### JOANAP.B DOWNLOADED BACKDOOR, SEP 2009\n\n\nHowever, spreading is not the main payload of the B version of Joanap. Instead, it attempts to download and install\na second stage malware. This malware, with the sha256 hash of\n_c6d96be46ce3d616e0cb36d53c4fade7e954e74bfd2e34f9f15c4df58fc732d2, was hosted on the URL_\n_hxxp://www.booklist.co.kr/upload/img/200810/25.gif. It would be downloaded and saved to disk under the name_\n_sysfault.exe and executed._\n\nThis malware is an installer, installing a service dll in the system folder under the name “sdnssec.dll”. This is a listenonly backdoor, establishing a listening socket on port 136.\n\nSimilar to the Joanap.A variant and other KorDllbot-related backdoors, this supports a number of integer\ncommands. The binary contains quite a lot of debug messages helpfully explaining the functionality of these.\n\n|Command|Function|\n|---|---|\n|0x1010 List drives 0x1011 File browse 0x1012 File copy 0x1013 File delete 0x1014 File upload (to target) 0x1015 File download (to botmaster) 0x1016 Execute file 0x1017 Change filetime 0x1018 Folder download (to botmaster) 0x1019 Test connect 0x1020 Run shell command 0x1021 Sleep 0x1023 File properties 0x1030 Process view 0x1031 Process kill 0x1032 Process kill by name 0x10FF Uninstall||\n\n\n-----\n\n##### JOANAP.C BACKDOOR, JUL 2010\n\n\nThe installer of Joanap.D (next entry) also actively deletes installed files named signtc.ax, signtm.ax, or signts.ax.\nSearching for these brought up an apparently preceding sample which uses one of these files - signtc.ax - for\nstoring data. This sample appears to belong to a series of previous backdoors somewhat related to KorDllbot –\nexample SHA-256 hash is 4b6078e3fa321b16e94131e6859bfca4503bcb440e087d5ae0f9c87f1c77b421.\n\nWe have not analyzed this variant in detail.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### JOANAP.D BACKDOOR, JUL 2011\n\n\nThis malware arrives as a service installer which extracts and installs a DLL named scardprv.dll from its resource\nsection, and writes hardcoded configuration data to a config file named mssscardprv.ax. It also attempts to delete\nfiles installed by previous Joanap versions.\n\nThe dropped service DLL has similarities with KorDllbots. It establishes a listening socket on a semi-random port\nwhich is either located between 1024 and 2048; or selected from a list of hardcoded port options. It also attempts\nto connect to C&C servers which are defined in the saved mssscardprv.ax file as raw IP address/port combinations.\n\nAll network traffic is encrypted using RC4 with the binary key\n(0x10,0x20,0x30,0x40,0x50,0x60,0x70,0x80,0x90,0x11,0x12,0x13,0x1A,0xFF,0xEE,0x48), and the backdoor accepts\ninteger commands in the range 0x4001-0x4015.\n\nAPI strings reside in data blocks encrypted using AES. Network API’s are encrypted with the key\n_“b n4rbhriq890v9=023=01*&(T-0Q325J1N;LK'”, while all others are encrypted with the key_\n_“Bb102@jH4$t3hg%6&G1s*2J3gCNwVr*UeI!Dr3hytg^CHGf%ion”. This particular AES key was also found in both_\nJoanap and KorDllbot malware belonging to the previously mentioned MicrosoftCodeSigningPCA certificate cluster.\n\nIn addition, this variant includes the Rbot PLAIN_CRYPT decryption keys “9025jhdho39ehe2” and\n“iamsorry!@1234567” for one specific decryption scenario. So, even though it is somewhat different from previous\nvariants, it contains enough technical indicators to link it to the Joanap family.\n\nThe samples we have seen do not appear to have network spreader capability, though they may have been\ndropped by other malware.\n\n_Above: Indicators in the binary_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### JOANAP.E WORM, AUG-SEP 2011\n\n\nJoanap.E was the first variant of this family we tied to this threat complex, due to the fact that several samples are\nsigned using the peculiar MicrosoftCodeSigningPCA certificate format.\n\nThis variant is again a worm – as mentioned before, the installer drops three files – one SMB spreading DLL\n(wmmvsvc.dll), one backdoor DLL (scardprv.dll) and one configuration file (mssscardprv.ax). The backdoor DLL and\nthe configuration file fill the same role as in Joanap.D.\n\nThe network spreader module contains some code from the B variant, but a lot of functionality has been reworked.\nSimilarly to B, it generates semi-random IP addresses and attempts to logon to the admin account of these\nmachines using a password dictionary. If it manages to do this, it creates a remote share named “$adnim” (no\ntypo), copies the main installer (and the configuration file) over, and executes it. The authors have moved away\nfrom using PsExec for remote execution. Instead they add shares and execute the worm by creating remote service\ncommands via the Service Control Manager.\n\nIf this is successful, the worm sends a status mail the same way as the B variant. Mail is this time FROM:\n_redhat@gmail.com TO: Joana <misswang8107@gmail.com>._\n\nThis malware uses the same encryption keys as the B variant. This worm sets the mutex “PlatFormSDK2.1”.\n\n\n##### JOANAP.F WORM, MAR 2012\n\n\nWe have only two slightly different samples of this generation. Again, the malware’s structure has changed. It is no\nlonger a service DLL, but instead a standalone Windows executable. Contrary to previous versions, this worm\nrequires being started with at least one command line parameter (either –i or -s), if not it just exits.\n\nThe –s parameter starts the spreading routine if it is installed correctly and it can find its configuration files. The\nsamples we have come without installer or data files and do not run.\n\nThere is no doubt that these samples belong to this malware family – they use the same encryption keys, mutex\nstructures and data file names as the E variant in the series. There is one notable exception: This is the first time we\nsee the file encryption RC4 key “y0uar3@s!11yid!07,ou74n60u7f001”, which closely matches the key mentioned as\nbelonging to the “SMB Word Tool” in the US-CERT advisory (2) after the Sony incident,\n_\"y0uar3@s!llyid!07,ou74n60u7f001”. The difference might be due to a typo. The malware appears not to be_\nidentical though, as some other strings from the advisory YARA rule are not present.\n\nThis worm sets the mutex “PlatFormSDK2”.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### JOANAP.G WORM, OCT 2014\n\n\nThis Joanap variation uses the mutex “Global\\FwtSqmSession106829323_S-1-5-19”, which also matches data from\nthe US-CERT advisory (2). However, this time the worm has switched to a different RC4 key “y@s!11yid60u7f!07ou74n001”. This variation has been detailed by researchers from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (4).\n\n\n##### JOANAP.H WORMS, OCT 2014-JAN 2015\n\n\nThis is a series on Joanap executables produced towards the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. They use the\nmutex “Global\\FwtSqmSession106839323_S-1-5-20”, but the same RC4 key as the G variants.\n\nSome samples are quite a lot larger than normal on account of including a big chunk of code from the open source\nFreeRDP remote desktop client. Apart from this we have not analyzed these samples in detail.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### THE DESTOVER FAMILY\n\n\n##### DESTOVER “B076E058” BACKDOORS, FEB-JUNE 2014.\n\n\nThis sub variant has been named “b076e058” based on the first portion of the RSA authentication key used for its\nserver handshake.\n\nMost samples share the ChopString and XOR-A7 obfuscation functions with the Sony-associated malware\neff542ac8e37db48821cb4e5a7d95c044fff27557763de3a891b40ebeb52cc55. They also declare API calls in the\nsame way.\n\nSamples of this variant were all compiled with the library name “Troy.dll” in the Export Table, similar to what\nMcAfee documented in their “Operation Troy” paper (5) on destructive attacks against South Korean targets.\n\n_Troy.dll visible in 10d3ab45077f01675a814b189d0ac8a157be5d9f1805caa2c707eecbb2cbf9ac_\n\nThis variant is typically installed as service, with one export - “ServiceMain”. Its main purpose is to listen on a given\nport and accept commands. The integer codes used for these commands are:\nA variant: 0x54b7- 0x54cb, with the exception of 0x54be and 0x54ca.\nB variant: 0x54b7- 0x54cb, with the exception of 0x54be and 0x54ca, and the addition of 0x54d0.\n\nThe installation is done by unobfuscated dropper executables, which install the service DLLs after performing some\nsystems checks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “VOLGMER” BACKDOORS, MAR-SEPT 2014\n\n\nVolgmer backdoors were quickly connected to the Sony case, since several samples use a C&C IP address\n(200.87.126.116) in common with the Sony malware droppers. The family is easily recognized by the peculiar\nUserAgent strings used, which all start with “Mozillar/” instead of “Mozilla/.”\n\nThese backdoors come in three flavors (that we’ve found).\nThe first batch was apparently compiled March 15, 2014. These appear to be prototypes for later versions, and\nhelpfully contain debug strings labeling all major functionality. We have only DLL samples of this variant.\n\nThe second batch was apparently compiled in April 2014. The droppers contain a service DLL and a configuration\nfile in a password-protected zip archive embedded as a resource in the dropper executable. The dropper needs to\nbe able to extract these files, so it also contains the password - which in this case is “!1234567890\ndghtdhtrhgfjnui$%^^&fdt.”\n\nThe third batch was apparently compiled in June and July 2014. These droppers contain a regular Win32 executable\nwhere the configuration data is contained in the exe. The dropped executable checks the current locale and will not\nrun unless this contains the string “korea.”\n\nEach dropper package comes configured with partially different C&C information. True to the standard modus\noperandi of this group, all C&C servers are defined as raw IP addresses, typically located on ports in the 8000-range,\nsuch as 8080, 8088 or 8888.\n\n_Configuration file from the first batch of Volgmer droppers - after the cgi_config marker follow IP/port pairs._\n\nMain functionality involves gathering system information and uploading this to the two main C&C servers in an\n\nencoded ZIP-archived format. They accept commands in the range 0x1000-0x1008 (A) and 0x1000-0x1012 (B/C).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “WINDOWSUPDATETRACING” BACKDOORS, SEPT-OCT 2014\n\n\nThis malware is somewhat different in design than previously mentioned variants. The installer package installs the\nbackdoor along with legitimate packet filtering components, and there is code to steal credentials from a great deal\nof different products, some of which are Korean. One interesting feature with this malware is that it has some\nlimited support for other languages - it contains some user folder names in ex. Spanish and Portuguese in addition\nto English. The name “WindowsUpdateTracing” is derived from a mutex created by this variant – typically this will\nbe “WindowsUpdateTracing0.5” but the suffixes “0.6” and “0.7” also exist. Chopstring API obfuscation is also\npresent.\n\nCommand integers are in the range 0x58692ab8-0x58692ac0.\n\nThis trojan uses a semi-traditional Command and Control model, with connections seemingly going to a number of\nDynDNS domains that are defined in an accompanying configuration file named msxml15.xml. This configuration\nfile is encrypted using RC4; typically with the RC4 key “BAISEO%$2fas9vQsfvx%$” though some samples use the API\nname “GetFileAttributesW” as key – possibly a bug.\n\nKnown C2 domains:\n\n_iphoneserver.lflink.com_\n_dns05.mefound.com_\n_mx1.mefound.com_\n_dns01.vizvaz.com_\n_myserver.mrbonus.com_\n_game.dnsrd.com_\n_dns01.zzux.com_\n_exchange01.toh.info_\n_exchange04.yourtrap.com_\n\n**However, the DNS resolution for these domains is misleading. The IP address returned by the DNS server will be**\nXOR’ed with a 32-bit key (we have seen two different keys, depending on variant type), which yields the correct C2\nIP address to use. This means that relying on DNS resolution to identify C&C hosts will not work.\n\n\n-----\n\n_IP longint returned in the DNS response is XOR’ed with a dword integer._\n\nThis bogus DNS response can be used in an interesting fashion. The domain mx1.mefound.com has resolved to the\nbogus IP 44.58.156.86. When this IP is converted using the corresponding XOR key 0x579C3A53 it becomes\n127.0.0.1 – i.e. localhost. Presumably this is done when the bot is not active. The IP 44.58.156.86 belongs to\nUniversity of California at San Diego (UCSD) and have as far as I can tell never been used to host any publicly\navailable domain. Still, passive DNS data shows that this IP has been the DNS response of a number of DynDNS\ndomains; many of which we had not seen before. We may thus assume that these domains are used in backdoors\ncontaining the same XOR key as this particular Destover sample. This applies to the following additional domains:\n\n_update03.compress.to_\n_baid.otzo.com_\n_mx2.mefound.com_\n_facebok.mrbasic.com_\n_report01.onedumb.com_\n_appinfo.yourtrap.com_\n_gupdate.yourtrap.com_\n_status01.instanthq.com_\n_eschool.toythieves.com_\n_gogle.jungleheart.com_\n_mycompany.moneyhome.biz_\n\n\n-----\n\nSince we know the XOR key used, we can also translate any other IP’s associated with these domains to presumably\ncorrect C&C IP addresses (see appendix). If we repeat this process with the other XOR key we know of 0x1AB9C2D8 - we end up with the localhost IP 127.0.0.1 translating to the bogus IP of 167.194.185.27. No\nadditional data was found at this time using this method, but any DynDNS domain resolving to this IP in the future\nmight be interesting to look at.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “MESSAGETHREAD” BACKDOORS, MAY 2014-MAR 2015\n\n\nThese Destover backdoors contain the Chopstring obfuscation, as well as XOR-A7 encoding.\nThey are straight remote control tools of the basic KorDllBot model. The name stems from the Unicode string\n“MessageThread” present in all samples of this type. The Sony Destover sample belonged to this variation.\n\nThe command integers used by this variant are typically in the range 0x523b-0x5249.\n\nUnlike many other Destover trojans, some of these installers come with embedded decoy documents, hinting at\nintended target audience.  The decoys are all in Korean language – one document lists telephone numbers\nbelonging to personnel in government and other public functions; other samples contain an invitation to the\nKorean Government 3.0 expo that was to be held in in Seoul.\n\n_Gov 3.0 expo invitation_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “B8AC0905” BACKDOOR, MAR 2015\n\n\nWe have only a single sample of this variant. The name b8ac0905 is derived from the authentication key string\ncontained in the file (See appendix). The API obfuscation is here done via an encoding scheme which appears\nunique, but bears some similarity with RC4. We call this encoding “Intbox” as the S-Box is not populated using a\nstring as input, but instead is a function of an integer key.\n\nThis is a “listen only” backdoor, and does not call out to any C&C server directly. We do not have the configuration\ndata that presumably was installed along with this sample, so no more details are available at this time.\n\nThe integer commands it expects are 0x00-0x0f, 0x12 and 0x15.\n\n\n##### DESTOVER “B59D1659” BACKDOOR, APR 2015\n\n\nWe have only one sample of this variant too – a Win64 DLL exporting the functions ServiceMain, RasmanStart and\n_RasManEnd.Of these, only ServiceMain has any real function. The sample attempts to impersonate the legitimate_\nappmgmts.dll from X64 Windows 7. It is even of the exact same size as the original. The name b59d1659 is derived\nfrom the RSA authentication key string contained in the file (see appendix).\n\nThe command words used by this variant are in the range 0x2638000-x236801b.\n\nThe C&C configuration is read from a data flle - appmgmts.rs - which presumably is created by the installer, and\nwhich we do not have a copy of. Thus, C&C information and distribution method is unknown for this variant.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “RANDOMDOMAIN” BACKDOORS, MAR-APR 2015. VERSION C JAN 2016\n\n\nDestover “Randomdomain” backdoors have also evolved from the original KorDllbots. They come in both x86 and\nx64 versions.\n\nThere seems to be three distinct variants of this class of backdoors with slightly different obfuscation methods used\nand C&C configuration, though most variants use the same API obfuscation – an inline character replacement\ntechnique resulting in almost recognizable API strings in the file. We name this technique “CharSwap” for the\npurpose of this paper.\n\nThey connect to their C&C servers using what appears to be SSL/TLS. This includes a remote server name indication\n(SNI) extension in the initial Client Hello. This server name is randomly picked from an internal list of domain names\n– thus the name “Randomdomain.” A list of such names can be found in the appendix. When I say “appears to be”\nSSL/TLS, this is because the encryption actually used is not secure. The malware can choose between different\nsimple encryption modi, and these are somewhat different between the known variants.\n\nVariant A uses either RC4 with the string “TCPPROCESSREADY.” as encryption key, or a XOR 0x28, SUB 0x28\nencoding, or a segmented XOR encoding . Variant B uses either simple byte wise XOR encoding with a shifting key,\nor an even simpler XOR 0x25, SUB 0x25 encoding. Variant C uses only one – the same shifting XOR encoding used\nby variant B.\n\nVariant C checks auto proxy settings and will connect through the configured proxy if possible. This code is not seen\nin earlier versions.\n\nThe command words used by these backdoors are in the range 0x123459 - 0x12348a (some files to 0x123488).\n\nThe two first variants were apparently in use in the first half of 2015. Variant C has been used more recently – we\nhave seen only two samples, the first date stamped May 2015, the last Jan 12[th], 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “DUUZER” BACKDOORS, MAR-OCT 2015, JAN 2016\n\n\nThe Duuzer variation of Destover backdoors have evolved quite a bit from the original KorDllbot basis. They use\nmore in-code obfuscation and are somewhat more complex. For example, string references are stored as encoded\nlocal variables in special functions. Access to these variables is obtained by calling the containing function with an\noffset into the variable blob, and the function decodes the correct string.\n\nSimilar to the “RandomDomain” and “e4004c1f” these backdoors use specially crafted SSL headers to initiate\ncommunication with their C&C servers, but the encryption is custom. The command scheme is also somewhat\nunique – instead of a digit to indicate which function to perform, these backdoors use binary multibyte command\nstatements.\n\nThere are several sub variants of Duuzer. One sample . (sha256\nf31d6feacf2ecece13696dcc2da15d15d29028822011b45045f9efa8a0522098) appears to be a predecessor and\nsomewhat simpler than later samples. Later variants include the “live” and the “naver” versions - based on the\nserver name they use in their faked SSL handshake, either “login.live.com” or “ad.naver.com”. The latest versions\nwe have seen – compiled January 2016 – don’t even bother with these strings.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Duuzer has been detailed in a report from Symantec (3). This report also mentions the\nconnection to the Joanap malware family, and details examples of live usage of the “CMXE” command line\nexecution mentioned before.\n\nThis variant has been seen as the payload of trojanized HWPX documents exploiting the CVE-2015-6585\nvulnerability as documented by FireEye (6). Decoy documents include invitations to events like Korean Aerospace\n_Systems Engineering 2015, and Aeroseminar 2015; a Korean Aerospace Weapon System Development Seminar_\n(below). An email found on VirusTotal shows that an exploited document containing this exact decoy was\nattempted sent to the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI).\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “E4004C1F” BACKDOOR, JUL-SEP 2015\n\n\nThe main differences in this backdoor arise from the inclusion of what appears to be modified open source SSL/TLS\ncode. This is used to construct legitimate SSL headers, though the communication itself is encrypted by a\nhomegrown encoding scheme. This backdoor is found in both x86 and x64 variants.\n\nThe name e4004c1f is taken from the start of the authentication key found in all these samples.\n\nThe command integers vary somewhat between sub variants:\n\nVariant A samples use the range 0x00-0x0f, with addition of bytes 0x12, 0x1b, and 0x64.\nVariant B samples use the range 0x0a-0x24, with exception of bytes 0x18, 0x1c, and 0x1d\nVariant C samples use the range 0x0a-0x26, with exception of bytes 0x18, 0x1c, and 0x1d\n\nThis family has also been used as the payload of CVE-2015-6585 trojanized HWP documents. The FireEye write-up\non this mentions a backdoor they name HANGMAN (7). FireEye uses a proprietary malware naming scheme which\nmakes it somewhat difficult to correlate, but we believe this corresponds to the “e4004c1f” variant. In the same\nblog post FireEye mentions a backdoor they call PEACHPIT. Based on the code snippet shown, we believe PEACHPIT\nto belong to one of the early KorDllbot generations. As mentioned, the exact same CMXE code has been used in\nseveral generations from 2011 and onwards.\n\nDecoy documents used by “e4004c1f” include descriptions of the LDAP protocol, and a text on the virtues of Scrum\nvs Kanban. The latter was attempted sent to the Korean Google group “sysadminstudy”. It is possible that this\ngeneration of malware has been aimed at the IT/software industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy documents used by the “e4004c1f” variant include a Korean text on the LDAP protocol._\n\nApart from the similarities with other malware established in the publications mentioned above, this variant has\nbeen distributed in a particular installer which includes the backdoor in an embedded password-protected zip\narchive. The password for this zip archive is “!1234567890 dghtdhtrhgfjnui$%^^&fdt” - identical to the password\nused by Destover “Volgmer” backdoors already detailed in this paper. There are also code similarities with Volgmer\nelsewhere – for example, the function to declare network API’s from ws2_32.dll is identical, and the API names are\nencoded using the same API obfuscation scheme.\n\nThe C&C configuration can be hardcoded, or stored in a data file and subkeys under the registry key\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Security.**\n\nSome variant A samples uses subkey a57890bc-ca23-3453-a23c-d385e9058fdf\nSome variant C samples uses subkey 821d1af-7a08-4b06-81cd-869365cdf713\n\n\n-----\n\n_The network API declaration function of a Destover “Volgmer” and a Destover “e4004c1f” backdoor._\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “BASICHWP” BACKDOOR, SEP 2015\n\n\nThis generation of backdoors is similar to the previous ones in that they use a custom SSL-like protocol for C&C\ncommunication. They have been further simplified, but use more C++ classes, and the 256-bit stream cipher\n_Caracachs (hardcoded password “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345”) is used for both network traffic and API_\nobfuscation. The same password is used in the example code for Caracachs found online (8), so no great effort has\nbeen taken to protect the encryption.\n\nThis variety of Destover is the third we have seen installed by documents exploiting the CVE-2015-6585 HWP\nvulnerability.\n\nCommand word set for this generation of backdoors is 0x8378-0x8390.\n\nDecoy document content include a CV from an apparently South Korean individual, and a document apparently\nfrom the South Korean Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, as seen below.\n\n_Decoy: State information systems audit planning document, Aug 2015_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “FORMBOUNDARY” BACKDOOR, NOV 2015\n\n\nThis backdoor has many code overlaps with RandomDomain.B – for example, it uses CharSwap API obfuscation,\nand uses the same set of integer commands. It has evolved away from the use of faked SSL, which means whole\nsegments of code have been removed, including most of the domain names used for the SSL handshake. Instead, it\nconnects to the C&C server via regular HTTP on port 80 and initially posts a blob of random data disguised as a\nlegitimate file. Any real content is sent encrypted afterwards, using one of the bytewise XOR encodings known from\n_RandomDomain._\n\n_Sending initial POST statement to C&C server_\n\nThe HTTP header fields can vary – many are selected from hardcoded lists, including the “Host” field. The\nFormBoundary string is terminated by a randomly generated character sequence, and the malware queries the\nsystem via the API call ObtainUserAgentString to get the current default User Agent. If this call fails, the hardcoded\nUser Agent “AgentString” is used instead.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### DESTOVER “VOLGMER2” BACKDOOR, JAN 2016\n\n\nThis was found as a DLL backdoor sample “t(x86).dll” which contained several traits in common with the Volgmer\nseries. Further data mining revealed that identically to Volgmer, the sample is installed by a dropper which contains\nthe DLL in an embedded zip file resource named “MYRES” in its body. This dropper is again extracted by another\nouter dropper with a similar embedded zip inside, which also in addition contains a configuration file ntuser.inf.\n\n#### ShADprops.dll\n\n «MYRES» ZIP resource\n\n Loader(x86).dll ntuser.inf\n\n config data «MYRES» ZIP resource\n\n t(x86).dll\n\n main payload\n\nThis config file contains - among other things - C&C IP and port information, which is read and written to a registry\nkey before being used by the main payload component.\n\n**HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Security subkey = “72ca1d1af-7afc-4c06-cc1d-8feaac5cdf764”.**\n\nVolgmer2 shares API declaration functions and string decode algorithms with the original Volgmer. However, there\nare also clear differences. Its network behavior has moved away from HTTP post with the recognizable “Mozillar”\nUserAgent. Instead, C&C traffic is performed via faked SSL with another encryption twist – RC4 with a layer of XOR\non top. They RC4 key is binary, and hardcoded in the executable: 0x0d, 0x06,0x09, 0x2a, 0x86, 0x48, 0x86, 0xf7,\n0x0d, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x05, 0x00, 0x03, 0x82. Similarly to the RandomDomain series, Volgmer2 uses domain\nnames chosen randomly from a list in its SSL handshake.\n\n\n#### ShADprops.dll\n\n «MYRES» ZIP resource\n\n Loader(x86).dll ntuser.inf\n\n config data «MYRES» ZIP resource\n\n t(x86).dll\n\n main payload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dropper executables in the “Volgmer 1” series contained some checks for VM environments. Volgmer2 has\ntaken this further, and included a number of anti-debugging tricks and of checks for what appears to be known\nsandbox environments.\n\n_Volgmer1 vs Volgmer2 dropper evasions._\n\nThe change also means that the malware continues to work if under a virtualized environment, if there are no other\nindicators that there is monitoring or debugging activity going on. The check for known sandbox environments is\ndone by comparing the computer name with the names in the following list:\n\nMARS53\n35347\nJOHN-PC\nTVMCOM\nPLACEHOL-6F699A\nWIN7PRO-MALTEST\nWINDOWS-F99AACA\nXELRCUZ-AZ\nRATS-PC\nPXE472179\n\nThe command integers used by Volgmer2 are in the range 0x09-0x27 with the exception of 0x17, 0x1b and 0x1c.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APPENDIX: ALGORITHMS AND OTHER INDICATORS\n\n\n#### Chopstring obfuscation\n\n_Chopstring deobfuscator_\n\n_Deobfuscation of the API name before it is sent to GetProcAddress.
