For example, one document template pretends to be a warning from\n\"Windows Defender Antivirus,\" providing instructions on enabling macros.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Qbot phishing document**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhen launched, the Qbot DLL payload will be injected and launched into legitimate Windows\napplications to evade detection, such as MSRA.exe and Mobsync.exe. For example, in The\nDFIR Report's analysis, Qbot injected into MSRA.exe and then created a scheduled task for\nprivilege elevation.\n\nAdditionally, the malware adds the Qbot DLL to Microsoft Defender's exclusion list, so it won't\nbe detected when injection into msra.exe happens.\n\n**Discovery commands injected into msra.exe**\n\n_Source: The DFIR Report_\nThe malware steals emails in half an hour after the initial execution, which are then\n[commonly used for future replay-chain phishing attacks.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-steals-your-email-threads-again-to-infect-other-victims/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe researchers note that Qbot will also steal Windows credentials by dumping the memory\nof the LSASS (Local Security Authority Server Service) process and by stealing from web\nbrowsers. These credentials can then be used to spread to other devices on the network\nlaterally.\n\nThe DFIR Report states that it only took on average fifty minutes for credentials to be\ndumped after the malware was first executed.\n\nThe lateral movement takes place rapidly, so if there's no network segmentation to protect\nthe workstations, the situation becomes very challenging for defense teams.\n\nThe impact of these expeditious attacks isn't limited to data loss, as Qbot has also been\nobserved in the past to drop ransomware payloads onto compromised corporate networks.\n\nRansomware gangs known to have partnered with Qbot for initial access to corporate\n[networks include REvil, Egregor,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-partners-with-egregor-ransomware-in-bot-fueled-attacks/) [ProLock, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/prolock-ransomware-teams-up-with-qakbot-trojan-for-network-access/) [MegaCortex.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-megacortex-ransomware-found-targeting-business-networks/)\n\n## A versatile infection\n\n[A Microsoft report from December 2021 captured the versatility of Qbot attacks, making it](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-these-are-the-building-blocks-of-qbot-malware-attacks/)\nharder to evaluate the scope of its infections accurately.\n\nHowever, no matter how a Qbot infection unfolds precisely, it is essential to keep in mind that\nalmost all begin with an email, so this is the main access point that organizations need to\nstrengthen.\n\nToday's announcement by Microsoft that they will be blocking macros in downloaded\ndocuments by default by removing the 'Enable Content' and 'Enable Editing' buttons will go a\nlong way to protecting users from Qbot phishing attacks.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Phishing websites now use chatbots to steal your credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-websites-now-use-chatbots-to-steal-your-credentials/)\n\n[Fake crypto sites lure wannabe thieves by spamming login credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-crypto-sites-lure-wannabe-thieves-by-spamming-login-credentials/)\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[Emotet malware infects users again after fixing broken installer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-infects-users-again-after-fixing-broken-installer/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
