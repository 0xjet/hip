On LinkedIn, Kim\nclaimed she was a scriptwriter for the Seoul-based Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and\nneeded help on an upcoming piece pertaining to North Korea.\n\n## About the Authors\n\n**Ethan Jewell**\n\nEthan Jewell is a Seoul-based correspondent for NK News focused on sanctions, trade and\nmaritime issues.
