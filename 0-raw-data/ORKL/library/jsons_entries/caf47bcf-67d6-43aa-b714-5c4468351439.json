While much has already been written and will\ncontinue to emerge as more evidence comes available, lacking from the discussion so far is\na network-centric view of the general behaviors and detection possibilities associated with\nransomware deployment. In this article, Gigamon provides an overview of the event in\nquestion, the behaviors linked to similar ransomware operations, the importance of network\n[visibility, and possibilities for network detection and monitoring to meet these adversaries](https://www.gigamon.com/products/detect-respond/gigamon-threatinsight.html)\nand related malicious activities head-on.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 7, 2021, [Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware incident. While all available](https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption)\ninformation indicates that ransomware impacted only enterprise IT systems for Colonial, the\ncompany preemptively shut down linked industrial control systems (ICS) out of an\n[abundance of caution. The intrusion and resulting disruption were subsequently linked to a](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-suspects-criminal-group-with-ties-to-eastern-europe-in-pipeline-hack-11620664720)\n[ransomware variant known as DarkSide. Active since at least August 2020, DarkSide](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/)\n[operates under a “Ransomware as a Service” or “affiliate” model where the group provides](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\n[“double-extortion” ransomware services to other entities that execute the actual network](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/rise-of-double-extortion-shines-spotlight-on-ransomware-prevention)\nbreach and capability deployment. DarkSide then manages negotiations and payment to\nboth decrypt a victim’s information and to stop the selective leaking of data exfiltrated from\nthe target network.\n\nWhile DarkSide-related activity has continued at a relatively steady state since its initial\ndiscovery in 2020, the Colonial Pipeline incident is notable given its disruptive impact. While\nneither the [first notable cyber intrusion in pipeline systems, nor the first](https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060078327) [ransomware](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/assessment-of-ransomware-event-at-u-s-pipeline-operator/) [event on](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a)\npipeline infrastructure, Colonial’s preemptive shutdown of critical systems triggered a halt in\ntheir operations. As one of the main arteries delivering refined petroleum products to the\nEastern and Southeastern United States, the disruption induced reactions from panic buying\n[of gasoline through statements from the White House. Although Colonial was able to begin](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/10/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-the-colonial-pipeline-incident/)\nrestoring operations as [early as May 12, 2021, the shock and short-term impacts of the event](https://www.wsj.com/articles/colonial-pipeline-expects-to-fully-restore-service-thursday-following-cyberattack-11620917499)\nwere felt across both policymaker and information security circles.\n\n## Ransomware Entity Intrusion Tradecraft\n\nDarkSide ransomware impacted multiple victims since discovery in 2020. Yet while this\nultimate payload inducing network disruption (and data theft for extortion) is concerning,\ndefenders should focus on the preliminary steps enabling ransomware execution rather than\nthe ransomware family itself. In this respect, given the “affiliate model” through which\nadversaries deploy DarkSide, the ransomware variant can be linked to multiple behavioral\nprofiles.\n\nMultiple vendors provide insight into initial access, entrenchment, and subsequent lateral\nmovement activity linked to DarkSide deployment. Among the most notable examples are\nthe following:\n\n[Initial reporting from Digital Shadows in September 2020](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/)\n[Cyberreason Nocturnus’ overview of activity in April 2021](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware)\n[Varonis reporting, subsequently updated after the Colonial incident](https://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware/)\n[An overview of recent DarkSide behaviors from FireEye, also after the Colonial incident](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html)\n[Observations from incident response engagements from Sophos](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/05/11/a-defenders-view-inside-a-darkside-ransomware-attack/)\nFurther [analysis from Palo Alto Unit 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/darkside-ransomware/)\n\nThese are all valuable contributions to the discussion concerning DarkSide’s deployment,\nand Gigamon highly recommends defenders review these items for awareness and to\nbecome familiar with this threat. Yet all these items largely focus on host-based actions and\n\n\n-----\n\nobservations, which is unsurprising, as most of the entities in question are involved in hostbased security solutions. In addition to these observations, defenders possess a multitude of\noptions for tracking behaviors over the network related to DarkSide deployment, as well as\nother ransomware operations.\n\n## Initial Access Mechanisms\n\nAdversary deployment of DarkSide ransomware is linked to a variety of initial access\nmechanisms, as one would expect given that multiple entities relate to its use. Based on a\nreview of available literature and analysis, Gigamon identifies the following as primary\nDarkside affiliate mechanisms to initially breach victim networks:\n\nPhishing activity leveraging malicious attachments\nCredential replay attacks against external-facing services, such as Remote Desktop\nProtocol (RDP)\nUse of publicly disclosed exploits against external-facing services, such as\n[vulnerabilities in externally accessible VPN appliances (including CVE-2021-20016)](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0001)\n\nWhile the above represent known vectors linked to DarkSide affiliate operations, the specific\nmechanism used to infiltrate Colonial Pipeline is not known at the time of this writing.\nNonetheless, these initial intrusion mechanisms align well with common tradecraft\nassociated with not only criminal operations (such as ransomware), but also advanced\npersistent threat (APT) or state-directed intrusions.\n\nWhile one specific VPN exploit is called out in research from FireEye, Gigamon assesses\nthat other, publicly disclosed exploits have also likely been used as part of intrusions leading\nto ultimate ransomware deployment more generally. Given the significant increase in\ndisclosure and subsequent use of exploits targeting external-facing appliances such as VPN\nconcentrators, network defenders should anticipate rapid moves by a variety of adversaries,\nwhether related to DarkSide or not, to take advantage of such potential ingress points.\n\n## Lateral Movement and Command and Control Activity\n\nOnce within victim networks, DarkSide-related intrusions leverage a combination of built-in\n[system tools (such as “LoLBins”) and publicly or commercially available tools for varying](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/11/hunting-for-lolbins.html)\nlevels of network communication and functionality. Such items are deployed to both spread\nthroughout the victim network, as well as to maintain command and control (C2) over any\nimplants or tools. Examples include:\n\nThe [Sysinternals remote command execution utility PSExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)\n[Commercially available remote access tools such as TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/)\n[The PuTTY-related application Plink](https://documentation.help/PuTTY/plink-usage.html)\n[The commercially available (but frequently pirated or cracked) Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\n[The publicly available Custom Command and Control (C3) framework](https://labs.f-secure.com/tools/c3/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Network enumeration tools such as ADRecon and](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon) [BloodHound for mapping victim](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)\nActive Directory instances\nTunneling C2 traffic, including RDP, via [The Onion Router (TOR) to mask activity](https://www.torproject.org/)\n\nAdditionally, adversaries leverage built-in tools such as RDP and Server Message Block\n(SMB) connections to enable tool or capability deployment and lateral movement in victim\n[environments, combined with continuous credential harvesting via tools such as Mimikatz.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\n\nAt this stage, endpoint-related visibility becomes valuable in assessing an intrusion in many\ncases. However, even the best endpoint visibility on its own is insufficient to track, detect,\nand monitor elusive adversaries. This is especially the case for internal network movement.\nBy pairing network monitoring and visibility with robust network security monitoring,\ndefenders can ensure that all possible avenues for intruder operation are accounted for.\n\nLike the initial access vectors described in the previous section, the lateral movement and\nC2 mechanisms identified here are hardly unique to DarkSide deployment. Instead, these\ntechniques encompass behaviors also deployed by entities ranging from APTs to other,\ncriminal actors. By establishing monitoring for either external communication linked to the\ntools or techniques listed above, or examining internal communication flows for lateral\nmovement activity, defenders can identify malicious behaviors even when endpoint and\nsimilar visibility can be evaded.\n\n## Data Exfiltration\n\nOne other component to DarkSide-related operations, along with some other ransomware\nfamilies, is the use of “double extortion” to prompt payment. In addition to encrypting data,\nvictim information is stolen with threat of publication unless payment is made. Identifying\nlarge-scale data exfiltration in progress can be an indicator of imminent disruptive actions,\nand if caught in time may allow for defenders to respond quickly to prevent further harm.\nBased on [reporting from researchers at Red Canary on general trends in this space, as well](https://redcanary.com/blog/rclone-mega-extortion/)\nas specific observations on DarkSide, the following tools and techniques appear associated\nwith “double extortion” operations:\n\nUse of cross-platform, free tools such as [Rclone or](https://rclone.org/) [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)\n[Mega.io-focused tools such as MEGAcmd or](https://mega.io/) [MEGAsync](https://github.com/meganz/MEGAsync)\n\nAlthough not conclusively proven, media reporting indicates at least in the Colonial incident\n[the criminals leveraged cloud hosting infrastructure,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/cyber-sleuths-blunted-pipeline-hack-choked-data-flow-to-russia?sref=ylv224K8) [specifically from Digital Ocean, as an](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/10/colonial-pipeline-gas-oil-markets/)\nintermediary for data exfiltration as part of this process.\n\nThe above behaviors provide a variety of potential detection possibilities. Examples include\nsimple tracking of large, anomalous traffic flows indicative of large-scale data exfiltration to\nuse of specific service and destination combinations (such as WinSCP to an Autonomous\nSystem Number (ASN) associated with a cloud provider).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network Visibility and Monitoring\n\nThe mechanisms identified above are not distinct to DarkSide deployment; this provides a\nsubstantial benefit to defenders in that identifying general techniques associated with such\nintrusions will enable defensive coverage over a wide number of potential adversaries.\nMoreover, given the efforts by DarkSide-related entities (as well as numerous other threats)\nto evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions as part of fundamental tradecraft,\nbolstering host-centric visibility with robust network monitoring can enable organizations to\n[detect such operations at multiple phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)\n\nEstablishing network visibility and monitoring not only at the network edge but also for\ninternal network traffic can enable powerful defensive responses covering a variety of\nthreats. Looking at the behaviors identified in the previous sections, various defense and\nalerting mechanisms emerge from initial access through lateral movement and code\nexecution.\n\n## External Monitoring\n\nMonitoring external scanning or authentication brute force activity can be difficult given the\nsheer volume of activity from multiple services, malicious actors, and other entities. Yet being\nable to differentiate security-significant “signal” from background “noise” is critical in\narticulating meaningful, sustainable network defense.\n\nFor example, identifying exploit scanning activity, such as for the VPN vulnerability linked to\nDarkSide deployment above, may rapidly result in numerous alarms for various commercial\nor academic scanners attempting to identify vulnerable instances. Instead of attempting to\nchase every single potential vulnerability scan, defenders should seek higher-quality, lowervolume detections to ensure focused and efficient operations.\n\nBy viewing network security events not as atomic, discrete objects but as interrelated items\nlinked through time and execution, powerful possibilities emerge for detection and analysis.\nFor example, identifying linked activity such as a vulnerability scan of an external-facing\nservice (or an explicit attempt to exploit that service) followed by scanning or authentication\nactivity from that victim host to other, internal hosts within the network can flag likely initial\nintrusion actions and adversary attempts to expand access. By linking the discrete\nobservations into a complex, high-confidence analytic of malicious behavior, defenders can\nnot only ensure response to only high-severity, high-confidence events, but also alert on\ntradecraft linked to numerous threat actors.\n\n[Similar methodologies apply to credential stuffing, brute force, or guessing activity. Again, a](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing)\nvariety of scanners and other items will likely be engaged in such activity on a daily basis.\nBut identifying instances of dedicated scanning or brute forcing from a single source, or such\nactivity followed by anomalous network traffic from the recipient of such activity, can narrow\n\n\n-----\n\nobservations to likely compromise scenarios. Defenders can then vector resources and\nefforts appropriately to these events to initiate incident response operations, minimizing time\nto detection and time to recovery.\n\nOther possibilities exist related to specific services and protocols. For example, in DarkSide\noperations deploying parties tunnel RDP via TOR in order to mask operations. While evading\nattempts to identify external RDP connections, this still requires communication to TOR\nnodes. Tracking and identifying TOR nodes and related traffic can serve as a potentially\npowerful way to either enable more robust monitoring or, if blocked, reduce network attack\nsurface. Similarly, and as stated above, by identifying combinations of activity such as\nnetwork traffic flows indicative of large-scale data movement or exfiltration to untrusted or\n[unfamiliar network infrastructure or ASNs, key portions of the “double extortion” model can](https://blog.gigamon.com/2019/03/06/what-is-network-infrastructure/)\nbe flagged prior to completion.\n\n## Internal Network Communication\n\nNetwork monitoring and defense does not end at the perimeter; to deal with current threats\n(whether criminal actors or APTs) such visibility and response must extend to internal\nnetwork communications. By leveraging a visibility fabric or deploying dedicated sensors\ninside the perimeter to track host-to-host traffic and similar flows, defenders can gain\nvaluable visibility into adversary behavior that can identify intrusions in progress that\nboundary monitoring or EDR solutions otherwise miss.\n\nFor example, DarkSide deployment, along with multiple other actor behaviors, frequently\nuses credential theft followed by mapping a share over SMB for file transfer, then execution,\nvia a tool such as PSExec. Identifying the concrete behaviors behind this activity and\nestablishing alerts when these events are identified in sequence (authentication to host, SMB\nshare mapped to another host, followed by file transfer of an executable or scripting object to\nthe newly mapped host) can reveal instances of lateral movement. While it is possible such\nactions could identify legitimate system administrator activity, in well-orchestrated\nenvironments such instances can be rapidly dispositioned, while the existence of an analytic\nidentifying these linked network-specific events can flag actions related to a variety of threat\nactors.\n\nAdditional opportunities include monitoring of traffic flows and authentication activity, such as\nwhen an adversary deploys legitimate tools such as RDP. In these cases, identifying a\nnumber of attempted or successful authentication attempts from a single host to multiple\nhosts inside the network can indicate an adversary attempting to break out of an initial\nnetwork foothold. Further visibility, including being able to track precisely what credentials or\nuser accounts are used, can reveal compromised accounts and other valuable response\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall, the goal is to establish a combination of visibility into internal network traffic flows\nand combine this with an understanding of adversary tradecraft and operations to produce\nhigh-confidence alerting on observed activity. When paired with external network monitoring\nand endpoint defense, network defenders can severely impede adversary operations,\nensuring multiple potential detection points throughout the attacker’s lifecycle.\n\n## What Role Does Gigamon Play in Ransomware Defense?\n\n### Network Traffic Visibility and Network Detection and Response\n\nWhile SIEMs and EDRs have increased SOC and incident response (IR) team’s\neffectiveness in identifying active infections, visibility gaps to devices, networks, and traffic\nremain. The result is that analysts are left in the dark when trying to identify all adversary\n[activity described across the MITRE ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n### Gigamon Hawk Visibility and Analytics Fabric\n\nAt the heart of an effective security posture is visibility, which in this case means access to all\nnetwork traffic.
