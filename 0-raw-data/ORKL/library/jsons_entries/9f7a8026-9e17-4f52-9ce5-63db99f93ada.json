We don't know who is responsible and their goals,\" Nicola Zingaretti, the\nPresident of the Lazio region, said in a statement on Facebook.\n\n\"The attack blocked almost every file in the data center. The vaccination campaign\ncontinues as normal for all those who have booked. Vaccine bookings will open for now\nsuspended in the next few days. The system is currently shut down to allow internal\n\n\n-----\n\nverification and to avoid the spread of the virus introduced with the attack.\n\nWhile ransomware gangs are known to steal data during an attack as leverage in extortion\nattempts, the region states that health, financial, and budget data are safe.\n\nThe outage has also affected the Salute Lazio health portal used to register for COVID-19\nvaccines.\n\n\"There is a powerful hacking attack on regional ced. The systems are all disabled including\nall of the Salute Lazio portal and the vaccine network. All defense and verification\noperations are under way to avoid the misappropriation. Vaccination operations may\nexperience delays,\" the region said in a statement.\n\nIn June, Italy instituted a new 'Green Pass' certificate system that allows people to prove\nthat they have been vaccinated, tested negative, or previously had COVID-19.\n\nThis green pass will be required for indoor dining at restaurants and bars and be required to\naccess fitness centers, amusements parks, museums, and other locations with a large\ncrowd starting on August 6th.\n\nWith over 70% of the Lazio population vaccinated and a massive surge in registrations\nsince the announcement of the Green Pass policy, there is concern that the disruption to\nthe online COVID-19 vaccination\n\nHowever, the region states that there has been no disruption to existing appointments for\nvaccinations and that the online registration system should be back online in a few days.\n\n\"The vaccination campaign won't stop! In yesterday's day, 50 thousand vaccines were\nadministered, despite the biggest cyber attack suffered,\" the region stated on Facebook.\n\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n## Possible RansomEXX ransomware attack\n\nToday, sources have told BleepingComputer that the cyber attack on Lazio was conducted\nby a ransomware operation known as RansomEXX.\n\nIn a redacted ransom note shared from the attack on Lazio, the threat actors state, \"Hello,\nLazio!\" and warn the region that their files were encrypted. The ransom note also includes a\nlink to a private dark web page that Lazio can use to negotiate with the ransomware gang.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Alleged Lazio ransom note**\nThe ransom note does not state what operation conducted the attack but the ONION URL\nlisted is a known Tor site for the RansomEXX operation.\n\nBleepingComputer also received a screenshot of the negotiation page warning that the\nregion must pay a ransom to decrypt their files. The threat actors gave no ransom demand.\n\nRansomEXX negotiation pages are unique per victim, and if the threat actors stole data\nduring the attack, the threat actors provide details on the page, including the amount of data\nstolen and screenshots of files.\n\nIn this case, the negotiation page showed no indications that RansomEXX stole any data.\n\n**_Update:_** [After posting our article, Italian security researcher JAMESWT stated that there is](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1422652277467328517?s=19)\nevidence in Italy that the attack was conducted by LockBit 2.0 but could not share further\ninformation.\n\nBleepingComputer will update this article when more information becomes available.\n\n## Who is RansomEXX\n\nThe RansomEXX gang launched their operation originally under the name Defray in 2018.\n[However, in June 2020, the operation rebranded as RansomEXX where it began to target](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransom-x-ransomware-used-in-texas-txdot-cyberattack/)\nlarge corporate entities more actively.\n\nSimilar to other ransomware operations, RansomEXX will breach a network using\nvulnerabilities or stolen credentials.\n\nOnce the threat actors gain access to a network, they quietly spread through the network\nwhile stealing unencrypted files for extortion attempts.\n\nAfter gaining access to the Windows domain controller, they deploy the ransomware on the\nnetwork to encrypt all devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RansomEXX gang has a history of high-profile attacks, including Brazil s government\nnetworks, [the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT),](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-impacts-texas-department-of-transportation/) [Konica Minolta,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-technology-giant-konica-minolta-hit-by-new-ransomware/) [IPG Photonics,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-us-laser-developer-ipg-photonics-hit-with-ransomware/)\n[and Ecuador's CNT.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ecuadors-state-run-cnt-telco-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/)\n\n_Update 8/3/21: Added information about it possibly being LockBit 2.0._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Luxury fashion house Zegna confirms August ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/luxury-fashion-house-zegna-confirms-august-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[COVID-19](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/covid-19/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Italy](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/italy/)\n[Lazio](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/lazio/)\n[RansomEXX](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomexx/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
