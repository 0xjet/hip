The spear phishing emails and attached malicious macro\n\ndocuments typically have geopolitical themes. When successfully executed, the\n\nmalicious documents install a backdoor we track as POWERSTATS.\n\nOne of the more interesting observations during the analysis of these files was the re-use\n\nf th l t t A L k b d l t l t t h i f th f\n\n\n-----\n\n### p g\n\nIn this campaign, the threat actor’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) shifted\nafter about a month, as did their targets. A brief timeline of this activity is shown in\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of this recently observed spear phishing campaign\n\nThe first part of the campaign (From Jan. 23, 2018, to Feb. 26, 2018) used a macro-based\ndocument that dropped a VBS file and an INI file. The INI file contains the Base64\nencoded PowerShell command, which will be decoded and executed by PowerShell\n\nusing the command line generated by the VBS file on execution using WScript.exe. The\nprocess chain is shown in Figure 2\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Process chain for the first part of the campaign\n\nAlthough the actual VBS script changed from sample to sample, with different levels of\n\nobfuscation and different ways of invoking the next stage of process tree, its final\npurpose remained same: invoking PowerShell to decode the Base64 encoded\nPowerShell command in the INI file that was dropped earlier by the macro, and\nexecuting it. One such example of the VBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA is shown in\n\nFigure 3.\n\nFigure 3: VBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA\n\nThe second part of the campaign (from Feb. 27, 2018, to March 5, 2018) used a new\nvariant of the macro that does not use VBS for PowerShell code execution. Instead, it\nuses one of the recently disclosed code execution techniques leveraging INF and SCT\n\nfiles, which we will go on to explain later in the blog.\n\n### Infection Vector\n\nWe believe the infection vector for all of the attacks involved in this campaign are\nmacro-based documents sent as an email attachment. One such email that we were able\n\nto obtain was targeting users in Turkey, as shown in Figure 4:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Sample spear phishing email containing macro-based document attachment\n\nThe malicious Microsoft Office attachments that we observed appear to have been\nspecially crafted for individuals in four countries: Turkey, Pakistan, Tajikistan and India.\n\nWhat follows is four examples, and a complete list is available in the Indicators of\nCompromise section at the end of the blog.\n\nFigure 5 shows a document purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Document purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan\n\nA document purporting to be from the Turkish Armed Forces, with content written in the\nTurkish language, is shown in Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Document purporting to be from the Turkish Armed Forces\n\nA document purporting to be from the Institute for Development and Research in\nBanking Technology (established by the Reserve Bank of India) is shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Document purporting to be from the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology\n\nFigure 8 shows a document written in Tajik that purports to be from the Ministry of\nInternal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Document written in Tajik that purports to be from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of\n\nTajikistan\n\nEach of these macro-based documents used similar techniques for code execution,\npersistence and communication with the command and control (C2) server.\n\n### Indirect Code Execution Through INF and SCT\n\n[This scriptlet code execution technique leveraging INF and SCT files was recently](https://bohops.com/2018/02/26/leveraging-inf-sct-fetch-execute-techniques-for-bypass-evasion-persistence/)\ndiscovered and documented in February 2018. The threat group in this recently observed\n\ncampaign – TEMP.Zagros – weaponized their malware using the following techniques.\n\nThe macro in the Word document drops three files in a hard coded path:\n\nC:\\programdata. Since the path is hard coded, the execution will only be observed in\n\nti t Wi d 7 d b Th f ll i th th fil\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter dropping the three files, the macro will set the following registry key to achieve\npersistence:\n\n\\REGISTRY\\USER\\SID\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersio\nn\\Run\\\"WindowsDefenderUpdater\" = cmstp.exe /s\n\nc:\\programdata\\DefenderService.inf\n\nUpon system restart, cmstp.exe will be used to execute the SCT file indirectly through\n\nthe INF file. This is possible because inside the INF file we have the following section:\n\n[UnRegisterOCXSection]\n%11%\\scrobj.dll,NI,c:/programdata/Defender.sct\n\nThat section gets indirectly invoked through the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF,\nas shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9: Indirectly invoking SCT through the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF\n\nThis method of code execution is performed in an attempt to evade security products.\n\nFireEye MVX and HX Endpoint Security technology successfully detect this code\n\n\n-----\n\np\n\nperformed by the SCT file is to Base64 decode the contents of WindowsDefender.ini file\nand execute the decoded PowerShell Script using the following command line:\n\npowershell.exe -exec Bypass -c\n\niex([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((getcontent C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsDefender.ini)\n\nThe rest of the malicious activities are performed by the PowerShell Script.\n\n### PowerShell File Analysis\n\nThe PowerShell script employs several layers of obfuscation to hide its actual\n\nfunctionality. In addition to obfuscation techniques, it also has the ability to detect\nsecurity tools on the analysis machine, and can also shut down the system if it detects the\n\npresence of such tools.\n\nSome of the key obfuscation techniques used are:\n\nCharacter Replacement: Several instances of character replacement and string\n\nreversing techniques (Figure 10) make analysis difficult.\n\nFigure 10: Character replacement and string reversing techniques\n\nPowerShell Environment Variables: Nowadays, malware authors commonly mask\n\ncritical strings such as “IEX” using environment variables. Some of the instances used\n\nin this script are:\n\n$eNv:puBLic[13]+$ENv:pUBLIc[5]+'x'\n\n($ENV:cOMsPEC[4,26,25]-jOin'')\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: PowerShell script is XOR encoded using a single byte key\n\nAfter deobfuscating the contents of the PowerShell Script, we can divide it into three\n\nsections.\n\n#### Section 1\n\nThe first section of the PowerShell script is responsible for setting different key variables\n\nthat are used by the remaining sections of the PowerShell script, especially the following\nvariables:\n\nTEMpPAtH = \"C:\\ProgramData\\\" (the path used for storing the temp files)\n\n[Get_vAlIdIP = https://api.ipify.org/ (used to get the public IP address of the](https://api.ipify.org/)\nmachine)\n\nFIlENAmePATHP = WindowsDefender.ini (file used to store Powershell code)\n\nPRIVAtE = Private Key exponents\nPUbLIc = Public Key exponents\n\nHklm = \"HKLM:\\Software\\\"\nHkcu = \"HKCU:\\Software\\\"\n\nValuE = \"kaspersky\"\nSYSID\n\nDrAGon_MidDLe = [array of proxy URLs]\n\nAmong those variables, there is one variable of particular interest, DrAGon_MidDLe,\n\nwhich stores the list of proxy URLs (detailed at the end of the blog in the Network\nIndicators portion of the Indicators of Compromise section) that will be used to interact\n\nwith the C2 server, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: DrAGon_MidDLe stores the list of proxy URLs used to interact with C2 server\n\n#### Section 2\n\nThe second section of the PowerShell script has the ability to perform encryption and\n\ndecryption of messages that are exchanged between the system and the C2 server. The\nalgorithm used for encryption and decryption is RSA, which leverages the public and\n\nprivate key exponents included in Section 1 of the PowerShell script.\n\n#### Section 3\n\nThe third section of the PowerShell script is the biggest section and has a wide variety of\n\nfunctionalities.\n\nDuring analysis, we observed a code section where a message written in Chinese and\n\nhard coded in the script will be printed in the case of an error while connecting to the C2\nserver:\n\n\n-----\n\nOther functionalities provided by this section of the PowerShell Script are as follows:\n\nRetrieves the following data from the system by leveraging Windows Management\n\nInstrumentation (WMI) queries and environment variables:\n\nIP Address from Network Adapter Configuration\nOS Name\n\nOS Architecture\nComputer Name\n\nComputer Domain Name\nUsername\n\nAll of this data is concatenated and formatted as shown in Figure 13:\n\nFigure 13: Concatenated and formatted data retrieved by PowerShell script\n\nRegister the victim’s machine to the C2 server by sending the REGISTER command\nto the server. In response, if the status is OK, then a TOKEN is received from the C2\n\nserver that is used to synchronize the activities between the victim’s machine and the\nC2 server.\n\nWhile sending to the C2 server, the data is formatted as follows:\n\n@{SYSINFO = $get.ToString(); ACTION = \"REGISTER\";}\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14.\n\nFigure 14: System shut down upon discovery of security tools\n\nAbility to receive PowerShell script from the C2 server and execute on the machine.\nSeveral techniques are employed for executing the PowerShell code:\n\nIf command starts with “excel”, then it leverages DDEInitiate Method of\nExcel.Appilcation to execute the code:\n\nIf the command starts with “outlook”, then it leverages Outlook.Application and\nMSHTA to execute the code:\n\nIf the command starts with “risk”, then execution is performed through DCOM\nobject:\n\n\n-----\n\nFile upload functionality.\n\nAbility to disable Microsoft Office Protected View (as shown in Figure 15) by setting\nthe following keys in the Windows Registry:\n\nDisableAttachmentsInPV\nDisableInternetFilesInPV\n\nDisableUnsafeLocationsInPV\n\nFigure 15: Disabling Microsoft Office Protected View\n\nAbility to remotely reboot or shut down or clean the system based on the\n\ncommand received from the C2 server, as shown in Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbility to sleep for a given number of seconds.\n\nThe following table summarizes the main C2 commands supported by this PowerShell\n\nScript.\n\nC2 Command Purpose\n\nReboot the system using shutdown\nreboot\n\ncommand\n\nShut down the system using shutdown\nshutdown\n\ncommand\n\nclean Wipe the Drives, C:\\, D:\\, E:\\, F:\\\n\nscreenshot Take a screenshot of the System\n\nEncrypt and upload the information\nupload\n\nfrom the system\n\nLeverage Excel.Application COM object\nexcel\nfor code execution\n\nLeverage Outlook.Application COM\noutlook\n\nobject for code execution\n\nLeverage DCOM object for code\nrisk\n\nexecution\n\n|C2 Command|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|reboot|Reboot the system using shutdown command|\n|shutdown|Shut down the system using shutdown command|\n|clean|Wipe the Drives, C:\\, D:\\, E:\\, F:\\|\n|screenshot|Take a screenshot of the System|\n|upload|Encrypt and upload the information from the system|\n|excel|Leverage Excel.Application COM object for code execution|\n|outlook|Leverage Outlook.Application COM object for code execution|\n\n\n-----\n\nThis activity shows us that TEMP.Zagros stays up-to-date with the latest code execution\n\nand persistence mechanism techniques, and that they can quickly leverage these\ntechniques to update their malware. By combining multiple layers of obfuscation, they\n\ndeter the process of reverse engineering and also attempt to evade security products.\n\nUsers can protect themselves from such attacks by disabling Office macros in their\n\nsettings and also by being more vigilant when enabling macros (especially when\nprompted) in documents, even if such documents are from seemingly trusted sources.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n#### Macro based Documents and Hashes\n\nTargeted\nSHA256 Hash
