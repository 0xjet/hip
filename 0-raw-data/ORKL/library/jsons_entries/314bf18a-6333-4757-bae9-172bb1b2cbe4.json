These telecommunications providers have been expanding in size, to the\npoint where In the past thirteen years, mobile cellular phone subscribers have quadrupled in size\nand sit at 8 billion subscribers today. Due to their wide availability and the fundamental service\nthey bring, telecommunications providers have become critical infrastructure for the majority of\nworld powers.\n\nAsk the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar.\n\n**_[Sign up for the Operation Soft Cell webinar.](https://www.cybereason.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=fb289886-7740-4dec-b007-2289ce65cef0&placement_guid=5d884927-a051-4ae7-b129-94438da0638b&portal_id=3354902&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cybereason.com%2Fblog%2Foperation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers&redirect_url=APefjpEwQDVM4INBzyFax0ctrJOW4vsTSVNKOq0EvraYzmjq3BQzwkCtJvaiinpVNLskGQXAPIJKUCySFCjCtqJTLXDL5yRhvwQon7VXAG2xehQ7wmzbjV7jmYnfHzc-y0fqL2UQiranhBduuo6B-0LlVyEOs5rXTg&click=a59886c6-404e-4e4e-9fa4-700aae9d598d&hsutk=8434d4a869f62212e2d581efdbf8a098&signature=AAH58kHFc0YfXQCdKJI6DapzoPBcUMbuFA&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FBO8AdJEI6k%3Famp%3D1&pageId=10686000168&__hstc=85683782.8434d4a869f62212e2d581efdbf8a098.1568171003221.1568171003221.1568171003221.1&__hssc=85683782.1.1568171003221&__hsfp=2579206198&contentType=blog-post)_**\n\nMuch like telecommunication providers, many other critical infrastructure organizations provide a\n[valuable targets for nation state threat actors, due to their high impact. In studies, nearly a quarter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samcurry/2019/04/16/cyber-sights-on-critical-infrastructure/#3649ad487729)\nof critical infrastructure organizations reported they had been hit by nation state attacks and 60%\nsaid disruptive cyber attacks are among the threats they are most worried about.\n\nThreat actors, especially those at the level of nation state, are seeking opportunities to attack\n[these organizations, conducting elaborate, advanced operations to gain leverage, seize strategic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-kpn/dutch-emergency-services-hit-by-major-telecoms-outage-idUSKCN1TP1V8)\nassets, and collect information. When successful, these attacks often have huge implications.\n\nLast year, we identified a threat actor that has been operating in telecommunications provider\n[environments for at least two years. We performed a post-incident review of the attacks and were](https://www.cybereason.com/resources/post-incident-review)\nable to identify changes in the attack patterns along with new activity every quarter.\n\nThe threat actor mainly sought to obtain CDR data (call logs, cell tower locations, etc.) belonging\nto specific individuals from various countries. This type of targeted cyber espionage is usually the\nwork of nation state threat actors.\n\nWe’ve concluded with a high level of certainty that the threat actor is affiliated with China and is\nlikely state sponsored. The tools and techniques used throughout these attacks are consistent\n[with several Chinese threat actors, such as APT10, a threat actor believed to operate on behalf of](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\nthe Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).\n\n\n-----\n\n_The threat actor changed activity every quarter._\n\nThe attack began with a web shell running on a vulnerable, publicly-facing server, from which the\nattackers gathered information about the network and propagated across the network. The threat\nactor attempted to compromise critical assets, such as database servers, billing servers, and the\nactive directory. As malicious activity was detected and remediated against, the threat actor\nstopped the attack.\n\nThe second wave of the attack hit several months later with similar infiltration attempts, along with\na modified version of the web shell and reconnaissance activities. A game of cat and mouse\nbetween the threat actor and the defenders began, as they ceased and resumed their attack 2\nmore times in the span of a 4 month period.\n\n## Anatomy of the Attack\n\n### Initial Compromise: the Modified China Chopper Web Shell\n\nThe initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an IIS server,\ncoming out of the w3wp.exe process. An investigation of the web shell, later classified as a\n[modified version of the China Chopper web shell, uncovered several attack phases and TTPs.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\nThe threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands, steal\ncredentials, and deploy other tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious web shell activity as observed in the Cybereason solution._\n\n_Commands executed via a modified version of the China Chopper web shell._\n\nChina Chopper is a web shell first discovered in 2012 that is commonly used by malicious\nChinese actors. It is used to remotely control web servers, and has been used in many attacks\n[against Australian web hosting providers. The web shell parameters in this attack match to the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australian-web-hosts-hit-with-a-manic-menagerie-of-malware/)\n[China Chopper parameters, as described in FireEye’s analysis of China Chopper. This tool has](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii.html)\nbeen used by several Chinese-affiliated threat actors, such as APT 27 and APT 40. It is important\nto note that this tool is widely available and can be used by other threat actors.\n\n### Reconnaissance and Credential Stealing\n\nThe threat actor launched a series of reconnaissance commands to try to obtain and enumerate\ninformation about the compromised machine, network architecture, users, and active directory\nenumeration.\n\n_Example 1: Reconnaissance Commands_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example 2: Reconnaissance Commands_\n\n#### Modified “nbtscan”\n\n[One of the reconnaissance commands was to run a modified nbtscan tool (\"NetBIOS nameserver](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\n[scanner\") to identify available NetBIOS name servers locally or over the network. Nbtscan has](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\n[been used by APT10 in Operation Cloud Hopper to search for services of interest across the IT](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-annex-b-final.pdf)\nestate and footprint endpoints of interest. It is also capable of identifying system information.\n\n_NetBIOS Scanner execution as seen in the Cybereason solution._\n\n_NetBIOS scanner is set to scan an internal IP range._\n\n#### Modified Mimikatz\n\nFollowing the reconnaissance phase, the threat actor attempted to dump credentials stored on\nthe compromised machines. The most common credential stealing tool used by the threat actor\n[was a modified mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes. This version of mimikatz did not require any](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\ncommand line arguments, most likely in an attempt to avoid detection based on command-line\n\n\n-----\n\n_Modified Mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes._\n\nReverse engineering shows the similarity between maybemimi.exe and mimikatz.\n\n_[Mimikatz code from GitHub.](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)_\n\n_maybemimi strings._\n\n#### Dumping the SAM Hive from the Registry\n\nIn order to obtain credentials, the threat actor used another technique that can be seen in the\n[below screenshots. They dumped specific hives from the Windows Registry, such as the SAM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/sysinfo/registry-hives)\nhive, which contains password hashes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Command-line arguments indicate SAM hive dumping._\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nOnce the threat actor mapped the network and obtained credentials (through net use), they\nbegan to move laterally. They were able to compromise critical assets including production\nservers and database servers, and they even managed to gain full control of the Domain\n[Controller. The threat actor relied on WMI and PsExec to move laterally and install their tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\nacross multiple assets.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how the threat actor moved laterally from the first machine,\n[compromised by the modified version of the China Chopper web shell, to other machines inside](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\nthe network.\n\n_/c cd /d \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\ecp\\auth\\\"&wmic_\n_/node:[REDACTED] /user:\"[REDACTED]\" /password:\"[REDACTED]\" process call create_\n_a.bat&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]_\n\n_WMI command used by the threat actor to move laterally._\n\n### Maintaining a Long-term Foothold and Stealing Data\n\nThe threat actor abused the stolen credentials to create rogue, high-privileged domain user\naccounts which they then used to take malicious action. By creating these accounts, they ensured\nthey would maintain access between different waves of the attack. Once the threat actor regains\ntheir foothold they already have access to a high-privileged domain user account This\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PoisonIvy\n\nA second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets was\n[through the deployment of the PoisonIvy RAT (PIVY). This infamous RAT has been associated](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0012/)\n[with many different Chinese threat actors, including APT10, APT1, and DragonOK. It is a](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0006/)\npowerful, multi-featured RAT that lets a threat actor take total control over a machine. Among its\nmost notable features are:\n\nRegistry Editor\nScreenshot Grabber\nCredential Stealer\nInteractive Shell\nFile Manager with Upload and Download Support\nProcess Monitor\nKeylogging and Various other Surveillance Features\n\n_The control panel for PoisonIvy._\n\n_[Courtesy of Sam Bowne - samsclass.info](https://samsclass.info/)_\n\nWe assume the threat actor used PoisonIvy for keylogging and other surveillance features, as\nthey had that functionality available to them as shown in the screenshot above.\n\n[The strain of PIVY in this attack used a DLL side-loading technique to stealthily load itself into](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073/)\nmemory. To accomplish this, it exploited a trusted and signed application. The PIVY payload was\ndropped along with the trusted and signed Samsung tool (RunHelp.exe) in the following manner:\n\n[1. A nullsoft installer package (NSIS) was created with a legitimate, signed Samsung tool in it.](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page)\n2. Once executed, the installer script within the NSIS package extracted the Samsung tool\n\nand added a fake DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), which is\nrequired by the application\n\n\n-----\n\n5. It was able to achieve persistence by creating a rogue scheduled task.\n\n_Post-persistence execution of PIVY, side-loaded into a legitimate Samsung application._\n\nPIVY’s use of DLL side-loading to abuse Samsung tools is not new, and has been reported\n[previously by Palo Alto. In 2016 it was used to attack pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong, most](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)\nprobably by Chinese threat actors.\n\n⚠ Note: Our team has reached out to and advised the targeted organizations on active\n**containment actions.**\n\n#### Secondary Web Shells\n\nIn later stages of the attack, the threat actor deployed two other custom-built web shells. From\nthese web shells, they launched reconnaissance commands, stole data, and dropped additional\n[tools including portqry.exe, renamed cmd.exe, winrar, and the notorious hTran.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/310099/description-of-the-portqry-exe-command-line-utility)\n\n_Reconnaissance and lateral movement commands launched from the secondary web shell._\n\n### Data Exfiltration\n\nThe threat actor exfiltrated stolen data using multiple different channels including web shells and\nhTran.\n\n#### Compressing the Stolen Data\n\n[In an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data, the threat actor used winrar to compress and](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)\npassword-protect it. The winrar binaries and compressed data were found mostly in the Recycle\n[Bin folder, a TTP that was previously observed in APT10-related attacks, as well as others. This](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-report-final-v4.pdf)\nthreat actor is known to stage the data in multi-part archives before exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\nrar.exe a -k -r -s -m1 -[password] [REDACTED].rar [REDACTED].csv\nrar a -r -[password] [REDACTED].rar sam system ntds.dit\n\n_Compressed stolen data exfiltrated via web shell._\n\nThe contents of the compressed data was crucial in understanding the threat actor’s motivation\nfor the attack, as well as what type of information they were after.\n\n#### hTran\n\nIn order to exfiltrate data from a network segment not connected to the Internet, the threat actor\n[deployed a modified version of hTran. This ‘connection bouncer’ tool lets the threat actor redirect](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040/)\n[ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate C2 server traffic. There have](https://github.com/HiwinCN/HTran)\n[been numerous reports of hTran being used by different Chinese threat actors, including: APT3,](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022/)\n[APT27 and DragonOK.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\n\n[The threat actor made some modifications to the original source code of hTran. Many strings,](https://github.com/HiwinCN/HTran)\nincluding the debug messages, were intentionally changed and obfuscated in an attempt to evade\ndetection and thwart efforts to identify the malware by antivirus and researchers.\n\n_Obfuscated debug messages._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Identifying modifications in a disassembly of the modified hTran._\n\nprintf is being called (dubbed by us as “looks_like_printf”) with output “C e.”. By looking at the\noriginal source code, we were able to identify that this is supposed to be “Connect error”.\n\n_A section of the source code for hTran._\n\n## Understanding the Motive\n\nWhen you think of large breaches to big organizations, the first thing that comes to mind is usually\npayment data. An organization that provides services to a large customer base has a lot of credit\ncard data, bank account information, and more personal data on its systems. These attacks are\nusually conducted by a cybercrime group looking to make money.\n\nIn contrast, when a nation state threat actor is attacking a big organization, the end goal is\ntypically not financial, but rather intellectual property or sensitive information about their clients.\n\nOne of the most valuable pieces of data that telecommunications providers hold is Call Detail\nRecords (CDRs). CDRs are a large subset of metadata that contains all details about calls,\nincluding:\n\nSource, Destination, and Duration of a Call\nDevice Details\nPhysical Location\nDe ice Vendor and Version\n\n\n-----\n\nWho are the individuals talking to?\nWhich devices are the individuals using?\nWhere are the individuals traveling?\n\nHaving this information becomes particularly valuable when nation-state threat actors are\ntargeting foreign intelligence agents, politicians, opposition candidates in an election, or even law\nenforcement.\n\n_Example 1: CDR Data_\n\n\n-----\n\nExample 3: CDR Data\n\nBeyond targeting individual users, this attack is also alarming because of the threat posed by the\ncontrol of a telecommunications provider. Telecommunications has become critical infrastructure\nfor the majority of world powers. A threat actor with total access to a telecommunications provider,\nas is the case here, can attack however they want passively and also actively work to sabotage\nthe network.\n\nThis attack has widespread implications, not just for individuals, but also for organizations and\ncountries alike. The use of specific tools and the choice to hide ongoing operations for years\npoints to a nation state threat actor, most likely China. This is another form of cyber warfare being\nused to establish a foothold and gather information undercover until they are ready to strike.\n\n[Want to learn about post-incident review?

This work enabled us to not only reconstruct these\nattacks, but also to find additional artifacts and information regarding the threat actor and its\noperations.\n\n### Methodology\n\n#### Step 1: Creating and Maintaining an IOC Inventory\n\nThe first step in this process was to create a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) observed throughout the different stages of the attack. This list included various indicators,\n\nh fil h h d i IP dd fil d i t / i I dditi t\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list of IOCs was periodically updated and fed back into our threat intel engine as more were\ndiscovered.\n\n#### Step 2: Hunting for Known Evil\n\nEquipped with an ever-growing list of known IOCs, our team set out to hunt for “low-hanging fruit”\nacross multiple environments. This step was done by using both internal sources, such as the\nCybereason solution, as well as hunting for indicators in the wild.\n\nThe hunt for “known evil” yielded interesting results that helped uncover additional compromised\nassets as well as more parts of the attack infrastructure.\n\n#### Step 3: Threat Actor’s Arsenal\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting steps involved identifying and analyzing the tools the threat\nactor used throughout the attack. The combination of the preference of tools, sequence of use,\nand specifically how they are used during the attack says a lot about a threat actor, especially\nwhen it comes to attribution.\n\nOne of the more notable aspects was how the threat actor used mostly known tools that were\ncustomized for this specific attack. Each tool was customized differently, and included re-writing\nthe code, stripping debug symbols, string obfuscation, and embedding the victim’s specific\ninformation within the tools’ configuration.\n\nHowever, the threat actor also used tools we were not able to attribute to any known tool. These\ntools were used in the later stages of the attack, once the operation was already discovered. This\nwas most likely to decrease the risk of exposure or attribution.\n\nFinally, the payloads were almost never repeated. The threat actor made sure that each payload\nhad a unique hash, and some payloads were packed using different types of packers, both known\nand custom.\n\nThe main tools these attacks had in common are:\n\n1. Web Shells\n\n[A modified version of the China Chopper web shell was used for initial compromise.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\nCustom-built web shells were used for later phases of the attack.\n2. Reconnaissance Tools\n\n[A modified version of Nbtscan was used to identify available NetBIOS name servers](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\nlocally or over the network.\nMultiple Windows built-in tools were used for various tasks, including whoami,\n[net.exe, ipconfig, netstat, portqry, and more.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039/)\n[WMI and PowerShell commands were used for various tasks.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n3. RAT\n\n[PoisonIvy was used to maintain access across the compromised assets.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0012/)\n[PlugX was used in some of the instances that we're aware of.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\n4. Credential Dumpers\n\n[A modified version of Mimikatz was used to dump credentials stored on the](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)\ncompromised machines.\nA PowerShell-based Mimikatz was also used to dump credentials stored on the\n\n\n-----\n\n[PsExec was also used for lateral movement.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029/)\n6. Connection Proxy\n\n[A modified version of hTran was used to exfiltrate stolen data.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040/)\n7. Compression tool\n\n[Winrar was used to compress and password-protect stolen data.](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)\n\n#### Step 4: Creating a TTP-based Behavioral Profile\n\n[One of the key components of threat hunting is to create a TTP-based behavioral profile of the](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/how-to-generate-a-hypothesis-for-a-threat-hunt-techniques)\nthreat actor in question. Malware payloads and operational infrastructure can be quickly changed\nor replaced over time, and as such, the task of tracking a threat actor can become quite difficult.\n\nFor that reason, it is crucial to profile the threat actor and study its behavior, the tools it uses, and\nits techniques. These behavioral-based TTPs are less likely to change drastically, and are\\ key\nfactors of any threat hunt or attribution efforts.\n\n[The Cybereason solution is compatible with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which made it easy](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/mitre-attck-evaluation-results)\nto keep track of the observed TTPs and correlate the data with known threat actors.\n\nThe following chart reflects the behavioral profile of the threat actor based on the most frequently\nobserved techniques used throughout these attacks.\n\n##### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Breakdown\n\n**Initial Access** **Execution** **Persis‐** **Privilege** **Defense** **Creden‐**\n**tence** **Escala‐** **Evasion** **tial**\n\n**tion** **Access**\n\nExploit Public- [Command-line](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) [Web](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1100/) [Valid](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/) [DLL-side](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073/) [Credential](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\nFacing interface Shell Accounts Loading Dumping\nApplication\n\n[Windows Manage‐](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/) Create [Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1100/) [Indicator Re‐](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1066/)\nment Instrumentation [Ac‐](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/) moval from Tools\n\ncount\n\n[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/) [Obfuscated Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)\nor Information\n\n[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/)\n\n**Discovery** **Lateral** **Collection** **Command and** **Exfil‐** **Im‐**\n**Movement** **Control** **tration** **pact**\n\n[System Network Configu‐](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/) [Data From Lo‐](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/) [Remote](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/) Data\nration Discovery cal System File Copy Compressed\n\n[Permission Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/)\nDiscovery\n\n#### Step 5: Mapping out the Infrastructure and Operational Activity\n\n##### Reconstructing the Infrastructure\n\n|Initial Access|Execution|Persis‐ tence|Privilege Escala‐ tion|Defense Evasion|Creden‐ tial Access|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Exploit Public- Facing Application|Command-line interface|Web Shell|Valid Accounts|DLL-side Loading|Credential Dumping|\n||Windows Manage‐ ment Instrumentation|Create Ac‐ count|Web Shell|Indicator Re‐ moval from Tools||\n||PowerShell|||Obfuscated Files or Information||\n|||||Masquerading||\n\n|Discovery|Lateral Movement|Collection|Command and Control|Exfil‐ tration|Im‐ pact|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|System Network Configu‐ ration Discovery|Data From Lo‐ cal System|Remote File Copy|Data Compressed|||\n|Permission Groups Discovery||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n⚠ Note: Since we cannot share any IOCs, we will refer to file hashes, hostnames, IP\n**addresses and other IOCs as generic placeholders.**\n\nHostname1 is the hostname that was used for the C2 server targeting the telecommunications\nproviders.\n\n_Hostname1 connected to multiple tools._\n\nIn analyzing the files, it is clear they are all contacting the same host hostname1. hostname1 was\nthe C2 server that the malware and web shells connected to.\n\nOnce we determined the hashes in the scope of the attack were only connecting to hostname1,\nwhich is a dynamic DNS hostname, we looked to see if we could find more information about the\nC2 server.\n\nA simple WHOIS query revealed that the IP address was registered to a colocation hosting\n**company in Asia, though there was no other publicly available information about this IP address.**\n\nBy querying all of our threat intel resources about this IP address, we discovered that it was\nassociated with multiple dynamic DNS hostnames.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Multiple dynamic DNS hostnames._\n\nWe were unable to find indications of connections to Dynamic.DNS2 and Dynamic.DNS3.\nHowever, they were registered and associated with IP.Address1.\n\nFor the other dynamic DNS hosts, we leveraged various threat intel repositories and crafted\nqueries that searched for executables with these IP addresses and hostnames in their string\ntable. One of the queries returned a few DLLs with identical names to the DLL we had initially\ninvestigated. However, the hashes were different. After obtaining the found DLLs, we patched\nthem back into the NSIS installer and detonated the samples in our testing environment. Dynamic\nanalysis of the newly obtained DLLs revealed a new set of domains and IP addresses that were\ncompletely different. These domains were actually related to different telecommunications\nproviders.\n\n⚠ Note: Cybereason immediately reached out to those telecommunications providers and\n**provided them all of the necessary information to handle the incident internally.**\n\n_Strings from the dumped memory section of the injected shellcode. We can see many details_\n_about the attack including domains and C2 server IP addresses._\n\n_Shellcode being unpacked and injected into a remote process. The redacted segments contain_\n_the name of the customer, C2 IP addresses, and domains._\n\n##### Infrastructure Operational Security\n\n\n-----\n\n_The threat actor’s infrastructure._\n\nThe threat actor had a specific pattern of behavior that allowed us to understand their modus\noperandi: they used one server with the same IP address for multiple operations. This server is a\nkey component in their ‘non-attributable’ infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is cheap and efficient for the threat actor, but is almost transparent for a seasoned\nresearcher with access to the right threat intelligence tools. There are previous reports of threat\nactors including APT10 and APT1 using dynamic DNS.\n\nMonitoring this infrastructure gave us information about if and when the threat actor was starting\nnew waves of the attack or additional attacks on other providers.\n\nWhen researching C2 servers, it is important to watch for:\n\nAssociation with domains, especially if they are dynamic DNS domains.\nFile hashes that are associated with the IP address or the domain of the C2 server.\n\nStatic information and metadata from associated samples that could be used to\nbroaden the search after additional information is gathered.\n\nThis demonstrates the importance of proper operational security and a separation between tools\nand operations for threat actors.\n\n### Step 6: Rounding Up Immediate/Potential Suspects\n\n[Attribution is a fickle and delicate art. In most cases, it is very difficult to achieve 100% certainty](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samcurry/2019/04/23/attribution-know-thy-place-blurred-cyber-lines/)\nwhen attributing an attack to a specific threat actor. It can be tempting to attribute an attack to a\ncertain threat actor whenever certain tools-of-the-trade, IP addresses, strings, or “indicative”\ntechniques are observed.\n\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind that the aforementioned data points are often prone to\nmanipulation and reuse across different threat actors. Further, they are not impervious to\npsychological warfare, as in, trying to “pin” an operation on a different threat actor to avoid proper\nattribution.\n\nIn order to increase the certainty level when attributing to a specific threat actor, we took the\nfollowing aspects of the attacks into consideration:\n\nIndicators of Compromise\nTTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures)\nThreat actor's tools\nMotive behind the attacks\nRegional and industry considerations\n\nCarefully examining each of the different aspects plays an important role in avoiding\nmisattribution. This model offers a more balanced interpretation of the data that is based on a\nmyriad of components. By performing a contextualized review of the data, you are able to yield a\nmore wholesome result with greater certainty.\n\nWhen it comes to attributing Operation Soft Cell, we are unable to achieve 100% certainty with\nregard to the identity of the threat actor. However, based on our interpretation of the data, we\nconclude with a high level of certainty that:\n\nThe threat actor behind Operation Soft Cell is likely state-sponsored.\nThe threat actor is affiliated with China.\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving found multiple similarities to previous attacks, it is our estimation that the threat actor\n[behind these attacks is likely linked to APT10, or at the very least, to a threat actor that shares](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\ntools, techniques, motive and infrastructural preferences with those of APT10.\n\nWhile we cannot completely rule out a “copy-cat” scenario, where another threat actor might\nmasquerade as APT10 to thwart attribution efforts, we find this option to be less likely in light of\nour analysis of the data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog, we have described an ongoing global attack against telecommunications providers\nthat has been active since at least 2017. The threat actor managed to infiltrate into the deepest\nsegments of the providers’ network, including some isolated from the internet, as well as\ncompromise critical assets. Our investigation showed that these attacks were targeted, and that\nthe threat actor sought to steal communications data of specific individuals in various countries.\n\nThroughout this investigation, we have uncovered the infrastructure that facilitated the malicious\noperations taken by this threat actor. The data exfiltrated by this threat actor, in conjunction with\nthe TTPs and tools used, allowed us to determine with a very high probability that the threat\nactor behind these malicious operations is backed by a nation state, and is affiliated with China.\nOur contextualized interpretation of the data suggests that the threat actor is likely APT10, or at\nthe very least, a threat actor that shares, or wishes to emulate its methods by using the same\ntools, techniques, and motives.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that even though the attacks targeted specific individuals, any entity\nthat possesses the power to take over the networks of telecommunications providers can\npotentially leverage its unlawful access and control of the network to shut down or disrupt an\nentire cellular network as part of a larger cyber warfare operation.\n\nDue to multiple and various limitations, we cannot disclose all the information we have gathered\non the attack in this report. Our team will continue to monitor and track the threat actor’s activity in\norder to identify more tools and compromised organizations.\n\nAsk the researchers questions about this attack during their live webinar.\n\n**_[Sign up for the Operation Soft Cell webinar.](https://www.cybereason.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=fb289886-7740-4dec-b007-2289ce65cef0&placement_guid=5d884927-a051-4ae7-b129-94438da0638b&portal_id=3354902&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cybereason.com%2Fblog%2Foperation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers&redirect_url=APefjpEwQDVM4INBzyFax0ctrJOW4vsTSVNKOq0EvraYzmjq3BQzwkCtJvaiinpVNLskGQXAPIJKUCySFCjCtqJTLXDL5yRhvwQon7VXAG2xehQ7wmzbjV7jmYnfHzc-y0fqL2UQiranhBduuo6B-0LlVyEOs5rXTg&click=a59886c6-404e-4e4e-9fa4-700aae9d598d&hsutk=8434d4a869f62212e2d581efdbf8a098&signature=AAH58kHFc0YfXQCdKJI6DapzoPBcUMbuFA&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FBO8AdJEI6k%3Famp%3D1&pageId=10686000168&__hstc=85683782.8434d4a869f62212e2d581efdbf8a098.1568171003221.1568171003221.1568171003221.1&__hssc=85683782.1.1568171003221&__hsfp=2579206198&contentType=blog-post)_**\n\n**Closing Notes: This research, which is still ongoing, has been a huge effort for the entire**\n**Cybereason Nocturnus team.
