(安洵信息技术有限公司; also known as i-SOON), a\nChina-based cybersecurity and information technology company that almost certainly conducts\noffensive cyber-espionage operations for Chinese government clients. The leak offers an\nunprecedented glimpse inside the inner workings of China’s cyber-espionage ecosystem and\nrepresents the most significant leak of data linked to a company suspected of providing targeted\nintrusion services for Chinese security services.\n\nBy correlating historical tracking of Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups and the leaked\nmaterial, Insikt Group identified strong infrastructure, tooling, victimology, and personnel overlap\nbetween i-SOON and multiple tracked Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups that likely\noperate as subgroups under i-SOON: RedAlpha, RedHotel, and POISON CARP. The leaked material1 2\n\ncorroborates our previous [assessment](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redhotel-a-prolific-chinese-state-sponsored-group-operating-at-a-global-scale) that RedHotel is one of the most prominent, active, Chinese\nstate-sponsored threat activity groups based on the group’s consistently high operational tempo and\n[global targeting remit. The leak also further supports hypotheses](https://www.recordedfuture.com/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power) that Chinese state-sponsored groups\nare supported by “digital quartermasters” that enable the sharing of custom capabilities under\ncommercial arrangements.\n\nIn addition to gaining an understanding of the inner workings of cyber-espionage operations, network\ndefenders can apply victimology intelligence gained from the leak to improve internal threat models.\nThis information, often obscured from public view, can allow for a more thorough understanding as to\nwhy specific commercial, communication, or other data may be targeted and how it can be used for\nintelligence purposes. One such example of this from the i-SOON leak is the apparent exfiltration of call\ndata records (CDR) and other material from multiple telecommunications companies, likely to enable\ntracking of individuals’ locations and communications within specific countries.\n\nDespite i-SOON's global impact and extensive targeting, it is a relatively small company operating\nalongside numerous other similar entities within China's complex private contractor landscape, again\nunderscoring the broad scope and scale of Chinese state-sponsored cyber operations. In the aftermath\nof substantial media attention following the leak, we anticipate i-SOON-linked threat activity groups will\nattempt to continue operations unabated beyond tactical operational security adjustments. We have\nalready observed signs of renewed infrastructure developments attributed to RedAlpha and RedHotel.\nFuture tracking of the company’s targeting may provide insight as to whether they will continue to be\nfavored for use by Chinese security services against specific targets or if they will be relegated to\nlower-priority tasking in the aftermath of the leak. In addition to potential internal changes, the leak is\n\n1 RedAlpha activity overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Deepcliff and Red Dev 3.\n\n2 RedHotel activity overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Aquatic Panda, Bronze University, Charcoal Typhoon, Earth Lusca,\nFishmonger, and Red Scylla.\n\n1 CTA-CN-2024-0320 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n2 CTA-CN-2024-0320 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The public security system, which generally refers to police forces under the Ministry of Public\nSecurity (MPS)\n\n  - The state security system, which generally refers to intelligence forces under the Ministry of\nState Security (MSS)\n\n  - The military system, primarily meaning the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\n\ni-SOON’s activities on behalf of public security clients included targeting foreign government and\ntelecommunications organizations that analysts may have previously assumed were more likely to be\nassociated with state security priorities, highlighting overlapping areas of responsibility between public\nand state security organizations, and broad use of offensive cyber operations across both systems.\n\nCountries in which government and corporate entities have almost certainly been targeted by i-SOON\ninclude India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal,\nRwanda, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Nigeria, Egypt, South Korea, Türkiye, and others, as well as\nentities in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nWe also note more ambiguous references to organizations within the leak, where it is unclear as to\nwhether these organizations were victims, targets, or otherwise.

Insikt Group previously observed and reported on an FMIS mail server communicating to RedHotel ShadowPad C2 infrastructure in June 2022.|\n|Thai Government Departments|The leaked i-SOON material also references multiple Thai government departments as victims with no time frames provided. Many of these overlap with known RedHotel victims historically reported by Insikt Group.|\n|Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye|Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (Tübitak) SSL VPN and mail server infrastructure regularly communicating to a RedHotel actor-controlled server. This organization is also referenced in the i-SOON leak as being compromised in 2020.|\n|Various Telecommunications Organizations|The i-SOON leak refers to the compromise of multiple Asian telecommunications firms including Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications (Myanmar), Digi (Malaysia), and Bayan Telecommunications (Philippines). While we have not observed RedHotel compromising these organizations directly, we have observed historical typosquat domains spoofing these organizations, which we attribute to RedHotel.
