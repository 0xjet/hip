    "plain_text": "# The Compact Campaign\n\n**wmcglobal.com/blog/the-compact-campaign**\n\n## SuMMARY\n\n[Phishing campaigns continue to utilize the disruption of the pandemic to target victims, and a new](https://www.wmcglobal.com/blog/covid-update)\ncampaign takes advantage of Zoom's rising popularity. Since December, the \"Compact\" Campaign\nhas been targeting thousands of users by impersonating a Zoom invite and is estimated to have\ncollected over 400,000 Outlook Web Access and Office 365 credentials. This campaign is unique\nin its use of trusted domains to ensure delivery of phishing emails and preventing phishing pages\nfrom being blocked. This is especially worrisome for organizations who will struggle to defend\nagainst this attack.\n\nThe WMC Global Threat Intelligence team has analyzed the entire attack, including PHP code\nused on the website, and has recovered stolen credentials harvested by the threat actors. The\nanalysis has linked email addresses to the responsible threat actors and found a history of these\nthreat actors performing attacks since the start of 2020.\n\n## IN DEPTH analysis\n\n Email\n\n\n-----\n\nThis phishing lure delivery method was via email and appeared to be using an extensive email\naddress spam list to target victims. It's estimated that as many as 11% of users fall for phishing\ncampaigns and given the size of this attack it is logical that a large number of users fell victim to\nthe phishing site.\n\n_Figure 1: Initial Email Lure_\n\nThe team reviewed exposed credential logs and estimated that approximately each campaign\ncollected 3,700 unique credentials. With multiple campaigns identified, the threat actor could have\nupwards of 400,000 unique username password values.\n\nThe send field was spoofed to show it has come from Zoom but using\nnoreply@<companyName>.tld.\n\nFor example, from WMC Global, we would expect to see a from address, such as:\n\nFrom: Zoom <noreply@wmcglobal.com>\n\n## DELIVERY\n\nMany of the emails were sent using compromised SendGrid accounts. WMC Global worked\nclosely with SendGrid to terminate the sending accounts which were then restored back to their\nrightful owners. We saw in later campaigns the threat actors pivoting away from SendGrid and\nmoving to MailGun to send the emails. We suspect this is due to the efficiency of us sending\naccounts to SendGrid for termination.\n\n## Phishing site\n\nThe phishing site has distinctive fingerprints within the code. As a result, the WMC Global Threat\nIntelligence team monitored and detected the phishing sites as soon as the landing page\ninfrastructure was available.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Initial HTML Code_\n\nThere were two phishing landing sites in use in the December 2020 and January 2021 phishing\ncampaigns. In December, the landing page impersonated the Outlook Web App brand to trick\ntargets into entering their credentials. In January, the attacks changed to mimic Office 365 brand,\nlikely to capture more employee credentials.\n\n_Figure 3: OWA Lure_\n\nThe source code contains several layers of encoding from the escaped source. When first\ndecoded, it reveals the headers, although there is a second encoding layer for HTML and CSS\nelements. The header contains key information to assist in tracking the threat further.\n\nWhile these campaigns always have the same double encoded content, the top header variables\nchange as the campaigns evolve or websites are taken down or detected.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Exfiltration Locations HTML_\n\nThere are three primary inputs into the code:\n\n1. The media host store - Which collecting images for the phishing page:\n\nmedia = 'hxxps://applink[.]host/media/mediarounds/';\n\n1. The exfiltration POST script – To POST credentials to and always stored on a different\n\ndomain:\n\nb = 'hxxps://kedai27[.]com//appspy/gle21/off2/compact.php';\n\n1. The redirect domain redirects the user once they have completed entering their credentials:\n\nrdr = 'hxxps://login.microsoftonline[.]com';\n\n_The URLs above have been defanged for safety in this blog._\n\n_Figure 5: Decoded Source_\n\nThe team tracked and monitored the website source code for this header, extracted the indicators\nof compromise (IoCs), and then recovered victims from the exfiltration locations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exfiltration & Logs\n\nExfiltration is the method attackers utilize to move compromised credentials away from the initial\nphishing website to locations where they can then access the credentials without revealing\ninformation that could compromise identity. This attack used numerous legitimate compromised\nwebsites to host the exfiltration code. This campaign used static .txt files for Exfiltration logs.\n\n_Figure 6: Victim File_\n\nThe controlling threat actors periodically wiped and removed the credential file logs to prevent\nother threat actors or security teams from discovering the phishing attack victims. The WMC\nGlobal Threat Intelligence team monitored credential logs and identified multiple victims from large\nand notable companies.\n\nIn mid-January 2021, the team tracked a pattern that emerged in a small number of logs\nsubmitted and concluded a credential poisoning operation was being conducted to dilute the\nlegitimate credentials harvested by the threat actors. Some cybersecurity companies use\ncredential poisoning to hide legitimate credentials in pools of fake logins, causing the threat actor\ndifficulty detecting the authentic logins. Some threat actors may also poison the results of their\ncompetitors. Many threat actors are cognizant of credential poisoning operations and frequently\nvalidate credentials automatically upon ingestion flagging inauthentic credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exfiltration Code\n\nThis threat actor made a mistake and left a misconfigured exfiltration script, allowing WMC Global\nto analyze the source code of the PHP file. At a later date, the threat actors left a web shell\nexposed on the website enabling download of further copies of the exfiltration code.\n\n_Figure 7: Webshell #1_\n\n_Figure 8: Webshell #2_\n\nReviewing the script gave the team a complete understanding of how the threat actors handle the\nPOST data. The workflow is simple, but the code shows unusual complexities for credential\nphishing actors, allowing WMC Global to assert that the threat actors possess a higher technical\naptitude. Initially, the POST information checks to ensure data is being POST to the page. A 404status page can occur when the page receives a GET request or an incorrect POST format. If the\ndata is in the correct format, the username, password, and \"desc\" inputs are assigned variables,\nand the username and password are then automatically validated.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Message Write_\n\nThe validation occurs by the threat actors attempting to log in to the user's IMAP email account.\nThe login attempt occurs within the code, and establishes an initial connection to a Microsoft email\nserver on port 993. The code then uses the built-in PHP function imap_open to open a connection\nstream to the mailbox. If the connection succeeds, the email stream returns; otherwise, an error\noccurs. This technique allows the threat actors to know which compromised users' credentials are\nvalid and have access to their email accounts externally. The result of the login test write to the log\nfile.\n\n_Figure 10: imap Code_\n\n_$ipdat = @json_decode(file_get_contents(\"http://www.geoplugin.net/json.gp?ip=\" . $ip));_\n\nThe attacker uses the geoPlugin service for IP enrichment. IP enrichment is a popular tool used\nby threat actors to get additional metadata on an IP. The reason this data is required is due to\nmany large companies performing IP checking for login attempts. As a result, threat actors will use\nVPNs and proxies to ensure they are in the same geographical region according to their IP\naddress when they attempt to access a user's account. Using the gathered metadata and checked\ncredentials, the data writes to the host's log file and emails a copy to the controlling threat actors.\nThe threat actors' emails are hardcoded and are referred to in the code.\n\n_$config['adminEmail'] = 'spyblessings2021@gmail.com,postmaster@spy224.host';_\n\nAbove are two email addresses linked to the threat actors: SpyBlessings2021 and postmaster.\nBecause there is no digital footprint, WMC Global asserts these emails were registered solely to\nreceive the phishing logs. Three of the scripts were identified as used by the threat actors but are\n\n\n-----\n\nonly different in the email subjects. So far, the team has observed the following email subjects\nbeing used:\n\n\"Off 365- Scrt@hed !nvesments\"\n\"365-Inves!ment\"\n\"Off 365- !nvesm3nt!s Cont@cts\"\n\nThe team found three exfiltration scripts on two separate infrastructures used in the same\ncampaign using the same two email addresses. However, a third email address was found in an\nunrelated campaign.\n\n## Code Overlap\n\nWhile performing threat hunting, the team discovered a phishing kit targeting Office365 customers\nusing an identical exfiltration script as seen in the other campaigns.\n\n_Figure 11: Phishing Page from Code Overlap_\n\nThe TTPs used in this phishing site differ vastly from the other campaign. However, there is\nsubstantial code overlap. The admin email address was different within the script file, and the\nemail subject also differed, but the rest of the code was identical to the other campaign.\n\n$config['adminEmail'] = 'john.broomfield640@gmail.com'\n$subject = \"New Data Received\"\n\nThis code overlap implies two hypotheses:\n\n1. The controlling threat actors utilize several different TTPs to distribute their phishing\n\ncampaigns, making tracking the actor more complicated. Ultimately, the phishing sites are\nstill controlled by the same threat actors each time.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Multiple threat actors are using the same phishing kit, which results in numerous TTPs. In\n\nthis case, the phishing kit is maybe for sale to various parties, or the phishing kit is old and\nwas not previously analyzed.\n\nAll the IoCs are available in IoC section at the end of this post.\n\n## History\n\nThe latest email campaigns have caused considerable attention to be drawn to the attackers.\nHowever, the WMC Global Threat Intel Team has found evidence the same threat actors have\nbeen active before, using the same TTPs but different phishing themes. Around August 2020,\nseveral themes appeared impersonating Excel, Outlooks Web App (OWA), and Outlook Web\nAccess Exchange.\n\n_Figure 12: Excel Lure_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: OWA Exchange_\n\nAround the end of September, a new Office365 lure started to be used by the group, which is still\nin circulation and is the more prevalent lure used. Additionally, there is evidence of some small\ncampaigns using lures, including 1&1 Ionos and Rackspace; however, these were smaller and\nonly saw a few runs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ionon Lure_\n\n_15: Rackspace Lure_\n\n\n_Figure 14:_\n\n_Figure_\n\n\n-----\n\nThese discoveries help the team understand the motives behind the threat actor group. They have\nbeen in the cybercrime space for some time and are re-using effective TTPs, having gone\nundetected and under-investigated previously.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise– IoCs\n\n_All links are
