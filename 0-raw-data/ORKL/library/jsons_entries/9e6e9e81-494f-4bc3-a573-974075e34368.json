Now, as the subject of\n[MITRE’s latest ATT&CK Evaluation, the group is in focus again. The Dukes are familiar to F-](https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/)\nSecure’s [Artturi Lehtio, who extensively researched them during their heyday and authored a](https://twitter.com/lehtior2?lang=en)\n[2015 whitepaper on the topic. But hindsight is 20/20 and Artturi joins us for Episode 39 of](https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/18122307/F-Secure_Dukes_Whitepaper.pdf)\nCyber Security Sauna to discuss how, over time, his views on the group have evolved.\n\nAlso in this episode: What APT groups usually do after being burned and how the Dukes is\ndifferent; why calling them a “single organization” is too strong; and why published research\ninto APT groups has generally dwindled in recent years.\n\n[Listen, or read on for the transcript.

We’re talking about Dukes because APT29 is the scenario MITRE ATT&CK**\n**chose for round 2 testing this year, and you’re the guy who led F-**\n**Secure’s investigation into Dukes in 2015. What are you working on these days?**\n\nThese days I’m working on totally unrelated topics on business strategy and corporate\ndevelopment at F-Secure. But yeah, back in the day I spent a few years researching these\nkinds of APTs.\n\n**So you’re all grown up.**\n\nI’d like to think so.\n\n**Okay. Can you give us a quick rundown on the Dukes, or APT29. Who are they, and**\n**who do they work for?**\n\nSo the Dukes, APT29, Cozy Bear, are all different names for the same set of tools and\nactivities used for cyber espionage that we believe are sponsored by the Russian\nFederation. It’s a set of tools and activities that have been in operation since at least 2008 up\nto, at the time of the report, up to 2015.\n\nArtturi Lehtio\n\n**All right. You’re calling them Dukes. What’s wrong with Cozy Bear?**\n\nThe first public mention of the Dukes was in February 2013 when Kaspersky, together with\nan organization called CrySyS Lab, which is part of the Budapest University of Technology\nand Economics. They released a whitepaper on a specific piece of malware that they\nnamed MiniDuke. And later then when we started discovering other toolsets that were clearly\n\n\n-----\n\nrelated, us and some others in the industry started giving them names that would always end\nin Duke, to show that there was some relationship between them. So\nthen CosmicDuke came later, and CozyDuke eventually as well.\n\nCozy Bear was a name that was used by a specific company in the industry later, and Cozy\nBear and Cozy Duke, in terms of toolsets, are essentially the same thing, but Cozy Bear can\nalso then refer to the wider set of activities. We talked about Cozy Bear internally for a while\nand actually changed the name to CozyDuke when we realized it’s related to the Dukes, just\nto keep it in our opinion much simpler and make it clear that there’s a relationship. But some\nhave stuck to using Cozy Bear.\n\n**Okay. So like you said, the group was active up to the time when you published your**\n**research. What happened with them since?**\n\nSo yeah, that’s a really interesting question actually. Most of the time when new research is\npublished on tools or techniques used by threat actors, the actors will try and make the\nminimum amount of changes needed just to be able to continue their operations. So they’ll\nmake some small modifications to tools, or they’ll set up some new infrastructure or\nsomething, but try and keep going as soon as possible. And the Dukes did that for a long\ntime as well, for many years. And within weeks of new research being published, they’d be\nback at it with the slightest of modifications.\n\nThat’s why it was really interesting actually, after we released the whitepaper in September of\n2015, they really did seem to go dark for about half a year, at least. And only later in the\nspring of 2016 there started to be small signs of them starting to set up new infrastructure\n[again. And then there were smaller outbreaks of activity in 2016 and ’17 and ’18 where they](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/)\ndid some activities using slightly different tool sets, but they never really came back in the\nsame force that they used to operate in. Or at least, not in the same way that we would still\nclassify them as the same set of activities.\n\n**That’s interesting. What do you think happened to the people and tools and**\n**operations?**\n\nThe people and the know-how lived on, I’m sure of that. Whether the people were moved to\nother organizations or just switched tools and techniques or so forth, I don’t know. They\nprobably retired a lot of the tools because at that point the tools were so well known, and at\nthat point they’d already started to get into the habit of taking into use new tool sets at an\naccelerating pace. So they were increasingly diversifying already in terms of tool\nsets. So they probably continued that as well.\n\n**So is that typically what happens when a group like this gets burned? Do they go**\n**away and take a breather, and rethink about their operations, retool, and come back,**\n**version 2.0? Or how does that look?**\n\n\n-----\n\nActually, not usually. Most of the time they ll try and continue, and that s probably for a couple\nof reasons.\n\nOne reason, definitely, is for these types of cyber espionage capabilities, very few nations\nhave the resources where they can just shut down one of their main capabilities without\nlosing a significant amount of intelligence. So they have to make that cost benefit analysis of,\nis it worth losing that capability? It takes time to rebuild. And so you have to be happy with\nnot having that capability for a while.\n\nAnother reason is also the amount of effort involved, and then it depends on what your\nobjectives are. In the case of the Dukes, they were always about information gathering. So\nfor them, being able to maintain a presence in an organization’s networks, preferably for\nyears, just collecting information, was important. And once you’re burned bad, it’s just not\nsomething you can continue doing anymore. For other actors, for instance Fancy Bear or\nAPT28, another suspected Russian espionage group, they do a lot more active measures.\nThey do disruptive attacks. They collect information for information warfare purposes or for\ndoing information leaks, for instance. Those are much more short-lived and so it’s a different\nobjective, and therefore it’s a different cost benefit analysis as well.\n\n**So is that the reason of doing research like this and publishing it? To burn these**\n**groups? Or what’s your motivation and purpose for doing this kind of research?**\n\nThat’s not the primary purpose. The ultimate purpose of really any cyber security research,\nand really any APT research, is to enable defenders to make more informed decisions. So,\nto help defenders prioritize their activities, prioritize what types of defensive capabilities they\nbuild, and how they build those capabilities.\n\nSo when we do this type of research, it’s for that purpose as well. It can be to dive really\ndeep into a technical analysis of a specific tool or set of tools or a specific technique so that\ndefenders have a better chance of preparing for that and defending against it. Or it can be\nsomething like we did with the 2015 whitepaper, where it was more a high level overview and\na look at how the tactics had evolved over years, and we tried to look at behavioral patterns\nand how those patterns had changed over the years to help defenders then assess how the\nthreat landscape may be evolving, how attackers may be evolving, and how to prioritize\nfuture investments and defensive measures.\n\n**Now that you have the benefit of hindsight, what do you think you might have done**\n**differently while conducting or publishing your research? Like, if you could do it all**\n**over again?**\n\nI think the biggest challenge for this kind of research is knowing where to stop or being\nwilling to stop at some point. As a researcher you keep finding new threads and keep coming\nup with additional hypotheses and you keep wanting to go just a bit further before you stop\nand write the report. But at some point you just have to stop, and you have to kind of accept\n\n\n-----\n\nthat it s a snapshot. It s your best understanding at that point in time, but it can t be more than\nthat. And so I think we did a relatively good job in terms of explicitly bringing out the data we\nhad and the analysis we did based on that data, and also the limitations of it.\n\nAt the same time, I think there are a couple of assessments where my thinking has\ndeveloped further. I think the most important evolution is in the report, we state, actually quite\nstrongly, that we believe the Dukes to be a single large well-coordinated organization. In\nhindsight, I would soften that statement a bit. I still believe in the underlying sentiment. I still\nbelieve in the data and how it shows a surprisingly significant amount of coordination across\nall of the different activities. But I think the “single organization” is maybe a bit too strong, in\nthat there’s probably multiple operational groups, multiple separate teams of operators using\nthe tools. There’s probably multiple separate teams of developers developing different parts\nof the tool sets. And then those tool sets get distributed to the different operational teams at\nslightly different points in time, or some teams get some tools and others get a different set of\ntools, and the groups may coordinate on some things or share some knowledge, but not\neverything.\n\n**So you’re almost describing a company, an organization, with the developers and task**\n**masters, but then separate teams working on separate objectives, people moving**\n**between the teams sharing some of the tools, sharing some of the targeting. Is that**\n**what you think is happening?**\n\nYeah. I’ll give a couple of examples. So, there’s probably multiple operational teams.\nBecause when we looked at the specific ways some of the tools were used or configured, for\ninstance in the case of CosmicDuke, the same tool set, we could kind of see different\npreferences for what encryption keys to use, or how to configure it or how to use it. And\n\n\n-----\n\nthose would usually cluster around. So it seemed like different operators or different teams\nhad different preferences, but then there was sometimes some overlap in some shared\ninfrastructure or some similarity. So maybe a person moved from one team to another or\nsomething like that. Or in the case of some of the tools, we could see how a new version of\nthe tool was created, and then these different clusters of different ways of using the tools.\nThey’d take the new version into use at slightly different points in time, depending on maybe\ntheir operational cycle, for instance. They’d be at different stages of the operational cycle, so\nthey’d wait until the start of the next cycle to update their tools, for instance.\n\nBut then in some situations we also saw cases where one tool set was used to deploy\nanother tool set on the same system, in situations where the tool sets served the exact same\npurpose and have the same functionality, they’re just different tool sets and connecting to\ndifferent clusters of infrastructure. And the most likely explanation for that that we could come\nup with was probably handing off a target from one operational team to another one. Where\nthe easiest way, perhaps, was to deploy the other team’s implant onto that system and then\nremove your implant and they’d retain control of it.\n\nSo there were clearly situations where there was some collaboration happening or some\nsharing happening, but most of the time, they were operating relatively independently.\n\nThe reason we originally said it was a single coordinated organization was because we\nnever really saw overlap in the sense where it would have looked like separate operational\nteams were targeting the same target at the same time, without knowing about each other.\nSo clearly they did a lot of deconflicting.\n\nIn the targets as well, the majority of the activity was focused on foreign policy targets. But\nthen there was a small set of activity that very much looked more like police law enforcement\nwork, where the targets seemed to be criminals engaged in illicit drugs, growth hormones,\nand the sale of those, and actually, in child porn. So that seems very much like a law\nenforcement target. And those seemed to be targeted at individuals in Russia. And then\nyou’d see the non-Russian foreign ministries get targeted by a separate cluster of activity,\nagain suggesting that maybe there were different operational teams, maybe even in different\norganizations who were sharing some of the methodologies, some of the tools, but had their\ndifferent priorities and worked relatively independently.\n\n**But does that also support your work towards attribution? I can think of a Russian**\n**organization whose mandate just happens to have in it both foreign espionage of**\n**neighboring countries, but also drug trade within Russia.**\n\nWell, I’m not an expert in criminology or Russian intelligence organizations. But certainly, for\ninstance, the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service, in their 2018 public report, they actually\nexplicitly attribute the Dukes to Russia’s FSB and SVR, the federal security service and\nforeign intelligence service respectively, suggesting that it was, or part of it may have been\nactually a joint operation by those two.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Is there anything else, sort of a hunch you got about the people behind these attacks**\n**when you were doing your research? Did you get the sense that they’re sort of young,**\n**fresh, quick minds, or older, more seasoned veterans?**\n\nThat’s another interesting question. Not in the sense that we would have some idea of who\nthe people were. But when we looked at the evolution of the different tool sets,\nlike MiniDuke for instance, they look like they’ve been developed by people who have a lot of\nexperience developing malware and viruses. MiniDuke famously, parts of it were written in\nassembly language. So very low level, very challenging to code in that sense, but something\nthat, you know, the good old days virus writers would do.\n\nSome other tool sets like CozyDuke, for instance, versions of it had a lot of helper\nfunctionality and debugger functionality and logging functionality, and it looked like you’d\ntaken a team of enterprise software developers and told them to go and write malware, and\nthey started from that background, and then slowly evolved into making it look more like\nmalware, and they started removing some of the logging and started obfuscating things, and\nstarted hiding things eventually over the years.\n\nSo on the tool set side, it looks like different tool sets were developed by developers or\nteams of developers from very different backgrounds and those eventually kind of fed into\neach other.\n\n**That’s interesting. Getting back to your research, what kind of lessons can be learned**\n**about where you were successful and where less so?**\n\nI think it continues to show the importance of really making the data and the analysis explicit,\nso others can then further build on that work, and others can make their own assessments\nand decide to agree or decide to disagree. I think it’s an important but difficult balance to\nstrike between analysis and over-interpretation, of analyzing and presenting hypotheses or\neven conclusions, but not over-interpreting, reading too much into it.\n\nI think it’s incredibly important to build on the research that others have done. We made the\nconscious decision of citing others as much as possible and putting in a long list of\nreferences and links to further reading, more technical analyses of the different tool sets that\nothers have done, rather than just try to gain a short term marketing or PR win by just\nemphasizing novelty or trying to make it look like it was just our research and just our\nfindings.\n\n**Yeah, you mentioned other companies who’ve been doing research and publishing**\n**research around the same group. Do you find that that makes it harder to look at**\n**things with fresh eyes and keep an open mind when making conclusions, or is it more**\n**helpful because they sort of fill in some of your blanks?**\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s absolutely a great benefit and a positive thing. Any researcher, any organization has a\nlimited point of view, limited visibility in that sense, and they only see a portion of the activity.\nI never had the opportunity to do actual live incident response for instance, on a Dukes\nincident. We based our research primarily on observing tools and infrastructure and artifacts\nwe could find, and then inferring from that how those tools might have been used, whereas,\nyou know, others have then later gone on to talk about their perspective from doing incident\nresponse.\n\n[Like in 2016, there was a talk by Matthew Dunwoody and Nick Carr, who were working for](https://www.slideshare.net/MatthewDunwoody1/no-easy-breach-derby-con-2016)\nMandiant at the time, a talk called No Easy Breach, and they talked about their experiences\nresponding to a single Dukes incident. And that was really interesting because that was very\nmuch the opposite perspective.\n\nCostin Raiu, who leads the team at Kaspersky that does APT research, he’s famously\ncompared APT research to paleontology, where you study animals and plants from bones\nand fossils. And kind of looking at a pile of bones and trying to figure out what the animal\nlooked like and how it moved and what it did and what it ate and so forth. And our research\nin the Dukes was very similar to that in that we had all of these small artifacts, kind of bones\nin a warehouse, and we tried to figure out what the animals might have looked like, where\nthe different bones belonged, but we hadn’t seen any of those animals actually live or\nmoving.\n\nAnd then Dunwoody and Carr, they’d done the incident response, they’d seen some of those\nanimals live in their natural habitat. They’d seen some of the activities, and so they talked\nabout that perspective. And it was really interesting to compare how far we’d gotten in our\nassessment from our perspective compared to their perspective and how well or not we’d\nbeen able to make those inferences, for instance, about how the tools were being used.\n\n**Do you ever get that feeling where you’re reading some additional research and you’re**\n**looking at a conclusion and you’re like, “Oh man, that’s why they did that!” or “That’s**\n**what my data showed back then!” but you never made that connection, and you’re**\n**like, “I should have caught that.”**\n\nThere’s a couple of examples, actually. One is HammerDuke or Hammertoss, which FireEye\nreleased a whitepaper, I think it was in August 2015 on what they called Hammertoss, when\nthey also first used the name APT29, and they talked about this super stealthy, super\nadvanced piece of malware that they’d found from this novel threat actor called APT29.\n\nIn fact, at that point, we’d seen that tool a lot, and we’d looked into it, but from our\nperspective, we’d always just seen it as being used later in an attack as kind of a helper or\nutility. They’d be using other malware earlier in the breach and then they’d maybe\ndrop HammerDuke on some of those systems and leave it there as kind of a secondary\ntool. So we didn’t pay much attention to it.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd then, from FireEye s perspective, I assume they found it in an incident response\ninvestigation, where some of the earlier tools had already been removed from the\nsystem. So for them, it was the star of the show. So that was a very different perspective.\n\n[Another, more recent, was late last autumn, ESET released research on what they called](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/17/operation-ghost-dukes-never-left/)\nOperation Ghost, on activity that again, they tied to the Dukes of old. But actually, based on a\nquick look, it’s related to some of the tool sets and some of the pieces of activity that we\nnever had as much time to dive into, some of the OnionDuke stuff where we were left with\nsome open questions. And I never had a chance to go as deep into that as I maybe would\nhave wanted. So it was really interesting to see someone else had then managed to find out\na lot more about that side of it, that again, we never actually learned as much about.\n\nSo yeah, that happens quite a lot, where the research that others then release brings new\nperspectives or new ideas or fills in the blanks, like you said, where you realize, “Now that\nmakes sense,” or “That’s why they did it,” or “That’s how it’s related,” and so forth.\n\n**Okay. I mean, you’re referencing some fairly recent research there. But it seems to me**\n**like we’re not seeing a whole lot of APT research anymore. Do you think that’s**\n**accurate?**\n\nI do think it’s accurate. It’s much rarer now. I think there was a point in time when APT\nresearch and making it publicly available was a hot trend. Unfortunately, an increasing\nnumber of people and companies got into it primarily for short term marketing and PR winds,\nyou know, trying to do some research and write a quick report and get quoted by the media\nand that way get your company name out there. And that kind of led to a race to the bottom,\nwhere you needed to constantly come up with ever more sensational headlines and\nconclusions.\n\nAnd the problem was, most of the time, most of the research was looking at a small set of\nactors and looking at the same sets of data, the same data sources, so most of the people\nwere actually looking at the same things but trying to turn it into new sensational headlines\nand novel research. And that led to eventually kind of a bubble where everyone just started\nemphasizing novelty and exaggerating the novelty and stopped referencing others and\nstopped giving context. And smaller and smaller chunks of activity or tools became the next\ngreatest piece of new findings.\n\nAnd eventually, the research lost its value for defenders. Because from a defender’s\nperspective, if you lose the context of what’s this related to and what else should I be looking\ninto, and what else should I care about, and if everything’s the most advanced, and\neverything’s the most stealthy and the most novel, then how do you prioritize as a defender\nanymore? Everything is the most at everything, and suddenly everything’s equal again. So\nas a defender, you can’t really use the information to prioritize anymore.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo it lost value, and – I think there was a bubble – I think the bubble burst. Some of the\nresearchers and companies who were good at doing original research, they started releasing\nless of it publicly and turned it into a business and started charging money for it. And others\nfigured out new ways of doing marketing and PR for them. It had many benefits, but one of\nthe downsides was less public research.\n\n**I get that as a researcher, you’re not a big fan of the sensationalism of it all. But do**\n**you think we’re worse off when we don’t have that equally advanced, equally**\n**persistent effort from researchers towards the APT groups?**\n\nI wouldn’t draw that conclusion. I think there’s still more research being put into these types\nof topics.\n\n**It’s just not being published.**\n\nExactly. I think the research kind of returned to its roots. From becoming for a while\nsomething that was driven by marketing and PR, it went back to – you know, these days,\nincident responders are doing a lot of research and using a lot of research. Red teamers are\ndoing a lot of this kind of research. Cyber security product R&D organizations are doing and\nusing this type of research, in-house threat intelligence teams exist at more well-resourced\ndefenders and so forth. So the research is being moved back to where it brings more value,\nback where, in my opinion, it belongs, informing defenders and improving defenses, rather\nthan being primarily a marketing activity.\n\n**Okay. Now, if we think about specifically the hacks into the DNC servers that preceded**\n**the 2016 election, what do you think was the purpose of the Russian government in**\n**doing that?**\n\nSo you’re talking about the reports in June 2016 that there was an ongoing incident response\nand investigation into IT systems of the US Democratic National Committee, the DNC.\n\n**Yeah. “Show me the server!”**\n\nIt was before the “show me the server,” but yeah, same case.\n\n**Oh, was it? Okay.**\n\nSo in June 2016, CrowdStrike, the US company doing the incident response, went public on\nthe fact that they were doing that incident response and some of their early findings. The\nblog post is fun to read, kind of because of that “find me the server” instance or case,\nbecause they’ve had to update it many times over the years. I think the most recent update is\nactually from January this year, where they added again links to new stories refuting the “find\nme the server” conspiracy theory. So it’s caused them a lot of trouble as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, June 2016, CrowdStrike went public and said they d identified two separate breaches by\ntwo separate threat actors in the IT systems of the Democratic National Committee. One of\nthe actors was the Dukes, or, as CrowdStrike called them, Cozy Bear. The other actor\nwas Sofacy, also know as APT28 or Fancy Bear.\n\nAnd what CrowdStrike also stated then was that they hadn’t actually identified any\ncollaboration between the two actors, and in fact, they hadn’t identified any signs of even\nawareness by the two actors of one another, which is actually quite significant information.\n\nWhat they do also say is that they suspect the breach by the Dukes began in the summer of\n2015 already, whereas APT28 only entered the systems in April 2016. Which again, is\nactually important from a timing perspective because in the summer of 2015, that was still\nbefore the whitepaper for instance, and back when the Dukes were still actively targeting\nnew organizations, especially targets relevant for foreign policy goals.\n\nAnd in the case of the DNC I think they were there just to gather information. I think they\nwere there just because it’s an important political target if you want to understand how the\nforeign policy and security policy of the US may evolve in the future. So they wanted to get\nthat visibility, they wanted to be there just listening in, gathering information.\n\n**Well as an information-gathering operation I’m pretty sure that that counts as a**\n**success. So do you think everything else sort of just was opportunistic, building on**\n**that initial success?**\n\nI guess you’re referring to some of the data leaks, for instance…\n\n**Yeah Information operations all of that**\n\n\n-----\n\nSo again, that s why it s important to be aware that there were two separate breaches and\ntwo separate actors that operated independent of each other. The information leaks and all\nof the hacking the election that’s been talked about, that’s all been tied to APT28, the other\nactor. Not APT29, not the Dukes.\n\nSo to the best of my understanding, the Dukes were there to gather information, and then the\nother kids on the block walked in and started making a lot of noise about it, and then both of\nthem got burned eventually.\n\n**Well, I mean, I guess that would make sense, if the attribution that’s sort of commonly**\n**agreed upon here in the West is that if 29 is SVR, the foreign intelligence service, and**\n**28 is GRU, the military intelligence, then it would make sense that one would be more**\n**focused on information gathering and the other more on the active measures you**\n**mentioned.**\n\nAt least to the extent that researching the Dukes, of course, the question of attribution was of\ninterest. Primarily because in some situations it helps understand the motivations of the\nattacker and it helps assess how they may evolve and who they may be targeting in the\nfuture. And so for us what was meaningful was that the Dukes very consistently targeted\nministries of foreign affairs, they targeted think tanks, especially foreign policy-related think\ntanks. They targeted embassies, for instance. So they very much seemed to be focused on\nforeign intelligence gathering kinds of targets.\n\nAnd that was also one of the reasons why we were back then already quite confident that –\nwe don’t know whether the people with their hands on the keyboard were employed by a\nfederal government or not. We don’t know if they work for an intelligence agency or not. But\nwe were confident, and remain confident, that the ultimate benefactor of that activity was a\ngovernment. Because no one other than governments gets significant value out of that type\nof foreign policy information, and that type of foreign policy espionage, essentially. So that’s\nwhy we were quite sure already back then that it has to be sponsored, at least, by a\ngovernment.\n\n**Okay. Now since MITRE chose this group as an example for this year’s testing, is**\n**there anything that stands out about Dukes as an APT group? Were they first for**\n**something, anything that makes them stand out from the mass?**\n\nThere were a couple of interesting aspects to them that I think are still very much applicable.\nOne of the interesting things was the type of attacks they did. They primarily had two kinds of\nattacks, at least the majority of the activity.\n\nSo they’d do smash-and-grab type of breaches. For instance, for a few years, twice a year,\nfrom late January to late February and again from late July to late August, they’d send out\nthousands of phishing emails. Not tens or hundreds, but thousands. They still picked targets\nrelatively specifically, so most of them were relevant for their goals, but they’d send out the\n\n\n-----\n\nsame phishing email to a couple of thousand at least. And those phishing emails were quite\ngeneric, quite common. They used eFax themes, for instance, which was a popular theme\nalso for ransomware at the time.\n\nAnd then they’d seemingly wait and see how many fell for that. And if out of a couple of\nthousand they got some tens, for instance, what they’d do was they’d rapidly deploy one of\ntheir tool sets on those systems and grab as much data as they could. And they’d expect to\nget burned at some point. And then they’d go back and sift through the data and figure out\nwhich targets were interesting enough to actually target again, or go after again. And then\nthey’d go back and use a different tool set and go in much slower, much stealthier, and much\nmore targeted, and kind of go back and then lay low and gather information.\n\nIn other situations, from the smash-and-grab, they’d actually try to quickly switch to the\nstealthy approach, so they’d quickly switch tool sets, they’d drop other malware on the same\nsystems, delete the original one, or they’d quickly move laterally to other systems, and on\nthose other systems they’d use completely different sets of tools, and they’d kind of try and\nswitch on the fly from making a lot of noise, as long as they’d get as much data as possible,\nto trying to staying there stealthy and persistent for a long time. So that was definitely\ninteresting.\n\n**Well, that fits my perception of what these groups are about. So was Dukes the first to**\n**do that, or is that something that they brought into the common knowledge of the**\n**other APT groups now?**\n\nI wouldn’t go as far as to necessarily say they were the first. Probably they weren’t. But at the\ntime there weren’t many publicly known groups employing that type of a strategy, that type of\na methodology.\n\n**Okay. So what do you think is the future of the Dukes?**\n\nI think the Dukes as such have already ceased to exist. Sure, there’s been some clusters of\nactivity since, but I think these days the Dukes are a useful but already historical case study.\nI think the people in the organizations behind the Dukes have probably long ago moved on. I\nmean, the people, the skills, the know-how, none of that has disappeared, it won’t disappear,\nbut some of the teams may have been disbanded or merged into other teams or reassigned,\nor who knows what.\n\nSo I’m confident that the legacy of the Dukes lives on. But I think from a defender’s\nperspective, it’s no longer meaningful to try and fit new activity into the same old mold of the\nDukes. If the same people are still at it, they’ve learned enough to switch their tools and\nswitch their tactics at this point.\n\n**So for us as defenders, it’s still a useful case study, but not something you’re likely to**\n**encounter live out there.**\n\n\n-----\n\nI don t think you ll find the exact same tools out there anymore, or all of the same techniques.\nBut certainly many of the techniques they employed are still useful, still applicable.\n\nA lot of the finesse of the Dukes as well was, for instance, they seemed to always have a\ngood understanding of the human side of it. And what’s hard for organizations. So they knew\nwhen to move fast. They’d do the big phishing campaigns with phishing emails that looked\nlike they were ransomware or whatever spam, perhaps with the idea being that it will\nprobably be noticed because it looks like spam, but it also won’t be investigated very quickly,\nbecause it doesn’t look like anything interesting or targeted, so it won’t be a high priority.\nAnd so they’ll have time, a couple of days maybe, to go and grab as much as they can. They\nknew when to move slowly.\n\nThey understood how the incident response may proceed and how to make it harder. They\nhad some really interesting ideas on how to try and hide and maintain persistence. So a lot\nof the tricks they did, and especially the understanding of how humans and the defenders\nwork and what their weaknesses are, that’s something that is still applicable.\n\n**All right. Hey, thank you for taking us down memory lane, and taking this retrospective**\n**of your research from half a decade ago. Thanks, Artturi.**\n\nMy pleasure.\n\n**That was our show for today.
