There have been numerous reports on their activities, to the extent that a Wikipedia entry has even been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofacy_Group)\ncreated for them.\nFrom these reports, we know that the group uses an abundance of tools and tactics, ranging across zero­day exploits targeting\ncommon applications such as Java or Microsoft Office, heavy use of spear­phishing attacks, compromising legitimate websites to\nstage watering­hole attacks, and targeting over a variety of operating systems – Windows, OSX, Linux, even mobile iOS.\nThe Linux malware Fysbis is a preferred tool of Sofacy, and though it is not particularly sophisticated, Linux security in general is\nstill a maturing area, especially in regards to malware. In short, it is entirely plausible that this tool has contributed to the success\nof associated attacks by this group. This blog post focuses specifically on this Linux tool preferred by Sofacy and describes\nconsiderations and implications when it comes to Linux malware.\n#### Malware Assessment\nFysbis is a modular Linux trojan / backdoor that implements plug­in and controller modules as distinct classes. For reference,\nsome vendors categorize this malware under the Sednit attacker group naming designation. This malware includes both 32­bit and\n[64­bit versions of Executable and Linking Format (ELF) binaries. Additionally, Fysbis can install itself to a victim system with or](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1059)\nwithout root privileges. This increases the options available to an adversary when it comes to selecting accounts for installation.\nSummary information for the three binaries we analyzed follows:\n\nMD5 364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467\nSHA­256 8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce19335\n5d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb\nssdeep 3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l0H786\nO26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n+1R43QcIL\nXdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi\nSize 141.2 KB (144560 bytes)\nType ELF 64 bit (stripped)\n\n\n-----\n\ng\nNon­root install system service d­bus notifier\ndesc\n\nC2 azureon­line[.]com (TCP/80)\nUsage Timeframe Late 2014\n\nTable 1: Sample 1 – Late 2014 Sofacy 64­bit Fysbis\nMD5 075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39\nSHA­256 02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba43795f2\n480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592\nssdeep 3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf454U\nNqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrIW33HxIajF:\n9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN+rv eQLZPTrV3Z\nSize 175.9 KB (180148 bytes)\nType ELF 32­bit (stripped)\nInstall as root /bin/ksysdefd\nRoot install desc system kernel service defender\nInstall as non­root ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\nNon­root install system kernel service defender\ndesc\n\nC2 198.105.125[.]74 (TCP/80)\nUsage Timeframe Early 2015\n\nTable 2: Sample 2 – Early 2015 Sofacy 32­bit Fysbis\nMD5 e107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8\nSHA­256 fd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d57ed\n9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61\nssdeep 6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6BCUd\nc4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+\nSize 314.4 KB (321902 bytes)\nType ELF 64­bit (not stripped)\nInstall as root /bin/ksysdefd\nRoot install desc system kernel service defender\nInstall as non­root ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\nNon­root install system kernel service defender\ndesc\n\nC2 mozilla­plugins[.]com (TCP/80)\nUsage Timeframe Late 2015\n\nTable 3: Sample 3 – Late 2015 Sofacy 64­bit Fysbis\nOverall, these binaries are assessed as low sophistication, but effective. They epitomize the grudging reality that Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT) actors often don’t require advanced means to affect their objectives. Rather, these actors more often than\nnot hold their advanced malware and zero day exploits in reserve and employ just enough resources to meet their goals. It is only\nfair that defenders use any shortcuts or tricks at their disposal to shorten the amount of time it takes to assess threats. In other\nwords, defenders should always look for ways to work smarter before they have to work harder.\nGetting the Most Out of Strings\nBinary strings alone revealed a good amount about these files, increasing the efficacy of activities such as static analysis\n[categorization (e.g., Yara). One example of this is Fysbis installation and platform targeting information for the samples in Table 1](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/)\nand Table 2.\n\nFigure 1: Sofacy Fysbis installation and platform targeting found in strings\nIn this case, we can see the binary installation path and local reconnaissance to determine which flavor of Linux the malware is\nrunning. This is followed by a number of Linux shell command style commands related to the malware establishing persistence.\nAnother example of easily obtained information from these samples is capability based.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Sofacy Fysbis capability related leakage through strings\nFigure 2 shows interactive status / feedback strings that can give a defender an initial profile of capabilities. In addition to\ncontributing to static analysis detections, this can be useful as a starting point for further incident response prioritization and\nqualification of the threat.\nSymbolic Information Can Shorten Analysis Time\nInterestingly, the most recent ELF 64­bit binary we analyzed (Table 3) was not stripped prior to delivery, which offered additional\n[context in the form of symbolic information. Defenders more familiar with Windows Portable Executable (PE) binaries can equate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms809762.aspx)\nthis with compilation of a Debug version versus a Release version. For comparison, if we were to inspect Fysbis “RemoteShell”\nassociated strings in one of the stripped variants, we would only see the following:\n\nFigure 3: Sofacy Fysbis stripped binary string references to RemoteShell capability\nCompare this with what is available from the non­stripped variant:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Sofacy Fysbis non­stripped binary strings referenes to RemoteShell capability\nLittle static analysis gifts like these can help to speed defender enumeration of capabilities and – more importantly – further\ncontribute to correlation and detection across related samples.\nAdditionally, this latest sample demonstrated minor evolution of the threat, most notably in terms of obfuscation. Specifically, both\nsamples in Table 1 and Table 2 leaked installation information in the clear within binary strings. This was not the case with the\nsample in Table 3. Taking a closer look at this non­stripped binary using a disassembler, the following corresponds to decoding\nmalware installation information for a root­privilege account.\n\nFigure 5: Assembly code view of Sample 3 installation decoding\nIn this case, the symbolic information hints at the method used for decoding, with references to mask, path, name, and info byte\narrays.\n\nFigure 6: Assembly view of Sample 3 root installation related byte arrays\nAs it turns out, the referenced byte mask is applied to the other byte arrays using a rolling double­XOR algorithm to construct\nmalware installation paths filenames and descriptions for a Linux root account Corresponding INSTALLUSER byte arrays exist\n\n\n-----\n\ng p\nIf you would like to learn more about how Fysbis works, the samples analyzed remain fairly consistent with the sample analysis\n[found here.](http://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=4276269)\n#### Infrastructure Analysis\nAs Unit 42 has discussed in depth in other blog articles, we have observed that adversaries in general are seemingly hesitant in\nchanging their infrastructure. This may be due to not wanting to commit additional resources, or simply a matter of retaining\nfamiliarity for the sake of timeliness. In either case, we see the same type of behavior here with the Fysbis samples in use by\nSofacy.\nThe oldest sample (Table 1), was found to beacon to the domain azureon­line[.]com, which had already been widely publicized as\na known command and control domain for the Sofacy group. Using passive DNS, we can see that two of the original IPs this\ndomain resolved to, 193.169.244[.]190 and 111.90.148[.]148 also mapped to a number of other domains that had been in use by\nthe Sofacy group during that time period.\n\nFigure 7: Sample 1 C2 resolutions\nThe first of the newer samples (Table 2), continues the trend and beacons to an IP also widely associated with the Sofacy group,\n198.105.125[.]74. This IP has been mostly associated with the tool specifically known as CHOPSTICK, which can be read about\n[here.](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt28.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Sample 2 C2 resolutions\nThe newest sample (Table 3), introduces a previously unknown command and control beacon to mozilla­plugins[.]com. This\nactivity aligns with the previously observed Sofacy group tactic of integrating legitimate company references into their\ninfrastructure naming convention. Neither this new domain nor the IP it resolves to have been observed in the past, indicating that\nthe sample in Table 3 may be associated with a newer campaign. Comparing this sample’s binary with the other two however,\nshows there are significant similarities on the code level as well as in terms of shared behavior.\n\nFigure 9: Sample 3 C2 resolutions\n#### Conclusion\nLinux is used across business and home environments and appears in a variety of form factors. It is a preferred platform within\ndata centers and the cloud for businesses, as well as an ongoing favorite when it comes to a majority of Internet­facing web and\napplication servers. Linux is also at the foundation of Android devices and a number of other embedded systems. The value\nproposition of Linux – especially when it comes to its use in the enterprise – can be broken out into three perceived benefits: lower\ntotal cost of ownership (TCO), security, and feature set. While numbers and comparison alone can contribute to measurement of\nTCO and feature set, security requires further qualification. Expertise in the Linux platform is highly sought after across all\nindustries for multiple disciplines, from system administration to big data analytics to incident response.\nThe majority of businesses still maintain Windows­heavy user environments where certain core infrastructure components also\noperate under Windows servers (e.g., Active Directory, SharePoint, etc.). This means, from a practical perspective, most of a\nbusiness’s focus remains on supporting and protecting Windows assets. Linux remains a mystery to a number of enterprise IT\n\n\n-----\n\np y p g p\nLack of expertise and visibility into non­Windows platforms combine in some environments to present significant risks against an\n[organization’s security posture. As a recent caution, the Linux vulnerability described under CVE­2016­0728 further demonstrates](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3023870/security/linux-kernel-flaw-endangers-millions-of-pcs-servers-and-android-devices.html)\nthe potential breadth of real­world risks to associated platforms. A natural extension of this exposure is increased targeting by both\ndedicated and opportunistic attackers across various malicious actor motivations. Despite the lingering belief (and false sense of\nsecurity) that Linux inherently yields higher degrees of protection from malicious actors, Linux malware and vulnerabilities do exist\nand are in use by advanced adversaries. To mitigate associated risks requires tailored integration of the people, processes, and\ntechnology in support of prevention, monitoring, and detection within an environment.\nLinux malware detection and prevention is not prevalent at this time, but Palo Alto Networks customers are protected through our\nnext­generation security platform:\nIPS signature 14917 deployed to identify and prevent command and control activity\nThe C2 domains and files mentioned in this report are blocked in our Threat Prevention product.\n#### Indicators\n**Type** **Value**\nMD5 364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467\nSHA256 8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce193\n355d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb\nssdeep 3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l\n0H786O26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n\n+1R43QcILXdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi\nMD5 075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39\nSHA­256 02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba437\n95f2480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592\nssdeep 3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf\n454UNqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrI\nW33HxIajF:9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN\n+rv eQLZPTrV3Z\nMD5 e107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8\nSHA­256 fd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d\n57ed9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61\nssdeep 6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6\nBCUdc4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+\nPath /bin/rsyncd\nPath Desc synchronize and backup service\nPath ~/.config/dbus­notifier/dbus­inotifier\nPath Desc system service d­bus notifier\nPath /bin/ksysdefd\nPath ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\nPath Desc system kernel service defender\nC2 azureon­line[.]com\nC2 198.105.125[.]74\nC2 mozilla­plugins[.]com\nC2 Mozillaplagins[.]com\n\n# 27 Pingbacks & Trackbacks\n\nFebruary 13, 2016 5:13 AM\n### The Fysbis Linux Backdoor Used By Russian Hackers ­ BitsHacker\nFebruary 13, 2016 1:09 PM\n### Fysbis Linux, El nuevo BackDoor de la Familia Malware « Tecnoinnovador\nFebruary 14, 2016 8:38 AM\n### Russian Hackers Spying On Your Linux PC Using Sophisticated Malware “Fysbis” | ..:: Frog in the box ::.. | ..:: Frog in the box ::..\nFebruary 15, 2016 5:56 AM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan ­ GeekTechTalk\n\n\n-----\n\nFebruary 15, 2016 6:05 AM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan | E­Network News\nFebruary 15, 2016 7:47 AM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan ­\nFebruary 15, 2016 10:31 AM\n### | 2600 Solutions, LLC\nFebruary 15, 2016 10:32 AM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan | 2600 Solutions, LLC\nFebruary 15, 2016 12:17 PM\n### A Look Into Fysbis: Sofacy’s Linux Backdoor | vyagers\nFebruary 15, 2016 3:17 PM\n### Russian Cyberespionage Group Uses Linux Trojan ­ LIFARS\nFebruary 15, 2016 5:08 PM\n### Ciberespías rusos utilizan troyano en Linux simple y efectivo | Adictec\nFebruary 15, 2016 9:10 PM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan ­ Micro Penguin\nFebruary 15, 2016 9:27 PM\n### A Look Into Fysbis: Sofacy’s Linux Backdoor – Palo Alto Networks Blog | Georgia 2600 Hackers irc.2600.net #GA2600\nFebruary 16, 2016 5:10 AM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan | Templar Shield\nFebruary 16, 2016 9:53 AM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan | AskIT\nFebruary 16, 2016 10:40 AM\n### Sofacy Linux бэкдор | Around Cyber\nFebruary 17, 2016 4:56 AM\n### Linux Fysbis Trojan, a weapon in the Pawn Storm's arsenalSecurity Affairs\nFebruary 17, 2016 4:59 AM\n### Linux Fysbis Trojan, a new weapon in the Pawn Storm’s arsenal ­ Systerity\nFebruary 17, 2016 1:45 PM\n### Linux Fysbis Trojan, a new weapon in the Pawn Storm’s arsenal ­ OSINFO\nFebruary 17, 2016 7:06 PM\n### HACKERS RUSOS UTILIZAN UN SENCILLO PERO EFECTIVO TROYANO PARA ATACAR LINUX | SR HADDEN CONSULTING GROUP\nFebruary 18, 2016 9:42 PM\n### Russian cyberspy group uses simple yet effective Linux Trojan | The Silicon Review\nFebruary 20, 2016 2:52 PM\n### Weekendowa Lektura 2016­02­20 – bierzcie i czytajcie | Zaufana Trzecia Strona\nFebruary 21, 2016 6:56 PM\n### FYSBIS分析报告：SOFACY的Linux后门 | z7y Blog\n\nFebruary 24, 2016 5:01 PM\n### What is this Fysbis Malware?
