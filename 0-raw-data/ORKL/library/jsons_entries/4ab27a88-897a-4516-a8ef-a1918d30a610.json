    "plain_text": "# DoD's 2021 China Military Power Report: How Advances in AI and Emerging Technologies Will Shape China’s Military\n\n**[cfr.org/blog/dods-2021-china-military-power-report-how-advances-ai-and-emerging-technologies-will-shape](https://www.cfr.org/blog/dods-2021-china-military-power-report-how-advances-ai-and-emerging-technologies-will-shape)**\n\nYesterday, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released its annual report on Chinese\nMilitary Power. The 2021 report demonstrates the growing challenge that China poses to\nU.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. China’s growing nuclear arsenal has received\n[most of the](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/11/03/china-nuclear-weapons-pentagon-report/) [media attention. Underneath the headlines, though, is an approach whereby](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/politics/china-military-nuclear.html)\nChina seeks to leverage emerging technologies and innovative operational concepts—for\nboth conventional and strategic operations—to become a leading military through an\napproach described as “intelligentized” warfare. According to the report, China “seeks to\ndominate technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution” (p. 145) because it\nwill help China become a world-class military. Below, we outline critical aspects of China’s\nmilitary modernization efforts referenced in the report, focusing particularly on developments\nrelated to defense innovation and emerging technologies.\n\n**China Connects Emerging Technology Leadership to Military Capabilities**\n\n[China believes that emerging technologies will shape and increase the speed of warfare,](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/july/hyperwar)\nmeaning future military success will require forces that are “mechanized, informatized, and\nintelligentized” (p. 89). The term “intelligentized” describes \"the PRC’s concept of future\nwarfare based on emerging and disruptive technologies, particularly AI” (p. 146). This\n\n\n-----\n\nincludes intelligent technologies, systems, and operational concepts such as attrition\nwarfare by intelligent swarms, cross-domain mobile warfare, AI-based space confrontation,\nand cognitive control operations,” that facilitate information processing and decision-making\non the battlefield.\n\nMore on:\n\n[China](https://www.cfr.org/asia/china)\n\n[Defense and Security](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security)\n\n[Defense Technology](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/defense-technology)\n\n[Technology and Innovation](https://www.cfr.org/economics/technology-and-innovation)\n\n[U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.cfr.org/search?keyword=U.S.+Department+of+Defense)\n\nChina is also updating its doctrine and warfighting plans to incorporate these capabilities.\nChina's Academy of Military Science (AMS) has a mandate to ensure “that the PLA’s\nwarfighting theory and doctrine fully capitalize on disruptive technologies like AI and\n[autonomous systems” (p. 148). Through an emphasis on emerging technologies, China](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/09/how-chinese-strategists-think-ai-will-power-military-leap-ahead/185409/)\nseeks to become a “global innovation superpower” (p. 145).\n\nNet Politics\n\n**CFR experts investigate the impact of information and communication technologies**\n**on security, privacy, and international affairs. 2-4 times weekly.**\n\n[View all newsletters >](https://link.cfr.org/join/66n/signup&hash=2d4c5929e9e04cc42f5cd375fb8dcfb1)\n\n## Digital and Cyberspace Update\n\n**Digital and Cyberspace Policy program updates on cybersecurity, digital trade,**\n**internet governance, and online privacy.

While details in the report are limited, it states:\n“In 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced a new milestone for PLA\nmodernization in 2027 broadly understood as the modernization of the PLA’s capabilities to\nbe networked into a system of systems for intelligentized warfare. If realized, the PLA’s 2027\nmodernization goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan\ncontingency” (p. I).\n\n**China’s Strategy for Achieving Defense Technology Leadership**\n\nChina’s mechanism for achieving defense technology leadership, according to the report,\nremains [civil-military fusion. This is China’s attempt to link technology advances in the private](https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/how-should-the-u-s-respond-to-chinas-military-civil-fusion-strategy/)\nsector with its military-industrial base. Both U.S. and Chinese officials have argued that key\ntechnologies that will shape the future of warfare, including artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,\nquantum, and biotechnology, are fundamentally dual use (or general purpose). The private\nsector is driving innovation around the world. For China, the connection between the private\nand public sectors will help determine future technological leadership. As the report\ndescribes, “Under Beijing’s MCF strategy, the PLA seeks to exploit China’s private sector\nachievements to further its force modernization plans” (p. 147). The report also discusses\nother Chinese technology leadership initiatives, such as foreign direct investment to acquire\ntechnology, talent recruitment, academic collaborations for research and development, and\nillicit acquisition through espionage.\n\n**China’s Priority Areas for Defense Investments in Emerging Technologies**\n\nThe report highlights (p. 148) specific emerging technologies that China is actively pursuing\nand illustrates their potential military applications, as the graphic below shows:\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin the AI and advanced robotics area highlighted in the graphic, an ongoing question is\nwhere and how militaries will use machine learning. The report outlines Chinese investments\nin machine learning for areas including tactical and strategic decision support and AI-enabled\nwargaming. The report also describes continuing Chinese investments in autonomous air,\nground, and naval systems, some with limited AI capabilities, and the use of AI for social\nmedia analysis and propaganda. The report also lays out basic and applied research\npriorities for China in the military AI space moving forward, such as “brain-inspired software\nand hardware, human-machine teaming, swarming, and decision making” (p. 146).\n\nMore on:\n\n[China](https://www.cfr.org/asia/china)\n\n[Defense and Security](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security)\n\n[Defense Technology](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/defense-technology)\n\n[Technology and Innovation](https://www.cfr.org/economics/technology-and-innovation)\n\n[U.S. Department of Defense](https://www.cfr.org/search?keyword=U.S.+Department+of+Defense)\n\n\n-----\n\nMore broadly, the above technologies demonstrate the military and economic areas that\nChina is prioritizing. China’s heavy research expenditures and its “focus on technological\nindependence and indigenous innovation” through policies such as Made in China 2025 and\n_China Standards 2035, has “positioned the PRC at, or near, the lead of numerous scientific_\n[fields”—worrying many in the United States (p.146).](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/21/us-china-tech-competition/)\n\nThe report emphasizes particular advancements China made in these domains in 2020, such\nas its allocation of around $85 million to AI research; its plans to expand its “2,000 km\nquantum-secure communication ground line” connecting Beijing and Shanghai to other cities,\nand to create a global, satellite-enabled version by 2030; and the People’s Liberation Army\nAir Force’s initial fielding of the DF-17, a hypersonic glide vehicle (pp. 60,146). The report\nrefers to cyber elsewhere—as a more mature capability already better integrated into the\nPLA.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls in China’s Military Development**\n\nThe report underscores how China is modernizing and advancing its military, and how the\ncurrent Chinese regime views defense technology and innovation leadership as a critical\npillar supporting their effort to create world-class warfighting capabilities. Specifically, China\ndirectly views its ability to harness and leverage emerging and disruptive technologies like AI\nas decisive for its ability to achieve strategic goals such as taking Taiwan. This report\nhighlights that the DoD is aware of and concerned by these initiatives, which appear to be\nsystematic, well-resourced, and clearly delineated. However, while the report references\nthese technologies, and how China plans to develop them, it lacks specific detail on how the\nPeople’s Liberation Army will use technological breakthroughs. Questions also remain about\nChina’s ability to operate these capabilities in combination, as the simultaneous integration of\nemerging technologies and traditional operations will be organizationally challenging. So\nwhile Chinese military power continues to grow, there is uncertainty about what role\nemerging technologies will play in future conflicts, and when.\n\n\n-----",
