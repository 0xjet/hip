Cobalt\n[Strike Team Servers were again the most detected C2 controller,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/defining-cobalt-strike-components)\nrepresenting 23.7% of the total C2 servers identified. Similar to\nlast year, Metasploit and Meterpreter represented the other top\nC2 servers identified by Recorded Future. TrickBot and QakBot\nwere also among the 5 most detected families.\n\n##### Top 5 Most Detected C2 Families\n\n**Family** **2021 C2s**\n\nCobalt Strike Team Servers 3691\n\nMeterpreter 396\n\nMetasploit 710\n\nQakBot 571\n\nTrickBot 468\n\n_Table 1: Top detected C2 infrastructure by total unique servers_\n\n##### Post-Exploitation Frameworks\n\nIt is difficult to estimate what percentage of any postexploitation frameworks we detected are used in legitimate red\nteaming operations, and which are used by criminal or espionage\nelements.

Despite\nfrequent breaks, the botnet was one of the most prolific and\nprofitable threats in 2019 and 2020. Although other operations,\nsuch as [TR distributor (ChaseLdr, TA577) or](https://tria.ge/210414-3ktty5rt6n) [TA551 (Shathak),](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/security-briefs/ta551-uses-sliver-red-team-tool-new-activity)\nattempted to fill the spam gap left by Emotet’s months-long\ndisappearance, TrickBot, QakBot, Bazar, IcedID, and Dridex\nall continued onward. All of them have been observed acting\nas precursors to ransomware; IcedID was [linked to Egregor](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/melting-unc2198-icedid-to-ransomware-operations.html)\ndeployments, TrickBot and Bazar [families have been](https://t.co/zulo3KrEP8?amp=1) [linked to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/wizard-spider-adversary-update/)\n[Ryuk and Conti use, Dridex has led to DoppelPaymer, and QakBot](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/dridex/)\n[has deployed ProLock and DoppelPaymer.](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/)\n\nSample over sample, the botnets varied in how many\nembedded C2 servers they referenced. TrickBot averaged 20\nC2 servers per sample configuration, while IcedID and Dridex\neach averaged 3 servers, and QakBot averaged a much larger\n142 C2 IP addresses per configuration. Resurfaced versions of\nEmotet averaged 20 servers per configuration.\n\n**Top 5 Most Prolific Botnet Families**\n\n**Family** **2021 C2s**\n\nTrickBot 571\n\nQakBot 516\n\nBazar/Baza Family 405\n\nDridex 383\n\nIcedID 332\n\n_Table 3: Most common botnet families by C2 servers detected in 2021_\n\nThe botnets vary greatly in terms of active operational size;\nsampling concurrently active servers from Recorded Future data\nshowed TrickBot maintained 132 C2 servers at a given time,\nBazar peaked at 99, while IcedID had 83, QakBot had 72, and\nDridex had 32 active C2 servers. This measure does not account\nfor how the operators divide the infrastructure but is based on\nobservable operational size indexed within the Recorded Future\nPlatform.\n\n\n##### QakBot (QBot)\n\nQakBot contains the largest list of C2s per sample, as shown\nby data from the configuration file [included in the malware’s](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/us/threat-research-us/qakbot-reducing-its-on-disk-artifacts/)\nresource section. QakBot’s use of higher TCP ports partially\nhindered proactive scanning; roughly 3,200 total IP addresses\nwere observed through configuration extraction, where 516\nservers were observed via proactive scanning. Infrastructure\nthroughout 2021 has also been divided across affiliates; for\nexample, QakBot samples deployed by the [TR distributor](https://tria.ge/210414-3ktty5rt6n)\n(ChaseLdr, TA577) and the [Obama affiliate shared 95% of the](https://tria.ge/210413-n95xxblbte)\nsame infrastructure, distinct from the 95% infrastructure overlap\nbetween the [Biden and](https://tria.ge/210326-wpggpzyqna) [Clinton affiliates. The](https://tria.ge/210412-96w2yz2fq2) [Abc affiliate](https://tria.ge/210413-bqtgddtdx6)\noperated on a relative island, with only 8% overlap with the Biden\n[and Clinton infrastructure. Previously, TR and Biden affiliates had](https://tria.ge/210224-2gelcsll4j)\na large overlap in infrastructure; this cycling is likely to improve\nresiliency across the operation.\n\n##### TrickBot\n\nTrickBot’s large volume of infrastructure for 2021 is partially\naccounted for by the botnet splitting its infrastructure into 2\ndistinct branches. Each branch was built by distinct server\ntypes in early 2021, before using identical but distinct C2\nnodes beginning in March 2021. Recorded Future’s visibility\nindicates the “original branch” serviced TrickBot clients while\nthe “secondary branch” was used by TrickBot operators or highly\ntrusted affiliates. The shift is likely a resiliency effort: TrickBot\noperators can continue spamming operations via a secondary\nbotnet branch, even if the more used one gets taken down or\nblocked based on the volume of infections.\n\n##### Bazar Family\n\nBoth BazarLoader (YerLoader, BazaLoader, and KEGTAP) and\nBazarBackdoor (Syndet, BEERBOT) often share infrastructure\nor deploy similar server configurations, leading us to list them\ntogether. Although the family can and originally did use Emercoin\nDNS (EmerDNS) .bazar as primary/backup domains for command\nand control, operators have often relied on more straightforward\nIPv4 addresses during 2021. The Bazar families, more so than\nothers listed here, continually evolved their server software,\ndeploying multiple server configurations simultaneously during\n2021, likely in attempts to evade detection.\n\n|Top 5 Most Prolific Botnet Families|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Family|2021 C2s|\n|TrickBot|571|\n|QakBot|516|\n|Bazar/Baza Family|405|\n|Dridex|383|\n|IcedID|332|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Dridex\n\nIn comparison, Dridex has a much smaller list of hardcoded\n[C2s in its respective configurations. Each Dridex affiliate uses a](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2020-CTI-008.pdf)\n[different configuration file embedded in Dridex’s main payload.](https://countuponsecurity.com/tag/dridex-malware-analysis/)\nThe affiliate IDs are regularly rotated or aged off, making it\ndifficult to track customers or methods used for distribution over\ntime. Dridex has regularly updated its payload to make it more\nstealthy, but there are no indications that it did the same with its\ninfrastructure in the wake of Emotet’s takedown.\n\n##### IcedID (BokBot)\n\nUnlike other botnets, IcedID does not openly track its clients\nor users, although we believe its developers [operate under an](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/melting-unc2198-icedid-to-ransomware-operations.html)\naffiliate model. IcedID infrastructure is also less mature in its\noperational security, continuing to use the same pool of servers\n[for its operations despite the publication of methods to ID the](https://t.co/otrDnnBlvh?amp=1)\nservers. Although IcedID effectively generates infections, it does\nnot display the same level of operational security as the other\nfamilies mentioned.\n\n##### Emotet\n\nEmotet’s return has rightly caused concern among security\nresearchers. Within 24 hours of new Emotet [samples being](https://cyber.wtf/2021/11/15/guess-whos-back/)\n[loaded by TrickBot, the botnet began spamming. Within a week,](https://intel471.com/blog/emotet-is-back-2021)\n[a second branch was established to service more global spam](https://tria.ge/211118-yptt8sadf7)\noperations. There have been 40 positively identified Emotet\nC2s derived from the samples across [both epochs, with an](https://intel471.com/blog/emotet-returns-december-2021)\nadditional 45 servers that share server patterns that will likely\nbe used as Tier 1 servers by Emotet. There have been at least\n4 servers observed hosting both Dridex and Emotet Tier 1\ncontroller software. While the total count is not greater than\nother botnets mentioned here, the infrastructure creation rate\nindicates the operators have ambitions to return Emotet to its\nformer prominence and power.\n\n\n#### Global Scale\n\nWe observed the creation of C2 infrastructure on 1,650\nhosting providers across 130 different countries. While this\nrepresents a majority of global geography, the abused servers\naccount for only a small percentage of the total AS operators,\n[which exceeds 60,000 providers. The data indicates the largest](https://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/)\nhosting providers are the most abused for C2 hosting; 20 AS\noperators (12% of total ASNs observed) had more than 100 C2\nservers detected on them during 2021.\n\n  - The US hosted 4,654 C2 servers in 2021; China was\n\nsecond with 1,949, and Germany was third with 629.\n\n  - 858 AS operators (52% of total ASNs observed) were\n\nobserved hosting 1 C2 server during 2021.\n\n  - 24 countries of the 130 observed hosting C2 servers\n\nhosted only C2 1 server during 2021.\n\n  - While Recorded Future observed 1,630 unique AS\n\noperators hosting C2 servers during 2021, the heavy\nmajority were observed hosting 100 or fewer C2s.\n\n  - 1,454 AS providers (88% of total ASNs observed) hosted\n\nfewer than 10 C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Most common countries based on total C2 servers detected in 2021 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n**Top 10 C2 Hosting Providers By Volume**\n\n**Hosting Provider** **ASN** **Country**\n\nDigital Ocean AS14061 United States\n\nChoopa, LLC AS20473 United States\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

The most\ncommonly observed family on Digital Ocean was Cobalt Strike,\nwith 167 servers identified. The next largest was Choopa LLC\n(recently renamed the Constant Company), a Virtual Private\nServer provider operating out of the US, while the owner of the\nmost C2s observed in 2020 (Amazon.com Inc.) dropped to third\nin 2021.\n\nWhile these hosting providers accounted for the largest\nnumber of C2 servers, the C2 servers represented a minuscule\npercentage of total number of servers under their jurisdiction.\nThe table below highlights the 10 providers with the highest\npercentage of C2 servers compared to their total holdings.

In response to\n2020 takedown attempts, TrickBot’s operators hardened their\ninfrastructure to include more global VPS servers, in contrast\n[to their previous reliance on compromised MikroTik routers. We](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/trickbot-is-dead-long-live-trickbot/)\nanticipate the lessons learned from action against TrickBot and\nEmotet will lead to increased reliance on compromised devices,\n[regular recycling of infrastructure, and the use of more resilient](https://intel471.com/blog/emotet-is-back-2021)\ntraffic encryption methods.\n\nWe also believe that similar methods will be employed by\nCobalt Strike users, to protect Team Servers from the prying eyes\nof researchers. This will likely result in the dropping of traffic from\nknown scanning engines and the use of redirects to mask the\nlocation of the Team Server (or other C2 nodes). This trend has\nlikely already begun; BlackBerry’s findings based on extracting\nconfigurations and internet scanning, identified roughly twice as\nmany Team Servers as scanning alone. As internet scanning has\n[become table stakes for intelligence providers, adversaries and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/scandalous-external-detection-using-network-scan-data-and-automation)\nred team operators have taken notice. We believe this is due to\nimproved insulation of the Team Servers.\n\nFinally, we expect the C2 environment to continue to diversify.\nAs new malware families and C2 frameworks are released, we\nanticipate a portion of them will be aware of threat intelligence\nmeasures to scan and detect their servers. This will likely\nlead to partially decreased efficacy for threat intelligence\nscanning efforts in the short term but will result in new creative\nmethodologies in the medium to long term. The detection catand-mouse game will continue, with both sides continuing to\ninnovate to thwart the other.\n\n\n#### Mitigations and Recommendations\n\nTo help safeguard systems, we advise the following\nmitigations:\n\n  - Use the Recorded Future Platform to help identify\n\nactively exploited vulnerabilities and CVEs that\nhave been positively associated with ransomware\nvariants, which can help with patch management and\nprioritization.\n\n  - Keep systems and software up to date and have a\n\nreliable and tested backup method.\n\n  - Exposed RDP servers are abused by threat actors to\n\ngain initial access into a target’s network. If remote\naccess solutions are crucial to daily operations, all\nremote access services (such as Citrix or RDP) should be\nimplemented with multi-factor authentication.\n\n  - Password-protect sensitive files using strong, complex\n\npasswords.\n\n  - Detection in Depth\n\n  - Proactive detection creates an advantage for defenders,\n\ngiving them preparatory time to ensure additional fileand network-based detections are in place.\n\n  - Employ detection-in-depth for common open-source\n\ntooling via correlation searches and Sigma queries in\nSIEMs for suspicious behaviors, YARA for suspicious file\ncontents, and Snort for suspicious or malicious network\ntraffic.\n\n  - The detections for each family show the increased use of\n\nopen-source tools beyond just the families that get major\npublicity. Prioritize these families for network and hostbased detection in enterprise environments.\n\n  - External network detections are only part of the\n\n[detection equation; detection-in-depth methodologies,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borfuQGrB8g&ab_channel=SANSDigitalForensicsandIncidentResponse)\n[such as calculating the standard deviation of beaconing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-zwwLLMuDU)\n[intervals or using YARA for memory inspection, can aid in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eETUi-AZYgc&ab_channel=BlackHillsInformationSecurity)\nthe identification of malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\n\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\n\nintelligence agency experience.
