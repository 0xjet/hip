The most exploited product\ntypes were operating systems (OS) (19), followed by browsers (11), security, IT, and\nnetwork management products (10), and mobile OS (6).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe purpose of this report is to share insights from Mandiant's analysis of 2022 zero-day\nexploitation. Mandiant considers a zero-day to be a vulnerability that was exploited in the\nwild before a patch was made publicly available. This report examines zero-day exploitation\nidentified in Mandiant's original research, combined with breach investigation findings, and\nreporting from open sources, focusing on zero-days exploited by named groups. While we\nbelieve the referenced open sources are reliable as used in this analysis, we cannot\nindependently confirm the findings of some sources. Technical details of the vulnerabilities\nare not included; rather, we discuss overall takeaways from threat actor activity, vulnerability\ntrends, and targeted vendors and products. Due to the ongoing discovery of past incidents\nthrough digital forensic investigations, we expect that this research will remain dynamic and\nmay be supplemented in the future.\n\n## Overall Count\n\nMandiant tracked 55 zero-day vulnerabilities that we judge were exploited in 2022. While this\ncount is 26 fewer than the record-breaking 81 zero-days exploited in 2021, it was still\nsignificantly higher than in 2020 and years prior (Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Confirmed exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in the wild (2012–2022)\n[We previously predicted that zero-day vulnerabilities would continue to be exploited at a](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-days-exploited-2021)\nsignificantly higher rate than in the 2010s, and the 55 zero-days identified this year indicate a\ncontinuation of that trend. A number of factors may have contributed to the zero-day count in\n2020 dipping, then tripling in 2021. Pandemic related disruptions in 2020 potentially\ninterrupted reporting and disclosure workflows for vendors, reduced capacity for defenders to\ndetect exploitation activity and, may have encouraged attackers to reserve novel exploits\nexcept in the most important cases. Moreover, in 2021 Apple and Android disclosures\nincluded more exploitation information.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe anticipate that the longer term trendline for zero-day exploitation will continue to rise, with\nsome fluctuation from year to year. Attackers seek stealth and ease of exploitation, both of\nwhich zero-days can provide. While the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities is a resourceintensive endeavor and successful exploitation is not guaranteed, the total number of\nvulnerabilities disclosed and exploited has continued to grow, the types of targeted software,\nincluding Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud solutions, continue to evolve, and the\n[variety of actors exploiting them has expanded.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/zero-day-exploitation-demonstrates-access-to-money-not-skill)\n\n## State-Sponsored Groups Continue to Drive Exploitation\n\nWe tracked 13 zero-days in 2022 that we assess with moderate to high confidence were\nexploited by cyber espionage groups. Consistent with previous years, Chinese statesponsored groups continue to lead exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities with seven zerodays exploited or over 50% of all zero-days we could confidently link to known cyber\nespionage actors or motivations. Notably, at a slightly elevated rate compared to previous\nyears, we identified two zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited by suspected North\nKorean actors.\n\nWe identified four zero-day vulnerabilities for which we could attribute exploitation by\nfinancially motivated threat actors, a quarter of the total 16 zero-days for which we could\ndetermine a motivation for exploitation. 75% of these instances appear to be linked to\nransomware operations, consistent with 2021 and 2019 data in which ransomware groups\nexploited the highest volume of zero-day vulnerabilities compared to other financially\nmotivated actors. However, the overall count and proportion of the total of financially\nmotivated zero-day exploitation declined in 2022 compared to recent years.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Identified zero-days exploited in 2022 by motivation\n\n\n-----\n\n## Oops They Did It Again: Chinese Threat Groups Lead Zero-Day Exploitation\n\nMandiant and open sources attributed 13 zero-days exploited in 2022 to likely statesponsored groups, representing over 80% of the total for which we could identify the\nmotivation of the actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Zero-days exploited by espionage actors in 2022\n\n### China\n\nIn 2022, Chinese espionage groups exploited seven zero-day vulnerabilities, more than we\nwere able to attribute to any other state sponsor. Compared to the watershed year in 2021 in\nwhich Chinese state-sponsored threat groups exploited at least eight separate zero-days,\nChinese exploitation slightly decreased in 2022. Three campaigns in 2022 were particularly\nnotable due to the involvement of multiple groups, expansive targeting, and focus on\nenterprise networking and security devices: multiple groups exploiting CVE-2022-30190 (aka\nFollina) in early 2022, and the 2022 exploitation of FortiOS vulnerabilities CVE-2022-42475\nand CVE-2022-41328.\n\n### China Continues to Focus on Network Devices\n\n[In late 2022, we observed a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat group exploit CVE-](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/chinese-actors-exploit-fortios-flaw)\n2022-42475, a vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiOS SSL-VPN. We have some evidence to\nsuggest the exploitation began as early as October 2022 based on netflow data that revealed\ninterest in a European government entity and a managed service provider located in Africa.\n[This activity continues China's pattern of exploiting internet-facing devices, especially those](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-apt-actors-leverage-bypass-techniques-pulse-secure-zero-day)\nused for managed security purposes (e.g., firewalls, IPS/IDS appliances etc.). We anticipate\nthis tactic will continue to be the intrusion vector of choice for well-resourced Chinese\ngroups.\n\nDuring our investigation of this activity, we identified a new malware tracked as\n\"BOLDMOVE.\" We uncovered both a Windows and a Linux variant of BOLDMOVE,\nwhich is specifically designed to run on FortiGate Firewalls. With BOLDMOVE, the\nattackers not only developed an exploit, but malware that shows an in-depth\nunderstanding of systems, services, logging, and undocumented proprietary formats.\n\nIn mid-2022, [Mandiant investigated the exploitation and deployment of malware across](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/fortinet-malware-ecosystem)\nmultiple Fortinet solutions, activity which we attribute to UNC3886. With initial access to a\npublicly exposed FortiManager device, UNC3886 exploited a directory traversal zero-day\nvulnerability in FortiOS (CVE-2022-41328) to write files to FortiGate firewall disks outside of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe normal bounds allowed with shell access. UNC3886 is a suspected Chinese cyber\nespionage group to which we also attributed the novel VMware ESXi hypervisor malware\nframework disclosed in September 2022.\n\n### A Digital Quartermaster?\n\nAs early as March 2022, Mandiant identified suspected Chinese activity exploiting CVE2022-30190 (aka Follina) in Microsoft Diagnostics Tool (MDST) that would allow an attacker\nto execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is exploited primarily through convincing users to\nopen Word documents; it can also be exploited through other vectors that process URLs. We\nobserved at least three separate activity sets exploit Follina as a zero-day in support of\noperations against public and private organizations in three distinct regions. Multiple\nseparate campaigns may indicate that the zero-day was distributed to multiple suspected\nChinese espionage clusters via a digital quartermaster.\n\nMandiant identified an activity cluster tracked as UNC3658 leverage samples exploiting\nCVE-2022-30190 likely targeting the Philippine Government from March to May 2022.\nIn April 2022, we observed two additional samples exploiting CVE-2022-30190 that\nappeared to have been leveraged against telecommunications and business service\nproviders in South Asia. We track this activity as UNC3347.\nWe identified a third cluster, UNC3819, likely exploiting CVE-2022-30190 against\norganizations in Belarus and Russia in May 2022. At least two samples used lure\ncontent related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nMandiant noted previous waves of the progressive adoption of the same exploit among\nChinese espionage groups prior to the release of a public patch (e.g., the widespread\n\"ProxyLogon\" campaign in early 2021) which potentially indicates the existence of a shared\ndevelopment and logistics infrastructure and possibly a centralized coordinating entity.\nMandiant research dating back to 2013 has likewise suggested a logistical support function\nor quartermaster supporting Chinese cyber espionage groups.\n\n### North Korea\n\nNotably, at a slightly elevated rate compared to previous years, we identified two zero-day\nvulnerabilities that were exploited by North Korean actors, including some operations that\noverlap with TEMP.Hermit whose activities are reported as \"Operation Dream Job'' or\nOperation AppleJeus by Google TAG. These clusters reportedly used the same exploit kit to\nexploit Google Chrome zero-day CVE-2022-0609 in February 2022 to target the media, hightech, and financial sectors. In November 2022, Mandiant identified a tracked cluster of\nactivity that had targeted the high-tech sector in South Korea with spear-phishing emails\ncontaining malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2022-41128, a zero-day vulnerability in\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Windows Server. Indicators associated with this phishing activity are consistent\n[with what TAG reported and tracks as APT37, but we are unable to confirm if this cluster is](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/internet-explorer-0-day-exploited-by-north-korean-actor-apt37/)\ntied to APT37 at this time.\n\n### Russia\n\nWe observed two instances of Russian state zero-day exploitation, when APT28 exploited\nCVE-2022-30190 (aka Follina) in early June 2022, and the months-long campaign exploiting\nMicrosoft Exchange vulnerability CVE-2023-23397, activity which Mandiant tracks as\n[UNC4697 and which open sources have attributed to APT28. The campaign exploiting CVE-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-outlook-zero-day-used-by-russian-hackers-since-april-2022/)\n2023-23397 has been ongoing since at least April 2022 and targeted government, logistics,\noil/gas, defense, and transportation industries located in Poland, Ukraine, Romania, and\nTurkey. The increased focus on disrupting Russian cyber operations since Russia’s invasion\nof Ukraine may have discouraged Russian operators from widely using valuable zero-day\nexploits for access they expected to lose quickly. While exploitation of CVE-2022-30190 (aka\nFollina) was likely opportunistic, taking advantage of the gap between disclosure and patch\nrelease, the use of CVE-2023-23397 suggests that the operators perceived the targets of\nthis campaign to be of high intelligence value. Based on our research, Russian threat actors\nhave exploited two zero-days per year since 2019, with the trend continuing into 2022.\n\n### Commercial Vendors\n\nCommercial vendors again made headlines in 2022 during which tool suites or exploitation\nframeworks utilized by their customers accounted for three zero-days, or approximately one\nquarter of all vulnerabilities attributed to state-sponsored espionage activity. Despite recent\nstruggles of some high-profile vendors, we assess with moderate confidence that there\ncontinues to be a very active and vibrant market for third-party malware, particularly\n[surveillance tools, across the globe. Multiple](https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/recast-dual-use-regulation-eu-introduces-new-export-controls-on-spyware/) [Western](https://apnews.com/article/technology-poland-warsaw-spyware-5bb2bfc402747e1fa153a5e7eb107245) [nations have moved to restrict](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmbag/the-us-crackdown-on-spyware-vendors-is-only-beginning)\ndomestic companies and ex-government employees from some participation in these\nactivities; however, there is a significant base of expertise outside the countries moving to\nrestrict vendors of these capabilities. As a result, we judge that these restrictions will only\nhave a limited effect on the overall market.\n\nWe observed at least three separate zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in 2022 by tools,\nsuites, or exploitation frameworks developed by at least three distinct commercial vendors.\n\n[Consistent with previous activity, Candiru reportedly exploited one zero-day (CVE-](https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/the-return-of-candiru-zero-days-in-the-middle-east/)\n2022-2294) targeting Google's Chrome browser in 2022.\n\nAccording to open sources, the Candiru-developed Chrome zero-day was used in\nan operation that compromised a website used by employees of a news agency,\n[which is consistent with the use of previous Candiru exploits to target journalists,](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/)\nand it primarily affected users located in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo European malware vendors also reportedly exploited one zero-day vulnerability\neach: [Variston, identified by Google TAG targeting Mozilla's Firefox browser (CVE-](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-details-on-commercial-spyware-vendor-variston/)\n[2022-26485), and DSIRF, which targeted Microsoft Windows Server (CVE-2022-](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/27/untangling-knotweed-european-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits/)\n22047).\n\nDSIRF's zero-day exploit was reportedly leveraged to target law firms, banks, and\nstrategic consultancies in countries including Austria, the United Kingdom, and\nPanama.\n\n## Financially Motivated Exploitation Less Prominent in 2022\n\nThough the proportion of zero-days exploited in financially motivated operations declined in\n2022, n-day vulnerability exploitation, the exploitation of vulnerabilities that have already\nreceived patches, remains one of the most frequently observed initial infection vectors in\nMandiant Incident Response and Managed Defense investigations of ransomware and/or\nextortion incidents. In 2022, we identified four zero-day vulnerabilities as likely exploited in\nfinancially motivated operations, mostly linked to ransomware activity.\n\n[In one instance, an actor who ultimately deployed Lorenz ransomware reportedly went](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/lorenz-ransomware-chiseling-in/)\nout of the way to avoid detection while exploiting a novel remote code execution (RCE)\nflaw on Mitel's MiVoice Connect VOIP appliance (CVE-2022-29499).\nOpen sources [indicated that the Magniber ransomware group exploited CVE-2022-](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/magniber-ransomware-switches-to-javascript-targeting-home-users-with-fake-software-updates/)\n41091, a vulnerability in the Mark of the Web (MoTW) feature in Microsoft Windows 11,\nas a zero-day in September 2022. Separately, open sources [reported that the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-magniber)\nMagniber group also exploited CVE-2022-44698, a different MoTW vulnerability, in\nOctober 2022, before the vulnerability was patched by Microsoft in December.\nWe observed UNC2633, a distribution threat cluster that delivers emails containing\nmalicious attachments or links that lead to malware payloads, exploit CVE-2022-30190\n(aka Follina) in at least three instances in early June 2022 before the patch was\nreleased. In at least two of those instances, UNC2633 used the zero-day vulnerability\nto distribute QAKBOT on the victims' networks.\n\nThere are multiple factors that may have contributed to this decline. 2021 was an exceptional\nyear for zero day exploitation across the board, and at least one significant campaign\n[associated with extortion operations utilized four Accellion FTA vulnerabilities together. Some](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion)\nof the most prolific ransomware groups that exploited zero-days in previous years had\noperators based in Russia or Ukraine, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022\nmay have disrupted this criminal ecosystem and contributed to a decline in zero-day use.\nThe [overall decline in ransomware payments in 2022 may have also reduced the capacity of](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-ransomware-revenue-down-as-victims-refuse-to-pay/)\noperators to acquire or develop zero-days.\n\n## You. Will. Be. Popular.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Zero-Days Exploited by Vendor\n\nThe technologies most frequently affected by zero-days in 2022 reflect a similar distribution\nas years prior and again overwhelmingly focus on the three largest vendors whose\ntechnology is widely adopted across the world. Microsoft (18), Google (10), and Apple (9)\nwere the most commonly exploited vendors for the third year in a row.\n\nWe judge that threat actors most often pursue zero-day vulnerabilities in such ubiquitous\nproducts due to the wide access that exploitation of these products can provide. We also\nobserved more unique vendors or niche products that were targeted, which may indicate a\nfocus by some threat actors on those systems based on specific targets or victims of interest,\nand those technologies being a particularly useful attack vector in those specific cases.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Zero-days exploited by vendor in 2022\n\n### Zero-Days Exploited by Product Type\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most exploited products were operating systems (OS) (19); followed by browsers (11);\nsecurity, IT, and network management products (10); and mobile OS (6).\n\nDesktop operating system exploitation continues to primarily affect Windows, with 15\nzero-days exploiting this product in 2022. In comparison, macOS was exploited in only\nfour out of 19 identified OS zero-days.\nBrowser exploitation saw an even higher bias toward its top target, Chrome, with 9 out\nof 11 browser zero-day vulnerabilities, compared to Firefox's two. This trend reinforces\nour judgment that popular technologies are the most desirable targets to threat actors\nsince Chrome is the browser choice of the majority of web users, estimated at about\n[60–65% use globally.](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share)\nTen zero-day vulnerabilities, nearly 20% of all zero-days we identified in 2022, affected\nsecurity, IT, and network management products (Table 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Zero-days exploited by product type in 2022\n\n### Mobile Operating Systems\n\n\n-----\n\nWe tracked six mobile OS zero-day vulnerabilities as exploited in 2022. Given that global OS\nmarket shares are [increasingly composed of mobile OS, we anticipate that vulnerabilities](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share)\naffecting mobile devices will continue to rise compared to other categories. However,\ndesktop technologies likely will remain of interest to threat actors given their role in enterprise\nnetworks and access to critical data. Threat actors targeting a specific person may be more\nlikely to seek mobile OS exploitation, while attackers targeting organizations may seek\ndesktop or other frequent enterprise technologies.\n\n### Gaining an Edge, on the Edge\n\n[Threat actors, particularly those seeking to remain undetected, likely target security, network,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-chinese-persist-sonicwall)\nand IT management or \"edge infrastructure\" products because they are always internetfacing and often do not host E/XDR or detection solutions. Threat actors may gain an edge\nagainst defenders by not moving within heavily monitored areas of targeted infrastructure.\n\nThese devices are attractive targets for multiple reasons. First, they are accessible to the\ninternet, and if the attacker has an exploit, they can gain access to a network without\nrequiring any victim interaction. This allows the attacker to control the timing of the operation\nand can decrease the chances of detection. Malware running on an internet-connected\ndevice can also enable lateral movement further into a network and enable command and\ncontrol by tunneling commands in and data out of a network.\n\nIt is important to note that many of these types of products do not offer a simple mechanism\nto view which processes are running on the device's operating systems. These products are\noften intended to inspect network traffic, searching for anomalies as well as signs of\nmalicious behavior, but they are often not inherently protected themselves.\n\nTable 1: 2022 Security, IT, and Network Management Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\n\n**2022 Security, IT, and Network Management Zero-Day**\n**Vulnerabilities**\n\n**CVE** **Product**\n\nCVE-2022-1040 Sophos Firewall\n\nCVE-2022-3236 Sophos Firewall\n\nCVE-2022-20821 Cisco IOS\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE-2022-26871 Trend Micro Apex Central\n\nCVE-2022-40139 Trend Micro Apex One\n\nCVE-2021-35247 SolarWinds Serv-u\n\nCVE-2022-28810 Zoho ManageEngine\n\nCVE-2022-27518 Application Delivery and Load\nBalancer\n\nCVE-2022-42475 Fortinet FortiOS\n\nCVE-2022-41328 Fortinet FortiOS\n\n## Exploitation Consequences\n\nAlmost all 2022 zero-day vulnerabilities (53) were exploited for the purpose of achieving\neither (primarily remote) code execution or gaining elevated privileges, both of which are\nconsistent with most threat actor objectives. While information disclosure vulnerabilities can\noften gain attention due to customer and user data being at risk of disclosure and misuse,\nthe extent of attacker actions from these vulnerabilities is often limited. Alternatively, elevated\nprivileges and code execution can lead to lateral movement across networks, causing\neffects beyond the initial access vector.\n\n## Don't You Forget About Me: Undue Focus on New Vulnerabilities Can Fatigue Defenders\n\nAlthough uncommon, vulnerabilities may be publicly disclosed with workaround guidance\ninstead of an official fix. When this does occur, the delay between initial disclosure and patch\navailability can result in defender fatigue. Temporary workarounds, which are often not as\nreliable as official patches, can also create a false sense of security. Additionally, temporary\nworkarounds can often degrade functionality which limits deployment. This can create\ncorresponding opportunities for threat actors, as demonstrated in the case of the\nProxyNotShell vulnerability chain.\n\nThe two zero-day vulnerabilities that made up ProxyNotShell, CVE-2022-41040 and CVE2022-41082, were discussed heavily in security reporting and media coverage. The\nvulnerabilities, targeting Microsoft Exchange, were named after the ProxyShell widespread\nexploitation campaign in 2021 due to the similarity in how ProxyNotShell also exploited\n\n\n-----\n\nExchange servers. At the time of disclosure at the end of September 2022, Microsoft\nprovided a temporary workaround, but did not release a patch. Microsoft released a patch for\nthe vulnerabilities in early November 2022, more than a month after the initial disclosure and\nafter media focus had subsided. However, security researchers continued to identify\n[exploitation of the vulnerabilities, including in incidents reported in December that utilized a](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/ransomware-attackers-bypass-microsoft-mitigation-proxynotshell-exploit)\nnew ransomware called Play which circumvented the workaround published in September.\nThe lag between disclosure and patch potentially contributed to many systems remaining\nunpatched months later. Moreover, because the earlier workarounds released at disclosure\nwere consistently proven to be faulty, unpatched systems remained easy targets for threat\nactors.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe expect that threat actors will continue to pursue the discovery and exploitation of zerodays, as these vulnerabilities provide significant tactical advantages in ease and success\nrates of exploitation, as well as stealth.\n\nHowever, we anticipate that wider migration to cloud products could alter the expected trends\ndue to differing patching and disclosure approaches. Cloud vendors can create patches and\ndeploy them on behalf of customers, which greatly reduces patch times and therefore\ndecreases risks of post-disclosure exploitation. However, many cloud vendors have\nhistorically chosen not to publicly disclose vulnerabilities in cloud products as reliably as\nother product types. This could affect zero-day disclosure counts as known to the public.\n\n## Implications for Defenders\n\nAs the vendors and products targeted by zero-days continue to diversify, organizations must\nefficiently and effectively prioritize patching to their specific circumstances to sufficiently\nmitigate risk. In addition to risk ratings, we suggest that organizations should analyze the\nfollowing: types of actors targeting their specific geography or industry, common malware,\nfrequent tactics, techniques, and procedures of malicious actors, and products used by an\norganization that provide the largest attack surfaces, all of which can inform resource\nallocation to mitigate risk.\n\nGiven that Microsoft, Google, and Apple continue to be the most exploited vendors, and that\ntheir presence is ubiquitous, proper configuration for these products is critical, including\nfollowing best practices such as network segmentation and least privilege. But despite the\nprevalence of exploitation of the top three vendors, security teams must still weigh the risks\nfrom beyond those vendors and stay vigilant across their entire attack surface. Between\n2021 and 2022, approximately 25–30% of zero-day vulnerabilities affected vendors beyond\nthe top three and organizations must still allocate sufficient resources to defending these\ntechnologies.\n\n\n-----",
