The actor exclusively targeted entities in the Decentralized\nFinance (DeFi) industry in recently observed campaigns. The activity Proofpoint associates\nwith TA4563 has some overlap with activity publicly associated with a group referred to\nas [DeathStalker and](https://securelist.com/what-did-deathstalker-hide-between-two-ferns/99616/) [EvilNum. The activity described in this report has some overlap with](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\n[EvilNum activity publicly reported by Zscaler in June 2022.](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/return-evilnum-apt-updated-ttps-and-new-targets)\n\nThe identified campaigns delivered an updated version of the EvilNum backdoor using a\nvaried mix of ISO, Microsoft Word and Shortcut (LNK) files in late 2021 and early 2022,\npresumably as a method of testing the efficacy of the delivery methods. This malware can be\nused for reconnaissance, data theft, and to deploy additional payloads.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\n### 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint observed the first campaign in December 2021. The messages purported to be\nrelated to financial trading platform registration or related documents. The initial campaign\nobserved included the attempted delivery of Microsoft Word documents responsible for the\nattempted installation of the updated version of the EvilNum backdoor.\n\nThese messages used a remote template document that analysts observed attempting to\ncommunicate with domains to install several LNK loader components, leveraging wscript to\nload the EvilNum payload, and a JavaScript payload that was ultimately installed on the\nuser's host. These lures contained a financial theme, suggesting on one occasion that the\nintended victim needed to submit “proof of ownership of missing documents”.\n\nProofpoint identified the following post-infection related domains:\n\nmailgunltd[.]com\nazuredllservices[.]com\nofficelivecloud[.]com\n\n### Early 2022\n\nThe group continued to target financial entities with a variation on the original email\ncampaign, attempting to deliver multiple OneDrive URLs that contained either an ISO or .LNK\nattachment. In identified campaigns, the actor used financial lures to get the recipient to\nlaunch the EvilNum payload. Messages purported to be, for example:\n\nFrom: “Viktoria Helle” <viktoria.helle79@zingamail[.]uk>\n\n\n-----\n\nSubject: Re: Reminder to submit your proof of identity and address\n\nCampaigns continued to target specific European financial and investment entities.\n\nSubsequent campaigns included the delivery of a compressed .LNK file directly as an\nadditional attempt to install EvilNum.\n\n### Mid 2022\n\nAs the threat actor maintained consistent targeting and victimology, the methodology again\nchanged. In mid-2022 campaigns, TA4563 delivered Microsoft Word documents to attempt to\ndownload a remote template.\n\nMessages purported to be, for example:\n```\nFrom: \"19steeven \" <arfeuille19@gmail[.]com>\n\nSubject: Fwd: KOT4X - Proof of ownership (urgent missing document)\n\nAttachment: steve kot4x.docx\n\n```\nThe attached document was responsible for generating traffic to http://outlookfnd[.]com, a\nlikely actor-controlled domain responsible for the EvilNum payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Attached Word document delivering EvilNum._\n\n## EvilNum Details\n\nPrevious versions of EvilNum publicly reported by security organizations include both a\nJavaScript component and C# component of the backdoor. Proofpoint did not observe a\nJavaScript component in recent campaigns and analyzed the C# component observed in\nmultiple recent campaigns.\n\nEach campaign is highly fenced; the malware only allows one download per IP address to\nensure only the target host can retrieve the final payload. The initial stage LNK loader is\nresponsible for executing PowerShell via cmd.exe, this then downloads two different payloads\nfrom the initial host (e.g. infntio[.]com).\n\nThe first payload is responsible for executing two PowerShell scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: PowerShell script examples._\n\nThe first is used to decrypt a PNG and follows logic to restart the infection chain. The second,\nlarger PowerShell script loads C# code dynamically and sends screenshots to a commandand-control server (C2). This C# application then executes another PowerShell command:\n\n/c start /min \\”\\” powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -windowstyle hidden -c\n\\”&hpfde.exe” –v=[Random]\n\nSeveral applications are executed depending on what antivirus software – either Avast, AVG,\nor Windows Defender – is found on the host. The malware will try and call multiple\nexecutables likely already on the host machine (e.g. TechToolkit.exe and nvapiu.exe). The\nmalware execution chain will change to best evade detection from the identified antivirus\nengine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Executables called depending on the antivirus engine identified._\n\nThe second payload contains two encrypted blobs. The first is decrypted to an executable,\n(e.g. hpfde.exe) and the second to a TMP file (e.g. devXYXY5.tmp). The initial executable\nreads and decrypts the TMP file to load a 53KB shellcode file resulting in a final decrypted\nand decompressed PE file.\n\nThe EvilNum backdoor can be used for reconnaissance and data theft activity and to load\nfollow-on payloads.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEvilNum malware and the TA4563 group poses a risk to financial organizations. Based on\nProofpoint analysis, TA4563’s malware is under active development. Although Proofpoint did\nnot observe follow-on payloads deployed in identified campaigns, third-party reporting\nindicates EvilNum malware may be leveraged to distribute additional malware including tools\navailable via the Golden Chickens malware-as-a-service TA4563 has adjusted their attempts\n\n\n-----\n\nto compromise the victims using various methods of delivery, whilst Proofpoint observed this\nactivity and provided detection updates to thwart this activity, it should be noted that a\npersistent adversary will continue to adjust their posture in their compromise attempts.\n\n### Indicators Of Compromise\n\n2851693 - ETPRO MALWARE EvilNum Related Domain in DNS Lookup\n(malware.rules)\n2851694 - ETPRO MALWARE EvilNum Related Domain in DNS Lookup\n(malware.rules)\n2851695 - ETPRO MALWARE EvilNum Related Domain in DNS Lookup\n(malware.rules)\n2851696 - ETPRO MALWARE EvilNum Related Domain in DNS Lookup\n(malware.rules)\n2851697 - ETPRO MALWARE EvilNum Related Domain in DNS Lookup\n(malware.rules)\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n\nhxxp://officelivecloud[.]com Payload\nDomain\nDecember\n2021\n\nhxxp://mailgunltd[.]com Payload\nDomain\nDecember\n2021\n\nhxxp://officelivecloud[.]com Payload\nDomain\nDecember\n2021\n\nhxxp://visitaustriaislands[.]com Command\nand Control\nDomain\nMay 2022\n\nhxxp://outlookfnd[.]com Command\nand Control\nDomain\nJune 2022\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://infntio[.]com/save/user.php Payload\nURL March\n2022\n\nhxxp://advflat[.]com/save/user.php Command\nand Control\nURL March\n2022\n\nhxxp://pngdoma[.]com/admin/index.php Command\nand Control\nURL March\n2022\n\nhxxp://goalrom[.]com/admin/settings.php Command\nand Control\nURL March\n2022\n\nhxxp://elitefocuc[.]com/save/user.php Command\nand Control\nURL March\n2022\n\nhxxp://hubflash[.]co/configuration.php Command\nand Control\nURL April\n2022\n\nbookingitnow[.]org Command\nand Control\nDomain\n\nbookaustriavisit[.]com Command\nand Control\nDomain\n\nmoretraveladv[.]com Command\nand Control\nDomain\n\n\n-----\n\nestoniaforall[.]com Command\nand Control\nDomain\n\nef1a660ee8b11bbcf681e8934c5f16e4a249ba214d743bbf8b1f8043296b6ffc Word Doc\nSHA256\nJune 2022\n\nda642cc233ea3595d8aaf8daf6129c59682b19462d5d5abb1f494042d4c044f4 Word Doc\nSHA256\nSample\nJune 2022\n\n53ade63ba9938fd97542a0a725d82045f362766f24f0b1f414f4693d9919f631 LNK\nSHA256\nSample\nMarch 2022\n\nf0a002c7d2174f2a022d0dfdb0d83973c1dd96c4db86a2b687d14561ab564daa LNK\nSHA256\nSample\nMarch 2022\n\n53ade63ba9938fd97542a0a725d82045f362766f24f0b1f414f4693d9919f631 Word Doc\nSHA256\nSample\nDecember\n2021\n\n649183519d59ea332d687a01c37040b91da69232aadb0c1215c36a5b87ad2ec7 Word Doc\nSHA256\nSample\nDecember\n2021\n\nviktoria.helle79@zingamail[.]uk Sender\nEmail March\n2022\n\npaul@christiesrealestate[.]uk Sender\nEmail\nDecember\n2021\n\n\n-----\n\nsherry@schalapartners[.]com Sender\nEmail March\n2022\n\narfeuille19@gmail[.]com Sender\nEmail June\n2022\n\narole@delaware-north[.]com Sender\nEmail May\n2022\n\n\nhxxps://onedrive.live[.]com/download?resid=\n\n680BC877518B4D11%21388&authkey=!AMMjaIOZSltiS_Q\n\nhxxps://onedrive.live[.]com/download?resid=\n\n680BC877518B4D11!531&authkey=!ADr0ziYEPBJJK9w\n\nhxxps://onedrive.live[.]com/download?resid=\n\n680BC877518B4D11!426&authkey=!AB60IPFY2E-XMXs\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\nOneDrive\nURL March\n2022\n\nOneDrive\nURL March\n2022\n\nOneDrive\nURL March\n2022\n\n\n-----",
