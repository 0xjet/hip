We quote:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat)\n\nThe attackers used a very specific set of advanced hacking tools designed for offensive\nsecurity. These tools are primarily used by advanced persistent threat* groups, are not\navailable publicly and therefore out of reach to other actors.\nThe attackers used sophisticated obfuscation techniques to hide and protect their\nmalicious programs. This requires a high level of skills only available to a limited\nnumber of actors.\nWe determined the attack to be targeted because the attackers created a piece of code\ndesigned purely for execution on the targeted ICRC servers. The tools used by the\nattacker explicitly referred to a unique identifier on the targeted servers (its MAC\naddress).\nThe anti-malware tools we had installed on the targeted servers were active and did\ndetect and block some of the files used by the attackers. But most of the malicious files\ndeployed were specifically crafted to bypass our anti-malware solutions, and it was only\nwhen we installed advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents as part of\nour planned enhancement programme that this intrusion was detected.\n\nThe Red Cross said the attacker’s advanced offensive tools are what prevented it from\ndetecting the breach sooner, with the attackers spending 70 days inside its network before\ndiscovery.\n\nDespite pinning the attack on a suspected state-sponsored hacking group, the Red Cross did\nnot formally attribute the attack to any organization just yet.\n\n[Nevertheless, a Palo Alto Networks report from November 2021 linked exploitation of the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/manageengine-godzilla-nglite-kdcsponge/)\nsame Zoho vulnerability to a Chinese state-sponsored group known as APT27.\n\nA week after the Red Cross disclosed its breach in January 2022, the German government\nalso published a security alert warning local companies and state agencies about similar\nAPT27 attacks leveraging the same Zogo vulnerability, which may provide additional clues\nabout who may have been behind the Red Cross compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Red Cross hack turned a lot of heads last month and even made the US State\n[Department to publish a rare statement on the matter, calling the incident “a dangerous](https://www.state.gov/u-s-statement-on-the-hack-of-the-icrc/)\ndevelopment.”\n\n“To ensure states and vulnerable people can continue to trust and rely on the Red Cross and\nRed Crescent Movement for the help they need, states should join the ICRC in raising the\nalarm about this breach,” the agency said last month.\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[APT27](https://therecord.media/tag/apt27/)\n[China](https://therecord.media/tag/china/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[Red Cross](https://therecord.media/tag/red-cross/)\n[vulnerability](https://therecord.media/tag/vulnerability/)\n[Zoho](https://therecord.media/tag/zoho/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
