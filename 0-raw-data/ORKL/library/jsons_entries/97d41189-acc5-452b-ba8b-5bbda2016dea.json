The attack group in charge of this\n\n operation has been carrying out attacks for a long time using the Bisonal-type malware to target\n\n major organizations, such as Korean military agencies and companies in the defense industry. The\n\n operation seemed to be in a lull from the fall of 2017, but it started again in 2018.\n\n In this report, we will look at the trends and techniques of the Operation Bitter Biscuit analyzed by\n\n the AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC), with a focus on the actual attacks that\n\n have occurred in South Korea in 2018.\n\n 1. Attacks Trends of Operation Bitter Biscuit\n\n The Bisonal-type malware, first discovered in 2010, was mainly used for Operation Bitter Biscuit\n\n attacks, and has continued to appear in attacks against South Korea, Japan, India, and Russia until\n\n now. It was first discovered in Korea in 2011 and was used in the attack on the defense industry\n\n in Japan in the following year. In 2015, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)\n\n released a warning on a variant of Bisonal, called Bioazih.1\n\n\n-----\n\n###### From the analysis of the attack trends of Operation Bitter Biscuit, it was found that the Bisonal-type\n\n malware was still actively used to attack major Korean agencies. From 2011 to Spring 2012, attacks\n\n were made on Korean institutions, and from 2013 to 2015, attacks were continuously made on\n\n Korean businesses and defense companies. In 2016 and 2017, attacks were made on companies in\n\n the defense industry and other related businesses. Most recently, in 2018, the scope of the attack\n\n was expanded with the concentration of attacks in the Korean marine sector.\n\n AhnLab has been tracking and analyzing the attacks of Operation Bitter Biscuit, which have been\n\n conducted for a long time, and the possible attack groups associated with those attacks.\n\n 2. Major Attacks on Korea in 2018\n\n The Table 2-1 timeline summarizes the major attacks of Operation Bitter Biscuit in 2018. After the\n\n lull from the fall of 2017, the attacks began again in spring 2018. The attacks on the Korean marine\n\n sector was observed from March to July 2018.\n\nDate Attack Target Description\n\nAttack attempt using the file “퇴사 인수인계 자.scr” (Employee handbook for transfer of\nMarch 2018 ?

When the new dropper\n\n is executed, it generates malware and Visual Basic Script (VBS) files, as well as a decoy document.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 2-1 shows the contents of the decoy\n\n document in the malware found in 2018. This\n\n also shows that the attacker was targeting users\n\n in the marine sector.\n\n The malware generated by the dropper com\nFigure 2-1 | Decoy Documents of Malware Found in 2018\n\n###### prises the downloader for downloading addi\n tional malware and a backdoor for executing remote commands. Some of the discovered malware\n\n adds a garbage value to the end of the file, creating a massive file with a size of several to a hundred\n\n megabytes. The generated VBS file includes a script that shows a decoy document and another\n\n script that deletes the executed dropper, as well as the executed VBS file itself.\n\n 3. Malware Analysis\n\n We will now look at the dropper, downloader, and backdoor used in the 2018 Operational Bitter\n\n Biscuit attacks.\n\n 3-1) Dropper Analysis\n\n On March 5, 2018, a file named 퇴사 인수인계 자료.scr” (Employee handbook for transfer of duties)\n\n was found to be used as a dropper. The basic information about the dropper is shown in Table 2-2.\n\n|File Name|퇴사 인수인계 자료.scr” (Employee handbook for transfer of duties)|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|260,968|\n|Time Created|22:01:29 December 26, 2015 (UTC)|\n|MD5|e5a8c1df0360baeeeab767d8422cc58f|\n|SHA1|0ba6787751e7e80c0911f666fd42a175dd419e0e|\n|SHA256|013c87898926de3f6cc8266c79c7888d92eb1546a49493d1433b8261d2e41e77|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Key Features and Characteristics|Decoy document, executable file, VBS file created|\n|---|---|\n|AhnLab Diagnosis|Dropper/Win32.Bisonal|\n\n\nTable 2-2 | Basic Information about the Dropper\n\n###### When the dropper is executed, a decoy document, an executable file, and two VBS files are created,\n\n as shown in Figure 2-2. \n\nFigure 2-2 | Components of the Malware\n\n###### As mentioned earlier, the information of the attack target can be inferred from the contents\n\n of the decoy document. All the decoy documents of the dropper found in 2018 are related to\n\n the Korean marine sector. The executable file works as a downloader, and some variants also\n\n include a backdoor. The two VBS files are comprised of a file that opens the decoy document on a\n\n Microsoft Office program and a file that deletes the executed dropper file.\n\n 3-2) Downloader Analysis\n\n One of the key features and characteristics of the downloader used in this attack is its function to\n\n check the name of the executed file. If the executed file name is not services.exe, the services.exe\n\n file is created in a specific path, such as c:\\Users\\[Username]\\Applications\\Microsoft. At this time,\n\n a garbage value is added to the end of the file to generate a file with a size of about 4 MB.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The basic information about the downloader is shown in Table 2-3.\n\nFile Name 3.tmp\n\nFile Size 10,752\n\nTime Created 00:21:33 February 25, 2018 (UTC)\n\nMD5 d198e4632f9c4b9a3efbd6b1ed378d26\n\nSHA1 bb8be657e4bf1eb9a89ae66cb6c8a8d6baa934d4\n\nSHA256 4652882a64cc8fe823ab6d7c2166f1dbf9b75794d024ddbfaa173b6f9107a19f\n\nKey Features and File services.exe with a size of 4 megabytes or more is created. System information is saved as an ms.log.\nCharacteristics Additional malware is downloaded.\n\nAhnLab Diagnosis Trojan/Win32.Bisdow\n\nTable 2-3 | Basic Information about the Downloader\n\n|File Name|3.tmp|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|10,752|\n|Time Created|00:21:33 February 25, 2018 (UTC)|\n|MD5|d198e4632f9c4b9a3efbd6b1ed378d26|\n|SHA1|bb8be657e4bf1eb9a89ae66cb6c8a8d6baa934d4|\n|SHA256|4652882a64cc8fe823ab6d7c2166f1dbf9b75794d024ddbfaa173b6f9107a19f|\n|Key Features and Characteristics|File services.exe with a size of 4 megabytes or more is created.

Additional malware is downloaded.|\n|AhnLab Diagnosis|Trojan/Win32.Bisdow|\n\n\nFigure 2-3 | Original File and New File with Added Garbage Value\n\n###### Figure 2-3 compares the original file and the new file, to which a garbage value was added by the\n\n downloader. This behavior suggests that a file is generated at random to make it difficult for the user\n\n to find the malware using a hash value. Some variants even created a file with a size of about 100 MB.\n\n If the name of the executed file is services.exe, the downloader registers services.exe in the registry\n\n and creates the Windows Message.lnk file. This Windows Message LNK file contains the shortcut\n\n data of the malicious services.exe.\n\n Then, the downloader uses the ipconfig.exe and net.exe files to store the system information in the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ms.log file and sends it to http://mp.motlat.com/info/wel.gif.\n\n An interesting feature of the downloader exists only in the variants found in 2018 - it checks for\n\n the execution within a virtual environment using the disk name, as shown in Figure 2-4, when\n\n attempting to download additional files. The function for the virtual environment check does not\n\n exist in variants found before 2018.\n\nFigure 2-4 | Virtual Environment Check\n\n###### The downloader downloads the MsUpdata.exe file from http://mp.motlat.com/lvs/tips.htm.\n\n According to AhnLab's analysis, the msupdata.exe file (2c0522a805fa845ec9385eb5400e8d16) was\n\n distributed from this address in early March, 2018. The msupdata.exe file is also a downloader for\n\n downloading additional malware. The malware downloaded in the last step has yet to be confirmed.\n\n 3-3) Backdoor Analysis\n\n In 2018, a backdoor file was also created using a similar dropper. The malware associated with this\n\n backdoor was first discovered in the fall of 2014. A Bisonal variant was also discovered in the same\n\n attack target. The basic information about the backdoor is shown in Table 2-4.\n\n\n-----\n\n|File Name|3.tmp|\n|---|---|\n|File Size|28,672 bytes|\n|Time Created|04:10:36 February 10, 2018 (UTC)|\n|MD5|fc78fff75df0291d8c514f595f68c654|\n|SHA1|aec101161bdfada59b93ef47f1b814e4fea54c9e|\n|SHA256|6631d7045a2209ca5dbcf5071cb97eaea8cfba2e875a75e5535ba9180aaaf8d1|\n|Key Features and Characteristics|Backdoor|\n|AhnLab Diagnosis|Backdoor/Win32.Bisoaks|\n\n\nTable 2-4 | Basic Information about the Backdoor\n\n###### In the Bisoaks malware, which is a Bisonal variant, is known for containing strings such as “axpbu.\n\n txt”and “mismyou,” as shown in Figure 2-5. However, some of the variants are packed with\n\n PECompact or MPRESS and these distinguishing string cannot be checked.\n\nFigure 2-5 | Text Strings of Bisoaks Malware\n\n###### When the malware is executed, it registers the executed file to the registry key “mismyou” in the\n\n registry path HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.\n\n Ultimately, it executes the commands received from the C&C server as the last step. The features\n\n supported by the Bisoaks malware include collecting the system information, obtaining a process\n\n list, terminating a process, downloading a file, and executing a file. Some variants even have\n\n additional features, such as self-deletion.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4. Association\n\n The analysis of the Bitter Biscuit attacks in 2018\n\n suggests that the dropper used in this attack\n\n has been newly developed. For downloaders\n\n and backdoors, association with the 2014\n\n attacks has been confirmed. Bisoaks was also\n\nFigure 2-6 | Association Diagram of Malware in 2018 Attacks\n\n###### discovered to be responsible for the attacks\n\n in 2014 and 2018 using similar codes on the same attack target. Figure 2-6 shows the association\n\n diagram of malware used in the Bitter Biscuit attacks in 2018.\n\n The similarity between the strings and codes of the downloaders found in 2014 and 2018 can also\n\n be seen in Figure 2-7.\n\nFigure 2-7 | Comparison of Downloader Strings in 2014 and 2018\n\n###### Some download addresses of variants are associated with Korea. Furthermore, as shown in Figure\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2-8, the main attack target can be inferred to be Korea, due to the fact that a fake certificate (00c479\n\n bf76dc90db51209d2fa2a9cf6a) in the malware\n\n file is disguised as an AhnLab's certificate.\n\n The Bisoaks backdoor found in 2018 contains a\n\n distinctive string, and similar strings were found\n\n in the variant (45a416f10ccb2c31ff391e61a7584\n\nFigure 2-8 | Downloader File with a Fake Digital Signature Imperso\n###### f1f) in October 2014, as shown in Figure 2-9. nating AhnLab\n\nFigure 2-9 | Text Strings of the Bisoaks Variant\n\n###### As shown in Figure 2-10, the variants found in September 2018 and March 2018 also have very\n\n similar code.\n\nFigure 2-10 | Comparison of Variants Found in September 2014 and March 2018\n\n\nFigure 2-8 | Downloader File with a Fake Digital Signature Imperso-\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Bisoaks malware contains campaign IDs, and the variants found in Korea contain text strings,\n\n such as 0903, 0917, 1016-02, 443, pmo, hjing, 24-kncck, 8000, 95, and 48.\n\n There are a total of 29 variants of this backdoor. The first variant, discovered in September\n\n 2014, was mainly targeting Korean government agencies. Therefore, it can be assumed that the\n\n attacker has been active in Korea for at least four years.\n\n It has not been confirmed whether Operation Bitter Biscuit was carried out by a single group.\n\n However, based on the trends of attacks in 2018, the Bisoaks malware can also be seen as an\n\n associated attack. This is because the Bisoaks malware that has been used in Operation Bitter\n\n Biscuit since 2014 was similarly used in 2018. Figure 2-11 shows the list of malware used in\n\n Operation Bitter Biscuit from 2009 to 2018.\n\nFigure 2-11 | Different Types of Malware related to Operation Bitter Biscuit\n\n###### 5. Conclusion\n\n Operation Bitter Biscuit, which was dormant since the fall of 2017, resumed its attacks against\n\n major South Korean agencies from March 2018. The attacks focused on the South Korean military\n\n companies and the defense industry until 2017, but they have expanded to target the marine\n\n sector from 2018. Although it is not confirmed that the attack was carried not by the same\n\n\n-----\n\n###### group, it can still be concluded that the attacker in the spring of 2018 has been targeting Korean\n\n government agencies, at least from 2014, due to the similarity of the malware used in the attacks.\n\n For nearly 10 years, this unknown threat to South Korea has been committed to delivering attacks\n\n on major Korean agencies and companies.
