This level of\n\nsophistication is rarely seen, even in the targeted attacks sphere. The nature of Inception’s targets, from 2014 right through to today, along with the\n\ncapabilities of its tools, indicate that espionage is the primary motive of this groups\n\nIn 2014, Inception was compromising targeted organizations using spear-phishing emails, which masqueraded as legitimate emails concerning\n\ninternational policy, upcoming conferences, and speci�c sectoral interests of the targeted organization.\n\nMore than half of the group’s earlier targets were in the Energy or Defense sectors, but it also targeted organizations in the Consultancy/Security,\n\nAerospace, Research, and Media sectors, in addition to embassies. Its activities ranged across the globe, with targets located in South Africa, Kenya, the\n\nUnited Kingdom, Malaysia, Suriname, along with several other European and Middle Eastern countries.\n\nWord documents attached to Inception’s spear-phishing emails leveraged two Microsoft O�ce vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761\n\n(https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1761) and CVE-2012-0158 (http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve\n2012-0158)) to install malware on the recipient’s computer. The malware had a multi-staged structure that began with a malicious RTF document and\n\nended with an in-memory DLL payload that communicated, via the WebDAV protocol, with a command and control (C&C) address from a legitimate\n\ncloud service provider (CloudMe.com). The name “Inception” comes from the group’s many levels of obfuscation and indirection it employed in\n\ndelivering this payload.\n\nFurther layers of obfuscation emerged when Blue Coat was able to determine that the attackers were communicating with CloudMe.com through a\n\nhacked network of compromised routers, the majority of which were located in South Korea.\n\n### Stepping out of the shadows once again\n\nFollowing its exposure in late 2014, Inception fell quiet. However, this turned out to be only a brief hiatus and, by April 2015, there had been a resurgence\n\nin activity. Attacks have continued since then, right through to 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Inception Framework attacks 2015-2017_\n\nIn the intervening years, the Inception Framework has evolved, adding additional layers of obfuscation in a bid to avoid detection. The group is using new\n\ntypes of lure documents in its spear-phishing campaigns and its malware has expanded to use new types of plugins. Inception has also increased its\n\nuse of the cloud, and diversi�ed the range of cloud providers it uses for C&C purposes.\n\n_Figure 2. Locations of organizations targeted by Inception, 2015-2017_\n\nThe locations of Inception’s targets have shifted since 2014, but the group continues to have a global reach. Russia accounted for the largest number of\n\nattacks between 2015 and 2017, followed by Ukraine, Moldova, Belgium, Iran, and France.\n\n### An evolved attack framework\n\nSince 2014, the Inception Framework has steadily changed its tools and techniques. In its early attacks, the group’s malware payload (with the exception\n\nof plugins) was fully contained within an exploit document emailed to the victim In more recent activity these spear phishing attacks are now a two\n\n\n-----\n\nt at so t a e s up to date.\n\nSeveral days later, Inception will send a second spear-phishing email to the target, with another malicious document attached. This document is\n\ndesigned to retrieve a remote RTF �le, which contains the exploit, and open it on the target’s computer.\n\nShortly after this RTF document is opened, the remaining stages of the Inception malware are found executing on the system. The loader DLL is\n\nresponsible for decrypting and injecting the core payload DLL into memory, from an encrypted �le present on disk. The core payload DLL's main function\n\nis to gather system information, execute other malware in the form of plugins, and update itself. It accesses C&C via WebDAV hosted on legitimate cloud\n\nstorage providers.\n\nThe use of an initial reconnaissance document allows Inception to pro�le the target’s computer and potentially customize any subsequent malicious\n\ndocument to exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched software on the computer.\n\nBy breaking its attacks up into distinct stages, Inception also makes them harder to detect. For investigators to trace an attack, each stage will have be\n\nuncovered and referenced to the other stages.\n\n### Modular malware\n\nInception’s malware is modular and the attackers will load plugins based on requirements for each attack. The group has used a range of plugins in\n\nrecent attacks, some of which are improved versions of plugins used in 2014, while others were previously unseen.\n\nFile hunting plugin: The most frequently used plugin, similar to one used in 2014. Often used to collect O�ce �les from temporary internet history.\nDetailed survey plugin: Used to gather domain membership, processes/loaded modules, hardware enumeration, installed products, logical and\nmapped drive information. Evolution of earlier plugin used in 2014.\nBrowser plugin: Used to steal browser history, stored passwords and sessions. Works with Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Torch, and\nYandex.\nFile listing plugin: Works on local or remote drives and can map additional paths when given credentials.\n\n### Expanding use of the cloud\n\nSince 2014, Inception has widened its use of cloud service providers for C&C purposes. Whereas previously it relied on one service provider\n\n(CloudMe.com), more recently it has employed a least �ve cloud service providers\n\nLeveraging the cloud for C&C has a number of advantages for groups like Inception. Any C&C communications will involve encrypted tra�c to a known\n\nwebsite, meaning it is less likely to raise �ags on targeted networks. Legitimate cloud services are not likely to be blacklisted.\n\nVarying the cloud service provider used adds a further degree of stealth. Once it became known Inception was using a single provider, any tra�c to that\n\nprovider may have attracted additional scrutiny.\n\nSymantec has noti�ed all cloud providers affected. Where possible Symantec has provided details on the C&C accounts used by Inception to the\n\naffected cloud providers. The accounts in questions have been deleted or disabled.\n\n### Using IoT to hide behind proxies\n\nInception is continuing to use chains of infected routers to act as proxies and mask communications between the attackers and the cloud service\n\nproviders they use. Certain router manufacturers have UPnP listening on WAN as a default con�guration. Akamai research has found that there are\n\n765,000 devices vulnerable to this attack. These routers are hijacked by Inception and con�gured to forward tra�c from one port to another host on the\n\ninternet. Abuse of this service requires no custom malware to be injected on the routers and can be used at scale very easily. Inception strings chains of\n\nthese routers together to create multiple proxies to hide behind.\n\n\n#### \"#InceptionFramework evolved, rolling out new tools & hiding behind increasingly complex array of proxies & cloud services symc.ly/2GsqXra\"\n\n\n CLICK TO TWEET (//TWITTER.COM/INTENT/TWEET?\n[TEXT=%23INCEPTIONFRAMEWORK%20EVOLVED,%20ROLLING%20OUT%20NEW%20TOOLS%20%26%20HIDING%20BEHIND%20INCREASINGLY%2](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%23InceptionFramework%20evolved,%20rolling%20out%20new%20tools%20%26%20hiding%20behind%20increasingly%20complex%20array%20of%20proxies%20%26%20cloud%20services%20symc.ly/2GsqXra&via=threatintel)\n\nEvery connection builds different chains of infected routers and once the connection is complete, it cleans up after itself. In several cases, Symantec has\n\nbeen able to follow the entire chain of compromised routers and found it led to a virtual private server (VPS), meaning the attackers have employed an\n\nadditional layer of security by routing communications through rented hosting servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mobile devices targeted\n\nInception has an ongoing interest in mobile devices and has previously developed malware to infect Android (Android.Lastacloud\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-121216-4334-99)), iOS (IOS.Lastaccoud\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-121216-5858-99)) and BlackBerry devices (BBOS.Lastacloud\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-121913-0103-99)).\n\nMobile malware continues to be deployed and the group has made some modi�cations to its Android malware. The malware is spread via SMS\n\nmessages and emails containing malicious links. Once installed, it uses user pro�le pages on online forums as dead drops for its C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Malicious SMS message used by Inception to spread_\n_Android malware_\n\n### Persistence, stealth, and global reach\n\nEven prior to its discovery in 2014, Inception went to great lengths both to avoid detection and conceal its location. Exposure hasn’t deterred the group.\n\nInstead, it has redoubled its efforts, adding more layers of obfuscation to an already complex attack framework. Its persistence, stealth, and global reach\n\nmean the group continues to pose an ongoing risk to organizations, particularly in its areas of interest, which include defense, aerospace, energy,\n\ngovernments, telecoms, media, and �nance.\n\nAside from a suite of advanced modular malware, the group is notable for its ability to make use of new platforms such as the cloud, IoT, and mobile to\n\nfacilitate its attacks. An “early adopter”, Inception’s tactics may point the way towards how other espionage groups may modify their methods in years to\n\ncome.\n\n### Protection\n\nSymantec has had protection for all of the Inception Framework tools since the initial emergence of the group in 2014.
