These attacks can be challenging to detect because they circumvent many\ncontrols and policies designed to protect sensitive data against unauthorized access.\n\nThis report explores the command and control structure of one of the cybercrime industries’\nbetter-known backdoor malware variants. The TA505 threat group manages its ServHelper\nbackdoor malware by using a software control panel called TeslaGun. TeslaGun name\noccurs on the top left of its control panels with a blue label and version number (can be\nseen in Figure 3).\n\nTA505 is a financially motivated threat group that has been active since 2014. The group\nfrequently changes its malware attack strategies in response to global cybercrime trends [5].\nIt opportunistically adopts new technologies in order to gain leverage over victims before\nthe wider cybersecurity industry catches on.\n\nThis report provides insight into how TA505 enables and manages these attacks through its\n”TeslaGun” control panel. The PRODAFT Threat Intelligence (PTI) team identified the group’s\ncontrol panel and used it to glean insight into how the organization works.\n\nThis insight will help information security executives, legal professionals, and cybercrime\ninsurers to understand the threat that TA505 poses to its victims. It will provide a clear\nfoundation for resolving liability issues related to ServHelper attacks specifically, and\nbackdoor attacks more generally.\n\nMany reputable sources have already provided valuable sample analysis covering TA505’s\nbackdoor attack methods. This report focuses on new information; how the group’s\n”TeslaGun” control panel enables the distribution of backdoor attacks, and what that can tell\nthe cybersecurity community about TA505’s motivations, strategies, and internal organizing\nprinciples.\n\nThis report holds valuable, previously unreported analysis of ServHelper campaigns and\nsamples. Similarly, it contains findings from the group’s C&C server, including infection dates,\ntargeted countries, executed commands, and other valuable information regarding the\ngroup’s techniques and tactics.\n\n3 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

According\nto unearthed TeslaGun victim data, TA505 mostly targeted the U.S, which is home to 3667 of\nthe group’s victims (as shown in Figure 1).\n\n**Figure 1. Victim distribution by country.**\n\nThe group makes its priorities clear in a footnote located inside the TeslaGun panel, which\nsays ”Huawey Coproration with love to USA”, as shown in Figure 2 (The typo exists in the\noriginal text).\n\n**Figure 2. Footnote of TeslaGun panel.**\n\n4 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.2 Characteristics of the TA505 Group\n\n**Financial Motivation : The PTI team observed that the main dashboard of the TeslaGun**\npanel includes comments attached to victim records. These records show victim device\ndata such as CPU, GPU, RAM size and internet connection speed.\n\nThis information shows that ”ServHelper” users are actively profiling their victims, and TA505\nmembers may use this data to decide which victims’ devices are suitable for crypto-mining.[4]\nOn the other hand, according to victim comments, it is clear that TA505 is actively looking\nfor online banking or retail users, including crypto-wallets and e-commerce accounts.\n\n**Targeting Financial Sector : According to the PTI Team victim analysis, most TA505 victims**\noperate in the financial sector. However, it is readily apparent that TA505 opportunistically\ntargets individuals and organizations in non-related sectors as well. The group dedicates\nresources to maintaining backdoor connections and actively tries to sell those connections\nto other cybercriminals4.\n\n**Malware Toolkit : According to the third-party technical analysis and samples available on**\npublic threat platforms, TA505 uses various droppers as well as delivery techniques for their\nbackdoor malware attacks [2][4].\n\n**Targeted Countries : While the United States is by far the most frequently targeted region,**\nwith 3667 attacks recorded, TA505’s next most common targets include Russia (647), Brazil\n(483), Romania (444), and the United Kingdom (359).\n\n**Fraudulent Activities : Although ”ServHelper” does not need interaction or manual**\nconfiguration, TA505 members often interact directly with victim devices through the Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) with multiple sessions. The PTI team detected TA505 threat actors\ndownloading and installing custom tools like (sep12.exe) via patched RDP sessions to carry\nout fraudulent activities.\n\n**Multiple Campaigns : A single instance of the ”TeslaGun” control panel contains multiple**\ncampaign records representing different delivery methods and attack data. Newer versions of\nthe malware encode these different campaigns as campaign IDs. We observed a significant\nnumber of different victim profiles and campaigns during our investigation. Other researchers\nanalyzing the group’s malware samples also concluded that TA505 operates multiple attack\nvectors, apparently and simultaneously [6].\n\n5 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

The following table shows how\nthis backdoor is being created in step-by-step format :\n\n**Command** **Description**\nnet user WgaUtilAcc <Password> Creates WgaUtilAcc\nnet LOCALGROUP ”Administrators” WgaUtilAcc /ADD Adds backdoor user to Administrator group\nnet LOCALGROUP ”Remote Desktop Users” WgaUtilAcc /ADD Adds backdoor account to RDP group\nnet LOCALGROUP ”Remote Desktop Users” %USERNAME% /ADD Adds current account to RDP group\nwmic path win32_VideoController get name Gets GPU Name\nwmic CPU get NAME Gets CPU Name\npowershell -ep bypass -NoProfile -outputformat text -nologo Execute connection speed testing script.\n-noninteractive -enc %Trimmed...%\n\nOnce the PTI performed detailed analysis on one of TA505’s TeslaGun panels, it could easily\nprofile how ServHelper communicates with its C&C infrastructure. These profiles enabled the\nteam to analyze samples on other sandbox and open threat exchange platforms, resulting\nin panels & IPs similar to those TA505 manages.\n\nThis does not mean that this report exhaustively covers all TA505 domains and IPs. The\ngroup may be operating additional domains through domain generation algorithms (DGAs)\nand proxy servers as well.\n\nFor example the domain, which is dkaknvizisic.xyz, has not been flagged in VirusTotal (at the\nof the investigation) as malicious for security. This domain occurs to be a brand new CC\nTeslaGun panel associated with 37 victims at the moment of our investigation. We have\nfound data corresponding to these victims tagged with the sep27 campaign code.\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|net user WgaUtilAcc <Password>|Creates WgaUtilAcc|\n|net LOCALGROUP ”Administrators” WgaUtilAcc /ADD|Adds backdoor user to Administrator group|\n|net LOCALGROUP ”Remote Desktop Users” WgaUtilAcc /ADD|Adds backdoor account to RDP group|\n|net LOCALGROUP ”Remote Desktop Users” %USERNAME% /ADD|Adds current account to RDP group|\n|wmic path win32_VideoController get name|Gets GPU Name|\n|wmic CPU get NAME|Gets CPU Name|\n|powershell -ep bypass -NoProflie -outputformat text -nologo -noninteractive -enc %Trimmed...%|Execute connection speed testing script.|\n\n\nPlease note that this report has two versions.

The main dashboard only\ncontains infected victim data, a generic comment section for each victim, and several\noptions for filtering victim records.\n\n**Figure 3. Dashboard of the TeslaGun management panel.**\n\nThe panel’s filtering options offer a great deal of information about TA505’s workflow and\ncommercial strategy. Sell and Sell 2 groups were set for some victims. These victims’ RDP\nconnections were temporarily disabled through the panel.\n\n**Figure 4. Victim groups.**\n\n8 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\nThis probably means that TA505 can not immediately earn a profit from exploiting those\nparticular victims. Instead of letting them go, the group has tagged those victim’s RDP\nconnections for the resale to other cybercriminals.\n\nThe ERR group refers to those victims who have a slow connection. If the victim’s connection\nis too slow, TA505’s RDP connection will not work properly, and the group in this case loses\nthe ability to communicate with ServHelper effectively.\n\n**TeslaGun panels do not provide individual victim detail pages. Instead, victim tables show**\ndata in a series of columns :\n\n## • [SYSID/ID/IP]\n • [Country/State/City]\n • [First Time Connected/Last Time Connected]\n • [Command]\n • [Answer Operations/Tun Port/Operations]\n • [Comments]\n\nThe SYSID column refers to multiple aspects of the backdoor attack on a victim’s device, as\nexplained in Binary Defence’s comprehensive blog[1]. This column shows the following data :\n```\n{Campaign Code};\n{OS Name};\n{Architecture};\n{Computer Name};\n{Local Account Name};\n{Backdoor Account:WgaUtilAcc};\n{Backdoor Account's Password}\n\n```\nThe Cisco Talos’s Intelligence Group [4] has already identified how these data relate to\nServHelper’s command list and functionalities. Panel users can send these commands to\nvictim’s devices through TeslaGun panels.\n\nMoreover, TeslaGun has a functionality that allows attackers to send one command to all\nvictim devices in one step, or to configure a default command that runs when a new victim\ndevice is added to the panel.\n\nFigure 5 shows how running a command or changing the task for a specific victim works in\nthe TeslaGun panel.\n\n**Figure 5.

Other technical reports[4] also note this kind of activity, but do not mention\nwhere these tunneled connections are going.\n\n**Figure 6. TA505 Member is installing sep12.exe into victim device.**\n\nThis tool 6.2 lets attackers launch multiple hidden RDP instances. After infecting a victim,\nTA505 members connect to the victim via RDP upon infection to use these remote\nconnections simultaneously.\n\n\nAlthough, the samples communicate to panel domains, threat actors connect to their\nvictim’s RDP via tunnels. This command is called ”bk” in the C&C panel. Threat actors\ncan send the ”bk” command to establish RDP tunnels, then connect to the victim’s RDP\nthrough a selected port on a proxy server. These IPs are not flagged as malicious on\npublic lists, which means TA505 can often bypass signature-based detection solutions.\n\n\n10 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Here, we present our findings from the C&C server, which\nmatch the TA505 group’s actions with the known timelines of several TA505 campaigns.\n\nThe PTI team’s analysis shows that each C&C instance has a separate victim database.\nVictim record IDs as a result are not unique. TA505 uniquely identifies victims across\ndatabases by using their SYSID.\n\nThere is evidence that victims can be transferred across panels and instances. For\nexample, in one panel located on dfsrakizimoy34ggf.xyz, the oldest victim was logged on\n**2020-07-15, through a campaign tagged as jul11. However, according to Whois information**\nfor that domain, entry was updated at 2021-09-26 17:16:39.0Z. Alternatively, the date of\nthis domain was first seen is 2020-03-27 08:50 and the resolved IP was 5.181.156.5. This\nIP is different, unlike the IP of the latest entry. This situation indicates that the victims\nmust have been transferred from another instance. The PTI Team also detected that one\nsingle domain may include more than one panel, and these panels have different databases.\n\nUnearthed information indicates that campaigns’ samples are not only for single time\nuse. For example, for dec4 and dec27 ; the campaigns’ oldest victims were first logged\non ”2020-12-11” and ”2021-01-03” respectively. However, the dec4 campaign’s malware\ndid not stop spreading after dec27 was launched. One of dec4’s victims was first\nlogged on ”2021-01-13”, right after the start of the dec27 campaign. Much later, this\niteration started to show up again in August 2021, and has been extended to September 2021.\n\nThis clearly shows that TeslaGun panels are not exclusively organized according to\ncampaigns or versions. This makes it difficult to capture and define the overall structure of\nTA505 as an organization. The group may have additional activities outside the context of\nwhat the PTI team found during its investigation. Figure 8 represents the all versions of what\nthe PTI team could gather from the TeslaGun panels investigateion.\n\n12 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

TA505\nhas explicitly shown its preference for US victims with its ”Huawey” footnote. This, alongside\na notable preference for Chinese top-level domains, might be designed to implicate China\nin TA505’s attacks.\n\nHowever, it is possible that these signs are merely red herrings designed to throw threat\nintelligence operatives off-track. The general consensus of the cybersecurity community is\nthat TA505 is probably located somewhere in Eastern Europe, and is motivated by direct\nfinancial gain rather than national politics. The group does not appear to exclude specific\nnationalities or languages the way some other cybercrime groups do. TA505 victims can be\nanyone from anywhere.\n\n**Figure 9.

Russia and the United\nKingdom are outside the EU but in close geographical proximity, and have similarly high\nnumbers of victims. Figure 10 illustrates the number of victims from Europe, organized by\ncountry.\n\n**Figure 10. Victim distribution in Europe.**\n\nIt is worth noting that the majority of IP addresses, TA505 uses to manage and operate\n**ServHelper software belong to a hosting company located in Moldova (MivoCloud SRL),**\nwhile most of its EU-based victims are located in Romania. The two countries share a\ncommon language and culture, yet are are on very different geopolitical terms. Investigators\nhave linked TA505 activities to Eastern Europe in the past, but this is an important new piece\nof evidence linking the group to a specific country.\n\nTA505 has already demonstrated its preference for opportunistic financial gain over political\nmotivations. It’s possible that Romanian victims simply make easy targets for Moldavian\nthreat actors due to their shared language and culture, but this conjecture is based on\ncircumstantial evidence.\n\n16 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

TA505 appears to be well-embedded in the international\ncybercrime community, as demonstrated by its ability to collect and sell RDP connections to\nvictim devices. The PTI team was able to gain valuable insight into how TA505 organizes\nits activities and achieves its goals. This will help cybersecurity policies to protect against\nbackdoor attacks like ServHelper.\n\nFrom how TA505 commented their victims on TeslaGun panels perspective, it is obviously\nseen that TA505 is actively searching for online banking and shopping accounts, particularly\nfrom victims in the United States, but also from Russia, Romania, Brazil, and the UK. The\nthreat group will also attack victims outside of its primary scope, tagging RDP connections\nfor eventual resale to other cybercriminals. Ultimately, anyone could be a TA505 victim.\n\nThe PTI team observed that TA505’s internal structure is surprisingly disorganized. TeslaGun\npanels are not exclusively separated by campaign and do not include individual victim\ndetail pages. Despite this fact, TA505 members carefully monitor their victims and can\ndemonstrate remarkable patience, especially with high-value victims in the finance sector.\n\nIn spite of loose internal organization, TA505 is highly proactive when it comes to updating\nits malware. It can run multiple malware campaigns simultaneously and will frequently\nupdate its tools and techniques to evade detection. These campaigns may include unique\ntools and concepts that are not found in other campaigns[3]. The group’s agility can make it\ndifficult to predict and hard to detect over time.\n\nThe group does exhibit some telltale weaknesses, however. While TA505 can maintain hidden\nconnections on victims’ devices for months, its members are often unusually noisy. After\ninstalling ServHelper, TA505 threat actors may manually connect to victim devices through\nRDP tunneling. Security technologies capable of detecting these tunnels may prove vital for\ncatching and mitigating TA505’s backdoor attacks.\n\nProactive detection strategies are critical for overcoming fast-moving threats like TA505\nbackdoor attack campaigns. Broadly defined prevention-based security may help mitigate\nsome of the most obvious threats, but the reality of today’s mature, organized cybercrime\nindustry requires a new strategy. Business leaders and cybersecurity decision-makers\nmust actively search for new cybercrime trends and implement solutions for patching new\nvulnerabilities in their networks.\n\n17 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.
