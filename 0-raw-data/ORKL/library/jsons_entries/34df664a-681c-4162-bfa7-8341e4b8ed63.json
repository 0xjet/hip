Last spike on right is from June 24._\n\nTroldesh (aka Shade) was spread by phishing emails last winter, and is [reportedly now being](https://www.iguides.ru/main/security/vymogatel_troldesh/)\nspread via social networks and other messaging platforms, where posts point to malicious\nlinks.\n\nAvast researcher Jakub Křoustek was able to track a spike Monday (June 24) predominantly\nin Russia and Mexico, but with smaller spikes in the U.K. and Germany.\n\n“We see a spike in the number of its attacks that is probably more to do with Troldesh\noperators trying to push this strain harder and more effectively than any kind of significant\ncode update,” Křoustek said. “Troldesh has been spreading in the wild for years with\nthousands of victims with ransomed files and it will probably stay prevalent for some time.”\n\n[Ransomware caused global disruption in 2017’s WannaCry outbreak. Last spring a](https://www.avast.com/c-what-is-ransomware)\nransomware attack locked up many of the files of the city of Baltimore, and other attacks hit\n[Atlanta, San Antonio, and other cities. It is a type of malicious software (aka malware) that is](https://www.avast.com/c-malware)\ndesigned to take your computer files – and sometimes even your entire computer – hostage.\n\nThe malware encrypts your files so that they cannot be opened, or it locks you out of your\ncomputer completely to prevent access to all of those important photos, videos, accounting\nfiles, work documents, and other files. Many security experts advise against paying ransom\nto hackers because it empowers them, and encrypted files are often not released, anyway.\n[Find out more about protecting yourself from ransomware here.](https://www.avast.com/c-how-to-prevent-ransomware)\n\n\n-----",
