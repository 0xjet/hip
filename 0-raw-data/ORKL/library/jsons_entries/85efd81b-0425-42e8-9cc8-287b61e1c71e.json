Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\n\n-----\n\nNorth Korean hackers are suspected of launching a cyber-attack on some of the most\n[important government offices in the US and South Korea in recent days, including the White](https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea)\nHouse, the Pentagon, the New York Stock Exchange and the presidential Blue House in\nSeoul.\n\nThe attack took out some of South Korea's most important websites, including those of the\nBlue House, the defence ministry, the national assembly, Shinhan bank, Korea Exchange\nbank and the top internet portal Naver.\n\nAhn Jeong-eun, a spokeswoman for Korea Information Security Agency, said the websites of\n11 organisations had either gone down or had access problems.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the White House, Pentagon and New York Stock\nExchange were also targeted, but apparently deflected the electronic barrage. South Korea's\nYonhap news agency said military intelligence officers were looking into the possibility that\nthe attack may have been carried out by North Korean hackers and pro-North Korea forces\nin the South.\n\nIt resembles an attack that began last Saturday on government websites in the US, including\nsome that are responsible for fighting cyber-crime.\n\nJohn Bumgarner, director of research at the US Cyber Consequences Unit, said: \"There's\nbeen a lot chatter recently about cyber-war. The North Koreans may have felt they were not\ngetting enough attention launching missiles so they moved into another potential warfare –\ncyber. It's a form of sabre rattling. But the big question is, did the North Koreans launch it\nthemselves or did someone do it for them?\"\n\nYang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies, said he doubted\nwhether the North had the capability to knock down the websites.\n\nBut Hong Hyun-ik, an analyst at the Sejong Institute thinktank, said the attack could have\nbeen carried out by either North Korea or China, saying he \"heard North Korea has been\nworking hard to hack into\" South Korean networks.\n\nSouth Korea's National Intelligence Service told a group of politicians today that it believes\nthat North Korea or its sympathisers were behind the attacks, a source at the meeting told\nAssociated Press.\n\nThe agency refused to comment, but it confirmed it was working with US authorities to\ninvestigate the attack. It said it believed the attack was thoroughly prepared and committed\n\"at the level of a certain organisation or state\".\n\nThe attacks appeared to be linked to problems on the US sites, although investigators were\nstill unsure who was behind them, Ahn said.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the US, the treasury department, secret service, Federal Trade Commission and transport\ndepartment websites were all down at varying points over the 4 July holiday weekend. Some\nof the sites were still experiencing problems last night.\n\nThe website of the Washington Post was also affected. Its computer security writer Brian\n[Krebs blamed \"malicious software\" that ordered infected PCs to repeatedly visit targeted](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/07/washington_post_white_house_fa.html)\nwebsites. A large proportion of the PCs involved were located in South Korea, he reported.\n\nAn initial investigation in South Korea found that many personal computers were infected\nwith a virus ordering them to visit official websites in South Korea and the US at the same\ntime, the Korean information agency official Shin Hwa-su said.\n\nThe US homeland security department confirmed that officials had received reports of\n\"malicious web activity\" and said they were investigating. Two government officials confirmed\nthat the treasury and secret service sites had been brought down, and said the agencies\nwere working with their internet service provider to resolve the problem.\n\nBen Rushlo, director of internet technologies at the website monitoring company Keynote\nSystems, called it a \"massive outage\".\n\nDenial of service attacks against websites are not uncommon, and are usually caused when\nsites are deluged with internet traffic to take them offline. Documenting cyber-attacks against\ngovernment sites is difficult, and depends heavily on how agencies characterise an incident\nand how successful or damaging it is.\n\n\n-----",
