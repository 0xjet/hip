    "plain_text": "# Emotet Malware Revives Old Email Conversations Threads to Increase Infection Rates\n\n**[spamtitan.com/blog/emotet-malware-revives-old-email-conversations-threads-to-increase-infection-rates/](https://www.spamtitan.com/blog/emotet-malware-revives-old-email-conversations-threads-to-increase-infection-rates/)**\n\ntitanadmin April 12, 2019\n\nEmotet malware was first identified in 2014 and its original purpose was to obtain banking\ncredentials and other sensitive information; however, the malware is regularly updated and\nnew functionality is added. Emotet malware is now one of the most prevalent and dangerous\nmalware threats faced by businesses.\n\nThe malware can detect whether it is running in a virtual environment and will generate false\nindicators in such cases. The malware is polymorphic, which means it changes every time it\nis downloaded. That makes it difficult to detect using the signature-based detection methods\nemployed by standard anti-virus software.\n\nThe malware also has worm-like features which allows it to rapidly spread to other networked\ncomputers. Emotet is also capable of spamming and forwarding itself to email contacts. As if\ninfection with Emotet is not bad enough, it can also download other malware variants onto\ninfected devices.\n\nEmotet malware is one of the most destructive malware variants currently in use and\ncleaning up Emotet attacks can be incredibly costly. The Department of Homeland Security\nhas reported that some attacks on state, local, tribal, and territorial governments have cost\nmore than $1 million to resolve.\n\nEmotet malware is primarily distributed via spam email, either through malicious attachments\nor hyperlinks to websites where the malware is silently downloaded. The lures used in the\nmessages are highly varied and include most of the commonly used phishing lures such as\nshipping notifications, fake invoices, payment requests, PayPal receipts.\n\nNow the threat actors behind the malware have adopted a new tactic to increase infection\nrates. Once installed on a device, the malware accesses email conversation threads and\nforwards the message to individuals named in the thread.\n\nThe original email conversation is unaltered, but a hyperlink is added to the top of the\nmessage. The link directs the recipient to a webpage where a file download is triggered.\nOpening the document and enabling macros will see Emotet downloaded. Email attachments\nmay also be added to previous conversation threads in place of hyperlinks.\n\nSince the messages come from a known individual with whom an email conversation has\ntaken place in the past, the probability of the document being opened is greater than if\nmessages come out of the blue or are sent from an unknown individual.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral cybersecurity firms have identified a campaign using this tactic, including phishing\nintelligence provider Cofense and security researcher Marcus Hutchins (MalwareTech).\n\nThe current campaign uses revived conversations from before November 2018, although\nmore recent conversations may be revived in further campaigns. Any revived old email\nconversation that contains a link or an attachment could indicate a user has been targeted\nand that at least one member of the email exchange has been infected with Emotet.\n\nThe current campaign is not only extensive, it is also proving to be extremely successful.\nSpamhaus reports that there have been 47,000 new infections in the past two months alone,\nwhile Cofense reports that it has identified more than 700,000 infections in the past 12\nmonths.\n\nProtecting against this dangerous malware requires a powerful anti-spam solution and good\nsecurity awareness training for staff. SpamTitan’s new features can help to detect malicious\nemails spreading Emotet malware to better protect businesses from attack.\n\nTo find out more about SpamTitan and how the solution can protect your business, give\nTitanHQ a call today.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S0OSwl1NQ1s\n\n\n-----",
