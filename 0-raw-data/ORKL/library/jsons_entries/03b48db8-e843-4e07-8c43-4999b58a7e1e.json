The apps conduct spyware\nactivities by offering escort services while they steal personal information from the victim’s device. The goal\nof the attackers behind this data exfiltration of personal information is extortion or blackmail.\n\nThis particular type of scam is commonly called “Sextortion” and it typically targets multiple countries.\nThese applications are often disguised as messaging, camera, and utility apps and are designed\nto exfiltrate data such as:\n\nContacts\nSMS data\nLocation information\nImages from device storage\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nDuring our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a [Twitter post that](https://twitter.com/malwaremansys/status/1432974978589229057)\nmentioned spyware masquerading as a Korean video app named “동영상“.\n\nResearchers at Cyble downloaded the malware samples and performed a detailed\nanalysis, based on which, we determined that the malware is a variant of spyware and uploads\nthe victim data to a Command & Control (C2) server.\n\n## APK Metadata Information\n\nApp Name: 동영상\nPackage Name: org.nnnmbook.sytyd\nSHA256 Hash: 0bda73046fd733164877071d11318ec6dd56a6ea4e773c70ed5a3c8f7a244478\n\nFigure 1 represents the metadata information of the application.\n\n_Figure 1 Metadata_\n\n_Information_\nThe malware has a set of permissions, out of which the\nattackers leverage three permissions to collect contacts, SMSs, and the victim’s location. These dangerous\npermissions are listed in Table 1.\n\n**Permissions** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nINTERNET Allows applications to open network sockets\n\nREAD_PHONE_STATE Read-only access to phone state\n\nREAD_CONTACTS Access to phone contacts\n\n_Table 1 Permission used for malicious activity_\nUpon simulating the app, we observed that it initially requests users for permission to read contacts. Once\nthe app has this permission, it loads the app’s main activity, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2 App Flow_\n\nThe app uses the permissions granted by the users to perform these activities on the users’ devices:\n\nThe app reads the contacts from the compromised device and stores them in the array list\n\n_Figure 3 Reads and_\n\n_collects the contacts from the compromised device_\n\nCollected contacts are stored in a JSON file and are uploaded to a C2 link as shown in figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Collected Contact_\n\n_data are stored in JSON file and uploaded via C2 link_\n\nThe application also has a code function to read and collect SMS data from the compromised device.\n\n_Figure 5 Collects Message details from the compromised device_\n\nAs shown in Figure 6, the collected SMS details are stored in a JSON file and are uploaded to the C2\nlink as represented below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Uploads the collected_\n\n_SMS details to the C2 link_\n\nUpon finding the functions being called, where the collected contacts and messages are sent via C2\nlink, the app further connects to the function that performs additional activities such as collecting\nalbums and device details.\n\n_Figure 7 Sensitive information collected from the app_\n\nThe app synchronizes the user’s device data with the C2 login page used by the attacker to fetch the\nstored sensitive information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Collects_\n\n_the device data and uploads it to the C2 server_\n\n## Conclusion \n\nDespite having been around for a long time, spyware still poses a significant threat as the Threat\nActors responsible are constantly adapting and using various encryption techniques to avoid detection.\nThis makes the removal of spyware nearly impossible. Thus, users should exercise caution while installing\napplications.\n\n## SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nKeep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.\nUninstall the application if you find this malware on your device.\nKeep your system and applications updated to the latest versions.\nUse strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.\nDownload and install software only from trusted sites and official app stores.\nVerify the privileges and permissions requested by apps before granting them access.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques- for Mobile\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n**Defense Evasion** [T1406](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406/) Obfuscated Files or Information\n\n**Credential Access/Collection** [T1412](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412/) Capture SMS Messages\n\n**Discovery** [T1421](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1421/) System Network Connections Discovery\n\n**Discovery** [T1426](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1426/) System Information Discovery\n\n\n-----\n\n**Collection** [T1432](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1432/) Access Contact List\n\n**Collection** [T1507](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1507/) Network Information Discovery\n\n**Impact** [T1447](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1447/) Delete Device Data\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n**0bda73046fd733164877071d11318ec6dd56a6ea4e773c70ed5a3c8f7a244478** SHA 256\nFile\nHash\n\n\n**Description**\n\nAnalysed\nMalicious\nfile\n\n\n**hxxp://206.119.173[.]23:8080/m/uploadSms.htm** URL C2 Link\n\n**hxxp://206.119.173[.]23:8080/m/sychonizeUser.htm** URL C2 Link\n\n**hxxp://206.119.173[.]23:8080/m/openVip.htm** URL C2 Link\n\n**hxxp://206.119.173[.]23:8080/m/login.htm** URL C2 Link\n\n**hxxp://206.119.173[.]23:8080/m/uploadAlbum.htm** URL C2 Link\n\n## About Cyble \n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from](https://cyble.com/)\ncybercrimes and exposure on the dark web.
