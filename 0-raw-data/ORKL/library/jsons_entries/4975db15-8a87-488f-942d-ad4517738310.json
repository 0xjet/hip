Basta\n\n**zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/back-black-basta**\n\n## Key Points\n\nBlackBasta emerged in February 2022 with double extortion ransomware attacks\nagainst organizations\nThe threat group exfiltrates sensitive information from organizations before performing\nfile encryption and demanding a ransom payment\nThe previous version of BlackBasta shared many similarities to the now defunct Conti\nransomware, although the malware code itself was novel\nIn November 2022, BlackBasta ransomware received significant updates including the\nfile encryption algorithms, introduction of stack-based string obfuscation, and per victim\nfile extensions\nThe ransomware code modifications are likely an attempt to better evade antivirus and\nEDR detection\n\nZscaler ThreatLabz has been tracking prominent ransomware families and their tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) including the BlackBasta ransomware family. On\nNovember 16, 2022, ThreatLabz identified new samples of the BlackBasta ransomware that\nhad significantly lower antivirus detection rates. The latest BlackBasta code has numerous\ndifferences compared to the original BlackBasta ransomware. The changes from the\nprevious version include replacing the file encryption algorithms and switching from the GNU\nMultiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) to the Crypto++ encryption library. Many of the\nmalware’s strings have been obfuscated and the filenames have been randomized, which\n\n\n-----\n\nmay hinder static-based antivirus detection and behavioral-based EDR detection. This blog\nfocuses on these recent changes to BlackBasta. Since the current BlackBasta codebase is\nquite different from the original, ThreatLabz refers to this new version as BlackBasta 2.0.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe following sections analyze the changes to the BlackBasta ransomware including the\nstring obfuscation, file encryption and compare various features that have been added,\nremoved or modified.\n\n## String Obfuscation\n\nSimilar to Conti ransomware, the BlackBasta ransomware developer appears to be\nexperimenting with stack-based string obfuscation using ADVObfuscator. Figure 1 shows an\nexample obfuscated string that is constructed on the stack and decoded using an XOR\noperation with a single byte.\n\n_Figure 1. BlackBasta 2.0 stack-based string obfuscation example_\n\nCurrently, not all strings in the ransomware are obfuscated, but it is likely that more strings\nwill be obfuscated soon.\n\n## File Encryption\n\nPerhaps the most significant modifications in BlackBasta 2.0 is to the encryption algorithms.\nPrevious versions of BlackBasta ransomware used a per victim asymmetric 4,096-bit RSA\npublic key and a per file ChaCha20 symmetric key. The RSA algorithm was implemented\nusing the [GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). In the latest version of](https://gmplib.org/)\nBlackBasta ransomware, the encryption algorithms have been replaced with Elliptic Curve\nCryptography (ECC) and XChaCha20. The encryption library used to implement these\n\n\n-----\n\n[algorithms in BlackBasta 2.0 is Crypto++. The elliptic curve used by BlackBasta 2.0 is NIST](https://www.cryptopp.com/)\nP-521 (aka secp521r1). An example hardcoded NIST P-521 public key embedded in a\nBlackBasta 2.0 sample is shown below:\n```\nPublic-Key: (521 bit)\n\npub:\n\n  04:00:52:1f:d8:b3:65:b7:9c:30:bd:fa:1c:88:cc:\n\n  77:77:81:f6:50:9d:d9:17:8d:17:d8:fa:3a:8c:b0:\n\n  f2:6f:87:21:0c:95:db:94:f5:9c:bf:fd:ca:f0:8d:\n\n  19:6a:9c:2f:9f:4b:96:20:31:95:41:54:3e:92:43:\n\n  ed:7b:d1:81:8c:58:78:01:2e:31:b8:02:7a:c1:b9:\n\n  7f:2f:b4:b2:ba:aa:df:ed:68:a2:df:eb:90:4a:4f:\n\n  da:28:10:db:f5:ae:12:08:cf:dd:1f:10:80:48:00:\n\n  32:38:1d:23:40:0c:ca:05:2c:5c:d2:79:1d:ae:8f:\n\n  0a:74:a1:1c:79:b3:0c:38:21:aa:94:1a:4f\n\nASN1 OID: secp521r1\n\nNIST CURVE: P-521\n\nwriting EC key\n\n-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----\nMIGbMBAGByqGSM49AgEGBSuBBAAjA4GGAAQAUh/Ys2W3nDC9+hyIzHd3gfZQndkX\n\njRfY+jqMsPJvhyEMlduU9Zy//crwjRlqnC+fS5YgMZVBVD6SQ+170YGMWHgBLjG4\n\nAnrBuX8vtLK6qt/taKLf65BKT9ooENv1rhIIz90fEIBIADI4HSNADMoFLFzSeR2u\n\njwp0oRx5sww4IaqUGk8=\n\n-----END PUBLIC KEY----\n```\nThe encryption process used by BlackBasta 2.0 leverages the Crypto++ Elliptic Curve\nIntegrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) in Diffie-Hellman Augmented Encryption Scheme\n(DHAES) mode (also known as DHIES to avoid confusion with the Advanced Encryption\nStandard) to generate a per file XChaCha20 and a hash-based message authentication code\n(HMAC). BlackBasta appends a 314-byte footer to files after encryption has been completed\nas shown below in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Example BlackBasta 2.0 encrypted file footer_\n\nThe first 133-bytes (in blue) are an ephemeral NIST P-521 public key generated per file. The\nnext 56 bytes are an encrypted per file XChaCha20 32-byte key and 24-byte nonce (in\ngreen), followed by a 20-byte HMAC (in red). This is followed by NULL byte padding and a\ntwo-byte value (in orange) for the size of the cryptographic material. The last 12 bytes (in\npurple) are a marker (e.g., j4ftnwzxbrf), which changes per victim that the BlackBasta\ndecryption tool can use to identify encrypted files.\n\nThe encryption process starts by generating an ephemeral NIST P-521 key pair. The\ncorresponding private key is then used to generate a shared secret with the hardcoded\npublic key using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. The result is passed to the key derivation\n[function KDF2 to produce 72 pseudorandom bytes. The first 16-bytes are used as a HMAC](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/P1363_KDF2)\nkey and the subsequent 56 bytes are used as an XOR key to encrypt the file’s XChaCha20\nkey and nonce (shown above in green). The per file XChaCha20 key and nonce are\ngenerated using the Crypto++ random number generator library. The HMAC is calculated\nwith the ciphertext using the SHA1 hash algorithm. The result can be used for message\nverification with the 20 bytes in the footer (shown in red).\n\nTo optimize for speed, BlackBasta encrypts files differently with XChaCha20 based on the\nfile's size. If the file is less than 5,000 bytes the full file is encrypted in blocks of 64 bytes. If\nthe file size is greater than 64 bytes and not an even multiple of 64 bytes, the last 64 byte\nblock will not be encrypted. If the file size is less than or equal to 1,073,741,824\n(0x40000000) bytes (i.e., 1GB), BlackBasta alternates encrypting 64 byte blocks followed by\n128 bytes that are skipped (i.e., not encrypted) until the end of the file is reached as shown in\nFigure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Example file with null bytes encrypted by BlackBasta 2.0 ransomware alternating_\n_between encrypted and unencrypted blocks_\n\nIf the file is larger than 1GB, BlackBasta will first encrypt the first 5,064 bytes, skip 6,336\nbytes, encrypt 64 bytes, skip 6,336 bytes, and so on until the end of the file has been\nreached. The XChaCha20 encryption code is shown in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4. BlackBasta 2.0 XChaCha20 file encryption code_\n\nAfter encryption is complete, BlackBasta 2.0 renames the filename with a hardcoded pervictim extension such as .agnkdbd5y, .taovhsr3u or .tcw9lnz6q. The previous version of\nBlackBasta used only .basta for the encrypted file extension.\n\nThe encrypted ransom files’ icon image has also been modified from a white box to a red box\nas shown in Figure 5.\n\n_Figure 5. BlackBasta (original and new) encrypted file icon images_\n\nWhile this change is rather small, this may be sufficient to bypass static signatures that\nantivirus products may use to detect BlackBasta.\n\n## Ransom Note\n\n\n-----\n\n[BlackBasta 2.0 has modified the ransom note text as shown in Figure 6.](https://github.com/threatlabz/ransomware_notes/blob/main/blackbasta/blackbasta3.txt)\n\n_Figure 6. Example BlackBasta 2.0 ransom note (November 2022)_\n\nThe ransom note filename has also changed from readme.txt to instructions_read_me.txt.\nBlackBasta 2.0 opens the ransom note in Windows Notepad via the command cmd.exe /c\n_start /MAX notepad.exe._\n\n## BlackBasta Feature Parity\n\nTable 1 compares the features between BlackBasta versions 1.0 and 2.0.\n\n**Feature** **BlackBasta 1.0** **BlackBasta 2.0**\n\nEncryption library GMP Crypto++\n\nAsymmetric encryption 4,096-bit RSA NIST P-521\n\n\n-----\n\nSymmetric encryption ChaCha20 XChaCha20\n\nChange encrypted file icon Yes Yes\n\nEncrypted file extension .basta .[a-z0-9]{9}\n\nChange desktop wallpaper Yes No\n\nReadme filename readme.txt instructions_read_me.txt\n\nString obfuscation No Yes\n\nTerminate processes and services Yes No\n\nDelete shadow copies Yes Yes / No (varies between samples)\n\nEncrypted file icon name fkdjsadasd.ico fkdjsadasd.ico\n\nMutex name dsajdhas.0 ofijweiuhuewhcsaxs.mutex\n\n_Table 1. Feature parity between BlackBasta 1.0 and BlackBasta 2.0_\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned differences, BlackBasta 2.0 no longer changes the victim’s\ndesktop wallpaper, nor terminates processes and services that may interfere with file\nencryption. The mutex name has also been updated.\n\nThe number of command-line parameters has also been modified as shown in Table 2.\n\n\n**Command-line**\n**parameter**\n\n\n**BlackBasta**\n**1.0**\n\n\n**BlackBasta**\n**2.0**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n-threads No Yes Number of threads to use for\nencryption\n\n-nomutex No Yes Do not create a mutex\n\n\n-----\n\n-forcepath Yes Yes Encrypt files in the specified path\n\n\n-bomb Yes (in newer\nbuilds)\n\n\nNo Spread via ActiveDirectory and\nlaunch ransomware\n\n\n_Table 2. Comparison between BlackBasta command-line parameters_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMembers of the Conti ransomware group appear to have splintered into multiple threat\ngroups including BlackBasta, which has become one of the most significant ransomware\nthreats. ThreatLabz has observed more than five victims that have been compromised by\nBlackBasta 2.0 since the new version’s release in mid November 2022. This demonstrates\nthat the threat group is very successful at compromising organizations and the latest version\nof the ransomware will likely enable them to better evade antivirus and EDRs.\n\n## Cloud Sandbox Detection\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects\nindicators related to BlackBasta at various levels with the following threat names:\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA256 Hash Description\n\ne28188e516db1bda9015c30de59a2e91996b67c2e2b44989a6b0f562577fd757 BlackBasta\n2.0 sample\n(executable)\n\nc4c8be0c939e4c24e11bad90549e3951b7969e78056d819425ca53e87af8d8ed BlackBasta\n2.0 sample\n(executable)\n\n350ba7fca67721c74385faff083914ecdd66ef107a765dfb7ac08b38d5c9c0bd BlackBasta\n2.0 sample\n(executable)\n\n51eb749d6cbd08baf9d43c2f83abd9d4d86eb5206f62ba43b768251a98ce9d3e BlackBasta\n2.0 sample\n(DLL)\n\n07117c02a09410f47a326b52c7f17407e63ba5e6ff97277446efc75b862d2799 BlackBasta\n2.0 sample\n(DLL)\n\n[These IOCs are also provided in the ThreatLabz GitHub repository here.](https://github.com/threatlabz/iocs/tree/main/blackbasta)\n\n# Security Research\n\n Ransomware\n\n\n-----",
