Over the past three months, Recorded\nFuture’s Insikt Group has observed an increase in APT33’s (also\nknown as Elfin) infrastructure building and targeting activity, and on\n[June 21, 2019, Yahoo! News reported that the U.S. Cyber Command](https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-secretly-struck-back-against-iranian-cyber-spies-targeting-us-ships-234520824.html)\nlaunched cyberattacks on an “Iranian spy group.”\n\nIranian state-sponsored threat actor APT33 has been conducting\n[cyberespionage activity since at least 2013, predominantly targeting](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)\nnations in the Middle East, but also notably targeting U.S., South\nKorean, and European commercial entities across a wide variety of\nsectors.\n\nInsikt Group researchers used proprietary methods, including\nRecorded Future Domain Analysis and Recorded Future Network\nTraffic Analysis, along with other common analytical approaches, to\n[profile recently reported Iranian threat actor APT33’s domain and](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\nhosting infrastructure in an effort to identify recent activity and\nbetter understand the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs).\n\nOur research found that APT33, or a closely aligned threat actor,\ncontinues to conduct and prepare for widespread cyberespionage\nactivity, with over 1,200 domains used since March 28, 2019 and\nwith a strong emphasis on using commodity malware. Commodity\nmalware is an attractive option for nation-state threat actors who\nwish to conduct computer network operations at scale and hide in\nplain sight among the noise of other threat actor activities, thus\nhindering attribution efforts\n\n\n-----\n\n[The targeting of mainly Saudi Arabian organizations across a wide](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/industry-saudi-arabia-us-targeted-apt33-elfin/article/1580402)\nvariety of industries aligns with historical targeting patterns for\nthe group, which appear undeterred following previous exposés of\ntheir activity. Western and Saudi — both public and private sector\n— organizations in industries that have been historically targeted\nby APT33 should be monitoring geopolitical developments and\nincreasing the scrutiny of operational security controls focusing\non detection and remediation of initial unauthorized access,\nspecifically from phishing campaigns, webshells, and third-party\n(vendor and supplier) relationships. Additionally, real-time security\nintelligence should be used to improve hunting in internal network\nand host-based telemetry.\n\n### Key Judgments\n\n[• In response to the publication of operations in late March](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\n\n2019, domains associated with suspected APT33 activity were\nparked or changed to new hosting providers.\n\n - APT33, or a closely aligned threat actor, continues to control\n\nC2 domains in bulk.\n\n    - Over 1,200 domains have been in use since March 28,\n\n2019 alone.\n\n    - 728 of these were identified communicating with\n\ninfected hosts.\n\n    - 575 of the 728 domains were observed communicating\n\nwith hosts infected by one of 19 mostly publicly\navailable RATs.\n\n - Almost 60% of the suspected APT33 domains that were\n\nclassified to malware families related to njRAT infections,\na RAT not previously associated with APT33 activity. Other\ncommodity RAT malware families, such as AdwindRAT and\nRevengeRAT, were also linked to suspected APT33 domain\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n - We assess with medium confidence that APT33, or a closely\n\naligned threat actor, has targeted the following organizations\nsince the disclosures in late March:\n\n    - A conglomerate headquartered in Saudi Arabia, with\n\nbusinesses in the engineering and construction,\nutilities, technology, retail, aviation, and finance sectors\n\n    - Two Saudi healthcare organizations\n\n    - A Saudi company in the metals industry\n\n    - An Indian mass media company\n\n    - A delegation from a diplomatic institution\n\n - We assess that the recent reporting on links between the\n\nNasr Institute and Kavosh Security Group, as well as technical\nand persona analysis, overlaps among APT33, APT35, and\nMUDDYWATER, and is probably a result of the tiered structure\nthat Iran utilizes to manage cyber operations.\n\n### Background\n\nAPT33 is an Iranian state-sponsored threat actor that has engaged\nin cyberespionage activities since at least 2013. They have typically\nused [commodity](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html) [malware and possess an](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage) [expansive network](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\n[infrastructure that enables them to scale their operations for victim](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\ntargeting. Historically, this targeting has focused on the aerospace\nand defense industries, as well as the oil and gas industry, with\na strong focus on companies based in Saudi Arabia. [Symantec’s](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\n[Elfin report denoted additional targeting of the engineering,](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\nchemical, research, finance, IT, and healthcare sectors. Recorded\nFuture’s Insikt Group has been monitoring APT33 activity, beginning\nwith research published in October 2017, which revealed new\ninfrastructure, malware hashes, and TTPs relating to the threat\nactor(s).\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Analysis\n\n[On March 27, 2019, Symantec published research titled, “Elfin:](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\n[Relentless Espionage Group Targets Multiple Organizations in](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\n[Saudi Arabia and U.S.” The report outlined a three- year APT33](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\ncyberespionage campaign. Using the IP addresses and malware\nhashes provided in that research, Insikt Group researchers\nconducted a follow-up analysis of the malicious domains used by\nAPT33 to determine two things:\n\n1. Whether or not APT33 had continued their activities, and if so,\n\nif they had changed TTPs in response to the publication\n\n2. Whether or not there were any previously unreported\n\nhistoric activities conducted by the group that were worthy of\npublication\n\n**Nasr Institute and Kavosh Redux**\n\n[In our previous report, “Iran’s Hacker Hierarchy Exposed,” we](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/)\nconcluded that the exposure of one APT33 contractor, the Nasr\nInstitute, by FireEye in 2017, along with our intelligence on the\ncomposition and motivations of the Iranian hacker community,\npointed to a tiered structure within Iran’s state-sponsored offensive\ncyber program. We assessed that many\n\nAccording to a sensitive Insikt Group source who provided\ninformation for previous research, these organizations employed a\nmid-level tier of ideologically aligned task managers responsible for\nthe compartmentalized tasking of over 50 contracting organizations,\nwho conducted activities such as vulnerability research, exploit\ndevelopment, reconnaissance, and the conducting of network\nintrusions or attacks. Each of these discrete components, in\ndeveloping an offensive cyber capability, were purposefully\nassigned to different contracting groups to protect the integrity\nof overarching operations and to ensure the IRGC and/or MOIS\nretained control of operations and mitigated the risk from rogue\nhackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obfuscating Iranian government involvement in offensive campaigns._\n\nFireEye also noted in their 2017 report that the online handle\n“xman_1365_x,” found within the PDB path in an APT33 TURNEDUP\nbackdoor sample, belonged to an individual at the Nasr Institute.\nThe same handle was then linked to destructive operations using\nNewsBeef and StoneDrill malware families. Then, in March 2017,\n[researchers linked StoneDrill to the Shamoon 2 operation and to](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56929/cyber-crime/stonedrill-wiper-shamoon.html)\nthe APT35 (also known as Charming Kitten, Newscaster, or NewBeef)\nthreat actor.\n\nOur [previous analyses showed that the person behind the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/)\n“xman_1365_x” handle self-identified on Iranian hacking forums\nas Mahdi Honarvar from Mashhad, with [speculation that he was](https://irancybernews.org/news/318/)\nalso affiliated with the Kavosh Security Center since around 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nKavosh’s role within the Iranian cyber ecosystem was further\nuncovered by Group-IB’s [recent analysis detailing that Kavosh](https://www.group-ib.ru/blog/muddywater)\nwas the employer for “Nima Nikjoo” between 2006 and 2014.\nTheir analysis concluded that a March 2019 campaign targeting\na Turkish military electronics manufacturer was perpetrated by\nanother Iranian threat actor, MUDDYWATER. MUDDYWATER used\nthe POWERSTATS backdoor, proliferated in maldocs that contained\nmetadata revealing the author as “Gladiyator_CRK,” with a possible\nname of “Nima.” Additionally, an email address suspected to be\nrelated, “gladiyator_cracker@yahoo.com,” was associated with\n[“     ,” which translates to “Nima Nickjou,” in a 2014 blog that](https://irankhabarestan.blogspot.com/2014/08/blog-post_20.html)\nexposed the names and email addresses of individuals allegedly\n[employed at the Nasr Institute. Another research blog authored by](https://0xffff0800.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-muddywater-cyber-spy.html)\npseudonym “0xffff0800” corroborated some of these findings and\nrevealed “Nima Nikjoo” to be “Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi.”\n\n_LinkedIn profile picture of suspected APT33 threat actor Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi. (Accessed on June 14, 2019)_\n\n**Who Is Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi?**\n\nOSINT reveals there is an active Linkedin account and other active\nsocial media accounts in the name of Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi, claiming\nthat he is a reverse engineer and malware analyst at Symantec.\nSymantec, however, has confirmed to Recorded Future that Tabrizi\nhas never worked for them:\n\n_“We have been aware of this individual for a long time. Nima Nikjoo is not a Symantec_\n_employee and we have no record of an individual by this name working at Symantec.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving been exposed working for the Nasr Institute, a government\norganization, and the [Kavosh Security Center, which has strong](https://www.group-ib.ru/blog/muddywater)\nassociations with Iranian state-sponsored cyberespionage\nactivity, we assess with high confidence that Tabrizi is engaged in\ncyberespionage activity on behalf of the Iranian state.\n\n_Employment history of suspected APT33 threat actor Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi._\n\nBased on this information, it is possible that upon the exposure of\nthe Nasr Institute as a front for Iranian state-sponsored offensive\ncyber activity, employees transitioned over to other entities, such as\nKavosh, to protect their identities and minimize further exposure.\nThere were no further widely reported exposures relating to the\nNasr Institute until the links between Mahdi Honarvar to Kavosh\nSecurity Center were revealed in 2017. Therefore, we assess that\nthe overlapping technical and personal information points to\na historic linkage between the threat actors APT33, APT35, and\nMUDDYWATER.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese technical and persona overlaps among Iranian threat\nactors are not unexpected given the tiered structure of Iranian\nstate management of cyber operations. Within this structure, we\nassessed that managers are running multiple teams, some of which\nare associated with government organizations and others that are\n[contracted private companies (such as ITSec Team).](https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/834996/download)\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n**APT33 Cleaning Up?**\n\nStarting with the APT33 indicators documented by Symantec, Insikt\nGroup profiled the domain and hosting infrastructure used by the\ngroup using the Farsight Security extension within the Recorded\nFuture platform, revealing updated IP resolutions for some of the\ndomains.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Domain|Original IP Resolution (Per Symantec Report)|Updated IP Resolutions|\n|---|---|---|\n|backupnet.ddns[.]net|5.187.21[.]71 91.230.121[.]143|95.183.54[.]119|\n|hyperservice.ddns[.]net|8.26.21[.]119|95.183.54[.]119|\n|microsoftupdated[.]com|5.187.21[.]70|52.45.178[.]122|\n|mynetwork[.]cf|192.119.15[.]41 195.20.52[.]172|195.20.52[.]172|\n|mynetwork.ddns[.]net|162.250.145[.]204 162.250.145[.]234 192.119.15[.]35 192.119.15[.]37 64.251.19[.]214 64.251.19[.]231 64.251.19[.]232 8.26.21[.]120 8.26.21[.]221 8.26.21[.]222|No Current Resolution|\n|mypsh.ddns[.]net|5.79.127[.]177|0.0.0[.]0|\n|mywinnetwork.ddns[.]net|91.235.142[.]76 91.235.142[.]124 89.34.237[.]118|0.0.0[.]0|\n|remote-server.ddns[.]net|192.119.15[.]39 91.230.121[.]143|0.0.0[.]0|\n|remserver.ddns[.]net|217.147.168[.]44 91.230.121[.]144|0.0.0[.]0|\n|securityupdated[.]com|217.13.103[.]46|204.11.56[.]48|\n|servhost.hopto[.]org|37.48.105[.]178|95.183.54[.]119 0.0.0[.]0|\n|service-avant[.]com|213.252.244[.]14|213.252.244[.]144 51.77.102[.]108|\n|srvhost.servehttp[.]com|8.26.21[.]117 64.251.19[.]216|95.183.54[.]119|\n|svcexplores[.]com|188.165.4[.]81|-|\n|update-sec[.]com|95.211.191[.]117|-|\n\n\n-----\n\nAs expected, many of the domains exposed in the original Symantec\nreport have been parked or no longer resolve to a real IPv4 address.\nInterestingly, four of the original domains (backupnet.ddns[.]\nnet, hyperservice.ddns[.]net, servhost.hopto[.]org, and srvhost.\nservehttp[.]com) were all updated the day after publication, and\nresolve to the same IP, 95.183.54[.]119.

The fact that this activity was\nexecuted just a day or so after the report went live suggests the\nIranian threat actors are acutely aware of the media coverage of\ntheir activities and are resourceful enough to be able to react in a\nquick manner.\n\n|Targeted Organization|Sector(s)|Country of Operation|Date of Observed Activity|Suspected APT33 C2 IP|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Organization 1|Engineering & Construction, Water & Elec­ tricity, Technology, Retail Finance|Saudi Arabia UAE Egypt Turkey Croatia|May 2 - June 3, 2019|134.3.20[.]151|\n|Organization 2|Mass Media|India|May 4 - June 1, 2019|134.3.20[.]151|\n|Organization 3|Diplomatic|Burkina Faso|May 2, 2019|134.3.20[.]151|\n|Organizations 4 and 5|Healthcare|Saudi Arabia|May 2 - May 8, 2019|41.103.3[.]7 46.249.47[.]193|\n|Organization 6|Industrial|Saudi Arabia|May 25 - June 3, 2019|62.113.171[.]186|\n\n\n-----\n\nSince late March, suspected APT33 threat actors have continued\nto use a large swath of operational infrastructure, well in excess\nof 1,200 domains, with many observed communicating with 19\ndifferent commodity RAT implants. An interesting development\nappears to be their increased preference for njRAT, with over half\nof the observed suspected APT33 infrastructure being linked to\nnjRAT deployment.\n\nWhile we haven’t observed a widespread targeting of commercial\nentities or regional adversaries like in previously documented\nAPT33 operations, the handful of targeted organizations that we\ndid observe were mainly located in Saudi Arabia across a range of\nindustries, indicating ongoing targeting aligned with geopolitical\naims. We assess that the large amount of infrastructure uncovered\nin our research is likely indicative of wider ongoing operational\nactivity, or the laying of groundwork for future cyberespionage\noperations. We recommend organizations take measures to monitor\ntheir networks for evidence of suspected APT33 activity by following\nthe guidance in the “Network Defense Recommendations” section\nbelow.\n\nFinally, our recommendation to Recorded Future clients is to use\nour upcoming “Weaponized Domains” Certified Data Set, which has\nbeen derived from predictive analytics that assist in the identification\nof malicious APT infrastructure. This is meant to empower your\nsecurity teams to hunt, detect, and block high-fidelity malicious\nindicators at scale.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Network Defense Recommendations\n\nRecorded Future recommends that organizations conduct the\nfollowing measures in order to detect and mitigate suspected\nAPT33 activity:\n\n - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion\n\nprevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms\nin place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking\nillicit connection attempts from — the external IP addresses\nand domains listed in Appendix A.\n\n - As detailed in our previous blog on APT33 available to our\n\nclients only, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) continues to be a relevant\noperational choke point for security control implementation.\nAll TCP/UDP network traffic involving DDNS subdomains\n[should be blocked and logged (using DNS RPZ or similar).](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-rpz-00)\n\n - Conduct regular Yara scans across your enterprise for the new\n\nrules listed in Appendix B.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix B — Yara Rules\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix D ­— MITRE Pre-ATT&CK Mapping\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk. Our technology\n\nautomatically collects and analyzes information from an unrivaled breadth of\n\nsources and provides invaluable context in real time and packaged for human\n\nanalysis or integration with security technologies.\n\n\n-----",
