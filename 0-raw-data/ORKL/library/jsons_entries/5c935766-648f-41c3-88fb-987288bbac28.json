The infection is known to occur when a\nuser opens a malicious Word file (hereafter Maldoc) attached to the spear-phishing email.\n(Excel files were also abused in the early days.)\n\nAccording to information released by security vendors, APT campaigns using LODEINFO\ntarget Japanese media, diplomacy, public institutions, defense industries, and think tanks.\nIt is also suggested that the infamous APT group called APT10 is involved given the\nsimilarities in their methods and malwares.\n\n**LODEINFO malware: published information up to 2022**\n\n[• APT10 HUNTER RISE ver3.0: Repel new malware LODEINFO, DOWNJPIT and](https://hitcon.org/2021/agenda/6d88317b-4d90-4249-ba87-d81c80a21382/APT10%20HUNTER%20RISE%20ver3.0%20Repel%20new%20malware%20LODEINFO%20DOWNJPIT%20and%20LilimRAT.pdf)\n[LilimRAT](https://hitcon.org/2021/agenda/6d88317b-4d90-4249-ba87-d81c80a21382/APT10%20HUNTER%20RISE%20ver3.0%20Repel%20new%20malware%20LODEINFO%20DOWNJPIT%20and%20LilimRAT.pdf)\n\n[• APT10: Tracking down LODEINFO 2022, part I](https://securelist.com/apt10-tracking-down-lodeinfo-2022-part-i/107742/)\n\n[• Unmasking MirrorFace: Operation LiberalFace targeting Japanese political entities](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/12/14/unmasking-mirrorface-operation-liberalface-targeting-japanese-political-entities/)\n\n[• Fighting to LODEINFO: Investigation for Continuous Cyberespionage Based on](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2023/pdf/JSAC2023_1_6_minakawa-saika-kubokawa_jp.pdf)\n[Open Source](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2023/pdf/JSAC2023_1_6_minakawa-saika-kubokawa_jp.pdf)\n\n[• LODEINFO, a malware targeting organizations in Japan](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/ja/2020/02/LODEINFO.html)\n\n[• The evolution of LODEINFO malware](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/ja/2020/06/LODEINFO-2.html)\n\nAttacks using LODEINFO have continued in 2023, with multiple versions of the malware\nbeing discovered. The malware is still being actively developed, as evidenced by the\nfrequency of its version updates.\n\nFigure 1. Evolution of LODEINFO\n\nFor information on version updates prior to September 2022, please refer to the following\narticle:\n[APT10: Tracking down LODEINFO 2022, part II](https://securelist.com/apt10-tracking-down-lodeinfo-2022-part-ii/107745/)\n\nWe analyzed each version of the LODEINFO malware and identified changes\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our analysis, the malware has been updated with new features, as well as\nchanges to the anti-analysis (analysis avoidance) techniques and the implementation of\nnew features. This suggests that the attackers are focusing on concealing their Tactics,\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs), including malware.\n\nDue to the limited information on the detection, it is likely to expect that the detection of\nLODEINFO is becoming difficult. In 2023, only a limited number of LODEINFO samples\nwere discovered, and the results of their investigation and analysis were not widely made\npublic.\n\nAs of the publication of this post (January 24, 2024), we have observed a new version of\nLODEINFO, v0.7.3. In this article, we will detail the updates made to LODEINFO that\nhave been observed from the end of 2022 to January 2024, including v0.7.3.\n\n## Analysis of LODEINFO\n\n The infection flow\n\nThe following is the infection flow of LODEINFO that was observed in 2023. It shows\nsome changes from the previous versions.\n\n### Update of the Downloader Shellcode\n\nThe initial infection path is the same as previous versions. The Infection starts from\nmalicious Word document (Maldoc), LODEINFO is eventually injected into memory\nleading infection.\n\nIn 2023, the VBA code in this Maldoc was updated. Specifically, VBA code that embedded\nDownloader Shellcodes for both 32-bit and 64-bit was added, and the appropriate\nshellcode is selected depending on the target environment.\n\nThe adoption of 64-bit architecture in Windows OS is a challenge for many organizations,\nand LODEINFO is also likely to have changed to adapt to 64-bit architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. New infection flow implemented since LODEINFO v0.6.8\n\nThe changes in the infection flow were implemented from v0.6.8 to v0.7.1 observed in\n2023 or the later versions.\n\n### Remote Template Injection\n\nIn LODEINFO v0.6.9, we have also observed more complex cases that use Remote\nTemplate Injection in the infection flow described above.\n\n**What is Remote Template Injection?**\nMicrosoft Word has a \"template\" feature that allows users to create files based on\ntemplates created by other users. When a Word file that a template inserted is\nopened, the template is downloaded from the local or remote machine.\nUsing the above \"template\" feature, an attacker can host a Word template file\n(.dotm) containing malicious Macros on their server and have the malicious\ntemplate be retrieved and executed from the attacker's server every time the victim\nopens a Word file that contains the template.\n\nA Word file using Remote Template Injection is opened, it downloads and reads the\ntemplate from the attacker's C2 server.\n\nThe downloaded template is malware that is equivalent to the Maldoc mentioned above,\nand it contains VBA code with the Downloader Shellcode embedded. This eventually calls\nthe LODEINFO main body. The following is an image of the infection flow with Remote\nTemplate Injection added.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Infection flow with Remote Template Injection added\n\nThe attached Word file itself only reads the template, making it difficult to detect as\nmalicious activity. This technique is likely intended to evade detection by security\nproducts.\n\nTo further analyze the structure of the Word file using Remote Template Injection, we can\ncheck the contents of the \\word\\_rels\\settings.xml.rels file in the word file. This will\nshow that the file is designed to read the template file\n```\nhttps://45.76.222[.]130/template.dotm.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Word file’s structure that uses Remote Template Injection\n\n## Maldoc\n\nNext, we will introduce the VBA included in Maldoc.\n\n### VBA code embedded in Maldoc\n\nThe VBA code embedded in Maldoc contains both 64-bit and 32-bit Downloader\nShellcodes.\n\nFigure 5 Part of the VBA code embedded in Maldoc\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Macro first checks the OS architecture of the target device and then executes the\nDownloader Shellcode that matches that architecture.\n\nEach Downloader Shellcode is encoded using Base64 and separated as many split parts.\nThis is thought to be a technique to evade detection by security products.\n\nWhen the Macro is executed, after the split parts are reassembled, the Shellcode\ndecoded using Base64 is injected into memory.\n\nFigure 6. Reassemble the Base64-encoded and split Shellcode\n\n### Microsoft Office language check\n\nThe code to check the language settings of Microsoft Office was deployed in the v0.7.0\nMaldoc. The sample we confirmed checks whether the Office setting is Japanese or not.\nThis is thought to be created to operate only in the target language environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, this feature was removed by the attacker in v0.7.1. In addition, the filename\nof the Maldoc itself has been changed from Japanese to English. From this, we believe\nthat v0.7.1 was likely used to attack environments in languages other than Japanese.\n\n## The Downloader Shellcode\n\nThe Downloader Shellcode used in LODEINFO v0.7.1 is a malware that downloads and\ndecrypts a file disguised as a PEM file (hereinafter referred to as Fake PEM) from the C2\nserver, and finally creates files to infect with LODEINFO.\n\nThe Shellcode itself is a very simple downloader, so we will share the analysis results of\nthe process of decrypting data from the Fake PEM file.\n\n**What is a PEM file?**\nAn abbreviation for Privacy Enhanced Mail file.\nOne of the file formats for keys and certificates used in public key infrastructure\n(PKI). Originally created to improve the security of email, it is now the standard for\ninternet security.\nPEM files are used in the settings of web servers, email servers, and secure\ncommunication protocols (such as HTTPS).\n\n### Fake PEM file decryption\n\nThe Downloader Shellcode downloads the Fake PEM file from the C2 server. The file is\nthen decrypted using the following steps:\n\n1. The header and footer of the Fake PEM file are removed.\n2. The data from step 1 is decoded using Base64.\n3. The first 3 bytes of the data decoded in step 2 are removed.\n4. An HMAC is generated using the SHA1 hash algorithm from the password\n\nhardcoded in the Download Shellcode.\n5. The HMAC generated in step 4 is used as the key for AES, and the data from step 3\n\nis decrypted using AES.\n6. The data decrypted in step 5 is further decoded using a single-byte XOR key.\n\n\n-----\n\n**What is HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)?**\nA code and technique for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of a message using\na one-way hash function. It is widely used in secure communications where it is\nnecessary to verify the sender of the data or that the data has not been tampered\nwith in transit.\n\nThe passwords were hardcoded in the samples we investigated in the following format. If\nthis password is not available, even if the Fake PEM file is successfully obtained, it is\nextremely difficult to decrypt the subsequent data.\n\nFigure 8. Hardcoded passwords required to decrypt the Fake PEM file\n\n### Deployment of LODEINFO Backdoor Shellcode loaded into Memory\n\nThe data decrypted in step 6 is designed with a unique data structure. Objects such as\nthe malicious Frau.dll are embedded in it for use in the next step. We will explain the\ndetails of the structure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Structure of the data restored from the Fake PEM file\n\nThe restored data contains the following multiple objects:\n```\n   Elze.exe\n   Frau.dll\n   Elze.exe_bak\n\n```\nEach object is created in a file by the Downloader Shellcode and installed on the infected\nendpoint. Then, Elze.exe is executed. Elze.exe itself is a legitimate file, but it loads the\nmalicious Frau.dll using DLL side-loading. Frau.dll is a very simple malware that loads\nthe LODEINFO Backdoor Shellcode as a payload into memory.\n\nHowever, in v0.6.6, v0.6.8, and v0.6.9, obfuscation is further strengthened by using\nControl-Flow Flattening (CFF) and Junk code. As you can see in the figure below, the left\nside of the program flow is very complex. The code on the right side of the figure is the\npart of corresponding code, but most of the code is filled with CFF (yellow) and Junk code\n(gray), and only a small amount of malicious code (white) is actually used. This also\nsuggests that the attacker is focusing on obstructing analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Example of a program flow and code obfuscated by CFF and Junk code.\n\nFinally, the Elze.exe_bak file, which is data with the LODEINFO Backdoor Shellcode\nencoded with a single-byte XOR, is read by Frau.dll and decoded as a payload.\n\n**What is Control-Flow Flattening?**\nA technique for making the structure of a program difficult to understand.\nSimple processing is replaced with conditional branching and looping, so the\nprocessing that flows vertically in the control flow becomes arranged horizontally by\nconditional branching and looping. As the control flow becomes flat, the program\nprocessing flow becomes complicated and difficult to analyze.\n\n[Attacking Emotet’s Control Flow Flattening – Sophos News](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/05/04/attacking-emotets-control-flow-flattening/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Similarities with the known downloader DOWNIISSA\n\nBy conducting a detailed analysis, we confirmed that the Downloader Shellcode we found\nand the known downloader DOWNIISSA have three similarities.\n\nHowever, we believe that DOWNIISSA and the Downloader Shellcode we analyzed are\nfrom different malware families based on their structure.\n\nSimilarities:\n\n1. Self-patching mechanism to hide malicious code\n2. Encoding method for C2 server information\n3. Structure of the data decrypted from the Fake PEM file\n\n**Reference**\n[APT10: Tracking down LODEINFO 2022, part I](https://securelist.com/apt10-tracking-down-lodeinfo-2022-part-i/107742/)\n\n**Similarities 1: Self-patching mechanism to hide malicious code**\n\nThe first similarity is the patching mechanism to decode the Shellcode itself.\n\nDOWNIISSA, reported in 2022, had a process to patch the Shellcode itself when the\nShellcode was executed. The newly found Downloader Shellcode also has a selfpatching mechanism.\n\nFigure 11. The self-patching mechanism in Downloader Shellcode\n\nAlthough it is similar in DOWNIISA that it performs self-patching within the Shellcode,\nthere are also clear differences. DOWNIISSA used Base64, but the current Downloader\nShellcode uses XOR decoding. The XOR key is used one by one, increasing from 0x00\nto 0xFF.\n\n**Similarities 2: Encoding method for the C2 server information**\n\nThe second similarity is that the encoding method of the C2 server information embedded\nin the Shellcode is the same. The Downloader Shellcode contains two C2 server\naddresses, which are encoded with a single-byte XOR. The embedding method is also\n\n\n-----\n\nvery similar, not only the encoding method.\n\nFigure 12. C2 server information and the Fake PEM file embedded in the Downloader Shellcode\n\n**Similarities 3: Structure of the data decrypted from the Fake PEM file**\n\nAs mentioned above, the structure of the data decrypted from the Fake PEM file is a\nunique structure, and it has been confirmed that it adopts the same data structure as\nwhich decrypted by DOWNIISA.\n\n## LODEINFO Backdoor Shellcode\n\nLODEINFO Backdoor Shellcode is a fileless malware that allows attackers to remotely\naccess and operate infected hosts. The following features were the same as the\npublished information.\n\nThe C2 server address uses a unique data structure.\nA mechanism that refers to the address of the embedded data is characteristic.\nThe Backdoor Command ID is hidden using 2-bytes XOR.\nThe structure and encryption of the communication data with the C2 server are very\ncomplex, as shown in the figure below.\nThe above encryption uses the Vigenere cipher multiple times.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Overview of the unique data structure and encryption used for communication with the C2\n\nserver\n\nOur analysis of multiple LODEINFO samples found in 2023 revealed the following\ndifferences from previously published information:\n\n1. Change in the hash calculation algorithm for obtaining API function names\n2. Addition of backdoor commands\n\n**Change 1: Change in the hash calculation algorithm for obtaining API function**\n**names**\n\nThe v0.7.0 version uses a new hash calculation algorithm compared to v0.6.9. This\nchange makes it impossible to match signatures using the same rules as previous\nsamples.\n\nThe hash calculation algorithm is used by malware to calculate the hash of API function\nnames and resolve function addresses. The hash calculation logic includes a hard-coded\nXOR key that is different for each sample. This key is used for XOR decoding, so the\nhash values embedded in each sample are different.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Change in the hash calculation algorithm\n\n**Change 2: Additions to backdoor commands**\n\nLODEINFO implements the following backdoor commands to control infected hosts:\n\nThe number of backdoor commands was reduced to 11 in v0.6.5, but v0.7.1 restored 6\ncommands and added the new runas command, bringing the total to 18.\n\nAdditionally, four commands (keylog, ps, pkill, autorun) that were removed in v0.7.2\nand v0.7.3 have been restored. Furthermore, the content of the config command, which\npreviously displayed \"Not Available,\" has also been implemented.\n\n\n**Command** **Descriptions** **v0.6.5** **v0.7.1**\n\n\n**v0.7.2,**\n**v0.7.3**\n\n\ncommand List the embedded backdoor\ncommands.\n\n\nEnable Enable Enable\n\n\nls Get a list of files.

LODEINFO attacker infrastructure.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn 2023, multiple versions of LODEINFO were also observed, and v0.7.3 was observed in\nJanuary 2024. It is important to continue to be careful, as there is a high possibility that\nvarious new features and detection evasion techniques will be incorporated in the future.\n\nAs a countermeasure, since both the Downloader Shellcode and the Backdoor Shellcode\nof LODEINFO are fileless malware, it is essential to introduce a product that can scan\nand detect malware in memory in order to detect it. Based on our research results to\n\n\n-----\n\ndate, we are not only introducing products that can scan in memory, but we are also\ntaking various measures that are specialized for LODEINFO. We will continue to expand\nour research and countermeasures in the future.\n\nWe hope to continue to exchange information on the threat of LODEINFO with the CERTs\nin organizations that are exposed to the cybersecurity threat and need the analysis.\n\nFinally, two presentations on LODEINFO are scheduled for JSAC2024.\n\nAlthough the application for participation has ended, some materials will be released later,\nso please use them to obtain the latest information.\n\n## IoCs\n\nMD5 of samples:\n69dd7fd355d79db0325816569ae2129a - Maldoc\nE82d98bae599cd172bb194adbdc76873 – zip file of above Maldoc\nD1a925ddb6d0defc94afb5996ed148bd - Maldoc\n9598b2af9dd1493dd213dbca56912af4 - Maldoc\n2a9012499d15145b5f63700c05adc426 - Loader module\n508aed3687c146c68ad16326568431ab - Loader module\n60dea5b5f889f37f5a9196e040bce0eb – BLOB:encrypted LODEINFO v0.6.9\n3d910e8ab29362ae36de73c6b70a7e09 – BLOB:encrypted LODEINFO v0.7.1\n290c5f33a4f4735e386b8193b1abdcf9 – Artifact:unique data structure for malware set\n\nC2s:\n167.179.106[.]224\n167.179.77[.]72\n172.104.112[.]218\n202.182.116[.]25\n45.76.197[.]236\n45.76.222[.]130\n45.77.183[.]161\n\n\n-----",
