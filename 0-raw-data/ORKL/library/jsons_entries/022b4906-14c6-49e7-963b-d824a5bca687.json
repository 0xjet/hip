This is because it takes on the façade of legitimate, non-malicious software, making it\nespecially stealthy and useful for targeted attacks. However, a closer investigation can reveal suspicious behavior that exposes their malicious\nintent.\n\nHow are open-source software trojanized? How can we detect them? To answer these questions, let us walk through a recent investigation we\nconducted that involved this file type.\n\n## The investigation\n\nIn our analysis of an incident, we found a file named notepad.exe sticking like a sore thumb. As most already know, Notepad is a well-known\nlegitimate application. However, some malware authors camouflage malicious files by using the name of legitimate software such as\nnotepad.exe to evade detection.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nTelemetry data showing the suspicious notepad.exe file\nThe notepad.exe file was dropped through ntoskrnl.exe, short for Windows NT operating system kernel executable. This was done by either\nexploiting ntoskrnl.exe or via network shares. Based on the telemetry data we obtained, it’s most probably the latter. Performing Root Cause\nAnalysis (RCA) shows that this malicious notepad.exe file has done suspicious actions by calling the following tools:\n\n**Executable File** **Function**\n\nipconfig.exe gets Windows IP Configuration\n\n\n-----\n\nnet.exe enumerates local and global groups in the domain\nlists the settings of server and workstation service\nidentifies all the shares on the local machine and in the domain\nnames user local and domain user accounts\n\nreg.exe dumps import registry keys/entries to a file\n\nsysteminfo.exe gathers operating system configuration information for a local or remote machine, including service pack levels\n\ntasklist.exe gets a list of currently running processes on either a local or remote machine\n\nTable 1. Executable file names and functions\n\nThe notepad.exe file’s link to these processes and their functions indicates that the file is a typical backdoor that gets commands from a\nmalicious remote user. However, something caught our attention. The details listed in the file properties of notepad.exe show this:\n\nFigure 2. Notepad.exe properties\n\nThe file description, product name, and original filename mention Notepad++, an open-source software used as a source code editor. It can\nalso be observed that some of the file’s details are dubious. For example, Notepad++ files are usually named as “notepad++.exe” and not\n[“notepad.exe” as seen in this sample. The version — v7.8.6 released in April — is also old; as of writing, the latest version is v7.9.1, released](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.8.6/)\nin early November.\n\nExecuting the file in question shows this:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Executed notepad.exe file\nThe user interface of the file looks and functions convincingly like a typical legitimate Notepad++ file. An initial look reveals nothing suspicious.\nBut in terms of behavior, we discovered that the sample does something that a non-malicious Notepad++ won’t do: it searches for a file named\nconfig.dat located in c:\\windows\\debug folder. This behavior is notable as the said file figures in the analysis of the sample’s code.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nSearching for config.dat file\n\n## Code analysis\n\nDecompiling the code of this malicious Notepad++ file shows the following code:\n\n\n-----\n\nsnippet of the malicious Notepad++ file\nThe code snippet taken from a typical non-malicious Notepad++ file is shown below:\n\n\nFigure 5. Code\n\nFigure 6. Code\n\n\nsnippet of a typical non-malicious Notepad++ file\nThese code snippets bear many similarities. However, the malicious Notepad++ file has additional code that loads an encrypted blob file\n(config.dat) that decrypts the code and executes it in the memory so it can perform its backdoor routines. This reminds us of some older\n[malware types like PLUGX.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/PLUGX)\n\nWe observed two instances using the same loader but delivering different payloads. One of the payloads is detected as\n[TrojanSpy.Win32.LAZAGNE.B, while the other is detected as Ransom.Win32.EXX.YAAK-B (Defray ransomware). Further investigation also](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/defray-ransomware-sets-sights-on-healthcare-and-other-industries)\nrevealed other blob files with the same loader which lead to different payloads.\n\nWe suspect that the file in this incident got into the organization through a targeted watering hole attack. After the initial machine was infected,\npropagating the malicious notepad++ and config.dat via admin shares would be easy. The notepad.exe file that we investigated came from\nmalicious sources and are not associated with official distributing sites of Notepad and Notepad++ exe\n\n\n-----\n\n## Weaponizing open source software\n\nDue to its uncanny resemblance to a legitimate Notepad++ file, the analyzed sample can be easily mistaken as a non-malicious file, especially\nby employees with limited technical know-how. Threat actors achieved this disguise by trojanizing open-source software. Notepad++’s source\n[code is available publicly; thus, anyone (including malware authors) can access it.](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus)\n\nThreat actors can look for open source code of widely-used software and trojanize it by adding malicious code that can perform functions like\nloading an encrypted blob file. This means that most of the resulting file’s binary code is outright non-malicious, and the malicious code simply\nloads a file, an activity that does not seem to be too suspicious. Additionally, encrypted blob files don’t have file headers. These make it difficult\nfor antimalware solutions, including AI/ML-based ones and those that only focus on a single protection layer, to detect. To block these types of\nthreats, solutions that grant visibility across layers would be helpful, as security teams can use them to correlate data and behavior within the\nenvironment.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nUsers should only download files, applications, and software (such as open-source software) from trusted and legitimate sources to avoid\n[these types of threats. For example, Notepad++ users can download relevant files from their official website. Enterprises can create and](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)\ndisseminate a list of approved downloading sites to their employees. As a further security measure, companies can also require the approval\nof IT teams before employees can install any software on office devices. For security and IT Teams, it is also strongly recommended to\nvalidate the downloaded binary with checksums, as good open source projects maintain checksums of their official released binaries.\n\n[We also recommend Trend Micro™ XDR, which collects and correlates data across endpoints, emails, cloud workloads, and networks,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response/xdr.html)\nproviding better context and enabling investigation in one place. This, in turn, allows teams to detect advanced and targeted threats earlier.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n**File name** **SHA-256** **Trend Micro**\n**Pattern Detection**\n\n\n**Trend Micro Ma**\n**Learning Detect**\n\n\nnotepad.exe\n(malicious,\nnonlegitimate\nfile named\nas such)\n\n\nbacc02fd23c4f95da0fbc5c490b1278d327fea0878734ea9a55f108ef9f4312e [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TR\n\n\nconfig.dat 64ba94000e2815898fb17e93deaa44ac0e1b4c55316af727b908dfe74c3b7ef6 Trojan.Win32.VATET.ENC N/A\n\nconfig.dat 33234dc94d926f1fc2831f40e27080739b415d485aa457d14a83617a3996089b Trojan.Win32.VATET.ENC N/A\n\nrelease.exe 09c99e37121722dd45a2c19ff248ecfe2b9f1e082381cc73446e0f4f82e0c468 TrojanSpy.Win32.LAZAGNE.B Troj.Win32.TRX.\n\nvirus2.dll 1c3331b87dc55a8cc491846f2609d6226f66eb372716df349567ed619dd1b731 Ransom.Win32.EXX.YAAK-B Troj.Win32.TRX.\n\nOther related hashes:\n\n\n**SHA-256** **Trend Micro Patten**\n**Detection**\n\n\n**Trend Micro Machine Learnin**\n**Detection**\n\n\n0b42bf15b77cfe9f9e693f2776691647e78a91be27f5bdb8d1a366be510a773f Trojan.Win32.VATET.A Troj.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF03\n\n10c4067908181cebb72202d92ff7a054b19ef3aada939bf76178e35be9506525 Trojan.Win32.VATET.A BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\n19938becb018e3459b49381c7efffabbe44a6450362b769ba85a3f1240b068d0 Trojan.Win32.VATET.A Troj.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF03\n\n2f149a79f721bb78eb956f70183b531fb6a1b233ceb4a3d6385759a0b0c16fd3 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) Troj.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF03\n\n37e8d3ae4c34441b30098d7711df8ef0bcc12c395f265106b825221744b956bc Trojan.Win32.VATET.A BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\n382d9bf5da142d44de5fda544de4fffe2915a3ffc67964b993f3c051aa8c2989 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\n\n-----\n\n42f5f1b08c9cee876bafdb6dc4188e8e29d26a07951e1083e08e2a4b0cb6d0ff [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n(GENERIC: Hit Bad Auto Shield\n\n4421720e0321ac8b3820f8178eb8a5ff684388438b62c85f93df9743a1d9fdb9 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\n4fb94877cc150f591e5b61dc5641f33e93e67ae1912c2e122e7ef2a236046f1a Trojan.Win32.VATET.A BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\n52d3ebe824ad60a939d64e73336e790884e3674b2d22dbe6e3c6b22061124161 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) n/a\n\n57eea67e3eebde707c3fb3473a858e7f895ae12aad37cc664f9c0512c0382e6a [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) Troj.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF03\n\n6ac07424e5c9b87d76645aa041772ac8af12e30dc670be8adf1cf9f48e32944b Backdoor.Win32.VATET.CFH BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\nbacc02fd23c4f95da0fbc5c490b1278d327fea0878734ea9a55f108ef9f4312e [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\nea6c3b993d830319b08871945cf2726dd6d8e62e8fed8fc42bcb053c38c78748 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\ne5ce1c1b69bd12640c604971be311f9544adb3797df15199bd754d3aefe0a955 Trojan.Win32.VATET.A BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\nef7e21d874a387f07a9f74f01f2779a280ff06dff3dae0d41906d21e02f9c975 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\nf0a25444cf58b61ff6cdd86ff1cfa53a51ad426817a33bd0e098f4f0ff286f22 [Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.Win32.VATET.SM) BKDR.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF\n\nCyber Threats\n\nHow are open-source software trojanized?
