Solarmarker is a .NET-based data exfiltration tool\nwith backdoor capability first discovered sometime around September 2020. At the time of\nour analysis, as shown in Figure 23, Solarmarker mostly targeted individuals and corporations\nbased in the United States and Canada. The PTI team has successfully de-anonymized\nthe C&C server and discovered that Solarmarker had already infected more than 12,000\nvictims and stolen over 200,000 credentials as of this report. Victim statistics by country and\nobservations from the C&C panel are provided in detail in the following sections.\n\n### 2 Executive Summary\n\nSolarmarker is a multi-stage, heavily obfuscated malware targeting thousands of victims\nglobally. Although security researchers identified Solarmarker as early as September 2020,\nthe threat actors responsible altered their approach to malware execution in September\n**2021. They changed several installation steps, such as the initial point of entry in MSI**\ninstallation files, making this advanced persistent threat even more dangerous.\n\nAfter a careful examination of malicious activity in a client’s infrastructure, the PTI Team\nstarted investigating Solarmarker and gained access to the attacker’s C&C infrastructure,\nthe center of the crime operation. Subsequent analysis of Solarmarker victims revealed that\nthe campaign captured 200,000 victim credentials from around 12,000 victim devices in the\nUnited States and Canada. 88.4% of these devices are located in the United States while\n**10% are located in Canada. Other countries constituted the remaining 1.6% of the total.**\n\nAnalysis of exfiltrated data shows that the majority of targets are high-profile individuals such\nas government officials and executives of private organizations. During the investigation,\nthe PTI team was able to collect multiple artifacts from the crime group spearheading\nthe Solarmarker campaign. The details of the investigation, including victim statistics and\nrelevant observations, are provided in this report.\n\nOur research makes it clear that the cybercrime group behind Solarmarker is persistent and\nhighly sophisticated. The underlying malware operated and evolved for an entire year without\nbeing detected, and would have led to headline-making data breaches and extortion\nattacks if our team, in cooperation with authorities, had not de-anonymized the group’s\ncommand and control infrastructure.\n\n4 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

It includes the corresponding admin panel\nand malware sample.\n\nSolarmarker is a .NET-based modular data exfiltration tool with an obfuscated backdoor\nthat targets Windows systems. The PTI team first found it as a portable executable file. Within\nthe first generation of samples, Solarmarker contained statically embedded Powershell\npayloads and DLLs. However, in September 2021, the threat actors respnsible switched\nto using MSI package installers [4]. This strategy proved to be advantageous for evading\nsecurity software of enabling more malicious functionality.\n\n#### 3.1 Distribution Mechanism\n\nSolarmarker threat actors generate numerous malicious phishing web pages with\ncommon business terms in English to target corporations and employees. These web pages\ntarget users performing job-related searches, leading them to legitimate-looking websites\nand prompting them to download document files that secretly contain Solarmarker malware.\nThis technique is commonly referred as SEO poisoning. Threat actors distribute thousands\nof keywords and links promote malicious web pages containing malware. When malicious\npages earn top-ranking SEO results, they can easily distribute to millions of victims at a time.\n\n**Figure 1. Fake PDF File**\n\nThe malicious links found in the documents use URL-redirection to direct users to the\nmalware dropper page. These pages serve the payload mostly in the form of a legitimate\nPDF viewer (Adobe Reader, Slim PDF, Sumatra PDF, or Nitro PDF).\n\n5 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2. Solarmarker dropper site hosted in sites.google.com**\n\n#### 3.2 Solarmarker Malware Execution\n\nThe first Solarmarker samples ran in five different stages enabled through portable\nexecutable files [2]. New iterations reduced the number of stages to four. [3]. This reduction\nsimplified the attack by skipping the malicious installation screen that victims would\notherwise encounter.\n\n**3.2.1** **Installation**\n\nThe MSI installer version of Solarmarker comes in two different versions. The first version\ncomes with a decoy PDF viewer application installer. After running the MSI file, the installer\nsuccessfully installs the legitimate application. During installation, a malicious Powershell\nscript is executed in the background and loads the Solarmarker DLL. (see Figure 3)\n\n**Figure 3. MSI file installation interface**\n\n6 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the second version, the installer displays an error (Figure 4) and executes a malicious\nPowershell script (Figure 6) that leaves a backdoor in the system and establishes a reverse\nconnection to the command and control server.\n\n**Figure 4. MSI Installer Error**\n\n**3.2.2** **Powershell Loader**\n\nThe dropped Powershell script (Figure 5) loads the backdoor and provides support for\nmalware persistence. The backdoor DLL file is stored in BASE64-encoded format inside\nthe Powershell script. First, the script decodes the BASE64-encoded DLL and saves it to a\npredefined path with a random name. Then, the script decodes the DLL with a simple XOR\ncipher and loads the decoded DLL via the calling System.Reflection.Assembly method.\n\nAt this stage, the script gains persistence by creating a shortcut file at the\n**“AppData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup” directory. This shortcut file**\nexecutes during system startup and invokes the backdoor DLL manually.\n\n**Figure 5.

Execution of Powershell Loader**\n\nThreat actors generate Powershell scripts using the C&C server. They keep the records of\nthese scripts and note which victim gets infected with the corresponding script.\n\n**3.2.3** **Backdoor DLL**\n\nThe DLL is obfuscated using the Dotfuscator [1] tool. Dotfuscator performs a combination\nof code obfuscation and shrinking, which hardens the reverse engineering process. Luckily,\nmost of the strings are still in plain text format because the cybercrime group failed to use\nthe Dotfuscator tool correctly.\n\n**Figure 7. Dotfuscator Indicator**\n\n8 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without providing\n\nan legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report nor an of\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution, the DLL generates a random 16-byte AES key to encrypt traffic between\nthe C&C and the victim’s machine. The DLL sends this key with a random generated victim\nidentification base64 string to the C&C server after encrypting it with a hardcoded RSA\npublic key (Figure 8) in the initial request. These hardcoded RSA keys are white-listed and\nmanageable from the C&C server.\n\n**Figure 8. Hardcoded RSA Key**\n\n**Figure 9. Generated Victim Key**\n\nThe malicious backdoor DLL sends the collected system information to the C&C server and\nwaits for incoming tasks. The system information packet contains the computer architecture,\nhardware identity, operating system name, computer name, workgroup name, and user\nrights values. (Figure 10).\n\n**Figure 10.

Jupyter loads and parses\nauto-fill data, saved passwords, and saved credit card information from the victim’s web\nbrowsers. After parsing the saved passwords, it filters them according to the rules defined\ninside the C&C panel (3.4.1). Generally, this process targets online cryptocurrency wallet\ndomains.\n\n**Figure 11.

They routed malware connections from victims to\nan intermediary server called ”Admin Panel” using multiple alternative load balancer\nservers. This server saves the victim-specific ID to the panel and manages initial\ncommand-and-control operations.\n\nThe second server, called ”MAT Panel”, classifies and stores all victim data, such as\ncryptocurrency credentials and wallets. The admin panel contains multiple users for checking\nincoming victim credentials. More detailed information about the control panel and the\nC&C structure is given in the next section. The following table contains all of the server IP\naddresses, hosting providers, and roles of the servers used in the Solarmarker malware\ncampaign as of this report.\n\n**IP** **Hosting Provider** **Role**\n185.244.213.64 M247 LTD Paris Load Balancer\n167.88.15.115 Nexeon Technologies, Inc (NT-63) Load Balancer\n216.230.232.134 The Optimal Link Corporation (THEOPT-2) Load Balancer\n45.42.201.248 SmartHost LLC Load Balancer\n37.120.237.251 M247 LTD Quebec Load Balancer\n188.241.83.61 M247 LTD Paris Load Balancer\n146.70.41.157 M247 LTD New York Load Balancer\n149.255.35.179 Hivelocity Inc Load Balancer\n45.155.204.139 Starcrecium Limited Admin Panel\n176.113.115.125 Red Bytes LLC MAT Panel\n\n11 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

(see Figure 12)\n\n**3.4.1** **MAT Panel**\n\nThe MAT panel is used for management and filtering of the victim data. This panel\ncontains the following list of pages,\n\n## • [Боты (Bots)]\n • [Избранное (Favourites)]\n • [BTC]\n • [Линки BTC (BTC Links)]\n • [Пользователи (Users)]\n • [Логирование (Logs)]\n\n**Figure 12.

The extracted data with these rules are used later on the\n”BTC” page. Note that the majority of these rules are used for storing cryptocurrency wallet\ndomains. Moreover, the threat actors were able to check generic victim data by clicking on\nthe ID of the victim. As of this report, there are 670 different rules configured inside the MAT\npanel.\n\n**Figure 13. Domain rules found on BTC Links page**\n\nThreat actors could reserve a bot and hide it from other MAT Panel users. The reserving\naction is logged in the panel, allowing an admin to track reserved bots by user, as seen in\nFigure 14. This reserving functionality could indicate an affiliate-based business model, even\nthough Solarmarker itself is most likely run by a single author.\n\n**Figure 14.

(see Figure 16)\n\n**Figure 16. Admin Panel Dashboard**\n\nIn addition, the threat actor gives tasks to Solarmarker victims such as invoking commands,\nexecuting applications, or running Powershell script on tasks page (see Figure 17).\n\n**Figure 17.

To hide the real IP\naddresses of C&C panels and other parts of Solarmarker’s infrastructure, the threat actor\nimplemented load balancer servers to handle incoming connections from victim systems.\nThe system keeps reputation scores for each of the load balancer servers, indicating which\nones have been detected by security products (see Figure 19).\n\n**Figure 19. The balancer page**\n\nThe ”Logs” page contains logs of every task created and removed. The admin can use this\npage to track other users’ task activity (see Figure 20).\n\n**Figure 20.

The data revealed deleted user records. Based on the PTI team’s\nobservations, the ID column of the users is incremental. Although the admin user ID is 1, the\nnext user named as conve’s ID continues with 7.\n\nOther columns, such as is_admin and disabled, show that the administrator of the\nadmin panel needed permissive control of the users. Considering the multiple permission\nlevels and victim-reserving functionality, the PTI team concludes that the Solarmarker\nmalware campaign is likely managed through a Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) affiliate\nmodel.\n\nThe following table contains the users and joining date for the admin panel :\n\n**Username** **Joined Date**\nadmin Sat, 31 Oct 2020 20:39:15 GMT\nconve Mon, 30 Aug 2021 16:57:51 GMT\nstrix Mon, 30 Aug 2021 16:58:10 GMT\nyami Mon, 30 Aug 2021 16:58:39 GMT\nfppi Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:09:52 GMT\nadmarch Wed, 06 Oct 2021 17:39:00 GMT\n\nAccording to the PTI team’s observations, the bishop user inside the MAT panel acts like a\nmoderator.

These victims include\nemployees of 96 Fortune 500 companies and government officials with email addresses\nregistered under the .mil and .gov top-level domains. The breakdown of high-profile victim\nstatistics is given in Section 4.2.\n\nBased on the panel interactions of active users, threat actor activities mainly occurred\non weekdays between 16:00 and 24:00 (GMT+0). According to the activity hours and\nhistoric records, we estimate that the affiliates are probably physically located in or near\nthe American east coast. Although the daily activity graph provides little more than\ncircumstantial evidence, further investigation should take activity timestamps into account.\nThe heat map of activities is provided in Figure 21.\n\n**Figure 21.

For example; on the 8th of\n**September 2021, although total victim count was 491, the exfiltration-activated victim count**\nwas 372. Based on the victim data, Solarmarker threat actors mostly targeted the United\nStates 88.4% and Canada 10%.\n\n**Figure 22. Daily victim infection statistics**\n\nAll the details regarding victim origin and infection dates are shown in Figures 22 and 23. It\nshould be noted that between 14th of September and 20th of September there is a little\nactivity on the server side. Activities also decrease significantly between 1st of October\nand 3rd of October. These might be caused by a fault on the server side or possibly due to\ndowntime.\n\n21 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.

Victims distribution by country**\n\n#### 4.2 High Profile Targets\n\nDuring our analysis of the stolen victim data, the PTI team identified multiple high-profile\nvictims based on their email addresses and saved browser credentials. These include\naddresses and accounts related to the military, government, and 97 Fortune 500 companies\ndiscovered and verified by the PTI team.\n\n**Figure 24.

SEO poisoning and heavy obfuscation methods make this malware one of\nthe fastest-spreading credential exfiltration tools in its class. Our investigation of its\ncommand-and-control servers revealed that malware operators infected a large number of\nvictims and were most likely aiming to monetize stolen credentials.\n\nBased on dark market dynamics, there is good reason to believe these credentials would be\nsold to the highest bidder. The techniques used by Solarmarker threat actors show that their\npriority is to evade detection as much as possible, staying under the radar for extended\nperiods of time while narrowing down their victim domain to specific regions.\n\nThe PTI team revealed all details and shared all findings with relevant authorities, so that\nthey would shut down Solarmarker operations. All victim information was shared with the\nrelevant CERT authorities prior to the release of this report.\n\nThis investigation demonstrates a few important things to the cybersecurity industry. It shows\nthe necessity of improving public and private partnerships to stop similar threats before they\ncause global impacts. It demonstrates the need for advanced threat intelligence, particularly\nthe ability to infiltrate cybercriminal C&C infrastructure, and it emphasizes the need for\nadvanced detection and response solutions that can identify downloaded executable files\nmasquerading as document files.\n\n23 / 27\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law.
