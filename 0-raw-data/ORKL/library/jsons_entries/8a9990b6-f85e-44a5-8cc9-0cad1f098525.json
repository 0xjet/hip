This malware provides threat](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-gang-takes-over-trickbot-malware-operation/)\nactors remote access to an internal device that can be used as a launchpad for further\nlateral movement within a network.\n\nThe BazarBackdoor malware is usually spread through phishing emails that include\nmalicious documents that download and install the malware.\n\nHowever, as secure email gateways have become better at detecting these malware\ndroppers, distributors are moving to new ways of spreading the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Contact forms replacing emails\n\n[In a new report by Abnormal Security, analysts explain that a new distribution campaign](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/bazarloader-contact-form)\nstarted in December 2021 targets corporate victims with BazarBackdoor, with the likely goal\nof deploying Cobalt Strike or ransomware payloads.\n\nInstead of sending phishing emails to the targets, the threat actors first use corporate\ncontact forms to initiate communication.\n\nFor example, in one of the cases seen by Abnormal's analysts, the threat actors posed as\nemployees at a Canadian construction company who submitted a request for a product\nsupply quote.\n\nAfter the employee responds to the phishing email, the attackers send back a malicious ISO\nfile supposedly relevant to the negotiation.\n\nSince sending these files directly is impossible or would trigger security alerts, the threat\nactors use file-sharing services like TransferNow and WeTransfer, as shown below.\n\n**Phishing message pointing to a malicious file download** _(Abnormal Security)_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe reported a similar case of contact form abuse in August, where fake DMCA infringement\nnotices sent via contact forms were installing BazarBackdoor.\n\nIn April 2021, [we also reported on a phishing campaign using contact forms to spread the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/attackers-deliver-legal-threats-icedid-malware-via-contact-forms/)\nIcedID banking trojan and Cobalt Strike beacons.\n\n## Hiding BazarLoader\n\nThe ISO archive attachment contains a .lnk file and a .log file. The idea here is to evade AV\ndetection by packing the payloads in the archive and having the user manually extract them\nafter download.\n\nThe .lnk file contains a command instruction that opens a terminal window using existing\nWindows binaries and loads the .log file, which is, in reality, a BazarBackdoor DLL.\n\n**BazarLoader executable**\n\n**posing as a .log file** _(Abnormal Security)_\nWhen the backdoor is loaded, it will be injected into the svchost.exe process and contact\nthe command and control (C2) server to receive commands to execute.\n\nDue to many of the C2 IPs being offline at the time of Abnormal's analysis, the researchers\ncouldn't retrieve the second-stage payload, so the ultimate goal of this campaign remains\nunknown.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 13th 2022 - A National Emergency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-13th-2022-a-national-emergency/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[BazarBackdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bazarbackdoor/)\n[BazarLoader](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bazarloader/)\n[Cobalt Strike](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cobalt-strike/)\n[Contact Form](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/contact-form/)\n[Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/conti/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
