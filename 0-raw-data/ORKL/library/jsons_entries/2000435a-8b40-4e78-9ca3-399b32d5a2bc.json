The NCCIC serves as a\nnational hub for cyber and communications information sharing, in near-real-time whenever possible,\nand provides assistance to respond to incidents on stakeholder assets. These activities fall under the\n“Information Sharing” and “Incident Response” lines of effort outlined in the Office of Cybersecurity\nand Communications (CS&C) Implementation Strategy for FY16-18. Within the NCCIC, the Industri­\nal Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) leads DHS efforts to enhance the\ncybersecurity and resilience of the industrial control systems (ICSs) upon which much of the Nation’s\nCI relies. In partnership with the ICS community, ICS-CERT provides unique analytical, technical,\nand information products to help CI owners and operators proactively enhance their control systems\ncybersecurity posture and incident response capabilities to limit the severity of incidents.\n\nThis report provides a year-end summary of the NCCIC/ICS-CERT security assessment activities.\nSecurity assessments are essential to helping CI owners and operators proactively understand their\nvulnerability to cyber threats and measure their ICS security posture against accepted industry stan­\ndards. This work directly supports the “Leading Practices and Risk Management” line of effort reflect­\ned in the CS&C Implementation Strategy for FY16-18 which includes performing risk assessments\nwith CI organizations to help organizations improve their own security, establish a relationship with\ncompanies, and provide DHS with a better understanding of sector-specific and national risk.\n\nThe report provides our partners with common cybersecurity findings and identifies weaknesses\nfrom assessments conducted in FY 2015. In addition, this report outlines risk mitigation actions that\nICS users should consider when addressing control systems cybersecurity in their organizations.\n\nICS-CERT will continue to share analytical reports to assist CI owners and operators with manag­\ning control systems risk. We hope our partners find the information contained in this report useful.\n\nThank you.\n\n\nJohn Felker, Director of Operations\nNCCIC\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\n\nMarty Edwards, Director\nICS-CERT\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 1.  INTRODUCTION\n\nThe FY 2015 NCCIC/ICS-CERT Industrial Control Systems Assessment Summary Report\nidentifies common control systems cyber-weaknesses, provides risk mitigation recommendations,\nand provides a broader strategic analysis of the evolving ICS cybersecurity landscape. Reporting\nperiods for assessment data spans the Federal fiscal year (October-September).\n\nAs the cyber-threat landscape continues to **The ICS-CERT Mission**\nevolve, control systems and their underlying\narchitecture must be secured to withstand cyber ICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk\nattacks. It is important that organizations conduct **_to the Nation’s critical infrastructure_**\nboth risk and vulnerability assessments for the **_by strengthening the security and_**\nsystems that drive the critical automation and **_resilience of control systems through_**\nprocesses that support our Nation’s CI. From the **_public-private partnerships._**\nlaunch of the ICS-CERT assessment program in\nFY 2009 through the end of FY 2015, ICS-CERT conducted roughly 535 assessments for govern­\nment and private sector CI owners and operators. Cybersecurity assessments help CI partners to\nunderstand their ICS security strengths and weaknesses and help guide decisions to enhance their\ncybersecurity posture.\n\nIn FY 2014, ICS-CERT issued the first ICS Assessment summary report. Many of the critical\nweaknesses identified in FY 2014 remained prominent in FY 2015. ICS-CERT draws the vulnerabil­\nity-specific data contained in the summary report from its Design Architecture Review (DAR) and\nNetwork Architecture Validation and Verification (NAVV) assessments. These are deep dive ICS\nassessments conducted in close partnership with CI facility owners and operators. ICS-CERT also\nmaintains the Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET[®]), available as both a facilitated assessment and a\ndownloadable self-assessment product. ICS-CERT does not retain data from CSET assessments.\n\nThe discoveries and mitigation recommendations described in the summary report are not all-in­\nclusive or prescriptive. Summary report information should be reviewed and applied to an organiza­\ntion’s overall cybersecurity framework and program as appropriate to that organization. Addressing\nthe best practices and recommendations in this report can improve a CI asset owner’s overall security\nposture and heighten awareness of potential threats or cyber attacks targeting their operations.\n\n\n**2015 Assessment Snapshot**\n\n    - ICS-CERT conducted 112 assessments in FY 2015, including 38 facilitated CSET[®], 46\n\nDAR, and 28 NAVV assessments.\n\n    - There were 638 weaknesses identified through DAR and NAVV assessments.\n\n    - The top six categories represented 36 percent of all weaknesses.\n\n    - Boundary protection was the most commonly identified area of weakness in both FY\n\n2014 and FY 2015.\n\n    - Weaknesses related to boundary protection and least functionality represented 21 per­\n\ncent of all discovered weaknesses.\n\n    - Key trends included pervasive issues related to virtual machines, remote access, virtu­\n\nal local area network (VLAN) use, bring your own device (BYOD) risks, use of cloud\nservices, and ICS network monitoring.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2. SUMMARY FINDINGS\n\n 2.1  Assessment Activity\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, ICS-CERT conducted 112 assessments in FY 2015. Demand for ICSCERT assessment products continues to increase, particularly for in-depth assessment products:\nthe DAR and NAVV assessments. This increase in demand is in part due to growing awareness of\nICS-CERT’s assessment capabilities and in part due to increased awareness among CI partners of\nthe importance of understanding and improving their ICS cybersecurity posture.\n\nFigure 1.

ICS-CERT Onsite Assessments Geographical Distribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.2  FY 2015 Top Vulnerabilities\n\nICS-CERT assessments uncovered 638 weaknesses in FY 2015. The top six areas of weak­\nness accounted for approximately 36 percent of all weaknesses identified in FY 2015 assess­\nments, as shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2. Top Six Weaknesses Discovered in FY 2015.\n\n##### Area of Weakness Consequence/Risk\n\nBoundary Protection - Cannot detect unauthorized activity in critical systems.\n\n                  - Increased risk to critical assets with weak boundaries between ICS\n\nand Enterprise networks.\n\nLeast Functionality - Creates vectors for malicious party access to critical systems.\n\n                  - Rogue internal access could be established.\n\nAuthenticator Management - Unsecured password communications can easily be compromised.\n\n                  - Password compromise could allow trusted unauthorized access to\n\nsystems.\n\nIdentification and  - Results in lack of accountability and traceability for user actions if\nAuthentication an account is compromised.\n\n                   - Increases difficulty in securing accounts as personnel leave the or­\n\nganization, especially sensitive for users with administrator access.\n\nLeast Privilege  - The more authorized users with elevated privileges, the larger the\n\nattack surface for an intruder to steal account credentials with\nelevated access rights to access and compromise critical systems.\n\nAllocation of Resources - Understaffing impedes organizational cybersecurity monitoring and\n\nresponse capability to a critical system cyber incident increasing\nthe potential impact to the company.\n\nThe most common ICS cyber weakness in both FY 2014 and FY 2015 was insufficient net­\nwork boundary protection. Monitoring and control of communications at the ICS network bound­\naries is a key tenet of the cybersecurity defense-in-depth concept. Boundary protection effec­\ntively slows attack processes and facilitates detection, analysis, and notification of unauthorized\nactivity to support operational and incident response. Absent strong protection, attackers can\nmore easily penetrate the network boundary around critical assets, access valuable information,\nand manipulate systems controlled by ICS. Vul­\n\n**Boundary Protection**\n\nnerabilities related to least functionality were the\nsecond most commonly identified concern. Spe­\n\n                           - In both FY 2014 and FY 2015,\n\ncific issues include insufficient use of whitelisting;\n\nBoundary Protection was the single\n\nemploying insecure, outdated, or otherwise vulner­\n\nmost common ICS weakness dis­\n\nable operating system services; and leaving com­\n\ncovered during assessments.\n\nmunications ports accessible when not required for\n\n                             - Effective Boundary Protection is a\n\nsystem operations.

Boundary\nprotection continued to present the most common weakness discovered across both years, repre­\nsenting roughly 13 percent of all discovered weaknesses in FY 2015 and 11 percent in FY 2014.\nBoundary protection was identified as a weakness in 63 percent of the DAR assessments per­\nformed in 2015.\n\n|Table 3.

DETAILED ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n\nIn FY 2015, ICS-CERT provided mitigation recommendations for 638 weaknesses identified\nthrough 74 DAR and NAVV assessments. ICS-CERT’s assessment methodology categorizes\nweaknesses based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) NIST 800-53\ncontrol family subcategories (See Appendix A for Control Family descriptions). The Top 20 cate­\ngories of weaknesses make up 69.4 percent of the total weaknesses identified. Table 4 shows the\nTop 20 weakness categories discovered in 2015. Appendix B provides brief descriptions of each\ncategory.\n\nTable 4.

The top six categories were: Boundary Protection, Least Functionality,\nAuthenticator Management, Identification and Authentication, Least Privilege, and Allocation of\nResources. Table 5 summarizes the six most common vulnerabilities by security control family,\nsubcategory, potential risk, and recommended mitigations.\n\n|Table 4.

Weak boundary protection provides various vectors for unauthorized interfacing with devices and systems, which directly support the control process.|||\n|• The scope of threats and general risk to control systems operations increases sig­ nificantly without logical separation of the ICS network from enterprise networks (or from untrusted systems, i.e., the Internet).|||\n|Recommended Mitigation|||\n|• Separate the enterprise network from the ICS network and establish a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two systems for ICS perimeter protection. Refer to NIST 800-SP 82 Chapter 5 for information on designing perimeter protections for an ICS.|||\n|• The DMZ should house a dedicated “jump” server that would permit systems on the enterprise network (or those accessing via a remote method, e.g., a virtual pri­ vate network [VPN]) to access data elements derived from the ICS network.|||\n|• The jump server should be hardened, running only essential services. Credentials for this server should not be the same as those that are used for authentication to systems on the enterprise network.|||\n|• Ingress/Egress communication flows to this server should be restricted to the min­ imal subset of those that are required to support secure methods for accessing ICS systems (when needed to access from outside the standard ICS network).|||\n|• Logging and monitoring of information derived from this system should be incor­ porated with continued verification.|||\n|• Security devices and systems need to be resident in the DMZ to support ICS system network equipment patching and updates (antivirus update server, Windows Server Update Services [WSUS] patch update, etc.).|||\n\n\n#### 1.

If a password is compromised, the sys­ tem assumes the user is an authorized party.|||\n|• Passwords can be easily compromised using techniques such as brute force (pass­ word guessing) or pass the hash techniques.|||\n|• If encryption is not enabled on authentication, meaning password data are trans­ ferred as clear text, attackers can simply listen to the traffic and pull the user name and passwords off the wire while in transit. Once compromised, persistent access is granted for the lifetime of the user accounts and passwords (i.e., account passwords that never expire or inactive/legacy accounts that are not disabled when not in use).|||\n\n\n#### 2.

OVERARCHING STRATEGIC OBSERVATIONS FROM FY 2015\n\nMeeting with industry and government organizations provides the opportunity to not only\nshare what ICS-CERT found at specific facilities, but also to see shifts in technology use in\ncontrol systems operational and security environments. In FY 2015, ICS-CERT saw significant\nchanges in the application of various technologies and corresponding challenges in implement­\ning them securely. These include challenges related to use of virtual machines, remote access,\nVLANs, BYOD policies, cloud services, and network monitoring.\n\n#### 4.1  Inadequate Access Security Controls for Virtual Machines\n\nIncreasingly, CI asset owners are implementing and leveraging virtual machine (VM) tech­\nnologies as a method of reducing capital equipment, managing device recovery, and running\nmultiple disparate guest operating systems on a single physical host machine. ICS-CERT contin­\nues to see inadequate user access security controls to the hypervisor (VM monitor) host manage­\nment interface with many of these implementations. This provides a single point of failure and\nentry that adversaries could use to control every guest VM on the host computer. These interfaces\nshould be placed within management networks with strict and logged zone access control. This\nensures that network, host, and VMs are provided with adequate security controls. When CI own­\ners and operators configure the physical host to contain both DMZ and ICS servers, the networks\nand network interface controls (NIC) should be hardened, and all others deleted to prevent the\npossibility of opening up a bridged scenario. It is also imperative that operational technology\n(OT) and information technology (IT) departments coordinate regular patching of the hypervisors\nto minimize impact to ICS processors.\n\n#### 4.2  Insecure Implementation of Remote Access\n\nUse of remote access — while not a new concept — raises a number of issues that manag­\ners should consider prior to documenting a policy and implementing a process. Whether access\nis from the corporate network to the ICS or from the Internet to the ICS, this access provides a\nserious risk to the system. Attackers can gain access to user accounts at the users’ home or cor­\nporate office and obtain the user credentials and connection to access critical ICS assets or allow\nan infected computer an access channel into the networks via a VPN connection. The organiza­\ntion must therefore decide what, if any, access it will require from these remote locations, who\nneeds that access, and how to harden the access process to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.\nThe use of multi-factor authentication and limiting VPN access to hardened and monitored jump\nservers can reduce these risks.\n\n#### 4.3  Improper Use of VLAN\n\nVLAN technology has been around for a long time; in fact, implementing VLANs as security\nmechanisms is a standard practice in many configurations. While VLANs can logically segment\nnetworks, if users do not follow best practices of the hardware vendors, network activity can tra­\nverse to other VLAN segments. Default and native VLANs that remain unchanged on trunk ports\nprovide an avenue where jumping from one VLAN to another is possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 4.4  Risk of Bring-Your-Own-Device Policies to ICS\n\nOperations, maintenance, and engineering personnel are increasingly implementing portable\ncomputing devices—such as tablets, smart phones, and laptops—in ICS environments. A number\nof organizations are actively promoting their use because of their popularity and convenience\nof mobility while maintaining access. However, such devices are not typically managed by the\norganization and security policies implemented by the organization are often not also implement­\ned on the portable devices. Use of BYODs to access personal email, web pages, and social media\napplications, are inherently high risk to ICS. This risk must be considered by the organization and\nappropriate measures, such as mobile device management systems, should be put into place to\nmitigate the risk to acceptable levels.\n\n#### 4.5  Cloud Services: Harden External Hosting Security for Critical Functions\n\nICS-CERT is seeing some organizations utilizing cloud services for data storage and con­\nsidering methods of utilizing them for additional services to support their ICS architectures.\nOrganizations must ensure that the parts of any ICS architecture hosted externally have a level\nof security consistent with the criticality of the functions of the ICS operation. Organizations\nmust also consider ICS operational information integrity, security, and confidentiality, as well as\nfunctional and operational details associated with recovery, event/incident management, failover,\nforensic support, monitoring, and other operational sequences that require special support by the\ncloud-hosting service provider. Legal instruments, such as service level agreements, are import­\nant because all operational support should be explicitly identified. This ensures that support by\ncloud service providers — and Internet service provider (ISP) availability and bandwidth capac­\nity — are sufficient to manage any operational issues that may surface. Issues that are sometime\noverlooked when shifting resources to the cloud include reliance on ISP connections on premise\nand the corresponding potential of bandwidth increases. The effects of load balancing and effects\nassociated with an upsurge in data usage by other ISP customers should also be considered.\n\n#### 4.6  ICS Network Monitoring as a Core Defense-in-Depth Strategy\n\nThe concept of Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is premised on early detection and alerts of an intru­\nsion to ensure defensive action can be taken before the breach of critical assets. Network moni­\ntoring is an absolute requirement for any critical system. Having an electronic boundary around\nthe ICS is not sufficient to protect critical assets from unauthorized access. For each protection\nin a network environment, attackers can find a method to overcome that protection. Most CI\norganizations have some level of monitoring at the corporate level, but this is rarely implemented\nwithin the ICS networks. Network monitoring can be done and collected in many ways, such as\nusing free centralized syslog servers for Linux and network devices to centrally collect Windows\nEvents using winrm and wevtutil utilities, but these events (logs) must also be reviewed. Solu­\ntions such as security information and event management (SIEM) products exist that can collect,\nlog, and correlate information from multiple sources and alert on anomalous or specified activity\nand provide real-time analysis. Technologies for monitoring include log collection and manage­\nment to windows hosts with free utilities such as the Microsoft wevtutil utility and local logs on\nfirewalls. Canaries and honeypots/honeynets are other concepts that flag any unauthorized intru­\nsion to sophisticated SIEM products and services, combining security information management\nand security event management.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5.  ABOUT ICS-CERT’S ASSESSMENT OFFERINGS\n\nICS-CERT offers cybersecurity assessments of ICS to government and private sector CI\norganizations across all 16 CI sectors. In FY 2015, ICS-CERT conducted assessments (includ­\ning CSET, DAR, and NAVV assessments) in the Chemical, Defense Industrial Base, Emergency\nServices, Energy, Government Facilities, Information Technology, Transportation, and Water\nSectors. Figure 2 provides a percentage breakout of all FY 2015 assessments by CI sector.\n\nEmergency Services (9 percent)\n\nDefense Industrial Base (3 percent)\nChemical (2 percent)\n\nWater (35 percent)\n\nEnergy (29 percent)\n\nTransportation (8 percent)\n\nInformation Technology (3 percent)\n\nGovernment Facilities (11 percent)\n\nFigure 2.

ICS-CERT works\nwith the system owners and operators to perform a deep-dive manual assessment and analysis\nof the operational process. The assessment focus is of the underlying ICS network architecture,\nintegration of IT and OT teams, vendor support, monitoring, cybersecurity controls, and a review\nof internal and external connections utilized within the control systems environment. The DAR\nfocuses heavily on ICS network architecture, asset inventory, and protective and detective securi­\nty controls.\n\nA DAR provides the asset owner **2015 CI Cyber Risk Mitigation Status**\nwith a thorough evaluation of system\n\n                     - ICS-CERT conducts follow-up meetings with\n\ninterdependencies, vulnerabilities, and\n\neach asset owner to review the impact of the\n\nmitigation options.

ICS-CERT visualizes and performs analysis on the network traffic and de­\nvice-to-device communications occurring within various ICS network segments to identify po­\ntential unauthorized or suspect communications. Threat data analysis of the traffic evaluates for\nindicators of known unauthorized attacks in the user’s network. NAVV assessments enable asset\nowners to:\n\n   - Verify the accuracy of ICS network diagrams.\n\n   - Identify potentially rogue/misconfigured devices or malicious data communications.\n\n   - Analyze data flows to ensure boundary protection devices work as designed.\n\n   - Identify opportunities or areas to improve zoning and perimeter protections.\n\n   - Baseline the ICS network (including a protocol hierarchy and organization of network\n\ntraffic).\n\n   - Gain practical knowledge of how to passively monitor and verify the communications\n\noccurring within their ICS networks.\n\nThe NAVV provides organizations with a view of network communication occurring within\nthe ICS network infrastructure, in addition to those communications sourced from or destined to\nICS network segments. ICS-CERT typically provides NAVV reviews as an extension to DARs,\nalthough this service is also offered independently.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 6.  CONCLUSION\n\nThe protection of the Nation’s CI is essential for ensuring public confidence and safeguarding\nthe Nation’s safety, prosperity, and well-being. Much of our CI depends on automated control\nsystems to manage industrial processes efficiently and securely, so it is essential that organiza­\ntions conduct security assessments, so that they can understand how best to secure this architec­\nture against cyber threats.\n\nICS-CERT will continue to improve its cybersecurity assessment services to meet the evolv­\ning needs of its CI customer base. ICS-CERT’s assessment capabilities are a key part of a holistic\ncyber risk management program that helps CI stakeholders to better prepare for, protect against,\nmitigate, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents affecting ICS.\n\nOver the coming years ICS-CERT will launch a number of new initiatives to expand access to\nassessment products and services, while continuously improving the quality of service offerings\nand the utility of mitigation recommendations. Future initiatives include, for example, launching\ntrain-the-trainer programs to enable DHS regional personnel to conduct CSET assessments for\nlocal customers. In addition, ICS-CERT will be instrumental in supporting assessments focused\non federal facility building and access control systems. Understanding cyber risk is the first step\nin mitigating it. ICS-CERT remains committed to helping its partners gain a clearer comprehen­\nsion of the threats and vulnerabilities they face and the actions they can take to secure their ICS.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A\n\n NIST 800-53 Security Control Family Descriptions\n\nICS-CERT uses NIST’s “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems”\n(NIST 800-53) to categorize the discoveries found during assessments. Using NIST 800-53 pro­\nvides a consistent and repeatable methodology for collecting and correlating data.\n\nThe NIST 800-53 controls are organized into 18 families; each family contains subcategories\nrelated to the general security topic of the family. Subcategories include, for example, policy,\noversight, supervision, manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms im­\nplemented by system technologies. Descriptions of the 18 security control families follow:\n\n**Access Control (AC). The security controls governing the mechanisms, principles, processes, and other**\ncontrols used to facilitate access to the information system.\n\n**Awareness and Training (AT).** The security controls facilitating general and role-based security\ntraining of users in regard to the information system and the corresponding records of training.\n\n**Audit and Accountability (AU).** The security controls used to define, record, analyze, and report\non the actions of the information system.\n\n**Security Assessment and Authorization (CA). Security controls that define and establish how the**\ninformation system will authorize for use, how the information system is checked to ensure that security\ncontrols are in place and deficiencies are tracked and corrected, and how the system is connected to\nexternal systems as well as its internal connections.\n\n**Configuration Management (CM).** Security controls to manage the installation and configura­\ntion of the information system as a whole and per device. These controls establish documenta­\ntion, planning, configuration, testing, and analysis of the hardware and software changes made to\nthe information system.\n\n**Contingency Planning (CP).** Security controls to define and aid in the recovery/restoration pro­\ncesses of an information system.\n\n**Identification and Authentication (IA).** The controls to verify the identity of a user, process, or\ndevice through the use of specific credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, biometrics) as a prerequi­\nsite for granting access to resources in an IT system.\n\n**Incident Response (IR).** Security controls pertaining to incident response training, testing, han­\ndling, monitoring, reporting, and support services.\n\n**Maintenance (MA).** Security controls governing the maintenance processes and tools.\n\n**Media Protection (MP).** Security controls ensuring access to, marking, storage, and sanitization\nof media both electronic and physical.\n\n**Physical and Environmental Protection (PE). Security controls addressing the physical security**\nand needs of an information system including environmental controls for conditioning (e.g., temperature,\nhumidity) and emergency provisions (e.g., shutdown, power, lighting, and fire protection).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Planning (PL).** Security Controls comprising the security plan, security architecture, rules of\nbehavior, and operations of the information system.\n\n**Personnel Security (PS).** Security controls dealing with the security implications of information\nsystem personnel.\n\n**Risk Assessment (RA).** Security controls to determine the risk of the information system. The\ncontrol family includes the assessment of risk and scanning the system for vulnerabilities.\n\n**System and Services Acquisition (SA).** Security controls that pertain to the establishment and\noperations of the information system, including its resources, development, and life cycle.\n\n**System and Communications Protection (SC).** Security controls to protect the information\nsystem and its data as they are dispersed through the various channels of communication.\n\n**System and Information Integrity (SI).** Security controls to ensure information system data are\nvalid and authentic. Control family includes controls to address flaws in the system, malicious\ncode, and error handling.\n\n**Program Management (PM).** Provides enterprise-level security controls reaching across an\nentire organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n### pp\n\n FY 2015 Top 20 Subcategory Discoveries\n\nTable B1 provides a summary overview of the top 20 discoveries and their percentage in the\noverall subcategory metric set of weaknesses identified in FY 2015 assessments.\n\nTable B1.
