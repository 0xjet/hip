The analysis revealed several\ncommonalities across the iconography, videography, and leak sites used by the groups,\nsuggesting they are likely operated by the same entity. CTU™ analysis indicates that\nAbraham's Ax is another hacktivist group persona operated by the Iranian COBALT\nSAPLING threat group.\n\nAbraham's Ax announced their existence and mission through social media channels such\nas Twitter posts on November 8, 2022. The group's iconography is reminiscent of Moses\nStaff (see Figure 1). The Moses Staff logo shows an arm extended from a sleeve holding a\nstaff with a clenched fist. Abraham's Ax shows a clenched fist holding an axe from a different\nperspective. Both illustrations use a similar style.\n\n_Figure 1. Comparison of Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax logos. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAbraham's Ax and Moses Staff use a WordPress blog as the basis for their leak sites.\nAlthough the overall aesthetics are different, there are clear connections in their operations.\nBoth sites offer multiple languages. Moses Staff is available in Hebrew and English, while\nAbraham's Ax is available in Hebrew, Farsi, and English. Both sites provide versions\n\n\n-----\n\navailable via Tor websites, although the Abraham s Ax site appeared to be under\nconstruction at the time of analysis. Both use domains registered with EgenSajt . se (see\nTable 1).\n\n**Domain** **Creation Date**\n\nMoses-staff . se 2021-09-09\n\nabrahams-ax . nu 2022-10-14\n\nabrahams-ax . se 2022-11-08\n\n_Table 1. Domains registered by Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax._\n\nAlthough the threat actors registered .nu and .se domains that use the abrahams-ax name,\nthe group appears to use the .nu version in promotional material (see Figure 2). The\nabrahams-ax . nu domain was registered approximately three weeks before the group\nemerged publicly.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Screenshot from video segment produced by Abraham's Ax. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nCTU analysis of the hosting infrastructure for the Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax leak sites\nrevealed that at early points in their lifecycles, both sites were hosted in the same subnet,\nnearly adjacent to each other (see Figure 3). This is highly unlikely to occur by coincidence\nand strongly indicates that the same entity chose to host the two sites in near contiguous IP\naddress space.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Infrastructure links between Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nMoses Staff claims to be anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian and encourages leak site visitors to\ntake part in \"exposing the crimes of the Zionists in occupied Palestine.\" Moses Staff posted\n16 \"activities\" to their site as of December 2. The leaked information is predominantly data\nsets stolen from Israeli companies but also includes compilations of personal information on\n[individuals affiliated with Israel's signals intelligence Unit 8200. Some of the intrusions have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200)\nbeen confirmed, although it is likely that Moses Staff embellished the nature and extent of\n[the compromises. The threat actors have reportedly used the custom PyDCrypt loader and](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/mosesstaff-targeting-israeli-companies/)\nDCSrv cryptographic wiper. DCSrv encrypts data using the open-source DiskCryptor library\nand installs a custom bootloader message. Although the wiper is styled as ransomware, the\nthreat actors do not make a serious attempt to extort a ransom payment. The attacks appear\n[to be politically motivated and focused on disruption and intimidation. The StrifeWater remote](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/strifewater-rat-iranian-apt-moses-staff-adds-new-trojan-to-ransomware-operations)\naccess trojan (RAT) (also known as brokerhost.exe) has also been linked to the group based\non technical overlaps between intrusions, such as the use of the same customized ASPX\n[web shells. An auxiliary tool named DriveGuard has been deployed alongside StrifeWater to](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/guard-your-drive-from-driveguard)\nmonitor its execution. Malware artifacts indicate that COBALT SAPLING has been operating\nsince at least November 2020 (see Figure 4), even though the Moses Staff persona did not\nemerge until September 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Early StrifeWater RAT sample information indicating operations since at least_\n_November 2020. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nLike Moses Staff, Abraham's Ax uses a biblical figure as the basis of their persona and\nincludes religious quotes throughout their site. However, Abraham's Ax states they are\noperating on behalf of the Hezbollah Ummah. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Islamist political\nparty and militant group that is backed by Iran. Ummah refers to a Muslim community. As of\nthis publication, there is no evidence to suggest that Abraham's Ax is linked to Hezbollah.\nRather than attacking Israel directly, Abraham's Ax attacks government ministries in Saudi\nArabia. They published sample data allegedly stolen from attacks on the Ministry of the\nInterior, along with a video that purportedly presents intercepted phone conversations\nbetween Saudi Arabian government ministers. The group may be attacking Saudi Arabia in\nresponse to Saudi Arabia's leadership role in improving relationships between Israel and\n[Arab nations. In June 2022, media reports described secret talks regarding potential air](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/27/israel-and-saudi-arabia-in-talks-over-joint-defence-against-iran)\ndefense collaborations, which Iran perceived as a significant threat to its interests in the\nregion. Progress on normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel is fragile, and\nIran may see these attacks as a way to discourage those efforts.\n\nMoses Staff and Abraham's Ax have both produced and released videos as part of their\noperations. The videos often depict Hollywood-style hacking involving satellites, CCTV, 3D\nbuilding models, and fast scrolling through documents allegedly stolen as part of their\noperations. Some videos depict multiple mobile phones combined with audio playback to\nsuggest that mobile phone calls of senior government officials were intercepted. The video\nfiles released by the two groups show clear repetition and evolution of visual themes. The\ncomparison of video screen captures in Figure 5 shows strong similarities between the\ngroups. The Abraham's Ax videos use several of the same stock video elements used by\nMoses Staff but include additional visual embellishments. One odd addition to the\nbackground of Abraham's Ax videos is scrolling text taken from a 2015 news report on\nformer British Prime Minister David Cameron visiting a factory in the UK. This selection\nappears incongruent with the visual theme and message of the overall campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Similar screenshots from Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax videos. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nThe Abraham's Ax persona does not appear to be a direct replacement for Moses Staff. The\nMoses Staff leak site and Telegram channels remained active following Abraham Ax's\nemergence. In late November, Moses Staff claimed to have compromised a CCTV system\nthat monitored the site of a terrorist attack in Israel, releasing previously unseen footage of\nthe explosion. Malware and technical indicators from Abraham's Ax operations have not\nbeen identified. Assuming that both personas are operated by COBALT SAPLING, it is\nplausible that the threat actors use the same tools and techniques in their intrusions.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 2.
