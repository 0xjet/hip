He contributed to this report independently from any affiliation._\n\n## Introduction\n\nBeginning in December 2016, unconnected Middle Eastern human rights activists began to receive spearphishing messages in English and\nPersian that were not related to any previously-known groups. These attempts differed from other tactics seen by us elsewhere, such as those\nconnected to Iran, with better attention paid to the operation of the campaign. Curiously, the two initial targets have little in common with each\nother aside from human rights activism – although not having worked on overlapping issues or countries. This dissimilarity only grew with the\nfurther enumeration of other targets, describing a broad targeting across the Middle East without wholly implicating any particular interest,\ndespite clear political intent.\n\nAfter extensive work to unpack other potential attacks, we begin to describe an actor that has demonstrated higher than average care to avoid\ndiscovery, and shown an ability to learn quickly from past mistakes. Efforts to track the operator describe a group that is broadly interested in a\ndiverse set of Middle Eastern interests, from Iranian women’s rights activists to Turkish government officials, and from Saudi Aramco to a\nEurope-based human rights organization focused on the region. A significant number of the targets of the group are connected to Qatar’s\ndomestic and international politics, drawing recurring parallels to previous campaigns and suggesting a partial connection to the country. Few\nstate interests would convincingly account why someone would engage in espionage against Egyptian lawyers at the same time as Iranian\nreformists, leaving open the possibility that the operator is a non-state actor with diverse motivations. Still, the operation’s ambitious attempts\nagainst Arab foreign ministers and civil society, and dozens of others, warrants special interest. These incidents also reflect current tensions\namong Gulf states, undergirding the ubiquitous and central role of cyber espionage in Middle Eastern statecraft.\n\nIn absence of personally-identifiable information or even descriptive identifiers within the campaigns, we are labeling this actor “Bahamut,” after\nJorge Luis Borges’ monstrous fish afloat in the fathomless Arabian Sea from the Book of Imaginary Beings. Regardless of who is behind the\ncampaign, these incidents provide a window into the broad scale of Middle Eastern cyber espionage and the constant struggles in attribution of\nattacks, and we attempt for this report to be understandable even for those not as well versed in digital forensics or cyber security.\n\n## Credential Harvesting\n\nOur direct observation of in-the-wild spearphishing attacks staged by the Bahamut group have been solely attempts to deceive targets into\nproviding account passwords through impersonation of notices from platform providers. The tactics taken in these attempts revolve around\ncredential theft, and while the group is not extremely sophisticated it has sometimes demonstrated considerable ingenuity, flexibility and\nprofessionalism. Bahamut was first noticed when it targeted a Middle Eastern human rights activist in the first week of January 2017. Later that\nmonth, the same tactics and patterns were seen in attempts against an Iranian women’s activist – an individual commonly targeted by Iranian\n[actors, such as Charming Kitten and the Sima campaign documented in our 2016 Black Hat talk. Recurrent patterns in hostnames,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TBSK9YgI8U)\nregistrations, and phishing scripts provided a strong link between the two incidents, and older attempts were found that directly overlapped with\nthese attacks. Over the course of the following months, several more attempts against the same individuals were observed, intended to steal\ncredentials for iCloud and Gmail accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nBahamut Credential Harvesting Targeting Apple ID Accounts\n\nBahamut Credential Harvesting Targeting Google Accounts\n\nThe credential harvesting campaigns that were observed reflect a moderately professional attempt at impersonation of platform providers,\ncertainly better than the average level of care and preparation seen in the everyday cybercrime that most people have become accustomed to.\nMessages included titles such as “Security info Confirmation” and “Verify your added email,” warning the user to sign in to confirm their\naccount settings or they would lose access. Later attempts posed as a warning to the recipient that the application Truecaller had been granted\n\n\n-----\n\nu access to t e accou t, a d t at you d d ot е о е t s аpp, t e аpp еquеst be cо еd (s c) s s a so co o, t ese\nmessages were sent from Gmail accounts registered to appear official (e.g. info.auth.services (at) gmail). To improve credibility, the attackers\neven displayed a correct but redacted phone number for the account, which we believe they found through the account recovery process of\nGmail. Based on crawling the attacker’s infrastructure, other pages hosted on the same site appeared designed to capture the second\ncredential in two-factor authentication or to compromise the account through deceiving the user to engage in Google’s account recovery\nprocess.\n\nTracking Emails Sent to Targets\n\nBahamut was also observed engaging in reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance attempts, intended to harvest IP addresses of emails\naccounts. One attempt impersonated BBC News Alerts, using timely content related to the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and other Gulf\nstates as bait. This message used external images embedded in the email to track where the lure would be opened. Timestamps contained in\nthe URLs of these tracking images indicate that they were uploaded on April 20. The tactic also aligns with the credential theft attempt we\ndescribe in the following section, including with respect to timing.\n\nTracker Image (Unix Timestamp Bold): hxxp://res.cloudinary[.]com/demcz0ffi/image/upload/v1492692894/inx_header_j31vtx.png\n\n\n-----\n\nArabic Language Version of Google Credential Theft Campaign\n\nTwo features stand out within these phishing pages. First, Bahamut is a multi-lingual actor, although an imperfect one. Samples of attempts\nwere observed in English, Arabic and Persian, with two-letter language codes passed as parameters to the phishing site to tailor the page to\nthe victim. Based on adjusting these parameters, there was no indication that other languages – not even regional languages such as Turkish,\nHebrew, Kurdish, or Urdu – were supported on the phishing pages, let alone French or other international languages.\n\nAnother minor but common improvement were the group’s evasion tactics. Bahamut often replaces Latin characters with similar letters from\nother alphabets (Unicode homoglyphs) in messages and pages. This means that for example the Latin letter “i” is replaced with the visiblyindistinguishable Cyrillic version “і” in key terms. This technique is generally used to avoid automated scanning by spam filters or other security\nsystems that are looking for suspect words or phrases such as “sign in.”\n\n\nΡlеаse sіgn in аgаin to cоntinuе\nto Gmаіl\n\n## Victimology\n\n\n(Greek Rho)l(Cyrlic e)(Cyrillic a)se s(Cyrillic i)gn in (Cyrillic a)g(Cyrillic a)in to c(Cyrillic o)ntinu(Cyrillic e)\nto Gm(Cyrillic a)(Cyrillic i)l\n\n\nWhat makes Bahamut novel is not their techniques but their interests. Across our brief windows of visibility into their activity, there is a\nconsistent set of fundamental interests that suggests political espionage rather than economic motivations. Bahamut is not an ordinary\ncybercrime campaign. Through directly reported phishing incidents, artifacts harvested from their infrastructure, and other public records,\nBahamut appears to be a sustained campaign focused on diverse political, economic, and social sectors in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\nFake Google News Alert Targeting Anwar Gargash\n\nBy our observation, the spearphishing attempts appear to be narrowly targeted against a limited number of individuals (perhaps in the lower\n‘tens’ per month) rather than broad scale. In one instance, in late April 2017, Bahamut appears to have impersonated a Google News alert for\n[an article about Middle Eastern government support for Donald Trump as a lure targeting Anwar Gargash, the U.A.E. Minister of State for](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/04/17/commentary/world-commentary/trumps-middle-east-supporters#.WPf6nDHLfzA)\nForeign Affairs (screenshot inline from an attempt against Gargash that we observed, which also aligns with our BBC notice). At the same time\nwith the same infrastructure, the false notice about the application Truecaller was used to target a relative of Iranian President Hassan\nRouhani, a Saudi college student, two Iranian dissidents, and the head of an Emirati think tank.\n\nOperational security failures on the part of the attackers enabled a brief look into their activities. The phishing site in several Bahamut attempts\nincluded a profile picture of the target to increase the appearance of legitimacy. These images had predictable and short filenames, often the\ntarget’s initials (hypothetically, ‘ag.jpg’ for Anwar Gargash). As a result, we could enumerate potential targets through making requests for\ncombinations of letters. This is a time-consuming and aggressive process: for a three-character maximum (from ‘a.jpg’ up to ‘zzz.jpg’) the\nsearch would entail 17,576 requests. These images were also organized in different folders – an organizational structure that could either\nreflect different campaigns or internal processes (with folder names of ‘ky’, ‘ct’, ‘dy’, and ‘er’). To search all four folders further increased the\namount of requests, involving 70,304 requests for each site. While not a stealthy search, when a similar opportunity arose in our investigation\nfor [Amnesty’s “Operation Kingphish” report, it was a successful and worthwhile one.](https://medium.com/amnesty-insights/operation-kingphish-uncovering-a-campaign-of-cyber-attacks-against-civil-society-in-qatar-and-aa40c9e08852)\n\nWe could be reasonably confident that those images that were return in this brute force search were individuals targeted by Bahamut. The\nprofile pictures also included metadata indicating that the images were copied from Google profiles, further suggesting prior reconnaissance.\nMultiple individuals identified in this manner later confirmed receiving spearphishing messages in recent months, none were surprised about\nthe apparently political nature of the campaign.\n\nThis search yielded 59 images on three domains, with a little more than half being unique pictures. Where the individuals targeted could be\nidentified, the themes reinforce the hypothesis that Bahamut is focused on Middle Eastern political and economic institutions. Moreover, those\nlimited number of non-Middle Eastern targets – Swiss and British nationals – have prolonged involvements in the region as journalists,\ndiplomats, or human rights advocates. Of those clearly identifiable, the targets have been primary located in Egypt, Iran, Palestine, Turkey,\nTunisia, and the United Arab Emirates, including:\n\n**_Arab Middle East_**\n\na company that provides financial services that caters to high-net worth clients with an emphasis on “confidentiality”;\nEgypt-focused media and foreign press, including individuals previously imprisoned in the country;\nmultiple Middle Eastern human rights NGOs and local activists;\na diplomat in the Emirati Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Emirati Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and the head of an Emirati foreign\npolicy think tank;\na prominent Sufi Islamic scholar; and\n\n\n-----\n\nt e U o o ab a s\n\n**_Turkey_**\n\na Delegate of Turkey to UNESCO; and,\nthe Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\n**_Iran_**\n\na relative of the President of Iran;\na women’s rights activist and a prominent female journalist in the diaspora; and,\na reformist politician who is an advisor to the former President Khatami.\n\nStill more references in Virustotal and other databases implicate the actor in additional attempts against Gulf institutions, including the Prime\nMinister’s Court of Bahrain, the Saudi Minister of Energy, and a former member of the Saudi Arabian National Security Council. It is also\nnotable that for a Middle East focused actor, none of the targets of the Bahamut operation appeared to be connected to Israel, but we do not\nbelieve the group to be Israeli.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nBahamut has taken clear precautions in order to avoid scrutiny. Often researchers unravel the vast network of infrastructure used in attacks\nthrough following the connections created by the reuse of email addresses in domain name registrations and site hosting. Bahamut’s vigilance\ncuts the trail short quickly.\n\nWeb Created Across Bahamut’s Registration Addresses\n\nA consistent theme in the registration of Bahamut domain names is the use of private registration services and throw away accounts from the\nMail.Ru Group. The fictitious email addresses are fairly consistent – an Anglo-European name sometimes followed by a number at mail.ru.\nEach account is used for the registration of only one domain. These addresses also appear in the other records for the domain (specifically,\nthe Start of Authority record in DNS). Only on rare occasions do the attackers slip up and mismatch the accounts used between both records.\nA subtle web is weaved based on the accounts being connected through their reuse as recovery addresses when they create new accounts.\n\nSimilarly, while multiple phishing sites are maintained by Bahamut in parallel, the sites are hosted on their own dedicated servers. While\ndomains may be reused across time, the attackers use different subdomains for different campaigns. Importantly, they are quick to take down\nsites that appear to have been noticed. These shutdowns also provide fingerprint of Bahamut, albeit non-exclusive to the group, which\ncommonly entail redirection (HTTP 302 code) to the “www.accessdenied.com” site.\n\nAttack subdomains for Bahamut, including a subdomain believed to target the Prime Minister’s Court of Bahrain (domain: my-validation[.]info):\n\nvalid.appid.support.validate-maillogon.service.authuser.continue.frontend.reason.redirect.file-manager.version-9.1.101.viewsettings.svjjykd5v2vum3fbsxlgmxfmr3pjdklh.access-https.my-validation[.]info\n\nvvebrnail.prnc.gov.bh.362393h11idk.930012hfifd994.acccess.authdll.my-validation[.]info\n\n\n-----\n\nFree hosting provider used by Bahamut to avoid scrutiny.\n\nOur investigation has also shown a clear learning process. Whereas previous sites would stay active for days after an attempt, in recent\nincidents it was deleted within minutes (perhaps automatically) and the subdomain is taken offline within the day. In doing so, Bahamut\nnarrowed the window for forensic investigation, quite effectively. After the crawling of images and victim information was noticed, Bahamut took\nfurther steps to hide their infrastructure – using free hosting services as a redirection mechanisms and for hosting images used in phishing\nemails.\n\n## Overlapping Infrastructure\n\nWhile Bahamut took precautions to avoid linkability, it has concentrated on a limited number of networks. Specifically, it has a tendency to use\nhosting companies known to be slow to respond to abuse. These habits build fingerprints. Combining their preference for certain networks with\ntheir patterns in fictitious registration addresses, we can began build searchable indicators to identify other domains associated with the same\ngroup – albeit weak indicators.\n\nIn order to identify more of the attacker’s infrastructure, we aggregated all the domain names we could find that have been pointed to the\nnetworks known to be used by Bahamut from various sources (e.g. passive DNS and DomainTools). We then queried those domains (for the\nSOA “rname” record) and flagged those with a Mail.Ru Group address. Mistakes on their part also led to more suspicious mail addresses to\nsearch on. The resulting group was surprisingly small given the open-ended search (included in the Indicators of Compromise section below).\nNo resulting domain appeared to be a legitimate site, or even directed toward more standard cybercrime. Most appeared to be credential\nharvesting sites similar to our original set, with some confirmed to be malicious and relevant based on URLs appearing in Virustotal.\n\nFour domains stand out as different from credential theft and are worth additional discussion.\n\n\nmyvalidation[.]info\n\n\n91.235.143.214 91.235.143.199 alfajrtaqni[.]org 86400  IN   SOA   ns1.alfajrtaqni.org. wendy.walker.bk.ru.\n2016051403 3600 7200 1209600 86400\n\n\n-----\n\nO e o t e do a s t t s set s a o o t e a Qaeda assoc ated aj ed a Ce te ec ca Co ttee a aj ed a Ce te s\nthe developer of the “Security of the Mujahid” (Amn Almujahid) encryption application, and the site in question hosts copies of the application.\nDespite the creation of the domain on March 2016, it appears to be an out of date mirror of the al-Fajr Media Center captured in March 2015,\npotentially from another mirror (alfajrtaqni[.]ws). While the suspicious al-Fajr Media Center hosts an older version of the organization’s Android\nand Windows applications, with newer versions posted to the real site after the snapshot was taken, those files appear to be same as the\noriginal (same checksums). There is little indication as to how the site was used.\n\nThe remaining three are equally interesting:\n\n**Domain** IP DNS SOA Record (Includes Mail.Ru Group Email)\n\n**16linesquran[.]info.** 178.17.171.140 86400  IN   SOA   ns1.16linesquran.info. m.cutov.mail.ru. 2016041500 3600 7200 1209600\n86400\n\n**khuaitranslator[.]com.** 178.17.171.39 86400  IN   SOA   ns1.khuaitranslator.com. andy.mingle.mail.ru. 2017040514 3600 7200\n1209600 86400\n\n**timesofarab[.]com** 91.235.143.246 86400  IN   SOA   ns1.timesofarab.com. randall.kaine.mail.ru. 2017010303 3600 7200\n1209600 86400\n\n### Android Malware\n\nTwo of the suspicious sites are connected with Android applications, which are custom malware agents that have not been widely-promoted\n(again, unlike most cybercrime). The “16 Lines” and “Khuai Translator” applications have small installation bases (respectively, “50-100” and\n“1-5” from Play Store statistics). The 16 Lines app, last release in March 2016, is a fully functional Urdu-language Quran application. Khuai\nTranslator is a Chinese-English translator that relies on Yandex’s translation service (despite also including code for Microsoft’s service) and is\n[a little more than four months old. Unsurprisingly, Khuai Translator appears to have appropriated its name from a Firefox extension, and 16](https://github.com/xjim/KuaiTranslator)\n[Lines from a Quran archive. In neither case is it clear who the intended audience of the application is, and there is little record of their domains](http://quranin16line.com/)\nbeing pushed to targets.\n\n16 Lines Quran https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=holy.qur.quran szymon.tchorzewski88@gmail.com\n\nKhuai Translator https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.translator.chinese caren.hee789@gmail.com\n\n\n-----\n\nKhaui Translator\n\n\n-----\n\n16 Lines Quran\n\n\n-----\n\nPermissions Required for 16 Lines Quran\n\nAs would be expected, both applications are designed to exfiltrate private information from the mobile device and monitor the activities of the\ntarget, reporting back to the attacker:\n\nSMS messages and phone call logs;\ncontact information from the address book;\nbrowser history and bookmarks;\nphone hardware identifiers; and,\nprecise location and network information.\n\nBoth also advertise recording functions in the actual application, such as recording Quranic recitations or words for translation. This may be\noffered in order to provide a veneer of legitimacy to their large set of required permissions.\n\nThe malware is also of low quality – in version 1.1 of Khuai Translator, the URLs to report back to the attacker contain typos (e.g. “htpp://”) that\nwould lead to them being non-functional. This was resolved in a subsequent update, but other typos are present in both applications across\nweb properties, internal functions, and application dialogues, suggesting that quality was not a priority for the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nShared Code in Khuai Translator and 16 Lines Quran\n\nWhile the two applications are not exactly the same malware, both appear to have the same core design and tactics, such as hiding the\nmalicious functions within classes that appear related to the legitimate application. In both applications, the malware strangely reports back to\na different web address for each type of information with the full URL repeatedly defined; this works fine, but is not something a mature\nprogrammer would do. These URLs are individually scattered across the application and encrypted to reduce detection (AES-128-ECB and\nencoded within latin1 character set). Both samples appear to share the same code for voice recording, network transmission, and encryption of\nURLs. These commonalities, down to similarly patterned contact addresses on the Play Store, strongly suggest that they have the same\nmaintainers despite the use of pseudonyms and minor differences.\n\nHiding Browser Monitoring Functions in Application Code Labeled as Translation Services\n\nGiven the natural differences in audiences between the Android malware and the credential harvesting (China and Pakistan versus the Middle\nEast), it is difficult to be fully confident of the link between both operations. Nothing within the applications directly connects both campaigns,\ndespite other vague similarities. For example, the beacon endpoints of both applications are loosely reminiscent of those of the Bahamut\nspearphishing campaigns, with short file names, use of the PHP scripting language, and located within randomly-named folders:\n\nhttp://www.16linesquran[.]info/dhReqIopT/QzXrvTHG/ct.php\nhttp://www.khuaitranslator[.]com/TQaxcTr/spPlVl/WordTranslate.php\n\n\n-----\n\ns o t e t e o pub cat o, t e s te assoc ated t 6 es Qu a as do, etu g t e sa e 03 o b dde essage a a o\nBahamut sites. The Khuai Translator’s site and the malware endpoints remain operational.\n\n16 Lines Quran Removed with Error Similar to Known Bahamut Pages.\n\n### Times of Arab\n\nLast within the search results is the “Times of Arab” (timesofarab[.]com), on face value the only legitimate appearing site. The Times of Arab is\nparticularly relevant to the Bahamut campaign as it is focused exclusively on the Gulf region. Those behind the site have been consistently\nactive for at least five months. As with the al-Fajr Media Center, its end intent is unclear as no malicious activity has been observed. However,\nthe content and description of the site warrants scrutiny. For example, the About page for the Times of Arab is notable for its overall generic\nmission and claim of threats against staff (repetition and quotes in original).\n\nTimes of Arab Home Page\n\n\n-----\n\nTo bring substantial news to the surface, which is otherwise underreported by the global media. Our journalists ensure the stories that\nreach you are impartial and unaffected from any sort of vested interest. We want to reshape the world media by strengthening our bond\nwith the readers, a bond formed with trust and truth. The defined goals are the reason why Times of Arab audience is growing rapidly –\naudience that appreciates our work. Responsibilities shared by our employees are strenuous, but they are needed in order to report\nnews that is free from perception of any country, state, organization or individual. Although Times of Arab is centered in the Middle-East,\nour revelations also encompass incisive range of global issues. Times of Arab journalists keep a low profile and wear masks of\nanonymity due to threats they have recently received from different directions. “Times of Arab journalists keep a low profile and wear\nmasks of anonymity due to threats they have recently received from different directions.”\n\nThe premise of threats against the Times of Arab is surprising given the content. The articles posted to the site are uniformly positive stories\nabout Gulf regimes copied from elsewhere, including from regional state media organizations.\n\nStrange Content Posted to Times of Arab\n\nThe content is both targeted and irregular in quality. The Times of Arab often posts nonsensical articles with mismatched titles, strange\ncombination of images, and misspells country names within the filenames of images (e.g. “soudi,” “saoudi,” “kuaiti,” and “behrain”). For\nexample, an ominous image with the phrase “Arab Spring” – referring to the 2011 uprisings – headlines one article where the content covers a\nseasonal basketball game that was copied from an Arab, Alabama newspaper (hence, ‘Arab spring game’). While there are occasional\ntechnology stories, the majority of the articles focus on regional labor rights and social issues with titles such as “Nepal leaders praise Qatar’s\ntreatment of expat labour” and “[FIFA chief] Infantino praises progress on Qatar 2022 worker conditions.” This focus recalls the themes in\ntargeting in the Operation Kingphish campaign.\n\nThe Times of Arab is active across social media, with its uploaded YouTube videos being copied content from AP, Al Jazeera, and other\npersonal YouTube videos – again primarily about Qatar and the Gulf region. The Twitter account of the Times of Arab follows several human\nrights organizations, such ARTICLE 19, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, including their regional accounts, as well as Qatar and\nEmirati related accounts – also reminiscent of Operation Kingphish.\n\n\n-----\n\nSocial Media Presence, All Copied Content\n\n## Attribution and Origin\n\nThe measures taken by the attackers to conceal their identity have constrained our ability to make definitive assertions about who is behind the\nBahamut campaign. As noted previously, the consistent use of fictitious personas in registration and maintenance of infrastructure leaves a\nshort trail. The scripts and sites themselves do not have obvious hints as to their origins. Extending out the potential activity to include malware\nposing as a Chinese-English translator clouds the picture further.\n\nOn two occasions, compromised accounts provided IP addresses connected to the attackers. In the first case, initially, the attacker accessed a\nbreached account using a feature that allows Mail.Ru accounts to access Gmail accounts (if they have the proper credentials). This approach\nallowed the attacker to conceal their original address, to bypass Google’s monitoring of suspicious logins, and to maintain persistent access.\nHowever, later they attempted to access the accounts through logging in directly, doing so through two networks in Europe – at least one that\nwas an OpenVPN server (185.113.128[.]207 and 185.161.208[.]37). These addresses provide little direct insight into where the attacker is\nlocated, but did bolster their operational security credentials.\n\nIn a second case, an account was breached in early morning hours Gulf time through an ADSL connection provided by Emirates\nTelecommunications Corporation in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (83.110.89[.]246). However, this traffic could be originating from a\ncompromised machine – a possibility supported by the amount of exposed services found in a portscan of the address. The overlap would be\nespecially surprising given that this occurred within the context of attempts against the Emirati Foreign Minister.\n\nBahamut appears on face value to have common traits with Operation Kingphish, but operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms\nof professionalism and ambition. The phishing sites found in the campaign also recalls some of the design choices made with the Operation\nKingphish attempts against Qatar-focused labor rights activists. For example the ropelastic[.]com phishing site from Operation Kingphish used\nthe same hosting providers seen in Bahamut, had a similar overreliance on the tinyurl URL shortener, and was registered with a\n“stuart.boarden@mail[.]ru” address (that also used another Mail.Ru account as backup, “mik*********@mail.ru”). This extends to the variable\nnames with the source code of phishing pages and other infrastructure choices of the attackers.

As a result, there is not yet a definitive link between\nKingphish and Bahamut despite the overlap in time.\n\nDespite its focus on Iranian targets, Bahamut does not appear to be Iranian, or well prepared to effectively target Persian speakers. In the one\nPersian-language spearphishing email observed, the content was poorly-written with the grammatical mistakes that would be expected of\nGoogle Translate. The attackers also incorrectly use “pe” to identify whether the phishing page should be Persian – we would expect that a\nPersian-language speaker would be aware that the correct designation is “fa.”\n\n\n-----\n\nPersian-language phishing emails, with grammatical errors.\n\nRelatedly, the English used in the messages reflected the grammatical mistakes of a non-native speaker (rather a translation) combined with a\nlack of concern or awareness about professionalism. The single Arabic-language page that we were able to find had similar lack of\nprofessionalism – using the Arabic for “verify” rather than the “sign in” that is actually used by Google. Unlike Persian this was seemingly a\nmistake of professionalism rather than capability and did not necessarily indicate the use of a translation service.\n\nWe would be remiss not to address the frequent use of Russian services: this does not stand out beyond what we might expect of someone\nattempting to avoid scrutiny, such as using a provider that does not require phone numbers or comply with U.S. law. Many non-Russian groups\nuse services such as Yandex and Mail.Ru, and so there is no indication of Bahamut being of Russian-origin.\n\nIn the end, our selection of the name “Bahamut” is motivated by the strange behavior of the group, which seems to sprawl across different\ncountries and contexts. If the malware agents, Kingphish, and the observed spearphishing attempts are all in fact related, then Bahamut’s\ninterest exceed our expectations for the espionage activities a single Middle Eastern country. While Gulf countries have global interests, the\ntargeting of obscure Iranian reformist figures, let alone the creation of Urdu and Chinese language malware applications, stretches the\nboundaries of imagination. Taken in the context of the overlapping domains, the diversity suggests that Bahamut is not necessarily a state\nactor, and instead could be a more independent entity seeking financial remuneration from more than one client.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhoever is behind the spearphishing and malware documented, the Bahamut campaign is descriptive of how unique the Middle East is in\nterms of cyber espionage and other cyber operations. The diverse set of political and economic interests that makes the region so contentious\ndraws in attention from many actors for different motivations. These incidents also bear witness to a region in technological transition. As is\nwell documented by now, international powers are actively engaged in cyber espionage against diverse targets in the Middle East, while\nseveral regional states have begun to pursue their own interests. These offensive and defensive capabilities are not uniform, and the purchase\nof arms from abroad has not been shown to include tools for conducting cyber options (aside from surveillance platforms). Bahamut is\ntherefore notable as a vision of the future where modern communications has lowered barriers for smaller countries to conduct effective\nsurveillance on domestic dissidents and to extend themselves beyond their borders.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Staging\n\ndpasdas.000webhostapp[.]com\n\nmailgooqlecominboxasm9003nmjknsidnpopjdasdkopm 000webhostapp[ ]com\n\n\n-----\n\n### Obse ed C ede t a a est g\n\nauthprofile[.]info\n\nauthuser[.]info\n\nmyprofileprivacy[.]com\n\nmyprofileview[.]info\n\nmyvalidation[.]info\n\nsession-id[.]com\n\nver-icloud[.]com\n\nmy-validation[.]info\n\nprofilesupport[.]info\n\n### Overlapping Infrastructure\n\n16linesquran[.]info\n\nalfajrtaqni[.]org\n\nkhuaitranslator[.]com\n\nmail-sllogin[.]com\n\ntimesofarab[.]com\n\nernail-ver[.]com\n\nrnail[.]info\n\nsession-icloud[.]com\n\ncert-icloud[.]com\n\nmyinfosettings[.]com\n\nupdate-mailservice[.]com\n\nmy-auth[.]info\n\ninfocheckup[.]com\n\nmanagemysettings[.]com\n\nmanage-mysettings[.]com\n\nweb2chost[.]com\n\ncom-settings-ppsecure[.]com\n\ngolge[.]cc\n\nmainlogin[.]co\n\nicloud-auth[.]com\n\nacc-dot[.]com\n\n### Overlapping Android Malware\n\n73f2c81473720629be32695800b7ad83494f2084 Khuai Translator v1.2\n\n2f239a96987284a4883014cf1dad39c16f8fc7ad Khuai Translator v1.1\n\n60191fa19fb1184535608d7640a11320e59b0ab2 16 Lines v1.1\n\nKhaui Translator encryption key: Huisgte87Hdy4Oli\n\n\n-----\n\n6 es e c ypt o ey s b e8Qo6Oq Q\n\n\n-----",
