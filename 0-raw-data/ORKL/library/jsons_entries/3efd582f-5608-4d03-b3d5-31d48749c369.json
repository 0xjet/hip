Meanwhile, the defenders—namely,\n\n security teams—must constantly improve their approach\n\n to protecting the organization and users from these\n\n increasingly sophisticated campaigns.\n\n Caught in the middle are the users. But now, it appears\n\n they not only are the targets, but also the complicit\n\n enablers of attacks.\n\n The Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report, which presents\n\n the research, insights, and perspectives provided by\n\n Cisco® Security Research and other security experts\n\n within Cisco, explores the ongoing race between\n\n attackers and defenders, and how users are becoming\n\n ever-weaker links in the security chain.\n\n Cybersecurity is a broad and complex topic that has a\n\n far-reaching impact on users, companies, governments,\n\n and other entities around the world. The Cisco 2015\n\n Annual Security Report is divided into four areas of\n\n discussion. These sections, and the issues explored\n\n within them, may at first glance seem disparate, but\n\n closer examination reveals their interconnectedness:\n\n\nFour discussion areas of the\n_Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report:_\n\n1. Threat Intelligence\n\n2. Cisco Security Capabilities\nBenchmark Study\n\n3. Geopolitical and Industry Trends\n\n4. Changing the View Toward\nCybersecurity—From Users to the\nCorporate Boardroom\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. Threat Intelligence**\nThis section provides an overview of the latest threat research\nfrom Cisco, including updates on exploit kits, spam, threats\nand vulnerabilities, and malvertising (malicious advertising)\ntrends. Online criminals’ growing reliance on users to help\nlaunch their attacks is also examined. To produce their\nanalysis of observed trends in 2014, Cisco Security Research\nutilized a global set of telemetry data. The threat intelligence\nprovided in the report represents work conducted by top\nsecurity experts across Cisco.\n\n**2. Security Capabilities Benchmark Study**\nTo gauge perceptions of security professionals on the state of\nsecurity in their organizations, Cisco asked chief information\nsecurity officers (CISOs) and security operations (SecOps)\nmanagers in nine countries and at organizations of different\nsizes about their security resources and procedures. The\nstudy’s findings are exclusive to the Cisco 2015 Annual\n_Security Report._\n\n**3. Geopolitical and Industry Trends**\nIn this section, Cisco security, geopolitical, and policy\nexperts identify current and emerging geopolitical trends that\norganizations—particularly, multinational companies—should\nmonitor. In focus: how cybercrime is flourishing in areas of\nweak governance. Also covered are recent developments\naround the world related to the issues of data sovereignty,\ndata localization, encryption, and data compatibility.\n\n\n**4. Changing the View Toward Cybersecurity—From Users**\n**to the Corporate Boardroom**\nCisco security experts suggest that it is time for organizations\nto start viewing their approach to cybersecurity differently if\nthey want to achieve real-world security. Strategies include\nadopting more sophisticated security controls to help\ndefend against threats before, during, and after an attack;\nmaking security a topic at the corporate boardroom level;\nand implementing the Cisco Security Manifesto, a set of\nsecurity principles that can help organizations become more\ndynamic in their approach to security—and more adaptive and\ninnovative than adversaries.\n\nThe interconnectedness of the security topics covered\nin the Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report comes down\nto this: Attackers have become more proficient at taking\nadvantage of gaps in security to hide and conceal their\nmalicious activity. Users—and security teams—are both part\nof the security problem. While many defenders believe their\nsecurity processes are optimized—and their security tools\nare effective—in truth, their security readiness likely needs\nimprovement. What happens in the geopolitical landscape,\nfrom legislation to security threats, can have a direct impact\non business operations and how an organization addresses\nsecurity. And taking into consideration all these factors, it\nhas never been more critical for organizations of all sizes\nto understand that security is a people problem, that\ncompromise is inevitable, and that the time to take a new\napproach to security is now.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Discoveries\n##### Following are key discoveries presented in the Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report.\n\n\n**Attackers have become more proficient at taking**\n**advantage of gaps in security to hide and conceal**\n**malicious activity.**\n\n- In 2014, 1 percent of high-urgency common vulnerabilities\nand exposure (CVE) alerts were actively exploited.\nThis means organizations must prioritize and patch that\n1 percent of all vulnerabilities quickly. But even with leading\nsecurity technology, excellence in process is required to\naddress vulnerabilities.\n\n- Since the Blackhole exploit kit was sidelined in 2013, no\nother exploit kit has been able to achieve similar heights of\nsuccess. However, the top spot may not be as coveted by\nexploit kit authors as it once was.\n\n- Java exploits have decreased by 34 percent, as Java\nsecurity improves and adversaries move to embrace new\nattack vectors.\n\n- Flash malware can now interact with JavaScript to help\nconceal malicious activity, making it much harder to detect\nand analyze.\n\n- Spam volume increased 250 percent from January 2014\nto November 2014.\n\n- Snowshoe spam, which involves sending low volumes of\nspam from a large set of IP addresses to avoid detection,\nis an emerging threat.\n\n**Users and IT teams have become unwitting parts of the**\n**security problem.**\n\n- Online criminals rely on users to install malware or help\nexploit security gaps.\n\n- Heartbleed, the dangerous security flaw, critically exposes\nOpenSSL. Yet 56 percent of all OpenSSL versions are older\nthan 50 months and are therefore still vulnerable.\n\n\n\n- Users’ careless behavior when using the Internet, combined\nwith targeted campaigns by adversaries, places many\nindustry verticals at higher risk of web malware exposure. In\n2014, the pharmaceutical and chemical industry emerged\nas the number-one highest-risk vertical for web malware\nexposure, according to Cisco Security Research.\n\n- Malware creators are using web browser add-ons as a\nmedium for distributing malware and unwanted applications.\nThis approach to malware distribution is proving successful\nfor malicious actors because many users inherently trust\nadd-ons or simply view them as benign.\n\n**The Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study reveals**\n**disconnects in perceptions of security readiness.**\n\n- Fifty-nine percent of chief information security officers\n(CISOs) view their security processes as optimized, compared\nto 46 percent of security operations (SecOps) managers.\n\n- About 75 percent of CISOs see their security tools as very\nor extremely effective, with about one-quarter perceiving\nsecurity tools as only somewhat effective.\n\n- Ninety-one percent of respondents from companies\nwith sophisticated security strongly agree that company\nexecutives consider security a high priority.\n\n- Less than 50 percent of respondents use standard\ntools such as patching and configuration to help prevent\nsecurity breaches.\n\n- Larger, midsize organizations are more likely to have highly\nsophisticated security postures, compared to organizations\nof other sizes included in the study.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n**Executive Summary .......................................................... 2**\n\n**Key Discoveries................................................................. 4**\n\n**Attackers vs. Defenders: An Ongoing Race .................... 6**\n\n**1.

They’ve recognized the\nbusiness necessity of a strong security posture—and express\nconfidence that their security processes are optimized.\nTechnology vendors are also more attentive toward finding\nand fixing vulnerabilities in their products, giving criminals\nfewer opportunities to launch exploits.\n\nBut at the same time, adversaries are becoming more\nsophisticated not only in their approaches to launching\nattacks, but also in evading detection:\n\n- They change their tactics and tools from moment to moment,\ndisappearing from a network before they can be stopped, or\nquickly choosing a different method to gain entry.\n\n- They devise spam campaigns using hundreds of IP\naddresses in an attempt to bypass IP-based anti-spam\nreputation products.\n\n- They design malware that relies on tools that users trust, or\nview as benign, to persistently infect and hide in plain sight\non their machines.\n\n- They find new vulnerabilities to exploit if vendors shut down\nweaknesses in other products.\n\n- They work at establishing a hidden presence or blend in\nwith the targeted organization, sometimes taking weeks or\nmonths to establish multiple footholds in infrastructure and\nuser databases. Only when they are ready will they execute\ntheir core mission.\n\nAccording to the new Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark\n_Study (see page 24), security professionals say they’re optimistic_\nthat they’re well prepared to hold back online attackers. Yet\nadversaries continue to steal information, make money through\nscams, or disrupt networks for political goals. In the end, security\nis a numbers game: Even if an organization blocks 99.99 percent\nof billions of spam messages, some will make it through. There is\nno way to ensure 100 percent effectiveness.\n\nWhen these messages or exploits manage to reach users, it\nis the users themselves who become the weak point in the\n\n\nnetwork. Since enterprises have become more adept at using\nsolutions that block network breaches, malware, and spam,\nmalicious actors may instead exploit users through tactics\nsuch as sending them a fake request for a password reset.\n\nWith users becoming ever-weaker links in the security\nchain, enterprises have choices to make when implementing\nsecurity technologies and policies: As developers try to make\napplications and software more intuitive and easy to use, do\norganizations open new loopholes for cybercriminals to exploit?\nDo enterprises bypass users, assuming they cannot be trusted\nor taught, and install stricter security controls that impede\nhow users do their jobs? Do they take the time to educate\nusers on why security controls are in place, and clearly explain\nhow users play a vital role in helping the organization achieve\ndynamic security that supports the business?\n\nAs the principles outlined in the Cisco Security Manifesto\non page 45 suggest, it is the latter. Technology solutions\nrarely empower users to take charge of security as active\nparticipants. Instead, they force them to work around security\ntools that get in the way of their workday—thus leaving the\nbusiness less secure. Security is no longer a question of if\na network will be compromised. Every network will, at some\npoint, be compromised. What will an organization do then?\nAnd if security staff knew the network was going to be\ncompromised, would it approach security differently?\n\nThe Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report presents the latest\nresearch from its Cisco Security Research group. The team\nexamines security industry advances designed to help\norganizations and users defend against attacks, and the\ntechniques and strategies employed by adversaries hoping\nto break through those defenses. The report also highlights\nkey findings from the Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark\n_Study, which examines the security posture of enterprises_\nand their perceptions of their preparedness to defend against\nattacks. Geopolitical trends, global developments around data\nlocalization, the value of more sophisticated secure access\ncontrols, segmentation based on role-based access, and the\nimportance of making cybersecurity a boardroom topic are\nalso discussed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. Threat Intelligence\n\n###### Cisco Security Research has assembled and analyzed security insights in this report based on a global set of telemetry data. Cisco security experts perform ongoing research and analysis of discovered threats, such as malware traffic, which can provide insights on possible future criminal behavior and aid in the detection of threats.\n\n Web Exploits: For Exploit Kit Authors, Holding the Top Spot May Not Mean You’re the Best\n\n\nIn the business world, companies strive to be known as\nindustry leaders. But for exploit kit authors operating in the\nso-called “shadow economy,” maintaining fourth or fifth\nposition among leading exploit kits may be an even more\ntelling sign of success, according to Cisco Security Research.\n\nAs reported in the Cisco 2014 Midyear Security Report,\nthere has been no clear leader among exploit kits since late\n2013.[1] That’s when authorities sidelined the widely used,\nwell-maintained, and highly effective Blackhole exploit kit\nafter arresting its alleged creator and distributor, known as\n“Paunch.” Cisco Security Research suggests that a key\nreason no dominant exploit kit exists—yet—is simply because\nno other kit has emerged as a true technological leader\namong contenders. Another trend observed: Since takedown\nof Paunch and Blackhole, more exploit kit users appear\nto be taking care to invest in kits known to be technically\nsophisticated in terms of their ability to evade detection.\n\nThroughout 2014, Angler, Sweet Orange, and Goon were\nthe exploit kits observed most often “in the wild,” according\nto Cisco security experts. Among all exploit kits, Angler was\ndetected in the field most frequently during 2014, and for\nreasons that are unclear, was especially prevalent in late\nAugust. Cisco Security Research attributes Angler’s popularity\nto the decision by its author(s) to eliminate the requirement of\ndownloading a Windows executable to deliver malware.\n\nAngler’s use of Flash, Java, Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE),\nand even Silverlight vulnerabilities makes this exploit kit the\n“one to watch,” say Cisco researchers. Once the exploit is\ntriggered, the malware payload is written directly into memory\nin a process such as iexplore.exe, instead of being written to\na disk. The payload delivered by Angler looks like a blob of\nencrypted data, which makes it harder to identify and block.\n\n\nTo learn more about Angler, and how malvertising\n(malicious advertising) is used as a primary avenue\nfor delivering the exploit kit to users, see the Cisco\n[Security blog post, “Angling for Silverlight Exploits.”](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/angling-for-silverlight-exploits)\n\nThe Sweet Orange exploit kit is also very dynamic; its\ncomponents, ports, and payload URLs change constantly so\nthat Sweet Orange can remain effective and avoid detection.\nThis positions Sweet Orange as the “most likely to succeed”\namong exploit kits, according to Cisco Security Research.\nSweet Orange distributes a range of malware to unpatched\nend-user systems, and includes exploits for vulnerabilities\nin Adobe Flash Player, IE, and Java. Adversaries who use\nSweet Orange often rely on malvertising to redirect users to\nwebsites—including legitimate sites—that host the exploit kit.\nUsers are usually redirected at least twice in the process.\nCompromised websites running outdated versions of content\nmanagement systems (CMS) such as WordPress and Joomla\nare other locations known to be ripe for hosting the Sweet\nOrange exploit kit.[2]\n\nAs for the Goon exploit kit, Cisco Security Research points to\nits reputation for reliability as the likely reason for its modest\nbut consistent popularity in 2014; it also has earned the\ndistinction of being “the most organized” compared to other\nexploit kits. Originally discovered by security researchers in\n2013, Goon—known also as the “Goon/Infinity exploit kit”—is\na malware distribution framework that generates exploits for\nbrowser vulnerabilities pertaining to Flash, Java, or Silverlight\ncomponents on Windows and Mac platforms.[3]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Exploit Kit Trends: Number of Unique Hits\nDetected from January to November 2014\n\n88% Overall average decline\nin exploit kits detected in 2014\n\nJan. 2014 Exploit Kits: Unique Hits by Month Nov. 2014\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\nWhile the overall number of exploit kits detected in the\nfield had dropped by 87 percent in the months following\nthe demise of the Blackhole exploit kit, the number of kits\ndetected by Cisco Security Research increased over the\nsummer of 2014 (see Figure 1). In the last two weeks of\nAugust, they observed a significant spike in the number of\ndetections in the field of the Angler exploit kit. However, by\nNovember, the overall number of detections of known exploit\nkits had once again declined, with Angler and Goon/Infinity\nstill showing up most frequently. The overall average decline\nin the number of exploit kits detected between May and\nNovember 2014 is 88 percent.\n\n###### Threats and Vulnerabilities:  Java Declines as an Attack Vector\n\nIn recent years, Java has played an unwanted starring role\nin lists of the most prevalent and severe vulnerabilities to\nexploit. However, Java appears to be falling out of favor\namong adversaries searching for the fastest, easiest, and\n\nFigure 2. Top Vendor and Product Vulnerability Exploits\n\n\n[Read the Cisco Security blog post, “Fiesta Exploit](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/fiesta-exploit-pack-is-no-party-for-drive-by-victims)\n[Pack Is No Party for Drive-By Victims,” to find out](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/fiesta-exploit-pack-is-no-party-for-drive-by-victims)\nhow companies can defend against the Fiesta\nexploit kit. This kit delivers malware through attack\nvectors such as Silverlight and uses dynamic DNS\ndomains (DDNS) as exploit landing pages.\n\nFor details on the Nuclear exploit kit, and its\nability to assess a user’s system to determine\nvulnerabilities and deliver appropriate malware\n[types, see the Cisco Security blog post, “Evolution](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/evolution-nuclear-ek)\n[of the Nuclear Exploit Kit.”](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/evolution-nuclear-ek)\n\nleast detectable ways to launch exploits using software\nvulnerabilities, according to Cisco Security Research.\n\nOf the top 25 vendor- and product-related vulnerability alerts\nfrom January 1, 2014, to November 30, 2014, only one was\nJava-related (see Table 1’s Common Vulnerability Scoring\nSystem [CVSS] chart on page 10). In 2013, Cisco Security\nResearch tracked 54 urgent new Java vulnerabilities; in 2014,\nthe number of tracked Java vulnerabilities fell to just 19. This\nshould not detract online criminals from the popularity and\neffectiveness of attacking these older vulnerabilities that\npersist today.\n\nData from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) shows a\nsimilar decline: NVD reported 309 Java vulnerabilities in 2013\nand 253 new Java vulnerabilities in 2014. (Cisco Security\nResearch tracks significant vulnerabilities that score high on\nthe CVSS scale, hence the lower number, while the NVD\nincludes all reported vulnerabilities.)

The growing number of\nApache Struts Framework exploits is an example of the trend\ntoward criminals compromising online infrastructure as a way\nto expand their reach and ability during their attacks.\n\nFigure 4. Cumulative Annual Alert Totals\n\n\nThe Apache Struts Framework is a logical starting point for\nexploits due to its popularity.\n\nFigure 3 highlights the most popular product categories that\nwere exploited in 2014.\n\nIn 2014, applications and infrastructure were the most\nfrequently exploited, according to Cisco Security Research\ndata. Content management systems (CMS) are also preferred\ntargets; adversaries rely on websites running outdated\nversions of CMS to facilitate exploit delivery\n\n**Cumulative Annual Alerts on a Decline**\n\nAnnual alert totals, the cumulative new and updated product\nvulnerabilities reported in 2014 and compiled by Cisco\nSecurity Research, appear to be on the decline (Figure 4). As\nof November 2014, total alerts fell below 2013 totals by 1.8\npercent. The percentage may be small, but it is the first time\nin recent years that alerts have fallen in number compared to\nthe previous year.\n\nThe most likely reason for the decline is the growing attention\nto software testing and development on the part of vendors.\nImproved development lifecycles appear to reduce the\nnumber of vulnerabilities that criminals can easily exploit.\n\n|6756|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|537||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||\n\n\n11.6%\n\nExploits\n\n32.6%\n\n\n11.6%\n\n\n11.6%\n\n\nJanuary December\n2012 2013 2014\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\nExploits\n\n\n11.6%\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1.

As shown in Figure 5, the\ntotal number of new alerts and the annual total are even or\nslightly declining in 2014 compared to 2013.\n\nTable 1 illustrates some of the most commonly exploited\nvulnerabilities, according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring\nSystem (CVSS).

Modern versions of Java\nautomatically patch, and older, more vulnerable versions of\nthe Java Runtime Environment are being blocked by default\nby browser vendors. Apple is even taking the extra step of\ndisabling old and vulnerable versions of Java and patching\nthem through automatic updates. In addition, the U.S.\nComputer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has been\nrecommending since January 2013 that computer users\nsecure, disable, or remove Java.\n\nThe latest version of Java, Java 8, has stronger controls\nthan previous releases. It is also harder to exploit because it\nnow requires human interaction, like code signing and a user\ndialogue that asks the user to enable Java. Online criminals\nhave discovered easier targets and have turned their attention\n\nFigure 7. Comparison of Volume Trends by Attack Vector\n\n\nto non-Java vectors that deliver higher return on investment.\nFor example, many users fail to update Adobe Flash and PDF\nreaders or browsers regularly, providing criminals with a wider\nrange of both old and new vulnerabilities to exploit. And as\nreported in the Cisco 2014 Midyear Security Report, the\nnumber of exploit kits that include Microsoft Silverlight exploits\nis growing.[4]\n\nFigure 7 shows that Java’s reign as the top attack vector\nhas been on a steady downward trend for more than a year.\nThe use of Flash to launch exploits has been somewhat\nerratic, with the biggest spike occurring in January 2014. PDF\nuse has been constant, as many malicious actors appear\nto remain focused on launching highly targeted campaigns\nthrough email using PDF attachments. Silverlight attacks,\nwhile still very low in number compared to more established\nvectors, are on the rise—especially since August.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||Log Volume||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n\n\nFlash\n\n\nDec. 2012 Jan. 2014 Sep. 2014\n\n\nSilverlight   228% Java   34% PDF   7% Flash  3%\n\n**Flash and JavaScript: Better Together?**\n\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\nIn 2014, Cisco Security Research observed growth in the use of Flash malware that interacts with JavaScript.\nThe exploit is shared between two different files—one Flash, one JavaScript. Sharing exploits over two different\nfiles and formats makes it more difficult for security devices to identify and block the exploit, and to analyze it\nwith reverse engineering tools. This approach also helps adversaries to be more efficient and effective in their\nattacks. For example, if the first stage of an attack is entirely in JavaScript, then the second stage, the payload\ntransmission, would not occur until after the JavaScript executes successfully. This way, only users who can run\nthe malicious file receive the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Uncovering the Archaeology of Vulnerabilities: The Dangers of Outdated Software—and Why Patching Isn’t the Only Solution\n\nAs explained in the discussion about vulnerabilities (see\npage 8), adversaries take the easiest path available when\ndetermining how and where their exploits will succeed.\nThey choose products that present more attack surface\nopportunities; those opportunities are generally created by\nthe use of unpatched or outdated software. For example,\nappliance patching remains a challenge since there are many\nsystems still vulnerable to the SSL Poodle attack.[5] Based on\nobserved trends, Cisco Security Research suggests that the\nproliferation of outdated versions of exploitable software will\ncontinue to lead to security issues of great magnitude.\n\nFigure 8. OpenSSL Version Age\n\n\nCisco Security Research used scanning engines to examine\ndevices connected to the Internet and using OpenSSL. The\nteam determined that 56 percent of devices surveyed used\nversions of OpenSSL that were more than 50 months old.\nThis means that despite the publicity given to Heartbleed,[6]\nthe security flaw in the handling of Transport Layer Security\n(TLS) discovered in 2014, and the urgent need to upgrade\nto the latest version of OpenSSL software to avoid such\nvulnerabilities, organizations are failing to ensure that they\nare running the latest versions. Figure 8 shows the age of\nOpenSSL versions.\n\nof devices indexed use versions\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\n###### 56%\n\n\n56% of devices indexed use versions\nof OpenSSL more than 50 months old\n\n\n-----\n\n**Possible Solutions: Automatic Updates and Patching**\n\nGreater use of automatic updating may be one solution to\nthe outdated software problem. Cisco Security Research\nexamined data from devices that were connected online and\nusing either the Chrome or IE browser. The data showed\nthat 64 percent of Chrome requests originate from the latest\nversion of that browser. As for IE users, just 10 percent of\nrequests originated from the latest version.\n\nCisco Security Research suggests that the Chrome\nautomated update system may be more successful in\nensuring that as many users as possible have the most recent\nsoftware version. (Also, it’s possible that Chrome users are\nmore technically proficient than IE users and thus, are more\nlikely to update their browsers and install updates.)\n\nWhen combined with the downturn in Java vulnerabilities\nand exploitation, the research clearly indicates that software\nthat automatically installs its own updates seems to have\nan advantage in creating a safer security framework. To\novercome the guaranteed eventual compromise that\nresults from manual update processes, it may be time\nfor organizations to accept the occasional failure and\nincompatibility that automatic updates represent.\n\n###### Industry Vertical Risk Report: Targeting by Adversaries and Users’ Careless Practices Are a Potent Combination for Companies  in High-Risk Verticals\n\nThe pharmaceutical and chemical industry has emerged\nas the number-one high-risk vertical for web malware\nencounters in 2014. For the first half of the year, media\nand publishing held the top spot, but had edged down to\nsecond place by November. Rounding out the top five are\nmanufacturing, transportation and shipping, and aviation,\nrespectively. All of these verticals placed in the top five for\nthe first half of 2014.\n\n\nWhile the retail vertical might be expected to have a higher\nranking on this list given recent high-profile attacks that have\nplagued the industry, it is malicious encounters, and not actual\nbreaches, that are used to create the rankings.\n\nTo determine sector-specific malware encounter rates, Cisco\nSecurity Research compares the median encounter rate for all\norganizations that use Cisco Cloud Web Security to the median\nencounter rate for all companies in a specific sector that are\nusing the service (Figure 9). An industry encounter magnitude\nabove 1 reflects a higher than normal risk of web malware\nencounters, whereas a magnitude below 1 reflects a lower risk.\nFor example, a company with a 1.7 encounter magnitude is\nat a 70 percent increased risk than the median. Conversely, a\ncompany with a 0.7 encounter magnitude is 30 percent below\nthe median risk of encounter.\n\n**Encounter vs. Compromise**\n\nAn “encounter” is an instance when malware is\nblocked. Unlike a “compromise,” a user is not\ninfected during an encounter because a binary is\nnot downloaded.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Vertical Risk of Web Malware Encounters,\nAll Regions, January 1 – November 15, 2014\n\n###### Top 10 (1-5) magnitude\n\n Pharmaceutical and Chemical 4.78\n\n Media and Publishing 3.89\n\n Manufacturing 2.53\n\n Transportation and Shipping 2.08\n\n Aviation 2.01\n\nCisco Security Research examined eight types of attack\nmethods (Figure 10) to determine whether targeting by\nadversaries or how people use the web was the key factor for\nincreasing an industry vertical’s risk for malware encounters.\nThey found a perfect storm, with the combination of targeted\nattack methods and careless user behavior online both having\nan impact on the level of risk.\n\n\nTo determine whether there was in fact a difference between\nhigh- and low-risk vertical user behavior, Cisco Security\nResearch looked at four types of non-targeted attack\nmethods users often encounter when browsing the Internet:\nadware, clickfraud, scam, and iframe injections. The team\nalso looked at four types of more advanced attack methods\nthat adversaries often employ in targeted campaigns: exploit,\nTrojan, OI (detection malware), and downloader.\n\n_Note: The eight attack methods have been categorized by Cisco_\n_Security Research into heuristic buckets._\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Top 10 (1-5)||magn|itude||Top 10 (6-|10)|magn|i|tude|\n|Pharmaceutical|and Chemical|4.78|||Food and Bev|erage|1.68|||\n|Media and Publ|ishing|3.89|||Legal||1.63|||\n|Manufacturing||2.53|||Agriculture an|d Mining|1.51|||\n|Transportation and Shipping||2.08|||Insurance||1.49|||\n|||||||||||\n|||||||||||\n|Aviation||2.01|||Utilities||1.42||earch|\n|||||||Sour|ce: Cisco Security Re|s||\n|||||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Web Malware Attack Methods: Comparison of the Top Four and Bottom Four High-Risk Verticals\n\nExploit Trojan Scam Adware\n\niFrame Injection OI Clickfraud Downloader is 7x greater than the average ratioe (1)\n\n0 1 7\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\nUsing the top and bottom four most malware-exposed\nverticals, according to Cisco Cloud Web Security data, Cisco\nSecurity Research then took the percentage of incidents for\neach type of attack method and created average rates for\nthe top and bottom four verticals. The comparison shown\nin Figure 10 was derived by dividing the top average by\nthe bottom average. A ratio of one indicates that the same\npatterns of activity are observed between the most- and\nleast-targeted groups.\n\nThe data shows that the most high-risk industry verticals\nencounter sophisticated downloader attack methods at a\nfrequency seven times higher than that of the bottom four\nhigh-risk industry verticals. This is consistent with what one\nwould expect if targeted attack methods against the highestrisk verticals were taking place.\n\nThe rate of encounters with clickfraud and adware is also\nhigher in the most-targeted and high-risk industry verticals\ncompared to the less-targeted and lower-risk verticals. This\nsuggests that the difference may be more complex than just\ntargeting by malicious actors. User behavior may also be\n\n\nimplicated in the increased exposure to malware, possibly\nthrough differences in how users engage with the Internet and\ntheir browsing habits, and are therefore contributing to the\nhigher frequency of web malware attack method encounters\nin high-risk industry verticals. Also, users in industries where\nthe quick embrace of new media is encouraged and necessary\nfor competition and innovation are likely encountering web\nmalware attack methods at higher rates than users in other\nindustries, such as government, where Internet use may be\nmore limited and/or strictly controlled.\n\nFor example, Cisco Security Research suggests that because\nusers in the media and publishing industry are typically heavy\nusers of the Internet, they are at risk of encountering web\nexploits more often than users in other industry verticals.\n\n_Note: In 2014, the media and publishing industry experienced_\n_significantly higher than normal rates of web malware encounters_\n_than previously observed by Cisco Security Research, which_\n_has been compiling this data since 2008. Users’ exposure to_\n_more widespread malvertising on legitimate websites could be a_\n_contributing factor to this increase._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11.

The three regions are\ndefined as follows:\n\n- North America, Central America, and Latin America (AMER)\n\n- Asia-Pacific, China, Japan, and India (APJC)\n\n- Africa, Europe, and the Middle East (EMEA)\n\nCisco Security Research identified the highest-risk localized\nindustry verticals (see industries listed in Figure 11) across\nthe world and determined that:\n\n- Users in the insurance industry in APJC are six times more\nlikely to be exposed to malware compared to the 12 verticals\nexamined in all three regions. (Baseline average: 1.5.)\n\n- Users in the aviation industry in AMER are five times more\nlikely to be exposed to malware.\n\n\n\n- Users in the real estate and land management industry in\nAPJC, and users in the automotive industry in that region,\nare both 3.5 times more likely to be exposed to malware.\n\n- Users in the transportation and shipping industry in APJC\nare 3.25 times more likely to be exposed to malware.\n\nCisco Security Research cites skyrocketing land and housing\nprices, recent natural disasters, and heavy export and\nmanufacturing activity in APJC as factors for adversaries\ntargeting users in that region who work in or do business with\nthe automotive, insurance, real estate and land management,\nand transportation and shipping industries. Theft of customer\ndata, intellectual property (including targeting by nation\nstates), and air freight data are likely top motivations for\ntargeting users in the aviation industry in AMER.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attack Methods for Distributing Malware, by Region**\n\nFigures 12a through 12c reveal, by region, the techniques\nadversaries are using most often to distribute malware. The\nfindings in these charts are based primarily on where blocks\nof web malware occurred (that is, encounters), according to\nCisco Cloud Web Security data, versus types of threats on\nthe web.\n\nDuring the year 2014, users in AMER were targeted primarily\nby malicious scripts; iframe injections were a distant second.\nIn APJC, adversaries have been relying heavily on scams,\nmalicious scripts, and web-based exploits over the past year\nto compromise users in all verticals. And in EMEA, web-based\nexploits are especially prevalent.\n\nFigure 12a.

Attackers have become aware\nthat it is often easier to exploit users at the browser and\nemail level, rather than compromising servers—which means\nspammers continue to innovate.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see an anti-spam system catch more\nthan 99 percent of the spam passing through it. Most of the\nbest anti-spam systems catch more than 99.9 percent of\nspam. In this environment, spammers try just about anything to\nevade spam filters. To ensure that spam reaches its intended\naudience, spammers are increasingly using these tactics to\navoid detection by IP-based anti-spam reputation technologies.\n\nEnter snowshoe spam: The comparison is apt because\nsnowshoes allow a person to walk over deep snow by distributing their weight over a larger surface area, thus preventing\nthe wearer’s foot from sinking. Snowshoe spam is unsolicited\nbulk email that is sent using a large number of IP addresses,\nand at a low message volume per IP address, thus preventing\nsome spam systems from sinking the spam. Figure 13\nhighlights the rise in snowshoe spam from 2013 to 2014.\n\nIn a recent snowshoe spam campaign observed by Cisco\nSecurity Research, a blitz approach was used. This means\nthe total spam campaign took place over just three hours, but\nat one point accounted for 10 percent of global spam traffic\n(Figure 14).\n\nTo learn more about snowshoe spam, see the\n[Cisco Security blog post, “Snowshoe Spam](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/snowshoe-flurry)\n[Attack Comes and Goes in a Flurry.”](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/snowshoe-flurry)\n\n\nThe snowshoe messages examined by Cisco researchers\nshow some standard hallmarks of spam. For example, they\nhave misspelled subject lines such as “inovice 2921411.pdf,”\nand include a randomly generated number. Attachments were\ntypically PDF files containing a Trojan exploiting a vulnerability\nin Adobe Reader.\n\nFigure 14. Snowshoe Spam Campaign Incident\n\nAug 15, 2014\n12:00:00-15:45:00\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\nTo mitigate snowshoe spam, security professionals cannot\nsimply rely on solutions that are based on reputation, since the\nsame messages in a campaign can originate from hundreds\nor even thousands of places in the case of botnet-derived\ncampaigns. Examining other hallmarks of spam, such as email\nserver hygiene, can provide more precise detection. In the\ncampaigns observed by Cisco Security Research, for instance,\nmany of the IP addresses lacked matching forward and reverse\ndomain name systems (DNS), which is generally considered an\nobvious indicator that a mail server is not legitimate.\n\nMany of these IP addresses also lacked records of sending\nemails prior to the start of the snowshoe campaign, further\nindicating that online criminals are using compromised\nmachines to create an infrastructure for snowshoe spam.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Spammers Expand Tactics to Outwit Consumers**\n\nWorldwide spam volumes are on the rise, indicating that\nspam is still a lucrative vector for online criminals (Figure 16).\nAdversaries continue to refine messages so that spam is\nmore likely to fool recipients into clicking on dangerous links,\noften using social engineering tactics.\n\nWhile spam volume has generally been on the decline in the\nUnited States in 2014, levels rose in other countries during\nthe same time period (Figure 15). Cisco Security Research\nsuggests that this indicates some malicious actors may be\nshifting their base of operations. The rise in spam volume\nin some countries may also be a sign that other regions are\n\nFigure 16.

Ultimately, the United States ended the year higher.\n\nSpear-phishing messages, a staple of online criminals for\nyears, have evolved to the point where even experienced\nend users have a hard time spotting faked messages among\ntheir authentic emails. These messages, which target specific\nindividuals with a well-crafted message, appear to come from\nwell-known vendors or service providers from whom users\ncommonly receive messages—for example, delivery services,\nonline shopping sites, and music and entertainment providers.\nEmails with a trusted name and a logo, even if spoofed, carry\nmore weight than the old-school spam messages touting\npharmaceuticals or watches. And if the messages have a call\nto action that is familiar to recipients, such as a notice about\na recent order, or a delivery tracking number, users will be\nfurther enticed to click on links contained in the email.\n\nCisco Security Research recently observed a small number of\nspear-phishing messages purporting to originate from Apple\nInc., claiming that the recipients had downloaded a popular\ngame for mobile iOS devices. The email subject line included\na randomly generated receipt number, another seemingly\nauthentic touch, since legitimate emails would usually\ncontain such a number. A link in the message suggested that\nrecipients log in and change their passwords if they had not\ninitiated the game download, and the link redirected the user\nto a known phishing website.\n\n\nOct\n\nJan\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\n\n259 BN/Day\n\nJan\n\n\nApr\n\n\nFeb\n\n\nShare the report\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\nJan\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\n\nOct\n\n\nMar\n\n\n-----\n\n**Spammers Morph Messages to Evade Detection**\n\nWhen spammers find a formula that succeeds—meaning they\nare able to convince users to click on links within spam, or\npurchase fake products—they will tweak messages so that\ntheir basic structure remains the same.

The group\ndiscovered that the threat has strong characteristics that\nresemble the behavior of a botnet. Through the team’s\nresearch, which included the examination of the activity of\nmore than 800,000 users at 70 companies from January\n1 through November 30, 2014, Cisco Security Research\nmeasured the overall size of the threat and corroborated the\nintention and structure.\n\nThe analysis revealed that this family of browser add-ons\nis far more extensive than expected and that the malware\ncreators are using a combination of highly sophisticated,\nprofessionally written code and a refined business model\nto keep their malware in profitable operation for the long\nterm. In other words, full control over the targeted host is\nnot necessary for successful monetization. This leads to\nincreased prevalence of malware deliberately engineered for\nlower impact on the affected host, and optimized for longterm monetization over a large affected population.\n\nCompromised users are infected with these malicious browser\nadd-ons through the installation of bundled software (software\ndistributed with another software package or product) and\nusually without clear user consent. Applications such as PDF\ntools or video players downloaded from untrusted sources\nare installed knowingly by users believing they are legitimate.\n\nFigure 17. Threat Activity and Infection Flow\n\nSoftware Bundles Add-OnAdd-On\n\n\nThe applications can be “bundled” with unwanted and malicious\nsoftware. This approach of distributing malware follows a payper-install (PPI) monetization scheme, in which the publisher\ngets paid for every installation of software bundled in the\noriginal application.\n\nMany users inherently trust add-ons or simply view them as\nbenign, which is why this approach to malware distribution\nis proving successful for malicious actors. This method of\ndistributing malware allows adversaries to decrease their reliance\non other techniques, such as exploit kits, that may be more\ndetectable. (See “Web Exploits: For Exploit Kit Authors, Holding\nthe Top Spot May Not Mean You’re the Best,” page 7.)\n\nCisco Security Research observed that the web traffic\ngenerated by this browser add-on family has specific\ncharacteristics, and can be identified by two well-defined\npatterns. The query string usually contains encoded data, in\nwhich information such as the add-on name and the URL the\nuser previously visited (including intranet links), is exfiltrated.\n\nDuring its analysis, Cisco Security Research found\nmore than 4000 different add-on names, including\nPassShow, Bettersurf, Bettermarkit, and associated SHAs\n(bee4b83970ffa8346f0e791be92555702154348c14bd8\na1048abaf5b3ca049e35167317272539fa0dece3ac1a60\n10c7a936be8cbf70c09e547e0973ef21718e5). Because\nmore than one add-on name may be used per installation,\nthe malware is very difficult to track (Figure 17).\n\nExfiltrates Browsing\nand Other Information\n\nInjects Ads into Contains Additional\nVisited Web Pages Malicious Software\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware Detects OS Types, Serves Up Appropriate Exploits**\n\nCisco security researchers observed that the malicious add-ons they analyzed will display a certain type of\nadvertising depending on the browser “fingerprint” of a user. Injected ads for Linux users were usually about\nonline gaming sites. Users who had Microsoft IE installed were redirected to ads that lead to the download of\nseemingly legitimate software, which actually turns out to be malicious.\n\n**Linux** **Microsoft IE**\n\n\nBased on analysis of 11 months of user activity at 70\ncompanies, the number of users affected by this threat has\nbeen rising. In January, 711 users were affected, but in the\nsecond half of the year the number of affected users went\nabove 1000, with a peak in September, of 1751 (Figure 18).\nOne of the reasons for the significant spike in September and\nOctober could be the increase in online activity, with people\nback to work after summer vacations.\n\nFigure 18. Number of Affected Users Per Month,\nJan. through Nov. 2014\n\n\nThrough research, Cisco security experts learned that\nadversaries are employing several different servers to support\ntheir malware campaigns. This likely means that either one\ncybercriminal organization skilled at keeping its activities\nsegmented is responsible for the threat, or one “technology\nprovider” is selling its product to several groups. Regardless,\nwhoever is responsible for distributing the malware appears to\nbe attempting to create a botnet of substantial size.\n\n|70|Companies|Col3|Col4|1751|Max affect|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||11|Months 886,646 All users|||\n\n\nJan. 2014 Nov. 2014\n\nAffected Users Per Month\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\n-----\n\nCisco Security Research also found more than 500 unique\ndomains associated with this threat; 24 of them are ranked\non Alexa below the top 1 million domains.

This means they\nare popular domains, yet very dangerous for users to visit due\nto the risk of compromise.\n\nSome of the domains have been active for more than a year,\nbut most have a much shorter lifecycle—only a few weeks,\nin many cases (Figure 19).

Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study\n\n###### To gauge perceptions of security professionals on the state of security in their organizations, Cisco asked chief information security officers (CISOs) and security operations (SecOps) managers in several countries and at organizations of different sizes about their security resources and procedures. The Cisco Security Capabilities and Benchmark Study, completed in October 2014, offers insights on the sophistication level of security operations, and security practices currently in use.\n\n Cisco Security Capabilities: How Well Do Organizations Measure Up?\n\nHow do enterprise security professionals view their organizations’ readiness to handle security breaches? The answer\nmay depend on the role they play within an organization, and\nwhich industry they work in, according to the new Cisco\nSecurity Capabilities Benchmark Study.\n\nFigure 20 shows the responses of professionals by industry\nand company size. Non-computer-related manufacturers and\nutility/energy respondents report the highest levels of security\ninvolvement and knowledge.\n\n**N (number of respondents) = 1738**\n\nFigure 20.

The good news from the survey is that a majority\nof security professionals believe they have the tools and\nprocesses in place to maintain security effectively. However,\nCISOs are notably more optimistic than their SecOps\ncolleagues about the state of their security. For example,\n62 percent of CISOs said they strongly agree that security\nprocesses in their organization are clear and well understood,\ncompared to only 48 percent of SecOps managers. CISOs\nalso view their security processes in a more favorable light.\nFifty-nine percent of those surveyed strongly agree that these\nprocesses are optimized, and that they now focus on process\nimprovement, compared to 46 percent of SecOps managers.\n\nWhy the gap in confidence levels? It’s likely due to the fact that\nCISOs are more removed from day-to-day security activities,\nwhereas SecOps staff are working closely to resolve both major\nand minor security incidents. A CISO of a very large organization\nmight not realize that a thousand machines are infected by\nmalware in a typical day, whereas the SecOps manager would\nhave devoted much more time to mitigating the infection, hence\nhis or her less optimistic outlook on organizational security.\n\nIn addition, CISOs may be setting policies, such as blocking\naccess to social media, which give them the illusion of tighter,\nmore impenetrable security defenses. However, by shutting\ndown such channels completely, security teams may lack\nknowledge or experience of the threats that still exist just outside\ntheir networks.\n\nFigure 21. Key Findings by Industry and Job Title\n\n\nAnother gap in confidence appeared when respondents\nwere asked about their confidence in their organizational\nsecurity policies. Both CISOs and SecOps managers show\nhigh levels of confidence in policies (see Figure 21); yet they\nhave less confidence in their abilities to scope and contain\ncompromises (see Figure 28).\n\nA similar gap appeared when respondents were asked about\ntheir security controls: Nearly all respondents said they had\ngood security controls, but about one-quarter perceive their\nsecurity tools to be only “somewhat” rather than “very” or\n“extremely” effective (see Figure 29).\n\nConfidence in security processes and practices also seems\nto vary by industry. CISOs and SecOps managers for utility/\nenergy companies and telecommunications businesses\nseem to be the most confident, while government, financial\nservices, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare organizations\nseem less confident. For instance, 62 percent of\ntelecommunications and utility/energy security executives\nstrongly agree that their security processes are optimized,\ncompared to 50 percent of those working in financial services\nand 52 percent in government.\n\nUtilities/energy and telecommunications security professionals\nseem to be the most sophisticated in their security practices,\nwhile government and financial services organizations seem\nless sophisticated. Utility and energy organizations tend to\nhave well-documented processes and procedures for incident\ntracking. However, this does not necessarily mean they are\nmore secure than organizations in other industries.\n\n\n90% 90% of companies are confident about their 54% However, 54% have had to manage public\nsecurity policies, processes, and procedures scrutiny following a security breach\n\n% Strongly agree that security processes are optimized – now focus on process improvement:\n\n\nUtilities/Energy & Telecommunications\n\n\nGovernment Financial\n\n\n62% 52% 50%\n\nFew differences emerge between enterprise and midmarket organizations, indicating that number of\nemployees alone has little to do with security sophistication.\n\nSource: Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Mapping Sophistication Levels to Current Sample\n\nCisco explored several options for sample segmentation before selecting a five-segment solution based on\na series of questions targeting security processes. The five-segment solution maps fairly closely to the\nCapability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI).\n\nLevel 5: Focus is\nOptimizing on process High\nimprovement\n\nQuantitatively Level 4: Processes\nManaged quantitatively Upper-Middle\nmeasured and\ncontrolled\n\nLevel 3: Processes\nDefined characterized for Middle\nthe organization;\noften proactive\n\nLevel 2: Processes\nRepeatable characterized for Lower-Middle\nprojects; often\nreactive\n\n|Optimizing|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n|Quantitatively Managed|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n|Defined|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n|Repeatable|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\nLevel 1: Processes\nare ad hoc,\nunpredictable\n\n\nLow\n\n|Initial|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Signs of Security Sophistication**\n\nThe Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study also\n\nhighlighted the hallmarks of organizations that are more\n\nsophisticated in their security posture than others. These\n\nhallmarks include:\n\n- Executive leadership that prioritizes security\n\n- Clear, well-documented policies and procedures\n\n- Integrated tools that work together\n\n\nSource: Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study\n\nNinety-one percent of respondents from sophisticated\ncompanies strongly agree that company executives\nconsider security a high priority, while only 22 percent of\nrespondents from the least-sophisticated companies agree\nwith this statement. In addition, 88 percent of respondents\nfrom sophisticated companies strongly agree that security\nprocesses are clear and understood, compared to 0 percent\nof respondents from the least-sophisticated companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. Key Findings on Security Leadership Within Organizations\n\n91% report having an executive with direct responsibility for security\nThis is most often a CISO (29%) or CSO (24%).\n\n\n% Strongly agree that:\n\nSecurity processes are clear and\nwell understood\n\nSecurity processes are optimized and\nnow focus on process improvement\n\nCISOs (and equivalent) are more optimistic than SecOps managers about the state of security in their\ncompanies, perhaps because they’re further from day-to-day realities.\n\nFigure 23 shows that 91 percent of respondents report\nhaving an executive with direct responsibility for security,\nmost often a CISO or a chief security officer (CSO). The\nhigh level of organizations with a security point person is\nencouraging: Without security leadership, processes are less\ndefined, communicated, and enforced. It is likely that recent\nhigh-profile security breaches have spurred on organizations\nto carve out a place for security management in their\nexecutive ranks.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of respondents from more\nsophisticated companies strongly agree that security\ntechnologies are well integrated to work effectively together,\ncompared to 17 percent of respondents from the leastsophisticated companies.\n\n\nSecOps CISO or Equivalent\n\n\n48%\n\n\n46%\n\n\nSource: Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study\n\nThe positive news for organizations hoping to boost the\nsophistication of their security processes is that assembling\na large team of hard-to-find security talent isn’t necessarily\na requirement. In the least-sophisticated organizations, the\nmedian number of security professionals is 32; in those with\nthe highest levels of sophistication, the median number of\nsecurity staff is also 32. Therefore, employing more people\ndoes not seem to directly correlate to better management\nof security processes. A better approach to staffing security\npersonnel would be to find an optimal ratio of security staff to\nthe number of overall employees in the company.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Key Findings on Security Prioritization\n\nSecurity-sophisticated organizations are easily distinguished from less-sophisticated ones ...\n\n\n% Strongly agree that\n\n\nSecurity-Sophisticated Less-Sophisticated\n\n\nCompany executives consider security a high priority 91% 22%\n\n\nSecurity processes are clear and well understood\n\nSecurity technologies are well integrated to\nwork effectively together\n\nHowever, security staff size does not predict sophistication\n\nMedian number of security professionals in\norganization represented in each of the five segments\n\n\n32 49 29 30 32\n\nLow Lower-Mid Middle Upper-Mid High\n\nSource: Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study\n\n\n88%\n\n\n78%\n\n\n17%\n\n\nFigure 24 reveals that less-sophisticated security organizations\ngenerally do not believe that executives consider security a\nhigh priority, nor do they believe that security processes are\nclear and well understood.\n\nIn comparing the security sophistication level of organizations\nby country, there’s more good news: Highly sophisticated\norganizations are the majority in every segment. However,\nrespondents in some countries appear to have a more\npositive view of their own security stance than the outside\nworld does. Overly confident perceptions from respondents\nin some countries may be due in part to core social values\nof a culture, such as the need to present one’s self—and thus,\none’s organization—in a positive light.\n\n\n**Beware of Overconfidence**\n\nWhile CISOs and SecOps managers are showing\nconfidence in their security operations, they also\nindicate that they do not use standard tools that\ncan help thwart security breaches. Less than 50\npercent of respondents use the following tools:\n\n- Identity administration or user provisioning\n\n- Patching and configuration\n\n- Penetration testing\n\n- Endpoint forensics\n\n- Vulnerability scanning\n\n\n-----\n\n**Organization Security Resources**\n\nFigure 25.

However, according to the Cisco\n_Security Capabilities Benchmark Study, larger midmarket_\nenterprises appear to not only mirror enterprises in security\nreadiness in many areas, but often rate even higher than large\norganizations, perhaps due to increased organization flexibility\nand greater agility.\n\nIn fact, according to the study, larger midsize organizations\nare more likely to have highly sophisticated security\npostures. As illustrated in Figure 36, significantly more\n\n\nlarge midsize organizations rate in the upper midlevel and\nhigh level of sophistication than do smaller midmarket\norganizations (250-499 employees) and enterprise\norganizations (1000 or more employees).\n\nThe mostly level playing field for midmarket enterprises is\npromising news, since midmarket companies are the engine\nof the recovering economy.\n\nKey findings from the benchmark survey on midmarket\nenterprises and their security readiness:\n\n- Ninety-two percent of midsize organizations have internal\nincidence response teams, as opposed to 93 percent of\nlarge enterprises.\n\n- Ninety-four percent of midsize organizations have an\nexecutive directly accountable for security, as opposed to\n92 percent of larger enterprises.\n\n\nFigure 36.

Geopolitical and Industry Trends\n\n###### Cisco security, geopolitical, and policy experts identify current and emerging geopolitical trends that organizations, particularly multinational companies, should monitor. These same experts also examine recent and potential developments around the world related to the issues of data sovereignty, data localization, encryption, and data compatibility.\n\n Cybercrime Thriving in  Areas of Weak Governance\n\n\nWhile CISOs and other security leaders may not always think\nto pay close attention to geopolitical dynamics, they should,\nespecially if they work for a multinational organization. What\nhappens in the geopolitical landscape can have a direct impact\non global supply chains, and how the business manages\ncustomer and employee data in different countries; it also can\ncreate more legal and regulatory costs, risk of trade secret\ntheft, and physical and reputational risks.\n\nCybercrime is flourishing around the world, especially in areas\nof weak governance. Eastern Europe, which has long been a\nhotbed of organized crime, is one example. In areas of weak\ngovernance, it is not unusual to find evidence of strong ties\nbetween government intelligence services and organized\ngroups involved in cybercrime.\n\nAccording to U.S. authorities, some recent high-profile attacks\nthat targeted assets in the United States likely originated from\nsuch areas. Some of the attacks appeared not to be profitoriented, but politically motivated campaigns or attempts to\ngather intelligence or infiltrate infrastructure.[7] This could be an\nindication that the campaigns were state-sponsored and/or\norchestrated by sophisticated cybercrime organizations.\n\nMore governments are making a concerted effort to implement\nincreased cyber-governance through legislation and regulation.\nChina, for example, made “rule of law” the theme for the\nfourth plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China (CCP)\nCongress.[8] Beijing has committed to rooting out corruption and\nenforcing laws in business and within government. This effort\nmay strengthen law enforcement and international efforts to\ntrack down cybercriminals and make it harder for them to hide.\n\n\n**Transnational Terrorist Groups Leveraging the Internet**\n\nThe emergence of transnational terrorist groups, such as the\nso-called Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), is another\ngeopolitical trend to watch. While groups like ISIS do not appear\nto be engaged in any significant cybercrime activity, they do\nrely heavily on the Internet—namely, social media—to recruit\nmembers. For now, it appears that leading transnational terrorist\ngroups are making enough money through traditional fundraising\nactivities such as extortion, human trafficking, and oil. But as\nthese organizations grow, they could turn to cybercrime as a way\nto fund their efforts around the world. There is also the potential\nthat budding terrorist organizations that do not have access to\nthe same resources as more established groups may explore\ncybercrime as a fast path to growth.\n\n[See the Cisco blog post “Cupcakes and](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cupcakes-and-cyber-espionage)\n[Cyberespionage,” to read about a suggested new](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cupcakes-and-cyber-espionage)\napproach for defending against cyberespionage.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Conundrum of Data Sovereignty,  Data Localization, and Encryption\n\nEdward Snowden’s allegations about U.S. government\nsurveillance overreach, data sovereignty (the concept that\ndata is subject to the jurisdiction of the country where it is\nlocated and not that of foreign governments or courts that\nmay be seeking unilateral access to it), and data localization\n(a government mandate that data be stored in a certain place)\nhave become hot-button issues.\n\nSome countries are beginning to seek the ability to localize\ntheir data as a way to prevent foreign governments from\ngaining access to their citizens’ data. They are drafting\nrequirements that data remain inside of their country, or be\nrouted in certain ways, and that companies use domestically\nmanufactured equipment.\n\nBrazil, as an example, recently implemented a new law that\n“contains privacy requirements that broadly restrict [covered]\ncompanies from the sharing of users’ personal information,\ntheir communications, and certain online logging data.”[9]\nRussia, meanwhile, recently amended its data protection and\ninformation legislation to require all data operators processing\npersonal data of Russian citizens, including Internet data, to\nkeep copies of such data on servers and databases within\nRussia; the law is slated to go into effect in 2015.[10]\n\nA potential negative consequence of countries mandating\ndata localization—creating legislation that is not interoperable—\nis that multinational companies could be subjected to\nconflicting legal requirements. An obligation to comply with\nthe demands of one nation to produce, retain, or destroy data\ncould violate the laws of another country.\n\nFigure 37. The Conundrum of Balancing Data Sovereignty,\nLocalization, and Encryption\n\n\nAside from potentially causing conflicting legal obligations,\ndata localization requirements also have the potential to\nrestrict the flow of data across borders. This can create\nconfusion, as well as significant challenges in administering\nnetworks. There is a supply chain aspect here as well: More\nglobal supply chain operators are adopting cloud-based\ntechnology to connect all of their partners around the world.\nData localization could hinder, or prevent data exchange in\nthose business networks, and potentially hinder cross-border\nactivities to police cybercrime activity.\n\nAdditionally, as some countries opt to use only homegrown\ntechnologies, or place significant restrictions on who can\nhandle their citizens’ data, there is the potential that they will cut\nthemselves off from the global talent pool and possibly risk a loss\nof innovation that comes from cross-pollination of new ideas.\n\nSome leading technology companies in the United States are\nhoping that use of end-to-end encryption will be a way to\nsatisfy their customers’ concerns that their data be protected\nas it traverses the borderless Internet. The U.S. government\nhas raised concerns, however, that such encryption will\nprevent its ability to protect citizens. The new director of the\nGCHQ, Britain’s premier signals intelligence organization,\nsimilar to the U.S. National Security Agency, even suggested\nthat U.S. social media technology giants are aiding the\nefforts of terrorists by enabling them to send encrypted\ncommunications around the world.[11]\n\nDespite these criticisms, technology companies are likely\nto continue to pursue the development and adoption of\ntechnological measures aimed at restoring customer trust\nuntil governments have adopted policies that more effectively\nreflect the importance of enabling free speech and secure\ncommerce while they protect against threats to public safety\nand national security.\n\nTrust in technology products, and in the companies that develop\nthem, will go a long way toward countries and their governments\nand citizens having confidence that they, and their data, are\nprotected. As Mark Chandler, Cisco senior vice president,\ngeneral counsel, and secretary, noted in a Cisco blog post\nearlier this year, “A serious effort to address these issues can\nbuild confidence, and most importantly, result in the promise of\nthe next generation of the Internet being met, a world in which\nthe connection of people and devices drives greater freedom,\nprosperity, and opportunity for all the world’s citizens.”[12]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Data Privacy Compatibility\n\nA person’s or organization’s attitudes about data privacy\ncan vary greatly depending on where in the world they live\nand work. These varied viewpoints affect how governments\nregulate data privacy, and how enterprises do business when\n[these regulations are at odds with each other. The Data](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/data-protection-heat-index-survey-report/)\n_[Protection Heat Index Survey Report, sponsored by Cisco](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/data-protection-heat-index-survey-report/)_\nand prepared by the Cloud Security Alliance, details some of\nthe challenges faced by enterprises working with data outside\nof their own countries, or data that belongs to individuals\noutside of the country in which the business operates.\n\nThe conversation around data privacy compatibility—that is,\ncreating consistent global approaches to data privacy—has\nbecome more urgent due to the growth of cloud services.\nFor example, if a company based in the United States\npurchases cloud storage from a company in India, and used\nthat cloud to store data for customers residing in Germany,\nwhich region or country’s privacy laws apply?\n\nFigure 38. Meeting Diverse\nRegulatory and Consumer Expectations\n\n\nOther drivers of data privacy compatibility are the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and big data. As enterprises consider new ways\nto connect devices to each other, and use massive datasets\nto make business decisions, they need structure and rules for\nhow this data may be handled on a global scale.\n\nVarious efforts are under way aimed at harmonizing data\nprivacy requirements across a region or group of countries.\nFor example, European Union legislation is currently\nbeing shaped that will update the existing data protection\nframework—the General Data Protection Regulation, calling\nfor a harmonization of data protection regulations. Efforts\nto achieve consensus around data privacy and data\nsovereignty laws are intensifying. Greater harmonization\nwould be welcome, but it is also important that the final text\nis outcome-oriented, interoperates with other regions, and is\nappropriate for the new technology realities. The Asia-Pacific\nregion has developed the Cross-Border Privacy Enforcement\nArrangement from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC), which facilitates data sharing in local economies.\nMore work must be done by governments to meet the\nlarger goal of creating compatible regimes for data privacy\nand security anchored in globally recognized standards that\npromote an open Internet with free flows of data across both\nnational and regional borders.\n\nAs countries and regions clarify their data privacy approaches,\nenterprises will be better able to apply consistent privacy\npractices globally, and implement more effective “privacy\nby design” frameworks, in which privacy capabilities are\nbuilt into products and services right from the start. Clear\nand consistent privacy regulatory frameworks would help\ncompanies meet and exceed privacy requirements, no\nmatter where their offerings are being deployed, thereby\nencouraging innovative product development and use of data.\n\n\nBig Data\n\nInternet of Things\n\nRegulation Cloud Sharing Consumer\nExpectations Expectations\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data Privacy: A Shared Understanding**\n\nThe data protection survey asked global privacy experts in\nNorth America, the European Union, and the Asia-Pacific\nregion about regulation of data in their region, governmental\npractices, user content, and security standards. Responses\nshowed a high level of consistency in respondents’\nunderstanding of the meaning of data privacy, and in the\nvalue of global privacy standards.\n\n- **Data residency and sovereignty: Respondents identified**\npersonal data and personally identifiable information (PII) as\nthe data that is required to remain resident in most countries.\n\n- **Lawful interception: Respondents showed a universal**\ninterpretation of when and how data may be intercepted—for\nexample, when it’s needed for a criminal investigation.\n\n- **User consent: Seventy-three percent of respondents**\nagreed that there should be a consumer privacy bill of rights\nthat is global in nature as opposed to regional. Sixty-five\npercent said that the United Nations should play an active\nrole in the creation of such a bill.\n\n- **Privacy principles: Respondents were asked if privacy**\nprinciples from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\nand Development would facilitate data harmonization, or\nwould instead create greater tension. The data privacy\nexperts surveyed were largely in favor of the adoption of\nthese principles.\n\n\nIn sum, the data privacy survey seems to show that many\nexperts agree on basic privacy principles that, if adopted\nand standardized globally, can be an enabler of business,\nnot an obstacle. The results also indicate that data privacy\nexperts share an interest in “baking in” privacy principles for\nnew technology solutions, instead of trying to retrofit these\nsolutions to accommodate privacy requirements. However,\ncurrent privacy regulatory frameworks are relatively nascent\nand evolving rapidly.\n\nShould a greater level of harmonization advance, companies\nand individuals will benefit. But to the extent that industry\ncontinues to see discordant privacy frameworks globally,\ncompanies will need to think through privacy and data\nprotection issues carefully, and proactively adapt their\nofferings and processes to meet diverse customer and\nregulatory expectations.\n\nTo learn more about data protection issues, see\n[the Cisco Security blog post, “Data Protection](http://blogs.cisco.com/gov/data-protection-in-the-balance-eu-citizen-protection-and-innovation)\n[in the Balance—EU Citizen Protection and](http://blogs.cisco.com/gov/data-protection-in-the-balance-eu-citizen-protection-and-innovation)\n[Innovation.”](http://blogs.cisco.com/gov/data-protection-in-the-balance-eu-citizen-protection-and-innovation)\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4. Changing the View Toward Cybersecurity— From Users to the Corporate Boardroom\n\n###### Cisco security experts suggest that it is time for enterprises to start looking differently at how they approach cybersecurity so they can truly make their organizations more secure. Strategies include considering new approaches to help align people, processes, and technology, making security a topic at the corporate boardroom level, and adopting more sophisticated security controls that can reduce the endpoint and attack surface—and harden the network after an attack.\n\n Secure Access: Understanding Who Is on Your Network, When, and How\n\n\nCISOs and other security professionals are faced with\ncomplex challenges regarding access to network information\nand services. Thanks to the trends toward mobility and\nbring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies, they must ensure\nthat employees can gain access to enterprise resources, no\nmatter where they happen to be, and no matter how they\njoin the network.\n\nSecurity professionals also need to protect the network from\nunapproved users or criminal attacks, and they must do so\nin a way that doesn’t impede access by legitimate users.\nFor example, virtual private networks (VPNs) used to be\nthe standard solution for providing network access control.\nHowever, some VPNs call for complicated login procedures\nby users as well as special software, limiting when and how\npeople join the network. In addition, many VPNs don’t help IT\ndepartments identify who is gaining access and from where,\nnor can VPNs identify the devices in use. VPNs are evolving\nto provide more visibility, while producing a more transparent\nuser experience in order to provide better endpoint security.\n\nNetwork access controls (NACs) are evolving away from basic\nsecurity protection to more sophisticated endpoint visibility,\naccess, and security (EVAS) controls. Unlike older NAC\ntechnologies, EVAS use more granular information to enforce\n\n\naccess policies, such as data about user role, location,\nbusiness process considerations, and risk management. EVAS\ncontrols also help grant access beyond computers, allowing\nnetwork administrators to provide access through mobile and\nIoT devices.\n\nEVAS help enable a network-as-a-sensor approach to\nsecurity enforcement, granting or halting access throughout\nthe extended network, whether from a remote device (VPN),\nprior to connecting to network services, or even within the\nnetwork itself across sensitive resource pools. EVAS can also\nhelp organizations reduce the endpoint and network attack\nsurface, limit the scale and scope of an attack, remediate\nproblem resolution processes, and even harden the network\nafter an attack has occurred.\n\nFor more information about EVAS solutions and\nhow they can help organizations improve security,\n[see the Cisco Security blog post, “New White](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/new-white-paper-from-enterprise-strategy-group-on-the-evolution-of-and-need-for-secure-network-access)\n[Paper from Enterprise Strategy Group on the](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/new-white-paper-from-enterprise-strategy-group-on-the-evolution-of-and-need-for-secure-network-access)\n[Evolution of and Need for Secure Network Access.”](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/new-white-paper-from-enterprise-strategy-group-on-the-evolution-of-and-need-for-secure-network-access)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 39. The Evolution of Network Access Controls (NACs) to Endpoint Visibility, Access, and Security (EVAS) Controls\n\nNetwork Telemetry Device Profile Security and Network\n\nFeed Service Context Data Sharing\n\nWho\n\n\n###### ?\n\n\nWhat\n\nWhere\n\nWhen\n\nHow\n\n\nVPN Client Mobile Switch Router VPN and Firewall DC Switch Wireless Controller\n\n\n**Before an attack, EVAS can:**\n\n- **Identify risky assets. Monitor all assets connected to**\nthe network at any time, identifying non-compliant users,\ndevices, and applications, and correlate this information with\nthird-party vulnerability assessment tools.\n\n- **Improve risk mitigation. Gather actionable intelligence**\nthat can be shared with other security and network\napplications to improve workflows, streamline operations,\nand prioritize remediation activity.\n\n- **Enforce granular network access policies. Provide**\ncontextual information for granular policy enforcement, and\nlimit access to sensitive content, assets, or network segments.\n\n**During an attack, EVAS can:**\n\n- **Integrate with advanced network-based threat defense**\n**systems. Share knowledge when malicious activity is**\ndetected for the purpose of correlating attack data endpoint\nconnections, configurations, and behavior patterns over time.\n\n- **Block “kill chain” tactics from compromised systems.**\nLimit lateral attack movement by stopping compromised\nsystems from reaching out to policy-controlled, nonauthorized network assets to steal credentials, escalate\nprivileges, and exfiltrate valuable data.\n\n- **Limit the scope of an attack. Restrict and thereby**\nquarantine systems that exhibit anomalous behavior.\n\n\n**After an attack is detected, EVAS can:**\n\n- **Assess endpoint profiles for vulnerabilities. Share**\ninformation from the EVAS database with vulnerability\nanalysis tools, which can help IT operations prioritize a fix.\n\n- **Remediate compromised systems. When integrated**\nwith security information and event management (SIEM)\nsystems, and endpoint security systems, EVAS can\nautomate fixes and monitor progress.\n\n- **Fine-tune access policies and security controls.**\nWork with networking and security equipment to segment\napplication traffic or add new firewall rules or IPS signatures.\n\nUnlike overly complex network access controls of the past,\nEVAS solutions are business enablers. As organizations\nembrace BYOD policies, cloud computing, and mobility\ninitiatives, gaining visibility, improving context into connected\nusers and devices, and effectively enforcing security policies\nbecome more imperative. Cisco security experts predict that\nCISOs will increasingly turn to EVAS solutions to manage\nthe complex web of connections among users, devices,\nnetworks, and cloud services.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Future of Cybersecurity Hinges on Boardroom Engagement Today\n\nAccording to the Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark\n_Study, 91 percent of organizations have an executive with_\ndirect responsibility for security. But for modern businesses,\nsecurity leadership needs to ascend even higher in the\norganization: to the boardroom.\n\nRecent, massive data breaches involving well-known\ncompanies, more legislation and regulation related to data\nsecurity, geopolitical dynamics, and shareholder expectations\nare all factors making cybersecurity an agenda item in the\nboardroom. A report by the Information Systems Audit and\nControl Association (ISACA) revealed that 55 percent of\ncorporate directors now have to personally understand and\nmanage cybersecurity as a risk area.[13]\n\nThis is a positive development, but one that Cisco security\nleaders believe is long overdue. In the modern economy,\nevery company runs on IT. That makes security the business\nof every person in the organization, from the chief executive\nto the newest hire, and not just personnel with “security” in\ntheir title or job description. Everyone should be accountable,\nand learn how not to be a victim.\n\nCisco security leaders assert that a core component of the\nfuture of cybersecurity will be greater engagement by the\nboard. Corporate boards of directors across industries need to\nknow what the cybersecurity risks to the business are and their\npotential impact. To truly understand the scope of cybersecurity\nissues that affect the organization, some boards may need to\nadd members with technology and cybersecurity expertise.\n\nBoards also need to start asking tough questions about\nsecurity controls: What controls do we have in place?\n_How well have they been tested? Do we have a reporting_\n_process? How quickly can we detect and remediate the_\n\n\n_inevitable compromise? And perhaps, the most important_\nquestion: What else should we know? CIOs need to be\nprepared to answer those questions from the board, in\nterms that are meaningful to board members, and also\noutline business implications.\n\nIn a recent interview with FORTUNE magazine,[14] Cisco Chief\nSecurity and Trust Officer John Stewart said that the board\nasking these types of questions will help spark “an interesting\nset of downstream effects” that ultimately will lead to the\nsecurity industry maturing. From there, he said, the next vital\nstep—the hope—will be that manufacturers finally recognize\nthat they must build security into their products.\n\nStewart predicts that as the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves,\nand there are more “people-less devices on the Internet than\npeople-with devices” there will be inevitable “accidents” of\npotentially great magnitude. Designing security into products\nwill help to avoid many of these issues, or at least, lessen\ntheir impact.\n\nTherefore, the boards of technology manufacturers should\nask their security leaders: Are we building security into our\n_products? And if not, how soon can we start?_\n\nView the video blog by Cisco Chief Security and\nTrust Officer John Stewart on the importance of\ncybersecurity transparency and accountability\n[to the board: http://blogs.cisco.com/security/](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/ensuring-security-and-trust-stewardship-and-accountability)\n[ensuring-security-and-trust-stewardship-and-](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/ensuring-security-and-trust-stewardship-and-accountability)\n[accountability.](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/ensuring-security-and-trust-stewardship-and-accountability)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco Security Manifesto: Basic Principles for Achieving Real-World Security\n\nToday’s CISOs need to answer hard questions: How do\n_I make my security team the first point of contact for the_\n_business when potential security issues arise? How can I_\n_ensure my team has the tools and visibility to determine what_\n_security issues are most relevant, and require action? And_\n_how do I keep users—the key to business success—safe, and_\n_not just when they are working on-site?_\n\nCisco security experts suggest that CISOs can address these\nquestions by implementing and following a set of security\nprinciples known as the Cisco Security Manifesto.\n\nThis inaugural security manifesto can help security teams,\nand the users in their organizations, to better understand and\nrespond to the cybersecurity challenges of today’s world.\nThese principles can serve as a baseline for organizations\nas they strive to become more dynamic in their approach to\nsecurity, and more adaptive and innovative than adversaries:\n\n**1.** **Security must be considered a growth engine for**\n**the business. Security should never be a roadblock or**\nhassle that undermines user productivity and stands in\nthe way of business innovation. Yet security teams impose\ntechnological solutions that do exactly that. A primary\nreason: They are not invited in time, or at all, to discussions\nabout business projects that require the deployment of\nnew technology. However, security professionals are also\nguilty of waiting for an invitation they may never receive.\nThey instead must take proactive steps to ensure they are\ninvolved in technology conversations, and understand how\nsecurity processes can enable the organization’s agility and\nsuccess, while also protecting its data, assets, and image.\n\n**2. Security must work with existing architecture, and**\n**be usable. Security teams should not have to build an**\narchitecture to accommodate new technology solutions\nthat are meant to improve security. Architectures, by\nnature, are constraining. Organizations should not have\nto change the way they do business to accommodate\nnew security technologies, or be prevented from making\nchanges in how they operate because of the technologies\nthey already have in place. The end result of “architecture\noverload” is that users will circumvent security architecture,\nleaving the organization less secure. In addition, if a security\ntechnology is too difficult for users to understand, and\nmust be maintained by hard-to-find, specialized security\ntalent, it is not useful to the organization.\n\n\n**3. Security must be transparent and informative. Users**\nshould be presented with information that helps them\nunderstand why security is stopping them from taking a\nparticular action. They also need to know how they can do\nwhat they want to do safely, instead of bypassing security\nin the name of doing their jobs. As an example, when a\nuser attempts to access a web page and is met with the\nmessage, “Access to this site has been denied by your\nadministrator,” there is no context as to why they can’t\naccess the page. But if the message said, “Access to this\nsite has been denied because it has served malware in\nthe last 48 hours,” the user would be better informed and\nunderstand the potential risk not only to the organization,\nbut to them, as an individual user. Security technologies\nalso should help users to achieve their goals safely through\nclear recommendations or by directing them to appropriate\nresources for timely assistance.\n\n**4. Security must enable visibility and appropriate action.**\nSecurity solutions with open security architecture enable\nsecurity teams to determine whether those solutions are\ntruly effective. Security professionals also need tools for\nautomating visibility into the network so they not only can\nsee traffic, but also the assets that make up the network.\nBy understanding how security technologies operate, and\nwhat is normal (and not normal) in the IT environment,\nsecurity teams can reduce their administrative workload\nwhile becoming more dynamic and accurate in identifying\nand responding to threats and adapting defenses. In taking\nthis approach, security teams can take full advantage of\nmore relevant and targeted controls to aid in resolution.\n\n**5. Security must be viewed as a “people problem.” A**\ntechnology-centric approach to security does not improve\nsecurity; in fact, it exacerbates it. Technologies are merely\ntools that can enhance the ability of people to secure their\nenvironment. Security teams need to educate users about\nsafe habits that they should apply no matter where they\nare using technology—at the office, at home, on the road—\nso they can make good decisions and feel empowered\nto seek timely assistance when they think something is\nwrong. Improved dialogue between security professionals\nand users will also help users see that technology alone\ncannot assure security. People, processes, and technology,\ntogether, must form the defense against today’s threats.\nCommitment and vigilance by all users in the organization,\nfrom the top down, empower security success.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cisco Security Manifesto is a call for a change. In the\nreal world, security technology, policies, and best practices\nshould raise the average level of security for everyone in the\norganization, and help the business make more informed\nrisk decisions—down to each individual user. And with strong\nprinciples to guide them, users can gain a clear understanding\nof why they are prevented from taking certain actions, and what\nthe impact likely would be if they decide to bypass security.\n\nThe Cisco Security Manifesto, or one that echoes its core\nprinciples, can help both users and security practitioners to\nsee the “big picture” on security: While many threats can\nbe avoided, compromise is inevitable—but remediation can\nbe swift. The goal is to reduce the time to resolution when a\ncompromise is eventually successful, and not focus solely on\ntrying to prevent these events.\n\n## About Cisco\n\nCisco delivers intelligent cybersecurity for the real world,\nproviding one of the industry’s most comprehensive\nadvanced threat protection portfolios of solutions across the\nbroadest set of attack vectors.
