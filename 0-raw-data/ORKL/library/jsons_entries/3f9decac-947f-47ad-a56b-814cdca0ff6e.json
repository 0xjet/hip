We continue to provide the decryptor to customers that request it, and we encourage\nall our customers whose data may have been encrypted during the attack to reach out to\nyour contacts at Kaseya. The decryption tool has proven 100% effective at decrypting files\nthat were fully encrypted in the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nKaseya has maintained our focus on assisting our customers, and when Kaseya obtained\nthe decryptor last week we moved as quickly as possible to safely use the decryptor to help\nour customers recover their encrypted data. Recent reports have suggested that our\ncontinued silence on whether Kaseya paid the ransom may encourage additional\nransomware attacks, but nothing could be further from our goal. While each company must\nmake its own decision on whether to pay the ransom, Kaseya decided after consultation\nwith experts to not negotiate with the criminals who perpetrated this attack and we have not\nwavered from that commitment. As such, we are confirming in no uncertain terms that\nKaseya did not pay a ransom – either directly or indirectly through a third party – to obtain\nthe decryptor.\n\n### July 23, 2021 - 3:00 PM EDT\n\nKaseya’s Incident Response team, assisted by Emsisoft, continues to provide our\ncustomers with the decryption key and help them to restore any encrypted data that was not\npreviously restored from backup. We have no reports of problems or issues with the\ndecryptor.\n\n### July 22, 2021 - 3:30 PM EDT\n\n**Kaseya has obtained universal decryptor key.**\n\nOn 7/21/2021, Kaseya obtained a decryptor for victims of the REvil ransomware attack, and\nwe’re working to remediate customers impacted by the incident.\n\nWe can confirm that Kaseya obtained the tool from a third party and have teams actively\nhelping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments, with no\nreports of any problem or issues associated with the decryptor. Kaseya is working with\n[Emsisoft to support our customer engagement efforts, and Emsisoft has confirmed the key](https://www.emsisoft.com/)\nis effective at unlocking victims.\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring the highest levels of safety for our customers and will\ncontinue to update here as more details become available.\n\nCustomers who have been impacted by the ransomware will be contacted by Kaseya\nrepresentatives.\n\n### July 19, 2021 - 3:15 PM EDT\n\n**VSA 9.5.7.3011 Maintenance Patch Release Update**\n\nKaseya is releasing patch 9.5.7.3011 which remediates functionality issues caused by the\nenhanced security measures put in place and provides bug fixes (this is not a security\nrelease).

Our joint efforts have not identified any new IoCs since\nyesterday and we have deployed our Compromise Detection Tool at hundreds of\ncustomers. At this point, no “False Positives” have been reported by users. [Note: A\n“False Positive” indicates that the Compromise Detection Tool incorrectly classifies a\nsystem as impacted when it wasn’t]\nWe have been actively engaged with FireEye and other security assessment firms to\nassess the manner and impact of the attack to ensure that our R&D organization has\nproperly identified and mitigated the vulnerability.

Due\nto our teams’ fast response, we believe that this has been localized to a very small number\nof on-premises customers only.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the security of our customers is paramount, we are continuing to strongly\n**recommend that our on-premises customers’ VSA servers remain down until further**\n**notice.

ALL ON-PREMISEs VSA SERVERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REMAIN OFFLINE\n\nUNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM KASEYA.\n2. SAAS & HOSTED VSA SERVERS WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ONCE KASEYA\n\nHAS DETERMINED THAT WE CAN SAFELY RESTORE OPERATIONS.\n\n### July 2, 2021 - 10:00 PM EDT\n\nBeginning around mid-day (EDT/US) on Friday July 2, 2021, Kaseya’s Incident Response\nteam learned of a potential security incident involving our VSA software.\n\n**We took swift actions to protect our customers:**\n\nImmediately shut down our SaaS servers as a precautionary measure, even though\nwe had not received any reports of compromise from any SaaS or hosted customers;\nImmediately notified our on-premises customers via email, in-product notices, and\nphone to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from being compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe then followed our established incident response process to determine the scope of the\nincident and the extent that our customers were affected.\n\nWe engaged our internal incident response team and leading industry experts in\nforensic investigations to help us determine the root cause of the issue;\nWe notified law enforcement and government cybersecurity agencies, including the\nFBI and CISA.\n\nWhile our early indicators suggested that only a very small number of on-premises\ncustomers were affected, we took a conservative approach in shutting down the SaaS\nservers to ensure we protected our more than 36,000 customers to the best of our ability.\nWe have received positive feedback from our customers on our rapid and proactive\nresponse.\n\n**While our investigation is ongoing, to date we believe that:**\n\nOur SaaS customers were never at-risk. We expect to restore service to those\ncustomers once we have confirmed that they are not at risk, which we expect will be\nwithin the next 24 hours;\nOnly a very small percentage of our customers were affected – currently estimated at\nfewer than 40 worldwide.\n\nWe believe that we have identified the source of the vulnerability and are preparing a patch\nto mitigate it for our on-premises customers that will be tested thoroughly. We will release\nthat patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running.\n\nI am proud to report that our team had a plan in place to jump into action and executed that\nplan perfectly today. We’ve heard from the vast majority of our customers that they\nexperienced no issues at all, and I am grateful to our internal teams, outside experts, and\nindustry partners who worked alongside of us to quickly bring this to a successful outcome.\n\nToday’s actions are a testament to Kaseya’s unwavering commitment to put our customers\nfirst and provide the highest level of support for our products.\n\nFred Voccola, CEO\nKaseya\n\n\n-----",
