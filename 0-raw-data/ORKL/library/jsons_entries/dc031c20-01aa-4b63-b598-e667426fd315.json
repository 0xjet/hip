As we have noted in our annual security roundup, 2014 was, in fact, the year of PoS malware, with security incidents coming in at least once a month.\n\n We have noted that new variants of PoS malware like Alina emerged as direct evolutions of older PoS RAM scraper families like Backoff. But this doesn’t mean that older PoS malware families have been abandoned. \n\n We noticed that casinos and resort hotels are the most recent victims of an attack that used RawPOS, an old POS malware, to steal customer data. Touted as the earliest of its kind, very little research and documentation exists about RawPOS. As such, we will attempt to give light on this threat that may have been instrumental to previous credit card breaches documented and not previously attributed to this particular PoS threat. Threat DetailsBackground on RawPOS\n\n The earliest reference to RawPOS could be traced back to October 2008, with a Visa Data Security Alert that talks about debugging or parsing memory of point-of-sale systems to extract the full magnetic stripe data from volatile memory. Files of similar note have been mentioned in the following advisories as well:\n\n     - [November 2008: Visa – Malicious Software](http://www.moneris.com/en/Merchant-Support/PCI-Data-Security/~/media/Files/MerchantServices/malicious_software.ashx)\n\n     - May 2009: [First Data / Visa Data Security Alert – Targeted Hospitality Sector](https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/partners/fd_gpm_notice_visa_security_alert_28may09_partnersupport.doc)\n## Vulnerabilities\n\n     - [June 2009: First Data / Discover Data Security Alert - Hospitality Point-of-Sale Breaches](https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/partners/fd_gpm_notice_discover_alert_12june09_partnersupport.pdf)\n\n     - [November 2009: Visa – Targeted Hospitality Sector Vulnerabilities](http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/targeted-hospitality-sector-vulnerabilities-110609.pdf)\n\n## During our research, we also encountered recent articles and advisories that reference details related to this threat. This just shows that references to this PoS threat were made in the past and were well-documented—just not attributed to the malware family. Recent findings include the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n     - September 2014: [CK Systems – Data Compromise at our Managed Services Hosting](http://www.cksystem.com/data-compromise-update/)\n## Facility\n\n     - [February 2015: Discover – Data Security Alert: Retail Data Security Breaches](http://www.monerisusa.com/support/~/media/pdf/Discover%20Alert%20Feb%206%202015.ashx)\n\n     - [March 2015: Visa – ―RAWPOS‖ Malware Targeting Lodging Merchants](http://monerisusa.com/support/~/media/pdf/Alert-RawPOS-032015.ashx)\n\n## It is quite clear that, while RawPOS has been encountered over at least seven years ago, threat actors have been using it repeatedly - with success. Chain of Compromise\n\n The 2008 Visa Data Security Alert contained very important pieces of metadata, which we’ve added a few notes (in red) for clarity.\n\n Table 1. Indicators listed from the October 2008 Visa advisory\n\n\n-----\n\n## While missing one file (lanst.exe, which would be found later), this file listing details a very accurate tool set of attackers that use RawPOS. This simple and short two-page report was really enough to imagine how attackers would’ve penetrated environments of interest.\n\n Figure 1. How a compromise would have happened, with the use of the indicators Design of the Malware\n\n Before we start this section, we’d like to note that there are other indicators surrounding the actual compromise of the environment, including, but not limited to, psexec.exe, far.exe, radminshare.exe, rstopservice.exe, etc. While these are generally good files used for maligned intent, this section is dedicated to the malicious files detected by Trend Micro.\n\n There are generally 3 components of the malware itself.\n\n1. The service used for persistence\n\n## The service is used to maintain access on the compromised system by offering a backdoor by installing itself as a service, and making sure that the memory dumper and the file data scraper are launched.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 2. Service handling functions for persistence\n\n# File samples collected for the service have gone through some obvious code changes as a good majority of them did have the capability to launch the backdoor routine to listen at Port 3373, but were not called. To further study this component, certain code changes to restore this functionality had to be done on the existing file sample and it presented us with a command-line functionality once connected to Port 3373, and it opened in a hard- coded location of c:\\winnt\\system32 – a good indication that this had been designed to be used in an older environment since this path was more popular with Windows NT 4.0/2000.\n\n## Figure 3. What the backdoor functionality would have looked like\n\n\n-----\n\n## To date, there exists another version of the service that had totally removed the backdoor component. This version was first seen used around 2012, and is the version being used to date. \n\n Figure 3. The removed backdoor component of the installed service\n\n The service component is worded very well to look like valid Windows services, with all characteristics about them looking very convincing, though there is some obvious reuse in some cases.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Table 2. Service component made to appear like legitimate Windows services\n\n2. The memory dumper\n\n# This is used to dump the memory of specific processes. Two dumpers were usually used: one generic dumper that can be called to dump a specific process, and another dumper that is designed for specific processes that target specific PoS applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n- The generic dumper, as shown below, can be configured to monitor a specific process to\n## dump the memory to disk.\n\n Figure 5. Options of the generic memory dumper, with the newer example on       \n the right side\n\n The string-wise impression of the file has references to DiabloHorn and KD-Team is visible in the vast majority of the samples collected. However, later examples have changed and stylized some characters on this text, presumably in attempt to evade prior signature detection.\n\n Another observation is that this binary is often time-bound as it is approximately timed not to execute about one month after its compile time. As such, this would ensure that, if the attacker is not able to get back to the environment in time, malicious activity would stop. This would deter most dynamic analysis of the file (i.e., sandbox execution) if run at a later date.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 6. A recent example used, compiled last March 17, 2015\n\n- The process-specific dumper, on the other hand, is derived from the generic dumper\n## where the options listed above no longer apply as it had a hard-coded list of specific processes to look for. Two versions have been observed. The first one version directly wrote the memory to the file, and checked the internally-defined processes every 15 seconds.\n\n Figure 7. The earlier process-specific memory dumper waits for 15 seconds\n\n The latter version, which seems to have started in 2012, is significantly different. After finding the target process, it finds the credit card information via regular expression. The change on this part of the process-specific memory dumper was probably an enhancement to make credit-card data scraping more efficient as the memory dumper would be more specific in matching the data it wanted to dump, and the file data scraper (discussed below) was enhanced to control the timing as to when memory dumper would execute.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 8. A process-specific memory dumper that monitors for utg2.exe component of\n the Shift-4 credit-card processing application\n\n It would seem that there is a builder for the memory dumper itself since the file construction seems consistent across the samples collected. This also gives the first indication of how customized RawPOS is as variations of the memory dumper can be quickly generated. A more detailed list of credit card applications that were targeted by this PoS threat is listed in an upcoming section titled Point-of-Sale Targets.\n\n3. The file data scraper\n\n## The scraper, on the other hand, parses the dumped files from the memory dumper and scrapes the credit card data. The file data scraper is also in charge of encoding the dumped data. File samples surrounding this component are sparing, but the few samples that we do have do give insight on how this PoS threat has evolved.\n\n This first example below had an explicit lifetime as specified by the $dietime variable and, in this case, it was March 6, 2015. This version is quite simple as its sole purpose is to accept a file location and go through the indicated files to look for credit card data within the memory-dumped files. This early example was called by the service component and did not encrypt the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 9. Earlier example of the file data scraper, circa 2008\n\n Another example, as seen below in Figure 10, had taken off from a 2013 modification to include features that we had recently encountered.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 10. More current example file data scraper\n\n This modification was more sensitive to file times and time zone differences, aside from inheriting the encoding of the dumped credit card data with XOR. Furthermore, this version now also controls the execution of the memory dumper in specific configurations, like every five minutes during the day. This version that now calls the memory dumper is what we’ve seen as the latest fork to the 2008 version. In the example above, it is rptsvc32.exe, the name of the memory dumper.\n\n\n-----\n\n## These latter versions now include more verification on the data by comparing the values in the included file D:\\\\Secure\\\\Tools\\\\regex-t.pm. The reference to D:\\\\Secure\\\\Tools\\\\Include\\\\times.pm still maintains the approximate time as to when to run its routines.\n\n Figure 11. Regular expression is used to match credit-card values, and uses a finite\n time to execute\n\n# One of the interesting things about the file data scraper is a direct reference to icverify.lrq, which relates to First Data's ICVERIFY software. Another is the fact that comments on the Perl script is in Code Page (CP866), which is required to support languages in the Cyrillic script. In fact, some lines of the Perl script make implicit references to the Windows-1251 character encoding, and the comments are written in the Russian language. RawPOS Component Evolution\n\n## These three components have gone through extensive reuse over the years.\n\n 2010 and older\n\n Finding files listed at the different advisories released by credit card companies would probably the best reference for this. The earliest year that the files have been catalogued is around 2008, though more could have existed. Both Table 1 and Figure 1 are based on these indicators. This PoS threat, then unnamed, piqued interest in several write-ups, such as this one, that documented how the memory dumper and file data scraper worked.\n\n 2012 – 2013\n\n Seemingly, there was very little activity seen around 2011, in terms of file variations. Newer versions of the files were seen around 2012-2013, and perhaps the only known reference on how it worked was written in 2014 after the Goodwill breach. While still faithful to the three-component modular design, several changes were observed: the service no longer was bundled with the backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n## component, and the file data scraper started to encode (via XOR) the dumped credit card information.\n\n 2014 - 2015\n\n More indicators were gathered during this time. However, the service no longer called the memory dumper directly. Rather, the memory dumper is now being called upon by the file data scraper.\n\n Figure 12. Evolution of the RawPOS components\n\n\n-----\n\n## As seen in Figure 12, the threat actors behind RawPOS has been able to use, reuse and re-engineer RawPOS over time to adapt to the changing times and often times adapting to the target environment.\n\n Methodology\n\n In analyzing RawPOS, we can see that its modular design is highly configurable and has always been a multi-stage scraper. Brought about probably by pioneers in PoS malware threats, the design they chose has now proven to be enduring up to today:\n\n     - The multi-stage or multi-component strategy ensures a high success rate for the chosen\n## environment, while making prevention and detection harder—no matter what type of solution. \n\n     - The threat is still successfully victimizing businesses, and the threat actors behind it\n# are very familiar with how networks within small-to-medium business segments are designed. \n\n     - It is fault-tolerant, persistent and very specific – incident responders and threat\n# investigators may chance upon a specific file that has only been deployed for that specific business.\n\n## This specific PoS threat’s modular design enables the threat actors to tailor-fit the binaries for the target environment, and it would not be unusual to encounter different file hashes of the service, memory dumper, and file data scraper. It should be further noted that, if encountered in an environment, all three components may have been specifically built and compiled for the environment where they are found:\n\n     - The time references found in the memory dumper and the file data scraper would be\n# approximately timed for one month upon initial infection. \n\n     - The memory dumper component would have a hard-coded list of processes to dump\n# that is specific to the target PoS being used by the environment.\n\n## In the aforementioned report from Visa about RawPOS, file hashes were identified and we have mapped these files as part of the attacker’s footprints for lateral movement.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA1** **Original Filename** **Notes**\n44375ddceb7f24a2e92a841e8275218dbb30401f ent.exe Essential NetTools 2.2 (build 51)\n7af9af15a682e353bc5fdf45e68151c23697b124 netdom.exe NetDom 1.8 (Windows domain\nmanager), tool to reset the secure\nchannel between a workstation, server,\nor domain controller.\nb399eaa47b6b1a6431a6ad84430185cfc019221d cmdpause.exe Limits and terminates the number of\n_cmd.exe processes_\n24275065cc31b350752790a486890b0ca1e51a58 cmdpause.exe Limits and terminates the number of\ncmd.exe processes\naf572669accb64e54af626c3a7ef19b01c9edd64 compenum.exe In cmd, enumerates network\nresources/existing connections with\nformat Domain: { from\nWNetEnumResource}\n\nWith argument:\n–createbat, it creates play.bat which\ncontains:\ncall dump.bat \\\\{PC}\nefbc197aa2879f11cf440afc5351496803092755 psex.exe PsExec v1.72\n655b1293f322c862027bed69e8bc22eb4655d79c radminshare.exe Usage: NetShareAdd server.

Files used for lateral movement\n\n There was no command-and-control (C&C) module discovered and we can readily assume that the threat actors went back for the dumped credit card data at a later time, or had used other facilities to extract the data from the environment. After lapsing one month, the malware remnants would usually be left behind.\n\n Point-of-Sale Targets\n\n Trend Micro has observed RawPOS to target casinos, resorts, and luxury hotels in the United States and Canada, with a few in Europe, Middle East and Latin America. This matches the information Visa shared in a security alert in March 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Since different business establishments would have different PoS software, threat actors that employ RawPOS have modified its code to support multiple PoS software over time. We also saw that attackers may have used the generic memory dumper to enhance the process-specific dumper as they encounter it, dropping or adding of specific processes as they learn about newer environments. This prevented repeat work of guessing which process within the PoS software suite to dump that may have the credit card information.\n\n It should be noted that the list in the next page is compiled against what Trend Micro had seen in terms of file samples. While this PoS software listing tries to be as complete based on this file samples we have acquired, RawPOS and its components are highly configurable and we can certainly be sure that RawPOS has been modified to adapt to more PoS software.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Table 4. Supported PoS software\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attackers who employ RawPOS as their means of stealing credit card data may have modified RawPOS according to the target environment. That being said, dealing with RawPOS is not an easy task since the files could have been generated specifically for that environment – the service names may have changed, as well as any file name reference and timed execution events for the memory dumper and file data scraper. Also, the attackers use standard administrative tools (like psexec.exe, far.exe, radminshare.exe, rstopservice.exe, etc.) for lateral movement and data collection.\n\n Trend Micro has released a paper that discusses possible combinations that business may decide to employ for protection against PoS threats. For endpoint monitoring and validation for possibly active infections, Trend Micro Deep Discovery Endpoint Sensor is a context-aware endpoint security monitor that is designed to speed up the discovery, investigation, and can be used to assess endpoints for possible compromise – including the use of the YARA rule shared below.\n\n Indicators\n\n While Trend Micro detects a lot more files
