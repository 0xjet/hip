Our ideas of working from offices, in-person meetings, handson learning and basically everything else was thrown into disarray early in the year. Since\n\n\n-----\n\nthen, we defenders have had to adapt. But so have workers around the globe, and those IT\nand security professionals in charge of keeping those workers’ information secure.\n\nAdversaries saw all these changes as an opportunity to capitalize on strained health care\nsystems, schools scrambling to adapt to online learning and companies who now had\nemployees bringing home sensitive information and data while working on their personal\nnetworks. This led to a huge spike in ransomware attacks and headlines all over of\ncompanies spending millions of dollars to recover their data and get back to work quickly.\n\nOh, and there was a presidential election this year, too, which came with its own set of\nchallenges.\n\nTo recap this crazy year, we’ve compiled a list of the major malware, security news and more\nthat Talos covered this year. Look through the timeline below and click through some of our\nother blog posts to get caught up on the year that was in malware.\n\n**January**\n\nAttackers used several popular and well-known file-hosting services to avoid\n[blocklisting and deliver a threat we called “JhoneRAT,” mainly to Arabic-speaking](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/01/jhonerat.html)\ntargets.\n\n**February**\n\nAnother RAT, “ObliqueRAT,” [used malicious Microsoft Office documents to infect](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/obliquerat-hits-victims-via-maldocs.html)\ndiplomatic and government agencies/organizations in Southeast Asia. Cisco\nTalos also discovered a link between ObliqueRAT and another campaign from\nDecember 2019 distributing CrimsonRAT.\n\n**March**\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, workers across the country and\nglobe had to begin working from home full-time. As the pandemic was the biggest\nnews story of the year, hitting its peak in mid-March, attackers started using news\naround COVID-19 to spread malware.\n[The pandemic also presented a platform for adversaries to spread disinformation](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/covid-19-pandemic-threats.html)\naround the virus and associated government relief packages.\n\n\n-----\n\n**April**\n\n**May**\n\n**June**\n\n**July**\n\n\nCisco Talos researchers highlighted some of the problems with using fingerprint\nscans to protect your devices. We cloned fingerprints using a few different\nmethods and tested their ability to unlock certain devices, showing that you\nshouldn’t use biometric scanners as the last line of defense for vital data or\ndevices.\n[Python-based PoetRAT used COVID-19-themed lures to target government](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/poetrat-covid-19-lures.html)\nagencies and everyday users in Azerbaijan, also capitalizing on the country’s\nongoing military and civil conflicts.\nOnline meeting software exploded in popularity, which created a fresh target for\nattackers looking to spread malware or just generally be disrupted. One such\n[example was this vulnerability in the Zoom meeting software Talos discovered,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/zoom-user-enumeration.html)\nthough there are many more exploits out there for all sorts of meeting software.\n[The Aggah malspam campaign expanded its reach, now delivering Agent Tesla,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/upgraded-aggah-malspam-campaign.html)\nnjRAT and Nanocore RAT.\n\nThai Android devices and users are targeted by a modified version of DenDroid\n[we called \"WolfRAT,\" now targeting messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/05/the-wolf-is-back.html)\nMessenger and Line.\n[Brazilian users are targeted with the Astaroth malware family, which used](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/05/astaroth-analysis.html)\nYouTube as a unique command and control (C2) to help evade detection.\n\n[IndigoDrop utilizes military-themed malicious maldocs to spread Cobalt Strike](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/indigodrop-maldocs-cobalt-strike.html)\nbeacons containing full-fledged RAT capabilities. These maldocs use malicious\nmacros to deliver a multistage and highly modular infection.\nThe PROMETHIUM actor [expands its reach and tries to infect new targets in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/promethium-extends-with-strongpity3.html)\nColombia, India, Canada and Vietnam by teaming up with StrongPity3.\n\nThe wave of ransomware attacks hits a peak. Specifically, WastedLocker targeted\nsome big-name companies and organizations looking to make headlines and rake\nin big paydays.\n[We released our first research paper in a series covering election security and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/07/what-to-expect-when-youre-electing.html)\ndisinformation ahead of the November presidential election.\nThe [Prometei botnet adds multiple ways to spread, deploying a Monero-focused](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/07/prometei-botnet-and-its-quest-for-monero.html)\ncryptocurrency miner.\n\n\n-----\n\n**September**\n\nA new [campaign we dubbed “Salfram” spreads various malware payloads](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/salfram-robbing-place-without-removing.html)\nincluding Gozi ISFB, ZLoader, SmokeLoader and AveMaria, among others.\nWith many students returning to school totally online, we spotted a spike in online\nhomework scams, with sites promising to write papers and complete assignments\nfor a fee, though many of them turned out to be phony or even deliver malware.\n[LodaRAT shows it’s adding new features and obfuscation techniques.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/lodarat-update-alive-and-well.html)\n\n**October**\n\nThe [Lemon Duck cryptocurrency-mining botnet uses several new techniques](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/lemon-duck-brings-cryptocurrency-miners.html)\nlikely to be spotted by defenders but would largely go undetected by end users\nwhile the adversary stole their computing power.\nThe [DoNot APT group experiments with new methods of delivery for their](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/donot-firestarter.html)\npayloads. They used a legitimate service within Google's infrastructure which\nmakes it harder for detection across a user's network.\nThe FBI and U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an\nalert [warning health care systems to look out for a wave of ransomware attacks,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/healthcare-advisory.html)\ncorresponding in a rise in COVID-19 cases.\n\n**November**\n\nA [new version of the CRAT malware pops up in the wild with sandbox evasion](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/11/crat-and-plugins.html)\ntechniques and a new modular plugin framework.\nEmotet [completes its 2020 comeback with a huge November and October,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/11/emotet-2020.html)\nincreasing its activity across the globe after it largely went quiet over the summer.\n\n**December**\n\nWe uncover the [Xanthe cryptocurrency miner after it tried to compromise one of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/12/xanthe-docker-aware-miner.html)\nCisco's security honeypots for tracking Docker-related threats.\n\n\n-----",
