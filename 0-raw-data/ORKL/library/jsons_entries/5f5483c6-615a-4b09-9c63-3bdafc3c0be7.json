This was reportedly based on chatter observed in an online forum that allegedly included members\nof the group behind Ryuk. Cofense Intelligence is conducting an ongoing investigation into this threat. While we\ncan’t evaluate the government’s determination of this threat as credible, we are taking this very seriously and\nhave observed increased activity against the healthcare sector. We assess with high confidence that\nBazarBackdoor is the primary delivery mechanism currently used for Ryuk operations. Moreover, we’ve identified\nthat similar phishing campaigns used to establish a foothold for Ryuk infections have targeted other sectors, as\nwell.\n\n### BazarBackdoor: Ryuk’s Inroad\n\nCofense Intelligence assesses that Ryuk operators typically wait until their preferred delivery mechanism is\nsuccessfully deployed to an intended target prior to deploying Ryuk ransomware itself. Up until TrickBot’s\ndisruption, Ryuk was most frequently delivered via TrickBot. However, our analysis indicates that the group\nbehind Ryuk began leveraging BazarBackdoor to establish access to target systems in September. This aligns\nclosely with announcements that U.S. Cyber Command had taken action to disrupt TrickBot operations. In recent\nweeks, we assess with high confidence that BazarBackdoor has been Ryuk’s most predominant loader. With\nlower confidence, we assess this wave of Ryuk activity may be, in part, in retaliation for September’s TrickBot\ndisruptions.\n\nBazarBackdoor is a stealthy malware downloader that we assess is used by the same group as TrickBot.\nTypically, emails designed to appear as internal business communications are sent to victims within an\norganization, often with relevant employee names or positions. These emails usually contain a link, most often to\na Google Docs page, though other well-known file hosting platforms have also been used. The Google Docs\npage will then present a convincing image with another embedded link. This link is typically to a malicious\nexecutable hosted on a trusted platform such as Amazon AWS. This chain of legitimate services makes it difficult\nto detect and stop these campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce in place on a victim s computer, BazarBackdoor uses specialized network communications to avoid\ndetection and to contact its command and control (C2) locations. Part of these communications involve DNS\nlookups for .bazar domains, which is the reason behind its Bazar name. These C2 locations also often serve as\npayload locations. After BazarBackdoor contacts its C2 center it will then collect additional information which the\nthreat actors can use to deliver customized reconnaissance tools, such as Cobalt Strike payloads. The threat\nactors can also choose to deliver other payloads such as Ryuk ransomware. The deployment of Ryuk\nransomware isn’t automated, and therefore won’t occur unless the threat actors decide the infected environment\nis a target.\n\nAll of us should pay special heed to any indications of BazarBackdoor compromise. Regardless of whether recent\nactivity is in retaliation against TrickBot’s disruption, what is clear is that recent efforts by multiple parties to\ncripple TrickBot seem to have been effective in transitioning the Ryuk actors to leveraging BazarBackdoor. We\nmust be mindful that there are past connections between TrickBot activity and Emotet. While there is no direct\nevidence of current Emotet involvement in these campaigns, we cannot rule out future delivery of Ryuk via\nEmotet, given historical relationships between TrickBot and Emotet. As the TrickBot infrastructure appears to be\nin the process of restructuring, we assess that it may find use again as a delivery mechanism. As a network\ndefender, all three malware families should be prioritized when searching for possible compromises, with the\nhighest priority placed on detections of BazarBackdoor in the near future.\n\n_Figure 1: Common Phishing Example Delivering BazarBackdoor_\n\n### The Phish\n\nCofense Intelligence has directly identified several campaigns, targeting multiple sectors across our customer\nbase, that share strong similarities to the phishing emails reportedly used as initial attack vectors in Ryuk\ncampaigns, as outlined by FireEye. Two subject themes stand out across several industry verticals we’ve\nconfirmed were targets of BazarBackdoor. These subjects relate A) to employment termination, almost always\nincluding the word “termination,” or B) to payroll, almost always including the word “debit,” as shown in Figure 1.\nWhile the subjects remain the same, we observed two separate download services: via Google Docs or Constant\nContact. The following list highlights the different industries we have confirmed were targeted by such campaigns.\nHowever, we cannot assess whether Ryuk operators intended to further infect these targets with Ryuk\nransomware. It appears very likely that Ryuk operators have cast a wide net for potential infection vectors, and\nchoose which successful footholds to manually interact with and leverage.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Termination List Phishing Example Delivering BazarBackdoor_\n\nIt is worth noting that these campaigns began in mid-September, which corresponds with the timing of\ncoordinated offensive operations to disrupt TrickBot. The sectors we have directly observed targeted in these\ncampaigns include:\n\nConsumer Goods\nHealthcare\nMining\nEnergy\nInsurance\nProfessional Services\nFinancial Services\nManufacturing\nRetail\n\n### Assessing the Threat\n\nAs of early this morning, on October 30, there are reports of some ransomware attacks against U.S. healthcare\norganizations yesterday. It is possible more reports will emerge in the coming days, though initial indications\nsuggest a healthcare sector doomsday was avoided. In recent weeks, there was an abundance of ransomware\nactivity against the healthcare sector, and we identified an increase in BazarBackdoor targeting. It’s not for us to\nsay whether the stated time or scope of the threat was off base, if there have been active successful\ncountermeasures, or that the flurry of reporting has deterred some ransomware activity for now. It is possible they\ndid/do not want to face such a well-guarded and prepared target base. Still, we are confident that Ryuk\noperations have recently increased, and that other sectors have come into the crosshairs of potential future Ryuk\noperations. It’s our assessment that the threat should be taken seriously.\n\nCofense Intelligence customers have received relevant indicators of compromise (IOCs) and Active Threat\nReports (ATRs) as these campaigns are identified and analyzed, and some of these ATRs were first sent in\nSeptember. Customers can find these ATRs and IOCs in ThreatHQ and via our API, and can access the most up\nto date list of all relevant Cofense Intelligence IOCs and ATRs tied to BazarBackdoor, TrickBot and Emotet via\nour API and on ThreatHQ\n\n\n-----\n\nFor all readers, below is a table of relevant IOCs and Yara Rules associated with BazarBackdoor that can help\n[your organization identify related emails should you be targeted.
