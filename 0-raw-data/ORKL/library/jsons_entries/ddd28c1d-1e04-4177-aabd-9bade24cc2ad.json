Personnel and their potential lack of cyber awareness are a vulnerability\nwithin an organization. Personnel may open malicious attachments or links to execute\nmalicious payloads contained in emails from threat actors that have successfully\nbypassed email filtering controls.\no When organizations integrate IT with OT systems, attackers can gain access—either\npurposefully or inadvertently—to OT assets after the IT network has been\ncompromised through spearphishing and other techniques.\no Exploitation of internet-connected services and applications that enable remote access\nto WWS networks [T1210].\no For example, threat actors can exploit a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that is\ninsecurely connected to the internet to infect a network with ransomware. If the RDP is\nused for process control equipment, the attacker could also compromise WWS\noperations. Note: the increased use of remote operations due to the COVID-19\npandemic has likely increased the prevalence of weaknesses associated with remote\naccess.\nExploitation of unsupported or outdated operating systems and software.\no Threat actors likely seek to take advantage of perceived weaknesses among\norganizations that either do not have—or choose not to prioritize—resources for IT/OT\ninfrastructure modernization. WWS facilities tend to allocate resources to physical\ninfrastructure in need of replacement or repair (e.g., pipes) rather than IT/OT\ninfrastructure.\no The fact that WWS facilities are inconsistently resourced municipal systems—not all of\nwhich have the resources to employ consistently high cybersecurity standards—may\ncontribute to the use of unsupported or outdated operating systems and software.\nExploitation of control system devices with vulnerable firmware versions.\no WWS systems commonly use outdated control system devices or firmware versions,\nwhich expose WWS networks to publicly accessible and remotely executable\nvulnerabilities. Successful compromise of these devices may lead to loss of system\ncontrol, denial of service, or loss of sensitive data [T0827].\n\nWWS Sector Cyber Intrusions\nCyber intrusions targeting U.S. WWS facilities highlight vulnerabilities associated with the following\nthreats:\n•\n•\n\nInsider threats from current or former employees who maintain improperly active credentials\nRansomware attacks\n\nPage 2 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-287A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | EPA | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nWWS Sector cyber intrusions from 2019 to early 2021 include:\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nIn August 2021, malicious cyber actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a Californiabased WWS facility. The ransomware variant had been in the system for about a month and\nwas discovered when three supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers\ndisplayed a ransomware message.\nIn July 2021, cyber actors used remote access to introduce ZuCaNo ransomware onto a\nMaine-based WWS facility’s wastewater SCADA computer. The treatment system was run\nmanually until the SCADA computer was restored using local control and more frequent\noperator rounds.\nIn March 2021, cyber actors used an unknown ransomware variant against a Nevada-based\nWWS facility. The ransomware affected the victim’s SCADA system and backup systems. The\nSCADA system provides visibility and monitoring but is not a full industrial control system\n(ICS).\nIn September 2020, personnel at a New Jersey-based WWS facility discovered—what they\nbelieved to be—Makop ransomware had compromised files within their system.\nIn March 2019, a former employee at Kansas-based WWS facility unsuccessfully attempted to\nthreaten drinking water safety by using his user credentials, which had not been revoked at\nthe time of his resignation, to remotely access a facility computer.\n\nRECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS\nThe FBI, CISA, EPA, and NSA recommend WWS facilities—including DoD water treatment facilities\nin the United States and abroad—use a risk-informed analysis to determine the applicability of a\nrange of technical and non-technical mitigations to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.\n\nWWS Monitoring\nPersonnel responsible for monitoring WWS should check for the following suspicious activities and\nindicators, which may be indicative of threat actor activity:\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nInability of WWS facility personnel to access SCADA system controls at any time, either\nentirely or in part;\nUnfamiliar data windows or system alerts appearing on SCADA system controls and facility\ndata screens that could indicate a ransomware attack;\nDetection by SCADA system controls, or by water treatment personnel, of abnormal operating\nparameters—such as unusually high chemical addition rates—used in the safe and proper\ntreatment of drinking water;\nAccess of SCADA systems by unauthorized individuals or groups, e.g., former employees and\ncurrent employees not authorized/assigned to operate SCADA systems and controls.\nAccess of SCADA systems at unusual times, which may indicate that a legitimate user’s\ncredentials have been compromised.\nUnexplained SCADA system restarts.\nUnchanging parameter values that normally fluctuate.\n\nPage 3 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-287A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | EPA | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nRemote Access Mitigations\nNote: The increased use of remote operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic increases the\nnecessity for asset owner-operators to assess the risk associated with enhanced remote access to\nensure it falls within acceptable levels.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication for all remote access to the OT network, including from the\nIT network and external networks.\nUtilize blocklisting and allowlisting to limit remote access to users with a verified business\nand/or operational need.\nEnsure that all remote access technologies have logging enabled and regularly audit these\nlogs to identify instances of unauthorized access.\nUtilize manual start and stop features in place of always activated unattended access to\nreduce the time remote access services are running.\nAudit networks for systems using remote access services.\no Close unneeded network ports associated with remote access services (e.g., RDP –\nTransmission Control Protocol [TCP] Port 3389).\nWhen configuring access control for a host, utilize custom settings to limit the access a remote\nparty can attempt to acquire.\n\nNetwork Mitigations\n•\n\n•\n\nImplement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT networks to limit the\nability of malicious cyber actors to pivot to the OT network after compromising the IT network.\no Implement demilitarized zones (DMZs), firewalls, jump servers, and one-way\ncommunication diodes to prevent unregulated communication between the IT and OT\nnetworks.\nDevelop/update network maps to ensure a full accounting of all equipment that is connected to\nthe network.\no Remove any equipment from networks that is not required to conduct operations to\nreduce the attack surface malicious actors can exploit.\n\nPlanning and Operational Mitigations\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nEnsure the organization’s emergency response plan considers the full range of potential\nimpacts that cyberattacks pose to operations, including loss or manipulation of view, loss or\nmanipulation of control, and threats to safety.\no The plan should also consider third parties with legitimate need for OT network access,\nincluding engineers and vendors.\no Review, test, and update the emergency response plan on an annual basis to ensure\naccuracy.\nExercise the ability to fail over to alternate control systems, including manual operation while\nassuming degraded electronic communications.\nAllow employees to gain decision-making experience via tabletop exercises that incorporate\nloss of visibility and control scenarios. Utilize resources such as the Environment Protection\n\nPage 4 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-287A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | EPA | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nAgency’s (EPA) Cybersecurity Incident Action Checklist as well as the Ransomware\nResponse Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center\n(MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\n\nSafety System Mitigations\n•\n\nInstall independent cyber-physical safety systems. These are systems that physically prevent\ndangerous conditions from occurring if the control system is compromised by a threat actor.\no Examples of cyber-physical safety system controls include:\n Size of the chemical feed pump\n Gearing on valves\n Pressure switches, etc.\no These types of controls benefit WWS Sector facilities—especially smaller facilities with\nlimited cybersecurity capability—because they enable facility staff to assess systems\nfrom a worst-case scenario and determine protective solutions. Enabling cyberphysical safety systems allows operators to take physical steps to limit the damage, for\nexample, by preventing cyber actors, who have gained control of a sodium hydroxide\npump, from raising the pH to dangerous levels.\n\nAdditional Mitigations\n•\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nFoster an organizational culture of cyber readiness. See the CISA Cyber Essentials along with\nthe items listed in the Resources section below for guidance.\nUpdate software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network\nassets. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network assets and\nzones should participate in the patch management program. Consider using a centralized\npatch management system.\nSet antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using up-todate signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network\nassets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\nImplement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks.\no Regularly test backups.\no Ensure backups are not connected to the network to prevent the potential spread of\nransomware to the backups.\nWhen possible, enable OT device authentication, utilize the encrypted version of OT\nprotocols, and encrypt all wireless communications to ensure the confidentiality and\nauthenticity of process control data in transit.\nEmploy user account management to:\no Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible.\no Implement account lockout policies to reduce risk from brute-force attacks.\no Monitor the creation of administrator-level accounts by third-party vendors with robust\nand privileged account management policies and procedures.\no Implement a user account policy that includes set durations for deactivation and\nremoval of accounts after employees leave the organization or after accounts reach a\ndefined period of inactivity.\n\nPage 5 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-287A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | EPA | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n\n•\n\nImplement data execution prevention controls, such as application allowlisting and software\nrestriction policies that prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations,\nsuch as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers.\nTrain users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and social\nengineering attempts. Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.\n\nFBI, CISA, EPA, and NSA would like to thank Dragos as well as the WaterISAC for their contributions\nto this advisory.\n\nRESOURCES\nCyber Hygiene Services\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services—including vulnerability scanning and\nransomware readiness assessments—to help critical infrastructure organizations assess, identify, and\nreduce their exposure to cyber threats. By taking advantage of these services, organizations of any\nsize will receive recommendations on ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack vectors.\n\nRewards for Justice Reporting\nThe U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program offers a reward of up to $10\nmillion for reports of foreign government malicious activity against U.S. critical infrastructure. See the\nRFJ website for more information and how to report information securely.\n\nStopRansomware.gov\nThe StopRansomware.gov webpage is an interagency resource that provides guidance on\nransomware protection, detection, and response. This includes ransomware alerts, reports, and\nresources from CISA and other federal partners, including:\n•\n•\n•\n\nCISA and MS-ISAC: Joint Ransomware Guide\nCISA Insights: Ransomware Outbreak\nCISA Webinar: Combating Ransomware\n\nAdditional Resources\nFor additional resources that can assist in preventing and mitigating this activity, see:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nFBI-CISA-EPA-MS-ISAC Joint CSA: Compromise of U.S. Water Treatment Facility\nWaterISAC: 15 Cybersecurity Fundamentals for Water and Wastewater Utilities\nAmerican Water Works Association: Cybersecurity Guidance and Assessment Tool\nEPA: Cybersecurity Incident Action Checklist\nEPA: Cybersecurity Best Practices for the Water Sector\nEPA: Supporting Cybersecurity Measures with the Clean Water and Drinking Water State\nRevolving Funds\nCISA: Cyber Risks & Resources for the Water and Wastewater Systems Sector infographic\nCISA: Critical ICS Cybersecurity Performance Goals and Objectives\n\nPage 6 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-287A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | EPA | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nCISA Fact Sheet: Rising Ransomware Threat to Operational Technology Assets\nCISA-MS-ISAC: Joint Ransomware Guide\nNSA CSA: Stop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected OT\nCISA: Insider Threat Mitigation Resources\nNIST: Special Publication (SP) 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting\nNIST: SP 800-82 Rev. 2, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security (Section 6.2.1)\n\nDISCLAIMER OF ENDORSEMENT\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any\nwarranties or guarantees.
