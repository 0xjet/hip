It is\nnot known exactly how this variant is being distributed, but in the past Crysis was typically\nspread by hacking into Remote Desktop Services and manually installing the ransomware.\n\nWhen this ransomware is installed, it will scan the computer for certain file types and encrypt\nthem. When encrypting a file it will append an extension in the format of .id-[id].\n\n[email].arena. For example, a file called test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed\nto test.jpg.id-BCBEF350.[chivas@aolonline.top].arena.\n\nIt should be noted that this ransomware will encrypt mapped network drives and unmapped\nnetwork shares. So it is important to make sure your network's shares are locked down so\nthat only those who actually need access have permission.\n\nYou can see an example of an encrypted folder below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Files encrypted with the Crysis Arena Ransomware Variant**\n\nWhile encrypting a computer it will also remove all of the shadow volume copies so that you\ncannot use them to restore your files. It deletes them by running the vssadmin delete\n**shadows /all /quiet command.**\n\nThe Arena Crysis variant will also create two ransom notes. One is the info.hta file, which is\nlaunched by an autorun.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Crysis Arena Ransom Note**\n\nThe other note is called FILES ENCRYPTED.txt.\n\n**FILES Encrypted Ransom Note**\n\nBoth of these ransom notes contain instructions to contact chivas@aolonline.top in order\nto get payment instructions.\n\nFinally, the ransomware will configure itself to automatically start when you login to\nWindows. This allows it to encrypt new files that are created since it was last executed.\n\n## It is not possible to decrypt the Crysis Arena Ransomware Variant\n\nUnfortunately, at this time it is not possible to decrypt .arena files encrypted by the Crysis\nRansomware for free.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe only way to recover encrypted files is via a backup, or if you are incredibly lucky, through\nShadow Volume Copies. Though Crysis does attempt to remove Shadow Volume Copies, in\nrare cases ransomware infections fail to do so for whatever reason. Due to this, if you do not\nhave a viable backup, I always suggest people try as a last resort to restore encrypted files\nfrom Shadow Volume Copies as well.\n\nFor those who wish to discuss the Crysis ransomware or need support, you can use our\n[dedicated Crysis Ransomware Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/607680/crysis-extensionid-numberemailarenacrysis-ransomware-support-topic/)\n\n## How to protect yourself from the Crysis Ransomware\n\nIn order to protect yourself from Crysis, or from any ransomware, it is important that you use\ngood computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a\nreliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such\nas a ransomware attack.\n\nYou should also have security software that contains behavioral detections such as Emsisoft\nAnti-Malware or [Malwarebytes.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following good online security habits, which in\nmany cases are the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\nScan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.\nTherefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\nIf you are using Remote Desktop Services, do not connect it directly to the Internet.\nInstead make it accessibly only via a VPN.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Indian airline SpiceJet's flights impacted by ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/indian-airline-spicejets-flights-impacted-by-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hash:\n```\nARENA SHA256: a683494fc0d017fd3b4638f8b84caaaac145cc28bc211bd7361723368b4bb21e\n\n Arena Crysis Ransomware FILES ENCRYPTED.TXT Ransom Note:\nall your data has been locked us\nYou want to return?\nwrite email chivas@aolonline.top\n\n Arena Crysis Ransomware INFO.hta Ransom Note:\nAll your files have been encrypted!\nAll your files have been encrypted due to a security problem with your PC.

They will send me the decryptor program and\nkeys if I agree to write an endorsement here if successful. Their justification was the\nprevious person was fired for being untrustworthy.

I have sent the Key File to\nSCONOR3@aol.com and will report back if a SCONOR3@aol.com returns the\ndecrypting key and all files are unlocked. Please be patient and do not pay your bitcoins\nuntil you hear back from me regarding success.\n\n[Gski - 4 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1070777/gski/)\n\nI am sorry to report that 15 hours after sending the program generated key I still have\nnot received the unlock key. Waiting to see if the new management will keep their\npromises.

I was under the impression that SCONOR3@aol.com was under a new\nperson that could be trusted. It does not appear that you will have any success with\nSCONOR3@aol.com.

Their justification was - all my letters were in the spam.\nI think it happened because I wrote on the web that they do not fulfill their obligations.\nIt worked with them - they even asked to edit the message.\nObviously [restorefile@india.com] take care of their reputation.\n\n[klyxmaster - 4 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1074077/klyxmaster/)\n\nCan you post or upload what you have to so others may benifit?

Netflix, google, utility co. banks, phone co. etc.. major search\nengines etc.. are not gonna ransom your system.\nWith that said, these guys are bad guys (watch TV to better understand what a bad guy\nis). they have NO INTENTION OF HELPING YOU! They prey on the idiots that pay\nthem. They don't care about those that are smart and know better. If you were smart\nyou would have had a back up anyways of your \"important\" media (seriously, who\ndoesn't back up their family pics, legal and business documents AND use that machine\nto surf the unprotected web). I had 16TB of data locked up. I just wiped all the drives\nand started from clean drives - why? I had all my good stuff backed up(stuff from 1992\nyeowch!) - the rest of the stuff is replaceable over time.\nSo for those that feel the need to fork out money WASTEFULLY: PAY ME!! I need some\nwork on my truck, and would like to start a down payment on a new houseand dump\nthe condo scene (AND for those that have money to burn, pay me more - I would like to\nstart a pc education biz for conducting internet safety and security LOL), . What do you\nget for paying me? same thing you get from these thieves: NOTHING. Just the peace of\nmind that it went to a good cause.\n\n\n-----\n\n[caciavar - 4 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1077831/caciavar/)\n\nI agree with you. More diligence needs to be taken with backing up sensitive data and\nrevisiting backup strategies periodically.\n\nOne thing I should mention though is that the cause of this infection in most cases is\nnot due to careless internet browsing, downloading torrents, porn or suspicious sites.\nThis occurs when a hacker breaches port 3389 for remote desktop and logs into the\ntarget system to inflict the damage. The solution is better security practices such as\nhardening firewalls and using remote desktop over VPN.\n\nIn my case, port 3389 was forwarded to a desktop on my parent's network and the\nhacker exploited that security hole. It was my fault... I opened the back door to perform\nsome VPN maintenance remotely, and forgot to close it when I was finished. I feel\nawful, but it's something I'll never do again.\n\n\n-----\n\n[klyxmaster - 4 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1074077/klyxmaster/)\n\nI retract the porn,torrent and other subjective media:\n\nI \"sorta agree\", The only way for that port (or ANY port) to be exploited, is that it has to\nbe forewarded - unless you are some super wanted politician, movie(**cough**)star or\nsome other person of interest, and then you would be targeted. However, that does not\nseem to be the case here.\n\nI run many game server, and host my own web server. Never really ran into any issue so\nto speak.\n\nAs you already admitted - you forwarded port 3389* - Many others I have dealt with,\ndon't have a single port forwarded( or even know how to do it) outside some gaming\nports for online gaming. But for the most part, those are pretty protected anyways. 9\nalready open and ripe for the picking? Random \"port sniffing\" might be the cause.\n\nBut I agree with you on the 3389, I forgot to turn mine off that night. I was hopping\nback and forth for some data, and just too lazy to shut it off. not too surprisingly, BAM!\nnext morning system was running HORRIBLY slow. Takes awhile to lock up 16tb LOL.\nI was able to shut the system off before it killed my windows, but the damage was done.\nRestore took FOREVER!\n\n[Post a Comment Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
