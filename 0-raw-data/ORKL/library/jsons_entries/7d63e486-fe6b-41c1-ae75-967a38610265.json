The attackers gained initial access via\n[a misconfigured kubelet that allowed anonymous access. Once getting a foothold into a Kubernetes cluster, the malware attempted to spread](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#:~:text=Synopsis,object%20that%20describes%20a%20pod.)\nover as many containers as possible and eventually launched cryptojacking operations. Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures\n[(TTP) that the attackers used, we believe this is a new campaign from TeamTNT. We refer to this new malware as Hildegard, the username](https://www.cadosecurity.com/post/team-tnt-the-first-crypto-mining-worm-to-steal-aws-credentials)\nof the tmate account that the malware used.\n\nTeamTNT is known for exploiting unsecured Docker daemons and deploying malicious container images, as documented in previous research\n[(Cetus,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cetus-cryptojacking-worm/) [Black-T and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/black-t-cryptojacking-variant/) [TeamTNT DDoS). However, this is the first time we found TeamTNT targeting Kubernetes environments. In addition to the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/teamtnt-now-deploying-ddos-capable-irc-bot-tntbotinger.html)\nsame tools and domains identified in TeamTNT's previous campaigns, this new malware carries multiple new capabilities that make it more\nstealthy and persistent. In particular, we found that TeamTNT’s Hildegard malware:\n\n[Uses two ways to establish command and control (C2) connections: a tmate reverse shell and an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel.](https://tmate.io/)\nUses a known Linux process name (bioset) to disguise the malicious process.\n[Uses a library injection technique based on LD_PRELOAD to hide the malicious processes.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)\nEncrypts the malicious payload inside a binary to make automated static analysis more difficult.\n\nWe believe that this new malware campaign is still under development due to its seemingly incomplete codebase and infrastructure. At the\ntime of writing, most of Hildegard's infrastructure has been online for only a month. The C2 domain borg[.]wtf was registered on Dec. 24, 2020,\nthe IRC server went online on Jan. 9, 2021, and some malicious scripts have been updated frequently. The malware campaign has ~25.05\nKH/s hashing power, and there is 11 XMR (~$1,500) in the wallet.\n\n**There has not been any activity since our initial detection, which indicates the threat campaign may still be in the reconnaissance**\n**and weaponization stage. However, knowing this malware's capabilities and target environments, we have good reason to believe that the**\ngroup will soon launch a larger-scale attack. The malware can leverage the abundant computing resources in Kubernetes environments for\ncryptojacking and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from tens to thousands of applications running in the clusters.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from this threat by the Runtime Protection feature, Cryptominer Detection](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nfeature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance Protection, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes configuration and\nprovides secure alternatives.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.\n\nAttacker and malware’s movement.\n\n## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\nFigure 1 illustrates how the attacker entered, moved laterally and eventually performed cryptojacking in multiple containers.\n\n1. The attacker started by exploiting an unsecured Kubelet on the internet and searched for containers running inside the Kubernetes\n\nnodes. After finding container 1 in Node A, the attacker attempted to perform remote code execution (RCE) in container 1.\n[2. The attacker downloaded tmate and issued a command to run it and establish a reverse shell to tmate.io from container 1. The attacker](https://tmate.io/)\n\nthen continued the attack with this tmate session.\n[3. From container 1, the attacker used masscan to scan Kubernetes's internal network and found unsecured Kubelets in Node B and Node](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)\n\nC. The attacker then attempted to deploy a malicious crypto mining script (xmr.sh) to containers managed by these Kubelets (containers\n2-7).\n4. Containers that ran xmr.sh started an xmrig process and established an IRC channel back to the IRC C2.\n5. The attacker could also create another tmate session from one of the containers (container 4). With the reverse shell, the attacker could\n\nperform more manual reconnaissance and operations.\n\nThe indicators of compromise (IOCs) found in each container are listed below. These files are either shell script or Executable Linkable Format\n(ELF). The IOC section at the end of the blog contains the hash and details of each file.\n\n**Container 1: TDGG was dropped and executed via Kubelet. TDGG then subsequently downloaded and executed tt.sh, api.key and**\ntmate. The attacker used the established tmate connection to drop and run sGAU.sh, kshell, install_monerod.bash,\nsetup_moneroocean_miner.sh and xmrig (MoneroOcean).\n**Container 2-7: xmr.sh was dropped and executed via Kubelet.**\n**Container 4: The attacker also established a tmate session in this container. The attacker then dropped and executed pei.sh, pei64/32,**\nxmr3.assi, aws2.sh, t.sh, tmate,x86_64.so, xmrig and xmrig.so.\n\n[Figure 2 maps the malware campaign's TTP to MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The following sections will detail the techniques used in each stage.](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.\n\nAttacker’s tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\n## Initial Access\n\n[kubelet is an agent running on each Kubernetes node. It takes RESTful requests from various components (mainly kube-apiserver) and](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#:~:text=The%20kubelet%20is%20the%20primary,object%20that%20describes%20a%20pod.)\nperforms pod-level operations. Depending on the configuration, kubelet may or may not accept unauthenticated requests. Standard\n[Kubernetes deployments come with anonymous access to kubelet by default. However, most managed Kubernetes services such as Azure](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/#kubelet-authentication)\n[Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Kubernetes operations (Kops) all enforce proper authentication by default.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)\n\nWe discovered that TeamTNT gained initial access with the Hildegard malware by executing commands on kubelets that allow anonymous\naccess. This was achieved by accessing the kubelet’s [run command API and executing commands on running containers.](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/14344b57e56258e87cbe80c8cd80399855eca424/pkg/kubelet/server/server.go#L358)\n\n## Execution\n\nHildegard uses kubelet’s API to execute commands inside containers. The initial commands create a tmate reverse shell that allows the\nattacker to carry out the subsequent operation. Unlike the techniques that TeamTNT used in the past, this malware campaign did not pull or\nrun any new container image.\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\nAlthough Unit 42 researchers have not observed an attempt to perform privilege escalation, the malware dropped two adversarial tools,\n[Peirates and](https://github.com/inguardians/peirates) [BOtB, which are capable of breaking out of containers via known vulnerabilities or accessing cloud resources via exposed cloud](https://github.com/brompwnie/botb)\ncredentials.\n\n**Container Breakout**\n\nBOtB can perform a container breakout using a known vulnerability such as CVE-2019-5736. It can also escape from privileged containers\nthat have enabled CAPS and SYSCALLS.\n\n**Access to Cloud Resources**\n\nPeirates can gather multiple infrastructures and cloud credentials. It looks for identity and access management (IAM) credentials from cloud\nmetadata services and service account tokens from the Kubernetes clusters. With the identified credentials, it then further attempts to move\nlaterally or gain control of the cluster. While we observed Peirates in use, the container it was executed in had no credentials.\n\n## Defense Evasion\n\n**Library Injection**\n\n[Hildegard uses LD_PRELOAD to hide the malicious process launched inside the containers. The malware modified the /etc/ld.so.preload file](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)\n[to intercept shared libraries’ imported functions. In particular, the malware overwrites two functions: readdir() and readdir64(), which are](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man3/readdir.3.asp)\nresponsible for returning the directory entries in the file system. The overwritten functions filter out queries made to directory entries under\n/proc. The functions then drop queries with keywords such as tmate, xmrig and ziggy. This way, when applications try to identify the running\n[processes (by reading files under /proc) in the containers, tmate, xmrig and ziggy will not be found. Linux tools such as ps,](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html) [top and many other](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html)\ncontainer monitoring tools will be blinded from these malicious processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.\n\nFunction that overwrites readdir64() in X86_64.so.\n\n**Encrypted ELF Binary**\n\n[Hildegard deploys an IRC agent built from the open-source project ziggystartux. To avoid being detected by automated static analysis tools,](https://github.com/isdrupter/ziggystartux)\nthe ziggystartux ELF is encrypted and packed in another binary (ziggy). When the binary is executed, the ziggystartux ELF is decrypted by a\nhardcoded Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key and executed in memory.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nUnpacking and executing the payload.\n\n**Disguised Process Name**\n\n[The malware names the IRC process “bioset”, which is the name of a well-known Linux kernel process bioset. If one is only looking at the](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/a0725ab0c7536076d5477264420ef420ebb64501/include/linux/bio.h)\nnames of the running processes on a host, one can easily overlook this disguised process.\n\n**DNS Monitoring Bypass**\n\nThe malware modifies the system DNS resolvers and uses Google’s public DNS servers to avoid being detected by DNS monitoring tools.\n\nFigure 5. DNS\n\nresolver modification.\n\n\n-----\n\n**y**\n\nAll the scripts are deleted immediately after being executed. TeamTNT also uses the “history -c” command to clear the shell log in every script.\n\nFigure 6. The script clears the\n\nhistory and deletes itself.\n\n## Credential Access\n\nHildegard searches for credential files on the host, as well as queries metadata for cloud-specific credentials. The identified credentials are\nsent back to the C2.\n\nThe searched credentials include:\n\nCloud access keys.\nCloud access tokens.\nSSH keys.\nDocker credentials.\nKubernetes service tokens.\n\nThe metadata servers searched:\n\n169.254.169.254\n169.254.170.2\n\nFigure 7. The\n\nscript looks for credentials.\n\n## Discovery\n\nHildegard performs several reconnaissance operations to explore the environment.\n\nIt gathers and sends back the host’s OS, CPU and memory information.\nIt uses [masscan to search for kubelets in Kubernetes’ internal network.](http://masscan/)\nIt uses kubelet’s API to search for running containers in a particular node.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. The\n\nscript looks for system and network information.\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\nHildegard mainly uses the unsecured kubelet to move laterally inside a Kubernetes cluster. During the discovery stage, the malware finds the\nexploitable kubelets and the containers these kubelets manage. The malware then creates C2 channels (tmate or IRC) and deploys malicious\ncrypto miners in these containers. Although not observed by Unit 42 researchers, the attacker may also move laterally with the stolen\ncredentials.\n\n## Command and Control\n\nOnce gaining the initial foothold into a container, Hildegard establishes either a tmate session or an IRC channel back to the C2. It is unclear\nhow TeamTNT chooses and tasks between these two C2 channels, as both can serve the same purpose. At the time of writing, tmate\nsessions are the only way the attacker interacts with the compromised containers. Unit 42 researchers have not observed any commands in\nthe IRC channel. However, the IRC server's metadata indicates that the server was deployed on Jan. 9, 2021, and there are around 220\nclients currently connected to the server.\n\nFigure 9. Tmate named session created by the malware.\n\nFigure 10. The IRC servers are hardcoded\n\nin the ziggy binary. Figure 11.The IRC\n\ntraffic captured at the IRC client.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe most significant impact of the malware is resource hijacking and denial of service (DoS). The cryptojacking operation can quickly drain the\n[entire system’s resources and disrupt every application in the cluster. The xmrig mining process joins the supportxmr mining pool using the](https://supportxmr.com/)\nwallet address 428uyvSqdpVZL7HHgpj2T5SpasCcoHZNTTzE3Lz2H5ZkiMzqayy19sYDcBGDCjoWbTfLBnc3tc9rG4Y8gXQ8fJiP5tqeBda. At\nthe time of writing, the malware campaign has ~25.05 KH/s hashing power and there is 11 XMR (~$1,500) in the wallet.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12.\n\nMining activity on supportxmr.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnlike a Docker engine that runs on a single host, a Kubernetes cluster typically contains more than one host and every host can run multiple\ncontainers. Given the abundant resources in a Kubernetes infrastructure, a hijacked Kubernetes cluster can be more profitable than a hijacked\nDocker host. This new TeamTNT malware campaign is one of the most complicated attacks targeting Kubernetes. This is also the most\nfeature-rich malware we have seen from TeamTNT so far. In particular, the threat actor has developed more sophisticated tactics for initial\naccess, execution, defense evasion and C2. These efforts make the malware more stealthy and persistent. Although the malware is still under\ndevelopment and the campaign is not yet widely spread, we believe the attacker will soon mature the tools and start a large-scale deployment.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from this threat by the Runtime Protection features, Cryptominer Detection](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nand by the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance Protection, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes configuration and provides\nsecure alternatives.\n\nFigure 13.\n\nPrisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes compliance protections.\n\nFigure 14.\n\nPrisma Cloud Compute alerting on crypto mining incident.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Domains/IPs:**\n\n**Domain/IP** **Description**\n\n\nThe.borg[.]wtf\n(45.9.150[.]36)\n\n\nThis machine hosts malicious files used in the campaign and receives the collected data to this C2.\nHosted files: TDGG, api.key, tmate, tt.sh, sGAU.sh, t.sh, x86_64.so, xmr.sh, xmrig, xmrig.so, ziggy, xmr3.assi\n\n\n147.75.47[.]199 The malware connects to this IP to obtain the victim host's public IP.\n\n\nteamtnt[.]red\n\n(45.9.148[.]108)\n\nBorg[.]wtf\n\n(45.9.148[.]108)\n\n\nThis host hosts malicious scripts and binaries.\n\nHosted files: pei.sh, pei64.\n\nThis host hosts malicious scripts and binaries.\n\nHosted files: aws2.sh\n\n\n-----\n\nirc.borg[.]wtf\n\n(123.245.9[.]147)\n\nsampwn.anondns[.]net\n(13.245.9[.]147)\n\n\nThis host is one of the C2s.
