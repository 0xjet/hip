Recently, we’ve seen information indicating that the scope of\ntargets can be wider and is no longer limited to the entertainment business. We actually track\nsamples of Winnti malware all the time, but so far we haven’t been able to catch one with\nsolid clues indicating other targeted industries. Also our visibility as a vendor does not cover\nevery company in the world (at least so far ;)) and the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) did\nnot reveal other attacks except those against gaming companies. Well, sometimes targeted\nentities have included telecommunication companies, or better, large holdings, but it seems\nthat at least one of their businesses was in some way related to the production or distribution\nof computer games.\n\nIn April [Novetta released its excellent report on the Winnti malware spotted in the operations](http://www.novetta.com/2015/04/operation-smn-winnti-update/)\nof [Axiom group. The Axiom group has been presented as an advanced Chinese threat actor](http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/10/operation-smn-axiom-group/)\ncarrying out cyber-espionage attacks against a whole range of different industries. For us,\nthe Novetta report was another source of intelligence that Winnti was already expanding\nbeyond online games. One of the recent Winnti samples we found appears to confirm this as\nwell.\n\nThe new sample belongs to one of the Winnti versions described in Novetta’s report – Winnti\n3.0. This is one of the Dynamic Link Libraries composing this RAT (Remote Access Trojan)\nplatform – the worker library (which in essence is the RAT DLL) with the internal name\n_w64.dll and the exported functions work_end and work_start. Since, as usual, this_\ncomponent is stored on the disk with the strings and much of other data in the PE header\nremoved/zeroed, it is impossible to restore the compilation date of this DLL. But this library\n\n\n-----\n\nincludes two drivers compiled on August 22 and September 4, 2014. The sample has an\nencrypted configuration block placed in overlay. This block may include a tag for the sample\n– usually it is a campaign ID or victim ID/name. This time the operators put such tag in the\nconfiguration and it turned out to be the name of the well-known global pharmaceutical\n**company headquartered in Europe:**\n\n**_Pic.1 Configuration block_**\n\nBesides the sample tag, the configuration block includes the names of other files involved in\nthe working of the RAT platform and the service name (Adobe Service), after which malware\nis installed. The presence of the following files could indicate that the system has been\ncompromised:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\tmpCCD.tmp_\n_ServiceAdobe.dll_\n_ksadobe.dat_\n\nOne of the mentioned drivers (a known, malicious Winnti network rootkit) was signed with a\n**stolen certificate of a division of a huge Japanese conglomerate. Although this division**\nis involved in microelectronics manufacturing, other business directions of the conglomerate\ninclude development and production of drugs as well as medical equipment.\n\nAlthough the nature of the involvement of Winnti operators, who were earlier perceived to be\na threat only to the online gaming industry, in the activities of other cyber-espionage teams\nstill remains rather obscure, the evidence is there. From now on, when you see Winnti\nmentioned, don’t think just about gaming companies; consider also at least targeted\ntelecoms and big pharma companies.\n\nHere are the samples in question:\n\n**_8e61219b18d36748ce956099277cc29b – Backdoor.Win64.Winnti.gy_**\n**_5979cf5018c03be2524b87b7dda64a1a – Backdoor.Win64.Winnti.gf_**\n**_ac9b247691b1036a1cdb4aaf37bea97f – Rootkit.Win64.Winnti.ai_**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Digital Certificates](https://securelist.com/tag/digital-certificates/)\n[Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/malware/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Winnti](https://securelist.com/tag/winnti/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Dmitry Tarakanov](https://securelist.com/author/dmitryt/)\n\nGames are over: Winnti is now targeting pharmaceutical companies\n\nYour email address will not be published.
