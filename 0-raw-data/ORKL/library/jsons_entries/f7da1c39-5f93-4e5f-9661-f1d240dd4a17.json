It has**\n**been observed that when individuals search for popular tools such as Notepad++,**\n**Zoom, AnyDesk, Foxit, Photoshop, and others on Google, they may encounter ads**\n**that redirect them to malicious sites. This report aims to provide a high-level analysis**\n**of one such campaign, specifically focusing on the delivery of the Vidar Info-stealer**\n**malware.**\n\n**Campaign Details**\n\n\nOn the 25 of January 2023, Darktrace researchers observed that the advertisementth\ndepicted in Figure 1 was being displayed on Google when searching for the term\n\"Notepad++\" from within the United States.\n\nFigure 1: Google Ad shown when searching for Notepad++\nAs can be seen in Figure 2, the advertisement in question had no visible information\nregarding its publisher.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Advertisement information\nClicking on the advertisement would direct potential victims to the website\nnotepadplusplus.site, which had been registered on the 4 of January and is hosted on IPth\naddress 37.140.192.11. Upon selecting the desired version of the software, a download\nbutton is presented to the visitor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Malicious site with fake Notepad++\n\nFigure 4: Malicious site with fake Notepad++\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen clicking on Download, regardless of the version selected, the traffic is then redirected\nto https://download-notepad-plus-plus.duckdns.org/, and a .zip file with name\n“npp.Installer.x64.zip” is downloaded.\n\nFigure 5: Traffic redirection\nUpon extraction, the file \"npp.Installer.x64.exe\" has a file size of 684.1 megabytes. The\nsignificant size is attributed to the inclusion of an excessive number of null bytes, which\nserve to prevent the file from being scanned by some Antivirus and uploaded to malware\nanalysis platforms such as VirusTotal, which has a file size limit of 650 megabytes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: npp.Installer.x64.zip\nInitially, padding was incorporated at the end of the executable, enabling individuals to\nremove it while maintaining a fully functional file. However, in the sample analysed in this\nreport, padding was inserted into the binary's central region. This method renders the\nremoval of padding more challenging, as simply deleting the zeroes would compromise the\nintegrity of the file and impede its functionality during dynamic analysis.\n\nFigure 7: Beginning of null bytes padding\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: End of null bytes padding\nAfter execution, the malware promptly establishes a connection to a Telegram channel to\nacquire its command and control (C2) address, specifically http://95.217.16.127. If Telegram\nis not available, the malware will then attempt to connect to a profile on video game platform\nSteam, in which case the C2 address was http://157.90.148.112/ at the time of initial analysis\nand http://116.203.6.107 later. It then proceeds to check-in and obtain its configuration file\nand subsequently downloads get.zip, an archive containing several legitimate DLL libraries,\nwhich are utilized to extract information and saved passwords from various applications and\nbrowsers. Through traffic analysis, the method by which the malware obtains its Command\nand Control (C2) location, and analysis of the configuration obtained, it can be assessed with\nhigh confidence that the malware in question is the info-stealer known as Vidar. Vidar has\nbeen extensively covered by various cybersecurity organizations. Further information\nregarding this info-stealer and its origins can be found here[3].\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Telegram traffic\n\nFigure 10: Telegram channel containing the location of Vidar’s C2 address\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Steam profile containing the location of Vidar’s C2 address\n\nFigure 12: Vidar C2 traffic\n\nFigure 13: Vidar configuration obtained from the C2\n\nFigure 14: Libraries downloaded by Vidar\n\n## Campaign ID 827\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domain download-notepad-plus-plus.duckdns.org, from which the malware is distributed,\nresolves to the IP address 185.163.204.10. Using passive DNS, it has been determined that\nmultiple domains also resolve to this IP address. This information suggests that the threat\ngroup responsible for this campaign is also utilizing advertising to target individuals\nsearching for specific applications besides Notepad++, including:\n\nOBS Studio\nDavinci Resolve\nSqlite\nRufus\nKrita\n\nFurthermore, it has been observed that all the malware samples obtained in this investigation\nconnect to the same Telegram channel, utilize the same two Command and Control IP\naddresses, and share the same campaign ID of \"827\".\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe recent proliferation of malvertising campaigns, which are employed by cyber-criminals to\ndistribute malware, has become a significant cause for concern. Unlike more traditional\ninfection vectors, such as email, malvertising is harder to protect against. Furthermore, the\nuse of padding techniques to inflate the size of malware payloads can make detection and\nanalysis more challenging.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of falling victim to such attacks, it is recommended to exercise caution\nwhen interacting with online advertisements. Specifically, it is advisable to avoid clicking on\nany advertisements while searching for free software on search engines and to instead\ndownload programs directly from official sources. This approach can reduce the likelihood of\ninadvertently downloading malware from untrusted sources.\n\nAnother effective measure to counteract the threat of malicious ads is the utilization of adblocker software. The implementation of an ad-blocker can provide an additional layer of\nprotection against malvertising campaigns and enhance overall cybersecurity.\n\n## Appendices\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**Filename    npp.Installer.x64.zip**\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n7DFD1D4FE925F802513FEA5556DE53706D9D8172BFA207D0F8AAB3CEF46424E8\n\n**Filename     npp.Installer.x64.exe**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n368008b450397c837f0b9c260093935c5cef56646e16a375ba7c47fea5562bfd\n\n**Filename     rufus-3.21.zip**\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n75db4f8187abf49376a6ff3de0163b2d708d72948ea4b3d5645b86a0e41af084\n\n**Filename     rufus-3.21.exe**\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n169603a5b5d23dc2f02dc0f88a73dcdd08a5c62d12203fb53a3f43998c04bb41\n\n**Filename     DaVinci_Resolve_18.1.2_Windows.zip**\n\n**SHA256 Hash 73f00e3b3ab01f4d5de42790f9ab12474114abe10cd5104f623aef9029c15b1e**\n\n**Filename     DaVinci_Resolve_18.1.2_Windows.exe**\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n169603a5b5d23dc2f02dc0f88a73dcdd08a5c62d12203fb53a3f43998c04bb41\n\n**Filename     krita-x64-5.1.5-setup.zip**\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n85eb4b0e3922312d88ca046d89909fba078943aea3b469d82655a253e0d3ac67\n\n**Filename     krita-x64-5.1.5-setup.exe**\n\n**SHA256 Hash**\n169603a5b5d23dc2f02dc0f88a73dcdd08a5c62d12203fb53a3f43998c04bb41\n\n**URL   http://95.217.16.127/827**\n\n**URL   http://95.217.16.127/get.zip**\n\n**URL   http://95.217.16.127/**\n\n**URL   http://157.90.148.112/827**\n\n**URL   http://157.90.148.112/**\n\n**URL   http://157.90.148.112/get.zip**\n\n**URL   http://116.203.6.107/**\n\n**Domain      notepadplusplus.site**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain      download-notepad-plus-plus.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-obsstudio.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      dowbload-notepadd.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      dowbload-notepad1.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-davinci-resolve.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-davinci.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-sqlite.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-davinci17.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-rufus.duckdns.org**\n\n**Domain      download-kritapaint.duckdns.org**\n\n**IP Address   37.140.192.11**\n\n**IP Address   185.163.204.10**\n\n**IP Address   95.217.16.127**\n\n**IP Address    157.90.148.112**\n\n**IP Address   116.203.6.107**\n\n**URL   https://t.me/litlebey**\n\n**URL   https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199472399815**\n\n## References\n\n**[1] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-push-malware-via-google-**\nsearch-ads-for-vlc-7-zip-ccleaner/\n\n**[2] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-access-brokers-use-**\ngoogle-ads-to-breach-your-network/\n\n**[3] https://www.team-cymru.com/post/darth-vidar-the-dark-side-of-evolving-threat-**\ninfrastructure\n\n## More in this series:\n\nNo items found.\n\n\n-----",
