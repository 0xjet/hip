This same actor previousl distributed\nanother ransomware called Blackheart and promotes other infections such as a RAT.\n\nBlackRouter was originally spotted in May 2018 and had its moment of fame\nwhen [TrendMicro discovered it being dropped along with the AnyDesk remote access](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/legitimate-application-anydesk-bundled-with-new-ransomware-variant/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Anti-MalwareBlog+%28Trendlabs+Security+Intelligence+Blog%29)\nprogram and keyloggers on victim's computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Original**\n\n**BlackRouter/Blackheart Ransomware**\nIn early January, a new version of the BlackRouter Ransomware was discovered by a\n[security researcher named Petrovic, who shared the sample on Twitter. Furthermore,](https://twitter.com/petrovic082/status/1081819901797548032)\nMalwareHunterTeam [stated that this was basically the same as the previous variant, but](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1082322503320682496)\nwith a better looking GUI and the addition of a timer.\n\n**BlackRouter Ransomware GUI**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Soon after BlackRouter was discovered, another security researcher named A Shadow told](https://twitter.com/arealshadow)\nBleepingComputer that this ransomware was being promoted as a RaaS in a hacking\nchannel on Telegram by an Iranian developer.\n\n**BlackRouter Promotion on Telegram**\nAffiliates who join this RaaS and distribute the BlackRouter ransomware will earn 80% of\nany paid ransom payments, with the other 20% going to the BlackRouter developer.\n\nIn addition, this actor is promoting a remote access Trojan called BlackRat that allegedly\nincludes features such as encrypted communications, AV evasion, small size, plugins, the\nability to enable RDP, configure a miner, steal cryptocurrency wallets, keylogger, passwordstealer, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n**BlackRat Promotion**\n\nBlackRouter does not seem to be heavily distributed, with only one submission to ID\nRansomware since December 31.\n\nWith that said, ransomware like BlackRouter is commonly distributed via hacking into\nRemote Desktop Services or through fake cracks and downloads. Therefore, make sure to\nnot allow RDP to connect directly to the Internet and be sure to scan anything you\ndownload from an untrusted source.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[BlackHeart](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/blackheart/)\n[BlackRouter](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/blackrouter/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Iran](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/iran/)\n[RaaS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/raas/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ransomware-as-a-Service](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware-as-a-service/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
