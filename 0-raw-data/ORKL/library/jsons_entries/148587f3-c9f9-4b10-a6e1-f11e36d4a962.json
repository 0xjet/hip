We observed the group using\npreviously unseen malware in these attacks.\n\nPalmerworm uses a combination of custom malware, dual use tools, and living-off-the-land\ntactics in this campaign. Palmerworm has been active since at least 2013, with the first\nactivity seen in this campaign in August 2019.\n\n## Tactics, Tools, and Procedures\n\nPalmerworm was observed using both dual-use tools and custom malware in these attacks.\n\nAmong the custom malware families we saw it use were:\n\nBackdoor.Consock\nBackdoor.Waship\n\n\n-----\n\nBackdoor.Dalwit\nBackdoor.Nomri\n\nWe have not observed the group using these malware families in previous attacks – they\nmay be newly developed tools, or the evolution of older Palmerworm tools. Malware used by\nPalmerworm in the past has included:\n\nBackdoor.Kivars\nBackdoor.Pled\n\nWhile the custom malware used by the group in this campaign is previously undocumented,\nother elements of the attack bear similarities to past Palmerworm campaigns, making us\nreasonably confident that it is the same group carrying out this campaign.\n\nAs well as the four backdoors mentioned, we also see the group using a custom loader and\na network reconnaissance tool, which Symantec detects as Trojan Horse and Hacktool. The\ngroup also used several dual-use tools, including:\n\n**Putty – can be leveraged by attackers for remote access, to exfiltrate data and send it**\nback to attackers\n**PSExec – is a legitimate Microsoft tool that can be exploited by malicious actors and**\nused for lateral movement across victim networks\n**SNScan – this tool can be used for network reconnaissance, to find other potential**\ntargets on victim networks\n**WinRAR – is an archiving tool that can be used to compress files (potentially to make**\nthem easier to send back to attackers) and also to extract files from zipped folders\n\nAll these dual-use tools are commonly exploited by malicious actors like Palmerworm, with\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) groups like this increasingly using living-off-the-land tactics,\nincluding the use of dual-use tools, in recent years. These tools provide attackers with a\ngood degree of access to victim systems without the need to create complicated custom\nmalware that can more easily be linked back to a specific group.\n\nIn this campaign, Palmerworm is also using stolen code-signing certificates to sign its\npayloads, which makes the payloads appear more legitimate and therefore more difficult for\n[security software to detect. Palmerworm has been publicly documented using stolen code-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/07/09/certificates-stolen-taiwanese-tech-companies-plead-malware-campaign/)\nsigning certificates in previous attack campaigns.\n\nWe did not see what infection vector Palmerworm used to gain initial access to victim\nnetworks in this campaign, however, in the past the group has been documented as using\nspear-phishing emails to gain access to victim networks.\n\n## Victims\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec identified multiple victims in this campaign, in a number of industries, including\nmedia, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance. The media, electronics, and\nfinance companies were all based in Taiwan, the engineering company was based in Japan,\nand the construction company in China. It is evident Palmerworm has a strong interest in\ncompanies in this region of East Asia.\n\nWe also observed Palmerworm activity on some victims in the U.S., however, we were\nunable to identify the sector of the companies targeted.\n\nPalmerworm activity was first spotted in this campaign in August 2019, when activity was\nseen on the network of a Taiwanese media company and a construction company in China.\nThe group remained active on the network of the media company for a year, with activity on\nsome machines there seen as recently as August 2020.\n\nPalmerworm also maintained a presence on the networks of a construction and a finance\ncompany for several months. However, it spent only a couple of days on the network of a\nJapanese engineering company in September 2019, and a couple of weeks on the network\nof an electronics company in March 2020. It spent approximately six months on one of the\nU.S.-based machines on which we observed activity.\n\n\n-----",
