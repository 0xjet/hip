The team is a major threat to organizations that have large volumes of proprietary intellectual property, all of which is\n at risk of being stolen by this group for monetary gain.\n\n The Butterfly attackers, who Symantec believes are a small number of technically capable individuals, compromised several major technology companies including Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft in early 2013. In these campaigns, the attackers used a Java zero-day exploit to drop malware onto victims’ computers.\n\n Since those attacks, there has been little-to-no public information about the Butterfly attackers. Symantec has been working with victims to track these attackers over the past two years. We found that Butterfly compromised multiple pharmaceutical companies, technology firms, law practices, and oil and precious metal mining organizations during\n this period. The attackers are versatile and spread their threats quickly within compromised organizations. They may also have had access to at least one other zero-day exploit, affecting Internet Explorer 10.\n\n There are some indications that this group may be made up of native English speakers,\n are familiar with Western culture, and may operate from an Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Prior to Butterfly, the majority of documented cyberespionage attacks has been conducted against politically sensitive entities such as embassies, government ministries, central banks, dissidents, militaries, and associated defense contractors. Government-sponsored attackers have also attacked private sector organizations, presumably to steal intellectual property in order to provide their local industry with an unfair advantage in the market.\n\n Butterfly is a timely reminder to organizations that as well as defending against state-sponsored attacks, organizations must be aware of the potential threat of corporate espionage, where attacks are performed at the behest of competitors or by individuals looking to monetize stolen information such as through stock trading using insider knowledge. A key difference between attacks coming from competitors and state- sponsored attackers is that competitors are likely in a better position to request the theft of specific information of value and make more rapid use of this information than government-sponsored attackers would.\n\n Butterfly appears to be part of this class of attack group. The attackers appear to be motivated by financial gain, either by using the information themselves for their own benefit or selling it to a third party.\n\n * “Morpho” was used in the original publication to refer to this attack group. Symantec has renamed the group “Butterfly” to avoid any link whatsoever to other legitimate corporate entities named “Morpho”.\n\n\n-----\n\n### BACKGROUND\n\n## The attackers appear to be motivated by financial gain, either by using the information themselves for their own benefit or selling it to a third party.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\n##### The corporate espionage threat\n\nPrior to Butterfly, the majority of documented cyberespionage attacks has been conducted against politically\nsensitive entities such as embassies, government ministries, central banks, dissidents, militaries, and associated\ndefense contractors. Government-sponsored attackers have also attacked private sector organizations,\npresumably to steal intellectual property in order to provide their local industry with an unfair advantage in the\nmarket.\n\nButterfly is a timely reminder to organizations that as well as defending against state-sponsored attacks,\norganizations must be aware of the potential threat of corporate espionage, where attacks are performed at the\nbehest of competitors or by individuals looking to monetize stolen information such as through stock trading\nusing insider knowledge. A key difference between attacks coming from competitors and state-sponsored\nattackers is that competitors are likely in a better position to request the theft of specific information of value\nand make more rapid use of this information than government-sponsored attackers would.\n\nButterfly appears to be part of this class of attack group. The attackers appear to be motivated by financial gain,\neither by using the information themselves for their own benefit or selling it to a third party.\n\n##### Butterfly attacks against tech firms\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Twitter published a blog, stating that it had “discovered one live attack” and added that\nit was “able to shut it down in process moments later.” Twitter encouraged users “to disable Java” in their\nbrowsers. “The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have\nalso been recently similarly attacked,” said Twitter.\n\nFourteen days later, on February 15, Facebook issued a statement, disclosing that several of its systems\n“had been targeted in a sophisticated attack.” Facebook said that the attackers used “a ‘zero-day’ (previously\nunseen) exploit to bypass the Java sandbox,” which had been hosted on a “mobile developer website that was\ncompromised.”\n\nReuters referenced a similar statement from Apple a few days later on February 19. According to Apple,\nattackers used a Java zero-day exploit to compromise a number of Apple employees’ Mac OS X computers. Apple\nsaid that the exploit was delivered through a “site aimed at iPhone developers.”\n\nFinally, Microsoft published a statement on February 22, stating that it too had “experienced a similar security\nintrusion” as the ones reported by Facebook and Apple.\n\nThe attacks against these technology firms appeared to take place between 2012 and early 2013. The zero-day\nexploit referred to in the various statements took advantage of the Oracle Java Runtime Environment Multiple\nRemote Code Execution Vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-0422). The vulnerability had been patched by Oracle on\nJanuary 13, 2013, after the attacks occurred. Various parties published details of the attack vector, as well as\nthe malware used in the attacks, several days later.\n\nF-Secure blogged that a Mac OS X back door (detected by Symantec as OSX.Pintsized) was the attack’s payload.\nAccording to the website StopMalvertising, the compromised website that hosted the exploit was an iPhone\ndeveloper website called iPhoneDevSDK.com.\n\nIndependent researcher Eric Romang published some technical details about the attacks and established a\ntimeline suggesting that the attackers have been active from September 2012. Symantec telemetry indicates\nthat the timeline goes back even further than this, with malicious activity starting from at least April 2012.\nRomang analyzed many of the OSX.Pintsized samples and also identified a Windows back door, which he claimed\nwas related to the attacks. This Windows file is a variant of what Symantec detects as Backdoor.Jiripbot. Other\nvendors called the variant Jripbot.\n\nSince Romang’s analysis, there has been little-to-no public information related to the attackers behind the Java\nzero-day exploit or the use of OSX.Pintsized and Backdoor.Jiripbot.\n\n\n-----\n\n### VICTIMS\n\n## Some victims seem to have been compromised as a result of collateral damage, as the attackers appeared uninterested in them and either cleaned up or abandoned the infection\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Victims\n\nAfter the events of late 2012 and early 2013, the Butterfly attackers appeared to have maintained a low profile,\ncompromising a small number of organizations. Each year however, that number has increased. Symantec has\ndiscovered that the Butterfly attackers have compromised 49 unique organizations. Out of the 49 organizations,\n27 of the companies’ industries could be identified, while the remaining are unknown.\n\nSome victims\nseem to have been\ncompromised as a\nresult of collateral\ndamage, as the\nattackers appeared\nuninterested in them\nand either cleaned\nup or abandoned the\ninfection. However,\nother victims were\nclearly of value to\nButterfly, as the\nattackers spread\nquickly in the networks\nuntil they found\ncomputers of interest.\nThe chart in Figure 1\nshows the number of\ninfected organizations\nper industry over\ntime. The graph is\nfiltered to only include _Figure 1. Number of infected organizations per industry by year_\norganizations that\ncould be classified into\na sector.\n\nSymantec found that there was a lull in activity following the very public documentation of the late 2012 and\nearly 2013 attacks. Butterfly’s activity resumed in August 2013, and there has been a substantial increase in the\nnumber of victims from late 2014 to the present.\n\nThe three regions that were\nmost heavily targeted by\nButterfly since 2012 are\nshown in Figure 2.\n\nThe other regions affected\nby Butterfly’s attacks are:\n\n         - Brazil\n\n        - China\n\n       - Hong Kong\n\n         - India\n\n         - Israel\n\n        - Japan\n\n        - Kazakhstan\n\n        - Malaysia\n\n       - Morocco _Figure 2. Three regions most heavily targeted by Butterfly attackers_\n\n        - Nigeria\n\n        - Taiwan\n\n        - Thailand\n\n        - South Korea\n\n        - United Arab Emirates\n\n\n-----\n\nThe industries of known victims have remained relatively consistent over time, with some notable exceptions.\n\n##### Industries\n\nThe Java zero-day attack that exploited CVE-2013-0422 appears to have targeted technology companies, judging\nfrom the nature of the watering-hole website. This claim is backed up by the organizations that publicly reported\nhow they were compromised in the attacks. Butterfly has continued to target a number of technology companies,\nwhich are primarily based in the US.\n\nOther Butterfly victims of note are involved in the pharmaceutical, legal, and commodities industries. The\nButterfly attackers continued to attack these industries intermittently over the following two years.\n\n###### Pharmaceutical\n\nIn January 2014, a major European pharmaceutical company was compromised. The attackers appear to have\nfirst breached a small European office and a month later, spread across the network to the company’s US office,\nas well as the European headquarters.\n\nTwo more major European pharmaceutical companies were later compromised−one in September 2014 and\nthe other in June 2015. In both incidents, the attackers appear to have gained access to computers in several\nregional offices. In the June 2015 compromise, the affected company quickly identified the infection from\nSymantec’s alerts, as well as other notifications on Secure Shell (SSH) traffic on non-standard ports.\n\n###### Technology\n\nThe Butterfly attackers have consistently targeted major technology companies from late 2012 to the present.\nAt least five companies, in addition to those who publicly documented the attacks in 2013, have been\ncompromised, to Symantec’s knowledge. The technology companies are primarily headquartered in the US.\n\n###### Law\n\nIn the watering-hole attacks of early 2012, two US-based law firms were attacked. No other known legal entities\nwere attacked until June\n2015, when the Central Asian\noffices of a global law firm\nwere compromised. This most\nrecent victim specializes in a\nnumber of topics, including\nfinance and natural resources\nspecific to the region.\n\n###### Commodities\n\nTwo major natural\nresources organizations\nwere compromised in late\n2014. These organizations\nspecifically work with gold\nand oil. The timing of these\ncompromises, along with the\nlater breach of the law firm\nas previously mentioned, is\nnotable. It seems very likely\nthat the Butterfly attackers\nhave a specific interest in the\ncommodities industry and are\nin a position to profit from\ninformation stolen from the\nbreached organizations.\n_Figure 3. Timeline showing when attacks against different industry sectors began_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Government, logistics, and education\n\nA number of victims appear to have been of little interest to the attackers. This was the case for one Middle\nEastern government agency, a Japanese logistics company, and an American university. With all three victims,\neither the attack was not successful or, if it was, the malware was not used after the initial compromise. It seems\nlikely that these victims were collateral damage.\n\n##### Targeted computers\n\nThe attackers focused on obtaining access to specific systems of interest in all of the compromised\norganizations. In most organizations, these systems were email servers: either Microsoft Exchange or Lotus\nDomino servers. Once the attackers had this access, they presumably then eavesdropped on email conversations\nand may have been in a position to potentially insert fraudulent emails as well.\n\nOther systems that the attackers compromised were enterprise content management servers. These systems are\nused for indexing and storing a company’s various documents and other digital assets. Such servers would not\ncontain source code, but rather legal documents, internal policies, training documents, product descriptions,\nand financial records.\n\nIn one technology company breach, Butterfly compromised a more unusual system. The attackers gained access\nto what is known as a Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) system. This software is used for\naggregating, managing, and monitoring physical security systems and devices. The physical security systems\ncould consist of CCTV, swipe card access, HVAC, and other building security. After compromised that system, the\nattackers could have monitored employees through the company’s own CCTV systems and tracked the activities\nof individuals within the building.\n\n#### Tools, tactics, and procedures\n\nButterfly operates consistently across its breaches, deploying the same set of tools and targeting the same\ntypes of computers, which we detail in the Victims section of this report. Butterfly adapts quickly to targeted\nenvironments and takes advantage of systems already in place, such as remote access tools or management\nsystems, in order to spread across the network.\n\nWhile Butterfly has used one confirmed zero-day exploit (CVE-2013-0422), the group appears to have used at\nleast one more zero-day exploit against a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 10.\n\nBased on our analysis of a command-and-control (C&C) server used in an attack, the Butterfly operators\ndemonstrate exceptional operational security, as they use encrypted virtual machines and multi-staged C&C\nservers to make it difficult to investigate their activities.\n\n##### Gaining initial access\n\nThe attack vector for Butterfly’s campaigns in late 2012 and early 2013 was well documented. The group\nconducted a watering-hole attack that compromised a popular mobile phone developer website, iPhoneDevSDK.\ncom, to deliver a Java zero-day exploit. However, little information is known about how the Butterfly attackers\nhave continued to gain access to victims’ systems, except for a few cases.\n\nIn one of the most serious cases, on June 25, 2014, Internet Explorer 10 created a file called bda9.tmp\non a victim’s computer. It is likely that bda9.tmp was created as a result of an exploit targeting Internet\nExplorer. Bda9.tmp was then executed and went on to create a variant of Backdoor.Jiripbot with the file name\nLiveUpdate.exe.\n\nThe affected version of Internet Explorer was a fully up-to-date, patched version of the browser, so the exploit\nwas very likely either a zero-day for Internet Explorer 10 or for a plugin used in Internet Explorer.\n\nMicrosoft patched a number of Internet Explorer 10 remote code execution vulnerabilities in subsequent Patch\n\n\n-----\n\nTuesday releases. It is possible that one of these patches covered the exploit, as there is no additional evidence\nof an Internet Explorer 10 exploit in use. It was not possible to identify the website hosting the exploit or to\nretrieve a copy of the exploit.\n\nIn late 2014, Java was used to create a file called updt.dat on a system belonging to another targeted\norganization. The updt.dat file was located in a JBossweb folder, which is a sub-folder of Apache Tomcat. Based\non this activity, it seems likely that the JBoss server was compromised to deploy the malware. The breach may\nhave been a result of an SQL injection attack. This is based on evidence from an analyzed C&C server, where we\ndiscovered that the Butterfly attackers use the SQLMap tool against their targets.\n\nOnce Butterfly gains a foothold in the victim’s network, they begin to carefully spread through it, until they\nlocate a system of interest.\n\n##### Spreading\n\nIn at least two incidents, the attackers appear to have taken advantage of internal systems to spread through\na network once they gained initial access. In one instance, the attackers used a Citrix profile management\napplication to create a back door on a newly infected system. This application can be used to install applications\nor manage a user’s profile for authentication. It’s likely that the attackers took advantage of this system and\nplaced the back door in a specific profile, which was triggered when the profile’s owner logged in.\n\nIn the second incident, the TeamViewer application was used to create copies of Backdoor.Jiripbot on the\ncompromised computers. It appears that TeamViewer was legitimately present on the targeted computers and\nwas then taken advantage of by the attackers.\n\nHowever the attackers spread within a network, they are able to move quickly. In one breach, the attackers first\ncompromised a computer on April 16, 2014. Within one day, they compromised three more computers. Once a\ncomputer is infected, the attackers seem to rapidly determine whether or not the computer is valuable to them.\n\nThere are two instances where there was no additional Butterfly activity after the computers were infected, apart\nfrom the creation of shred.exe. In these cases, the attackers likely determined that the infected computers were\nnot valuable targets and used shred.exe to securely remove the infections.\n\n##### The Butterfly toolkit\n\nThe Butterfly attackers use a number of different tools, a subset of which has been retrieved from compromised\ncomputers. This set of tools appears to be unique to the attackers, as the tools have been in use in combination\nwith each other and there has been no open source data on the various tools used.\n\nThe attackers use the hacking tools once they gain a foothold on a network. They generally give the tools .dat\nextensions and file names that usually give some indication of the tools’ purposes. For example, the attackers\nrefer to one of the tools as “Banner Jack” and deploy it with the name bj.dat. It is likely that these files are\nencrypted when they are downloaded and are then decrypted when on disk.\n\nKnown hashes and corresponding file names are listed in the appendix under the Hashes section. A number of\nthe hacking tools also contain help documentation, which details how to use the tool. Each help description is\nlisted in the appendix, where present.\n\n###### OSX.Pintsized and Hacktool.Securetunnel\n\nThe back door OSX.Pintsized was well documented by F-Secure, Intego, and Romang after the 2012/2013 tech\ncompany attacks. OSX.Pintsized is a modification of OpenSSH that runs on Mac OS X, and contains additional\ncode to read two new arguments and an embedded RSA key. The two additional arguments are “-z” and “-p”,\nwhich are used to pass a C&C server address and port respectively. The back door has also been observed using\na very basic Perl script that opens a reverse shell.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Butterfly attackers use the same modified version of OpenSSH on 32-bit Windows systems. This version uses\nthe exact same “-z” and “-p” additional arguments and also includes an embedded RSA key. The attackers have\ntwo versions: one which is statically linked against OpenSSH and the other which is compiled using a Cygwin\nDLL. Symantec detects these samples as Hacktool.Securetunnel.\n\n###### Backdoor.Jiripbot\n\nRomang referenced a malware family called Backdoor.Jiripbot (aka Jripbot) in his blog. This is the Butterfly\ngroup’s primary back door tool, which has a fallback domain generation algorithm (DGA) for maintaining\ncommand and control. A comprehensive technical description of this malware family is provided in the appendix.\n\nOne notable point about Backdoor.Jiripbot is the use of the string “AYBABTU” as an encryption key. This is the\nacronym for “All your base are belong to us”, a popular meme used by gamers.\n\nThe attackers have used several variants of this malware family from 2013 to at least June of 2015, with several\nminor modifications adding or removing commands.\n\n###### Hacktool.Bannerjack\n\nHacktool.Bannerjack is used to retrieve default messages issued by Telnet, HTTP, and generic Transmission\nControl Protocol (TCP) servers. The help documentation for the tool is listed in the appendix. The tool takes\nan IP address range and port. It then connects to each IP address on a given port, retrieving and logging any\ndata printed by the server. The tool is presumably used to locate any potentially vulnerable servers on the local\nnetwork, likely including printers, routers, HTTP servers, and any other generic TCP servers.\n\n###### Hacktool.Multipurpose\n\nHacktool.Multipurpose also appears to be a custom-developed tool. It is designed to assist attackers in\nspreading through a network. It hides activity by editing events logs, dumping passwords, securely deleting files,\nencrypting files, and performing basic network enumeration.\n\nThe help documentation for this tool is quite comprehensive and extensively explains the tool’s functionality.\nThis documentation is listed in the appendix.\n\n###### Hacktool.Eventlog\n\nHacktool.Eventlog is another multipurpose tool, but its primary functionality is to parse event logs, dumping out\nones of interest, and to delete entries. The tool will also end processes and perform a secure self-delete. The help\ndocumentation for the tool is listed in the appendix.\n\n###### Hacktool.Proxy.A\n\nHacktool.Proxy.A creates a proxy connection that allows attackers to route traffic through an intermediary node\nonto their destination node. The documentation for the tool is listed in the appendix.\n\n##### Operational security\n\nThe Butterfly attackers have demonstrated excellent operational security, as we have observed in several\naspects of their attacks.\n\nThe Butterfly attackers use a number of anti-forensics techniques to prevent detection and presumably hinder\ninvestigation into their activity when discovered. The group’s malware and other files are securely deleted using\neither the GNU Shred tool, which overwrites a file’s contents as well as deleting the index from the file allocation\n\n\n-----\n\ntable, or the shred functionality written into a custom tool. Similarly, event logs are modified to remove any\nevidence of the attackers’ activity. A specific tool, Hacktool.Eventlog, appears to have been developed to perform\njust this function. Using both techniques, the attackers can securely remove infections from computers that are\nof no interest, letting them avoid leaving any trace of activity.\n\nAnother aspect of Butterfly’s operational security is the use of throwaway registrant names for C&C domains.\nThere appears to be no re-use of email addresses or names when registering different domains and C&C servers.\nSimilarly, the Butterfly attackers use bitcoins to pay hosting providers to host their C&C servers. This method of\npayment makes it difficult for investigators to track the transaction back to a particular entity.\n\nFinally, one of the most telling aspects of the Butterfly attackers’ level of operational security is how they run\ntheir C&C servers. Symantec performed a forensic analysis of a C&C server used by the Butterfly attackers in late\n2014. These attackers typically use a multi-staged C&C infrastructure, with several servers acting as proxies and\nredirecting connections back to a final server. Symantec believes that the analyzed server was this final server,\nhowever, it was not possible to confirm this.\n\nThe analyzed server was running Debian Linux and was very clean, with little traces of activity. Logging had been\ndisabled and any log files that had been created before logging was disabled were securely deleted. A single file\nwas present in the /root/ directory. This file, called “hd-porn-corrupted_tofix.rar”, was 400GB in size. Despite\nthe .rar extension, it was not a .rar file. However, there were some indications on the server as to what this file\nactually was.\n\nTruecrypt was installed on the server, as was Virtual Box. Truecrypt is an encryption tool that can be used to\ncreate an encrypted file system in a single file. Virtual Box is software that can be used to run a virtual machine.\nIt is likely that the 400GB “.rar” file was an encrypted Truecrypt file which contains a Virtual Box virtual machine.\nThe Butterfly attackers would decrypt and run the virtual machine, redirecting SSH traffic from the physical\nhosting server to the virtual machine. This would give the attackers the ability to control compromised systems\nfrom within the virtual machine. This type of design is effective at hindering analysis without a live memory\nimage of the C&C server.\n\nThere were other hints of activity on the C&C server as well. There was evidence to suggest that the attackers\nused the SQLMap tool. This tool looks for SQL weaknesses in web applications, and indeed, as previously\nmentioned, at least one victim was compromised through a JBoss server, possibly through an SQL injection\nattack. Also, the local time zone of the C&C server was changed to New York, UTC-5.\n\nHowever, apart from the SQLMap activity and the modified time zone, there was no other evidence on the C&C\nserver. The Butterfly attackers maintained a very clean house.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Attribution\n\nBased on the gathered evidence, there are several plausible theories that describe the nature of the Butterfly\nattackers. A summary of some of the data gathered is presented below:\n\n         - Victims are primarily large corporations, mostly related to technology, pharmaceutical, commodities, and law.\n\n        - The targeted technology companies are mostly based in the US, however, other victims are spread across the\n\nglobe.\n\n        - There is one government victim\n\n         - Infection numbers are generally quite low; there are not many concurrent infections\n\n         - Activity remains consistent across infected organizations; the attackers use same file names and deploy the\n\nsame tools\n\n         - The group has excellent operational security\n\n         - The attackers have had access to at least one zero-day exploit, likely two and possibly more.\n\n         - The attackers appear to develop their own tools.\n\n        - The group’s various hacktools have extensive documentation written in good English.\n\n        - Several memes or colloquialisms specific to English speakers are used\n\n        - “All your bases are belong to us”–The AYBABTU encryption key in Backdoor.Jiripbot\n\n        - “Stuffz”–A phrase used in the Hacktool.Multipurpose description\n\n        - “Zap”–To mean delete, used in the Hacktool.Eventlog description\n\n         - The time zone of the C&C server is set to EST\n\nThe nature of the observed victims indicates that it’s likely that Butterfly attackers’ motivation is not for national\nsecurity intelligence, but rather for financial purposes. While there is one government victim, this likely appears\nto be collateral damage.\n\nAs the hack tools include detailed documentation, it’s likely that there is more than one person performing\nthe attacks, as a single attacker would not need to document their own tools. Based on the few concurrent\ninfections, Butterfly may be made up of a small number of attackers, perhaps between three and ten people.\nIt is also easier to maintain good operational security with a small number of people.\n\nThe attackers are well resourced, given that they have access to at least one zero-day (the Java exploit), and\npossibly more (potential Internet Explorer 10 zero-day exploit). Their access to zero-day exploits implies that\nthey either have the funding to purchase a zero-day or the technical skills to identify and exploit undiscovered\nvulnerabilities.\n\nIf the Butterfly group is small, then it would make more sense to utilize people with a general skill set, rather\nthan individuals who specialize in exploit discovery. This implies that the purchase of zero-day exploits is more\nlikely. Along with this, if Butterfly is a professional group of hackers who work against deadlines and has internal\ngoals, that would imply the need to be able to access zero-day exploits on demand. That would mean purchasing\nthem, rather than waiting for a team member to discover one.\n\nAt least some of the Butterfly attackers appear to be native English speakers, based on the help documentation\nin the hack tools and the use of memes and colloquialisms. It is possible that these English speakers are based in\nthe US, judging from the time zone set on the C&C server. However, this seems like a very basic mistake for the\nattackers to make, considering how they have demonstrated great attention to detail in most aspects of\ntheir operations.\n\nSome attribution theories that may fit the evidence and conclusions are as follows:\n\n        - This is economic espionage by a government agency\n\n         - This is an organization made up of hackers-for-hire\n\n         - This is an organization with a single customer\n\nA government agency is the least likely of these theories, given the number of victims that span across various\ngeopolitical boundaries and the lack of targeting of any victims that are related to traditional\nintelligence-gathering. It is far more likely that the Butterfly attackers are an organization of individuals working\nclosely together to either steal intellectual property for another client or for their own financial gain, for example\nthrough the stock market.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\n## Organizations need to be aware of the threat that corporate espionage groups like Butterfly can pose\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nButterfly is a skilled, persistent, and effective attack group which has been active since at least March 2012.\nThey are well resourced, using at least one or possibly two zero-day exploits. Their motivation is very likely\nto be financial gain and given that they have been active for at least three years, they must be successful at\nmonetizing their operation.\n\nBased on our analysis, the Butterfly attackers are likely a small team that steals data either as a service to\nanother client or to monetize it themselves through insider trading. Symantec believes that some members of\nButterfly are native English speakers, given some of the colloquialisms and Western meme references included\nin their infrastructure.\n\nThe Butterfly attackers represent a threat to organizations involved in technology, pharmaceutical, law,\ninvestment, energy and natural resources. However, over the past three years, the attackers have demonstrated\nthat they can change their targets quickly, as they moved to include commodities in their list of targets in 2014.\nClearly, the Butterfly attackers will go where the money is.\n\nOrganizations need to be aware of the threat that corporate espionage groups like Butterfly can pose. The attack\ngroup or their potential clients may have strong knowledge on how to leverage the stolen data to unfairly make\ngains in the market.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Protection\n\nSymantec customers are protected against the Butterfly attacker toolset with the following signatures.\nAdditionally, YARA signatures and other indicators of compromise (IoCs) are listed in the appendix.\n\n###### Antivirus\n\n           - Backdoor.Jiripbot\n\n           - Hacktool.Multipurpose\n\n           - Hacktool.Securetunnel\n\n           - Hacktool.Eventlog\n\n           - Hacktool.Bannerjack\n\n           - Hacktool.Proxy.A\n###### IPS\n\n           - System Infected: Backdoor.Jiripbot DGA Activity\n\n           - System Infected: Backdoor.Jripbot Activity\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX\n\n\n-----\n\n|iption of Backdoor.Jiripbot|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Table 1.

This is likely an attempt to avoid\nautomation engines.\n\nTo perform any activity, the samples need to be executed with a command line argument that begins with ‘http’.\nThis value is encrypted and stored in the registry; the registry location varies based on the sample. Each sample\nfirst encrypts the URL using RC4 with a hard-coded key. It should be noted that the hard-coded key is stored in\nthe binary as a wide character string, but is converted to a multibyte character string before the key is used.\nThis conversion will vary based on the region of the system executing the code.\n\nThe malware takes exactly one command line argument, but the single command line argument has a structure\nthat is manually parsed by the malware. The structure of the command line argument is as follows:\n```\n           “http://[DOMAIN NAME].com /opts opt=val,opt=val...”\n\n```\nWhere “opt” is one of the following:\n\n        - vm: Set to a number. “2” will disable vmware checks\n\n        - proxy_username: HTTP proxy user name to use\n\n        - proxy_password: HTTP proxy password to use\n\n        - proxy_host: HTTP proxy host to use\n\n        - proxy_port: HTTP proxy port to use\n\n         - resolv: Host name to resolve to\n\n        - delay: Number of delay loops to execute\n\n         - sleeptime: Number of seconds to sleep at certain points in the code\n\n        - cnx: Parameter that modifies how C&C server is interacted with\n\nOnce the URL from the command line is RC4-encrypted, it is encrypted a second time using the\ncrypt32!CryptProtectData API, with “OptionalEntropy” set to the ASCII string ‘AYBABTU’ (this is the acronym for\nthe phrase “All your base are belong to us”). The use of crypt32!CryptProtectData ensures that if the encrypted\ndata is retrieved from an infected computer, it is very hard to decrypt the data on another computer. The\ndocumentation for crypt32!CryptProtectData states:\n\n“Typically, only a user with the same logon credential as the user who encrypted the data can decrypt the data.”\n\nNext the malware examines its execution environment. It first checks to make sure that the file name it is\ncurrently running under is the same as the original name when the executable was created. It also looks for\ncertain process names of running processes. The process names it searches for are hashed, so we are not clear\nwhat it is looking for.\n\nIt checks that the hashed value of the registry subkey HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\\nCurrentVersion\\ProductId is not equal to a number of hashed values. It checks the hashed values of the registry\n\n\n-----\n\nkeys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE against a list of hashes. It also checks the registry subkeysHKEY_\nLOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\Disk\\Enum and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\\nDESCRIPTION\\System\\BIOS\\SystemProductName\n\n###### ‘resolv’ command\n\nWhen the resolv command line argument is set to a domain name, a domain name system (DNS) resolution\nrequest is made for that domain name with the current computer name and calculated UID value prepended to\nit.\n\nFor example, we observed the following:\n```\n           resolv=h30026.drfx.chickenkiller.com\n\n```\nWhen the sample is run with resolv set to that value, the following DNS query was observed:\n```\n           thread-2d9f4de5.1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350.h30026.drfx.\n           chickenkiller.com\n\n```\nIn this query, “thread-2d9f4de5” is the computer name and\n“1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350” is the calculated UID value. It is possible that the\nattackers use this method to exfiltrate the UID value, as the value is used in the DGA algorithm.\n\n###### UID/UPDATE_ID calculation\n\nThe UID is a unique ID calculated by the malware, as the following example shows:\n```\n           1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350\n\n```\nThis ID consists of the following elements:\n\n        - 14014: Hard-coded string in the malware. May be a version number\n\n        - 2: The operating system version\n\n         - 0: 0 indicates x86, 1 indicates x86_64\n\n         - 000c29bfea70: This is the last six bytes of the UUID generated by a call to rpcrt4!UuidCreateSequential. This\n\ncorresponds to the media access control (MAC) address of the infected computer.\n\n         - f49b94b8: This is the first eight bytes of the volume serial number from a call to\n\nkernel32!GetVolumeInfomationW\n\n        - 25e3e758: This is a dword hash of the string “[COMPUTER NAME]\\[USER NAME]” using the current values\n\nfrom the computer name and user name\n\n        - 6ce61350: This is a hard-coded dword in the binary\n\nFor the operating system (the number at offset 5 in previous UID example), the complete table is:\n\n        - 0: Unknown/Error/Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2012 R2\n\n        - 1: Windows 2000\n\n        - 2: Windows XP\n\n        - 3: Windows 2003, Windows XP Pro x64, Windows Home Server, Windows 2003 R2\n\n        - 4: Windows Vista\n\n        - 5: Windows Server 2008\n\n        - 6: Windows 7\n\n        - 7: Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012\n\n        - 8: Windows 8\n\n###### Installation\n\nThe following registry subkeys may be used by Butterfly to maintain persistence:\n\n       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Adobe\\Preferences\n\n       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Adobe\\Options\n\n       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Adobe\\UID\n\n\n-----\n\n       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Acer\\UPDATE_ID\n\n       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Acer\\Preferences\n\n       - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Acer\\Options\n\n        - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Acer LiveUpdater (likely named\n\nLiveupdater.exe)\n\n        - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Adobe Flash Plugin Updater\n\n(FlashUtil.exe)\n\nThe registry data stored in the “Preferences” and “Options” subkeys are REG_BINARY keys and the data within is\nencrypted using RC4 and crypt32!CryptProtectData, as described previously. The registry data stored in the UID\nis not encrypted; it is stored in plain text.\n\nThe value of “Preferences” is the encrypted version of the first command line argument used to first start the\nmalware. For example, if the malware is launched as:\n```\n           FlashUtil.exe “http://[DOMAIN NAME].com /opts vm=2”\n\n```\nThe value of “Preferences” will be:\n```\n           “http://[DOMAIN NAME].com /opts vm=2.”\n\n```\nThe value of “Options” is the URL from the command line argument, so for the previous example, the value\nwould be:\n```\n           “http://[DOMAIN NAME].com”\n\n###### Networking\n\n DGA Algorithm\n\n```\nThe DGA computes a URL similar to the following:\n\n        - http://jdk.MD5([MM].[YYYY].[UID AS WIDE-CHARACTER STRING]).org\n\n[MM] is the current month and [YYYY] is the current year. Note that the value of [UID AS WIDE-CHARACTER\nSTRING] is the value of the UID registry entry, but as a wide characters, so “07.2014.140...” would be “0\\x007\\\nx00.\\x002\\x000\\x001\\x004\\x00.\\x001\\x004\\x000\\x00...” for the purposes of the MD5 calculation.\n\nFor example, on July 22, 2014 on a system with the UID set to\n“1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350”, the DGA URL would be:\n\n        - http://jdk.MD5(\\’07.2014.1401420000c29bfea70f49b94b825e3e7586ce61350\\’).org\n\nFinally:\n\n        - http://jdk.20e8ad99287f7fc244651237cbe8292a.org\n\nNote that some samples use HTTPS instead of HTTP.\n\n###### C&C commands\n\nThe following commands implement back door functionality.\n\n        - cd: Changes current working directory\n\n         - exec: Executes a file using cmd.exe\n\n         - install: Sets the registry subkey for persistence. The registry subkey is only set if this command is sent\n\n        - quit: Ends the back door session\n\n        - sleeptime: Sets the sleep time between C&C queries\n\n         - shred: Overwrites file multiple times to perform a forensic-safe delete. Only found in samples with a PE\n\ntimestamp in 2014\n\n        - sysinfo: Gathers and reports system information\n\n         - uninstall: Uninstalls itself\n\n\n-----\n\n        - update: Updates itself\n\n         - url: Updates C&C URL in registry (although this feature appears to be disabled)\n\n        - wget: Downloads file to infected computer\n\n###### Decryption keys\n\nThe following MD5s used the corresponding keys for decryption:\n\n       - 95ffe4ab4b158602917dd2a999a8caf8: 0xb4\n\n       - 531f2014a2a9ba4ddf3902418be23b52: 0xa9\n\n       - a0132c45e8afe84091b7b5bf75da9037: 0xa9\n\n       - 1d5f0018921f29e8ee2e666137b1ffe7: 0xa9\n\nThere is a string in all of the binaries equal to “la revedere”, which is “goodbye” in Romanian.\n\n###### Hacktool help descriptions\n\n
