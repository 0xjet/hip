    "plain_text": "# Sweden drops Russian hacking investigation due to legal complications\n\n**[therecord.media/sweden-drops-russian-hacking-investigation-due-to-legal-complications/](https://therecord.media/sweden-drops-russian-hacking-investigation-due-to-legal-complications/)**\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\nThe Swedish government dropped today its investigation into the 2017 hack of its sports\nauthority, citing the legal constraints that would have prevented prosecutors from charging\nthe Russian hackers responsible for the intrusion, which officials claimed were mere pawns\noperating on behalf of a “foreign power.”\n\nThis marks the first time that such a legal clause is cited by prosecutors investigating cyberespionage hacking groups.\n\n## SSC hack part of Russia’s anti-WADA campaign\n\nToday’s statement from the Swedish Prosecution Authority also marks the first time that\nSwedish officials formally blamed the Russian government for the 2017 hack of the Swedish\nSports Confederation (SSC).\n\nCiting a recently-concluded investigation from the Swedish Security Service, which also\ninvolved foreign intelligence services, Swedish prosecutors said that one of Russia’s military\nhacker groups breached its sports body between December 2017 and May 2018 and stole\nmedical records for Swedish athletes.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe investigation shows that the Russian military intelligence, GRU who, via its 85th\n**Center, also known as unit 26165, has planned and carried out the serious breaches of data**\nsecrecy against the Swedish Sports Confederation,” public prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said\ntoday.\n\nLjungqvist said the SSC hack was part of a larger Russian hacking campaign that targeted\nsports bodies all over the world, including national and international anti-doping\norganizations such as WADA, USADA, and FIFA.\n\nRussian military hackers stole athletes’ medical records and then published the information\nonline.\n\nPosing as a hacktivist group, the Russian hackers claimed they were exposing a secret\nconspiracy in sporting federations across the world that allowed certain professional athletes\nto take doping substances using medical conditions as an excuse.\n\n“The information has been published openly and, based on these details, Swedish media\nhave written articles which follow GRU’s narrative of discrediting athletes and sports\norganisations in the West,” Ljungqvist said.\n\nBut the hacking campaign was later exposed as a Russian influence operation orchestrated\nby the Russian government through its GRU service as revenge after Russian athletes had\n[been banned from the Rio Olympics after a whistleblower exposed a Russian state-backed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia#2010%E2%80%932014:_allegations_of_state-sponsored_doping_and_2014_ARD_documentary)\ndoping program in a 2014 ARD documentary.\n\n## Sweden says there’s no legal background to prosecute state hackers\n\nThe hacks touched many countries around the world, and the US Department of Justice filed\n[legal charges against seven GRU intelligence service members in October 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-gru-officers-international-hacking-and-related-influence-and)\n\nBut Ljungqvist said today that Swedish authorities wouldn’t be following the US lead’s on this\ncase, citing that the hackers acted on behalf of “a foreign power.”\n\nAs such, Ljungqvist says there is no legal backing to support Swedish authorities in charging\nthe hackers and requesting their extradition to face charges for their crimes.\n\nThis marks the first time that a country claims it can’t file charges against hackers acting on\nbehalf of a government due to a lack of legal background.\n\nUntil now, countries like [Germany and](https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-authorities-charge-russian-hacker-for-2015-bundestag-hack/) [the US are the only ones who formally charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\nRussian state hackers for intrusions carried out against their networks. Countries like the UK,\nAustralia, New Zealand, Canada, and Norway have blamed Russian state hackers for\nattacks against their infrastructure but have not yet formally filed charges against specific\nindividuals.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Smart political maneuver on the part of Swedish officials\n\nIn an online conversation today, [Stefan Soesanto, Senior Cyber Defence Researcher at the](https://twitter.com/iiyonite)\nCenter for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, told\n_The Record that he agreed with the Swedish government’s decision._\n\n“The way I interpret Ljungqvist announcement is that simply because the GRU (i.e., a foreign\npower) conducted the operation, there is (a) a zero chance of success for requesting\nextradition of the GRU operators from Moscow so they can be prosecuted on Swedish soil.\nAnd (b) there is literally zero chance that the Russian public prosecutor will open up a case\nand charge the GRU operatives if the Swedish Sports Confederation (or the Swedish\ngovernment) goes to court in Russia,” Soesanto told us.\n\nIn that sense all the legal avenues for successfully prosecuting the GRU operators are\nnon-existent.\n\n_Stefan Soesanto, Senior Cyber Defence Researcher at the Center for Security Studies_\n_at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich_\n\n“In my opinion that is a very realistic assessment by Ljungqvist, which also additionally helps\nthe Swedish government to avoid unnecessary political confrontation with Moscow over an\nincident that happened four years ago,” Soesanto added.\n\n“Granted, the Swedes could have gone the US and German route, but then again, those\napproaches have not resulted in the successful extradition and prosecution of GRU\noperators either.”\n\n_Article updated with comments from Mr. Soesanto._\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[GRU](https://therecord.media/tag/gru/)\n[hacking](https://therecord.media/tag/hacking/)\n[legal](https://therecord.media/tag/legal/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[Sweden](https://therecord.media/tag/sweden/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
