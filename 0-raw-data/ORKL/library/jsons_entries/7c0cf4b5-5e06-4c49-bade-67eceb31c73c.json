Hacker gangs breach or rent access to a\nhacked network, take manual control of the infected host, spread laterally through the network, and then deploy the ransomware after they've\nmaximized their access.\n\n\n-----\n\nt e case o o oc, t e says t s g oup ga s access to ac ed et o s a t e Qa bot (Qbot) t oja Cybe secu ty G oup\nreported seeing the same thing last week.\n\nThis relationship between the operator of a malware dropper and a ransomware gang is not unique. It's been seen before with the Ryuk and\nMaze ransomware strains being installed on computers previously infected with TrickBot, and with DopplePaymer strains being dropped on\ncomputers infected with Dridex.\n\nAt the time of writing, it is unclear if the ProLock ransomware was created and managed by the Qakbot gang, or if the ProLock gang rents\naccess to Qakbot-infected hosts part of a Crimeware-as-a-Service scheme.\n\nTaking into account the FBI and Group-IB reports, this now also means that computers inside an organization that have been found to be\n**infected with Qakbot** **must be isolated from the rest of the network as soon as possible, as they can serve as entry points for a**\n**ransomware gang.**\n\n### ProLock decrypter not working properly\n\nIn addition to warning about the relationship between Qakbot and ProLock, the FBI also warned victims about bugs in the ProLock decrypter,\nthe app the ProLock gang provides victims in order to decrypt their files after paying the ransom.\n\n\"The decryption key or 'decryptor' provided by the attackers upon paying the ransom has not routinely executed correctly,\" the FBI said.\n\n\"The decryptor can potentially corrupt files that are larger than 64MB and may result in file integrity loss of approximately 1 byte per 1KB over\n100MB.\"\n\nThe FBI says that the decrypter may sometimes need to be modified to work correctly, incurring additional costs from lost business to\n[organizations. This is reminiscent of the decryption bugs previously found in the Ryuk ransomware.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ryuk-ransomware-contains-a-bug-causing-data-loss-for-some-victims/)\n\nThe ProLock ransomware was first spotted in March 2020. It initially went under the name of PwndLocker but rebranded into ProLock after\n[Emsisoft found a way to decrypt files locked by the first version.](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/35879/pwndlocker-ransomware-decryption-now-available/)\n\n[Sources told ZDNet that the FBI sent the flash alert to US organizations after ATM giant Diebold Nixdorf was infected with ProLock at the end](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/ransomware-hit-atm-giant-diebold-nixdorf/)\nof April.\n\n_A copy of the FBI flash security alert can be found_ _[here.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6893302-FBI-FLASH-TLP-Green-Indicators-of-Compromise.html)_\n\n**The FBI's most wanted cybercriminals**\n\n\n-----",
