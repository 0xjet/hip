See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework_ _for all referenced_\n_threat actor techniques._\n\n**Note: the analysis in this joint cybersecurity advisory is ongoing, and the information provided should**\nnot be considered comprehensive. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will\nupdate this advisory as new information is available.\n\nThis joint cybersecurity advisory was written by CISA with contributions from the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI).\n\nCISA has recently observed advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting multiple legacy\n[vulnerabilities in combination with a newer privilege escalation vulnerability—CVE-2020-1472—in](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472)\nWindows Netlogon. The commonly used tactic, known as vulnerability chaining, exploits multiple\nvulnerabilities in the course of a single intrusion to compromise a network or application.\n\nThis recent malicious activity has often, but not exclusively, been directed at federal and state, local,\ntribal, and territorial (SLTT) government networks. Although it does not appear these targets are\nbeing selected because of their proximity to elections information, there may be some risk to elections\ninformation housed on government networks.\n\nCISA is aware of some instances where this activity resulted in unauthorized access to elections\nsupport systems; however, CISA has no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been\ncompromised. There are steps that election officials, their supporting SLTT IT staff, and vendors can\ntake to help defend against this malicious cyber activity.\n\n_To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact_\n_your local FBI field office at_ _www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at_\n_(855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at_ _CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information_\n_regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of_\n_equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of_\n_contact. To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at_\n_Central@cisa.dhs.gov._\n\n_This document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited.

CISA is aware of multiple cases where the Fortinet\n[FortiOS Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN vulnerability CVE-2018-13379](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379) has been exploited to gain\naccess to networks. To a lesser extent, CISA has also observed threat actors exploiting the\n[MobileIron vulnerability CVE-2020-15505. While these exploits have been observed recently, this](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15505)\nactivity is ongoing and still unfolding.\n\n[After gaining initial access, the actors exploit CVE-2020-1472](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472) to compromise all Active Directory (AD)\nidentity services. Actors have then been observed using legitimate remote access tools, such as VPN\nand Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), to access the environment with the compromised credentials.\nObserved activity targets multiple sectors and is not limited to SLTT entities.\n\nCISA recommends network staff and administrators review internet-facing infrastructure for these and\n[similar vulnerabilities that have or could be exploited to a similar effect, including Juniper CVE-2020-](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1631)\n[1631, Pulse Secure CVE-2019-11510, Citrix NetScaler CVE-2019-19781, and Palo Alto Networks](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1631)\n[CVE-2020-2021 (this list is not considered exhaustive).](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021)\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n### Initial Access\n\nAPT threat actors are actively leveraging legacy vulnerabilities in internet-facing infrastructure (Exploit\n_[Public-Facing Application [T1190], External Remote Services [T1133]) to gain initial access into](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)_\nsystems. The APT actors appear to have predominately gained initial access via the Fortinet FortiOS\n[VPN vulnerability CVE-2018-13379.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379)\n\nAlthough not observed in this campaign, other vulnerabilities, listed below, could be used to gain\nnetwork access (as analysis is evolving, these listed vulnerabilities should not be considered\ncomprehensive). As a best practice, it is critical to patch all known vulnerabilities within internet-facing\ninfrastructure.\n\n     - [Citrix NetScaler CVE-2020-19781](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\n\n     - [MobileIron CVE-2020-15505](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15505)\n\n     - [Pulse Secure CVE-2019-11510](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510)\n\n     - [Palo Alto Networks CVE-2020-2021](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021)\n\n     - F5 BIG-IP CVE-2020-5902\n\n#### Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN CVE-2018-13379\n\n[CVE-2018-13379](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379) is a path traversal vulnerability in the FortiOS SSL VPN web portal. An\nunauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to download FortiOS system files through\nspecially crafted HTTP resource requests.[1]\n\n1 [https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n### MobileIron Core & Connector Vulnerability CVE-2020-15505\n\n[CVE-2020-15505](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15505) is a remote code execution vulnerability in MobileIron Core & Connector versions\n10.3 and earlier.[2] This vulnerability allows an external attacker, with no privileges, to execute code of\ntheir choice on the vulnerable system. As mobile device management (MDM) systems are critical to\nconfiguration management for external devices, they are usually highly permissioned and make a\nvaluable target for threat actors.\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nPost initial access, the APT actors use multiple techniques to expand access to the environment. The\n[actors are leveraging CVE-2020-1472 in Windows Netlogon to escalate privileges and obtain access](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472)\nto Windows AD servers. Actors are also leveraging the opensource tools such as Mimikatz and the\nCrackMapExec tool to obtain valid account [credentials from AD servers (Valid Accounts [T1078]).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)\n\n#### Microsoft Netlogon Remote Protocol Vulnerability: CVE-2020-1472\n\n[CVE-2020-1472 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), a](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\ncore authentication component of Active Directory.[3] This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated\nattacker with network access to a domain controller to completely compromise all AD identity services\n(Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts [[T1078.002]). Malicious actors can leverage this vulnerability to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002/)\n[compromise other devices on the network (Lateral Movement [TA0008]).](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/)\n\n### Persistence\n\nOnce system access has been achieved, the APT actors use abuse of legitimate credentials (Valid\n_[Accounts [T1078]) to log in via VPN or remote access services (External Remote Services [T1133]) to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)_\nmaintain persistence.\n\n## MITIGATIONS\n\nOrganizations with externally facing infrastructure devices that have the vulnerabilities listed in this\njoint cybersecurity advisory, or other vulnerabilities, should move forward with an “assume breach”\nmentality. As initial exploitation and escalation may be the only observable exploitation activity, most\nmitigations will need to focus on more traditional network hygiene and user management activities.\n\n### Keep Systems Up to Date\n\nPatch systems and equipment promptly and diligently. Establishing and consistently maintaining a\nthorough patching cycle continues to be the best defense against adversary TTPs. See table 1 for\npatch information on CVEs mentioned in this report.\n\n2 [https://www.mobileiron.com/en/blog/mobileiron-security-updates-available](https://www.mobileiron.com/en/blog/mobileiron-security-updates-available)\n\n3 [https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n|Col1|Table 1: Patch information for CVEs|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Vulnerability|Vulnerable Products|Patch Information|\n|CVE-2018-13379|• FortiOS 6.0: 6.0.0 to 6.0.4 • FortiOS 5.6: 5.6.3 to 5.6.7 • FortiOS 5.4: 5.4.6 to 5.4.12|Fortinet Security Advisory: FG-IR-18-384|\n|CVE-2019-19781|• Citrix Application Delivery Controller • Citrix Gateway • Citrix SDWAN WANOP|Citrix blog post: firmware updates for Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway versions 11.1 and 12.0 Citrix blog post: security updates for Citrix SD-WAN WANOP release 10.2.6 and 11.0.3 Citrix blog post: firmware updates for Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway versions 12.1 and 13.0 Citrix blog post: firmware updates for Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway version 10.5|\n|CVE-2020-5902|• Big-IP devices (LTM, AAM, Advanced WAF, AFM, Analytics, APM, ASM, DDHD, DNS, FPS, GTM, Link Controller, PEM, SSLO, CGNAT)|F5 Security Advisory: K52145254: TMUI RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-5902|\n|CVE-2019-11510|• Pulse Connect Secure 9.0R1 - 9.0R3.3, 8.3R1 - 8.3R7, 8.2R1 - 8.2R12, 8.1R1 - 8.1R15 • Pulse Policy Secure 9.0R1 - 9.0R3.1, 5.4R1 - 5.4R7, 5.3R1 - 5.3R12, 5.2R1 - 5.2R12, 5.1R1 - 5.1R15|Pulse Secure Out-of-Cycle Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities resolved in Pulse Connect Secure / Pulse Policy Secure 9.0RX|\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n|Vulnerability|Vulnerable Products|Patch Information|\n|---|---|---|\n|CVE-2020-15505|• MobileIron Core & Connector versions 10.3.0.3 and earlier, 10.4.0.0, 10.4.0.1, 10.4.0.2, 10.4.0.3, 10.5.1.0, 10.5.2.0 and 10.6.0.0 • Sentry versions 9.7.2 and earlier, and 9.8.0; • Monitor and Reporting Database (RDB) version 2.0.0.1 and earlier|MobileIron Blog: MobileIron Security Updates Available|\n|CVE-2020-1631|• Junos OS 12.3, 12.3X48, 14.1X53, 15.1, 15.1X49, 15.1X53, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 20.1|Juniper Security Advisory JSA11021|\n|CVE-2020-2021|• PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL)|Palo Alto Networks Security Advisory for CVE-2020-2021|\n|CVE-2020-1472|• Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64- based Systems Service Pack 1 • Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64- based Systems Service Pack 1 (Server Core installation) • Windows Server 2012 • Windows Server 2012 (Server Core installation) • Windows Server 2012 R2 • Windows Server 2016 • Windows Server 2019 • Windows Server 2019 (Server Core installation) • Windows Server, version 1903 (Server Core installation) • Windows Server, version 1909 (Server Core installation) • Windows Server, version 2004 (Server Core installation)|Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE-2020-1472|\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n### Comprehensive Account Resets\n\n[If there is an observation of CVE-2020-1472 Netlogon activity or other indications of valid credential](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\nabuse detected, it should be assumed the APT actors have compromised AD administrative\naccounts, the AD forest should not be fully trusted, and, therefore, a new forest should be deployed.\nExisting hosts from the old compromised forest cannot be migrated in without being rebuilt and\nrejoined to the new domain, but migration may be done through “creative destruction,” wherein as\nendpoints in the legacy forest are decommissioned, new ones can be built in the new forest. This will\nneed to be completed on on-premise as well as Azure-hosted AD instances.\n\nNote that fully resetting an AD forest is difficult and complex; it is best done with the assistance of\npersonnel who have successfully completed the task previously.\n\nIt is critical to perform a full password reset on all user and computer accounts in the AD forest. Use\nthe following steps as a guide.\n\n1. Create a temporary administrator account, and use this account only for all administrative\n\nactions\n2. Reset the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (krbtgt) password;[4] this must be completed before\n\nany additional actions (a second reset will take place in step 5)\n3. Wait for the krbtgt reset to propagate to all domain controllers (time may vary)\n4. Reset all account passwords (passwords should be 15 characters or more and randomly\n\nassigned):\na. User accounts (forced reset with no legacy password reuse)\nb. Local accounts on hosts (including local accounts not covered by Local Administrator\n\nPassword Solution [LAPS])\nc. Service accounts\nd. Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) account\ne. Domain Controller machine account\nf. Application passwords\n5. Reset the krbtgt password again\n6. Wait for the krbtgt reset to propagate to all domain controllers (time may vary)\n7. Reboot domain controllers\n8. Reboot all endpoints\n\nThe following accounts should be reset:\n\n     - AD Kerberos Authentication Master (2x)\n\n     - All Active Directory Accounts\n\n     - All Active Directory Admin Accounts\n\n     - All Active Directory Service Accounts\n\n     - All Active Directory User Accounts\n\n     - DSRM Account on Domain Controllers\n\n4 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/ad-forest-recovery-resetting-the-krbtgt-password](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/ad-forest-recovery-resetting-the-krbtgt-password)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n     - Non-AD Privileged Application Accounts\n\n     - Non-AD Unprivileged Application Accounts\n\n     - Non-Windows Privileged Accounts\n\n     - Non-Windows User Accounts\n\n     - Windows Computer Accounts\n\n     - Windows Local Admin\n\n### CVE-2020-1472\n\nTo secure your organization’s Netlogon channel connections:\n\n     - **Update all Domain Controllers and Read Only Domain Controllers. On August 11, 2020,**\n[Microsoft released software updates](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472) to mitigate CVE-2020-1472. Applying this update to\ndomain controllers is currently the only mitigation to this vulnerability (aside from removing\naffected domain controllers from the network).\n\n     - **Monitor for new events, and address non-compliant devices that are using vulnerable**\nNetlogon secure channel connections.\n\n     - **Block public access to potentially vulnerable ports, such as 445 (Server Message Block**\n\n[SMB]) and 135 (Remote Procedure Call [RPC]).\n\n[To protect your organization against this CVE, follow advice from Microsoft, including:](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4557222/how-to-manage-the-changes-in-netlogon-secure-channel-connections-assoc)\n\n     - [Update your domain controllers with an update released August 11, 2020, or later.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4557222/how-to-manage-the-changes-in-netlogon-secure-channel-connections-assoc#Updates%20section)\n\n     - Find which devices are making vulnerable connections by monitoring event logs.\n\n     - Address non-compliant devices making vulnerable connections.\n\n     - Enable enforcement mode to address CVE-2020-1472 in your environment.\n\n### VPN Vulnerabilities\n\nImplement the following recommendations to secure your organization’s VPNs:\n\n     - **Update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices being used to remote into work**\nenvironments with the latest software patches and security configurations.
