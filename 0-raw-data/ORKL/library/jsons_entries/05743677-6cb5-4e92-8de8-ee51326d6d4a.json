If you discover any suspicious or unusual activity on your accounts or\nsuspect identity theft or fraud, be sure to report it immediately to your financial institutions.\n\nIn addition, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or law enforcement, including your Attorney\nGeneral, to report incidents of identity theft or to learn about steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft. To\nlearn more, you can go to the FTC’s website, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (4384338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington,\nDC 20580.\n\nYou may also periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency. If you discover\ninformation on your credit report arising from a fraudulent transaction, you should request that the credit reporting agency\ndelete that information from your credit report file. In addition, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”),\nyou are entitled to one free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting\nagencies. You may obtain a free copy of your credit report by going to www.AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling (877)\n322-8228.

You can add a fraud alert to your credit report file to help protect your credit information. A fraud alert\ncan make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to\nprotect you, but it also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one\nof the three nationwide credit reporting agencies listed above. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will\nnotify the other two agencies, which then must also place fraud alerts in your file.
