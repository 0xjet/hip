It also shares noticeable\n[overlaps with the PlugX malware and has been put to use in high-profile attacks against NetSarang,](https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/chinese-hackers-implant-plugx-variant.html)\nCCleaner, and ASUS, causing the operators to shift tactics and update their defensive measures.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile initial campaigns that delivered ShadowPad were attributed to a threat cluster tracked as\n[Bronze Atlas (aka APT41, Barium, or Winnti Umbrella) – Chinese nationals working for a](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/axiom)\n[networking security company named Chengdu 404 – it has since been used by multiple Chinese](https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/apt41-hackers-wanted-by-fbi.html)\nthreat groups post 2019.\n\n[In a detailed overview of the malware in August 2021, cybersecurity company SentinelOne dubbed](https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/shadowpad-malware-is-becoming-favorite.html)\nShadowPad a \"masterpiece of privately sold malware in Chinese espionage.\" A subsequent\n[analysis by PwC in December 2021 disclosed a bespoke packing mechanism – named ScatterBee](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html)\n– that's used to obfuscate malicious 32-bit and 64-bit payloads for ShadowPad binaries.\n\nThe malware payloads are traditionally deployed to a host either encrypted within a DLL loader or\nembedded inside a separate file along with a DLL loader, which then decrypts and executes the\nembedded ShadowPad payload in memory using a custom decryption algorithm tailored to the\nmalware version.\n\nThese DLL loaders execute the malware after being sideloaded by a legitimate executable\n[vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking, a technique that allows the execution of malware by](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\nhijacking the method used to look for required DLLs to load into a program.\n\nSelect infection chains observed by Secureworks also involve a third file that contains the\nencrypted ShadowPad payload, which work by executing the legitimate binary (e.g., BDReinit.exe\nor Oleview.exe) to sideload the DLL that, in turn, loads and decrypts the third file.\n\nAlternatively, the threat actor has placed the DLL file in the Windows System32 directory so as to\nbe loaded by the Remote Desktop Configuration (SessionEnv) Service, ultimately leading to the\ndeployment of Cobalt Strike on compromised systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nIn one ShadowPad incident, the intrusions paved the way for launching hands-on-keyboard attacks,\nwhich refer to attacks wherein human hackers manually log into an infected system to execute\ncommands themselves rather than using automated scripts.\n\n[Additionally, Secureworks attributed distinct ShadowPad activity clusters, including Bronze Geneva](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/naikon)\n[(aka Hellsing), Bronze Butler (aka Tick), and Bronze Huntley (aka Tonto Team), to Chinese nation-](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/tick)\nstate groups that operate in alignment with the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force\n[(PLASSF).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Strategic_Support_Force)\n\n[\"Evidence […] suggests that ShadowPad has been deployed by MSS-affiliated threat groups, as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_State_Security_(China))\nwell as PLA-affiliated threat groups that operate on behalf of the regional theater commands,\" the\nresearchers said. \"The malware was likely developed by threat actors affiliated with Bronze Atlas\nand then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups around 2019.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
