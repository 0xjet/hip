The targeted employee used the\npassword management feature provided by the web browser to save and use the account\nand password for the VPN website on the web browser. While doing so, the PC was infected\nwith malware targeting account credentials, leaking accounts and passwords of various\nwebsites, which also included the VPN account of the company.\n\nRedline Stealer Targeting Accounts Saved to Web Browser with Automatic Login\nFeature Included\n\n\n-----\n\nThe system that had the account credentials leaked is the employee s PC, which is also\nused by the employee’s family members for other purposes. One of the family members\nsearched for SoundShifter, a pitch-shifting program from Waves, with the keywords free and\ncrack. The user then downloaded waves_60e87ffe7200b.zip file, which had a malicious file\nincluded, then executed the malicious and system was infected.\n\nFigure 1. Infection process of malicious file\nThe team has discovered the search history of the keywords waves soundshifter free and\nwaves soundshifter crack from the web browser history.\n\nFigure 2. Traces of searching illegal software in web browser\nSearching the keywords on Google shows various download websites on the search results.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n3. Google search results for waves soundshifter crack\nIt seems that the user visited multiple pages shown on the search result.\n\nFigure 4. Browsing history of websites shown on Google search results\nThere was also a trace of file download. As the process for visiting the download page was\nnot confirmed, it appears that the user manually accessed the malicious page shown on the\nsearch results. However, current search result does not show whether it is possible to do so.\n\nFigure 5. Trace of downloading illegal software\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded file is a compressed file that contains an encrypted compressed file and a\nTXT file that has the password for decompression. Such a method is used by attackers to\nbypass anti-malware detection that is run when the file is downloaded.\n\nFigure 6. Internal\n\nstructure of downloaded compressed file (waves_60e87ffe7200b.zip)\nAs the user downloaded the file to install the software, the user would have read and\nfollowed the description written on TXT file, decompressing the encrypted file and executing\nthe malicious file disguised as an installer. The decompressed installer has multiple\nmalicious files inside. When it is installed, malicious files such as Danabot, Redline Stealer,\nand Vidar are created in the system. Analyzing the malicious files found in the system and\nrelated artifacts such as file path and file name showed that there were other nearly identical\nfiles distributed during a similar period.\n\nSuch cases also had malicious files disguised as installers of illegal software such as cracks\nor keygens that were distributed by being uploaded on file-sharing websites. Among similar\nmalicious files we found, the analysis result and many behaviors (folder path of a malicious\nfile created in the personal PC, folder name, naming rules of a malicious file, file creation\norder, etc.) of the malicious file distributed in the Keygen sharing website (topkeygen.com)\non June 2021 match those of the file discussed in this post.\n\nThe following figure shows a similarity of the location that the file is created.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Similarity in file created location between malicious file in breached personal PC\nand malicious file distributed in topkeygen\nAfter the malicious file was executed, the breached personal PC had traces of suspicious\nfiles being run such as cio.exe.com, orrore.exe.com, and certe.exe.com. But they could not\nbe secured as they were deleted after being run. Considering that the traces discovered in\nthe system are similar to those of the system infected with Redline Stealer type, it seems that\nthe malicious files all fall into the same category.\n\n**Traces of possible Redline Stealer infection confirmed in the system**\n\nUsing findstr.exe\nUsing 7Zip SFX compressed file (path: %Temp%\\7ZipSfx.000\\)\nName of malicious file (cio.exe.com)\nUsing double file extensions (.exe.com)\nScanning and collecting web browser credentials (Chrome, Login Data of Edge\nbrowser, Cookies, and Web Data)\n\nAs for scanning web browser credentials, Microsoft Windows Defender’s log file MPLog\ndetected a trace of the Login Data file recorded with account names and password of the\nweb browser being scanned by Orrore.exe.com on July 10th.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Trace of Orrore.exe.com accessing Login Data (MPLog-20210710-015710.log)\nThe account credentials saved on the website were leaked by Redline Stealer, and the list of\naccounts that were leaked includes the VPN website of the company and account &\npassword credentials.\n\nFigure 9. VPN website and account and password credentials saved in Login Data\nThe leaked account was used to breach the internal network of the company several months\nlater.\n\n**[IOC Info]**\n\nTraces of what is judged to be Redline Stealer were discovered in the breached system, and\nthe Hash of the malware could not be obtained as the malicious files have been deleted.\n\ncio.exe.com\n\norrore.exe.com\n\ncerte.exe.com\n\n18.188.253.6\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information/)\n\n\n-----",
