These installations utilize folders with the same blacklisted\nnames as listed above.\n\nWith the rising popularity of WSL, the Ryuk actors likely encrypted a Windows machine at\nsome point that also affected the *NIX system folders used by WSL. This would have\ncaused these WSL installations to no longer work.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey definitely have cases affecting WSL environments, which likely led them to blacklist\nNIX folders as they similarly do with the Windows ones. It is new to me and might explain\nwhy Ryuk and how Ryuk affects NIX machines via WSL,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\nAs the goal of most successful ransomware is to encrypt a victim's data, but not affect the\nfunctionality of the operating system, this change makes sense\n\nWith these folders being blacklisted, Ryuk eliminates an additional headache that they\nwould need to deal with for a paying customer whose WSL installations are ruined.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft adds support for WSL2 distros on Windows Server 2022](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-adds-support-for-wsl2-distros-on-windows-server-2022/)\n\n[Fake Windows 10 updates infect you with Magniber ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-windows-10-updates-infect-you-with-magniber-ransomware/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Blacklist](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/blacklist/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ryuk/)\n[Unix](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/unix/)\n[Windows 10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows-10/)\n[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows-subsystem-for-linux/)\n[WSL](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/wsl/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
