The Dashboards are preconfigured to provide immediate access and visibility into all known Mummy\nSpider and Wizard Spider indicators of compromise (IOCs) made available through commercial and open-source\nthreat feeds that users manage on ThreatStream.\n\n\nCustomers using ThreatStream, Anomali Match, and Anomali Lens are able to immediately detect any IOCs present in\ntheir environments and quickly consume threat bulletins containing machine-readable IOCs. This enables analysts to\nquickly operationalize threat intelligence across their security infrastructures, as well as communicate to all\nstakeholders if/how they have been impacted.\n\nAnomali recently added thematic dashboards that respond to significant global events as part of ongoing product\nenhancements that further automate and speed essential tasks performed by threat intelligence and security\noperations analysts. In addition to Mummy Spider and Wizard Spider, ThreatStream customers currently have access\nto multiple dashboards announced as part of our November quarterly product release.\n\nCustomers can integrate the Mummy Spider and Wizard Spider dashboard, among others, in the “+ Add Dashboard”\ntab in the ThreatStream console:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1] “#Emotet has almost doubled its botnet C2 infrastructure in the past 24 hours from 8 active C2s yesterday to 14\nactive C2s today…,” abuse.ch, accessed November 22, 2021, published November 16, 2021,\nhttps://twitter.com/abuse_ch/status/1460649241454563341; “Another Update on #Emotet E4 distro - We are now\nseeing URL based lures for the document downloads…,” Cryptolaemus, accessed November 22, 2021, published\nNovember 17, 2021, https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1460870766518484993.\n\n[2] Luca Ebach, “Guess who’s back,” cyber.wtf, accessed November 22, 2021, published November 15, 2021,\nhttps://cyber.wtf/2021/11/15/guess-whos-back/; “Emotet is back.
