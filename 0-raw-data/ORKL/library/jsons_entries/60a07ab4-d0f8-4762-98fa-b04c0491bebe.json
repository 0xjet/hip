It’s scale and\nthe number of impacted systems is still unknown.\n\n[New #wiper malware being used in attacks on #Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wiper?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n1bc44eef75779e3ca1eefb8ff5a64807dbc942b1e4a2672d77b9f6928d292591\n\n[— Threat Intelligence (@threatintel) February 23, 2022](https://twitter.com/threatintel/status/1496578746014437376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nBreaking. [#ESETResearch discovered a new data wiper malware used in Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESETResearch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\ntoday. ESET telemetry shows that it was installed on hundreds of machines in the\ncountry. This follows the DDoS attacks against several Ukrainian websites earlier today\n1/n\n\n— ESET research (@ESETresearch) [February 23, 2022](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nToday’s event marks the second time this year that a data wiper was deployed on Ukrainian\ncomputer systems after [a first attack took place in mid-January.](https://therecord.media/microsoft-data-wiping-malware-disguised-as-ransomware-targets-ukraine-again/)\n\nThe deployment of that first malware (named WhisperGate) was hidden under the guise of a\nfake ransomware outbreak and during a series of coordinated defacements of Ukrainian\ngovernment websites.\n\nSimilarly, today’s data-wiping attacks were also accompanied by a series of distributed denial\nof service (DDoS) attacks against government websites, in a similar attempt to distract\ngovernment IT workers and the public’s attention.\n\n“Targets have included finance and government contractors,” Vikram Thakur, Technical\nDirector at Symantec Threat Intelligence, a division of Broadcom Software, told The Record\nin an email. Infections were reported from Ukraine, but some systems were also hit across\nLatvia and Lithuania.\n\n## Malware corrupts data, rewrites the MBR\n\nAt the time of writing, Ukrainian government officials have not confirmed or released any\ndetails about the ongoing attack.\n\n[However, according to a technical analysis of the malware, which ESET said it was tracking](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581908460941318)\nas HermeticWiper, the wiper is sometimes deployed via Windows group policies,\nsuggesting the attackers may have full control of some of their target’s internal networks.\n\n[Once deployed, the wiper runs a version of the EaseUS Partition Master software, a disk](https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html)\npartitioning utility, which it uses to corrupt local data and then reboot the computer.\n\nAccording to Silas Cutler, a security researcher for Stairwell, HermeticWiper doesn’t just\ndestroy local data, but it also damages the master boot record (MBR) section of a hard drive,\nwhich prevents the computer from booting into the operating system after the forced reboot\n—behavior identical with the WhisperGate wiper attack from last month.\n\n[I can confirm this damages a systems MBR. https://t.co/68B0V743lR](https://t.co/68B0V743lR)\n\n[— Silas (@silascutler) February 23, 2022](https://twitter.com/silascutler/status/1496583075442081794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nESET said today s attack was first seen around 16:52, Ukraine time. According to security\n[researcher MalwareHunterTeam, the malware appears to have been compiled just five hours](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1496584956935553024)\nbefore it was deployed in the wild, suggesting its code and operational infrastructure was\nmost likely set up and ready to go well in advance.\n\n_Article updated at 4am ET with new name for the malware and to add that Russia has_\n_formally declared war on Ukraine hours after this piece of malware was deployed, confirming_\n_theories that HermeticWiper’s primary role was to cripple local IT systems and prevent the_\n_Ukrainian government from reacting with its full capabilities. Almost 18 hours after it was_\n_deployed, it remains unclear if the malware succeeded._\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[data wiper](https://therecord.media/tag/data-wiper/)\n[HermeticWiper](https://therecord.media/tag/hermeticwiper/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[MBR](https://therecord.media/tag/mbr/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[Ukraine](https://therecord.media/tag/ukraine/)\n[WhisperGate](https://therecord.media/tag/whispergate/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
