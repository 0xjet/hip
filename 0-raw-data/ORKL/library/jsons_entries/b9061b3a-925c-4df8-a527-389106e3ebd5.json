We are\ntreating this matter with the highest priority and working with independent IT experts to\nconduct a thorough investigation and response.\"\n\n\"Early this morning, we became aware that an unauthorized intruder had disrupted access\nto some of our internal systems. Upon discovery and out of an abundance of caution, we\nshut down points of access to external systems and immediately began investigating and\nremediating the problem. We have since engaged outside IT security and forensics experts\nto conduct a detailed review and help us securely restore affected equipment. We are\nimplementing enhanced monitoring systems, and we have notified law enforcement,\" Bieri\nstated in an email to clients.\n\nBieri also stated that current investigations indicate that the attack was limited to Tyler\nTechnologies' local network.\n\n[In posts to the Municipal Information Systems Association of California (MISAC) forum](https://www.misac.org/)\nshared with BleepingComputer, local government employees were told that Tyler\nTechnologies suffered a ransomware attack affecting their phone ticketing system and\nsupport systems.\n\n\"We were told this morning from one of the support techs that they got hit with ransomware\nearly this morning on their corporate networks. Don't have any other details at this point\nother than support is down until they access their systems,\" one local municipality employee\nposted to the MISAC forum.\n\nAnother MISAC user stated that they heard the attack was limited to Tyler Technologies'\ninternal network and did not affect clients.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n## Tyler technologies hit by RansomExx ransomware\n\nCybersecurity sources familiar with the attack told BleepingComputer that Tyler\nTechnologies suffered an attack by the RansomExx ransomware.\n\nRansomExx is a rebranded version of the Defray777 ransomware and has seen increased\nactivity since June when they attacked the Texas Department of\nTransportation (TxDOT), [Konica Minolta, and most recently](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-technology-giant-konica-minolta-hit-by-new-ransomware/) [IPG Photonics.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-us-laser-developer-ipg-photonics-hit-with-ransomware/)\n\nWhile BleepingComputer has not obtained the ransom note, we found an encrypted\nfile [uploaded to VirusTotal today related to this attack.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/578070a600f417efa8fc117f0363947ce395ad8d2c15f06a68922d7c30bc5fca/detection)\n\nThis encrypted file has an extension of '.tylertech911-f1e1a2ac,' which includes Tyler\nTechnologies' name and is the same format used in other RansomExx attacks.\n\nRansomExx does not have a ransomware data leak site, but that does not mean they do\nnot steal unencrypted files before deploying their ransomware.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Tyler Technologies with further questions but has not\nreceived a response.\n\n_Thx to_ _[Fate112 for the tip!](https://twitter.com/tosscoinwitcher)_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Luxury fashion house Zegna confirms August ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/luxury-fashion-house-zegna-confirms-august-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Practice your development skills with lifetime access to DevDojo](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/practice-your-development-skills-with-lifetime-access-to-devdojo/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Developer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/developer/)\n[Public Sector](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/public-sector/)\n[RansomEXX](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomexx/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
