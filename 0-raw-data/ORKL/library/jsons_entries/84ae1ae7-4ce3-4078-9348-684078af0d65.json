Demers of the Justice\nDepartment’s National Security Division. “The Department will continue to confront malicious\nnation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the\nfamily of norms abiding nations to do the same.”\n\n“Today's unsealed indictment expands upon the FBI’s 2018 charges for the unprecedented\ncyberattacks conducted by the North Korean regime,” said the FBI Deputy Director Paul\nAbbate. “The ongoing targeting, compromise, and cyber-enabled theft by North Korea from\nglobal victims was met with the outstanding, persistent investigative efforts of the FBI in close\ncollaboration with U.S. and international partners. By arresting facilitators, seizing funds, and\ncharging those responsible for the hacking conspiracy, the FBI continues to impose\nconsequences and hold North Korea accountable for its criminal cyber activity.\"\n\n“The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and longrunning, and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,” said Acting U.S.\nAttorney Tracy L. Wilkison for the Central District of California. “The conduct detailed in the\nindictment are the acts of a criminal nation-state that has stopped at nothing to extract\nrevenge and obtain money to prop up its regime.”\n\n“This case is a particularly striking example of the growing alliance between officials within\nsome national governments and highly sophisticated cyber-criminals,” said U.S. Secret\nService Assistant Director Michael R. D’Ambrosio. “The individuals indicted today committed\na truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes: from ransomware attacks and\nphishing campaigns, to digital bank heists and sophisticated money laundering operations.\nWith victims strewn across the globe, this case shows yet again that the challenge of\ncybercrime is, and will continue to be, a struggle that can only be won through partnerships,\nperseverance, and a relentless focus on holding criminals accountable.”\n\nThe hacking indictment filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that Jon Chang\nHyok (전창혁), 31; Kim Il (김일), 27; and Park Jin Hyok (박진혁), 36, were members of units\nof the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), a military intelligence agency of the\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which engaged in criminal hacking. These\nNorth Korean military hacking units are known by multiple names in the cybersecurity\ncommunity, including Lazarus Group and Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38). Park was\n[previously charged in a criminal complaint unsealed in September 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe indictment alleges a broad array of criminal cyber activities undertaken by the\nconspiracy, in the United States and abroad, for revenge or financial gain. The schemes\nalleged include:\n\n**_Cyberattacks on the Entertainment Industry: The destructive cyberattack on Sony_**\nPictures Entertainment in November 2014 in retaliation for “The Interview,” a movie that\ndepicted a fictional assassination of the DPRK’s leader; the December 2014 targeting\nof AMC Theatres, which was scheduled to show the film; and a 2015 intrusion into\nMammoth Screen, which was producing a fictional series involving a British nuclear\nscientist taken prisoner in DPRK.\n**_Cyber-Enabled Heists from Banks: Attempts from 2015 through 2019 to steal more_**\nthan $1.2 billion from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta, and Africa\nby hacking the banks’ computer networks and sending fraudulent Society for\nWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messages.\n**_Cyber-Enabled ATM Cash-Out Thefts: Thefts through ATM cash-out schemes –_**\nreferred to by the U.S. government as “FASTCash” – including the October 2018 theft\nof $6.1 million from BankIslami Pakistan Limited (BankIslami).\n**_Ransomware and Cyber-Enabled Extortion: Creation of the destructive WannaCry_**\n2.0 ransomware in May 2017, and the extortion and attempted extortion of victim\ncompanies from 2017 through 2020 involving the theft of sensitive data and\ndeployment of other ransomware.\n**_Creation and Deployment of Malicious Cryptocurrency Applications: Development_**\nof multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications from March 2018 through at least\nSeptember 2020 – including Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, iCryptoFx, Union Crypto\nTrader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale –\nwhich would provide the North Korean hackers a backdoor into the victims’ computers.\n**_Targeting of Cryptocurrency Companies and Theft of Cryptocurrency: Targeting of_**\nhundreds of cryptocurrency companies and the theft of tens of millions of dollars’ worth\nof cryptocurrency, including $75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in\nDecember 2017; $24.9 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in\nSeptember 2018; and $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in\nAugust 2020 in which the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application\nas a backdoor.\n**_Spear-Phishing Campaigns: Multiple spear-phishing campaigns from March 2016_**\nthrough February 2020 that targeted employees of United States cleared defense\ncontractors, energy companies, aerospace companies, technology companies, the\nU.S.Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Defense.\n**_Marine Chain Token and Initial Coin Offering: Development and marketing in 2017_**\nand 2018 of the Marine Chain Token to enable investors to purchase fractional\nownership interests in marine shipping vessels, supported by a blockchain, which\nwould allow the DPRK to secretly obtain funds from investors, control interests in\nmarine shipping vessels, and evade U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the hacking indictment, which was filed on Dec. 8,\n2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and unsealed today, the three defendants\nwere members of units of the RGB who were at times stationed by the North Korean\ngovernment in other countries, including China and Russia. While these defendants were\npart of RGB units that have been referred to by cybersecurity researchers as Lazarus Group\nand APT38, the indictment alleges that these groups engaged in a single conspiracy to\ncause damage, steal data and money, and otherwise further the strategic and financial\ninterests of the DPRK government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\n**_Money Launderer Charged in California and Georgia_**\n\nFederal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of\nMississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean\nconspiracy, among other criminal schemes. Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge,\nwhich was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a\nprolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank\nheists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes.\nAlaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the\nU.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Georgia.\n\nWith respect to the North Korean co-conspirators’ activities, Alaumary organized teams of\nco-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained\nthrough ATM cash-out operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018.\nAlaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka “Ray Hushpuppi,” and others to\nlaunder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in\nFebruary 2019. Last summer, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles charged Abbas in a\nseparate case alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC\nfrauds and other scams.\n\n**_Accompanying Mitigation Efforts_**\n\nThroughout the investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department provided specific\ninformation to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as\ninformation about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the hackers with\nthe goals of remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct sharing of\ninformation took place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance\nof foreign law enforcement partners. The FBI also collaborated with certain private\ncybersecurity companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion TTPs\nused by the members of the conspiracy.\n\nIn addition to the criminal charges, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in collaboration with the U.S. Department\nof Treasury, today released a joint cybersecurity advisory and malware analysis reports\n(MARs) regarding North Korean cryptocurrency malware. The joint cybersecurity analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nand MARs highlight the cyber threat North Korea – which is referred to by the U.S.\ngovernment as HIDDEN COBRA – poses to cryptocurrency and identify malware and\nindicators of compromise related to the “AppleJeus” family of malware (the name given by\nthe cybersecurity community to a family of North Korean malicious cryptocurrency\napplications that includes Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet,\nCoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale). The joint cybersecurity\nadvisory and MARs collectively provide the cybersecurity community and public with\ninformation about identifying North Korean malicious cryptocurrency applications, avoiding\nintrusions, and remedying infections.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office and FBI also obtained seizure warrants authorizing the FBI to\nseize cryptocurrency stolen by the North Korean hackers from a victim in the indictment – a\nfinancial services company in New York – held at two cryptocurrency exchanges. The\nseizures include sums of multiple cryptocurrencies totaling approximately $1.9 million, which\nwill ultimately be returned to the victim.\n\nJon, Kim, and Park are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and\nabuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30\nyears in prison.\n\nIn relation to the case filed in Los Angeles, Alaumary has agreed to plead guilty to one count\nof conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years\nin prison.\n\nThe charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are\npresumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe investigation of Jon, Kim, and Park was led by the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, which\nworked closely with the FBI’s Charlotte Field Office. The U.S. Secret Service’s Los Angeles\nField Office and Global Investigative Operations Center provided substantial assistance. The\nFBI’s Cyber Division also provided substantial assistance.\n\nThe investigations of Alaumary were conducted by the U.S. Secret Service’s Savannah Field\nOffice, FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, and the U.S. Secret Service’s Los Angeles Field\nOffice and Global Investigative Operations Center. The FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division\nalso provided substantial assistance.\n\nThe case against Jon, Kim, and Park is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anil J.\nAntony and Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section, with\nsubstantial assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the Department of Justice National\nSecurity Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\n\n-----\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki are also prosecuting the case against\nAlaumary, in which the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the\nCriminal Division’s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) provided\nsubstantial assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki, along with Assistant\nU.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan of the Asset Forfeiture Section, also obtained the seizure\nwarrants for cryptocurrency stolen from the financial services company in New York.\n\nThe Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout these\ninvestigations, as did many of the FBI’s Legal Attachés, as well as foreign authorities around\nthe world. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance.\n\n\n-----",
