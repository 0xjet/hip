The attacker would then have to\nconvince the user to open the malicious document” - Microsoft\n\nHowever, the attack is thwarted if Microsoft Office runs with the default configuration, where\ndocuments from the web are opened in Protected View mode or Application Guard for\nOffice 365.\n\nProtected View is a read-only mode that has most of the editing functions disabled, while\nApplication Guard isolates untrusted documents, denying them access to corporate\nresources, the intranet, or other files on the system.\n\nSystems with active Microsoft’s Defender Antivirus and Defender for Endpoint (build\n1.349.22.0 and above) benefit from protection against attempts to exploit CVE-2021-40444.\n\nMicrosoft's enterprise security platform will display alerts about this attack as \"Suspicious\nCpl File Execution.\"\n\nResearchers from multiple cybersecurity companies are credited for finding and reporting\nthe vulnerability: Haifei Li of EXPMON, Dhanesh Kizhakkinan, Bryce Abdo, and Genwei\nJiang - all three of Mandiant, and Rick Cole of Microsoft Security Intelligence.\n\nIn a tweet today, EXPMON (exploit monitor) says that they found the vulnerability after\ndetecting a “highly sophisticated zero-day attack” aimed at Microsoft Office users.\n\nsource:\n\n[EXPMON](https://twitter.com/EXPMON_/status/1435309115883020296)\nEXPMON researchers reproduced the attack on the latest Office 2019 / Office 365 on\nWindows 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a reply to BleepingComputer, [Haifei Li of EXPMON said that the attackers used a .DOCX](https://twitter.com/HaifeiLi)\nfile. Upon opening it, the document loaded the Internet Explorer engine to render a remote\nweb page from the threat actor.\n\nMalware is then downloaded by using a specific ActiveX control in the web page. Executing\nthe threat is done using \"a trick called 'Cpl File Execution',\" referenced in Microsoft's\nadvisory.\n\nThe researcher told us that the attack method is 100% reliable, which makes it very\n[dangerous. He reported the vulnerability to Microsoft early Sunday morning.](https://twitter.com/HaifeiLi/status/1435320653503254534)\n\n## Workaround for CVE-2021-40444 zero-day attacks\n\nAs there is no security update available at this time, Microsoft has provided the following\nworkaround - disable the installation of all ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer.\n\nA Windows registry update ensures that ActiveX is rendered inactive for all sites, while\nalready available ActiveX controls will keep functioning.\n\nUsers should save the file below with the .REG extension and execute it to apply it to the\nPolicy hive. After a system reboot, the new configuration should be applied.\n\nAs updates are not available yet for the CVE-2021-40444, they have released the following\nworkaround that prevents ActiveX controls from running in Internet Explorer and\napplications that embed the browser.\n\nTo disable ActiveX controls, please follow these steps:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Open Notepad and paste the following text into a text file. Then save the file as\n\n**disable-activex.reg. Make sure you have the** [displaying of file extensions enabled to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/hiding-windows-file-extensions-is-a-security-risk-enable-now/)\nproperly create the Registry file.\n\n[Alternatively, you can download the registry file from here.](https://download.bleepingcomputer.com/reg/disable-activex.reg)\n```\n   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\n   Settings\\Zones\\0]\n   \"1001\"=dword:00000003\n   \"1004\"=dword:00000003\n   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\n   Settings\\Zones\\1]\n   \"1001\"=dword:00000003\n   \"1004\"=dword:00000003\n   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\n   Settings\\Zones\\2]\n   \"1001\"=dword:00000003\n   \"1004\"=dword:00000003\n   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\n   Settings\\Zones\\3]\n   \"1001\"=dword:00000003\n   \"1004\"=dword:00000003\n\n```\n2. Find the newly created disable-activex.reg and double-click on it. When a UAC\n\nprompt is displayed, click on the Yes button to import the Registry entries.\n3. Reboot your computer to apply the new configuration.\n\nOnce you reboot your computer, ActiveX controls will be disabled in Internet Explorer.\n\nWhen Microsoft provides an official security update for this vulnerability, you can remove\nthis temporary Registry fix by manually deleting the created Registry keys.\n\n[Alternatively, you can utilize this reg file to automatically delete the entries.](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/reg/enable-activex.reg)\n\n**Update [September 7, 2021, 16:46 EST]: Added comment received after publication from**\nHaifei Li of EXPMON, one of the researchers that reported the vulnerability to Microsoft.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Magniber ransomware gang now exploits Internet Explorer flaws in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/magniber-ransomware-gang-now-exploits-internet-explorer-flaws-in-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft finds severe bugs in Android apps from large mobile providers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-finds-severe-bugs-in-android-apps-from-large-mobile-providers/)\n\n[Get more from Microsoft Office with this training suite deal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/get-more-from-microsoft-office-with-this-training-suite-deal/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Zyxel fixes firewall flaws that could lead to hacked networks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zyxel-fixes-firewall-flaws-that-could-lead-to-hacked-networks/)\n\n[Critical F5 BIG-IP vulnerability exploited to wipe devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-f5-big-ip-vulnerability-exploited-to-wipe-devices/)\n\n[CVE-2021-40444](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cve-2021-40444/)\n[Internet Explorer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/internet-explorer/)\n[Microsoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[Microsoft Office](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-office/)\n[Mitigation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mitigation/)\n[Remote Code Execution](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-code-execution/)\n[Vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vulnerability/)\n[Workaround](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/workaround/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
