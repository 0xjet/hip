In total, we\nhave identified 1.3 million IPs used by infected Android devices. Last month, it was mostly\nspread in Germany and Spain. Additionally, we are tracking an increase in IPs over time,\nwhich likely indicates an increase in infected devices.\n\nFirst seen in early 2020, FluBot is a banking trojan used to steal banking, contact, SMS and\nother types of private data. Its operators have discovered creative means of distributing the\nmalware, evolving their social engineering tactics and delivery methods to fuel the continued\ngrowth and expansion of FluBot.\n\nFluBot gives threat actors full remote control of an infected device, including the ability to\n[send, intercept, and hide SMS messages and notifications; exfiltrate user sensitive data,](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/protecting-sensitive-data-4-things-to-keep-in-mind)\nsuch as contacts, keystrokes, one-time passcodes, and personal information; and carry out\noverlay attacks.\n\nThe malware is commonly spread via SMS messages to the contacts on an infected device\nas well as contacts downloaded from FluBot’s C2 server. FluBot typically appears as a\nmessage for package delivery. Below are some examples:\n\n## Malicious SMS Messages\n\n(source: [switch.ch)](https://securityblog.switch.ch/2021/06/19/android-flubot-enters-switzerland/)\n\n(source: [incibe.es)](https://www.incibe.es/protege-tu-empresa/avisos-seguridad/suplantan-empresa-paqueteria-distribuir-malware-sms)\n\n\n-----\n\n(source: [switch.ch)](https://securityblog.switch.ch/2021/06/19/android-flubot-enters-switzerland/)\n\n(source: [incibe.es)](https://www.incibe.es/protege-tu-empresa/avisos-seguridad/suplantan-empresa-paqueteria-distribuir-malware-sms)\n\n## Report: 3 out of 4 mobile applications evaluated contained at least one Moderate vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\n## Report: 3 out of 4 mobile applications evaluated contained at least one Moderate vulnerability\n\nGet BitSight’s latest research on mobile application security where you’ll find eye-opening\nstatistics on the state of mobile application security today, examples of how and why mobile\nbreaches occur, and actionable advice for mitigating risks associated with your own mobile\napplications, as well as apps from third-party partners and suppliers.\n\nDownload Report\nButton Arrow\n\n## BitSight’s Observations\n\nBitSight currently observes FluBot is mostly spread in Europe, specifically in Germany, Spain\nand Italy (74%), but also in Australia (7%). This appears to track with recent reports that\n[suggest Flubot operators specifically target different regions or countries. However, it may](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/new-flubot-and-teabot-global-malware-campaigns-discovered)\nalso be a function of how FluBot spreads. It stands to reason that the majority of a victim’s\ncontacts are people in the same region or country. So, regional infection may not be\nintentional per se, but rather a consequence of the malware’s design.\n\nBelow is a chart showing daily FluBot infections by country that BitSight has detected since\nMarch 2021, highlighting the consistent impact to German and Spanish users.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince BitSight began tracking FluBot, we have also seen an increase of impacted IPs. The\nnumber of IPs does not directly correspond to the number of infected devices, because a\nmobile device can share the same IPv4 address as other devices due to network address\ntranslation (NAT) and IPv4 exhaustion. However, a rise in IPs may be an indicator of rising\ndevice infections.\n\nThe following diagrams show our visibility into the geographical distribution of all FluBot\nversions in January 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn January, approximately 170,000 IPs (used by infected devices) contacted our sinkhole\ninfrastructure. The majority of those are infected with FluBot versions 4.8 and earlier. These\nversions communicate with its C2 server via HTTPS. Since version 4.9, FluBot has\n[communicated with its C2 server via DNS-Tunneling-over-HTTPS (DoH). Of the 170,000 IPs](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1463121699981996032)\nobserved in January, approximately 30,000 were infected with FluBot 4.9 through 5.2 (the\ncurrent version at the time of this writing).\n\nFluBot uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to be able to communicate with its C2\nserver. On version 5.1, there was an update on the DGA (python version on the IOCs\nsection). Changes include a new additional seed that is downloaded from the C2 server to\ngenerate more domains.\n\n## BitSight Exclusive: Ransomware for Dummies\n\n### Bring your strategic defense to the next level\n\n## BitSight Exclusive: Ransomware for Dummies\n\n### Bring your strategic defense to the next level\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware attacks globally nearly doubled in 2021. BitSight s Ransomware for Dummies\nbook reveals indicators of potential attacks, and how to minimize costly damage when\nsuccessful ransomware targets you.\n\nDownload eBook\nButton Arrow\nUsing these newer versions, an attacker sets a nameserver that will act as a C2 server,\nreceiving and sending data through the DNS protocol; FluBot uses DoH providers such as\nGoogle and Cloudflare to infiltrate and exfiltrate the data to the C2 server, allowing the\ninfected device to communicate with its C2 server without knowing its IP address.\n\nThe DNS provider routes the DNS request to the C2 server (nameserver), which returns a\nTXT DNS response as requested by the bot. The request contains a symmetric key\ngenerated by the bot that is RSA encrypted, and the private key is on the C2 server side.\n\nNote: The drop reflected in August is due to temporary collection issues.\n\n## Mitigating FluBot\n\nWhile FluBot operators do not appear to be specifically targeting organizations as opposed\nto individuals, it is still critical for security professionals to take appropriate steps to mitigate\nrisk.\n\nSince FluBot is spread using social engineering, employee education is essential. Share\nexamples of FluBot SMS messages and malicious lure pages so employees know what to\nlook for. Effective employee training can avert FluBot infection entirely.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnti-malware software should be considered essential to prevent, detect, and remove FluBot\ninfections. FluBot can be removed manually, however, manual removal may be timeconsuming—especially if the infection is widespread. Mobile device management (MDM)\nsolutions that can restrict the ability to install apps may be appropriate for some\norganizations, as well.\n\nBitSight has identified a number of indicators of compromise (IOC), which are detailed below:\n\n### FluBot samples (APKs)\n\ndf98a8b9f15f4c70505d7c8e0c74b12ea708c084fbbffd5c38424481ae37976f\n\n29d71a81bb8aa363d93adc9352e791720263935fb4c9cc0cfc20be0d1c6d3fdc\n\n8ef32886de7fb2fcfbde483044ef21a196ea5525df04e0f391ef491b62959de1\n\n5b404c066e702802b7475d2c2eecebd6fceb2490773f92d501d57b53de34213c\n\n4859ab9cd5efbe0d4f63799126110d744a42eff057fa22ff1bd11cb59b49608c\n\ndcb5e9c2f2c7c2a94b6419527361790132af20d60e681ca87c0c5257393cbac8\n\n4a49972ed962b5326b9edcb9edbfeef47d3a216cf5847d579eb0c69a3ed6b9be\n\nd1e40e321456c2a9e6d06c4e79961d388cd55050c055f47cdd9e0a2db571916b\n\naf83e659196774e779b22038e11c4b0a4665d082064fe997510634000fdb0222\n\na2d3292bb87f8d6b3ce4b45d9ae6d61b4b7398770f732b72c881f43b66a49461\n\n## FluBot DGA v3 implemented in Python\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nimport argparse\nfrom datetime import datetime\n# https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/java-random/blob/master/javarandom.py\nfrom javarandom import Random\ndef get_seed(init, year, month):\n  month = month - 1\n  j = ((year ^ month) ^ 0)\n  j2 = j * 2\n  j3 = j2 * (year ^ j2)\n  j4 = j3 * (month ^ j3)\n  j5 = (j4 * j4) % 2 ** 64\n  seed = j5 + init\n  return seed\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='FluBot DGA v3')\n  parser.add_argument(\n    '-s', '--seed', choices=[1949, 1945, 1813, 1136, 2931, 1642, 1905], type=int,\nrequired=True)\n  parser.add_argument(\n    '-y', '--year', help='default current year (YYYY)', type=int, required=False)\n  parser.add_argument(\n    '-m', '--month', help='default current month (MM)', type=int, required=False)\n  # parse arguments\n  args = parser.parse_args()\n  seedinit = args.seed\n  now = datetime.utcnow()\n  if args.year:\n    year = args.year\n  else:\n    year = now.year\n  if args.month:\n    month = args.month\n  else:\n    month = now.month\n  r = Random(seed=get_seed(seedinit, year, month))\n  tlds = ['ru', 'cn', 'com', 'org',\n      'pw', 'net', 'bar', 'host',\n      'online', 'space', 'site',\n      'xyz', 'website', 'shop',\n      'kz', 'md', 'tj', 'pw', 'gdn',\n      'am', 'com.ua', 'news', 'email',\n      'icu', 'biz', 'kim', 'work',\n      'top', 'info', 'br']\n  for i in range(2500):\n    domain = ''\n    for _ in range(15):\n      domain += chr(r.nextInt(25) + 97)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n    domain f {domain}.{tlds[i % len(tlds)]} \n    print(domain)\n\n## Get A Free Attack Surface Report\n\n Get A Free Attack Surface Report\n\n```\nRequest your free custom report and see how you can start reducing your cyber risk\nexposure across your digital ecosystem: cloud assets across all geos &\nsubsidiaries; discover shadow IT; security risk findings; and more!\n\nGet Your Report\nButton Arrow\n\n## Get the Weekly Cybersecurity Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to get security news and industry ratings updates in your inbox.\n\n\n-----\n\nRead more\nBy checking this box, I consent to sharing this information with BitSight Technologies,\nInc. to receive email and phone communications for sales and marketing purposes as\n[described in our privacy policy.
