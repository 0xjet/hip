At the time of writing, the countdown from the actor for publishing the files\nexpires in about three hours and a half.\n\nIn a report last month, industrial cybersecurity company Dragos notes that LockBit was the\nmost active [ransomware actor targeting the industrial sector last year, with 103 attacks,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-conti-most-active-ransomware-targeting-industrial-sector/)\nfollowed by the Conti gang with 63.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI in early February shared technical details and defense tips for LockBit ransomware\nattacks, noting that a bug in the malware allows showing a hidden debug window to view in\nreal-time the state of data destruction.\n\nBleepingComputer has reached out to Bridgestone Americas for a statement on the recent\nincident but did not hear back by publishing time.\n\n**Update [March 11, 16:36 EST]: Bridgestone Americas replied to BleepingComputer's**\nrequest for comments saying that it is working with Accenture Security \"to investigate and\nunderstand the full scope and nature of the incident\" and that they are analyzing to\ndetermine what data was stolen.\n\nThe full statement below:\n\n_On February 27, 2022, Bridgestone Americas detected an IT security incident. Since then,_\n_we have proactively notified federal law enforcement and are staying in communication with_\n_them. We are also working around the clock with external security advisors, Accenture_\n_Security, to investigate and understand the full scope and nature of the incident. We have_\n_determined this incident to be the result of a ransomware attack. We have no evidence this_\n_was a targeted attack. Unfortunately, ransomware attacks similar to this one are increasing in_\n_sophistication and affecting thousands of organizations of all sizes._\n\n_As part of our investigation, we have learned that the threat actor has followed a pattern of_\n_behavior common to attacks of this type by removing information from a limited number of_\n_Bridgestone systems and threatening to make this information public._\n\n\n-----\n\n_We are committed to conducting a swift and decisive investigation to determine as quickly as_\n_possible what specific data was taken from our environment. Bridgestone treats the security_\n_of our teammates, customers, and partners’ information with the utmost importance. We will_\n_continue to communicate with them often, working together to mitigate potential harm from_\n_these types of incidents and to further enhance our cybersecurity measures as_\n_recommended by our internal and external security advisors._\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 15th 2022 - Encrypting Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-15th-2022-encrypting-russia/)\n\n[LockBit ransomware gang lurked in a U.S. gov network for months](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-gang-lurked-in-a-us-gov-network-for-months/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
