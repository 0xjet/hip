Below we identify the likely source of the attacks\nas a botnet called Katana, with preparation for the attack starting at least as early as Sunday\n13th February.\n\n**Background**\n\n[On the 15-16th February a number of Ukrainian websites were taken offline due to](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/15/1080876311/ukraine-hack-denial-of-service-attack-defense?t=1645298414148)\n[Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.

Below are\ngraphs showing the increased traffic to two targeted banks during the attacks:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The increase in traffic_\n\n_to Oschad Bank and Privat Bank.

These messages were sent from Polish, Austrian and Estonian numbers._\nAccording to a report from the [Ukranian CERT, other activity was combined with the DDoS](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37139)\nand SMS messages in an attempt to maximise the impact. This included:\n\nA [denial of service attack against the .gov.ua DNS servers; and](https://hostmaster.ua/news/?pr20220216)\nA [BGP hijacking attack against the Privatbank IP space causing difficulties routing](http://bgpstream.com/event/287011)\ntraffic to their network.\n\n**Identifying The Source of the Attacks – Katana Botnet**\n\nAccording to the [Ukrainian CERT,](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37139) [360Netlab and](https://twitter.com/360Netlab/status/1493797519725367302) [BadPackets the source of these attacks is](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1493872304987664384)\na Mirai botnet with the command and control IP 5.182.211[.]5. The following two malware\nsamples talk to this IP:\n\n82c426d9b8843f279ab9d5d2613ae874d0c359c483658d01e92cc5ac68f6ebcf\n\nFilename: KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaa.mips Filesize: 148 KB\nThe [sandbox report records it communicating with the IP 5.182.211.5 on the port](https://tria.ge/220219-qrwslsadg3/behavioral2#report)\n[60195. This was the sample reported by Bad Packets.](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1493872304987664384)\n\n978672b911f0b1e529c9cf0bca824d3d3908606d0545a5ebbeb6c4726489a2ed\n\nFilename: a2b1d5g2e5t8vc.elf Filesize: 98 KB\n\n[The filenames (KKveTTgaAAsecNNaaaaa and a2b1d5g2e5t8vc) match a botnet named](https://github.com/saintly2k/katana/blob/0a8279f7aad45c2ea07c455196aa8bb0886c5fd1/katanastuff/payload.py)\n[Katana which is in fact a variant of Mirai with improved DDoS capabilities, as seen in the](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/katana-a-new-variant-of-the-mirai-botnet)\nKatana source code below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The source-code for Katana, showing the matching filenames._\nKatana is a fork of Mirai, originally available for purchase for 500 Euros but now freely\navailable online:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delivery**\n\nA number of vulnerable Avtech network cameras are publicly accessible and were exploited\nby the attacker to perform the DDoS. Due to how the exploit works, they show the records of\ntheir exploitation publicly. For example this XML file is being served from a compromised\ncamera on port 8080:\n\nA [file was uploaded to VirusTotal on Sunday 13th February matching these delivered attacks.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4569ab6e80aea8e59cffaeeedd89c907a583bead256d38bb753b280ae1093b3f/content)\nIndicating the attackers started compromising systems at least a few days before the DDoS\nattacks on Tuesday 15th February:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhilst the file rip.sh is no longer available to download, it’s part of the standard deployment\nfor Katana and would have been a simple installer for Katana such as this:\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\n\nWhilst the attacks were not particularly successful, the combination of a number of different\nmethods implies a level of sophistication above most DDoS attacks. The intention behind\nthese attacks can be seen in the context of previous malicious activity.\n\n[We previously reported on the defacement of Ukranian websites in January 2022, intended](https://www.cadosecurity.com/technical-indicators-of-ukrainian-website-defacements/)\nto create a sense of panic. And those who follow cyber-attacks in the region will be familiar\nwith the [DDoS attacks using](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattacks_during_the_Russo-Georgian_War) [BlackEnergy malware preceding the 2008 Georgian conflict,](https://securelist.com/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/73440/)\nand destructive attacks against Ukraine’s Power Grid in 2015.\n\nOn Wednesday Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, spoke to the\n[likely intention behind these attacks. He said “This attack was unprecedented, it was](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-16/ukraine-suffers-biggest-ddos-attack-on-record-in-russia-standoff)\nprepared well in advance, and its key goal was destabilization, sowing panic and creating\nchaos in our country,”.\n\nOn Friday, White House deputy national security adviser for cyber Anne Neuberger went\nfurther:\n\n\n-----\n\nThankfully, the websites were restored quickly and if the intention was to create a sense of\npanic, they failed.
