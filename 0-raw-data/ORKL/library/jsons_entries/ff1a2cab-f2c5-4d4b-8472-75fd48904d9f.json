Both\n\nglobal and local politics have an effect on the pricing of oil per barrel,\n\nthus affecting the profitability of oil companies. Physical attacks are\n\nalso a problem; just recently a drone attack on the world’s largest\n\nrefinery crippled 5% of the world’s global oil supply.[1]\n\nAll of these different risks have to be mitigated, and at first glance,\n\ncyberattacks may seem less urgent to oil and gas companies.\n\nHowever, because of increased automation, the growing connectivity\n\nof computer networks, and the increased usage of cloud computing\n\nservices, companies are more and more exposed to cybersecurity-\n\nrelated risks. To create a comprehensive security system and protect\n\ntheir assets on all fronts, oil and gas companies should be more aware\n\nof current cyberthreats and what they can do to defend themselves\n\nagainst these threats.\n\nIn this paper, we give an overview of known digital attacks against\n\nthe oil and gas industry and its supply chain. Current data shows\n\nthat persistent actors, using relatively simple methods, can cause real\n\nharm to companies involved in this industry and even bring about\n\ncircumstances that can affect world economies.\n\n\n-----\n\nLarge-scale cyber intrusions on oil and gas companies are not theoretical scenarios; real-world strikes\n\nhave been causing damage for years. In August 2012, one of the biggest oil companies in the world\n\nsuffered from an expansive cyberattack. Tens of thousands of the company’s computer servers were\n\nrendered unusable by the crippling wiper malware called Shamoon.[2] Although the supply of crude oil to\n\nthe world was not affected at the time, the Shamoon attack proved to be a real risk to world economies.\n\nThis watershed event was caused by destructive, yet relatively simple, malware.\n\nCyberthreats to oil companies seem to become more prevalent and urgent when political tensions rise. Oil\n\ncompanies are targets of cyberattacks that are rooted in political agendas and geopolitical concerns. For\n\nexample, recent incidents of unrest in the Gulf Region have cascaded into cyberspace, i.e. the internet.[3]\n\nThere has been increased interest in malware attacks that target not only the military and defense industry\n\nbut also the oil and gas industry. This activity has been going on for almost a decade already.\n\nAdditional destructive attacks on the oil industry continued between 2012 and 2019 with variations of the\n\nShamoon malware and a destructive wiper variant of the so-called StoneDrill malware. In 2018, it was\n\nreported that an Italian oil company suffered from a Shamoon wiper attack.[4] This time, a few hundred\n\ncomputer servers were hit. Around the same time, a British oil company reported it had suffered from a\n\nsecurity breach caused by a variant of known malware.[5]\n\nThere are several advanced actor groups or advanced persistent threats (APTs) that target the oil and gas\n\nindustry. In this paper, we describe some of the attack methods of an actor group that is commonly referred\n\nto as APT33 (also identified as Refined Kitten, Magnallium, and Elfin). APT33 is known to aggressively\n\ntarget the oil and gas and aviation industries and their supply chains.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, we observed that a U.K.-based oil company had computer servers both in the U.K. and\n\nIndia communicating with an APT33 command-and-control (C&C) server. Another European oil company\n\nalso suffered from an APT33-related malware infection on one of its servers in India for at least three\n\nweeks in November and December 2018. We also found that for at least two years, APT33 used the\n\nprivate website of a member of the national defense committee in the senate of a European country to\n\nsend spear-phishing emails to companies in the supply chain of oil products. Targets also included a\n\nwater facility that supplied potable water to a U.S. military base.\n\nIn this paper, we also include our findings on the multiple layers of obfuscation that APT33 puts up to run\n\nC&C servers they use in extremely targeted malware campaigns against targets in the Middle East and\n\nthe U.S.\n\nPawn Storm[6] is another threat actor group that has targeted the oil and gas industry. In particular, we\n\nhave seen reconnaissance attacks on email and VPN servers of oil and gas companies originating from\n\nthis group.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Infrastructure of a Typical Oil and Gas Company\n\nMost of the best understood attacks against the oil industry are initial attempts to break into the corporate\n\nnetworks of oil companies. We will discuss several of these attacks in this paper. At the outset, it is\n\nimportant to understand the complete oil and gas production chain and what risks are involved in those\n\nareas. This section will discuss these concerns in detail.\n\nThe production chain, from exploring oil to producing end products like gasoline for cars, is oftentimes\n\ndivided into three parts: upstream, midstream, and downstream. Processes that are related to oil\n\nexploration and production are generally referred to as upstream. Transportation and storage of crude oil\n\nthrough pipelines, trains, ships, or trucks are referred to as midstream. And downstream is the production\n\nof end products. Cyber risks are present in all three categories, but for midstream and upstream, there are\n\nfew publicly documented incidents.\n\nA typical oil company has production sites where crude oil is extracted from wells, tank farms where the\n\noil is stored temporarily, and a transportation system to bring the crude oil to a refinery. Transportation\n\nmay include pipelines, trains, and ships. After processing in the refinery, different end products like diesel\n\nfuel, gasoline, and jet fuel are transported to tank farms and the products are later shipped to customers.\n\nA typical gas company also has production sites and a transportation system like pipelines, railroads, and\n\nships. But it also needs compressor stations where the natural gas is compressed to a specific pressure\n\nto be ready for transport. The natural gas is transported to a separation plant that separates different\n\nhydrocarbon components from natural gas, like LPG and cooking gas. The different gasses are later\n\ntransported to customers using pipelines, trains, and ships.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the whole chain — from oil and gas production to refineries to the several hydrocarbon end products —\n\nconstant monitoring is crucial for performance measurement, performance improvement, quality control,\n\nand safety. Monitoring metrics include temperature, pressure, chemical composition, and detection of\n\nleaks. Some oil and gas production sites are in very remote locations where the weather can be extreme. In\n\nparticular for these sites, communication of the monitored metrics over the air, fixed (optic or copper) lines,\n\nor satellite is important. Likewise, remote control of on-site equipment such as valves, pumps, hydraulic\n\nand pneumatic control systems, safety instrumented systems (SISs), emergency stop systems, and fire\n\ndetection equipment are crucial. All of the systems are controlled by software and can be compromised\n\nby an attacker.\n\nAvailability of these systems is key and there is usually no incentive for confidentiality. The communication\n\nof both control messages and the monitoring data is oftentimes not encrypted and not even signed\n\nfor data integrity. This means that there are multiple theoretical attacks possible: sending attacker\n\ncommands to control systems, injecting commands, changing sensor data, and replay attacks, among\n\nothers. Fortunately, attackers are not likely to use these methods because the impact is limited by built-in\n\nmechanical safety measures that prevent hazardous situations. Also, many of these attacks would require\n\nthe actor to be close to the oil well or refinery. There are only a few public reports on compromises of\n\nindustrial control systems (ICSs) in the oil and gas industry, and some that describe attacks against SISs in\n\nrefineries.[7, 8]\n\nThe more urgent threats oil and gas companies are facing come from several advanced attacker groups\n\nwho are focused on this industry. Among these groups are the same actors who usually attack the military\n\nand defense industry. These attackers have geopolitical impact and espionage in mind, and in some\n\ncases are aiming to deploy destructive attacks.\n\nTheft of intellectual property and industrial espionage are dangerous threats to oil companies too. Among\n\nvaluable intellectual property typically held by these companies are the location of new proven oil reserves\n\nthat are not in production yet, techniques of effective drilling, and the chemical composition of additives\n\nin premium car gasoline.\n\nIn the succeeding sections, we will discuss the internet-related threats that are relevant to the oil and gas\n\nindustry. We will also give recommendations for defending oil and gas companies against each threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threats\n\nThe biggest threats the oil and gas industry have to worry about are those that have a direct negative\n\nimpact on the production of their end products. Aside from these, espionage is something the industry has\n\nto defend itself against as well. Actors may steal intellectual property through these compromises, and\n\nespionage can also be the starting point of destructive attacks or sabotage that may impact companies’\n\nproduct supply.\n\n### Infrastructure Sabotage\n\nAn important threat the oil and gas industry is facing is infrastructure sabotage. The initial action to\n\nsabotage infrastructure is the same as that for a usual advanced targeted attack: reconnaissance. The\n\nattacker first needs to collect information about the target and then use this information to compromise\n\nsystems or computer servers on the targeted network. The attacker does not need to maintain access\n\nto the system. The attacker may also try to remove all evidence of compromise while proceeding with\n\nthe sabotage.\n\nSabotage in this context can be done via different actions:\n\n - Altering the behavior of software\n\n - Deleting or wiping off specific content to disrupt the activity of the company\n\n - Deleting or wiping off as much content as possible on every accessible machine\n\nSome examples of these kinds of sabotage operations have been reported broadly, the most famous\n\nbeing the Stuxnet case.[9] Stuxnet was a piece of self-replicating malware that contained a very targeted\n\nand specific payload. Most infections of the worm were located in Iran and analysis revealed that it was\n\ndesigned to exclusively target the centrifuge in the uranium enrichment facility of the Natanz Nuclear Plant\n\nin the country. The malware targeted Siemens’ WinCC/PCS 7 SCADA control software specifically, and\n\nonly when it fit certain precise parameters in their configuration. It destroyed several nuclear enrichment\n\ncentrifuges, which lowered the productivity of the nuclear plant. Despite the fact that Stuxnet was developed\n\nwith one particular goal in mind, it did spread further within the oil industry (even without launching its\n\ndedicated payload).[10]\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother example is the malware Industroyer (aka Crashoverride).[11] This malware contains specific\n\npayloads for ICSs used in electric substations, although it can be refitted to target other types of critical\n\ninfrastructure. In addition to these payloads, it contains a data wiper part that can be triggered to erase\n\ndata and make systems unbootable.\n\nThe BlackEnergy malware is also of note. This malware evolved through time, from being a trojan to being\n\na new piece of malware delivering a payload known as KillDisk. It targeted the power facility Prykarpattya\n\nOblenergo and other electricity distribution companies in Ukraine. Research by Trend Micro also revealed\n\nthat it targeted a large Ukrainian mining company and a large Ukrainian railway operator,[12] showing that\n\nsuch modular malware could be used against different industries.\n\nThere is also the Triton malware, which was built to interact with Triconex SIS controllers and could,\n\namong other features, shut them down.[13]\n\nThe Shamoon (aka Disttrack) campaigns, which had at least three known waves of attack from 2012 to\n\n2018,[14] on oil and gas companies have been incredibly aggressive. The biggest target of these attacks,\n\na Saudi oil company, had about 30,000 computers rendered unbootable by the destructive malware.\n\nThe impact was significant since a lot of the oil company’s computer servers were disrupted for weeks.\n\nHowever, the world oil supply was essentially not affected by these attacks.\n\nWhile these examples show strong developer skills in terms of building specific malware, special malware\n\nis not always needed for attacks to be successful. Any remote access tool that could allow an attacker to\n\ngain access to a human-machine interface (HMI) for equipment would work. Also, there are cases when\n\nno outside attack is needed, as when the threat comes from within the company. The next section deals\n\nwith that danger: the insider threat.\n\n### Insider Threat\n\nAn insider — in most cases, a disgruntled employee seeking revenge or merely wanting to make easy\n\nmoney selling valuable data to competitors — can commit sabotage operations. Although there are\n\nseveral factors that can motivate a person to turn against their employer, revenge is the more dangerous\n\ntype since the individual could not care less which part of the company is targeted. Blackmail can also\n\nbe a motivation for an inside job.\n\nAn insider may do the following:\n\n- Altering data to create problems, misuse access, or cause damage\n\n- Deleting or destroying data from corporate servers, shared project folders, or any location the insider\n\nhas access to\n\n- Stealing intellectual property for the insider’s own use or for a competitor’s\n\n- Leaking sensitive corporate documents to third parties or competitors, or even uploading them to the\n\ninternet\n\n\n-----\n\nDefense against insider threats is very complex, since insiders generally have access to a lot of data. In\n\naddition, unlike an external attacker, an insider does not need months to know the internal network of the\n\ncompany — the insider probably already has knowledge of the inner workings of the organization. With\n\nthat knowledge, the insider probably knows how to inflict damage to the company’s business more than\n\nany external attacker.\n\nCareful monitoring of user activity can bring this kind of activity to light, but the task is still very difficult. It\n\nmight be difficult to distinguish the usual daily operations from sabotage actions — for example, simple\n\nactions like modifying a document or deleting a file could be part of a sabotage attempt.\n\n##### Espionage and Data Theft\n\nWhile sabotage of the daily operations is among the most damaging attacks on the oil and gas industry,\n\ndata theft and espionage are important threats the industry needs to be aware of as well. As mentioned\n\nabove, data theft and espionage can be the starting point of a larger destructive attack. Attackers often\n\nneed specific information before attempting further action. Obtaining sensitive data like well drilling\n\ntechniques, data on suspected oil and gas reserves, and special recipes for premium products can also\n\ntranslate to monetary gain for attackers.\n\nIn the next sections, we will discuss some of the advanced espionage and theft techniques and security\n\nconcerns that affect the oil and gas industry.\n\n##### DNS Hijacking\n\nDNS hijacking is a particularly dangerous attack used by a limited set of advanced attackers. The aim\n\nof DNS hijacking may include getting access to the corporate VPN network or corporate emails of\n\ngovernments and companies. This is particularly relevant for the oil industry, as we have seen a number of\n\noil companies being targeted by advanced attackers who probably have certain geopolitical goals in mind.\n\nIn DNS hijacking, the DNS settings of a domain name are modified by an unauthorized third party. The\n\nthird party can, for instance, add an additional entry to the zone file of a domain or alter the resolution of\n\none or more of the existing hostnames. The simplest things the attacker can do are committing vandalism\n\n(defacement), leaving a message on the hijacked website, and making the website unavailable. This will\n\nusually be noticed quickly and the result may just be reputational damage. However, there are more\n\ndangerous attacks possible, with a much bigger impact: theft of corporate credentials, interception of\n\nemails, VPN access to the corporate network, and launching a watering hole attack. Ultimately, these\n\nmay even lead to lasting access to the victim’s network by an unauthorized third party. An actor can, for\n\nexample, use the (short) time window of the DNS hijack to send internal malware-ridden emails using\n\ncredentials intercepted during the hijack.\n\n\n-----\n\nDNS hijacking attacks can happen by targeting registrants of a domain name. But many registrars and\n\nDNS providers have two-factor authentication in place for their customers. Two-factor authentication\n\nraises the bar significantly for a successful attack. More dangerous actors may use different tactics that\n\nthe domain owner cannot easily repel.\n\nOne possible scheme involves an actor not attacking the registrant of a domain directly, but instead the\n\nregistrar of the domain or even registries. More specifically, the actor can try to compromise the registrar’s\n\ncredentials for the management system that is used to push changes on domains to registries and DNS\n\nroot servers. Once the registrar is compromised, the actor can push specific changes for the domains\n\nthat are under control of the registrar. For example, the actor can change the legitimate authoritative\n\nnameservers to other nameservers under the actor’s control. Once that has succeeded, the actor can\n\npoint domains to a foreign IP he controls.\n\nWe have seen these attacks targeting mail servers of government agencies in particular, and there\n\nare serious possible compromise scenarios. When the attacker is also able to create a valid, new SSL\n\ncertificate of the hijacked domain, the attacker can even intercept SSL connections to the corporate\n\nservers and potentially intercept corporate credentials that are sent to a hijacked version of the IMAP\n\nserver. To create an SSL certificate of a domain the attacker doesn’t own, the attacker usually has to show\n\nownership of the domain. When the attacker is able to intercept emails to the domain owner, the attacker\n\nmay be able to fool a certificate authority and pose as the legitimate owner of a domain. With that, a valid\n\nSSL certificate may be issued.\n\nThere are ways to raise the bar for DNS hijack attacks. First of all, the use of multi-factor authentication will\n\nmake attacks more difficult, though not impossible. As explained in a talk by Bill Woodcock, the executive\n\ndirector of Packet Clearing House,[15] using Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation\n\nfor all email clients also helps. In the event that the IMAP server domain gets hijacked, the email clients\n\nwon’t make a connection to the foreign IP address as the DNSSEC validation fails. In his talk, Woodcock\n\nsays the use of mobile device management (MDM) is advised as well, to force mobile users who are not\n\nin the office to use the right recursive DNS servers that implement DNSSEC validation.\n\nWhile most DNS hijacking attacks[16] have happened against government organizations, some oil companies\n\nhave been affected too. Most likely, these oil companies fell victim to politically motivated attacks such as\n\nthe incidents that happened in 2018 and 2019 in the Middle East. These attacks might have resulted in\n\ninterception of emails, interception of corporate credentials, temporary access to the corporate VPN, and\n\neven semi-persistent access to the corporate network.\n\nThe risk of DNS hijacking can be further reduced by a couple of additional measures. First, a script can\n\ncheck the DNS records of the critical domains and hostnames of an organization frequently — every\n\nminute or as often as may be desired. By walking down the whole DNS hierarchy for crucial domain\n\n\n-----\n\nnames starting from the root servers, the script can quickly notice any unauthorized changes in the chain.\n\nIf this monitoring is done frequently enough, the potential damage can be limited significantly.\n\nOnce an organization has become a victim of a DNS hijack attack and the DNS settings have been restored to\n\nnormal, it is important to note that crucial information might have been stolen, such as corporate credentials.\n\nObviously, passwords should be reset. Also if, for example, the webmail or mail domain was hijacked, that\n\nmight have just been a way for the attacker to get into systems and get persistent access to the network with\n\nmalware or gain unauthorized VPN access. In that case, a full security sweep of the corporate network will\n\nbe necessary.\n\nDNS hijack attacks can also be used to plant an exploit on a hijacked website with an audience the\n\nattacker is interested in. For example, we saw that during an attack in 2019 the personal blog of a prolific\n\nmember of an American think tank was hijacked. While we were unable to reproduce what happened\n\nexactly on the hijacked domain, an obvious case scenario would be a watering hole attack. This watering\n\nhole could then infect the readers of the blog during the DNS hijack.\n\n##### Attacks on Webmail and Corporate VPN Servers\n\nFigure 1. An example of a phishing site of APT33\n\nWebmail is a very useful tool for individuals who want to have access to their emails while on the road.\n\nThe same holds for file-sharing services from third-party service providers with which employees can\n\nwork together on a project. However, these services increase the attack surface. For example, a webmail\n\nhostname might get DNS-hijacked or hacked because of a vulnerability in the webmail software. Webmail\n\nand file-sharing and collaboration platforms can be compromised in credential-phishing attacks. A well\nprepared credential-phishing attack can be quite convincing, as when an actor registers a domain name\n\nthat resembles the legitimate webmail hostname, or when an actor creates a valid SSL certificate and\n\n\n-----\n\nchooses the targets within an organization carefully. The risk of webmail and third-party file-sharing\n\nservices can be greatly reduced by requiring two-factor authentication (preferably with a physical key)\n\nand corporate VPN access to these services.\n\nHowever, VPN credentials and one-time passwords can be phished as well. There have also been critical\n\nvulnerabilities in VPN software and some webmail software that could give third parties unauthorized\n\naccess. It is very important to patch these vulnerabilities as soon as security updates are ready to be\n\ninstalled. We have seen that advanced attackers scan VPN servers and webmail servers, hunting for\n\nexploitable vulnerabilities. In September 2019, an APT actor scanned servers running specific VPN\n\nsoftware, including those in a state-owned oil company. And in October 2019, Pawn Storm (aka APT28\n\nor Sofacy) scanned the mail servers of several oil companies in the U.K.\n\n##### Data Leaks\n\nData leaks have always been problematic for companies across industries. The oil and gas industry, in\n\nparticular, is very competitive and almost any kind of leaked information can be beneficial to a competitor.\n\nData leaks can also cause substantial damage to a company’s reputation. It has been said for decades\n\nthat data should be carefully handled inside companies, yet this is not enough. Outside monitoring should\n\nbe put in place as well.\n\nWhat happens when data that is carefully handled internally is sent to an outside partner? What happens\n\nwhen a company uses unfamiliar tools and software? What happens when a company does not know that\n\nthe software shares files on remote servers? And what happens when those files are stored on unsecure\n\nexternal networks, in some cases becoming freely accessible even to anyone who knows the data is\n\nthere? Needless to say, these are serious issues that should be considered by all companies.\n\nIn the course of our research, we easily found dozens of sensitive documents related to the oil industry\n\nonline. One way of finding these documents is by using specially crafted Google queries, called Google\n\nDorks. We will not show any of these search engine queries in this research paper since the matter is very\n\nsensitive and we do not want to help cybercriminals. Some redacted examples of data we could retrieve\n\nare below.\n\nAnother way to find such content is to hunt for data on public services like Pastebin, an online service that\n\nallows anyone to copy and paste any text-based content and store it there, privately or publicly. Another\n\nsource of data is public sandboxes meant for analysis of suspicious files. Users can mistakenly send\n\nlegitimate documents to these sandboxes for analysis. Once uploaded, these documents can be parsed\n\nor downloaded by third parties.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese are several common security lapses that companies should correct in regard to document storage:\n\n- Documents are stored on a web server in a folder that is world-readable.\n\n- Documents are stored on a file server without proper access control.\n\n- Documents are backed up on an unsecure server accessible to anyone.\n\nWhile it is not a problem to see official documents that were meant for publication online in different\n\nlocations, it becomes problematic when the documents are internal only or require a security clearance.\n\nThose document leaks can affect the “victim” company in several ways:\n\n- Affects one or several company employees\n\n- Affects the company’s public image\n\n- Leaks nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) or contracts signed between a company and a third party\n\n- Leaks information that can be leveraged by competitors\n\n- Leaks information that can be used legally against the company\n\n- Leaks information that can harm long-term projects or road maps\n\nThis is particularly significant in the energy industry, where most information is usually kept internal.\n\nFigure 2. A sampling report sent from a private laboratory to an oil company\n\nAn example is a full document we recently found sent from a laboratory to an oil company, providing the\n\nexact location, ship name, and results for particular oil particles (SN100, SN150) hunting. Information on\n\na potential contamination is confidential and sensitive for any company in the oil and gas industry and\n\nshould not be publicly available.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### External Emails\n\nWhile emails are generally well protected inside companies, external emails cannot be controlled the\n\nsame way. Employees regularly send emails to external addresses, hence some sensitive internal content\n\nending up outside the company’s purview. Even worse, sensitive information can be copied to unsecure\n\nbackup systems or stored locally on personal computers without standard corporate security protocols,\n\nwhich makes it easier for attackers to get hold of the information. Once a computer is compromised, an\n\nattacker can get the emails and use them in different ways to harm a company. For example, an actor\n\ncould leak them on public servers or services like Pastebin.\n\nFigure 3. Sample content from an email found in the wild, sent from an oil company employee\n\nto a third-party service provider\n\nEven to someone not knowledgeable about the industry, it becomes clear that interesting information is\n\nfound when an email starts by mentioning a level of confidentiality.\n\nFigure 4. Sample content from an email found in the wild indicating a “confidential” level of information\n\n###### Defending Organizations Against Data Leaks\n\nA company can identify leaked documents only if it has solid knowledge of all internal documents. Therefore,\n\nany important document inside the company should be watermarked in a way that makes it discoverable\n\non the internet, since constantly monitoring for specific marks makes finding leaked documents easier.\n\nGoogle Dorks based on documents’ characteristics and contents — it can be as simple as searching for\n\nspecific names associated with the word “confidential,” for example — and searches on online services\n\nlike Pastebin[17] should be done daily. The frequency is necessary since companies should be as reactive\n\nas possible when a document appears in public or somewhere where it should not be.\n\nData leaks will happen at some point, whether by “bad handling or mistakes” or by malicious exposure.\n\nThe important thing is to find them before someone with bad intentions does, and have them removed\n\nquickly.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the first steps in mitigating the risk of data leaks is to make a list of keywords that are critical to\n\na company. Specific watermarks of sensitive documents should also be collected. Automated search\n\nqueries for these keywords and watermarks on the internet can then be set up with a script. Even better,\n\na company can outsource all monitoring and data leak prevention to an external service provider that\n\nspecializes in preventing and mitigating data leaks.\n\n### Ransomware\n\nIn the past, cybercriminals were spreading ransomware wherever they could, mostly using spam botnets\n\nto try to infect as many machines as possible. While it remains a serious threat to any individual who\n\nstores data on their computer, ransomware has become an even larger threat as ransomware actors have\n\nbeen targeting companies specifically, with attacks that may have a big impact on daily operations.\n\nTargeting individuals is fairly easy for cybercriminals, even for those with a low level of computer\n\nknowledge. The easiest business model consists of subscribing to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offers\n\non underground cybercrime marketplaces.[18] Any fraudster can buy such a service and start delivering\n\nransomware to thousands of individuals’ computers by using exploit kits or spam emails.\n\nTargeting companies and organizations takes more effort. Infecting a company with ransomware the\n\nsame way it is done with individuals is inefficient because the goal is not about infecting a few computers.\n\nTypically, an actor will try to disrupt a whole company. To this end, the attacker needs to spend time\n\n“profiling” its target entity, collecting information about it, much in the same way as the attacker would do\n\nin a targeted attack.\n\nThat reconnaissance phase is necessary for the attacker to get to the next stage: compromising one or\n\nseveral of the target computers, generally via specially tailored spear-phishing emails or by exploiting\n\nan unsecure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection. Once inside a network, the attacker will try\n\nto move laterally and then carefully choose a moment to drop ransomware either on selected servers\n\nor massively across the network. The end goal is to render the company unable to operate its normal\n\nbusiness or unable to recover its lost data (for example, by tampering with the backup system), so that it\n\nis more likely to pay the ransom.\n\nWe found that a U.S. oil and natural gas company was hit by ransomware, infecting three computers and\n\nits cloud backups. The computers that were targeted contained essential data for the company, and the\n\nestimated total loss was more than US$30 million. While we do not have additional details on this case,\n\nwe believe the attackers did plan this attack carefully and were able to target a few strategic computers\n\nrather than hitting the company with a massive infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore recently, we discovered a variant of the ransomware family BitPaymer[19] that had targeted a U.S.\n\ncompany specializing in providing services for oil well drilling. The actors behind BitPaymer typically\n\nuse spear phishing to infect their targets with initial malware, before spending time moving laterally and\n\ncompromising the network further. They plant the ransomware in specific spots in the network and launch\n\nthe malware, for example, on a Saturday night. They are efficient and dangerous, and they know how to\n\ntake advantage of the absence of IT people during weekends or holidays to infect selected machines and\n\nencrypt the contents.\n\nThe ransom message of BitPaymer is the same for every target, except for the first line, where the company\n\nname is written, and the email addresses for reaching the fraudsters.\n\n\nHello XXX.\n\nYour network was hacked and encrypted.\n\nNo free decryption software is available on the web.\n\nEmail us at XXX@PROTONMAIL.COM (or) XXX@TUTANOTA.DE to get the ransom amount.\n\nKeep our contacts safe. Disclosure can lead to impossibility of decryption.\n\nPlease, use your company name as the email subject.\n\n\nFigure 5. The ransom message from the latest variants of BitPaymer (company name and\n\nemail addresses of fraudsters removed)\n\n### Ever-changing Malware\n\nMalware is an important part of targeted threat actors’ arsenal. Different kinds of malware serve different\n\npurposes and have different ways of functioning and communicating between the infected computers\n\nand the C&C servers.\n\nThreat actors targeting oil and gas companies for cyberespionage definitely want to stay undetected\n\ninside their target’s network. Compromising and planting malware inside a target network is just the initial\n\nstage for attackers. Yet for a number of reasons, these actions can be detected after a while or even just\n\ndeleted automatically by any antivirus or security solution.\n\nTo avoid being kicked off from the network when the only available access is via their malware, attackers\n\ngenerally choose to regularly update their malware. And if possible, they use different malware families so\n\nthat they have more than one way to access the compromised network.\n\nMalware updates can be functionality or code updates, or sometimes just slight modifications for avoiding\n\ndetection.\n\n\n-----\n\nCybercriminals working with malware often use online testing platforms like VirusTotal to check whether\n\ntheir files are detected by different security products. Some threat actors run their own testing platforms\n\nfor better operational security reasons. They do not send their files to any third party and they want to be\n\nsure the files are not known to security companies before a campaign starts to spread them in the wild.\n\nTrend Micro has successfully collaborated with law enforcement to take some of these platforms down\n\n(such as Scan4You[20 ]and Refud.me[21]) and help catch the cybercriminals behind them.\n\nOnce a file has a “close to zero” or even zero detection rate, it becomes “FUD” (fully undetectable) and\n\nit can be used in an attack. In order to alter the malware well enough to become undetectable, attackers\n\noften use crypter software, which refers to programs that modify and obfuscate binaries to escape\n\ndetection. Attackers can also note the exact security products used by the target, and only consider\n\nbypassing that one and not care about others.\n\nIn the next sections, we will discuss some of the most common malware types and tools that are used\n\nagainst the oil and gas industry.\n\n##### Webshells\n\nWebshells are tiny files, generally written in PHP, ASP, or JavaScript language, that have been fraudulently\n\nuploaded to a web server belonging to a targeted entity. An attacker just needs to browse to it to get\n\naccess to the web server. Most common options for webshells provide upload or download file operations,\n\ncommand line (shell), and dump databases.\n\nWebshells can also be tiny files connecting back to a server that listen for communications.\n\nFigure 6. Webshell example: A shell window opened in the China Chopper webshell GUI\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors sometimes use webshells to ease their operations, generally at an early infection stage.\n\nThey can use webshells to:\n\n- Download or upload files to the compromised web server.\n\n- Run other tools (such as credential stealers).\n\n- Maintain persistence on the compromised infrastructure.\n\n- Bounce to other servers and move on with more compromises.\n\n- Steal information.\n\nThreat actors that target the oil industry, like OilRig, have typically used webshells (TwoFace,\n\nDarkSeaGreenShell, possibly more) to serve most of these purposes.\n\n##### Cookies\n\nCookies are small files sent from web servers and stored in the browser of an internet user. They serve\n\ndifferent legitimate purposes, such as allowing a browser to know if the user is logged in or not (as in the\n\ncase of authentication cookies) or storing stateful information (like items in shopping carts).\n\nSome variants of the backdoor BKDR64_RGDOOR[22] used cookies[23] to handle communications between\n\nthe malware and its C&C server. They used the string “RGSESSIONID=” followed by encrypted content.\n\nCareful cookie field monitoring in HTTP traffic can help detect this kind of activity.\n\n##### DNS Tunneling\n\nWhile the most common way for malware to communicate with its C&C server is by using the HTTP\n\nor HTTPS protocol (usually to evade firewall rules or filtering), some attackers allow their malware to\n\ncommunicate via DNS tunneling. The technique is not new and has its limitations, which is why it is not\n\nseen quite often in APT attacks. But some actors do like using it, such as OilRig and GreenBug.\n\nDNS tunneling in this context exploits the DNS protocol to transmit data between the malware and its\n\ncontroller, via DNS queries and response packets.\n\nThe DNS client software (the malware) sends data, generally encoded in some ways, prepended as the\n\nhostname of the DNS query. As an example, the malware might want to send a username “prouser1” to\n\nthe controller. The malware encodes this username in Base64 format:\n```\nprouser1 => cHJvdXNlcjE\n\n```\nThe malware then sends the following DNS query:\n```\ncHJvdXNlcjE.c2serverdomainname.com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIn this fictional example, the domain c2serverdomainname.com is owned and controlled by the attacker,\n\nand points its nameserver (NS) records toward the server where DNS tunneling server software (the\n\ncontroller) is running.\n\nThe server can then reply to the DNS query with different kinds of answers. Data can, for example, be sent\n\nto the malware in the answered query via the CNAME record, or in the TXT field, or others.\n\nReal examples from the wild have affected the oil and gas industry. The Alma communicator DNS tunneling\n\ntrojan[24] used by OilRig uses encryption to send data back and forth via DNS tunneling. The ISMDoor\n\nmalware also uses similar techniques.[25]\n\nThe limitation of the DNS tunneling technique resides in the length of data that can be transmitted per\n\nrequest. In the best case, via the TXT record, for example, only 255 bytes can be sent at a time. If the\n\nattacker needs to send more, the attacker needs to use several DNS queries.\n\nCareful examination of the DNS requests sent from an infrastructure can be very effective in detecting\n\nDNS tunneling.\n\n##### Email as a Communication Channel\n\nIt is possible for an attacker to use email as a communication channel between the attacker’s malware and\n\nits controller. While it might sound very amateurish for senior computer security professionals because\n\nthis method has typically been used by novice malware writers, it can still be seen in the wild.\n\nAn APT attacker might want to use this method mostly for two reasons: email services, especially external\n\nonline services, might be less monitored than other services in the compromised network, and it might\n\nprovide an additional level of anonymity depending on the email service provider that is used.\n\nIn a typical scenario, the malware logs on the email service and reads emails from the inbox, which\n\ncontain instructions from the malware controller. It can also use the service to send data back.\n\nOne example of this modus operandi from a threat actor targeting the oil and gas industry is Kimsuky.\n\nThis threat actor actively used this method with the malware BKDR_KIMSUK.A,[26] which used a free email\n\nservice to communicate.\n\nIt is difficult to detect such behavior on the network, since legitimate users are generally allowed to use\n\nfree email services and traffic is often SSL-encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Zero-day Exploits\n\nIt is still a popular thought that all advanced targeted attacks use zero-day exploits and sophisticated\n\ncode to infect corporate computers and gain full access to the network infrastructure of a company.\n\nBut this is not what usually happens in the real world of targeted attacks. Oftentimes, attackers limit\n\nthemselves to the use of known exploits, and they use zero-day exploits only when really necessary.\n\nIt actually does not take much effort to compromise most networks, gain access, and exfiltrate information\n\nwith standard malware and tools. Of course, some threat actors have more weapons than others, and\n\nthose weapons may include zero-day exploits.\n\nThe Stuxnet case has been an interesting one in this respect, with the use of four different zero-day exploits.\n\nNo other known attack has been seen exploiting so many unpatched and unknown vulnerabilities — it\n\nhas shown an extraordinary level of sophistication.\n\nTwo years before Stuxnet, another malware from the Equation group[27] was using two of the four zero-day\n\nexploits that Stuxnet used. The Equation group targeted many different sectors, including oil and gas,\n\nenergy, and nuclear research. It showed advanced technical capabilities, including infecting the hard\n\ndrive firmware of several major hard drive manufacturers, which had seemed impossible without the\n\nfirmware source code.\n\nOther cases affecting the oil and gas industry have been reported by the media. The Reaper threat\n\nactor, for example, used a zero-day exploit abusing Adobe Flash, and also sometimes exploited recently\n\npatched vulnerabilities. Also, just recently, an actor group was actively scanning for vulnerable VPN\n\nservers, including VPN servers of oil companies.\n\n##### Mobile Phone Malware\n\nThe use of mobile phone malware has increased slowly in recent years. While it is mostly used for\n\ncybercrime, it can also be used for espionage.\n\nThe Reaper threat actor has developed Android malware,[28] which we detect as AndroidOS_KevDroid.\n\nThis malware has several functionalities, including starting video or audio recording, downloading the\n\naddress book from the compromised phone, fetching specific files, and reading SMS messages and other\n\ninformation from the phone.\n\nThe MuddyWater APT group[29] has used several variants of Android malware (AndroidOS_Mudwater.HRX,\n\nAndroidOS_HiddenApp.SAB, AndroidOS_Androrat.AXM and .AXMA) posing as legitimate applications.\n\nThese malware variants have the capability to completely take control of an Android phone, spread\n\ninfecting links via SMS, and steal contacts, SMS messages, screenshots, and call logs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. A list of commands supported by the Android malware AndroidOS_Mudwater.HRX\n\nIn most cases, mobile phone malware poses as known legitimate software as a lure to infect unsuspecting\n\nusers. For example, users may think they are downloading the latest version of Signal or Telegram while\n\nthey are in fact being infected by malware.\n\n##### Bluetooth\n\nBluetooth can also be exploited by threat actors. And one of the most interesting recent discoveries in this\n\nregard is the USB Bluetooth Harvester.[30] It is very uncommon, but it highlights the need for organizations\n\nto stay up to date on threat actor developments.\n\nReaper has deployed malware (TrojanSpy.Win32.BLUEHARV.A) that steals Bluetooth devices’ information.\n\nWhen it is run, it collects basic information on connected Bluetooth devices, such as the device names,\n\naddresses, classes, and a few additional status flags.\n\n##### Cloud Services\n\nThere are many ways for attackers to try to render the traffic between their malware and the C&C server\n\nundetectable. One of these is to use legitimate cloud services to handle the communications between\n\nthe malware and the controller. The Slub malware,[31] for example, has been used for APT attacks. While\n\nit has not affected the oil and gas industry yet, it bears mentioning here as its use of GitHub, a software\n\ndevelopment platform, and Slack, a collaborative messaging service, for C&C communication can easily\n\nbe copied by other threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore interestingly, MuddyWater has used Telegram, a messaging service with end-to-end encryption, to\n\nexfiltrate data from one of its Android malware variants.[32] Another of MuddyWater’s malware variants has\n\nused the API for the online storage service Dropbox. The malware stores all commands from the controller\n\nand their results in the cloud.[33]\n\nC&C connections to cloud services are difficult to detect since they are using normal services that any\n\nemployee can use for legitimate purposes. One way to prevent attacks that take advantage of cloud\n\nservices is to blacklist all of these services. However, this is likely to reduce the company’s efficiency and\n\ngenerate discomfort for employees.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Case Study: APT33\n\nIn this section, we will focus on some aspects of an actor group called APT33. APT33 is generally\n\nconsidered to be responsible for many spear-phishing campaigns targeting the oil industry and its supply\n\nchain. A lot has been published about APT33 already, but we will highlight some facts that were not\n\npublished before the release of our earlier blog post.[34] In particular, we will describe what measures\n\nAPT33 takes to obscure a dozen live C&C servers that have been used in extreme narrow targeting since\n\nabout 2016. We will also list IP addresses that have been used by APT33 to do reconnaissance and\n\nbotnet management since 2018.\n\nAPT33 is known to target not only the oil supply chain but also the aviation industry and military and\n\ndefense companies. We have observed that the group has had some limited success in infecting targets\n\nrelated to oil, the U.S. military, and U.S. national security. For example, we found that in 2019 APT33 was\n\nable to infect a U.S. company providing supporting services to national security.\n\nAPT33 has also compromised oil companies in Europe and Asia. A large oil company with a presence in\n\nthe U.K. and India had concrete APT33-related infections in the fall of 2018. Some of the IP addresses of\n\nthe oil company communicated with the C&C server times-sync.com, which hosted a so-called Powerton\n\nC&C server from October to December 2018, and then again in 2019. A computer server in India owned\n\nby a European oil company communicated with a Powerton C&C server used by APT33 for at least three\n\nweeks in November and December 2019. We also observed that a large U.K.-based company offering\n\nspecialized services to oil refineries and petrochemical installations was likely compromised by APT33 in\n\nthe fall of 2018.\n\nAPT33 has attacked the supply chain of the oil industry broadly. For about two years, multiple spear\nphishing campaigns of APT33 were sent from a compromised private website of a politician who had\n\na seat in the defense committee of the senate in a European country. The targets of these campaigns\n\nincluded companies that operated oil tankers, IT companies that specialized in the oil industry, a publisher\n\nof an online magazine that covered news on oil, and several manufacturers of valves and other industrial\n\nequipment. APT33 has also been targeting a water facility that supplies potable water to a U.S. military\n\nbase for several years. But recent attack waves of APT33 indicate that the actor group has been targeting\n\ncompanies more narrowly.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT33’s best-known infection technique has been using social engineering through emails. It has been\n\nusing the same type of lure for several years: a spear-phishing email containing a job opening offer that\n\nmay look quite legitimate. There have been campaigns involving job openings in the oil and aviation\n\nindustries.\n\n**Date** **From Address** **Subject**\n\nDec. 31, 2016 recruitment@alsalam.aero Job Opportunity\n\nApril 17, 2017 recruitment@alsalam.aero Vacancy Announcement\n\nJuly 17, 2017 careers@ngaaksa.com Job Openning\n\nSept. 11, 2017 jobs@ngaaksa.ga Job Opportunity\n\nNov. 20, 2017 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning\n\nNov. 28, 2017 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning\n\nMarch 5, 2018 jobs@mail.dyn-corp.ga Job Openning\n\nJuly 2, 2018 careers@sipchem.ga Job Opportunity SIPCHEM\n\nJuly 30, 2018 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning\n\nAug. 14, 2018 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning\n\nAug. 26, 2018 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy\n\nAug. 28, 2018 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy\n\nSept. 25, 2018 careers@aramcojobs.ga AramCo Jobs\n\nOct. 22, 2018 jobs@samref.ga Job Openning at SAMREF\n\nTable 1.

PHP mailer script probably used by APT33. The script was hosted on the personal website\n\nof a European senator who had a seat on his nation’s defense committee.\n\nThe job opening social engineering lures are used for a reason: Some of the targets actually get legitimate\n\nemail notifications about job openings for the same companies used in the spear-phishing emails. This\n\nmeans that APT33 has some knowledge of what their targets are receiving from legitimate sources.\n\nAPT33 is known to be related to the destructive malware called StoneDrill and is possibly related to\n\nattacks involving Shamoon, although we don’t have solid evidence for the latter.\n\nBesides the relatively aggressive attacks of APT33 on the supply chain, we found that APT33 has been\n\nusing several C&C domains, listed in Table 2, for small botnets composed of about a dozen bots each. It\n\nappears that APT33 has taken special care to make tracking more difficult.\n\nThe C&C domains are hosted on cloud-hosted proxies. These proxies relay URL requests from the\n\ninfected bots to back-ends at shared web servers that may host thousands of legitimate domains. These\n\nback-ends are protected with special software that detects unusual probing from researchers. The back\nends report bot data back to a dedicated aggregator and bot control server that is on a dedicated IP\n\naddress. The APT33 actors connect to these aggregators via a private VPN with exit nodes that are\n\nchanged frequently. Using these VPN connections, the APT33 actors issue commands and retrieve data\n\nfrom the bots. In the fall of 2019, we counted 10 live bot data-aggregating or bot-controlling servers, and\n\nwe tracked a couple of these servers for months. These aggregators get data from typically very few C&C\n\nservers (around one or two). For every unique C&C domain, there are usually only a dozen or fewer victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Domain oorgans.com suncocity.com zandelshop.com simsoshop.com zeverco.com qualitweb.com service-explorer.com service-norton.com service-eset.com service-essential.com|Date created May 28, 2016 May 31, 2016 June 1, 2016 June 2, 2016 June 5, 2016 June 6, 2016 March 3, 2017 March 6, 2017 March 6, 2017 March 7, 2017|\n|---|---|\n\n\nTable 2.

Schema showing the multiple obfuscation layers used by APT33\n\nActors often use commercial VPN services to hide their whereabouts when administering C&C servers\n\nand doing reconnaissance. Aside from VPN services that are available to anyone, we also see that actors\n\nuse private VPNs they set up for themselves. Setting one up can be easily done by renting a couple\n\nof servers in data centers around the world and using open-source software like OpenVPN. Although\n\nthe connections from private VPNs still come from seemingly unrelated IP addresses around the world,\n\nthis kind of traffic is actually easier to track.

For example, besides administering C&C servers from a\n\nprivate VPN exit node, an actor might also be doing reconnaissance of targets’ networks.\n\nIn regard to APT33, we were able to track private VPN exit nodes for more than a year. We could cross\nrelate the exit nodes with admin connections to servers controlled by APT33. It appears that these private\n\nVPN exit nodes are also used for reconnaissance of networks that are relevant to the supply chain of the\n\noil industry. More concretely, we witnessed IP addresses that we believe are under the control of APT33\n\ndoing reconnaissance on the networks of an oil exploration company in the Middle East, an oil company\n\nin the U.S., and military hospitals in the Middle East.\n\nAPT33 used its private VPN to access websites of penetration testing companies, webmail services,\n\nwebsites on vulnerabilities, and websites related to cryptocurrencies, and to read hacker blogs and\n\nforums. The group also has a clear interest in websites that specialize in the recruitment of employees in\n\nthe oil and gas industry.\n\nTable 3 shows a list of IP addresses that have been used by APT33.

For example, with regard to the\n\ninformation from the different sensors at oil production sites, the risk of tampering with oil production can\n\nbe reduced by at least making sure that all data communication is signed. This can greatly decrease the\n\nrisk of man-in-the-middle attacks where sensor values could be changed or where a third party could\n\nalter commands or inject commands without authorization.\n\n##### Implement DNSSEC.\n\nWe have noticed that many oil and gas companies don’t have Domain Name System Security Extensions\n\n(DNSSEC) implemented. DNSSEC means digitally signing the DNS records of a domain name at the\n\nauthoritative nameserver with a private key. DNS resolvers can check whether DNS records are properly\n\nsigned. This checking can be done both on the corporate recursive DNS resolvers and at the clients. It is\n\npreferred to do DNSSEC validation at the clients as this ensures that DNSSEC checks are also done when\n\nemployees use their corporate computing device while traveling or while working from home. DNSSEC\n\nhelps to combat DNS spoofing and hijacking. As explained earlier in this paper, DNSSEC validation for\n\nall email clients in an organization can help raise the bar of an attack in case mail-related domains of the\n\norganization are DNS-hijacked.\n\n##### Lock down domain names.\n\nDomain names can potentially be taken over by a malicious actor, for example, through an unauthorized\n\nchange in the DNS settings. To prevent this, it is important to use only a DNS service provider that\n\nrequires two-factor authentication for any changes in the DNS settings of the domains of an organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Monitor SSL certificates.\n\nFor the protection of a brand name and for early warnings of possible upcoming attacks, it is important\n\nto monitor newly created SSL certificates that have certain keywords in the Common Name field. For\n\nexample, a company can monitor for SSL certificates that have one of its brand names in the Common\n\nName field. These SSL certificates could be used in credential-phishing attacks or malware attacks where\n\nthe C&C server domain would not ring a bell immediately in log files.\n\n##### Look out for business email compromise.\n\nProtection against business email compromise (BEC) is possible through spam filtering, user training\n\nfor spotting suspicious emails, and AI techniques that will recognize writing styles of individuals in the\n\ncompany. Most individuals have a particular style of writing, and a writing DNA profile can be defined from\n\na set of emails written by a specific person. Using the profiles of individuals in the company, an AI algorithm\n\ncan potentially recognize BEC emails that attempt to mimic users (usually high-profile executives) within\n\na company.\n\n##### Require at least two-factor authentication for webmail.\n\nA webmail hostname might get DNS-hijacked or hacked because of a vulnerability in the webmail software.\n\nAnd webmail can also be attacked with credential-phishing attacks; a well-prepared credential-phishing\n\nattack can be quite convincing. The risk of using webmail can be greatly reduced by requiring two-factor\n\nauthentication (preferably with a physical key) and corporate VPNs for webmail access.\n\n##### Hold employee training sessions for security awareness.\n\nIt is important to have regular training sessions for all employees. These sessions may include awareness\n\ntraining on credential phishing, spear phishing, social media use, data management, privacy policies,\n\nprotecting intellectual property, and physical security.[35]\n\n##### Monitor for data leaks.\n\nAny important document should be watermarked in a way that makes it discoverable on the internet.\n\nWatermarks make it easier to find leaked documents since the company can constantly monitor for\n\nthese specific marks. There are also companies that specialize in finding leaked data and compromised\n\ncredentials; through active monitoring for leaks, potential damage to the company can be mitigated earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Keep VPN software up to date.\n\nSeveral weaknesses in VPN software were found in recent years.[36, 37] For various reasons, some companies\n\ndo not update their VPN software immediately after patches become available. This is particularly\n\ndangerous since APT actors start to probe for vulnerable VPN servers (including those of oil companies)\n\nas soon as a vulnerability becomes public.\n\n##### Review the security settings of cloud services.\n\nFor companies that use cloud services, a review of all security settings and proper risk assessment\n\nare necessary. Cloud services can boost efficiency and reduce cost, but companies sometimes forget\n\nto effectively use all security measures offered by the cloud services. There are also services that help\n\ncompanies with cloud infrastructure security.[38]\n\n\n-----\n\n### References\n\n1 Stephen Kalin, Rania El Gamal, and Dmitry Zhdannikov. (14 September 2019).
