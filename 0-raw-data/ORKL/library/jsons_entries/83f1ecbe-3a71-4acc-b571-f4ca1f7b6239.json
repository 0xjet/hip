We saw attacks against political organizations again in the**\n**second half of 2017. These attacks don’t show much technical**\n\n**innovation over time, but they are well prepared, persistent, and**\n**often hard to defend against. Pawn Storm has a large toolset full of**\n**social engineering tricks, malware and exploits, and therefore doesn’t need much innovation apart from**\n\n**Attackers are banking on network**\n\n**occasionally using their own zero-days and quickly abusing software vulnerabilities shortly after a** **vulnerabilities and inherent weaknesses to**\n**security patch is released.** **facilitate massive malware attacks, IoT**\n\n**hacks, and operational disruptions.

This**\n**makes sense, as the sheer volume of their attacks requires careful administration, planning, and**\n**organization to succeed. The screenshots below show two typical credential phishing emails that**\n**targeted specific organizations in October and November 2017. One type of email is supposedly a**\n\n**message from the target’s Microsoft Exchange server about an expired password. The other says there**\n\n**is a new file on the company’s OneDrive system.** **Attackers are starting to invest in long-**\n\n**term operations that target specific**\n**processes enterprises rely on.

Political organizations** **Email Subscription**\n\n**have to be able to communicate openly with their voters, the press and the general public. This makes** **Your email here**\n**them vulnerable to hacking and spear phishing. On top of that, it’s also relatively easy to influence**\n\n**public opinion via social media. Social media platforms continue to form a substantial part of users’**\n\n**online experience, and they let advertisers reach consumers with their message.**\n\n**This makes social media algorithms susceptible to abuse by various actors with bad intentions.**\n\n**Publishing stolen data together with spreading fake news and rumors on social media gives malicious**\n**actors powerful tools. While a successful influence campaign might seem relatively easy to do, it needs**\n\n**a lot of planning, persistence, and resources to be successful. Some of the basic tools and services,**\n\n**like ones used to spread fake news on social media, are already being offered as a service in the**\n\n**underground economy.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**digging deeper into C Major’s activities, we found that this actor group not only attacks the Indian**\n\n**military, but also has dedicated botnets for compromised targets in Iranian universities, Afghanistan,**\n\n**and Pakistan. Recently, we have witnessed C Major also showing some interest in compromising**\n\n**military and diplomatic targets in the West. It is only a matter of time before actors like C Major begin**\n\n**attempting to influence public opinion in foreign countries, as well.**\n\n**With the Olympics and several significant global elections taking place in 2018, we can be sure Pawn**\n\n**Storm’s activities will continue. We at Trend Micro will keep monitoring their targeted activities, as well**\n\n**as activities of similar actors, as cyberpropaganda and digital extortion remain in use.**\n\n**_Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):_**\n\n**adfs[.]senate[.]group**\n\n**adfs-senate[.]email**\n\n**adfs-senate[.]services**\n\n**adfs.senate[.]qov[.]info**\n\n**chmail.ir[.]udelivered[.]tk**\n\n**webmail-ibsf[.]org**\n\n**fil-luge[.]com**\n\n**biathlovvorld[.]com**\n\n**mail-ibu[.]eu**\n\n**fisski[.]ca**\n\n**iihf[.]eu**\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n**[Pawn Storm Abuses Open Authentication in Advanced Social Engineering Attacks](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pawn-storm-abuses-open-authentication-advanced-social-engineering-attacks/)**\n\n**November’s Patch Tuesday Includes Defense in Depth Update for Attacks Abusing**\n\n**Dynamic Data Exchange**\n\n**[Following the Trail of BlackTech’s Cyber Espionage Campaigns](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns/)**\n\n**[Locky Ransomware Pushed Alongside FakeGlobe in Upgraded Spam Campaigns](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/locky-ransomware-pushed-alongside-fakeglobe-upgraded-spam-campaigns/)**\n\n**Learn how to protect Enterprises, Small Businesses, and Home Users from ransomware:**\n\n**[ENTERPRISE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/enterprise-ransomware/index.html)** **»** **[SMALL BUSINESS](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/small-business-ransomware/index.html)** **»** **[HOME](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/consumer-ransomware/index.html)** **»**\n\n**Tags:** **[Operation Pawn Storm](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/operation-pawn-storm/)**\n\n**[Pawn Storm](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/pawn-storm/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[HOME AND HOME OFFICE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/index.html)** **|** **[FOR BUSINESS](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/index.html)** **|** **[SECURITY INTELLIGENCE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/index.html)** **|** **[ABOUT TREND MICRO](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/about-us/index.html)**\n\n**[Asia Pacific Region (APAC): Australia / New Zealand, ��, ��, 대한민국](http://www.trendmicro.com.au/au/home/index.html)** **[, ��](http://tw.trendmicro.com/tw/home/index.html)** **[Latin America Region (LAR): Brasil, México](http://br.trendmicro.com/br/home/index.html)** **[North America Region (NABU): United States, Canada](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/index.html)**\n\n**[Europe, Middle East, & Africa Region (EMEA): France, Deutschland / Österreich / Schweiz, Italia, Россия, España, United Kingdom / Ireland](http://www.trendmicro.fr/)**\n\n**[Privacy Statement](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/about-us/legal-policies/privacy-statement/index.html)** **[Legal Policies](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/about-us/legal-policies/index.html)** **Copyright © 2018 Trend Micro Incorporated.
