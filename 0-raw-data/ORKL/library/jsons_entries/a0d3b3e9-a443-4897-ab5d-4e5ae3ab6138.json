The threat actors demand ransoms from the victims to restore_\n_access. Tuesday, January 25, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team_\nOrganizations typically focus on traditional enterprise cybersecurity threats. However, some\nthreats are more subtle, targeting organizations on unexpected platforms. In October 2021,\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified a phishing campaign that\n\n\n-----\n\nhijacks corporate Instagram accounts, as well as accounts of individual influencers who have\na large number of followers. The threat actors then extort ransom payments from the victims.\nThe activity continues as of this publication.\n\n## Baiting the hook\n\nThe phishing campaign begins with a message that purportedly originates from Instagram\nand alerts the victim to a potential copyright infringement issue (see Figure 1). The \"Appeal\nAs <victim account username>\" link in the message is a shortened Bitly URL that resolves to\nan attacker-controlled phishing domain.\n\n_Figure 1. Fake Instagram notice about copyright infringement. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe phishing site is customized to mimic the victim's Instagram account (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Fake Instagram page. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Reeling in the phish\n\nWhen the victim checks the box indicating their objection, the \"Go to Appeal Form\" link\nbecomes active. This link leads to a login screen (see Figure 3) that prompts for the victim's\npassword. If the victim provides their password, the threat actors harvest the credentials and\ngain access to the account.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Password harvesting from fake login page. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Releasing the catch…for a price\n\nAfter gaining control of the Instagram account, the threat actors change the password and\nusername. The modified username is a variation of \"pharabenfarway\" followed by a number\nthat appears to be the number of followers for the hijacked account (see Figure 4). The\nthreat actors add a comment to the profile that \"this Instagram account is held to be sold\nback to its owner.\" The comment includes a link composed of a shortened WhatsApp domain\n(wa . me) and a contact number. Clicking the link opens a WhatsApp chat conversation\nprompt with the threat actors. The threat actors also contact the victim via text message at\nthe phone number listed on the account and start negotiating a ransom in exchange for\naccess to the account.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Hijacked Instagram account. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU™ researchers identified numerous Instagram accounts compromised by\npharabenfarway, indicating this campaign is widespread. CTU analysis revealed a large list\nof domains used in the campaign. Based on the domain creation dates, the campaign likely\nstarted in August 2021. A September underground forum post references pharabenfarway\nand advertises hijacked Instagram accounts for up to $40,000 USD (see Figure 5).\n\n_Figure 5.

(Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Identifying the \"phishermen\"\n\nAnalysis of one of the IP addresses that hosts several of the phishing domains led CTU\nresearchers to the 'pbfy . business' website. This website appears to belong to Pharaben and\nFarway, the threat actors likely operating this campaign (see Figure 6). The threat actors self\n\n-----\n\nidentify as advanced experts in social media and hacking and provide their Instagram\nhandles along with WhatsApp contact numbers. Pharaben's contact number uses a Russian\ncountry code, and Farway's uses a Turkish country code.\n\n_Figure 6. Pharaben & Farway website. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn addition to the Turkish country code, other aspects of this campaign also suggest that at\nleast one of the threat actors could be located in Turkey. In one incident, threat actor\ncommunications originated from a Turkish-language version of Instagram. Additionally, the\npage source of one of the phishing websites references the Turkish hizliresim . com filesharing service. The infrastructure associated with this campaign is based in Turkey and\nother countries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOrganizations should include social media accounts for the company and high-profile staff\nmembers in their risk assessment models. Mobile apps are a common attack vector. Use of\nmulti-factor authentication can limit unauthorized access. While social media account\ntakeover may seem insignificant, threat actors could access email accounts or other\ncorporate resources if passwords were reused. Additionally, threat actors could abuse\nhijacked accounts to damage the organization's brand as further leverage to obtain a ransom\npayment.\n\n[Review the Emerging Cybersecurity Trends in 2022 report to learn about other threats that](https://view.secureworks.com/emerging-cybersecurity-trends-in-2022/p/1)\norganizations should consider.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this threat, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1.
