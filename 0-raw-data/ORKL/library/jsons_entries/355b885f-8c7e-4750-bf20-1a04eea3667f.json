Known victims include healthcare providers, pharmaceuticals, IT\nsolution providers for healthcare and equipment manufacturers that serve the healthcare\nindustry likely for the purpose of corporate espionage\n\n\n-----\n\nOrangeworm installs the Kwampirs custom backdoor in large firms in the healthcare sector\nin the U.S., Europe & Asia. https://symc.ly/2K1oJjU\"\n[Click to Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Orangeworm%20installs%20the%20Kwampirs%20custom%20backdoor%20in%20large%20firms%20in%20the%20healthcare%20sector%20in%20the%20U.S.,%20Europe%20%26%20Asia.%20https://symc.ly/2K1oJjU&via=threatintel&hashtags=undefined)\n\n## Sights set on healthcare\n\nBased on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets randomly or\nconduct opportunistic hacking. Rather, the group appears to choose its targets carefully and\ndeliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before launching an attack.\n\nFigure 1. Nearly 40 percent of Orangeworm’s victims operate within the healthcare industry\nAccording to Symantec telemetry, almost 40 percent of Orangeworm’s confirmed victim\norganizations operate within the healthcare industry. The Kwampirs malware was found on\nmachines which had software installed for the use and control of high-tech imaging devices\nsuch as X-Ray and MRI machines. Additionally, Orangeworm was observed to have an\ninterest in machines used to assist patients in completing consent forms for required\nprocedures. The exact motives of the group are unclear.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The biggest number of Orangeworm’s victims are located in the U.S.\nThe biggest number of Orangeworm’s victims are located in the U.S., accounting for 17\npercent of the infection rate by region. While Orangeworm has impacted only a small set of\nvictims in 2016 and 2017 according to Symantec telemetry, we have seen infections in\nmultiple countries due to the nature of the victims operating large international corporations.\n\nThe biggest number of Orangeworm’s victims are located in the U.S., accounting for 17\npercent of the infection rate by region.\n\n## Healthcare providers caught in the crosshairs\n\nWe believe that these industries have also been targeted as part of a larger supply-chain\nattack in order for Orangeworm to get access to their intended victims related to healthcare.\nOrangeworm’s secondary targets include Manufacturing, Information Technology,\nAgriculture, and Logistics. While these industries may appear to be unrelated, we found them\nto have multiple links to healthcare, such as large manufacturers that produce medical\nimaging devices sold directly into healthcare firms, IT organizations that provide support\nservices to medical clinics, and logistical organizations that deliver healthcare products.\n\n## Post-compromise activities\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce Orangeworm has infiltrated a victim s network, they deploy Trojan.Kwampirs, a\nbackdoor Trojan that provides the attackers with remote access to the compromised\ncomputer.\n\nWhen executed, Kwampirs decrypts and extracts a copy of its main DLL payload from its\nresource section. Before writing the payload to disk, it inserts a randomly generated string\ninto the middle of the decrypted payload in an attempt to evade hash-based detections.\n\nTo ensure persistence, Kwampirs creates a service with the following configuration to ensure\nthat the main payload is loaded into memory upon system reboot:\n\nThe backdoor also collects some rudimentary information about the compromised computer\nincluding some basic network adapter information, system version information, and language\nsettings.\n\nOrangeworm likely uses this information to determine whether the system is used by a\nresearcher or if the victim is a high-value target. Once Orangeworm determines that a\npotential victim is of interest, it proceeds to aggressively copy the backdoor across open\nnetwork shares to infect other computers.\n\nIt may copy itself to the following hidden file shares:\n\nADMIN$\nC$WINDOWS\nD$WINDOWS\nE$WINDOWS\n\n## Information gathering\n\nAt this point, the attackers proceed to gather as much additional information about the\nvictim’s network as possible, including any information pertaining to recently accessed\ncomputers, network adapter information, available network shares, mapped drives, and files\npresent on the compromised computer.\n\nWe have observed the attackers executing the following commands within victim\nenvironments:\n\n\n-----\n\n## No concern about being discovered\n\n\n-----\n\nKwampirs uses a fairly aggressive means to propagate itself once inside a victim s network\nby copying itself over network shares. While this method is considered somewhat old, it may\nstill be viable for environments that run older operating systems such as Windows XP. This\nmethod has likely proved effective within the healthcare industry, which may run legacy\nsystems on older platforms designed for the medical community. Older systems like\nWindows XP are much more likely to be prevalent within this industry.\n\nAdditionally, once infected, the malware cycles through a large list of command and control\n(C&C) servers embedded within the malware. It appears while the list is extensive, not all of\nthe C&Cs are active and continue to beacon until a successful connection is established.\nDespite modifying a small part of itself while copying itself across the network as a means to\nevade detection, the operators have made no effort to change the C&C communication\nprotocol since its first inception.\n\nBoth of these methods are considered particularly “noisy” and may indicate that Orangeworm\nis not overly concerned with being discovered. The fact that little has changed with the\ninternals of Kwampirs since its first discovery may also indicate that previous mitigation\nmethods against the malware have been unsuccessful, and that the attackers have been\nable to reach their intended targets despite defenders being aware of their presence within\ntheir network.\n\nKwampirs uses a fairly aggressive means to propagate itself once inside a victim's\nnetwork by copying itself over network shares.\n\n## No hallmarks of a nation-state actor\n\nWhile Orangeworm is known to have been active for at least several years, we do not\nbelieve that the group bears any hallmarks of a state-sponsored actor—it is likely the work of\nan individual or a small group of individuals. There are currently no technical or operational\nindicators to ascertain the origin of the group.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec customers are protected against Orangeworm and Symantec has also made\nefforts to notify identified targets of its operations.\n\nCustomers with Intelligence Services or WebFilter-enabled products are protected against\nactivity associated with the Orangeworm group.
