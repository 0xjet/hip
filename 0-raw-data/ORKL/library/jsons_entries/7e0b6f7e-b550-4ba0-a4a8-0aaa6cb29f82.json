Using\nsuch builders, TAs can easily generate malicious payloads. MiniStealer mainly targets FTP applications\nand Chromium-based browsers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Post on a cybercrime forum\nNearly a month after the release of MiniStealer, the same TA made a post selling Parrot Stealer’s\nbuilder and panel for USD 50. The TA stated that this stealer is based on MiniStealer. We suspect that\nthe TA might have added the functionalities in Parrot stealer which were missing in MiniStealer.\n\nFigure 2 – TA Selling Parrot stealer\nThe figure below shows the Parrot stealer panel.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Parrot Stealer Web Panel\n\n### Builder and Web Panel\n\nThe zip file leaked by TA contains two folders, as shown below. These folders contain the following\nfiles:\n\nBuilder:\n\nMiniStealerBuilder.exe, Stub\n\nPanel:\n\nWeb Panel Source code\n\nFigure 4 – Leaked Files\n\nThe builder released by the TA is a .NET-based binary. It has the functionality to add the Command\nand Control (C&C) details to the payload. The builder loads a file named “stub,” which is the actual\npayload, and then writes the C&C details to it for generating the final payload.\n\nThe test button shown in the figure below sends the Test Logs to the C&C server to check if the\nconnection can be established. These logs contain three connection strings TestUser, TestPass, and\nTestHost.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – MiniStealer Builder\n\nThe TA has also released the source code of the web panel, which can be used to receive stolen data\nfrom a target network. The figure below shows the web panel.\n\nFigure 6 – MiniStealer panel\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n(Sample SHA256:e837a0e6b01ca695010ee8bc4df57a6a9c6ef6e2c22e279501e06f61f0354f67)\n\nMini Stealer is a 64-bit .NET-binary that uses Timestomping. Timestomping is a technique that modifies\nthe timestamps of a file. Adversaries use this technique on their payloads to deflect any unnecessary\nattention during forensic investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – File Details\nThe stealer uses multiple AntiAnalysis checks to prevent debugging of the sample. To detect profiling,\nthe code verifies if the COR_ENABLE_PROFILING environment variable is present and set to 1.\nProfilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET\nCommon Language Runtime. The figure below showcases the stealer detecting profiling.\n\nFigure 8 – Detecting profiling\nThis stealer spawns a thread for continuously checking if the stealer payload is being debugged. To\ncheck for the presence of debuggers, this thread executes methods such as IsDebuggerPresent,\n_OutputDebugString, and Debugger.IsLogging._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Anti-Analysis\nThis stealer payload steals data from the following Chromium-based browsers and FTP applications.\nThe stealer appears to be in the development stage as several FTP applications are hardcoded in the\nstealer, but it does not appear to target all of them.\n\nThe TA might have added these functionalities in Parrot Stealer, which is suspected to be an upgraded\npaid version of MiniStealer. For the FTP application, the stealer steals data from configuration files. For\nbrowsers, the stealer copies certain files for exfiltration present in the AppData\\Browser directory, which\nstores user session and login credentials, as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 10 – Stealing Data\n\n**Over 25 Chromium-based browsers:**\n\n\n-----\n\nChrome, AvastBrowser, AVGBrowser, Browser360, CCleanerBrowser, CentBrowser, Chedot, Citrio,\nCocCoc, ComodoDragon, CoolNovo, Coowon, ElementsBrowser, EpicPrivacyBrowser, IridiumBrowser,\nKometa, LiebaoBrowser, Maxthon, OperaGX, OperaNeon, Orbitum, QIPSurf, Sleipnir, SlimJet, Sputnik,\nSRWareIron, uCozMedia, Vivaldi, Yandex,\n\n**Over 20 FTP Applications:**\n\nFilezilla, FlashFXP, AutoFTPManager, AutoFTPPro, BitKinex, BulletproofFTP, ClassicFTP, CoreFTP,\nCuteFTP, Cyberduck, Dreamweaver, FreeFTP, DirectFTP, ftpcommander, FTPEXPLORER, FTPRush,\nFTPvoyager, LeapFTP, MultiCommander, SmartFTP, SuperPutty, TotalCommander, TurboFTP, WSFTP,\nWinSCP\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe availability of free malware builders and panels can assist TAs in carrying out attacks, as TAs do\nnot need to invest time and money to get malware payloads for cybercrime purposes. There is always\nthe possibility that TA might have released the builder and panel of MiniStealer for free for marketing\npurposes and to build a reputation amongst themselves on cybercrime forums.\n\nThe TA’s behavior further reinforces this theory as after 1 month; they began selling a paid stealer,\nwhich is suspected to be based on MiniStealer. CRIL continuously monitors emerging threats and has\nobserved a surge in the use of stealer malware by TAs.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n**How to prevent malware infection?**\n\nAvoid downloading pirated software from warez/torrent websites. The “Hack Tool” present on\nsites such as YouTube, torrent sites, etc., contains such malware.\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices.\n\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their\nauthenticity.\nEducate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted\nURLs.\nBlock URLs that could be used to spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.\nMonitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Execution** [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) User Execution\n\n\n**Defense Evasion** [T1497.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/001/)\n\n[T1070.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/)\n\n**Credential Access** [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/)\n\n[T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/)\n\n[T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/)\n\n[T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528/)\n\n**Discovery** [T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/)\n\n[T1518](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/)\n\n[T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n\n[T1007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007/)\n\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion: System Checks\n\nIndicator Removal on Host: Timestomp\n\nCredentials from Password Stores\n\nSteal Web Session Cookie\n\nUnsecured Credentials\n\nSteal Application Access Token\n\nAccount Discovery\n\nSoftware Discovery\n\nProcess Discovery\n\nSystem Service Discovery\n\n\n**Command and Control** [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Application Layer Protocol\n\n**Exfiltration** [T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/) Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\nd65def0ad7f1b428bc1045cf2214b82f\n\ne2beda0ef5d1c38bb96fb7eb6ee25990073e6a17\n\ne837a0e6b01ca695010ee8bc4df57a6a9c6ef6e2c22e279501e06f61f0354f67\n\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA1**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**Description**\n\nMalicious\nbinary\n\n\n-----",
