In this post we address the\nquestions that we did not have the time to answer and provide the Indicators of Compromise\n(IoCs) that can help you defend against the identified threats. You can watch the full\n[recording of the webinar here: ‘A look at current cyberattacks in Ukraine‘](https://securelist.com/webinars/ukraine-cyberattack-analysis/)\n\nThe webinar included an historical overview of attacks on Ukraine; and an overview of\ncurrent cyber-activity in the country, which comprises known APT activity, unknown parties\ncarrying out DDoS attacks and leveraging commodity RATs, hacktivism, activities by\ncybercriminals and unattributed attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the webcast, we also provided an analysis of attacks identified using Kaspersky’s\nhoneypot network in Ukraine; as well as an analysis of the APT attacks by Gamaredon,\nCyclops Blink, Hades/Sandworm and unknown groups, using commodity malware such as\nPandoraBlade. We also looked into different wipers that have been used against\norganizations in Ukraine, including HermeticWiper, WhisperGate, IsaacWiper and\nHermeticRansom. We also covered unknown and unattributed attacks and hacktivist activity\ntaking place in the same timeframe.\n\nWe assess that the number of cyber attacks in Ukraine will increase during the next six\nmonths. While most of the current attacks are of low complexity – such as DDoS or attacks\nusing commodity and low-quality tools – more sophisticated attacks exist also, and more are\nexpected to come. Current complex activities include the employment of HermeticWiper,\nwhich stands out due to its sophistication, as well as the Viasat ‘cyber event’ – the partial\nnetwork outage that impacted internet service for fixed broadband customers in Ukraine and\nelsewhere on the European KA-SAT network that affected over 30,000 plus terminals in\nEurope.\n\nCurrently, we assess that the risk of the cyber component of this conflict spilling over to\nEurope is medium-high.\n\nWe advise organizations to:\n\nTake typical measures against DDoS attacks, ransomware and destructive malware,\nphishing, targeted attacks, supply-chain attacks and firmware attacks\nMake sure that any and all internet-facing systems are up-to-date with all the latest\npatches installed\nInstall security software on endpoints\nSet up extensive logging that will allow defenders to be alerted about suspicious events\n\n\n-----\n\nEstablish strict application white-listing on all machines\nActively hunt for attackers inside the company’s internal network\nIntegrate Threat Intelligence into SOC, EDR and leverage IOCs, YARA, Suricata and\nSigma rules. We would also refer you to Kaspersky’s Threat Intelligence Resource\nHub, which currently provides free access to independent, continuously updated and\nglobally-sourced information on ongoing cyberattacks and threats.\n\n## Q&A\n\nDue to time limitations, we could not address all questions during the webinar, so here are\nour answers for the remaining questions we received in the live session:\n\n**Q: What are the chances that we’ll see attacks using enterprise resources to launch**\n**attacks?**\n\nA: Depending on the nature of the attack, actors may not differentiate between home, SMB\nand enterprise systems. For example, infected IoT and network devices such as IP-cameras\nmay be used by anyone, and may be infected and abused by attackers to launch attacks\nsuch as DDoS attacks. Attackers will use and abuse any resources they require in order to\nconduct their attack. If this includes enterprise resources then they will be included in the\nattackers scope.\n\n**Q: Currently we have seen massive connection outbreaks in many different services**\n**over TOR-exits located in the German region. Does this provide a “true” picture of the**\n**threat landscape, since many attackers seem to be from – in this instance – Germany**\n**but might originate from regions that are very interested in causing damage to Europe**\n**or Ukraine specifically right now?**\n\nA: We commonly take TOR and other anonymizing services into account when it comes to\nthe origin of attacks. Not all attacks, for example on our honeypot infrastructure, are easily\npossible through TOR due to enforced policies on exit-nodes.\n\n**Q: I’m wondering what you can say about the attacks on Russian targets, both from**\n**“hacktivists” and others? Can you help us separate the hype and exaggerations from**\n**attacks that are having a real impact?**\n\nA: We have seen several public “hack” announcements. Most of them don’t include enough\nevidence to confirm a real hack; nor do we have the abilities or resources to verify most of\nthem as they are very specific and “targeted”.\n\nThe most important suggestion is to not blindly trust all messages, reports and claims –\nespecially unverified content or if it’s from unverified channels/accounts.\n\n**Q: We all know of REvil group activity and the Kaseya case. REvil members were**\n**arrested by the Russian FSB a few months ago. Do you believe that these people**\n**might be “employed” by the Kremlin to organize an attack against Ukraine? Or you**\n\n\n-----\n\n**think it might be possible to determine if any attackers are former REvil members?**\n\nA: We don’t have any insights into the employment of criminals or other threat actors; nor\ninto plans and strategies of any government or related organizations. Our focus is on the\ntechnical aspects only, which is where our expertise and focus lies. The real world identity of\ncriminals and other threat actors is the focus area of law enforcement and related agencies.\n\n**Q: How may this conflict between Russia and Ukraine affect financial operations? Are**\n**firewalls and antivirus tools enough to defend against a cyberattack that comes from**\n**Europe?**\n\nA: Financial transactions and other operations are handled through the networks of financial\ninstitutions. These are usually secured using many different methods. The origin (that is,\nregion or country) is usually not the first question in regards to defense, but rather technical\naspects and targets. Depending on that, particular methods and policies should be applied to\nprotect against attacks.\n\n**Q: Do you have any current readings on attacks on NGOs?**\n\nA: Several investigations reveal that targets include NGOs – these are accessible through\nour [Threat Intelligence Reporting Service.](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)\n\n**Q: How can we use the Kaspersky honeypot and sandbox?**\n\nA: Our honeypots are not part of any Kaspersky products. They are dedicated systems\nwhere specific sensors are installed in order to monitor attacks. However, you may join our\n[honeypot initiative (for details, email us at honeypots@kaspersky.com).](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:honeypots@kaspersky.com)\nYou may access and use the Kaspersky Sandbox within our Product & Service offerings:\n[Kaspersky Sandbox and](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/malware-sandbox) [Kaspersky Threat Intelligence. File analysis can also be conducted](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)\nthrough [OpenTIP.](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/)\n\n_What follows is the list of IoCs we derived from our honeypot-sensors in Ukraine. These are_\n_the observed, most prominent and relevant attacking IP addresses._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**IPs found attacking Ukraine honeypot
