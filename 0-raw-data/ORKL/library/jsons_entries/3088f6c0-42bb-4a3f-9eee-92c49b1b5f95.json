Note the accent on the e, which distinguishes it from`\n```\n brave.com, the domain it was impersonating.\n\n```\n[This is an example of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), a domain name that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name)\nincludes non-ASCII characters. Such domains have an ASCII representation that starts with\n```\n xn-- and use punycode to convert from ASCII to unicode and vice versa. The ASCII\n\n```\nrepresentation of the impersonating domain is `xn--brav-yva.com .`\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen IDNs are used to impersonate existing domains, one speaks of a homograph or\nhomoglyph attack. Other than the use of accents on Latin characters, this also includes\nusing similar-looking characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as using the Greek α\ninstead of the Latin a. Though not incredibly common in practice, such attacks do exist and\nsecurity researchers have warned about them for more than a decade.\n\nThe `bravė.com or` `xn--brav-yva.com domain was registered through NameCheap in`\nJune and is hosted at `185.198.166.104, which belongs to ITLDC, a Bulgarian cloud`\nprovider with servers in a number of countries.\n\nMy first thought was to use the Silent Push app to see what else is hosted there.\n\nI found three more domain names, all IDNs: `xn--ldgr-xvaj.com,` `xn--sgnal-m3a.com`\nand `xn--teleram-ncb.com . The unicode representations of these domains are`\n```\nlędgėr.com, sīgnal.com and teleģram.com respectively, presumably impersonating\n\n```\ncryptocurrency wallet maker Ledger and messaging apps Signal and Telegram. (I say\n‘presumably’ because `signal.com and` `telegram.com aren’t actually linked to the`\nrespective messaging apps.)\n\nThese other three domains were also registered at NameCheap. Using our passive DNS, I\n[found that none of the domains had been seen at another IP address, so I couldn’t pivot](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/pivoting-finding-malware-domains-without-seeing-malicious-activity)\nany further.\n\nHowever, I wondered if this actor could have hosted other domains at a different server.\nAssuming they’d also use the same registrar and hosting provider, I ran a search query in\nSilent Push’s API for domains starting with `xn-- using NameCheap’s name servers and`\nhosted on ITLDC’s ASN (AS21100).\n\nI found nine further domains. Two of them ( xn--80aaw7ah.com and `xn-`\n```\n-80ahcmbumt.org ) represent words in the Cyrillic alphabet and there is no reason to\n\n```\nassume they are used for anything malicious.\n\nThe other seven, however, were all hosted on the same IP address ( 195.245.113.25 )\nand all impersonate legitimate products, including once again Brave and Telegram:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fake installer on `bravė.com that prompted this research was an ISO file that appears`\n[to contain a version of the Redline infostealer. That suggests it may be related to a](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.redline_stealer)\n[campaign analysed by Morphisec last month, where Redline was also served packed inside](https://blog.morphisec.com/google-ppc-ads-deliver-redline-taurus-and-mini-redline-infostealers)\nan ISO through malicious Google ads, impersonating Telegram and other services. The\ndomain names involved in that campaign were also registered through NameCheap.\n\nAs for IDNs, there are [tools that help one find homograph attacks on an existing domain](https://github.com/evilsocket/ditto)\nname. However, it is through a comprehensive and easily searchable passive DNS\ndatabase that one can find a bigger picture of the campaign using a homograph attack.\n\n## Indicators\n\n```\nxn--brav-eva.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--brav-yva.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--flghtsimulator-mdc.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--ldgr-xvaj.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--screncast-ehb.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--sgnal-m3a.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--teleram-ncb.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--tlegram-w7a.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--torbrwser-zxb.com\n\n```\n```\nxn--tradingvew-8sb.com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nxn--xodus-hza.com\n\n```\n```\n185.198.166.104\n\n```\n```\n195.245.113.25\n\n```\n\nName\n*\nThank you!\n\n[Martijn Grooten](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6085b1971ccba8696c78f75c)\n\n\n-----",
