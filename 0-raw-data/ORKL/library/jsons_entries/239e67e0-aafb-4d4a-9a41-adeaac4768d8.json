    "plain_text": "# Threat Thursday: Redline Infostealer\n\n**[blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer)**\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\n### Summary\n\nRedLine is a new infostealer malware family that is distributed via COVID-19 phishing email\ncampaigns. It has been active throughout 2020, and in 2021, it has additionally been\ndelivered through malicious Google advertisements and spearphishing campaigns against\n[3D or digital artists using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are digital tokens tied to assets](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq)\nthat can be bought, sold and traded.\n\nRedLine is extremely versatile and has appeared variously as Trojanized services, games,\ncracks, and tools. Many samples of RedLine also appear with legit-looking digital\ncertificates.\n\nOnce connection to its command and control (C2) panel is established, RedLine malware\nhas a wide range of applications and services. In all cases it attempts to perform illicit\nexfiltration of victims’ data. The malware gathers information from web-browsers, file\n\n\n-----\n\ntransfer protocol (FTP) clients, Instant Messengers (IM), cryptocurrency wallets, VPN\nservices, and gaming clients. It also has remote functionality to drop and execute further\nmalware onto the victim machine.\n\n### Operating System\n\n**Risk & Impact**\n\n### Infection Vectors\n\nThe RedLine malware family has been distributed and sold mostly via Russian\nunderground malware forums. This threat has been sold as individual packages with\nseveral pricing options, or as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) on a subscription-based\npricing package.\n\nAs the malware is distributed, the threat group behind it does not have a singular goal or\ntarget other than generating revenue by selling the malware. It is then used in multiple\nsmaller campaigns by the individual threat actors who have purchased the malware online.\nDue to this, there are a wide array of known infection vectors, malware campaigns and\ntargets that have been hit by the RedLine malware family.\n\nIn the last few months, RedLine has been noted being delivered by the following\nmechanisms:\n\nAn initial malware downloader\nEmail malspam campaigns\nBeing hosted on Bitbucket\nBeing hosted on paste[.]nrecom[.]net\nAbusing Google Ads hosting Trojanized lure websites\nBeing Trojanized as popular services ‘Telegram’ and ‘Signal’\nSocial engineering campaigns to attack digital artists using Non-Fungible Tokens\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout its development and lifecycle, RedLine has evolved to be more complex, and it\nhas increased the list of data it can exfiltrate. At the time of writing in July 2021, this threat\nappears to be in active development, increasing its capabilities further.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n**Fingerprinting**\n\nRedLine samples tend to be heavily obfuscated .NET compiled executables. As this\nmalware is being widely distributed by threat actors with different skills and goals, the\ncomplexity of this obfuscation can vary sample-to-sample:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: De-obfuscated .NET functions of a RedLine sample._\n\nUpon execution, the malware will initialize both the Command and Control (C2) server’s IP\naddress, and the hardcoded ‘Build ID’ found within each sample. The malware utilizes\nSOAP messaging protocol for its C2 connections.\n\nRedLine will check for Internet connectivity before reaching out to its malicious C2\ninfrastructure to obtain further settings. Once this is complete, the malware will begin by\nfingerprinting the victim’s device for the following characteristics:\n\n\n-----\n\nHardware ID Operating System Version\n\nBuild ID Current Language\n\nUsername Monitor Size/Screen Resolution\n\nProcess Elevation Time/Date\n\nCountry/Location Time Zone\n\nIP Address Screenshotting device\n\nUser-Agent RAM info\n\nGraphic Card info System Defender/Antivirus\n\nThe malware contains multiple functions that aid in the fingerprinting of a victim device.\nThese functions range greatly in both depth and complexity. Some can be simple functions\nand routines for getting a device’s ‘computer architecture’. Others can enlist a wide range of\nIP and geolocation Web APIs for anti-analysis and to prevent location spoofing:\n\n_Figure 2: RedLine uses multiple geolocation and IP address web-based APIs._\n\nWhen fingerprinting the device, the malware has notable functions called ‘Blacklisted\nCountry’ and ‘Blocked IP’. These functions are populated when a connection has been\nestablished by the C2. The threat actor can decide whether these could be used to prevent\n\n\n-----\n\ninfection of devices based on the specific location of a new victim, or by using a specific IP\naddress.\n\n### Information Stealing – File Grabber\n\nOnce infected, RedLine will attempt to find further information from a victim’s device,\nincluding the following:\n\nDefault/set browser\nThe location of specified files\nInstant Messenger clients\nFile paths and fingerprinting:\n\nProgramData folder\nProgram Files folder\nProgram Files (x86) folder\n\n### Information Stealing – Browsers\n\nRedLine’s core functionality is centered around information stealing. One of the ways it\nachieves this is by targeting the following web-browsers:\n\nChromium-based browsers (Chrome)\nGecko-based browsers (Mozilla Firefox)\nMicrosoft Edge\n\nThe malware takes a keen interest in collecting data from these browsers to exfiltrate the\nfollowing from the victim:\n\nLogin and password credentials\nBrowser cookies\nAuto-complete/auto-fill fields used by websites\nCredit card details\n\nEach web-browser stores this information in unique locations. This threat has dedicated\nfunctions and routines per-browser, to maximize its reach and the damage it can cause. All\nstolen information is exfiltrated back to its C2 on a timer:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Scanning Chrome cookies._\n\n### Information Stealing – VPN Clients\n\nWith the growing popularity of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services, many malware\nfamilies have been targeting the login credentials of these services. RedLine in particular\ntargets the following services:\n\nNordVPN\nProtonVPN\nOpenVPN\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Reading OpenVPN profile configurations._\n\n_Figure 5: Reading username and password via the NordVPN Config file._\n\n### Information Stealing – Crypto Wallets\n\nWith the recent astronomical rise in both interest and investment in cryptocurrencies, digital\nwallet details and login credentials have become another lucrative item that many malware\nfamilies are beginning to target and add to their arsenal of info-stealing capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedLine has also added multiple functions to harvest and exfiltrate data relating to several\npopular crypto wallets. A crypto wallet is an application used to both cold store and retrieve\ndigital cryptocurrency assets. RedLine has specific functions that target popular crypto\nwallet services, as well as more generic functions to widen its scope of asset-stealing.\n\nThe following popular wallet services have been targeted by RedLine:\n\nArmory TronLink\n\nMetaMask Jaxx\n\nGuarda Exodus\n\nAtomic Coinomi\n\nElectrum\n\nThe malware also has specific functions targeting different cryptocurrencies specifically:\n\nEthereum wallets\nMonero wallets\n\n_Figure 6: RedLine querying the presence of crypto wallets on a victim device._\n\nAs well as looking for cold-storage cryptocurrency wallets installed onto a victim device,\nRedLine also searches for web-browser extensions related to cryptocurrency applications.\n\nRedLine has a function dedicated to seeking out the presence of other cryptocurrency\nservices, such as the browser-extensions listed below:\n\nYoroi Guarda\n\n\n-----\n\nTronLink Equal\n\nNifty Jaxx Liberty\n\nMetaMask BitApp\n\nMath iWallet\n\nCoinbase Wombat\n\nBinanceChain Atomic\n\nBrave MewCx\n\nGuild Saturn\n\nRonin\n\n### Information Stealing – Instant Messengers\n\nVariants of RedLine attempt to harvest credentials from Instant Messenger (IM) clients.\nThese IM services have seen a recent rise in popularity, with Discord boasting over 100\nmillion active users.\n\nSome samples of RedLine appeared on Google ads related to another Instant Messenger\nservice named Telegram in 2021. These advertisements redirected the victim to a fake\nTelegram webpage, where a Trojanized sample of RedLine malware was offered up to an\nunsuspecting victim, to download and unknowingly execute.\n\nRedLine currently targets the following two clients:\n\nDiscord\nTelegram\n\nFor Telegram, RedLine looks for the folder ‘tdata’, which is typically stored in\n%AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata%. This is where the Instant Messenger stores\nits session data, including images and conversations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: RedLine attempting to find Telegram 'tdata'._\n\n### Information Stealing - Gaming Client\n\nAnother extremely popular service the malware goes after is Steam. Steam is a gaming\nplatform, store, and client that is used by over 120 million active users at the time of writing.\nThe malware attempts to locate the presence of Steam before attempting to obtain\ncredentials.\n\nSteam has an in-built store with a lot of ‘Steam accounts’ having various other services and\nbanking details related to it. RedLine attempts to go after the ‘Steam Sentry File’ which is\nused to store credentials:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Parsing the Steam Sentry File (.SSFN) to read the users credentials /_\n_authorization data._\n\n### Information Stealing - FTP Clients\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients are another common software tool RedLine attempts to\ngather information on. If this information is present, the malware will exfiltrate it. FTP clients\nare used for file transfers between a local and remote computing device.\n\nRedLine attempts to target both FileZilla and WinSCP, both of which are free, open-source\napplications. In observed samples, the malware will seek out the presence of both\napplications, but it does try to obtain more data from FileZilla clients as seen in the list\nbelow:\n\n\n-----\n\nFileZilla\n\nConnections\nCredentials\nRecent\n\nHost\nPort\nUser\nPassword\nWinSCP\n\nPassword\nConnections\n\n_Figure 9: RedLine goes after initially 'recenetservers.xml' and 'sitemanger.xml'._\n\n### Remote Tasks\n\nAs well as fingerprinting the victim’s device, RedLine has the ability to use further internal\nfunctions to carry out a wide array of malicious activities.\n\nOnce a connection with its C2 has been established, RedLine malware can remotely\nperform the following functions:\n\nDownload further files\nExecute and run PE files\nLocate specific PE files execute them\nOpen a requested link\nDownload and execute updates\nExecute a request command via CMD.exe\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the nature and flexibility of RedLine infostealer, the malware family can cause\nconsiderable damage to both enterprise devices as well as personal devices.\n\nIn its current state, RedLine appears to be geared towards targeting individuals and their\npersonal computers. This is highlighted by the malware going after IM services, gaming\nclients, FTP applications, and personal crypto wallets.\n\nThis does not mean RedLine is incapable of damaging an enterprise system or network,\nhowever. The malware’s File Grabber, Remote Task and Web-Browser stealer functionality\ncan all be used by a successful threat actor to carve out important information and data\nfrom corporate devices before exfiltrating them.\n\n### Obfuscated Samples Yara Rule\n\nThe following Yara rule was authored by the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team to\ncatch the threat described in this document:\n\n\n-----\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nimport \"time\"\n\nrule Mal_InfoStealer_Win32_RedLine_Obfuscated_2021\n\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects Obfuscated RedLine Infostealer Executables (.NET)\"\n\nauthor = \"BlackBerry Threat Research Team\"\n\ndate = \"2021-07\"\n\nstrings:\n// The file name appears to use a ramdom word and never contains numbers\n\n$x1 = /[a-zA-z]+.exe/\n\n$x2 = \"Signature\"\n\n$x3 = \"callback\"\n\n$x4 = \"Protect\"\n\n$x5 = \"Replace\"\n\n$x6 = \"Sleep\"\n\n$x7 = \"GetProcAddress\"\n\n$x8 = \"LoadLibrary\"\n\n$x9 = \"FreeLibrary\"\n\n$x10 = \"FromBase64String\"\n\n$x11 = \"nCmdShow\"\n\n$x12 = \"op_Explicit\"\n\ncondition:\n\n//PE File\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\n\n// Must have exactly 3 sections\n\npe.number_of_sections == 3 and\n\n// DotNet Imports\n\npe.imports(\"mscoree.dll\", \"_CorExeMain\") and\n\n// DotNet Imphash\n\npe.imphash() == \"f34d5f2d4577ed6d9ceec516c1f5a744\" and\n\n// Timestamp at least 20 years in the future (Unix Time)\n\npe.timestamp > time.now() + (31556926*20) and\n\n// File Version 0.0.0.0\n\npe.version_info[\"FileVersion\"] == \"0.0.0.0\" and\n\n//All Strings\n\nall of ($x*) and\n\n}\n\n### Un-Obfuscated Samples Yara Rule\n\nThe following Yara rule was authored by the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team to\ncatch the threat described in this document:\n\n\n-----\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nimport \"time\"\n\nrule Mal_InfoStealer_Win32_RedLine_Unobfuscated_2021\n\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects Unobfuscated RedLine Infostealer Executables (.NET)\"\n\nauthor = \"BlackBerry Threat Research Team\"\n\ndate = \"2021-07\"\n\nstrings:\n$x1 = \"Account\"\n\n$x2 = \"AllWalletsRule\"\n\n$x3 = \"Autofill\"\n\n$x4 = \"BrowserExtensionsRule\"\n\n$x5 = \"BrowserVersion\"\n\n$x6 = \"CommandLineUpdate\"\n\n$x7 = \"DiscordRule\"\n\n$x8 = \"DownloadAndExecuteUpdate\"\n\n$x9 = \"FileCopier\"\n\n$x10 = \"FileScanner\"\n\n$x11 = \"Gecko\"\n\n$x12 = \"GeoInfo\"\n\n$x13 = \"RecoursiveFileGrabber\"\n\n$x14 = \"ResultFactory\"\n\n$x15 = \"ScannedBrowser\"\n\n$x16 = \"ScannedCookie\"\n\n$x17 = \"ScannedFile\"\n\n$x18 = \"StringDecrypt\"\n\n$x19 = \"SystemInfoHelper\"\n\n$x20 = \"UpdateTask\"\n\ncondition:\n\n//PE File\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\n\n// DotNet Imports\n\npe.imports(\"mscoree.dll\", \"_CorExeMain\") and\n\n// DotNet Imphash\n\npe.imphash() == \"f34d5f2d4577ed6d9ceec516c1f5a744\" and\n\n//All Strings\n\nall of ($x*)\n\n}\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n-----\n\nAt BlackBerry, we take a [prevention-first and AI-driven approach to cybersecurity.
