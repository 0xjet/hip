The primary focus of the Callisto Group appears to be intelligence\ngathering related to European foreign and security policy.\n\nThis report focuses on describing activity dating from late 2015 to the present day\nthat we have been able to definitively associate with the Callisto Group. Also, some\nindications of loosely linked activity dating back to at least 2013 is provided in the\nsection “Related activity” (page 3). However, we do not currently attribute this older\nactivity directly to the Callisto Group.\n\n#### ATTACK OVERVIEW\n\n##### PHASE 1: CREDENTIAL PHISHING\n\nIn October 2015, the Callisto Group was observed sending targeted credential\nphishing emails with the subject “Remove account [target’s Gmail address]”. These\nemails purported to come from Google alerting the target that their Gmail account\nwas about to be removed. The emails requested the target to click a link to prevent\ntheir account from being removed. If clicked, this link would lead to a phishing\nwebsite that attempts to harvest the target’s Gmail credentials.\n\nThe emails were designed to appear authentic and convincing. The domains used\nGoogle or commonly known Google services in both the referenced links and the\nsender’s email.\n\nBased on our information, these emails were highly targeted and were only sent to\na handful of targets. At least some of the recipient Gmail addresses were personal\naccounts of the target and not readily available to the public, suggesting thorough\nreconnaissance by the attackers.\n\nKnown targets include European military personnel. We also have reason to believe\nthis or related phishing incidents targeted key personnel in European think tanks.\n\n##### PHASE 2: SPEAR PHISHING WITH MALICIOUS ATTACHMENTS\n\nIn early 2016, the Callisto Group was observed sending targeted spear phishing\nemails containing malicious attachments. These emails were sent from email\naccounts of individuals likely to be familiar to the recipient. We believe these email\naccounts were compromised in the previous phase of the attack, or in similar\nrelated phishing attacks.\n\nKnown spear phishing emails made reference to a conference with relevance to\nEuropean security policy. The malicious attachments purported to be invitations\nor drafts of the agenda for the conference. The compromised email accounts used\nto send the spear phishing emails belonged to individuals involved in organizing\nthe conference. Combining this information together resulted in highly convincing\nspear phishing.\n\nKnown targets of these spear phishing emails with malicious attachments include\nmilitary personnel, government officials, think tanks, and journalists in Europe and\nthe South Caucasus. We are currently not aware of any evidence suggesting any of\nthese individuals were compromised, just that they were targeted.\n\nAll known malicious attachments sent with these spear phishing emails were\nMicrosoft Word .docx files. None of the known files exploited any vulnerabilities.\nRather, the files utilize a feature of Microsoft Word that allows “objects” to be\nembedded in docx files. In the case of these malicious files, the embedded object is\nthe malware executable.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IMAGE 1**\nIcon for an embedded malware\nexecutable in a malicious attachment\n\n\n**IMAGE 2**\nIcon for an embedded malware\nexecutable in another malicious attachment\n\n\n**IMAGE 3**\nWarning prompt shown to the user by recent versions of Microsoft Word\nif the user clicks the icon for the embedded malware executable.\nThe malware will only be executed if the user clicks “OK”.\n\n\nFor the embedded malware to be executed, a user needs to click an icon in the\ndocx file (see Images 1 and 2 for examples). Additionally, in recent versions of\nMicrosoft Word, if a user clicks the icon for the embedded executable, Word will\nprompt the user with a warning (see Image 3). The payload will only be executed\nif the user acknowledges the prompt.\n\n##### MALWARE USAGE\n\nIn all known malicious attachments, the final payload was a variant of the “Scout”\ntool from the HackingTeam Remote Control System (RCS) Galileo hacking\nplatform. HackingTeam is an Italian software company that created RCS, which\nthey describe as “the hacking suite for governmental interception”.[1] In July 2015,\nnews emerged that HackingTeam had been breached. One of the consequences\nof this incident was the then latest version of RCS Galileo being leaked to the\npublic.[2 ]\n\nAs a result of the leak, both the source code and the ready-made installers for\nthe RCS platform were made available for anyone to use. Based on our analysis\nof Callisto Group’s usage of RCS Galileo, we believe the Callisto Group did not\nutilize the leaked RCS Galileo source code, but rather used the leaked readymade installers to set up their own installation of the RCS Galileo platform. The\nprocess for using the leaked installers to set up an RCS Galileo installation has\nbeen described online in publicly available blogposts, making the process trivial\nto achieve.\n\nIn the known spear phishing attacks by the Callisto Group, they employed the\n“Scout” malware tool from the RCS Galileo platform. The “Scout” malware tool is\na light backdoor intended to be used as an initial reconnaissance tool to gather\nbasic system information and screenshots from a compromised computer, as\nwell as enable the installation of additional malware.\n\n\n1.

Unless the target was using twofactor-authentication, the Callisto Group would then have full access to the target’s email account.\n\nWe are confident the Callisto Group used this type of access to a target’s email account for the\npurposes of sending spear phishing to other targets. We also believe it is highly likely that the\nCallisto Group would leverage the same access to read and monitor the target’s email activity.\n\nIf a target of the spear phishing described in “Phase 2: malware deployment” opened the email\nattachment and, crucially, clicked on the icon in the attachment, this would lead to the target’s\ncomputer becoming infected with the “Scout” malware tool from the RCS Galileo platform. This\nmalware tool would have gathered basic information on the target’s computer and delivered these\nto the Callisto Group. This malware tool would have also enabled the Callisto Group to install\nadditional malware on the target’s computer.\n\nIn effect, this would have provided the Callisto Group with full remote access to the target’s\ncomputer, and by extension, to any data accessible to the target via their computer.\n\n#### TARGETING AND ATTRIBUTION\n\nThe most obvious common theme between all known targets of the Callisto Group is an\ninvolvement in European foreign and security policy, whether as a military or government official,\nbeing employed by a think tank, or working as a journalist. More specifically, many of the known\ntargets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the\nSouth Caucasus.\n\nThis targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign\nand security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that\nwould suggest a financial motive.\n\nIt is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated\nwith the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances.\nWhile we don’t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the\nexistence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.\n\nWhile the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group’s activity is a\nnation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to\ninfrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal\nelement. Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure\ncontain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure,\nand in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.\n\nIt is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For\nexample, a cyber crime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit\nof a government agency, is one potential explanation. However, we do not believe it is possible to\nmake any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the\ncurrently available information.\n\n#### CONTINUING ACTIVITY\n\nThe Callisto Group continues to be active. While they have been last known to employ malware in\nFebruary 2016, they continue setting up new phishing infrastructure every week.\n\nShould the Callisto Group be alerted to the fact that they have been noticed, we do not know\nhow they will react. They may stop everything or they may continue as if nothing has happened.\nHowever, as long as they believe they are succeeding in staying unnoticed, we believe it is highly\nlikely that they will continue their phishing activity, and follow up any successful compromises with\nadditional malware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IDENTIFICATION, MITIGATION, AND REMEDIATION\n\n##### IDENTIFYING CALLISTO GROUP ACTIVITY\n\nAppendix A provides indicators of compromise that can be used to attempt to identify Callisto\nGroup activity. Every effort has been made to thoroughly document the tools, techniques, and\nprocedures of the Callisto Group, as well as possible methods of identifying whether an individual\nor organization has been targeted or compromised by this threat actor. However, it is possible\nthat the Callisto Group is also using other tools, techniques, and/or procedures that would evade\nidentification by the provided methods.\n\nIt is highly encouraged that any, even slight, suspicion of compromise be thoroughly investigated.\n\n\n##### MITIGATION AGAINST CREDENTIAL PHISHING\n\nUsing two-factor authentication for accessing\nemail would prevent the attackers from using\ncompromised credentials to gain access to a target’s\nemail account. However, the compromise of login\ncredentials, especially should the victim not employ\nproper password hygiene (such as by reusing\npasswords), is a security risk in itself.\n\n\n##### REMEDIATION AGAINST CREDENTIAL PHISHING\n\nShould a user suspect having fallen victim to\ncredential phishing, immediate remediating\naction should be taken to reset the suspected\ncompromised credentials and enable two-factor\nauthentication. Any other services where the\nuser may have reused the same username and/or\npassword should also have the credentials reset.\n\nThese immediate actions should be followed by a\nthorough investigation to determine the extent\nof the possible compromise, to understand what\ndata may have been compromised, what actions\nthe attackers may have taken with the help of the\ncompromised credentials, and what the implications\nof these actions and compromise may be.\n\n\n##### MITIGATION AGAINST SPEAR PHISHING AND RCS GALILEO\n\nThe spear phishing emails used in the known attacks\nby the Callisto Group were so convincing that even\nskilled and alert users would likely have attempted\nto open the malicious attachment. However, simply\nviewing the attachment would not have resulted\nin an infection as the document did not attempt to\nexploit any vulnerabilities.\n\nActual infection would have required the user\nto attempt to click a specific icon in the opened\nattachment. Furthermore, at least recent versions\nof Microsoft Word will prompt the user with an\nadditional warning stating that what the user is about\nto do is dangerous. For the infection to succeed, the\nuser would either have to acknowledge the prompt\nor be using an old enough version of Microsoft Word\nto not be warned.\n\nAdditionally, the malware payload used, RCS Galileo,\nis relatively well known. Therefore, most antivirus\nsolutions provide good protection against RCS\nGalileo and would have blocked the execution of\nthe malware payload. Using an up-to-date antivirus\nsolution with all protection features enabled is the\nmost effective mitigation against highly targeted\nattacks such as these.\n\n\n##### REMEDIATION AGAINST RCS GALILEO\n\nShould a user suspect having become infected with\nRCS Galileo, their computer should immediately\nbe disconnected from the internet. However, care\nshould be taken to not power off the computer as\nthis would hinder the ensuing investigation into the\ncompromise.\n\nOnce the computer has been disconnected from the\ninternet, the malware will be unable to communicate\nwith its command and control server, thereby\ndisrupting the attacker’s ability to control the\ncomputer. This should immediately be followed by\ninitiating a thorough forensic investigation into the\ncompromise.\n\nShould the affected organization or individual not\nhave complete confidence in their ability to properly\nperform such an investigation, they should employ\noutside assistance.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A | INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n\n##### SAMPLE HASHES\n\nSHA1 of related RCS Galileo sample. We believe other\nsimilar samples exist.\n\n07cdc67d211d175cd9d418dc5482b3f17d93526a\n\n##### DETECTION NAMES\n\nF-Secure detects Callisto Group activity with a variety of\ngeneric, behavioral, and other detections including the\nfollowing:\n\nGen:Variant.Symmi.54992\n\n##### FILE PATHS\n\nUpon infection, known samples of Callisto Group’s RCS\nGalileo have stored copies of themselves in the following\nlocations:\n\n%TEMP%\\Microsoft Word.exe\n\n%TEMP%\\WinWord.exe\n\n>startup folder<\\bleachbit.exe\n\n>startup folder<\\BluetoothView.exe\n\n##### COMMAND & CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nKnown command & control servers\n\n\n##### PHISHING INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nDomains known or believed to be used in relation to\nphishing. These may be used as targets of links or as\ndomains for sender email addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
