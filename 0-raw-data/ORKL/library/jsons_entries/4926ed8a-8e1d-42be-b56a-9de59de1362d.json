The new activity demonstrates a significant departure from the\npreviously observed activity from this group. Proofpoint assesses with high confidence the new activity could lead to\nransomware infections.\n\n[TA551 is a criminal threat actor Proofpoint has tracked since 2016. It is known by other security firms as Shathak.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ta551-shathak-icedid/)\nProofpoint assesses with high confidence TA551 gains access to stolen messages or compromised email accounts – also\nknown as thread hijacking – which it uses in email campaigns to distribute malware. TA551 has previously distributed\n[malware payloads such as Ursnif, IcedID, Qbot, and Emotet. This actor acts as an initial access facilitator for ransomware](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware)\nthreat actors. Proofpoint has observed its campaigns leveraging banking trojans have led to ransomware infections.\nProofpoint assesses with high confidence TA551 IcedID implants were associated with Maze and Egregor ransomware\n[events in 2020.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/melting-unc2198-icedid-to-ransomware-operations.html)\n\nOn 20 October 2021, Proofpoint observed emails that appeared to be replies to previous conversations and contained\n[password-protected zipped Word documents. The attachments ultimately lead to the download of Sliver, an open-source,](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/tree/6c02971b54831884d30407b632a379947dd289ad)\ncross-platform adversary simulation and red team platform. The activity demonstrated a significant departure from\nprevious tactics, techniques, and procedures from TA551.\n\n_Figure: Thread hijacked email containing zipped Word document._\n\nWhen a victim downloads the zipped attachment, they are ultimately directed to a macro-laden Microsoft Word document.\nIf macros are enabled, SLIVER is downloaded.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure: Malicious Microsoft Word document directing victims to enable macros._\n\nSLIVER is available for free online, and capabilities include information gathering, command and control (C2) functionality,\ntoken manipulation, process injection, and other features. Red teaming tools are becoming increasingly popular with\n[cybercrime threat actors. For instance, Proofpoint observed a 161% increase in threat actor use of the red teaming tool](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/cobalt-strike-favorite-tool-apt-crimeware)\nCobalt Strike between 2019 and 2020. Additional offensive frameworks that appear as first stage payloads used by\ncybercrime actors include Lemon Tree and Veil.\n\nTA551’s use of SLIVER demonstrates considerable actor flexibility. As an established initial access broker leveraging initial\naccess via email threat campaigns, TA551 would compromise a victim and potentially broker access to enable the\ndeployment of Cobalt Strike and eventually ransomware. With SLIVER, TA551 actors can gain direct access and interact\nwith victims immediately, with more direct capabilities for execution, persistence, and lateral movement. This potentially\nremoves the reliance on secondary access.\n\nProofpoint observed the following indicators of compromise:\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n\n\nhXXp://carwaded[.]com/cbfsd/P9G7gD1E6t9w22zQj/cC9DHcTHUKJV/ugnbvdk0EInGgeCqaLEYILzxL/zes1?\nref=wU4bJ1ZLhoMc8BcRMMqy&q=ELOKZymM\n\n\nDocument\nPayload\n\n\nhXXp://ruwejo[.]com/upload/admin.jsp SLIVER C2\n\nb7cc07bfc41e61a89e961dd5826fa2b4d47a85a5b5856d50f9a57667199635b3 Document\nSHA256\n\n**Emerging Threats Signature**\n\nETPRO MALWARE Sliver Framework HTTP C2 sessionInit\n\n_[Is your organization protected against criminal threat actors?
