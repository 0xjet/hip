Often, they are\ndesigned to steal sensitive information (login credentials, account numbers, financial\ninformation, credit card information, and the like) from users.\n\nTrojan malware takes its name from the classic Trojan horse ploy from the war between the\nGreeks and the independent city of Troy. The ancient Greeks were able to defeat the city of\nTroy by hiding soldiers inside a giant wooden horse they left behind as a gift while they\nfeigned retreat following a 10-year war. Little did the Trojans realize that by taking the horse\nas a trophy of war, they were bringing an elite Greek fighting force right inside the walls of\ntheir city, ultimately leading to the fall of Troy. A malicious gift thus became known as a\nTrojan Horse.\n\nA banking trojan operates in much the same way—disguising itself as something good or\nbeneficial to users, but having a far more sinister, hidden purpose. Even a mobile app that\nappears to serve a genuine purpose (for example, a game, flashlight, or messaging service)\ncan secretly be a trojan looking to steal information. Trojans evade detection by having\ndormant capabilities, hiding components in other files, forming part of a rootkit, or using\nheavy obfuscation.\n\nEvery individual family of malware has its own “signature moves,” and with each iteration,\nmalicious actors grow more sophisticated. Banking trojans are a specific kind of trojan\nmalware. Once installed onto a client machine, banking trojans use a variety of techniques to\ncreate botnets, steal credentials, inject malicious code into browsers, or steal money.\n\n## How Banking Trojans Began\n\nIt took almost 20 years for banking customers to get comfortable with the idea of online\nbanking, which began in the 1980s. With the majority of banks offering online banking by the\nyear 2000, it wasn’t long before attackers found ways to exploit this new attack surface using\nbanking malware. Banks were quick to realize that they were attractive targets to attackers,\nand they responded by hardening their systems. In turn, cybercriminals soon realized that it\nwas difficult to attack the institutions themselves, so they pivoted, targeting customers\ninstead. Stealing customer credentials was a more feasible avenue of attack, and out of this\nthe first banking trojans were created. Banking trojans targeted users primarily through\nspam, phishing, advertising, drive-by-downloads, or social engineering. They can falsely\nadvertise themselves as attachments or games.\n\nSince then, the scope, technical ability, and focus of the malware authors has changed. What\nfirst started as malware that primarily targeted customers of financial institutions evolved to\ntarget a range of industries, including online advertisers, digital analytics firms, financial tech\ncompanies, social media sites, and communication platforms. Today, banking trojans are\npervasive across the Internet, and all sorts of institutions—not just financial institutions—\nneed to be aware of how to protect themselves and their customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Speaking the Language\n\nBefore we look at specific banking trojans, there’s a bit of malware jargon that helps make\nthese descriptions easier to understand:\n\n**Malware family. A collection of malware that’s produced from the same code base.**\n\n**Variant. Malware that’s built from an existing code base, but with a new signature that**\nis not included in the list of known bad signatures used by anti-virus and anti-malware\nsolutions.\n\n**Strain. Another name for a malware variant.**\n\n**Malware version. Another name for a malware variant.**\n\n**Descendant. Similar to a variant, descendant refers to malware that’s based on an**\nexisting code base and integrates different tools or techniques.\n\n**Campaign. A series of operations undertaken by malware authors intended to infect a**\nspecific set of targets.\n\n**Rootkit. Code that targets the lowest level functions of an operating system. It is often**\nused by malware to hide, both from users and from the operating system itself.\n\n**Bootkit. Code that targets the operating system when it starts up. It often runs**\nautomatically when the system starts.\n\n**Dropper. Usually used at the first stage in a malware infection, droppers are designed**\nto install some other kind of malware onto a target system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample. A single example of a malware variant that is studied by engineers to**\ndetermine characteristics of the malware variant.\n\nA Reference Guide to the Malware Family Tree\n\n## Active and Notable Trojan Banking Malware Families\n\nThe number of banking malware families—and strains within those families—is constantly\nevolving. What follows is not a comprehensive list of all banking trojans, but includes some of\nthe most destructive banking trojan families seen since 2007.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Zeus. Also known as ZBOT, Zeus is the most widespread banking malware. First seen**\nin 2007 grabbing user credentials, altering webpage forms, and redirecting users to\nfake sites (among other things), it consistently evolved. Zeus and was pervasive across\nthe Internet until 2010 when, according to Kaspersky Lab, its author reportedly “retired”\nand sold the source code to the developer of SpyEye, another family of banking\ntrojans.1 Zeus has been attributed to an anonymous developer in Russia, however,\ncybercriminal gangs can easily cross national borders. The source code has been\npublicly available since 2011, and a number of variants have been developed. The\noriginal version of Zeus malware worked on Microsoft operating systems and was\nspread through spam and drive-by downloads. Since then, Zeus variants have evolved\nin technique and sophistication. Some are able to evade detection and others were\ndesigned to generate income through a pay-per-click model. Although the original\nversion of Zeus has been largely neutralized by anti-virus software, it continues to be\ndangerous through its numerous descendants. Zeus and its spinoffs can be seen all\nover the web, as there are thousands of variants, including notable ones such as\nCitadel, Gameover, and Atmos.\n\n**Gozi. Also known as Ursnif, Gozi is one of the oldest banking trojans. To put it simply,**\nGozi tricks users into completing financial transactions in accounts that aren’t theirs. It’s\nbeen around since 2007 and, as one of the original banking trojans, has caused\nmillions of dollars in damages. In 2010, the Gozi source code was leaked, which lead\nto the creation of several different versions of the malware. It was leaked for a second\ntime in 2015, which led to further modularization and development of new versions of\nthe malware. In 2016, Latvian hacker Deniss Calovskis was sentenced to time served\n(21 months) for developing the original Gozi code.2 Arresting a key developer often\nstops banking trojans, but it appeared to have little affect with Gozi. After more than ten\nyears, Gozi continues to be one of the most sophisticated and constantly evolving\nmalwares. When first developed, Gozi used rootkit components to hide its processes.\n[More recently it has added both client-side and server-side evasion techniques and has](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/gozi-adds-evasion-techniques-to-its-growing-bag-of-tricks)\ncontinued to evolve. Recently, [Gozi and Tinba have been connected through their use](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/webinject-crafting-goes-professional-gozi-sharing-tinba-webinjects-22453)\nof shared web injection techniques. Although the scope has expanded for many\n[banking trojans, Gozi continues to target financial institutions. As of March 2019, Gozi](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/gozi-banking-trojan-pivots-towards-italian-banks-in-february-and-march)\nhas been connected to DanaBot for targeting some of the same Italian banks. Gozi\nshows no signs of stopping and is considered one of the most dangerous pieces of\nbanking trojan malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**GozNym. GozNym is a hybrid of Gozi and Nymaim. The Nymaim malware itself is a**\ndropper. It acts solely as a gateway—a delivery system for other strands of malware.\nGozNym uses Nymaim’s advanced stealth capabilities to unload the previously\nmentioned Gozi malware. Researchers originally tracked both pieces of malware\nindividually. Nymaim on its own is famous for its sophisticated evasion techniques and\nwas seen as early as 2013.3 As of late 2015, security researchers noticed that Nymaim\nwas fetching a Gozi module and using it to launch attacks. Attacks by the first GozNym\nhybrid malware were detected in April 2016 targeting Polish banks. These attacks were\nquickly followed up with another geo-centric campaign targeting major US banks and ecommerce platforms. 4 GozNym continued its operations all over the world, targeting a\nrange of countries from Canada to Spain to Brazil and Japan.\nGozNym was one of the most notorious banking trojan hybrids but its reign was short\nlived. In September 2016, security researchers at Talos were able to “sinkhole” the\nGozNym botnet, essentially stopping operations.5 In November 2016, US authorities\nindicted Krasimir Nikolov, a Bulgarian national, for the distribution of the GozNym\nbanking trojan6 and in April 2019 he pled guilty to the charges.7 Operations with\nGozNym slowed after Nikolov’s arrest, however Nymaim remains an active threat and\nthere has been some recent speculation that parts of GozNym may yet reemerge in\nnew malware forms.8\n\n**Carberp. This malware first emerged in 2009. Its purpose was to steal banking**\ncredentials. Along with hooking network APIs,9 Carberp works like many other banking\ntrojans by logging keystrokes, spoofing websites, and hiding instances of itself in\nspecific locations.10 In 2012, eight individuals involved with Carberp’s operations were\narrested by Russia’s Ministry of Affairs. In 2013, however, Carberp made a comeback\nwith improved paid versions and mobile app variants available in the wild. In 2013\nCarberp’s code and bootkit were leaked; components of Ursnif (also known as Gozi)\nand Citadel were also found inside.11 Carberp was adopted by the Carbanak gang in\n2016 and was spotted attempting to steal money from banks all over the world.12 This\norganized cybercrime gang allegedly began in 2013 and is suspected of other\norganized criminal activity, including money laundering and drug and human trafficking.\nIn 2018 the alleged leader of the Carbanak criminal gang was arrested.13 Since then,\nCarberp has remained quiet, though still an active threat. Silence, another group that\nhas used many of the same techniques as Carbanak, has been active in the\ncybercrime scene targeting banks in Russia, Armenia, and Malaysia.14 Carberp is still a\nthreat, and it is very possible that it will make a strong resurgence.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SpyEye. First spotted in the wild in 2009, SpyEye targeted Windows users running**\nsome of the most popular web browsers. It logged keystrokes and used form grabbing\ntechniques to steal users' credentials. As well as being a banking trojan in its own right,\nit attempted to target and remove the competitive malware, Zeus. SpyEye originally\nhad a “kill Zeus” feature in its toolkit that claimed to remove Zeus from an already\ninfected machine. SpyEye never reached the same distribution of Zeus, though it had\nmany of the same features. In 2010, one of Zeus’ authors allegedly shared Zeus’\nsource code with the SpyEye developers and they merged the two toolkits.15 SpyEye\nwas particularly destructive from 2010 through 2012 and allegedly caused close to $1\nbillion in financial damages.16 In 2016, Russian Aleksandr Andreevich Panin, who went\nby the moniker, Gribodemon, and Algerian Hamza Bendelladj, who went by the\nmoniker of Bx1, were sentenced to a combined 24 years 6 months in prison for\ndeveloping and distributing SpyEye.17\n\n**Shylock. Shylock’s authors clearly had an appreciation for Shakespeare as this trojan**\ntook its name from The Merchant of Venice and contained snippets from the play in its\nfiles.18 Shylock began its campaign in 2011, capturing users' online banking credentials\nand then tricking them into transferring funds to attacker-controlled accounts. It used\nmodular, adaptable functionality that responded quickly to security countermeasures.\nShylock was first detected in July 2011. By the end of 2011, its distribution had grown\nsignificantly. It continued to expand over the course of 2012 and maintained its\npresence up until 2014.19 Unlike many other banking trojans, Shylock was privately\nowned and was not sold in an underground marketplace. Also, unlike some other\nbanking trojans, Shylock maintained a narrow geographic remit throughout its active\ntime, notably focusing its attention on the UK with some US banking institutions also\nappearing on the target list. Shylock’s authors ran it as a business, working typical 9 to\n5 hours with code compilations occurring on specific days.20 In July 2014, an eastern\nEuropean gang connected with Shylock had its domains and command-and control\nservers shut down.21 Activity for shylock trailed off after the assets were confiscated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Citadel. First identified in 2011, Citadel, a Zeus variant, primarily targeted credentials**\nthat were stored in password managers using its keylogging capabilities. Citadel was\nespecially active from 2012 through 2014. In 2017, prosecutors asserted that Citadel\nhad infected over 11 million machines.22 Using advanced evasion techniques, Citadel\nachieved unprecedented distribution. IBM researchers estimated that, at one point, 1 in\nevery 500 machines worldwide was infected with the malware.23 Citadel offered a\nunique interactive feature on underground markets for customers (that is, other\ncriminals) that enabled them to file bug reports and get technical support.24 This\nfeature ultimately led to its demise. In 2015, “Rainerfox,” also known as Dimitry\nBelorossov, was arrested and sentenced to nearly five years in prison for distributing\nCitadel. In 2017, Mark Vartanyan, a Russian national who went by the moniker\n“Kolypto,” pled guilty to fraud for helping to develop part of the Citadel malware. He\nwas sentenced to five years in prison for his part.25 Since 2017, news about Citadel\nhas slowed but, like many other banking trojans that have reemerged from dormancy, it\nremains an active threat.\n\n**Tinba. Also known as Tiny Banking Trojan, Tinba was first discovered in the wild in**\n2012 when it was found to have infected a number of computers in Turkey. It is the\nsmallest banking trojan known, consisting only of a 20 KB file. It typically runs geospecific campaigns, though varies its regions. Tinba’s code was first leaked in 2014\nand proved to be a useful resource for malware researchers to analyze.26 Tinba has\nalso been linked to other banking trojans in the past. It is allegedly a highly modified\nversion of Zeus, as it has a similar architecture.27 In 2016, F5 labs reported that Tinba\nand Gozi used almost identical web injects. They seem to have been bought from the\nsame webinject workshop. Tinba has not been in the news recently, but it would be\nnaive to think that it is gone for good.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Vawtrak. Also known as Neverquest or Snifula, Vawtrak is a descendent of the Gozi**\nbanking trojan. First discovered in 2013, Vawtrak was active in geographically targeted\ncampaigns and employs a Cybercrime-as-a-Service business model. This is not unique\nto Vawtrak, as other trojans, including Gameover Zeus, also use this business model.\nInstead of selling the malware outright, Vawtrak’s authors offer malware delivery based\non a service agreement. For example: A Number of Passwords stolen from X number\nof Users, using bank Y in country Z.28 There have been a few technical papers\ndetailing the analysis of the Vawtrak malware and its evolution over the years.29 In\nJanuary 2017, Vawtrak’s alleged author, Russian national Stanislav Vitaliyevich Lisov,\nwho went by the moniker “Black” and “Blackf,” was arrested and as of February 2019,\npled guilty to creating, running, and infecting users with the Vawtrak banking trojan.30\nVawtrak’s activity declined after Lisov’s arrest, however, another banking trojan, Bokbot\n(also known as IcedID) has been connected to the group behind Vawtrak.31\n\n**Emotet. This malware was first identified by security researchers in 2014 as a simple**\nbanking trojan. Later versions of the malware evolved and included the addition of\nmalware delivery services, including the ability to install other banking trojans.32 In\nAugust 2017, Emotet was connected to another banking trojan, Dridex—Emotet\n“dropped” Dridex as an additional payload.33 The technique of using one piece of\nmalware to drop another is not new, but it is significant to see banking trojans “working\ntogether.” As of September 2018, Emotet was utilizing the EternalBlue Windows\nvulnerability (first seen with the WannaCry ransomware) in order to propagate.34 This\npowerful vulnerability has had a patch out, however, there are still devices out there\nthat haven’t yet patched against the SMB (file sharing) vulnerability. Emotet is not a\ncontinually running malware; it tends to run through geographically centered\ncampaigns, yet its techniques are constantly evolving and it continues to be dangerous.\n\n\n**Kronos. Kronos is known in Greek mythology as the “Father of Zeus.” Kronos malware**\nwas first discovered in a Russian underground forum in 2014 after the takedown of\nGameover Zeus. It was more expensive than many other banking trojans, costing\n$7,000 to buy outright or $1,000 for a one-week trial. Many other banking trojans could\nbe bought from underground forums for hundreds, not thousands, of dollars. Kronos\nmarketed itself as one of the most sophisticated trojans, and many malware\nresearchers commented that its author(s) clearly had prior knowledge of malware\ntechniques.35 The code is well obfuscated using many different techniques. Security\nresearchers from Kaspersky Lab postulated that Kronos may be a spin-off of the\nCarberp banking trojan, The code is well obfuscated using many different techniques.\nSecurity researchers from Kaspersky Lab postulated that Kronos may be a spin-off of\nthe Carberp banking trojan,36 and IBM analysts also connected Kronos to Zeus through\nits compatible HTML injection mechanism 37 In August 2017 Marcus Hutchens the\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity researcher who single handedly put a halt to the WannaCry ransomware\noutbreak, was indicted and charged with writing with intent to distribute Kronos\nmalware. In April 2019, Hutchins pled guilty to two of the ten charges laid against\nhim.38 As of July 26th 2019, Hutchins was sentenced to time served with supervised\nrelease.39 Unlike many other banking trojans, Kronos did not die out with the arrest of a\nsupposed key author. In July 2018, Kronos reemerged with three distinct campaigns\ntargeting Germany, Japan, and Poland. There is also some circumstantial and\nspeculative evidence in the malware research community suggesting that Kronos has\nbeen rebranded and is being sold as the Osiris banking trojan.40 Kronos is still active\nand continues to be a threat.\n\n**Dyre. Also known as Dyreza, Dyzap, and Dyranges, Dyre first emerged in 2014**\ntargeting major online banking services. Dyre is allegedly a variant of Zeus malware,\nthough no official attribution to the source code can be confirmed.41 When Dyre first\nemerged, it sent shock waves through the malware analysis world with its\nsophistication and destructiveness. Dyre caused losses in the tens of millions of dollars\n[for large US-based banks. F5 labs reported in April 2015 that Dyre was the first trojan](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/dyre-in-depth-server-side-webinjects-i2p-evasion-and-sophisticated-encryption-22437)\nto use completely fake login pages, server-side web-injects, and modular architecture.\n[F5 labs published a comprehensive report on Dyre detailing its unique fraud](https://www.f5.com/content/dam/f5/downloads/REPORT-Dyre_In-Depth-Server-side_Webinjects_I2P_Evasion.pdf)\ntechniques, its crypto evolution, and stealth abilities. Along with its technical evolution,\nDyre moved on from targeting just banks to targeting software-as-a-service (SaaS)\n[companies such as Salesforce and browsers such as Microsoft Edge. In February](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/dyre-update-moving-to-edge-and-windows-10-with-anti-antivirus-22452)\n2016, researchers reported that Dyre had stopped spreading in November 2015 after\nRussian authorities arrested a number of gang members who were the alleged authors\nof Dyre’s code.42\n\n\n-----\n\n**Trickbot. Known as one of the successors to the infamous Dyre botnet, Trickbot**\n[continues to grow in sophistication and technique. F5 labs first reported on it as a pure](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/little-trickbot-growing-up-new-campaign-24412)\nbanking trojan targeting the financial services industry in 2016. It is typically spread\nthrough malicious spam emails, targets users’ financial information, and acts as a\nmalware dropper for other programs. Like many other pieces of malware, it can harvest\ncredentials, spread laterally through a network, and conduct reconnaissance.43 When\nTrickbot first burst onto the scene, the code looked a lot like Dyer’s source code,\nthough it was missing functionality in comparison. Like many pieces of financial\nmalware, Trickbot’s first iterations exclusively targeted financial institutions. It quickly\n[expanded its focus from banks in Australia, the UK, and Canada to banks in Germany,](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/trickbot-now-targeting-german-banking-group-sparkassen-finanzgruppe-24420)\nas well. Within months of its first reported actions, Trickbot quickly expanded from\nbanks to [include US Credit Card Companies,](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/trickbot-rapidly-expands-its-targets-in-august-shifting-focus-to-us-banks-and-credit-card-companies) [wealth management services, and](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/trickbot-focuses-on-wealth-management-services-from-its-dyre-core)\n[Customer Relationship Management providers. Further, Trickbot expanded its technical](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/trickbot-expands-global-targets-beyond-banks-and-payment-processors-to-crms)\n[capabilities by adding a layer of encryption. Reportedly last seen in January 2019,44](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/trickbot-gets-trickier-by-adding-an-encryption-layer)\nTrickbot has some new technical updates that include the ability to grab remote\napplication credentials. Trickbot’s authors are showing that they’re still active, and\ncompanies should be aware that this malware is still a threat.\n\n**Dridex. First seen in 2011, Dridex has had a longer evolutionary journey than most**\nmalwares and has survived through the years by obfuscating its main command-andcontrol (C&C) servers through proxies. Dridex’s first appearances45 in September 2011\ncame under the name Cidex. It caused destruction to banks until June 2014 when\nDridex version 1.1 appeared in the wild. Dridex emerged almost exactly one month\nafter Operation Tovar’s takedown of the Gameover ZeuS botnet, which also marked the\nend of Cidex attacks.46 Dridex and Gameover ZeuS have many similarities in their\ncode, and attribution for Dridex47 is tied to a Russian-speaking gang that may be a\nspinoff from the “Business Club,” an organized cybercrime gang that developed the\nGameover ZeuS botnet. A number of arrests were made in September 2015, but that\ndid little to stop Dridex. In February 2016, F5 labs published reports on the Dridex\n[Botnet 220 campaign noting the evolution of the malware, and then in April 2016 noted](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/dridex-update-moving-to-us-financials-with-vnc-22433)\nthat Dridex shifted focus from UK banks to US banks. In December 2018, researchers\nfound connections between Dridex, Emotet, and Ursnif/Gozi malware.48 It continues to\n[evolve technically and remains an active threat.](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/dridex-is-watching-you-22407)\n\n\n-----\n\n**DanaBot. One of the newer banking trojans, DanaBot first emerged in mid-2018,**\ntargeting Australian users. Since it first appeared in the wild, DanaBot has been seen\ntargeting European banks and email providers. Like many other banking trojans,\n[DanaBot has recently shifted focus away from exclusively targeting financial services](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/danabot-november-campaigns-target-european-banks)\ninstitutions for a number of reasons. Since users often share passwords across\nplatforms, compromising credentials is still useful for many cybercriminals. F5 Labs\n[also published a notable link between DanaBot, Gozi, and Tinba web injection patterns,](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/webinject-crafting-goes-professional-gozi-sharing-tinba-webinjects-22453)\nsupporting the idea that a great deal of fraud business logic is now implemented in\nJavaScript and sold to malware authors.\n\n**Ramnit. This unique banking trojan started out in 2010 as a worm and, sometime after**\nthe Zeus source code leak, acquired parts of the Zeus code and became a banking\ntrojan.50 Ramnit has continued to evolve in terms of sophistication, technique, and\nscope as a botnet since becoming a banking trojan. It remains active despite a\nshutdown of 300 command-and-control servers in February 2015.51 After this setback,\nRamnit reappeared in late 2015 and again in mid 2016.52 In early 2017, F5 labs\n[published a technical article breaking down Ramnit’s new disappearing configuration](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ramnits-latest-twist-a-disappearing-configuration-25079)\nfile. Like many other banking trojans, Ramnit has broadened its scope in recent years.\n[Over the 2017 holiday season, Ramnit’s target list was 64% eCommerce retailers in](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ramnit-goes-on-a-holiday-shopping-spree-targeting-retailers-and-banks)\naddition to financial services institutions. In 2018, Ramnit continued to work quickly,\ninfecting over 100,000 machines in two months.53 Ramnit continues to be distributed\nvia exploit kit and still runs active campaigns today, most recently returning back to\n[target Italian financial institutions.](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ramnit-returns-to-its-banking-roots--just-in-time-for-italian-ta)\n\n\n**Panda. Yet another Zeus variant, Panda was first discovered in Brazil in 2016, around**\nthe time of the Olympic games. Panda uses many of the traditional techniques from\nZeus, including man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks and keylogging, but sets itself apart\nthrough its advanced stealth capabilities. This has made analyzing the malware more\ndifficult. As of 2017, Panda was able to detect 23 forensic analytic tools and it is\npossible that it now detects even more.54 Like many other banking trojans, Panda has\nexpanded its target list beyond just financial services institutions, and in 2018 was\n[caught targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and social media websites. Moving to](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/panda-malware-broadens-targets-to-cryptocurrency-exchanges-and-social-media)\n[2019, Panda continued to expand its scope. The March 2019 campaign exclusively](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/panda-malware--it-s-not-just-about-cryptocurrencies-anymore)\ntargeted US-based companies, many of which are in the web services industry. Panda\nremains active; its stealth capabilities make it a unique malware family that continues to\nevade anti-virus software.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Backswap. A variant on Tinba, Backswap was first observed in March 2018 targeting**\nPolish banks and browsers. Backswap is written entirely in assembly language and is\nconsidered “position-independent code” (PIC), which means that it can be run from\nanywhere in memory. Its PIC status makes Backswap very different from other banking\ntrojans. The Polish CERT published a comprehensive technical analysis on the code.55\nBackswap quickly expanded scope in April 2018, adding additional banks and\n[techniques thoroughly detailed by F5 Labs. The evolution of techniques continued](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/backswap-defrauds-online-banking-customers-using-hidden-input-fi)\nthrough August 2018 when Backswap also made a geographical shift away from Polish\nbanks to exclusively target Spanish banks.56 Through the latter part of 2018 and early\n2019, Backswap continues to run campaigns, though its technical evolution has\nslowed.\n\n## Indications of Compromise for Users and Enterprises\n\nWhile it can be difficult for the average user to detect that their device has been\ncompromised, there are a number of clues to watch for. These clues can also be useful for\nsecurity professionals managing user systems:\n\n**Individuals:**\n\nBrowsers that load web pages slowly and run sites slowly.\nSlow computer start-up and slow performance when nothing else on the system is\nrunning could be a sign of a virus or trojan.\nA fan that is constantly running or a hard drive that is always spinning could be a sign\nof an infection.\nSuspicious behavior such as a computer suddenly slowing down, opening programs\nthat you didn’t open, closing programs repeatedly.\nNew or unexpected form elements in banking web pages, for example, fields that ask\nfor credit card numbers or PINs.\nFailed login attempts the first time you attempt to log in despite the password being\nentered correctly.\n\n**Individuals and enterprises:**\n\nUnexpected pop-up windows are often a sign of an infection. Clicking on those pop-ups\ncan install additional malware.\nMissing files or users noting that files are missing.\nHijacked email or other accounts.\nAnti-virus solutions that stop working.\nApplications that take a long time to start or won’t start at all.\nA computer that is actively doing something when no one is using it.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How Users Can Protect Against Banking Trojans\n\nKeep security, application, and utility software updated.\nUse two-actor authentication whenever the option is available.\nOnly download apps and files from trusted sources.\nUse a browser that you trust when doing online shopping and banking.\nUse all security features that banks offer.\nUse a password manager. Most banking trojans can log keystrokes. By using a\npassword manager to fill in passwords, you avoid physically typing in credentials, which\nessentially renders a keylogger useless.\nCompare your bank’s login screen on your computer with the same login screen on\nsomeone else’s to ensure they look the same.\nUse traffic filtering solutions to prevent data leakage.\nTake any security awareness training offered by your company or organization.\nLearn how to spot phishing emails and don’t click on suspicious links. This is how most\nbanking trojans are installed.\nLearn how to spot fake websites.\n\n## How Enterprises Can Protect Against Banking Trojans\n\n[Enterprises should consider implementing the following security controls based on their](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/education/what-are-security-controls)\nspecific circumstances:\n\n\n-----",
