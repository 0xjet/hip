    "plain_text": "# [Alert] New GlobeImposter of Olympian Gods 2.0 is coming\n\n**[sangfor.com/blog/cybersecurity/alert-new-globeimposter-olympian-gods-20-coming](https://www.sangfor.com/blog/cybersecurity/alert-new-globeimposter-olympian-gods-20-coming)**\n\nTag :\n\n[Cyber Security](https://www.sangfor.com/blog/cybersecurity)\n\nRecently, The Sangfor Security Team identified a new GlobeImposter ransomware strain,\nnaming it Globelmposter of Olympian Gods 2.0. Currently, several companies have suffered\nattacked and experienced a great many losses.\n\nWe found several variants with the following extensions appended to encrypted files:\nHermes865, Hades865 and Apollon865.\n\nSangfor identified the first strain of GlobeImposter of Olympian Gods in July 2019, finding\nthat first encrypted files were appended with the extension .ares666. In the subsequent two\nmonths, as the first version spread, companies and organizations in the manufacturing,\neducation and business verticals suffered attacks by the following variants: Zeus666,\nPoseidon666, Apollo666, Artemis666, Ares666, Aphrodite666, Dionysus666,\nPersephone666, Hephaestus666, Hades666, Demeter666 and Hera666.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the wide-spread first version of GlobeImposter, the attackers developed a second\nversion and changed appended extensions to those of Greek God + 865, like Hermes865,\nHades865 and Apollon865. The file type was changed from TXT file to EXE to enable autostartup.\n\nThis alert email is the same as the first version, i.e., Sin_Eater.666@aol.com. What is more,\nthe samples are alike. Without question, attacks by this variant were conducted by the same\nattackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Sangfor Security Team also discovered that this ransomware is in the debugging phase\nand encrypted viruses will generate another file named ids.txt, which is used to store an ID\nand printing error message:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis**\nAfter analyzing the captured samples, Sangfor found that it is nearlly identical to the first\nversion in code structure.\n\nAfter launch, the virus will first create a note file (HOW TO BACK YOUR FILES.exe) and\nthen disable the family group and then Windows defender.\n\nSubsequently, the virus will create an auto-startup item named WindowsUpdateCheck, which\nwill be executed through CMD to delete disk volumes, stop database service, traverse and\nmount volumes and traverse disk files:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter encrypting files, the virus will duplicate the note file to the encrypted file directory:\n\nFinally, the virus executes command through CMD to delete the RDP connection and system\nlogs and delete itself.\n\n**Solutions**\n\nCurrently there is no decryption tool for victims. You may isolate infected hosts and\ndisconnect them from network.\nWe recommend performing a virus scan and removal as soon as possible.\n\n**Detection and Removal**\n\n\n-----\n\nSangfor EDR and NGAF products are capable of detecting and removing this ransom virus.\n\nSangfor offers customers and users free anti-malware software to scan for and remove the\nvirus.\n\n**Protection**\n\nThe Sangfor Security Team recommends proactive protection, as there is no way to decrypt\nthe files encrypted by majority of ransom viruses.\n\n1. Fix the vulnerability quickly by installing the corresponding patch on the host.\n\n2. Back up critical data files regularly to other hosts or storage devices.\n\n3. Do not click on any email attachment from unknown sources and do not download any\nsoftware from untrusted websites.\n\n4. Disable unnecessary file sharing.\n\n5. Strengthen your computer password and do not use the same passwords for multiple\ncomputers to avoid compromising a series of computers.\n\n6. Disable RDP if it is unnecessary for your business. When computers are attacked, use\nSangfor NGAF or EDR to block port 3389 and stop the virus from spreading.\n\n7. Sangfor NGAF and EDR can prevent brute-force attacks. Turn on brute-force attack\nprevention on NGAF and enable Rules 11080051, 11080027 and 11080016. Turn on bruteforce attack prevention on Sangfor EDR.\n\n8. For Sangfor NGAF customers, update NGAF to version 8.0.5 and enable AI-based\nSangfor Engine Zero to achieve the most comprehensive protection.\n\n\n-----\n\n9. Deploy Sangfor security products and connect to cloud-based Sangfor Neural-X to detect\nnew threats.\n\n10. Sangfor SOC, featuring AI, is ready to quickly enhance security capabilities. SOC\nprovides services including checks on device security policies, security threats and relevant\nvulnerabilities to ensure timely risk detection, remediation and prevention, as well as policy\nupdate.\n\n11. Perform a security scan and virus removal on the entire network to enhance network\nsecurity. We recommend Sangfor NGAF and EDR to detect, prevent and protect your\ninternal network.\n\n\n-----",
