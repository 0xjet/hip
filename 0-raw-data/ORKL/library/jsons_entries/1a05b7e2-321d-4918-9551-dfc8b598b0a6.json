Due to the DDoS attack, it\nmay happen that the website will not be accessible from abroad, it said on Twitter. Around\n22:00 CEST the website was accessible from Czechia without any problem.\n\nNo severe impact has been caused so far, tweeted the National Office for Cyber and\nInformation security (NÚKIB) today.\n\nNa Åadu Ä�eskÃ½ch webÅ¯ probÃ haly DDoS Ãºtoky.

This\ntype of cyberattack aims to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server by overwhelming\nthe target with flooded requests from unknown IP addresses.\n\nCzech Railways has been tackling an outage on the Můj vlak (My train) mobile application\nsince Tuesday, railway spokesman Lukáš Kubát said on Wednesday morning. Buying tickets\nonline did not work, there were also problems finding connections.\n\nSmaller Czech airports also came under attack. The Karlovy Vary airport registered a DDoS\nattack on Wednesday night. The airport's website is still accessible from the Czech\nRepublic.\n\n\"By no means do the attacks affect the safety of transport,\" said the CEO of Karlovy Vary\nAirport Alice Undus.\n\nThe Karlovy Vary Airport does not operate any regular airline, and the number of visitors to\nits web is therefore low. \"We are monitoring the situation, but I think this will gradually\nsubside,\" she said.\n\n**RECOMMENDED ARTICLE**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Russian hackers may be behind cyber attacks on Czech hospitals, says ESET\n\nThe international airport in Pardubice recorded a hacker attack on Wednesday.\n\n\"It caused us a failure of the entire web system, our website does not work,\" said airport\nspokeswoman Mária Ministrová. The operation of the airport should not be affected by the\nattack, but Pardubice Airport will have everything checked by the company that provides the\ncomputer system.\n\n\"We are currently finding out what is happening, so I am not yet able to provide any relevant\ninformation,\" said Kateřina Pustějovská on behalf of Ostrava Airport. According to her,\neverything else works without problems.\n\n[In addition, a public administration portal was not available around 9 a.m. Wednesday.](https://portal.gov.cz/)\n\n\"Since Tuesday evening, the website of the Public Administration Portal has been the target\nof a cyber attack. For this reason, we have shut down the website and its security is currently\nbeing strengthened,\" said Adam Rőzler, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior. He\nnoted that users' data was safe.\n\n\"All systems that contain any data on citizens of the Czech Republic stood up to the attack. I\ncan assure everybody that no information and private data of the citizens got into the hands\nof anybody who should not handle them,\" Rakušan said.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the point of the ministry, the attack was a failure, he said.\n\nKillnet named about ten attacked websites including the O2 mobile network operator and the\nKomerční banka, which, nevertheless, registers no such attack. O2 registered increased\ntraffic on its servers, but the Internet services of O2 and its customers are adequately\nsecured, said Blanka Vokounová from the O2 press section.\n\nIn its statement on Twitter, the NÚKIB mentioned its previous warning of an increased risk of\ncyber attacks in connection with Russia's continuing military aggression against Ukraine.\n\n**RECOMMENDED ARTICLE**\n\n## Czech your cybersecurity: One in eight employees watch porn at the office\n\n\n-----\n\nThe information we have leads to a reasonable fear of a real threat of cyber espionage and\ncyber attacks on important targets in the Czech Republic, especially strategic public\nadministration institutions, elements of critical information infrastructure, basic services\n[information systems, and the media,\" stated an NÚKIB press release.](https://www.nukib.cz/cs/kontakty/pro-media/)\n\nThe Russian military attack on Ukraine started on February 24.
