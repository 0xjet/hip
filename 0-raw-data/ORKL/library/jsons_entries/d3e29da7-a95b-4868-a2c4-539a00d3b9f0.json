Its key feature lies in**\n**the fact that it is written in Go, a language developed by Google.**\n\n[A Trojan, named Linux.Lady.1, can execute a limited range of actions such as to determine](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Lady.1&lng=en)\nan external IP address of the infected computer, to attack other computers, and to download\n[and launch a cryptocurrency mining software. Linux.Lady.1 is written in the Google](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Lady.1&lng=en)\ndeveloped programming language—Go. Although Doctor Web security researchers have\nalready encountered Trojans written in Go, such malware programs are not frequently\ndetected in the wild. The architecture of the Trojan consists of numerous libraries published\non GitHub—the most popular collaborative application development service.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce **[Linux.Lady.1 is launched, it sends the following information to the command and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Lady.1&lng=en)**\ncontrol server: the current Linux version and the name of the operating system family it\nbelongs to, a number of CPUs, names and a number of running processes, and so on. The\nTrojan receives a configuration file necessary for downloading and launching of a\ncryptocurrency mining program in order to generate income which is then transferred to the\ncybercriminals’ e-wallet.\n\n**[Linux.Lady.1 can also determine an external IP address of the infected computer using](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Lady.1&lng=en)**\nspecial websites, specified in the configuration file, and attack other computers of the\nnetwork. The Trojan tries to connect to the remote servers via a port used by the Redis\n(remote dictionary server) data structure store, without entering a password in expectation\nthat the system has not been configured correctly. If the connection is established, the\n[malware adds a downloader script, named Linux.DownLoader.196, to the cron scheduler.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DownLoader.196&lng=en)\n[The script downloads a copy of Linux.Lady.1 and installs it on the compromised host. Then](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Lady.1&lng=en)\nthe Trojan adds a key for connection to the computer over SSH protocol to the list of\nauthorized keys.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Dr.Web for Linux successfully detects and removes Linux.Lady.1 and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Lady.1&lng=en)\n**[Linux.DownLoader.196, therefore, these malicious programs pose no threat to our users.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DownLoader.196&lng=en)**\n\n[More about this Trojan](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=8400823&lng=en)\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
