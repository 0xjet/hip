The Microsoft\nWindows OLE Package Manager Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114)\nallows attackers to embed Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) files from external\nlocations. The vulnerability can be exploited to download and install malware on to the\ntarget’s computer. The vulnerability appears to have been used by a cyberespionage\n[group known as Sandworm to deliver Backdoor.Lancafdo.A (also known as the Black](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-120911-3450-99)\nEnergy back door) to targeted organizations.\n\nThe vulnerability affects all versions of Windows from Windows Vista Service Pack 2 right\nup to to Windows 8.1 and Windows Server versions 2008 and 2012. It relates to how\nWindows handles OLE, a Microsoft technology that allows rich data from one document to\nbe embedded in another or a link to a document to be embedded in another. OLE is\ngenerally used for embedding locally stored content, but this vulnerability enables the\nunprompted download and execution of external files.\n\n**Active exploitation underway**\n\n[The vulnerability was disclosed by iSIGHT Partners, which said that the vulnerability had](http://www.isightpartners.com/2014/10/cve-2014-4114/)\nalready been exploited in a small number of cyberespionage attacks against NATO,\nseveral unnamed Ukrainian government organizations a number of Western European\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernmental organizations, companies operating in the energy sector, European\ntelecoms firms, and a US academic organization. According to our telemetry, attacks using\nthis payload have been underway since August. iSIGHT has attributed these attacks to an\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) group it has named Sandworm.\n\nAttacks to date have seen targeted individuals receive a spear-phishing email containing a\n[malicious PowerPoint file attachment, which is detected by Symantec as Trojan.Mdropper.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-031911-0600-99)\nThe PowerPoint file contains two embedded OLE documents containing URLs. If the\ntargeted user opens the PowerPoint file, these URLs are contacted and two files are\ndownloaded, one .exe and one .inf, which will install malware on the computer. Symantec\n[detects this malware payload as Backdoor.Lancafdo.A.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-120911-3450-99)\n\nOnce installed on the target’s computer, this back door allows attackers to download and\ninstall other malware. The malware may also download updates for itself, including an\ninformation-stealing component.\n\nWhile the current exploits are using PowerPoint files, given the nature of the vulnerability,\nwe may eventually see this exploit crop up in different Office file types such as Word\ndocuments or Excel spreadsheets.\n\nSymantec regards this vulnerability as critical, since it allows attackers to remotely run\ncode on the target’s computer. While it has been exploited on a limited basis in the wild,\nother groups are likely to attempt to take advantage of it now that its existence has been\npublicized.\n\n**Advice for businesses and consumers**\nSymantec advises all affected Windows users to take the following actions.\n\nImmediately [apply security patches once available from Microsoft](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms14-060)\nEnsure that your security software is up-to-date\nExercise caution when opening email attachments, particularly from unknown\nsources\n\n**Symantec protection**\nSymantec customers are protected against the malware being used in attacks exploiting\nthis vulnerability with the following detections. Symantec customers that use the\n[Symantec.Cloud service are protected from spam messages used to deliver malware.](http://www.symantec.com/products-solutions/families/?fid=symantec-cloud)\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**Intrusion Prevention**\n\n[Attack: Malicious File Download](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=27956)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Update** **– October 15, 2014:**\nMicrosoft has now issued a security bulletin which provides a patch for the vulnerability.\nSymantec recommends that all users apply the patch published in Microsoft Security\nBulletin MS14-060.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
