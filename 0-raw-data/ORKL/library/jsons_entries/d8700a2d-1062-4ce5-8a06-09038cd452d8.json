The group tends to](https://securelist.com/files/2014/07/EB-YetiJuly2014-Public.pdf)_\n_attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors. Companies attacked_\n_by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious_\n_concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased_\n_significantly._\n\n_The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting_\n_various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and logs._\n_Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main_\n_targets._\n\n_[Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)_ _advisory, which linked_\n_[the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/alerts/hostile-state-actors-compromising-uk-organisations-focus-engineering-and-industrial-control)_\n\n_[This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/)_\n_and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers_\n_compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early 2017._\n\n**2**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attack victims\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of compromised servers (based on the language of website\ncontent and/or the origins of the company renting the server at the time of compromise) by countries,\nattacked company types and the role of each server in the overall attack scheme. Victims of the threat\nactor’s attacks were not limited to industrial companies.\n\n**Table 1.

In this attack type, the attackers' goal is to extract the following data from\nthe session:\n\n  - user IP,\n\n  - user name,\n\n  - domain name,\n\n  - NTLM hash of the user’s password.\n\nIt should be noted that the image requested using the link is not physically located on the remote server.\n\n### Scanned resources\n\nCompromised servers are in some cases used to conduct attacks on other resources. In the process of\nanalyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identified that the attackers had scanned\nwith various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool descriptions are provided below).\n\n**4**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2.

Even though the scanned\nservers do not necessarily look like potential final victims, it is likely that the attackers scanned different\nresources to find a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the attackers’ tools and,\nsubsequently, to develop the attack.\n\nPart of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting waterhole\nresources.\n\nIn some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the attackers went\nthrough the list of possible domains matching a given IP.\n\nIn most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified – with the possible\nexception of sites on the Bump platform, flight tracker servers and servers of a Turkish hotel chain.\n\nCuriously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources links to which\nwere found on this site. These may have been links to resources developed by the site’s owner:\n[www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ru](http://www.esodedi.ru/)\n\n**6**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Toolset used\n\n#### Utilities\n\nUtilities found on compromised servers are open-source and publicly available on GitHub:\n\n  - Nmap – an open-source utility for analyzing the network and verifying its security.\n\n  - [Dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) — a simple command-line tool for brute forcing (performing exhaustive searches of)\ndirectories and files on websites.\n\n  - [Sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) — an open-source penetration testing tool, which automates the process of identifying\nand exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and taking over database servers.\n\n  - [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) — a tool written in Python designed to enumerate website subdomains. The tool uses\nopen-source intelligence [(OSINT). Sublist3r supports many different search engines, such as](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSINT)\nGoogle, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask, as well as such services as Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd,\nDNSdumpster and ReverseDNS. The tool helps penetration testers to collect information on the\nsubdomains of the domain they are researching.\n\n  - [Wpscan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) — a WordPress vulnerability scanner that uses the blackbox principle, i.e., works without\naccess to the source code. It can be used to scan remote WordPress sites in search of security\nissues.\n\n  - [Impacket](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket) — a toolset for working with various network protocols, which is required by SMBTrap.\n\n  - [SMBTrap — a tool for logging data received over the SMB protocol (user IP address, user name,](https://github.com/CylanceSPEAR/SMBTrap)\ndomain name, password NTLM hash).\n\n  - [Commix](https://github.com/commixproject/commix) — a vulnerability search and command injection and exploitation tool written in Python.\n\n  - [Subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute) – a subdomain enumeration tool available for Python and Windows that uses an open\nname resolver as a proxy and does not send traffic to the target DNS server.\n\n  - [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) – a mail sending tool.\n\nIn addition, a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers. The script was\ndesigned to check FTP hosts from an incoming list.\n\n#### Malicious php files\n\nThe following malicious php files were found in different directories in the nginx folder and in a working\ndirectory created by the attackers on an infected web servers:\n\n**Time of the**\n\n**Brief**\n**File name** **md5sum** **latest file** **Size, bytes**\n**description**\n\n**change (MSK)**\n\nwso shell+ 2016-07-01\nini.php f3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865 28786\nmail 15:57:38\n\nwso shell+ 2016-06-12\nmysql.php f3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865 28786\nmail 13:35:30\n\n**7**\n\n|File name|Brief description|md5sum|Time of the latest file change (MSK)|Size, bytes|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|ini.php|wso shell+ mail|f3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865|2016-07-01 15:57:38|28786|\n|mysql.php|wso shell+ mail|f3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865|2016-06-12 13:35:30|28786|\n\n\n-----\n\n|opts.php|wso shell|c76470e85b7f3da46539b40e5c552712|2016-06-12 12:23:28|36623|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|error_log.php|wso shell|155385cc19e3092765bcfed034b82ccb|2016-06-12 10:59:39|36636|\n|code29.php|web shell|1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51|2016-06-12 11:10:40|10724|\n|proxy87.php|web shell|1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51|2016-06-12 14:31:13|10724|\n|theme.php|wso shell|2292f5db385068e161ae277531b2e114|2017-05-16 17:33:02|133104|\n|sma.php|PHPMailer|7ec514bbdc6dd8f606f803d39af8883f|2017-05-19 13:53:53|14696|\n|media.php|wso shell|78c31eff38fdb72ea3b1800ea917940f|2017-04-17 15:58:41|1762986|\n\n\nIn the table above:\n\n  - Web shell is a script that allows remote administration of the machine.\n\n  - WSO is a popular web shell and file manager (it stands for “Web Shell by Orb”) that has the ability\nto masquerade as an error page containing a hidden login form. It is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/wso-shell/WSO\n\nTwo of the PHP scripts found, ini.php and mysql.php, contained a WSO shell concatenated with the\nfollowing email spamming script:\n[https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/db-config.php](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/db-config.php)\n\n**8**\n\n\n-----\n\nAll the scripts found are obfuscated.\n\n\n_wso shell – error_log.php_\n\n**9**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Deobfuscated wso shell – error_log.php_\n\n**10**\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the web shells was found on the server under two different names (proxy87.php and code29.php).\nIt uses the eval function to execute a command sent via HTTP cookies or a POST request:\n\n_Web shell – proxy87.php_\n\n**11**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Deobfuscated web shell – proxy87.php_\n\n#### Modified sshd\n\nA modified sshd with a preinstalled backdoor was found in the process of analyzing the server.\n\nPatches with some versions of backdoors for sshd that are similar to the backdoor found are available on\nGitHub, for example:\n[https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit](https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit)\n\nCompilation is possible on any OS with binary compatibility.\n\n**12**\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of replacing the original sshd file with a modified one on the infected server, an attacker can\nuse a ‘master password’ to get authorized on the remote server, while leaving minimal traces (compared\nto an ordinary user connecting via ssh).\n\nIn addition, the modified sshd logs all legitimate ssh connections (this does not apply to the connection\nthat uses the ‘master password’), including connection times, account names and passwords. The log is\nencrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock.\n\n_Decrypted log at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock_\n\n### Activity of the attackers on compromised servers\n\nIn addition to using compromised servers to scan numerous resources, other attacker activity was also\nidentified.\n\nAfter gaining access to the server, the attackers installed the tools they needed at different times.\nSpecifically, the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the servers:\n\n  - apt install traceroute\n\n  - apt-get install nmap\n\n  - apt-get install screen\n\n  - git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git\n\n**13**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed.\n\nThe diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers during one month.\nThe attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days. In most cases, they logged on to the server at\nroughly the same time of day, probably in the morning hours:\n\n19:12:00\n\n18:00:00\n\n16:48:00\n\n15:36:00\n\n14:24:00\n\n13:12:00\n\n12:00:00\n\n10:48:00\n\n9:36:00\n\n8:24:00\n\n_Times of illegitimate connections with the server (GMT+3)_\n\nIn addition, in the process of performing the analysis, an active process was identified that exploited SQL\ninjection and collected data from a database of one of the victims.\n\n**14**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these servers are as\nfollows:\n\n1. With rare exceptions, the group’s members get by with publicly available tools. The use of publicly\n\navailable utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution without\nany additional group ‘markers’ very difficult.\n2. Potentially, any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want\n\nto establish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities.\n3. In most cases that we have observed, the group performed tasks related to searching for\n\nvulnerabilities, gaining persistence on various hosts, and stealing authentication data.\n4. The diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers’ interests.\n5. It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of or\n\ntakes orders from customers that are external to it, performing initial data collection, the theft of\nauthentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack’s further\ndevelopment.\n\n### Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n#### Filenames and Paths\n\n##### Tools*\n/usr/lib/libng/ftpChecker.py\n\n/usr/bin/nmap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/dirsearch/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/dirsearch/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/SMBTrap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/commix/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/subbrute-master/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/sqlmap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/sqlmap-dev/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/wpscan/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/wpscan/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/Sublist3r/\n\n*Note that these tools can also be used by other threat actors.\n\n**15**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### PHP files:\n/usr/share/python2.7/sma.php\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/theme.php\n\n/root/theme.php\n\n/usr/lib/libng/media.php\n\n##### Logs\n/var/tmp/.pipe.sock\n\n#### PHP file hashes\n\nf3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865\n\nc76470e85b7f3da46539b40e5c552712\n\n155385cc19e3092765bcfed034b82ccb\n\n1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51\n\n2292f5db385068e161ae277531b2e114\n\n7ec514bbdc6dd8f606f803d39af8883f\n\n78c31eff38fdb72ea3b1800ea917940f\n\n#### Yara rules\n\nrule Backdoored_ssh {\n\nstrings:\n\n$a1 = \"OpenSSH\"\n\n$a2 = \"usage: ssh\"\n\n$a3 = \"HISTFILE\"\n\ncondition:\n\nuint32(0) == 0x464c457f and filesize<1000000 and all of ($a*)\n\n}\n\n**16**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix II – Shell script to check a server for tools\n\n#### Shell script for Debian\n\ncd /tmp\n\nworkdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317b70ca2\n\nmkdir $workdir\n\ncd $workdir\n\nfind / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null\n\ndpkg -l | grep -E \\(impacket\\|pcapy\\|nmap\\) > dpkg-grep.txt\n\ncp /var/lib/dpkg/info/openssh-server.md5sums . #retrieve initial hash for sshd\n\nmd5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual hash for sshd\n\n#### Shell script for Centos\n\ncd /tmp\n\nworkdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317b70ca2\n\nmkdir $workdir\n\ncd $workdir\n\nfind / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nrpm -qa | grep -E \\(impacket\\|pcapy\\|nmap\\) > rpm-grep.txt\n\nrpm -qa --dump | grep ssh > rpm-qa-dump.txt #retrieve initial hash for sshd\n\nsha256sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.sha256sum #calculate actual sha256 hash for sshd\n\nmd5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual md5 hash for sshd\n\n**17**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Kaspersky Lab Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT) is a global project of Kaspersky Lab aimed at coordinating the work of industrial automation system vendors, owners and operators of industrial facilities and IT security researchers in addressing issues associated with protecting industrial enterprises and critical infrastructure facilities. \n\n Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT Ics-cert@kaspersky.com\n\n**18**\n\n\n-----",
