But if there is an original file smaller than 3 GB, then\nonly small files can be decrypted.\"\n\nTo decrypt your files, you need at least one of the original files:\n\nTo decrypt small files (less than or equal to 3 GB), you need a pair of files with a size\nof 1024 bytes or more. This is enough to decrypt all other small files.\nTo decrypt big files (more than 3 GB), you need a pair of files (encrypted and original)\nno less than 3 GB in size each. This will be enough to decrypt both big and small files.\n\n**To decrypt files encrypted by Yanluowang ransomware, you have to use the Rannoh**\n**decryption tool available for** **[download from Kaspersky's servers.](http://support.kaspersky.com/8547)**\n\n_Kaspersky RannohDecryptor (BleepingComputer)_\n\n## Yanluowang attacks high-profile enterprise targets\n\n[Yanluowang ransomware, first spotted in October 2021, has been used in human-operated,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-yanluowang-ransomware-used-in-targeted-enterprise-attacks/)\nhighly targeted attacks against enterprise entities.\n\nOne month later, one of its affiliates was observed attacking US organizations in the\nfinancial sector since at least August, using the BazarLoader malware for reconnaissance.\n\nBased on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in these attacks, this\nYanluowang affiliate was linked to the Thieflock ransomware operation developed by the\n[Fivehands group (tracked by Mandiant as UNC2447).](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomware-group-uses-sonicwall-zero-day-to-breach-networks/)\n\nOnce deployed on compromised networks, Yanluowang stops hypervisor virtual machines,\nends all processes, and encrypts files appending the .yanluowang extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also drops ransom notes named README.txt that warn victims not to contact law\nenforcement or ask any ransomware negotiation firms for help.\n\nIf the attackers' requests are not met, the ransomware operators threaten to launch\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the victims' networks and inform their\nemployees and business partners they were breached.\n\nThey also say they'll breach the victims' networks again \"in a few weeks\" and delete their\ndata, a common tactic ransomware gangs use to pressure their victims into paying the\nransom.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryptor/)\n[Rannoh Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rannoh-decryptor/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Yanluowang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/yanluowang/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
