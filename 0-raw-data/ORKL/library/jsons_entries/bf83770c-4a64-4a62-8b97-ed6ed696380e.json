Opposing factions to and dissidents\nof the Russian government, international\nmedia, and even the national security\ndepartment of a U.S. ally were also targeted.\nThe threat actors used three attack vectors―\nspear-phishing emails with malicious\nattachments, an advanced network of\nphishing websites, and exploits injected into\nlegitimate conference and media websites.\nThey used a nonmalicious JavaScript to\nvictimize Microsoft™ Outlook® Web Access\n(OWA) users from carefully selected target\norganizations. The OWA phishing attacks\nproved extremely effective and could be\n\n\nparticularly dangerous to any organization\nthat allows employees to use OWA.\n\nAn in-depth look at six multistage attacks\nrevealed one thing in common―the use of\nSEDNIT/Sofacy malware [1], [2]. The use\nof such multistage downloaders provided\nattackers additional protection against\ndetection. We believe the threat actors aimed\nto confuse their targets’ IT administrators\nby making it hard for them to string attack\ncomponents together, thus evading detection.\n\nThis research paper details when certain\nattacks occurred, what tools were used in\nattempts to get in to target networks, and\ntarget profiles to form a general picture of\nOperation Pawn Storm.\n\n\n-----\n\n## TIES THAT BIND THE OPERATION PAWN STORM ATTACKS TOGETHER\n\n\n#### SEDNIT\n\nSEDNIT malware are mostly backdoors [3], [4]\nand information stealers [5] that log affected\nusers’ keystrokes, steal system information,\nand send stolen information to remote\ncommand-and-control (C&C) servers.\n\nAnalyses of the SEDNIT infectors that arrived\nas email attachments in the attacks featured\nin this paper revealed six distinct chains [see\ndiagram on page 3].\n\n\n#### Attack Timeline\n\nThe investigation focused on a group of\nattacks that has been dubbed “Operation\nPawn Storm” [6] due to the attackers’ use of\ntwo or more connected tools/tactics to attack\na specific target similar to the chess strategy\nit was named after. This paper illustrates how\nthe Pawn Storm attacks were carried out with\nthe aid of five spear-phishing emails, which\nused contextually relevant subjects to get\nspecific targets from different countries to\nopen weaponized attachments designed to\ncompromise their systems.\n\n\n_Timeline of spear-phishing emails sent to specific targets_\n\n\nThe attackers sent emails to potential victims,\nincluding military, embassy, and defense\ncontractor personnel. The following emails\nwere among those that were found related to\nthis operation:\n\n   - An email sent to a potential victim\nfrom the Ministry of Defense in France\nhad an exploit for CVE-2010-3333\n\n[7] disguised as a document named\n\n\n_“International Military.rtf.” Trend Micro_\nreceived a sample of this on October\n17, 2011 and has been detecting it as\nTROJ_ARTIEF.AP [8] since then.\n\n- An email sent to a potential victim\nworking from the Vatican Embassy\nin Iraq used reports of a bombing\nincident [9] that occurred on January\n9, 2012 as social engineering lure.\n\n\n\n[7] disguised as a document named 9, 2012 as social engineering lure.\n\n\n-----\n\nSent a day after the incident,\nthe email had a Microsoft\nWord® file attachment named\n_“IDF_Spokesperson_Terror__\n_Attack_011012.doc,” which_\nexploited CVE-2012-0158 [10].\n\n\n_SEDNIT infectors attached to targeted attack campaign emails_\n\n_Exploit for CVE-2012-0158 disguised as a_\n\n_Word (.DOC) file_\n\n_Sample email sent to recipients from the_\n\n_Vatican Embassy in Iraq_\n\n\n_Vatican Embassy in Iraq_\n\n\n-----\n\n   - An email sent on September 20,\n2013 to military officials from several\ncountries used the then-upcoming\n“Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC) Indonesia 2013” conference\nas bait. The email had two Microsoft\nExcel® file attachments named\n_“APEC Media list 2013 Part1.xls,”_\nwhich exploited CVE-2012-0158, and\n_“APEC Media list 2013 Part2.xls,”_\nwhich was nonmalicious.\n\n_Sample email sent to military officials across_\n\n_countries using the “APEC Indonesia 2013”_\n\n_conference as bait_\n\n_Exploit for CVE-2012-0158 disguised as an Excel_\n\n_(.XLS) file (APEC Media list 2013 Part1.xls)_\n\n   - An email sent to Pakistani military\nofficials on January 23, 2014 used the\n“Homeland Security Summit Middle\nEast” [11] conference as bait. It had a\nWord file attachment named “Details.\n\n\n_doc,” which exploited CVE-2012-_\n0158.\n\n_Sample email sent to military officials from_\n_Pakistan using the “Homeland Security Summit_\n\n_Middle East” conference as bait_\n\n   - An email sent to Polish government\nemployees [12] on August 11, 2014\nhad a MIME HTML (.MHT) file\nattachment named “MH17.doc,” which\nexploited CVE-2012-0158.\n\n_Exploit for CVE-2012-0158 disguised as a MIME_\n\n_HTML (.MHT) file_\n\n#### Attack Details\n\nAll of the observed Operation Pawn Storm\nattacks comprised several stages. Each\nattack had at least two phases:\n\n   - In phase 1, opening the email\nattachment displays a decoy\ndocument while the exploit runs in\nthe background. The exploit drops\na downloader component (.DLL file)\nnamed “netids.dll,” “netidt.dll,” or\n_“coreshell.dll.”_\n\n\nWord file attachment named “Details.\n\n\n-----\n\n- In phase 2, the downloader\ncomponent communicates with a C&C\nserver and downloads a dropper that\nultimately installs a keylogger. After\n\n\ncapturing information from infected\nsystems, the keylogger sends data\nback to the C&C server.\n\n\n_Phases 1 and 2 in an Operation Pawn Storm attack_\n\n\nWe only managed to collect latterstage payloads for two out of the six\naforementioned attacks. The C&C servers\ntied to the other four attacks refused to serve\nthe rest of the files to complete the attack\nchains.\n\nMultistage attacks are a double-edged sword.\nIf one link in the attack chain, aside from\nthe end node, is detected and removed in\nthe initial infection stage, the entire attack\nfails. On the other hand, having several\nlinks in the attack chain makes detecting the\nfinal component more difficult. Tracing the\nprevious and next links is also difficult when\nany of the components is inspected on its\nown outside the attack chain.\n\n\nAlthough some of the C&C servers were still\nalive at the time of investigation, they did not\nrespond to our infected systems. Repeated\nattempts to trick the C&C servers into serving\nthe next files in the incomplete attack chains\nfailed. The attacks they were tied to could be\ntime sensitive and it is possible that they no\nlonger hosted the files for succeeding stages.\n\n#### Attack Evolution\n\nEven though the filenames used for different\ncomponents remained fairly consistent from\n2010 to the present, earlier attacks were\nmore elaborate and complex compared with\nthose seen this year. The 2014 attacks we\nhave seen were more streamlined.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Comparison of an Operation Pawn Storm attack in 2011 and another in 2014_\n\n\nAlthough variations in past and current\nattack chains exist, both are still being\nused by threat actors to date to ensure one\n\n\nthing—detection evasion. The following table\ncompares and contrasts the six Operation\nPawn Storm attacks in greater detail.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Operation Pawn Storm Attack Comparison|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Case 1|Case 2|Case 3 [13]|Case 4|Case 5|Case 6|\n|Unknown exploit, possibly disguised as a .PDF, .DOC, or .RTF file, carries the top-level dropper (dropper.exe;

These websites did not\nhost malicious content but visiting them\ndid lead to the automatic execution of a\nnonmalicious JavaScript. Links to these fake\nwebsites were then embedded in spearphishing emails and sent to selected targets.\n\nOpening such an email and clicking the\nlink in OWA redirected victims to legitimate\nwebsites. The JavaScript made it appear that\nthe victims’ OWA sessions ended while at\nthe same time, tricked them into reentering\ntheir credentials. To do this, the attackers\nredirected victims to fake OWA log-in pages\nby setting their browsers’ open windows\nproperty. The victims’ credentials thus ended\nup in the attackers’ hands.\n\nNote that two special conditions need to\nbe met for the attacks to succeed—victims\nshould use OWA and click the embedded\nlinks via the web portal’s preview pane. The\nattacks worked on any popular browser such\nas Firefox®, Safari®, Chrome™, and Internet\nExplorer®. No vulnerabilities need to be\nexploited for the JavaScript to work.\n\nBecause many companies allow employees\nto use webmail services to access their\nmailboxes while on business travel or at\nhome, these attacks are likely to succeed.\nOnce they do, attackers can gain access to\ncompromised mailboxes that they can then\nuse to gain a foothold in target networks.\n\nThroughout the course of investigation,\nseveral targets have been identified,\nincluding:\n\n   - ACADEMI, formerly Blackwater\n(United States)\n\n   - Broadcasting companies in various\n\n\ncountries\n\n   - Military attachés from various\ncountries\n\n   - Ministry of Defense (France)\n\n   - Ministry of Defense (Hungary)\n\n   - Multinational company based in\nGermany\n\n   - Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) (Austria)\n\n   - Pakistani military officials\n\n   - Polish government employees\n\n   - SAIC (United States)\n\n   - U.S. Department of State\n\n   - Vatican Embassy (Iraq)\n\nThe following case studies reveal more indepth details on four specific attacks.\n\n##### CASE 1: MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, HUNGARY\n\n**•** **Malicious conference domain:**\n_eurosatory2014 . com_\n\n**•** **Real conference domain:**\n_eurosatory . com_\n\n**•** **Phished OWA domain: mail . hm .**\n_qov . hu_\n\n**•** **Real OWA domain: mail.hm.gov.hu**\n\nThe attackers created a domain that was\nvery similar to eurosatory . com [14], a website\nfor an international land and air-land defense\nand security exhibition. They then sent emails\nwith the link, http :// eurosatory2014 . com, to\nselected employees of the target defense\nministry who might actually have been\nexpecting to hear from the conference staff\n\n\n\n             - Broadcasting companies in various expecting to hear from the conference staff\n\n\n-----\n\nmembers.\n\nClicking the link embedded in the email\nvia the OWA preview pane opens the real\nconference website in a new tab. The victims’\nOWA session in the other tab, meanwhile,\nis redirected to a phished log-in page that\nmakes it look like the session has ended.\n\n_Real “EUROSATORY 2014” conference website_\n\n_opens in a new tab after clicking the link in a_\n\n_spear-phishing email viewed in OWA_\n\n\n_“Closed” OWA session page (fake) victims will_\n\n_see, forcing them to reenter their credentials_\n\nIn reality, the victims’ OWA session did not\nend. The previously mentioned JavaScript\njust redirected them to a fake OWA login page that looks just like the Ministry of\nDefense in Hungary’s real one.\n\nApart from “EUROSATORY 2014,” other\nconferences were also used to target\nemployees of the Ministry of Defense in\nHungary as shown in the following table.\n\n|Similar Attacks Against the Ministry of Defense, Hungary|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Conference|Target Domain|Malicious Domain|\n|“Africa Aerospace and Defence 2014”|aadexpo . co . za|aadexpo2014 . co . za|\n|“The 10th Special Operations Forces Exhibition & Conference”|sofexjordan . com|sofexjordan2014 . com|\n|“ITEC”|itec . co . uk|itec2014 . co . uk|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CASE 2: OSCE, AUSTRIA\n\n**•** **Malicious news domain: vice - news .**\n_com_\n\n**•** **Real news domain: news . vice . com**\n\n**•** **Phished OWA domain: log-in - osce .**\n_org_\n\n**•** **Real OWA domain: log-in . osce . org**\n\nThis attack targeted OSCE employees in\nAustria. Although the attackers used similar\ntactics, they did not spoof a conference\nwebsite. They instead used a fake version of\nthe news website, news . vice . com.\n\n_Comparison of the legitimate (top) and spoofed_\n\n_(bottom) OWA log-in pages of OSCE_\n\nEven though OSCE provides better security\nfor webmail users compared with the other\ntargets via one-time session token use during\nlog-in, attackers can still steal highly sensitive\ndata from victims by hijacking a single\nsession.\n\n##### CASE 3: SAIC, UNITED STATES\n\n**•** **Malicious conference domain:**\n_natoexhibitionff14 . com_\n\n\n\n**•** **Real conference domain:**\n_natoexhibition . org_\n\n**•** **Phished OWA domain: webmail -**\n_saic . com_\n\n**•** **Real OWA domain: webmail . saic .**\n_com_\n\nThis attack targeting SAIC was very similar\nto the first case. The attackers spoofed\nthe website of the “Future Forces 2014”\nconference to trick email recipients into\nhanding over their webmail credentials.\n\n_Comparison of the legitimate (top) and spoofed_\n\n_(bottom) OWA log-in pages of SAIC_\n\n##### CASE 4: ACADEMI\n\n**•** **Malicious news domain: tolonevvs .**\n_com_\n\n**•** **Real news domain: tolonews . com**\n\n**•** **Phished OWA domain: academl .**\n_com_\n\n**•** **Real OWA domain: academi . com**\n\n\n_natoexhibitionff14 . com_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attack targeted the employees of U.S.\ndefense contractor, ACADEMI, using the\nsame phishing tactics as in the second case.\n\n_Comparison of the legitimate (top) and spoofed_\n\n_(bottom) OWA log-in pages of ACADEMI_\n\n\nApart from the four specific cases presented\nabove, evidence pointing to a fake OWA\nserver for a multinational company based in\nGermany was also discovered. The threat\nactors registered a domain that looked\nvery similar to the target’s real domain and\npurchased a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\ncertificate for the fake domain as part of\npreparations for a targeted attack. Trend\nMicro was able to warn the target early on,\nwhich helped thwart the threat.\n\n#### Other Webmail Services\n\nOWA users are not the only ones at risk\nthough, as the threat actors behind Operation\nPawn Storm also targeted users of free\nwebmail services such as Gmail™, Live Mail,\nYahoo!®, Hushmail, and Yandex.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Sample Gmail, Live Mail, Hushmail, and Yandex account phishing websites_\n\n\nWe leaked specific credentials to the threat\nactors in a couple of cases to see if the\nfake webmail service log-in pages were\nindeed intended for attack use. Within\nminutes of leaking the test credentials,\nunauthorized log-ins were recorded. The\nfirst log-in was usually an automated login check from the same IP address as the\nphishing website’s owner. The succeeding\nlog-ins were made from the IP addresses,\n\n\n_46.166.162.90 (Latvia) and 192.154.110.244_\n(United States), via Internet Message Access\nProtocol (IMAP). No other forms of abuse\nsuch as sending spam via the compromised\naccounts were witnessed. This showed that\nthe attackers were indeed trying to obtain\nsensitive data from their targets instead\nof using their accounts for fraud and other\nfinancially motivated scams.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nOperation Pawn Storm used next-level\nspear-phishing tactics to obtain the email\ncredentials of primarily military, embassy,\nand defense contractor personnel from the\nUnited States and its allies. The threat actors\nused a mix of spear-phishing emails and\nspecially crafted webmail service phishing\nwebsites to gain access to victims’ inboxes in\nhopes of getting better footholds inside target\norganizations. So as not to raise suspicion,\nthe attackers used well-known events and\nconferences as social engineering bait. They\nhave been quite persistent as well, as we\nhave seen evidence that attacks have been\ngoing on since 2007.\n\nApart from effective phishing tactics, the\nthreat actors used a combination of proven\ntargeted attack staples to compromise\nsystems and get in to target networks—\nexploits and data-stealing malware. SEDNIT\nvariants particularly proved useful, as\nthese allowed the threat actors to steal all\nmanners of sensitive information from the\nvictims’ computers while effectively evading\ndetection.\n\nTrend Micro has notified the targets that have\nbeen identified in this paper. Individuals and\ntheir respective organizations, meanwhile,\nshould use solutions that can help protect\nagainst the various attack vectors that the\nthreat actors behind Operation Pawn Storm\nused.\n\n\nMessaging security solutions such as Trend\nMicro™ InterScan™ Messaging Security\n\n[15] and the ScanMail™ Suite for Microsoft\nExchange [16] can send suspicious email\nattachments to a sandbox for analysis, thus\nprotecting recipients from threats. Other\nproducts such as OfficeScan™ [17] for\nendpoints and InterScan Web Security Virtual\nAppliance [18] for gateways can also block\nuser access to known phishing sites.\n\nFor overall protection against targeted\nattacks, Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery\n\n[19] can help protect potential targets by\nsandboxing and analyzing suspicious\nattachments to identify phishing emails via\nEmail Inspector. Via 360-degree monitoring\nof network traffic to get networkwide\nvisibility and intelligence, Deep Discovery\nallows users to detect and respond to\ntargeted attacks and advanced threats.\nIt also monitors all ports and more than\n80 protocols, giving users the broadest\nprotection available. Even more, specialized\ndetection engines and custom sandboxing\nhelp identify and analyze malware, C&C\ncommunications, and evasive attacker\nactivities that are invisible to standard\nsecurity solutions. Along with in-depth threat\nintelligence, it allows for rapid response\nand automatic sharing with other security\nproducts to create real-time custom defense\nagainst attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] Trend Micro Incorporated.
