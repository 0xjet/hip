    "plain_text": "For several months, we have been monitoring an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign against South\n\nKorean think-tanks. There are multiple reasons why this campaign is extraordinary in its execution and\n\nlogistics. It all started one day when we encountered a somewhat unsophisticated spy program that\n\ncommunicated with its \"master\" via a public e-mail server. This approach is rather inherent to many\n\namateur virus-writers and these malware attacks are mostly ignored.\n\nHowever, there were a few things that attracted our attention:\n\nThe public e-mail server in question was Bulgarian - mail.bg.\n\nThe compilation path string contained Korean hieroglyphs.\n\nThese two facts compelled us take a closer look at this malware -- Korean compilers alongside Bulgarian e\nmail command-and-control communications.\n\nThe complete path found in the malware presents some Korean strings:\n\nD:rsh��UAC_dll(��)Releasetest.pdb\n\nThe \"rsh\" word, by all appearances, means a shortening of \"Remote Shell\" and the Korean words can be\n\ntranslated in English as \"attack\" and \"completion\", i.e.:\n\nD:rshATTACKUAC_dll(COMPLETION)Releasetest.pdb\n\nAlthough the full list of victims remains unknown, we managed to identify several targets of this\n\ncampaign. According to our technical analysis, the attackers were interested in targeting following\n\norganizations\".\n\nThe Sejong Institute\n\n_The Sejong Institute is a non-profit private organization for public interest and a leading think tank in_\n\n_South Korea, conducting research on national security strategy, unification strategy, regional issues,_\n\n_and international political economy._\n\nKorea Institute For Defense Analyses (KIDA)\n\n_KIDA is a comprehensive defense research institution that covers a wide range of defense-related issues._\n\n_KIDA is organized into seven research centers: the Center for Security and Strategy; the Center for_\n\n_Military Planning; the Center for Human Resource Development; the Center for Resource Management;_\n\n_the Center for Weapon Systems Studies; the Center for Information System Studies; and the Center for_\n\n\n-----\n\n_KIDA s mission is to contribute to rational defense policy-making through intensive and systematic_\n\n_research and analysis of defense issues._\n\nMinistry of Unification\n\n_The Ministry of Unification is an executive department of the South Korean government responsible for_\n\n_working towards the reunification of Korea. Its major duties are: establishing North Korea Policy,_\n\n_coordinating inter-Korean dialogue, pursuing inter-Korean cooperation and educating the public on_\n\n_unification._\n\nHyundai Merchant Marine\n\n_Hyundai Merchant Marine is a South Korean logistics company providing worldwide container_\n\n_shipping services._\n\nSome clues also suggest that computers belonging to \"The supporters of Korean Unification\"\n\n(http://www.unihope.kr/) were also targeted. Among the organizations we counted, 11 are based in South\n\nKorea and two entities reside in China.\n\nPartly because this campaign is very limited and highly targeted, we have not yet been able to identify how\n\nthis malware is being distributed. The malicious samples we found are the early stage malware most often\n\ndelivered by spear-phishing e-mails.\n\n## Infecting a system\n\nThe initial Trojan dropper is a Dynamic Link Library functioning as a loader for further malware. It does\n\nnot maintain exports and simply delivers another encrypted library maintained in its resource section.\n\nThis second library performs all the espionage functionality.\n\nWhen running on Windows 7, the malicious library uses the Metasploit Framework's open-source code\n\nWin7Elevate to inject malicious code into explorer.exe. In any case, be it Windows 7 or not, this malicious\n\ncode decrypts its spying library from resources, saves it to disk with an apparently random but hardcoded\n\nname, for example, ~DFE8B437DD7C417A6D.TMP, in the user's temporary folder and loads this file as\n\nlibrary.\n\nThis next stage library copies itself into the System32 directory of the Windows folder after the hardcoded\n\nfile name -- either KBDLV2.DLL or AUTO.DLL, depending on the malware sample. Then the service is\n\ncreated for the service dll. Service names also can differ from version to version; we discovered the\n\nfollowing names -- DriverManage, WebService and WebClientManager. These functions assure malware\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this stage, the malware gathers information about the infected computer. This includes an output of the\n\n_systeminfo command saved in the file oledvbs.inc by following the hardcoded path: C:Program_\n\n_FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledvbs.inc. There is another function called - the malware creates a_\n\nstring containing computer and user names but this isn't used anywhere. By all appearances, this is a\n\nmistake by the malware author. Later on, we will come to a function where such a string could be\n\npertinent but the malware is not able to find this data in the place where it should be. These steps are\n\ntaken only if it's running on an infected system for the first time. At system startup, the malicious library\n\nperforms spying activities when it confirms that it is loaded by the generic svchost.exe process.\n\n## Spying modules\n\nThere are a lot of malicious programs involved in this campaign but, strangely, they each implement a\n\nsingle spying function. Besides the basic library (KBDLV2.DLL / AUTO.DLL) that is responsible for\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing functions:\n\nKeystroke logging\n\nDirectory listing collection\n\nHWP document theft\n\nRemote control download and execution\n\nRemote control access\n\n## Disabling firewall\n\nAt system startup, the basic library disables the system firewall and any AhnLab firewall (a South Korean\n\nsecurity product vendor) by zeroing out related values in registry:\n\nSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesSharedAccessParameters\n\nFirewallPolicyStandardProfile\n\nEnableFirewall = 0\n\nSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesSharedAccessParameters\n\nFirewallPolicyPublicProfile\n\nEnableFirewall = 0\n\nHKLMSOFTWAREAhnLabV3IS2007InternetSec\n\nFWRunMode = 0\n\nHKLMSOFTWAREAhnlabV3IS80is\n\nfwmode = 0\n\nIt also turns off the Windows Security Center service to prevent alerting the user about the disabled\n\nfirewall.\n\nIt is not accidental that the malware author has singled out AhnLab's security product. During our Winnti\n\nresearch, we learnt that one of the Korean victims was severely criticized by South Korean regulators for\n\nusing foreign security products. We do not know for sure how this criticism affected other South Korean\n\norganizations, but we do know that many South Korean organizations install AhnLab security products.\n\nAccordingly, these attackers don't even bother evading foreign vendors' products, because their targets are\n\nsolely South Korean.\n\nOnce the malware disables the AhnLab firewall, it checks whether the file taskmgr.exe is located in the\n\nhardcoded C:WINDOWS folder. If the file is present, it runs this executable. Next, the malware loops\n\nevery 30 minutes to report itself and wait for response from its operator.\n\n\n-----\n\nCommunication between bot and operator flows through the Bulgarian web-based free email server\n\n(mail.bg). The bot maintains hardcoded credentials for its e-mail account. After authenticating, the\n\nmalware sends e-mails to another specified e-mail address, and reads e-mails from the inbox. All these\n\nactivities are performed via the \"mail.bg\" web-interface with the use of the system Wininet API functions.\n\nFrom all the samples that we managed to obtain, we extracted the following email accounts used in this\n\ncampaign:\n\nbeautifl@mail.bg\n\nennemyman@mail.bg\n\nfasionman@mail.bg\n\nhappylove@mail.bg\n\nlovest000@mail.bg\n\nmonneyman@mail.bg\n\nsportsman@mail.bg\n\nveryhappy@mail.bg\n\nHere are the two \"master\" email addresses to which the bots send e-mails on behalf of the above\nmentioned accounts. They report on status and transmit infected system information via attachments:\n\niop110112@hotmail.com\n\nrsh1213@hotmail.com\n\n## Regular reporting\n\nTo report infection status, the malware reads from C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle\n\n_DBoledvbs.inc which contains the systeminfo command output. If the file exists, it is deleted after reading._\n\nThen, it reads user-related info from the file sqlxmlx.inc in the same folder (we can see strings referencing\n\nto \"UserID\" commentary in this part of the code). But this file was never created. As you recall, there is a\n\nfunction that should have collected this data and should have saved it into this sqlxmlx.inc file. However,\n\non the first launch, the collected user information is saved into \"xmlrwbin.inc\". This effectively means that\n\nthe malware writer mistakenly coded the bot to save user information into the wrong file. There is a\n\nchance for the mistaken code to still work -- user information could be copied into the send information\n\nheap. But not in this case - at the time of writing, the gathered user information variable which should\n\npoint to the xmlrwbin.inc filename has not yet been initialized, causing the file write to fail. We see that\n\n_sqlxmlx.inc is not created to store user information._\n\n\n-----\n\nkept in an ordinary and consistent format in this file - both the names of windows in which keys were\n\ntyped and the actual sequence of keyboard entry. This data is found in the file C:Program FilesCommon\n\n_FilesSystemOle DBmsolui80.inc created by the external key logger module._\n\nAll this data is merged in one file xmlrwbin.inc, which is then encrypted with RC4. The RC4 key is\n\ngenerated as an MD5 hash of a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer. To be able to decipher the data, the\n\nattacker should certainly know either the MD5 hash or the whole buffer content. This data is also sent, but\n\nRSA encrypted. The malware constructs a 1120 bit public key, uses it to encrypt the 117-bytes buffer. The\n\nmalware then concatenates all the data to be sent as a 128-bytes block. The resulting data is saved in\n\n_C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DB to a file named according to the following format:_\n\n\"<system time>_<account at Bulgarian email server>.txt\", for example, \"08191757_beautifl@mail.bg.txt\".\n\nThe file is then attached to an e-mail and sent to the master's e-mail account. Following transmission, it is\n\nimmediately deleted from the victim system.\n\n## Getting the master's data\n\nThe malware also retrieves instructions from the mail server. It checks for mails in its Bulgarian e-mail\n\naccount with a particular subject tag. We have identified several \"subject tags\" in the network\n\ncommunication: Down_0, Down_1, Happy_0, Happy_2 and ddd_3. When found and the e-mail\n\nmaintains an attachment, the malware downloads this attachment and saves it with filename\n\n\"msdaipp.cnt\" in C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DB. The attacker can send additional\n\nexecutables in this way. The executables are RC4 encrypted and then attached. The key for decryption is\n\nhardcoded in the malicious samples. It's interesting that the same \"rsh!@!#\" string is maintained across\n\nall known samples and is used to generate RC4 keys. As described earlier, the malware computes the MD5\n\nof this string and uses the hash as its RC4 key to decrypt the executable. Then, the plain executable is\n\ndropped onto disk as \"sqlsoldb.exe\" and run, and then moved to the C:Windows folder with the file name\n\n_\"taskmgr.exe\". The original e-mail and its attachment are then deleted from the Bulgarian e-mail inbox._\n\n## Key logger\n\nThe additional key logger module is not very complex -- it simply intercepts keystrokes and writes typed\n\nkeys into C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsolui80.inc, and also records the active window\n\n[name where the user pressed keys. We saw this same format in the Madi malware. There is also one key](http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/kaspersky_lab_and_seculert_announce_madi_a_newly_discovered_cyber_espionage_campaign_in_the_middle_east)\n\nlogger variant that logs keystrokes into C:WINDOWSsetup.log.\n\n## Directory listing collector\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing command on them:\n\ndir <drive letter>: /a /s /t /-c\n\nIn practice, this command is written to C:WINDOWSmsdatt.bat and executed with output redirected to\n\n_C:WINDOWSmsdatl3.inc. As a result, the latter maintains a listing of all files in all the folders on the_\n\ndrive. The malware later reads that data and appends it to content of the file C:Program FilesCommon\n\n_FilesSystemOle DBoledvbs.inc. At this point, \"oledvbs.inc \"already stores systeminfo output._\n\nIt's interesting that one sample of the directory listing collector was infected with the infamous \"Viking\"\n\nvirus of Chinese origin. Some of this virus' modifications were wandering in the wild for years and its\n\nauthors or operators would never expect to see it end up in a clandestine APT-related spying tool. For the\n\nattackers, this is certainly a big failure. Not only does the original spying program have marks of well\nknown malware that can be detected by anti-malware products; moreover the attackers are revealing their\n\nsecret activities to cyber-criminal gangs. However, by all appearances, the attackers noticed the unwanted\n\naddition to their malware and got rid of the infection. This was the only sample bearing the Viking virus.\n\nDue to expensive work of malware with variety of additional files, it's not out of place to show these\n\n\"relationships\" in a diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\n## HWP document stealer\n\nThis module intercepts HWP documents on an infected computer. The HWP file format is similar to\n\nMicrosoft Word documents, but supported by Hangul, a South Korean word processing application from\n\nthe Hancom Office bundle. Hancom Office is widely used in South Korea. This malware module works\n\nindependently of the others and maintains its own Bulgarian e-mail account. The account is hardcoded in\n\nthe module along with the master's e-mail to which it sends intercepted documents. It is interesting that\n\nthe module does not search for all the HWP files on infected computer, but reacts only to those that are\n\nopened by the user and steals them. This behavior is very unusual for a document-stealing component and\n\nwe do not see it in other malicious toolkits.\n\n\n-----\n\nassociation in the registry to open HWP documents. To do so, it alters following registry values:\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOTHwp.Document.7shellopencommand\n\nor\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOTHwp.Document.8shellopencommand\n\nBy default, there is the registry setting \"<Hangul full path>Hwp.exe\" \"%1\" associating Hangul application\n\n\"Hwp.exe\" with .HWP documents. But the malicious program replaces this string with the following: \"\n\n_<Hangul full path>HncReporter.exe \" \"%1\". So, when the user is opening any .HWP document, the_\n\nmalware program itself is executed to open the .HWP document. Following this registry edit, any opened\n\n.HWP document is read and sent as an e-mail attachment with the subject \"Hwp\" to the attackers. After\n\nsending, the malware executes the real Hangul word processing application \"Hwp.exe\" to open the .HWP\n\ndocument as the user intended. The means the victim most likely will not notice the theft of the .HWP file.\n\nThe module's sending routine depends on the following files in C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle\n\n_DB folder: xmlrwbin.inc, msdaipp.cnt, msdapml.cnt, msdaerr.cnt, msdmeng.cnt and oledjvs.inc._\n\n## Remote control module downloader\n\nAn extra program is dedicated exclusively to download attachments out of incoming e-mails with a\n\nparticular subject tag. This program is similar to the pivot module but with reduced functionality: it\n\nmaintains the hardcoded Bulgarian e-mail account, logs in, reads incoming e-mails and searches for the\n\nspecial subject tag \"Team\". When found, it loads the related attachment, drops it onto the hard drive as\n\n_C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBtaskmgr.exe and executes. This particular executable arrives_\n\nwithout any encryption.\n\n## Remote control module\n\nIt is also interesting that the malware author did not custom develop a backdoor program. Instead, the\n\nauthor modified TeamViewer client version 5.0.9104. The initial executable pushed by attackers in e-mails\n\nrelated to the remote control module consists of three more executables. Two of them are Team Viewer\n\ncomponents themselves, and another is some sort of backdoor loader. So, the dropper creates three files in\n\nthe C:WindowsSystem32 directory:\n\nnetsvcs.exe - the modified Team Viewer client;\n\nnetsvcs_ko.dll - resources library of Team Viewer client;\n\nvcmon.exe - installer/starter;\n\nand creates the service \"Remote Access Service\", adjusted to execute C:WindowsSystem32vcmon.exe at\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing registry values:\n\nHKLMSOFTWAREAhnLabV3 365 ClinicInternetSec\n\nUseFw = 0\n\nUseIps = 0\n\nThen, it modifies the Team Viewer registry settings. As we said, the Team Viewer components used in this\n\ncampaign are not the original ones. They are slightly modified. In total, we found two different variants of\n\nchanged versions. The malware author replaced all the entries of \"Teamviewer\" strings in Team Viewer\n\ncomponents. In the first case with the \"Goldstager\" string and with the string \"Coinstager\" in the second.\n\nTeamViewer client registry settings are then HKLMSoftwareGoldstagerVersion5 and\n\n_HKLMSoftwareCoinstagerVersion5 correspondingly. The launcher sets up several registry values that_\n\ncontrol how the remote access tool will work. Among them is SecurityPasswordAES. This parameter\n\nrepresents a hash of the password with which a remote user has to connect to Team Viewer client. This\n\nway, the attackers set a pre-shared authentication value. After that, the starter executes the very Team\n\nViewer client netsvcs.exe.\n\n## Who's Kim?\n\nIt's interesting that the drop box mail accounts iop110112@hotmail.com and rsh1213@hotmail.com are\n\nregistered with the following \"kim\" names: kimsukyang and \"Kim asdfa\".\n\nOf course, we can't be certain that these are the real names of the attackers. However, the selection isn't\n\nfrequently seen. Perhaps it also points to the suspected North Korean origin of attack. Taking into account\n\nthe profiles of the targeted organizations -- South Korean universities that conduct researches on\n\ninternational affairs, produce defense policies for government, national shipping company, supporting\n\ngroups for Korean unification -- one might easily suspect that the attackers might be from North Korea.\n\nThe targets almost perfectly fall into their sphere of interest. On the other hand, it is not that hard to enter\n\narbitrary registration information and misdirect investigators to an obvious North Korean origin. It does\n\nnot cost anything to concoct fake registration data and enter kimsukyang during a Hotmail registration.\n\nWe concede that this registration data does not provide concrete, indisputable information about the\n\nattackers.\n\nHowever, the attackers' IP-addresses do provide some additional clues. During our analysis, we observed\n\nten IP-addresses used by the Kimsuky operators. All of them lie in ranges of the Jilin Province Network\n\nand Liaoning Province Network, in China.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo other IP-addresses have been uncovered that would point to the attackers' activity and belong to other\n\nIP-ranges. Interestingly, the ISPs providing internet access in these provinces are also believed to\n\nmaintain lines into North Korea. Finally, this geo-location supports the likely theory that the attackers\n\nbehind Kimsuky are based in North Korea.\n\n## Appendix\n\nFiles used by malware:\n\n%windir%system32kbdlv2.dll\n\n%windir%system32auto.dll\n\n%windir%system32netsvcs.exe\n\n%windir%system32netsvcs_ko.dll\n\n%windir%system32vcmon.exe\n\n%windir%system32svcsmon.exe\n\n%windir%system32svcsmon_ko.dll\n\n%windir%system32wsmss.exe\n\n%temp%~DFE8B437DD7C417A6D.TMP\n\n%temp%~DFE8B43.TMP\n\n\n-----\n\nC:Windowstaskmgr.exe\n\nC:Windowssetup.log\n\nC:Windowswinlog.txt\n\nC:Windowsupdate.log\n\nC:Windowswmdns.log\n\nC:Windowsoledvbs.inc\n\nC:Windowsweoig.log\n\nC:Windowsdata.dat\n\nC:Windowssys.log\n\nC:WindowsPcMon.exe\n\nC:WindowsGoogle Update.exe\n\nC:WindowsReadMe.log\n\nC:Windowsmsdatt.bat\n\nC:Windowsmsdatl3.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdmeng.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBxmlrwbin.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdapml.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBsqlsoldb.exe\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledjvs.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledvbs.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsolui80.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdaipp.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdaerr.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBsqlxmlx.inc\n\n<Hangul full path>HncReporter.exe\n\nRelated MD5:\n\n3baaf1a873304d2d607dbedf47d3e2b4\n\n3195202066f026de3abfe2f966c9b304\n\n4839370628678f0afe3e6875af010839\n\n173c1528dc6364c44e887a6c9bd3e07c\n\n191d2da5da0e37a3bb3cbca830a405ff\n\n5eef25dc875cfcb441b993f7de8c9805\n\nb20c5db37bda0db8eb1af8fc6e51e703\n\nface9e96058d8fe9750d26dd1dd35876\n\n\n-----\n\nd0af6b8bdc4766d1393722d2e67a657b\n\n45448a53ec3db51818f57396be41f34f\n\n80cba157c1cd8ea205007ce7b64e0c2a\n\nf68fa3d8886ef77e623e5d94e7db7e6c\n\n4a1ac739cd2ca21ad656eaade01a3182\n\n4ea3958f941de606a1ffc527eec6963f\n\n637e0c6d18b4238ca3f85bcaec191291\n\nb3caca978b75badffd965a88e08246b0\n\ndbedadc1663abff34ea4bdc3a4e03f70\n\n3ae894917b1d8e4833688571a0573de4\n\n8a85bd84c4d779bf62ff257d1d5ab88b\n\nd94f7a8e6b5d7fc239690a7e65ec1778\n\nf1389f2151dc35f05901aba4e5e473c7\n\n96280f3f9fd8bdbe60a23fa621b85ab6\n\nf25c6f40340fcde742018012ea9451e0\n\n122c523a383034a5baef2362cad53d57\n\n2173bbaea113e0c01722ff8bc2950b28\n\n2a0b18fa0887bb014a344dc336ccdc8c\n\nffad0446f46d985660ce1337c9d5eaa2\n\n81b484d3c5c347dc94e611bae3a636a3\n\nab73b1395938c48d62b7eeb5c9f3409d\n\n69930320259ea525844d910a58285e15\n\nNames of services created by malware:\n\nDriverManage\n\nWebService\n\nWebClientManager\n\nRemote Access Service\n\nWe detect these threats as Trojan.Win32.Kimsuky except modified Team Viewer client components\n\nwhich are detected as Trojan.Win32.Patched.ps.\n\n\n-----",
