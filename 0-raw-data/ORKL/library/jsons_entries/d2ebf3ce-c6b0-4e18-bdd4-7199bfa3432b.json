A\nrelated indictment unsealed in October 2019 charged five members of QQAAZZ. One\nadditional conspirator, a Russian national, was arrested by criminal complaint in late March\n2020 while visiting the United States, bringing the total number of charged defendants to 20.\nActing Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the U.S. Department of Justice’s\nCriminal Division and U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady for the Western District of Pennsylvania,\nmade the announcement today.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe QQAAZZ members, acting in concert with cybercriminals across the world, are accused\nof conspiring to launder money stolen from victims of computer fraud in the United States\nand elsewhere. More than 40 house searches were conducted in Latvia, Bulgaria, the\nUnited Kingdom, Spain and Italy, with criminal prosecutions initiated in the United States,\nPortugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. The largest number of searches and arrests were\ncarried out in Latvia by the Latvian State Police (Latvijas Valsts Policija), and an extensive\nbitcoin mining operation associated with the group was seized in Bulgaria. Today’s\nannouncement is in coordination with announcements by Europol and several law\nenforcement agencies across Europe who collaborated with the United States to develop\nparallel investigations and prosecutions of the QQAAZZ members in their own countries.\n\n“Today’s charges, brought in coordination with our European law enforcement partners,\nreflect the Criminal Division’s steadfast efforts to work with authorities worldwide toprotect\nthe public from fraudsters and the money launderers who help them hide their stolen money,”\nsaid Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt. “Our message to money laundering\norganizations like QQAAZZ is simple: internationalborders will not stop the dedicated efforts\nof law enforcement across the globe to bring you to justice. In addition to the Criminal\nDivision team, I would like to recognize the outstanding efforts of the team led by U.S.\nAttorney Scott Brady, FBI Pittsburgh, and our European partners.”\n\n“Cybercrime victimizes individuals and companies all over the world, so our work to identify\nand disrupt cybercriminals requires global collaboration,” said U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania. “For the past several years, law enforcement from\n16 countries has been conducting coordinated investigations of this criminal gang, and now\nparallel prosecutions will commence in the United States, Portugal, United Kingdom and\nSpain. As this case demonstrates, we will be relentless in our pursuit of cybercriminals\nregardless of where they reside.”\n\n“This was an extensive investigation that had implications around the world,” said FBI\nPittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Michael Christman. “Partnerships are essential, as no\none agency can combat cybercrime alone. This case highlights the FBI’s strategy to target\nand dismantle the most significant cybercriminal enterprises through a global task force\napproach. I can assure everyone that the FBI and our partners will continue to work tirelessly\nto combat these cyber threats.”\n\n“Cybercriminals are constantly exploring new possibilities to abuse technology and financial\nframeworks to victimize millions of users in a moment from anywhere in the world,” said\nFernando Ruiz, Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre. “Today’s operation shows\nhow through a proper law enforcement international coordination we can turn the table on\nthese criminals and bring them to justice.”\n\nThe indictment alleges that the QQAAZZ network laundered, or attempted to launder, tens of\nmillions of dollars’ worth of stolen funds from victims of cybercrimes since 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\nComprised of several layers of members from Latvia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, and\nBelgium, among other countries, the QQAAZZ network opened and maintained hundreds of\ncorporate and personal bank accounts at financial institutions throughout the world to receive\nmoney from cybercriminals who stole it from bank accounts of victims. The funds were then\ntransferred to other QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts and sometimes converted to\ncryptocurrency using “tumbling” services designed to hide the original source of the funds.\nAfter taking a fee of up to 40 to 50 percent, QQAAZZ returned the balance of the stolen\nfunds to their cybercriminal clientele.\n\nThe QQAAZZ members secured these bank accounts by using both legitimate and\nfraudulent Polish and Bulgarian identification documents to create and register dozens of\nshell companies which conducted no legitimate business activity. Using these registration\ndocuments, the QQAAZZ members then opened corporate bank accounts in the names of\nthe shell companies at numerous financial institutions around the world, thereby generating\nhundreds of QQAAZZ-controlled bank accounts available to receive stolen funds from cyber\nthieves.\n\nQQAAZZ advertised its services as a “global, complicit bank drops service” on Russianspeaking online cybercriminal forums where cybercriminals gather to offer or seek\nspecialized skills or services needed to engage in a variety of cybercriminal activities. The\ncriminal gangs behind some of the world’s most harmful malware families (e.g.: Dridex,\nTrickbot, GozNym, etc.) are among those cybercriminal groups that benefited from the\nservices provided by QQAAZZ.\n\nThe 14 defendants named in the indictment unsealed today are:\n\n1. Nika Nazarovi, aka “Nika Utiashvili,” aka “Mihail Atansov,” aka “Stefan Trifonov\n\nZhelyazkov,” 32, of Georgia;\n2.
