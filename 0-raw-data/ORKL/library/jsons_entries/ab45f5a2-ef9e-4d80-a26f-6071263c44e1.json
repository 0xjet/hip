In a [threat brief from 2018, we noted Hancitor was relatively](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-brief-hancitor-actors/)\nunsophisticated, but it would remain a threat for years to come. Approximately three years later,\n[Hancitor remains a threat and has evolved to use tools like Cobalt Strike. In recent months, this actor](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cobalt_strike)\nbegan using a network ping tool to help enumerate the Active Directory (AD) environment of infected\nhosts. This blog illustrates how the threat actor behind Hancitor uses the network ping tool, so security\nprofessionals can better identify and block its use.\n\nAs early as October 2020, Hancitor began utilizing Cobalt Strike and some of these infections utilized\na network ping tool to enumerate the infected host’s internal network. Normal ping activity is low to\nnonexistent within a Local Area Network (LAN), but this ping tool generates approximately 1.5 GB of\n\n\n-----\n\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic as it pings more than 17 million IP addresses of\ninternal, non-routable IPv4 address space.\n\nTo understand how this ping tool is used, we must first understand the chain of events for current\nHancitor activity. This blog reviews examples of recent Hancitor infections within AD environments.\nThis blog also contains relatively new indicators noted from this threat actor as of February 2021, and\nit provides five examples of the associated network ping tool seen in December 2020 and January\n2021.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from this threat with a](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) Threat\nPrevention security subscription.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise\ndescribed in this report, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members use this\nintelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt malicious\ncyber actors.\n\n## Chain of Events for Recent Hancitor Infections\n\n[Since Nov. 5, 2020, the actor pushing Hancitor has displayed consistent patterns of infection activity.](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1324815102630121474/)\nSee Figure 1 for a flow chart showing the chain of events.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.

By Nov. 5, 2020, this](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/1318571872343052288)\ncampaign settled into the infection chain of events shown above\n\n\n-----\n\n## First Stage: Distributing Malicious Word Documents\n\nHancitor has historically sent emails spoofing different types of organizations that send notices, faxes\n[or invoices. Emails spoofing DocSign have been reported as early as October 2017, but the group](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Hancitor+malspam+uses+DDE+attack/22936/)\n[behind Hancitor began more frequent use of DocuSign templates starting in October 2019. Currently,](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Hancitor+infection+with+Pony+Evil+Pony+Ursnif+and+Cobalt+Strike/25532/)\nmost waves of emails pushing Hancitor have used a DocuSign theme, and the average wave of\n[Hancitor malspam looks like this one reported on Jan. 12, 2021.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Hancitor+activity+resumes+after+a+hoilday+break/26980/)\n\nDocuSign-spoofed emails are not new, nor are they limited to Hancitor. DocuSign is well aware of this\n[activity. The company provides guidance on this issue and a channel to report malicious messages](https://www.docusign.com/blog/docusign-update-recent-phishing-attack)\nspoofing their brand.\n\nThese DocuSign-themed messages have links to malicious Google Drive pages established through\nfraudulent or possibly compromised Google accounts. Cloud-based collaborative services such as\n[Microsoft’s OneDrive and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-onedrive-has-60-percent-jump-in-hosting-of-malicious-files/) [Google Drive are frequently abused by threat actors to distribute malware.](https://threatpost.com/scammers-google-drive-malicious-links/160832/)\n\nGoogle Drive links from emails pushing Hancitor start with\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX- and end with /pub. This URL pattern has also been\nnoted pushing other families of malware.\n\nTo get a better idea of these URLs, examples from a wave of Hancitor emails on February 8th, 2021,\nare shown below in Table 1. Google was notified of these links, and they have been taken offline.\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTetOTfCnHAXiwwNOrfJjR8lPTgu3dVzKEVWld1HNkRCpwTqpqD4PnGuTjRjI_kxIxR8_azAcQS1US/pub\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQeUQCdriz9ZT5dR7Byyfi4rY6FsHucjRbzvYLtWNmDGKfcqKyp9l4-EAFFYXHxbAWrAR-CI25e8cZ/pub\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX1vSPBGA3_D8dfupT021GG4VGB9a06Nm3viKAia4F2XWrjT7mhPyB0L1rKruj7DsB86Z38EaxidoXIr8/pub\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vShVIbeSUL9R_h5qZXdp_2SBmuFVKFJcwpC4_0T2r436SQr7IPyy2cB6kHqiLC6TNsQQQiwUS_kmdY/pub\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX1vQc8XwAxOetaoxILZsGLJgCCF2I39s_vgDHTpTDy4v9Nmh8nlZNhbCjqa8u01xY2ckettVxUsrjlSLf/pub\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX1vTC5fAO7oEHK0vOKF93EqsLSkV0kiR4ppTG1tqAPXb4sXjYzYhVBOwlG-9F6kxbhNeC8C9lRs5YsQD/pub\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTxPV1p44-UfCkOfGWWMP3RZk5LCvmqlOW78f1oiU4TOLOibyGjHUKkWNDLjCnMae4-0vBNwMZ8oKv/pub\n\n_Table 1. Seven examples of malicious Google Drive links from DocuSign-themed emails pushing Hancitor on Feb. 8, 2021._\n\nA recent example from an email is shown below in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Example of a fake DocuSign email pushing Hancitor from Feb. 2, 2021.\nOf note, any Google Drive URL that starts with https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX- and\nends with /pub is not inherently malicious. However, they are definitely suspicious when found in\nunsolicited emails.\n\nThese Google Drive URLs display a web page with a link to download a Word document. Figure 3\nshows an example of these malicious pages using Google Drive.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Google Drive link from fake DocuSign email on Feb. 2, 2021, shown in a web browser.\nThese pages link to malicious URLs using Google with various parameters, including the actual\ndestination URL. In Figure 3 above, a link from a Google Drive page, obtained from a fake DocuSign\nemail on Feb. 2, 2021, starts innocently enough with https://www.google.com/. However, after clicking\nthe link, the web browser loads hxxp://ajlbulicidate[.]pt/squriming.php which is actually a malicious\nURL. Figure 4 shows the page from ajlbulicidate[.]pt as it is initially loaded.\n\nFigure 4. Web browser immediately after clicking link from the Google Drive page.\nThe page from ajlbulicidate[.]pt contained a script with base64 text to create a malicious Word\ndocument. This script causes a browser to offer the malicious Word document for download, then it\nredirects to a DocuSign page as shown in Figures 5 and 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Base64 text representing malicious Word document in script from web page hosted at\najlbulicidate[.]pt.\n\nFigure 6. Script offers to save malicious Word document, then redirects to a DocuSign URL.\nThe page at hxxp://ajlbulicidate[.]pt/squriming.php briefly appears before offering the Word document\nfor download and redirecting to a DocuSign URL. Potential victims might only notice the DocuSign\npage and Word document. See Figure 7 for an example. This technique could lead potential victims to\nbelieve the Word document is a legitimate file sent by DocuSign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Web browser a few seconds after clicking link in malicious Google Drive page from Figure 3.\nWord documents originating from these DocuSign-themed messages use the template shown below in\nFigure 8.\n\nFigure 8. Malicious Word document with macro for Hancitor based on DocuSign-themed malspam.\n\n\n-----\n\nDocuSign is not the only theme and template used to push Hancitor. For example, on Feb. 9, 2021,\n[malspam using a different email and document template pushed Hancitor malware. Except for the](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2021/02/09/index2.html)\ndifferent templates, the infection process remained the same.\n\n[Appendix A lists 127 samples of SHA256 hashes for Word documents with macros for Hancitor from](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs-Hancitor/blob/main/APPENDIX-A-2020-11-05-thru-2021-02-25-Hancitor-Word-docs.txt)\nNov. 5, 2020, through Feb. 25, 2021.\n\n## Second Stage: Hancitor Infects Victim\n\nWhen macros are enabled for these malicious Word documents, the macro code drops and runs a\nmalicious DLL file for Hancitor. The DLL file is contained within the macro code. In January and\nFebruary 2021, these Hancitor DLLs were saved to one of two locations, as shown in Table 2.\n\nC:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\W0rd.dll\n\nC:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Static.dll\n\nC:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\W0rd.dll\n\n_Table 2. Location of Hancitor DLL files._\n\nFigure 9 shows one of the Hancitor DLL files from an infected host on Feb. 2, 2021.\n\nFigure 9. Hancitor DLL from an infected Windows host on Feb. 2, 2021.\nThese Hancitor DLL files are run with rundll32.exe. An example from Feb. 2, 2021, revealed by\n[Process Hacker, is shown below in Figure 10.](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Process for Hancitor DLL shown in Process Hacker.\nNetwork traffic caused by Hancitor starts with an IP address check by the infected Windows host. This\nIP address check goes to a legitimate service at api.ipify.org. The IP check is immediately followed by\nC2 traffic, as shown in a Wireshark column display below in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Wireshark column display showing IP address check and Hancitor C2 URLs.\nFrom November 2020 through February 2021, Hancitor C2 traffic consisted of HTTP POST requests\nending with /8/forum.php. Posted data includes the public IP address of the infected Windows host, the\nhost name and user account name. Posted data also includes the version of Windows and domain\ninformation if the infected host is part of an AD environment. Finally, posted data also contains a\nGlobally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the infected host and a build number for the Hancitor malware\nsample. See Figure 12 below for an example of recent Hancitor C2 traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. TCP stream from an example of Hancitor C2 traffic.\n[Appendix B lists 63 SHA256 hashes for samples of Hancitor DLL files from Nov. 5, 2020, through Feb.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs-Hancitor/blob/main/APPENDIX-B-2020-11-05-thru-2021-02-25-Hancitor-DLL-files.txt)\n25, 2021.\n\n## Third Stage: Hancitor Retrieves Follow-Up Malware\n\nAfter Hancitor establishes C2 traffic, it retrieves follow-up malware. Each day, follow-up malware items\nfor Hancitor are hosted on the same domain. For example, on Feb. 2, 2021, follow-up malware for\nHancitor was hosted at bobcvatofredding[.]com. Table 3 shows a few recent examples of URLs for\nfollow-up malware by Hancitor.\n\n**Date** **URL** **Follow-Up Malware**\n\n2021-01-19 hxxp://alumaicelodges[.]com/1901.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-01-19 hxxp://alumaicelodges[.]com/1901s.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-01-19 hxxp://alumaicelodges[.]com/fls.exe Ficker Stealer\n\n2021-01-20 hxxp://ferguslawn[.]com/2001.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-01-20 hxxp://ferguslawn[.]com/2001s.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-01-20 hxxp://ferguslawn[.]com/6fokjewkj.exe Ficker Stealer\n\n2021-01-27 hxxp://onlybamboofabrics[.]com/2701.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-01-27 hxxp://onlybamboofabrics[.]com/27012.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-01-27 hxxp://onlybamboofabrics[.]com/6gdwwv.exe Ficker Stealer\n\n2021-02-02 hxxp://bobcatofredding[.]com/0102.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-02-02 hxxp://bobcatofredding[.]com/0102s.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-02-02 hxxp://bobcatofredding[.]com/6lavfdk.exe Ficker Stealer\n\n\n-----\n\n2021-02-10 hxxp://backupez[.]com/0902.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-02-10 hxxp://backupez[.]com/0902s.bin Cobalt Strike\n\n2021-02-10 hxxp://backupez[.]com/6yudfgh.exe Ficker Stealer\n\n2021-02-10 hxxp://backupez[.]com/47.exe Send-Safe spambot malware\n\n_Table 3. Examples of URLs for follow-up malware seen from recent Hancitor infections._\n\nHancitor will only send Cobalt Strike when it infects a host in an AD environment. It will not send\nCobalt Strike if the computer is a standalone host like a home computer. Hancitor generally sends\nFicker Stealer for any host it infects.\n\nPost-infection traffic is the easiest way to identify follow-up malware from a Hancitor infection. Ficker\nStealer causes different traffic than Cobalt Strike. Figure 13 shows traffic from an infection on Feb. 2,\n2021, and it highlights items related to Ficker Stealer.\n\nFigure 13. Traffic from a Hancitor infection, highlighting items related to Ficker Stealer.\n[Appendix D contains information on the Ficker Stealer malware samples associated with Hancitor from](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs-Hancitor/blob/main/APPENDIX-D-Samples-of-Ficker-Stealer-Associated-With-Hancitor.txt)\nOctober 2020-March 2021.\n\nFigure 14 below shows the same traffic, but it highlights items related to Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Same traffic from a Hancitor infection, highlighting items related to Cobalt Strike.\nFicker Stealer and Cobalt Strike do not leave any artifacts saved to disk on an infected host. Ficker\nStealer is a \"smash and grab\" style of malware designed to exfiltrate data, and it does not remain on\nan infected host. Cobalt Strike is resident in system memory, and it did not survive a reboot in our test\nenvironment.\n\n## Final Stage: Cobalt Strike Sends Malware\n\nCobalt Strike is used by the threat actor behind Hancitor to send follow-up malware. A Hancitor\ninfection on Feb. 2, 2021, revealed NetSupport Manager RAT was sent after Cobalt Strike activity\nstarted.\n\nAnother file that appeared on Hancitor-infected hosts after Cobalt Strike started was a Windows EXE\nfile for a network ping tool.\n\nThis EXE file started appearing as early as Dec. 15, 2020, and we noted various file hashes through at\nleast Jan. 25, 2021. The network ping tool was always saved to the same directory as the Hancitor\nWord document.\n\nFigure 15 shows an example of the tool seen on Jan. 13, 2021, after a Hancitor Word document was\nsaved to the infected user’s Documents folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. An example of the network ping tool from a Hancitor infection with Cobalt Strike on Jan. 13,\n2021.\nAs seen in Figure 15, the EXE file was named xx.exe. A week later on Jan. 20, a new sample of the\nsame tool was named netpingall.exe, as shown in Figure 16.\n\nFigure 16. An example of the network ping tool from a Hancitor with Cobalt Strike infection on Jan. 20,\n2021.\nTimestamps from the Jan. 20, 2021, infection show the following:\n\n0120_203089882.doc – Word doc with macros for Hancitor – 16:27 UTC\nnetpingall.exe – Network ping tool seen after Cobalt Strike - 17:19 UTC\nresult.txt – Results of the network ping tool scan – 18:18 UTC\n\nAn EXE for the network ping tool appeared approximately 52 minutes after the Word document for\nHancitor was saved to disk. Approximately 59 minutes after the network ping tool appeared, the results\nof the scan were saved to a text file named result.txt.\n\nThis ping tool is designed to find any other active hosts within an AD environment. The tool generates\napproximately 1.5 GB of ICMP ping traffic over the network as it pings more than 17 million IP\naddresses of internal, non-routable IPv4 address space.\n\nNormally, ping traffic to internal, non-routable IPv4 addresses is almost nonexistent in an AD\nenvironment. Ping traffic within internal IP address space should be limited to the LAN. For example, a\nLAN environment for 172.16.1.0/24 consists of 254 internal IP addresses that a host might ping within\n\n\n-----\n\nthis network. We would not normally see ping traffic to other non-routable IPv4 space outside of those\n254 IP addresses.\n\nWe tested samples of this ping tool in various sizes of LAN environments, and it consistently\ngenerates 1.5 GB of ICMP ping traffic to more than 17 million non-routable IPv4 addresses.\n\nThis is exceedingly noisy traffic. Furthermore, Hancitor has demonstrated a noticeable lack of stealth\nin deploying and using this ping tool. Such an unusual EXE file is easy to notice, especially when the\nresults of its scan are saved as a text file in the same directory.\n\nFor Hancitor infections involving this ping tool, the associated files were never deleted after saving the\nresults to result.txt, so any forensic investigation would quickly find this tool. The 1.5 GB of ICMP traffic\nshould be very noticeable.\n\nThe ping tool generates ICMP ping traffic, first hitting all IP addresses in the 192.168.0.0/16 block.\nthen it does the 172.16.0.0/12 block, and it finishes with the 10.0.0.0/8 block.\n\nFigure 17. An example of the start of ICMP traffic from one of the network ping tool samples.\nSince Jan. 25, 2021, we have not discovered any new ping tool samples from Hancitor infections with\nCobalt Strike. Why can we no longer find it? Perhaps the threat actor behind Hancitor realized how\nsuspicious this activity is and stopped using it.\n\n[Appendix C lists information for five samples of the network ping tool discovered from Hancitor](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs-Hancitor/blob/main/APPENDIX-C-2020-12-15-thru-2021-01-25-network-ping-tool-samples.txt)\ninfections with Cobalt Strike that appeared in December 2020 and January 2021.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPost-infection activity from Hancitor malware has settled into noticeable patterns. These patterns\ninclude the use of Cobalt Strike for a Hancitor infection within an AD environment. In some cases,\nfollow-up malware sent through Cobalt Strike may include a network ping tool that generates an\nabnormally large amount of ICMP traffic as it pings over 17 million internal IPv4 addresses.\n\nOrganizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration and up-to-date Windows hosts\nhave a much lower risk of infection from Hancitor and its post-infection activity.
