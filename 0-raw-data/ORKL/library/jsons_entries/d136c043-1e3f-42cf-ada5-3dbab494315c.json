In addition to Linux, Windows includes a finger.exe command that performs the\nsame functionality.\n\nTo execute the Finger command, a user would enter finger [user]@[remote_host]. For\nexample, finger bleeping@www.bleepingcomputer.com.\n\n[In September, we reported that security researchers discovered a way to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-finger-command-abused-by-phishing-to-download-malware/) use Finger as a\nLoLBin to download malware from a remote computer or exfiltrate data. LolBins are\nlegitimate programs that can help attackers bypass security controls to fetch malware without\ntriggering a security alert on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Finger used in an active malware campaign\n\nThis week, security researcher Kirk Sayre found a phishing campaign utilizing the Finger\ncommand to download the MineBridge backdoor malware.\n\n[https://t.co/U0GtPdILCk ITW maldoc using finger.exe to download 2nd stage.

These phishing emails contain malicious\nWord documents disguised as job applicant resumes that install the MineBridge malware.\n\n**MineBridge phishing email**\n\nSource: FireEye\nLike the previous MineBridge campaigns seen by FireEye, the one discovered by Sayre also\npretends to be a resume from a job applicant, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious MineBridge word document**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nWhen a victim clicks on the 'Enabled Editing' or 'Enable Content' buttons, a password\nprotected macro will be executed to download the MineBridge malware and run it.\n\nBleepingComputer was able to bypass the password-protection on the Word macro, which is\nshown below in its obfuscated form.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Obfuscated malicious Word Macro**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe deobfuscated command executed by the macro, shown below, uses the finger command\nto download a Base64 encoded certificate from a remote server and saves it as\n%AppData%\\vUCooUr.\n\n**Deobfuscated command executed by the macro**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nThe certificate retrieved via the finger command is a base64 encoded malware downloader\nmalware executable. This certificate is decoded using the certutil.exe command, saved as\n%AppData%\\vUCooUr.exe, and then executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Base64 encoded malware disguised as a certificate**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nOnce executed, the downloader will download a TeamViewer executable and use DLL\nhijacking to sideload a malicious DLL, the MineBridge malware.\n\nInteresting, downloads a teamviewer executable and a malicious dll, sideloaded by\nteamviewer, containing MINEBRIDGE malware - The behaviour is the same, apart\nfrom the finger.exe, even the TLD c2 *.top of fireeye report [https://t.co/qKFFlUnA0phttps://t.co/4hMJPlAGJg](https://t.co/qKFFlUnA0p) [pic.twitter.com/QdIuwbe2Gq](https://t.co/QdIuwbe2Gq)\n\n[— Giuseppe `N3mes1s` (@gN3mes1s) January 15, 2021](https://twitter.com/gN3mes1s/status/1349995643314565120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nOnce MineBridge is loaded, the remote threat actors will gain full access to the computer and\nallow them to listen in via the infected device's microphone, and perform other malicious\nactivities.\n\n\n-----\n\nCollectively, the two C2 methods support commands for downloading and executing\npayloads, downloading arbitrary files, self-deletion and updating, process listing, shutting\ndown and rebooting the system, executing arbitrary shell commands, process elevation,\nturning on/off TeamViewer's microphone, and gathering system UAC information,\" FireEye\nexplains in their report.\n\nAs Finger is rarely used today, it is suggested that administrators block the Finger command\non their network, whether through AppLocker or other methods.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure included](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/historic-hotel-stay-complementary-emotet-exposure-included/)\n\n[FluBot Android malware targets Finland in new SMS campaigns](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flubot-android-malware-targets-finland-in-new-sms-campaigns/)\n\n[German automakers targeted in year-long malware campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-automakers-targeted-in-year-long-malware-campaign/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
