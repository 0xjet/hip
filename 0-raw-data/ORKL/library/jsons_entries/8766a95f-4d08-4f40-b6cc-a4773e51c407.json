Thursday,_\nSeptember 27, 2018 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the security industry characterizes the e-crime threat landscape, there is a temptation\nto focus on the everyday scams and high-volume aspect of the criminal threat landscape.\nThese criminals are not particular about targets if there are financial rewards at the end.\nObvious examples of these types of scams are the widely distributed malware aimed at\nstealing bank account credentials and the ransomware disseminated through large-scale\nspam phishing campaigns.\n\nThese criminals can earn a decent income over time netting smaller \"financial fish\" through\nopportunistic scams. However, some cybercriminals are setting their aims higher and\nfocusing on much larger fish. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have\nobserved a growing threat from sophisticated threat actors who pursue high-value targets\nsuch as banks and financial services companies and have the capability to exploit and\nmonetize access to payment and other financial systems. CTU™ researchers call one of\nthese threat groups GOLD KINGSWOOD.\n\n## GOLD KINGSWOOD: An advanced persistent cybercrime group\n\nGOLD KINGSWOOD (also known as the Cobalt Gang) is a capable, sophisticated, and\nfinancially motivated criminal threat group that has successfully compromised financial\norganizations since at least 2016. The group uses targeted network intrusion tactics to\nlocate, access, and abuse systems that can be monetized. As of March 2018, the threat\n[actors had reportedly stolen approximately $1.2 billion USD through their global operations.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/malware-mastermind-who-rigged-atms-to-spew-cash-caught-in-spain)\nUnlike most criminally motivated e-crime actors observed by CTU researchers, GOLD\nKINGSWOOD's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are similar to attributes of\ntraditional government-sponsored or espionage-driven threat actors. For example, in\noperations against the First Commercial Bank (FCB) of Taiwan, GOLD KINGSWOOD used\ncustom malware that leveraged CSCWCNG.dll, which is specific to the ATM hardware used\nat FCB. After receiving confirmation of the ATM locations where money mules were waiting,\nthe threat actors executed commands to dispense money from the machines. This incident\ndemonstrated GOLD KINGSWOOD's vast technical and human resources.\n\n## GOLD KINGSWOOD serves up a SpicyOmelette\n\nIn 2018, CTU researchers observed several GOLD KINGSWOOD campaigns involving\nSpicyOmelette, a tool used by the group during initial exploitation of an organization. This\nsophisticated JavaScript remote access tool is generally delivered via phishing, and it uses\nmultiple defense evasion techniques to hinder prevention and detection activities. GOLD\nKINGSWOOD delivered SpicyOmelette through a phishing email containing a shortened link\nthat appeared to be a PDF document attachment. When clicked, the link used the Google\nAppEngine to redirect the system to a GOLD KINGSWOOD-controlled Amazon Web\nServices (AWS) URL that installed a signed JavaScript file, which was SpicyOmelette.\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU analysis of one of GOLD KINGSWOOD s campaign using SpicyOmelette (DOC2018.js)\nexposed additional sophisticated methods to compromise targets. A valid digital certificate\nwas used to sign the malicious script. Windows Scripting Host supports the inclusion of\ndigital signatures, and Figure 2 shows how the signature was appended to the script.\nDepending on the security profile of the victim's system, a pop-up notification may have\nwarned about running external content. However, the system would have also indicated that\nthe script was signed by a valid and trusted certificate authority (CA). SpicyOmelette also\npassed parameters to a valid Microsoft utility, which allowed the threat actors to execute\narbitrary JavaScript code on a compromised system and bypass many applicationwhitelisting defenses.\n\n_Figure 1. SpicyOmelette infection chain. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nOnce installed, SpicyOmelette provides an ideal foothold onto a targeted system for GOLD\nKINGSWOOD. It enables the threat actors to perform various actions:\n\nprofile the infected system for information (e.g., running software, system name, IP\naddress)\ninstall additional malware onto the system\ncheck for the presence of 29 different antivirus tools\n\n\n-----\n\nThe access provided by SpicyOmelette and other post-compromise tools regularly used by\nGOLD KINGSWOOD helps the threat actors escalate privileges on a system by stealing\naccount credentials, survey and evaluate the compromised environment, identify desirable\nsystems (e.g., payment systems, payment gateways, ATM systems), and deploy malware\nspecifically designed to target those systems.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe ‘advanced' nature of GOLD KINGSWOOD intrusions stems from the care and focus that\nthe threat actors exhibit, specifically finding and accessing systems of interest. Arrests of\nsuspected GOLD KINGSWOOD operators in March 2018 did not deter the threat group's\ncampaigns, likely due to its vast network of resources. CTU researchers expect GOLD\nKINGSWOOD's operations and toolset to continue to evolve, and financial organizations of\nall sizes and geographies could be exposed to threats from this group. The threat group's\ndetailed understanding of financial systems and history of successful campaigns make it a\nformidable threat.\n\n\n-----",
