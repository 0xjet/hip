ICEDID has always been a prevalent family, but has achieved even more\n[growth since EMOTET’s temporary disruption in early 2021. ICEDID has been linked to the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/emotet-botnet-disrupted-international-cyber-operation)\n[distribution of other distinct malware families including DarkVNC and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.darkvnc) [COBALT STRIKE.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-all-paths-lead-to-cobalt-strike-icedid-emotet-and-qbot)\nRegular industry reporting, including research publications like this one, help mitigate this\nthreat.\n\nElastic Security Labs analyzed a recent ICEDID variant consisting of a loader and bot\npayload. By providing this research to the community end-to-end, we hope to raise\nawareness of the ICEDID execution chain, highlight its capabilities, and deliver insights\nabout how it is designed.\n\n### Execution Chain\n\nICEDID employs multiple stages before establishing persistence via a scheduled task and\nmay retrieve components from C2 dynamically. The following diagram illustrates major\nphases of the ICEDID execution chain.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Research Paper Overview\n\nElastic Security Labs described the full execution chain of a recent ICEDID sample in a\n[detailed research paper hosted at Elastic Security Labs. In addition, we provide a](https://www.elastic.co/pdf/elastic-security-labs-thawing-the-permafrost-of-icedid.pdf)\ncomprehensive analysis of this malware sample and capabilities, including:\n\nVirtualization detection and anti-analysis\nC2 polling operations\nShellcode execution methods\nCredential access mechanisms\nWebsocket connections\nInstalling a web browser proxy to capture all user traffic\nReverse shell and VNC server installation\nCertificate pinning\nData validation\nICEDID observable TTPs\nLinks to useful resources from Elastic\n\n### Detections and preventions\n\n**Detection logic**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Preventions (source: https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/)**\n\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Command Shell Activity\nMemory Threat Detection Alert: Shellcode Injection\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Unusual DLL Extension Loaded by Rundll32 or\nRegsvr32\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Suspicious Windows Script Interpreter Child\nProcess\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: RunDLL32 with Unusual Arguments\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Windows Script Execution from Archive File\n\n**YARA**\n\nElastic Security has created multiple YARA rules related to the different stages/components\nwithin ICEDID infection, these can be found in the signature linked below:\n\n[Windows.Trojan.ICEDID](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_IcedID.yar)\n\nElastic Security Labs is a team of dedicated researchers and security engineers focused on\ndisrupting adversaries though the publication of detailed detection logic, protections, and\napplied threat research.\n\nFollow us on @elasticseclabs or visit our research portal for more resources and research.\n\n## Related content\n\nSee all top stories\n\n\n-----\n\n### Elastic users protected from SUDDENICON’s supply chain attack\n\nElastic Security Labs is releasing a triage analysis to assist 3CX customers in the initial\ndetection of SUDDENICON, a potential supply-chain compromise affecting 3CX VOIP\nsoftphone users.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Click, Click… Boom! Automating Protections Testing with Detonate\n\nTo automate this process and test our protections at scale, we built Detonate, a system that\nis used by security research engineers to measure the efficacy of our Elastic Security\nsolution in an automated fashion.\n\n### REF2924: how to maintain persistence as an (advanced?) threat\n\nElastic Security Labs describes new persistence techniques used by the group behind\nSIESTAGRAPH, NAPLISTENER, and SOMNIRECORD.\n\n\n-----",
