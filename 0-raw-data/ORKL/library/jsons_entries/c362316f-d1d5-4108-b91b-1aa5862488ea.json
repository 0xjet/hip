Recent examination of this group’s activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37’s toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea’s penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\n We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123.\n\n\n-----\n\n**4** SPECIAL REPORT APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **5**\n\nWe judge that APT37’s primary mission is\ncovert intelligence gathering in support of North\n\n### Targeting\n Korea’s strategic military, political and economic\n\ninterests. This is based on consistent targeting\n\n### and Mission of South Korean public and private entities and\n\nsocial engineering.

In 2017, APT37\nexpanded its targeting beyond the Korean\npeninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the\nMiddle East, and to a wider range of industry\nverticals, including chemicals, electronics,\nmanufacturing, aerospace, automotive and\nhealthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\n**Figure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**6** SPECIAL REPORT APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **7**\n\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern\ncompany that entered into a joint venture\nwith the North Korean government to provide\ntelecommunications service to the country (read\non for a case study). At that time, other targets\nincluded individuals involved in international\naffairs and trade issues, the general director of a\nVietnamese international trading and transport\ncompany, and possibly individuals working with\nOlympics organizations assisting in securing\nresources for athletes.\n\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related\ntargeting provides further evidence that APT37\nconducts operations aligned with the interests of\nNorth Korea.\n\n\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory\nmember, and journalist associated with different\nNorth Korean human rights issues and strategic\norganizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan\nassociated with the United Nations missions on\nsanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed\nSLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing\nthe Korea Global Forum against academic and\nstrategic institutions located in South Korea.\nNotably, the email was sent from a compromised\nSouth Korean institute that conducts studies on\nNorth Korea. The string “durihana,” which is also\nthe name of a Christian missionary organization\nthat works with North Korean defectors, was\nincluded in an APT37 weaponized document\nsent to an individual who works with a North\nKorean human rights organization.\n\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **7**\n\n### Initial Infection Vectors\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37\nleverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include\nstrategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage\noperations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute\nmalware more indiscriminately.\n\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics\ntailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular\ninterest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly\nleveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused\nin strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE\nand POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean\nconservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and\ndefectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader\napplication with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed\nto South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n**8** SPECIAL REPORT APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **9**\n\nCVE-2018-4878 (Zero-day vulnerability)\n\nCVE-2017-0199\n\nCVE-2013-4979\n\nCVE-2013-4979\n\nCVE-2015-2387\n\nCVE-2015-2545\n\nCVE-2015-7645\n\nCVE-2015-5122\n\nCVE-2016-4117\n\nCVE-2014-8439\n\nCVE Release Date\n\nCVE-2016-1019\n\nExploit\n\nCVE-2015-5119\n\nCVE-2015-2419\n\nCVE-2015-3105\n\n**FEB** **JAN** **DEC** **NOV** **OCT** **SEP** **AUG** **JUL** **JUN** **MAY** **APR** **MAR** **FEB** **JAN** **DEC** **NOV** **OCT** **SEP** **AUG** **JUL** **JUN** **MAY** **APR** **MAR** **FEB** **JAN** **DEC** **NOV** **OCT** **SEP** **AUG** **JUL** **JUN** **MAY** **APR** **MAR** **FEB** **JAN** **DEC** **NOV** **OCT** **SEP** **AUG** **JUL** **JUN** **MAY** **APR** **MAR** **FEB** **JAN**\n\n**2018** **2017** **2016** **2015** **2014**\n\n**Figure 3.

Further, the group\nrecently demonstrated access to zero-day\nvulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the\nflexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized\nvulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web\ncompromise operations. These capabilities suggest\na high operational tempo and specialized expertise.\n\nAPT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially\nin Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially\npublicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited\nby APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence\n\nfi d th t i t l t N b 2017 APT37\n\n\nexploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability,\nCVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to\nSouth Korean victims.\n\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over\nthe past several years has expanded beyond a\nnation-state dominated environment to include\ncommercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities\nand sophisticated financially motivated actors, access\nto zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing\nsophisticated or well-resourced actors.\n\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by\nAPT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the\ntime the CVE was released.\n\n\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command\nand control. They leverage compromised servers,\nmessaging platforms and cloud service providers\nto avoid detection. The group often relies on\ncompromised sites to host second stage malware\npayloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email\nproviders to set up command and control accounts\nin a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause\nmisdirection. These tactics have been refined over the\nyears as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\n\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as\ncommand and control for its malware tools. While\nsome early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which\nabused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity\nd l DOGCALL hi h l d t API\n\n\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host\nsecond stage malware. Small websites focused\non subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba\ndiving have been leveraged, and were most likely\ncompromised opportunistically and made to host\nmalicious payloads.\n\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over\ntime. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT\ninvolved credentials associated with Korea related\nmail servers such as “Daum.net”. Later, in 2015\nand early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email\nproviders such as Gmail and “hmamail.com” in an\nattempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016\nonward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @\ni di il t ibl tt t t\n\n\n-----\n\n**10** SPECIAL REPORT APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **11**\n\n### Malware\n\n\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion\nand exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus\non stealing information from victims, with many set up to\nautomatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37’s\nmalware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we\nassociate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye\ndevices, is available in the Appendix.\n\n\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes,\nAPT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017,\nAPT37 targeted South Korean military and government\norganizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY\nwiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not\nused in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a\nmachine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to\nfail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\n\n\nIt is possible that APT37’s distribution of KARAE malware\nvia torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining\nbotnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated\ncampaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and\ndestructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper\nmalware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false\nhacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare\ntactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past\nbehavior by other North Korean actors.\n\n\n**Figure 4.**\nTimeline of APT37 Malware Use\nBy First and Last Observed\nCompile Times.\n\n|2015|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|2016|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|2017|Col26|Col27|Col28|Col29|Col30|Col31|Col32|Col33|Col34|Col35|Col36|2018|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN|\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\nKARAE\n\nSOUNDWAVE\n\nZUMKONG\n\nRICECURRY\n\nCORALDECK\n\nPOORAIM\n\nSLOWDRIFT\n\nMILKDROP\n\nGELCAPSULE\n\nDOGCALL\n\nHAPPYWORK\n\nRUHAPPY\n\nSHUTTERSPEED\n\n\n-----\n\n**12** SPECIAL REPORT APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **13**\n\n\na dip around noon. Additional activity\noccurred late into the evening. This\nis consistent with media reporting of\nextremely long hours for North Korean\nworkers.\n\n- The majority of APT37 activity\n\ncontinues to target South Korea, North\nKorean defectors, and organizations\nand individuals involved in Korean\nPeninsula reunification efforts. Similarly,\nAPT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern\ncompany in 2017 is also consistent\nwith North Korean objectives given the\nentity’s extensive relationships inside\nNorth Korea.\n\n\n### Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that\nAPT37 acts in support of the North\nKorean government and is primarily\nbased in North Korea. This assessment\nis based on multiple factors, including\nAPT37’s targeting profile, insight into\nthe group’s malware development\nand probable links to a North Korean\nindividual believed to be the developer\nof several of APT37’s proprietary\nmalware families:\n\n**12 a.m.**\n\n**1 a.m.**\n\n**2 a.m**\n\n**3 a.m**\n\n**4 a.m**\n\n**5 a.m**\n\n**6 a.m**\n\n**7 a.m**\n\n**8 a.m**\n\n**9 a.m.**\n\n**10 a.m**\n\n**11 a.m.**\n\n**12 p.m.**\n\n**1 p.m.**\n\n**2 p.m.**\n\n**3 p.m.**\n\n**4 p.m.**\n\n**5 p.m.**\n\n**6 p.m.**\n\n**7 p.m.**\n\n**8 p.m.**\n\n**9 p.m.**\n\n**10 p.m.**\n\n**11 p.m.**\n\n\n\n- An individual we believe to be the\n\ndeveloper behind several APT37\nmalware payloads inadvertently\ndisclosed personal data showing that\nthe actor was operating from an IP\naddress and access point associated\nwith North Korea.\n\n- The compilation times of APT37\n\nmalware is consistent with a developer\noperating in the North Korea time\nzone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is\nbelieved to be a typical North Korean\nworkday (Fig. 5).

In other\naggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to\navailable to the regime, perhaps even desirable for the international stage. Ignored, these threats enjoy\nits relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract\nleveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar significant losses on their victims, many of whom\nroles and regions, especially as pressure mounts have never previously heard of the actor.\non their sponsor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**14** SPECIAL REPORT APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR **15**\n\n### Appendix: Malware Used by APT37\n\n|Malware CORALDECK DOGCALL GELCAPSULE HAPPYWORK KARAE|Description CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers. CORALDECK has been observed dropping and using Winrar to exfiltrate data in password protected RAR files as well as WinImage and zip archives. DOGCALL is a backdoor commonly distributed as an encoded binary file downloaded and decrypted by shellcode following the exploitation of weaponized documents. DOGCALL is capable of capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, evading analysis with anti-virtual machine detections, and leveraging cloud storage APIs such as Cloud, Box, Dropbox, and Yandex. DOGCALL was used to target South Korean Government and military organizations in March and April 2017. The malware is typically dropped using an HWP exploit in a lure document. The wiper tool, RUHAPPY, was found on some of the systems targeted by DOGCALL. While DOGCALL is primarily an espionage tool, RUHAPPY is a destructive wiper tool meant to render systems inoperable. GELCAPSULE is a downloader traditionally dropped or downloaded by an exploit document. GELCAPSULE has been observed downloading SLOWDRIFT to victim systems. HAPPYWORK is a malicious downloader that can download and execute a second-stage payload, collect system information, and beacon it to the command and control domains. The collected system information includes: computer name, user name, system manufacturer via registry, IsDebuggerPresent state, and execution path. In November 2016, HAPPYWORK targeted government and financial targets in South Korea. Karae backdoors are typically used as first-stage malware after an initial compromise. The backdoors can collect system information, upload and download files, and may be used to retrieve a second- stage payload. The malware uses public cloud-based storage providers for command and control. In March 2016, KARAE malware was distributed through torrent file-sharing websites for South Korean users. During this campaign, the malware used a YouTube video downloader application as a lure.|Detected as APT.InfoStealer.Win.CORALDECK FE_APT_InfoStealer_Win_ CORALDECK_1 FE_APT_RAT_DOGCALL FE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_ DOGCALL_1 APT.Backdoor.Win.DOGCALL FE_APT_Downloader_Win32_ GELCAPSULE_1 FE_APT_Downloader_ HAPPYWORK FE_APT_Exploit_HWP_Happy Downloader.APT.HAPPYWORK FE_APT_Backdoor_Karae_enc FE_APT_Backdoor_Karae Backdoor.APT.Karae|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|Malware MILKDROP POORAIM RICECURRY RUHAPPY SHUTTERSPEED|Description MILKDROP is a launcher that sets a persistence registry key and launches a backdoor. POORAIM malware is designed with basic backdoor functionality and leverages AOL Instant Messenger for command and control communications. POORAIM includes the following capabilities: System information enumeration, File browsing, manipulation and exfiltration, Process enumeration, Screen capture, File execution, Exfiltration of browser favorites, and battery status. Exfiltrated data is sent via files over AIM. POORAIM has been involved in campaigns against South Korean media organizations and sites relating to North Korean refugees and defectors since early 2014. Compromised sites have acted as watering holes to deliver newer variants of POORAIM. RICECURRY is a Javascript based profiler used to fingerprint a victim's web browser and deliver malicious code in return. Browser, operating system, and Adobe Flash version are detected by RICECURRY, which may be a modified version of PluginDetect. RUHAPPY is a destructive wiper tool seen on systems targeted by DOGCALL. It attempts to overwrite the MBR, causing the system not to boot. When victims' systems attempt to boot, the string \"Are you Happy?\" is displayed. The malware is believed to be tied to the developers of DOGCALL and HAPPYWORK based on similar PDB paths in all three. SHUTTERSPEED is a backdoor that can collect system information, acquire screenshots, and download/execute an arbitrary executable. SHUTTERSPEED typically requires an argument at runtime in order to execute fully. Observed arguments used by SHUTTERSPEED include: 'help', 'console', and 'sample'. The spear phishing email messages contained documents exploiting RTF vulnerability CVE-2017-0199. Many of the compromised domains in the command and control infrastructure are linked to South Korean companies.

It sends system information to the attacker command and control and then downloads and executes additional payloads. Lure documents distributing SLOWDRIFT were not tailored for specific victims, suggesting that TEMP.Reaper is attempting to widen its target base across multiple industries and in the private sector. SLOWDRIFT was seen being deployed against academic and strategic targets in South Korea using lure emails with documents leveraging the HWP exploit. Recent SLOWDRIFT samples were uncovered in June 2017 with lure documents pertaining to cyber crime prevention and news stories. These documents were last updated by the same actor who developed KARAE, POORAIM and ZUMKONG. SOUNDWAVE is a windows based audio capturing utility. Via command line it accepts the -l switch (for listen probably), captures microphone input for 100 minutes, writing the data out to a log file in this format: C:\\Temp\\HncDownload\\ YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log. ZUMKONG is a credential stealer capable of harvesting usernames and passwords stored by Internet Explorer and Chrome browsers. Stolen credentials are emailed to the attacker via HTTP POST requests to mail[.]zmail[.]ru. WINERACK is backdoor whose primary features include user and host information gathering, process creation and termination, filesystem and registry manipulation, as well as the creation of a reverse shell that utilizes statically-linked Wine cmd.exe code to emulate Windows command prompt commands. Other capabilities include the enumeration of files, directories, services, active windows and processes.|Detected as FE_APT_Downloader_Win_ SLOWDRIFT_1 FE_APT_Downloader_Win_ SLOWDRIFT_2 APT.Downloader.SLOWDRIFT FE_APT_HackTool_Win32_ SOUNDWAVE_1 FE_APT_Trojan_Zumkong Trojan.APT.Zumkong FE_APT_Backdoor_WINERACK Backdoor.APT.WINERACK|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nFireEye, Inc\n© 2018 FireEye, Inc.
