Statistics in this report reveal\nIC3’s success. IC3 marked the third year in a row that it received over 300,000 complaints, a 3.4-percent increase over\nthe previous year. The adjusted dollar loss of complaints was $485.3 million.[1]\n\nThe 2011 IC3 Internet Crime Report reveals both the scope of online crime and IC3’s battle against it. The most common\nvictim complaints included FBI-related scams, identity theft and advance fee fraud.[2] IC3 received and processed more than\n26,000 complaints per month. Based on victim complaints, the top five states were California (34,169), Florida (20,034),\nTexas (18,477), New York (15,056) and Ohio (12,661). Victims in California reported the highest dollar losses with a total\nof $70.5 million. For victims reporting financial losses, the average was $4,187.\n\nIC3 serves as a powerful conduit for law enforcement to share information and pursue cases that often span jurisdictional\nboundaries. Collaboration within this partnership has produced a number of technological advancements to streamline\nhow the public’s complaints are processed and referred to investigators. Initially established as simply a convenient\nmethod for citizens to report Internet crime information, IC3 has evolved into a vital resource for both victims of\nonline crime and for law enforcement across the country that investigate and prosecute a wide range of cases.\n\nYearly Comparison of Complaints[3]\n\n\n# 1\n\n\n350,000\n\n300,000\n\n250,000\n\n200,000\n\n150,000\n\n100,000\n\n50,000\n\n0\n\n\n336,655\n314,246\n303,809\n275,284\n\n231,493\n207,449 207,492 206,884\n\n124,449\n\n75,064\n50,412\n\n16,838\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\n\n\n1Methodology of evaluating loss amounts: FBI IC3 Unit staff reviewed for validity all complaints that reported a loss of more than $100,000. Analysts also converted losses reported\nin foreign currencies to dollars. The final amounts of all reported losses above $100,000 for which the complaint information did not support the loss amount were excluded from\nthe statistics.\n\n2Complaint category statistics that are based on the perceptions of the complaints are not typically accurate for statistical purposes. The statistics pulled from the complaints\nthemselves, however, are considerably more accurate as they are categorized and grouped through the IC3 automated system. IC3 does not verify complaint data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### IC3 Overview\n\nThe Internet Fraud Complaint Center — a partnership\nbetween NW3C, BJA and the FBI — was established\nMay 8, 2000 to address the ever-increasing incidence\nof online fraud. Just three years later, in response to\nthe exponential increase in cyber crime of all types,\nthe center changed its name to the Internet Crime\nComplaint Center (IC3®). Today, IC3 accepts more\ncomplaints in a single month than it received in its first\nsix months. With more than two million complaints\nreceived since its inception, IC3 serves as the nation’s\nportal for reporting Internet crime and suspicious\nactivity. IC3’s success has attracted international interest,\nwith Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany using\nIC3 as a model for similar cyber crime centers.\n\n###### Lifecycle of a Complaint\n\nVictims file complaints with IC3, some of which are\nauto-referred to appropriate law enforcement, while all\ngo into the expansive bank of Internet crime complaints\nthat make up the IC3 database.\n\n\nWhile developing a case, Internet crime analysts\ncompile similar complaints, collect relevant case\ninformation from both open- and closed-source\npublic information databases and confer with state,\nlocal, tribal, federal and international law enforcement\npersonnel. Of all the complaints received in 2011,\nonly 36.9 percent (115,903) reported financial\nloss. Although IC3 may not immediately build all\ncomplaints into referrals, all complaints are helpful\nin identifying trends and building statistical reports.\n\nIC3 compiles this information into reports that are\navailable to all law enforcement through direct emails\nand placement on www.ic3.gov. It also develops public\nawareness documents. IC3 encourages victims of\nInternet crime to report all incidents to IC3 – whether or\nnot an actual dollar loss is involved – due to the broad\ndissemination and varied uses of the data gathered from\nthe complaints.\n\n\n###### Complaint is Filed\n\n\n###### The Lifecycle of a Complaint at IC3\n\nCases for Law Enforcement\n\n                    - Criminal Prosecution\n\n                    - Restitution\n\nPublic Service Announcements\n\n                       - Media Distribution\n\n                       - Corporate Distribution\n\n                       - Website Posting\n\nIntelligence Reports\n\n                      - Corporate Analysts\n\n                      - Fusion Centers\n\n                      - Crime Analysts\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Resources for Building Cases\n\nIC3 analysts use an automated matching system to NW3C designed the Internet Complaint Search and\nidentify links and commonalities between numerous Investigation System (ICSIS®) to assist with Internetcomplaints and combine related investigations.

In 2010, 53.10 percent of complainants were\nmale and 46.89 percent were female. These numbers\nreflect a trend in recent years where the number of\nmale and female complainants is equalizing.\n\nThere was little change between 2010 and 2011 in\nthe age groups that filed complaints.

Criminals create an\nattractive deal by advertising vehicles for sale at prices\nbelow book value. Often the sellers claim they must\nsell the vehicle because they are moving for work or\nbeing deployed for the military. Because of the alleged\npending move, criminals refuse to meet in person or\nallow inspection of the vehicle, and they often attempt\nto rush the sale. To make the deal appear legitimate,\nthe criminal instructs the victim to send full or partial\n\n\npayment to a third-party agent via a wire transfer\npayment service and to fax their payment receipt to\nthe seller as proof of payment. The criminal pockets\nthe payment but does not deliver the vehicle.\n\nVictims of these scams reported losses exceeding $8.2\nmillion in 2011. With an average reported loss of more\nthan $2,000, more than $22,700 per day was lost to these\nfrauds, or $946.13 every hour. IC3 received a complaint\nof this variety approximately every two hours.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Auto-Fraud Scam Summary|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Male||Female||||\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|Complaints|Loss|Total Complaints|Total Loss|\n|Under 20|74|$141,244.39|73|$125,545.71|147|$266,790.10|\n|20 - 29|503|$888,033.90|454|$763,667.57|957|$1,651,701.47|\n|30 - 39|491|$967,194.68|410|$709,244.27|901|$1,676,438.95|\n|40 - 49|590|$1,282,333.20|380|$790,528.10|970|$2,072,861.30|\n|50 - 59|494|$1,031,193.53|253|$448,375.49|747|$1,479,569.02|\n|Over 60|271|$883,705.96|73|$257,031.93|344|$1,140,737.89|\n|Total|2,423|$5,193,705.66|1,643|$3,094,393.07|4,066|$8,288,098.73|\n\n\nMales Count by Age Range Females Count by Age Range\n\n\nUnder 20\n\n\nUnder 20\n\n\nOver 60\n\n\n-----\n\nRomance Scams\n\nIn 2011, IC3 received over 5,600 complaints of romance\nscams in which scammers target individuals who\nsearch for companionship or romance online. Victims\nbelieve they are “dating” someone decent and honest.\nHowever, the online contact is often a criminal with\na well-rehearsed script that scammers use repeatedly\nand successfully. Scammers search chat rooms, dating\nsites, and social networking sites looking for victims.\nAlthough the principal group of victims is over 40 years\nold, divorced or widowed, disabled and often elderly,\nall demographics are at risk.\n\nScammers use poetry, flowers and other gifts to reel in\nvictims, while declaring “undying love.” These criminals\n\n\nalso use stories of severe life circumstances, tragedies,\nfamily deaths, personal injuries or other hardships to\nkeep their victims concerned and involved in their\nschemes. They also ask victims to send money to help\novercome alleged financial hardships.\n\nThese scams not only take a high toll on victims\nemotionally, but monetarily as well. In 2011, victim\nreported losses to various romance scams totaled $50.4\nmillion. On average, each victim reported a loss of\n$8,900. At a rate of 15 complaints received per day, these\nscams saw daily reported losses of roughly $138,000, or\nmore than $5,700 every hour.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Romance Scam Summary|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Male||Female||||\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|Complaints|Loss|Total Complaints|Total Loss|\n|Under 20|20|$2,575.39|24|$28,207.00|44|$30,782.39|\n|20 - 29|268|$667,631.90|219|$530.617.45|487|$1,198,249.35|\n|30 - 39|339|$955,109.47|468|$2,784,399.71|807|$3,739,509.18|\n|40 - 49|486|$2,668,065.76|1,305|$8,481,733.46|1,791|$11,149,799.22|\n|50 - 59|438|$3,645,586.34|1,351|$18,802,678.69|1,789|$22,448,265.03|\n|Over 60|211|$2,551,007.37|534|$9,281,950.62|745|$11,832,957.99|\n|Total|1,762|$10,489,976.23|3,901|$39,909,586.93|5,663|$50,399,563.16|\n\n\nMales Count by Age Range Females Count by Age Range\n\n\nUnder 20\n20\n1%\n\n\nUnder 20\n24\n1%\n\n\n-----\n\nWork-from-Home Scams\n\nConsumers continue to lose money from work-fromhome scams that cyber criminals use to move stolen\nfunds. Regrettably, due to their participation, these\nindividuals may face criminal charges. Organized cyber\ncriminals recruit their victims through newspaper\nads, online employment services, unsolicited emails or\n“spam,” and social networking sites advertising workfrom-home “opportunities.”\n\nParticipating with a legitimate business, the consumer\nbecomes a “mule” for criminals who use the consumer’s\n\n\nor other victim’s accounts to steal and launder money.\nIn addition, the scammers may compromise the victim’s\nown identity or accounts.\n\nEmployment scams reported to IC3 in 2011 showed\nlosses exceeding $20 million. Complaints from victims\nof these scams averaged two per hour in 2011.

In these\nscams, a caller claims that the victim is delinquent in\na payday loan and must repay the loan to avoid legal\nconsequences. The callers purport to be representatives\nof the FBI, Federal Legislative Department, various\nlaw firms or other legitimate-sounding agencies. They\nclaim to be collecting debts for various companies.\n\nOne of the most insidious aspects of this scam is that\nthe callers have accurate information about the victims,\nincluding Social Security numbers, dates of birth,\naddresses, employer information, bank account numbers,\nand names and telephone numbers of relatives and\nfriends. The method by which the fraudsters obtained\nthe personal information is unclear, but victims often\n\n\nrelay that they had completed online applications for\nother loans or credit cards before the calls began.\n\nThe fraudsters relentlessly call the victims’ homes,\ncell phones and places of employment.

This could be a phishing\nscam.\n\n- Always compare the link in the email to the link\n\nthat you are actually directed to visit.\n\n- Log on to the entity’s official website, instead of\n\n“linking” to it from an unsolicited email.\n\n- Contact the actual business that supposedly sent the\n\nemail to verify if the email is genuine.\n\nSpam\n\n- Do not open spam. Delete it.\n\n- Never respond to spam because this will confirm to\n\nthe sender that it is a valid email address.\n\n- Have a primary and secondary email address — one\n\nfor people you know and one for all other purposes.\n\n- Avoid giving out your email address unless you\n\nknow how it will be used.\n\n- Never purchase anything advertised through\n\nunsolicited email.\n\nReshipping\n\n- Be cautious if you are asked to ship packages to an\n\n“overseas home office.”\n\n- Be leery if the individual states that his country\n\nwill not allow direct business shipments from the\nUnited States.\n\n- Be wary if the ship-to address is yours but the name\n\non the package is not.\n\n- Do not accept packages you did not order.\n\n- If you receive packages you did not order, either\n\nrefuse delivery or contact the company that sent the\npackage.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix II 2011 Public Service Announcements*\n\nDecember\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/111229.aspx\n\n- Password Safety Posted\n\n- Operation in Our Sites\n\nNovember\n**Holiday Shopping Tips**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/111121.aspx\n\n- Fraudulent Classified Ads or Auction Sales\n\n- Gift Card Scams\n\n- Phishing and Social Networking\n\nOctober\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/111017.aspx\n\n- Traffic Ticket Scam\n\n- Fraudster Double-Dipping\n\n- Online Vehicle Scam\n\n- Mystery Shopper Scam\n\n- Use of Government Officials’ Identities Scam\n\n- Modeling Scam\n\n- Purported FDIC Email Scam\n\nSeptember\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110901.aspx\n\n- Mass Joinder Lawsuits for Mortgage Relief\n\n- Online Auction Site Sony® Playstation® Bundle ad\n\nScam\n\n- Fraud Trends Effecting E-commerce\n\n- Advisory on Military Addresses\n\n- Email Address Tumbling\n\nAugust\n**Automotive Brand Hijackers:**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110815.aspx\n**Spam Emails Use FBI Officials’ Names:**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110809.aspx\n\nJuly\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110714.aspx\n\n- DDoS Attacks\n\n- Extortion Emails Targeting Physicians\n\n- Scam Promises Large Winnings; Threats for Non\ncompliance\n\n- Email Impersonating the FBI\n\n- Threatening IC3 Impersonation Calls\n\n\nMay\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110526.aspx\n\n- Current Events Fraud\n\n- Misrepresentation of the Financial Crimes\n\nEnforcement Network\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110510.aspx\n\n- Job Scam Used to Reship Merchandise to Russia\n\n- Counterfeit Check Scam Targeting Realtors and\n\nReal Estate Attorneys\n**Malicious Software Features Osama bin Laden Links:**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110504.aspx\n\nApril\n**Online Romance Scams:**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110429.aspx\n**Fraud Alert: Unauthorized Wire Transfers to China**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/\nChinaWireTransferFraudAlert.pdf\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110404.aspx\n\n- Automated Clearing House Spam\n\n- Lottery Scammers Misusing Public Services\n\n- Potassium Iodide Price Gouging\n\nMarch\n**Avoiding Fraudulent Charitable Contribution Schemes:**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110311.aspx\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110310.aspx\n\n- Romance Scammers\n\n- Phishing Email Regarding Alleged Rejection of Tax\n\nPayments\n\n- Telephone Scam Offering Virus Removal Services\n\nFebruary\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110214.aspx\n\n- Social Network Misspelling Scam\n\n- Fake Online Receipt Scam\n\n- Malicious Code in .gov Email\n\nJanuary\n**Emails Containing Malware Sent to Businesses**\n**Concerning Job Postings:**\nhttp://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110119.aspx\n\n_*Note: No PSAs were issued in June_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix III\n\n Complainant Statistics\n\n Complainant Statistics by State*\n\nRank State Percent Rank State Percent\n\n1 California 11.95% 27 Louisiana 1.02%\n\n2 Florida 7.01% 28 Connecticut 0.94%\n\n3 Texas 6.46% 29 Kentucky 0.87%\n\n4 New York 5.27% 30 Oklahoma 0.84%\n\n5 Ohio 4.43% 31 Utah 0.72%\n\n6 New Jersey 4.02% 32 Kansas 0.69%\n\n7 Pennsylvania 3.34% 33 Iowa 0.68%\n\n8 Illinois 3.07% 34 Arkansas 0.67%\n\n9 Virginia 2.96% 35 New Mexico 0.59%\n\n10 Washington 2.44% 36 Mississippi 0.55%\n\n11 Michigan 2.38% 37 West Virginia 0.49%\n\n12 North Carolina 2.35% 38 Alaska 0.49%\n\n13 Arizona 2.29% 39 Idaho 0.44%\n\n14 Georgia 2.23% 40 Hawaii 0.41%\n\n15 Maryland 2.20% 41 New Hampshire 0.39%\n\n16 Colorado 2.16% 42 Nebraska 0.35%\n\n17 Tennessee 1.81% 43 Maine 0.32%\n\n18 Indiana 1.67% 44 Montana 0.30%\n\n19 Massachusetts 1.61% 45 District of Columbia 0.29%\n\n20 Missouri 1.49% 46 Rhode Island 0.27%\n\n21 Wisconsin 1.39% 47 Delaware 0.26%\n\n22 Alabama 1.28% 48 Vermont 0.19%\n\n23 Oregon 1.25% 49 Wyoming 0.18%\n\n24 Nevada 1.23% 50 South Dakota 0.15%\n\n25 Minnesota 1.18% 51 North Dakota 0.13%\n\n26 South Carolina 1.09%\n\n_*Note: This is the total number of complaints from each state and the District of Columbia.
