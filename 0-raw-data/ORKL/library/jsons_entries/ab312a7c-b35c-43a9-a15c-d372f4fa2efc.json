So far,\nCofense has seen over 3,701 bank domains targeted as recipients.\n\n(Update: The campaign appeared to stop as of 15:37 EST. Number of banks targeted was\nupdated on 8/16/18. We will update this blog post if the situation changes.)\n\nNecurs is a rootkit first observed in 2012. It utilizes multiple Domain Generation Algorithms\n(DGA’s) coupled with .bit domain names as well as P2P communications to remain resilient\nagainst shutdown. Necurs became fairly famous when it began sending waves of Dridex and\nLocky a few years ago. We have noticed an uptick in campaigns originating from the Necurs\nbotnet in recent weeks.\n\nWhat stood out today is what changed. Necurs for months has been sending a seemingly\nnever-ending stream of typical spam campaigns. Today at 7:30am EST we noticed a new file\nextension attached to its phishing campaigns: .PUB, which belongs to Microsoft Publisher.\n\n\n-----\n\nLike Word and Excel, Publisher has the ability to embed macros. So just when you are\nfeeling confident about a layered defense protecting you from Malicious Word docs, Necurs\nadapts and throws you a curveball.\n\nThe other eyebrow-raising moment is when it was observed that all of the recipients worked\nfor banks. There were no free mail providers in this campaign, signaling clear intent by the\nattackers to infiltrate banks specifically.\n\nThe emails are fairly basic and appear to be coming from someone in India with the subject\nof “Request BOI” or “Payment Advice <random alpha numeric>”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attached file has a Microsoft Publisher, .pub, extension with an embedded macro. When\nexecuted, the macro gets the URL in the UserForm1.Frame1.tag object which further\ndownloads from a remote host.\n\n\n-----\n\nActions taken upon execution of the downloaded file:\n\nDrop a file to $cwd\\smth.exe\nDrop a copy of 7za.exe\nDrop a password protected archive\nUnpack with this command: `7za.exe x archive.7z -pX9e5UD6AN1vQCK08DM4O o”C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows” -aoa`\nDrops archive.cab, renames to winksys.exe\nLaunch winksys.exe\n\nIn this same phishing campaign targeting Banking employees, a smaller subset of the\nsamples used weaponized PDF files. These PDF files are identical to ones used in a very\nrecent campaign which leveraged .iqy files.\n\nThe final payload for this campaign is the FlawedAmmyy remote access trojan.\nFlawedAmmyy is based on the leaked source code for Ammyy Admin. This tool provides full\nremote control of the compromised host leading to file and credential theft as well as serving\nas a beachhead for any further lateral movement within the organization.\n\nAgain, as this campaign is evolving more than 2,700 bank domains have been target\nrecipients. The banks range from small regional banks all the way up to the largest financial\ninstitutions in the world. We have not yet determined the actor(s) behind this specific\ncampaign or the final goal. Cofense will continue to monitor the campaign for additional\ndevelopments.\n\n[For a look back and look ahead at major malware trends, view the 2018 Cofense Malware](https://cofense.com/malware-review-2018/)\nReview.\n\nIOC’s\n\nSubject: Request BOI\nSubject: Payment Advice DHS<9 digits>\n\nFilenames\n\n\n-----\n\nPayment_Advice_DHS<9 digits>.pub\npub\n\nFile MD5\n\n5fdeaa5e62fabc9933352efe016f1565\n\nURL\n\nHxxp://f79q[DOT]com/aa1\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/the-necurs-botnet-a-pandoras-box-of-malicious-spam/\n\nCurrent Cofense Triage™ and Cofense Intelligence™ customers:\n\nIf your employees received and reported this phishing campaign, the bad news is it made it\nthrough your perimeter defense.
