Without relaunching the heated debate on publishing offensive tools, this](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nblog post intends to summarize what an analyst needs to know about Cobalt Strike to quickly identify and analyze it during incidents.\n\n## Finding Cobalt Strike Servers#\n\n[A few months ago, the Salesforce security team published a new active fingerprint tool called JARM. It is the active equivalent to](https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a) [JA3 they](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3)\npublished last year. It generates a fingerprint based on the TLS configuration of a remote server, such as the TLS version or the TLS\nextensions, without considering the certificate. It is especially useful to identify custom web servers used by some tools, and Cobalt Strike is\none of them.\n\nHere is the Cobalt Strike JARM signature : `07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1`\n\n[JARM has already been added to Shodan,](https://www.shodan.io/) [BinaryEdge, and](https://www.binaryedge.io/) [SecurityTrails, Shodan recently added indexing on](https://securitytrails.com/) `ssl.jarm, so it is easy to`\nfind Cobalt Strike servers in the wild.\n\nLet’s check Shodan with `ssl.jarm:07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1 :`\n\n\n-----\n\nShodan has identified 5623 IP with this JARM fingerprint Cobalt Strike servers, mostly on Amazon and Digital Ocean. If we limit to port 443, we\nget 3423 IPs.\n\nWe can easily confirm that Cobalt Strike is still running on port 443 of the first IP using JARM:\n```\n$ python jarm.py 78.152.61.71\nDomain: 78.152.61.71\nResolved IP: 78.152.61.71\nJARM: 07d14d16d21d21d07c42d41d00041d24a458a375eef0c576d23a7bab9a9fb1\n\n```\n(This JARM signature is actually a signature of the Java Web server and specific to the JAVA 11 stack, so it includes other tools not related to\nCobalt Strike (like Burp Suite) and does not include Cobalt Strike using different Java versions. Cobalt Strike recently wrote a blog post about\nthis question.)\n\n## Getting a Cobalt Strike Payload#\n\nCobalt Strike uses a checksum of the url using an algorithm called checksum8 to serve the 32b or 64b version of the payload (in the same way\nas the [metasploit server). The decompiled code of Cobalt Strike has been published several times on GitHub or elsewhere, it provides](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/85a9accbeec063f52406621f124a7f82ad63dcba/lib/rex/payloads/meterpreter/uri_checksum.rb)\ninformation on this checksum:\n```\npublic static long checksum8(String text) {\n  if (text.length() < 4) {\n    return 0L;\n  }\n  text = text.replace(\"/\", \"\");\n  long sum = 0L;\n  for (int x = 0; x < text.length(); x++) {\n    sum += text.charAt(x);\n  }\n  return sum % 256L;\n}\npublic static boolean isStager(String uri) {\n  return (checksum8(uri) == 92L);\n}\npublic static boolean isStagerX64(String uri) {\n  return (checksum8(uri) == 93L && uri.matches(\"/[A-Za-z0-9]{4}\"));\n}\n\n```\nWe can easily bruteforce the algorithm to find urls that match it in python:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nimport string\ndef checksum8(strr):\n  j = 0\n  if len(strr) < 4:\n    return 0\n  strr = strr.replace(\"/\", \"\")\n  for c in strr:\n    j += ord(c)\n  return j % 256\nchars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\nto_attempt = product(chars, repeat=4)\nfor attempt in to_attempt:\n  word = ''.join(attempt)\n  r = checksum8(word)\n  if r == 92:\n    print(\"{:30} - 32b checksum\".format(word))\n  elif r == 93:\n    print(\"{:30} - 64b checksum\".format(word))\n$ python bf_checksum8.py\naaa9              - 32b checksum\naab8              - 32b checksum\naab9              - 64b checksum\naac7              - 32b checksum\naac8              - 64b checksum\naad6              - 32b checksum\naad7              - 64b checksum\n[...]\n\n```\nSo `/aaa9 should return the 32 bits beacon (if available) and` `/aab9 should return the 64 bits beacon (if available). Let’s test that on one of`\nthe Cobalt Strike servers from the Shodan list, `103.39.18.184 (AS136800 - ICIDC NETWORK - China) (one thing to know is that the Cobalt`\nStrike server blocks unusual user agents).\n```\n$ wget --no-check-certificate https://103.39.18.184/aaa9\n--2020-12-19 17:44:32-- https://103.39.18.184/aaa9\nConnecting to 103.39.18.184:443... connected.\nWARNING: cannot verify 103.39.18.184's certificate, issued by ‘CN=gmail.com,OU=Google Mail,O=Google GMail,L=Mountain\nView,ST=CA,C=US’:\n Self-signed certificate encountered.\n  WARNING: certificate common name ‘gmail.com’ doesn't match requested host name ‘103.39.18.184’.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found\n2020-12-19 17:44:33 ERROR 404: Not Found.\n$ wget --no-check-certificate --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36\" https://103.39.18.184/aaa9\n--2020-12-19 17:44:52-- https://103.39.18.184/aaa9\nConnecting to 103.39.18.184:443... connected.\nWARNING: cannot verify 103.39.18.184's certificate, issued by ‘CN=gmail.com,OU=Google Mail,O=Google GMail,L=Mountain\nView,ST=CA,C=US’:\n Self-signed certificate encountered.\n  WARNING: certificate common name ‘gmail.com’ doesn't match requested host name ‘103.39.18.184’.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\nLength: 208980 (204K) [application/octet-stream]\nSaving to: ‘aaa9’\naaa9          100%[============================>] 204.08K  655KB/s  in 0.3s\n2020-12-19 17:44:53 (655 KB/s) - ‘aaa9’ saved [208980/208980]\n$ wget --no-check-certificate --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36\" https://103.39.18.184/aab9\n--2020-12-19 17:44:58-- https://103.39.18.184/aab9\nConnecting to 103.39.18.184:443... connected.\nWARNING: cannot verify 103.39.18.184's certificate, issued by ‘CN=gmail.com,OU=Google Mail,O=Google GMail,L=Mountain\nView,ST=CA,C=US’:\n Self-signed certificate encountered.\n  WARNING: certificate common name ‘gmail.com’ doesn't match requested host name ‘103.39.18.184’.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\nLength: 260679 (255K) [application/octet-stream]\nSaving to: ‘aab9’\naab9          100%[============================>] 254.57K  872KB/s  in 0.3s\n2020-12-19 17:44:59 (872 KB/s) - ‘aab9’ saved [260679/260679]\n\n```\nSo this IP `103.39.18.184 gives us two Cobalt Strike beacons:`\n\n\n-----\n\na06e bebca b6beda a 6 0be6acda9590ab3 b38e d5 0 aaa9 (3 b)\n[04bf2657dedfc99235220f59d3e7284d9e2ef0a183cd90ee3514137481a27d6c aab9 (64b)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/04bf2657dedfc99235220f59d3e7284d9e2ef0a183cd90ee3514137481a27d6c/detection)\n\n## Decrypting Cobalt Strike Beacons#\n\nThe files returned by the server are actually not PE file:\n```\n$ file *\naaa9:   data\naab9:   data\n\n```\nDuring the execution of a Cobalt Strike exploit, it downloads this beacon and run it directly in memory. So this file is a blob of data containing a\nshellcode at the beginning that decodes and executes the beacon.\n\nWe can easily graph this shellcode with miasm:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first JMP goes to a call right before the encryption key and encrypted beacon. The call goes back to the shellcode and the next `POP EDX`\ngets the address of the key. The code in `loc_f gets the key in EBX, the length of the payload in EAX, and store on the address of the final`\nbeacon on the stack. The loop in `loc_1d goes through the beacon and xor it with the key.`\n\nWe can easily reproduce it in python, the challenge is to find the base address. Here the `loc_47 is the address of the call just before the key,`\nlength, and encrypted payload, so the base address is 0x47 + 5 (the length of the call instruction). The base address changes with different\npayloads but it is possible to find it easily by searching the last call instruction.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndef xor(a, b):\n  return bytearray([a[0]^b[0], a[1]^b[1], a[2]^b[2], a[3]^b[3]])\nwith open(\"aaa9\", \"rb\") as f:\n  data = f.read()\nba = 0x4c\nkey = data[ba:ba+4]\nprint(\"Key : {}\".format(key))\nsize = struct.unpack(\"I\", xor(key, data[ba+4:ba+8]))[0]\nprint(\"Size : {}\".format(size))\nres = bytearray()\ni = ba+8\nwhile i < (len(data) - ba - 8):\n  d = data[i:i+4]\n  res += xor(d, key)\n  key = d\n  i += 4\nwith open(\"a.out\", \"wb+\") as f:\n  f.write(res)\n\n```\nWe get a PE file : [3c9a06b2477694919b1c77d3288984cb793a47dd328ef39e15132cd0cfb593ab.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3c9a06b2477694919b1c77d3288984cb793a47dd328ef39e15132cd0cfb593ab/detection)\n\nIt is surprising to see a PE file directly there because it is directly executed by the last call. The trick is that the PE file is actually modified to be\n[at the same time a valid PE file and executable directly (something Cobalt Strike calls raw stageless payload artifact). We see here the MZ](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2016/06/15/what-is-a-stageless-payload-artifact/)\nheader being executed:\n\nThe DOS header is modified to include valid instructions that jump to the address 0x8157 in the binary. This address is the address of the\nexported `_ReflectiveLoader@4 function, a function based on the ReflectiveDLLInjection software that is in charge of reproducing a simple`\nPE loader to load and map import functions before calling the entry point.\n\n(Note that this is only optional in Cobalt Strike, many Cobalt Strike payloads do not have a PE file format but the payload directly in a\nshellcode-like format).\n\n## Extracting the Configuration#\n\nThe Cobalt Strike configuration is encrypted within the payload, with a different key depending on the Cobalt Strike version, either 0x2E or\n0x69. Once decoded, the configuration is stored in the format type-length-value :\n\nOne short that represent the key of the data (the list can be found in the Cobalt Strike source code)\nTwo short bytes representing the type of data (Int, Short, String, etc.) and its length\nThe data itself\n\nTo find the start address of the configuration, we can look for the encoded value of the first key, which is 1 (DNS/SSL), 1 (Short), 2 (2 bytes),\nwhich is encoded to `ihihik with the key 0x69 or` `././., with the key 0x2E.`\n\nWe can then decode the configuration of the beacon:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nssl              True\nport              443\n.sleeptime           60000\n.http-get.server.output    \n00000004000000010000017700000001000000fa0000000200000004000000020000001c000000020000002400000002000000120000000200000004000000020000\n.jitter            15\n.maxdns            255\npublickey           \n30819f300d06092a864886f70d010101050003818d0030818902818100aef69a6fb8f21092c01a95cbdcac0f03f79738adecda36cffc6c5cf607943e72663865f8f6\n.http-get.uri         156.226.191.234,/_/scs/mail-static/_/js/,djiqowenlsakdj.com,/_/scs/mail-static/_/js/\n.user-agent          Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; MALCJS)\n.http-post.uri         /mail/u/0/\n.http-get.client        OSID=Cookie\nGAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nDNT: 1\nui=d3244c4707ient\n        hop=6928632 start=0\n=Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8OSID=Cookie\n.spawto\n.post-ex.spawnto_x86      %windir%\\syswow64\\notepad.exe\n.post-ex.spawnto_x64      %windir%\\sysnative\\notepad.exe\n.pipename\n.cryptoscheme         0\n.dns_idle           134743044\n.dns_sleep           0\n.http-get.verb         GET\n.http-post.verb        POST\nshouldChunkPosts        0\n.watermark           305419896\n.stage.cleanup         0\nCFGCaution           0\nhost_header\ncookieBeacon          1\n.proxy_type          2\nfunk              0\nkilldate            0\ntext_section          0\nprocess-inject-start-rwx    64\nprocess-inject-use-rwx     64\nprocess-inject-min_alloc    0\nprocess-inject-transform-x86\nprocess-inject-transform-x64\nprocess-inject-stub      a56c813864af878a4c10083ca1578e0a\nprocess-inject-execute\nprocess-inject-allocation-method 0\n\n## Putting Everything Together#\n\n```\nNow that we have decoded everything, it is quite easy to do the request, extract the beacon and the configuration directly. I have put all this in\n[a script available on this github repository:](https://github.com/Te-k/cobaltstrike)\n```\n$ python scan.py https://103.39.18.184/\nChecking https://103.39.18.184/\nUnknown config command 55\nConfiguration of the x86 payload\ndns              False\nssl              True\nport              443\n.sleeptime           60000\n.http-get.server.output    \n00000004000000010000017700000001000000fa0000000200000004000000020000001c000000020000002400000002000000120000000200000004000000020000\n.jitter            15\n.maxdns            255\n[SNIP]\nx86_64: Payload not found\n\n```\n[It is common to find the same configuration for many different samples because CS uses what they call Malleable C2 Profiles which are](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2)\nactually configurations for the CS beacons that can be shared easily through configuration files. For instance, Ocean Lotus uses a public\nprofile mimicking Google Safebrowsing urls. This [repository list profiles used by different APT or cybercrime groups.](https://github.com/xx0hcd/Malleable-C2-Profiles)\n\nOne interesting value in the configuration is the watermark, which is a number generated from the license file. As it is unique to a customer, it\n[can be used to pivot and link multiple CobaltStrike instances together (as it was done for Trickbot). As such, many cracked versions of](https://labs.sentinelone.com/enter-the-maze-demystifying-an-affiliate-involved-in-maze-snow/)\n[CobaltStrike disable this watermark This watermark is technically associated with the Cobalt Strike Customer id so it should be possible to](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-authorization-files)\n\n\n-----\n\nepo t t s d to Coba t St e a d de t y t e custo e o peop e us g pa d ce ses, but a e e e ea d a yo e do g t at ( guess e\nAPT groups have a valid CS license).\n\n## Extracting Configuration of 1000 Cobalt Strike Servers#\n\n[Based on the same code, I have scanned the 3424 servers identified with JARM in Shodan, I have scanned them all using this script and](https://github.com/Te-k/cobaltstrike/blob/master/scan_list.py)\nfound 520 serving Cobalt Strike beacons.\n\n[I have uploaded on GitHub a csv listing the IPs and configuration of these beacons, here is a short extract:](https://github.com/Te-k/cobaltstrike/blob/master/output.csv)\n\n**Host** **GET URI**\n\n54.66.253.144 `54.66.253.144,/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/167-3294888-0262949/field-keywords=books`\n\n103.243.183.250 `103.243.183.250,/search.js`\n\n185.82.126.47 `185.82.126.47,/pixel`\n\n94.156.174.121 `94.156.174.121,/watch`\n\n194.36.191.118 `194.36.191.118,/visit.js`\n\n23.106.160.198 `repshd.com,/us/ky/louisville/312-s-fourth-st.html,pinglis.com,/us/ky/louisville/312-s-fourth-`\n```\n          st.html,stargut.com,/us/ky/louisville/312-s-fourth-st.html\n\n```\n23.81.246.46 `contmetric.com,/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/167-3294888-0262949/field-keywords=books`\n\n108.174.193.11 `qw.removerchangefile.monster,/media.html,as.removerchangefile.monster,/media.html,zx.removerchangefile`\n\n213.217.0.218 `213.217.0.218,/visit.js`\n\n213.252.247.31 `1nubjgrcfjhjhkjftdd.com,/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/167-3294888-0262949/field-keywords=books`\n\n165 of them over 523 have no watermark, another watermark (305419896) is used by 160 IPs, so it is likely a default value.
