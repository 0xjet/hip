They are aiming\nat the victim’s banking credentials by mimicking major bank sites. The fake sites prompt the\nvictim to install an application on their mobile devices, which could potentially lead to further\ninfection and data leakage from the mobile platform as well.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we’ve seen a surge in the OSX/Dok samples, as the attackers are\npurchasing dozens of Apple certificates to sign on the application bundle and bypass\nGateKeeper (see details below). Apple is constantly revoking the compromised certificates\nas we’re informing them of the ones we identify, however new ones appear on a daily basis.\n\nThe OSX/Dok malware is distributed via a phishing campaign, which is usually not a new or\nsurprising attack vector, however this time it targets specifically macOS users, who are\nmostly perceived as malware-proof. This phishing campaign is combined with a MiTM\nattack, allowing complete access to all victim communication, even if it’s SSL encrypted.\n\n**New details on OSX/Dok obfuscation techniques**\n\nWhile the attack vector is still the same, victims receive a phishing mail with the malicious\napplication attached as a zip file, the malware has mutated, making its detection and\nremoval more difficult. Here are the main techniques it uses for this purpose:\n\n**Disabling security updates**\n\nThe malware modifies OS settings to disable security updates. Here is the shell command\nthe malware executes in order to achieve this:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, it modifies the local host file in a way that prevents the victim and some Apple\nservices to communicate outside by adding lines to the hosts file:\n\nsudo echo “127.0.0.1 localhost\n\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n\n::1       localhost\n\n127.0.0.1 metrics.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 ocsp.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 su.itunes.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 ax.su.itunes.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 swscan.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 swcdn.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 swdist.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 a1.phobos.apple.com\n\n…….\n\n…….. many more….\n\n…….\n\n127.0.0.1 volume.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 war.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 www1.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 wwwtest.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 xml.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 xp.apple.com\n\n127.0.0.1 xp2.apple.com\n\n\n-----\n\n127.0.0.1 virustotal.com\n\n127.0.0.1 www.virustotal.com” > /private/etc/hosts\n\nThis way all communication attempts to the hosts listed on the file are redirected to the local\nmachine, blocking all traffic of the infected computer from reaching Apple websites or\nVirusTotal – a free online service that analyzes files and URLs enabling the identification of\nviruses, worms, trojans and other types of malware.\n\n**Signing the malware with Apple certificates**\n\nThe perpetrators are willing to pay for Apple certificates ($99 each) in order to sign on the\napplication bundle, thus obfuscating its malicious intent. An application signed by a\nlegitimate Apple developer certificate will bypass GateKeeper – a security feature in macOS\nthat aims to prevent installation of unsigned application in the system with its default\nsettings.\n\nHere is an example of a signature used by the malicious OSX/Dok bundle from recent days:\n\nAlso, the malware authors keep naming the application bundle similar to the ones used by\nApple, such as “App1e.AppStore” or “iTunes.AppStore”, trying to make it look more\ncredible.\n\n**Location based attack tailoring**\n\nAfter installing a TOR service, for communication with the command and control over the\ndark web, and proxy, the malware geo-locates the victim according to IP, and then possibly\nserves them appropriate proxy file settings according to location. Some IPs were not\nserved at all, as it seems that the malware targets mainly European residents.\n\nHere are the proxy settings for a victim using a Swiss IP:\n\nAs we can see, the proxy file will redirect all traffic to the mentioned domains, used mainly\nby banks (such as ‘credit-suisse’, ‘globalance-bank’, ‘cbhbank’, etc.) or other financial\nentities, to the local proxy that the malware had set up on the local machine. The proxy will\nthen redirect it to the malicious C&C server on TOR (currently is “m665veffg3tqxoza.onion”).\nThis way, once the victim tries to visit any of the listed sites, they will be redirected to a fake\nwebsite on the attacker’s C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OSX/Doc operational flow example**\n\nAfter attempting to visit credit-suisse.com, we are greeted with the page below which\nnotifies us of the need to install a mobile phone application for security reasons (the original\nmessage is in German):\n\nUpon hitting the “ok” button the login page appears. Note the differences between the fake\nlogin page and the original one:\n\n**Fake page from an infected machine**\n\n**Original Page**\n\n\n-----\n\nHere are the main discrepancies to be aware of:\n\n**Wrong years** **of** **copyright – the C&C server is probably using an old snapshot of the**\n“Credit-Suisse” bank site from 2013 (appears in the left bottom side of the page).\n**Missing the original Credit-Suisse SSL certificate – there was no alert on that**\nbecause the malware installed a fake certificate in the root chain; however it is\npossible to note that the fake certificate is general.\n**Missing auth token in the URL – token based authentication ensures each request**\nto a server is accompanied by a signed token which the server verifies and only then\nresponds. In this case, there’s no token as the communication is with the C&C server\nand not with the real one.\n\nUpon entering their credentials, the victim is met with a page asking for their favored\nmethod of authentication:\n\nAfter choosing “SMS” (other options do not seem to be viable) the victim is prompted to\ndownload and install the mobile application of which they were notified earlier, via a link that\nis sent to their mobile device (which they’re requested to provide):\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the paragons of customer service, the attackers offer a direct application download via\nQR code in case the SMS message was not received:\n\nWe were surprised to discover that at this point of time the attackers use this process to\ninstall “Signal”, a legitimate messenger application. Remember this could change at any\nmoment if the hackers decide they want to target the victim’s mobile device as well and\ninstall a mobile malware.\n\nThe reasoning behind installing a messenger application on the victim’s device is not\nentirely clear. One possibility is that the installation is used as a method to bypass the two\nfactor (2FA) authentication – often a part of the registration process to access a banking\nsite. In this case the user usually receives an SMS message with a password (OTP – One\nTime Password) that is valid only for a very short period of time and has to be entered\nbefore access is granted. However, had the attacker been active at the bank’s site in\nparallel to the user activities at the fake site, it would have been possible to bypass the 2FA\nwithout the application since the attacker would use the password that the user had just\npunched in and would manage to get through to the site.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn light of this, it is possible that Signal installed on the victim s mobile device would allow\nthe attacker to communicate with the victim at a later stage, as the perpetrator is not\nnecessarily active at the same time the victim reaches for the banking site. Using Signal\nmay make it easier for the attacker to masquerade as the bank and trick the victim into\nproviding the SMS they had received from the real bank, when the attacker tries to log in to\nthe site (in case the credentials alone are not enough due to the 2FA). Similarly, the\nperpetrator might use Signal to commit additional fraudulent activities against victim at a\nlater time. Whatever the goal may be, Signal will possibly make it harder for law\nenforcement to trace the attacker.\n\nAlternatively, the perpetrator might be using Signal temporarily, to acquire install rate\nstatistics and prove the method is working, while planning to install a malicious mobile\napplication with future victims at a later time.\n\nIn any case, upon successful completion of this operational flow, the attacker gains access\nto the victim’s bank account and gets to carry out some bank transactions, though probably\nnot the ones the victim had in mind.\n\n**Similarity to the “Retefe” malware**\n\n[After we posted our previous report about OSX/Dok, we were notified by a fellow](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/04/27/osx-malware-catching-wants-read-https-traffic/)\nresearcher about the similarities between OSX/Dok and “Retefe”, which is a banking Trojan\nknown for several years, mostly active on Windows platform. After further investigation we\ncan, indeed, conclude that OSX/Dok is the same malware ported from Windows.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnfortunately, the OSX/Dok malware is still on the loose and its owners continue to invest\nmore and more in its obfuscation by using legitimate Apple certificates.\n\nThe fact that the OSX/Dok is ported from Windows may point to a tendency. We believe\nmore Windows malware will be ported to macOS, either due to the lower number of quality\nsecurity products for macOS compared to the ones for Windows, or the rising popularity of\nApple computers. According to Gartner, Macs have more than tripled their total market\nshare in less than a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, we will continue to raise awareness to the various malware activities and\nmodus operandi and arm the users with the required information to stay safe from the everevolving fraudulent attacks.\n\n\n-----",
