We announce the development of something really cool, a huge platform for\nindependent leaks, we have no rules and bosses, we will publish private products in a\nsingle information platform where we will post leaks of successful no-name teams that\ndo not have their own blogs and names, these are not girls who run with ship like rats\nand change the policy of their resources. these are really strong guys.\n\nAnother loud leak awaits you within a week.\n\nToday, we began to see the changes as the site is now called Payload Bin.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: DataBreaches.net\nThe About and Rules pages are not available yet and so far there is only one leak\n[listed under Announcements: CD Projekt. CD Projekt was attacked in February by](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/)\n[attackers using what is believed to be the Hello Kitty ransomware. The hackers had](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cd-projekts-stolen-source-code-allegedly-sold-by-ransomware-gang/)\nput the stolen source code up for sale on a Russian-language forum, listing it all as:\n\nFull sources for the games Thronebreaker, Witcher 3, the\nundeclared Witcher 3 RTX (the version of the Witcher with raytracing) and of\ncourse Cyberpunk 2077\nDumps of internal documents\n**CD Projekt RED offenses .**\n\nThey subsequently withdrew the auction listing, claiming that they had received a\nsatisfactory offer from outside of the forum, and that because of a condition of no\nfurther distribution, they were removing the listing from auction.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource code withdrawn from auction. Image: DataBreaches.net\nNow Payload Bin says they will make all source code available on its site. So what,\nexactly, happened to that sale with “no further distribution?”\n\nImage: DataBreaches.net\n\n\n-----",
