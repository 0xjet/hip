The company’s Orion IT, a solution for monitoring and\nmanaging customers’ IT infrastructure, was compromised by threat actors. This resulted in\nthe deployment of a custom backdoor, named Sunburst, on the networks of more than\n18,000 SolarWinds customers, including many large corporations and government bodies, in\nNorth America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nOne thing that sets this campaign apart from others, is the peculiar victim profiling and\nvalidation scheme. Out of the 18,000 Orion IT customers affected by the malware, it seems\nthat only a handful were of interest to the attackers. This was a sophisticated attack that\nemployed several methods to try to remain undetected for as long as possible. For example,\nbefore making the first internet connection to its C2s, the Sunburst malware lies dormant for\nup to two weeks, preventing easy detection of this behaviour in sandboxes. In our initial\n\n\n-----\n\n[report on Sunburst, we examined the method used by the malware to communicate with its](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\nC2 (command-and-control) server and the protocol used to upgrade victims for further\nexploitation.\n\nFurther investigation of the Sunburst backdoor revealed several features that overlap with a\npreviously identified backdoor known as Kazuar, a .NET backdoor first reported in 2017 and\ntentatively linked to the Turla APT group.\n\nThe shared features between Sunburst and Kazuar include the victim UID generation\nalgorithm, code similarities in the initial sleep algorithm and the extensive usage of the\nFNV1a hash to obfuscate string comparisons. There are several possibilities: Sunburst may\nhave been developed by the same group as Kazuar; the developers of Sunburst may have\nadopted some ideas or code from Kazuar; both groups obtained their malware from the\nsame source; some Kazuar developers moved to another team, taking knowledge and tools\nwith them; or the developers of Sunburst introduced these links as a form of false flag.\nHopefully, further analysis will make things clearer.\n\n### Lazarus targets the defence industry\n\nWe have observed numerous activities of the Lazarus group over many years, with the threat\nactor changing targets depending on its objectives. Over the last two years, we have tracked\nLazarus’s use of ThreatNeedle, an advanced malware cluster of Manuscrypt (aka\n[NukeSped), to target several industries. While investigating attacks on the defense industry](https://securelist.com/lazarus-threatneedle/100803/)\nin mid-2020, we were able to observe the complete life-cycle of an attack, uncovering more\ntechnical details and links to the group’s other campaigns.\n\nLazarus made use of COVID-19 themes in its spear-phishing emails, embellishing them with\npersonal information gathered using publicly available sources. Once the victim opens an\ninfected document and agrees to enable macros, the malware is dropped onto the system\nand proceeds to a multi-stage deployment procedure.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter gaining an initial foothold, the attackers gathered credentials and moved laterally,\nseeking crucial assets in the victim’s environment. They overcame network segmentation by\ngaining access to an internal router machine and configuring it as a proxy server, allowing\nthem to exfiltrate stolen data from the victim’s intranet to their remote server.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have been tracking ThreatNeedle malware for more than two years and are highly\nconfident that this malware cluster is attributed only to the Lazarus group. During this\ninvestigation, we were able to find connections to several other clusters belonging to the\nLazarus group.\n\n### MS Exchange zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in the wild\n\nOn March 2, Microsoft released out-of-band patches for four zero-day vulnerabilities in\nExchange Server that are being actively exploited in the wild (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-202126857, CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065). The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to\ngain access to an Exchange server, create a web shell for remote server access and steal\ndata from the victim’s network.\n\nMicrosoft attributed the attacks to a threat actor called Hafnium, although other researchers\n[have reported that there are also other groups exploiting the vulnerabilities to launch attacks.](https://threatpost.com/microsoft-exchange-servers-apt-attack/164695/)\n\nOur [threat intelligence indicates that companies across the globe have been targeted in](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)\nattacks that exploit these vulnerabilities – with the greatest focus on Europe and the US.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Kaspersky products protect against this threat with behavior-based detection and](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/wiki-section/products/behavior-based-protection) exploit\nprevention components. We also detect and block the backdoors used in the exploitation of\n[these vulnerabilities. Our EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solution helps to identify](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/endpoint-detection-response-edr)\nattacks in the early stages by marking suspicious actions with special IoA (Indicators of\nAttack) tags and by creating corresponding alerts.\n\nOur recommendations for staying safe from attacks using these vulnerabilities can be found\n[here.](https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/101096/)\n\n### Ecipekac: sophisticated multi-layered loader discovered in A41APT campaign\n\nA41APT is a long-running campaign, active from March 2019 to the end of December 2020,\nthat has targeted multiple industries, including Japanese manufacturing and its overseas\nbases. We believe, with high confidence, that the threat actor behind this campaign is\nAPT10.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne particular piece of malware from this campaign is called Ecipekac (aka DESLoader,\nSigLoader, and HEAVYHAND). It is a very sophisticated multi-layer loader module used to\ndeliver payloads such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAnti which in turn loads QuasarRAT.\n\nThe operations and implants of the campaign are remarkably stealthy, making it difficult to\ntrack the threat actor’s activities. The threat actor behind the campaign implements several\nmeasures to conceal itself and make it more difficult to analyze. Most of the malware families\nused in the campaign are fileless malware and have not been seen before.\n\nWe believe that the most significant aspect of the Ecipekac malware is that the encrypted\nshellcodes are inserted into digitally signed DLLs without affecting the validity of the digital\nsignature.\n\nWhen this technique is used, some security solutions cannot detect these implants. Judging\nfrom the main features of the P8RAT and SodaMaster backdoors, we believe these modules\nare downloaders responsible for downloading further malware which we have so far been\nunable to obtain.\n\n[You can find out more about the campaign here.](https://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Other malware\n\n### Fake ad blocker, with miner included\n\nSome time ago, we discovered a number of fake applications being used to deliver a Monero\ncrypto-currency miner to target computers. The fake programs are distributed through\nmalicious websites that may be listed in the victim’s search results. We believe this is a\n[continuation of a campaign last summer, reported by Avast, in which the malware](https://blog.avast.com/fake-malwarebytes-installation-files-distributing-coinminer)\nmasqueraded as the Malwarebytes antivirus installer. In [the latest campaign, we observed](https://securelist.com/ad-blocker-with-miner-included/101105/)\nthe malware impersonating several applications: the ad blockers AdShield and Netshield, as\nwell as the OpenDNS service.\n\nOnce the victim has started the program, it changes the DNS settings on the device so that\nall domains are resolved through the attackers’ servers: this prevents the victim from\naccessing certain antivirus sites. The malware then updates itself: the update also\ndownloads and runs a modified Transmission torrent client, which sends the ID of the\ntargeted computer, along with installation details, to the C2 server. It then downloads and\ninstalls the miner.\n\nData from Kaspersky Security Network showed that, from February 2021 until the time we\npublished our report, there were attempts to install fake applications on the devices of more\nthan 7,000 people. At the peak of the current campaign, more than 2,500 people were\nattacked each day, with most victims located in Russia and CIS countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ransomware encrypting virtual hard disks\n\nRansomware gangs are exploiting vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi to target virtual hard disks\nand encrypt the data stored on them. The ESXi hypervisor lets multiple virtual machines\nstore information on a single server using the SLP (Service Layer Protocol).\n\n[The first vulnerability (CVE-2019-5544) can be used to carry out heap overflow attacks. The](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0022.html)\n[second (CVE-2020-3992) is a](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0023.html) [Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability related to the incorrect use](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/use-after-free/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nof dynamic memory during program operation. Once attackers have been able to gain an\ninitial foothold in the target network, they can use the vulnerabilities to generate malicious\nSLP requests and compromise data storage.\n\n[The vulnerabilities are being exploited by RansomExx. The](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ransomware-in-virtual-environment/39150/) [Darkside group is reportedly](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/darkside-20-ransomware-fastest/)\n[using the same approach; and the attackers behind the BabuLocker Trojan have also hinted](https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1354237766285012992)\nthat they are able to encrypt ESXi.\n\n### macOS developments\n\n\n-----\n\nTowards the end of last year, Apple unveiled machines powered by its own M1 chip,\ndesigned to replace Intel’s processors in its computers. The Apple M1, a direct relative of the\nprocessors used in the iPhone and iPad, will ultimately allow Apple to unify its software\nunder a single architecture.\n\nJust a few months after the release of the first Apple M1 computers, malware writers had\nalready recompiled their code to adapt it to the new architecture.\n\n[These include the developers of XCSSET, malware first discovered last year, which targets](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/h/xcsset-mac-malware--infects-xcode-projects--uses-0-days.html)\nMac developers by injecting a malicious payload into Xcode IDE projects on the victim’s Mac.\nThis payload is subsequently executed during the building of project files in Xcode. XCSSET\nmodules are able to read and dump Safari cookies, inject malicious JavaScript code into\nvarious websites, steal files and information from applications such as Notes, WeChat,\nSkype, Telegram and others, and encrypt files. The samples we have observed include some\ncompiled specifically for the Apple Silicon chips.\n\n[Silver Sparrow is another new threat that targets the M1 chip. This malware introduces a](https://redcanary.com/blog/clipping-silver-sparrows-wings/)\nnew way for malware writers to abuse the default packaging functionality: instead of placing\na malicious payload inside pre-install or post-install scripts, they hid one in the Distribution\nXML file. This payload uses JavaScript API to run bash commands in order to download a\nJSON configuration file. The sample extracts a URL from the “downloadURL” field for the\nnext download. An appropriate Launch Agent is also created for persistent execution of the\nmalicious sample. The JavaScript payload can be executed regardless of chip architecture,\nbut analysis of the package file makes it clear that it supports both Intel and M1 chips.\n\nMost malicious objects detected for the macOS platform are adware. The developers of\nthese programs are also updating their code to include support for the M1 chip, including the\nPirrit and Bnodlero families.\n\nYou can find technical details, along with our FAQ on M1 threats, [here.](https://securelist.com/malware-for-the-new-apple-silicon-platform/101137/)\n\nCybercriminals don’t just add support for new platforms: sometimes they use new\nprogramming languages to develop their ‘products’. Recently, macOS adware developers\nhave been paying more attention to new languages, apparently in the hope that such code\nwill be more opaque to virus analysts who have little or no experience with the newer\nlanguages. We have already seen quite a few samples written in Go, and recently\ncybercriminals have turned their attention to Rust as well. You can read our analysis of a new\n[adware program called Convuster here.](https://securelist.com/convuster-macos-adware-in-rust/101258/)\n\n### Secondhand news\n\nThere’s a strong market in secondhand computing devices. Some of our researchers\n[recently looked at the security implications of buying and selling secondhand devices: their](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/data-on-used-devices/38610/)\naim was to see what traces are left behind on laptops and other storage data when people\nsell them\n\n\n-----\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the devices we investigated contained at least some traces of\ndata – mostly personal but some corporate. Researchers were able to access data on more\nthan 16% of the devices outright. A further 74% contained data that could be recovered\nusing [file-carving methods. Only 11% of devices had been wiped properly.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_carving)\n\nThe data recovered ranged from the harmless to revealing and even dangerous: calendar\nentries, meeting notes, access data for corporate resources, internal business documents,\npersonal photos, medical information, tax documents and more. Some of the data could be\nused directly – for example, contact information, tax documents and medical records (or\naccess to them through saved passwords). Other data could lead to indirect damage if\nexploited by cybercriminals.\n\nAside from the data that could be exposed, there’s also a risk that malware left on a device\ncould infect the new owner. We found malware on 17% of the devices we looked at.\n\nSellers need to consider what traces they might leave behind when they sell a device; and\nbuyers need to think about the security of any secondhand device they buy.\n\nThe UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) provides good practical advice for buyers\nand sellers.\n\n### Stalkerware during the pandemic\n\n[Stalkerware is commercially available software used to spy on another person via their](https://csr.kaspersky.com/en/antistalking/eng.html)\ndevice, without that person’s knowledge or consent. Stalkerware is the digital tip of a very\nreal-world iceberg. In a 2017 report, the European Institute for Gender Equality indicates that\nseven out of 10 women affected by online stalking have experienced physical violence at the\nhands of the perpetrator. The [Coalition Against Stalkerware defines stalkerware as software](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\nwhich “may facilitate intimate partner surveillance, harassment, abuse, stalking, and/or\nviolence”.\n\nThe number of people affected by stalkerware has been growing in recent years. We saw a\nfall in numbers in 2020, the drop-off coinciding with the worldwide lockdowns that came in\nthe wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is hardly surprising: since stalking is typically\ncarried out by someone the target lives with, if both abuser and target are housebound, there\nis less need to use technology to track someone’s activities. Notwithstanding the relative\ndecline, 53,870 is a big number. Moreover, these are numbers of Kaspersky customers: no\ndoubt the real figure is considerably higher.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most commonly detected stalkerware sample in 2020 was Monitor.AndroidOS.Nidb.a.\nThis app is re-sold under other names, so it is prominent in the market – iSpyoo,\nTheTruthSpy and Copy9 apps are all part of this family. Another popular application is\nCerberus, which is sold as anti-theft smartphone protection and hides itself to avoid notice.\nLike genuine phone-finding apps, Cerberus has access to geo-location, can take photos and\nscreenshots and record sound. Other high-ranking stalking apps include Track My Phone\n(which we detect as Agent.af), MobileTracker and Anlost.\n\n**Top 10 most detected stalkerware samples globally**\n\nSamples Affected users\n\n1 Monitor.AndroidOS.Nidb.a 8147\n\n2 Monitor.AndroidOS.Cerberus.a 5429\n\n3 Monitor.AndroidOS.Agent.af 2727\n\n4 Monitor.AndroidOS.Anlost.a 2234\n\n5 Monitor.AndroidOS.MobileTracker.c 2161\n\n6 Monitor.AndroidOS.PhoneSpy.b 1774\n\n\n-----\n\n7 Monitor.AndroidOS.Agent.hb 1463\n\n8 Monitor.AndroidOS.Cerberus.b 1310\n\n9 Monitor.AndroidOS.Reptilic.a 1302\n\n10 Monitor.AndroidOS.SecretCam.a 1124\n\nThe greatest number of stalkerware detections occurred in Russia, Brazil and the US.\n\n**Top 10 most affected countries by stalkerware – globally**\n\nCountry Affected users\n\n1 Russian Federation 12389\n\n2 Brazil 6523\n\n3 United States of America 4745\n\n4 India 4627\n\n5 Mexico 1570\n\n6 Germany 1547\n\n7 Iran 1345\n\n8 Italy 1144\n\n9 United Kingdom 1009\n\n10 Saudi Arabia 968\n\n[You can read our full report on the subject here.](https://securelist.com/the-state-of-stalkerware-in-2020/100875/)\n\nStalkerware operates stealthily, so it’s difficult for anyone targeted with such programs to see\nthat it’s installed on their device – they hide the app’s icon and remove other traces of their\npresence.\n\nKaspersky is actively working to end the use of stalkerware, not just by detecting it but by\nworking with partners. In 2019, Kaspersky and nine other founding members created\nthe [Coalition Against Stalkerware. Last year, we created TinyCheck, a free tool to detect](https://stopstalkerware.org/)\nstalkerware on mobile devices – specifically for service organizations working with people\nfacing domestic violence. We are one of five partners in an EU-wide project aimed at tackling\ngender-based cyber-violence and stalkerware called DeStalk, which the European\nCommission chose to support with its Rights, Equality and Citizenship Program.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Doxing in the corporate sector\n\n[When most people think of doxing, they tend to think it applies only to celebrities and other](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/doxxing/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nhigh-profile people. However, confidential corporate information is no less sensitive; and the\nfinancial and reputational impact resulting from the disclosure of such data means that any\norganization could become a victim of doxing. This is clear, for example, from the fact that\nseveral ransomware gangs now threaten to leak stolen corporate data to increase the\nlikelihood that their victims will pay up.\n\nCybercriminals use a variety of methods to gather confidential corporate information.\n\nOne of the easiest approaches is to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) – that is,\ngathering data from publicly accessible sources. The internet provides a lot of helpful\ninformation to would-be attackers, including the names and positions of employees, including\nthose who occupy key positions in the company: for example, the CEO, HR director and\nchief financial officer.\n\nInformation harvested from the online personal profiles of employees can be used to set up\n[BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks, in which an attacker initiates email](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/bec/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ncorrespondence with a member of staff by posing as a different employee (including their\nsuperior) or as a representative of a partner company. The attacker does this to gain the trust\nof the target before persuading them to perform certain actions, such as sending confidential\ndata or transferring funds to an account controlled by the attacker.\n\nBEC attacks can also be used to collect further information about the company, or to gain\naccess to valuable corporate data, or access to company resources – for example,\ncredentials allowing access to cloud-based systems.\n\nThere are various technical tricks that cybercriminals use to obtain information relevant to\n[their particular goals, including sending email messages containing a tracking pixel – often](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tracking-pixel-bec/36976/)\ndisguised as a “test” message.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis enables attackers to obtain data such as the time the email was opened, the version of\nthe recipient’s mail client and the IP address. This data lets the attackers build a profile on a\nspecific person who they can then impersonate in subsequent attacks.\n\nPhishing continues to be an effective way for attackers to gather corporate data. For\nexample, they may send an employee a message that mimics a notification from a business\nplatform such as SharePoint, which contains a link.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the employee clicks the link, they are redirected to a spoofed website containing a\nfraudulent form for entering their corporate account credentials – data which is captured by\nthe attackers.\n\nSometimes cybercriminals resort to phone phishing – either by calling an employee directly\nand trying to “phish” corporate information, or sending a message and asking them to call the\nnumber given in the message. One way to trick employees is to pose as IT support staff –\n[this method was used in the Twitter hack in July 2020.](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/Twitter_Report)\n\n\n-----\n\nBy obtaining employee credentials, they were able to target specific employees who\nhad access to our account support tools. They then targeted 130 Twitter accounts –\nTweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of\n7.\n\n— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) [July 31, 2020](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1289000208701878272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAttackers may not confine themselves to gathering publicly available data, but may also hack\nan employee’s account. This could be used to gain a foothold in the company, from which\nthey can extend their activities, or to circulate false information that could damage the\ncompany’s reputation and result in financial loss. There has even been a case where\ncybercriminals have obtained audio and video content of the CEO of an international\n[company and used deepfake technology to imitate the CEO’s voice, using it to persuade the](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/machine-learning-fake-voice/28870/)\nmanagement team of one of the company’s branches to transfer money to the scammers.\n\n[You can read our full report on doxing, including tips on how to protect yourself, here.](https://securelist.com/corporate-doxing/101513/)\n\n[Apple MacOS](https://securelist.com/tag/apple-macos/)\n[Doxing](https://securelist.com/tag/doxing/)\n[Google Android](https://securelist.com/tag/google-android/)\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Microsoft Windows](https://securelist.com/tag/microsoft-windows/)\n[Miner](https://securelist.com/tag/miner/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Stalkerware](https://securelist.com/tag/stalkerware/)\n[Sunburst](https://securelist.com/tag/sunburst/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[David Emm](https://securelist.com/author/davidemm/)\n\nIT threat evolution Q1 2021\n\nYour email address will not be published.
