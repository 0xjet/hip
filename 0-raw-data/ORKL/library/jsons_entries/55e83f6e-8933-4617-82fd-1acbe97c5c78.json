Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses**\n**associated with a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure. This alert**\n**contains indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware descriptions, network signatures, and host-based rules to help network defenders detect activity conducted by**\n**the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to the malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA.**\n\n**If users or administrators detect the custom tools indicative of HIDDEN COBRA, these tools should be immediately flagged, reported to the DHS National**\n**Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and given highest priority for enhanced mitigation. This alert**\n**identifies IP addresses linked to systems infected with DeltaCharlie malware and provides descriptions of the malware and associated malware signatures. DHS**\n**and FBI are distributing these IP addresses to enable network defense activities and reduce exposure to the DDoS command-and-control network. FBI has high**\n**confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses for further network exploitation.**\n\n**This alert includes technical indicators related to specific North Korean government cyber operations and provides suggested response actions to those indicators,**\n**recommended mitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents to the U.S. Government.**\n\n**For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:**\n\n**IOCs (.csv)**\n\n**IOCs (STIX)**\n\n#### Description\n\n**Since 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration**\n**[of data while others have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as Lazarus Group[1]](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Actor-Lazarus-Group-0bf5e50d24445f94d6b2d744dc6c63a2)** **and Guardians of Peace.** **[[2]](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/operation-blockbuster-unveils-the-actors-behind-the-sony-attacks)** **DHS and FB**\n**assess that HIDDEN COBRA actors will continue to use cyber operations to advance their government’s military and strategic objectives. Cyber analysts are**\n**encouraged to review the information provided in this alert to detect signs of malicious network activity.**\n\n**Tools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and**\n**[tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover,[3]](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/destover-destructive-malware-has-links-attacks-south-korea)** **[Wild Positron/Duuzer,[4]](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/duuzer-back-door-trojan-targets-south-korea-take-over-computers)** **[and Hangman.[5]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/09/zero-day_hwp_exploit.html)** **[DHS has previously released Alert TA14-353A, [6] which](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-353A)**\n**contains additional details on the use of a server message block (SMB) worm tool employed by these actors. Further research is needed to understand the full**\n**breadth of this group’s cyber capabilities. In particular, DHS recommends that more research should be conducted on the North Korean cyber activity that has been**\n**reported by cybersecurity and threat research firms.**\n\n**HIDDEN COBRA actors commonly target systems running older, unsupported versions of Microsoft operating systems. The multiple vulnerabilities in these older**\n**systems provide cyber actors many targets for exploitation. These actors have also used Adobe Flash player vulnerabilities to gain initial entry into users’**\n**environments.**\n\n**HIDDEN COBRA is known to use vulnerabilities affecting various applications. These vulnerabilities include:**\n\n**CVE-2015-6585: Hangul Word Processor Vulnerability**\n\n**CVE-2015-8651: Adobe Flash Player 18.0.0.324 and 19.x Vulnerability**\n\n**CVE-2016-0034: Microsoft Silverlight 5.1.41212.0 Vulnerability**\n\n**CVE-2016-1019: Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.197 Vulnerability**\n\n**CVE-2016-4117: Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.226 Vulnerability**\n\n**We recommend that organizations upgrade these applications to the latest version and patch level. If Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight is no longer required, we**\n**recommend that those applications be removed from systems.**\n\n**The indicators provided with this alert include IP addresses determined to be part of the HIDDEN COBRA botnet infrastructure, identified as DeltaCharlie. The**\n**[DeltaCharlie DDoS bot was originally reported by Novetta in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report.[7]](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf)** **This malware has used the IP addresses**\n**identified in the accompanying .csv and .stix files as both source and destination IPs. In some instances, the malware may have been present on victims’ networks**\n**for a significant period.**\n\n#### Technical Details\n\n\n-----\n\n**executables, changing its own configuration, updating its own binaries, terminating its own processes, and activating and terminating denial-of-service attacks.**\n**Further details on the malware can be found in Novetta’s report.**\n\n#### Detection and Response\n\n**HIDDEN COBRA IOCs related to DeltaCharlie are provided within the accompanying .csv and .stix files of this alert. DHS and FBI recommend that network**\n**administrators review the IP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules provided, and add the IPs to their watchlist to determine whether malicious**\n**activity has been observed within their organization.**\n\n**When reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find numerous instances of these IP addresses attempting to connect to their**\n**systems. Upon reviewing the traffic from these IP addresses, system owners may find that some traffic corresponds to malicious activity and some to legitimate**\n**activity. System owners are also advised to run the YARA tool on any system they suspect to have been targeted by HIDDEN COBRA actors. Additionally, the**\n**appendices of this report provide network signatures to aid in the detection and mitigation of HIDDEN COBRA activity.**\n\n#### Network Signatures and Host-Based Rules\n\n**This section contains network signatures and host-based rules that can be used to detect malicious activity associated with HIDDEN COBRA actors. Although**\n**created using a comprehensive vetting process, the possibility of false positives always remains. These signatures and rules should be used to supplement**\n**analysis and should not be used as a sole source of attributing this activity to HIDDEN COBRA actors.**\n\n#### Network Signatures\n\n**alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"DPRK_HIDDEN_COBRA_DDoS_HANDSHAKE_SUCCESS\"; dsize:6; flow:established,to_server; content:\"|18 17 e9 e9 e9 e9|\";**\n**fast_pattern:only; sid:1; rev:1;)**\n\n**________________________________________________________________**\n\n**alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"DPRK_HIDDEN_COBRA_Botnet_C2_Host_Beacon\"; flow:established,to_server; content:\"|1b 17 e9 e9 e9 e9|\"; depth:6;**\n**fast_pattern; sid:1; rev:1;)**\n\n**________________________________________________________________**\n\n#### YARA Rules\n\n**\"strings:**\n\n**$rsaKey = {7B 4E 1E A7 E9 3F 36 4C DE F4 F0 99 C4 D9 B7 94**\n\n**A1 FF F2 97 D3 91 13 9D C0 12 02 E4 4C BB 6C 77**\n\n**48 EE 6F 4B 9B 53 60 98 45 A5 28 65 8A 0B F8 39**\n\n**73 D7 1A 44 13 B3 6A BB 61 44 AF 31 47 E7 87 C2**\n\n**AE 7A A7 2C 3A D9 5C 2E 42 1A A6 78 FE 2C AD ED**\n\n**39 3F FA D0 AD 3D D9 C5 3D 28 EF 3D 67 B1 E0 68**\n\n**3F 58 A0 19 27 CC 27 C9 E8 D8 1E 7E EE 91 DD 13**\n\n**B3 47 EF 57 1A CA FF 9A 60 E0 64 08 AA E2 92 D0}**\n\n**condition: any of them\"**\n\n**________________________________________________________________**\n\n**\"strings:**\n\n**$STR1 = \"Wating\" wide ascii**\n\n**$STR2 = \"Reamin\" wide ascii**\n\n**$STR3 = \"laptos\" wide ascii**\n\n**condition: (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D or uint16(0) == 0xCFD0 or uint16(0) == 0xC3D4 or uint32(0) == 0x46445025 or uint32(1) == 0x6674725C) and 2 of them}\"**\n\n**________________________________________________________________**\n\n**\"strings:**\n\n**$randomUrlBuilder = { 83 EC 48 53 55 56 57 8B 3D ?? ?? ?? ?? 33 C0 C7 44 24 28 B4 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 2C B0 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 30 AC 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 34**\n**A8 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 38 A4 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 3C A0 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 40 9C 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 44 94 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 48 8C 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 4C 88 6F**\n**41 00 C7 44 24 50 80 6F 41 00 89 44 24 54 C7 44 24 10 7C 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 14 78 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 18 74 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 1C 70 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 20 6C**\n**6F 41 00 89 44 24 24 FF D7 99 B9 0B 00 00 00 F7 F9 8B 74 94 28 BA 9C 6F 41 00 66 8B 06 66 3B 02 74 34 8B FE 83 C9 FF 33 C0 8B 54 24 60 F2 AE 8B 6C 24**\n**5C A1 ?? ?? ?? ??

The**\n**mitigation strategies provided may seem like common sense. However, many organizations fail to use these basic security measures, leaving their systems open to**\n**compromise:**\n\n**1.** **Patch applications and operating systems – Most attackers target vulnerable applications and operating systems. Ensuring that applications and operating**\n\n**systems are patched with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker. Use best practices when updating**\n**software and patches by only downloading updates from authenticated vendor sites.**\n\n**2.** **Use application whitelisting – Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies because it allows only specified programs to run while blocking all others,**\n\n**including malicious software.**\n\n**3.** **Restrict administrative privileges – Threat actors are increasingly focused on gaining control of legitimate credentials, especially credentials associated with**\n\n**highly privileged accounts. Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user’s duties. Separate administrators into privilege tiers with limited access to other**\n**tiers.**\n\n**4.** **Segment networks and segregate them into security zones – Segment networks into logical enclaves and restrict host-to-host communications paths. This**\n\n**helps protect sensitive information and critical services, and limits damage from network perimeter breaches.**\n\n**5.** **Validate input – Input validation is a method of sanitizing untrusted input provided by users of a web application. Implementing input validation can protect**\n\n**against the security flaws of web applications by significantly reducing the probability of successful exploitation. Types of attacks possibly averted include**\n**Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection.**\n\n**6.** **Use stringent file reputation settings – Tune the file reputation systems of your anti-virus software to the most aggressive setting possible. Some anti-virus**\n\n**products can limit execution to only the highest reputation files, stopping a wide range of untrustworthy code from gaining control.**\n\n**7.** **Understand firewalls – Firewalls provide security to make your network less susceptible to attack. They can be configured to block data and applications from**\n\n**certain locations (IP whitelisting), while allowing relevant and necessary data through.**\n\n#### Response to Unauthorized Network Access\n\n**Enforce your security incident response and business continuity plan. It may take time for your organization’s IT professionals to isolate and remove threats to**\n**your systems and restore normal operations. Meanwhile, you should take steps to maintain your organization’s essential functions according to your business**\n**continuity plan. Organizations should maintain and regularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business continuity procedures.**\n\n**Contact DHS or your local FBI office immediately. To report an intrusion and request resources for incident response or technical assistant, you are encouraged**\n**to contact DHS NCCIC (NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870), the FBI through a local field office, or the FBI’s Cyber Division (CyWatch@fbi.gov**\n**or 855-292-3937).**\n\n#### Protect Against SQL Injection and Other Attacks on Web Services\n\n**To protect against code injections and other attacks, system operators should routinely evaluate known and published vulnerabilities, periodically perform software**\n**updates and technology refreshes, and audit external-facing systems for known web application vulnerabilities. They should also take the following steps to harden**\n**both web applications and the servers hosting them to reduce the risk of network intrusion via this vector.**\n\n**Use and configure available firewalls to block attacks.**\n\n**Take steps to secure Windows systems, such as installing and configuring Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and Microsoft**\n**AppLocker.**\n\n**Monitor and remove any unauthorized code present in any www directories.**\n\n**Disable, discontinue, or disallow the use of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as much as**\n**possible.**\n\n**Remove unnecessary HTTP verbs from web servers. Typical web servers and applications only require GET, POST, and HEAD.**\n\n**Where possible, minimize server fingerprinting by configuring web servers to avoid responding with banners identifying the server software and version**\n**number.**\n\n**Secure both the operating system and the application.**\n\n**Update and patch production servers regularly.**\n\n**Disable potentially harmful SQL-stored procedure calls.**\n\n**Sanitize and validate input to ensure that it is properly typed and does not contain escaped code.**\n\n**Consider using type-safe stored procedures and prepared statements.**\n\n**Audit transaction logs regularly for suspicious activity.**\n\n**Perform penetration testing on web services.**\n\n**Ensure error messages are generic and do not expose too much information.**\n\n#### Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls\n\n**System operators should take the following steps to limit permissions, privileges, and access controls.**\n\n**Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user’s duties.**\n\n**Restrict users’ ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications, and apply the principle of “Least Privilege” to all systems and services.**\n**Restricting these privileges may prevent malware from running or limit its capability to spread through the network.**\n\n**Carefully consider the risks before granting administrative rights to users on their own machines.**\n\n**Scrub and verify all administrator accounts regularly.**\n\n**Configure Group Policy to restrict all users to only one login session, where possible.**\n\n**Enforce secure network authentication, where possible.**\n\n**Instruct administrators to use non-privileged accounts for standard functions such as web browsing or checking webmail.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**as when tunneled through a secondary virtual private network (VPN) with lower privileges.**\n\n**Audit existing firewall rules and close all ports that are not explicitly needed for business. Specifically, carefully consider which ports should be connecting**\n**outbound versus inbound.**\n\n**Enforce a strict lockout policy for network users and closely monitor logs for failed login activity. Failed login activity can be indicative of failed intrusion**\n**activity.**\n\n**If remote access between zones is an unavoidable business need, log and monitor these connections closely.**\n\n**In environments with a high risk of interception or intrusion, organizations should consider supplementing password authentication with other forms of**\n**authentication such as challenge/response or multifactor authentication using biometric or physical tokens.**\n\n#### Logging Practices\n\n**System operators should follow these secure logging practices.**\n\n**Ensure event logging, including applications, events, login activities, and security attributes, is turned on or monitored for identification of security issues.**\n\n**Configure network logs to provide adequate information to assist in quickly developing an accurate determination of a security incident.**\n\n**Upgrade PowerShell to new versions with enhanced logging features and monitor the logs to detect usage of PowerShell commands, which are often**\n**malware-related.**\n\n**Secure logs in a centralized location and protect them from modification.**\n\n**Prepare an incident response plan that can be rapidly administered in case of a cyber intrusion.**\n\n#### References\n\n**[[1] IBM.
