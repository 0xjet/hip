There have been far more malicious files, but they are either not identified or a\nduplicate by file hash and thus not reported here. Also, if a malware campaign consisted of\nlinks to downloads, they are also not included in this list.\n\n[The vast majority (over 50%) is being identified as malware family “AgentTesla” by](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.agent_tesla)\n[MalwareBazaar signatures.](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/)\n\n**Malware** **Count**\n\nAgentTesla 120\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware** **Count**\n\nHeodo 23\n\nLoki 11\n\nDridex 7\n\nFormbook 7\n\nRemcosRAT 7\n\nMassLogger 6\n\nNanoCore 6\n\nNetWire 6\n\nAZORult 5\n\nTop 10 malware families observed in October 2020\n\nThe largest sector receiving those emails is legal services. That is something I have\nobserved for a while and now I got the data set that clearly confirms my assumption.\n\nThe top 10 sectors in my spam trap targeted by malware this month are:\n\n**Sector** **Count**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sector** **Count**\n\nlegal 137\n\nelectronics / import 21\n\nnon-profit 13\n\nfree service 12\n\nbanking 7\n\nelectronics 7\n\nnewspaper 5\n\nrecruitment 3\n\nsport marketing 3\n\nadvertising agencies 2\n\nTop 10 sectors receiving malicious email attachments\nAlso interesting observation, legal services are mostly targeted by “AgentTesla” malware,\n[followed by “Loki” and “Formbook” and “NetWire“. All tools used to steal sensitive](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.lokipws)\ninformation and documents or remotely control an infected computer.\n\nIf you have any questions, please post a comment or send me a message on Twitter\n[@cocaman.](https://twitter.com/cocaman)\n\n\n-----",
