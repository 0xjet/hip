As part of these efforts,\n[we recently came across a new variant of the Win32/Troldesh ransomware family.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Win32/Troldesh)\n\nRansomware, like most malware, is constantly trying to change itself in an attempt to evade\ndetection. In this case, we’ve seen the following updates to Troldesh:\n\nTor functionality\nGlyph/symbol errors on the wallpaper ransom note\nModified extension names for encrypted files\n[New malware being delivered (Trojan:Win32/Mexar.A)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Trojan:Win32/Mexar.A)\nUpdates the ransom note to cover the Tor functionality\n\nThe biggest change in this update is the addition of Tor links. Using Tor addresses as the\nransom payment method (as opposed to standard www addresses) is the current fashion\namong ransomware.\n\nThe ransom note now includes links to the Tor address (previously, the only method provided\nfor obtaining decryption was an email address):\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, upon investigation it appears that Tor has blocked the address:\n\n\n-----\n\nErrors have been introduced into the image that replaces the user’s desktop wallpaper (this\noccurred to several samples, but not all):\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter encryption, Troldesh changes the file’s extension. In the latest update, we’ve seen it\nuse the following strings:\n\n.da_vinci_code\n.magic_software_syndicate\n\nFor example, an encrypted file might appear as follows:\n\n[The list of file types that Troldesh encrypts has also increased – see the Win32/Troldesh](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Win32/Troldesh)\ndescription for a full list.\n\n## Prevention\n\nTo help stay protected:\n\n[Keep your Windows Operating System and antivirus up-to-date and, if you haven’t](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/help/updatesoftware.aspx)\n[already, upgrade to Windows 10.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade)\n\n\n-----\n\nRegularly back-up your files in an external hard-drive\nEnable file history or system protection.
