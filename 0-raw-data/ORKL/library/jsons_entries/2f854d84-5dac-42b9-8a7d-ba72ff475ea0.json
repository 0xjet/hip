The\nBahamut group was involved in various phishing campaigns that were delivering malware targeting the\nMiddle East and South Asia.\n\nCyble Research Labs has been closely monitoring the activities of the Bahamut group. In August 2021,\n[Cyble released a blog on Bahamut Android Spyware, distributed through a phishing campaign](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/08/10/bahamut-threat-group-targeting-users-through-phishing-campaign/)\nimpersonating Jamaat official sites.\n\nThe Bahamut group plans their attack on the target, stays in the wild for a while, allows their attack to affect\nmany individuals and organizations, and finally steals their data.\n\nAfter their previous attack, the Threat Actors (TAs) behind Bahamut stayed silent for about a year and came\nback with a new strategy for their current campaign. The group has continuously kept changing its mode of\nattack, and in the past few years, it is increasingly shifting its focus to targeting mobile devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n[During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a Twitter post wherein a](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1540332848577667073)\nresearcher mentioned a variant of Android malware, which is Bahamut Android Spyware.\n\n[After about a year of silence, a new variant of Bahamut Android malware was spotted in the wild in April](https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1513817059242622978)\n2022, being distributed via phishing sites. The phishing sites were masked as genuine websites for\ndownloading a messaging application that provides secure communication.\n\n_Figure 1 – Phishing site which distributes malware_\nThe phishing site is well-designed and looks professional. The TA has also mentioned the features provided\nby the application, the Contact Us page, and the Subscribe page, as shown in the below figure. The TAs\nadded these features to the site to make it appear more genuine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Features listed on phishing sites to look legitimate_\nThis indicates that the TA has invested time in developing a well-designed phishing website to attract the\nvictim to download the malware.\n\nAlong with the secure chat phishing website, we have observed that Bahamut Spyware is being distributed\nthrough obscene sites “hxxps://www[.]iminglechat[.]de”.\n\nWhile comparing the old and new variants of Bahamut Android Spyware, we observed that the TA has\nmodified their code in the new variant and added extra modules specifically targeting messaging\napplications such as Viber, Imo, Signal, Telegram, and many more, wherein the old variant of the malicious\napp was collecting only Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as contacts, SMS data, call logs, etc.\n\nThe below image showcases the comparison and the extra module added to collect information from\ndifferent messaging apps.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 – Comparison of the old and new variants of Bahamut_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**APK Metadata Information**\n\nApp Name: Chat Services\nPackage Name: com.chat.services\nSHA256 Hash: 1084b7ff4758b5d13dcfc4f9167b16e6b834bfff2032b540e74959ceb18a5b1e\n\nFigure 4 shows the metadata information of the application.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – App Metadata Information_\n**Manifest Description**\n\nThe malicious application mentions 24 permissions, of which the TA exploits 9. The harmful permissions\nrequested by the malware are:\n\n**Permission** **Description**\n\n**CAMERA** Required to access the camera device.\n\n**READ_SMS** Access phone messages\n\n**RECORD_AUDIO** Allows the app to record audio with the microphone, which the\nattackers can misuse\n\n**READ_CONTACTS** Access phone contacts\n\n**READ_CALL_LOG** Access phone call logs\n\n**READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** Allows the app to read the contents of the device’s external storage\n\n**RECEIVE_SMS** Allows an application to receive SMS messages\n\n**WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** Allows the app to write or delete files to the external storage of the\ndevice\n\n**SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW** Allows the app to draw on top of other applications\n\n**Source Code Review**\n\nInstalling the malware prompts the user to enable a few permissions and Accessibility Service. Once the\nvictim grants these permissions, the malware abuses the Accessibility Service to fetch data from the\ntargeted messaging applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – Accessibility Service_\nThe malware then checks for the targeted application’s package name. It uses the Accessibility API to fetch\ntext from the current screen and stores it in a local database, as shown below.\n\n_Figure 6 – Fetching data from the targeted applications_\nBelow is the list of messaging applications targeted by the malware to collect the data:\n\ncom.viber.voip\ncom.protectedtext.android\ncom.facebook.orca\ncom.imo.android.imoim\norg.telegram.messenger\ncom.whatsapp\ncom.secapp.tor.conion\norg.thoughtcrime.securesms\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter collecting data from these messaging apps, the malware sends the stolen data to Command and\nControl (C&C) server. The code present in the below image depicts the same.\n\n_Figure 7 – Malware sending stolen information to the C&C server_\nAlong with collecting the data from messaging applications, the malware executes the below spyware\nactivities:\n\nCollects contact information: The malware steals the contact data saved on the victim’s device and\nsends it to the C&C server.\n\n_Figure 8 – Malware collecting contact data_\n\nCollects SMS and call log data: The malware has a code to collect the SMS and call log information\nfrom the victim’s device.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – Collecting SMS and call log information_\n\nCollects files and basic device information: The malware collects the local files stored on the victim’s\ndevice along with the basic information about the device such as model, device ID, version, SIM\noperator, etc.\n\n_Figure 10 – Collecting files and basic device information_\nThe figure below shows the C&C server and endpoints used by the malware to send the stolen data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 – C&C server and endpoints_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRecently many malware families and APT groups have been observed in the wild attacking specific targets\nand performing malicious activities, then disappearing for some time. Bahamut malware follows the same\ncybercrime footprint.\n\nBahamut malware was initially observed last year with sophisticated spying capabilities, and interestingly, it\nhas reappeared with new additional code which collects messaging applications data used by the victim.\nThe agenda behind the malware distribution is very clear – to spy on the targeted entity.\n\nOver the next few years, we may observe a change in the activities of the Bahamut APT group, with\ndifferent targets, enhanced techniques, and distribution modes.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n**How to prevent malware infection?**\n\nDownload and install software only from official app stores like Play Store or the iOS App Store.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as\nPCs, laptops, and mobile devices.\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nEnable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile\ndevice where possible.\nBe wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.\nEnsure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.\nBe careful while enabling any permissions.\nKeep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.\n\n**How to identify whether you are infected?**\n\nRegularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices.\nKeep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions\naccordingly.\n\n**What to do when you are infected?**\n\n\n-----\n\nDisable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the\nMobile Data.\nPerform a factory reset.\nRemove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.\nTake a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.\n\n**What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?**\n\nIn case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.\n\n**What should banks do to protect their customers?**\n\nBanks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from\nmalware attacks via telephone, SMS, or emails.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n**Initial Access** [T1476](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1476/) Deliver Malicious App via Other Mean.\n\n**Collection** [T1412](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412) Capture SMS Messages\n\n**Collection** [T1432](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1432/) Access Contacts List\n\n**Collection** [T1433](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1433/) Access Call Logs\n\n**Collection** [T1517](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1517/) Access Notifications\n\n**Collection** [T1533](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1533/) Data from Local System\n\n**Collection** [T1429](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1429/) Capture Audio\n\n**Command and Control** [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) Non-Standard Port\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n**1084b7ff4758b5d13dcfc4f9167b16e6b834bfff2032b540e74959ceb18a5b1e** SHA256 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**44b7cd8d1078a619356d5408bcf9d325d246ec26** SHA1 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**45fa889f3524683b030db4ad3d43de63** MD5 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**hxxps://gkcx6ye4t4zafw8ju2xdr5na5[.]de** URL C&C server\n\n**d11451503cbd5d0283450316289b0d6027033647cb92dd7bbce1e4d62b186697** SHA256 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n\n-----\n\n**db2b2d2d43064b2a5300c811d635dbf673599b0c** SHA1 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**eaa3b40142cad5b3a8426e2e0179b111** MD5 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**hxxps://5iw68rugwfcir37uj8z3r6rfaxwd8g8cdcfcqw62[.]de** URL C&C server\n\n**hxxps://www[.]securechatnow[.]com/** URL Malware\ndistribution\nsite\n\n**hxxps://www[.]iminglechat[.]de** URL Malware\ndistribution\nsite\n\n**5cd30ccebdd87fb1ea8f3a8995fc81b5b78e17ccc0f145703b5bd4da1ec22e66** SHA256 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**fb63cfb371dbb79fde2f2b2835bb0edba4b5e5a6** SHA1 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n**f4bfbcce73cd11051fc259a7811d2245** MD5 Hash of the\nanalyzed\nAPK file\n\n\n-----",
