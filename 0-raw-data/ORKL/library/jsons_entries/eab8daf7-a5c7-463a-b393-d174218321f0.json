In 2019, it launched multiple parallel cyber espionage campaigns,\nfrom large-scale credential harvesting to narrowly targeted espionage and exfiltration\noperations.\n\nThe foundations for this activity began in August 2018, when we observed Black Banshee\nsetting up a substantial number of domains impersonating organisations across the\ngovernment, academia, and policy sectors. This formed the basis for multiple spear-phishing\nand credential harvesting campaigns.\n\nIn tracking Black Banshee, we have identified a number of highly characteristic elements of\nthe threat actor’s tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In the two parts of this\nretrospective look at Black Banshee’s 2019 activity, we will:\n\n\n-----\n\nExamine the overlaps in Black Banshee s infrastructure and modus operandi that have\nallowed us to connect multiple strands of its operations more clearly than detailed so\nfar in open source;\nConnect its 2019 campaigns, linking to activity dating back to late 2018; and,\nHighlight how it has operated to achieve certain strategic objectives.\n\n## Tradecraft: most used domains and naming conventions\n\n### Infrastructure connections: IP addresses\n\nFirstly, let us dive into Black Banshee’s mannerisms in setting up its infrastructure. Across\n2019, it was possible to tie together different Black Banshee campaigns through the IP\naddresses used. For example, on numerous occasions command and control domains for\nBlack Banshee malware resolved to IP addresses in following ranges - 185.224.137[.]0/23\nand 185.224.138[.]0/23\n\nThe address 185.224.137[.]164, for one, has been used since at least December 2018 and\nup to January 2020 to serve at least 24 malicious Black Banshee domains, including (but not\nlimited to):\n\nuser-daum-centre[.]pe[.]hu (from 2019-04-15 to 2019-05-21);\n\nrrnaver[.]com (from 2019-08-21 to 2020-01-01); and,\n\nnortice-centre[.]esy[.]es (from 2020-01-02 to 2020-01-28).\n\nIt also hosted, between June and November 2019, the domain kakao-check[.]esy[.]es, which\nserved as command and control (C2) for a sample of a new malware family that we call\nMyDogs – a RAT thought to be unique to Black Banshee, and which was first reported on in\nopen source by AhnLab as part of its analysis on Operation Red Salt.1\n\nFigure 1. 185.224.137[.]164 is an example of an IP that has hosted numerous Black\nBanshee domains – associated with different campaigns – throughout 2019 and into 2020.\nSome of these domains are shown here.\n\n### Infrastructure connections: domains\n\nAmong the domains used by Black Banshee, a few stood out for frequency across its\ncampaigns.\n\n\npe[.]hu - numerous subdomains on this domain were used in Operation Kabar Cobra,\nOperation Kitty Phishing, and Operation WildCommand; additional subdomains were\nlisted in a Financial Security Institute VirusBulletin report detailing the tradecraft of\nnumerous operations attributed to Black Banshee;2\n\n\n-----\n\nhol[.]es - subdomains on this domain were used for both the WildCommand cluster and\nOperation MoneyHolic. Incidentally, some of the malware involved in Operation\nMoneyHolic were samples of MyDogs malware, which was also used in Operation Red\nSalt;\nesy[.]es - subdomains on esy[.]es further strengthen the connections in infrastructure\nsetup between the WildCommand cluster and Operation MoneyHolic, as well as\noverlaps with the infrastructure used for MyDogs malware used in Operation Red Salt;\nand,\n890m[.]com - subdomains on 890m[.]com were implicated in the WildCommand cluster,\nas well as in activity using KONNI that had ties to Black Banshee,3 and in other Black\nBanshee activity.\n\nWhile these domains are available for anyone to use, and not all of their subdomains are\nmalicious, Black Banshee used subdomains on these domains multiple times across different\noperations. Other North Korea-based threat actors, especially APT37/Reaper, have also\nmade use of some of the same domains (such as hol[.]es,4 890m[.]com )5 throughout 2019.\n\nFigure 2. A high-level overview of some of the connections between different 2019 Black\nBanshee campaigns.\n\n### Infrastructure connections: naming\n\nEven where the subdomains’ parent domain was not the same, our analysts noticed a\npattern of naming in adversary-registered infrastructure. We saw Black Banshee go down\nthree main routes for domain naming:\n\n1. Naming highly specific to an organisation or institution being targeted or impersonated\n\n(and often used for credential phishing);\n\n2. Keywords referring to software used specifically in South Korea, often combined with\n\nmore generic, office- or enterprise-related themes; and,\n\n3. Seemingly generic names, including ones impersonating email services, or domains\n\nwith similar or incremental numbering.\n\nBlack Banshee was also consistent in the setting up of command and control server-side\nfolders:\n\n“/Est/up” and “/Est/down” were server-side paths seen in Operation Kabar Cobra,\nOperation Kitty Phishing, and Operation WildCommand – folders to stage files\nuploaded or downloaded by infected machines. We observed a similar server-side path\n(http://nortice-centre[.]esy[.]es/down/) being referred to by a new sample of a Black\nBanshee Windows Script File downloader first seen on 31 December 2019; this likely\nindicates that the threat actor is maintaining a consistent approach to infrastructure\nmanagement and naming.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe server-side path /bbs/data/temp was observed in both Operation Kabar Cobra\nand Operation Kitty Phishing.\nIts parent path, “/bbs/data”, was observed in the context of Operation Red Salt, with\none of the sub-folders associated with malware that was later tied by ESTSecurity to\nKONNI. Additionally, the same path was also observed on APT37/Reaper command\nand control servers.6\nFinally, “/bbs/filter” was present on a C2 for MyDogs malware related to Operation Red\nSalt.\n\n## In Summary\n\nIn tracking North Korea-based threat actor Black Banshee (also known as Kimsuky), we\nobserved the threat actor display a series of infrastructure set-up habits. These included the\nuse of specific IP ranges to set up actor-controlled command and control domains, the\nnaming conventions used for such domains, and server-side folder names consistently\nreused by Black Banshee across its C2s.\n\nSuch habits and TTPs effectively allowed us to connect multiple campaigns through direct\nlinks and similarities in command and control infrastructure.\n\nBut that’s not all. Having connected multiple Black Banshee’s operations across 2019, we\nobserved that distinct “clusters” of activity appeared – groups of campaigns and operations\ntied together by infrastructure links, similar tradecraft, shared indicators, and matching\ntargeting.\n\nIn an upcoming blog, we will detail the connections between campaigns found across these\nclusters and offer strategic insight about their coherence in terms of TTPs and objectives.\n\n[1.2.O3.4.
