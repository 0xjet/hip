The event has been documented in Court\nproceedings, a Maroochy Water Services presentation, and other documentation available\nin the public domain. The event was an intentional, targeted attack by a knowledgeable\nperson on an industrial control system. The case study examines the event from a cyber\nsecurity perspective. It provides the timelines and cyber issues, examines the NIST\nSP800-53 controls that were violated or not met, and posits the potential mitigation that\nwould have occurred if the NIST SP800-53 controls had been followed. The intent of\nthis analysis is not to criticize any actions taken, but to look forward as to how lessons\nlearned from this case can be of help to prevent future incidents.\n\n# Attack Overview\nVitek Boden, a man in his late 40s, worked for Hunter Watertech, an Australian firm that\ninstalled SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) radio-controlled sewage\nequipment for the Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, Australia. Boden applied for\na job with the Maroochy Shire Council, apparently after he walked away from a “strained\nrelationship” with Hunter Watertech. The Council decided not to hire him.\nConsequently, Boden decided to get even with both the Council and his former employer.\nHe packed his car with stolen radio equipment attached to a (possibly stolen) computer.\nHe drove around the area on at least 46 occasions from February 28 to April 23, 2000,\nissuing radio commands to the sewage equipment he (probably) helped install. Boden\ncaused 800,000 liters of raw sewage to spill out into local parks, rivers and even the\ngrounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel. \"Marine life died, the creek water turned black and\nthe stench was unbearable for residents,\" said a representative of the Australian\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.[2] Boden coincidentally got caught when a policeman\npulled him over for a traffic violation after one of his attacks. A judge sentenced him to\ntwo years in jail and ordered him to reimburse the Council for cleanup. Boden's attack\nbecame the first widely known example of someone maliciously breaking into a control\nsystem. There are a few other reports of this attack.

The intent of this analysis is not to criticize any actions taken, but\nto look forward as to how lessons learned from this case can be of help to prevent future\nincidents.\n\nThe Maroochy Shire attack has been documented in the Crown criminal case[5][.] The\noffences occurred between 9 February 2000 and 23 April 2000 when Vitek Boden\naccessed computers controlling the Maroochy Shire Council’s sewerage system and\naltered electronic data in the sewerage pumping stations causing malfunctions in their\noperations.\n\n## NIST Special Publication 800-53 and Related Documents\nNIST has established an Industrial Control System (ICS) Security Project[6] to improve the\nsecurity of public and private sector ICS. NIST SP 800-53 revision 2, December 2007,\n_Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, provides_\nimplementing guidance and detail in the context of two mandatory Federal Information\nProcessing Standards (FIPS) that apply to all federal information and information\nsystems, including ICSs. FIPS 200 requires that federal agencies implement minimum\nsecurity controls for their organizational information systems based on the FIPS 199\nsecurity categorization of those systems. Private sector and other organizations may\nconsider the use of these standards and guidelines as appropriate. NIST is working with\nall stakeholders and other interested parties to develop convergent guidance on the\napplication of these security requirements to ICS.\n\nRevision 2 of SP 800-53 incorporates guidance on appropriate safeguards and\ncountermeasures for federal ICS, that is also potentially applicable and useful for the\nprivate sector. NIST’s Computer Security Division (Information Technology\nLaboratory) and Intelligent Systems Division (Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory),\nin collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security and organizations within the\nfederal government that own, operate, and maintain industrial control systems, developed\nthe necessary ICS augmentations and interpretations for the security controls, control\nenhancements, and supplemental guidance in SP 800-53. The ICS augmentations and\ninterpretations will facilitate the employment of appropriate safeguards and\n\n4 http://www2.theiet.org/OnComms/sector/computing/Library.cfm?ObjectID=0482B3C1-D0B1-80C657EA91E4FB429C23\n\n5 Supreme Court of Queensland r v Boden, Vitek 2002, CA Number 324 of 2001 DC Number 340 of 2001.\nhttp://www.courts.qld.gov.au/qjudgment/QCA%202002/QCA02-164.pdf.\n\n6 NIST Industrial Control System Security Project, http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert/ics/index.html\n\n\n-----\n\ncountermeasures for these specialized information systems that are part of the critical\ninfrastructure of the United States.\n\nIn developing the ICS augmentations and interpretations, the original set of controls,\nenhancements, and supplemental guidance contained in Appendix F in SP 800-53 were\nnot changed. ICS Supplemental Guidance provides additional guidance on how to apply\na control in ICS environments. ICS Enhancements are enhancement augmentations to\nthe controls that are required for some ICS. ICS Enhancement Supplemental Guidance\nprovides guidance on how to apply an enhancement in ICS environments.\n\nFIPS Publication 199 provides standards for categorizing information and information\nsystems based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur\nwhich jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to\naccomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities,\nmaintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Categorization of an\ninformation system must take into consideration potential impacts to other organizations\nand, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security\nPresidential Directives, potential national-level impacts.\n\nThe security controls specified in SP 800-53 are organized into classes and families for\nease of use in the control selection and specification process. There are three general\nclasses of security controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical) and seventeen\nsecurity control families.[7] Each family contains security controls related to the security\nfunctionality of the family. A two-character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify\neach control family. Table 1 summarizes the classes and families in the security control\ncatalog and the associated family identifiers. A list of the minimum security controls, or\nsecurity control baselines, for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information\nsystems, as determined by applying the criteria in FIPS 199 have been published\nseparately: LOW-impact baseline at sp800-53-rev2-annex1.pdf; MODERATE-impact\nbaseline at sp800-53-rev2-annex2.pdf; and HIGH-impact baseline at sp800-53-rev2annex3.pdf. These are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex1.pdf, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex2.pdf, and http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53Rev2/sp800-53-rev2-annex3.pdf, respectively.\n\n7 The seventeen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are closely aligned with the seventeen\nsecurity-related areas in FIPS 200 specifying the minimum security requirements for protecting federal information and\ninformation systems. Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the dominant characteristics of the\ncontrols in that family. Many security controls, however, can be logically associated with more than one class. For\nexample, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational\ncontrol but also has characteristics that are consistent with security management as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TABLE 1: SECURITY CONTROL CLASSES, FAMILIES, AND IDENTIFIERS**\n\n**IDENTIFIER** **FAMILY** **CLASS**\n\nAC Access Control Technical\nAT Awareness and Training Operational\nAU Audit and Accountability Technical\nCA Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments Management\nCM Configuration Management Operational\nCP Contingency Planning Operational\nIA Identification and Authentication Technical\nIR Incident Response Operational\nMA Maintenance Operational\nMP Media Protection Operational\nPE Physical and Environmental Protection Operational\nPL Planning Management\nPS Personnel Security Operational\nRA Risk Assessment Management\nSA System and Services Acquisition Management\nSC System and Communications Protection Technical\nSI System and Information Integrity Operational\n\n## Maroochy Shire Site Description\nMaroochy Shire, a rural area of great natural beauty and a tourist destination, is located\nabout 100 kilometers north of the Queensland State Capital of Brisbane. It has an area of\napproximately 1,157 square kilometers with a population of approximately 120,000.\nMaroochy Shire has 880 kilometers of gravity sewers treating an average of 35 million\nliters/day. Maroochy Water Services Sewerage SCADA System consists of 142 Sewage\nPumping Stations with two Monitoring Computers utilizing three Radio Frequencies.\nHunter Watertech Pty Ltd installed the “PDS Compact 500” computer device at each\npumping station capable of receiving instructions from a central control center,\ntransmitting alarm signals and other data to the central computer and providing messages\nto stop and start the pumps at the pumping station. Communications between pumping\nstations and between a pumping station and the central computer were by means of a\ndedicated analog two-way radio system operating through repeater stations. Each\nrepeater station transmitted on a different frequency.\n\n# The Attack \nThe offences occurred between February 9, 2000 and April 23, 2000. Vitek Boden\naccessed computers controlling the Maroochy Shire Council’s sewerage system, altering\nelectronic data in particular sewerage pumping stations causing malfunctions in their\noperations. Vitek Boden had been employed by Hunter Watertech as its site supervisor\non the Maroochy SCADA project for about two years until resigning in December 1999.\nAt about the time of his resignation he approached the Council seeking employment. He\nwas told to enquire again at a later date. He made another approach to the Council for\nemployment in January 2000 and was told that he would not be employed. The sewerage\nsystem then experienced a series of faults:\n\n|IDENTIFIER|FAMILY|CLASS|\n|---|---|---|\n|AC|Access Control|Technical|\n|AT|Awareness and Training|Operational|\n|AU|Audit and Accountability|Technical|\n|CA|Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments|Management|\n|CM|Configuration Management|Operational|\n|CP|Contingency Planning|Operational|\n|IA|Identification and Authentication|Technical|\n|IR|Incident Response|Operational|\n|MA|Maintenance|Operational|\n|MP|Media Protection|Operational|\n|PE|Physical and Environmental Protection|Operational|\n|PL|Planning|Management|\n|PS|Personnel Security|Operational|\n|RA|Risk Assessment|Management|\n|SA|System and Services Acquisition|Management|\n|SC|System and Communications Protection|Technical|\n|SI|System and Information Integrity|Operational|\n\n\n-----\n\n� Pumps were not running when they should have been\n� Alarms were not reporting to the central computer\n� A loss of communication between the central computer and various pumping\nstations.\n\nAn employee of Hunter Watertech, Mr. Yager, was appointed to look into the problem.\nHe began monitoring and recording all signals, messages and traffic on the radio\nnetwork. As a result of his investigations he concluded that many of the problems being\nexperienced with the system resulted from human intervention rather than equipment\nfailure. Other technical experts shared his opinion. Further, the evidence revealed that\nthe problems associated with the attack ceased when Vitek Boden was arrested. On an\noccasion during Mr. Yager’s investigations, he ascertained that pumping station 14\nseemed to be the source of the messages corrupting the system. He physically checked\nthe pumping station and ascertained that it was working properly and bore no signs of\nhaving been physically tampered with. He concluded that the source of the false\nmessages was a PDS Compact 500 computer with an address of 14 and he changed the\nidentification number of pumping station 14 to 3 so that any legitimate messages from\nthat station could be identified as coming from station 3. Conversely, any messages\ncoming from a station identifying itself as 14 would be known to be bogus.\n\nOn March 16, 2000, when malfunctions occurred in the system, Mr. Yager\ncommunicated over the network with a bogus pump station 14 that was sending messages\nto corrupt the system. He was temporarily successful in altering his program to exclude\nthe bogus messages but then had his computer shut out of the network for a short period.\nThe intruder was now using PDS identification number 1 to send messages. Further\nproblems then occurred as a result of a person gaining remote computer access to the\nsystem and altering data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected\npumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.\n\nThe central computer was unable to exercise proper control and, at great inconvenience\nand expense, technicians had to be mobilized throughout the system to correct faults at\naffected pumping stations. On one occasion, a pumping station overflowed causing raw\nsewerage to escape.\n\nOn April 23, 2000, an intruder, by means of electronic messages, disabled alarms at four\npumping stations using the identification of pumping station 4. The intrusions began just\nafter 7:30 pm and concluded just after 9:00 pm. By this time Vitek Boden had fallen\nunder suspicion and was under surveillance. Police officers located a vehicle driven by\nhim. When Boden’s vehicle was pulled over and searched at around 10:00 pm, a PDS\nCompact 500 computer, later identified in evidence as the property of Hunter Watertech,\nwas found, as was a laptop computer.\n\nOn examination it was found that the software to enable the laptop to communicate with\nthe PDS system through the PDS computer had been re-installed in the laptop on\nFebruary 29, 2000. The PDS Compact computer had been programmed to identify itself\nas pump station 4 – the identification used by the intruder in accessing the Council\nsewerage system earlier that night. The software program installed in the laptop was one\n\n\n-----\n\ndeveloped by Hunter Watertech for its use in changing configurations in the PDS\ncomputers. There was evidence that this program was required to enable a computer to\naccess the Council’s sewerage system and had no other practical use. The unchallenged\nevidence of Sergeant. Kingsley, a police computer expert, was that the program had been\nused at least 31 times between April 7 and April 19 and that it was last used at 9:31 pm\non April 23, 2000. Also found in the car was a two-way radio set to the frequencies of\nthe repeater stations and the leads necessary to connect the PDS computer, the laptop and\nthe radio.\n\nMr. Yager and others gave evidence that the conduct of the person responsible for the\nunauthorized interventions in the computer system displayed a detailed familiarity with\nthe system, beyond that which was likely to be held even by Council technical staff.\nTechnical experts other than Mr. Yager also gave evidence that the computer\nmalfunctions, the subject of the charges, were the result of human intervention. When\napprehended by police Boden asserted in a taped conversation that all the items in the\nvehicle were his own. He said he had been up to Rainbow Beach and that he used the\ncomputer for study, personal correspondence and work in his family business. He later\nsent a letter to the police requesting the immediate return of his property. Examination of\nthe laptop found in the car revealed start up and shut down times (on and after February\n28, 2000) consistent with the time of the attacks which Mr. Yager had uncovered and\nwhich he had logged.\n\nThe existence of other problems in the system showed that the malfunctions were the\nresult of human intervention. Once it was demonstrated that the malfunctions resulted\nfrom human intervention, the existence of other problems became of limited significance.\nMr. Yager was adamant that the malfunctions in the system could only have been caused\nby unauthorized human intervention.\n\nBoden sought to establish that some of the electronic messages that gave rise to the\ncharges could have been caused by system malfunction or by error on the part of Council\nemployees. One of his arguments in this regard showed three sets of identical messages\non the same day from addresses 000, 099 and 004. The Crown contended that only the\nmessage emanating from address 004 was initiated by Boden. Boden pointed to the other\nmessages as evidence that defective messages of the nature of those relied on by the\nCrown may have been caused other than by human intervention.\n\nAnother witness, Mr. Lewer–an engineer specializing in computer engineering who, for a\ntime, was Hunter Watertech’s project engineer on the installation of the computerized\nsewerage system– said that all three messages were generated by the PDS configuration\nprogram used on the PDS Compact computers. Mr. Lewer’s opinion was that the\nmessages, other than the ones from address 004, were generated by persons attempting to\nrectify the result of the alleged unauthorized intervention. He also gave evidence that\nthat 000 and 099 messages were not causing damage to the computer system. Mr. Yager\ngave evidence some days later than Mr. Lewer and thus had more opportunity to consider\nthe possible explanations for the 000 and 099 messages. His evidence was that these\nmessages occurred over several days and resulted from the actions of maintenance staff\n\n\n-----\n\nwho were either employees of Hunter Watertech or Council employees under direction of\nthe former. He ruled out the possibility of mechanical error. He said that the 004\nmessages were definitely generated by a person different from the one who generated the\nother messages.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1997-December 1999 - Vitek Boden employed by Hunter Watertech as site supervisor\nDecember 3, 1999 - Boden resigns from Hunter Watertech\nEarly December 1999 - Boden approached City Council seeking employment\nEarly January 2000 - Boden reapproached City Council and was turned down\nFebruary 9-April 23, 2000 – SCADA system experiences series of faults\nMarch 16, 2000, Hunter Watertech investigator tried to troubleshoot system\nApril 19, 2000 Log indicates system program had been run at least 31 times\nApril 23, 2000 Boden disabled alarms at four pumping stations using the identification of\npumping station 4. The intrusions began just after 7:30 pm and concluded just after 9\npm\nApril 23, 2000 Boden pulled over by police with computer equipment in car\nOctober 31, 2001 –Boden convicted in trial – sentenced to 2 years\nMarch 21, 2002 – Appeal rejected\n\n## Evidence \nThe counts on which Boden was found guilty related to acts of cyber penetration which\ncommenced on or about February 28, 2000.\n\n  - The laptop taken by the police from Boden’s vehicle had been reloaded with most\nof its software operating programs on February 28, 2000\n\n  - PDS software file had been installed or re-installed on the laptop on February 29\nat 3:46 pm. This is the software used to run or access the computers in the\nsewerage system.\n\n`o` Run at least 31 times prior to April 19\n`o` Last run on April 23\n\n  - Two-way radio was of the type used in the Council’s communication system.\n\n`o` Tuned into the frequencies of the repeater stations\n`o` Serial numbers on the radio matched delivery docket provided by the\nsupplier of the radios to Hunter Watertech.\n\n  - PDS Compact 500\n\n`o` Address set to 004\n`o` Serial number identified it as a device which should have been in the\npossession of Hunter Watertech.\n\n## Attack Summary\n\n  - Vitek Boden was an insider who was never an employee of the organization he\nattacked.\n\n`o` He was an employee of a contractor that supplied IT/control system\ntechnology to the Maroochy Shire Council.\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` With his knowledge he was the “ultimate insider”.\n\n  - The service contract was deficient or inadequate concerning Watertech’s\nresponsibilities\n\n`o` Management, technical and operational cyber security controls required\n`o` Personnel security controls that applied to its employees such as\nbackground investigations and protection from disgruntled employees\n\n  - A number of anomalous events occurred before recognition that the incidents\nwere intentional.\n\n`o` As a skillful adversary, Boden was able to disguise his actions.\n`o` Extensive digital forensics were required to determine that a deliberate\nattack was underway\n\n  - There were no existing cyber security policies or procedures.\n\n  - There were no cyber security defenses.\n\n# Observations\nAs reported by Slay & Miller, Robert Stringfellow was the civil engineer in charge of the\nwater supply and sewage systems at Maroochy Water Services during the time of the\nbreach and has presented his analysis in closed forums. Stringfellow observed:\n\n   - At first it was easier to blame installation errors for the problems.\n\n   - Upon reinstalling all the software and checking the system, pump station\nsettings kept changing beyond the ability of the system to do this automatically\n\n   - Conclusion: an external malicious entity was using wireless equipment to access\nthe SCADA system.\nStringfellow's analysis of the incident made several important points:\n\n  - It is very difficult to protect against insider attacks.\n\n  - Radio communications commonly used in SCADA systems are generally insecure\nor are improperly configured.\n\n  - SCADA devices and software should be secured to the extent possible using\nphysical and logical controls\n\n  - It is often that case that security controls are not implemented or are not used\nproperly\n\n  - SCADA systems must record all device accesses and commands, especially those\ninvolving connections to or from remote sites; this requires fairly sophisticated\nlogging mechanisms.\nStringfellow also recommended the use of anti-virus and firewall protection along with\nappropriate use of encryption. He emphasized a need for upgrade-able SCADA systems\n(from a security perspective), proper staff training, and security auditing and control.\n\n# Applying SP 800-53 Controls\nThis case revolves around a disgruntled insider who was never an employee of the\norganization he attacked. Some of the issues raised by analysis of this case are just being\naddressed by cyber security practitioners 8 years later. Some are unresolved with no\nsolution in sight. .\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of Boden’s malicious activities are addressed by SP 800-53 controls, as detailed\nbelow. Several pervasive prophylactic measures covered by SP 800-53 controls\nimmediately come to mind. These measures, not related to an specific malicious activity\nare discussed first. Table 2 lists problems uncovered by the investigation into the attack\nand the corresponding SP 800-53 control that could have prevented or mitigated it.\n\n**TABLE 2: SP 800-53 PERVASIVE PROPHYLACTIC CONTROLS**\n\n**PROBLEM** **CONTROL** **FAMILY**\nPolicy and Procedures The first control in every control family\naddresses policy and procedure.\nPersonnel Security Personnel Security (PS)\nHardware & Software System and Services Acquisition (SA)\nAwareness and Training Awareness and Training (AT)\nAudit Audit and Accountability (AU)\nContingency Planning Contingency Planning (CP)\nIncident Response Incident Response (IR)\nInformation Protection System and Communications Protection (SC)\n\n## Policy and Procedures\nEvery organization should have cyber security policy and procedures. There are many\ndiscretionary and judgmental activates that require guidance. Common sense isn’t\nsufficient; dos and don’ts need to be written down.\n\nNeither organization had cyber security policies or procedures in place. For example:\nAC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation\nguidance for wireless technologies; and (ii) authorizes, monitors, controls wireless access\nto the information system.. Such policy would have addressed the two-way radio that\nwas used by Boden.\n\nThe first control in every control family addresses policy and procedure. With minor\nvariations, the control begins: “The organization develops, disseminates, and\nperiodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal, documented, incident response policy that\naddresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination\namong organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures\nto facilitate ….” Although enumerated for each control family, the family policy can be\nincluded as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Family\ncontrol procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a\nparticular information system, when required.\n\n## Personnel Security\nSince Boden was never a Maroochy Council employee, direct hiring controls by the\nMaroochy Council were technically not applicable. However, is it prudent for to have a\nkey personnel clause to protect the client from unilateral changes in key personnel by the\ncontractor. In general, the contract should extend applicable Personnel Security controls\nto contractor employees. Determining which controls to apply to on-site contractor\n\n|PROBLEM|CONTROL FAMILY|\n|---|---|\n|Policy and Procedures|The first control in every control family addresses policy and procedure.|\n|Personnel Security|Personnel Security (PS)|\n|Hardware & Software|System and Services Acquisition (SA)|\n|Awareness and Training|Awareness and Training (AT)|\n|Audit|Audit and Accountability (AU)|\n|Contingency Planning|Contingency Planning (CP)|\n|Incident Response|Incident Response (IR)|\n|Information Protection|System and Communications Protection (SC)|\n\n\n-----\n\npersonnel may not be easy since it depends on the role played by the individual. The\nPersonnel Security family (PS) contains the following controls:\n\nPS-1 Personnel Security Policy and PS-5 Personnel Transfer\nProcedures\n\nPS-2 Position Categorization PS-6 Access Agreements\n\nPS-3 Personnel Screening PS-7 Third-Party Personnel Security\n\nPS-4 Personnel Termination PS-8 Personnel Sanctions\n\nPS-7 identifies the need for contractual obligations on the subcontractor concerning\npersonnel security. Controls PS-3 and 4 should certainly be considered. In practice\nmany positions may be occupied by employees or contractors. The contractual\nobligations should support equal treatment for direct employees and contractor\nemployees.\n\n## System and Services Acquisition\nHunter Watertech supplied hardware, software, and services to the Maroochy Shire\nCouncil. The cyber security responsibilities of the contractor organization (e.g., Hunter\nWatertech) and the contractor’s employees (e.g., Boden) should be included in the\ncontract between the organizations. Almost all of the controls applicable to direct\nemployees are also applicable to contractor employees, but the exact details may vary.\nMany of these controls also obligate the contractor organization concerning record\nkeeping and other support services. Applicable security controls are in the System and\nServices Acquisition family (SA) are listed below. There is no indication that any of\nthese controls were included in the contract between Hunter Watertech and Maroochy\nShire Council. All the controls are important; we believe that SA-4 and 11 might have\nhelped directly in in this case.\n\nSA-1 System and Services Acquisition SA-7 User Installed Software\nPolicy and\nProcedures\n\nSA-2 Allocation of Resources SA-8 Security Engineering\nPrinciples\n\nSA-3 Life Cycle Support SA-9 External Information System\nServices\n\nSA-4 Acquisitions SA-10 Developer Configuration\nManagement\n\nSA-5 Information System SA-11 Developer Security Testing\nDocumentation\n\nSA-6 Software Usage Restrictions\n\n|PS-1|Personnel Security Policy and Procedures|PS-5|Personnel Transfer|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|PS-2|Position Categorization|PS-6|Access Agreements|\n|PS-3|Personnel Screening|PS-7|Third-Party Personnel Security|\n|PS-4|Personnel Termination|PS-8|Personnel Sanctions|\n\n|SA-1|System and Services Acquisition Policy and Procedures|SA-7|User Installed Software|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|SA-2|Allocation of Resources|SA-8|Security Engineering Principles|\n|SA-3|Life Cycle Support|SA-9|External Information System Services|\n|SA-4|Acquisitions|SA-10|Developer Configuration Management|\n|SA-5|Information System Documentation|SA-11|Developer Security Testing|\n|SA-6|Software Usage Restrictions|||\n\n\n-----\n\n## Awareness and Training\nPersonnel were not trained in preventing, recognizing, or responding to cyber-related\nincidents. Security awareness and training inform personnel of the information security\nrisks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in complying with\norganizational policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks. The Awareness\nand Training family (AT) contains the following controls:\n\nAT-1 Security Awareness and AT- Security Training Records\nTraining Policy and Procedures 4\n\nAT-2 Security Awareness AT-5 Contacts with Security Groups\nand Associations\n\nAT-3 Security Training\n\nEvery control except AT-5 could have helped in this case. NIST SP 800-50, Building an\n_Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, provides additional_\ninformation.\n\n## Audit\nThe Maroochy communications and control components lacked sufficient audit capability\nto support fault determination or forensic analysis. Audit is concerned with collecting\ninformation that is significant and relevant to the security of the information system.\nAudit supports other control families such as incident response, access control, and flaw\nremediation. The Audit and Accountability family (AU) contains the following controls:\n\nAU-1 Audit and Accountability Policy AU-7 Audit Reduction and Report\nand Procedures Generation\n\nAU-2 Auditable Events AU-8 Time Stamps\n\nAU-3 Content of Audit Records AU-9 Protection of Audit\nInformation\n\nAU-4 Audit Storage Capacity AU-10 Non-repudiation\n\nAU-5 Response to Audit Processing AU-11 Audit Record Retention\nFailures\n\nAU-6 Audit Monitoring, Analysis, and\nReporting\n\nAU-2, 3, 4, 6, 7,9, and 11 apply to this case.\n\n## Contingency Planning\nThe analysis indicates that there were no plans to deal with an emergency or system\ndisruption. Effective contingency planning, execution, and testing are essential to\nmitigate the risk of system and service unavailability. The Contingency Planning family\n(CP) contains the following controls:\n\n|AT-1|Security Awareness and Training Policy and Procedures|AT- 4|Security Training Records|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|AT-2|Security Awareness|AT-5|Contacts with Security Groups and Associations|\n|AT-3|Security Training|||\n\n|AU-1|Audit and Accountability Policy and Procedures|AU-7|Audit Reduction and Report Generation|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|AU-2|Auditable Events|AU-8|Time Stamps|\n|AU-3|Content of Audit Records|AU-9|Protection of Audit Information|\n|AU-4|Audit Storage Capacity|AU-10|Non-repudiation|\n|AU-5|Response to Audit Processing Failures|AU-11|Audit Record Retention|\n|AU-6|Audit Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting|||\n\n\n-----\n\nCP-5 Contingency Plan Update CP-10 Information System Recovery\nand Reconstitution\n\nCP-2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 apply to this case. NIST SP 800-34 provides guidance on\ncontingency planning.\n\n## Incident Response\nResponse to the sewerage discharge was ad hoc. Considerable time elapsed during\ntroubleshooting before malicious intent was considered. An incident response capability\nis necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating\nthe weaknesses that were exploited, restoring computing services, and apprehending\nmalefactors. Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking,\nestablishing a successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and\nresources. Establishing clear procedures for assessing the current and potential business\nimpact of incidents is critical, as is implementing effective methods of collecting,\nanalyzing, and reporting data. Building relationships and establishing suitable means of\ncommunication with other internal groups (e.g., human resources, legal) and with\nexternal groups (e.g., other incident response teams, law enforcement) are also vital. The\nIncident Response family (IR) contains the following controls:\n\nIR-1 Incident Response Policy and IR-5 Incident Monitoring\nProcedures\n\nIR-2 Incident Response Training IR-6 Incident Reporting\n\nIR-3 Incident Response Testing and IR-7 Incident Response Assistance\nExercises\n\nIR-4 Incident Handling\n\nAll of these controls are applicable to the Maroochy system. NIST SP 800-61 provides\nguidance on incident handling and reporting. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on\nmalware incident handling and prevention.\n\n## Information Protection\nCryptography is employed as a protective mechanism for many objectives. A second line\nof defense that was widely deployed only in 2006 was encryption protection of\ninformation in stolen and lost devices.\n\n|CP-1|Contingency Planning Policy and Procedures|CP-6|Alternate Storage Site|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|CP-2|Contingency Plan|CP-7|Alternate Processing Site|\n|CP-3|Contingency Training|CP-8|Telecommunications Services|\n|CP-4|Contingency Plan Testing and Exercises|CP-9|Information System Backup|\n|CP-5|Contingency Plan Update|CP-10|Information System Recovery and Reconstitution|\n\n|IR-1|Incident Response Policy and Procedures|IR-5|Incident Monitoring|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|IR-2|Incident Response Training|IR-6|Incident Reporting|\n|IR-3|Incident Response Testing and Exercises|IR-7|Incident Response Assistance|\n|IR-4|Incident Handling|||\n\n\n-----\n\nThe US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a policy memorandum in June\n2006[8], recommending safeguards for all federal government agencies. Safeguards\nrelevant to this case are:\n\n� Encrypt all data on mobile computers/devices which carry agency data unless the\ndata is determined to be non-sensitive, in writing, by the Deputy Secretary or an\nindividual he/she may designate in writing.\n� Allow remote access only with two-factor authentication where one of the factors\nis provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access.\n\nWhile this OMB policy was issued in response to loss or theft of devices containing\nPersonal Identification Information (PII), its phrasing encompasses protection of all\nsensitive data and information. The specific intent of this policy is to compensate for the\nprotections offered by the physical security controls when information is removed from,\nor accessed from outside of the agency location and when information is physically\ntransported outside of the agency’s secured, physical perimeter (this includes information\ntransported on removable media on portable/mobile devices such as laptop computers\nand/or personal digital assistants).\n\nThe System and Communications Protection family (SC) contains 23 controls. The\ncontrols addressing cryptography are:\n\nSC-1 System and Communications SC-13 Use of Cryptography\nProtection Policy and\nProcedures\n\nSC-9 Transmission Confidentiality SC-17 Public Key Infrastructure\nCertificates\n\nThe OMB policy is more explicit. This policy would have addressed the laptop and twoway radio that were in Boden's possession when he was arrested. However, since Boden\nhad reloaded the software and no data disclosure was involved, the practical impact is\nlittle to none.\n\n## Malicious Activities\nTable 3 lists Boden’s malicious activities and the corresponding SP 800-53 control that\ncould have prevented or mitigated it.\n\n**TABLE 3: MALICIOUS ACTIVITY AND CORRESPONDING CONTROLS**\n\n**MALICIOUS** **ACTIVITY** **CONTROL** **FAMILY**\nStealing equipment Media Protection (MP)\nIssuing radio commands Access Control (AC)\nIdentification and Authentication (IA)\nFalsifying network address Access Control (AC)\n\n8 Office of Management and Budget, Protection of Sensitive Agency Information, M-06-16, June 23, 2006.\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2006/m06-16.pdf\n\n|SC-1|System and Communications Protection Policy and Procedures|SC-13|Use of Cryptography|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|SC-9|Transmission Confidentiality|SC-17|Public Key Infrastructure Certificates|\n\n|MALICIOUS ACTIVITY|CONTROL FAMILY|\n|---|---|\n|Stealing equipment|Media Protection (MP)|\n|Issuing radio commands|Access Control (AC) Identification and Authentication (IA)|\n|Falsifying network address|Access Control (AC)|\n\n\n-----\n\nSending false data and instructions System and Information Integrity (SI)\nDisabling alarms\n\n## Access Control \nAccess Control is the process of granting or denying specific requests for obtaining and\nusing information and related information processing services. This is one of the\nfundamental controls on any IT system. Most access controls are based on the identity of\nthe person, process, or device involved. Therefore, Identification and Authentication are\nintimately tied with access control. Access controls need to be applied appropriate to the\ncommunications environment.\n\nAccess controls are the first line of defense against error and omissions and malicious\nattacks from insiders and outsiders. The Access Control family (AC) contains the\nfollowing controls:\n\nAC-1 Access Control Policy and AC-11 Session Lock\nProcedures\n\nAC-2 Account Management AC-12 Session Termination\n\nAC-3 Access Enforcement AC-13 Supervision and Review—\nAccess Control\n\nAC-4 Information Flow Enforcement AC-14 Permitted Actions without\nIdentification or\nAuthentication\nAC-5 Separation of Duties AC-15 Automated Marking\n\nAC-6 Least Privilege AC-16 Automated Labeling\n\nAC-7 Unsuccessful Login Attempts AC-17 Remote Access\n\nAC-8 System Use Notification AC-18 Wireless Access Restrictions\n\nAC-9 Previous Logon Notification AC-19 Access Control for Portable\nand Mobile Devices\n\nAC-10 Concurrent Session Control AC-20 Use of External Information\nSystems\nMultiple access controls would have alleviated or prevented the attack, including: AC-2\n\n**ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT “The organization manages information system accounts,**\nincluding establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing\naccounts…”; AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT “The information system enforces assigned\nauthorizations for controlling access to the system in accordance with applicable policy.”;\n\n**AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS “The organization documents, monitors, and controls all methods of**\nremote access (e.g., dial-up, Internet) to the information system including remote access\nfor privileged functions….”; AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS “The organization: (i)\nestablishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for wireless technologies; and\n(ii) documents, monitors, and controls wireless access to the information system.” With\nthe enhancement “The organization uses authentication and encryption to protect wireless\n\n|Sending false data and instructions|System and Information Integrity (SI)|\n|---|---|\n|Disabling alarms||\n\n|ollowing|controls:|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|AC-1|Access Control Policy and Procedures|AC-11|Session Lock|\n|AC-2|Account Management|AC-12|Session Termination|\n|AC-3|Access Enforcement|AC-13|Supervision and Review— Access Control|\n|AC-4|Information Flow Enforcement|AC-14|Permitted Actions without Identification or Authentication|\n|AC-5|Separation of Duties|AC-15|Automated Marking|\n|AC-6|Least Privilege|AC-16|Automated Labeling|\n|AC-7|Unsuccessful Login Attempts|AC-17|Remote Access|\n|AC-8|System Use Notification|AC-18|Wireless Access Restrictions|\n|AC-9|Previous Logon Notification|AC-19|Access Control for Portable and Mobile Devices|\n|AC-10|Concurrent Session Control|AC-20|Use of External Information Systems|\n\n\n-----\n\naccess to the information system.”; and AC-20 USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS “the\norganization restricts the use of personally owned information systems.”\n\n## Identification and Authentication\nIdentification is the process of determining the identity of a user, process, or device, and\nauthentication is the process of verifying the putative or claimed identity, often as a\nprerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. The Identification\nand Authentication family (IA) contains controls that would prevent unauthorized access\nto the control system:\n\nIA-1 Identification and Authentication IA-4 Identifier Management\nPolicy and Procedures\n\nIA-2 User Identification and IA-5 Authenticator Management\nAuthentication\n\nIA-3 Device Identification and IA-6 Authenticator Feedback\nAuthentication\n\nIA-4 Identifier Management\n\n**IA-2 USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION** “The information system uniquely identifies\nand authenticates users (or processes acting on behalf of users) … through the use of\npasswords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some\ncombination therein….”; and IA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION “The\ninformation system identifies and authenticates specific devices before establishing a\nconnection, [using] either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC)\nor Transmission Control Program/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses) or an\norganizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication\nProtocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS)\nauthentication)” are the primary controls. IA-4 and IA-5 provide management for the\nparameters used.\n\n## Portable Device Protection\nPart of defense-in-depth is recognizing that when some protections fail, there should be\nmore controls to help protect the organization. Theft of portable electronic equipment\noccurs, often for the value of the equipment rather than the information stored. Boden’s\nattack was an exception to this generality.\n\nThe control specified in MP-2, Media Access, is deceptively simple: “The organization\nrestricts access to information system media to authorized individuals.” Supplemental\nguidance elaborates: “Information system media includes both digital media (e.g.,\ndiskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact\ndisks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control\nalso applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with\ninformation storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants,\ncellular telephones). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media\nand associated information contained on that media requiring restricted access.\n\n|IA-1|Identification and Authentication Policy and Procedures|IA-4|Identifier Management|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|IA-2|User Identification and Authentication|IA-5|Authenticator Management|\n|IA-3|Device Identification and Authentication|IA-6|Authenticator Feedback|\n|IA-4|Identifier Management|||\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access,\nindividuals authorized to access the media, and the specific measures taken to restrict\naccess.”\n\n## System Monitoring\nAnother part of defense-in-depth is determining that something is going wrong. The\ncause may be an intruder, often masquerading as an authorized user, or a malfunction. SI\n**4 INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES “The organization employs tools**\nand techniques to monitor events on the information system, detect attacks, and provide\nidentification of unauthorized use of the system” provides a context for alerting personnel\nof a suspected anomaly. If applied regularly and systematically, the type of forensics\nperformed by Hunter Watertech and the police might have detected the attack earlier.\n\n# Conclusions\nThe 2000 Maroochy Shire cyber event is important because it provides a public record of\nan intentional, targeted attack by a knowledgeable person on an industrial control system.\nThe attack by an insider who is not an employee demonstrates several critical physical,\nadministrative, and supply chain vulnerabilities of industrial control systems. The key\nissue is the treatment of vulnerabilities coming from suppliers or others outside the\norganization. Contractor and sub-contractor personnel are often overlooked as a potential\nattack source. The technical issues demonstrate the difficulty in identifying a control\nsystem cyber attack and retaking control of a “hijacked” system. Once alerted to this\ntype of attack, ICS owners and operators may have adequate controls to protect their\nassets. However, a determined, knowledgeable adversary such as Vitek Boden could\npotentially defeat these controls.\n\n\n-----",
