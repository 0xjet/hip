The team first revealed these\nfindings on Wednesday, October 2, during Anomali Detect 19, the company’s annual user\nconference, in a session titled: “Mustang Panda Riding Across Country Lines.”\n\nCrowdStrike researchers first published information on Mustang Panda in June 2018, after\napproximately one year of observing malicious activities that shared unique Tactics, Techniques,\nand Procedures (TTPs).[1] This campaign dates back to at least November 2018. The research\ndoes not indicate with absolute certainty which entities are being targeted or the impact the\ncampaign has had. Based on the lure documents observed by Anomali, we believe that the\nfollowing may be targeted:\n\nIndividuals interested in the United Nations’ Security Council Committee resolutions\nregarding the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL / Da’esh)\nMongolian-based MIAT Airlines\nNon-profit China Center (China-Zentrum e.V.); according to its website, this officially\nrecognized nonprofit organization’s aim is to foster encounters and exchange between\ncultures and religions in the West and in China\nTargeted countries including but not limited to Germany, Mongolia, Myanmar (Burma),\nPakistan, Vietnam\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam (CVP)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Shan Tai; a group of people living in Southeast Asia, which Minority Rights Group\nInternational describes as a “minority” in the region, with members who are primarily\nTheravada Buddhists\n\nThe malicious activity found by Anomali aligns with TTPs, specifically two through six, first\nidentified by CrowdStrike. The observed TTPs consist of the following:\n\n1. Use of zip file that contains a “.lnk” (Windows Shortcut) file.\n2. Utilization of double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to convince users to open the file.\n3. HTA (HTML Application) with VBScript embedded in the “.lnk” file\n4. VBScript drops payloads and opens a decoy document or PDF to the user.\n5. Usage of PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.[2]\n\nThe infection chain observed by Anomali researchers in this campaign is shown below in Figure\n1.\n\n_Figure 1 – Infection vector_\n\n\nWe also found similarities in targeting in Mongolia and an NGO. The use of United Nations’\ndocuments regarding activities in the Middle East may also be indicative of think-tank targeting.\nFurthermore, the use of PlugX malware also aligns with CrowdStrike’s previous findings of activity\nattributed to Mustang Panda.[3]\n\nAnalysts’ note: The language capabilities to read some of the lure documents is not available\nwithin Anomali at this time. We would encourage those with the language skills necessary to\nanalyze the documents further.\n\n## Targeting\n\nIn mid-August 2019, the Anomali Threat Research Team discovered suspicious “.lnk” files during\nroutine intelligence collection. While the distribution method of these documents cannot be\nconfirmed at this time, it is likely that spearphishing is being utilized because it aligns with\nMustang Panda’s TTPs, and it is a common tactic used amongst APT actors. The lure documents\nare also too specific in their targeting, and the targeted entities and individuals would be of\ninterest to a China-sponsored threat group.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther analysis of the files led to the identification of other .lnk files that were attempting to\ninfect individuals with a Cobalt Strike Beacon (penetration-testing tool) or PlugX (Remote Access\nTool (RAT); other payloads were unable to be identified as of this writing. Anomali researchers\nidentified 15 malicious documents that we believe were utilized by Mustang Panda in an ongoing\ncampaign. The documents reveal malicious activity dating from at least November 2018 up to\nAugust 29, 2019. The date of this activity is confirmed by the VirusTotal (VT) submission dates,\nwhich will be analyzed further in the following sections. In addition, the dates within the\ndocuments go back as far as October 8, 2017, therefore, it is possible this activity goes back to\n2017 if the group was using current content in their lures. The primary target of this campaign\nwere found to be the ruling political party of Vietnam, The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV);\nother targets observed in the malicious documents include the following:\n\nCPV of Lang Son province, Vietnam\nCPV of Lao Cai province, Vietnam\nEmbassy of Vietnam, China\nHenan Provincial Party Committee, Vietnam\nIndividuals who would find United Nations’ documents of interest, potentially think tanks\nMIAT Airlines, Mongolian airline\nPolice of Sindh Province, Pakistan\nRestoration Council of Shan State / Shan State Army, Loi Tai Leng, Southern Shan State,\nMyanmar (Burma)\nThe China Center (China Zentrum e.V), Germany\n\nThe lure documents are themed to be relevant to their targets, and in some cases are copies of\nlegitimate documents that are publicly available. The “.lnk” files being utilized by Mustang Panda\ntypically contain an embedded HTA script that, once executed, will drop and open the decoy\ndocument while the malicious activity of the payload runs in the background. Other lure\ndocuments are themed to be relevant to their targets, and in some cases are legitimate\ndocuments that are publicly available. The final type of malicious document we observed were\nempty, and only contain an image, such as requesting for macros to be enabled, used to distract\nsomeone while malicious activity takes place in the background.\n\n## Lure Document Analysis\n\nThe 15 documents will be discussed below from the most recent VT submission to the earliest.\nThe identified samples follow the same infection chain, and the technical analysis will be\ndiscussed in a later section.\n\n**Document – 1**\n**Document Title – TCO BT574.doc**\n**Sample – 05CF906B750EB335125695DA42F4EAFC**\n**Payload – Cobalt Strike**\n**Submission date – 8/29/2019 1:27:41 AM**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – TCO BT574.doc_\n\nAs seen above, this document is addressed to the Embassy of Vietnam in China. The document\nappears to discuss a warning issued to the Vietnam government related to a military exercise on\na set of coordinates. Specifically, the document informs that no civilian ships are allowed on said\ncoordinates. The document continues and mentions a new ice-breaking ship called “Snow\nDragon 2” and mentions August 15, 2019, as the beginning of a 35-day trial run. This document\nindicates a regional interest with specificity.\n\n**Document – 2**\n**Document Title – 32_1.PDF**\n**Sample – 9A180107EFB15A00E64DB3CE6394328D**\n**Payload – Cobalt Strike Beacon**\n**Submission date – 8/26/2019 6:28:40 AM**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 – 32_1.pdf_\n\nMustang Panda is using this decoy document, dated August 15, 2019, to target the People’s\nCommittee Lang Son Province. The Peoples’ Committee is the executive branch of a Vietnamese\nprovince.[4] The Lang Son province shares a border with China’s Guangxi Province. The area has\nhistorically served as an important location for trade, and therefore control over the location has\n\n\n-----\n\nlong been disputed and fought over.[ ] The border shared between China and Vietnam measures\n1,281 km in length and multiple wars and numerous lives have been lost in conflicts fought, the\ncomplexities and intricacies of which will not be further discussed.[6]\n\n**Document – 3**\n**Document Title – Daily News (19-8-2019)**\n**Sample – 5F094CB3B92524FCED2731C57D305E78**\n**Payload – PlugX**\n**Submission date – 8/19/2019 6:11:32 AM**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Daily News (19-8-2019)_\n\nThis document appears to be targeting the Shan Tai people by using a document referencing the\nRestoration Council of Shan State (RCSS). The Shan Tai people make up the largest minority\ngroup in Myanmar (Burma) and are located in Northwestern and Eastern Myanmar (Burma) and\nthe Yunnan province in China.[7] The RCSS, also referred to as Shan State Army (SSA), is a\ngovernment/political organization that is headquartered in Loi Tai Leng, Southern Shan state, in\npresent-day Myanmar (Burma), bordering Thailand.[8] The targeting of minority groups is a known\ntactic used by the government of the People’s Republic of China.\n\n\n**Document – 4**\n**Document Title – S_2019_50_E.lnk**\n**Sample – 4FE276EDC21EC5F2540C2BABD81C8653**\n**Payload – PlugX**\n**Submission date – 6/6/2019 9:37:18 AM**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – S_2019_50_E.docx_\n\n\n-----\n\nMustang Panda retrieved this document from the United Nations Digital Library that is titled\n“Letter dated 15 January 2019 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established\npursuant to Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning Islamic State in\nIraq and the Levant (Da'esh), Al-Qaida and Associated Individuals, Groups, Undertakings and\nEntities addressed to the President of the Security Council.”[9]\n\nAt the time of this writing, it is unknown who, or what this document may be targeting. However,\nthink-tank organizations may be interested in such a document, and said organizations were\nfound to be targets of Mustang Panda by CrowdStrike.[10]\n\n**Document – 5**\n**Document Title – European.lnk**\n**Sample – 9FF1D3AF1F39A37C0DC4CEEB18CC37DC**\n**Payload – PlugX**\n**Submission date – 6/5/2019 6:28:25 PM**\n\n_Figure 6 – European.lnk_\n\n\n“European.doc” is targeting The China Center (China Zentrum e.V) is, according to its website, a\nnon-profit organization that “encourages encounters and exchange between cultures and\nreligions in the West and in China. The members of the China-Zentrum are Catholic aid\norganizations, religious orders and dioceses in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.”[11]\n\nTargeting of NGOs was first documented by CrowdStrike and we believe we have observed\nMustang Panda attempting to attack a similar type of target.[12] In addition, an institution focused\non exchanging cultural knowledge aligns with China’s strategic interests\n\n\n-----\n\n## Targeting Pakistan\n\nUpon pivoting from the C2 domain apple-net[.]com, observed in the other samples that are part of\nthe campaign, Anomali found a malicious sample that targets the Police of the Sindh Province in\nPakistan. The PlugX malware has been observed as the payload that is targeting the Sindh\nProvince police.\n\n_Figure 7 – Samples Connecting to apple-net[.]com_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – DSR & CSR of Special Branch Sind.exe_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe “.lnk” files being utilized by MustangPanda typically contain an embedded HTA file with\nVBscript or PowerShell script that, once executed, will drop and open the decoy document while\nmalicious activity of the payload runs in the background. Throughout the campaign we observed\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – Infection vector_\n\n### “.lnk” File Analysis\n\nIn Windows “.lnk” is the file extension for shortcut files which points to an executable file. “.lnk”\nfiles usually holds plenty of forensic artifacts and they can reveal valuable information about the\nthreat actor’s environment. The metadata from the “.lnk” files led us to pivot to more samples from\nthe same campaign.\n\n_Figure 10 – “.lnk” File_\n\nTable 1 below shows the files that were part of the recent campaign from Mustang Panda.\n\n_Table 1 – Analyzed Samples_\n\n\n**Pay‐**\n**load**\n\n\n**MD5**\n\n\n**Link**\n**Cre‐**\n**ation**\n**Date** **File Name**\n\n\n165F8683681A4B136BE1F9D6EA7F00CE 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\n9FF1D3AF1F39A37C0DC4CEEB18C‐\nC37DC\n\n\n11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\nchuong trinh dang huong.doc.lnk Cobalt\nstrike\n\nEuropean.lnk PlugX\n\n\n-----\n\n4FE276EDC21EC5F2540C2BAB‐\nD81C8653\n\n\n11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\n43067F28DC5208D4A070CF3C‐\nC92E29FB\n\n\n11/21/10\n3:23\n\n\n11ADDA734FC67B9CFD‐\nF61396DE984559\n\n\n11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\n08F25A641E8361495A415C763FBB9B71 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n01D74E6D9F77D5202E7218FA524226C4 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\n6198D625ADA7389AAC276731CDEB‐\nB500\n\n\n11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\nS_2019_50_E.lnk PlugX\n\nno_name Cobalt\nstrike\n\nChuong trinh hoi nghi.doc.lnk Cobalt\nstrike\n\nGIAY MOI.doc.lnk Cobalt\nStrike\n\n421 CV.doc.lnk Cobalt\nStrike\n\nGIAYMOI.doc.lnk Cobalt\nstrike\n\nCV trao doi CAT Cao Bang.doc.lnk Cobalt\nstrike\n\ncf56ee00be8ca49d150d85dcb6d2f336.jpg.lnk PlugX\n\nDaily News (19-8-2019)(Soft Copy).lnk PlugX\n\n32_1.PDF.lnk Cobalt\nstrike\n\nTCO BT 574.doc.lnk Cobalt\nstrike\n\nsach tham khao Bo mon.docx.lnk PlugX\n\n\n9B39E1F72CF4ACFFD45F45F08483ABF0 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n748DE2B2AA1FA23FA5996F287437AF1B 11/20/10\n21:29\n\n5F094CB3B92524FCED2731C57D305E78 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n9A180107EFB15A00E64DB3CE6394328D 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n05CF906B750EB335125695DA42F4EAFC 11/21/10\n3:24\n\nF62DFC4999D624D01E94B89946EC1036 11/21/10\n3:24\n\nCA775717D000888A7F71A5907B9C9208 11/21/10\n3:24\n\nAA115F20472E78A068C1BBF739C443BF 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n11511b3d69fbb6cceaf1dd0278cbedfb 11/21/10\n3:24\n\n\nFor National Department Sar KNU JMC peo‐\nple Meeting 2019.lnk\n\n\ntieu luan ve quyen lam chu cua nhan\ndan.docx.lnk\n\n\nPlugX\n\n\nvai tro cua nhan dan.doc.lnk PlugX\n\n\nPlugX\n\n\nOnce the user opens the “.lnk” file, the embedded HTA file will be executed via “mshta.exe”, it\nthen writes a PowerShell script name “3.ps1” in the “%TEMP%” directory. The PowerShell script\nis then executed using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in a hidden window via WMI\nTasks.[[13]]\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 – VBScript drops PowerShell script_\n\n_Figure 12 – Using WMI to execute PowerShell Script in Hidden window_\n\nThe dropped file “3.ps1” is a base64 encoded PowerShell script.

In general, the “.lnk” files\nare less than 10Kb, but the malicious samples in the campaign were more than 700Kb. Upon\ntaking a closer look we found that the “.lnk” files were embedded with 3 base64 encoded\nexecutables.\n\nUpon opening the LNK file, it will then proceed to execute the below command via cmd.exe.\n\n**command: /c for %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do for /f \"delims==\" %i in ('dir \"%x\\tieu luan ve quyen**\nlam chu cua nhan dan docx lnk\" /s /b') do start m%windir: 1 1%hta exe \"%i\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command executes the HTA file embedded inside the shortcut and it decodes and drops 3\nexecutables in the “%TEMP%” directory and opens a decoy word document to the user.\n\n_Figure 16 – Extracted binaries and Decoy document_\n\nAll three dropped files were then moved to a new folder “C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft Malware\nProtectionGHQ”\n\n_Figure 17 – Binaries moved to different path_\n\nThe “3.exe” is a legitimate executable and it is signed by “ESET, spol. s r.o.” and it is being\nabused for DLL hijacking technique to execute http_dll.dll which decodes and loads the malicious\npayload http_dll.dat.\n\n_Table 2 – PlugX Hashes_\n\n**File Name** **Hash**\n\n3.exe (original name: EHttpSrv.exe) 28C6F235946FD694D2634C7A2F24C1BA\n\nhttp_dll.dll 9912EB641EABD640A476720C51F5E3AD\n\nhttp_dll.dat 2BC7298A57AE2B8AB5B4A7B53360EB5C\n\nAfter the payload execution it reaches out to the C2 via POST request as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /update?wd 4337295e HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nx-debug: 0\nx-request: 0\nx-content: 61456\nx-storage: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;SV1;\nHost: aridndvn.ccom:443\nContent-Length: 0\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\nPragma: no-cache\n\n```\nIf the C2 is not available the payload tries to reach different embedded C2 domains on unique\nports.\n\n_Figure 18 – Network connections to C2_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe malicious operations conducted by Mustang Panda in this campaign appear to be ongoing.\nThe targets, indicated by specific lure documents, are government or align strategically with a\nChina-sponsored APT group. China is currently in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) that focus\non the following themes: innovation, coordinated development, green growth, openness, and\ninclusive growth, respectively.[14] The objective of increasing exports and specific imports, which\nfalls under openness, would align with the targeting of the Lang Son province and its history of\ntrade. Utilizing lures themed around political parties, the Sindh police, and UN documents would\nalign with innovation, which is described “as the cornerstone of China’s development strategy”\nand attempts of “enhancing its future global competitiveness and technological edge.”[15]\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeting entities, or related entities, of said lures indicates a potential regional interest in\nstrategic information that may be of significance to a government. In addition, the TTPs observed\nby CrowdStrike are identical to the ones observed by Anomali.\n\nThis activity has been ongoing since at least November 2018, and possibly as far back to at least\nOctober 2017 if the lure documents were distributed around the times mentioned in them. This\nkind of malicious activity sponsored by China will likely continue as the country expands its efforts\nfor the ongoing Belt and Road Initiative that seeks to invest in infrastructure in over 100 countries.\nSuch economic and investment-led initiatives will cause China to be more interested in the\nregions its investing in, therefore it is likely that APT-related activity will follow.\n\n## IOCs\n\nIn addition, ATR found that the documents were attempting to, or were able to connect to the\nfollowing Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses:\n\n**Domain** **IPs** **First Seen**\n\nadobephotostage.com 50.63.202.94 6/29/19 22:03\n\nadobephotostage.com 50.63.202.67 6/24/19 16:30\n\nadobephotostage.com 50.63.202.82 6/7/19 1:31\n\nadobephotostage.com 184.168.221.94 6/22/19 3:30\n\nadobephotostage.com 184.168.221.82 6/19/19 14:24\n\nadobephotostage.com 184.168.221.71 6/10/19 6:57\n\nadobephotostage.com 50.63.202.73 6/1/19 9:49\n\nadobephotostage.com 207.148.12.47 6/7/18 10:05\n\nadobephotostage.com 149.28.74.41 6/4/18 11:33\n\nadobephotostage.com 207.148.78.101 5/31/18 3:26\n\nadobephotostage.com 149.28.74.149 5/24/18 7:19\n\nadobephotostage.com 50.63.202.59 5/22/18 20:29\n\nolk4.com 198.54.117.200 9/11/19 23:17\n\nolk4.com 198.54.117.199 8/3/19 1:29\n\nolk4.com 198.54.117.197 8/3/19 1:29\n\nolk4.com 198.54.117.198 8/3/19 1:29\n\nolk4.com 162.255.119.150 7/25/19 8:20\n\napple-net.com 167.88.180.148 6/12/19 23:41\n\napple-net.com 167.88.177.224 3/22/19 3:11\n\napple-net.com 167.88.180.3 10/29/18 12:21\n\n\n-----\n\napple-net.com 45.248.87.14 10/21/18 18:20\n\napple-net.com 91.195.240.117 8/6/18 7:08\n\napple-net.com 103.224.182.250 4/25/18 11:40\n\nwbemsystem.com 167.88.177.224 7/29/19 0:00\n\nyahoorealtors.com 167.88.178.24 7/4/19 13:00\n\nyahoorealtors.com 185.239.226.19 6/25/19 0:00\n\nyahoorealtors.com 185.239.226.19 4/3/19 1:17\n\nyahoorealtors.com 45.77.209.52 1/18/18 7:11\n\ninfosecvn.com 167.88.178.118 8/27/19 2:14\n\ninfosecvn.com 185.239.226.61 7/10/18 1:02\n\ninfosecvn.com 45.77.184.12 5/30/18 16:29\n\nairdndvn.com 167.88.178.118 6/27/19 0:00\n\nairdndvn.com 185.239.226.61 6/14/18 9:43\n\nairdndvn.com 45.77.184.12 5/31/18 13:50\n\nofficeproduces.com 45.32.50.150 7/25/19 7:10\n\n\nweb.adobephotostage.com\n\n\nWeb.officeproduces.com:8080\n\n\nUp.officeproduces.com\n\n\nWe.officeproduces.com\n\n\nDownload.officeproduces.com:443\n\n\ngeocities.jp\n\n\nupdate.olk4.com:53\n\n\nwww.cab-sec.com 167.88.180.15 09/18/2019 3:10\n\n\n43.254.217.67\n\n\n154.221.24.47\n\n\n144.202.54.86\n\n\n## URLs\n\nhttp://144.202.54.86/vkt2\nhttp://144.202.54.86/download/Mau2.hta\nhttp://144.202.54.86/download/Mau%20cam%20ket%20danh%20cho%20Chua%20Dang%20vien.docx\nhttp://airdndvn.com/6CDC9F833C87FB661DBB9339\nhttp://www.wbemsystem.com/B2FC407BB86E8219/397A4853\n\n\n-----\n\n154.221.24.47/HaQ3\n\n## File Hashes\n\n165F8683681A4B136BE1F9D6EA7F00CE\n9FF1D3AF1F39A37C0DC4CEEB18CC37DC\n4FE276EDC21EC5F2540C2BABD81C8653\n43067F28DC5208D4A070CF3CC92E29FB\n11ADDA734FC67B9CFDF61396DE984559\n08F25A641E8361495A415C763FBB9B71\n01D74E6D9F77D5202E7218FA524226C4\n6198D625ADA7389AAC276731CDEBB500\n9B39E1F72CF4ACFFD45F45F08483ABF0\n748DE2B2AA1FA23FA5996F287437AF1B\n5F094CB3B92524FCED2731C57D305E78\n9A180107EFB15A00E64DB3CE6394328D\n05CF906B750EB335125695DA42F4EAFC\nF62DFC4999D624D01E94B89946EC1036\nCA775717D000888A7F71A5907B9C9208\nAA115F20472E78A068C1BBF739C443BF\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1] Adam Meyers, “Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for June: MUSTANG PANDA,”\n\nCrowdStrike Blog, accessed September 17, 2019, published June 15, 2018,\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustangpanda/.\n\n\n\n[2] Ibid.\n\n[3] Ibid.\n\n[4] Dr. Joop de Wit, “Decentralisation, Local Governance and Community Participation in\n\nVietnam,” United Nations (2016): 5, accessed September 18, 2019,\nhttp://www.un.org.vn/en/publications/one-un-documents/cat_view/106-one-un-documents/124reference-documents.html.\n\n\n\n[5] Kathy Wilheml, “China, Vietnam Make Money, Not War;
