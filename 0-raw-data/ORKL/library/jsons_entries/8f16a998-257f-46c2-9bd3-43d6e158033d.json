This cyberattack caused a\nsignificant amount of damage to the affected organizations by wiping the hard drives of tens of thousands of computers.\n\nMcAfee Labs research provides further insight into the likely source of these attacks. Though not definitive, our analysis\nprovides a much clearer picture. The research also indicates that there may have been two distinct groups, attacking\ndifferent targets.\n\nOur analysis of this attack—known first as Dark Seoul and now as Operation Troy—has revealed that in addition to the\ndata losses of the MBR wiping, the incident was more than cybervandalism. The attacks on South Korean targets were\nactually the conclusion of a covert espionage campaign.\n\nAttack Timeline\nOur analysis suggests the following order of these attacks. Later in this report we mention other elements that color our\nview of this event, but consistent throughout is our belief that the attackers had access to the environments prior to\nlaunching the wiping component.\n\nMarch 20 attack against banks and news agencies in South Korea:\n\n1. The remote-access Trojan was compiled January 26, 2013.\n2. The component to wipe the master boot record (MBR) of numerous systems was compiled January 31.\n3. An initial victim within the organization was spear-phished with the remote-access Trojan. This likely occurred before\nMarch 20, and possibly weeks prior to the attack.\n4. The dropper was compiled March 20, hours before the attack occurred.\n5. The dropper was distributed to systems across the victim organizations, and within minutes of execution the MBRs\nwere wiped. This occurred around 2:00 pm Seoul time on March 20.\n\nState Sponsorship or Cyberterrorism?\nWho conducted these attacks is still unclear, but our research gives some further insight into the likely source. The clues\nleft behind confirm that the two groups claiming responsibility were a fabrication to throw investigators off the trail and to\nmask the true source.\n\nThe adversaries\n\nThe two groups that appear to have been involved in the attacks have had no prior connection until now.\n\n- _NewRomanic Cyber Army Team. The samples connected to this group are more convincing. The majority of the wipers_\n(found in the wild and retrieved from infected systems through other sources) contain the strings “principes” and\n“hastati,” which also appear in a message left on one of the targeted websites in the form of a web pop-up. The wiper\ncomponent also overwrote the MBR with one of these strings. The following data points support this fact:\n\n–– The strings “principes”[1] and “hastati”[2] were found within the code of some of the wiper components. The same\nstrings were also found in the web pop-up message that was left on the Nocut News Korea website. The strings are\nancient Roman terms that make reference to military units, hence a “cyberarmy.” The pop-up even states some of the\nspecific units that were part of hastati which were involved in this attack.\n\n–– The remote-access Trojan that was found had a build path which included the reference “Make Troy,” a subdirectory\nof the folder “Work.” Troy [3] refers to an ancient Roman region, again connecting the Roman references to this group,\nwhich consistently uses this theme.\n\n\n-----\n\n- _The Whois Hacking Team. On March 20, the website of the network provider LG +U was defaced by this group. Was_\nit a coincidence that a second group was involved? All of the evidence indicates that they had a strong involvement,\nbut there is no solid link to the group because it did not claim involvement in the attacks. However, we do have\nthe circumstantial link of a wiper component that in practice operated differently from the wipers employed by the\nNewRomanic Cyber Army yet also appears to be essentially the same wiper. The Whois Hacking Team MBR wiper\ncomponent includes the same graphics (in a resource file in the binary) that appeared on the defaced LG +U website,\nalthough the malware did not behave the same way. Within the main executable file, however, we discovered a small\nportion of the code that matched the structure of that of the NewRomanic Cyber Army wipers we found, so the Whois\nTeam likely dropped the same wiper.\n\nState sponsored or not, these attacks were crippling nonetheless. The overall tactics were not that sophisticated in\ncomparison to what we have seen before. The trend seems to be moving toward using the following techniques\nagainst targets:\n\n- Stealing and holding data hostage and announcing the theft. Public news media have reported only that tens of\nthousands of computers had their MBRs wiped by the malware. But there is more to this story: The main group behind\nthe attack claims that a vast amount of personal information has been stolen. This type of tactic is consistent with\nAnonymous operations and others that fall within the hacktivist category, in which they announce and leak portions of\nconfidential information.\n\n- Wiping the MBR to render systems unusable, creating an instant slowdown to operations within the target\n\nThe Analysis\nWhat were the motives behind these attacks and why did the attackers chose certain targets? The attacks managed to\ncreate a significant disruption of ATM networks while denying access to funds. This wasn’t the first time that this type of\nattack—in which destructive malware wiped the systems belonging to a financial institution—has occurred in South Korea.\nIn 2011 the same financial institution was hit with destructive malware that caused a denial of service.\n\nThe attackers left a calling card a day after the attacks in the form of a web pop-up message claiming that the NewRomanic\nCyber Army Team was responsible and had leaked private information from several banks and media companies.\n\nThey also referenced destroying the data on a large number of machines (the MBR wiping) and left a message in the web\npop-up identifying the group behind the attacks. The page title in Internet Explorer was “Hey, Everybody in Korea????”\n\n“Hi, Dear Friends, We are very happy to inform you the following news. We, NewRomanic Cyber Army Team, verified our\n#OPFuckKorea2003. We have now a great deal of personal information in our hands. Those includes; 2.49M of    _\nmember table data, cms_info more than 50M from                                 . Much information from\nBank. We destroyed more than 0.18M of PCs.

Please also visit pastebin.com.”\n\nThe Malware\nA few types of malware were involved in these attacks. Each variant had a particular use. Some public reports mentioned\nonly the use of the wiper component; however, there were actually three components, all with a different purpose, that\nassisted the attackers in the campaign.\n\nComponent Purpose File Size Compile Date\n\n\nDropper Trojan Installs the MBR wiper 418KB March 20, 2013\n\nMBR Wiper Wipes the MBR of the disk 24KB January 31, 2013\n\nRemote-Access Trojan Provides backdoor access to attackers 46KB January 26, 2013\n\n\nTable 1: Elements of the attack on South Korean targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were two subsequent aspects to this attack:\n\n- The destruction of PCs using the MBR wiper component. Occurred March 20.\n\n- Remote access to the targets’ environments for a period prior to the attack. The duration of this access is unknown.\n\nThe dropper Trojan\n\nThe dropper Trojan was primarily used to download the executable that destroyed the systems’ MBRs. We suspect that the\ndropper Trojan was distributed at the time of the attacks via a compromised patch-management server that pretended to\nrun a legitimate update.\n\nThe dropper Trojan was compiled March 20, the day of the attack and several hours prior to the destruction of the\nsystems. We suspect that the attackers had access to the target environment prior to March 20. It is unlikely that a large\nvolume of users (some 30,000+) were spear-phished on March 20 alone.\n\nIt’s likely a much earlier compromise led to the attacks’ being staged internally. Thus, there was an initial victim whose\ninfected system allowed the attackers to gain access to other systems that let them distribute the malware broadly.\nThe initial infection certainly could have come from a spear-phishing attack. The backdoor component was compiled in\nlate January. The attackers could have been inside the networks since February. This timeline is plausible given that the\nattackers claim to have stolen a vast amount of information from these networks prior to wiping the MBRs.\n\nOur further analysis led us to discover additional components that support our conclusion:\n\n- A remote-access Trojan was discovered to have compromised some of the target environments, specifically an internal\nserver used to distribute updates to thousands of PCs. This Trojan variant was compiled January 26, and was detected by\nthe security industry on March 25. McAfee detects this threat as RDN/Generic PWS.y!io. This Trojan was built with the\nMicrosoft Visual C++ Version 2.9 compiler with a file size of 47KB.\n\nMBR wiper\n\nWe have seen several wiper samples to date; all were compiled January 31. The wiper itself is relatively small (24KB) and is\nintroduced into the environment via a dropper Trojan that is 418KB and was compiled the day of the attacks.\n\nUpon executing the malware, the main dropper (9263e40d9823aecf9388b64de34eae54) creates the file AgentBase.exe,\nthe MBR wiper component. This file is placed in the infected user’s application data folder, executes, and immediately\nstarts the countdown to wipe the system and render it unbootable. This file was compiled approximately two months prior\nto the attack’s taking place.\n\nThe main dropper component was compiled the day of the attack, March 20, at 4:07 am Seoul time. The dropper installed\nthe wiper, which destroyed the MBRs at around 2:00 pm Seoul time. Once the dropper executed, the system were wiped\nwithin minutes. Thus, these components likely weren’t distributed until the time when the attackers wished to destroy\nthese machines.\n\nThe remote-access Trojan\n\nIt’s not widely known that the attackers used a remote-access Trojan to compromise an internal server. The attackers used\nthis internal server to distribute the wiper component to the thousands of PCs. The remote-access Trojan had a file size of\n46KB and was compiled on January 26, five days before the MBR wiper was compiled.\n\nAs we concluded earlier, we have determined that the attackers had access to the environment prior to wiping the\nsystems. The remote-access Trojan was likely delivered to an internal PC via a spear-phishing campaign. From this system\nthe attackers accessed other internal resources. The Trojan was designed to operate within Internet Explorer; it launched a\nhidden instance of Internet Explorer and injected itself into the running process.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The process monitor shows the remote-access Trojan spawning an instance of Internet Explorer.\n\nThe Trojan immediately modified the properties in the registry to allow for remote connections to the system.\n\nLinking to the Attackers\nLinking malware to its developers isn’t always an easy task. Most attackers are careful enough to ensure they can’t be\ntraced. This is especially important in cases such as cyberespionage, in which the intent is to remain invisible.\n\nIn our analysis we observed a number of unique attributes in the components involved in these attacks; these markers\nallowed us to link specific samples to a specific group.\n\nTwo groups have taken credit for these attacks, but we can tell that the variants which wiped the systems link to the\nNewRomanic Cyber Army Team.\n\nAlthough the Whois Hacking Team is more public due to its defacement of the network provider LG +U’s website, we can\nlink this group to only one sample of a wiper, which operates differently than the others. The Whois wiper is much larger,\nwith a file size of 236KB and was compiled March 19, whereas the other wiper components are a mere 24KB. The larger\nsize suggests the Whois wiper contains more functions. Thus, we can definitively link NewRomanic to the samples used\nto wipe the MBRs of systems within the South Korean financial institution networks. NewRomanic will remain the prime\nsuspect involved in the attacks.\n\nConfirming the link between NewRomanic and known wiper samples, we found a number of wiper samples contained\neither the string “hastati” or “principes” in the calling cards left by the attacker.\n\nSample MD5 Compilation Date Detection Name\n\n\ndb4bbdc36a78a8807ad9b15a562515c4 January 31, 2013 KillMBR-FBIA\n\n5fcd6e1dace6b0599429d913850f0364 January 31, 2013 KillMBR-FBIA\n\nf0e045210e3258dad91d7b6b4d64e7f3 January 31, 2013 KillMBR-FBIA\n\n\nTable 2: Wiper samples connected to the NewRomanic Cyber Army Team.\n\n\n-----\n\nNot only did most of the wiper samples link to NewRomanic, but the remote-access Trojan can also be linked to the group.\nThe Trojan contained a build path that mentions Troy in the directory path, again consistent with the ancient Roman\nreferences used by this group.\n\nFigure 2. The remote-access Trojan names Troy. This reference links the attack to the NewRomanic Cyber Army Team.\n\nCode Analysis\nIt is highly unusual that two groups claim responsibility for these attacks. No further information has been revealed as\nto who they are or what their motivations are; this is another reason to suspect that these two groups are the same and\nare actually fabricated. The supporting evidence comes in the form of code analysis determining the degree of similarity\nbetween the samples.\n\nThe Whois Hacking Team sample was compiled March 19 at 1:57 pm local time and the NewRomanic dropper was\ncompiled March 20 at 4:07 am local time. The attacks on South Korean banks and media and the defacement of LG +U\noccurred approximately 2:00 pm local time on March 20.\n\nMcAfee Labs investigated the differences between the two samples at a code level to determine if there were any\nsimilarities. In spite of the fact that the wiper component originating from NewRomanic Cyber Army Team was 24KB in\nsize and the component from Whois was 236KB, we did find similarities within the code. The Whois sample is a dropper\nfor a component that closely resembles the one used by the NewRomanic Cyber Army. We found a significant number\nof matching subroutines and a large number of code segments with only minor differences. These similarities lead us to\nconclude that the payload code is based upon the same initial code and was embedded into different droppers.\n\nWhois Sample NewRomanic Sample # of Different Functions\n\n_alloca_probe _alloca_probe exact match\n\nsub_4078C0 loc_40291F 15\n\nsub_4030A0 loc_302f40 17\n\nloc_404f54 loc_403169 1\n\nloc_4033a1 loc_4084ee exact match\n\nloc_4065f4 loc_403694 exact match\n\nstart sub_401870 131\n\nsub_402D02 sub_407BC9 0\n\nsub_407c7a sub_402DB3 10\n\nsub_4083F5 sub_40327D 4\n\nsub_403770 sub_409980 exact match\n\nTable 3: Partial analysis of subroutine differences.\n\nRevealing “Operation Troy”\nPersistent espionage campaign in South Korea: 2009–2013\n\nPublic reports covering what is known as the Dark Seoul incident, which occurred on March 20, 2013, addressed only the\nMBR wiper components. Many of the details of this incident have been examined, and most analysts conclude this was an\nisolated, though clearly coordinated, attack. However, McAfee Labs has found that there was more to the incident than\nwhat was widely reported. Our analysis has revealed a covert espionage campaign.\n\nTypically this sort of advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign has targeted a number of sectors in various countries, but\nOperation Troy, as these attacks are now called, targets solely South Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom our analysis of unique attributes within the malware samples we have determined that the initial code behind the\n“Troy” family of Trojans was created in 2010, as was another component that was dropped by the Trojan HTTP Troy. The\nmalware used in these attacks were compiled to specifically target South Korea and used Korean-language resources in\nthe binaries. The malware connected to legitimate Korean domains that were running a bulletin board and sent a specific\ncommand to a PHP page to establish an IRC channel and receive commands.\n\nEspionage Campaign\n\n\nOperation Troy—Domestic Spying Period\n\n\nDark Seoul\n\n\nMarch 20,\n2010 2011 2012 2013\n2013\n\nHTTP Troy Http Dr0pper Concealment Troy\n\nEagleXP Mail Attack Tong MBR Wiper\n\n3Rat Client\n\nTDrop\n\n10 Days of Rain Media/Broadcast\nAttacks\n\nSuspected Link\n\n\nFinancial Industry\nAttacks\n\n\nSolid Link\n\nHighly Probable Link\n\n\nFigure 3. The targeted attack Dark Seoul reached its culmination in March 2013, but its roots go back at least to 2009, when the Trojan’s\nsource code was first compiled. Subsequent variations of the malware have also been involved in these threats.\n\nMcAfee Labs has determined that domestic espionage activities occurred before the March 20 attacks, most likely to gain\nintelligence regarding the targets to carry out further attacks (such as the March 20 incident) or to benefit the attackers in\nsome other ways. This spying operation had remained hidden and only now has been discovered through diligent research\nand collaboration. We also suspect the attackers had knowledge of the security software running within the environment\nbefore they wiped the systems, given that some of the variants used in the attack were made to look as if they were\nantimalware update files from before March 20.\n\nThe attackers who conducted the operation remained hidden for a number of years prior to the March 20 incident by\nusing a variety of custom tools. Our investigation into Dark Seoul has found a long-term domestic spying operation\nunderway since at least 2009. The operation, all based on the same code, has attempted to infiltrate specific South\nKorean targets. We call this Operation Troy, based on the frequent use of the word Troy in the compile path strings in\nthe malware. The prime suspect group in these attacks is the New Romanic Cyber Army Team, which makes frequent\nuse of Roman and classical terms in their code. While analyzing malware components from before the March 20 incident\nwe found both similar and identical attributes of the files involved that enable us to link them to the 3Rat remote\nadministration tool client used on March 20 as well as to samples dating to 2010. Furthermore, we determined that\nthrough prior access to the victims’ networks, the attackers were able to upload the MBR wiper component and distribute\nit. It is also possible that the campaign known as 10 Days of Rain is a byproduct of Operation Troy; some of our analysis\nsuggests that the malware Concealment Troy was present in these attacks.\n\nTools and tactics\n\nNSTAR: 2010–2011\nNSTAR appears to be the first production version of the Troy family. This Trojan is based upon malware created for a\nmilitary espionage campaign that first emerged in 2009. NSTAR is the first to use components in the same way that later\nvariants of the Troy family do. It included a shared DLL (bs.dll) that was found in the 2010 and 2011 variants. Later variants\nuse a modified version, HTTPSecurityProvider.dll, which employs nearly the same file-mapping function as used by bs.dll.\nMost of these variants are compiled from the Work directory; that’s fairly consistent throughout all versions. The DLL was\ncompiled using Microsoft Visual C++ Version 6. Those iterations were found in 2010-2011.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe call graph generated for NSTAR’s bs.dll is identical with that of HTTP Troy. They were compiled at least a year apart\nfrom each other.\n\nFigure 4. Call graph for bs.dll from the NSTAR variant of the Troy Trojan.\n\nFigure 5. Call graph for bs.dll from the HTTP Troy variant.\n\nThe DLL was compiled March 3, 2011, and includes an OCX component that was compiled in late 2010. The OCX used a\nvery different compile path, but bs.dll, the backdoor, is essentially the same as those seen in later versions.\n\nThe Work directory, with path shown below, is also used with Troy variants Concealment Troy and 3Rat Client, which were\nboth compiled in 2013.\n\nE:\\Work\\BackUp\\2011\\nstar 1103\\BackDoor\\BsDll-up\\Release\\BsDll.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found a file-mapping function in this variant similar to those in most of the newer versions. The unique string\nbeginning with “FFFFFFF” is identical and occurs throughout the later variants.\n\nFigure 6. NSTAR’s file-mapping function.\n\nThe malware establishes an IRC channel to receive real-time commands in the same manner as the military\nespionage malware.\n\nFigure 7. NSTAR communicates with its control server via HTTP as its primary channel.\n\nChang and EagleXP: 2010\nAnother variant from 2010, EagleXP, is closely related to NSTAR and HTTP Troy based on reused components. EagleXP\nused this compile path:\n\nD:\\VMware\\eaglexp(Backup)\\eaglexp\\vmshare\\Work\\BsDll-up\\Release\\BsDll.pdb\n\nAgain we see the Work directory involved as in the other post-2010 malware used in this campaign. A variant compiled\nMay 27, 2010, also contained a very similar compile path. We were able to obtain some traffic from the control server.\n\nD:\\\\Chang\\\\vmshare\\\\Work\\\\BsDll-up\\\\Release\\\\BsDll.pdb\n\nThe May 27 variant, called Chang, operated in the same manner as other Troy variants and used the same bs.dll. A Korean\nmanufacturing website hosted both the control server and an IRC server.\n\nFigure 8. Outbound traffic from an infected system.\n\nFigure 9. The malware establishes a channel with the control server via IRC.\n\nBoth the Chang and EagleXP variants are based on the same code that created NSTAR and later Troy variants. These\nsimilarities confirm the attackers have operated for more than three years against South Korean targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nInside the IRC botnet\n\nTroy Botnet\n\nSujewha.com Traveler.foxlink.com\n\nNowq.net\n\nToneharbor.com\n\nDong.a.jp Hanja.edu.com Qitaegyo.com Babcom-h1.bluethunder.co\n\nHTTP Lawbookcenter.co.kr\nTroy Solarshare.co.kr\n\nHttp\nDr0pper Delmundo.kr\nByonshop.com\n\nDochang.pe.kr Theumin.net\n\nGcglobal.com\n\nTong\n\nNSTAR\n\nTDrop\n\nApsumo.co.kr\n\nConcealment\nTroy Mupa.co.kr\n\nFigure 10. The malware family and its control servers.\n\nDuring our investigation we dug into the attackers’ controlling botnet, which was used until 2013. The infrastructure\nrelied upon on a network of hacked South Korean websites hosting IRC servers. The infected clients in turn communicated\nwith the IRC servers using RSA encryption and used functions imported from the Microsoft Cryptography API library.\n\nFigure 11. Some functions imported from the Microsoft Cryptography API.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers hardcoded the control domains in bs.dll and distributed it in the final compiled Trojan code. Each variant\nof each generation of Trojans contained different hardcoded strings pertaining to the control servers. This shows that\nthe attackers first compromised the future IRC server sites and then compiled the component and distributed it to\ninfected targets.\n\nFigure 12. Hardcoded addresses in bs.dll.\n\nThe nickname for the bot can be determined by the outbound traffic and information written to the Windows registry. One\nvariant operating in June 2010 used the nickname BS^000C2918AB11 with the password wodehaopeng. The malware\njoined the IRC channel #god and sent several private messages to what was likely the control server to receive instructions.\n\nPRIVMSG X^111112352643[1] :\n\nA5TbaKuqCO641tirNl51rFLdNHeUhMbUiJ93sO5rip9X7AZG0Y8rlZVmItEEfDrmNL19OpJrv2khO5WbflTqxs7FVgzUNfdvtnjbObWeNNVPlF/yXPQIEDj/4YnidGDAq\n\np7m8lFpnC2Pyz2+6OOooEUMqG6rKImyFQLM/V7K69E=\n\nVariant Bot IRC Nickname\n\nHttp Dr0pper YN^000E0C3CB868\n\nHTTP Troy B9^E02E29C4\n\nTDrop TE02E29C\n\nNSTAR H^E02E29C4\n\nTong CO^000E0C2892FA\n\nEagleXP B3^000C2918AB11\n\nChang X^000C295C5DEC\n\nTable 4: IRC bot nicknames used by variants.\n\nHTTP Troy: 2011\nIn 2011 the attackers created the Trojan HTTP Troy, named from its compile path string; this was the first of the Troy family\nof Trojans. To date we have found only one sample of HTTP Troy. Upon execution the malware launches a crippled GUI\nthat allows the victim to install a screen saver displaying politically sensitive images. We don’t know why the developers\ntook the risk of making the Trojan visible. The screensaver component (chonanship.scr) is not malicious and was compiled\non December 12, 2010. It contained images related to the sinking of the South Korean Navy ship Cheonan.[4] HTTP Troy\nwas compiled on March 20, 2011, and contained the compile path Z:\\source\\1\\HttpTroy\\BsDll-up\\Release\\BsDll.pdb. As we\ncan see, HTTP Troy uses the same DLL as the NSTAR, Chang, and EagleXP variants did in 2010. This path was contained in\na dropped DLL component that was used to establish a hidden IRC channel to the attackers’ control server. The primary\ndropper file for this remote-access Trojan was disguised as AhnLab’s Smart Update Utility setup program. The original\nfilename was SUpdate.exe.\n\nAfter executing, the remote-access Trojan makes a connection to sujewha.com, the IRC control server.\n\nFigure 13. HTTP Troy communicates with its control server via IRC.\n\n\n-----\n\nHttp Dr0pper: 2012\nWe found a second-generation Trojan based on HTTP Troy that included the compile path Z:\\1Mission\\Team_Project\\\n\n[2012.6~]\\HTTP Troy\\HttpDr0pper\\Win32\\Release. This Trojan, Http Dr0pper, was compiled in 2012 from the HTTP Troy\ndirectory, indicating it is an advancement of the original HTTP Troy.\n\nAll of the variants from this point reuse a specific DLL, which in some instances is named HTTPSecurityProvider.dll and uses\nthe Microsoft Cryptography API to secure communications. We can track the reuse of this DLL based on the consistent\nfile‑mapping function that appears throughout the variants.\n\nFigure 14. The malware Http Dr0pper using the same file-mapping function and DLL as other versions.\n\nWe can determine that another variant, Tong (based on the directory in which it was compiled), also reuses this DLL and\ncontains the same function.\n\nFigure 15. The malware Tong using the same file-mapping function and DLL as other versions.\n\nFurthermore, variants such as Concealment Troy that were compiled in 2013 contain the same function once decoded.\nStill, some of the base code is reused in the supporting DLL for Concealment Troy.\n\nFigure 16. The malware Concealment Troy using the same function (encoded function shown).\n\nAfter execution the Trojan makes a connection to the control server using specific parameters that include the IRC\nnickname. This communication pattern is consistent with other variants that reference Troy.\n\nFigure 17.

It also communicated using the same methods. This Trojan was compiled on August 28, 2012.\n\nFigure 18.

TDrop uses one of two DLL files, payload32.dll and payload64.dll, and injects\none, depending on operating system, into svchost.exe. Previous versions used bs.dll, which contained the code for\ncommunicating with the IRC botnet. TDrop has some further functionality not present in HTTP Troy that extends this\nTrojan’s ability to operate on 64-bit machines and to evade automated analysis systems and emulation technologies.\n\nThe evasion routines check for the presence of debuggers and tracers that attach to the parent process. This effectively\ncauses the parent process to immediately terminate when under analysis by emulation or sandboxing systems that attempt\nto hook and monitor API calls coming from that process.\n\nFigure 19. The antidebugging feature in payload32.dll.\n\nFurthermore, TDrop uses a DLL to run under nonprivileged accounts on Windows 7. This variant was compiled on January\n15, 2013, and contained the compile path D:\\Work\\Op\\Mission\\TeamProject\\[2012.11~12]\\TDrop\\Dropper32\\Release\\\nDropper.pdb. The main executable, which extracts the other components, was compiled from the path Z:\\Work\\v3zip\\\nmisc.c and Z:\\Work\\v3unzip.c. This is likely a compression tool to extract the files to the desktop.\n\nJust as Http Dr0pper, TDrop uses the disguised dropper component AhnlabUpdate.exe. The unique code is nearly identical\nto that used in Http Dr0pper with the exception of the last two characters.\n\nFigure 20. TDrop reusing code from Http Dr0pper.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the main Trojan file executes, it launches RunCmd.exe, which itself doesn’t appear to be malicious. RunCmd.exe\nthen launches AhnlabUpdate.exe based on the specified filename in the associated RunCmd.ini file. These files are created\nin the directory 114719_507_AhnlabUpdateKit, which sits in a temp directory created on the desktop. It is obvious that\nthe attackers were aware of the security product that the target environment used and attempted to make the malware\nappear as legitimate as possible. AhnlabUpdate drops and runs an additional executable, which is the RAT payload that\nestablishes a connection with the control server.\n\nMain.EXE\n\nRunCmd.exe\n\nAhnlabUpdate.exe\n\n~ERC6C8.tmp\n\nFigure 21.

This version was compiled from the same directory as the\n3Rat client found in the victims’ environments on March 20. Some components from Concealment Troy suggest that the\nsource code was originally written in 2010 and was later compiled for use in this campaign. The 64-bit component to install\nthe backdoor on the victims’ systems contains an interesting compile path and was first created on November 28, 2012.\n\nC:\\test\\BD_Installer_2010\\x64\\Release\\BD_Installer_2010.pdb\n\nThe 32-bit version was compiled January 23, 2013, and contained this compile path:\n\nZ:\\\\Work\\\\Make Troy\\\\Concealment Troy\\\\Exe_Concealment_Troy(Winlogon_Shell)\\\\SetKey_WinlogOn_Shell_Modify\\\\BD_Installer\\\\Release\\\\BD_Installer.pdb\n\nCompile Date\nComponent Compile Path\n(all 2013)\n\nBDInstaller1 Z:\\\\Work\\\\Make Troy\\\\Concealment Troy\\\\Exe_Concealment_Troy(Winlogon_Shell)\\\\SetKey_WinlogOn_Shell_Modify\\\\ January 23\nBD_Installer\\\\Release\\\\BD_Installer.pdb\n\nBackdoorEXE Z:\\\\Work\\\\Make Troy\\\\Concealment Troy\\\\Exe_Concealment_Troy(Winlogon_Shell)\\\\Concealment_Troy(exe)\\\\Release\\\\ February 4\nConcealment_Troy.pdb\n\nBackdoorDLL Z:\\\\Work\\\\Make Troy\\\\Concealment Troy\\\\Exe_Concealment_Troy(Winlogon_Shell)\\\\Dll\\\\Concealment_Troy(Dll)\\\\ February 22\nRelease\\\\Concealment_Troy.pdb\n\nBDInstaller2 Z:\\\\Work\\\\Make Troy\\\\Concealment Troy\\\\Exe_Concealment_Troy(Winlogon_Shell)\\\\SetKey_WinlogOn_Shell_Modify\\\\ February 22\nBD_Installer\\\\Release\\\\BD_Installer.pdb\n\nMainDropper2 None February 22\n\nMainDropper3 None February 23\n\nTable 6: Compilation timeline for Concealment Troy.\n\n\n-----\n\nConcealment Troy does not employ real-time IRC control as earlier versions did. (Concealment Troy is a typical\nHTTP botnet.)\n\nFigure 22. Concealment Troy abandons the use of IRC for real-time control and uses HTTP as its primary channel.\n\nMilitary Espionage Malware: 2009–2013\nMcAfee Labs has uncovered a sophisticated military spying network targeting South Korea that has been in operation\nsince 2009. Our analysis shows this network is connected to the Dark Seoul incident. Furthermore, we have also\ndetermined that a single group has been behind a series of threats targeting South Korea since October 2009. In this\ncase the adversary had designed a sophisticated encrypted network designed to gather intelligence on military networks.\nWe have confirmed cases of Trojans operating through these networks in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013. This network\nwas designed to camouflage all communications between the infected systems and the control servers via the Microsoft\nCryptography API using RSA 128-bit encryption. Everything extracted from these military networks would be transmitted\nover this encrypted network once the malware identified interesting information. What makes this case particularly\ninteresting is the use of automated reconnaissance tools to identify what specific military information internal systems\ncontained before the attackers tried to grab any of the files.\n\nAugust 21, 2010 October 21, 2009\nMilitary Attacks Military Attacks\n\ntake.chu.jp seung.us sarangbang.us christkingchurch.us\n\nJanuary 13, 2013 February 28, 2011\nMilitary Attacks Military Attacks\n\ndjuna.cine21.com strider.pe.kr dochang.pe.kr kairoshairstory.com.au ejiweb.com dennisoneil.net daeilho.net\n\nFigure 23.

(The attacker placed a zero-day exploit on a military social networking site.) Later cases were likely spear\nphishing to more quickly get to the right targets.\n\n- Malware automatically performs recon on target systems looking for documents of interest. Malware can also scrape out\npasswords and registry information along with directory listing of interesting files.\n\n- The attacker can request directory contents from infected systems based on the number of interesting files found. Can\nselectively grab specific files as needed.\n\n- Stolen files are transmitted via HTTP-encrypted channel to the attacker’s server.\n\nThe encrypted network\n\nThe attacker’s encrypted network uses Microsoft’s Cryptography API library Version 1.0 to encrypt communication\nchannels to the control servers over both HTTP and IRC. The encryption uses a 128-bit RSA key, shown as imported and\nused by the following code.\n\nFigure 24. Function to call the Cryptography API library.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. RSA encryption key used to camouflage communications.\n\nThis network operates over both HTTP and uses IRC as secondary channel for real-time operations. The IRC network is based\non the open-source library libircclient[5] and everything sent over this IRC channel is encrypted via the Cryptography API.\n\nFigure 26. Establishing an IRC channel session.\n\nThe following commands are supported by IRC to control infected systems in real time. This functionality enables the\nattacker to send and receive files on demand and execute remote commands. The messages sent between client and\nservers are base64 encoded and then encrypted using the Cryptography API; thus a message must be decoded and\ndecrypted to be visible. This highly sophisticated method provides for great flexibility over a secure encrypted channel\nthat is not SSL.\n\n- Get bot version and uptime\n\n- Get directory file listing, all drives or from specific path\n\n- Stop activities for a given period\n\n- Download file\n\n- Send local file to the server\n\n- Execute shell command\n\n- Connect to IRC server\n\n- Change nick (IRC)\n\n- Join channel (IRC)\n\n- IRC disconnect\n\n- Remove bot from system\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27. Functions for IRC commands.\n\nThe HTTP portion is designed to get configuration data used in the IRC botnet and to send stolen documents back to the\ncontrol server.\n\nFigure 28. HTTP Get command with parameters.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. HTTP Get command continued.\n\nFigure 30. HTTP Get command continued.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe encrypted network operates by scanning infected systems and categorizing those systems that contain interesting\ndocuments. The malware does not extract every document that is found as a match through drive scanning; rather it\nassigns a unique signature to the infected system according to what it contains. Less interesting systems are less likely to\nhave documents extracted from them. The directory contents are uploaded to the attacker’s server, which lets the attacker\ngrab documents at will and keeps the amount of network traffic low.\n\nData exfiltration\n\nThe theft of classified information is the primary purpose of this network and would occur through drive scanning.\n\nDrive scanning locates classified information on target systems and gives the attacker an overall idea of what these military\nnetworks have. The malware searches the root disk, counts the number of interesting files, and determines the level of\nthat system’s importance to the attacker. The search criteria are primarily specific file extensions and keywords in document\ntitles. The keywords are all military specific. Some refer to specific military units and programs that operate in South Korea.\nThis function would determine only the number of interesting files that are contained on any given system; another\nfunction would extract the list of files that match these search criteria.\n\nFigure 31. The drive scan function.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to searching for English keywords, the function searches for Korean ASCII characters that represent a subset of\nmilitary terms. Most keywords specific to military operations in South Korea are in English. There is also a set of abbreviations.\n\nFigure 32. Google translation of ASCII characters.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe files to be sent to the attacker’s server are zipped using the open-source Zip Utils.[6] The component uses the password\n“dkwero38oerA^t@#.” We have consistently found this password in the malware dating back to 2009. It is used primarily\nto archive items to be stolen from infected systems.\n\nFigure 33. The function to zip stolen documents.\n\nThe DLL relationship\n\nIn all of these threats we have seen the consistent use of bs.dll, a stripped down version of ip6ld.dll, which we have found\nin the military espionage cases. We can connect not only similar functions within bs.dll from 2011 to date with those of\nthe military cases in 2009 and 2010, but also the shared encryption key for zipping classified information to be sent to the\ncontrol server.\n\nThis ip6ld.dll is the same as another file, ~81923.dll; both operate in the same manner. Bs.dll appears to be used primarily\nfor IRC botnet communications.\n\nThe component bs.dll has been seen in a number of Troy-era malware samples: Chang, EagleXP, NSTAR, Mail Attack,\nHTTP Troy, Tong, Http Dr0pper, etc. The file Ip6ld.dll, which contains much of the logic described in these attacks, shares\na number of common functions with bs.dll, including the zip encryption password. In addition, the IRC and encryption\nfunctions are the same in both files, indicating they were built by the same individual or group. The two functions are likely\nthe same source code in different versions. The primary difference between them is bs.dll’s lack of searching for specific\nextensions and terms that Ip6ld.dll and ~81923.dll contain. This suggests bs.dll requires a second module and we have\nseen that with the Mail Attack variant, compiled in February 2011, which contained both bs.dll and payload.dll, with the\nlatter containing the military-specific search and extraction functions.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 34. The bs.dll function to scan all drives based on a specified extension.\n\nThe following function found in bs.dll lists the contents of specified directories and zips those contents into an archive file\nwith a password. This function doesn’t have any criteria and is likely disabled in some cases, such as with HTTP Troy, which\ndownloads a payload module to search for data.\n\nFigure 35. A bs.dll function to list and send directory contents.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 36. A bs.dll function to send directory contents to remote server.\n\nPayload.dll appears to combine both drive searching and directory listing into a single function. A separate action puts the\ndirectory contents into a separate file and prepares it to be sent to the remote server.\n\nFigure 37. A payload.dll drive-search function.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38. A function to zip contents.\n\n\n-----\n\nRelationships to Http Dr0pper\n\nWe have determined that some variants of Http Dr0pper will execute payload32.dll, which is essentially the same DLL\nthat is found in TDrop. This component contains military keywords. One variant of Http Dr0pper made use of payload32.\ndll, which was compiled on August 23, 2012. The TDrop version was compiled January 13, 2013. This consistency\nconfirms further that the operations against South Korea are primarily focused on military intelligence gathering and have\nattempted to break in since 2009.\n\nDestroying the target\n\nThe espionage malware has the capability to destroy systems in the same way that the March 20, 2013, attacks disabled\nthousands of systems in South Korea. This capability could be devastating if military networks were to suddenly be wiped\nafter an adversary had gathered intelligence. This was clearly the case with the March 20 Dark Seoul incident, in which we\nconfirmed that the 3Rat Trojan gained access prior to the MBR-wiping event. There was at least one limitation, however:\nWe found the malware of February 2011 could wipe its targets only if it detected that it was being debugged or analyzed\nby a security product.\n\nFigure 39. The malware’s function to wipe the MBR.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaigns\n\nThrough our research we have discovered a number of distinct subcampaigns as part of the overall Operation Troy, which\nhas targeted military forces in South Korea to extract classified information. These operations were designed to occur in\n2009 through 2013. Recently we uncovered evidence to suggest that they continued just prior to Dark Seoul. We can link\nthe actor(s) responsible for Dark Seoul to these particular espionage campaigns through various technical means.\n\n- The Troy-era malware is based on the same source code to create these specialized versions (components shared over\nthe years).\n\n- The zip encryption password is found in almost all instances, with the exception of Concealment Troy.\n\n- Consistent terms in the malware compile paths (for example, Troy, Work, etc.).\n\n- The same IRC botnet channel and encryption method are used throughout the variants.\n\n- Military keywords are consistently found through the components spanning 2009–2013, confirming the intent of\nthis adversary.\n\n- Use of the same string-obfuscation techniques in the 2009–2010 campaigns and the 2012–2013 campaigns.\n\n|dkwero38oerA^t@#|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||\n\n\nMail Attack HTTP Troy NSTAR Chang EagleXP Http Dr0pper Tong TDrop\n\n|Chang|EagleXP|Http Dr0pper|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nFigure 40. Shared encryption password.\n\nConclusion\nMcAfee Labs can connect the Dark Seoul and other government attacks to a secret, long-term campaign that reveals the\ntrue intention of the Dark Seoul adversaries: attempting to spy on and disrupt South Korea’s military and government\nactivities. The Troy-era malware is based on the same source code used to create these specialized variants and shares\nmany commonalities, such as bs.dll and payload.dll, which are found consistently throughout the families. The attackers\nhave attempted since 2009 to install the capability to destroy their targets using an MBR wiper component, as seen in the\nDark Seoul incident. From our analysis we have established that Operation Troy had a focus from the beginning to gather\nintelligence on South Korean military targets. We have also linked other high-profile public campaigns conducted over the\nyears against South Korea to Operation Troy, suggesting that a single group is responsible.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout the Authors\nRyan Sherstobitoff is a threats researcher with McAfee Labs.
