A second\nattack detected on May 30 used a malicious RAR archive file consisting of shortcuts to two bait\nPDF documents that purported to be a curriculum vitae and an IELTS certificate.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe shortcuts themselves contain links to pages hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate collaboration tool for\ndesigners and developers that are used to fetch the final-stage malware that, in turn, includes a\n[shellcode loader (\"svchast.exe\") and a backdoor called Crosswalk (\"3t54dE3r.tmp\").](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.crosswalk)\n\nCrosswalk, first documented by FireEye in 2017, is a bare-bones modular backdoor capable of\ncarrying out system reconnaissance and receiving additional modules from an attacker-controlled\nserver as shellcode.\n\n[While this modus operandi shares similarities with that of the Korean threat group Higaisa — which](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/higaisa/)\nwas found [exploiting LNK files attached in an email to launch attacks on unsuspecting victims in](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/return-higaisa-apt)\n2020 — the researchers said the use of Crosswalk suggests the involvement of Winnti.\n\nThis is also supported by the fact that the network infrastructure of the samples overlaps with\n[previously known APT41 infrastructure, with some of the domains traced back to Winnti attacks on](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)\nthe online video game industry in 2013.\n\nThe new wave of attacks is no different. Notably, among the targets include Battlestate Games, a\nUnity3D game developer from St. Petersburg.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found additional attack samples in the form of RAR files that\ncontained Cobalt Strike Beacon as the payload, with the hackers in one case referencing the U.S.\nprotests related to the death of George Floyd last year as a lure.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nIn another instance, Compromised certificates belonging to a Taiwanese company called Zealot\nDigital were abused to strike organizations in Hong Kong with Crosswalk and Metasploit injectors,\nas well as [ShadowPad, Paranoid PlugX, and a new .NET backdoor called FunnySwitch.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.shadowpad)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor, which appears to be still under development, is capable of collecting system\ninformation and running arbitrary JScript code. It also shares a number of common features with\nCrosswalk, leading the researchers to believe that they were written by the same developers.\n\nPreviously, [Paranoid PlugX had been linked to attacks on companies in the video games industry in](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-paranoid-plugx/)\n2017. Thus, the deployment of the malware via Winnti's network infrastructure adds credence to the\n\"relationship\" between the two groups.\n\n\"Winnti continues to pursue game developers and publishers in Russia and elsewhere,\" the\nresearchers concluded. \"Small studios tend to neglect information security, making them a tempting\ntarget. Attacks on software developers are especially dangerous for the risk they pose to end users,\nas already happened in the well-known cases of CCleaner and ASUS.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n[Cyber Attack,](https://thehackernews.com/search/label/Cyber%20Attack) [Malware,](https://thehackernews.com/search/label/Malware) [Phishing](https://thehackernews.com/search/label/Phishing)\n\n\n-----",
