Recently,\ntheir new creation, the Ghimob banking trojan, has been a move toward infecting mobile\ndevices, targeting financial apps from banks, fintechs, exchanges and cryptocurrencies in\nBrazil, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Germany, Angola and Mozambique.\n\n**Ghimob is a full-fledged spy in your pocket: once infection is completed, the hacker can**\naccess the infected device remotely, completing the fraudulent transaction with the victim’s\nsmartphone, so as to avoid machine identification, security measures implemented by\nfinancial institutions and all their antifraud behavioral systems. Even if the user has a screen\nlock pattern in place, Ghimob is able to record it and later replay it to unlock the device.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the cybercriminal is ready to perform the transaction, they can insert a black screen as\nan overlay or open some website in full screen, so while the user looks at that screen, the\ncriminal performs the transaction in the background by using the financial app running on the\nvictim’s smartphone that the user has opened or logged in to.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ghimob is also interesting in that it uses C2s with fallback\nprotected by Cloudflare, hides its real C2 with DGA and employs several other tricks, posing\n[as a strong competitor in this field. But yet, no sign of MaaS (malware-as-a-service).](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/malware-as-a-service-maas/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\n[Compared to BRATA or](https://securelist.com/spying-android-rat-from-brazil-brata/92775/) [Basbanke, another mobile banking trojan family originating in Brazil,](https://securelist.com/basbanke-trend-setting-brazilian-banking-trojan/90365/)\n**Ghimob is far more advanced and richer in features, and has strong persistence.**\n\n## Multiplatform financial attack\n\n[While monitoring a Guildma Windows malware campaign, we were able to find malicious](https://securelist.com/the-tetrade-brazilian-banking-malware/97779/#guildma-full-of-tricks)\nURLs used for distributing both ZIP files for Windows boxes and APK files, all from the same\nURL. If the user-agent that clicked the malicious link is an Android-based browser, the file\ndownloaded will be the Ghimob APK installer.\n\nThe APKs thus distributed are posing as installers of popular apps; they are not on Google\nPlay but rather hosted in several malicious domains registered by Guildma operators. Once\n[installed on the phone, the app will abuse Accessibility Mode to gain persistence, disable](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en)\nmanual uninstallation and allow the banking trojan to capture data, manipulate screen\ncontent and provide full remote control to the fraudster: a very typical mobile RAT.\n\n**_Same link, different files: ZIP for Windows, APK for Android_**\n\nOur telemetry shows that all victims of the Ghimob mobile banking trojan are located in Brazil\nat the moment, but like all other Tétrade threat actors, Ghimob has big plans to expand\nabroad.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Ghimob detections: Brazil for now, but ready to expand abroad_**\n\nTo lure the victim into installing the malicious file, the email is written as if from a creditor and\nprovides a link where the recipient could view more information, while the app itself pretends\nto be Google Defender, Google Docs, WhatsApp Updater, etc.\n\n**A malicious message distributing the malware, written in Brazilian Portuguese**\n\n## A persistent RAT in your pocket\n\nAs soon as the malware is launched, it tries to detect common emulators, checks for the\npresence of a debugger attached to the process and the manifest file, and also checks for a\ndebuggable flag. If any of these are present, then the malware simply terminates itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nNewer versions of the malware have moved the emulator names to an encrypted\nconfiguration file. If those previous checks are passed, the user is then presented with the\ndefault Android accessibility window, as the malware heavily relies on accessibility to work.\n\n**_“Google Docs” is asking you to provide Accessibility permissions_**\n\nOnce infection is completed, the malware proceeds to send an infection notification message\nto its notification server. This includes the phone model, whether it has a screen lock\nactivated and a list of all installed apps that the malware has as a target including version\nnumbers. Ghimob spies on 153 mobile apps, mainly from banks, fintechs,\ncryptocurrencies and exchanges. By analyzing the malware, it is possible to see all the apps\nmonitored and targeted by the RAT. These are mainly institutions in Brazil (where it watches\n112 apps), but since Ghimob, like other Tétrade threat actors, has been moving toward\nexpanding its operations, it also watches the system for cryptocurrency apps from different\ncountries (thirteen apps) and international payment systems (nine apps). Also targeted are\nbanks in Germany (five apps), Portugal (three apps), Perú (two apps), Paraguay (two apps),\nAngola and Mozambique (one app per country).\n\nThe malware also blocks the user from uninstalling it, restarting or shutting down the device.\n[This is what happens when the user tries to remove Ghimob manually: video](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/11/09085922/ghimob_uninstall.mp4)\n\n## Fallback C2s for complete remote control\n\nOnce installation is completed, Ghimob tries to hide its presence by hiding the icon from the\napp drawer. The malware will decrypt a list of hardcoded C2 providers from its configuration\nfile and contact each in order to receive the real C2 address, a technique we call “fallback\nchannels“.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 providers found are the same across all samples we analyzed, but the directory\nparameters of the request to obtain the real C2 vary among different samples, returning a\ndifferent set of real C2 addresses. All of the communication is done via the HTTP/HTTPS\nprotocol.\n\n**_Control Panel used by Ghimob for listing infected victims_**\n\n[Instead of recording the user screen via the MediaProjection API, like](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection) [BRATA does, Ghimob](https://securelist.com/spying-android-rat-from-brazil-brata/92775/)\nsends accessibility-related information from the current active window, as can be seen below\nfrom the output of the “301” command returned from the C2.

While BRATA uses an overlay with a fake](https://securelist.com/spying-android-rat-from-brazil-brata/92775/)\nWebView to steal credentials, Ghimob does not need to do that, as it reads the fields directly\nfrom the target app through accessibility features. The following words in Portuguese are\nmonitored: saldo (balance), investimento (investment), empréstimo (lending), extrato\n**(statement).**\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIt took some time for Brazilian crooks to decide to try their hand at creating a mobile banking\n[trojan with a worldwide reach. First, we saw Basbanke, then](https://securelist.com/basbanke-trend-setting-brazilian-banking-trojan/90365/) [BRATA, but both were heavily](https://securelist.com/spying-android-rat-from-brazil-brata/92775/)\nfocused on the Brazilian market. In fact, Ghimob is the first Brazilian mobile banking trojan\nready to expand and target financial institutions and their customers living in other countries.\nOur telemetry findings have confirmed victims in Brazil, but as we saw, the trojan is well\nprepared to steal credentials from banks, fintechs, exchanges, crypto-exchanges and credit\ncards from financial institutions operating in many countries, so it will naturally be an\ninternational expansion.\n\nWe believe this campaign could be related to the Guildma threat actor, a well-known\nBrazilian banking trojan, for several reasons, but mainly because they share the same\ninfrastructure. It is also important to note that the protocol used in the mobile version is very\nsimilar to that used for the Windows version.\n\nWe recommend that financial institutions watch these threats closely, while improving their\nauthentication processes, boosting anti-fraud technology and threat intel data, and trying to\nunderstand and mitigate all of the risks that this new mobile RAT family poses.
