They are used to store large files that can’t be\nsent via email. Users typically upload files on a FileZen server and then use a web-based\npanel to obtain links that they can share with fellow employees or persons outside of their\norganization.\n\nJust like most of these vendors, Soliton provides a cloud-based version of FileZen, but also\nstandalone servers that can be installed on-premises to meet certain data privacy\nrequirements in highly secured environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Soliton\nBut while the FTA attacks [came to light earlier this year, investigators are only now](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion.html)\ndiscovering the exploitation attempts that targeted FileZen, a solution that has a smaller\ninstall base, primarily located inside Japan.\n\n## Two vulnerabilities exploited in the wild\n\nA source familiar with the investigation in Japan has told The Record that hackers appear to\nhave found a combination of two FileZen security bugs, which they began exploiting earlier\nthis year, in January.\n\n[Threat actors used CVE-2020-5639 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5639) [CVE-2021-20655—two vulnerabilities that have](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20655)\nbeen patched in December 2020 and February 2021, respectively—to breach FileZen\nsystems left connected online that have not been placed behind a firewall.\n\nThe first vulnerability allowed threat actors to upload malicious files on the device, while the\nsecond allowed them to run OS commands with elevated privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In support documents published on its website, Soliton is telling customers to update to](https://www.soliton.co.jp/support_info/fz2104.html)\nversions v4.2.8 or v5.0.3 or later to patch the attacker’s point of entry and prevent future\nintrusions.\n\nHowever, since the attacks started before a patch was ready, Soliton is also working on the\npresumption that customer systems have already been breached.\n\n[The company is now advising that customers reset all admin account passwords and reset](https://www.soliton.co.jp/support/2021/004334.html)\naccess-control (internal firewall) lists.\n\nThe source told The Record that there was not enough evidence to link the attacks on\nFileZen devices to the earlier attacks that targeted FTA systems, but that this would not\nsurprise investigators, as the FileZen attacks appear to have started just as the FTA attacks\nwere publicly exposed and slowly died out.\n\nTags\n\n[Accellion](https://therecord.media/tag/accellion/)\n[Asia](https://therecord.media/tag/asia/)\n[Cabinet Office](https://therecord.media/tag/cabinet-office/)\n[FileZen](https://therecord.media/tag/filezen/)\n[hacking campaign](https://therecord.media/tag/hacking-campaign/)\n[Japan](https://therecord.media/tag/japan/)\n[Soliton](https://therecord.media/tag/soliton/)\n[vulnerability](https://therecord.media/tag/vulnerability/)\n[zero-day](https://therecord.media/tag/zero-day/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
