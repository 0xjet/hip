Computer attacks known as “APT”\n(Advanced Persistent Threat) have become widely reported and emphasized by the media,\ndamages are now considered as real and strategic trends are moving in cyber defense.\n\nAIRBUS Defence & Space – CyberSecurity unit responds to such attacks for its customers every\nday, developing a complete range of solutions.\n\nToday, we decided to release publicly information on a specific group of APT attackers known as\n“Pitty Tiger”. This information comes directly from investigations led by our Threat Intelligence.\n\nPitty Tiger is a group of attackers that have been active since at least 2011. They have targeted\nprivate companies in several sectors, such as defense and telecommunications, but also at least\none government.\n\nWe have been able to track down this group of attackers and can provide detailed information\nabout them. We were able to collect and reveal their “malware arsenal”. We also analyzed their\ntechnical organization.\n\nOur investigations indicate that Pitty Tiger has not used any 0day vulnerability so far, rather they\nprefer using custom malware, developed for the group’s exclusive usage. Our discoveries\nindicate that Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers with the ability to stay under the radar, yet still not\nas mature as other groups of attackers we monitor.\n\nPitty Tiger is probably not a state-sponsored group of attackers. They lack the experience and\nfinancial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers. We suppose this group\nis opportunistic and sells its services to probable competitors of their targets in the private sector.\n\nWe have been able to leverage several attackers profiles, showing that the Pitty Tiger group is\nfairly small compared to other APT groups, which is probably why we saw them work on a very\nlimited amount of targets.\n\nAt the end of this report, we provide indicators of compromise to help people detect current Pitty\nTiger attacks.\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 2/58\n\n\nToday, we decided to release publicly information on a specific group of APT attackers known as\n“Pitty Tiger”.

MODUS OPERANDI: APT ATTACKS\n\nAPT attacks follow what we call the “APT kill chain”. The kill chain describes briefly the way\nattackers do perform their actions.\n\nIt can be summarized by the following scheme:\n\n## RECONNAISSANCE PHASE\n\nThe reconnaissance phase commences when an attacker selects a new target and involves the\nacquisition of information about that target.\n\nThere is very little information available about this phase, and there is little data about it. The only\nway to collect information about this phase would be to already monitor all attackers’ actions at this\nstep, which is hardly feasible.\n\nThe longer the attackers spend time in attempting to understand their target and its online presence,\nthe easier it will be to find efficient ways to penetrate that company’s systems.\n\nThis reconnaissance phase is both about finding information to break into the targeted network\nsuccessfully and about searching for data which could help to accelerate sensitive information\nisolation (like the name of a key employee for example).\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 5/58\n\n\n## RECONNAISSANCE PHASE\n\nThe reconnaissance phase commences when an attacker selects a new target and involves the\nacquisition of information about that target.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis phase mostly relies on open sources from the Internet: social networks, press releases, white\npapers, corporate websites, search engines, but also on some active tools like vulnerability\nscanners etc.\n\n## INITIAL COMPROMISE\n\nAt this stage, the APT attackers have a solid knowledge of their target and its key employees. The\nattackers have everything they need to start looking for an entry point to the company’s network and\nestablish one or several permanent backdoors into the environment.\n\nThe attackers mostly rely on two techniques here to infect one or several computers, usually\nworkstations, inside the target’s network: spear phishing and drive-by downloads.\n\nSpear phishing can be described as targeted e-mail phishing. In a spear phishing scheme, attackers\nsend very few e-mails to targeted people. In fact, they can even send just a single e-mail. The trick\nis to target the right victim and provide it with the right content, so that they will click on a link leading\nto drive-by download of a malware, or open an attached file which will infect their computer.\n\nSome groups of attackers also use “watering hole” techniques to successfully compromise their\ntargets. To build a watering hole attack, attackers do compromise the website of a third party,\ngenerally a supplier of the target, which is typically visited by a specific group of professionals and\nvery likely by the target. Every visitor of the compromised third party is then infected. The method\nhas one major drawback: it will also infect third parties who visit the website. Attackers have\ndeveloped ways to avoid this. If their reconnaissance phase has been done effectively, they already\nknow all IP ranges used by the target company. It just takes a few lines of code in the infecting script\nto only compromise visitors coming from the target IP ranges.\n\nDirect attacks against servers of the target can also be a way to penetrate the target’s network.\n\n## ACCESS STRENGTHENING & LATERAL MOVES\n\nAttackers have gained access to one or several machines inside the target’s corporate network.\nThey need to install several different backdoors in order to be able to always access the network. In\ncase one backdoor falls, there will be others.\n\nAs soon as the attackers are sure they have enough access, they start looking for two things:\nintellectual property (or anything else they want to know or steal) in alignment with predefined\nmission objectives, and a means of privilege escalation to facilitate lateral movement within the\ncompromised environment. It generally does not take long before the attackers gain domain\nadministrator privileges and dump all the Active Directory content.\n\nThey use lateral moves between machines inside the network, and look for everything they need.\nThis step is very hard to detect, since they only use valid credentials and legitimate administration\ntools such as PsExec.\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 6/58\n\n\nSpear phishing can be described as targeted e-mail phishing. In a spear phishing scheme, attackers\nsend very few e-mails to targeted people. In fact, they can even send just a single e-mail. The trick\nis to target the right victim and provide it with the right content, so that they will click on a link leading\nto drive-by download of a malware, or open an attached file which will infect their computer.\n\nSome groups of attackers also use “watering hole” techniques to successfully compromise their\ntargets.

It just takes a few lines of code in the infecting script\nto only compromise visitors coming from the target IP ranges.\n\nDirect attacks against servers of the target can also be a way to penetrate the target’s network.\n\n## ACCESS STRENGTHENING & LATERAL MOVES\n\nAttackers have gained access to one or several machines inside the target’s corporate network.\nThey need to install several different backdoors in order to be able to always access the network. In\n\n\n-----\n\n## DATA EXFILTRATION\n\nData exfiltration is the last step before the attackers loop to the lateral moves step, in a never-ending\ncircle of prolonged access and information theft.\n\nThey generally create archive files containing the content they want to exfiltrate, which are then sent\nto the attackers by using a remote administration tool (RAT) or transfer protocols such as FTP and\nHTTP.\n\nThis phase is not the end of an APT attack. The attackers loop to the access strengthening/lateral\nmoves stage and generally keep stealing more information and stay inside the network for more\ndata gathering.\n\nFor more information about all the APT phases, please refer to our APT Kill Chain blog post serie[1].\n\n1 [http://blog.cassidiancybersecurity.com/tag/APT](http://blog.cassidiancybersecurity.com/tag/APT)\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 7/58\n\n\nFor more information about all the APT phases, please refer to our APT Kill Chain blog post serie .\n\n\n-----\n\n## “PITTY TIGER” INVESTIGATION CONTEXT\n\nDuring our regular investigations on APT cases, one particular variant of malware caught our\nattention, because we had not faced it before. We decided to spend some time to investigate around\nthis malware and found out that it was used exclusively by a single group of attackers. This malware\nfamily is known as “PittyTiger” by the anti-virus research community.\n\nWe discovered this malware sample in June 2014, leading to a command & control (c&c) server still\nin activity.\n\nOur researches around this particular malware family revealed the “Pitty Tiger” group has been\nactive since 2011, yet we found other publications[1] which could probably be attributed to the same\ngroup of attacker back in 2010[2].\n\nThis group uses other malware and tools during their APT operations, in addition to the PittyTiger\nRAT.\n\nA variant of the infamous Gh0st RAT dubbed “Paladin” has been used repeatedly by the PT group,\ntogether with other RATs which seem to be developed exclusively for the PT group: “MM RAT” (aka\nTroj/Goldsun-B), and “CT RAT”. Another variant of Gh0st RAT named “Leo” has been found inactive\non a c&c server.\n\nWe also found another malware, named “Troj/ReRol.A”. This one is also used by the group to infect\nworkstations, collect system information, and install more malware on the infected computer. It acts\nas a first stage downloader and system data collector often used in the initial compromise of the\nPitty Tiger campaigns, generally embedded in Microsoft Office documents.\n\nThanks to server’s misconfigurations, we managed to get information from three c&c servers used\nby this group of attackers, which provided us with insight from the end of 2013 to the beginning of\nJuly 2014.\n\nOur investigation has been focused on the data we could get from these c&c servers but also on the\nPitty Tiger environment.\n\nThis whitepaper aims to expose the view we have on the group, especially on their infrastructure\nand capabilities. We hope this publication will bring further counter analysis from the research\ncommunity to enrich the global common threat knowledge.\n\n[1http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/08/03/poisoned-doc-targeted-malware-attack/](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/08/03/poisoned-doc-targeted-malware-attack/)\n[2http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/06/24/targeted-trident-cyberattack-defence-company/](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/06/24/targeted-trident-cyberattack-defence-company/)\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 8/58\n\n\nThis group uses other malware and tools during their APT operations, in addition to the PittyTiger\nRAT.\n\nA variant of the infamous Gh0st RAT dubbed “Paladin” has been used repeatedly by the PT group,\ntogether with other RATs which seem to be developed exclusively for the PT group: “MM RAT” (aka\nTroj/Goldsun-B), and “CT RAT”.

We hope this publication will bring further counter analysis from the research\n\n\n-----\n\n## INFECTION METHODS\n\n SPEAR PHISHING AND WEAPONIZED DOCUMENTS\n\nPitty Tiger, like most other APT groups, use spear phishing e-mails extensively in order to gain an\ninitial foothold within the targeted environment.\n\nWe have been able to find a spear phishing e-mail crafted by the attackers. This e-mail spoofed the\nidentity of an employee of a targeted company:\n\n```\nFrom: XXXXXXX\nTo: XXXXXXX\nFile: 1 Attachment: Bird’s Eye Point of View.doc\n\n```\n```\nWhile the holiday season means clustering clustering ‘time for a\nvacation’ for many, there are Those That Will Be of us staying home this\nyear. That’s why we’ve Decided to take you on a trip around the world\nfrom a bird’s eye view of the item! It’s safe to say That MOST of the\nlucky people on vacation Will not see breathtaking sights like these.\nRemember to look down!\n\n```\n```\nXXXXXX\n\n```\n\nThe attached file is a Microsoft Office Word document triggering CVE-2014-1761 to infect the\ncomputer it is sent to:\n\n_Word document used to infect computers with Troj/ReRol.A_\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 9/58\n\n```\nFrom: XXXXXXX\nTo: XXXXXXX\nFile: 1 Attachment: Bird’s Eye Point of View.doc\nWhile the holiday season means clustering clustering ‘time for a\nvacation’ for many, there are Those That Will Be of us staying home this\nyear. That’s why we’ve Decided to take you on a trip around the world\nfrom a bird’s eye view of the item! It’s safe to say That MOST of the\nlucky people on vacation Will not see breathtaking sights like these.\nRemember to look down!\nXXXXXX\n\n```\nThe attached file is a Microsoft Office Word document triggering CVE-2014-1761 to infect the\ncomputer it is sent to:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this example looks very “amateur” for a spear phishing attempt, we suppose the group has\nconducted more advanced spear phishing campaigns, based on the fact that we found infected\nWord documents showing content stolen from victims of the group. These documents were infecting\nthe system with Troj/ReRol.A malware, which we will detail later in this report.\n\nThis could mean that the Pitty Tiger group is using stolen material as spear phishing content either\nto target other persons in the compromised company, or to target other persons in a competitor’s\ncompany, or more generally to compromise another target.\n\nPitty Tiger also seem to use fake Microsoft Office Excel content, yet we could only find empty\ncontent delivering once again the Troj/ReRol.A malware.\n\n## DIRECT ATTACKS\n\nAlthough we have not been able to find evidences of any attack aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities on\nthe group’s targets servers, we have been able to record several vulnerability scanning launched\nfrom one c&c server straight to the targets.\n\nThe attackers have been using different vulnerability scanners aimed at their targets. While some\ntargets have been scanned with “generic” vulnerability scanning tools like HScan or Fluxay and port\nscanners like Nmap, some other targets have been scanned for very specific vulnerabilities, like a\nZyWALL vulnerability or a FORTINET product.\n\nWe have also been able to testify that the Pitty Tiger group has successfully collected information on\nsome of their targets by exploiting the HeartBleed[1] bug. This vulnerability which exists on some old\nversions of OpenSSL allows attackers to collect data from chunks of memory from the targeted\nmachine. It allowed the Pitty Tiger group to get admin credentials from at least one target, for\nexample.\n\n_Memory data leak from one server – Heartbleed exploit on one of PittyTiger’s targets_\n\n1 [http://heartbleed.com/](http://heartbleed.com/)\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 10/58\n\n\n## DIRECT ATTACKS\n\nAlthough we have not been able to find evidences of any attack aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities on\nthe group’s targets servers, we have been able to record several vulnerability scanning launched\nfrom one c&c server straight to the targets.\n\nThe attackers have been using different vulnerability scanners aimed at their targets.

We\nwould advocate that this method is unwise when you want to stay furtive, and doing it from a c&c\nserver is very surprising, to say the least. While the Pitty Tiger group is experienced on some\naspects on its running APT campaigns, it definitely lacks some maturity here.\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 11/58\n\n\n-----\n\n## MALWARE INFORMATION\n\n TROJ/REROL.A\n\nOne of the favorite methods used by the Pitty Tiger group to infect users is to use a Microsoft Office\nWord document which exploits a specific vulnerability.\n\nThe payload infecting the system is malware known as “Troj/ReRol.A”. It is generally the first step of\nthe initial compromise for Pitty Tiger campaigns.\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nWe have been able to find one such document[1] used by that group of attacker, exploiting CVE2012-0158, an old critical vulnerability impacting Microsoft Office and corrected by Microsoft’s\nMS12-027 fix in April 2012. This vulnerability affects Microsoft Office versions up to Office 2010. We\nalso found one RTF document embedding CVE-2014-1761, which is a more recent exploit.\n\nWe discovered several different documents spreading this malware by triggering CVE-2012-0158\nvulnerability, yet we could not share them in this report, since these documents contain information\nabout victims of the Pitty Tiger group.\n\nThe discovery of this “old” vulnerability exploitation in June 2014 could mean that the Pitty Tiger\ngroup has no direct access to 0day exploits, or not enough budgets to buy some. It could also mean\nthey use their low range exploit by default because it is working on their targets and is sufficient to\ncompromise their workstations.\n\nThe Word document we initially found was probably a “test” document used by the group. When\nopened, it shows a single line written in Chinese language, which can be translated as “Hello!”\n\n_Microsoft Office Word decoy “test document” used by the Pitty Tiger group_\n\n**Installation**\n\nWhen successfully triggered, the exploit infects the host by dropping and executing a file named\n“svohost.exe”[2] in the temporary folder of the currently logged-in user:\n\n1MD5 hash: e70c0479cdb9aa031a263740365e7939\n2 MD5 hash: 1752aacc08ee0acd58405e9bc10b0dbb\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 12/58\n\n\nWe have been able to find one such document[1] used by that group of attacker, exploiting CVE-\n2012-0158, an old critical vulnerability impacting Microsoft Office and corrected by Microsoft’s\nMS12-027 fix in April 2012.

We suspect Pitty Tiger to use this compromise to spear\nphish other companies which are in commercial relation with this web development company.\n\nWe have to mention that we only had access to three of the several attackers’ servers. Therefore,\nwe suppose the Pitty Tiger group could have more targets than what we could confirm.\n\nWe also found a lot of vulnerability scanners launched by the attackers at different targets, yet there\nwas no sign of compromise.\n\nDuring the course of our investigations, we discovered a RAR archive on the attacker’s server\ncontaining 5 Word documents and one small C source code. These documents belong to the\ndefense company which has been compromised. According to the name of the files and the general\nfeel of the archive, we do think it was extracted by the attackers to “show” someone what kind of\ndata they could get from the compromise of that particular target. The documents were still\nexhibiting comments from various users, showing it was an ongoing work and not old documents.\n\nInterestingly enough, we saw a part of these documents appear on Virus-Total, with an additional\n“gift” from the attackers, a payload dropping a malware.\n\nThere are only two options we can think of here:\n\n  - Someone from the same company has been targeted with this document.\n\n  - Someone from another company has been targeted with this document. This other company\ncould be a partner or competitor.\n\nSince we were unable to determine the intended use of this specific document, we can only suppose\nthat it could be used to provide commercial advantages to competitors of that company, or used by\na foreign state.\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 39/58\n\n\n\n  - 1 company from the defense industry;\n\n  - 1 company from the energy industry;\n\n  - 1 company from the telecommunications industry;\n\n  - 1 company specialized in web development.\n\nIt might be surprising to see a company specialized in web development here, yet it has built\nwebsites for interesting potential targets.

Moreover, we have strong suspicions that there is not a single individual\nnicknamed “Trees and snow” but rather two programmers nicknamed “Trees” and “Snow”. “Trees”\ncould also be “Cold”. We noticed that the symbol for this word is translated differently according to\nthe context it is used in. Once again, we lack Chinese language skills.\n\nWe identify the two nicknames on the current campaign as Automn Snow (秋雪) and Cold Air Kiss (\n```\n风吻寒).\n\n```\nWhile we are confident that these people are indeed the developers of both PittyTiger and CT RAT\nmalware, we are not sure they belong to the PittyTiger group. These developers might just have\nbeen hired to develop these RATs. They might also just be selling it to the PittyTiger group. There is\nno trace of usage from other attacking groups, we believe the PittyTiger RAT is exclusively used by\nthis group of attackers.\n\n## ROLES AND ORGANIZATION\n\nAccording to indicators we gathered and threat activities profiling we have some hypothesis on the\nway the group is conducting its operations.\n\nWe have strong evidence of a bot operator position. We identify one nickname for this position, the\nuser known as TooT. As we did not see other nickname, we think that TooT is one person and not a\ngroup of persons.\n\nWe also identified a malware development position. We identified two nicknames for this position on\nthe current campaign, Automn Snow (秋雪) and Cold Air Kiss ( 风吻寒). Yet we are unsure that they\nbelong to the group, they might just be a third party providing or selling their malware.\n\nWe have a strong suspicion of a coordinator position, which coordinates the bot operator, provides\nhim with some logistics support (weaponized document, tools…) and reviews the programmers\nwork. This position could imply a communication channel with another manager.\nWe named this position ‘Chen’, in relation with several references of this common Chinese name in\nc&c WHOIS and other investigation materials.\n\nWe have some suspicion of a customer relationship manager position that may act as an interface\nbetween a customer and Chen. We named this position ‘Lilly’.\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 48/58\n\n\nWe identify the two nicknames on the current campaign as Automn Snow (秋雪) and Cold Air Kiss (\n```\n风吻寒).\n\n```\nWhile we are confident that these people are indeed the developers of both PittyTiger and CT RAT\nmalware, we are not sure they belong to the PittyTiger group.

We have been lucky enough to get the\ncontroller part of Pitty Tiger and CT RAT, and even to get a kind of hybrid controller made for CT\nRAT but also supporting Pitty Tiger. We suppose that the CT RAT is the new evolution of Pitty Tiger\nand that it will replace Pitty Tiger in the following months.\n\nThe presence of a Chinese version of “calc.exe”, the official calculator provided in Microsoft\nWindows, is interesting.

This file is 67320\nlines long, and uses 5610 different passwords for each of 12 users contained in this file. The user\nnames are clearly the result from a user enumeration and are dedicated to a particular French\nvictim.\n\nThe passwords listed in this file are either build from several campaigns or from the current\ncampaign. A lot of passwords are related to the targeted company and might be previous passwords\nfrom users.\n\nWe have also discovered a pack of files which can be used to trigger an Internet Explorer\nvulnerability (CVE-2014-0322). The date of these files, namely Tope.swf and index.html, was\n2014/02/18, a few days after the revelation of existing exploits in the wild used in APT attacks[1].\n\nWe do not know if the Pitty Tiger group used this exploit or not, but found no trace indicating they\ndid.

We tried to extract different\ntechnical indicators, together with contextual elements.\n\nInformation relating to the tools used by the attackers has been leveraged for attribution:\n\n  - Several Chinese vulnerability scanners have been launched against targets;\n\n  - Several Chinese tools have been used and found on the c&c servers of the attackers:\n8uFTP, a Chinese version of calc.exe, etc.;\n\n  - Two of the used RATs have been developed by the same developers: CT RAT and\nPittyTiger RAT. The controllers for these RATs show Chinese language;\n\n  - Several binaries used by the attackers show either “Chinese - China” or “Chinese-Taiwan”\nlanguage ID in their resources;\n\n  - A decoy Word document has been found, written in Chinese language;\n\nThe IP addresses used for the hosting of the c&c domains are mainly located in Taipei (Taïwan) and\nHong Kong City (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, PRC):\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 53/58\n\n\n\n  - Several binaries used by the attackers show either “Chinese - China” or “Chinese-Taiwan”\nlanguage ID in their resources;\n\n  - A decoy Word document has been found, written in Chinese language;\n\nThe IP addresses used for the hosting of the c&c domains are mainly located in Taipei (Taïwan) and\nHong Kong City (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, PRC):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hosting information links for the c&c servers used in this campaign_\n\nMost RDP connections to the c&c infrastructure come from Chinese IP ranges in Fuqing (Fujian\nprovince, PRC).

The attackers lack the experience\nand financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers. We suppose this group\nis opportunistic and sells its services to probable competitors of their targets in the private sector.\n\nOne governmental network has been targeted by the group, yet we do not have any evidence of the\npurpose of this attack. We suppose this particular attack has been executed to provide a usable\nbounce for the group.\n\nThe campaign we studied has been largely focused on one particular target. We suspect the Pitty\nTiger group to work according to an opportunistic business model: this group might offer its services\nto third parties from the private sector.\n\nThis group seems to be very small compared to other APT groups. We have leveraged several\nprofiles and could identify some attackers to a certain extent. We believe this group might keep\nworking as it is now, with limited budgets, or grow to extend its attacking campaign capabilities.\n\nPublic release\n\nThreat Intelligence\n“The Eye of the Tiger” Page : 56/58\n\n\nand financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers.
