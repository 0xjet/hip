By working collectively, with a strong\nsense of teamwork, we can achieve far more than fighting cybercrime as individual vendors.\n\nBut, only by improving our approach and sharing threat intelligence more comprehensively, and by\nexpanding the pool of participants who contribute to (and benefit from) this sharing and collaboration, will\ncybersecurity vendors continue to drive up costs for attackers, and make lasting, impactful change.\n\nIn the spirit of that approach to working together, in 2017 Sophos joined the Cyber Threat Alliance, an\norganization dedicated to breaking down the barriers that, for years, stymied any chance for competitors\nin the information security industry to collaborate with one another. The CTA has succeeded far beyond its\ninitial mandate to serve as a repository of shared threat intelligence and a place to resolve differences, and\nhas become a sort of UN to the cybersecurity industry.\n\nThrough our partnership with the CTA, Sophos can better protect our customers, thanks to the early\nwarnings and data exchange between vendors, made possible by the alliance. Sophos also shares the\nburden of protecting the other vendors’ customers by contributing our own threat intel.\n\nIn March 2020, as lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 were implemented rapidly across the\nworld, Sophos chief scientist, Joshua Saxe put out a call on Twitter. Appalled that criminal groups were\nstarting to incorporate references to COVID-19 into a range of crime campaigns, information security\nanalysts – more than 4,000 of them – banded together in a collective show of defiance and formed the\nCOVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition (CCTC) in a Slack channel created that same day. This channel is building\nan enduring “commons” for the community to leverage in times of crisis, and is close to achieving not-forprofit status under the auspices of the CTA.\n\nUltimately, these stories about sharing threat intelligence tell us about more than just the organizations\nthemselves. As another parable—that of the blind man and the elephant—teaches us, no one vendor can\nprovide comprehensive or absolute truth through their subjective experiences alone. The true shape of\ncomplicated things emerges from the union of our experiences. These collaborative initiatives protected\nmillions of people from becoming victims of cybercrime, but that alone wasn’t why they were successful.\nThey thrived because the core motivation of their members and founders has been to, first, protect anyone\nwho might be in harm’s way from harm. There was no profit motive, just a desire to defend those in need,\nwhile it seemed like the wolves were at the door.\n\nThis proves the model is correct, and bridges critical gaps in coverage none of us alone could generate, but\nwe can do more with it. As an industry, we may in the future want to consider sharing machine learning\nmodels, or training datasets, just as we share block lists or Yara rules today. We could also strengthen\nand contribute to emerging standards like STIX and the ATT&CK framework. And we could participate in\nindustry-specific ISACs and ISAOs.\n\nThe future will be more connected, and we’ll all be better off (and better protected) for it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Sophos 2021 Threat Report covers topic areas into which Sophos has gained insight from the work\nover the past 12 months by SophosLabs on malware and spam analysis, and by the Sophos Rapid\nResponse, Cloud Security, and Data Science teams. These aspects of our daily work protecting customers\nprovide insight into the threat landscape that can guide incident responders and IT security professionals\non where they should direct their efforts to defend networks and endpoints in the coming year.\n\nWe've segmented the report into four main parts: Discussion of how ransomware has transformed itself,\nand where this threat is headed; analysis of the most common attacks large organizations face, and why\nthese metaphorical canaries in the coal mine remain significant threats; how the emergence of a global\npandemic affected information security in 2020; and a survey of the scope of attacks targeting platforms\nnot traditionally considered part of an enterprise's attack surface.\n\nTo summarize the key takeaways from the report:\n\n### Ransomware\n\nÌ Ransomware threat actors continue to innovate both their technology and their criminal modus\n\noperandi at an accelerating pace\n\nÌ More ransomware groups now engage in data theft so they may threaten targets with extortion over the\n\nrelease of sensitive private data\n\nÌ As ransom groups put more effort into active attacks against larger organizations, the ransoms they\n\ndemand have risen precipitously\n\nÌ Further, distinct threat actor groups that engage in ransomware attacks appear to be collaborating\n\nmore closely with their peers in the criminal underground, behaving more like cybercrime cartels than\nindependent groups\n\nÌ Ransomware attacks that previously took weeks or days now may only require hours to complete\n\n### 'Everyday' threats\n\nÌ Server platforms running both Windows and Linux have been heavily targeted for attack, and leveraged\n\nto attack organizations from within\n\nÌ Common services like RDP and VPN concentrators remain a focus for attack on the network perimeter,\n\nand threat actors also use RDP to move laterally within breached networks\n\nÌ Even low-end \"commodity\" malware can lead to major breaches, as more malware families branch out\n\ninto becoming \"content distribution networks\" for other malware\n\nÌ A lack of attention to one or more aspects of basic security hygiene has been found to be at the root\n\ncause of many of the most damaging attacks we've investigated\n\n\n-----\n\n### COVID-19\n\nÌ Working from home presents new challenges, expanding an organization's security perimeter to\n\nthousands of home networks protected by widely varying levels of security\n\nÌ Cloud computing has successfully borne the brunt of a lot of enterprise needs for secure computing\n\nenvironments, yet still has its own challenges unique from those in a traditional enterprise network\n\nÌ Threat actors have attempted to launder their reputations making promises not to target organizations\n\ninvolved in life-saving health operations, but later reneged on those promises\n\nÌ Criminal enterprises have branched out into a service economy that eases new criminals into the fold\n\nÌ Cybersecurity professionals from around the world self-organized in 2020 into a rapid reaction force\n\nto combat threats that leverage the social engineering potential of anything relating to the novel\nCoronavirus\n\n### Nontraditional platforms\n\nÌ Attackers now routinely take advantage of the wealth of \"red team\" tools and utilities pioneered by\n\npenetration testers in live, active attacks\n\nÌ Despite efforts on the part of operators of mobile platforms to monitor apps for malicious code,\n\nattackers continue to work around the edges, developing techniques to bypass these code scans\n\nÌ Software classified in an earlier era as \"potentially unwanted\" because it delivered a plethora of\n\nadvertisements (but was otherwise not malicious) has been engaging in tactics that are increasingly\nindistinguishable from overt malware\n\nÌ Data scientists have applied approaches borrowed from the world of biological epidemiology to spam\n\nattacks and malware payloads, as a method to bridge gaps in detection\n\n\n-----\n\n### THE FUTURE OF RANSOMWARE\n\nRansomware attacks launched throughout 2020 magnified the suffering of an already wary population.\nAs the pandemic ravaged lives and livelihoods, so did a host of ransomware families, whose efforts did not\nstop targeting the health and education sectors, even as hospitals became COVID-19 battlegrounds and\nschools struggled to invent an entirely new way to teach children through March and beyond.\n\n[You can’t raise enough in a bake sale during a pandemic to pay a ransom, but some schools managed to](https://www.facebook.com/notes/athens-independent-school-district-texas/athens-isd-has-a-message-for-its-cyberattackers-nope/10222435877355106/)\n[recover from attacks that appeared targeted at the first day of school, by keeping secure backups.](https://www.facebook.com/notes/athens-independent-school-district-texas/athens-isd-has-a-message-for-its-cyberattackers-nope/10222435877355106/)\n\nRansomware operators pioneered new ways to evade endpoint security products, spread rapidly, and even\ncame up with a solution to the problem (from their perspective) of targeted individuals or companies having\ngood backups, securely stored where the ransomware couldn’t harm them.\n\nBut what appeared to be a wide variety of ransomware may not be as wide as it seems. As time went on,\nand we investigated an increasing number of attacks, Sophos analysts discovered that some ransomware\ncode appeared to have been shared across families, and some of the ransomware groups appeared to work\nin collaboration more than in competition with one another.\n\nGiven all this, it’s hard to make any kind of reliable prediction of what ransomware criminals will do next.\nRansomware creators and operators have burned a lot of time working on defenses against endpoint\nsecurity products. We counter their countermeasures. They show creativity and versatility in devising new\ntactics; we show tenacity in studying what they do and finding clever ways to stop them.\n\n### Data theft creates a secondary extortion market\n\nUntil this year, conventional wisdom among security companies that had any experience at all with\nransomware ran quite uniformly: Lock down obvious ingress methods, such as internet-facing RDP ports;\nkeep good offline backups; and deal with infections of small, innocuous malware such as Dridex or Emotet\nquickly, before they can deliver the killing payload.\n\nSeveral high-profile ransom attacks, for instance, against school districts across the US, failed at least in\npart because the IT managers had maintained an unaffected backup of critical data.\n\nAs a countermeasure to their victims’ preparedness, several ransomware families picked up on a side\nhustle designed to increase pressure on their victims to pay the ransom – even if every backup with\nessential data was safe. Not only would they hold the machines hostage, but they would steal the data on\nthose machines and threaten to release it to the world if the targets fail to pay a bounty.\n\nOver the past half year, Sophos analysts observed that ransomware adversaries have settled on a common\n(and slowly growing) toolset they use to exfiltrate data from a victim’s network. This toolset of wellknown, legitimate utilities anyone might have won’t be detected by endpoint security products. The list of\n[ransomware families that engage in this practice continues to grow, and now includes Doppelpaymer, REvil,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\nClop, DarkSide, Netwalker, Ragnar Locker, and Conti, among many others. The attackers operate “leaks”\nsites, where they publicize what data they’ve stolen; REvil allows anyone to buy the data from them right\nfrom its website.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe criminals use the toolset to copy sensitive internal information, compress it into an archive, and\ntransfer it out of the network – and out of reach of the victim. These are some of the tools we’ve seen used,\nso far:\n\nÌ Total Commander (file manager with built-in FTP Client)\n\nÌ 7zip (Archive creation software)\n\nÌ WinRAR (Archive creation software)\n\nÌ psftp (PuTTY’s SFTP client)\n\nÌ Windows cURL\n\nWhen it comes to data theft, the attackers are far less picky and exfiltrate entire folders, regardless of the\nfile types that are contained within. (Ransomware typically prioritizes the encryption portion of the attack to\nkey file types and excludes many others.)\n\nSize doesn’t matter. They don’t seem to care about the amount of data targeted for exfiltration. Directory\nstructures are unique to each business, and some file types can be compressed better than others. We\nhave seen as little as 5 GB, and as much as 400 GB, of compressed data being stolen from a victim prior to\ndeployment of the ransomware.\n\nFiig.1. In October, 2020, the Doppelpaymer ransomware leaks page revealed that the attackers had struck the networks of Hall County, Georgia. The leak\nincluded a reference to a file called “elections” which included sample ballot proofs for the state primary elections in 2020 and lists of poll workers and their\nphone numbers from the 2018 elections, among other sensitive files. The Associated Press reported that the ransomware encrypted the signature verification\ndatabase the county uses to validate ballots. Source: SophosLabs.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe criminals typically send the exfiltrated data to legitimate cloud storage services, which make this\nactivity harder to spot, since these are common, ordinary network traffic destinations. For attackers, the\nfollowing three cloud storage services have been the most popular go-to for storing exfiltrated data:\n\nÌ Google Drive\n\nÌ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)\n\nÌ Mega.nz\n\nÌ Private FTP servers\n\nIn a final act of destruction, ransomware attackers increasingly hunt for the local servers that contain\nbackups of critical data; when found, they delete (or independently encrypt) these backups just before the\nnetwork-wide encryption attack.\n\nIt’s more important than ever to store a backup of key data offline. If they can find it, the ransomware\ncriminals will destroy it.\n\n### Ransoms rise as attacks increase\n\nIt’s hard to believe that just two years ago, Sophos analysts marveled at the $6 million haul brought in\nby the operators of the ransomware known as SamSam. In an attack Sophos responded to in 2020, the\nransomware operators opened their negotiations at a dollar amount of more than twice what the SamSam\ngang earned in 32 months of operation.\n\nRansomware comes in weight classes, now: heavyweights that attack large enterprise networks,\nwelterweights that target civil society (public safety and local government) and small-to-medium\nbusinesses, and featherweights that target individual computers and home users. While earning the\ndubious distinction of being the heaviest heavyweight sounds impressive, it isn’t fair to compare high\nransom demands to those that originate from the lower end of the ransomware spectrum.\n\nSophos has a dedicated team that investigates, and often works with the targets of, ransomware attacks.\nThe team can forensically reconstruct the events of an attack after the fact, and sometimes disrupt attacks\nwhile they’re still in progress. The Sophos Rapid Response team gets involved in cases when there’s a\nchance to stop or limit the harm, but sometimes the attack happens so fast, there’s nothing it can do, and\nthe target must then decide whether or not to pay the ransom, at which point, Sophos is no longer involved.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat’s where companies like Coveware come in. The company represents ransomware targets, as a\nhigh-stakes negotiator with their attackers. Coveware’s CTO Alex Holdtman confirmed our suspicion, that\nransomware heavyweights are the primary driving factor in the demand for sky-high ransoms.\n\nAverage ransom payouts, quarterly\n\nQ4 2019 $84,116.00\n\nQ1 2020 $111,605.17\n\nQ2 2020 $178,254.19\n\nQ3 2020 $233,817.30\n\nFig.2. The average ransom demand has risen 21% in the past quarter and has nearly tripled over the past year. Source: Coveware.\n\nIn just the past quarter, the average ransom payout has risen by 21%, but Coveware believes the averages\ncan be skewed by just one or two very large ransom attacks. The average ransom payout in the justcompleted quarter is now the equivalent of $233,817.30, payable in cryptocurrency. A year ago, the average\npayout was $84,116.\n\nRansomware threat actors understand how expensive downtime can be, and have been testing the upper\nlimit of what they can extract in a ransom attack.\n\nSeveral ransomware families have taken up extortion as a side-hustle to help close the deal. As mentioned\nearlier in our report, groups such as Netwalker and others are using this tactic. That way, even if the target\nof the attack has perfectly recoverable backups of their data, they may still be forced to pay in the hopes the\nransomware criminals don’t publish their internal information to the world.\n\nAt the lower end of the ransomware spectrum, demands have been increasing, but Holdtman says they’re\nnowhere near the big fish. There are a lot of small businesses and individuals that get hit, but for them the\nransom demands have remained relatively flat.\n\n\n$233,817.30\n\n\n$111,605.17\n\n\n-----\n\n### Days-in-the-life of a ransomware rapid responder\n\nWhen an organization was targeted by the then still active Maze ransomware, it turned to the Sophos Rapid Response\nteam. We investigated and actively countered the attack while it was still in progress. What follows is a day-by-day\nsummary of the attack as it unfolded.\n\n\nBefore Day 1\nAt some point before the attack becomes active, the operators\ncompromise a computer on the target’s network.\n\nThis computer is then used as a ‘beachhead’ in the network. On\nmultiple occasions, the attacker will connect from here to other\ncomputers using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).\n\nDay 1\n[The first evidence of malicious activity appears when a Cobalt](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon)\n[Strike SMB beacon is installed as a service on an unprotected](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-smb-beacon)\nDomain Controller (DC). The attackers are able to control the DC\nfrom the previously compromised computer by exploiting a Domain\nAdmin account with a weak password.\n\nDay 2\nThe attackers create, execute, and then delete a series of\nscheduled tasks and batch scripts. From the evidence seen by\ninvestigators, the tasks were similar to a technique used later to\ndeploy the ransomware attacks. It is possible that the attackers are\ntesting the method they plan to use.\n\nUsing the compromised Domain Admin account and RDP access,\nthe attackers move laterally across the network to other critical\nservers.\n\nThey use the legitimate network scanning tool, Advanced IP\nScanner to start mapping out the network and make lists of IP\naddresses that would later have the ransomware deployed to them.\nThe attackers create a separate list of IP addresses belonging to\nthe computers used by the target’s IT administrators.\n\nNext, the attackers use the Microsoft tool ntdsutil to dump Active\nDirectory’s hashed credential database.\n\nThe attackers execute various WMI commands to collect\ninformation about compromised machines, and then their\nattention turns to the exfiltration of data: They identify a file server\nand, using the compromised Domain Admin account, access it\nremotely over RDP. They start compressing folders located on it.\n\nThe attackers move the archives to the domain controller, then\ntry to install the cloud storage application Mega on the DC. This is\nblocked by security, so they switch to using the web-based version\ninstead and upload the compressed files.\n\nDay 3\nExfiltration of data to Mega continues throughout the day.\n\nDay 4 and 5\nNo malicious activity is observed during this period. In previous\nincidents, we’ve observed ransomware attackers waiting to spring\nthe attack over a weekend or holiday, when the IT security team\nisn’t working or paying close attention to what is happening in the\nnetwork.\n\n\nDay 6\nA Sunday. The first Maze ransomware attack is launched, using a\ncompromised Domain Admin account and the lists of IP addresses\nthat have been identified. Over 700 computers are targeted in\nthe attack, which is promptly detected and blocked by security.\nEither the attackers don’t realize the attack has been prevented,\nor they hope that having the stolen data to hold against the victim\nis enough, because this is the moment when they issue a ransom\ndemand for $15 million.\n\nDay 7\nThe security team installs additional security and engages 24/7\nthreat monitoring. The incident response investigation begins,\nquickly identifying the compromised admin account, discovering\nseveral malicious files, and blocking communication between the\nattacker and the infected machines.\n\nDay 8\nFurther tools and techniques used by the attackers are discovered,\nas well as evidence relating to the exfiltration of data. More files and\naccounts are blocked.\n\nDay 9\nDespite the defensive activity, the attackers maintain their access\nto the network and a different compromised account, and launch\na second attack. This attack is similar to the first one: execute\ncommands on a DC, looping through the lists of IP addresses\ncontained in txt files.\n\nThe attack is quickly identified. The ransomware is detected\nautomatically and both the compromised account and the\nmalware payload is disabled and deleted. No files are encrypted.\n\nCleary not wanting to give up, the attackers try again. The third\nattempt comes just a few hours after the second attack.\n\nBy now they seem to be growing desperate as this attack targets a\nsingle computer. This is the main file server that the exfiltrated data\nhad been taken from.\n\nThe Maze attackers take a different approach, deploying a full copy\nof a virtual machine (VM) and a VirtualBox hypervisor installer, an\n[attack detailed on SophosLabs Uncut in September, 2020.](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/09/17/maze-attackers-adopt-ragnar-locker-virtual-machine-technique/)\n\nThe outcome of the third attempt is the same as before: the\nSophos Rapid Response team detected and thwarted the attack,\nwith no encryption of files. The team helped the customer lock out\nthe criminal group, and the attackers ceased being able to press\nthe attack further.\n\n\n-----\n\n### EVERYDAY THREATS TO ENTERPRISES – CANARIES IN THE COAL MINE\n\nIf everything you know about cyberattacks comes from news reports, you could be forgiven for thinking\nthe sky was falling. Attacks that target large organizations happen every day, but they’re not all the kind of\nblack swan events, like a major data breach, that can send a company’s fortunes (or stock price) tumbling\nand generate bad publicity. Many attacks are far more mundane, involving malware the SophosLabs team\ntracks in a sort of “Most Wanted” list of “The Usual Suspects”.\n\nBut though these attacks, and some of the malware they deliver, are well understood and easily contained,\nevery attack carries with it the potential to get far worse if it isn’t dealt with speedily and effectively. To carry\nthe bird metaphor forward, these routine, everyday attacks represent canaries in the coal mine, an early\nindication of a toxic presence that could quickly spiral out of control.\n\n### Attacks targeting Windows & Linux servers\n\nWhile the vast majority of security incidents we responded to in 2020 involved desktop or laptop computers\nrunning variations of Windows, we saw a steady increase in attacks on both Windows and non-Windows\nservers. In general, servers have long been attractive attack targets for a variety of reasons: They often run\nfor long periods unattended or unmonitored; servers often carry more CPU and memory capacity than\nindividual laptops; and servers may occupy a privileged space on the network, often having access to the\nmost sensitive and valuable data in an organization’s operation. This makes them an attractive foothold for\na persistent attacker. These characteristics won’t change in 2021 and Sophos anticipates the volume of\nattacks targeting servers will continue to increase.\n\nThe majority of attacks targeting servers fit one of three profiles – ransomware, cryptominers and data\nexfiltration – each of which has a corresponding, distinct set of tactics and techniques the attackers\nemploy. Best practices for server admins is to avoid running conventional desktop apps, like email clients or\na web browser, from the server as a safeguard against infections, so attacks targeting servers necessarily\nrequire a shift in tactics.\n\nInternet-facing servers running Windows receive a never-ending barrage of RDP brute-forcing attempts, an\nattack tactic that, for at least the past three years, has been most often associated with (and predictive of)\nransomware attacks. The Sophos Rapid Response team frequently finds that the root cause of ransomware\nattacks it investigates involve an initial access to the target’s network by means of RDP, and then the use of\nthose machines to gain a foothold within the network and take control of DC servers, from which they can\nmount the rest of the attack.\n\nBy contrast, cryptojacking attacks tend to target a wider range of vulnerabilities in Windows, and in\napplications that normally run on server hardware, such as database software.\n\nFor instance, one method used by the Lemon_Duck cryptominer involves a brute-force attack against\ninternet-facing servers running Microsoft SQL Server. Once the attackers guess the correct database\npassword, they use the database itself to reassemble the cryptojacker payload, write it out to the server’s\nfile system, and execute it. The infected machine then attempts to exploit the EternalBlue and/or\nSMBGhost vulnerabilities in a bid to spread the cryptojacker.\n\n\n-----\n\nLemon_Duck is an equal-opportunity attacker, and can infect Linux servers. The malware attempts to\nbrute-force SSH passwords taken from a relatively small list. If successful, the attackers load malicious\nshellcode, which then establishes persistence by taking advantage of loopholes in a service called Redis.\nThe cryptojacker can also conceal itself by executing the commands to start itself from within Hadoop\nclusters.\n\nFig.3. One of the more prolific cryptojackers, called MyKings, distributed the components responsible for installing the botnet (highlighted in green) inside a Zip\narchive along with several of the exploits leaked from the NSA by the Shadow Brokers. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nOccasionally, attackers target servers because, rather than a quick payday or a steady trickle of\ncryptocurrency, they want to steal data of value stored on them. In 2020, Sophos discovered an attacker\ntargeting Linux servers using malware we called Cloud Snooper. The servers in question were hosted in a\ncloud computing cluster, and evaded detection by inventing a clever message-relay system, piggybacking\ntheir command-and-control messages on routine HTTP connections.\n\nFig.4. A “wolf in sheep’s clothing” metaphor illustration of how the Cloud Snooper APT malware concealed its commands and exfiltrated data in the guise of\nconventional HTTP requests and responses, with the help of a tool that monitored network traffic and rewrote TCP/IP packets in real time. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nServer admins have not, historically, installed endpoint protection products on servers, but with the advent\nof these types of attacks, that conventional wisdom has shifted.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Underestimate “commodity” malware at your peril\n\nNot everybody gets hit with a zero-day vulnerability by a nation-state-sponsored Advanced Persistent\nThreat (APT). Most attacks involve run-of-the-mill malware delivered by conventional means – which\ntypically involve a spam email, a benign-looking attachment or link, and a lot of encouragement for the\ntarget to open that attachment. Sophos receives thousands of telemetry hits per month about such\ncommon malware, usually an indication that a computer protected by one of our products has blocked the\nattack.\n\nIn unprotected computers, where the malware can fully execute, it will profile the target’s computer; extract\nany login credentials or saved passwords for websites that control something of value (usually, but not\nlimited to, bank or financial services accounts); then send that information back to its operators and await\nfurther instructions, which may arrive in a few seconds...or several days later.\n\nBut don’t let the fact that these malware families are merely ordinary lull you into a false sense of security.\nThese malicious workhorses can cause huge problems if allowed to persist. As mentioned earlier in our\nreport, the SophosLabs team maintains a “Most Wanted” malware list, with analysts dedicated to those\nfamilies that remain stubbornly persistent. We’ve put together a short summary of some of them below.\n\nDridex and Zloader\n**One of the most common malware types is the loader. Loaders have features centered around delivering**\nanother malware payload on behalf of their operators or people who contract with their operators. The\nDridex and Zloader malware families are both mature, established loader platforms. Attackers use both\nDridex and Zloader to collect information about the target system and send it back to the criminals, who\ncan decide at their leisure what components or payloads they will deliver, based on the information the bot\nsends back.\n\nThe Dridex loader’s core function is to contact its command-and-control (C2) server, retrieve one or more\nencrypted payloads, and deploy them. It’s very hard for analysts to get those payloads because the threat\nactors only distribute them on an as-needed basis, such as a hidden VNC (a remote-control application),\nor a SOCKS proxy. These payloads give attackers the ability to do things in the context of the user’s device.\nThey also allow the criminals to access resources on the victim system that are not directly reachable from\ntheir own system.\n\nThe server-side logic that determines what happens during an infection can be inscrutable, but we can\ninfer some rules because the bots don’t want to infect computers used by malware analysts. The bot sends\nits operators a list of installed programs; if there are analysis tools, or components of virtual machines, the\nbots don’t deliver payloads to that machine. In Zloader’s case, the bot’s operators spread the malware via a\nspam message; if you take too long to infect your computer, within eight to 12 hours after the spam goes\nout, they stop sending payloads.\n\nIt also must be a really clean machine, but it can’t be too clean, either. A plain-vanilla Windows installation\nwon’t trigger, but neither will a very full machine with a lot of tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nAgent Tesla and RATicate, infostealers and RATs\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\nOctober\n\nNovember[*]\n\n0 2K 4K 6K 8K 10K\n\nNumber of samples\n\nkeylogger xtrat xtreme other fareit quasar remcos azorult blackshades\n\nspyrat spynet hawkeye agenttesla bladabindi orcus netwiredrc limitless usteal\n\nFig.5.

Source: SophosLabs.\n\nRemote Access Trojans, or RATs, and infostealers are among the oldest forms of malware. As the name\nsuggests, RATs offer the attacker the ability to control the infected computer remotely. Infostealers also\nhew close to their name, engaging in theft and exfiltration of credentials, certificates, and other sensitive\ninformation. Two of the “Most Wanted” families we’ve dealt with over the past year are Agent Tesla (an\n[infostealer) and RATicate (a RAT).](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/14/raticate/)\n\nLike loaders, RATs also usually have a mechanism by which they can deliver additional payloads, including\nupdated versions of themselves. We’ve observed RATicate distributing other malware – including Agent\nTesla. We’ve also seen these RAT families being served up from, or communicating with, the same IP\naddresses or servers, which hints at something shared between otherwise unrelated groups.\n\nTrickbot’s takedown\nTrickbot has been a persistent nuisance malware for at least four years. The infamous botnet pioneered\na lot of what are now common behaviors and characteristics: for instance, it communicated with its\nC2 infrastructure using TLS. The bot is implicated in several high-profile ransomware attacks and is a\ncompetent credential thief in its own right.\n\n\"type\" : \"TEXT\",\n\"size\" : 101\n},\n\"controllers\" : [  {\n\"url\" : \"https://127.0.0.1.1\"\n} ],\n\"controllers\" : {\n\nFig.6. Trickbot was taken down by a single line of code. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nIn October 2020, as we prepared this report, Microsoft and the US Department of Justice announced that\nthey had seized several servers and sent a command via the botnet’s command and control system that\n\n\n-----\n\ncaused some 90% of the botnet to stop communicating with the command-and-control infrastructure.\n\nInvestigators managed to upload a “poisoned” configuration into Trickbot’s infrastructure that each bot\ndownloaded. The configuration tricked the botnet into believing that its principal command-and-control\nserver was the infected machine it was running on. The botnet then lost contact with the actual C2 servers\nand could no longer retrieve payloads or instructions.\n\nThe effort had a drastic impact on Trickbot’s operator, but they’re expected to slowly, eventually, return to\nnormal operation.\n\n### Delivery mechanisms\n\nThere are a limited number of ways that malware or attackers can reach a targeted machine or penetrate\na network. The methods of most malware attacks follow a well-worn path that may include the use of\nemail containing links to or the attachment of a malicious file, or the attacker may take a more active role\ntargeting RDP or some other vulnerable service hosted at the network perimeter, facing the public internet.\n\nRDP, the #1 attack vector for ransomware\nThe Windows Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP, is a standard service available in all current versions of\nWindows. With very little effort, RDP allows IT admins or computer users the ability to log in to a computer\nwhen not physically in the presence of that computer, which can be great in the case of a pandemic where\neveryone is suddenly forced to work from home. Unfortunately, for the past three years, ransomware threat\nactors have been abusing (at an accelerating rate) that same remote access platform as a way to gain a\nfoothold and cause large-scale damage to enterprises, earning them an increasingly large payday from\ntargeted organizations.\n\nRDP login attempts per honeypot\n\nLondon\n508,320\n\nOhio Ireland\n\nCalifornia 536,772 590,441 Frankfurt\n\n457,725 521,778\n\nMumbai\n\nParis\n\n266,448\n\n466,716\n\nSingapore\n\n236,490\n\nSão Paulo\n\n410,143\n\nFig.7. We distributed honeypots to datacenters around the world and permitted attackers to try to brute-force their way in. The honeypot machines were\ndiscovered “organically,” without being advertised in any way. Over the 1-month period of our tests, this map illustrates how many attacks each honeypot\n\n\n-----\n\nlocation received.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 lockdown era has only exacerbated the problem, as increasing numbers of\norganizations and workers are forced by circumstances to rely upon RDP in order to remain operational.\nThe main risk here is that RDP was never meant to withstand the kind of onslaught it can receive from the\npublic-facing internet. If the RDP password is weak, easily guessed or brute-forced through automated\nlogin attempts, the attacker gains a foothold inside the network they can exploit at their leisure.\n\nThe Sophos team that handles incident response for major incidents reports that RDP remains one of the\ntop “root causes” of the ransomware events they handle. The advice to IT managers remains the same\nas it has all along: RDP should never face the public internet, but instead be placed behind a firewall that\nrequires users to connect via a VPN or other zero-trust facility first; and admins should strengthen Windows\npassword policies to require longer passwords and a multi-factor authentication token or app.\n\n[In research performed before the lockdown took effect, Sophos set up honeypots in 10 datacenters around](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophos-rdp-exposed-the-threats-thats-already-at-your-door-wp.pdf)\nthe world to better understand just how bad the problem had become. Over a 30 day period, the honeypots\nreceived a median average of 467,000 RDP login attempts, or about 600 per hour at each location. The\nresearch revealed that each honeypot received a steadily increasing frequency and ferocity of login\nattempts until we finally pulled the plug.\n\nTop 5 usernames used in all failed login attemps\n\nUSERNAME FAILED LOGIN ATTEMPTS\n\nadministrator 2,647,428\n\nadmin 376,206\n\nuser 79,384\n\nssm-user 53,447\n\ntest 42,117\n\nFig.8.

In a BEC attack, a spammer sends messages that have been crafted to\nlook like they originate from a high-level executive within a company, directing someone at a lower level to\nperform some kind of financial transfer or complete a large purchase on behalf of that executive. Attackers\nmay do this by spoofing the appearance of internal emails (sometimes called Business Email Spoofing)\nor they may try to take control of accounts on the organization's own mail server, and use that account to\nsend the fraudulent request.\n\nFig.9. In this real-world example of a business-email compromise attempt, the fraudster poses as an executive asking an employee to respond to an urgent\nrequest. The email has a different Reply-To address (from a Gmail account) than the one in the From: header, a dead giveaway that something is awry – if the\n\n|Top 5 usernames used in all failed login attemps|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|USERNAME administrator|FAILED LOGIN ATTEMPTS 2,647,428|\n|admin|376,206|\n|user|79,384|\n|ssm-user|53,447|\n|test|42,117|\n\n\n-----\n\ntarget is paying attention to the mail headers. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nBEC attackers, posing as an executive, may ask the targeted employee to buy expensive gift cards or\nexpedite a financial transaction of some kind. The attacks are usually highly tailored to the targeted\nindividuals and organizations. BEC email messages look nothing like malicious spam, because they fail\nto follow spam-like patterns; they (often) don’t contain an attachment or malicious link, and they try to\nlook like they originated from within the targeted organization, at times even incorporating the target\norganization’s typical mail “signatures” or other elements that may be familiar to employees, to make them\nmore convincing to the target than conventional malicious spam.\n\nFig. 10. After the target has acknowledged the initial request, the fraudster makes the “ask” - providing a pretext that appears plausible. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nBEC scams rely on the target of the scam (the employee) being physically distant from the subject of the\nscam (the executive), and it also depends on the target acting quickly, before anyone can figure out what’s\ngoing on and stop the target from buying gift cards or making bank transfers. BEC scammers may craft a\nmessage when they know the executive is out of the office on business.\n\nThese kinds of fraudulent requests often involve some back-and-forth between the attacker and target. The\nconversation may start with a simple request for the target to respond to the scammer and progress into\na series of messages that eventually lead to an “ask” to make a purchase based on a plausible-sounding\npretext.\n\nFig.11. At some point during the attack, the BEC scammer will make a request that flies in the face of common sense, like a request to make a sudden, large\nwire transfer to an account unfamiliar to the scam’s target. This provides another opportunity for a wary staffer to question the nature of the request: Why\nwould the executive need a photograph of the back of a gift card with the PIN scratched off when they’re going to be handed out as gifts? Source: SophosLabs.\n\nBack when most of us were working in offices, physical proximity between the target and subject would\nhave made the scam immediately apparent. But our current distributed work environment, where both the\nexecutive and employee are unlikely to be in the same physical proximity, reduces the opportunities for\npeople to just walk over to someone’s desk and ask them to confirm the request.\n\n\n-----\n\nBEC scams existed prior to the COVID-19 era, but as more people are working remotely, BEC scammers are\non the prowl. As an attack against the better nature of people who just want to be helpful and supportive, it\nis a particularly offensive type of scam. If you encounter emails like these, trust your gut and speak to the\nsubject in question directly, if you can, or ask for guidance from someone else if you can’t reach them. The\nmore real employees get involved in handling these requests, the more likely it will be that the scam will be\ndiscovered before any damage is done.\n\nWeird science: retro Office glitch strikes again\nWhen it comes to malicious office documents (maldocs) and the exploits they attempt to deploy, what’s\nold is often used again and again, goes away after Microsoft produces an update, and then (sometimes)\nresurfaces. For years, SophosLabs has tracked how attackers embed a wide and rapidly changing variety\nof exploits into maldocs. Newly-disclosed vulnerabilities often find favor among the criminals who use\nmaldocs as a stepping stone to deliver a malware payload, because not everyone installs patches right\naway, and it sometimes takes a bit of time for security companies to craft an effective “safety net” defense,\nbased on behavior or other characteristics of a novel vector.\n\nMost of the maldocs we’ve seen throughout the past year have been constructed using tools called builders\nthat give attackers a literal point-and-click menu system that lets them decide exactly what exploit(s) to\ncraft into the malicious document. As endpoint protection tools get better at identifying these more modern\nexploits, which usually involve a script that has been embedded into the document, maldoc creators seem\nto have dug deep to find a very, very old bug that helps conceal the macros or other malicious content in the\ndocuments.\n\nThe bug is colloquially known as the VelvetSweatshop exploit, though it really isn’t an exploit at all. In fact,\nVelvetSweatshop was introduced by Microsoft into Microsoft Office 2003, although we didn’t see it abused\nuntil 2013, when Excel workbooks exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability were cloaked with the help of\nthe glitch. An Excel spreadsheet or Word .doc marked as “read-only” is just a password-protected document\nwith a stock password of, you guessed it, VelvetSweatshop.\n\nWe’ve seen a lot of malicious Excel spreadsheets being delivered this year that use the technique as a\nway to evade advanced threat detection. Because of the encryption, the real malicious content is hidden\nbehind strong crypto that scanners can’t crack, and can’t scan unless they support the latest algorithm\nused by attackers. Due to the use of the default-password, Excel opens the decoded content without\nprompting for the password, so from the execution point of view the encryption is transparent. Endpoint\nsecurity programs added support for the encryption and the default password, but the criminals keep\nfinding additional cryptographic algorithms that have the same feature and are not (yet) implemented by\nAV scanners.\n\nIt was quite a surprise to discover a bug old enough that, if it were human, would be in its last year of school.\nBut it’s no surprise that the makers of weaponized document builders would try to take advantage of it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Information security: A 20-year retrospective\n\nWhile an annual report gives us an opportunity to look back at significant events of the past year, we thought a look further\nback – at the past two decades – would provide context for how we arrived in our current threat landscape. The turn of the\nmillennium marked a milestone, when information security became a professional discipline and a bona fide industry. This\ntimeline of threats and events represent significant, representative moments in the evolution of threat behavior.\n\nAs both enterprises and individuals adopted the internet for both business and entertainment, large networks were ripe\ntargets for the emergence of prolific worms – self-propagating malware. Cumulatively, worms infected tens of millions of\nsystems worldwide and cost over $100 billion in damages and remediation costs.\n\n2000–2004\nThe Worm Era\n\nJanuary\n\nJuly January\n\n2000 2003\n\n2001 2004\n\nILOVEYOU SQL\n\nCodeRed Bagle\n\nSlammer\n\nAugust August January\n\n2001 2003 2004\nCodeRed II Blaster MyDoom\n\nSeptember August February\n\n2001 2003 2004\nNimda Welchia Netsky\n\nAugust April\n\n2003 2004\nSobig Sasser\n\nOctober\n\n2003\nSober\n\n2005–2012\nThe Malware Monetization Era\n\n2010\n\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2011\n\nBlackhole\n\nRx Spam Storm Conflicker Stuxnet Malvertising\n\nexploit kit\n\n2007\n\nZeus\n\n2013–Present\nThe Ransomware Era\n\n2014\n\n2013 May 2018 2019 2020\n\nPoint-of-sale 2016\n\nSnowden 2017 Magecart Extortion APT tactics by\n\n(POS) Mirai\n\nleaks WannaCry attacks ransomware threat actors\n\nmalware\n\nJune\n\n2013\n\n2017\n\nCryptoLocker\n\nNotPetya\n\nFig.12.

Botnet malware, designed for stealth and\nprofit, dominated. This era also saw the start of so-called pharmacy\nspam. Exploits against software vulnerabilities became key\ncomponents of malware, which enabled malvertising. Wherever\nthere was the potential for financial gain, cybercriminals exploited\nthose opportunities.\n\n2006 – Rx Spam\nWhat had been a mere annoyance (or a way to propagate worms),\nbecame a lucrative business selling mostly counterfeit prescription\nmedicines advertised through spam. It's estimated that pharma\nspammers made billions of dollars selling medicines most people\ncould get just by going to their doctors.\n\n2007 - Storm\n\n2007 - Zeus\n\n2008 - Conficker\nConficker rapidly infected millions of computers worldwide but did\nnot result in much damage. We still don't know the worm's true\npurpose, but thousands of hosts remain infected to this day, and\nConficker scan traffic routinely is detected as part of the internet's\n\"background radiation.\"\n\n\n2009 - Stuxnet\nStuxnet was one of the first digital weapons to target a physical\nsystem: Nuclear refinement centrifuges used by Iran to enrich\nuranium. Stuxnet's enduring legacy is that it permanently opened\nthe door to nation-states' use of malware as a tool of war.\n\n2010 - Blackhole exploit kit\nExploit kits – toolkits targeting software vulnerabilities – bound\ndifferent parts of the cybercrime ecosystem together. Crimewareas-a-Service was born when the creators of the Blackhole Exploit\nKit began offering their services.\n\n2011 - Malvertising\n\n2013–Present - The Ransomware era\nRansomware has had the most profound impact on this era.\nWhile worms, banking trojans, malvertising and spam persist,\nnothing has come close to rivaling ransomware's destructive force.\nDamage estimates from ransomware attacks over the past seven\nyears are in the trillions of dollars. Ransomware is also most likely\nthe first form of malware linked to a human death. Moreover, many\nof today's threats ultimately deliver ransomware and, like exploit\nkits, it has provided a nitro-fueled boost to an already thriving\ncybercrime ecosystem.\n\n2013 - Snowden leaks\n\n2013 - CryptoLocker\nDuring its short existence, CryptoLocker provided future criminals\nwith a winning formula by mating two existing technologies:\nencryption and cryptocurrencies. The threat landscape was\nforever changed by CryptoLocker and its aftershocks are still being\nfelt today. Three months after launch, the bitcoin wallet used by\nCryptoLocker contained nearly $30 million.\n\n2014 - Point-of-sale (POS) malware\n\n2016 - Mirai\n\nMay 2017 - WannaCry\nWannaCry, the most widespread ransomware-worm hybrid seen,\ndemonstrated (again) how a lapse in patching can have dire\nconsequences. It relied on exploits stolen from the NSA and publicly\nreleased by The Shadow Brokers. The attacks forced Microsoft to\nrelease out-of-band updates for unsupported products.\n\nJune 2017 - NotPetya\nNotPetya crippled some of the world's largest shipping and\nlogistics companies, reportedly causing over $10 billion in\ndamages. Some of the affected companies have yet to fully\nrecover.\n\n2018 - Magecart attacks\n\n2019 - Extortion ransomware\nIn an attack against the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, the\ncriminals behind Maze ransomware pioneered the use of extortion.\nThey not only encrypted and stole data, but also threatened to\npublish the stolen data if companies didn't pay. This tactic has\nbeen copied by many other ransomware crews as a hedge against\nthe targets having good backups.\n\n2020 - APT tactics by threat actors\nThe adoption of nation-state tools and tactics, which began in\nthe past couple of years, went mainstream in 2020. Professional\ncybercrime gangs use sophisticated tools like Cobalt Strike to\ndevastating effect, while some groups (Dharma) are baking it into\npoint and shoot toolkits for novices to use.\n\n\n-----\n\n### COVID-19 AS A FORCE-MULTIPLIER IN ATTACKS\n\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19 dramatically affected every aspect of cybersecurity. Attackers felt\nemboldened to target the newly-homebound white collar workforce. An already high level of anxiety and\nfear permeating the public sphere was only exacerbated by waves of spam campaigns, ransomware that\ntargeted weakened or broken institutions or civil society that was already under financial pressure, and\nevery manner of rent-seeking fraud and profiteering from scarcity of everything from PPE to toilet paper.\n\n### Home is the new perimeter\n\nEverything normal ended in March 2020, when workers who could work remotely, and students at almost\nall levels, were sent home in a mad dash to halt the spread of COVID-19 and relieve the pressure on\novercrowded hospitals. Suddenly, we weren’t so much working from home as living at work.\n\nMany people struggled to find the new normal without a commute to the office. Demand for VPN access\nand multifactor authentication services surged. Chromebooks became rare commodities. Zoom went\nthrough about ten years’ worth of evolutionary growth in two months. And through it all, Microsoft, Adobe,\nApple, and Google were releasing updates and maintenance patch releases for a multitude of platforms.\n\nCOVID-19 and Coronavirus Email Scams on the Rise\n\n3%3%\n\n2.68%\n\n2.5%\n\n2.25%2.25%\n\n1.99%\n\n1.74%\n\n1.77%\n\n1.42%\n\n1.5%1.5% 1.33% 1.31%\n\n1.19%\n\n1.08% 1.36%\n\n1.01%\n\n0.75%0.75%\n\n0.72%\n\n0.58% 0.59%\n\n0%0%\n\n0606 0707 0808 0909 1010 1111 1212 1313 1414 1515 1616 1717 1818 1919 2020 2121\n\nMarch\n\nFig.13. Globally, a significant portion of spam email mentioned COVID-19 or Coronavirus in the weeks after the lockdown. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nCOVID-19 turned us all into our own IT departments, managing patches, security updates, and connectivity\nissues that kept us from getting into meetings or the kids from being able to attend a virtual classroom.\nDemand soared for headsets, microphones, better lighting, and security both on the network and the\nendpoint. And it meant giving even young kids a crash course in phishing, spam, online trolls, cyberbullying\nand malware disguised as a free copy of your favorite game, ready to play.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt hasn’t been easy, and we’re still not operating where we were in February 2020, but many people are\nfinding the new normal might, in some ways, be an improvement. More offices have decided to continue\nallowing remote work even after lockdowns end and people could return to the workplace, which will have a\nsignificant benefit to both the environment and to people’s quality of life.\n\nAs those workplace perimeters stretch and expand to encompass big portions of the workforce in their\nremote locations, circumstances have enhanced the seriousness with which we view home networks’ role\nas the last line of defense. The modem in the hall closet is now the network perimeter. We need a complete\nrethink of how to provide that structure with defense in depth.\n\n### Crimeware as a service\n\nIt can be helpful to think of malware makers as a form of software startup. Scrappy at first, the successful\nmakers eventually earn a loyal following. And there can be just as many business models for malicious\nsoftware as there are for legitimate software.\n\nThe term “crimeware” is intentionally broad; some creators of malware, or of the tools that enable malware\nto be delivered with ease or to enhance it with new features, don’t sell their product outright, but license it\nas you might buy a one-year license for the Adobe Creative Suite. We’ve called this class of business model\n“crimeware-as-a-service,” (CaaS) and it seems poised to be the new normal.\n\nOne of the more notorious examples of a CaaS malware is Emotet. The spam-delivered trojan has been\naround for years, and seems to be centered around a smooth experience for the would-be criminal. Emotet\nis one of a class of malware collectively referred to by security researchers as loaders. Emotet exists\nprimarily to deliver other malware to a target’s computer. It accomplishes this job with a sophisticated\nnetwork that distributes weaponized spam emails to large volumes of targets.\n\nFig.14. Source: SophosLabs.\n\n\n-----\n\nEmotet, however, has gone through two dark periods so far this year. The malware remained in\ncommunication with its C2 servers over a nearly five-month period in which the spam emails that normally\ndeliver attacks evaporated completely. Spam emails delivering Emotet mysteriously resumed in July.\n\nDharma ransomware is another CaaS malware of note. Unlike its pricier relations, Dharma maintains a fixed,\nsmall ransom. The reason comes down to Dharma’s business model: It’s the ransomware with training\nwheels on, for aspiring criminals who need to learn the ropes. Those criminals pay essentially a subscription\nfee to obtain payloads from the Dharma creators, and split the proceeds of any attacks with them.\n\nAs attackers branch out into specialties and sub-specialties, it seems the business model in which\ncriminals work with independent contractors, freelancers and affiliates is one that doesn’t seem to be going\naway anytime soon.\n\n### Spam, scams, and broken promises\n\nThe lockdowns across the world were accompanied by a flood of scams abetted by spam email. In the best\nof times, the most effective spam campaigns introduce a sense of urgency to demands that the recipient\nact on the message. This is a well-known psychological trick, because if you take a couple of moments to\nthink about the contents of the spam message, you’ll probably realize it’s a fake. If the spammer triggers a\nfear reaction, you act before you think, and you get snared in the trap.\n\nCOVID-19 already had everyone on a hair trigger, so spammers didn’t even have to try particularly hard.\n\nFig.15.

How we work, go to school, attend events and\nconferences, and entertain ourselves may have changed forever, and cloud computing was an essential\nelement of that rapid evolution, but it faces a lot of challenges.\n\nThe overprovisioning of access permissions, limited visibility of assets and resources in the cloud and a\nlack of auditing, can all make cloud environments more vulnerable to cyberthreats and malware is about as\nbad in the cloud as it is everywhere else. For instance, cryptojacking is a growing problem in the cloud. The\ncomputing-cycles-heavy cryptominer processes are bad enough when they run on physical machines, and\nrun up the electricity bill; they create an even more painful side effect when they run on cloud instances:\nThe target gets billed by the cloud provider for the CPU cycles consumed by its virtual workstations\nperforming the heavy math required to deliver a few pennies’ worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nFurther, many dispersed, remote workforces have been hit by ransomware attacks, where criminals locked\ndown the cloud infrastructure the same way they targeted physical machines. After all, ransomware can\nencrypt a virtual hard drive or object storage just as easily as physical storage. Organizations whose cloud\ninfrastructure is attacked with ransomware can find themselves hit not only with a bill for the cycles spent\nencrypting the data, but for the ransom, too.\n\nOrganizations suffering security incidents in the last year\n\nMalware 34%\n\nExposed Data 29%\n\nRansomware 28%\n\nAccount\n\n25%\n\nCompromise\n\nCryptojacking 17%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40%\n\nFig.20. In our 2020 Cloud Security Report, Sophos surveyed more than 3,500 IT professionals about their experience using the cloud, and found that many of\nthe security problems plaguing physical networks have translated over to the virtual ones. Source: SophosLabs.\n\nOn lockdown, IT departments needed a way to service a virtual helpdesk like they staffed a real one before\nmany workplaces closed down. The big changes COVID-19 demanded came in three waves.\n\nIn the first few weeks after the lockdowns began, the first wave – an access wave – began to take shape.\nAs millions of workers, suddenly unable to go to their workplace, needed to access resources inside their\norganization’s environment, rapidly growing demand for virtual private network (VPN) or other zero-trust\nfacility access overwhelmed existing resources. Along with VPNs, organizations found they needed to add\nnew firewalls and other security appliances, deployments of modern unified threat management systems\nsupplemented the rudimentary layer 3 firewalls provided by cloud services.\n\nIn the pre-COVID-19 world, VPNs only saw moderate use as employees in the workplace vastly\noutnumbered traveling or remote workers. As March turned into May and then June, for these workers, the\nVPN became an essential lifeline (if not the essential lifeline) that kept organizations in operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut those organizations also quickly realized that employees shouldn’t use personal devices from home to\naccess the VPN, and a dwindling supply of new laptops created a new challenge for organizations already\nstruggling with the IT needs of a distributed workforce. Without enough physical machines, for the time\nbeing, organizations turned to the seemingly unlimited resource of virtual machines to fill the need for a\nsecure computing workspace. That began the second wave – the virtual desktop wave.\n\nAs more employees transitioned into using a virtual corporate desktop, the move to hosting those desktops\nin the cloud made practical and cost sense, but they still required protection.\n\nSuddenly, IT departments supported hundreds or thousands of employee VMs, and suddenly needed\nvisibility tools to be able to inventory and securely configure the growing cloud estate of virtual servers,\nvirtual desktops, and other cloud services – the cloud management wave.\n\nAttack Timeline\n\n\nAccess keys \u0003\n\nstolen\u0003\n(from SCM)\n\n\nAttacker \u0003\naccesses cloud\u0003\n\naccount\n\n\nMonitors\n\n\u0003account\n\n\u0003activity\n\n\nAutomates\n\u0003provisioning\n\u0003of instances\n\n\nHardens\n\u0003settings and\u0003\nrevokes access\n\n\nFig.21. A cryptojacking attack we investigated began when a developer inadvertently embedded their cloud credentials into code on a public repository.\nThe attacker discovered, then used those credentials to attack, using the native cloud provider’s APIs – spinning up hundreds of VM instances to mine Bitcoin.\nAt the same time, they automated features on those instances to make them harder to terminate. Later, they revoked access to other legitimate users.\nSource: SophosLabs.\n\nThe COVID-19 era has been marked by great transformation in every aspect of human life, including how\nmany work. In a recent survey by Reuters, 97% of CEOs and CTOs surveyed said that the lockdowns sped\nup their transition to new technology. But in times of tight budgets and uncertainty, nearly one out of every\n[three of those CTOs reported their mandate was to implement these changes in as cost-effective a way](https://www.raconteur.net/infographics/covid-catalyst/)\npossible.\n\nIn Sophos’ most recent Cloud Security Report, we found that the majority of security incidents\ninvolving cloud computing came down to two primary root causes: stolen or phished credentials, or\nmisconfigurations that led to breaches. Seven out of ten of the more than 3,700 IT professionals surveyed\nfor the report claimed that the cloud infrastructure they support had experienced a breach in the 12 months\nprior to the survey.\n\n\n-----\n\n### What the CCTC means for a rapid response to large scale threats\n\nAbout a week into the COVID-19 lockdown, Sophos chief scientist,\nJoshua Saxe put out a global call for volunteers. The virtual bucket\nbrigade rapidly became the COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition\n(CCTC), an organization numbering more than 4,000 members in\nservice of one goal: To put special effort into countering any type of\nthreat or social engineering that attempted to leverage the public’s\nfear about COVID-19, by name or inference.\n\n“I’m not a firefighter, so I wouldn’t know how to fight a building\nfire, but I can assist a team that’s going to bolster the defenses of\ncritical infrastructure, like hospitals,” says CCTC’s Nick Espinosa, a\nsecurity analyst and podcaster based in Chicago.\n\nThis was a very necessary effort. From the earliest points of the\nlockdown period, attackers spread spam, malware, and a variety of\nother threats that made reference, in one form or another, to the\nfrightening, new pandemic lingo. As mentioned in the main report,\nat one point, people were registering thousands of new domains\nwith the words COVID-19, corona, or CoV in their names, each day.\nSophos traced domains connected to TLS certificates with those\nsame text strings in the certificate data and found thousands more.\n\nFig.22. Source: Sophos.\n\nCOVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition member growth\n\n4500\n\n3375\n\n2250\n\n1125\n\n0\n19 01 15 01 15 01 14\n\nMarch April May June\n\nNew members Total members\n\nFig.23. Source: Sophos.\n\n\nBecause of the unique nature of the threat posed by COVID-19,\nmalicious spam that abuses the global crisis represents something\nparticularly egregious and offensive. “We saw an explosion\nof criminal hacking using COVID-19 as a lure,” said Espinosa.\nSpam campaigns spun up, in which the spammers dressed\nthe messages like official communiques from the World Health\nOrganization, the CDC in the US, the UK’s NHS, drug companies, or\nnational health authorities in countries outside the US and UK.\n\nAnalysts also saw references to COVID-19 in strings inside of\nbinaries and used as variables in so-called living-off-the-land,\nLOLscripts.\n\nCCTC participants shared samples and intelligence about all\nmanner of incidents through a hastily set-up Slack. Chaotic at first,\nthe organization formed a rudimentary structure quickly. “So many\npeople came together and were fire-hosing so much information,”\nEspinosa says.\n\n\nThe CCTC’s product, the collected output, is its intelligence feed\nlisting newly-gathered indicators of compromise. The feed is\nfree to use, by anyone. These IoCs complement the defensive\ntechnologies already in place, in a vendor-neutral way. When the\nCCTC formed a partnership with the Cyber Threat Alliance, the\nsecurity vendors that participate in the CTA amplified the protective\neffect of CCTC’s threat intelligence by ingesting and defending\nagainst those threats.\n\nThe rapid coalescence of security professionals, sharing a common\ngoal, was heartwarming, says Espinosa. “We probably were a hot\nmess out of the gate,” he says, but the group self-organized quickly.\nThe completion of the CCTC sharing platform means anyone who\nmight need to respond to a COVID-19-like pandemic in the future\nwon’t have to reinvent the wheel, and can respond more readily\nto threats – a healthy metaphor for, and analogue of, the immune\nsystem itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n### NOT LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN: THREATS VIA NONTRADITIONAL PLATFORMS\n\nWe live in a world surrounded by computing devices that don’t look like a computer or server: routers,\nmobile phones, firewalls, smart TVs, streaming boxes, VoIP boxes, cameras and camera doorbells, network\nattached storage, some brands of kitchen and laundry appliances, and on and on.\n\nBut just because they don’t look like traditional computers, it doesn’t mean they can’t be misused or abused\nin the same way.\n\n### Android Joker malware growing in volume\n\nAndroid users find themselves in the middle of an arms race between Google (which owns the Android\nplatform and its primary Google Play Store) and malware creators who want their malware listed for\ndownload on the Google Play Store. Google has spent years on a system designed to inspect source code\nof Android apps submitted for inclusion in the Google Play Store, in search of chunks of code that indicate a\nmalicious intent or an undesirable outcome for an Android user. Malware app developers have had to work\nhard to evade the Google Play Store code checks.\n\n[Joker, aka Bread, is a premium SMS and billing fraud app, one of the more successful examples of a](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/01/pha-family-highlights-bread-and-friends.html)\nmalware family that has evolved to evade these code checks. Google has removed thousands of these\nJoker-modified malicious apps from the Google Play Store since last year, when researchers first\ndiscovered it. Despite the amount of effort put in to getting rid of the malware, Joker keeps bouncing back.\n\nJoker appears in the guise of a wide range of different apps: utilities and tools, wallpapers, translators,\nmessaging services – just many clones of popular apps. Remember, Joker may actually be embedded in an\napp that looks and works exactly like the real version of almost any app you use. The Joker apps just have\na little extra malware code buried deep, in one of the third-party libraries app makers routinely compile into\ntheir apps for a variety of legitimate reasons.\n\nThere are a few reasons why Joker manages a successful evasion of Google Play Store security code\nchecks time and time again:\n\n1. The malicious apps use obfuscation, from simple string substitution to complex commercial packers, to\n\nslow analysis and fool the Google Play Store.\n\n2. When the Joker “developer” launches the app, it contains absolutely no malicious code. This establishes\n\na history where the app that comes into Google Play Store is clean. Only later does the malicious code\nappear in the app, following an update.\n\n3. The app either decrypts its payload at runtime or downloads it dynamically, later.\n\nJoker malware uses native code (JNI) instead of the more common DEX. Native code uses C for\nprogramming, which slows down the analysis of malicious code. By comparison, DEX, being a variation\non Java code, is much easier to decompile into something human-readable. The malware uses this JNI\ncode for sending SMS messages, to make money and as one way of contacting its command-and-control\nnetwork. The use of JNI and out-of-band signalling over the phone network instead of the internet may help\nJoker evade automated dex scanners that don’t speak JNI.\n\nJoker clearly has developed an edge in the battle against Google’s automated code review on new apps,\nand we see no sign that Joker will slow down in 2021 and may be joined by competitors before long.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ads & PUAs increasingly indistinguishable from malware\n\nMalicious advertisements (malvertising) remain a major source of threats to a range of devices. We recently\ndelved into two current trends in malvertising threats that fall outside the realm of malware attacks—\ntechnical support scams using “browser locking” web pages, and ads targeting mobile devices that are\nlinked to fraudulent or “fleeceware” apps. Sophos classifies these as “fake alert” attacks—malvertisements\nthat attempt to scare their targets into taking an action that will enrich the scammers behind them.\n\nFig. 24. Source: SophosLabs\n\nTechnical support scams typically attempt to steer targets into providing remote access to their computers\nand then convincing them to either purchase exorbitantly priced technical support software and services\nor obtain targets’ credit card data for fraudulent purposes. While many of these scams have relied on direct\ntelemarketing calls in the past, many scam operators have moved to a “pull” model—using malicious web\nadvertisements that attempt to convince the user that their computers have been locked for security\nreasons, and directing them to call the scammers themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo achieve this, the scammers deploy website kits containing scripts designed to make it difficult to\nnavigate away from a page— including variations on the “evil cursor” (making the mouse pointer appear to\nbe pointing somewhere it isn’t, or rendering it invisible) and “infinite download” attacks that overwhelm the\nbrowser—while trying to look like an alert from Microsoft or Apple. Some of the kits we found exploited a bug\nSophosLabs’ offensive security team discovered in Firefox earlier this year, while others executed similar\nattacks on other browsers—all of them being spread through malicious “pop-under” web ads.\n\nFig. 25. Source: SophosLabs\n\nThe same ad network infrastructure supporting these attacks on PC and Mac browsers also serves up\ntech support scams and fake alerts that link to potentially unwanted mobile applications—including apps\nclaiming to be virtual private network services and “cleaner” tools advertised as removing malware, with\nbuilt-in subscription fees (and in some cases, actual Android malware). Sophos found a collection of ad\ncampaign servers delivering these ads, using commercial software from a Russian developer specifically\nbuilt for running such campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Using your own strengths against you: Criminal abuse of security tools\n\nSome attacks don’t involve malware at all, or wait to deliver malware until the very end of the attack,\ninstead using just the tools already on the operating systems running on computers across a network.\nOther criminals may leverage the power of a range of tools used by two large segments of the information\nsecurity industry: incident responders and penetration testers.\n\nThe information security community has defined the style of attacks that involve very little or no malware,\nbut instead harness the existing components of the operating system or popular software packages,\npular software packages, as living-off-the-land (LOL). These attacks usually involve one or more forms of\nautomation in the form of native scripting such as PowerShell, batch files, or VBScript scripts, collectively\nreferred to as LOLscripts. The attackers use these LOLscripts to execute sequences of commands using\nliving-off-the-land binaries (applications), colloquially called LOLbins.\n\nSoftware originally designed for the “red team” segment of the industry comprises the bring your own\nattack method. Attackers, in this case, deploy and use off-the-shelf security tools that are commonly used\nby network administrators and penetration testers. These include tools such as Cobalt Strike and elements\nof the Metasploit framework, designed for use in security assessments and technical tests.\n\nNetwalker threat actor toolset on the ATT&CK matrix\n\nPRIVILEGE DEFENSE CREDENTIAL LATERAL\nINITIAL ACCESS EXECUTION DISCOVERY\nESCALATION EVASION ACCESS MOVEMENT\n\nPowerShell SoftPerfect\nExploit Tomcat CVE-2020-0796 Fileless loading mimikatz psexec\n\nscripts Network Scanner\n\nExploit Weblogic psexec CVE-2019-1458 Eset AV remover Mimidogz NLBrute Teamviewer\n\nGordon's Eset\n\nPhishing email CVE-2017-0213 password Mimikittenz Anydesk\n\nrecovery\n\nTrend Micro's Windows\n\nCVE-2015-1701 Security Agent Credentials\n\nUninstall Tool Editor\n\nMicrosoft\nSecurity Client pwdump\n\nuninstall\n\nNLBrute\n\nLaZagne\n\nWinPwn\n\nFig. 26.

As such, Sophos must rely more heavily on the study of\nthe LOLscripted behavior to identify potential malicious activity. And of course, it’s easier to use something\nthat’s already been created than to build your own tools from scratch.\n\n|INITIAL ACCESS|EXECUTION|PRIVILEGE ESCALATION|DEFENSE EVASION|CREDENTIAL ACCESS|DISCOVERY|LATERAL MOVEMENT|IMPACT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Exploit Tomcat|PowerShell scripts|CVE-2020-0796|Fileless loading|mimikatz|SoftPerfect Network Scanner|psexec|Netwalker ransomware|\n|Exploit Weblogic|psexec|CVE-2019-1458|Eset AV remover|Mimidogz|NLBrute|Teamviewer|Zeppelin ransomware|\n|Phishing email||CVE-2017-0213|Gordon's Eset password recovery|Mimikittenz||Anydesk|Smaug ransomware|\n|||CVE-2015-1701|Trend Micro's Security Agent Uninstall Tool|Windows Credentials Editor|||Data exfiltration|\n||||Microsoft Security Client uninstall|pwdump||||\n|||||NLBrute||||\n|||||LaZagne||||\n|||||WinPwn||||\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the use of LOLscripts and reverse shells wasn’t new the past year, in 2020 they became a ubiquitous\nelement of complex, manually operated ransomware break-in attacks.

What percentage of command line\nexecutions are executed by undetected adversaries? What\npercentage of targeted phishing emails go undetected? How do\nall these rates change as a function of industry, geolocation, and\nnetwork posture?\n\nAsking such questions is similar to asking, “what percentage of\npeople are infected with COVID-19?” in a context in which many\npeople might never get tested for the virus, those tests that are\nperformed can have significant false positive and false negative\nrates.\n\nIn other words: it’s hard.\n\nDespite these challenges, epidemiologists answer critical\nquestions about COVID-19 daily. Unfortunately, cybersecurity\nresearchers fail to do the same for cyberattacks. We lag behind\nepidemiologists in the tools, techniques and procedures we’ve built\nto reason under uncertainty. There’s no excuse, and it’s time we\nbuilt our own tools to understand the nature of the threat we face,\naccurately report risks to those we defend, and make decisions\nabout where to direct our efforts.\n\nTo help in this mission, Sophos AI has embarked on the project\nof building a set of epidemiology-inspired statistical models for\nestimating the prevalence of malware infections in total. We\ncombine a robust data collection pipeline that collects data from\n100 million endpoints with a set of Bayesian statistical methods\nthat let us tackle these difficult questions to build a complete\npicture of the performance of our models “in the field”.\n\n\nFor example, consider the question: “How much malware is\nactually affecting our customers week over week, and how much of\nthat are we detecting?”\n\nIf we already knew which files were malware and which were\nbenign for all files, we’d already be done! Unfortunately, we have\ntwo problems.\n\n1. We don’t actually know the ground truth behind any given file\n\n– any endpoint product will miss at least some malware, and\nthe occasional false positive (a normal file that gets flagged as\nmalware) is inevitable\n\n2. The balance between benign and malicious files is\n\noverwhelmingly tipped towards benign ones, so we probably\ncan’t figure it out with manual analysis – we’d have to do an indepth analysis of thousands of files that our endpoint product\nlabeled as benign to find a single malicious one\n\nTo address these problems, we turn to Bayesian statistics. In\nextremely simple terms, we build a “generative” model of the data:\na mathematical program that can take guesses about parameters\n(“how much malware is there really?”), and turn those guesses\ninto simulations of how many endpoint detections we might see.\nThen we try out different guesses, see which simulations match\nobserved reality, and work backwards to find plausible values of the\nparameter we’re interested in.\n\nFor example, imagine we have 2,000 endpoint detections and a\ngood estimate of model true and false positive rates for a particular\nweek. We can simulate worlds with malware rates of 0%, 2%, 5%,\nand so on, and see what the simulation predicts for endpoint\ndetections; if we see close to 2,000 detections for some malware\nrates, then that’s (perhaps) a plausible value.\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0.024 0.026 0.028 0.030 0.032 0.034 0.036\n\n\n_4 detections_\n\n\n_1,980 detections_\n\n\n_2,070 detections_\n\n\n_22,100 detections_\n\n\n_34,276 detections_\n\n\nFig. 28.

In our\nexample, the model thinks that the most likely value for “what\npercentage of files are malware?” is just over 3%, but anything from\nabout 2.75% to about 3.35% is quite plausible.\n\nAnd once we have a good idea of this number – how many files\nper hundred are likely to be malware across customer endpoints\n– missed detections and false positives become fairly simple\nto estimate.

In\nthis case we see that while we do have some false negatives, the\nnumber of false positives is low and skewed towards zero, while the\nnumber of true positives is high and skewed towards 161,000 (the\ntotal number of positive results in the sample). Looking at the scale,\nwe can see that all three quantities are dwarfed by the number of\ntrue negatives – benign files that our ML labeled as benign.\n\nOur epidemiology-inspired tool has allowed us to estimate, if not\nfind, the needles in our PE file haystack.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnited Kingdom and Worldwide Sales\nTel: +44 (0)8447 671131\nEmail: sales@sophos.com\n\n\nNorth American Sales\nToll Free: 1-866-866-2802\nEmail: nasales@sophos.com\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand Sales\nTel: +61 2 9409 9100\nEmail: sales@sophos.com.au\n\n\nAsia Sales\nTel: +65 62244168\nEmail: salesasia@sophos.com\n\n\n© Copyright 2020.
