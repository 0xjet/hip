Initially discovered in 2019, the backdoor](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/)\n[remains in use three years later. It is used by the Lazarus group against a wide variety of](https://securelist.com/andariel-deploys-dtrack-and-maui-ransomware/107063/)\ntargets. For example, we’ve seen it being used in financial environments where ATMs were\n[breached, in attacks on a nuclear power plant and also in targeted ransomware attacks.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant-dtrack-north-korea-atms-1614200-2019-10-30)\nEssentially, anywhere the Lazarus group believes they can achieve some financial gain.\n\nDTrack allows criminals to upload, download, start or delete files on the victim host. Among\nthose downloaded and executed files already spotted in the standard DTrack toolset there is\na keylogger, a screenshot maker and a module for gathering victim system information. With\na toolset like this, criminals can implement lateral movement into the victims’ infrastructure in\norder to, for example, retrieve compromising information.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs part of our crimeware reporting service, we published a new private report about recent\nDtrack activity. In this public article we highlight some of the main findings shared in that\nreport. For more information about our crimeware reporting service, please contact\n[crimewareintel@kaspersky.com.](mailto:crimewareintel@kaspersky.com)\n\n## So, what’s new?\n\nDTrack itself hasn’t changed much over the course of time. Nevertheless, there are some\ninteresting modifications that we want to highlight in this blogpost. Dtrack hides itself inside\nan executable that looks like a legitimate program, and there are several stages of\ndecryption before the malware payload starts.\n\n### First stage – implanted code\n\nDTrack unpacks the malware in several stages. The second stage is stored inside the\nmalware PE file. To get it, there are two approaches:\n\noffset based;\nresource based.\n\nThe idea is that DTrack retrieves the payload by reading it from an offset within the file or by\nreading it from a resource within the PE binary. An example of a decompiled pseudo function\nthat retrieves the data using the offset-based approach can be found below.\n\n**_Example of DTrack offset-oriented retrieval function_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter retrieving the location of the next stage and its key, the malware then decrypts the\nbuffer (with a modified RC4 algorithm) and passes control to it. To figure out the offset of the\npayload, its size and decryption keys, DTrack has a special binary (we have dubbed it\n‘Decrypt config’) structure hidden in an inconspicuous part of the PE file.\n\n### Second stage – shellcode\n\nThe second stage payload consists of heavily obfuscated shellcode as can be seen below.\n\n**_Heavily obfuscated second stage shellcode_**\n\nThe encryption method used by the second layer differs for each sample. So far, we have\nspotted modified versions of RC4, RC5 and RC6 algorithms. The values of the third stage\npayload and its decryption key are obtained by reading Decrypt config again.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne new aspect of the recent DTrack variants is that the third stage payload is not\nnecessarily the final payload; there may be another piece of binary data consisting of a\nbinary configuration and at least one shellcode, which in turn decrypts and executes the final\npayload.\n\n### Third stage – shellcode and final binary\n\nThe shellcode has some quite interesting obfuscation tricks to make analysis more difficult.\nWhen started, the beginning of the key (used to decrypt the final payload) is searched for.\nFor example, when the beginning of the key is 0xDEADBEEF, the shellcode searches for the\nfirst occurrence of 0xDEADBEEF.\n\n**_Chunk decryption routine example_**\n\nOnce the key is found, the shellcode uses it to decrypt the next eight bytes after the key,\nwhich form yet another configuration block with final payload size and its entry point\n**offset. The configuration block is followed by an encrypted PE payload that starts at the**\n**_entry point offset after decryption with the custom algorithm._**\n\n### Final payload\n\nOnce the final payload (a DLL) is decrypted, it is loaded using process hollowing into\n_explorer.exe. In previous DTrack samples the libraries to be loaded were obfuscated strings._\nIn more recent versions they use API hashing to load the proper libraries and functions.\nAnother small change is that three C2 servers are used instead of six. The rest of the\npayload’s functionality remains the same.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we look at the domain names used for C2 servers, a pattern can be seen in some\ncases. For example, the actors combine a color with the name of an animal (e.g., pinkgoat,\npurplebear, salmonrabbit). Some of the peculiar names used in the DTrack infrastructure can\nbe found below:\n\n**Domain** **IP** **First seen** **ASN**\n\npinkgoat.com 64.190.63.111 2022‑03‑03 15:34 AS47846\n\npurewatertokyo.com 58.158.177.102 2022‑05‑20 16:07 AS17506\n\npurplebear.com 52.128.23.153 2021‑01‑08 08:37 AS19324\n\nsalmonrabbit.com 58.158.177.102 2022‑05‑20 09:37 AS17506\n\n## Victims\n\nAccording to KSN telemetry, we have detected DTrack activity in Germany, Brazil, India, Italy,\nMexico, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States, indicating that DTrack is\nspreading into more parts of the world. The targeted sectors are education, chemical\nmanufacturing, governmental research centers and policy institutes, IT service providers,\nutility providers and telecommunications.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe DTrack backdoor continues to be used actively by the Lazarus group. Modifications in\nthe way the malware is packed show that Lazarus still sees DTrack as an important asset.\nDespite this, Lazarus has not changed the backdoor much since 2019, when it was initially\ndiscovered. When the victimology is analyzed, it becomes clear that operations have\nexpanded to Europe and Latin America, a trend we’re seeing more and more often.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**C2 domains**\n\n[pinkgoat[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/pinkgoat.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[purewatertokyo[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/purewatertokyo.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[purplebear[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/purplebear.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[salmonrabbit[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/salmonrabbit.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**MD5**\n\n[1A74C8D8B74CA2411C1D3D22373A6769](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/1A74C8D8B74CA2411C1D3D22373A6769/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[67F4DAD1A94ED8A47283C2C0C05A7594](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/67F4DAD1A94ED8A47283C2C0C05A7594/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/malware/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Konstantin Zykov](https://securelist.com/author/konstantinzykov/)\n\n[Jornt van der Wiel](https://securelist.com/author/jorntvanderwiel/)\n\nDTrack activity targeting Europe and Latin America\n\nYour email address will not be published.
