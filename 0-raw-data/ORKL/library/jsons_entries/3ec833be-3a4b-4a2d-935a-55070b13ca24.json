Volatile Cedar constantly monitors its victims’ actions and\nrapidly responds to detection incidents.\n_Explosive is a specially crafted Trojan type of malware, implanted in targets and used_\nto harvest information. New and custom versions are developed, compiled and\ndeployed for specific targets.\nThe primary goal of the attackers appears to be data collection, not to cause harm to\ntargets/use their resources or steal financial assets.\n\n**The Targets:**\n\nOnly a small number (hundreds as opposed to thousands) of targets have been\nidentified to date. We would normally expect that a cyber-crime campaign targeting\nfinancial institutions would result in much higher numbers of victims. The limited\nnumber of targets may be part of an attempt to avoid unnecessary exposure.\nIdentified targets are organizations in the fields of telecommunications, media, web\nhosting, academia, defense contractors and civil services.\n\nAll of these points indicate a highly crafted operation directed at specific and carefully\nselected targets.\n\n**Something Old, Something New**\n\nAfter going public with our findings, we were provided with a new configuration belonging to\na newly discovered sample we have never seen before.\n\nThe sample itself is the same Explosive v3.0 implant, but it differs in the following aspects:\n\nA different DGA seed is used (flashplayergetadobe) to create new C2 servers. The only\none we have noted so far is registered by the operators as “getadobeflashplayer[.]net”\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of the victims of this thread are Saudi Arabia-based.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nWe want to present our attribution case with stronger evidence to back up our claims and\nprovide a more detailed explanation.\n\nThere were many questions raised by our colleagues and customers as to how and why we\ncame to the conclusion that this operation originated in Lebanon.\n\nThrough careful analysis of the operation, both previously known victims and C2 servers as\nwell as targets infected with the sample containing the newly discovered configuration, we\nwere able to create a heat map of the infections.\n\nLooking at the target map of the operation we see the following:\n\nAlthough there are infections all over the world, the highest concentration of infections is in\nthe Middle East – specifically in Israel, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo why do we still say that the group behind Volatile Cedar is Lebanese?\n\nIf we take a closer look at the targets, we see the distribution of the victims themselves\nbased on industry vertical:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf we dig deeper and look into the distribution of the hacked websites on the hosting services,\nwe notice the following two interesting facts:\n\n1. The victim sites on the compromised web services were primarily Middle Eastern web\n\nsites. This is true not only for the majority of the infections in Israel, Lebanon and Saudi\nArabia, but all over the world as well.\n2. The majority of the victimized sites themselves belong to different companies that work\n\nwith national and defense companies.\n\nThese observations about the victims allow us to assume that the operators behind this\nactivity maintain high interest in the region and its politics.\n\nOther indications we found about the operators:\n\nThe strings inside the binary code in Arabic:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PE resources inside the malware files are in Lebanese Arabic\n\nCompilation times – The time stamps correlate to the working hours of the Lebanese time\nzone (GMT+ 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the C2 servers are hosted in Lebanon (true for the first Explosive version).\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the domains used in the campaign were at some point registered to Lebanese\naddresses – a fact that was later changed by the operators.\n\n**A few words on the attackers’ modus operandi**\n\nDisclaimer: Any assumptions made or conclusions drawn are based solely on our analysis of\ndata from a limited group of targeted systems. As our sample size is admittedly restricted, it\nis possible that the attackers may also exhibit other behaviors that we have not encountered\nto date.\n\nIn the cases in which we have analyzed victim data, we saw the following interesting\ninformation:\n\n**_One site to rule them all_**\n\nLooking at victim data from the hosting companies, we noticed that the compromise of a\nsingle website led to the compromise of almost all the sites hosted by this service.\n\n**_One is enough_**\n\n\n-----\n\nPreviously, we described that a typical attack begins with a vulnerability scan followed by a\nweb shell injection to the compromised site. Based on analyzed victim data, we found that\nonly one of the compromised sites per hosting service contained a web shell. The rest of the\nsites were most likely accessed using stolen admin credentials.\n\n**_Continuous deployment_**\n\nWhen we reviewed the logs of different victims, we found that version upgrades were almost\nalways automated and occurred within seconds of each other.\n\n**_OP-SEC? NOP-SEC!_**\n\nIn such a highly targeted operation, you would expect the operators to try and cover their\ntracks as much as possible. However, they left hints about their identity at almost every step\nof the way (see our earlier case for attribution). In the midst of our investigation of the\ninfected machines, we discovered old tools or old key logging data collected by the malware\nwas not removed, thereby exposing the operation to greater possibilities of discovery.\n\n**_Hide in plain “site”_**\n\nDealing with an operation of this scope, with such carefully chosen targets, we would have\nexpected a higher quality of malware development. These days, even the simplest malwares\nare packed to avoid detection, do not contain useless functions and code, or use obfuscated\nstrings – all things we have noted to be poorly executed in Explosive and the other tools\nused in this campaign.\n\n**Appendix – Indicators**\n\n**_Explosive
