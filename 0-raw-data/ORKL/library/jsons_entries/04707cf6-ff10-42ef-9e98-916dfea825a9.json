the other was a piece](http://www.espn.co.uk/sports/soccer/story/_/id/23961564/world-cup-predictions-craig-burley-rafa-ramos-nicolas-baier-share-top-spot)\nfrom [an article detailing Supreme Leader's visit to Singapore.](http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21430/procession-of-chinese-and-north-korean-jets-have-airlifted-kim-and-company-to-singapore)\n\n\n-----\n\nWord document with macro that downloads DOGCALL RAT\nIf the lure worked and the victim opened the document and enabled macro code, they\nwould read one of the two texts as if it was a regular document, just like seen in the image\nbelow, while the DOGCALL RAT downloaded and installed in the background.\n\nMacro code shows decoy text while RAT installs in the background\n\n\n-----\n\n## New dropper found for an old RAT\n\nIf NOKKI or KONNI have not been attributed to North Korean operations in the past,\nDOGCALL has been associated with the cyber activity led by Pyongyang, more specifically\nwith the [Reaper group, also known as APT37, Group123, FreeMilk, StarCruft, Operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-new-north-korean-hacker-group-is-making-a-name-for-itself/)\nDaybreak and Operation Erebus.\n\nWhile disentangling the deobfuscation and download routines used by the macro in the\n'World Cup predictions' document, the researchers also noticed a malware dropper that has\nnot been reported before, which they called Final1stspy.\n\nThe final payload delivered by Final1stspy is from the DOGCALL family and it can take\nscreenshots, log keystrokes, exfiltrate files, download and execute other payloads or\ncapture audio through the computer's microphone.\n\nUnit 42's research adds new pieces to the North Korean cyberespionage operations puzzle\nand shows that even nation-state actors make mistakes that lead to revealing the author\nbehind the malicious tools, or at least pin them under the same operator.\n\nUsing information about tools already attributed to the DPRK (Democratic People’s\nRepublic of Korea) cyberspionage enterprises, security researchers recently have built a\n[malware family tree showing how various operations between 2009 and 2017 connect to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-first-look-at-the-north-korean-malware-family-tree/)\neach other, some of them unattributed to the government in Pyongyang.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[North Korean hackers targeting journalists with novel malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/north-korean-hackers-targeting-journalists-with-novel-malware/)\n\n[Lazarus hackers target VMware servers with Log4Shell exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lazarus-hackers-target-vmware-servers-with-log4shell-exploits/)\n\n[North Korean devs pose as US freelancers to aid DRPK govt hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/north-korean-devs-pose-as-us-freelancers-to-aid-drpk-govt-hackers/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[US sanctions Bitcoin laundering service used by North Korean hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-sanctions-bitcoin-laundering-service-used-by-north-korean-hackers/)\n\n[APT37](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt37/)\n[North Korea](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/north-korea/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
