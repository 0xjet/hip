hack\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/morgan-stanley-reports-data-breach-after-vendor-accellion-hack/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/morgan-stanley-reports-data-breach-after-vendor-accellion-hack/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJuly 8, 2021\n09:19 AM\n0\n\n_Image: Morgan Stanley_\n\nInvestment banking firm Morgan Stanley has reported a data breach after attackers stole\npersonal information belonging to its customers by hacking into the Accellion FTA server of a\nthird-party vendor.\n\nMorgan Stanley is a leading global financial services firm providing investment banking,\nsecurities, wealth and investment management services worldwide.\n\nThe American multinational company's clients include corporations, governments,\ninstitutions, and individuals in more than 41 countries.\n\n## Encrypted files stolen together with decryption key\n\n\n-----\n\nGuidehouse, a third-party vendor that provides account maintenance services to Morgan\nStanley's StockPlan Connect business, notified the investment banking company in May\n2021 that attackers hacked its Accellion FTA server to steal information belonging to Morgan\nStanley stock plan participants.\n\nThe Guidehouse server was breached by exploiting an Accellion FTA vulnerability in January\nbefore the vendor patched it within five days of the fix becoming available.\n\nGuidehouse discovered the breach in March and the impact to Morgan Stanley customers in\nMay, when it notified the financial services company of the incident and that no evidence was\nfound of the stolen data being disseminated online by the threat actors.\n\n\"There was no data security breach of any Morgan Stanley applications,\" Morgan Stanley\nsaid in data breach notification letters sent to impacted individuals.\n\n\"The incident involves files which were in Guidehouse’s possession, including encrypted files\nfrom Morgan Stanley.\"\n\nHowever, even though the stolen files were stored in encrypted form on the compromised\nGuidehouse Accellion FTA server, the threat actors also obtained the decryption key during\nthe attack.\n\nMorgan Stanley says that the documents stolen during this incident contained:\n\nStock plan participants' names\nAddresses (last known address)\nDates of birth\nSocial security numbers\nCorporate company names\n\nThe company added that the files stolen from Guidehouse's FTA server did not contain\npasswords information or credentials that the threat actors could use to gain access to\nimpacted Morgan Stanley customers' financial accounts.\n\n\"The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very\nseriously,\" a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told BleepingComputer. \"We are in close contact\nwith Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients.\"\n\n## Clop gang and FIN11 behind series of Accellion hacks\n\nWhile the attackers' identity was not disclosed in Morgan Stanley's data breach notification, a\n[joint statement published by Accellion and Mandiant from February shed more light on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/global-accellion-data-breaches-linked-to-clop-ransomware-gang/)\nattacks, directly linking them to the FIN11 cybercrime group.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Clop ransomware gang has also used an Accellion FTA zero-day vulnerability (disclosed\nin December 2020) to steal data from multiple companies.\n\nAccellion has said that roughly 300 customers used the 20-year-old legacy FTA software,\nwith less than 100 of them being breached in these attacks.\n\nStarting in January, BleepingComputer has reported multiple data breaches impacting\ncompanies and organizations after their Accellion FTA servers were compromised, allowing\nthe cybercrime groups to exfiltrate sensitive information.\n\nSo far, these threat actors have hit [energy giant
