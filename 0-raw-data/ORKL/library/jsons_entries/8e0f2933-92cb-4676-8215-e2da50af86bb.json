Learn more about this new ransomware and\nfortify your organization’s defenses against this threat.\n\nView infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: Black Basta\"\n\n\n-----\n\nac asta s a a so a e g oup ope at g as a so [a e as a se](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas) ce ( aaS) t at as t a y spotted p 0 t as s ce p o e\n[itself to be a formidable threat, as evidenced by its use of double-extortion tactics and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti) [expansion of its attack arsenal to include tools like the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/f/black-basta-ransomware-operators-expand-their-attack-arsenal-wit.html)\n[Qakbot trojan and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/qakbot-loader-returns-with-new-techniques-and-tools.html) [PrintNightmare exploit.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/detecting-printnightmare-exploit-attempts-with-trend-micro-vision-one-and-cloud-one.html)\n\nDetections of the Black Basta ransomware are currently low, likely because of how recently it was discovered. And like most modern\nransomware, Black Basta has a more targeted approach to choosing its victims rather than relying on spray-and-pray tactics. However, the\nspeed with which its malware authors have augmented their attack arsenal and developed a new Linux build merits further investigation of the\nemerging ransomware gang behind it.\n\n## What organizations need to know about Black Basta\n\nThe Black Basta [ransomware group quickly gained notoriety after it laid claim to massive breaches earlier this year. On April 20, 2022, a user](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware)\nunder the name “Black Basta” sought out corporate network access credentials on underground forums in exchange for a share of the profits\nfrom their ransomware attacks. Specifically, the user was in the market for credentials that could compromise organizations based in English[speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US.](https://cyware.com/research-and-analysis/lets-talk-about-black-basta-ransomware-an-in-depth-analysis-7a19)\n\n[Two days later, the American Dental Association (ADA) suffered a cyberattack that led it to shutter multiple systems. Data allegedly stolen from](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\nthe ADA was published on the Black Basta leak site only 96 hours after the attack.\n\nWhile it was previously assumed that the ransomware group used bought or stolen corporate network access credentials to infiltrate its victims’\nnetworks, our analysis of another set of samples monitored within a 72-hour time frame shows a possible correlation between the Qakbot\ntrojan and the Black Basta ransomware. Black Basta continued to evolve, and in June, a Linux build of the ransomware that encrypts VMware\nESXi virtual machines was discovered in the wild.\n\nInterestingly, the ransomware group does not appear to distribute its malware at random. That Black Basta’s operators have turned to\nunderground markets to acquire network access credentials and have hard-coded a unique ID in every Black Basta build betrays their mature\nunderstanding of how ransomware works as a business. While Black Basta may be a newly formed group, the individuals behind it are likely\nseasoned cybercriminals.\n\n## Top affected countries and industries according to Trend Micro data\n\nIn this section, we discuss Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ data on Black Basta’s activity from April 1 to July 31, 2022, which refers\nto detections of the ransomware’s attempts to compromise organizations.\n\nJust two countries accounted for over half of the group’s 44 ransomware attack attempts during this period, which were concentrated in the US\nat 43%, with Austria a distant second at 15%. As Black Basta has sought to purchase network access credentials for organizations located\nspecifically in the US, among other countries, this may explain the higher number of attacks against US-based businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The countries with the most Black Basta ransomware attack attempts in terms of infected machines from April 1 to July 31, 2022\n\n_Source: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™_\n\nAs of this writing, our detections show that Black Basta activity is spread across many different industries. The group has been observed\ntargeting businesses involved in technology, insurance, manufacturing, and utilities.\n\nAlthough Black Basta is a relatively new arrival to the ransomware scene, its detections have been on a steady climb since the ransomware\ngang surfaced in April, peaking at 22 attack attempts in June before tapering down to 11 the following month.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The numbers of detections of Black Basta ransomware attack attempts in terms of infected machines in each month from April 1 to\nJuly 31, 2022\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\n## Targeted regions and industries according to Black Basta’s leak site\n\nIn this section, we look into the attacks recorded on the Black Basta group’s leak site, which represent successfully compromised\norganizations that, as of this writing, have refused to pay ransom. Our detections, which pertain to Trend Micro customers, captured only a\nfraction of the victims found in Black Basta’s leak site. Trend Micro’s open-source intelligence (OSINT) research and investigation of the site\nshow that from April 1 to July 31, 2022, the group compromised a total of 80 organizations.\n\nThe bulk of Black Basta’ victims were based in North America, which had a victim count of 44, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific. More\nspecifically, the US was at the receiving end of most of the attacks, with 38 affected organizations. Many confirmed ransomware attacks also\ntook place in Germany, with 19 victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.

Construction businesses topped the list with a victim count of 10, while businesses\ninvolved in professional services came in second with nine victims. Medium-size organizations made up the lion’s share of recorded Black\nBasta victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5.

The distribution by organization size of Black Basta’s victim organizations from April 1 to July 31, 2022\n\n_Sources: Black Basta’s leak site and Trend Micro’s OSINT research_\n\n## Infection chain and techniques\n\nAs Black Basta’s operations are based on the RaaS model, its infection chain might vary depending on the target. The infection chain\nillustrated below details the variety of tactics and tools the group uses.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Black Basta’s infection chain\n\n**Initial access**\n\nExternal data reports that a user named “Black Basta” posted on underground forums seeking corporate network access credentials,\noffering a share of the profit from their attacks as payment. These reports are supported by the fact that a unique ID is hard-coded in\neach Black Basta build, which could also mean that the ransomware gang does not distribute its malware sporadically.\nOur internal telemetry shows another set of samples, which were monitored within a 72-hour time frame, that were using Qakbot. The\nmalware is downloaded and executed from a malicious Excel file and then executes certain PowerShell commands as part of its staging\nphase\n\n**Discovery**\n\nBlack Basta uses PowerShell scripts to scan information about the compromised system or network.\nIt uses Qakbot’s and Cobeacon’s information-gathering capabilities to scan the compromised system or network.\nIt uses third-party tools such as Netcat to scan the compromised system or network.\n\n**Defense evasion**\n\nBlack Basta uses a batch script containing PowerShell commands to disable antimalware applications.\nIt uses Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable Windows Defender and Security Center.\nIt reboots the victim’s computer in safe mode to circumvent any antimalware applications.\n\n**Privilege escalation**\n\n[Black Basta exploits the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) to perform privileged operations and deliver the Cobalt Strike](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527)\nbeacon (aka Cobeacon) or other payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Credential access**\n\nBlack Basta uses Mimikatz to dump credentials.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\nBlack Basta uses different tools and pieces of malware to spread its ransomware to other remote systems in the network:\n\nBITSAdmin\nPsExec\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\nRDP\nQakbot\nCobeacon\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nBlack Basta uses Cobeacon to exfiltrate the stolen data on an established command-and-control (C&C) server.\nIt uses Rclone to exfiltrate data from compromised systems.\n\n**Impact**\n\nBlack Basta uses the ChaCha20 algorithm to encrypt files. The ChaCha20 encryption key is then encrypted with a public RSA-4096 key\nthat is included in the executable.\nMultiple builds of Black Basta ransomware have been found in the wild\n\nOne build restarts the victim’s system in safe mode, most likely for evasion purposes, before performing encryption. This build also\nmodifies the “Fax” service to enable it to run in safe mode and with service-level access.\nAnother build contains only the ransomware’s core capabilities, such as wallpaper defacement, file encryption, and deletion of\nshadow copies.\nA newly found build has a new addition: the -bomb argument, which theoretically allows the ransomware to automatically target all\nconnected machines for encryption.\nThe Linux build of the ransomware targets the folder /vmfs/volumes, where images from virtual machines are contained, for\nencryption. To encrypt other folders, the ransomware actors include the -forcepath argument.\nBlack Basta displays a ransomware note as the victim’s wallpaper directing them to a .txt file with more details.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Other technical details**\n\nBlack Basta avoids encrypting files in these folders:\n\n_$Recycle.Bin_\n_Windows_\n_Local Settings_\n_Application Data_\n_boot_\nIt avoids encrypting files with these strings in their file names:\n\n_OUT.txt_\n_NTUSER.DAT_\n_readme.txt (the ransom note)_\n_dlaksjdoiwq.jpg (a desktop wallpaper found in the %TEMP% folder)_\n_fkdjsadasd.ico (an icon used for encrypted files, found in the %TEMP% folder)_\nIt drops a ransom note as a .txt file in an encrypted folder in the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 9.

It has also exhibited](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3669256/black-basta-new-ransomware-threat-aiming-for-the-big-league.html)\nsimilarities to the Black Matter ransomware gang, including a resemblance between their respective leak sites. Its possible connection to these\nransomware groups might explain the high level of in-house expertise behind Black Basta’s attacks.\n\nIn defending systems against threats like Black Basta, organizations can benefit from establishing security frameworks that can allocate\nresources systematically for establishing solid defenses against ransomware. Here are some best practices that can be included in these\nframeworks:\n\n**Audit and inventory**\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data.\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.\nMake an audit of event and incident logs.\n\n**Configure and monitor**\n\nManage hardware and software configurations.\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services.\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.\n\n**Patch and update**\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments.\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications.\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions.\n\n**Protect and recover**\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures.\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA).\n\n**Secure and defend**\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network.\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.\n\n\n-----\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions that can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior can also help protect enterprises:\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nearly on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to the system.\n[Trend Micro Cloud One™ – Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-workload-security.html)\nThis protection is made possible through techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning.\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques to effectively block](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/email-and-collaboration/email-inspector.html)\nmalicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry points for ransomware.\n[Trend Micro Apex One™ offers next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html)\nand ransomware, ensuring the protection of endpoints.\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n[The indicators of compromise (IOCs) for the threat discussed in this article can be found here.
