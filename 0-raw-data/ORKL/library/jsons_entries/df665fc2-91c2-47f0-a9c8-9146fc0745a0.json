The authors continue to follow the trend of arming the malware and\nfor the threat group to expand its operation. These newly added exploits target both old and\nnew vulnerabilities, adding as new ones target industrial control system devices from\nMitsubishi, Barracuda web app firewall, Citrix NetScaler application delivery controllers,\nvideo conferencing systems, and additional network and endpoint administration tools.\n\nEarlier this year, Palo Alto Networks 1 [reported a new variant from the Mirai malware family,](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/mirai-the-iot-bot-that-took-down-krebs-and-launched-a-tbps-attack-on-ovh-22422)\ndubbed \"Echobot\" after the dropped file name of the malware. Initial versions of the malware\nused 26 exploits to propagate itself. Later in August of 2019 it was reported2 to go over 50\nexploits. So at 71 we are seeing substantial growth in Echobot’s attack capability.\n\n\n## New Target: Factory Automation Systems\n\nAlthough the core malware functionality of this latest variant hasn't changed much since\ninception, the addition of a variety of new exploits puts new systems into its crosshairs.\n\nWhile most of the Mirai variants target IoT devices, such as home routers and IP cameras,\nthis version of Echobot adds an outstanding exploit for CVE-2019-14927, which targets\nMitsubishi Electric‘s Remote Terminal Unit (RTU).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Mitsubishi RTU is an industrial controller with remote access to communicate with\nSCADA systems in the oil and gas industry, power industry, and others. Industrial control\nsystems have seen an increase in attacks over the past years,4 including some chilling\nsuggestions of possible cyber-terrorism attacks .5 However, it is uncommon for generalpurpose botnets like Mirai to include exploits targeting a specific component such as the\nMitsubishi RTU. Figure 1 below shows the product web page for the Mitsubishi smartRTU.\nWhile industrial controller systems are essential components responsible for running critical\ninfrastructure, they were never designed to be Internet-connected and are therefore\nnotoriously known for security-related flaws. Echobot leverages that weakness, making it\nmore dangerous than before.\n\nFigure 1. Web page for the Mitsubishi smartRTU\n\n\nIn September 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued an alert,6 shown in\nFigure 2, to address Mitsubishi's RTU vulnerability. The alert followed a publication of a\nproof-of-concept exploit by a researcher known as @xerubus,7 who discovered and\nresponsibly reported this vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Department of Homeland Security vulnerability alert page\n\nIndustrial control systems are known to be very difficult to patch due to the risks involved\nwhile introducing configuration changes to critical infrastructure systems. This means there is\na larger vulnerability exposure window, compared to traditional IT systems, which provides\nattackers with a much larger opportunity to exploit new vulnerabilities.\n\n## Analysis of the Exploits\n\nIn the beginning, Echobot consisted of a very odd mix of exploits.8 Initial Mirai variants\ntargeted IoT devices, such as home routers, digital surveillance cameras, and cable\nmodems. Over time, the targets extended to smart devices and web servers. Echobot is a\nvery prominent variant in the Mirai landscape, adding to its prey: corporate network devices,\nnetwork and enterprise management systems, video conferencing, voice over IP, and Iris\nrecognition platforms (as shown in Figure 3). This new Echobot variant builds upon that with\nsimilar newer systems, while also adding another old exploit for the Barracuda firewall and\nfor the Citrix NetScaler application delivery controller.\n\nFigure 3. Iris ID, an Echobot target\n\n\n-----\n\nOften, Mirai variants add relatively current exploits to get better chances to recruit devices.\nHowever, this version leverages an exploit from 2003, targeting the online payment platform\nCCBill. At the same time, Echobot added four exploits to its arsenal from 2019, while the\nlatest one is from August 2019, targeting Webmin Linux/Unix administration panel (CVE2019-15107). This indicates the authors are looking to exploit both legacy and new systems\nthat have fallen through the cracks in a patch management program. The newly added\nexploits to Echobot are listed in Table 1 as well as in Figure 4:\n\n**Exploit Name** **CVE** **Targeted System**\n\n\nACTi ASOC 2200 Web Configurator RCE Unassigned\n(2011)\n\n\nVideo surveillance\n\n\nAVCON6 systems management platform OGNL Remote Command Execution\n\n\nUnassigned\n(2018)\n\n\nVideo conferencing\nsystem\n\n\nBarracuda Spam Firewall 3.3.x 'preview_email.cgi?file' Arbitrary File Access\n\n\nCVE-2006-4000 Firewall\n\n\nCCBILL CGI - 'ccbillx.c' 'whereami.cgi'\nRemote Code Execution\n\n\nUnassigned\n(2003)\n\n\nOnline payment\nplatform\n\n\nEnigma NMS 65.0.0 OS Command Injection CVE-201916072\n\n\nEnterprise Network\nManagement software\n\n\nNetGain Enterprise Manager Command\nInjection\n\n\nCVE-201716608\n\n\nIT infrastructure\nmonitoring\n\n\nCitrix/Netscaler SD-WAN 9.1.2.26.561201 Command Injection\n\n\nCVE-2017-6316 Application delivery\ncontroller\n\n\n3Com OfficeConnect - Code Execution Unassigned\n(2009)\n\n\nRouter\n\n\nRuby on Rails - Dynamic Render File Upload\n/ Remote Code Execution\n\n\nCVE-2016-0752 Web Application\n\n\nSar2HTML 3.2.1 - Remote Command\nExecution\n\n\nUnassigned\n(2019)\n\n\nLinux/Unix\nperformance\nmonitoring\n\n\nMitsubishi Electric smartRTU / INEA ME-RTU\n\n- Unauthenticated OS Command Injection\nBind Shell\n\n\nCVE-201914927\n\n\nRemote Terminal Unit\nbased monitoring and\ncontrol\n\n\nThomson Reuters Velocity Analytics Remote\nCode Injection\n\n\nCVE-2013-5912 Analytics platform\n\n\nWebmin RCE <=1.920 CVE-201915107\n\n\nLinux/Unix\nadministration system\n\n\n-----\n\nYachtcontrol Webapplication 1.0 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution\n\n\nCVE-201917270\n\n\nYachtcontrol\nWebservers\n\n\nTechnicolor TD5130v2 Technicolor TD5336 CVE-2019–\n18396 CVE2017–14127\n\nTable 1.

All of the exploits in the malware code\n\n## Attack Infrastructure\n\n\nRouter\n\n\nEchobot uses its arsenal to spread a dropper, which is a bash script named \"Richard,\"\ndetailed in Figure 5. The dropper instructs the system to download Echobot and compile and\nexecute it for no fewer than 13 different processor architectures. These hacked servers are\nthen used to host and spread more malware to new targets, adding more machines to the\nbotnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. The dropper Richard s payload, a bash script\n\nThe Echobot malware itself is hosted on a different server than previously reported. The\nmalware hosting server is now a hacked Unraid network attached storage (NAS) system that\nis completely exposed, allowing anyone to gain full admin access using a user-friendly GUI\nterminal.\n\nNot surprisingly, these servers were taken over by malicious actors, but it is unknown exactly\nhow the server was exploited. However, it appears that SSH and Telnet services are\nexposed without any password required. Also, Mirai is known for having credential bruteforce capabilities, so this is likely the attackers’ entry point.\n\nReviewing the files on that system, seen in Figure 6, it seems that the attackers just recently\n(12/10/2019) uploaded the new malware variant to the hacked server:\n\nFigure 6. New malware variant added to the hacked server\n\nThe other attacking Echobot IPs appear to be infected web servers mostly located in the\nU.S. and in Europe. Half of those servers are hosted on DreamHost. An example of an\ninfected web server is shown in Figure 7. The services running on the servers are not\nvectors in the malware's arsenal so they were most likely were brute-forced to gain control of\nthem.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. A typical example of an attacking server infected with Echobot\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMirai has been around for a few years now, and variants of the original malware have been\n[used all over the world to create botnets. F5 Labs recently wrote in its ongoing “Hunt for IoT”](https://www.f5.com/labs/search.Keywords_iot-security)\n[research series that devices are so easy to compromise, preteens are doing it. There is no](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/the-hunt-for-iot--so-easy-to-compromise--children-are-doing-it)\nsign that IoT botnets will disappear anytime soon, and we expect new variants to keep\nappearing. Echobot remains a threat, and the expanding scope of its exploits indicates it will\nnot be slowing down anytime soon. Echobot's shifting focus to factory automation is notable\nand may indicate a future direction for botnet-building threat actors.\n\nTo keep the threat at bay, enterprises should consider implementing a patch management\nsystem in order to mitigate the risk of vulnerable systems on their networks.\n\n**IOCs**\n\n**Attacking servers:**\n\n208.97.139[.]102\n208.113.204[.]109\n208.97.139[.]121\n68.5.101[.]90\n149.202.251[.]78\n208.97.139[.]112\n208.97.139[.]113\n59.151.12[.]249\n45.27.247[.]144\n208.113.204[.]147\n208.113.204[.]14\n68.94.227[.]128\n188.130.33[.]11\n\n\n-----\n\n208.97.137[.]152\n208.97.138[.]83\n\n**\"Richard\" (dropper):**\n\n145.249.106[.]241\n\n**Hashes:**\n\n145.249.106.241/richard\n0e87d4a97b64beb7fe27e0b21d73eb0da353467d99710566dda8b07f953798ef\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.arm\na96515f745f07be9a512a2d0502c59b5ee2ef8d14ff0adaab3558e97d616c017\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.arm4\nc93f08a29512132ba8ac44092613fe6a8e9e192c8155cbbd62b28823b718f7e7\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.arm5\n886d6c4b7d952830184c2bcb95242db006e5f2cbbbc7757516efd5c4c48eba16\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.arm6\n23ff9c0f3baab717c9753604235a1069c15a5fd9b2f1a626889d7e56186dbe48\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.arm7\ndb4a5bf82bffa1a5c4444facbdbf4f1c6938a7e0227c9740b3780c8659802cc0\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.i686\nef5fcc5391f580ed91745b0678ee4c605e65bde3fad5e434f89372445f9a5a64\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.m68k\n9d0dc6705ca42183ebe0fa766d453ee90d68e38b6d6cf5745cf550ea5f2b372c\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.mips\nc8992488a49544762eababe5cfbf5304b770c48cd5e8ae47aa71d3a013c114af\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.mpsl\n4ccb9683182b2c8512b12ffa1dbdf22dbad8e5cbc3bb9efb85fe3c6f2b19cba3\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.ppc\ne0f2273b695a0579bb528eaa0d389a01e9fe5e1c458aa784433d7e23b9f56e74\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.sh4\n6a58e30de7842d7c30398c24395ae02762b8b7e3598bb8d2915299ee6bee7b02\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.spc\n1f23ddd77881a8cc95587b91c91fcf71175efafafd9b5b08c12a7e81c18ff378\n145.249.106.241/ECHOBOT.x86\nf7568d22f7cb83f5587ced9eac15c850ea9f0a552252fe40c38369e9b17d21b7\n\n## Security Controls\n\n[Enterprises should consider implementing the following security controls based on their](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/education/what-are-security-controls)\nspecific circumstances:\n\n\n-----",
