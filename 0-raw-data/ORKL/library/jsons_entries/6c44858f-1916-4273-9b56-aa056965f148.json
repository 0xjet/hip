The use of NodeJS is not something commonly seen across\nmalware families.\n\nThe observed malware campaigns associated with Divergent feature the use of persistence\n[techniques most commonly associated with \"fileless\" malware, leaving behind few artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fileless_malware)\nfor researchers to look at. This malware can be leveraged by an attacker to target corporate\nnetworks and appears to be primarily designed to conduct click-fraud. It also features several\ncharacteristics that have been observed in other click-fraud malware, such as Kovter.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nTalos has identified a new moduler malware that is being used to facilitate the installation of\na previously undocumented malware family, which we are referring to as Divergent, due to\nthe naming convention used by the malware during variable declaration and the creation of\nenvironment variables. While we were unable to determine the delivery mechanism used, we\nwere able to perform analysis of the malware loader as well as the Divergent malware that it\nis used to install on victim systems. Divergent is a malware family designed to generate\nrevenue for attackers via the use of click-fraud, similar to other click-fraud malware such as\nKovter. Technical details associated with both the installation and operation of the Divergent\nmalware are described in the following sections.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe malware has many similarities with other popular fileless malware families, particularly\nKovter. Like Kovter, it relies heavily on the registry for staging and storage of configuration\ndata while avoiding more traditional on-access endpoint scanning of files on disk. It also uses\na key in the registry to maintain persistence, and relies on PowerShell to install itself on the\ninfected host.\n\nWhen first delivered and executed on a victim's machine, the malware is in the portable\nexecutable (PE) format. Its first task, however, is to install itself to the system in a less\nsuspicious form, namely as an HTML Application (HTA) that will load the malware from the\n\n\n-----\n\nregistry.\n\nInstallation begins by creating several registry keys containing the different parts of the\nloader as well as the data of the malware PE. The malware reads all the information\nembedded in its data section and creates three new randomly named registry keys, each\nholding a different stage of the loader code needed to execute the malware PE using\nreflective injection.\n\nNext, the HTA loader is written to the CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA folder (typically\nC:\\ProgramData\\) and set to execute each time the user logs on by adding an entry to the\n\"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" registry key.\n\nAn example of an HTA loader and the accompanying registry entries necessary to execute\nthe malware once installed are:\n\n17T21vYHOb.hta ::\ne4a49af295d6e61877a458a014fe63b733be942c506496b53070aa3d9ca421d8\nZfjrAilGdH.reg ::\n5863f35959aa542a27319e098f40166f3ace09d265f4ec6d739318c0b739745e\n\nThis registry file contains the following subkeys in the key HKLM\\Software\\ZfjrAilGdH which\nare set by the installation process (the key names are randomly generated and will be\ndifferent for each installation):\n\nLvt4wLGLMZ :: JScript executed by ZfjrAilGdh.hta\nkCu2DZ9WI0 :: PowerShell used to reflectively inject the malware\n4FLJBnefsN :: hex data representing the malware PE\n\n### Fileless malware loader\n\nThe HTA is heavily obfuscated but when cleaned up, evaluates to an eval of the JScript in\nthe registry key \"HKLM\\Software\\ZfjrAilGdh\\Lvt4wLGLMZ\" via a\n\"ActiveXObject.WScript.Shell.RegRead\" (shown here as pseudo code):\n\nThe JScript in the reg key executes the following powershell (shown here deobfuscated):\n\n\n-----\n\nThis code will execute the code found in the registry location\nHKLM\\Software\\ZfjrAilGdH\\kCu2DZ9WI0 after setting the variable regkeyname to the data\nfound in the registry location HKLM\\Software\\ZfjrAilGdH\\4FLJBnefsN. The registry key\n4FLJBnefsN contains the bytes of the malicious portable executable (PE) with a modified\nDOS header, namely the MZ has been replaced with null bytes.\n\nThe code from kCu2DZ9WI0 is a version of PowerShell Empire's reflective PE injection script\nthat will inject the malware:\n\nAt this point, the malware executes.\n\n### Divergent malware\n\nThere are two main parts of this threat: one to receive and execute commands from a C2\nserver and another to execute external component scripts. The configuration for each part is\nstored in the registry in JSON format.\n\nThe component configuration describes which components should be executed and how.\nThis example configuration will execute three different JScript components:\n\n\n-----\n\nEach entry is parsed, and each filename and args value is passed along for execution by the\nmalware. Detailed analysis of the call_03 (see Now I See You), all_socks_05 (see Click\nFraud), and block_av_01 (see Block AV Component) components can be found below.\n\nThe network configuration stores two classes of C2: \"accl\" is a list of URLs that the malware\nshould attempt to contact for system information delivery and for commands to execute,\nwhile \"acll\" is a list of URLs the malware should attempt to contact for possible updates to\neither configuration file. The default values from ZfjrAilGdH.reg are:\n\n\n-----\n\nNotice that \"version\" is an epoch timestamp, converting to Saturday, March 30, 2019 7:14:29\nPM GMT. The [earliest reference we found containing several IOCs from this malware sample](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/a7656ccba0946d25a4efd96f4f4576494d5f1e23e6ad2acc16d2e684656a2d4f?environmentId%3D100)\ndates back to February 2019.\n\nOnce executed, the malware begins with five anti-analysis checks. If any of these checks fail,\na beacon is sent to a static URL containing a direct IP and sleeps indefinitely:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe beacon message indicates which anti-analysis check failed to pass. The malware\nchecks for unwanted processes and loaded modules by hashing process file names and\nmodule names respectively, then comparing each hash against two separate pre-computed\nlists for each. The lists contain hashes for endpoint security software and hypervisor services\nas running the sample under both scenarios failed these checks. It also checks for a host\nCPU with at least two cores, the presence of a debugger, and finally compares system\nuptime intervals to determine if the sample is running within a sandbox or virtual machine.\n\nIf the process is running with the appropriate privileges, it uses WMI (Windows Management\nInstrumentation) to query recognized anti-virus software installed on the host. In particular,\nit's looking for the antivirus software Windows Defender. If found, it proceeds to disable\nvarious components of Windows Defender and Windows Updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Once completed, it attempts to bypass UAC using CMSTP, if needed. Additional code is](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1191/)\nexecuted to check for any updates to the malware's two configuration files. Empty POST\nrequests are sent to each of the URLs in the first configuration's accl key. These URLs are\nlater contacted with a comprehensive set of sensitive information from the host. Most are\nnon-responsive but still online. Many appear to be, or once were, compromised hosts used\nfor the C2 network.\n\nThe set of direct IP URLs found in the first configuration's acll key are contacted until one\nserver responds back with a configuration update. A response containing an RC4 encrypted\nupdate to the first of the malware's configurations in the Registry. In this sample, the RC4 key\n\"seiC4aimaish9zah8kah\" is static, and decryption results in a lengthier update for the first\nconfiguration:\n\nThe data is stored in the pre-existing registry subkey to update the value (in this example,\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\ZfjrAilGdH\\194956). As of Sept. 9, 2019, the version timestamp for the\nlatest config pulled was Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019 11:50:19 a.m.\n\nThe second configuration is stored in the last remaining value in the ZfjrAilGdH registry\nsubkey (HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\ZfjrAilGdH\\2177774). Default values mentioned near the\nbeginning of this section remained in use during runtime.\n\nThe primary flow of the malware code reaches an end but repeats select tasks every 90\nminutes. It continues to check for configuration updates, continues to send encrypted\nsensitive information from the infected host, and continues to process any C2 responses that\nmight contain additional commands to execute. The following commands and parameters\nare supported by the C2 protocol used by Divergent:\n\nkillall: Terminate all processes initiated by the malware, delete corresponding files\nkill: Find process of specified component, terminate process, and delete the file\nstop: Find process of specified component, terminate process\nresume: Given pre-existing component, execute file\nmodules: From the same response data, pull additional configuration data from the\nfollowing keys:\n\nname\nfilename\nargs\nversion\ntype\n\n\n-----\n\ndownload\nKey\n\nUsing this data, the malware sends additional requests to download each specified file. The\nfiles are written to disk and executed.\n\nupdate: From the same response data, pull additional configuration data from the\nfollowing keys:\n\nfilename\ndownload\nKey\n\nSame as the modules command, the malware sends additional requests to download each\nspecified file. Each file is written to disk and executed. Finally, the task deletes the Registry\ndata stored in its subkey (handles both HKCU and HKLM).\n\nThe command update_interval modifies the main thread's sleep counter for the ending loop\n(the default time is 90 minutes).\n\n## Components\n\n### Block AV component\n\nThe block_av_01 component attempts to block anti-virus software from receiving updates by\nblocking all outbound TCP connections on port 80 and port 443. With older revisions of this\nmalware package, this functionality was delivered via a JScript file named bav01.js but in\nnewer versions, this has been seen delivered by PowerShell in the fake PNG trpl.png (see\nFake PNG PowerShell Delivery).\n\nThis installation script starts by creating a new folder (e.g. SystemConfigInfo000) to hold the\nfiles necessary for execution. The two files to be installed are WinDivert.dll and either\nWinDivert32.sys or WinDivert64.sys, depending on the host CPU architecture. These are the\nlegitimate WinDivert binaries and are used by the malware to create its packet filter.\n\nThe WinDivert binaries are embedded in bav01.js as comments and written to disk with .b64\nextensions. The following is the code to retrieve the embedded resource named arch5 from\nthe script, embedded in a comment block in the format /*[<resource name>[resource data]]*/:\n\n\n-----\n\nEach WinDivert binary is then decoded from base64 using the Windows Certificate Services\nutility certutil.exe. For example:\n\nThis script is set to execute as a task each time the computer starts. This is accomplished by\ncreating a scheduled task with a random-looking service name that is set to run as the\nSYSTEM user at the highest run level:\n\nNext, the following PowerShell command is executed (shown here decoded) to execute the\nbase64 encoded PowerShell commands in the environment variable 'nttyuuyt':\n\nThe 'nttyuuyt' environment variable was set by bav01.js previously and contains a base64\nencoded PE and the PowerShell commands necessary to reflectively inject this executable\n(truncated for readability):\n\nAt this point in the script, installation is complete and the PE-based module to block anti-virus\nHTTP/HTTPS connections is loaded.\n\nTo achieve its anti-virus blocking, the reflectively loaded PE periodically checks the names of\nall running processes against a predefined list. If any process names appear in the list, the\n[PIDs are added to the filter string passed to WinDivertOpen which will block all traffic to that](https://www.reqrypt.org/windivert-doc.html#divert_open)\nprocess on remote ports 80 or 443. An example filter string is:\n\n((processId=620 or processId=736) and (remotePort==80 or remotePort==443))\n\n\n-----\n\nExample process names that would be blocked include msmpeng.exe (Windows Defender)\nand svchost.exe.\n\n### Click Fraud\n\nThe all_socks component is a NodeJS-based Socket.IO client that is commanded to\nnavigate to arbitrary web pages by the attacker ostensibly for monetization and click fraud\npurposes. With older revisions of this malware package this functionality was delivered via a\nJScript file named either 04sall.js or 05sall.js, but in newer versions this has been seen\ndelivered by PowerShell in the fake PNG strpk.png (see Fake PNG PowerShell Delivery).\n\nLike the anti-virus blocking component, the click fraud component makes use of the\nWinDivert library and therefore installs the necessary WinDivert DLL and driver in the same\nmanner as bav01.js, described above. Additionally, the NodeJS executable and a NodeJS\nSocket.IO client named app.js are part of the installation process for this component. Older\nversions of this component also installed two executables, divergent.exe and\nmdivergent.exe, however in later versions, these are executed from memory via reflective PE\ninjection.\n\nThe malicious NodeJS application, seen either as app.js or init.js, is a simple Socket.IO client\nthat takes a base64 encoded IP address as its only parameter.\n\nnode.exe app.js <base64 encoded IP>\n\nIn all samples we have encountered, the IP address has been 176.9.117.194 (encoded as\nMTc2LjkuMTE3LjE5NA==). Upon execution, the malicious NodeJS app will make a request\nto the IP passed as a parameter:\n\nThe response from this server is the address of the next server which the application will\nconnect to. This new connection uses Socket.IO web sockets to maintain continuous\ncommunication between the victim and the server so the server can periodically send\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands. The commands sent from this second server contain the host address of an\nadvertisement revenue service and the entire HTTP request that should be made to that\nserver, effectively faking a click on an advertisement link.\n\nTo protect themselves from these kinds of fraudulent requests, advertisement monetization\nservices may go to extra lengths to confirm the device making the request is the type of\ndevice it claims to be. For example, if the monetization service only expects mobile devices,\nit may reject requests that have the characteristics of desktop devices. We believe the\ndivergent.exe and mdivergent.exe executables are used by the 04sall.js/05sall.js\n[components to circumvent these kinds of checks (see TCP/IP stack fingerprinting).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_stack_fingerprinting)\n\nThe divergent and mdivergent PEs make use of the WinDivert library to intercept and rewrite\nthe first SYN packet of the 3-way TCP handshake for all outgoing connections the infected\nhost attempts to make. The changes made to the SYN packets depend on which executable\nwas used, either divergent.exe or mdivergent.exe; divergent.exe will rewrite the TCP header\noptions to follow the same format as Android devices while mdivergent.exe will rewrite the\nTCP header options to follow the format as iOS devices. Which version of the divergent\nexecutable is used is dependent on the app.js deployment script (either 04sall.js or 05sall.js).\nThese scripts contain code that decides which version should be used depending on a\nvariable named macchance which can be passed to the deployment script as its only\nparameter. This variable contains the probability that mdivergent.exe will be deployed\ninstead of divergent.exe (the PowerShell parameter, normally base64 encoded, is shown\nhere in its decoded form):\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the code shown above, the variables and and mac correspond to the code necessary to\nreflectively inject divergent.exe and mdivergent.exe respectively, i.e. and represents Android\nand mac represents iOS.\n\nFor either of these divergent executables to work properly, several changes to the TCP/IP\nstack on the infected machine must be made; these include setting the TTL to 64, turning on\nthe timestamp TCP header options, and changing the MTU to 1440. Once those changes\nhave been made, the system is forced to reboot with a false message of\nCritical_Windows_Update:\n\nWith these changes made, the divergent executables can perform the necessary\nmodifications to each SYN packet so that they follow the standards of the device the host\nshould be disguised as.\n\nDuring our analysis of systems actively infected with Divergent, we observed several web\nrequests initiated by the malware attempting to interact with various online advertisements\nand advertising platforms, indicative of the previously described click-fraud process\nperformed by the malware. Similar to what was observed related to the modification of the\nTCP configuration, the User-Agent field was modified to make the web requests appear as if\nthey had originated from a mobile device. Web requests were made to various online\nadvertising services and were similar to the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also observed additional web requests similar to the following, which included a standard\ndesktop User-Agent:\n\nAdditionally, the malware attempts to interact with “in-app” advertising platforms such as\nMobfox.\n\n### Now I See You\n\nThe component named call_03 by the malware's configuration file, which is delivered by the\nem_02.js and em_03.js scripts, appears to be a means of installing a remote assist tool on\nthe infected machine that would allow the attacker to view and possibly control the victim's\ncomputer.\n\nLike the previous components, the PE associated with em_03.js is executed via reflective PE\ninjection, this time with the environment variable fdghjgfdhj.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PE to be injected is a DLL which, according to its export table, was originally called\nnow_i_see_you.dll. This DLL has a single exported function named VoidFunc which contains\nall of its functionality. When VoidFunc is executed, it makes an HTTP GET request to the\nhxxps://uoibppop[.]tk/. It then takes the response from this server and treats it as a new URL\nto navigate to. Using COM objects, the DLL launches an instance of Internet Explorer,\nresizes the window to fit the entire screen and navigates to the URL in the response. At the\ntime of analysis, the server was active but did not respond with any data so we were unable\nto confirm what was being hosted there.\n\nAdditionally, the DLL hides the Windows taskbar so the user is more compelled to comply\nwith any instructions on the page that is presented to them. Next, the malware enters a loop\nlooking for a process containing the string gotoassist (older versions also looked for\nteamviewer), ostensibly for confirming that the user followed the instructions in Internet\nExplorer by downloading and running the attacker's malware. Once this process is running,\nthe Windows Taskbar is restored to view. A process list is gathered and sent to the URL\nhxxps://uoibppop[.]tk/clean; no response is expected from the server. The registry key\n`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\fbsjbdfhsv` is created and the key value `weqr` is set to\n1, indicating that execution was successful, then the process exits. Instead of a URL, the\nattacker has the option to send the word stop to the victim which will cause the DLL to\nforcefully reboot the infected machine.\n\nWhile we do not know what URL the victim is intended to navigate to and therefore which\nprogram they are to be tricked into running, based on the process names gotoassist and\nteamviewer and the original DLL name of now_i_see_you.dll, it is likely that the victim is\nintended to install one of these remote administration software.\n\n### Fake PNG PowerShell delivery\n\nNewer versions of the Divergent malware package no longer deliver and execute\ncomponents as JScript, instead multi-stage PowerShell scripts are used. The first stage will\nretrieve the second stage from a static URL. The first-stage PowerShell is heavily\nobfuscated:\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is our deobfuscated version:\n\nWhile the requested resource features the extension normally associated with PNG images,\n[it is actually malicious Powershell that has been encrypted using RC4 with the encryption](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2014/06/an-introduction-to-recognizing-and.html)\nkey \"raimeey2nu,\" which was stored in the previous PowerShell (the particular\n[implementation of RC4 used can be found here).](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/4edc5bf4cccb0aef5553a860a3e433e3)\n\nWe have encountered following URLs to retrieve the encrypted PowerShell:\n\nhxxp://1292172017[.]rsc.cdn77[.]org/images/trpl.png\nhxxp://1292172017[.]rsc.cdn77[.]org//imtrack/strkp.png\n\nThe first URL delivers the PowerShell version of bav01.js and the second delivers the\nPowerShell version of 05sall.js.\n\nTaking a deeper look at the PowerShell version of 05sall.js, we see Base64 encoded blobs\n[corresponding to binaries associated with WinDivert. Like its JScript counterpart, the](https://github.com/basil00/Divert)\nPowershell decodes these blobs and saves them to the filesystem location defined by the\n\n\n-----\n\nenvironment variable %ALLUSERSPROFILE%.\n\nShellcode stored within the PowerShell is loaded into a new memory region using the\nWindows API function VirtualAlloc and then executed to continue the infection process:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe malware loader described is currently under active development. Talos has observed\nmultiple versions of the loader being used to install the Divergent malware. Attackers are\nattempting to monetize these infections through the use of click fraud. The threat landscape\nis constantly evolving as attackers test new techniques and methodologies to maximize their\nrevenue generation capabilities.
