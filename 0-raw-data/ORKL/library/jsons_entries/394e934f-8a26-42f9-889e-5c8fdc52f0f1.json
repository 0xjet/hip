Going by the prices per installation the primary\ntarget of the group is the US.\n\n14 Jul 2011 - 11:07AM\n\nAlthough the “Ready to Ride” group originated in Russia it distributes Win32/Cycbot outside\nthe borders of the Russian Federation. Going by the prices per installation the primary\ntarget of the group is the US.\n\nMy Russian colleagues Aleksandr Matrosov and Eugene Rodionov report that recently a\ncybercrime group called “Ready to Ride” has attracted their attention, by distributing\nmalware of the Win32/Cycbot family. This group started in the fall last year, judging from the\ndomain name registration date – readytoride.su was registered on 8th September 2010.\n\nIts primary activities were substitution (index hijacking) of search engine results (Google,\nBing, Yahoo) and clickjacking (hijacking the user's mouse-clicks and routing them invisibly\nto another page).\n\n(We've written previously about Win32/Glupteba\n[(https://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/03/02/tdl4-and-glubteba-piggyback-piggybugs), which](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/03/02/tdl4-and-glubteba-piggyback-piggybugs)\nwas another example of malware used to drive BlackHat SEO (Search Engine\nOptimization).)\n\nAlthough the “Ready to Ride” group originated in Russia it distributes Win32/Cycbot outside\nthe borders of the Russian Federation. Going by the price per installation (see Figure 1) the\nprimary target of the group is the US.\n\n**Figure 1**\n\nWin32/Cybot is distributed using a well-known PPI (Pay Per Install) scheme. To download\nthe malicious executable each partner uses the URL it has paid for, which generally looks\nlike this:\n\nhxxp://1231.readytoride.su/adv.php?login=[partner_name]&key=[partner_key]&subacc=\n\n[partner_id]\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the bot has been successfully activated\nit submits its current status to the C&C\n(Command and Control) server from which it\ngets its instructions\n(SEND_INSTALL_REPORT_TM):\n\nid=[bot_id]&hwid=[hardware_id]&step=\n\n[status]&wd=[win_ver]&av=[av_name]\n\nWhile collecting information about the infected\nsystem it determines what antivirus software\n(if any) is being used by looking for a\ncorresponding process name. Here is the list\nof AV software which is captured by the\nmalware:\n\n\n**Figure 2**\n\nThe C&C URLs are hardcoded into the Win32/Cycbot\nexecutable and are updated when a new version of\nWin32/Cycbot is downloaded:\n\n**Figure 3**\n\nThe bot is able to:\n\ndownload executables\ncreate new processes or new threads in an existing process\nterminate processes and threads\n\n\n-----\n\ncheck bot status in case one of the components was shut down\nclick on the references on a web page\ninject JavaScript into web pages, substituting references and modify html\ndelete executables and downloaded files when instructed by the C&C server.\n\nBy means of injecting java script, diverting web searches, and modifying HTML code it is\nable to pass itself off as a user surfing web pages, so as to counteract systems intended to\nblock clickjacking.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the bot modifies the settings of the most popular browsers\n(Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox). For instance, it modifies the file prefs.js used by the\nFirefox web browser to contain browser settings and preferences. It adds information about\nwhich proxy server to use. Similarly, it sets up a proxy using the HTTP protocol (127.0.0.1:\n\n[port_number]) for other browsers.\n\n**Figure 4**\n\nThe bot’s central component dispatches tasks received from the C&C server to other\ncomponents:\n\n**Figure 5**\n\nWin32/Cycbot is a multithreaded application and just a single instance of the bot can handle\ndozens of tasks, clicking advertisements or poisoning web searches. Here is an example of\nthe bot’s network activity, captured over several minutes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6**\n\n**David Harley, Senior Research Fellow**\n**Aleksandr Matrosov, Senior Malware Researcher**\n**Eugene Rodionov, Malware Researcher**\n\n14 Jul 2011 - 11:07AM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
