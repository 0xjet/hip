The group started the new round of attacks at a time when\nmost companies, offices, organizations, etc. were either closed or half-closed during\nChristmas holidays and, as a result, their technical support and IT departments were not able\nto immediately review, identify, and neutralize these cyber incidents. Charming Kitten has\ntaken full advantage of this timing to execute its new campaign to maximum effect.\n\nA review of samples of this phishing campaign shows that the attackers concentrated their\nattacks on individuals’ online accounts, especially personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo! and\nOutlook) and business emails (organization and university emails). After accessing the\ncredential details of the accounts, they steal sensitive data from their victims.\n\nAdditionally, based on the collected evidence, it is clear that Charming Kitten specifically\nchose their targets from members of think tanks, political research centers, university\nprofessors, journalists, and environmental activists in the countries around the Persian Gulf,\nEurope, and the US. Our observations show this phishing campaign is a continuation of\nother Charming Kitten campaigns that were started in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.\n\n## Details Of The Attacks\n\nOur examination of the acquired samples shows hackers generally use two main methods of\n“Sending Fake SMS” and “Sending Fake Emails” to execute their attacks. It is also important\nto note that whilst using these two methods, the attackers try not to leave any trace of\nthemselves and, even after gaining access to their victims’ accounts, they do not block the\nvictims’ access to their own accounts.\n\n## Method #1: Fake SMS\n\n\n-----\n\nLike many other phishing attacks, in this phishing campaign, Charming Kitten uses a fake\nSMS (Figure 1) to trick their victims. They send confirmation messages stating ‘Google\nAccount Recovery’ to their targets; they claim these messages are sent by Google and the\nuser must follow the link in the SMS to confirm the identity.\n\nFigure 1. A sample of the fake SMS\nFigure 1. A sample of the fake SMS\n\nThe most important point in this method is the structure of the link in the SMS that seems\nlegitimate: hxxps://www.google[.]com/url?q=https://script.google.com/xxxx.\n\nAt first glance, these links generally cause less suspicion for the targets. After opening the\nlinks and several redirections, the victims are led to final phishing domains such as\n“mobile[.]recover-session-service[.]site” etc. More detail about this technique is available in\nthe Redirect Chain section.\n\n## Method #2: Fake Email\n\nAnother method used in this phishing campaign is sending fake emails with deceptive titles\nlike “Merry Christmas, and sending note/book/photo and others”, which are usually sent by\npreviously hacked emails.\n\nFigure 2 shows one of these phishing emails where the attackers cordially invite the target to\nopen the link in the email’s body. In order to achieve this, Charming Kitten used the subject\n“New Years Greetings” with convincing sentences such as “This year I decided to make my\nfriends happy with my last book. Here’s my special Xmas gift for you.” in the body of email.\nBy comparing Figure 2 to Figure 1, it is clear that the structure of the link is similar to the\nlinks used in the fake SMS.\n\nFigure 2. A sample of the fake email\nFigure 2. A sample of the fake email\n\nWe believe that Charming Kitten continuously try different styles of email to trap their victims\nas quickly as possible. For example, Figure 3 shows another fake email that was sent to the\nsame victim a day after the initial email (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 3. A sample of fake email after sending the initial email to the target\nFigure 3. A sample of fake email after sending the initial email to the target\n\n## Redirect Chain\n\nUtilizing and weaponizing legal and credible services to hide destructive intent is one of the\ntechniques used by hackers in some phishing campaigns.\n\nThis technique has become significant in the recent campaign by Charming Kitten. Our latest\ninvestigations show that this Iranian hacking group has focused on this method over the past\ntwo years For example Charming Kitten weaponized “site google com”1 in 2019 and\n\n\n-----\n\nscript.google.com in this campaign.\n\nOur examination shows the hackers have used a mix of services such as ‘script.google.com’\nand ‘iplogger.org’ in this campaign in order to create a chain of redirection to obfusticate their\nhacking operations. Redirection links initially help bypass the security layers in email\nservices, and then provide the attackers more control to redirect the target to the final URL.\n\nFigure 4 shows an experimental example of the function of each link in the redirect chain\ntechnique.\n\nFigure 4. Experimental example for redirect chain\nFigure 4. Experimental example for redirect chain\n\n## Infinite different types of phishing attacks\n\nOur investigation shows Charming Kitten has targeted different people and organisations in\nrelatively different fields. For example, based on our initial findings, the hackers use domain\nnames such as mail-newyorker[.]com, news12[.]com[.]recover-session-service[.]site with the\nintention of targeting “The New Yorker” online magazine readers and “News 12 Networks” TV\nchannel staff and their audience.\n\nCharming Kitten had previously used the same method using names such as Wall Street\nJournal,1 CNN,2 Deutsche Welle,3 etc.\n\nFigure 5.

It was fantastic and I enjoyed it. Photos and contents were very\ninteresting. Congratulations! We actually traveled to this area with my friends a couple\nof years ago and took some good pictures at this location and found some interesting\nthings that I didn’t see in your article. I think you’ll understand if you see my pictures\nand contents. I’ll share it for you here.\n\nIn reviewing other samples, we have found that Charming Kitten has used many fake\ndomains to target different online accounts in different services. Although accounts such as\nGmail, Yahoo! and Outlook are the main targets of this campaign, there are more samples\nthat show this Iranian hacking group targets other services such as Planet.com and\nPlanetObserver.com - both are online satellite imagery services for special sectors such as\ngovernments, industries, and military defenses - which shows the breadth of their campaign.\nFigures 6 to 8 are different series of phishing pages that were developed by Charming Kitten.\n\nFigure 6.

A fake website of PlanetObserver.com6\n\n## Infrastructure and History\n\nWe have reviewed and matched five common indicators to assess and analyze the\ninfrastructure that has been used by Charming Kitten (Figure 9). This infrastructure has been\nused mostly in the third and fourth quarters of 2020:\n\nReverse IP/DNS lookup and matching the history with other common indicators\nCommon IP or IP CIDR range match\nUse of unconventional TLD (i.e. .site) and using WHOIS protection\nUse of deceptive words such as session, confirm, recovery, verification, service, etc., in\nthe name of the URLs as well as subdomains\nParallel use of Dynamic DNS, such as ddns.net, in a short period of time, which has a\ntemporal matching with other indicators\n\nReviewing these indicators side by side show that Charming Kitten has been constantly\nactive in recent months and has executed other attacks at the time of writing this report.\n\nIn reviewing related activity patterns of Charming Kitten and information about the\ninfrastructure used by this hacking group, we believe the extent and scale of this campaign is\nsignificant in comparison with previous activity of Charming Kitten.\n\nOverview of the infrastructure of Charming Kitten’s phishing campaign in the second half of\n2020\nFigure 9. Overview of the infrastructure of Charming Kitten’s phishing campaign in the second half of\n20207\n\n## Conclusion And Recommendations\n\nThis investigation only relates to one aspect of the Iran-backed hacker group’s activities in\nrecent months; the extent and magnitude of this campaign was unforeseeable. We can\nconclude that Charming Kitten has used complex techniques to gain access to individuals\nand organizations that Iranian intelligence services are interested in targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to protect yourself against these attacks, we strongly recommend using secure and\nsafe authentication methods such as two factor authentication with security keys, such\nYubiKey,8 for your online accounts.\n\nAs usual, we firmly suggest not to click on unknown links, to carefully review any URLs\nbefore entering credential information, and not to download and run unknown files on mobile,\npersonal or work computers. These measures can significantly protect people who are the\ntargets of these types of campaigns.\n\nIt is important to note that the main cases mentioned in this report relate to the latest\nCharming Kitten’s phishing campaign and that this campaign has significantly intensified in\nrecent days.\n\n##
