According to its website, Hacking Team develops and sells ”easy-to_use offensive technology to the worldwide law enforcement and intelligence communities”._\nThe leaked data contain a variety of information, from business proposals to the source\ncode of the software sold by the company.\n\nIn particular, there are two particularly interesting development projects in the leaked data:\n\n[1. A Flash exploit targeting the vulnerability labeled CVE-2015-5119. This vulnerability](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5119)\n\n[was patched on Wednesday the 8 of July in Adobe security bulletin APSB15-16, andth](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html)\nthe exploit was therefore a zero-day up till then. It allows an attacker to execute\narbitrary code remotely, if the attacker can convince the potential victim to open a\nspecially crafted Flash file. Strikingly, the exploit works against all major browsers and\ncan also be deployed easily in Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel,\nPowerPoint).Hacking Team’s leaked data contain various tools for easy manipulation\nof the Flash exploit, and therefore it does not come as a surprise that various exploit\n[kits integrated it very rapidly, as reported by the security researcher Kafeine. A](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2015/07/hackingteam-flash-0d-cve-2015-xxxx-and.html)\n[Metasploit module is also now available.](http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/browser/adobe_flash_hacking_team_uaf)\n\n1. A Windows local privilege escalation exploit, which is still unpatched and to which no\n\nCVE number has yet been allocated. This exploit allows an attacker to execute a\nprogram with maximum privileges.\n\nHence, the Hacking Team leak provides a complete exploitation chain, starting from a Flash\nexploit for the compromise, to a Windows escalation privilege exploit allowing the payload\nexecution with elevated privileges.\n\nThis week ESET spotted a malicious team that rushed to integrate Hacking Team exploits\ninto its arsenal: the Sednit group. This group, also known as APT28 or Fancy Bear, has\nbeen targeting various institutions since 2006 for espionage purposes. To do so, they\n[develop their own software, including such tools as specialized spying software and](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/11/sednit-espionage-group-attacking-air-gapped-networks/) exploit\nkits.\n\n\nOn Wednesday the 8 of July 2015 the Sednit group started to use the Hacking Team Flashth\nexploit in their exploit kit. Targets were then exposed to the following exploitation chain (see\nour [blog post for more details on the exploit kit):](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/08/sednit-espionage-group-now-using-custom-exploit-kit/)\n\n1. The target receives a spear-phishing email containing an URL pointing to a domain\n\nname mimicking a legitimate domain name. In this particular case, we observed the\ndomain “osce-press.org” being used, which mimics “osce.org/press”.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. If the target opens the URL, the browser hits a landing page with JavaScript code,\n\nwhich collects detailed information on the computer.\n\n1. If the computer matches certain criteria set by the Sednit operators (language,\n\ntimezone…), the server then serves an exploit to the target. Since Wednesday, a\nFlash exploit is delivered under the name “flash_video_x86.swf”. The decompiled\ncode of the exploit is almost the same as the Hacking Team exploit – more precisely,\nthe version dubbed “scratch_ie_ff_bytearray” in the leaked data.The only difference\nbetween the two exploits appears to be that the Sednit version receives the shellcode\nto execute in an input parameter in a manner similar to Metasploit exploits, whereas in\nthe Hacking Team version the shellcode is hardcoded in the Flash file. The following\nFigures show the Main function in the two cases.\n\nFigure 1 – Hacking Team Flash exploit main function\n\nFigure 2 – Sednit Flash exploit main function\n\n1. If the Flash exploitation works, the victim receives a first-stage backdoor – malware\n\nwhose purpose is to make sure the victim is the intended target. This malware\ncontains Hacking Team’s Windows escalation privilege exploit. Given the presence of\nsyntactic differences, it appears the Sednit group recompiled the source code of the\nexploit, but without modifying its logic.\n\nIf the privilege escalation exploit works, the malware then sets its persistence on the\nmachine through a scheduled task running with the highest privileges.\n\nThis story shows that advanced groups of attackers also employ opportunistic strategies. It\ntook only a few days for the Sednit group to re-use the Hacking Team exploitation chain for\ntheir own purpose. The Webky group – another APT team – was also reported to have\n[done the same this week. We strongly encourage users to upgrade their Flash software.](http://www.volexity.com/blog/?p=158)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicator** **Value**\n\nExploit kit domain name osce-press.org\n\nSednit Flash exploit SHA1 D43FD6579AB8B9C40524CC8E4B7BD05BE6674F6C\n\n\nSednit first-stage backdoor\nSHA1\n\nPayload persistence script\nname\n\n\n51B0E3CD6360D50424BF776B3CD673DD45FD0F97\n\nfvecer.bat\n\n\nPayload file name api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll\n\nPayload SHA1 B8B3F53CA2CD64BD101CB59C6553F6289A72D9BB\n\n10 Jul 2015 - 01:52PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
