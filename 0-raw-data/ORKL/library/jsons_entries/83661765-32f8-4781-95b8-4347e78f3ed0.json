The computing\n\ninfrastructure in a typical Enterprise is more vulnerable to attack than ever before. Current security solutions are\n\nproving ineffective at stopping cyber espionage.

The true threat is the human being who is operating the malware.\n\nThis human and the organization represented is the true threat that is targeting information for the purposes of\n\nfi nancial gain, theft of state secrets, and theft of intellectual property.

This malware operation has been**\n**associated with intellectual property theft including source code and technical diagrams (CAD, oil exploration bid-data, etc).**\n**Companies hit have been publically speculated, including Google, Adobe, Yahoo, Symantec, Juniper Networks, Rackspace,**\n**Northrop Grumman, and Dow Chemical. The malware package used with Aurora is mature and been in development since at**\n**least 2006.**\n\n**The Aurora operation is characterized by a remotely operated backdoor program that persists on a Windows computer. This**\n**backdoor program has several capabilities that are outlined below.**\n\n\nEvidence collected around the malware operation suggest\nthat Operation Aurora is simply an example of highly effective\nmalware penetration. There is not signifi cant evidence to\nattribute the operation directly to the Chinese Government.\nHowever, key actors have been identifi ed in association\nwith malware operations that utilize Chinese systems and\nnative language malware. This has lead to a great deal of\nspeculation about Chinese-State involvement. It must be\nnoted that a large and thriving underground economy exists\nto both build and disseminate malware worldwide, and that\nmost of this malware is capable of intellectual property\ntheft. The malicious hacking underculture is strong in China,\nas in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, and clearly enmeshed\ninto a global criminal economy of data theft. While diffi cult\nto conclude that these activities receive any form of state\nsponsorship or direction, the malware operation remains a\nfunded and signifi cant risk to intellectual property in the\nenterprise.\n\n|ASPECT|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|\n|Operators|Operators of the malware appear to use certain domains for C&C control. Dynamic DNS is a key feature of the operation, with many known C&C servers operating from domains registered through Peng Yong’s 3322.org service.|\n|Intent|The primary intent is the theft of intellectual property.|\n|Coms|Communication is encrypted over HTTP, port 443, obfuscated with a weak encryption scheme. The C&C servers tend to operate from domains hosted on dynamic DNS.|\n\n\n**ATTRIBUTION**\n\nAt this time, there is very little available in terms of\nattribution. A CRC algorithm tends to indicate the malware\npackage is of Chinese origin, and many attacks are sourced\nout of a service called 3322.org — a small company operating\nout of Changzhou. The owner is Peng Yong, a Mandarin speaker\nwho may have some programming background with such\nalgorithms. His dynamic DNS service hosts over 1 million\ndomain names. Over the last year, HBGary has analyzed\nthousands of distinct malware samples that communicate with\n3322.org. While Peng Yong is clearly tolerant of cyber crime\noperating through his domain services, this does not indicate\nhe has any direct involvement with Aurora.\n\n**TOOLMARK** **DESCRIPTION**\n\nEmbedded Resource Language Code United States\n\nEmbedded systems/\nCRC Algorithm Table of Constants\nChinese publication[iii]\n\nDNS registration services Peng Yong others\n\n|ASPECT|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|\n|Target|The operation is targeting intellectual property with no specif ic industry focus. This is an example of “not knowing what they are looking for until they f ind it”.|\n|Origin|It is highly probable that the malware was developed in native Chinese language, and the operation control system is designed for Chinese users, indicating the entire operation is Chinese. This does not, however, mean the Chinese Government is using the system.|\n\n\n**Developers**\n\n\nForensic tool-marks in the CRC algorithm can be\ntraced to Chinese origin. That, combined with domain\nregistration information, leads to at least one potential\nactor, Peng Yong[ii]. The malware has been in development\nsince at least 2006.

When using a Digital DNA™ capable\nplatform such as McAfee ePO, you can search the Enterprise\nfor the following Digital DNA sequence (recommend a tight\nmatch, 90% or higher).\n\n**DIGITAL DNA SEQUENCE FOR AURORA MALWARE**\n\n01 B4 EE 00 AE DA 00 8C 16 00 89 22 00 46 73 00 C6 49 00 0B AE 01 E7 9F\n04 05 81 01 0E DF 01 79 D8 00 25 6A 00 15 49 00 47 22 00 4B 67 0F 2D CC\n01 29 67 01 35 99\n\nTo thwart command and control and prevent data loss,\nknown C&C domains should be blocked at the egress fi rewall.\nThe domains listed in the Detect section represent a\nsignifi cant set of those currently known to be operating. IDS\nsignatures similar to the one illustrated in the Detect section\nshould be used to detect inbound exploit attempts, and\nmachines accepting this data should be scanned for potential\ninfections. Many A/V products now contain signatures for the\nAurora exploit and will be effective in detection and removal.\nHowever, the attackers that represent the threat will not be\ndeterred, and variants of the attack are nearly assured.\n\n\nHBGary has prepared an inoculation shot for this malware.\nThe inoculation shot is a small, signed binary that will allow\nyou to scan for, and optionally remove, this malware from\nyour Enterprise network. The aurora innoculation shot can be\ndownloaded from www.hbgary.com.\n\nWhen the aurora innoculation shot is executed it will query\nthe user for authentication credentials. Optionally the user\ncan just hit “cancel” to use the currently logged on USER’s\nauthentication token. Some sample usages are listed below.\n\n**To scan a single machine:**\nAuroraInnoculation.exe -scan 192.168.0.1\nAuroraInnoculation.exe -scan MYBOXNAME\n\n**To scan multiple machines:**\nAuroraInnoculation.exe -range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254\n\n**To automatically attempt a clean operation:**\nAuroraInnoculation.exe -range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.254 -clean\n\n**To scan a list of machines in a .txt fi le:**\nAuroraInnoculation.exe -list targets.txt\n\n**DETECTION OF AURORA THREATS WITH DIGITAL DNA FOR EPO**\n\nCustomers of McAfee ePolicy Orchastrator, integrated\nwith Digital DNA, can detect emerging advanced persistent\nthreats. To detect Aurora, users should perform a Digital\nDNA Sequence search with the above mentioned sequence\nfor Aurora, and set a fuzzy match of 90% or greater. Once\nmachines are detected, the user is encouraged to use the\nfreely available inoculation shot to remove the infection.\n\n|FACTORS|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|\n|C&C protocol|If a variant is developed, it will very likely use the same C&C protocol, but may change the header of the packet and the constants used for connection setup. This will evade IDS / Firewall rules designed to detect the current scheme. It is unlikely the attackers will change the encryption setup, however.|\n|Installation and Deployment|The method used to install the service is highly effective. Although the f ilenames will likely change, the actual method will likely remain.|\n\n\n-----\n\n## MORE INFORMATION\n**ABOUT HBGARY, INC**\n\nHBGary, Inc is the leading provider of solutions to detect,\ndiagnose and respond to advance malware threats in a\nthorough and forensically sound manner.
