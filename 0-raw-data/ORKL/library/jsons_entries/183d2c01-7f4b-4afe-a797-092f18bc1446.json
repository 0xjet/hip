The Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS)**\n**offering was posted by a cyber threat actor called “Ma1n” on various Russian**\n**hack forums, to a primarily Russian customer base.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This threat actor appears to lean heavily on Cobalt Strike for part of its**\n**infrastructure (for more information about Cobalt Strike please download our**\n**[recent book on the subject). With the data gathered from the BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/forms/enterprise/ebook-beacons-in-the-dark)**\n**Research & Intelligence Team’s Cobalt Strike Team Server scanning solution,**\n**we were able to cluster a variety of different malware families they’ve used,**\n**based on Beacon configuration data.**\n\n**[Malware researcher for NVISO Labs Didier Stevens also recently found six SSL](https://blog.didierstevens.com/)**\n**private keys bundled with cracked or leaked copies of Cobalt Strike, one of**\n**which has an extensive overlap with Prometheus-related activity. He has**\n**published** **[information and tooling that makes it possible to decrypt this Beacon](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/10/21/cobalt-strike-using-known-private-keys-to-decrypt-traffic-part-1/)**\n**traffic.**\n\n### Introduction\n\nPrometheus, a supreme trickster, stole fire for humankind by lighting a torch from the sun.\nWhat would this tale look like if it were updated, with the god of fire reimagined as a\ncybercriminal?\n\nIn our gritty reboot of this classic tale, instead of a rebel bringing the light of knowledge to\nhumanity, the main character is the “puppetmaster” of a monstrous cephalopod that has its\ntentacles wending its way around a huge territory. The torch is now a Beacon (of the\ncracked/leaked Cobalt Strike variety). In our revamped plot line, there is hope at the bottom\nof Pandora’s box in the form of passionate researchers working diligently to identify and\nthwart these cyber-thieves.\n\n### Prometheus: The God of Fire (and TDSes?!)\n\n[In August of 2021, Group-IB published research on Prometheus TDS. They shone light on](https://blog.group-ib.com/prometheus-tds)\ntwo large email campaigns targeting U.S. entities in the public and private sector, as well as\nindividuals in Belgium.\n\nPrometheus at its core is a Traffic Direction System (TDS) used to facilitate Malware-as-a[Service (MaaS) operations and phishing redirection on a large scale. As its name suggests,](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/11/the-art-of-targeted-phishing-how-not-to-get-hooked)\na TDS is a system designed to (re)direct users from one web location to another, based on\nthe configuration set by its operator. The TDS helps to deliver malware binaries to targets\nvia a complex web of phishing, maldocs and HTTP redirection. The BlackBerry Research &\nIntelligence Team has also discovered an interesting correlation between Prometheus and\n[the use of a leaked Cobalt Strike SSL key pair, which we will elaborate in more detail later.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/11/all-your-beacon-are-belong-to-us-new-blackberry-book-cracks-code-of-cobalt-strike-threat-actors)\n\nPrometheus can be considered a full-bodied service/platform that allows threat groups to\npurvey their malware or phishing operations with ease. Think of Prometheus like a freight\ntransport infrastructure; except instead of carrying food or petrochemicals, it carries a range\n\n\n-----\n\nof cyber offensive capabilities and malware to its targets. The irony of this analogy is that\nservices like Prometheus enable bad actors to target companies that provide actual\ninfrastructure – such as freight transport and other critical services – in the physical world.\n\nIn order to accomplish its goals, the platform has many moving parts, from malicious PHP\nbackdoors to JavaScript redirects, to malspam and Cobalt Strike infrastructure, as well as\ncustomer-facing administration web panels. Prometheus sells access to the TDS via\nunderground forums on a subscription basis, with its prices ranging from $30 for two days to\n$250 for a month.\n\n### Catching Fire: The Prometheus TDS – Traffic Direction System\n\nHistorically, a TDS would be considered an integral part of an exploit kit’s execution chain;\nthey would be used to redirect an unwitting user to a \"landing page\" where their computer\nwould be fingerprinted and served with an exploit where possible. But the exploit kit (EK)\n[landscape has been on the decline](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rig-exploit-kit-usage-declines-as-browsers-are-getting-harder-to-hack/) [in recent years thanks to a concerted effort by law](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rig-exploit-kit-usage-declines-as-browsers-are-getting-harder-to-hack/)\nenforcement, browser hardening by developers, and declines in the use of Internet Explorer\n(IE) and Flash.\n\nConsequently, TDSes have evolved into their own independent entities that are largely part\nof [Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS) offerings, which a threat actor offers for either rent or](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/drive-service-blacktds)\nsale in specialized forums located on the dark web. Past examples of this are the EITest\nTDS that exclusively targeted IE users, [BlackTDS, which offered services for as little as](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/drive-service-blacktds)\n$16/day, and [Seamless TDS.](https://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2017/cpai-2017-0525.html/)\n\n_Figure 1 - BlackTDS forum advertisement_\n\n[TDS traffic is typically funneled from one of two main sources; malicious ads (malvertising)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tds-systems-are-the-next-big-money-makers-in-the-land-of-cybercrime/)\non legitimate websites, or on compromised legitimate websites that contain malicious code.\nOnce a victim is caught in this web of redirects, they are at the mercy of the TDS and will be\n\n\n-----\n\nredirected to a location that serves malware, phishing scams, exploit kits or tech support\nscams.\n\nThe Prometheus TDS follows the typical TDS execution flow, but targets are funneled via a\nspam email that contains either an HTML file, a Google Docs page or a web shell redirector.\nThese components each contain an embedded URL designed to redirect the user to a first\nstage payload, or to a website that has been compromised by the threat actor and hosts a\nPHP-based backdoor. The backdoor is used to glean various types of data from the victim,\nwhich gets sent back to the Prometheus TDS administrative panel. The admin panel could\nthen choose to send instructions back to the compromised website/PHP backdoor, to serve\nthe victim with malware, or redirect them to another page that might contain a phishing\nscam, etc.\n\n### PHP Backdoor\n\nThe Prometheus backdoor was previously an integral component in the execution chain of\nthe Prometheus TDS and played the role of a middleman, acting as a gateway between the\nattacker and the unwitting victim. However, its use has been minimal since earlier this year.\nIt is a miniscule (12-16KB) PHP script that operates as an HTTP redirector, and it is often\nfound on compromised websites running vulnerable PHPMailer software.\n\nA victim is typically redirected – after clicking a malicious link that is delivered to them\nthrough a [spam email – to a website infected with the backdoor. The backdoor’s primary](https://blog.group-ib.com/prometheus-tds)\npurpose is to fingerprint victims, scrape various pieces of data from their machine, and then\nsend the stolen data to the Prometheus TDS administration panel.\n\n_Figure 2 – Prometheus TDS admin panel_\n\nThe admin panel can then choose to send an additional instruction to the backdoor, such as\nto redirect the victim to another specified URL and/or deliver a malicious first stage payload.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAn examination of the backdoor code reveals a configuration file containing a series of\nhardcoded settings for communication between the backdoor and the command-and-control\n(C2) server (also running the admin panel).\n\n\n-----\n\nCommunication between both parties is encrypted via XOR, a cipher key is contained within\nthe configuration settings.\n\nAlso included is the C2 admin panel address – in this case “hxxp://109[.]248[.]203[.]114” –\nand the installation path along with a test path location.\n\n_Figure 3 - Configuration settings_\n\nAdditional settings include the presence of (“allow_url_fopen”, “1”). This is a PHP feature\nthat, when enabled, allows data/files to be retrieved from remote locations\nover HTTP or FTP.\n\n_Figure 4 - Setting enablement_\n\nOnce a victim lands on an infected site, various pieces of information are retrieved from\ntheir browser, including their IP, geolocation, time-zone, user-agent, language, protocol\nused, and the location they were referred from.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 - User data scraping code_\n\nA request is then generated to send the newly acquired data to the attacker’s admin\npanel/C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 - C2 exfil_\n\nThe server might then send a response containing additional instructions depending on the\n“$modeType” chosen. Instructions include specifying a URL to redirect the victim to, or\nwhether to send further files/malware to them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 - Modetype options_\n\n### The Threat Actor “Ma1n” and Sales on the Dark Web\n\nIn this gritty reimagining of the Prometheus tale, there is a threat actor directing this\nmalicious traffic. “Main” (aka Ma1n) is considered to be the author behind the Prometheus\nTDS, amongst other illicit cyber-offerings. His focus has evolved over the years, selling\nvarious kits like PowerMTA and offering services in form of \"high quality redirects\". This\nwork and knowledge led him creating Prometheus TDS.\n\nHe has used various Russian hack forums to advertise his wares throughout 2019 and\n2020, often featuring package deals to encourage customers to make larger purchases or\nto make setup more convenient. Ma1n even includes a way for potential buyers to contact\nhim via the messaging platforms Jabber, Reserve or Telegram.\n\nMa1n’s favored forum avatar – a red fox – is the same fox that was featured in The Prodigy\n[song titled “Nasty.”](https://youtu.be/xB_nKpEkILs)\n\n_Figure 8 – Ma1n's favored avatar: the red fox_\n\nMa1n first registered on a hacking forum on October 15, 2018. The last activity on this site\nwas on July 3, 2019. Ma1n posted twice and had zero reactions to any other posts,\nindicating that this account meant strictly business.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 - Ma1n's activity on the forum_\n\n**May 2019**\n\nOn May 3, 2019, Ma1n wrote his first post on this forum. He was looking to purchase a\n“Recaptcha 2” solution via Zennoposter, sending via Callback.\n\n_Figure 10 - Ma1n's activity and post_\n\n**June 2019**\n\nOn June 22, 2019, Ma1n posted again.

The post_\nlists Prometheus’s capabilities, such as web shell validation, creation and functionality\ncheck of redirects, traffic distribution system, and more. The price of Prometheus starts at\n$30 per two-day usage period and then goes up to $250 for a month’s usage.\n\nThe full translated version of this post can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 - English translation of Prometheus advertisement_\n\nAt the end of the post, Ma1n included his contact information for Jabber, Reserve and\nTelegram accounts:\n\nJabber: ma1n[at]exploit[.]im\nReserve: ma1n[at]thesecure[.]biz\nTelegram: [at]Ma1n_exp\n\n### Stealing Fire\n\nWhile Prometheus employs several bespoke offensive solutions to bring their wares to the\nmasses, they also appear to lean heavily on the adversary simulation and threat emulation\nsoftware known as Cobalt Strike Beacon. With the data gathered from our Cobalt Strike\nTeam Server scanning solution (as detailed extensively in our book “Finding Beacons in the\n_Dark: A Guide to Cyber Threat Intelligence”), we began to cluster based on specific Beacon_\nconfiguration data. We then visualized this into what we call “constellations.”\n\nWhen we looked at the visualized representation of the SSL public keys, we saw one\nspecific constellation that dwarfed every other, comprising over 16% of our dataset at one\npoint in time.\n\nThe MD5 hash of this public key is e9ae865f5ce035176457188409f6020a.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17 – Over 4000 IPs clustered with the SSL public key_\n\nSuch a large cluster couldn’t help but draw the eye; we wondered what could be\nresponsible for such a large representation in our dataset. Was it one singular threat actor\nwith a huge array of infrastructure? Doubtful. Was each Beacon being distributed by a\nbotnet? Maybe. Was it a cracked copy being distributed on the dark web? Now we’re on to\nsomething.\n\n[Didier Stevens (of the InfoSec hall-of-fame), recently published that he found six SSL](https://www.sans.org/profiles/didier-stevens/)\nprivate keys in the wild that were used as part of malicious Cobalt Strike installations. One\nprivate key in particular was the respective counterpart to our\ne9ae865f5ce035176457188409f6020apublic key: it was bundled within a cracked version of\nCobalt Strike 4.2. When investigating known intrusions between Team Servers and\nBeacons relating to this SSL key, we noticed extensive overlap with Prometheus-related\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis cracked version (and the SSL key) appears to be so heavily relied upon by\nPrometheus affiliates that we speculate that this same illegitimate copy of Cobalt Strike\ncould perhaps be proliferated by the Prometheus operators themselves. We also found that\nby using clustering mechanisms such as the PROC_INJ_STUB value (which tracks the\nCobalt Strike Team Server JAR) we can infer that the SSL key was migrated between\nversion 4.2 to 4.4. This suggests that an entity had a desire to maintain access to Beacons\nacross multiple versions.\n\nWhile we cannot say for certain, it’s possible that someone connected with the Prometheus\nTDS is maintaining this cracked copy and providing it upon purchase. It is also possible that\nthis cracked installation may be provided as part of a standard playbook or a virtual\nmachine (VM) installation.\n\n_Figure 18 – Breakdown of Cobalt Strike versions using the leaked SSL public key_\n\nIn subsequent blog posts regarding the SSL private keys, Stevens showed how you can\n[decrypt the network traffic between the Beacon and its respective Team Server if one of](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2021/10/21/public-private-cobalt-strike-keys/)\nthese keys is in use. Any Cobalt Strike beacon found to be using any of the corresponding\npublic keys – in this case the Prometheus TDS – can have its network traffic decrypted.\nThis can help quite significantly in understanding the extent of a related breach, and to\nenable further investigation into those responsible.\n\nWhile we can’t directly tie this cracked version of Cobalt Strike to the Prometheus TDS, we\ncan however show the number of threat actors who have been observed using this specific\ncopy over the last two years. The number of groups that have used this installation who are\nbelieved to be of Russian origin is particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe diagram in Figure 20 below displays a timeline of the various families and types of\nmalwares that have been seen in conjunction with Cobalt Strike using this SSL key pair,\nfrom early 2020 to present.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19 - Malware observed using the cracked Cobalt Strike SSL key pair_\n\nIn one of our previous publications, we saw the same SSL key being used by Zebra2104,\nan initial access broker whose services were used by groups such as Strong Pity,\n[MountLocker and Phobos. For more on this, see our recent blog on the group.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/11/zebra2104)\n\n### Pandora’s Box\n\nWhile the previous figure shows the different malware associated with the leaked SSL\npublic key, it does not imply that all of these threats have any direct association with\nPrometheus.\n\nHowever, after careful research into overlaps between the leaked key and malware\ndeployed via Prometheus TDS, we have concluded that the following campaigns are likely\nto have recently utilized Cobalt Strike AND Prometheus.\n\n### DarkCrystal RAT\n\nDarkCrystal RAT (or DCRAT for short) is a lightweight commercial Russian Remote Access\nTrojan (RAT) that was first seen in in the wild in 2018. It is one of the cheaper commercial\nmalwares of its kind available on the Russian market, with recent prices ranging from 500\nRub ($6/€6) for two months to [4200 Rub ($57/€50) for a lifetime license.](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=4200&From=RUB&To=EUR)\n\nThis RAT employs a client-server architecture, with the client written in C# and the server\nwritten in JPHP. DCRAT is regularly updated with new features and plugins. Someone using\nthe handle [at]DarkCrystalRAT maintains a news page on Telegram that provides regular\nupdates as to the continuous development of the RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20 - DarkCrystal RAT news channel_\n\nOnce installed on a victim machine, DCRAT provides an attacker with a wide array of\nfunctionality, including keylogging, webcam and microphone manipulation, plus file and\nfolder manipulation. It also provides a large list of plugins that add further feature\nenhancements, such as browser password scraping, anti-VM capabilities, crypto-stealing,\nnotifications sent to the threat actor via Telegram, and privilege escalation.\n\n### FickerStealer\n\n\n-----\n\n[FickerStealer is an advanced Rust-based information-stealing malware.

This includes information such as](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/fickerstealer-a-new-rust-player-in-the-market)\ncredit card data, and user login credentials, as well as browser and cryptocurrency wallet\ninformation. It gathers this information by targeting a host of commonly used applications\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as Chrome, FireFox, WinSCP, FileZilla and Discord. FickerStealer can also manipulate\nfiles and folders on the compromised machine, and it can download additional files or\nmalware if instructed to do so by an attacker.\n\n### Cerber\n\n[Cerber ransomware first appeared on the threat landscape in 2016, being offered for sale in](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2016/09/cylanceprotect-vs-cerber-ransomware)\nRussian forums using a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. It was initially distributed\nvia exploit kit or spam emails and weaponized document attachments.\n\nAn attacker can fully customize the threat via an embedded configuration file.\n\nUpon execution, Cerber first geolocates the infected machine in order to compare the\nlocation with a list of exempted countries. This list is mostly comprised of eastern European\nand ex-Soviet states.\n\nThis threat then creates a copy of itself in %Appdata%. After this, it creates persistence via\nthe Registry, deletes shadow copies, and begins the encryption process employing RSA\nencryption. Upon completion of encryption, a ransom note is dropped to all affected folders,\nand the machine’s wallpaper is set to relay the same information contained in the ransom\nnote.

This practice is\ncolloquially known as \"big game hunting.\"\n\nUpon detonation, Ryuk first tries to kill a comprehensive list of processes and 150-plus\nservices to make the next stage of its infection run as smoothly as possible. File encryption\nis performed using the RSA-4096 cipher, and a ransom note is dropped to each affected\ndirectory.\n\nRyuk contains the ability to encrypt files remotely, and it can also perform Wake-on-LAN\n(WoL) functionality. This feature enables attackers to wake up networked devices that are\noffline, so that they can be targeted for encryption.\n\n### BlackMatter\n\n[BlackMatter ransomware was first spotted in the wild in July 2021. It is being offered as a](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/09/threat-thursday-blackmatter-ransomware-as-a-service)\nRaaS on dark web forums. There has been some speculation that BlackMatter was a\nsuccessor to [DarkSide ransomware. However, in an](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/05/threat-thursday-delving-into-the-darkside) interview with one of the\nrepresentatives from the ransomware group, the representative said that while they have\npreviously worked together with some of the members from DarkSide, they are no longer\ndoing so.\n\nIn May 2021, BlackMatter was looking for initial access brokers (IABs) to provide initial\naccess. BlackMatter was very specific about what kind of targets the threat group was\nlooking for: the target had to be a large, English-speaking company with annual revenue of\n$100-plus million.\n\n[BlackMatter also had an exemption list defining which types of industries and organization it](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/09/threat-thursday-blackmatter-ransomware-as-a-service)\nhad excluded from attack. These included hospitals, critical infrastructure facilities (such as\nnuclear power plants, power plants, and water treatment plants), companies in the oil and\ngas industries, and those in the defense, non-profit and government sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, on Nov. 1, 2021, [BlackMatter posted on their page (which is currently offline) that](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1455750066560544769)\nthey have decided to close their operations due to pressure from the authorities. They\nstated that each affected organization would receive a decryption tool.\n\nDuring their time of operation, BlackMatter targeted both Linux® and Windows® operating\nsystems.\n\nFile encryption was achieved using Salsa20 and RSA-1024 encryption algorithms. Only the\nfirst megabyte of the file was encrypted, to speed up the encryption process on the victim's\nmachine.\n\n### Qakbot\n\n[Qakbot is a mature malware family that dates back as far as 2007. Constant development](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2017/05/threat-spotlight-the-return-of-qakbot-malware)\nand support for the malware has seen it stand the test of time, and it is still one of the most\nprominent botnets today. Qakbot has several affiliates who disseminate the malware via a\ncombination of malspam and malicious Microsoft® Office documents, not to mention via the\nPrometheus TDS.\n\nDuring its lengthy tenure, Qakbot has become quite a formidable foe. It includes a large\namount of anti-VM and anti-sandbox functionality on both the client and server-side. This is\ndone to hinder analysis efforts by researchers. Thus, Qakbot has been able to stay\ncompetitive with security solutions by combining its anti-analysis functionality with a high\ndegree of modularity in the form of credential harvesting modules, worm modules, and\nwebhooks, among others.\n\nIf that wasn’t bad enough, Qakbot has been known to drop other malware binaries on victim\nmachines. These include several ransomware families used primarily for financial gain, as\nwell as binaries from other infamous botnets to help to increase their victim-base.\n\n### And More!\n\n[As highlighted in the aforementioned Group-IB report, other threat groups including MAN1,](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2017/03/threat-spotlight-dissecting-the-man1-groups-macro)\n[FIN7 and](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/04/blackberry-eliminates-carbanak-and-fin7-in-mitre-engenuity-attack-evaluations) [IcedID have also been distributed by Prometheus. We further explore the](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/02/blackberry-cylance-vs-icedid-banking-trojan)\ncorrelations between these groups in our recent book, “Finding Beacons in the Dark: A\n_Guide to Cyber Threat Intelligence.”_\n\n### Insights\n\nSearching across our customers' data for signs of Prometheus/Cobalt Strike-related activity\nreveals some interesting trends. The list of inbound TCP ports shows evidence of port\nscanning, with threat actors performing reconnaissance of Internet-facing infrastructure. In\nall likelihood, they are doing so in search of one of the greatest Achilles’ heels for\norganizations - remotely exploitable services.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe top inbound port, 3389, highlights threat actors propensity to leverage remote desktop\nprotocol (RDP) with credentials after establishing a foothold. Several Prometheus-related\nTeam Servers were found to be operating as RDP jump stations.\n\n_Figure 23 – Top inbound TCP ports_\n\nOutbound TCP connections are largely as expected: Beacon traffic on standard web ports.\nOne slight anomaly is outbound traffic on ports 80 and 443 from various Apache Tomcat\nservers to a couple of related IPs:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24 – Outbound traffic_\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to recover process dumps from these systems, so we can\nonly speculate as to whether this activity is indicative of a Tomcat vulnerability being\nleveraged to load Beacon payloads, or the operation of a web shell.\n\nFinally, across all campaigns using the leaked build of Team Server, there seems to be a\ntendency to target organizations within the public sector:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25 – Targeted verticals_\n\n### Stuck in the Middle With You\n\nIn an interesting twist of fate, as we were preparing this blog, Didier Stevens of NVISO Labs\nreleased a multi-part blog series where he talks about decrypting Cobalt Strike traffic using\nknown private keys. For us, there was a big revelation when we realized that Stevens had\nfound the corresponding private key to the public key we had been using to cluster\n“Prometheus”-related threat groups and malspam campaigns.\n\nFor analysts and investigators, this means that for all the threat groups listed in this blog (as\nwell as many more, as this is the most prominent public/private key pair, after all), it is now\npossible to decrypt the Beacon C2 traffic by using Stevens' processes and tooling. We\n[encourage any incident responders dealing with recent Conti/Ryuk/BlackMatter/Cerber](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/05/threat-thursday-conti-ransoms-over-400-organizations-worldwide)\nincidents who are in possession of Cobalt Strike PCAPs to give it a try.\n\n[What is more, Stevens also released a subsequent tool enabling the user to man-in-the-](https://github.com/DidierStevens/AdHoc/blob/master/cs-mitm.py)\nmiddle (MITM) live Beacon communications that use one of the known private keys,\nincluding injecting your own commands.\n\nThere’s hope at the bottom of the box!\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats,\nproviding intelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
