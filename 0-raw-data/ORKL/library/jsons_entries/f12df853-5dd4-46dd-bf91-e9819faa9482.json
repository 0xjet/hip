Skilled adversaries\ncompromising high-profile victims and stealthily exfiltrating valuable data over the course of\nmany years. Such teams sometimes count tens or even hundreds of people, going through\nterabytes or even petabytes of exfiltrated data.\n\nAlthough there has been an increasing focus on attribution and pinpointing the sources of\nthese attacks, not much is known about a new emerging trend: the smaller hit-and-run gangs\nthat are going after the supply chain and compromising targets with surgical precision.\n\nSince 2011 we have been tracking a series of attacks that we link to a threat actor called\n‘Icefog’. We believe this is a relatively small group of attackers that are going after the supply\nchain — targeting government institutions, military contractors, maritime and ship-building\ngroups, telecom operators, satellite operators, industrial and high technology companies and\nmass media, mainly in South Korea and Japan. This Icefog campaigns rely on custom-made\ncyber-espionage tools for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X. The attackers directly\ncontrol the infected machines during the attacks; in addition to Icefog, we noticed them using\nother malicious tools and backdoors for lateral movement and data exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\nKey findings on the Icefog attacks:\n\nThe attackers rely on spear-phishing and exploits for known vulnerabilities (eg.\nCVE-2012-0158, CVE-2012-1856, CVE-2013-0422 and CVE-2012-1723). The lure\ndocuments used in the attacks are specific to the target’s interest; for instance, an\nattack against a media company in Japan used the following lure:\n\n_Lure document shown to the victim upon successful execution of the exploit_\n\nBased on the profiles of known targets, the attackers appear to have an interest in the\nfollowing sectors: military, shipbuilding and maritime operations, research\n**companies, telecomoperators satellite operators mass media and television**\n\n\n-----\n\nResearch indicates the attackers were interested in targeting defense industry\ncontractors such asLig Nex1 and Selectron Industrial Company, ship-building\ncompanies such as DSME Tech, Hanjin Heavy Industries or telecom operators such\nas Korea Telecom.\nThe attackers are hijacking sensitive documents and company plans, e-mail account\ncredentials, and passwords to access various resources inside and outside the victim’s\nnetwork.\nDuring the operation, the attackers are using the “Icefog” backdoor set (also known as\n“Fucobha”). Kaspersky Lab identified versions of Icefog for both Microsoft\n**Windows and Mac OS X.**\nWhile in most other APT campaigns, victims remain infected for months or even years\nand attackers are continuously exfiltrating data, Icefog operators are processing\nvictims swiftly and in a surgical manner — locating and copying only specific,\ntargeted information. Once the desired information is obtained, they abandon the\ninfection and move on.\nIn most cases, the Icefog operators appear to already know very well what they need\nfrom the victims. They look for specific file names, which are identified and\ntransferred to the C&C.\n\nKaspersky Lab would like to thank KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency) and INTERPOL\nfor their support in this investigation.\n\nWe’re sharing Indicators of Compromise based on the OpenIOC framework for Icefog. This\nway organizations have an alternative way of checking their network for presence of (active)\nIcefog infections.\n\n[You can download the IOC file (.zip) here.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20133741/ioc_icefog.zip)\n\nA [detailed FAQ on Icefog is available.](https://securelist.com/the-icefog-apt-frequently-asked-questions/57892/)\n\nYou can read our full Icefog report here:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Click to download]\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Exploit Kits](https://securelist.com/tag/exploit-kits/)\n[Icefog](https://securelist.com/tag/icefog/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Social engineering](https://securelist.com/tag/social-engineering/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Zero-day vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nThe Icefog APT: A Tale of Cloak and Three Daggers\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.
