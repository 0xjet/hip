The\nRansomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving\nransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants.\n\nThis latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the DarkyLock, Gwisin, vvyu, Kriptor,\nand Cuba ransomware families.\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n\n**Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption**\n\n**Severity level: High**\n\n## DarkyLock ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkyLock is a Babuk variant that appears to be new for 2022. Should this variant execute\non a victim’s system, files will be encrypted and changed to have a “.darky” file extension.\n\nFigure 1. Files encrypted by DarkyLock ransomware.\n\nLocations where files are encrypted will also have a ransom note deposited in them named\n“Restore-My-Files.txt”.\n\nFigure 2. DarkyLock ransom note.\n\nThe ransom note demands 0.005BTC (approximately $120.00USD) to decrypt the files on an\naffected system. At the time of writing, there have been no transactions observed using the\nBitcoin wallet mentioned in the ransom note.\n\nAn interesting string appears in the DarkyLock executable that references LockBit 3.0, also\nknown as Lockbit Black ransomware.\n\nFigure 3. Interesting string contained within the DarkyLock executable.\n\nIt’s currently unknown why the reference to LockBit 3.0 is includes “colorful” language.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known DarkyLock\nransomware variants by the following signatures:\n\nW32/FilecoderProt.F183!tr.ransom\nW32/CoinMiner.NBH!tr\n\n## Gwisin ransomware\n\nGwisin is ransomware variant that was reportedly used to target companies in South Korea.\nIt encrypts files on compromised machines and adds a file extension named after the target\ncompany to the affected files.\n\nIn order to become infected, an MSI (Windows installer) file is delivered to the target\nmachine. Contained within that is a Windows DLL file that requires a specific set of criteria to\nbe met via the installer package to execute, making it difficult to detect in an environment. It\nis likely that the circumstances for installation are unique to each victim organization.\n\nFigure 4. Some of the variables that need to be satisfied by the MSI installer.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\n\n-----\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known Gwisin\nransomware variants by the following signature:\n\nW32/PossibleThreat\n\n## vvyu ransomware\n\nvvyu is a variant of the STOP/DJVU ransomware family designed to encrypt files on a\nvictim’s machine. Should the ransomware be successful in running, a ransom note will be\ndeposited in every location where files are encrypted.\n\nFigure 5. vvyu ransom note\n\nIt demands a price of $980USD to have software provided to decrypt the affected files on the\nsystem, although a discount is promised for payment within the first 72 hours. Support e-mail\naddresses and a unique ID are also provided for contact with the operators. Files encrypted\nby vvyu will have a “.vvyu” file extension appended to them.\n\nFigure 6. Files encrypted by vvyu ransomware.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet Customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known vvyu\nransomware variants by the following signature:\n\nW32/Stealer.3389!tr\n\n## Kriptor ransomware\n\nAt first glance, the ransom note and screen from Kriptor appear very similar to those of the\ninfamous WannaCry ransom attack from 2017. There’s even a reference to it,\n“Wannacry@Kozisis,” in a WannaCry-like ransom screen. Unlike Wannacry, however, there\nis no mechanism for self-propagation to spread to other machines.\n\nAs with Wannacry and other ransomware families, Kriptor will encrypt files of interest on a\nvictim machine and demand a ransom of $300USD worth of Bitcoin (0.012BTC) to be sent to\na wallet controlled by the malware authors. At the time of this writing, there have been no\ntransactions observed using the Bitcoin wallet mentioned in the ransom note.\n\nFigure 7. Kriptor ransom note.\n\nFiles will be encrypted and appended with a “.Kriptor” file extension. A running clock will\ncount down from 72 hours, after which point the malware authors threaten to double the\nransom and/or prevent decryption permanently from that point onwards.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Files encrypted by Kriptor ransomware.\n\nFigure 9. File properties for Kriptor ransomware show further callbacks to WannaCry.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known Kriptor\nransomware variants by the following signature:\n\nW32/Filecoder.OAE!tr.ransom\n\n## Cuba ransomware\n\nThe Cuba ransomware family has been observed since 2019. They use the now ubiquitous\n“double extortion” method of threatening to release a victim’s data on the Internet if they do\nnot pay the requested ransom.\n\nFigure 10. Cuba ransomware TOR site.\n\nOnce the ransomware has executed, a ransom note will be deposited in any directory where\nfiles have been encrypted. The ransom note will be named “!! READ ME !!.txt” and contain a\nunique ID to contact the ransomware controllers to pay. The primary contact channel is Tox\n(a peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol) with a backup e-mail address if a victim cannot\nmake contact. Files encrypted by Cuba will have a “.cuba” file extension appended.\n\nFigure 11. The ransom note for Cuba ransomware.\n\nFigure 12. Files encrypted by Cuba ransomware.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected against known Cuba\nransomware variants by the following signatures:\n\nW32/Filecoder.OAE!tr.ransom\nW32/GenKryptik.EMOA!tr\nW32/Kryptik.HGXH!tr\nW32/Filecoder.OAE!tr.ransom\nW32/Injector.EQGY!tr\nJS/Agent.5646!tr\nW32/GenKryptik.FSCS!tr\n\n## Best practices include not paying a ransom\n\n\n-----\n\n[Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\npaying a ransom, partly because payment does not guarantee files will be recovered.\nRansom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,\nencourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that\ncould potentially be illegal, according to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign\n[Assets Control (OFAC) advisory. The FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page, where victims](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\ncan submit samples of ransomware activity via the Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).\n\n_[Learn more about Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?tab=security-bundles&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=security-bundles)_\n\n\n-----",
