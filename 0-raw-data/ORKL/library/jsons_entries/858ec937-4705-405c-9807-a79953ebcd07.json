As such, it shows unusual effort by its authors to evade detection and emulation, and\nprogress towards a modular architecture.\n\nWe have seen Grandoreiro being distributed solely through spam. The authors usually utilize a fake Java or\nFlash update, but recently, perhaps unsurprisingly, we have observed their spam abusing the fear around\nCOVID-19 as well.\n\nWe have named this malware family based on its most notable characteristic – its binaries being bloated to at\nleast a few hundred megabytes. Its development is quite rapid and feature changes and additions are\nhappening very often. In this blogpost, we will focus on the most noteworthy.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Characteristics\n\nGrandoreiro is another Delphi-written Latin American banking trojan we have identified during our research.\nGrandoreiro has been active at least since 2017 targeting Brazil and Peru, expanding to Mexico and Spain in\n2019 (see Figure 1 for a current detection heat map). The fact that it attacks its victims by displaying fake popup windows that try to persuade victims to divulge sensitive information should come as no surprise to anyone\nwho has read the previous pieces in the series.\n.\n\n_Figure 1. Heat map showing ESET’s detections of Grandoreiro._\n\nGrandoreiro, as with any other Latin American banking trojan, employs backdoor functionality, being capable\nof:\n\nmanipulating windows\nupdating itself\ncapturing keystrokes\nsimulating mouse and keyboard actions\nnavigating the victim’s browser to a chosen URL\nlogging the victim out or restarting the machine\nblocking access to chosen websites\n\nPersistence is ensured by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. Of importance is the fact that\n[Grandoreiro uses the same algorithm for decrypting its internal strings as Casbaneiro. We believe this is due to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/03/casbaneiro-trojan-dangerous-cooking/)\ninformation sharing between authors of banking trojans in Latin America.\n\nGrandoreiro collects the following information about its victims:\n\ncomputer name\nusername\noperating system version and bitness\nwhether Diebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia (an application, popular in Brazil, to protect access to online\nbanking) is installed\nlist of installed security products\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some versions, it also steals credentials stored in the Google Chrome web browser and data stored in\nMicrosoft Outlook.\n\nThe authors of Grandoreiro seem to be developing the banking trojan very rapidly, as we observe at least\nseveral new versions each month. We also suspect they are developing at least two variants simultaneously.\n\nThe authors seem to focus mainly on two areas. The first is hiding the actual C&C address using the Domain\nGeneration Algorithm (DGA) described in next section. The second is making the banking trojan modular. This\nis an interesting approach as the authors first introduced separate Delphi forms for each bank targeted (which\nis quite common), but lately even created separate DLLs for each targeted bank. We have not seen this\napproach in any other Latin American banking trojan we have analyzed.\n\n### DGA\n\nGrandoreiro’s DGA uses two strings (prefix and suffix) hardcoded in the binary and the local date as inputs.\nThose values are processed by a simple algorithm yielding a result in the form\nhttps://sites.google[.]com/view/%DATA%, where %DATA% is the generated string (we provide pseudocode in\nFigure 2). The C&C domain and port are used as the site title, as you can see in Figure 3. Note that based on\nthe DGA, a different website is required for each day. We have observed some variants also using a custom\nbase64 alphabet.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\ndef dga(prefix, suffix):\n\nts = get_current_time()\n\nmid_data = \"%02d/%02d/%04d\" % (ts.day, ts.month, ts.year)\n\nmid_data = b64encode(mid_data)\n\nmid_data = mid_data.replace(\"==\", \"\")\n\nreturn \"https://sites.google.com/view/\" + prefix + mid_data + suffix\n\n\n_Figure 2. Pseudocode of Grandoreiro’s DGA_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Example of a Google site set up by authors of Grandoreiro (translation: “Title of your page”)_\n\n### Configuration data\n\nIn older versions of Grandoreiro, there was a small .ini file distributed alongside the banking trojan that served\nas a primitive configuration file, containing only a version identifier and an index into a table in the binary that\ndecided which C&C server should be used.\n\nLately, the configuration mechanism has been changed and is now stored in the Windows Registry at\nHKCU\\Software\\ under keys with names like %USERNAME% and ToolTech-RM. Those names, as well as the\nnames of values they contain, change frequently, but the information contained consists of:\n\nan identifier unique for each victim (generated via CoCreateGuid API)\nexecutable name and path\n[geolocation of the victim (retrieved via http://ipinfo.io/json)](http://ipinfo.io/json)\nstrings necessary for creating and deleting the startup .LNK file\nnotes specific to the victim device (the C&C operator supplies these, if any, via a backdoor command)\nflags to indicate an action has already been performed, such as\n\nstealing Google Chrome stored credentials\nstealing Outlook data\n\n## C&C communication\n\n[Grandoreiro implements communication with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK. This component](https://rtc.teppi.net/)\nuses a protocol that operates over HTTP. After connecting to the server, Grandoreiro performs a handshake\nand then periodically checks for commands every few seconds. If the trojan misses a check, the server drops\nthe connection.\n\n[As we described in our Botconf presentation in December 2019, and as reported recently by SonicWall, there](https://www.botconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/B2019-Soucek-Hornak-DemystifyingBankingTrojansFromLatinAmerica.pdf)\nis a very interesting thing about the first “command” received from the C&C server. It is always a list of all\ncurrently connected victims, including all the collected information about their machines, as you can see in\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Note that not all the victims are identified by a string with the same format. Due to Grandoreiro s rapid\ndevelopment, this string changes quite often, but victims compromised with different variants still connect to the\nsame C&C server.\n\n_Figure 4. C&C server responding to initial Grandoreiro connection with a list of currently connected victims._\n\n## Distribution\n\nSpam seems to be the sole distribution method for Grandoreiro. The spam emails appear to contain a link\npointing to a website offering fake Flash or Java updates (see Figure 5). Notice the red arrow in lower left\ncorner tailored for the Google Chrome web browser, but displayed in other browsers too. We have seen\nGrandoreiro abusing the fear around COVID-19 as well (see Figure 6), as we already announced on our\n[@ESETresearch Twitter account.](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1227955729191129100)\n\n_Figure 5. Fake Flash (left) and Java (right) update websites (the left checkbox states that the user agrees with terms and_\n\n_conditions; the text on the right urges the user to install the latest version of Java to avoid issues with security and_\n\n_vulnerabilities)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Fake COVID-19 website. Clicking the video leads to the ZIP archive being downloaded (translation:_\n\n_“Construction of 2 hospitals in 7 days: accelerated video shows construction of hospital in China in 7 days”)_\n\nUnlike the majority of Latin American banking trojans, Grandoreiro utilizes quite small distribution chains. For\ndifferent campaigns, it may choose a different type of downloader, as we illustrate in Figure 7. These\ndownloaders are often stored on well-known public online sharing services such as GitHub, Dropbox, Pastebin,\n4shared and 4Sync.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Possible ways that Grandoreiro distribution chains may appear (different colors show different paths the chain_\n\n_may take). The final ZIP archive may be encrypted and in some cases also protected by a password._\n\nThe final payload is a ZIP archive that is usually encrypted by the algorithm shown in Figure 8 and, in a\nsignificant number of cases, we saw it being password-protected as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\ndef decrypt_archive(data_enc, key):\n\ndata_dec = list()\n\nfor (i, c) in enumerate(data_enc):\n\nd = c ^ (~(key >> (i % 32))) & 0xFF\n\ndata_dec.append(d)\n\nreturn data_dec\n\n\n_Figure 8. Pseudocode of the archive decryption algorithm used by Grandoreiro_\n\nDistributing the final payload in a ZIP archive is very common among these banking trojans, but in the case of\nGrandoreiro, it holds extra importance, as you will see in the next section.\n\n## Binary padding\n\n[The vast majority of Grandoreiro samples utilize a very interesting application of the binary padding technique.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1009/)\nThis technique is all about making the binaries large and we have seen it being used even by more\nsophisticated malware. We have also observed some other Latin American banking trojans employing it\noccasionally, but only in the simplest form of appending a large amount of junk at the end of the binary.\n\nGrandoreiro chooses a different approach – a simple, yet very effective one. The resources section of the PE\nfile is augmented by (usually 3) grande BMP images, making each binary at least 300 MB in size. Notice in\nFigure 9 that the size of the whole EXE is 425 MB, yet the size of the code is only 4 MB and the size of the\n.rsrc section 419 MB (98.5% of the total size). After examining the contents of the .rsrc section, we see three\nimages with sizes of 112 MB, 112 MB and 105 MB respectively (taking up 78.5% of the section size). We\nprovide examples of such images in Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 9. Details of a Grandoreiro binary. Several Grandoreiro binaries are shown in the image on the left. The rest show_\n\n_details of one such binary._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. BMP images used by Grandoreiro for binary padding. Their artistic “style” suggests the malware’s authors_\n\n_create them manually._\n\nBecause of the structure of those BMP files, compressing the binary into a ZIP archive yields a file of only a\nfew MB, making it much easier to distribute the payload. The BMP files seem to change frequently, most likely\nto avoid detection. The images shown in Figure 10 come from three different builds of Grandoreiro. The visible\nsimilarities lead us to believe the authors update the images manually.\n\nLet us look at the possible outcomes of this technique because, even though it is very simple, it is surprisingly\n[effective. The upload file size limit on VirusTotal was changed to 550 MB during 2019, but used to be 256 MB,](https://blog.virustotal.com/2017/08/virustotal-gets-new-hairdo.html)\nso a victim was unable to scan the file using that platform. Working with such a huge file is harder in general,\nmaking any automated or manual analyses much slower. At the same time, it is very hard to get rid of these\nlarge images while keeping a valid PE file, and by discarding the whole .rsrc section, interesting information\nsuch as the fake pop‑up windows is lost.\n\n## Self-protection & anti-emulation\n\nFor a Latin American banking trojan, Grandoreiro utilizes a surprisingly large number of tricks to evade\ndetection and emulation. In this section, we talk about the most notable ones that appeared in several recent\nversions we have analyzed.\n\nDiebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia and Trusteer are known banking access protection software popular in Latin\nAmerica. Every banking trojan described so far in our series has implemented some sort of check for these\nprograms. Grandoreiro is no exception, by\n\nhooking the LdrLoadDll and LoadLibrary(Ex) APIs to prevent loading DLLs belonging to those products\nchecking if any of those modules are already loaded\ntrying to kill their running processes (based on process names)\nblocking Diebold Warsaw on the firewall level\ntrying to break Trusteer by changing its file system path (see Figure 11)\nchanging ACLs on main Trusteer binary by running this command twice:\n\ncacls %PROGRAM_DATA%; Trusteer\\Rapport\\store\\exts\\RapportCerberus\\baseline\\RapportGH.dll”\n/T /E /C /P user:perm\nwith user:perm set to Todos:N and then Everyone:N\n\n_Figure 11. Simple BAT script used by Grandoreiro to change Trusteer file path in hopes of making it unable to execute_\n\n\n-----\n\nBesides that, it also monitors hooks on important functions. If such a function starts with 0xE9 (assembly\nopcode for the jmp instruction), the trojan reloads the function from the corresponding library. Based on window\nand process names, it also checks for tools like RegMon, RegShot, Wireshark and Process Explorer. It tries to\navoid being debugged by calling the IsDebuggerPresent API and setting up a hook via SetWindowsHookEx\nthat returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED on the WH_DEBUG event.\n\n[Grandoreiro also employs a technique for privilege escalation described in more detail here. The method relies](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-macro-bypasses-uac-to-elevate-privilege-for-fareit-malware.html)\non registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files and then running such a file. By doing so, the\nbinary will be executed with elevated privileges. This technique no longer works on patched systems due to a\n[fix released in 2017.](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/microsoft-fixes-eventvwr-exe-uac-bypass-exploit-windows-10-creators-update/)\n\nFinally, Grandoreiro detects two virtual environments – VMWare via its special I/O port and Virtual PC via the\n[vpcext instruction. Both methods are described in detail here (techniques 1 and 2).](https://shasaurabh.blogspot.com/2017/07/virtual-machine-detection-techniques.html)\n\n## Spam tool\n\nDuring our investigation, we discovered a tool used for Grandoreiro’s spam campaigns. It is not a tool that\n[automatically registers large numbers of email accounts, as in the case of Amavaldo and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/01/banking-trojans-amavaldo/) [Casbaneiro; it is](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/03/casbaneiro-trojan-dangerous-cooking/)\n[actually used to create and send the spam messages. It does so by utilizing the EASendMail SDK.](https://www.emailarchitect.net/easendmail)\n\nBesides its main purpose, the tool sets up persistence using the Windows Registry Run key and disables UAC.\nThe most probable scenario is that the attackers distribute this tool to some victims via Grandoreiro.\n\nA small backdoor component is included and used to receive configuration files. Those files dictate what the\nemails will look like, what they will point to or where to send them. We provide a complete list of the\nconfiguration files and their purpose in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1. List of configuration files used by Grandoreiro’s spam tool_\n\n**Filename** **Purpose** **Description**\n\nID.txt None Seems not to be used for the spam emails\n\nhtml.txt Email body template Template for the email body (including placeholders - those are\nreplaced by values from other config files)\n\n\nassunto.txt Subject template\n(assunto = subject)\n\n\nTemplate for subject (similar to html.txt for email body)\n\n\nnomes.txt List of fake names Replaces [NOME] placeholder in the templates\n\nlink.txt List of malicious URLs The email will link to one of these\n\nlista.txt List of recipients The email will be sent to all of these\n\nlogin.txt List of usernames Information required to log into the email account that will be used to\nsend the emails\n\nsenha.txt List of passwords\n\nsmtp.txt SMTP server address\n\nAs you can see, the tool is not fully automated, but relies completely on the configuration data. This shows a\nlower level of sophistication. Its implementation shows similarities with the Grandoreiro banking trojan, which is\nwhy we believe it was written by the same authors.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this installment of our series, we have focused on Grandoreiro, a Latin American banking trojan known to\ntarget Brazil, Mexico, Spain and Peru. We have mentioned aspects that are typical for that type of banking\ntrojan, such as being written in Delphi, containing backdoor functionality, targeting Latin America and using\nfake pop-up windows to attack its victims.\n\nA novel feature of Grandoreiro is its great effort to evade detection. That includes many techniques to detect or\neven disable banking protection software. It also utilizes a very specific application of the binary padding\ntechnique we have not seen before that makes it hard to get rid of the padding while keeping a valid file.\n\nSpam appears to be the exclusive distribution method for Grandoreiro. The emails contain a link that points\nvictims to fake websites set up by the operators. While they usually use simple mechanisms such as fake\nFlash or Java updates, we have seen them exploiting the current fear of COVID-19 as well.\n\nGrandoreiro shows similarities with other banking trojans previously described in this series, mainly\nCasbaneiro, with which it shares the string decryption algorithm.\n\n_For any inquiries, contact us at threatintel@eset.com.
