Will it survive the ever-tightening controls on macro-enabled documents?\n\n[Rene Holt](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/rholt/)\n16 Jun 2022 - 11:30AM\n\nEmotet malware is back with ferocious vigor, according to ESET telemetry in the first four\nmonths of 2022. Will it survive the ever-tightening controls on macro-enabled documents?\n\n\n-----\n\n[One of the key findings from the ESET Threat Report T1 2022 is that the Emotet botnet has](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/02/eset-threat-report-t12022/)\nrisen, Phoenix-like, from the ashes, pumping out vast amounts of spam in March and April\n2022, to the point that its detections grew more than a hundredfold in the first four months\nof 2022 compared to the last four months of 2021. Much of this activity involved Word\ndocuments tainted with malicious macros.\n\n_Figure 1. Emotet detections in ESET telemetry_\n\nBecause Microsoft is [tightening up the default handling of macro-enabled files, finagling](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/helping-users-stay-safe-blocking-internet-macros-by-default-in/ba-p/3071805)\nrecipients into clicking “Enable Content” will not remain a viable tactic for long. What does\nthis mean for Emotet? Could this extremely pervasive threat even sink into oblivion barely a\nfew months after it shook off the effects of the [law enforcement operation hailed as one of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/28/emotet-botnet-disrupted-global-operation/)\nthe largest of its kind ever?\n\nNot so fast – Emotet’s operators aren’t known for resting on their laurels.\n\n## Emotet – a macro view\n\n_First sighted as a banking trojan in June 2014, Emotet has since changed drastically into a_\n_crime-as-a-service platform, selling access to compromised systems to other criminal_\n_groups. Thus, once Emotet is running on a computer, it typically downloads and executes_\n_other strains of malware, such as Dridex, Gootkit, IcedId, Nymaim, Qbot, TrickBot, Ursnif,_\n_and Zbot._\n\n_Emotet has a modular program design, with a main module that is disseminated through_\n_vast spam campaigns that distribute emails containing malicious Microsoft Word_\n_documents Emotet then uses additional modules to:_\n\n\n-----\n\n_spread further by assembling and delivering spam emails_\n_spread to nearby, insecure Wi-Fi networks by compromising connected users_\n_brute-force network share usernames and passwords_\n_turn compromised systems into proxies within its command-and-control infrastructure_\n_abuse legitimate Nirsoft applications, such as MailPassView and WebBrowserView,_\n_that can recover passwords from popular email clients and web browsers,_\n_respectively._\n_steal email addresses and names from the compromised system’s Microsoft Outlook_\n_instance_\n_steal all email messages and attachments from compromised systems_\n\n_In 2018, Emotet resuscitated an effective technique – email thread hijacking – to increase_\n_the likelihood of a potential victim opening the email attachments. It started stealing email_\n_conversations found in compromised systems’ inboxes and reusing them in its spam_\n_campaigns. This is, of course, a very effective way of adding legitimacy to a malicious_\n_email:_\n\n_Figure 2. Emotet’s operators use macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malware_\n\n_Should the victim extract the macro-laden Word document from the ZIP archive, open it,_\n_and then click “Enable Content”, the malicious macros can run, ultimately downloading_\n_Emotet._\n\n_[Microsoft’s move (on February 30th](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_non-standard_dates#:~:text=february%2030%20is%20usually%20used%20as%20a%20sarcastic%20date%20for%20referring%20to%20something%20that%20will%20never%20happen%20or%20will%20never%20be%20done.)_ _2022, so to speak) to_ _throw out the “Enable Content”_\n_[button came at a time for Emotet when, after recovering from last year’s takedown efforts, it](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/28/emotet-botnet-disrupted-global-operation/)_\n_[had been churning out spam campaigns en masse in March and April 2022. Taking note of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/02/eset-threat-report-t12022/)_\n_the change, Emotet’s developers have shifted to experimenting with different techniques to_\n_replace their dependence on macros as the initial code stage of their malware delivery_\n_platform._\n\n## Emotet shifting techniques\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween April 26 and May 2 [, 2022, ESET researchers picked up a test campaign run by](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1518923380782739458)\nEmotet operators where they replaced the typical Microsoft Word document with a shortcut\n(LNK) file as the malicious attachment.\n\n_Figure 3. A malicious email sent by Emotet’s operators_\n\n_Figure 4. Another malicious email sent by Emotet’s operators_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Yet another malicious email sent by Emotet’s operators_\n\n_Figure 6. And another malicious email sent by Emotet’s operators_\n\nWhen double-clicked, a shortcut file can launch a target resource, in this case, a\nPowerShell script that downloaded and executed Emotet:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Emotet’s operators use shortcut (LNK) files to deliver malware_\n\nMost [detections were in Japan (28%), Italy (16%), and Mexico (11%).](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/02/eset-threat-report-t12022/)\n\nIn an earlier test campaign between April 4 and April 19, the Emotet operators attractedth th\nvictims to a ZIP archive, stored on OneDrive, containing Microsoft Excel Add-in (XLL) files,\nwhich are used to add custom functions to Excel. If extracted and executed, these files\ndropped and ran Emotet.\n\nWhen Emotet’s operators first resurrected their botnet from the takedown efforts in late\n[2021, another campaign was discovered that uses](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-now-drops-cobalt-strike-fast-forwards-ransomware-attacks/) [Cobalt Strike Beacon, a popular](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cobalt_strike)\npentesting tool. By using a Beacon, the Emotet operators can decrease the time to deploy\ntheir final payload – often ransomware.\n\n## Mitigating macro malware\n\nEmailing documents that contain macros is both a common occurrence in corporate\nenvironments and can serve as a technique to deliver malware when those macros are\nmalicious. Recognizing this potential abuse of macros, during the heyday of Word 97\nMicrosoft introduced the first built-in security feature in Word that blocked Visual Basic for\nApplications (VBA) macros from running:\n\n_Figure 8. The default behavior of Word 97 when opening a document containing a VBA macro_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis feature continued to be developed in later versions of Office, now probably most\nfamiliar via the yellow Message Bar with the “Enable Content” button introduced in Office\n2010:\n\n_Figure 9. The Enable Content button in Excel 2010_\n\nSince then, two clicks have been typically required to enable macros: first, clicking on\n“Enable Editing”, which removes the document from Protected View, a security feature in\nplace [since Office 2010 that provides a read-only, sandboxed environment; second, clicking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/office2010/protected-view-in-office-2010)\non “Enable Content”, which allows the macros to run. So long as an admin policy is not in\nplace to prevent recipients from clicking through, the macros successfully load and run.\n\nAlthough the blocking of macros helped limit the delivery of malware, malicious actors, such\nas the Emotet operators, adapted their efforts by focusing on duping victims into clicking\nthrough to enable macros.\n\nWith a [phased rollout starting in April 2022, Microsoft has been tightening up the default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#versions-of-office-affected-by-this-change)\nhandling of macro-enabled files downloaded from the internet by entirely removing the\noption to click “Enable Content”. After this change is deployed, macros are still blocked from\nrunning as before. So in order to run them, either the data about the file’s zone – sometimes\ncalled the Mark of the Web – needs to be removed, or the file has to come from a zone with\na higher level of trust than that of the internet. These are much more complex actions to\nsocially engineer recipients into and should thus help stymie future spam campaigns.\n\nSince the increased security benefit offered by this change is only as strong as the Mark of\nthe Web, let’s dive deeper into what it is, how it is used to determine when to block macros\nfrom running, and how spammers attempt to bypass it.\n\n## Deterring malware with the Mark of the Web\n\nThe [Mark of the Web refers to the comment added to HTML files (as well as to MHT and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/compatibility/ms537628(v=vs.85))\nXML files) indicating their host URL:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Browsers add the Mark of the Web to HTML files downloaded from the internet_\n\nThis comment is automatically added by the Internet Explorer browser when the HTML file\nis being saved, or can be added manually by web site developers for testing or by other\nbrowsers and applications. The URL is then used to determine the level of trust assigned to\nthe HTML file and any scripts or active content on which the URL might depend.\n\nBy default, every URL is treated as coming from the Internet zone: that is, as neither trusted\nnor untrusted. Although scripts and other active content embedded in the file can\nautomatically run, they cannot access the local file system.\n\nA URL could be added to different zones: the Restricted Sites zone for potentially unsafe\ncontent, or the Local Intranet and Trusted Sites zones for trusted content; there is also a\nLocal Machine zone that, although it originally allowed scripts and ActiveX content to run\nautomatically as trusted, was eventually equipped with a lockdown feature that prohibited\nsuch automatic execution.\n\nEven before the demise of Internet Explorer, the Mark of the Web was also an informal\nname for the information about a file’s zone that the [New Technology File System (NTFS),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS)\nthe default file system of Windows NT-based operating systems, provides in an Alternate\nData Stream (ADS). In NTFS, [every file has an unnamed stream with a stream type of](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/c54dec26-1551-4d3a-a0ea-4fa40f848eb3)\n$DATA that contains the expected content of the file when it is opened by a program that\ncan handle its file type:\n\n_Figure 11. Opening an NTFS file normally_\n\n_Figure 12. The unnamed (default) stream of an NTFS file contains the same data as when the file is_\n\n_opened normally_\n\nThe filename, the stream name, and the stream type are joined and delimited by colons.\nThus, in the eyes of NTFS, filename.txt is equivalent to filename.txt::$DATA. Notice how\nthere is no stream name, only a file name and a stream type.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, the file s zone is contained in a stream that looks like this:\nfilename.txt:Zone.Identifier:$DATA. The Zone.Identifier is a well-known stream name that\nmodern browsers and some other applications automatically add or propagate to files to\nindicate their zone: the internet, the intranet, the trusted zone, the restricted zone, or the\nlocal machine. Some applications, such as the Chrome browser, add the host URL and the\nreferrer URL to the Zone.Identifier as well:\n\n_Figure 13. Browsers can add the Zone.Identifier stream to files downloaded from the internet_\n\n_(ZoneId=3)_\n\nThere are other known techniques to get around the Mark of the Web that the Emotet gang\ncould try as well. It is possible to use container files, such as ISO disk images and VHDX\nfiles, or compressed/archive files, such as .arj and .gzip files, that do not propagate the\nMark of the Web to files extracted from them. Ultimately, should one of these techniques\nyield a satisfactory return on investment, we can expect Emotet to return with force.\n\n## Abusing Alternate Data Streams\n\nAn NTFS file can contain an arbitrary number of streams, meaning these can and have\nbeen put to malicious use. For example, the Winnti Group operators stored a malicious,\nencrypted payload in a stream they named NULL.DAT. After decryption, the payload was\neither the PortReuse backdoor or the ShadowPad malware.\n\nWhen the Turla operators deployed the Gazer backdoor against embassies and consulates\n[around the world in 2016, the backdoor would hide its files in streams using GUIDs as](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer.pdf)\nstream names when it couldn’t store them in the Windows registry.\n\n[Guildma also used streams as one method of hiding its binary modules, storing multiple](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/03/05/guildma-devil-drives-electric/)\nfiles in the streams of a single file. Specifically, Guildma stored all of its malicious modules,\nincluding a couple of tools from Nirsoft for extracting saved credentials from popular email\nclients and web browsers, as the streams of the single desktop.ini file:\n\ndesktop.ini:nauwuygiaa.jpg (MailPassView)\ndesktop.ini:nauwuygiab.jpg (BrowserPassView)…\n\nFor [targeting air-gapped networks, malicious actors have used streams to hide malicious](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eset_jumping_the_air_gap_wp.pdf)\ncomponents within otherwise innocuous-looking files on USB drives. The streams could\ncontain data being stolen and command-and-control instructions from the malicious\n\n\n-----\n\noperators. Considering that air-gapped networks lack an internet connection, clamping\ndown on the use of USB devices and other portable storage devices travelling in and out of\nair-gapped networks is crucial for their continued security.\n\n[Some malware, like GoBotKR, can remove the Zone.Identifier stream from files to conceal](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/07/08/south-korean-users-backdoor-torrents/)\nthe fact that they were downloaded from the internet zone. This entirely bypasses any\nprotection that relies solely on the Mark of the Web to determine when to block macros from\nrunning.\n\nFinally, spammers like the Emotet developers have taken a social engineering approach,\nattempting to trick recipients into enabling macros instead of removing the Zone.Identifier\nstream or using streams to hide payloads – until now.\n\n## Security tips\n\nBe aware that some software does not add or propagate the Zone.Identifier stream, at least\nnot consistently. For example, using 7-Zip to extract a .exe file from an archive downloaded\nfrom the internet does not propagate the archive’s Zone.Identifier to its contents, meaning\nthat there is no Mark of the Web to trigger any security blocks or warnings if any of the\nextracted files are run. The Zone.Identifier is propagated, however, by double-clicking on\nthe .exe from within the archive. (UPDATE: Version 22.00 of 7-Zip offers a new menu option\n_and a new command line switch to enable propagation of the Zone.Identifier.)_\n\nIn light of the removal of the “Enable Content” button, a handy list that tracks whether file\n[archivers support the Mark of the Web has been compiled in GitHub here.](https://github.com/nmantani/archiver-MOTW-support-comparison)\n\nFor organizations that rely on macros as part of employees’ workflows, IT admins may need\nto [adjust the policies for how Office handles macros. Furthermore, organizations should](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#use-policies-to-manage-how-office-handles-macros)\ntake advantage of this opportunity to review their security stance against threats vectoring\nvia email with the following:\n\nUse an email security solution that can block phishing, spam, and other malicious\nemails from reaching inboxes.\nRun phishing simulation exercises to test and renew employees’ security awareness.\nConsider deploying a detection and response solution that can help track down\nwhether the root cause of a cyberattack on your network was a malicious email or a\ndifferent vector.\n\nThe impending close of the era of the “Enable Content” button has two consequences. First,\nthat users can expect better protection against malicious macros delivered via email.\nSecond, that spammers like Emotet are adapting their favorite tactics to dupe their future\nvictims. Should any of these experiments prove successful, we can expect new malicious\ncampaigns to hit inboxes, meaning that continued vigilance for email-based threats should\nremain top of mind\n\n\n-----\n\n_UPDATE (June 27, 2022): This article was updated to add information about new features_\n_in 7-Zip._\n\n16 Jun 2022 - 11:30AM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
