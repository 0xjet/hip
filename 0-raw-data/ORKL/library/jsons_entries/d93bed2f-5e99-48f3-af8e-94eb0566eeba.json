Executive Summary\n\nThe Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has discovered new malware\nattacks in Syria, with malicious entities using a plethora of methods from their toolbox to hide\nand operate malware. In addition to proficient social engineering tricks, victims are often tempted\nto open and explore malicious files because of the dire need for privacy and security tools in the\nregion. In the hopes of maintaining anonymity and installing the latest “protection”, victims fall prey\nto these malicious creations. A vast majority of the samples obtained were found on activist sites\nand in social networking forums.\n\nThe victims are distributed across different countries:\n\n- Syria\n\n- Lebanon\n\n- Turkey\n\n- Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\n- Egypt\n\n- Jordan\n\n- Palestine\n\n- United Arab Emirates\n\n- Israel\n\n- Morocco\n\n- United States\n\nThe group members are operating from different locations around the world:\n\n- Syria\n\n- Russian Federation\n\n- Lebanon\n\nThe group’s attacks are evolving and they are making extensive use of social engineering techniques\nto trick targeted victims into running their malicious files. Among the principal file extensions\nobserved among the malware samples obtained we can list:\n\n- .exe\n\n- .dll\n\n- .pif\n\n- .scr\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group is relying on RAT (Remote Access Tool) Trojan tools, of which the most common are:\n\n- ShadowTech RAT\n\n- Xtreme RAT\n\n- NjRAT\n\n- Bitcomet RAT\n\n- Dark Comet RAT\n\n- Blackshades RAT\n\nThe number of malicious files found is 110, with a big increase seen in recent attacks.\n\nThe number of domains linked to the attacks is 20.\n\nThe number of IP addresses linked to the attacks is 47.\n\nThe samples details and domains lists used by the attackers can be found in the Appendices 1 and 2\nin the end of the document.\n\nProtection and resilience against these attacks is ensured through the use of a multi-layered security\napproach, having up to date security products, and mainly by being sceptical about suspicious files.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Contents\n\n1.

Introduction\n\nThe geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have deepened in the last few years; Syria is no\nexception. The crisis is taking many forms, and the cyberspace conflict is intensifying as sides try to\ntilt the struggle, by exploiting cyber intelligence and exercising distortion.\n\nIn the last few years cyber-attacks in Syria have moved into the front line; many activities in\ncyberspace have been linked to Syria, especially those conducted by the Syrian Electronic Army and\npro-government groups.\n\nThe Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has found new malware attacks\nin Syria, using new but not advanced techniques to hide and operate malware, in addition to using\nproficient social engineering tricks to deliver malware by tricking and tempting victims into opening\nand exploring malicious files. The malware files have been found on hacked activist sites, web pages\nand in social networking forums.\n\n[Cyber Arabs, an Arabic-language digital security project of the IWPR (Institute for War and Peace](https://www.cyber-arabs.com/)\nReporting), reported four of these samples in March 2014. The same samples were also reported\non Syrian Facebook pages (,تقنيون ألجل الحرية [Technicians For Freedom): https://www.facebook.com/](https://www.facebook.com/tech4freedom)\n[tech4freedom](https://www.facebook.com/tech4freedom)\n\nGiven the complexity of the situation, there are many factors and entities at play in this event, but\n\nfrom the outside these are all largely speculative. Pro-government groups talk about “defense” and\nopposition activists talk about “offense”. Here, we will only focus on the malware and the facts that\nhave been found during the analysis, presenting only relevant information, in the hope of setting a\nclear context for this research.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 3. Analysis\n\n## 3.1. Infection Vectors\n\nMalware writers are using multiple techniques to deliver their files and entice the victims to run them,\ncreating an effective infection vector. Mainly depending on social engineering the attackers exploit:\n\n- Victims’ trust in social networking forums\n\n- Victims’ curiosity in following news related to political conflict in Syria\n\n- Victims’ fear of attacks from government\n\n- Victims’ lack of technology awareness\n\nOnce they have infected the victim’s computer, attackers have full access and control over victim’s\ndevices. In the following section we show different versions of posts sent via popular file sharing\nsites or social networking platforms. The sample details and domain lists used by the attackers can\nbe found in the Appendices 1 and 2 in the end of the document.\n\n### 3.1.1. Skype messages\n\nMessages sent via Skype offer links to download:\n1. The “SSH VPN” program to encrypt communication\n2. The popular and effective antivirus with daily updates from “Ammazon Internet Security”\n\n3. The “SmartFirewall” to block connections made by malware and bad programs\n\nThe messages are usually sent from fake or compromised accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.1.2. Facebook posts\n\nThe same messages sent via Skype are also shared via the Facebook social platform, asking victims\nto install these “security programs” to protect themselves from malware infections and cyber-attacks,\nespecially government attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.1.3. YouTube Videos\n\nIn the following example, we can see a YouTube video providing links to download fake Whatsapp\nand Viber applications for PC. By using everyday technologies that are commonly used by a broad\naudience, attackers increase the effectiveness of their operations and their infection rates.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3.2. Samples and types of files\n\nAnalysis has led us to identify the following RAT variants being used in the wild:\n\n- ShadowTech RAT\n\n- Xtreme RAT\n\n- NjRAT\n\n- Bitcomet RAT\n\n- Dark Comet RAT\n\n- BlackShades RAT\n\nThe samples collected during our research can be classified as follows.\n\n**Old samples**\n\nSamples obtained during 2013 are simple RAT executable files, compressed and sent to victims\nusing a wide range of delivery options. Newer samples were typically found to use “.scr” containers\nin order to hide malicious files and avoid early detection by security solutions.\n\n**New samples**\n\nMore recent samples, starting from the end of 2013, have shown a more organized development\neffort, creating highly stealth and graphically-enticing applications.\n\nIn this analysis we have seen how Syrian malware has evolved, showing no signs of stopping any\ntime soon. Even though new malicious Syrian samples are appearing each day, the subset presented\nhere will hopefully give the reader an overall view of the techniques and tools that are currently\nbeing used to target Syrian citizens.\n\n### 3.2.1. The National Security Program\n\n**[Curiosity killed the cat: browsing a previously leaked spreadsheet of wanted activists leads to](http://www.gemyakurdan.net/doc/Asmae-almtlbin.xlsx)**\n**infection.**\n\nWe found a set of compressed files on a popular social networking site; when, extracted it\nshowed a database containing a list of activists and wanted individuals in Syria. A video entitled\n“ “إختراق أجهزة الكمبيوتر الخاصة بالمجرم علي مملوك وباقي عصابة االسدwas published on November 9 2013, and\nthe download link for this database application was included in the information section of the video.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe download URL redirected victims to a file-sharing service where the file was being hosted. The\ncompressed RAR file “.برنامج االٔمن الوطني rar”, with the MD5 signature 0c711bf29815aecc65016712981\n59a74 and a file-size of 7,921,063 bytes was protected with the password “111222333”.\n\nThe video requests the victim to scan the password protected “.rar” file using VirusTotal to verify\nthat it is not infected.\n\nAfter extracting all the files to a temporary folder, we were presented with the application itself and\na text file needed to access the “hidden” features of the program.\n\nThe file “PASSWORD.txt file” contained the following text:\n\n**syria123!@#**\n\nال تبخلوا علينا بالدعاء قراصنة جبهة النصرة\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon closer inspection, the first and last buttons of the application were functional, but the others\ngenerated error messages (claiming that some files were missing).\n\nThe first button (,فيش عام شامل General Global File) uses “data-base.db.exe” (MD5 8f16efb51fe67961e\ne31c4f36cbe11db), which was placed into “C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming“and, when executed,\nextracts the Excel spreadsheet file “Data-Base.xslx” (MD5 f0a8a1556efbb106b6297700d4cce61b)\nfrom the “Data-Base.db” (MD5 95a5c3e91bbb4a3a323433841fbef82a) file in the main folder.\n\nThe last button ( )إنهاء البرنامج is the exit button.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is some interesting information worth noting:\n\n- “.برنامج االٔمن الوطني exe” is not detected as a malicious file.\n\n- The file “data-Base.db” is detected as a malicious file.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file “data-base.db” is a compressed archive:\n\n- Product name from the file signature: Project1\n\n- Publisher name from the signature: Syrian malware\n\n- Compilation Timestamp: 2013-11-09 14:47:26\n\nWhen system32.exe is run, the process “iexplorer.exe” is spawned and is automatically registered for\n[Startup. The file connects to the IP address 31.9.48.7 TCP on port 999. As mentioned in previous](https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/8202/Garfield_Garfield_True_or_the_story_behind_Syrian_Malware_NET_Trojans_and_Social_Engineering)\n[reports, the IP address 31.9.48.7 belongs to the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE).](https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/8202/Garfield_Garfield_True_or_the_story_behind_Syrian_Malware_NET_Trojans_and_Social_Engineering)\n\nOther temporary files used for the infection were also detected, such as “system32.exe” (MD5:\n```\n9424b355a3670fd7749d3d25cbea18cb) which was copied into the “C:\\Users\\user\\appdata\\\n\n```\nlocal\\temp\\” folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe presence of DarkComet’s “DC_MUTEX-*” was a giveaway of the usage of this remote\nadministration tool.\n\nDuring infection, the Excel spreadsheet is displayed, comprising 96763 rows and 13 columns of\nactivist information. The rows correspond to records of individuals wanted by the government and\nthe columns correspond to information about the individuals. While there is no column description,\ndata in each column reflects the type of data.\n\n### 3.2.2. Files named “Scandals” are quite attractive Using shockingly disturbing videos to distribute malware\n\nA disturbing video showing injured victims of recent bombings was used to appeal to people’s fear\nand exert them to download a malicious application available in a public file-sharing website. After\nour initial analysis, the file named “.فضائح exe” proved to be heavily obfuscated with the commercial\nutility “MaxToCode” for .NET as a means of avoiding early detection by antivirus solutions.\n\nWhen executed, the original sample created another executable file in the Windows’ temporary\nfolder (C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp) named “Trojan.exe”, which corresponds to\nthe code of the RAT itself. This is used to save all keystrokes and system activity to another file in\nthe same location, “Trojan.exe.tmp”.\n\n\n-----\n\nCaptured information is sent to a dynamic domain corresponding to the host “hacars11.no-ip.biz”,\nusing local port 1177 with no SSL encryption (but base64 encoded), making the analysis of the\nnetwork traffic a much easier task. During the initial connection to the remote server (after an initial\nping to check for internet connectivity), the Trojan will send the machine’s name, installed Windows\nversion, logged username, webcam availability and the version of the RAT in use.\n\nSeveral embedded command line scripts are in charge of adding the Trojan’s executable file to the\nWindows Firewall allowed list, while at the same time disabling security zone checking in Internet\nExplorer. System persistence is obtained via a modification in the “Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Run” registry key and by adding a copy of the malware to the Startup folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven though different obfuscation techniques are used in the samples we analysed, all of them have\nunderlying dependencies on the .NET framework namespaces, which eventually allows deep source\ncode inspection of the threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.2.3. “Ammazon Internet Security” the “popular Antivirus”\n\nIf you thought the era of fake antivirus programs was over, here comes a newly developed sample\nto challenge your beliefs. With the innocent title of “Ammazon Internet Security”, this malicious\napplication tries to mimic a security scanner, even including a quite thorough graphical user\ninterface and some interactive functionality.\n\nAgain, this shows the simplicity of creating a graphical user interface that will trick most of the nontech-savvy population. Using nothing more than a couple of buttons and a catchy name, Syrian malware\ngroups were hoping that the intended victims would fall for the trap. Analyzing the code interestingly\nrevealed that it has the look--feel of a security application; but, of course, no real security features. While\nsilently executing a remote administration tool when launching this “security suite”, targeted victims\nwere left without their “Ammazon” protection but witha RAT installed.\n\nFrom the Windows process list shown in Process Explorer, we were able to see “J. L Antivirus 4.0”\nexecuting in our system, and through Process Monitor we caught the creation of the “analysis” log\nfile for our fake antivirus. Behind the curtains, a connection is made to a remote host, sending real\ntime information on all our activities — the real cost of this free internet security suite!\n\nAmong the many programming methods found inside the source code, we were even able to find\na “CheckForUpdates” function; and if you look closely enough you can even see “Detection” and\n“Quarantine” assemblies included in this application. So, not only has a lot of work gone into creating\nthis fake antivirus, the authors also followed good programming practices and implemented modules for\neach specific (albeit fake) functionality. Maybe at a really quick first sight this could pose as a legitimate\ntool, but a deeper inspection reveals its true malicious nature.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe real log file was one where all keystrokes were recorded and later sent from the computer via a TCP\nconnection. Even though this type of keylogging functionality is nothing new, when we consider how\nthese malicious applications are being used, and the control they give to the attackers, we can start to\nmeasure the importance of reporting these threats and providing protection from them.\n\nEvidently, the malware authors didn’t care much to provide an option to close the “antivirus”,\nand if you were to kill the process you would get a nice ‘blue screen of death’ and an unexpected\nsystem reboot. Surely, the fake application will load again once everything is back up, creating an\ninteresting method for guaranteeing persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.2.4. You’ve installed the latest antivirus solution, now let’s “protect your   network”\n\nTotal Network Monitor (which is a legitimate application) was inside another sample we found,\nused with embedded malware for spying purposes. Offering security applications to protect against\nsurveillance is one of the many techniques used by malware writing groups to get victims who are in\ndesperate need for privacy to execute these dubious programs.\n\nAn almost fully functional version of the “Total Network Monitor” utility is included. What this\nmodified version does not show is the remote connection made to a host where f system information\nis dumped. The actual infection is performed when first clicking on the installer, which uses\nobfuscation to hide all malicious activity until the “legitimate” tool is completely installed.\n\nAs with other samples reviewed, system persistence is obtained by modifying Windows start-up registry\nkeys. Using names such as “Desktop Manager” increases the likelihood for this threat to go unnoticed.\nHowever, the entry name “empty” or “empty.exe” should raise a red flag when auditing these keys.\n\n### 3.2.5. Whatsapp and Viber for PC: Instant messaging, instant infection\n\nAs with other samples, social engineering does all of the heavy work. Instant messaging applications\nfor desktop operating systems have been used in the past to spread malware and it seems that Syrian\nmalware authors have jumped on the bandwagon. In contrast to the “Ammazon Internet Security”, these\nsamples don’t contain any graphical user interface or even an error message that will tell the victim not\nto worry about their security. Heading straight for system infection has proven successful for them, and\nusing these popular application names gets the interest of a much larger audience.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following screenshot shows how the application name, intended functionality and even the icon\nused, all work in conjunction to create a believable story for the victim. And this is not a comprehensive\nlist, by any means. Framing and social engineering techniques are playing an essential role in all Syrian\nrelated malware threats and the trend suggests that the complexity of them will only keep on increasing.\n\n### 3.2.6. Beware of chemical attacks\n\nAnother attack uses social engineering tricks. The sample 38e3bc8776915dbd2e55a4d90f85a872,\nnamed “Kimawi.exe” and with JPG icon, is a RAT file bound to the picture “Kimawi.jpg”. This\npicture is a previously leaked paper supposedly by the regime in Syria warning military units to\nprepare for chemical attacks from friendly units.\n\n\n-----\n\nKimawi.jpg\n\n### 3.2.7. Commands and functionality\n\nDifferent remote administration tools have been spotted in the wild; most of them provide an\nextensive range of functionality to fully control infected systems. These include:\n\n- Keylogging\n\n- Capturing screenshots and webcam control.\n\n- Recording live sound/video.\n\n- Installing programs\n\n- Uploading/downloading files\n\n- File, process and registry key management\n\n- Remote shell\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the most popular RAT found in the samples subset is Dark Comet, a free remote\nadministration tool that provides a comprehensive command set for the attackers to use in their\nmalicious purposes.\n\nDarkComet Control panel & Functionality\n\nAnother RAT widely used in the Arab world is NjRAT, which includes a list of commands (see\nbelow) that can be sent from the controller to the infected system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Option** **Function**\n\n\n“PROC” ~ Retrieve information about current running process\n\nK Kill a process\n\nKD Kill list of processes and delete module files\n\nRE Restart a running process\n\nStart a CMD and direct STDIN and STDOUT to be controlled\n“RSS”\nby C&C\n\n“RS” Send command to CMD\n\n“RSC” Terminate CMD process\n\n“KL” Retrieves keylogging file\n\n“INF” Information about system Drive, malware status\n\n“RN” Download and run a file from a specified URL\n\n“CAP” Screenshots, desktop monitoring\n\n“P” Ping\n\n“UN” ~ Completely Uninstall Trojan\n\n! Terminate Trojan Process\n\n@ Restart Trojan\n\n“UP” Update Trojan\n\n“RG” ~ Enumerate Registry Key\n\n! Set Key Value\n\n@ Delete Registry Key\n\n# Create SubKey\n\n$ Delete SubKey\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.2.8. Evolution of malware attack file numbers\n\nThe attackers are working on full power, and the number of attacks and malicious files being\ndistributed is constantly increasing as they become more organized and proficient. Below is the\ntimeline distribution for malicious files distributed during 2013-2014, based on the first time they\nwere distributed or seen in public (Skype, Facebook, file-sharing, email, etc.).\n\nBelow is the timeline distribution for the collected samples based on compilation time\n\n25\n\n20 Samples timeline based on compilation time\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nQ2 2012 Q3 2012 Q4 2012 Q1 2013 Q2 2013 Q3 2013 Q4 2013 Q1 2014 Q2 2014\n\n\n-----\n\nThe samples details and domains list used by the attackers can be found in the Appendices 1 and 2\nin the end of the document.\n\n### 3.2.9. Locations, domains and team\n\nThe group responsible for the attacks is using common techniques shared by many of the hacking groups\naround the world. They benefit from dynamic domains that can be linked to their modem devices and\nconfigured with forward functionality to a public IP address assigned by the ISP. By restarting their\nmodems they obtain a new address, creating a dynamic infrastructure that can be easily managed.\nDynamic Update Clients (DUC) on their computer devices (usually the same as the RAT server) are in\ncharge of having the dynamic domain provider update to the newly assigned address.\n\nOne of the videos by one of the attackers has shown one of the group members using a TP-Link\nmodem model TD-W8968, commonly found in SOHO environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nYouTube page for one of the Attackers Showing videos about their web defacements, cyberattacks and an interview with radio channel talking about their hacking achievements\n\nSince the end of 2013, the group has extensively relied on a class C IP subnet, 31.9.48.0/24,\nprovided by TARASSUL ISP (Syrian Telecommunications Establishment) for its attacks. We suspect\nthis subnet has been allocated to the group, also an indication that they are now operational from a\nsingle location.\n\nIn early 2014, the group moved to an IP address in Russia (31.8.47.7), to launch multiple new\nattacks.\n\n**Information on domain “All4Syrian.com”**\n\n[This domain is registered for the email aloshalaa@gmail.com. It served as a pro-regime website back](mailto:aloshalaa@gmail.com)\nin 2012 and is being used for the C&C of some of the RAT files.\n[The domain was registered to okpa1984@gmail.com from 2011 to 2013.](mailto:okpa1984@gmail.com)\nMalware has also been seen connecting to xtr.all4syrian.com and vip.all4syrian.com.\n\n**Attackers’ geographical distribution**\n\nThe map below shows the attackers’ geograhical distribution based on the geolocation of the IP\naddresses used by the C&C servers:\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.2.10. Victims\n\nThe distribution of victims is confined only to Syria, but also reaches nearby countries. We have\n\nobserved victims of the Syrian-based malware in:\n\n- Syria\n\n- Lebanon\n\n- Turkey\n\n- Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\n- Egypt\n\n- Jordan\n\n- Palestine\n\n- United Arab Emirates\n\n- Israel\n\n- Morocco\n\n- United States\n\n\n-----\n\nVictims geographical distribution map\n\nMap showing geographical distribution of victims with zoom on the most affected areas\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow are snapshots taken from videos published by the attackers, showing their RAT control panel\nand list of victims. This shows some of the victims located in different countries.\n\nThe sample details and domain lists used by the attackers can be found in Appendices 1 and 2 in the\nend of this document.\n\n### 3.2.11. Activist Behavior\n\nIt is worth noting that we have seen evidence of activists trying to carry out Denial of Service\nattacks on the RAT domains and servers, in an effort to overwhelm their resources and cause their\nconnections to timeout.\n\nThe post below shows a warning from activists about pro-government hacker attacks on Facebook\npages, explaining how pro-government groups post links to Trojanized applications in order to infect\nusers The activists announce in the post that they have spotted a C&C domain used by the Trojans\nand that they are attacking it to remove all hacked victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n“ ”لحذف جميع الضحايا الوجودين للهاك أنشاهلل .. جاري ضرب الهوست translated as “Host Attack in progress .. to\nremove all hacked victims with help of god”.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3.3. Attribution\n\n**Team and positions**\n\nFrom many posts, forums and identification videos, it is clear that the group has an organized\nstructure of teams working together, The names and positions outlined below were collected from\nposts on infiltrated forums or pages.

Kaspersky Lab MENA RAT Statistics\n\nRemote Administration Tool (RAT) Trojans are malicious programs that allow a remote “operator” to\ncontrol a system as if he has physical access to that system. Malicious RATs are widely used by different\ntypes of cybercriminals (hacktivists, script-kiddies, and scammers) and even in some state-sponsored attacks.\n\nSome of the most popular RATs are detected by Kaspersky products as following:\n\n- Trojan.MSIL.Zapchast, also known as Njrat\n\n- Backdoor.Win32.Bifrose, also known as Bitfrose\n\n- Backdoor.Win32.Fynloski, also known as DarkComet\n\n- Backdoor.Win32.Xtreme, also known as Xtremrat\n\nThe statistics below, extracted from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), show the number of\nRAT infection attacks blocked by Kaspersky Lab products in the MENA (Middle East North Africa)\nregion in the 2013-2014 period:\n\n\n**Country/Detection** **Zapchast** **Bitfrose** **Fynloski** **XtremeRAT** **Total**\n\n\nAlgeria 39113 12071 11643 7106 69900+\n\nTurkey 6326 3325 14002 3586 27200+\n\nKSA 9616 5555 5336 4516 25000+\n\nEgypt 5567 5883 4325 2634 18400+\n\nIraq 6756 2280 3235 3055 15300+\n\nUAE 3594 1165 9244 745 14700+\n\nMorocco 4084 2710 3104 1233 11100+\n\nLebanon 426 297 8073 136 8900+\n\nTunisia 2844 1888 1495 1004 7200+\n\nSyria 2806 1897 1362 544 6600+\n\nQatar 1332 327 2177 233 4000+\n\nJordan 1259 680 1104 414 3400+\n\nOman 1241 446 915 374 2900+\n\nBahrain 1218 178 1214 254 2800+\n\nKuwait 454 407 922 345 2100+\n\n\n-----\n\nZapchast\n\nBitfrose\n\nFynloski\n\nXtremeRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on KSN world statistics, the MENA region has one of the highest numbers for RAT attacks, as\nshown below:\n\n\n**Country** **Number of users**\n\n\nAlgeria 39113\n\nIndia 35024\n\nFrance 10955\n\nSaudi Arabia 9616\n\nMexico 6862\n\nIraq 6756\n\nTurkey 6321\n\nEgypt 5567\n\n\nRussian Federation 5526\n\nMalaysia 5014\n\nNjRAT infection Top 10s\n\n- Algeria has the highest number of users facing NjRat infection for the 2013-2014 period and five\ncountries from MENA are in the NjRat top 10\n\n- Algeria has the highest number of users facing Xtreme RAT infection for the 2013-2014 period\nand four countries from MENA are in the Xtreme RAT top 10.\n\n- Four countries from MENA are in the Bifrose top 10 infection list.\n\n- Three countries from MENA are in the DarkComent top 10.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nSyrian malware has a strong reliance on social engineering and the active development of\ntechnologically complex malicious variants. Nevertheless, most of them quickly reveal their true\nnature when inspected carefully; and this is one of the main reasons for urging Syrian users to be\nextra vigilant about what they download and to implement a layered defense approach.\n\nAntivirus software uses either signature or heuristic-based detection to identify malware. On the\none hand, signature detection searches for a unique sequence of bytes that is specific to a piece\nof malicious code. On the other hand, heuristic detection identifies malware based on program\nbehaviour. In our research we were able to collect more than 100 malware samples used to attack\nSyrian citizens. Although most of these samples are known, cybercriminals rely on a plethora of\nobfuscation tools and techniques in order to change the malware structure so as to bypass signature\nscanning and avoid antivirus detection. This proves how critical heuristic technologies are when\nit comes to protecting against these types of attack. By being able to identify variants of known\nmalware types or even new malware families, Kaspersky Lab security products detected all the\ncollected samples.\n\nWe expect these attacks to continue and evolve both in quality and quantity. We expect the\nattackers to start using more advanced techniques to distribute their malware, using malicious\ndocuments or drive-by download exploits. With enough funding and motivation they might also be\nable to get access to zero day vulnerabilities, which will make their attacks more effective and allow\n\nthem to target more sensitive or high profile victims.\n\nEven though the attackers depend mainly on using known RATs, their rapid improvement and\napplication of obfuscation techniques, GUI development for fake applications, and code modification\nvia automated builders, increase the probability that it won’t be too long before they start writing\ntheir own Trojans to take advantage of customized infection capabilities and implement better\nsecurity evasion.\n\nFinally, having a comprehensive and up-to-date antivirus and firewall should be the first measure\ntaken by any user that does any type of online activity, especially during these uncertain times when\nnew cyber threats appear almost daily.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Appendix 1: Samples\n\n## All samples table\n\nThe list of sample files has been collected through the infection vectors detailed above (Skype, Facebook,\nfile-sharing, email, etc.). The samples have been either generated using automated tools (RAT server,\nobfuscation tools) or developed and bound to RAT files, especially the new samples with graphical content.\n\n**First**\n**File information** **Main file MD5** **Special info**\n\n**reported**\n\n - Ammazon Internet Security.rar\n\n - Smart Firewall.rar\n\n - SSH
