We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and\napologize for this inconvenience.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Garmin didn't mention it in their outage alert, multiple flyGarmin services used by\naircraft pilots are also down, including the flyGarmin website and mobile app, Connext\nServices (weather, CMC, and position reports) and Garmin Pilot Apps (Flight plan filing\nunless connected to FltPlan, account syncing, and database concierge).\n\ninReach satellite tech (Service Activation and Billing) and Garmin Explore (Explore site and\nExplore app sign) used for location sharing, GPS navigation, logistics, and tracking through\n[the Iridium satellite network are also down.](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/2020/inReach%20and%20Explore%20Outage.jpg)\n\n[The company's Indian branch first tweeted about some servers being shut down due to](https://twitter.com/Garmin_India/status/1286227663426711553)\nplanned maintenance nine hours ago that would limit the performance of the Garmin\nExpress, Garmin Connect mobile, and website.\n\nFour hours later, Garmin's main Twitter and Facebook accounts shared the same outage\n[message (1,](https://twitter.com/Garmin/status/1286278736581726209) [2) about the incident impacting Garmin Connect services, including the mobile](https://www.facebook.com/Garmin/posts/10157126962365706)\napp and the website, with its call centers also being down due to the outage.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Garmin**\n\n**Connect down for maintenance**\n\nThis outage also affects our call centers, and we are currently unable to receive any\ncalls, emails or online chats. We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as\npossible and apologize for this inconvenience. (2/2)\n\n[— Garmin (@Garmin) July 23, 2020](https://twitter.com/Garmin/status/1286278816302850048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Confirmed WastedLocker ransomware attack\n\nA source close to the Garmin incident response and a Garmin employee confirmed to\nBleepingComputer that the WastedLocker ransomware attacked Garmin.\n\nA Garmin employee told BleepingComputer that they first learned of the attack when they\narrived at their office on Thursday morning.\n\nBleepingComputer was told that the Garmin IT department had tried to remotely shut down\nall computers on the network as devices were being encrypted, including home computers\nconnected via VPN.\n\nAfter being unable to do so, employees were told to shut down any computer on the\nnetwork that they had access to.\n\nIn a photo of a Garmin computer with encrypted files shared with BleepingComputer, you\ncan see that the .garminwasted extension was appended to the file's name, and ransom\nnotes were also created for each file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Source: BleepingComputer**\n\nAs part of this company-wide shutdown, the employee told us that Garmin did a hard\nshutdown of all devices hosted in a data center as well to prevent them from possibly being\nencrypted.\n\nThis company-wide shutdown is what caused the global outage for Garmin Connect and\nother connected services.\n\n[iThome also published a report on a Garmin internal memo earlier about a 'virus' attack](https://archive.fo/VZhk9)\naffecting the company's internal IT servers and databases that caused Garmin Taiwan\nfactories to shut down production lines for two days (on July 24 and 25th).\n\nIf you work at Garmin or know someone working there with first-hand information on this\nincident, you can confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731.\n\nAfter further research, BleepingComputer found the same WastedLocker ransomware\nsample used in the attack on Garmin.\n\nAs WastedLocker samples are customized for each target, having access to the sample lets\nus generate the same ransom note and encrypted files as seen during the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see below, files encrypted with this WastedLocker sample append the same\n**.garminwasted extension and create the same garminwasted_info ransom note as**\nshown in the photo sent to BleepingComputer by the Garmin employee.\n\n**Files encrypted using WastedLocker sample from Garmin**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nFurthermore, the ransom notes generated by the sample are addressed to 'GARMIN', as\nshown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Garmin ransom note**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nReports state that the attack started in Taiwan, which coincides with the location of one of\nthe users who uploaded the sample to VirusTotal.\n\nBleepingComputer was told by one of the sources that the attackers are demanding a $10\nmillion ransom.\n\nBleepingComputer has not been able to verify this amount independently.\n\n## Evil Corp's WastedLocker ransomware\n\nEvil Corp (aka the Dridex gang) is a Russian-based cybercriminal group active since at\nleast 2007 known to be the ones behind Dridex malware and for using ransomware as part\nof their attacks including Locky ransomware and their own ransomware strain known as\nBitPaymer.\n\n[The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned evil Corp gang in December 2019 after](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845)\n[being charged for using Dridex to cause more than $100 million in financial damages.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-hackers-charged-for-stealing-over-100-million/)\n\nDue to this, it is a tricky situation for Garmin if they want to pay the ransom as they would\npotentially be violating United States sanctions.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince then, the hacking group has refreshed their tactics once more and are now again\n[involved in the ransomware \"business,\" deploying their new WastedLocker ransomware in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-wastedlocker-ransomware-distributed-via-fake-program-updates/)\ntargeted corporate attacks and asking for ransoms of millions of dollars.\n\n[Evil Corp operators also used WastedLocker ransomware to encrypt systems on Garmin's](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/wastedlocker/)\nnetwork, which has led to a significant worldwide outage of multiple services and products,\nincluding Garmin Connect, Garmin Explore, Garmin inReach, and flyGarmin.\n\n[Last month, Evil Corp was blocked from deploying WastedLocker ransomware as part of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-blocked-from-deploying-ransomware-on-30-major-us-firms/)\ndozens of attacks against major U.S. corporations, including multiple Fortune 500\ncompanies.\n\nHowever, they did manage to compromise devices used by employees of over 30 major US\nprivate firms using fake software update alerts displayed by the malicious SocGholish\n[JavaScript-based framework delivered through dozens of hacked U.S. newspaper websites.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dozens-of-us-news-sites-hacked-in-wastedlocker-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n_07/26/20 Update: Garmin_ [says on a page dedicated to sharing more information about the](https://www.garmin.com/outage/)\nongoing outage that they are working to restore systems and that no user data was\nimpacted:\n\nWe are working to restore our systems as quickly as possible and apologize for the\ninconvenience.\n\nAlthough Garmin Connect is not accessible during the outage, activity and health and\nwellness data collected from Garmin devices during the outage is stored on the device and\nwill appear in Garmin Connect once the user syncs their device.\n\nGarmin has no indication that this outage has affected your data, including activity, payment\nor other personal information.\n\nGarmin also says that inReach SOS and messaging (including the MapShare website and\nemail reply page) were not impacted by the outage and they are fully functional.\n\n_BleepingComputer has contacted Garmin for more information on this incident, but the mail_\n_bounced back as the mail servers are shut down._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[American
