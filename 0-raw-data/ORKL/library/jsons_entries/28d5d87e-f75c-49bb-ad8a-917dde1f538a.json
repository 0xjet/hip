Closer\nexamination of the loader shows that it loads either a Cobalt Strike shellcode or a previously undocumented backdoor written in Python, a new\ntype of malware that we found to be named BIOPASS RAT (remote access trojan).\n\nBIOPASS RAT possesses basic features found in other malware, such as file system assessment, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and shell\ncommand execution. It also has the ability to compromise the private information of its victims by stealing web browser and instant messaging\nclient data.\n\n[What makes BIOPASS RAT particularly interesting is that it can sniff its victim’s screen by abusing the framework of Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)\n(OBS) Studio, a popular live streaming and video recording app, to establish live streaming to a cloud service via Real-Time Messaging Protocol\n(RTMP). In addition, the attack misuses the object storage service (OSS) of Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) to host the BIOPASS RAT Python scripts as\nwell as to store the exfiltrated data from victims.\n\nWe consider BIOPASS RAT as still being actively developed. For example, some markers that we discovered during our analysis refer to different\nversions of RAT code, such as “V2” or “BPSV3”. Many of the loaders that we found were used to load Cobalt Strike shellcode by default instead of\nthe BIOPASS RAT malware. Furthermore, BIOPASS RAT also creates scheduled tasks to load the Cobalt Strike shellcode during the\ninitialization, indicating that the malicious actor behind the attack still heavily relies on Cobalt Strike.\n\n[We also found several clues that show how the malware might be connected with the Winnti Group(also known as APT41).](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044/)\n\nIn this blog entry, we will dive deeper into BIOPASS RAT with a detailed technical analysis of the infection chain, the different components of the\nmalware, and any possible associations with Winnti.\n\nInfection chain\n\nThe initial delivery mechanism of BIOPASS RAT uses of a watering hole, a compromised website in which the malicious actors inject their\ncustom JavaScript code to deliver malware. In most of the cases that we observed, the attackers usually place their injection script in their\ntarget’s online support chat page.\n\nFigure 1. The login panel of BIOPASS RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Code showing the watering hole attack injection\n\nThe injected script will try to scan the affected host by sending HTTP requests to a list of ports. If it receives any response with an expected string\nfrom these ports, the script will stop. This step is likely designed to avoid attacking an already infected victim.\n\nWe found that the BIOPASS RAT has the ability to open an HTTP service running on localhost on a port chosen from a hard-coded list. This\nfunctionality allows the script to identify whether the victim has already been infected by their malware. It conducts this identification by testing\nwhether the port is open or not and then by checking the response.\n\nFigure 3. The script used to check for existing BIOPASS RAT infections\n\nIf the script confirms that the visitor has not yet been infected, it will then replace the original page content with the attackers’ own content. The\nnew page will show an error message with an accompanying instruction telling website visitors to download either a Flash installer or a\nSilverlight installer, both of which are malicious loaders. It is important to note that both Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight have already\nbeen deprecated by their respective vendors.\n\nFigure 4. The fake Adobe Flash Player download page of the watering hole attack\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. The fake Silverlight download page of the watering hole attack\n\nFigure 6. Anti-VM checks in sample\nc47fabc47806961f908bed37d6b1bbbfd183d564a2d01b7cae87bd95c20ff8a5\n\nFigure 7.

Authenticode-signed files are either downloaded from the official websites (as](https://www.flash.cn/cdm/latest/flashplayerpp_install_cn.exe)\nseen in sample c47fabc47806961f908bed37d6b1bbbfd183d564a2d01b7cae87bd95c20ff8a5) or are hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS on the\nattackers’ account.\n\nVisual C++ runtime, a legitimate and signed vc_redist.x??.exe, and Python runtime are then downloaded.\n\nThese files are also hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS on an attacker-controlled account. The Python runtime is usually a ZIP file with all required\nexecutables, as well as the DLL and Python libraries necessary for running Python scripts on machines where Python is not installed.\n\nScheduled tasks that are activated on a new login are created. These tasks can run a BPS backdoor or a Cobalt Strike loader.\n\nFigure 8. Code excerpt from the scheduled task\n\nWe also noticed the path string “ServiceHub”, which is a path to the extracted Python runtime. After the hex decoding of the arguments, we get a\nPython one-liner that downloads additional Python scripts from the cloud.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Python code for downloading additional components from Alibaba Cloud OSS\n\nFigure 10. The BIOPASS RAT infection flow\n\n## Examining the BIOPASS RAT modules\n\nWe observed a few scheduled tasks being created, with the number dependent on the analyzed sample. In the following section, we provide an\nanalysis for each important backdoor module.\n\n**The cdaemon module**\n\nOne of the modules used is called “cdaemon”. At the time of our research into this threat, only the “print(1)” command is able to be executed. An\nold sample of the module (30ccfbf24b7c8cc15f85541d5ec18feb0e19e75e1e4d2bca9941e6585dad7bc7) is likely a watchdog to check the status of\nanother module that is known as “c1222”.\n\nThe malicious actors can change this behavior by replacing the content of the cdaemon.txt service in the cloud so that when combined with the\nregular execution of the scheduled task, the cdaemon task can behave like a backdoor.\n\nFigure 11. The\ncontent of the\n\ncdaemon.txt\n\nbackdoor\n\n## The c1222 module\n\nThe second scheduled task is called “c1222.txt,” which is a Python code run by a previously downloaded Python runtime. This code runs an\nHTTP server that listens on predefined ports. If accessed by an HTTP client, it returns a marker value.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. The list of predefined ports to bind an HTTP service to, which is reversed\n\nAfter accessing the infected machine with an HTTP server bound to a predefined port, the module returns the marker value.\n\n\nWe also observed other markers — such as, “cs_online”, “online”, and “dm_online”. The purpose of\nthe HTTP service is to act as a marker for an infected machine to avoid repeated infection, as\naforementioned in the infection chain section. The most important task of the c1222 script is to\ndownload, decode, and execute the Cobalt Strike shellcode. Based on the platform, it downloads a file\nwith an encoded shellcode (sc3.txt, x64.txt), and then decodes it (the shellcode is base85 and hexencoded).\n\nFigure 14. Decoding the Cobalt Strike shellcode\n\n## The big module (BIOPASS RAT)\n\n\nFigure 13. The HTTP service with marker\n\nBPSV3\n\n\nThe third scheduled task —is called “big.txt”— is responsible for implementing the BIOPASS RAT malware. This is a Python-based backdoor that\nis distributed in plain text or compiled with Nuitka or PyArmor and PyInstaller.\n\nWhen the malware starts, it checks whether the file with the hard-coded name “%PUBLIC%/20200318” exists. This file is a marker to determine\nif the scheduled task of the backdoor has been installed.\n\nIf the file (that is, the marker) is not found, the backdoor creates a new one and writes the current timestamp onto it. The malware will then\ndelete the scheduled tasks added by the loader and add two new scheduled tasks that are listed in Table 1.\n\nTask Name Behavior\n\nServiceHub Executes Python with a parameter that is the Python script to download and execute Cobalt Strike loader script\n“c1222” module\n\nShellExperienceHost Executes Python with a parameter that is the Python script to download and execute BIOPASS RAT script “big”\nmodule\n\nTable 1. The scheduled tasks created by BIOPASS RAT\n\nThe BIOPASS RAT malware loads a Python script, “online.txt” that will open an HTTP server that listens on one of the following port numbers:\n43990, 43992, 53990, 33990, 33890, 48990, 12880, 22880, 32880, 42880, 52880, or 62880. The HTTP server does nothing but returns string\n“BPSV3” to request.\n\nA second HTTP server will also be created to listen on one of the aforementioned port numbers. The second HTTP server behaves the same as\nthe first but returns a string, “dm_online”, instead. These are the markers of infection as previously mentioned. After the servers are established\nand running, the backdoor creates an execution root directory in the folder “%PUBLIC%/BPS/V3/”.\n\n|Task Name|Behavior|\n|---|---|\n|ServiceHub|Executes Python with a parameter that is the Python script to download and execute Cobalt Strike loader script “c1222” module|\n|ShellExperienceHost|Executes Python with a parameter that is the Python script to download and execute BIOPASS RAT script “big” module|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. The script of a simple HTTP server to return string “dm_online”\n\nIf the malware finds that the system username is “vbccsb”, it will stop. It must be noted that “vbccsb” is the default username on ThreatBook\nCloud Sandbox, a popular alternative to VirusTotal in China.\n\nIf the backdoor finds that the file “debug” present inside the root directory, it will wait for 130 seconds and then continue with execution.\n\nFigure 16. The script used to check the username and debug mode\n\nNext, the backdoor will try to read the file “bps.key” inside the root directory. This file contains the victim ID assigned by the command-andcontrol (C&C) server. If the file hasn’t been created, it will set the victim ID to a null value until the C&C server assigns it.\n\nAt the end of initialization, it collects the information of the victim’s system and initializes values in the global config variable that contains\nimportant configuration information. This includes the backdoor version (we observed V2 and V3), access keys, endpoint address, the bucket\nname for Alibaba Cloud OSS, and a URL for downloading the utility sc.exe that is used for taking screenshots.\n\nFigure 17. The BPS backdoor global configuration variable\n\nThe backdoor communicates with the C&C server using the Socket.io protocol. The C&C communication is encrypted with AES ECB algorithm\nusing a hard-coded password, ZLIB compression, and base85 encoding.\n\nFigures 18 and 19 show how the malware sends the “join” event to initialize C&C communication and attach the victim’s encrypted data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. Encoded “join” event sent to\n\nthe C&C server\n\nFigure 19. Decoded “join” event sent to the C&C server. It’s important to note that\nattributes like IP address, computer and username, architecture, installed antivirus,\n\nand geolocation are included.\n\nThe BIOPASS RAT malware registers three custom Socket.io event handlers:\n\n1.   The “notice” handler is used for checking the connection with the C&C server. The backdoor regularly sends a “notice” event to the server\nand records the timestamp if it also receives a “notice” event as the response. If the malware doesn’t receive any “notice” event within a hardcoded threshold period, it will restart.\n\n2.   The “set key” handler is used for accepting the victim ID, a random string with six characters, assigned by the C&C server. It will be\nattached in each of commands sent from the server and will also be used as the folder name on a cloud storage service to save the stolen data.\nThe victim ID will be stored in the “bps.key” file.\n\n3.   The “accept task” handler is the main handler used to process the command sent from the C&C server and to return the execution result.\nWe share more details of each command in the next section.\n\nAfter the malware joins the C&C server, the server will assign a victim ID with “set key” event and send multiple “accept task” events with the\ncommands “ScreenShot”, “SnsInfo”, “PackingTelegram”, “GetBrowsersCookies”, “GetBrowsersLogins”, “GetBrowsersHistories”, and\n“GetBrowsersBookmarks” to instruct the malware to collect private data from the victim.\n\n## A closer look at the BIOPASS RAT commands\n\nThe BIOPASS RAT malware implements multiple commands, most of which are self-explanatory. A summary of commands is listed in Table 2,\nwhile additional details of some commands are explained in the following section.\n\nCommand Behavior\n\nCompress_Files Compresses specified files or directories to a ZIP archive\n\nDecompress_File Extracts files from a specified ZIP archive\n\nAutoRun Creates a scheduled task for persistence\n\nCloseEverything Kills the Everything process with the command “TASKKILL /F /IM Everything.exe”\n\nOpenEverything [Downloads and runs Everything from voidtools](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/)\n\nCloseFFmpegLive [Kills the FFmpeg process with the command “TASKKILL /F /IM ffmpeg.exe”](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)\n\nOpenFFmpegLive Downloads and runs FFmpeg (for screen video capture)\n\nDeleteFile Deletes files or directories at specified locations\n\nCreateDir Creates a directory at a specified location\n\n|Command|Behavior|\n|---|---|\n|Compress_Files|Compresses specified files or directories to a ZIP archive|\n|Decompress_File|Extracts files from a specified ZIP archive|\n|AutoRun|Creates a scheduled task for persistence|\n|CloseEverything|Kills the Everything process with the command “TASKKILL /F /IM Everything.exe”|\n|OpenEverything|Downloads and runs Everything from voidtools|\n|CloseFFmpegLive|Kills the FFmpeg process with the command “TASKKILL /F /IM ffmpeg.exe”|\n|OpenFFmpegLive|Downloads and runs FFmpeg (for screen video capture)|\n|DeleteFile|Deletes files or directories at specified locations|\n\n\n-----\n\n|ShowFiles|Gets the disk partition or lists a specified directory with detailed information, including file name, file path, size, create time, and time of modification|\n|---|---|\n|Download_File|Downloads a URL and saves the file to a specified location|\n|Upload_File|Uploads the victim’s files to cloud storage|\n|uUninstall|Kills the BIOPASS RAT process and deletes installed files.|\n|CloseObsLive|Kills the OBS process with command “TASKKILL /F /IM obs64.exe”|\n|Open_Obs_Live|Downloads OBS Studio and starts live streaming|\n|ProcessList|Lists processes on the victim’s environment and their process identifier (PID)|\n|KillProcess|Kills the process specified by PID with the TASKKILL command|\n|ScreenShot|Takes a screenshot and uploads it to cloud storage|\n|Shell|Executes commands or scripts (subcommands with prefixes subprocess, python, noreturn, getversion, restart)|\n|SnsInfo|Lists QQ, WeChat, and Aliwangwang directories|\n|InstallTcpdump|Downloads and installs the tcpdump tool|\n|PackingTelegram|Compresses and uploads Telegram's “tdata” directory to cloud storage|\n|CloseProxy|Kills frpc process with command “TASKKILL /F /IM frpc.exe”|\n|OpenProxy|Downloads and installs the frp proxy client in the “%PUBLIC%” folder|\n|OpenVnc|Downloads and installs jsmpeg-vnc tool in the “%PUBLIC%/vnc/” folder|\n|CloseVnc|Kills the VNC process with the command “TASKKILL /F /IM vdwm.exe”|\n|GetBrowsersCookies|Decrypts the cookie file of the browser and uploads it to cloud storage|\n|GetBrowsersLogins|Decrypts the login file of the browser and uploads it to cloud storage|\n|GetBrowsersHistories|Uploads the history file of the browser to cloud storage|\n|GetBrowsersBookmarks|Uploads the bookmark file of the browser to cloud storage|\n\n\nTable 2. BIOPASS RAT commands\n\nOpenEverything\n\n[The malware downloads “Everything” files if the “Everything” binary is not found in the “%TEMP%” folder. It then changes the port number of](https://www.voidtools.com/)\nthe HTTP server inside the configuration file and starts the Everything process, which will open an HTTP server to allow the threat actor to\naccess the file system of the victim.\n\nOpenFFmpegLive\n\n[The malware downloads FFmpeg files if they are not found on the victim’s machine. Next, it starts the FFmpeg process to monitor the victim’s](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)\n[desktop via RTMP live streaming to the cloud. The malicious actor can then connect to the relevant RTMP address to watch the streaming.](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/44304.html)\n\nOpen_Obs_Live\n\n[The malware downloads OBS Studio files if the OBS folder and config file are not found in the root directory. It writes the basic config and RTMP](https://obsproject.com/)\nconfig of OBS and then starts the OBS process to monitor the victim’s desktop using RTMP live streaming to the cloud. The malicious actor can\nconnect to the relevant RTMP address to watch the streaming.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. The script used to download OBS Studio, prepare the configuration, and start the process\n\n## ScreenShot\n\n[The malware downloads the screenshot-cmd tool if it is not found in the root directory. It takes a screenshot of the victim’s screen with the tool](https://code.google.com/archive/p/screenshot-cmd/)\nand saves it as a PNG file with a random number as the file name. The malware will then upload the screenshot files to cloud storage.\n\nShell\n\nThe malware uses a number of methods to execute the shell command or script. The “Shell” command instructs the malware to execute a\ncommand using the Python function “win32api.ShellExecute” and to return the result to a C&C server, applying a 60-second timeout for\ncommand execution.\n\nIf the command has one of the following prefixes, it will perform a specific behavior:\n\n1.   “subprocess”: executes a system command using the Python function “subprocess.Popen”.\n\n2.   “python”: executes a Python script delivered with the command.\n\n3.   “noreturn”: executes a system command using the Python function “win32api.ShellExecute” without waiting for the result.\n\n4.   “getversion”: returns the string “20200202”.\n\n5.   “restart”: kills the process itself and restarts it via scheduled malicious tasks.\n\nSnsInfo\n\nThe command will list the installation directory of several popular instant messaging applications including WeChat, QQ, and Aliwangwang and\nreturn this information to the C&C server. Figures 21 and 22 show the result of running “SnsInfo” command to enumerate messengers.\n\nNone of the Chinese messenger applications has been installed on our testing machine,\nwhich explains the result seen in the images.\n\nGetBrowsersCookies\n\nThis command is designed to steal cookie information from browsers. It will read the\n“Local State” file to grab the AES secret key of Google Chrome-based browsers.\nDepending on the different argument “type” delivered with the command, it performs\ndifferent behaviors.\n\nFigure 21. Encoded SUBMIT RESULT command sent to\n\n\n[If the value of the “type” argument is “Chrome”, it will use the AES secret key or DPAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dpapi/)\n(for Chrome versions before 80) to decrypt the cookie file. The decrypted result will be\nsent to the C&C server.\n\n\nC&C server\n\nFigure 22. Decoded SUBMIT\n\nRESULT command sent to\n\nC&C server\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. The script to decrypt Chrome’s file with AES or DPAPI decryption\n\nIf the value of the “type” argument is “File”, it will directly upload the cookie file to cloud storage. The command that we received showed that\nthe targeted browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge Beta, 360 Chrome, QQ Browser, 2345 Explorer, Sogou Explorer, and 360 Safe\nBrowser.\n\nFigure 24. Code showing the command to target Sogou Explorer\n\n## GetBrowsersLogins\n\nThis command has a nearly identical function to “GetBrowsersCookies”, although it targets a browser’s “Login Data” files instead.\n\nAdditional Findings on BIOPASS RAT\n\nAlthough these are not implemented inside the BIOPASS RAT malware, we have observed two additional plug-ins that are written in Python\n(“getwechatdb” and “xss_spoof”) and were deployed by the threat actor to a victim who had been infected with Cobalt Strike.\n\nThe script “getwechatdb” is used for exfiltrating the chat history from the WeChat Windows client. The script will detect the version of the\ninstalled WeChat client and grab the decryption key and the user ID. The predefined list of offsets is used to locate where the decryption key and\nthe user ID are embedded. The list supports 36 different versions of memory offsets for the message client.\n\nThe script will then upload database files inside the WeChat folder including “MicroMsg.db” to cloud storage. These database files are used for\nsaving the chat history. Finally, the script will print out the client ID and the decryption key that allows the malicious actors to decrypt the stolen\ndatabase files of the chat history.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. A predefined list of memory offset intended to grab information from different versions of WeChat\n\nFigure 26. The script used to exfiltrate WeChat chat database files\n\nThe other plug-in, “xss_spoof”, is an archive that contains multiple Python scripts. The scripts are designed for web server infection via a crosssite scripting (XSS) attack. This plug-in can inject malicious scripts into the response of the victim’s web server by leveraging the WinDivert\npackage, which is used to sniff and manipulate the network traffic on Windows.\n\nThe scripts intercept HTTP GET requests that are sent to port 80. An “ignore” list is used to filter the file extensions of URLs to avoid\nmanipulating resources that are not JavaScript or HTML. The script then modifies the original JavaScript or HTML content and delivers it to\nwebsite visitors.\n\nFigure 27. The JavaScript payload used to replace the original script of compromised websites\n\nThe delivered script is almost the same as the malicious script previously discussed in the section on the watering hole attack. The script\nperforms checks by scanning localhost to determine if the machine is infected by BIOPASS RAT while showing the fake updated webpages. It is\nlikely that the malicious actors compromised the web servers first and then ran “xss_spoof” for propagation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 28. The main script used to manipulate traffic with WinDivert\n\n## Potential links with the Winnti group\n\nWe have found several connections between BIOPASS RAT and the Winnti Group:\n\n1.   We discovered that many BIOPASS RAT loader binaries were signed with two valid certificates. However, these certificates are likely stolen\n[from game studios from South Korea and Taiwan. It is well known that the Winnti Group has previously used stolen certificates from game](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\nstudios to sign its malware.\n\nCertificate Thumbprint Valid From Valid To\n\nEFB70718BC00393A01694F255A28E30E9D2142A4 12:00 a.m., Jan. 2, 2019 11:59 p.m., Mar. 2, 2021\n\n8CE020AA874902C532B9911A4DCA8EFFA627DC80 12:00 a.m., Sept. 6, 2018 11:59 p.m., Oct. 5, 2021\n\nTable 3. Information from the stolen certificates\n\n2.   While checking the stolen certificates, we found a server-side variant of the Derusbi malware sample\n(e5fdb754c1a7c36c288c46765c9258bb2c7f38fa2a99188a623182f877da3783) that was signed with the same stolen certificate.\n\n[Derusbi is known to be used by multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The server-side variant has also been noted to be used as a](https://securelist.com/i-am-hdroot-part-2/72356/)\nmalware loader by the Winnti Group.\n\n3.   We found an interesting Cobalt Strike loader (a7e9e2bec3ad283a9a0b130034e822c8b6dfd26dda855f883a3a4ff785514f97) that embeds a\nURL that leads to the BIOPASS RAT loader. However, the URL is unused and was likely left inside the loader as a mistake. This file has also been\n[mentioned in a recent report that connects it to an attack on a major certification authority (CA) in Mongolia.](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/backdoored-client-from-mongolian-ca-monpass/)\n\nThe Cobalt Strike loader, which has a PDB string “C:\\Users\\test\\Desktop\\fishmaster\\x64\\Release\\fishmaster.pdb”, connects to the C&C server\n[“download[.]google-images[.]ml”. The domains and the PDB string have been mentioned in a recent report and have been attributed to the](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf)\nWinnti Group.\n\nWhile these connections allow us to link the malware to the Winnti Group, the different targets between BIOPASS RAT and the current\noperations by Winnti’s that we are tracking makes associating the two more difficult.\n\n## BIOPASS RAT highlights the importance of downloading from trusted sources\n\nBIOPASS RAT is a sophisticated type of malware that is implemented as Python scripts. It possesses many features, such as the ability to use\nscheduled tasks as a method of maintaining persistence in the infected system. The malware abuses publicly available tools and cloud services\nfor its malicious behavior. Notably, a large number of features were implemented to target and steal the private data of popular web browsers\nand instant mes\\sengers that are primarily used in Mainland China.\n\nGiven that the malware loader was delivered as an executable disguised as a legitimate update installer on a compromised website, we advise\nusers to be careful with regard to the applications that they download. As much as possible, it is recommended to download apps only from\ntrusted sources and official websites to avoid being compromised by attacks such as the one discussed here.\n\n[Organizations can also help protect their end users by implementing security solutions that provide a multilayered defense system that helps](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html)\nwith detecting, scanning, and blocking malicious URLs.\n\nNote that we’ve submitted an abuse report to Alibaba, but we have yet to receive feedback at the time of publication.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nSHA256 Filename Note An\n\n|Certificate Thumbprint|Valid From|Valid
