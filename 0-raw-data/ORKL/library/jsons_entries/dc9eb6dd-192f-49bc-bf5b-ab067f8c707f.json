The company generated $1.4 billion in revenue for 2019 and employs over 4,300\npeople.\n\nLast week, FreightWaves [reported that Forward Air suffered a cyberattack that forced them](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/news-alert-forward-air-suffering-significant-it-outage)\nto take their systems offline to prevent the attack's spread. Forward Air later confirmed this\nattack in a statement to BleepingComputer.\n\n\"On December 15, Forward Air detected an IT security incident that impacted the\nfunctionality of certain computer systems. Per our information security protocols, we\nimmediately took our systems offline, notified law enforcement and engaged several third\n\n-----\n\nparty experts to assist us in conducting an internal investigation. Our IT team is working\ndiligently to restore the affected systems and services and bring them back online as soon\nas possible,\" Forward Air shared in a statement to BleepingComputer.\n\nAccording to FreightWaves, the attack has led to business disruption as the paperwork\nrequired to release freight from customs was stored on the shutdown systems and is not\navailable.\n\nAt this time, Forward Air's website is down and just displays a message about the \"IT\nsecurity incident\" and that the site is down while they restore affected systems.\n\n**Forwardair.com outage**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n## New Hades ransomware operation is responsible.\n\nSources have told BleepingComputer today that Forward Air suffered a cyberattack by a\nnew ransomware operation known as Hades.\n\n_Update 12/21/20 6:37 PM EST: After we published our story, Forward Air filed a Form 8-K_\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing that they suffered a ransomware\nattack.\n\n\"On December 15, 2020, Forward Air Corporation (the “Company”) detected a ransomware\nincident impacting its operational and information technology systems, which has caused\nservice delays for many of its customers. Promptly upon its detection of the incident, the\n\n\n-----\n\nCompany initiated response protocols, launched an investigation and engaged the services\nof cybersecurity and forensics professionals. The Company has also engaged with the\n[appropriate law enforcement authorities,\" the Form 8-K states.](https://docoh.com/filing/912728/0000912728-20-000183/FWRD-8K)\n\nThe Hades ransomware gang behind this attack began operating about a week ago in\nhuman-operated attacks against the enterprise.\n\nWhen encrypting a victim, it will create a ransom note named 'HOW-TO-DECRYPT\n[extension].txt' that resembles notes used by the REvil ransomware group, as can be seen\nbelow.\n\n**Hades ransom note**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nEnclosed in the ransom notes is a Tor site URL that is unique to each victim. This URL\nbrings you to a Tor site containing information about the attack and a Tox messenger\naddress that victims can use to contact the attackers, which is the same for all victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hades Tor site**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nWhen we reached out via Tox to the ransomware actors, they were unwilling to provide any\ninformation about their attacks. They did, though, share a Twitter account whose name\nindicates they will use it to leak files stolen during attacks.\n\nIt is not known how much money is demanded to recover files, and a sample of the\nransomware has not been found.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Forward Air](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/forward-air/)\n[Hades](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hades/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
