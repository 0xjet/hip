    "plain_text": "# Cobalt hackers executed massive, synchronized ATM heists across Europe, Russia\n\n**[helpnetsecurity.com/2016/11/22/cobalt-hackers-synchronized-atm-heists/](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2016/11/22/cobalt-hackers-synchronized-atm-heists/)**\n\nNovember 22, 2016\n\nA criminal group dubbed Cobalt is behind synchronized ATM heists that saw machines\nacross Europe, CIS countries (including Russia), and Malaysia being raided simultaneously,\nin the span of a few hours. The group has been active since June 2016, and their latest\nattacks happened in July and August.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Setup and execution of the attacks\n\nThe group sent out spear-phishing emails – purportedly sent by the European Central Bank,\nthe ATM maker Wincor Nixdorf, or other banks – to the target banks’ employees. The emails\n[delivered attachments containing an exploit for an MS Office vulnerability.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/vulnerability.jsp?bid=73995)\n\n“If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, the malicious module will inject a payload\nnamed Beacon into memory. Beacon is a part of Cobalt Strike, which is a multifunctional\nframework designed to perform penetration testing. The tool enables perpetrators to deliver\nthe payload to the attacked machine and control it,” the researchers explained in a recently\nreleased paper.\n\nAdditional methods and exploits were used to assure persistence in the targeted machines,\nto gain domain administrator privileges, and ultimately to obtain access to the domain\ncontroller. From that vantage point, they were able to obtain Windows credentials for all client\nsessions by using the open source Mimikatz tool.\n\nThe attackers would ultimately gain control over a number of computers inside the bank’s\nlocal network. Some of them are connected to the Internet, and others not, but the latter\nwould receive instructions from the central Cobalt Strike console through the former.\n\n“After the local network and domain are successfully compromised, the attackers can use\nlegitimate channels to remotely access the bank, for example, by connecting to terminal\nservers or via VPN acting as an administrator or a standard user,” the researchers noted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker have also installed a modified version of the TeamViewer remote access tool on\nthe compromised devices, just in case.\n\nOnce constant access was assured, the criminals searched for workstations from which they\ncould control ATMs. They would load the ATMs with software that allows them to control\ncash dispensers.\n\nThe final strikes happened in a few hours on the same day, when money mules would go to\nthe targeted ATMs, send an SMS with the code identifying the ATM to a specific phone\nnumber, the criminals would make it spit out all the cash, and the mules would leave with it.\n\n## Some interesting things about the gang’s capabilities\n\nThe Cobalt gang uses a number of legitimate, open and closed source tools – Cobalt Strike\n[(a tool for penetration testing), Mimikatz, SDelete (a free tool available on the Microsoft](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nwebsite that deletes files beyond recovery), and TeamViewer.\n\n“Once an ATM is emptied, the operator launches the SDelete program, which removes les\nused with a special algorithm, which prevents information from being recovered. Thereafter,\nthe ATM restarts,” the researchers explained. “In addition, operators disable the bank’s\ninternal servers involved in the attack using the MBRkiller malware that removes MBR\n(master boot record). Such a careful approach significantly complicates further investigation.”\n\nThe ATM manipulation software also contains code that allows it to record a log containing\ninformation about the banknotes dispensed – the gang obviously does not trust the money\nmules to correctly report the amount that was stolen from each ATM.\n\n## Which banks were hit?\n\nIB Group did not name them, but only noted that they are based in Armenia, Belarus,\nBulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania,\nRussia, Spain, the UK and Malaysia.\n\nAccording to [Reuters, Diebold Nixdorf and NCR, the world’s two largest ATM makers, have](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-banks-atms-idUSKBN13G24Q)\nprovided banks with information on how to prevent or at least minimize the impact of these\nattacks.\n\nIt is unknown how much money the group was able to steal.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
