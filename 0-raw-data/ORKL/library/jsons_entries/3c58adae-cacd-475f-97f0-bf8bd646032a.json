    "plain_text": "# Who is Mr Gu?\n\n**intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/10/who-is-mr-gu**\n\nintrusiontruth January 10, 2020\n\nIn our previous articles we identified thirteen companies that this blog knows are a front for\nAPT activity in Hainan. Following further analysis, we noticed a close association between\nthese Hainan front companies and the academic world. Multiple job adverts for the the\ncompanies are posted on university websites. Hainan Xiandun even appears to operate from\nthe Hainan University Library!\n\n\n-----\n\nHainan Xiandun registration details showing Hainan University library as its address\n**Gu Jian**\n\nThis company summary for Hainan Xiandun also provides a contact number: 13907545649.\nCross-referencing this partial phone number and Hainan, we identified Gu Jian (顾剑) is a\nComputer Science specialist at Hainan University. We found Gu’s name and phone number\nin this [list of projects on the Hainan University website.](http://www.hainanu.edu.cn/upfile/2010/keyan_20103493419-0.xls)\n\nList of Hainan University project titles linking 13907545649 to Gu Jian\nHere is Gu’s CV:\n\nGu Jian’s CV\n[And here is his biography from his web page at Hainan University’s website showing his](http://hainanssp.dayainfo.com/publicResWarehouse/selectResWarehouseByAuthorCs?res_create_user_id=200804&unitId=1&currentPage=1)\nwork history and interests, including as a former member of the People’s Liberation Army.\n\n\n-----\n\nGu Jian’s University biography\n\n“[Gu Jian] worked as an educated youth, a PLA soldier, an officer of the Political\nDepartment of the Provincial Military Region, a senior engineer of a state-owned\nenterprise, and a Chinese employee (technical director) of the French representative\noffice of the French company BULL.”\n\nGu Jian, a Professor in the Information Security Department and former member of the PLA\nis now the contact person for an APT front company which itself is linked to twelve other front\n_companies._\n\n**Hainan Xiandun Information Security Technology Competition**\n\nMr Gu is closely involved with Hainan Xiandun. In September 2013, he posted on the Hainan\nUniversity online forum about “The 2013 Hainan Network Information Security Technology\nCompetition” saying that teams could enter and that there would be prizes. The posting\nindicated that more detail was available on xdaqjs[dot]com. This domain is an acronym from\nthe Pinyin for Xiandun Security Competition Final (XianDun AnQuan JueSai – 仙盾安全决\n赛).\n\n\n-----\n\nThese links between Hainan Xiandun and Hainan University are seen again on the internal\nHainan University discussion forum. A user name “xdaqjs” posted to encourage students\nfrom any specialism and in any year with an interest in cyber security to attend a session\nhosted by Hainan Xiandun in the auditorium of the information technology department on 9\nSeptember 2013.\n\nThe [competition ran again in 2016, still using xdaqjs as a title.](http://dy.163.com/v2/article/detail/C1GGTTB30514B0EQ.html)\n\n**xdaqjs[dot]com**\n\nMr Gu was not just advertising this competition for a company that he was involved in, he\nregistered the domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Password cracking**\n\nA link to the malicious activity of the front companies can be seen when reading discussion\n[forums about xdaqjs. Individuals purporting to represent the site offered large sums of money](https://bbs.pediy.com/thread-178283-1.htm)\nto people with password cracking skills outside the ordinary range of dictionary attacks and\nbrute force.\n\nIndividuals from xdaqjs offer money for password cracking skills\nThe opening post reveals that Mr Gu is seeking new ways of cracking passwords. The poster\nis aware of the common techniques, for example brute force or dictionary attacks, but is\nseeking new alternatives.\n\nWhat makes this interaction increasingly strange though, is that a student posting on this\nthread said that Mr Gu is inexplicably wealthy and is offering a large amount of money to\npeople able to provide new and inventive ways of cracking passwords. The original text is\ntelling:\n\n“Haha, I only want to know are these things actually crackable… From what I know about our\nteacher, he doesn’t waste his words. Our teacher says if no-one can crack it this time, then\nhe’ll increase the money on offer, 200,000, 300,000, 500,000 RMB.\n\nP.S. Believe it or not, our teacher has a lot of money…”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mr Huang**\n\nThe Dean of Mr Gu’s faculty is CCP member Huang Mengxing (黄梦醒). The questions we\nshould ask are: How well does Huang know Gu? Does he know about his department’s\nsupport for front companies for APT activity?\n\nMost importantly, if he knew then should he have stopped it?\n\n**In summary, Gu Jian, a former member of the PLA is an academic specialising in**\n**Information Security at Hainan University. He is also listed as the contact person for**\n**Hainan Xiandun, one of a network of front companies for APT activity.**\n\n\n-----",
