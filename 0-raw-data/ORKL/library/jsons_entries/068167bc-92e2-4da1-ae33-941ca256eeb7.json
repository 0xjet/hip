This is problematic, as BEC\nand its derivates, such as vendor email compromise (VEC) and invoice fraud, are the\n[largest categories of malicious activity in terms of monetary losses. In 2021, victims lost an](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-biggest-cyber-crime-threat-is-also-the-one-that-nobody-wants-to-talk-about/)\n[estimated $2.4 billion to BEC scams, totaling more than a third of all cybercrime losses](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf)\n($6.9 billion) and causing more losses than ransomware attacks, according to FBI\nestimates.\n\nThe widespread use of ransomware with the use of data disclosures (together sometimes\nknown as double extortion) has made sensitive corporate data highly available on the\ncriminal underground, with such data available for free or a fee to any threat actor. The data\n\n\n-----\n\nis a rich source of information for criminals who can easily weaponize it for secondary BEC\nattacks. This is especially relevant, as markets like Genesis and underground services\navailable in multiple high-end forums allow malicious users to purchase credentials for as\nlittle as $10 that provide access to genuine corporate email accounts. This helps attackers\nlaunch a BEC attack from an internal, genuine email address as opposed to a spoofed\naddress an attacker would otherwise use. Such use of genuine email addresses makes it\nincreasingly difficult for businesses and consumers to distinguish malicious activity from\ngenuine business operations.\n\n**Data disclosures**\n\nThe Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) team analyzed data from ransomware leak\nsites and compared its own research with that of external entities. ACTI examined the top\n20 most active dedicated leak sites, or dark web name-and-shame sites, measured by\nnumber of featured victims, between July 2021 and July 2022 (Exhibit 1). Within this period,\nACTI observed an estimated 4,026 victims (corporate, non-governmental organizations and\ngovernmental entities) on various ransomware groups’ dedicated leak sites.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n**Exhibit 1: Breakdown of data leak victims on dedicated leak sites**\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n\n-----\n\nAn estimated 91% of the 4,026 victims on dedicated leak sites incurred subsequent data\ndisclosures of various degrees, with the remaining victims not having experienced an\nobserved data leak. The notion that nearly all ransomware collectives, regardless of size,\nengage in double-extortion techniques indicates that malicious actors disclose very large\namounts of data, making that data available to anyone.\n\nACTI has found that dedicated leak sites most commonly provide financial data, followed by\nemployee and client personally identifiable information, and communication documentation.\nThese findings echo the observations of other researchers. ACTI also found that whenever\nan exfiltrated batch of data includes at least one of the above categories, the group that\nexfiltrated it consistently highlights the data type on its dedicated leak site. This boasting\nshowcases the perceived high value of such data and the propensity for the disclosure of\nsuch data. The highlighted section of Exhibit 2 provides an example of such promotion from\nRedAlert’s dedicated leak site.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n**Exhibit 2: Exfiltrated data types RedAlert noted on its dedicated leak site**\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n**Data indexing improves malicious usability**\n\nThe emergence of vast quantities of leaked data enhances a BEC actor's ability to target an\norganization by strengthening the BEC attack chain while also undermining traditional\ndefenses. ACTI assesses that the utility of dedicated leak site data has historically been\nlimited by the difficulty of interacting with large quantities of poorly stored data. This has\nbeen cumbersome, time-consuming, and costly for actors, thereby creating a natural barrier\nfor widespread abuse of the data, until now. ACTI found that several groups are making\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir dedicated leak site data more accessible by moving away from Tor domains and\ntoward publicly accessible sites. Moreover, sites like ALPHV and Industrial Spy offer\nsearchable indexed data, including sensitive data such as employee personally identifiable\ninformation and financial data like that outlined in red in Exhibit 3. Because it facilitates and\nspeeds access, this searchability is enormously beneficial to malicious actors seeking to\nweaponize data for secondary attacks.\n\nIndustrial Spy emerged as a data-selling marketplace in April 2022. It discloses some data\nfreely and sells individual files for as little as one dollar. The operators actively organize and\nname folders with labels that reflect their content to make finding specific files easy. Folder\n4 of Exhibit 3 (highlighted to showcase data indexing and obfuscated to protect potential\nvictims) is an example of this.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n**Exhibit 3: Sensitive data disclosed on the Industrial Spy marketplace**\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nMoreover, the Industrial Spy marketplace now operates a working search function. ACTI\ntests found that threat actors can search for specific files such as employee data, invoices,\nscans, contracts, legal documents, email messages, and more. This search function also\nenables actors to hunt for data from specific industries and countries, for example, USbased engineering or insurance organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly, the ALPHV ransomware group has created an indexed and searchable database\nof its leaks (Exhibit 4, again obfuscated to protect potential victims), allowing anyone to\nsearch the ALPHV database for terms including employee names, contract data, invoices,\nleadership, and more. This facilitates locating data necessary to enrich a social engineering\nploy. ACTI found \"about 10,000\" results when searching for \"invoice\" across indexed\ndisclosures, as well as 6,000 results for \"CFO,\" 10,000 for \"accounting,\" and 10,000 for\n\"email,\" showcasing the large amount of information available.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n**Exhibit 4: Indexed, searchable data hosted on ALPHV's dedicated leak site**\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nACTI assesses that the indexed and searchable databases like these help actors more\nefficiently acquire specific data versus downloading bulk data and hoping to find desired\ninformation.\n\n**Augmenting the BEC attack chain and defeating defenses**\n\nAlthough all types of cybercriminals can benefit from obtaining sensitive corporate data, it is\nespecially helpful for those conducting attacks based on social engineering. ACTI assesses\nwith high confidence that the availability of sensitive corporate data makes it increasingly\ndifficult for employees of victim organizations to spot fake communications and avoid such\nattacks because actors can base their attacks on genuine documents from the victim\norganization. ACTI found that the most disclosed data types overlap with the data types\nmost useful for conducting BEC and VEC attacks: financial, employee, and communication\ndata, and operational documents (Exhibit 5). The “other” category includes marketing and\ntraining materials, etc. of less value to cybercriminals than the distinct data types above.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 5: Degree of overlap between available disclosed data and such data’s usefulness**\nfor BEC and VEC attacks\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nACTI assesses that the primary factor driving an increased threat of BEC and VEC attacks\nstemming from double-extortion leaks is the availability of data like that described above.\nThis data is most useful during the reconnaissance and social engineering phases,\nparticularly as the latter pertains to sending false invoices.\n\nDuring the reconnaissance phase, malicious actors may study and weaponize the vast\ntroves of sensitive internal company data, which provide rich sources of social engineering\ninformation. This includes insurance data, salary information, lease agreements, bank\nreconciliations, and more (highlighted in Exhibit 6).\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 6: Internal data available on the Industrial Spy data extortion marketplace**\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nThe social engineering phase is the most important and traditionally the most difficult part of\na BEC attack and the phase that benefits most from dedicated leak site data. BEC attacks\nare inherently based on social engineering, with few technical roadblocks. This makes good\nsocial engineering the single most important determinant of a successful BEC attack. Highquality, well-crafted, and accurately scoped social engineering ploys give threat actors the\nability to have higher success. Such data is a rich source of information about a victim\ncompany’s day-to-day operations. A threat actor can increase the likelihood that a social\nengineering ploy will succeed by determining a target’s internal language, such as\ncompany-specific acronyms and phrases, allowing threat actors to avoid use of nonstandard company language, a tell-tale sign of fraud. Dedicated leak site data further\nreduces the likelihood of a target discovering a social engineering ploy by allowing actors to\nbetter adhere to internal organizational pathways. For example, it facilitates following\ntypical, anticipated communication channels and command chains.\n\nFinally, malicious actors can use this data to improve the timing of an attack. Actors can\ninitiate a social engineering ploy when the targeted individual and organization are most\nvulnerable, such as during acquisitions or vendor contract renewals, while traveling, or\nwhen other information is available only through insider knowledge. For VEC attacks, these\neffects are even more powerful, given the large amounts of sensitive dumped data that is\nnormally shared only between a primary target and its vendors. Specifically, contractual\ndata, invoices, financial agreements, payment schedules, orders, and purchase histories\nare all abundantly available on dedicated leak sites, enabling actors to mimic a vendor more\nclosely than they could otherwise.\n\nThe final step of a BEC or VEC attack often involves sending a fraudulent invoice to a victim\nor a victim’s supplier. Dedicated leak site data often includes genuine invoices that actors\ncan easily alter for use in an attack. Exhibit 7 shows a genuine invoice ACTI found on the\nIndustrial Spy data extortion site, obfuscated to protect potential victims. After carrying out a\nwell-crafted social engineering campaign, an actor could change such an invoice’s\naccounting details (marked with a blue arrow) to an actor-controlled account and send the\nmodified invoice to the target.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 7: Genuine invoice that ACTI discovered on a dedicated leak site**\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n\n-----\n\nACTI found similar invoices in nearly all dumps across various dedicated leak sites. In\naddition, an ACTI search for invoices in July 2022 rendered more than 10,000 hits on two\nleak sites alone, showcasing the vast volumes of data available.\n\nBeyond enabling a threat actor to conduct a more sophisticated attack, this type of data\ncircumvents traditional socialengineering attack defenses.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe widespread disclosure of data as part of ransomware attacks has flooded the criminal\nunderground with sensitive data from corporate networks that practically anyone can view\nand obtain. The availability of the data has synergetic effects. First, operators can leverage\nthe data to augment and enrich entire BEC and VEC attack chains. Second, the data can\ncircumvent defenses that the industry has been promoting to protect against attacks based\non social engineering.\n\nThe availability of internal data also increases the risk of secondary attacks driven by but\nunrelated to initial ransomware events. Such risk extends beyond a primary ransomware\nattack victim to other organizations that do business with the victim or who operate within\nthe victim’s supply chain.\n\n**Mitigations**\n\nTo prevent BEC attacks, ACTI suggests that businesses and consumers:\n\nRemain skeptical of changes in payment plans, even from genuine invoices and\ntrusted vendors or suppliers.\nValidate invoice amounts through a communication medium that differs from the one\nthrough which an invoice was received.\nRemain extra vigilant against new invoices or communications regarding payments\nafter a data exfiltration event, whether that event occurred at one’s own company or at\na company within the same supply chain.\n\nTo prevent and mitigate socialengineering attacks, ACTI suggests that businesses and\nconsumers:\n\nCheck the source of each email and ensure email senders are genuine.\nLook up phone numbers to determine their legitimacy before returning unforeseen\ncalls and avoid providing sensitive data to unknown callers.\nLocate official website URLs rather than clicking on links within messages.\nUse multi-factor authentication to prevent or delay the success of an attack in which\nactors access passwords through social engineering.\nContinuously monitor critical systems.\nIdentify and protect critical assets.\nRegularly check SSL certificates\n\n\n-----\n\nMaintain a closed and controlled digital footprint; oversharing of personal details\nonline through social media offers criminals more information to work with.\nTrain employees to limit the amount of work information they share on social media\nplatforms and how to identify social engineering ploys.\n\nTo prevent and mitigate data extortion attacks, ACTI suggests that businesses and\nconsumers:\n\nLimit or avoid the exposure of internal corporate technical procedures and\ninfrastructure in presentations from third-party technology partners.\n\n**_Accenture Security is a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including_**\n_advanced cyber defense, applied cybersecurity solutions and managed security operations._\n_We bring security innovation, coupled with global scale and a worldwide delivery capability_\n_through our network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
