Executive Summary\n\nThis report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried out by a sophisticated operator, which we call Stealth\n**Falcon. The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents.**\nWe discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called \"The\nRight to Fight\" contacted Rori Donaghy. Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human\nRights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel.\nDonaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past,[1] and had recently published a\nseries of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.[2]\n\nCircumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. We traced digital artifacts used in\nthis campaign to links sent from an activist's Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under\ngovernment control. We also identified other bait content employed by this threat actor. We found 31 public tweets sent by\nStealth Falcon, 30 of which were directly targeted at one of 27 victims. Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to the\nUAE, based on their profile information (e.g., photos, \"UAE\" in account name, location), and at least six targets appeared to\nbe operated by people who were arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE government, in relation to\ntheir Twitter activity.\n\nThe attack on Donaghy - and the Twitter attacks - involved a malicious URL shortening site. When a user clicks on a URL\nshortened by Stealth Falcon operators, the site profiles the software on a user's computer, perhaps for future exploitation,\nbefore redirecting the user to a benign website containing bait content. We queried the URL shortener with every possible\nshort URL, and identified 402 instances of bait content which we believe were sent by Stealth Falcon, 73% of which\nobviously referenced UAE issues. Of these URLs, only the one sent to Donaghy definitively contained spyware. However,\nwe were able to trace the spyware Donaghy received to a network of 67 active command and control (C2) servers, suggesting\nbroader use of the spyware, perhaps by the same or other operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 2. Background\n\nRori Donaghy[3] is a London-based journalist who currently works for UK news organization Middle East Eye, a website that\ncovers news in the Middle East.[4] _Middle East Eye has recently published a series of articles about UAE foreign policy, based_\non leaked emails involving members of the UAE government. Previously, Donaghy led the Emirates Center for Human\nRights,[5] an organization he founded to \"promote the defence of human rights in the United Arab Emirates through building\n_strong relationships with the media, parliaments and other relevant organisations outside the UAE\".[6]_\n\n## 2.1. Political and Human Rights Situation in the UAE\n\nIn its most recent (2015) Freedom in the World ranking, Freedom House classified the UAE as \"not free,\" and noted that the\nUAE continues to \"suppress dissent\".[7] Human Rights Watch stated in its most recent (2016) country report, that the UAE has\n_\"continued to arbitrarily detain and in some cases forcibly disappear individuals who criticized the authorities\".[8] Amnesty_\nInternational says that UAE courts have \"accepted evidence allegedly obtained through torture\".[9]\n\nSpecifically in the online realm, there is evidence that the UAE government has previously conducted malware attacks against\ncivil society. At least three dissidents[10] including a journalist, and UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, were targeted\nin 2012 with Hacking Team spyware[11] by a Hacking Team customer in the UAE, apparently operating under the auspices of\nthe office of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan,[12] a son of the founder of the UAE, and now the UAE Deputy National\nSecurity Advisor.[13] The UAE client had a license from Hacking Team to concurrently infect and monitor 1100 devices.[14]\n\n**_Figure 2: Diagram of Stealth Falcon's known Targets Fake Personas and campaign Artefacts along with relevant_**\n\n\n-----\n\n# 3. The November 2015 Attack: An \"Invitation\"\n\n_This section describes an email attack against journalist Rori Donaghy. The operators used a Microsoft Word macro that_\n_installs a custom backdoor allowing operators to execute arbitrary commands on a compromised machine._\n\n## 3.1 Initial Attack Email\n\nIn November 2015, the journalist Donaghy received the following email message, purportedly offering him a position on a\npanel of human rights experts:\n\n**From:** the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org\n**Subject: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle East**\n\nMr. Donaghy,\n\nWe are currently organizing a panel of experts on Human Rights in the Middle East.\n\nWe would like to formally invite you to apply to be a member of the panel by responding to this email.\n\nYou should include your thoughts and opinions in response to the following article about what more David Cameron can be doing to help aid the Middle East.\n\n**http://aax.me/d0dde**\nThank you.\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\n\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nDonaghy was suspicious of the email, and forwarded it to us for analysis. We found that the link in the email\n(http://aax.me/d0dde) loaded a page containing a redirect to the website of Al Jazeera. Before completing the redirect, it\ninvoked JavaScript to profile the target's computer. We describe the profiling in detail in Section 3.1-3.3 below.\n\n## 3.2 Communication with the Operator\n\nOn our instruction, Donaghy responded to the email, asking for further information. The operators responded with the\nfollowing message:\n\n**From:** the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org\n**Subject: RE: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle East**\n\nMr. Donaghy,\n\nThank you for getting back to us. We are very interested in you joining our panel.\n\nThe information you requested is in the attached document.\n\nIn order to protect the content of the attachment we had to add macro enabled security.\n\nPlease enable macros in order to read the provided information about our organization.\n\nWe hope you will consider joining us.\nThank you.\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\n\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nBy chance, the attachment was identified as malicious and blocked by a program running in Donaghy's email account. We\ninstructed him to follow up and request that the operators forward the attachment via another method. Donaghy received the\nfollowing reply:\n\n**From:** the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org\n**Subject: RE: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle East**\n\nMr. Donaghy,\n\n\n-----\n\n**http://aax.me/a6faa**\n\nThe link has been password protected. The password is: right2fight\n\nIn order to protect the content of the attachment we also had to add macro enabled security.\n\nPlease enable macros in order to read the provided information about our organization.\n\nWe hope you will consider joining us.\nThank you.\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\n\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nThis second link (http://aax.me/a6faa) redirects to the following URL using an HTTP 302 redirect:\n\n**https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ujDNWMmg8pdG3AL/authenticate**\n\nThis is a password-protected link to a file shared on an ownCloud[15] instance. We obtained this file, and found it to be a\nMicrosoft Word document.\n\n## 3.3 The Malicious Document\n\nThe document is:\n\n**Filename: right2fight.docm**\n**MD5:    80e8ef78b9e28015cde4205aaa65da97**\n**SHA1:   f25466e4820404c817eaf75818b7177891735886**\n**SHA256:  5a372b45285fe6f3df3ba277ee2de55d4a30fc8ef05de729cf464103632db40f**\n\nWhen opened, the target is greeted with the following image, purporting to be a message from \"proofpoint,\" a legitimate\nprovider of security solutions for Office 365.[16] The image claims that \"This Document Is Secured\" and requests that the user\n_\"Please enable macros to continue.\"_\n\n**_Figure 3: Fake Proofpoint image in the malicious document sent to Donaghy_**\n\nIf the target enables macros, they are presented with the following document:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Document that Donaghy would have seen, had he enabled macros_**\n\nThe document purports to be from an organization called \"The Right To Fight,\" and asks the target Donaghy to open the link\nin the original email he received (the email containing the profiling URL). We believe that \"The Right To Fight\" is a fictitious\norganization, as their logo appears to be copied from an exhibition about \"African American Experiences in WWII\".[17]\n\nFurther, \"The Right to Fight\" has no discernable web presence.\n\n**_Figure 5: Logo from exhibition about African American experiences in WWII._**\n\n**3.3.1 Profiling**\n\nThe document attempts to execute code on the recipient's computer, using a macro. The macro passes a Base64-encoded\ncommand to Windows PowerShell, which gathers system information via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and\nattempts to determine the installed version of .NET by querying the registry (full script available in **Appendix A: Stage One**\n**PowerShell Command).**\n\n**3.3.2 Communication & Obtaining a Shell**\n\n\n-----\n\n, **g**\napparently deleted on November 30th 2015 (Donaghy received the malicious Word Document on November 24th 2015). A\nnew domain, adhostingcaches.com, was registered on December 3rd, which points to the same IP address. The deletion of\n**adhostingcache.com may reflect operator suspicion that the file received by Donaghy had been sent to security researchers.**\n\nThe server response is a PowerShell command that decodes and materializes an invocation of a Base64-encoded PowerShell\ncommand to disk as IEWebCache.vbs, and creates a scheduled task entitled \"IE Web Cache\" that executes the file hourly\n(full script available in Appendix B: Stage Two PowerShell Command).\n\n**IEWebCache.vbs runs a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which periodically POSTs a unique identifier to**\n**https://incapsulawebcache.com/cache/cache.nfo (via HTTPS without verifying the server certificate, and with a hardcoded**\nuser-agent header matching Internet Explorer 10.6). The script executes server responses as PowerShell commands,\nresponding back to the server with the exit status of, output of, or any exceptions generated by the commands.\n\nThis gives the operator control over the victim's computer, and allows the operator to install additional spyware or perform\nother activities. All commands and responses are encrypted using RC4 with a hardcoded key, and the encrypted message is\nprefixed with a hardcoded value.\n\nDespite some similarities in functionality to the Empire backdoor,[18] we were unable to identify any shared code, and we\nsuspect that the backdoor is custom-made.\n\n## 3.4. Technical Analysis: aax.me Browser Profiling\n\n_While aax.me has a public interface where anyone may shorten a link, aax.me only conducts browser profiling of individuals_\n_who click on links that are specially shortened by Stealth Falcon operators._\n\nIn November 2015, when we accessed the link in the second email that Donaghy received, http://aax.me/a6faa, we found\nthat it redirected directly to https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ujDNWMmg8pdG3AL/authenticate via an HTTP\n302 redirect. When we accessed the link in the first email that Donaghy received, http://aax.me/d0dde, the server responded\nwith the following page:\n\n<iframe src='redirect.php' height='1' width='1' border='0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0'\nunselectable='yes' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' onload='setTimeout(\"document.location\n=\\\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-human-rights151103070038237.html\\\"\", 20000)'></iframe><br><br><br><center><img src='loading.gif'><br>Loading the\nwebsite:<br><b>http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-human-rights151103070038237.html</b>.<br>This may take a few seconds.</center>\n\nThe page is apparently designed to redirect to an Al Jazeera op-ed after twenty seconds.[19] However, the URL is incorrect: the\nlast character of the filename should be a \"1\" instead of a \"7\". Therefore, an Al Jazeera 404 page is returned instead of the oped. It is possible that the use of \"7\" instead of \"1\" represents a transcription error on the part of the operators. When we\naccessed this same aax.me URL in March 2016, it redirected directly to the Al Jazeera URL (with typo) via an HTTP 302\nredirect.\n\nThe iframe, http://aax.me/redirect.php, reloads itself with a parameter \"inFr\" in its query string, to indicate whether the page\nhas been opened up inside a frame.\n\n<html><body><script type=\"text/javascript\">if(window!=window.top)\n{inFr=\"1\"}else{inFr=\"0\"}document.location=document.location+\"?inFr=\"+inFr;</script><noscript><img\nsrc=\"?jSc=0\"/></noscript></body></html>\n\nIf the page has not been opened up inside a frame (inFr=0), then a blank page is returned. If the page is opened inside a frame\n(inFr=1), as is the case here, then the following page is returned (we ommitted the PHPSESSID value):\n\n<html><head></head><body><div id='display' height='1' style='display:none;'></div><form id='statsPost'\naction='?stats=1' method='POST'><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"PHPSESSID\" value=\"\" /><input id='theData'\nname='theData' type='hidden' value='' /></form><script type='text/javascript' src='redirect.js'>\n</script></body></html>\n\nWe examined the referenced JavaScript file, http://aax.me/redirect.js. The file is designed to profile a user's system, perhaps\nto gather intelligence about potentially exploitable vulnerabilities The file has apparently not been updated since 7 May\n\n\n-----\n\nFor Internet Explorer, it attempts to create several instances of ActiveXObject to get the versions of Flash, Shockwave,\nJava, RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, and Microsoft Office (classified as either 2003, 2007, or 2010).\n\nFor non-Internet Explorer browsers, it attempts to get a list of enabled plugins from navigator.mimeTypes.\n\nFor all browsers, it captures the user agent, whether cookies are enabled, the OS, the size of the browser window, and\nthe timezone. It classifies browsers into different versions, denoted by letters, based on the existence and behavior of\ncertain JavaScript methods.\n\nThe script attempts to exploit an information leak in older versions of Tor Browser. We explore the technique used in\n**Section 3.5.**\n\nFor Windows browsers (except Opera, and versions of Internet Explorer before IE9), it sends a series of\nXMLHttpRequests to 127.0.0.1, which we believe are designed to deduce if the computer is running any one of several\nspecific antivirus programs. The code for this appears to be borrowed from the JS-Recon port scanning tool.[21] The\ncreator of JS-Recon presented the tool at BlackHat Abu Dhabi in 2010.[22] We explore such techniques in more detail in\n**Section 3.6.**\n\nWe were unfamiliar with the website aax.me, so we investigated it further. We found that the main page of aax.me purported\nto be a public URL shortening service, powered by YOURLS,[23] an open source PHP framework allowing anyone to set up\ntheir own URL shortening service. We are unable to ascertain whether the site actually uses any YOURLS code. We also\nnoted that the homepage contains a typo (\"Shortend [sic] URL\").\n\n**_Figure 6: Homepage of aax.me_**\n\nWe shortened a URL using the homepage, but found that clicking on the shortened URL did not trigger the loading of the\nintermediate page, http://aax.me/redirect.php. We also did not find the code for redirect.php or redirect.js in the public\ncode repository for YOURLS.[24] Thus, we deduced that this code was likely specially written by the operators, and the link\nsent to Donaghy was likely created by someone with administrator access to aax.me.\n\n## 3.5. Technical Analysis: aax.me Tor Deanonymization Attempt\n\n_The aax.me site appears to attempt to deanonymize users of Tor Browser. While the technique the operators used was out-of-_\n_date at the time we observed the attack, the attempted Tor deanonymization speaks to their motivations and potential targets._\n\nThe script first detects Tor Browsers by checking whether navigator.buildID is set to zero (all testing was conducted on\nEnglish, Windows builds of Tor Browser). Versions of Tor Browser before 2.3.25-12 (released on 13 August 2013) had their\nbuildID set to zero. This behavior was originally introduced in TorButton,[25] in support of the goal of making Tor users\nappear homogenous.[26] Current Tor Browser versions have navigator.buildID set to a different distinctive value,\n20000101000000.\n\nWhen the script detects a Tor Browser it attempts to deduce the version of Tor Browser by checking for the existence and\n\n\n-----\n\nusername, which may include the target s real name.\n\nThe bug in Tor Browser was first disclosed at Defcon 17, which took place in August 2009.[28] The bug was first fixed on on\n25 May 2012 in Tor Browser release 2.2.35-13.[29] The bug was, however, later reintroduced into Tor Browser on 18\nDecember 2013 with the release of Tor Browser 3.5, and subsequently fixed again in Tor Browser 3.6 on 29 April 2014.[30]\n\nHowever, unfortunately for the operators, they failed to update their profiling script to reflect Tor Browser's\n**navigator.buildID change (before the bug was reintroduced). Thus, the profiling script did not detect Tor Browsers with the**\nreintroduced bug as Tor Browsers, so it did not try to exploit them. Even if it had been updated to reflect the\nnavigator.buildID change, the version check in the Tor Browser exploitation code would also have to be updated to select the\nversions with the reintroduced bug for exploitation.\n\nThe version of Tor Browser (as determined by JavaScript checks) is submitted back to the server, along with the value of\n_navigator.oscpu (which reveals the version of the OS on which Tor Browser is running - e.g., the latest version of Tor Browser_\non OSX El Capitan reveals: \"Intel Mac OS X 10.11\"), navigator.vendor (which appears blank in the latest Tor Browser), and\nany data gathered about the installation path.\n\n## 3.6. Technical Analysis: aax.me Antivirus Profiling\n\n_Interestingly, aax.me also attempts to determine the presence of various antivirus products on a target's machine._\n\nWe expand on the probing of antivirus programs which we observed on aax.me, as we were unfamiliar with this technique.\nThe technique appears to work on any modern version of Windows, with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and IE/Edge\n(though, the profiling script excludes IE versions less than IE9 from the profiling, using the vertical tab test).[31] Specifically,\nthe script conducts GET XMLHttpRequests (one at a time) to 127.0.0.1/ on the following ports: 12993, 44080, 24961, 1110,\n6646, 6999, 30606. The script stops conducting these requests if it finds one request whose readyState is set to 4 less than\n20ms after the request was initiated (200ms for port 6646), and submits the number of this port to the server.\n\nThe latest versions of Internet Explorer/Edge, Chrome, and Firefox (except Tor Browser) will all perform these\nXMLHttpRequests to 127.0.0.1 on behalf of any site. Of course, the result of such a request will most likely not be available\nto the script, due to the same-origin policy, and likely absence of a CORS[32] header in the response. Indeed, the script does\nnot attempt to read the results of its requests. Rather, it leverages the fact that the web browser makes the status of the request\nsent available, via the readyState parameter of an XMLHttpRequest instance (1 approximately represents TCP SYN sent, and\n_4 represents HTTP response received or TCP connection terminated). For a closed port, Windows will issue an RST/ACK for_\neach SYN sent. However, it appears that Windows' TCP stack will not consider an outgoing connection it is initiating to be\nterminated until it has sent 3 SYNs, and received three corresponding RST/ACKs (or timeouts).\n\n**_Figure 7: Three RST/ACKs required until Windows considers outgoing TCP connection terminated_**\n\nWhen testing with a TCP connection from Windows to a remote host, we can clearly see that Windows transmits the second\nSYN ~500ms after the first RST/ACK, and the third SYN ~500ms after the second RST/ACK.\n\n**_Figure 8: Windows sends the next SYN 500ms after the latest RST/ACK_**\n\nThus, the readyState value for a request to a closed port on 127.0.0.1 will not be set equal to 4 until approximately 1000ms\nafter the request is issued. In summary, one can use this technique to distinguish between a closed port (readyState set to 4 at\naround 1000ms), an open port (readyState set to 4 before 1000ms), and a filtered port (readyState set to 4 long after\n1000ms).\n\n\n-----\n\np p g p g p g\ndetect. We verified that the latest version of Avast can be detected by this script, as it opens TCP port 12993, which is\nassociated with its Mail Shield component for scanning email traffic; port 6999 is opened by Trend Micro's tmproxy[33] which\nscans web and email traffic; port 1110 is used by Kaspersky[34] to scan web and email traffic; it appears that Avira's Web\n_Protection component for scanning web traffic used to open port 44080,[35] though we observed it opening 44081 instead; port_\n30606 appears to have been used by ESET to scan web and email traffic,[36] but we did not observe this port open while testing\nthe latest version of ESET; port 6646 may be used by McAfee, though we did not test this.[37]\n\nThe code for the port scanning appears to be adapted from the JS-Recon port scanning tool.[38] JS-Recon is a generic tool that\nenumerates all open ports on 127.0.0.1 in a range; it does not specifically target anti-virus programs. The scan_xhr and\n**check_ps_xhr functions in the aax.me profiling script are similar to the scan_ports_xhr and check_ps_xhr functions in JS-**\nRecon. The creator of JS-Recon seems to have first presented the tool at BlackHat Abu Dhabi in 2010.[39]\n\n**_Figure 9: Image from the author of JS-Recon showing how long WebSocket and XMLHttpRequest (\"COR\") connections_**\n\n**_remain in their initial readyState on Windows.[40]_**\n\nNote that this technique can be generalized to any remote content timing side channel (e.g, the onerror event for an Image).\nAdditionally, one can identify the presence of an open port on 127.0.0.1 that speaks HTTP without using timing information,\nand thus without the Windows TCP behavior assumption (e.g., by handling the onerror and oncomplete events of certain\ntypes of link elements).\n\nWe are unsure whether the purpose of the antivirus profiling is to identify potentially exploitable antivirus software running\non a target's computer, or for evasion of antivirus products. In December 2015, Google Security discovered a critical\nvulnerability in Avast's antivirus product, which involved a webpage sending HTTP requests to a port that Avast opens on\n127.0.0.1. Google Security demonstrated that the vulnerability allowed exfiltration of arbitrary files from a victim's disk.[41] In\nJanuary 2016, Google Security discovered a critical vulnerability in Trend Micro's antivirus product, which similarly involved\na web page sending HTTP requests to a port that Trend Micro opens on 127.0.0.1. Google Security demonstrated that the\nvulnerability allowed arbitrary command execution.\n\n# 4. The Case of the Fake Journalist\n\n_In the course of our investigation we scanned the e-mail of journalist Donaghy and found evidence that he had been contacted_\n_by a fictitious journalist, whom we linked to Stealth Falcon._\n\nWe scanned Donaghy's GMail account for any previous messages featuring links that redirected through aax.me. We\nidentified the following message from December 2013, purporting to be from a UK journalist named Andrew Dwight:\n\n**From:** andrew.dwight389@outlook.com\n**Subject: FW: Correspondence Request**\n\nGreetings Mr. Donaghy,\n\nI have been trying to reach you for comment and I am hoping that this e-mail reaches the intended recipient. My name is Andrew Dwight and I am currently writing a\nbook about my experiences in the Middle East. My focus is on human factors and rights issues in seemingly non-authoritarian regimes (that are, in reality, anything\nbut). I was hoping that I might correspond with you and reference some of your work, specifically this piece (http://goo.gl/60HAqJ), for the book. I'm quite impressed\nwith the way you articulate this complex issue for the masses, and hope to have a similar impact with my book.\n\nHappy New Year,\n\n\n-----\n\n2013 Huffington Post blog post authored by Donaghy. We did not observe any redirect.php behavior with this link; as of\nDecember 2015, the aax.me link directly served an HTTP 302 redirect to the Huffington Post (we omitted the date header\nbelow). However, it is possible that the link formerly exhibited redirect.php behavior:\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nDate:\nServer: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) mod_ssl/2.2.9 OpenSSL/0.9.8g\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny13\nLocation: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rori-donaghy/uae-94_b_3549671.html\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Type: text/html\n\nWe found that Donaghy had responded to this message shortly after receiving it, offering to meet in-person with Andrew in\nthe UK. Andrew responded several weeks later with the following:\n\n**From:** andrew.dwight389@outlook.com\n**Subject: RE: Correspondence Request**\n\nHello Rori,\n\nHappy New Year! I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. I was on a ski holiday in upstate New York for the New Year and just returned to my current\naccommodations in the city. I was due back sooner, but as you may know, the weather has not been agreeable here in the Eastern United States!\n\nI am currently situated in the US. while I complete my book to be closer to my publisher and editor. The book focuses on the various guises used by Middle Eastern\ncountries to demonstrate that they are providing equal and fair treatment with concern to human rights. I am working with several organizations in identifying cases that\nreveal their true lack of concern for liberty and personal freedoms. I'm using these cases as testimony about this under reported issue. Have you heard of a Swedish\norganization named Al Karama?\n\nThere website: http://en.alkarama.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1005&Itemid=74&slid=102\n\nI have spoken to one of their junior editors and I am hoping to obtain input from some of their sources as well.\n\nThis issue never gets any smaller does it? I hope that a few loud voices (and a well received book) can make a difference.\n\nCheers,\n\nAndrew\n\nWhile attempting to determine whether \"Andrew Dwight\" was a real person, we we found a Twitter profile, @Dwight389 for\nthe same persona, and that mentions the same address from which Donaghy received the email.\n\n**_Figure 10: Andrew Dwight's Twitter profile, @Dwight389, mentioning the email address that corresponded with Donaghy_**\n\n**_in 2013, andrew.dwight389@outlook.com_**\n\nWe found that this account messaged three UAE dissident accounts via Twitter mentions.

Al-Zaabi was acquitted on 23 June 2014\nof all charges including \"slander concerning the rulers of the UAE using phrases that lower their status, and accusing them of\noppression\" and \"disseminating ideas and news meant to mock and damage the reputation of a governmental institution,\" but,\naccording to information received from two UAE sources, Al-Zaabi is still imprisoned in the prisoners ward of a hospital. A\ncoalition of 13 human rights organizations including Amnesty International consider Al-Zaabi's ongoing detention to be\narbitrary, and without legal basis.[50] Amnesty International reported that \"a senior State Security Prosecution official\" told AlZaabi he would continue to be detained even if acquitted.[51]\n\nAl-Zaabi's brother, Dr. Ahmed Al-Zaabi, is one of the UAE94 detainees and is currently serving a 10 year prison sentence.\nAccording to a report by the Gulf Center for Human Rights, Ahmed was tortured in prison: his fingernails were pulled out,\nand he was \"beaten to the point he was left swollen, covered in bruises all over his body and with large amounts of blood in\n_his urine\".[52]_\n\n## 4.2. Another Target:Professor Abdullah Al-Shamsi\n\n_This section describes how the fake journalist persona contacted professor Abdullah Al-Shamsi, Vice Chancellor of the British_\n_University in Dubai._\n\n**_Figure 12: @Dwight389 sent a message on 9 May 2013 suggesting he had targeted @shamsiuae58_**\n\nProfessor Abdullah Al-Shamsi (@shamsiuae58) is the Vice Chancellor of the British University in Dubai.[53] He (Arabic\nname: Ø£.Ø¯.Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ù…ØÙ…Ø¯ Ø±ØÙ…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø§Ù…Ø³ÙŠ)[54] is signatory #79 (out of 133) to a\nMarch 2011 petition to the UAE government[55] for direct elections[56] (UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was arrested after\nsigning the same petition).[57] Al-Shamsi's father (Ù…ØÙ…Ø¯ Ø¨Ù† Ø±ØÙ…Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù…Ø±ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø´Ø§Ù…\nØ³ÙŠ) was appointed to, and chaired the first sessions of, the Federal National Council (FNC), a legislative advisory council\nthat is now an elected body. He called for more powers to be given to the FNC.[58]\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 13: @Dwight389 contacted @northsniper on 7 November 2013_**\n\nIn May 2015, five Qataris were sentenced (one present in the UAE to 10 years in prison, and four in absentia to life in prison),\nfor posting allegedly offensive pictures of the UAE Royal Family on three Twitter accounts and two Instagram accounts,[59]\n\nincluding @northsniper.[60] At trial, the prosecution accused the five of being agents of Qatar's State Security, and posting the\nallegedly offensive pictures as part of a \"military mission\" to \"show that Emiratis had offended their own leaders\".[61] The\n**@northsniper account is currently suspended. One Instagram account allegedly used by defendants in this case (@9ip) is**\nstill active, and still appears to display unflattering photoshopped images of the President, Crown Prince, and Founder of the\nUAE.[62]\n\n# 5. Stealth Falcon's Widespread Targeting of UAE Figures\n\n_This section describes how we identified additional Stealth Falcon victims and bait content, and traced Stealth Falcon's_\n_spyware to additional C2 servers._\n\nGiven Stealh Falcon's use of public Twitter mentions to contact individuals, we searched Google and Twitter for instances of\n**aax.me links. The links we found indicated that we could easily probe aax.me to get a comprehensive list of all currently**\nactive short URLs, and their corresponding long URLs. Our findings point to a UAE-focused operator, whose bait content\nand targets are linked to the Emirates. Furthermore, we were able to connect this attack to case from December 2012, where\nan anonymous UAE activist contacted us and claimed to have received a suspicious link from a Twitter account that was\npurportedly under government control.\n\n## 5.1. Public Targets and Links to Arrests\n\n_This section describes 24 Stealth Falcon Twitter targets we identified on the basis of them receiving an aax.me link in a_\n_Twitter mention._\n\nWe found aax.me links targeting 24 accounts, each of whom was mentioned in a tweet that also contained an aax.me\nshortened link. We were unable to get details about 17 of the accounts. Of the accounts we have been able to identify,\n**several individuals were subsequently arrested or convicted in absentia by the UAE Government in relation to their**\n**online activities.**\n\nThe following table outlines these cases, and notes arrests. For completeness, the table includes the cases from Section 4.14.3:\n\n|Handle|Targeting|Related Arrests / Convictions|Note|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|@omran83|14 January 201263|16 July 201264 (arrested)|UAE94 prisoner; serving 7 years in prison.65|\n|@weldbudhabi|5 August 2012;66 20 October 201267|14 December 201268 (arrested)||\n\n\n25 December 2013[70]\n**@intihakat** 5 August 2012[69]\n(convicted)\n\n\nQatari convicted in absentia; sentenced to 5 years in\nprison.\n\n\n-----\n\n**(** **)**\n12 December 2013[73]\n\n(arrested)\n\n\ny p p\n\n|@northsniper (Sec 4.3)|7 November 201374|18 May 201575 (convicted)|Five Qataris convicted; sentences ranged from 10 years to life in prison.|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|@71UAE|9 January 201276||Last tweeted 1 July 2013, a day before arrest of @bukhaledobaid.|\n|@kh_oz|10 January 201277||Likely son of @bukhaledobaid.78|\n|@shamsiuae58 (Sec 4.2)|9 May 201379||Signed 2011 pro-democracy petition that Ahmed Mansoor was arrested after signing.|\n|@newbedon|9 January 201280||Donaghy describes the account as \"ensur[ing that] details of mistreatment [by security forces] are readily available\".81|\n|@bomsabih|9 January 201282||Inactive since 8 October 2014.

Ennumerating aax.me for Bait Content\n\n_This section describes how we probed every conceivable short URL on aax.me, and found 402 pieces of bait content that we_\n_believe were sent by Stealth Falcon._\n\nAll of the public aax.me links we found, as well as the links sent to Donaghy, matched the regular expression /aax\\.me\\/[0-9af]{5}/. Assuming all links shortened via aax.me match this regular expression, there are only 165 (1,048,576) possible short\nURLs. We sent a request to aax.me for each possible URL, and observed the returned page or redirect. We found 57 URLs\nthat exhibited the redirect.php profiling behavior, and 524 URLs that returned an HTTP 302 redirect to an expanded URL.\nThe other 1,047,995 aax.me links returned a HTTP 302 redirect to the aax.me homepage; we assume these short URLs were\nunassigned to an expanded URL, as of the time of our scan.\n\nWe coded the long URLs where the URLs were still active, or where we could find an archived copy of, or some information\nabout, the URL. We were able to code 535 URLs, and failed to code 46 URLs as the corresponding websites were down, and\nwe could not find reliable information about what content the URLs contained. See **Appendix E: Results of aax.me Scan for**\ndetails. We coded 133 URLs as \"advertisement\" (25% of all coded URLs), as they appeared to represent an advertisement for\na product. The vast majority of these advertisements seemed to be products typically marketed via spam (e.g., \"dietary\nsupplement\" or \"green coffee\"). We suspect that these links may have been shortened by spammers, as the aax.me URL\nshortening page is pubilcly accessible and indexed by Google, and YOURLS advises that publicly accessible URL shorteners\nwill receive spam.[83] All \"advertisement\" links were 302 redirects, and none were redirect.php links. This is consistent with\nour observation that the aax.me public interface only permits visitors to shorten links using the 302 redirect method.\n\nWe filtered out the short URLs classified as \"advertisement.\" There were 402 non-advertisement short URLs that we tagged.\nWe display a summary of the top ten tags below:\n\n**Tag** **Number of Short URLs** **% of non-advertisement URLs**\n\nUAE 292 73%\n\nTorture 57 14%\n\nSecurity Forces 49 12%\n\nDenaturalization 46 11%\n\nI bi Z d 42 10%\n\n|Tag|Number of Short URLs|% of non-advertisement URLs|\n|---|---|---|\n|UAE|292|73%|\n|Torture|57|14%|\n|Security Forces|49|12%|\n|Denaturalization|46|11%|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Criticism|40|10%|\n|---|---|---|\n|ABC News|40|10%|\n|Violations|33|8%|\n|Islam|29|7%|\n\n\nWe noted that a number of long URLs had multiple corresponding short URLs.

A report by BBC notes that UAE authorities on 14 December 2012 arrested an individual who they**\nbelieved to be associated with @WeldBudhabi, and that the account was \"reportedly hacked by the authorities\" on the same\nday.[84] The Emirati activist told us that he later contacted @WeldBudhabi, who reported that he did not send the link.\n\nThis link provides the strongest connection between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Authorities that we are aware of.\n\n**a7rarelemarat.com is a now-defunct website that purported to be an opposition web forum for discussing Emirati issues, and**\nproviding proxy tools for \"hiding from the thugs\" (presumably a reference to the UAE State Security Apparatus). We found\nfour links involving aax.me posted by the site's Twitter account, @a7rarelemarat. We display two Tweets below, as the rest\nof the Tweets had the same links:\n\n**_Figure 14: @a7rarelemarat targeted @WeldBudhabi with a malicious link on 20 October 2012_**\n\nTwitter's API records the date of the tweet's creation:\n\nSun Oct 21 05:05:41 +0000 2012\n\nWe also accessed the goo.gl link statistics, and found that the goo.gl link in the tweet was created less than two minutes prior\nto the tweet:\n\n2012-10-21T05:03:45.585+00:00\n\nThe second tweet exhibited a similar pattern:\n\n\n-----\n\nTwitter's API records the date of the tweet's creation:\n\nWed Oct 03 06:54:33 +0000 2012\n\nWe again accessed the goo.gl link statistics, and found that the goo.gl link in the tweet was created less than one minute prior\nto the tweet:\n\n2012-10-03T06:53:45.151+00:00\n\nThe link redirects to https://www.a7rarelemarat.com/vb/showthread.php?p=3423#post3423 via http://aax.me/d910a.\n\nThe use of both goo.gl and aax.me in these cases suggests that the goo.gl link may have been designed to conceal the aax.me\ndomain. Also, the proximity in creation time between the Tweet and the goo.gl link suggests that the person who posted the\nTweet through @a7rarelemarat was likely the same person who created the goo.gl link.\n\nWe suspect that the aax.me operator had some control over @a7rarelemarat at the time, and may have had control of\n**a7rarelemarat.com as well.**\n\n## 5.4. Infrastructure Analysis of Stealth Falcon Command & Control\n\n_This section describes how we traced Stealth Falcon's spyware to live C2 servers and domain names._\n\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of adhostingcache.com (the C2 server for the Stage One spyware that Donaghy received) and\ntraced it to a series of 14 active IP adresses and 11 domains (using PassiveTotal[85]). Nine domains are named like generic\nInternet backend servers (e.g., simpleadbanners.com, clickstatistic.com), whereas two appear to be thematically related to\ntravel (bestairlinepricetags.com, fasttravelclearance.com), perhaps indicative of travel-themed targeting or targets.\n\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of incapsulawebcache.com (the C2 server for the Stage Two spyware that Donaghy receied)\nand scanned the Internet (including historical scanning results[86]) for servers that matched our fingerprint. We also used\nPassive DNS to correlate IP addresses to domains. In total, we associated 67 active (and 30 historical) IP addresses with the\nStage Two spyware. Using PassiveTotal, we linked 69 domain names to these IP addresses, the earliest registered on 28\nJanuary 2013, and the most recent registered on 19 April 2016. The vast majority of the domains are named like generic\nInternet backend servers. One domain name appears to be travel-themed (airlineadverts.com), and two appear to be news\nand/or government themed (ministrynewschannel.com, ministrynewsinfo.com).\n\nThe earliest date we found an IP addresses matching our Stage Two fingerprint was 21 July 2014, as recorded by sonar-ssl\nscans. It is possible that the operator used a different configuration of spyware between January 2013 and July 2014.\n\nWe traced several additional domains to Stealth Falcon using WHOIS information, or Passive DNS. Of these, one was\ndesigned to impersonate a China-based provider of VoIP solutions (yeastarr.com), and two appeared to perhaps contain the\nArabic word for security, \"amn,\" (amnkeysvc.com, amnkeysvcs.com). Full scan results and other indicators of targeting can\nbe found in **Appendix F: Indicators of Targeting.**\n\nThe domain names we found were typically registered with WHOIS privacy providers. Although, in some cases, we were\nable to obtain the true registration email through historical WHOIS. Typically, the operators practiced disciplined operational\nsecurity: we rarely found an email address that was used to register two domains, and we rarely found two domains linked to\nthe same IP address.\n\n## 5.5. May 2016: New Stealth Falcon Document\n\nIn May 2016, the following document was submitted to VirusTotal:\n\n**Filename: message_032456944343.docm**\n**MD5:    87e1df6f36b96b56186444e37e2a1ef5**\n**SHA1:   1c3757006f972ca957d925accf8bbb3023550d1b**\n**SHA256:  4320204d577ef8b939115d16110e97ff04cb4f7d1e77ba5ce011d43f74abc7be**\n\nThe document was similar to the one sent to Donaghy, except that it purported to be encrypted with WordSecure, \"a simple,\n_HIPAA_ _b_ _i_ _d_ _f_ _f_ _h_ _i_ _d fil_ _d_ _i h_ _\"_ [87] Th b i\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document's macro was identical to the one sent to Donaghy, except it reported back to, and downloaded Stage Two from a\ndifferent URL: http://optimizedimghosting.com/wddf/hrrw/ggrr.txt. The server optimizedimghosting.com matched our\nStage One fingerprint for adhostingcache.com.\n\nWe obtained Stage Two, which appeared to be a newer version of the Stage Two than in Donaghy's case. The Stage Two in\nthis case reported back to https://edgecacheimagehosting.com/images/image.nfo. The server edgecacheimagehosting.com\nmatched our Stage Two fingerprint for incapsulawebcache.com.\n\nWhen we connected, the Stage Two server sent us additional commands (which we were unable to obtain in Donaghy's case).\nThe Stage Two C2 sent us a bundle of 7 commands, that did the following:\n\n1. Gathered system info from WMI\n2. Gathered the ARP table\n3. Gathered a list of running processes\n4. Materialized a file \"OracleJavaUpdater.ps1\" to disk. This file gathers passwords and web browser data from a variety\n\nof sources: Windows Credential Vault, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Outlook. In general, the file appears to be\nbespoke attacker code, though some routines are copied from other sources (e.g., some Internet Explorer password\ngathering code appears to be lifted from the GPLv3-licensed QuasarRAT[88])\n5. Executed \"OracleJavaUpdater.ps1\"\n6. Deleted \"OracleJavaUpdater.ps1\"\n7. Gathered a list of running processes again\n\nAfter command execution, results were returned to the Stage Two C2.\n\n# 6. Tip of the Iceberg: Possibly Related Attacks\n\nWe suspect that the activity we have observed is simply the tip of the iceberg in ongoing attacks against dissidents in the\nUAE. Reuse of tactics, techniques and procedures and general carelessness by operators can often lead to discovery of links\nbetween campaigns. We briefly discuss some instances of potentially related attacks below.\n\n## 6.1. An Instagram attack?\n\nWe noticed that one of the Twitter accounts that sent out aax.me links, @um_zainab123, solicited followers for an Instagram\naccount @al7ruae2014.\n\n**_Figure 16: @um_zainab123 soliciting followers for Instagram account @al7ruae2014 on 26 April 2014_**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe contacted an activist with knowledge of the UAE94 case, who told us that the @al7ruae2014 Instagram account got in\ntouch with several family members of detainees involved in the case, and was soliciting information from them via Instagram\nprivate message. The domain name al7ruae2014.com has the same name as the Instagram account, so we suspect it may also\nbe related to the operator.\n\n## 6.2. A fake file sharing site?\n\nWe identified one aax.me link (http://aax.me/4b708) that points to http://velocityfiles.com/download.php?\n**id=a81abdd8a0c0cd1d5d3b6baadcc9eb18. We visited this link in February 2016, and were served a blank page.**\nVelocityFiles appears to have been disabled in March 2016.\n\nWe found that the site purported to be a file hosting site, where users could register and upload files. However, the registration\nand signup pages are currently blank, and were blank as of the Internet Archive's oldest capture of the pages in December\n2013.[89] We were unable to identify any links to velocityfiles.com from Twitter, or any pages indexed by Google.\n\nThe design of VelocityFiles appeared to be a loosely modified version of a public website design template.[90] Given that the\nsite appears to be designed to pose as a public file sharing service, has no obvious public functionality, and was linked to\nthrough aax.me, we suspect that it may have been an attack site.\n\n**_Figure 18: Comparison between web design template image (left) and VelocityFiles website (right)._**\n\nGiven VelocityFiles' reference to \"FREE MD5 HASHING\" (their emphasis), it is possible that the value of the id parameter\nin the URL, a81abdd8a0c0cd1d5d3b6baadcc9eb18, represents the MD5 hash of a file. We were, however, unable to locate\nany file with this MD5 hash.\n\n## 6.3. Fake web forums?\n\nWe found an aax.me link[91] that pointed to https://call4uaefreedom.com/vb. The domain was registered on 5/15/2013 and\nexpired on 5/15/2015. We were unable to find any webpages or tweets linking to this website. A Google search for\n\"call4uaefreedom\" reveals a blog, containing five posts, all within a 30 minute span on 4 June 2013, and an empty Twitter\naccount @call4uaefreedom, created in May 2013. Given the suspicious activity associated with the alias \"call4uaefreedom,\"\nthis may have been created by operators.\n\nWhile searching for domains with similar domain names, we came across uaefreedom.com. The domain name was first\nregistered on 11 June 2010 by the administrators of UAE Hewar,[92] an online discussion forum founded in 2009 that was a\n\n\n-----\n\nOn 16 October 2012, we find the only tweet linking to uaefreedom.com. A Google search yields no links to the site and we\nfound no passive DNS data available for this domain. The tweet was sent from account @FreeUAE2012, directed at\n@uaemot. An individual based in Qatar was convicted in absentia on 25 December 2013 for running @uaemot.[93]\n\n**_Figure 19: @FreeUAE2012 contacts @uaemot with a suspicious link on 16 October 2012_**\n\nOther public tweets involving @FreeUAE2012 included two responses[94] from Ahmed Mansoor to @FreeUAE2012 on 10\nOctober 2012, regarding the 10 October 2012 Citizen Lab report about how Ahmed Mansoor was targeted with Hacking\nTeam spyware. The tweets from @FreeUAE2012 to which Ahmed Mansoor was responding appear to have been deleted.\n\nThree days later, @FreeUAE2012 attempted to convince Ahmed Mansoor that Tor Browser logged private information of its\nusers, posting a screenshot of the Tor Metrics page, which provides non-sensitive data for researchers.[95]\n\n**_Figure 20: @FreeUAE2012 attempts to convince Ahmed Mansoor that Tor logs private information of its users_**\n\n# 7. Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nStealth Falcon is a sophisticated threat actor, capable of deploying a wide range of technical and social engineering techniques\nagainst a potential target. The operations targeting Donaghy are linked to a series of primarily UAE-focused campaigns\nagainst UAE dissidents, starting in January 2012. While there is no \"smoking gun,\" several pieces of evidence suggest a\nconnection between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Government.\n\n**UAE Focused Targeting, Links to Arrests**\n\nThe majority (73%) of bait content on aax.me was focused on UAE-related political issues (Section 5.2). Furthermore, of the\n27 victim Twitter accounts we linked to public Stealth Falcon targeting, 24 primarily engaged in political activities, or were\n**otherwise critical of the UAE government (Section 5.1). Of these 24, we were able to find a subsequent arrest or a**\nconviction in absentia by the UAE government.\n\n**Tweets During a Period of Government Control**\n\nA reported case in which a Twitter account apparently under UAE Government control shared a Stealth Falcon link also\nsuggests a connection.\n\nIn December 2012, an activist contacted us and asserted that an a7rarelemarat.com link was sent to him in a private message\nfrom the @WeldBudhabi account the same day that an individual accused of operating the account was arrested, and while\nthe account was \"reportedly hacked by authorities\".[96] The activist asserted that he contacted an owner of the account, who\nclaimed he did not send that link. The Twitter account associated with a7rarelemarat.com, @a7rarelemarat, appears to\nhave been under the control of Stealth Falcon at some point during October 2012 (and possibly before and after), as the\naccount sent several aax.me links in October 2012.\n\n**Sophisticated Target Knowledge and Operational Security**\n\nStealth Falcon demonstrates some familiarity with the patterns of behavior, interests, and activities of its targets, suggesting\nthat the operators may have been working with other sources of information about their targets' behaviors. In addition, Stealth\nFalcon displayed above-average operational security throughout the campaign. Some of the social engineering was highly\nintricate, particularly the email from Andrew Dwight about his ski holiday. Stealth Falcon also shows familiarity with\ncreating and maintaining a range of fictitious personas, and registering and managing a significant amount of attack and C2\ninfrastructure with concern for operational security.\n\nThe infrastructure behind the malware attacks showed good compartmentalization of identities. We rarely found the same\n(fake) registration information used for more than one C2 domain. Stealth Falcon operators also appear to have deleted one of\ntheir attack domains, adhostingcache.com when they realized their attempt to target Donaghy had failed. We also noted that\nthe (self-signed) SSL certificates on the C2 domains were changed several times as we monitored the infrastructure, perhaps\nin an attempt to thwart fingerprinting of their infrastructure via SSL certificates.\n\nThis level of sophistication is consistent with a state sponsored attacker. Importantly, we found little evidence that indicate\ncriminal or other motivation for the attack, with no evidence of financial or industry targeting.\n\nWe also note that while some Stealth Falcon domains were registered on anonymousbitcoindomains.com, which is linked to\nAPT28 activities, we found no evidence to support such a connection. See **Appendix G: No Evidence of APT28**\n**Connection for more details.**\n\n## Hypothesis 2: Stealth Falcon is Not State Sponsored\n\nWe have considered the possibility that Stealth Falcon's operators are not state sponsored, but ultimately find little evidence to\nsupport this possibility.\n\nStealth Falcon's attacks show no evidence of cyber criminal motivations, like financial theft or fraud, nor is there any evidence\nof attempts to steal intellectual property or conduct other forms of economic espionage. Instead, the targets are politically\nengaged individuals and public figures. Furthermore, the activity of targets we have been able to identify often concerns\ndomestic UAE issues. Therefore, we would need to posit an operator with an interest in individuals known for their\nengagement in domestic UAE issues\n\n\n-----\n\n, p\nTools (RATs), rather than apparently coding a general-purpose RAT from scratch. This would save them the trouble of\nneeding to load additional malware to exfiltrate files or other material. We are aware of no evidence of follow-up interactions\nbetween the operators and successful victims as part of any extortion attempts. Furthermore, Stealth Falcon's use of\nJavaScript to profile and de-anonymize victims seems inconsistent with a primary motivation of collecting information that\ncould be used for blackmail.\n\nThe strongest scenario for a non-state sponsored attacker is thus a politically motivated group. Stealth Falcon targets are\nprimarily individuals known for their criticism of the UAE government. It is perhaps conceivable that a group of progovernment hackers might, without coordination, target these individuals.\n\nThere are, however, several features of Stealth Falcon's activities that tell against this possibility. First, there is limited existing\nevidence that such autonomous groups exist and are active in the UAE. Given what is known about this kind of group, we\nmight expect such a group to have engaged in defacements, public boasting, or other public-facing activities related to Stealth\nFalcon's campaign. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that a previously unknown political group would have the resources to\ndevelop and maintain Stealth Falcon's fictitious personas and compartmentalized infrastructure.\n\n## Evaluation of Hypotheses\n\nWe evaluated both hypotheses and found Hypothesis 1: Stealth Falcon is State Sponsored to be the best at explaining the\nmany elements that we have observed. Stealth Falcon's tactics, resources, and targets all fit with the profile of a state\nsponsored attacker. Furthermore, the circumstantial evidence we have presented in this report is suggestive of a link between\nStealth Falcon and an entity within the UAE Government.\n\n# 8. Conclusion: The Big Picture\n\nStealth Falcon appears to be a new, state sponsored threat actor. As an operator, Stealth Falcon is distinguished by well\ninformed and sophisticated social engineering, combined with moderately sophisticated[97] technical attempts to deanonymize\nand monitor political targets working on the UAE, and relatively simple malcode.[98]\n\n## Social Engineering and the Achilles Heel of Civil Society\n\nStealth Falcon's technical approach may not be cutting edge, but the operators are neither unsophisticated or ineffective.\nAnalyzed holistically as an operation, Stealth Falcon is a logical and multi-pronged approach to compromising and\nunmasking a class of targets. Stealth Falcon's campaign highlights the power of social engineering, once a technical bar has\nbeen met, in conducting a large scale campaign.\n\nContemporary social movements and civil society groups rely heavily on the internet for both their core operations, as well as\nadvocacy activities. Yet these groups are often operating outside a centrally managed IT environment. The constant sharing\nof links and materials, as well as regular communications with journalists makes them especially vulnerable to targeting with\nsocial engineering.\n\nHowever, the emphasis on social engineering can also cut in the other direction. Many modern attack techniques require an\nattacker to interact with a target. When operators like Stealth Falcon send malicious e-mails and tweets, there are a range of\nopportunities for retrospective investigation. As this report shows, the inboxes of targets, for example, are often a more\nefficient object of investigation than computers themselves, especially once features of a particular campaign are recognized.\n\n## The Growing Trend of Impersonating Journalists\n\nStealth Falcon is only the latest example of civil society-focused threat actors impersonating NGOs and journalists to conduct\nespionage operations. The tactic has been used by a wide range of actors, including Bahrain's government,[99] Packrat in Latin\nAmerica,[100] Iranian groups,[101] and China related groups,[102] among others. Threat actors seem to gravitate towards this tactic\nbecause interacting with journalists is an essential part of civil society activity. It is common for journalists to send unsolicited\nmessages to activists and civil society organizations asking for information, and there is typically a strong incentive for the\n\n\n-----\n\np y y p y y, q y g\nthe trust on which civil society is based.\n\n**Final Note: A Plea for More Research**\n\nImportantly, while we were unable to identify evidence of a conclusive link between Stealth Falcon and a particular sponsor,\nwe have assembled a body of circumstantial evidence that points to an alignment of interests between Stealth Falcon and the\nUAE Security Forces. We hope that other researchers will draw from our findings and work to identify additional cases.\nFinally, we urge anyone who recalls receiving a link to \"aax.me,\" or an email from \"Andrew Dwight\" to contact the authors\nof this report for further investigation.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to PassiveTotal and Rori Donaghy.
