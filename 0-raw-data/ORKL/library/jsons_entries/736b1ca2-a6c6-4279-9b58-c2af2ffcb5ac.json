The variant examined by Malwarebytes included scraping\ncapabilities for details from \"an impressive selection of digital wallets.\"\n\nOnce it starts running, Vidar searches for data specified in its configuration along and\n[delivers it to the command and control (C2) server as a ZIP archive, notes Segura.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/01/vidar-gandcrab-stealer-and-ransomware-combo-observed-in-the-wild/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIts interface makes it easy for the operator to keep track of the victims, deliver instructions\nto the malware and check the type of data collected from each infected host.\n\n## Downloading GandCrab ransomware\n\nVidar can work as a malware dropper and in the case observed by Malwarebytes the\nsecond payload was GandCrab ransomware.\n\n\"Within about a minute after the initial Vidar infection, the victim’s files will be encrypted and\ntheir wallpaper hijacked to display the note for GandCrab version 5.04.\"\n\n5.04 is the latest revision of the ransomware and at the moment there is no possibility to\ndecrypt the files it touches without paying the ransom or getting the decryption key from the\nthreat actor.\n\nUsers affected by earlier versions of the ransomware can recover their files with a free\n[GandCrab decryption tool that works with v1, v4, and v5 up to v5.02 of the malware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decrypter-available-for-the-latest-gandcrab-ransomware-versions/)\n\n\n-----\n\nRunning an infostealer before deploying the ransomware ensures some money for the\nadversary even if the victim does not pay the ransom. Even if the cybercriminals do not use\nthe stolen data themselves, they can sell it on underground forums.\n\nUsers with computer files locked by GandCrab should now also consider changing the\nusername/password combinations at least for the critical services and applicatons they're\nusing.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[GandCrab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gandcrab/)\n[Information Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/information-stealer/)\n[Malvertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malvertising/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
