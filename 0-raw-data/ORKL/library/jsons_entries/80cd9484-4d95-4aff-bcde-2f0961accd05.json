The Excel spreadsheet includes an obfuscated macro that\nlaunches PowerShell in hidden mode and downloads the payload from geronaga.com, a\nwebsite that is registered with a Chinese website register https://now.cn. The IP address on\nthis website, at the time when this attack was identified, pointed to a server in Russia.\n\nUpon opening the file, which is a multi-threat document, the user has no insight into the\n[automatic execution of the macro. The hacker is using a tool called Evil Clippy to hide the](https://github.com/outflanknl/EvilClippy)\nmacro from being viewed or analyzed by static analysis tools. Evil Clippy is a cross-platform\nassistant for creating malicious Microsoft Office documents. This tool was released during a\n[BlackHat Asia talk on March 28, 2019.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ULzZA70Dzg)\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the file is opened, and the user either enables editing or clicks on the link within the\nExcel to “View & Pay the Invoice,” it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command that\ndownloads the payload from a website and executes the attack. This attack is a multi-staged\nattack—using a sophisticated technique that evades email protection software and using\nadvanced tactics that make it look like it came from these UPS, FedEx, and DHL shipping\ncompanies in separate messages.\n\n**[No time to read now? Download the FedEx, UPS, DHL Case Study here.](https://info.votiro.com/fedex-ups-case-study)**\n\n## Who is affected:\n\nPeople and businesses – even people who are aware of phishing emails – are susceptible to\nthis email campaign. This email campaign was missed by SaaS email protection providers\nbecause the macro was hidden and the macro was novel and not included in existing\nsignature databases. As of 2pm ET on May 5th, 2020, VirusTotal reports several email\n[protection services that would still miss the UPS and](https://votiro.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/UPS-Attack-VirusTotal-5-5-2020-4_40.png) [FedEx email. This improves the](https://votiro.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FedEx-Attack-VirusTotal-5-5-2020-4_40.png)\nchances that the attack makes it to business and personal inboxes.\n\nThe attacker wanted to make a phishing email appear as if it came from either FedEx, UPS,\nor DHL by injecting their servers into the header of the messages. Even a well-trained\nperson could be fooled by this phishing attack, as it makes the email sender appear to be\nlegitimate.\n\nIf an unsuspecting person received one of these legitimate-looking emails with a Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet attached, it is highly likely that they would open the attached Excel\nspreadsheet and compromise their systems.\n\n## Video Version\n\nIn the below video, Votiro Director of Engineering – North America, Rich Hosgood, dissects\nthe UPS, FedEx, and DHL emails and Excel Attachments.\n\n## Additional information about each hack:\n\n### UPS Phishing Email\n\nA legitimate looking email that appeared to come from the UPS website was sent from\nhost242-180-static.131-212-b.business.telecomitalia.it, which is an Italian telco. The return\npath on the message header points\n[398094.20200420134554@ZUJOHUR.FODEWOX.njppsagent8.ups.com, which is a UPS](https://www.google.com/maps/search/+UPS+Mahwah/@41.0667409,-74.1725338,473m/data=!3m1!1e3)\nserver in Matawan, NJ. Inside this email was a legitimate-looking message from UPS with\nthe logo and links that lead to ups.com. This email included an Excel spreadsheet that\nconsists of a macro that automatically executes a PowerShell code, which exploits the user’s\ncomputer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attack was identified by Votiro on April 20, 2020 at 8:45am. It was uploaded to\nVirusTotal on April 22, 2020 at 5:14pm. A second UPS phishing email was received on April\n22, 2020 at 1:42pm. The hash for this is included at the bottom of the post.\n\nThis email also included an Excel spreadsheet attachment with an auto-execution macro.\nThat attachment looked like this.\n\n\n-----\n\nEvery email message received by end-users contains header information. This message\n**contained server names as if it originated directly from UPS. Even a well-trained person**\nin cybersecurity could be fooled by this phishing attempt.\n\n### FedEx Phishing Email\n\nA legitimate-looking email that appeared to come from Fedex.com was sent from\n116.17.62.149, which traces back to Shaping, Guangdong, China. This email was received\nby Votiro on April 27, 2020 at 8:45am. The return path on the message header points\n[sinai25@pvma00009.prod.fedex.com, and this is a server owned by FedEx in Collierville,](https://www.google.com/maps/place/FedEx+TechConnect+Customer+Service/@35.0318589,-89.6730359,1033m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x887f99e741714c3d:0xa1b7fb55da80054b!8m2!3d35.0318589!4d-89.6708472)\nTennessee. Inside this email was a legitimate-looking message from FedEx with the logo and\nlinks pointing to FedEx.\n\n**Received: from 116.17.62.149 China IP https://ipinfo.io/116.17.62.149**\n\n**From: Billing FedEx <BillingOnline@fedex.com>**\n\n**[Return-Path: sinai25@pvma00009.prod.fedex.com](https://www.google.com/maps/place/FedEx+TechConnect+Customer+Service/@35.0318589,-89.6730359,1033m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x887f99e741714c3d:0xa1b7fb55da80054b!8m2!3d35.0318589!4d-89.6708472)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below Excel was included in the email.\n\nThis message contained server names as if it originated directly from FedEx.\n\n### DHL Phishing Email\n\nThe DHL phishing email was less branded than the other emails. But it is important to note\nthat the sender appears to be legitimate, with a firstname.lastname@dhl.com email address\nappearing to be the sender.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn individual—who has a name within one letter of the one used as a spoofed DHL email\naddress—exists on LinkedIn, and their profile lists them as working at DHL. The profile has\nvery few details. While the profile may not be from the attackers, it helps add legitimacy to\nthe email, as even though the attacks contain a slightly different spelling of their name, the\nsingle letter difference can be hard to miss.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hashes\n\nUPS: e6c5862320ae7d8032fab1292121a98ca55e3842211112b8b9f2a2578b3e4dc0\n\nFedEx: 8e06789e952991e6fc483ab0e6bbf08a123922ba354a75c9dc9dcc759c60c194\n\n\n-----\n\n**Want to stay up to date on the latest file-borne threats?
