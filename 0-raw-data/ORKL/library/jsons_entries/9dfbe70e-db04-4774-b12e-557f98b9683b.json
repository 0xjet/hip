The hacker organization sent a phishing email to the victim\nby forging a police station investigation letter, COVID-19 detection notice, etc., Through the\nbackdoor virus to control the victim’s machine, steal valuable sensitive data related to the\ntarget.\n\nThe PDB path of the virus samples used by the organization points to a user named\n“Vendetta”, and we will later also name the hacker organization Vendetta:\n\n“C:\\Users\\Vendetta\\source\\repos\\{project name}\\*\\obj\\Debug\\{project name}.pdb”\n\nIn some samples, we have repeatedly detected the following tags, the virus author claims\nthat he is from Italy:\n\nHowever, we found in the naming of virus samples that virus authors like to use certain\nTurkish names to name variables, such as “RoboSki”, so we suspect that the organization\noriginated in Europe:\n\n\n-----\n\nVendetta is a hacker organization that is very good at using social engineering. They forge\nphishing emails very realistically. They can easily gain users’ trust and guide users to open\nthe malicious programs they carry.\n\nThe picture below is a Vendetta forgery of the investigation letter issued by the Austrian\nFederal Ministry of the Interior (BMI)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nForged investigation letter from the Romanian police station:\n\nForged the COVID-19 virus test email issued by the Australian Government Department of\nHealth. The email stated that the victim had contact with a confirmed case within the past 14\ndays. It is recommended to read the test guide in the attachment and accept the test:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nForged a virus test email issued by the Mexican health department:\n\nAs well as the forged email quoted by the Egyptian Orascom Group:.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe compressed file in the email attachment contains the Trojan file, which is generally\nnamed after pdf.exe, Document.exe, etc. After running, it decrypts and loads the subsequent\nvirus module in memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n## RoboSki\n\nIn all samples, we detected the same type of code obfuscator, and according to its PDB\ndebugging path, we named it RoboSki:\n\nRoboSki encrypts and stores the shellcode in the pixels of the picture. The following figure is\nthe code logic to extract the available pixel data and decrypt the shellcode:\n\n\n-----\n\n**ReZer0**\n\nThe execution logic of ReZer0 is controlled by hard-coded built-in instructions. According to\ndifferent instructions, different malicious functions are executed. Its design logic resembles\nthe design method of backdoor programs:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have sorted out the hard-coded instructions and their corresponding meanings, most of\nwhich are not used:\n\n**Hardcode[x]** **Description**\n\n0 [0] == 4 load the plugin from the\nresource into memory\n\n[0]! = 4 Inject the plugin in the resource into the\nsystem process to execute\n\n1 Whether to register scheduled tasks\n\n\n-----\n\n4 Download and execute any file\n\n5 Download file URL\n\n6 The execution path of the\ndownloaded file\n\n7 Whether to detect the virtual\nmachine\n\n8 Whether to detect sandbox\n\n9 ByPass antivirus software\n\n29 Show file version\n\n34 Sleep()\n\n35 Sleep duration\n\nIn the 360 massive data, we found that ReZer0 has an obvious version identification. In\nconjunction with the above-mentioned large number of instructions used, we speculate that\nthe software is still in the development stage, and it will not be ruled out that the program will\nbe controlled through network communication in the future:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the nature of the backdoor virus, ReZer0 also carries known remote control\nTrojans such as NanoCore and Remcos in the resources. We will not repeat the remote\ncontrol functions such as NanoCore. We take some of the victims of Vendetta as an example\nto speculate the purpose of their actions.\n\n\n-----\n\nPassion Fruit Company of Australia (PAI) is a representative institution and a non-profit\nmembership organization that supports the passion fruit industry in Australia. PAI is an\numbrella organization that represents and enhances the interests of everyone in the passion\nfruit industry, including growers, packers, wholesalers, exporters, researchers, and retail\nstores.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, Vendetta’s attack target is not only the PAI family. We have roughly described the\ndistribution of Vendetta’s attack target by statistically the distribution of related samples, and\nits attack purpose is to steal related commercial information.\n\n**Summary**\n\n\n-----\n\nVendetta is an active hacking organization that started in April 2020. The organization may\nhave originated in Europe. It is good at using social engineering to launch cyber attacks. The\npurpose of the attack is to steal targeted business intelligence.\n\n**C2:**\n\n172.111.188.199:8829\n\n**Md5:**\n\ne73d9b2eba5e818cd4699f1484af5bce\n\ndabbfc6a7d939c4c41fb2c7cee295220\n\ndd93825ca5bd3afda1c238ce2ded84e1\n\n500dc2b3fbea8f13b29f494afb9465ec\n\n2106b19ffb7bf327d64d4cd6bdb606b4\n\ne73d9b2eba5e818cd4699f1484af5bce\n\n[Learn more about 360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n\n-----",
