One**\n\n**[group, which we call Cadelle, uses Backdoor.Cadelspy, while the other, which we’ve named](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-090808-1754-99)**\n\n**[Chafer, uses Backdoor.Remexi and Backdoor.Remexi.B. These threats are capable of](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-110911-3433-99)**\n\n**opening a back door and stealing information from victims’ computers**\n\n**The Cadelle and Chafer groups**\n\n**Symantec telemetry identified Cadelle and Chafer activity dating from as far back as July**\n\n**2014, however, it’s likely that activity began well before this date. Command-and-control**\n\n**(C&C) registrant information points to activity possibly as early as 2011, while executable**\n\n**compilation times suggest early 2012. Their attacks continue to the present day. Symantec**\n\n**estimates that each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people.**\n\n**The back door threats that the groups use appear to be custom made. It’s unclear how**\n\n**Cadelle infects its targets with Backdoor.Cadelspy. However, Chafer has been observed**\n\n**compromising web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks, to drop Backdoor.Remexi**\n\n**onto victims’ computers. Chafer then uses Remexi to gather user names and passwords to**\n\n**help it spread further across the network.**\n\n**There is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way, though we**\n\n**cannot confirm this. A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy and Remexi**\n\n**infections within a small time window. In one instance, a computer was compromised with**\n\n**Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with Backdoor.Remexi. The Cadelle**\n\n**and Chafer groups also keep the same working hours and focus on similar targets.**\n\n**However, no sharing of C&C infrastructure between the teams has been observed.**\n\n**If Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working for a**\n\n**single entity. Their victim profile may be of interest to a nation state.**\n\n**The victims**\n\n**Data from Cadelle’s C&C servers shows that a large number of Backdoor.Cadelspy**\n\n**infections affected individual users of Iranian internet service providers (ISPs) and hosting**\n\n**services. This suggests that the majority of victims are based in Iran. There was also a**\n\n**significant amount of individual targets that used anonymous proxy services to go online.**\n\n**Reports have shown that many Iranians avail of these services to access sites that are**\n\n**blocked by the government’s internet censorship measures. Dissidents, activists, and**\n\n**researchers in the region may use these proxies in an attempt to keep their online activities**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1. Backdoor.Cadelspy infections by region_**\n\n**In terms of targeted organizations, both Cadelle and Chafer seem to be interested in a**\n\n**similar category of organizations, such as airlines and telecom companies. The affected**\n\n**organizations we were able to identify are mostly based in the Middle East region in**\n\n**countries such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, while one organization is located in the US.**\n\n**_Figure 2. Number of unique organizations hit with Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi_**\n\n**_from July 2014 to October 2015_**\n\n**Our telemetry shows that among more than a dozen entities that experienced Cadelspy and**\n\n**Remexi infections, four of them were compromised with both of the threats at some stages.**\n\n**In most instances, victim computers were infected with either Backdoor.Cadelspy or**\n\n**Backdoor.Remexi, not both. Less than five percent of computers were infected with both**\n\n**malware families. In one affected organization, there was intermittent activity between the**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The malware’s activity on victim computers appears to depend on the targets. One**\n\n**computer that was infected with both Cadelspy and Remexi was a system that ran a SIM**\n\n**card editing application. Other compromised computers included those belonging to web**\n\n**developers, or are file and database servers.**\n\n**The nature of the victims suggests that Cadelle and Chafer are primarily interested in**\n\n**tracking individuals in terms of their movements and communications. Compromising**\n\n**regional telcos and airlines can help the attackers achieve this aim.**\n\n**Based in Iran?**\n\n**There are a number of factors in these groups’ campaigns that suggests that the attackers**\n\n**may be based in Iran. Cadelle and Chafer are most active during the day time within Iran’s**\n\n**time zone and primarily operate during Iran’s business week (Saturday through Thursday).**\n\n**_Figure 3. Cadelle and Chafer’s activity levels by hour in Iran’s time zone (UTC +3.5)_**\n\n**Additionally, Symantec observed that Backdoor.Cadelspy’s file strings seem to include dates**\n\n**[written in the Solar Hijri calendar, which is used in Iran and Afghanistan. While the Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar)**\n\n**calendar marks the current year as 2015, the Solar Hijri calendar states that it is 1394.**\n\n**When we converted the dates in the file strings from the Solar Hijri calendar to the Gregorian**\n\n**one, we found that they were close to the compilation times of the executables and also**\n\n**close to when Cadelle’s targets were initially compromised.**\n\n**Based on our analysis, we believe that Cadelle and Chafer’s victims are most likely to be of**\n\n**interest to an Iranian entity. Cadelle and Chafer are by no means the first Iran-based attack**\n\n**t** **Oth** **tt ib t d t** **I** **i** **tt** **k** **h** **R** **k t Kitt** **h**\n\n\n-----\n\n**journalists, and dissidents. Backdoor.Remexi activity in particular is reminiscent of Operation**\n\n**[Cleaver, as documented by Cylance, and may possibly be a continuation of that activity.](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/270968/assets/Cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf)**\n\n**Cadelle and Chafer’s malware**\n\n**The groups use one malware family each to open a back door and steal information from**\n\n**the compromised computer. Cadelle uses Backdoor.Cadelspy while Chafer operates with**\n\n**Backdoor.Remexi and Backdoor.Remexi.B.**\n\n**Cadelspy initially arrives on the computer as a dropper, which downloads two installer**\n\n**components catering to whether the victim is running a 32-bit or 64-bit system. The dropper**\n\n**then executes the appropriate installer, which launches Cadelspy’s malicious payload and**\n\n**allows it to run whenever any Windows program is executed.**\n\n**Cadelspy’s main payload contains its back door functionality, allowing the threat to carry out**\n\n**the following activities:**\n\n**Log keystrokes and the titles of open windows**\n\n**Gather clipboard data and system information**\n\n**Steal printer information and any documents that were sent to be printed**\n\n**Record audio**\n\n**Capture screenshots and webcam photos**\n\n**Cadelspy compresses all of the stolen data into a .cab file and uploads it to the attacker’s**\n\n**C&C servers. The threat is also able to update its configuration file to gain additional**\n\n**features.**\n\n**Meanwhile, Chafer’s threat Remexi contains fewer features than Cadelle’s Cadelspy does.**\n\n**Remexi is a basic back door Trojan that allows attackers to open a remote shell on the**\n\n**computer and execute commands. Though this is unsophisticated, a remote shell does**\n\n**provide a highly flexible and powerful means of remote access in the hands of a skilled**\n\n**attacker.**\n\n**Mitigation**\n\n**Cadelle and Chafer’s activities show that attack groups don’t need advanced skills to**\n\n**conduct effective targeted espionage against victims. The two groups’ threats have**\n\n**managed to remain on their targets’ computers for almost a year, potentially giving the**\n\n**attackers access to an enormous amount of sensitive information. They’re also aware that**\n\n**they don’t only have to directly attack the individuals, as they can get to their victims by**\n\n**compromising the services that they use, such as airlines and telcos.**\n\n**Both Cadelle and Chafer are still active today and we don’t expect to see them end their**\n\n\n-----\n\n**by these teams should adhere to the following advice:**\n\n**Ensure that software on computers and servers is being regularly updated to prevent**\n\n**known vulnerabilities from being exploited**\n\n**Treat unsolicited emails with suspicion.
