We will occasionally report on significant\nactivity using a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-16,\nwhere the activity is new and significant but doesn’t map to existing\ngroupings and hasn’t yet graduated or merged into an established\nactivity group.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Suspected Chinese state-sponsored intrusions targeting Southeast Asia (past 9 months) (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n##### Background\n\nInsikt Group has reported extensively on Chinese statesponsored threat activity groups targeting countries surrounding\nthe People’s Republic of China (PRC). In the past year, much of\n[this activity has focused on India, with groups such as RedEcho,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\n[RedFoxtrot, and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redfoxtrot-china-pla-targets-bordering-asian-countries/) [TAG-28 heavily targeting government and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-linked-tag-28-targets-indias-the-times-group/)\nprivate sector organizations following a significant increase in\ntensions between the Indian and PRC governments. Alongside\nthis concentration on India, other Asian countries are also prime\ntargets of many PRC-sponsored groups. Much of this is likely\ndriven by traditional espionage goals, as well as supporting\nstrategic policy objectives like the Belt and Road Initiative and\nFive-Year Plans. Southeast Asia is no exception to this, and\nthe South China Sea territorial disputes very likely constitute\nanother driver of China’s cyber espionage activity.\n\n\nBased on Recorded Future adversary infrastructure\ndetection and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) techniques, in the\npast 9 months, Insikt Group identified over 400 unique victim\nservers located in Southeast Asia communicating with malware\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure with likely links to\nChinese state-sponsored actors. The top 3 targeted countries\nwithin our data set were Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, with\nknown groups active in the region including RedDelta, Naikon,\nand Goblin Panda, as well as temporary clusters we group as\nTAG-16 and TAG-22.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Suspected Chinese state-sponsored intrusions targeting Southeast Asia by country in the past 9 months. The number of victim organizations is likely smaller than the number of_\n_victim IPs listed due to IP reassignment and other technical considerations. (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n##### China State-Sponsored Activity in the South China Sea\n\nChinese state-sponsored groups have traditionally been\nhighly active in targeting the PRC’s rival claimants in the South\nChina Sea, with the operational tempo often mirroring increased\ngeopolitical tensions. For instance, escalating tensions related to\n[China’s development of artificial islands containing port facilities,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/tensions-and-territorial-claims-in-the-south-china-sea-the-guardian-briefing)\n[airstrips, and military buildings within the disputed Spratly](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/30/world/asia/what-china-has-been-building-in-the-south-china-sea.html)\nIslands archipelago [reportedly led to increased activity from](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/15GlobalThreatReport.pdf)\nChinese state-affiliated groups in 2015. This activity entailed\nreconnaissance and phishing campaigns targeting rival claimants\nthroughout the development of the artificial islands, which\nintensified as the PRC’s progress was increasingly reported in\nlocal media throughout the region. Multiple Chinese APT groups\nwere observed conducting this activity, including Vixen Panda,\nNaikon, and Goblin Panda (Cycldek).\n\n[In more recent years, Insikt Group has observed continued](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-threat-actor-tempperiscope/)\ntargeting of South China Sea claimants by additional Chinese\nstate-sponsored groups, notably APT40, a [group](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) [linked to the](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2020/01/16/apt40-is-run-by-the-hainan-department-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\nMinistry of State Security’s Hainan State Security Department.\n[APT40 has typically targeted maritime and engineering entities,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor.html)\nas well as organizations with operations in Southeast Asia or\ninvolved in South China Sea disputes. Of particular note was\nthe group’s [targeting of multiple Cambodian entities related](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\nto the country’s electoral system ahead of the country’s 2018\n[election. Given the historical](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-ruling-asean/asean-deadlocked-on-south-china-sea-cambodia-blocks-statement-idUSKCN1050F6) [support of Cambodia’s incumbent](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-10/04/c_139418502.htm)\ngovernment for China in the South China Sea, this has been\n[interpreted as a possible step to monitor and avoid an election](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\nupset that could weaken China’s influence in the region.\n\n\n###### Activity Spotlight: TAG-16 Targets Southeast Asian Governments with South China Sea Focus\n\nThroughout 2021, Insikt Group tracked a persistent cyber\nespionage campaign targeting the prime minister’s offices,\nmilitary entities, and government departments of rival South\nChina Sea claimants Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines,\nas listed in Table 1. Additional victims during the same period\ninclude organizations in Indonesia and Thailand. We attribute\nthis activity to a Chinese state-sponsored group that we track as\nThreat Activity Group 16 (TAG-16). We also identified evidence\nsuggesting that TAG-16 shares custom capabilities with the\nPeople’s Liberation Army (PLA)-linked activity group RedFoxtrot.\n\nIn November 2020, Bitdefender [reported on a TAG-16](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf)\ncampaign targeting Southeast Asian government institutions\nusing the Chinoxy, FunnyDream, and PCShare backdoors. While\n[the group behind this activity was unnamed, Kaspersky and PWC](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2020/96826/)\nhave also briefly referenced this FunnyDream campaign, with\nPWC tracking the group as Red Hariasa. In April 2021, we reported\non multiple government organizations across Vietnam, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines communicating with\nTAG-16 C2 infrastructure. In more recent activity, we identified\na swath of additional high-value victims following this same\ntargeting pattern within Southeast Asia and continued intrusions\ntargeting organizations identified as victims within our previous\nresearch. Victim organizations include the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: TAG-16 infrastructure cluster observed in targeting of SEA_\n\n###### Organization\n\nMinistry of Defense\n\nPrime Minister's Office\n\nRoyal Malaysia Police\n\nAnti-Corruption Commission (Suruhanjaya Pencegahan\nRasuah Malaysia)\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nPhilippine Navy\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)\n\nPresidential Management Staff\n\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs\n\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment (Department\nof Information Technology and Environment Resources Data\n(DINTE))\n\nVietnam National Assembly\n\nCentral Office of the Communist Party of Vietnam\n\nPrime Minister's Office\n\nRoyal Thai Army\n\nIndonesian Navy\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (Kementerian Luar Negeri Republik\nIndonesia)\n\nCabinet Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia\n\nCoordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs\n\n_Table 1: Sample of identified TAG-16 victims_\n\n|Organization|Country|\n|---|---|\n|Ministry of Defense|Malaysia|\n|Prime Minister's Office||\n|Royal Malaysia Police||\n|Anti-Corruption Commission (Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia)||\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs||\n|Philippine Navy|The Philippines|\n|Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)||\n|Presidential Management Staff||\n|Department of Foreign Affairs||\n|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Department of Information Technology and Environment Resources Data (DINTE))|Vietnam|\n|Vietnam National Assembly||\n|Central Office of the Communist Party of Vietnam||\n|Prime Minister's Office|Thailand|\n|Royal Thai Army||\n|Indonesian Navy||\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kementerian Luar Negeri Republik Indonesia)|Indonesia|\n|Cabinet Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia||\n|Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs||\n\n\n-----\n\n|SHA256 Hash|C2 Domain|\n|---|---|\n|c94d6649fe5c879ac2e4ccb313958736ac4c86f217c3a68c799f9641b6ac9f2a|www.rninhsss[.]com|\n|4ac3836414a384aee4c68e60eca54a848c8727a9e548de2b7ab76ecbd520107a|www.rninhsss[.]com|\n|9d0c2e8d0e2430c3e67b2677caff136e562570da162a371e9cfa6602c70b03bb|www.carelessnessing[.]com|\n|b3c811595a0edbed9524a1a71ee9292c19792370c99f856f765a39f80a437418|www.weekendorg[.]com|\n|a1859ce1575ab08b6c3dc2731cef31e358dd3ccfc7d6febaccb6a730bc1d58c0|www.weekendorg[.]com|\n|179d18ad80b718d861ea0b4b06ad885e0a7760051497db6eb87315f92dd24b53|www.weekendorg[.]com|\n|8f79333f2cc38d2259af81b6d0fbfb0731f1e3442c187b19a6538d0e7daf85df|www.dexercisep[.]com|\n|7a3d7f1dc1e5d42e278785149a382651c70a8f967a153e1960cffff5f92eaa33|www.dexercisep[.]com|\n|d12582262c06d6e0f68c62c891f469d819e18e0498fa2e9d277981f25eee93a1|www.aexhausts[.]com|\n|6543180ba4e195b4f80399aae593eb7554588b61e651fce81b91fefa56baec30|www.aexhausts[.]com|\n|c2dbaafccfb8c9121904629c1b643b99dfa934a2ec9f4bd8754ba3cad38b9a90|www.aexhausts[.]com|\n\n\n_Table 2: TAG-16 FunnyDream backdoor samples_\n\nWe identified multiple FunnyDream backdoor samples\nconfigured to communicate with the group’s C2 infrastructure.\nThese samples closely resemble FunnyDream samples previously\nreported by [Bitdefender and](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf) [NTT Security. Other researchers](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102glv5/pandas-new-arsenal-part-3-smanager.)\n[have noted a possible link between TAG-16 and the SManager](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102glv5/pandas-new-arsenal-part-3-smanager)\nbackdoor (also known as PhantomNet).\n\nSpecifically, an SManager sample referenced in NTT\nSecurity [reporting (SHA256: 00badf016953ec740b61f4ba27c](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102glv5/pandas-new-arsenal-part-3-smanager)\n5886a6460f6abba98819e00bde51574e0ebf4), was identified\ncontaining appended FunnyDream code and artifacts, such as the\nhardcoded TAG-16 C2 domain lotus.wmiprvse[.]com, PDB path\noverlap, and “funnydream” and “prettygirl” strings characteristic\nof older FunnyDream samples. However, the file name “igfx.exe.\nbak” suggests this sample may have been tampered with, leaving\nan assessment on the group’s possible access to SManager\ninconclusive at this time.\n\nPublicly reported activity related to SManager primarily\ndescribes campaigns targeting Vietnam, which also aligns to\nTAG-16 activity described in Insikt Group’s findings. Notably,\n[ESET identified a supply chain compromise targeting the Vietnam](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/17/operation-signsight-supply-chain-attack-southeast-asia/)\nGovernment Certification Authority (VGCA), where a digital\nsignature toolkit installer located on the VGCA website was\ncompromised to serve the SManager backdoor. However, despite\nTAG-16’s potential access to SManager, there is not sufficient\nevidence to link this supply chain compromise to this group at\nthis time given the prevalence of tool sharing across disparate\nChinese groups.\n\n\n[TAG-16 also shares a custom PCShare loader with the Chinese](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/379/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chinese-APT.pdf)\nactivity group RedFoxtrot, which Insikt Group linked to People’s\nLiberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 in June 2021. Both groups\nhave used the same loader to inject the open source PCShare\nbackdoor into memory. Despite this, the group’s targeting and\nwider toolset are distinct, and this very likely further reflects the\ncontinued sharing of capabilities across Chinese threat activity\ngroups.\n\n##### Belt and Road Initiative-Linked Targeting\n\nHistorically, many Chinese cyber espionage operations have\n[heavily](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor.html#:~:text=China's%20%E2%80%9COne%20Belt%2C%20One%20Road,influence%20across%20the%20greater%20region.)

Of particular note, we identified the targeting of\nboth the Lao National Committee for Special Economic Zones\nand the National Enterprise Database, which likely [aligns with](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Belt-and-Road/China-digs-Laos-in-deeper-with-flurry-of-SEZs)\nwider Chinese government economic and policy objectives under\nthe BRI.

This targeting likely serves several objectives,\nincluding traditional intelligence gathering against regional rivals\nand allies, economic intelligence gathering against BRI-linked\ntargets, and the South China Sea disputes. Future activity\ntargeting rival South China Sea claimants is likely to increase in\nline with geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe scale and scope of China’s cyber espionage program\nremain unrivaled, exemplified by the large number of distinct\nactors with operational taskings within specific geographic\nregions. The countries surrounding China bear the brunt of this\nactivity and are prime targets of many PLA Strategic Support\nForce (SSF) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked threat\nactivity groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy\n\nRecorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat\nactors and their activity, focusing on state actors from China,\nIran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals —\nindividuals and groups — from Russia, CIS states, China,\nIran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity groups and\nwhere possible, attributing them to nation state government,\norganizations, or affiliate institutions.\n\nOur coverage includes:\n\n\n**ADVERSARY**\n\n\n\n   - Government organizations and intelligence\nagencies, their associated laboratories, partners,\nindustry collaborators, proxy entities, and\nindividual threat actors\n\n   - Recorded Future-identified, suspected nationstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,\nRedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many\nother industry established groups\n\n   - Cybercriminal individuals and groups established\nand named by Recorded Future\n\n   - Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,\npersistent commodity malware\n\nInsikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group\nor campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically\nhave data corresponding to at least three points on the\nDiamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium\nconfidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity\nusing a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21\nwhere the activity is new and significant but doesn't map\nto existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged\ninto an established activity group. We tie this to a threat\nactor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person,\nor organization responsible. We will write about the activity\nas a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary\ndata. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a\nparticular group when the public body of empirical evidence\nis clear the activity corresponds to a known group.\n\nInsikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet\nnaming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups\nor campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that\nnation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be\nadded as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups\nassociated with new nations.\n\nFor newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt\nGroup uses a naming convention corresponding to the\nGreek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity\nconnected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate\ncountry color, and where that group may be tied to a specific\ngovernment organization, tie it to that entity specifically.\n\nInsikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming\nnewly identified malware.\n\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE** **CAPABILITY**\n\n**VICTIM**\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
