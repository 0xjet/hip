All of the known infected\nservers are web sites, which is causing the encrypted files to show up in Google search\nresults.\n\n[We first reported about Lilu in our The Week in Ransomware article on July 26th, 2019](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-july-26th-2019-state-of-emergency/)\n[when Michael Gillespie saw a sample uploaded to his ID Ransomware service. It was](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1152593459225739265)\n[spotted again yesterday by security researcher Benkow who tweeted about it.](https://twitter.com/benkow_/status/1169575406967635976?s=12)\n\nGoogle [reports over 6,000 search results with web servers that have been encrypted by this](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22%23README.lilocked%22+%22index+of%22)\nransomware and having their files renamed with a .lilocked extension. It should be noted\nthat many of these results are for the same web sites.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Google search results showing infected servers**\nFurthermore, submissions stats from ID Ransomware show that this infection has a low\nvolume, but steady, amount of submissions ot the ransomware identification service.\n\n\n-----\n\nID Ransomware submission stats\nIt is not known if Lilu is specifically targeting web servers, but most of the submitted files\nseen by BleepingComputer are related to web sites. When reviewing the submitted files,\nthere does not seem to be a pattern such as WordPress, Magento, or other commonly\nhacked CMS sites.\n\n## Attackers possibly using exploits to gain access\n\n[In response to Gillespie's tweet, one user reported that the attacker gained access to their](https://twitter.com/maztec/status/1158250770187182080)\nweb server using an Exim exploit. Gillespie further told BleepingComputer that another\nvictim felt that they were infected through an outdated WordPress installation.\n\n\n-----\n\nBleepingComputer has not been able to independently confirm if the attacker is using\nexploits to hack into the sites.\n\n## What's known about the Lilocked encryption process\n\nUnfortunately, a sample has never been found for the Lilocked, or Lilu, Ransomware, so not\nmuch is known about it other than what we can see in the wild.\n\nWhen a machine is infected, the ransomware will encrypt a file and then append the\n**.lilocked extension to the file name. For example, apple-icon.png would be encrypted and**\nrenamed to apple-icon.png.lilocked.\n\nFor each folder that is encrypted, Lilocked will also drop a ransom note\nnamed #README.lilocked.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted server in**\n\n**search results**\nThe #README.lilocked ransom note tells the victim that their data has been encrypted and\nthat they must go to the attacker's Tor payment site in order to pay a ransom. This ransom\nnote includes a key that is needed to login to the payment site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Lilu ransom note**\nIf a victim goes to the site, they will be presented with a page asking them to enter their key.\n\n**Lilu Tor payment site login**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the key is entered, they will be shown a page with instructions on how to pay the\nransom. These instructions include a bitcoin address and ransom amount, which is 0.010\nBTC or approximately $100 USD from the ransom demands seen by BleepingComputer.\n\n**Lilu payment instructions**\nAt this time, there is no known way to decrypt files encrypted by Lilu, but if a sample is\ndiscovered that may change.\n\nBleepingComputer has also reached out to the contact email listed on the Tor site with\nquestions, but had not heard back at the time of this publication.\n\n## IOCs:\n\n### Associated Files:\n```\n#README.lilocked\n\n Associated email:\nxijintao@tutanota.com\n\n Tor Payment Site:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ny7mfrrjkzql32nwcmgzwp3zxaqktqywrwvzfni4hm4sebtpw5kuhjzqd.onion\n\n### Ransom Note Text:\nI'VE ENCRYPTED ALL YOUR SENSITIVE DATA!!!
