This virus\nencrypts a computer’s files and then charges victims a fee to recover their data.\n\nOn May 12, the WCry virus is believed to have infected the British National Health Service,\nthe Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica, and the Russian company Megafon.\nThere are more than 45,000 infected computers around the world, according to the website\nIntel.malwaretech.com. Most cases so far have been in Russia, Ukraine, and Taiwan.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Russian online store Svyaznoy told the website Meduza that it is working to keep its\ncomputers from being infected by the WCry virus. Representatives from phone service\nprovider Beeline, meanwhile, told Meduza that the company successfully deflected a hacker\nattack on Friday.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter\n\n## Russia media is under attack.\n\nAt least 10 independent media outlets have been blocked or closed down over their\ncoverage of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Moscow Times needs your help more than ever as we cover this devastating invasion\nand its sweeping impacts on Russian society.\n\n[Contribute today](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/contribute?utm_source=contribute&utm_medium=internal-footer-bar) Maybe later\n\n\n-----",
