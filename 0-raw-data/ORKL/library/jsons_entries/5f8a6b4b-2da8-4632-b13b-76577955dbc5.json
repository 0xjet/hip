Government agencies, independent newspapers and public service providers need it to\nfunction and individuals need to communicate safely. Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG)\nhas been working around the clock, focusing on the safety and security of our users and the\nplatforms that help them access and share important information.\n\nThis work continues our longstanding efforts to take action against threat actors in this\nregion. In the last 12 months, TAG has issued hundreds of government-backed attack\nwarnings to Ukrainian users alerting them that they have been the target of government\nbacked hacking, largely emanating from Russia.\n\nOver the past two weeks, TAG has observed activity from a range of threat actors that we\nregularly monitor and are well-known to law enforcement, including FancyBear and\nGhostwriter. This activity ranges from espionage to phishing campaigns. We’re sharing this\ninformation to help raise awareness among the security community and high risk users:\n\n**FancyBear/APT28, a threat actor attributed to Russia GRU, has conducted several large**\ncredential phishing campaigns targeting ukr.net users, UkrNet is a Ukrainian media company.\nThe phishing emails are sent from a large number of compromised accounts (non\n\n-----\n\nGmail/Google), and include links to attacker controlled domains.\n\nIn two recent campaigns, the attackers used newly created Blogspot domains as the initial\nlanding page, which then redirected targets to credential phishing pages. All known attackercontrolled Blogspot domains have been taken down.\n\nExample of APT28 credential phishing page\n\nExample credential phishing domains observed during these campaigns:\n\nid-unconfirmeduser[.]frge[.]io\nhatdfg-rhgreh684[.]frge[.]io\nua-consumerpanel[.]frge[.]io\nconsumerspanel[.]frge[.]io\n\n**Ghostwriter/UNC1151, a Belarusian threat actor, has conducted credential phishing**\ncampaigns over the past week against Polish and Ukrainian government and military\norganizations. TAG has also identified campaigns targeting webmail users from the following\nproviders:\n\ni.ua\nmeta.ua\nrambler.ru\nukr.net\nwp.pl\nyandex.ru\n\nExample credential phishing domains observed during these campaigns:\n\n\n-----\n\naccounts[.]secure-ua[.]website\ni[.]ua-passport[.]top\nlogin[.]creditals-email[.]space\npost[.]mil-gov[.]space\nverify[.]rambler-profile[.]site\n\n[These phishing domains have been blocked through Google Safe Browsing – a service that](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\nidentifies unsafe websites across the web and notifies users and website owners of potential\nharm.\n\n**Mustang Panda or Temp.Hex, a China-based threat actor, targeted European entities with**\nlures related to the Ukrainian invasion. TAG identified malicious attachments with file names\nsuch as ['Situation at the EU borders with Ukraine.zip'. Contained within the zip file is an](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8a7fbafe9f3395272548e5aadeb1af07baeb65d7859e7a1560f580455d7b1fac/)\nexecutable of the same name that is a basic downloader and when executed, downloads\nseveral additional files that load the final payload. To mitigate harm, TAG alerted relevant\nauthorities of its findings.\n\nTargeting of European organizations has represented a shift from Mustang Panda’s regularly\nobserved Southeast Asian targets.\n\n**DDoS Attacks**\n\nWe continue to see DDoS attempts against numerous Ukraine sites, including the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as services like Liveuamap that are\n[designed to help people find information. We expanded eligibility for Project Shield, our free](https://projectshield.withgoogle.com/landing)\nprotection against DDoS attacks, so that Ukrainian government websites, embassies\nworldwide and other governments in close proximity to the conflict can stay online, protect\nthemselves and continue to offer their crucial services and ensure access to the information\npeople need.\n\nProject Shield allows Google to absorb the bad traffic in a DDoS attack and act as a “shield”\nfor websites, allowing them to continue operating and defend against these attacks. As of\ntoday, over 150 websites in Ukraine, including many news organizations, are using the\n[service. We encourage all eligible organizations to register for Project Shield so our systems](https://support.projectshield.withgoogle.com/s/?language=en_US)\ncan help block these attacks and keep websites online.\n\nWe’ll continue to take action, identify bad actors and share relevant information with others\nacross industry and governments, with the goal of bringing awareness to these issues,\nprotecting users and preventing future attacks. And while we are actively monitoring activity\nrelated to Ukraine and Russia, we continue to be just as vigilant in relation to other threat\nactors globally, to ensure that they do not take advantage of everyone’s focus on this region.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
