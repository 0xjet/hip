It has a very low volume in this two-year period, totaling\nroughly 27 total samples. The malware is delivered via an innovative and unique technique:\na downloader we are calling Carp uses malicious macros in Microsoft Excel documents to\n[compile embedded C# (C Sharp) Programming Language source code into an executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))\nthat in turn is run to deploy the Cardinal RAT malware family. These malicious Excel files use\na number of different lures, providing evidence of what attackers are using to entice victims\ninto executing them.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware from start to finish exhibits the following high level operations as shown in\nFigure 1:\n\n_Figure 1 Malware execution flow_\n\n## Carp Downloader\n\nAs previously mentioned, we have observed Cardinal RAT being delivered using a unique\ntechnique involving malicious Excel macros. We are calling these delivery documents the\nCarp Downloader, as they make use of a specific technique of compiling and executing\nembedded C# (CshARP) language source code that acts as a simple downloader.\n\nWe observed the following example macro in the most recent sample. Note that we have\nprefixed the function names with ‘xx_’ to make it easier for the reader to understand what is\ngoing on. Additionally, we have added comments to explain what is happening, as well as\nthe un-obfuscated strings that are found within the macro.\n\n_Figure 2 Portion of malicious macro containing base64-encoded source code_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Portion of malicious macro responsible for compiling and executing embedded_\n_source code_\n\nAs a quick recap of what the malicious macro is doing, it begins by generating two paths—a\npath to a randomly named executable, and randomly named C# file in the\n%APPDATA%\\\\Microsoft folder. It then base64-decodes the embedded C# source code as\nshown in Figure 2 and writes it to the C# file path previously generated. Finally, as shown in\nFigure 3 it will compile and execute this C# source code using the Microsoft Windows built-in\n[csc.exe utility.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/78f4aasd.aspx)\n\nThe decoded source code in this example looks like the following as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Decoded source code_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we can see, it simply downloads a file from secure.dropinbox[.]pw using HTTP on port\n443 (not HTTPS), and proceeds to decrypt the file using AES-128 prior to executing it. At this\npoint, Cardinal RAT has been downloaded and executed, and execution is directed to this\nsample. Of course, the Carp Downloader is not required to download Cardinal RAT, however,\nbased on our visibility, it has exclusively done so.\n\nA total of 11 unique Carp Downloader samples have been observed to date. The following\nfigures show lures that we observed in these samples.\n\n_Figure 5 Lure with a filename of Top10Binary_Sample_HotLeads_13.9.xls_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Lure with a filename of AC_Media_Leads_ReportGenerator_5.2.xls_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Lure with an unknown filename_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Lure with a filename of Arabic 22.12_Pre qualified.xls_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Lure with an unknown filename_\n\n_Figure 10 Lure with a filename of Hot_Leads_Export_09.03_EN.xls_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we can see from the above examples, the majority of these lures are financial-related,\ndescribing various fake customer lists for various organizations. Based on the similarities\nwitnessed in some of these lures, it appears that the attackers use some sort of template,\nwhere they simply swap specific cells with the pertinent images or information.\n\n## Cardinal RAT\n\nThe name Cardinal RAT comes from internal names used by the author within the observed\nMicrosoft .NET Framework executables. To date, 27 unique samples of Cardinal RAT have\nbeen observed, dating back to December 2015. It is likely that the low volume of samples\nseen in the wild is partly responsible for the fact that this malware family has remained under\nthe radar for so long.\n\nAn unobfuscated copy of Cardinal RAT was identified, which allowed us to view the\ndecompiled class and function names. A subset of these may be seen below in Figure 11.\nThis allowed us to not only easily identify the full functionality of the RAT, but also made it\neasier to identify and reverse-engineer various aspects of the malware itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Decompiled Cardinal RAT classes_\n\nWhen initially executed, the malware will check its current working directory. Should it not\nmatch the expected path, Cardinal will enter its installation routine. Cardinal RAT will copy\nitself to a randomly named executable in the specified directory. It will then compile and\nexecute embedded source code that contains watchdog functionality. Specifically, this newly\nspawned executable will ensure that the following registry key is set:\n\nHKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows\\\\Load\n\nThis specific key is set to point towards the path of the previously copied Cardinal RAT\nexecutable path. The executable will periodically query this registry key to ensure it is set\nappropriately. If the executable finds the registry key has been deleted, it will re-set it. The\nLoad registry key acts as a persistence mechanism, ensuring that this Cardinal RAT\nexecutes every time a user logs on. More information about the Load registry key may be\n[found here.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee851671.aspx)\n\nThis watchdog process also ensures that the Cardinal RAT process is always running, as\nwell as ensures that the executable is located in the correct path. Should either of these\nconditions not be met, the watchdog process will spawn a new instance of Cardinal RAT, or\nwrite Cardinal RAT to the correct location, respectively.\n\nAfter the installation routine, Cardinal RAT will inject itself into a newly spawned process. It\nwill attempt to use one of the following installed executables for the newly spawned process:\n\nRegAsm.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nRegSvcs.exe\nvbc.exe\ncsc.exe\nAppLaunch.exe\ncvtres.exe\n\nCardinal RAT will continue to parse an embedded configuration. This configuration, named\ninternally as ‘GreyCardinalConfig’, is a binary blob that contains a mixture of base64encoded data, DWORDs, and Boolean values. Using a custom written Python script, we\nparsed the configuration of an example sample:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n\n$ python decode_parse_config.py GreyCardinalConfig\nMutex: cpS3H2NSA65T67mUqB3a\nGUID: 952407f889285547985aa2fcf35c5383\nCampaign: 04/04/2016 Public\nNumber of C2 Servers: 1\nC2 Server: secure[.]affiliatetoday[.]xyz\nPort: 4425\nCommunication Key: H7sVBirLvGwVfLSLSeI2\nConnection Delay: 3500\nBuffer Size: 20480\nMax Buffer Size: 40960000\nUnknown Integer: 70000\nPrevent System Sleeping: 0\nHide File: 0\nDie on Sandbox Detection: 0\nKeylogging: 1\nInstall Name: None\n\n\nAs we can see, this particular sample is configured with a single command and control (C2)\nserver, however, we have seen other samples with multiple host and port combinations. We\ncan also identify a communication key in it, which is crucial when discussing network\ncommunications.\n\nAfter the configuration is parsed, Cardinal RAT will proceed with making attempts at\nconnecting with the C2. Using an example request and response from a C2 server, we can\nsee how this traffic is configured.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 Parsed network traffic communication_\n\nData is transmitted in two pieces—a DWORD specifying the data length, as well as the data\nitself. The data is encrypted using a series of XOR and addition operations, followed by\ndecompression using the ZLIB library. Represented in Python, this may be implemented as\nfollows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n\ndef decrypt(md5_key, data):\nkey = data[-1]\nremaining = data[0:-1]\nc = 0\nout = \"\"\nfor x in remaining:\nb = md5_key[c%len(md5_key)]\nout += chr(ord(x) ^ ord(b) + ord(key) & 255)\nc+=1\nif len(out) > 15:\nif ord(out[0]) == 1:\nout = zlib.decompress(out[1:], -15)\nreturn out\n\n\nThe ‘md5_key’ argument in the function above is the MD5 hash of the previously defined\n‘H7sVBirLvGwVfLSLSeI2’ string that was contained within Cardinal RAT’s embedded\nconfiguration. Now that we know how to decrypt the data, we can look at the previously\nshown PCAP data and determine what is being sent. The first message decrypts to the\nfollowing:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n$ python decrypt_cardinal_pcap.py\nData Length: 3\n00000000: 00 00\n\n\nFollowed by the Cardinal RAT’s response:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n$ python decrypt_cardinal_pcap.py\nData Length: 148\n00000000: 00 95 24 07 F8 89 28 55 47 98 5A A2 FC F3 5C 53 ..$...(UG.Z...\\S\n00000010: 83 4A 00 61 00 73 00 6F 00 6E 00 20 00 42 00 6F .J.a.s.o.n. .B.o\n00000020: 00 72 00 6E 00 00 00 4A 00 41 00 53 00 4F 00 4E .r.n...J.A.S.O.N\n00000030: 00 42 00 4F 00 52 00 4E 00 2D 00 50 00 43 00 00 .B.O.R.N.-.P.C..\n00000040: 00 30 00 34 00 2F 00 30 00 34 00 2F 00 32 00 30 .0.4./.0.4./.2.0\n00000050: 00 31 00 36 00 20 00 50 00 75 00 62 00 6C 00 69 .1.6. .P.u.b.l.i\n00000060: 00 63 00 00 00 57 00 69 00 6E 00 64 00 6F 00 77 .c...W.i.n.d.o.w\n00000070: 00 73 00 20 00 37 00 20 00 55 00 6C 00 74 00 69 .s. .7. .U.l.t.i\n00000080: 00 6D 00 61 00 74 00 65 00 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 .m.a.t.e. ......\n00000090: 00 00 31 00 2E 00 34 00 00 00 30 00 37 00 38 00 ..1...4...0.7.8.\n000000A0: 42 00 46 00 42 00 46 00 44 00 30 00 30 00 30 00 B.F.B.F.D.0.0.0.\n000000B0: 33 00 30 00 36 00 44 00 32 00 00 00       3.0.6.D.2...\n\n\n-----\n\nThis communication represents the C2 server asking the Cardinal RAT to retrieve and upload\nvictim information (‘\\x00\\x00’), to which the malware responds accordingly. As we can see in\nthe above decrypted stream, the malware returns a wealth of information, including the\nfollowing:\n\nUsername\nHostname\nCampaign Identifier\nMicrosoft Windows version\nVictim unique identifier\nProcesser architecture\nMalware version (1.4)\n\nThe malware itself is equipped with a number of features, including the following:\n\nCollect victim information\nUpdate settings\nAct as a reverse proxy\nExecute command\nUninstall itself\nRecover passwords\nDownload and Execute new files\nKeylogging\nCapture screenshots\nUpdate Cardinal RAT\nClean cookies from browsers\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCardinal RAT is deployed using an interesting technique of compiling and executing a\ndownloader via a malicious macro embedded within a Microsoft Excel file. The Excel files\nthemselves contain lures that have financial themes. This threat has had a low volume of\nsamples in the past two years, with 11 instances of Carp Downloader and 27 instances of\nCardinal RAT observed.
