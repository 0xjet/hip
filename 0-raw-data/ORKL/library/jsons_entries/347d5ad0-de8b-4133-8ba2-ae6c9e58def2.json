It is now\nrising again, however, due to a second\nwave of CDNs.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n###### The economic crisis caused by the pandemic, for which no country was prepared, has laid bare a number of problems in today’s soci- ety. Both developing and developed countries have suffered and continue to suffer enormous losses. The world’s industries have been desperately trying to survive and are searching for new strategies to ensure global stability. Analysts estimate that, over the next two years, the coronavirus pandemic will strip the world economy of some $5.5 trillion[1]. People are losing their health, their lives, their loved ones, their jobs, their businesses… The situation is becoming a global disaster whose consequences will be felt for decades to come. To make matters worse, this is when cybercrime rears its ugly head.\n\n For more than 17 years, Group-IB has been researching the tactics, tools, and monetization schemes used by various cybercriminal groups and individuals whose overall damage to governments worldwide amounts to billions of dollars. We are acutely aware of the cyclic nature of this phenomenon. For cybercriminals, any crisis is a time of prosperity. While for most people financial insta- bility casts aside anything other than survival, criminals raise their profits by taking vast sums of money out of people’s pockets and economies. One shadow economy channel is online piracy.\n\n The fight against this disease within the media industry has been ongoing for some 20 years, but it is only recently that the scale of the piracy business has escalated to such a colossal extent. Russian-speaking cybercriminal conglomerates are no longer con- tent with income that comes solely from video content consum- ers in Russia and other post-Soviet countries. They have started branching out into international markets, mainly in developing countries. This gives them opportunities to increase the capitaliza- tion of their shadow businesses manifold.\n\n The US media industry — the largest in the world — is also suffer- ing losses because of piracy. The Global Innovation Policy Center of the US Chamber of Commerce estimates that online piracy costs the US economy up to $29.2 billion[2].\n\n It has become obvious that pirate resources[3] have adapted to pressure from copyright holders. Pirate infrastructures are resilient to new technologies and certain legal initiatives. Pirates’ main investors are still illegal bookmakers, casinos, and alcohol suppliers, or in other words: the entire black market, which spon- sors camrip groups[4], translators, and IT infrastructures for pirated content.\n\n[1 \u0007 Bloomberg citing JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/world-economy-faces-5-trillion-hit-that-is-like-losing-japan)\n\n[2 \u0007 \u0007https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Digital-Video-Piracy.pdf](https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Digital-Video-Piracy.pdf)\n\n3 \u0007Hereinafter, in this report the pirate resources are defined as resources that had faced claims\nof copyright holders over copyright infringements, as well as resources included in the lists\nof violators of exclusive rights, compiled by competent authorities of different countries.\n\n4 \u0007 \u0007Pirate groups that specialize in recording the on-screen projections of movies (most often\nfiction film premiers) and their editing for the purposes of publishing them online.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The shadow economy is not alone to facilitate piracy, however. The industry has capacities to host and stream videos that are often bought by pirate platforms from legal hosting services with impunity. Pirate websites embed video players belonging to one or several CDNs and monetize the content by showing ads. Users can freely visit pirate websites, mainly through search engines or social media. Meanwhile, pirates have been making themselves increasingly richer by using processing services of banks, which inadvertently act as accomplices.\n\n Eliminating a single component of the pirate Hydra will not kill it. It will simply regenerate. The war on it must be waged on all fronts. This is the only way to cure cyberspace, develop immunity to piracy, not just in Russia but in international markets too, and stop its out- breaks as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 45%\n\nof pirate websites, primarily watched\nby the Russians, use the content\nprovided by Collaps CDN\n\n#### $21,000+\n\nmade by bookmakers with\nwell‑developed partner\nprograms per month\n\n\n## Objectives\n\n###### The purpose of this report is to deliver a devastating blow to cyber- crime: to expose the entire structure of online piracy, to uncover the key organizations that sponsor this activity and those behind them.\n\n Group-IB’s report contains confidential data, including informa- tion on individuals believed to be behind some of the key piracy industry players. Copies of this report have been provided to the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office, Russian and international law enforcement agencies.\n\n As an international company, Group-IB is calling on the media industry, on regulating authorities, and on international organiza- tions interested in fighting cybercrime to work together and help dismantle a business that has been developing for years, draining blood and cancelling the efforts of copyright holders worldwide.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n###### Shadow investors in online piracy. As part of their anti-piracy and brand protection activities, Group-IB specialists used the follow- the-money approach to identify who profited from unlawful activity. They found that illegal casinos and bookmaker companies were the main beneficiaries and drivers of illicit video streaming ser- vices and pirated sports streaming services. The leaders of the illegal casino market are Welcome Partners and Lucky Partners.\n\n Taking advantage of geopolitical tensions. Those behind one of the most popular CDNs, Collaps, which provides content to 45% of pirate websites primarily watched by the Russians, are based in Ukraine which allows them to continue unlawful activity.\n\n Use of Russian banks and international payment systems in crim- inal schemes. Despite most of their owners residing in Ukraine, popular online casinos have been using Russian banks to receive payments as part of their monetization schemes. None of the banks classify this type of activity as MCC[5] 7995.\n\n Symbiosis of gambling and pirated online traffic. Next to films and TV series, sports streaming is becoming a new source of reve- nue for pirates. The main advertisers in this case are quasi-legal bookmakers: 1xBet, Melbet, Parimatch, Linebet, Orca88, Bwin, and others. A streaming service’s average revenue is between 20% and 40% of the sum lost by the gamblers it attracted (depending on the partner program). Well-developed partner programs help bookmakers make more than $21,000 per month (for a website with an average of 70-80 gamblers attracted daily).\n\n5 \u0007 \u0007Merchant Category Code is a four-digit number used to classify a particular\nbusiness when a bank card payment is made.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 500+\n\ntotal camrip releases\nmade by 1xBet in 2018\n\n#### 270+\n\nTotal titles covered\nby 1xBet in 2018\n\n\n###### Russian-speaking cybercrime in international markets. After being blocked in Russia, shadow bookmakers shifted their focus to:\n\n • Latin America (mainly Brazil);\n • India;\n • Thailand.\n\n Having polished their schemes in Russia (which has traditionally been used as a testing ground for cybercrime), they started enter- ing markets with similar characteristics: developing countries, non-English speaking regions, populations with low financial liter- acy, and countries where sports streaming is highly popular.\n\n This situation resulted in a symbiosis of gambling companies and pirated content. Since 2015, 1xBet has allegedly sponsored con- tent for 17 TV show voiceover studios (i.e. 80% of major voiceover studios). 1xBet is one of the main sponsors of illegal distribution of TV series in the post-Soviet region. What’s more, in 2018 1xBet started creating content for other countries:\n\n Total releases: over 500.\n\n Total titles covered: over 270.\n\n Distribution by language:\n\n • 100%[6] of camrips are in English;\n • 14% of camrips are in Spanish;\n • \u00075% of camrips are in other languages (Tamil (predominantly spoken in India’s South), Portuguese, Thai, Hindi, and others).\n\n Evasion of technical blocking and lawful prosecution. Content delivery networks (CDNs) play a key role in online piracy. They are services that aggregate pirated content and optimize its delivery to the customer. They supply up to 80% of illegal video streaming services in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.\n\n The characteristics of second-wave CDNs are:\n\n • frequent changes of technical domains and IP pools;\n • use of geographically distributed infrastructures;\n • \u0007duplicate and reserve content delivery channels, which are  usually rented from various Internet service providers.\n\n These measures have made the currently enforced practices stip- ulated in anti-piracy legislation ineffective.\n\n Exploitation of legal hosting services’ capacities. Group-IB stud- ied the activities of several pirate groups. Analyses of their techni- cal infrastructures revealed that they systematically used capaci- ties belonging to Russian companies.\n\n6 \u0007 \u0007One camrip can be in several languages (e.g. in English and dubbed in Spanish).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 23%\n\nof 3,100 pirate resources analyzed\nduring the pandemic posed risks\nto users\n\n#### 76.8 mln\n\nis the amount of total visits\nto dangerous resources in March\n\n\n###### Having analyzed the number of CDNs utilizing Mnogobyte’s infra- structure, we determined that the company Mnogobyte is likely to be one of the leaders in providing hosting services for pirate CDNs.[7] A copyright holder’s complaint about pirate services being hosted by a hosting service will yield no results because unique links created for each user individually cannot be opened by any- one else. This means that a hosting service whose servers are used by pirate CDNs has all formal grounds to remove themselves from handling the matter, absolve themselves from any responsibil- ity, and continue to make money by providing a platform for pirate businesses.\n\n In addition, analyses revealed a number of network addresses that serviced pirate websites and officially belonged to a company called DDOS-GUARD. The company regularly ensures the opera- tion of services that engage in unlawful activity, thereby essentially providing tools for committing offences.\n\n Infection of pirated content with malware. The growing number of online users goes hand in hand with increased fraud and more criminal groups that operate online. Because of how popular they are, pirate websites (streaming services, torrent trackers, etc.) act as platforms for distributing malware and stealing users’ money and personal data. During the pandemic, Group-IB checked over 3,100 pirated content websites for viruses, vulnerabilities, and inclusion in blacklists compiled by antivirus providers and search engines. The analysis revealed that up to 23% of pirate resources posed risks to users. In March, the number of total visits to danger- ous resources amounted to 76.8 million. Most of these resources were in the .RU domain.\n\n7 \u0007 \u0007The main outcomes of this analysis are provided in the Infrastructure of pirate CDNs chapter.\nAll the details can be provided at the formal request of competent authorities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CDN service Moonwalk\n\nwas blocked by the anti-piracy groups\nBREIN, ACE and MPA in October 2019\nafter Group-IB`s report was released\n\n\n## Introduction to video piracy\n\n###### The current situation on the online piracy market is developing against the background of the actively enforced anti-piracy law and cooperation between copyright holders and popular search engines.\n\n In addition, the closure of major first-wave pirate CDN services had a significant impact on the market. After Group-IB’s report was released, in October 2019 the anti-piracy groups BREIN, ACE, and MPA took down Moonwalk, the most popular CDN service at the time. Acting on behalf of these groups, law enforcement officers disabled the servers — which ensured Moonwalk’s opera- tion — belonging to three Dutch hosting services and two overseas companies whose servers were physically located in the Neth- erlands. The shutdown of Moonwalk led to the closure of a major CDN HDGO, with another provider, Kodik, losing a significant part of its content. Both used the same infrastructure as Moonwalk.\n\n Under such conditions, the behavior of pirate website administra- tors is characterized by a desire to eliminate risks by:\n\n\n###### 1. 2.\n\n\n**Diversifying content sources**\n\nMany pirate websites use several CDNs at once in case one\nof them fails. In addition, CDN aggregators such as Yohoho,\nEmblix, Uitools, and others are becoming increasingly popular.\nAggregators track content on all major CDNs and provide their\nown video players, which makes it possible to switch CDNs\nat the user’s discretion.\n\n\n**Optimizing database provisioning**\n\nPirate website administrators who are constantly forced\nto create new websites due to blocking have a myriad of modules and scripts that help them quickly transfer and recover\ndatabases. To sync pirate databases, they use film IDs\nof major specialized portals such as Kinopoisk and IMDB.\n\n\n###### 3. 4.\n\n\n**Shifting from quality to quantity**\n\nPirates used to put most of their efforts into developing\na small number of websites operated simultaneously. Due\nto search engine results being actively blocked and cleared,\nhowever, this tactic is being used less and less often, mainly\nby blocked major websites whose owners rely on their audiences’ loyalty despite the need to use blocking evasion tools.\nOther webmasters prefer attracting traffic by creating many\nidentical sites. This way, losing one site will not result in any\nsignificant negative consequences.\n\n\n**Increasing the share of new CDNs**\n**that use Russian infrastructure**\n\nThe shift in focus to Russian Internet service providers\nis connected to three factors: (i) the seizure of the Dutch\nservers that hosted Moonwalk, HDGO, and Kodik; (ii) the\navailability of Russian services; and (iii) the lack of successful\nand tangible legal action against Russian Internet service\nproviders that offer their capacities to pirate websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### up to 80%\n\nof pirate video streaming services\nin Russia and other post-Soviet\ncountries are provided with content\nfrom CDNs\n\n\n###### The current structure of the pirated video market comprises:\n\n 1. \u0007Specialized advertising networks (bookmakers, casinos, alcohol, etc.) that sponsor camrip groups, translators, CDNs, and pirate websites. 2. \u0007CDNs that offer their capacities for video hosting and\n streaming. In turn, these capacities are purchased by pirate platforms from legal hosting services. 3. \u0007Pirate websites that embed the players belonging to one or more CDNs and monetize content by displaying ads to users. 4. \u0007Users who visit pirate websites mainly through search engines and social media.\n\n CDNs play a key role in online piracy. These services aggregate pirated content, optimize its delivery to the end user, and help video streaming services make money through partner programs. CDNs provide content to up to 80% of pirate video streaming ser- vices in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.\n\n CDNs are not hosting services or communications service provid- ers. Instead, they use server capacities provided by other (legiti- mate) Internet service providers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The main problem that copyright holders face when interacting with CDNs is that their complaints are ignored and their demands are met on paper only. In particular, many CDNs create links for specific users or devices using tokens. Moreover, these links often function for a limited time only. Complaints about such links are ineffective because the links change regularly, while illegal content continues to be distributed. CDNs take no measures against viola- tors, thereby encouraging unlawful activity.\n\n Legal hosting services whose servers are used by CDNs usually refuse to handle the issue and evade responsibility by giving formal replies that given links are unavailable.\n\n At the moment, the main CDNs are:\n\n • Collaps\n • HDVB\n • VideoCDN\n • Kodik\n • Videoframe\n • Bazon\n • Ustore\n • Alloha\n • Protonvideo\n\n The specific characteristics of second-wave CDNs are:\n\n • frequent changes of technical domains and IP pools;\n • use of geographically distributed infrastructures;\n • \u0007duplicate and reserve content delivery channels, which are usu- ally rented from various providers.\n\n A number of the largest streaming services (e.g. Hdrezka) have their own servers designed to store and deliver video content. In most cases, however, these servers are not used by other resources since they do not involve partner programs and there- fore bring no profit.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threat of pirate websites\n\n 3,100\n\npirated content websites were\nscreened by Group-IB during the\npandemic\n\n###### 1.\n\n**Safe websites**\n\nVisiting these websites did not entail\nany risks to users.\n\n#### ±23%\n\nof 3,100 pirate resources analyzed\nduring the pandemic posed risks\nto users\n\n#### 76.8 mln\n\nis the amount of total visits\nto dangerous resources in March\n\n\n###### Analysis revealed that up to 23% of pirate resources posed risks to users.

These sites can be both sources of threats (if their administrators are threat actors) and targets for other threat actors.\n\n During the pandemic, Group-IB screened over 3,100 pirated con- tent websites for viruses, vulnerabilities, and inclusion in blacklists compiled by antivirus software providers and search engines.\n\n The resources were divided into three risk categories:\n\n\n###### 2.\n\n**Relatively safe websites**\n\nNo threats were detected on these\nwebsites. However, analysis revealed\nvarious vulnerabilities that could potentially be used for unlawful activities.\nSuch vulnerabilities are most often the\nresult of outdated or hacked software\n(e.g. CMS[8]).\n\n\n###### 3.\n\n**Dangerous websites**\n\nThese are websites where various\nthreats (including malware) were\ndetected or websites that have been\nincluded in blacklists compiled by antivirus software providers and search\nengines.\n\n\n-----\n\n.RU 24%\n\n.NET 11.1%\n\n.ONLINE 7.2%\n\n.COM 6.7%\n\n.ORG 5.7%\n\n.SITE 4.2%\n\n.XYZ 4.0%\n\n.TOP 3.1%\n\n.CLUB 3.1%\n\n.INFO 3.1%\n\n.ME 2.6%\n\n.CC 2.6%\n\n.FUN 1.8%\n\n.SU 1.6%\n.PW 1.5%\n\n.BIZ 1.5%\n\n.PRO 1.3%\n\n.TV 1.1%\n\n.CO 0.9%\n\n.ML 0.8%\n\nOTHERS 12.1%\n\n\n###### Most pirate resources use outdated or hacked software as well as custom-made parts of code, all of which can contain vulnera- bilities. The two main reasons for this are a desire to save on the costs of creating and operating a website and the fact that some administrators have poor technical skills.\n\n The fact that most dangerous resources are in the .RU domain also supports this claim. Experienced webmasters tend to use overseas domains, including offshore ones, to host their resources. Registering a pirate resource in the .RU domain is easier for beginners, although it does involve legal risks. At the same time, these webmasters do not always have the necessary technical knowledge and tools to ensure that their resources are safe.\n\n Distribution of dangerous  resources by type:\n\n**2%**\nOther\n\n**30%**\nTorrent\n\n**68%**\nStreaming\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Infrastructure Collaps of pirate CDNs Collaps is one of the most popular CDNs. We believe that its orga\n###### nizers are from Ukraine. They are also the creators of two large pirate streaming services, Baskino and Hdrezka. As at late 2019, 45% of pirate streaming services used this CDN.[9]\n\n The main domain is collaps.org. Video players are placed on third- level technical domains, with formats including *.delivembed. cc, *.multikland.net, *.ellinagraypel.com, *. iframecdn.club, and *.apicollaps.\n\n At the moment, access to many of them is restricted. To bypass blocking, the service promptly generates new technical domains and regularly changes its IP pool. New domains are created according to the template api*.(multikland.net|delivembed.cc|elli- nagraypel.com) and using the function JavaScript Date.Now().\n\n The content is distributed using technical domains with the for- mats *.s2w3.space, *.pixars.org, and *.embedcdn.cc. The links were found between the CDN Collaps and the pirate streaming services Baskino and Hdrezka.\n\n This assumption is based on the following facts:\n\n 1. \u0007The domains collaps.org and baskino.club used to have the same Google Analytics ID (UA-131285663). At the moment, this ID is used by more than 50 pirate websites, including bzserial. online, hd-kino.info, kino-tyr.ru, kinogram.life, and anilive.su. 2. \u0007The current domain http://baskino.me has only Collaps and Hdrezka video players embedded. 3. \u0007A person, whose personal details match those of the official\n representative of the Baskino website on VKontakte, a social networking site (https://vk.com/baskino), is mentioned as the registrar for numerous Hdrezka mirror websites (e.g. hdrez- ka-ag.com, mrhdrezka.com, betahdrezka.com, myhdrezka.com, newhdrezka.com, aghdrezka.com, wehdrezka.com, nuhdrezka. com, instahdrezka.com).\n\n9 \u0007 \u0007Hereinafter, the share of pirate websites using a particular CDN is shown in relation to the\ntotal number of pirate websites analyzed.

As at late 2019, 38% of pirate streaming services used this CDN.\n\n Video traffic comes from regularly updated domains: *tesswalton. pw, *bernardjordan.pw, *elmerwatson.pw, *alfredcurry.pw, *quinn- nash.pw, *frankfoley.pw, *rexhammond.pw, *janenoble.pw, *nadia- pattel.pw, etc. The domains are generated mainly in the .pw domain zone according to the template vb{some_number}{random_name_ surname}.pw. It also hosts video players.\n\n The CDN’s domains are regularly blocked by Roskomnadzor (Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) in accordance with the procedure established in Article 15.2 of Russian Federal Law No. 149-FZ of July 27, 2006 “On Information, Information Technologies, and Protection of Information,” which leads to new ones being cre- ated constantly.

Melbet partner program in the\nfirst month\n\n#### $21,000+\n\nmade by bookmakers with\nwell‑developed partner\nprograms per month\n\n\n## The economics of illegal resources\n\n###### As part of their anti-piracy and brand protection activities, Group-IB specialists used the follow-the-money approach to identify who profited from unlawful activities.\n\n It was found that illegal casinos and bookmakers were the main beneficiaries and drivers of illicit video streaming services and pirated sports video streaming services.\n\n Although other monetization methods exist, online casino and book- maker partner programs are still the main way to generate income in the piracy business.\n\n Pirate websites act as advertising platforms designed to attract new users. In most gambling partner programs, compensation is a per- centage of the sum lost by online players.\n\n For the largest partners, other terms can be established accord- ing to the CPA (cost per action) model. In this case, compensation is paid for an agreed list of player actions and does not depend on the sum lost.\n\n There are usually three kinds of advertising materials:\n\n • partner links;\n • promo codes;\n • banners.\n\n Partner links and banners are most often used on websites, while broadcasts and videos contain promo codes and ads of their own domains.\n\n To keep statistics and track visits, links and banners have unique IDs (referral codes) that help identify what website a user has come from. If advertising is embedded into streamed video content, promo codes are used for the same purpose. To ensure that promo codes are used during registration, players are offered a small bonus, often paid by the organizer of the pirate video broadcast (the bonus is later subtracted from the final compensation for the online player the orga- nizer attracted).\n\n The bonuses mean that it is more profitable for players to register using referral links or promo codes. Active players, let alone those addicted to gambling, can have multiple accounts to diversify risks related to money withdrawal and account blocking.\n\n The main advertisers in sports streaming are 1xBet, Melbet, Parimatch, Linebet, Orca88, Bwin, and others. A streaming service’s average revenue is between 20% and 40% of the sum lost by the players it attracted (depending on the partner program).\n\n As compensation is dependent on how lucky the online players are, it is impossible to forecast the revenue for each project. Moreover, passive income from previously attracted players grows over time.\n\n As part of the Melbet partner program, beginners make $140 in their first month on average (for resources with over 7,000 subscribers and more than 14,000 views per day).\n\n Customers who take part in the Melbet program for a long time can reach revenues of up to $21,000 per month (for resources with an average of 70-80 players attracted daily).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Statistics:[10]\n\nExample of revenue from the partner program forum*\n\n###### Although some partner program participants have high profits, it should be noted that online casinos and bookmakers often use schemes to reduce commission sums. For example, regular pay- ments may be delayed or cancelled altogether under various pre- texts. Traffic and the number of players attracted may be underre- ported, as may sums lost by the players. Statistics may be mixed with fake data simulating frequently winning players. What’s more, nearly all bookmakers cut the account balances for players who have considerable profits in the long run. As a result, accounts belonging to partner program participants may even fall below zero.\n\n10 \u0007The statistics were provided by participants of the Melbet partner program. This may have\nbeen done for advertising purposes and the information might not be factual or accurate.\n\n- Hereinafter screenshots in Russian will be provided together with a translation into English\u0007\n\n\n-----\n\nReviews by scammed webmasters\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 1xBet\n\n**Founded:**\n\n2007\n\n**Website:**\n\n1xBet.com\n\n\n###### General information\n\n A perfect example of actively promoting a gambling brand online is the history of 1xBet.\n\n 1xBet is a betting company founded in 2006. Mediascope, spe- cialized in media research, estimates that in Q1 2019 1xBet came third in the top 10 list of advertisers in the online videos segment, with 2.4% (by comparison, Google topped the list and had 3.3%). According to the year-end results of 2019, however, the company did not make it to the list due to active measures against online gambling. At the moment, various experts estimate that the com- pany is not even on the list of the top 30 advertisers in Russia.\n\n The bookmaker’s primary audience includes residents of develop- ing countries (India, Brazil, Thailand, and post-Soviet countries).\n\n In 2009, Russia passed a law that banned non-certified gambling organizations. Two years later, the Russian government had claims against 1xBet for the first time. In 2016, access to the main domain 1xBet.com was restricted in Russia.\n\n To prevent losses, 1xBet took two steps:\n\n 1. It expanded its development beyond the post-Soviet region. 2. \u0007It took measures to bypass blocking: numerous mirror sites (over 800) were created and an ad system involving pirate traffic (voiceover studios, camrip groups) was developed.\n\n Entry into the markets of developing countries\n\n After being blocked in Russia, 1xBet owners shifted their focus to:\n\n • Latin America (primarily Brazil);\n • India;\n • Thailand.\n\n Like Russia, these regions and countries have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. They are developing countries. 2. Their inhabitants are mainly non-English speakers. 3. Their populations have a low financial literacy. 4. Sports streaming is highly popular.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Links with piracy in the post-Soviet region\n\n Official advertising services rarely work together with pirate por- tals. In their license agreements, major aggregators such as Yan- dex and Google have paragraphs that ban the use of content without the copyright holder’s consent.\n\n This resulted in a symbiosis of gambling companies and pirate traffic.\n\n In September 2015, 1xBet, together with the voiceover studio Baibako team, published their first ever joint release, with their ads integrated into the video.\n\nFirst time that 1xBet work together with with pirates voiceover studio\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Based on the analysis of conversations on specialized forums, since 2015, 1xBet is likely to have sponsored content for 17 TV show voiceover studios (i.e. 80% of major voiceover studios).\n\n**Voiceover studio** **Collaboration start date** **Content**\n\nBaibako September 26, 2015 TV series/movies\n\nGears Media November 29, 2016 TV series\n\nColdfilm January 17, 2017 TV series\n\nGreen Рай [Green Rai] April 1, 2017 TV series/movies\n\nNewStudio March 7, 2017 TV series\n\nIdea film May 24, 2017 TV series\n\nOmsk Bird May 18, 2017 TV series/movies\n\nHamster studio October 9, 2018 TV series\n\nAlexfilm March 5, 2018 TV series/movies\n\nJaskier June 17, 2017 TV series/movies\n\nSunshine Studio November 7, 2017 TV series\n\nGood People August 12, 2017 TV series/doramas\n\nKansai Studio August 3, 2017 Animation\n\nGostfilm March 26, 2018 TV series\n\nAlternative Production November 28, 2018 TV series\n\nСинема УС [Cinema US] February 01, 2019 TV series\n\nМузобоз / Колобок February 01, 2019 Movies\n\n[Muzoboz / Kolobok]\n\n###### 1xBet has been one of the main sponsors of illegal distribution of TV series in the post-Soviet region since 2017.\n\n**Year** **Number of studios working with 1xBet**\n\n2015 1\n\n2016 2\n\n2017 9\n\n2018 14\n\n2019 17\n\n###### Collaboration with voiceover studios was based on the follow- ing pattern: a voiceover studio would inform an 1xBet advertising manager about a possibility to produce content and 1xBet would pay for it. This meant that 1xBet did not participate in content pro- duction (did not order any specific content) but sponsored it. Its collaboration with camrip groups was similar.\n\n Voiceover studies and their representatives searched for digital copies of content released abroad. The more relevant the content, the more 1xBet paid for it.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### $55\n\nis the average cost of voiceover\nservices paid by 1xBet for one episode\n\n#### up to 80%\n\nof pirate resources in post‑Soviet\ncountries contained 1xBet\nadvertisements\n\n#### Koshara × 1xBet\n\nLaunched together 100 camrips\n\n\n###### The average cost of voiceover services for one episode amounted to about $55.[11] For a movie already released online, the cost was $65-$70. 1xBet spent between $5,000 and $8,300 on average per month on sponsoring voiceover studios and creating camrips in the post-Soviet region.\n\n If we look at the history of camrips, the average cost of produсing one camrip amounted to between $400 and $1,000 (depending on the copy’s quality and the content’s popularity).\n\n As for integrating ads into the pre-rolls of pirate CDNs, collabora- tion has been ongoing since 2016. As such, 1xBet ads have been placed on more than 80% of all pirate resources in post-Soviet countries.\n\n The total number of content items voiced over with 1xBet’s sup- port in post-Soviet countries amounts to over 900 (movies and TV series).\n\n Beginning of interaction with Koshara/Octopus team\n\n In February 2019, the group Koshara started acting as an intermediary between 1xBet and voiceover studios. Around the same time, this release-group began creating camrips with hardcoded 1xBet ads for post-Soviet countries.\n\n Koshara still makes its own camrips regardless of 1xBet, which is why 1xBet ads often appear several times in different versions of a camrip. The first time is when a voiceover studio edits an overseas camrip; the second time is when a camrip is created locally.\n\n In addition to producing content, Koshara commits to distributing content by placing it on more than eight major torrent tracker services (including its own website) and uploading it to two CDNs after the content is released.\n\n Since 1xBet started working with Koshara, over 100 camrips have been released, which amounts to an average of three per week.\n\n11 \u0007The costs shown are for the post-Soviet region; content production\ncosts for India are unknown.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Piracy connections worldwide\n\n1xBet.com traffic map (according to similarweb.com)\n\n###### 1xBet started creating content for overseas countries in 2018.\n\n Total camrip releases: over 500.\n\n Total titles covered: over 270.\n\n Distribution by language:\n\n • 100% of camrips are in English;\n • 14% of camrips are in Spanish;\n • \u00075% of camrips are in other languages (Tamil,  Portuguese, Thai, Hindi, and others).\n\n On average, 1xBet released four camrip versions of films per week.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Lucky Partners  & Welcome Partners\n\n**Website:**\n\nhttps://luckypartners.biz/\n\n**Foundation**\n\nLucky Partners founded\nby Rustam Gilfanov\n\n**In 2011,**\n\nLucky Partnerns moved\nfrom Moscow to Kiev due\nto Ukraine’s less strict\ngambling laws\n\n**In 2013,**\n\nLucky Partners started\ncollaborating with a Ukrainian\nentrepreneur\n\n**In 2020,**\n\nThe conflict between Lucky\nPartners and Welcome\nPartners has lasted for over\nsix years\n\n\n###### General information\n\n For a long time, the two partner programs Lucky Partners and Wel- come Partners were the main participants involved in the under- ground online casino market.\n\n According to media reports, Lucky Partners was founded by Rus- tam Gilfanov. His partner was Sergey Tokarev.[12] In 2011, Lucky Partnerns moved from Moscow to Kiev due to Ukraine’s less strict gambling laws.[13]\n\n Welcome Partners was founded by a Ukrainian entrepreneur, the owner of many Ukrainian online casinos and popular dating websites.\n\n Lucky Partners started collaborating with the Welcome Partners leadership in 2013. However, they later had a conflict, which has been ongoing for over six years.\n\n Business practices\n\n Both partner programs use two types of illegal online casinos: licensed and non-licensed.\n\n In several countries, including in Europe, laws generally allow for online casinos to operate. As such, some developers provide software for online casinos that comply with gambling regula- tions. In such casinos, winning is possible and winnings are based on a mathematical algorithm that ensures that the casino always has some profit. These casinos are considered licensed.\n\n In the case of non-licensed casinos, similar software is installed, but it is cracked and allows setting arbitrary betting odds, including in a way that makes winning impossible.\n\n It is worth mentioning that Lucky Partners try to distance them- selves from the most well-known casinos, particularly Azino777, but media outlets have confirmed that this casino is in fact one of their projects.\n\n Along with online casinos, partner programs are involved in other gambling-type projects: small Forex brokers and binary options (a business that deals with bets on currencies and cryptocurren- cies, which in general is banned by international payment systems, Russian law, and the laws of European countries), various lotteries, and other similar products.\n\n Lucky Partners and Welcome Partners stay away from Fonbet and 1xBet, the leaders of the bookmaker industry. Nevertheless, both support the gambling industry. \n\n12 [\u0007https://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2018/07/5b3f96df9a79475e9f9f5045](https://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2018/07/5b3f96df9a79475e9f9f5045)\n\n13 [\u0007https://rb.ru/longread/unlucky-labs/](https://rb.ru/longread/unlucky-labs/)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### $25,000+\n\nis a fine for violating the\nMCC 7995 requirement\n\n\n###### Accepting payments\n\n International payment systems require that almost all aforementioned types of businesses be registered with a special transaction code, MCC 7995. This is the code that was blocked in the US to stop online casino transactions. Violating the MCC 7995 requirement incurs significant fines starting at $25,000 for each incident.\n\n In addition, banks assign MCC codes based on data that companies themselves provide. To be able to operate in Russia, online casinos specify other MCC codes. For example, Azino used the code 6012 (sale of certificates and consulting services as well as loan payments), while the actual recipient was the company Victory 777 N.V, which held a Curaçao license.[14 ]In December 2018, the company was placed on the list of entities for which there is information that they organize and host gambling games in violation of Russian law. This list is kept by the Russian Federal Tax Service and includes 42 companies. It was last updated in August 2019.\n\n To verify payment information, Group-IB specialists used the website https://affgambler.ru/blacklisted-casinos, which lists the most popular licensed and non-licensed online casinos.\n\n Analysis suggests that all popular online casinos use exclusively Russian banks[15] to accept payments, despite the fact that the owners are based in Ukraine. None of the banks use MCC 7995 for this activity even though there are technical solutions that help automatically check websites connected to the processing system for illegal content (including related to online casinos).\n\n Such actions by banks are ignored by the international payment systems Visa and Mastercard and the Russian system Mir, which runs counter to both the rules of the payment systems themselves and the provisions of the Central Bank of Russia.\n\n There are almost no international precedents of online casinos or bookmakers violating MCC 7995. Under the rules of international payment systems, this type of violation is one of the most serious ones, second only to payments for child pornography.\n\n14 [https://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2018/07/5b3f96df9a79475e9f9f5045](https://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2018/07/5b3f96df9a79475e9f9f5045)\n\n15 \u0007The names of the banks have not been disclosed in the report’s public version for\nconfidentiality reasons. This information has been provided to relevant government agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In Russia, Visa and Mastercard parent organizations fail to address the ubiquitous violations. The reason could be their poor understanding of the scale of online piracy in Russia and the monetization of this business through the gaming industry. As such, we have shared this report with the parent organizations of the payment systems.\n\n Distributing payments\n\n For outgoing financial flows (namely players’ winnings and commission payouts to webmasters for ads), acquiring banks usually act as intermediaries. Payouts to webmasters seem to be carried out through the online bank capitalist.net.\n\n Attracting advertising\n\n Attracting ad traffic to the aforementioned projects is done  in two ways.\n\n The first method is advertising in the webmaster community, which centers around the forums gofuckbiz.net, maultalk.com, and armadaboard.com. Community members meet at various offline events, mainly overseas to avoid the attention of law enforcers. According to the information available, these forums also belong to capitalist.net.\n\n The second method involves ads through pirate websites using specialized advertising agencies. One of such agencies is Adwise Agency, whose links with Lucky Labs were confirmed by the media.[16 ]Adwise Agency has been suspected of having links with illegal online gambling and pirate websites (e.g. Kinogo, HDRezka, Filmix, Kinoprofi), including by law enforcement agencies. In February 2020, the Cyber Police of Ukraine searched Adwise Agency’s offices in relation to the funding of the pirate websites kinosha.se, kinanema.net, kinoprofi.vip, rezka.ag, and  filmix.co.[17]\n\n16 [https://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2018/07/5b3f96df9a79475e9f9f5045](https://www.rbc.ru/magazine/2018/07/5b3f96df9a79475e9f9f5045)\n\n17 [https://ain.ua/2020/02/28/obyski-u-adwise/](https://ain.ua/2020/02/28/obyski-u-adwise/)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ZeroCDN (Mnogobyte)\n\n**The project’s websites:**\n\nhttps://zerocdn.com/\nhttps://mnogobyte.ru/\n\n**INN[18]**\n\n7733572160\n\n**OGRN[19]**\n\n1067746757176\n\n**Legal address:**\n\n12 Tushinskaya St., Moscow, Russia\n\n**Office address:**\n\n39 Leningradskaya St., Bld. 6, Fl.14\n\n\n## Russian infrastructure  of illegal resources\n\n###### ZeroCDN, which belongs to the Russian company Mnogobyte, is one of the most popular services used for placing and distribut- ing video content. As at late 2019, the ZeroCDN project infrastruc- ture was used by 38% to 60% of pirate websites.\n\n The following CDNs were found to use ZeroCDN servers:\n\n • \u0007VideoCDN (the third most popular CDN, used by up to 33% of pirate websites);\n • Kodik;\n • Videoframe;\n • Protonvideo.\n\n In addition, ZeroCDN servers are used by some separate  projects, in particular Hdrezka (over 52 million visitors per month)  and Kinogo (more than 35 million visitors per month).\n\n The company’s website mentions that the Mnogobyte network has direct connections to major Russian communications ser- vice providers, including Beeline, MTS, and TransTelecom, as well as Moscow-based and regional operators. Major Ukrainian com- munications service providers (Eurotel, Dataline, Datagroup, and Topnet) and Belarus’ largest telecommunications service pro- vider Beltelecom are also connected to the Mnogobyte network. What’s more, Mnogobyte is part of several Internet Exchange Points (MSK-IX, DATA-IX, W-IX, Global-IX).\n\n In 2015, the company launched the ZeroCDN project, the aim of which was to store and transfer large amounts of media content.\n\n Since 2017, the company has been officially working with the Swiss solutions provider DigitalOne AG.[20]\n\n18 Taxpayer identification number\n\n19 Principle state registration number\n\n20 [\u0007https://hosting.kitchen/mnogobyte/mnogobayt-i-digitalone-ag-podpisali-dogovor.html](https://hosting.kitchen/mnogobyte/mnogobayt-i-digitalone-ag-podpisali-dogovor.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### DDOS-GUARD\n\n**Address**\n\nSuite 11, Floor 5, 276 Maksima Gorkogo\nSt., Rostov Region, Russia\n\n**INN**\n\n9204005780\n\n**OGRN**\n\n1149204010988\n\n**KPP[21]**\n\n616701001\n\n**Website**\n\nhttps://ddos-guard.net/en\n\n**IP address ranges**\n\n45.155.60.0/24\n185.129.100.0/22\n185.129.101.0/24\n185.129.102.0/24\n185.129.103.0/24\n185.178.208.0/24\n185.178.209.0/24\n185.178.210.0/24\n186.2.160.0/20\n190.115.16.0/20\n\n\n###### The Russian company DDOS-GUARD provides anti-DDoS and con- tent delivery services. It is also a hosting service provider.[22]\n\n By Order of the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Com- munications and Mass Media No. 326-FZ of June 26, 2017, the DDoS-Guard Protection software was registered as an information security tool in Russia’s Unified Register of Programs for Electronic Computers and Databases.\n\n Yet the company’s services are used by many illegal resources, including pirate and fraudulent ones. DDOS-GUARD does not usu- ally respond to any complaints regarding such resources.\n\n The company DDOS-GUARD:\n\n • \u0007provides fraudulent websites with its computing capacities,\n which are used to operate the websites in question;\n • \u0007conceals the actual hosting service and obstructs the identifi- cation of website owners.\n\n It is of note that the terms and conditions of using DDOS- GUARD’s services stipulate that customers agree to use the specified services for lawful purposes only. Yet organizing gambling games and scams falls under unlawful use.[23]\n\n Despite that, DDOS-GUARD does not comply with its own terms and conditions of using their services. Under Articles 15.1 to 15.6-1 of Russian Federal Law No. 149-FZ of July 27, 2006 “On Information, Information Technologies, and Protection of Information,” access to many websites that distribute ille- gal information and that are or have been hosted on DDOS- GUARD’s network addresses is restricted by Roskomnadzor (Rus- sia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Informa- tion Technology and Mass Media). At the same time, the specified procedure before blocking provides for the mandatory notification of violation to the hosting provider, indicating the need to remove unlawful information. Thus, DDOS-GUARD knew about the viola- tions on the blocked websites, but did not take any actions.\n\n As at June 24, 2020, a total of 453 such resources (domains or URL addresses) were blocked.

For instance, only legal entities duly registered according to the established procedure within the territory of the Russian Federa- tion can organize gambling games. In turn, only legal entities that are part of a self-regulatory organization of gambling game orga- nizers at bookmakers or a self-regulatory organization of gambling game organizers at betting houses can organize gambling games at bookmakers or betting houses.\n\n Article 5 of this law sets out restrictions on organizing and con- ducting gambling games, including a ban on such activity when it involves information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet, and also when it involves means of communication, including mobile communication (with the exception of instances of accepting interactive bets and payouts on them by organizers of gambling games at bookmakers and (or) betting houses).\n\n Failure to comply with the above requirements incurs various types of liability.\n\n Article 171.2 of the Russian Criminal Code provides for criminal liability for natural persons who illegally organize and conduct gam- bling games, including by using information and telecommunica- tions networks, including the Internet, or means of communication.\n\n Under Article 14.1.1, paragraph 1, the same actions carried out by legal entities incur administrative liability and are punishable by a fine between 800,000 rubles ($11,350) and 1.5 million rubles ($21,300), including confiscation of the gaming equipment.\n\n In addition, gambling websites may be subject to restriction of access within the territory of the Russian Federation.\n\n According to paragraph 1 of the Regulation No. 228 of the Government of the Russian Federation of March 16, 2009 “On the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media,” Roskomnadzor is an executive body that supervises the media, mass communication, information technology, and communications.\n\n As such, Roskomnadzor takes measures to restrict access to websites that contain information whose distribution in Russia is prohibited according to the procedure established in Article 15.1 of Russian Federal Law No. 149-FZ “On Information, Informa- tion Technologies, and Protection of Information.”\n\n In particular, paragraph 5 of this Article allows for non-judicial restriction of access to information that violates Russian Federal Law No. 244-FZ of December 29, 2006 “On the State Regulation of Activities Involving the Organization and Conduct of Gambling\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Games and on the Introduction of Amendments to Certain Legis- lative Acts of the Russian Federation” and Russian Federal Law  No. 138-FZ of November 11, 2003 “On Lotteries,” which bans the organization and conduct of gambling games and lotteries that involve the Internet and other means of communication.\n\n Pursuant to subparagraph a) of paragraph 5 of Decision-making rules for federal executive bodies authorized by the Government of the Russian Federation in relation to certain types of informa- tion and materials distributed through the Internet whose distribu- tion in the Russian Federation is prohibited (approved by Russian Government Decree No. 1101 of October 26, 2012 “On the Uniform Automated Information System the Unified Register of Domain Names and Website References on the Internet), the basis for including domain names and website references related to gam- bling in the Unified Register of prohibited information is a decision of the Russian Federal Tax Service.\n\n The information and material assessment criteria necessary for making such a decision are approved by Order No. 84/292/351/ MMV-7-2/461S of May 18, 2017 by Roskomnadzor, Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Service for Surveillance on Con- sumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor), and the Russian Federal Tax Service.\n\n These criteria are:\n\n 1. \u0007The existence of photo, video, audio and/or textual and graphic information encouraging to take part in a gambling game or lot- tery that is conducive to attracting the attention of a poten- tial participant on a website where it is possible to take part in a gambling game or lottery, make bets, and receive payouts for winning. 2. \u0007The existence of photo, video, audio and/or textual and graphic information that provides an understanding of a gambling game or lottery; terms and conditions for taking part in a gambling game or lottery, including rules of conducting gambling games and terms and conditions for participating in lotteries; poten- tial prizes; description of ways of transferring money to par- ticipate in a gambling game or lottery; and ways of receiving prizes on a given website where it is possible to take part in a gambling game or lottery, make bets, and receive payouts for winning. 3. \u0007The existence of a demonstration of taking part in a gam- bling game or lottery, with descriptions of the process and sequence of actions in a gambling game or lottery involving photo, video, audio, or images on a website where it is pos- sible to take part in a gambling game or lottery, make bets, and receive payouts for winning. 4. \u0007The possibility of taking part in a gambling game or lottery on a website. 5. \u0007The possibility of transferring money (including electronic money) using electronic means of payment to participate in a gambling game or lottery, as well as a possibility of receiving (providing) a prize on a website.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Online pirates\n\n\n###### 6. \u0007The existence of a notice or information about the possi- bility of taking part in a gambling game or lottery using other domain names and (or) website references on the Internet on a website. 7. \u0007The existence of information and/or) computer programs on a website that make it possible to access a website or web- site page that contains forbidden information that meets the criteria specified in the paragraphs above. 8. \u0007The possibility of loading computer programs on a website or website page that make it possible to take part in a gambling game or lottery.\n\n Under Russian law, Internet services that provide servers to CDNs are considered information intermediaries.\n\n According to Article 1253.1(3) of the Russian Civil Code, an information intermediary that provides an opportunity to place materials on the Internet (e.g. a hosting service) does not bear responsibility for breaches of intellectual rights occurring as a result of materials being placed by a third party or on the instruction thereof. However, the responsibility is abrogated only if the information intermediary meets the following conditions:\n\n 1. \u0007They neither knew nor should have known that the use of the relevant result of intellectual activity or means of personaliza- tion in such materials was unlawful. 2. \u0007After receving a written complaint by the copyright holder about a breach of intellectual rights with reference to the website page and/or to the web address where such material was placed, they took timely measures, which were necessary and sufficient, to end the breach of the intellectual rights. A list of the measures deemed necessary and sufficient, and the procedure for implementing them, may be established by law.\n\n This means that, if an Internet service that provides pirate CDNs with their server capacities refuses to cooperate with copyright holders or if the measures taken are insufficient for stopping pirate activities, the following is possible:\n\n • Civil liability is imposed on the Internet service provider;\n • \u0007Administrative and criminal liability is imposed on those responsible;\n • \u0007Demands to protect intellectual property rights are set  (unrelated to the enforcement of civil liability penalties), including demands to delete information that violates exclusive rights or demands to restrict access to such information.\n\n Within the framework of civil law relations, recovery of damages may be claimed from a party that has unlawfully used the result of intellectual activity (Article 1252(1)(3) of the Russian Civil Code). Demands for compensation can also be made (Article 1301 of the Russian Civil Code).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In addition, depending on the damages, such a party can incur administrative liability under Article 7.12 of the Russian Code on Administrative Offences or criminal liability under Article 146 of the Russian Criminal Code. These types of liability can be applied against the Chief Executive Officer of a company whose activity has caused damages as a result of the unlawful use of intellectual property.\n\n As an example, in April 2018 the CEO of HOME-iPTV, Yuri Moskachev, was sentenced to three years’ suspended imprison- ment for an offence under Article 146(3)(v) and (g) of the Russian Criminal Code. According to the case file, the accused transferred the signal of the TV Channel Nostalgiya, for which the copyright holder was NTV Plus, using the TCP/IP protocol without an agree- ment with the copyright holder. The court later ordered Yuri Moskachev to pay NTV Plus $180,390.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1000+\n\nsuccessful investigations\nworldwide\n\n###### 60 000++\n\nhours of incident response\n\n###### $300 MLN\n\nreturned to Group-IB clients thanks\nto our products and services\n\n\n## About Group−IB\n\n##### Group-IB is a leading provider of high-fidelity threat intelligence and best-in-class anti-APT and anti-fraud solutions.
