This campaign, dubbed\nOperation GhostSecret, leverages multiple implants, tools, and malware variants associated\nwith the state-sponsored cyber group Hidden Cobra. The infrastructure currently remains\nactive. In this post, we dive deeply into this campaign. For a brief overview of this threat, see\n“Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from Critical Infrastructure, Entertainment, Finance,\nHealth Care, and Other Industries.”\n\nOur investigation into this campaign reveals that the actor used multiple malware implants,\nincluding an unknown implant with capabilities similar to Bankshot. From March 18 to 26 we\nobserved the malware operating in multiple areas of the world. This new variant resembles\nparts of the Destover malware, which was used in the 2014 Sony Pictures attack.\n\nFurthermore, the Advanced Threat Research team has discovered Proxysvc, which appears\nto be an undocumented implant. We have also uncovered additional control servers that are\nstill active and associated with these new implants. Based on our analysis of public and\nprivate information from submissions, along with product telemetry, it appears Proxysvc was\nused alongside the 2017 Destover variant and has operated undetected since mid-2017.\n\nThe attackers behind Operation GhostSecret used a similar infrastructure to earlier threats,\nincluding SSL certificates used by FakeTLS in implants found in the Destover backdoor\nvariant known as Escad, which was used in the Sony Pictures attack. Based on our technical\nanalysis, telemetry, and data from submissions, we can assert with high confidence that this\nis the work of the Hidden Cobra group. The Advanced Threat Research team uncovered\nactivity related to this campaign in March 2018, when the actors targeted Turkish banks.\nThese initial findings appear to be the first stage of Operation GhostSecret. For more on the\nglobal aspect of this threat, see “Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from Critical\nInfrastructure of Entertainment, Finance, Health Care, and Other Industries.”\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered a previously unknown datagathering implant that surfaced in mid-February 2018. This implant appears to be a\nderivative of implants authored before by Hidden Cobra and contains functionality similar to\nthat of Bankshot, with code overlaps from other Hidden Cobra implants. However, the variant\n\n\n-----\n\nis not based on Bankshot. Our analysis of the portable executable s rich-header data reveals\nthat the two implants were compiled in different development environments. (The PE rich\nheader is an undocumented part of a Windows executable that reveals unique information to\nidentify the Microsoft compiler and linker used to create the program. It is helpful for\nidentifying similarities between malware variants to establish common development\nenvironments.) Our analysis of the code and PE rich header indicates that Bankshot,\nProxysvc, and the Destover-like implant are distinct families, but also contain overlapping\ncode and functionality with current tools of Hidden Cobra.\n\n_PE rich header data from the 2018 Bankshot implant._\n\n_PE rich header data from the new February 2018 implant._\n\n_PE rich header data from Proxysvc.dll._\n\nWhen we compared the PE rich header data of the new February 2018 implant with a variant\nof Backdoor.Escad (Destover) from 2014 shortly before the Sony Pictures attack, we found\nthe signatures to be identical. The Destover-like variant is 83% similar in code to a 2015\nvariant and contains the same rich PE header signature as the Backdoor.Escad variant we\nanalyzed Thus the new implant is likely a derivative of components of Destover We\n\n\n-----\n\ndetermined that the implant is not a direct copy of well-known previous samples of Destover;\nrather, Hidden Cobra created a new hybrid variant using functionality present in earlier\nversions.\n\n_2014 Backdoor.Escad (hash: 8a7621dba2e88e32c02fe0889d2796a0c7cb5144)._\n\n_2015 Destover variant (7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6)._\n\nThe February implant fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c was obtained from an\nunknown submitter in the United States on February 14, two days after it was compiled. This\nKorean-language file used the control server IP address 203.131.222.83. The implant is\nnearly identical to an unknown 2017 sample\n(8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) except that the control server addresses\nare different. The 2017 sample used address 14.140.116.172. Both implants specifically use\nFakeTLS with PolarSSL, which we saw in previous Hidden Cobra implants. PolarSSL\nlibraries have appeared in implants since the Sony Pictures incident and were used\nexclusively in the implant Backdoor.Destover. This implant incorporated a custom control\nserver protocol that sends traffic over port 443. The implementation does not format the\npackets in standard SSL, but rather in a custom format and transmitted over SSL—hence,\nFakeTLS. The control server traffic when compared to Backdoor.Escad is nearly identical.\n\n\n-----\n\n_TLS traffic in Backdoor.Destover, the 2018 Destover-like variant._\n\n_TLS traffic in Backdoor.Escad._\n\nFurther research into IP address 14.140.116.172 leads us to additional hidden components\ninvolved in the overall infrastructure. Proxysvc.dll contains a list of hardcoded IP addresses,\nincluding the preceding address, all located in India. Despite the name, this component is not\nan SSL proxy, but rather a unique data-gathering and implant-installation component that\nlistens on port 443 for inbound control server connections.\n\nProxysvc was first collected by public and private sources on March 22 from an unknown\nentity in the United States. The executable dropper for the component was submitted from\nSouth Korea on March 19. McAfee telemetry analysis from March 16 to 21 reveals that\nProxysvc components were active in the wild. Our research shows this listener component\nappeared mostly in higher education organizations. We suspect this component is involved\nin core control server infrastructure. These targets were chosen intentionally to run Proxysvc\nbecause the attacker would have needed to know which systems were infected to connect to\n\n\n-----\n\nthem. This data also indicates this infrastructure had been operating for more than a year\nbefore its discovery. The Advanced Threat Research team found this component running on\nsystems in 11 countries. Given the limited capabilities of Proxysvc, it appears to be part of a\ncovert network of SSL listeners that allow the attackers to gather data and install more\ncomplex implants or additional infrastructure. The SSL listener supports multiple control\nserver connections, rather than a list of hardcoded addresses. By removing the dependency\non hardcoded IP addresses and accepting only inbound connections, the control service can\nremain unknown.\n\n_The number of infected systems by country in which Proxysvc.dll was operating in March._\n_Source: McAfee Advanced Threat Research._\n\nThe 2018 Destover-like implant appeared in organizations in 17 countries between March 14\nand March 18. The impacted organizations are in industries such as telecommunications,\nhealth, finance, critical infrastructure, and entertainment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The_ _number of infected systems by country in which the Destover variant was operating in_\n_March.

This server resides at Thammasat\nUniversity in Bangkok, Thailand. The same entity hosted the control server for the Sony\nPictures implants. This SSL certificate has been used in Hidden Cobra operations since the\nSony Pictures attack. Analyzing this certificate reveals additional control servers using the\nsame PolarSSL certificate. Further analysis of McAfee telemetry data reveals several IP\naddresses that are active, two within the same network block as the 2018 Destover-like\nimplant.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of infections by Thammasat University–hosted control servers from March 15–19,_\n_2018. Source: McAfee Advanced Threat Research._\n\n## Implant Origins\n\nMcAfee Advanced Threat Research determined that the Destover-like variant originated from\ncode developed in 2015. The code reappeared in variants surfacing in 2017 and 2018 using\nnearly the same functionality and with some modifications to commands, along with an\nidentical development environment based on the rich PE header information.\n\nBoth implants (fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c and\n8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) are based on the 2015 code. When\ncomparing the implant 7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6, compiled on\nAugust 8, 2015, we found it 83% similar to the implant from 2018. The key similarities and\ndifferences follow.\n\n## Similarities\n\nBoth variants build their API imports dynamically using GetProcAddress, including\nwtsapi32.dll for gathering user and domain names for any active remote sessions\nBoth variants contain a variety of functionalities based on command IDs issued by the\ncontrol servers\n\n\n-----\n\nCommon capabilities of both malware:\n\nListing files in directory\nCreating arbitrary processes\nWriting data received from control servers to files on disk\nGathering information for all drives\nGathering process times for all processes\nSending the contents of a specific file to the control server\nWiping and deleting files on disk\nSetting the current working directory for the implant\nSending disk space information to the control server\nBoth variants use a batch file mechanism to delete their binaries from the system\nBoth variants run commands on the system, log output to a temporary file, and send\nthe contents of the file to their control servers\n\n## Differences\n\nThe following capabilities in the 2015 implant are missing from the 2018 variant:\n\nCreating a process as a specific user\nTerminating a specific process\nDeleting a specific file\nSetting file times for a specific file\nGetting current system time and sending it to the control server\nReading the contents of a file on disk. If the filepath specified is a directory, then listing\nthe directory’s contents.\nSetting attributes on files\n\nThe 2015 implant does not contain a hardcoded value of the IP address it must connect to.\nInstead it contains a hardcoded sockaddr_in data structure (positioned at 0x270 bytes before\nthe end of the binary) used by the connect() API to specify port 443 and control server IP\naddresses:\n\n193.248.247.59\n196.4.67.45\n\nBoth of these control servers used the PolarSSL certificate\nd0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76.\n\n## Proxysvc\n\nAt first glance Proxysvc, the SSL listener, looks like a proxy setup tool (to carry out man-inthe-middle traffic interception). However, a closer analysis of the sample reveals it is yet\nanother implant using HTTP over SSL to receive commands from the control server.\n\n\n-----\n\nProxysvc appears to be a downloader whose primary capability is to deliver additional\npayloads to the endpoint without divulging the control address of the attackers. This implant\ncontains a limited set of capabilities for reconnaissance and subsequent payload\ninstallations. This implant is a service DLL that can also run as a standalone process.\n\n_The ServiceMain() sub function of Proxysvc._\n\nThe implant cannot connect to a control server IP address or URL. Instead it accepts\ncommands from the control server. The implant binds and listens to port 443 for any\nincoming connections.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Proxysvc binding itself to the specified port._\n\n_Proxysvc begins accepting incoming requests to process._\n\nProxysvc makes an interesting check while accepting connections from a potential control\nserver. It checks against a list of IP addresses to make sure the incoming connection is not\nfrom any of the following addresses. If the incoming request does come from one of these,\nthe implant offers a zero response (ASCII “0”) and shuts down the connection.\n\n121.240.155.74\n121.240.155.76\n121.240.155.77\n121.240.155.78\n223.30.98.169\n223.30.98.170\n14.140.116.172\n\n## SSL Listener Capabilities\n\nThe implant receives HTTP-based commands from a control server and parses the HTTP\nContent-Type and Content-Length from the HTTP header. If the HTTP Content-Type\nmatches the following value, then the implant executes the command specified by the control\n\n\n-----\n\nserver:\n\nContent-Type: 8U7y3Ju387mVp49A\n\n_HTTP Content-Type comparison with a custom implant value._\n\nThe implant has the following capabilities:\n\nWriting an executable received from the control server into a temp file and executing it\n\n_Proxysvc writing a binary to a temp directory and executing it._\n\n\n-----\n\nGathering system information and sending it to the control server. The system\ninformation gathered from the endpoint includes:\n\nMAC address of the endpoint\nComputer Name\nProduct name from HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\nProductName\nThis information is concatenated into a single string in the format:\n“MAC_Address|ComputerName|ProductName” and is sent to the control server\nRecording HTTP requests from the control server to the temporary file prx in the\nimplant’s install directory with the current system timestamp\n\n## Analyzing the Main Implant\n\nThe February 2018 implant contains a wide variety of capabilities including data exfiltration\nand arbitrary command execution on the victim’s system. Given the extensive command\nstructure that the implant can receive from the control server, this is an extensive framework\nfor data reconnaissance and exfiltration, and indicates advanced use. For example, the\nimplant can wipe and delete files, execute additional implants, read data out of files, etc.\n\nThe implant begins execution by dynamically loading APIs to perform malicious activities.\nLibraries used to load the APIs include:\n\nKernel32.dll\nApvapi32.dll\nOleaut32.dll\nIphlpapi.dll\nWs2_32.dll\nWtsapi32.dll\nUserenv.dll\nNtdll.dll\n\n\n-----\n\n_The main implant dynamically loading APIs._\n\nAs part of its initialization, the implant gathers basic system information and sends it to its\nhardcoded control server 203.131.222.83 using SSL over port 443:\n\nCountry name from system’s locale\nOperating system version\nProcessor description from\n\nHKLM\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\CentralProcessor\\0 ProcessorNameString\n\n\n-----\n\nComputer name and network adapters information\nDisk space information for disks C: through Z: including total memory in bytes, total\navailable memory in bytes, etc.\nCurrent memory status including total physical memory in bytes, total available\nmemory, etc.\nDomain name and usernames based on current remote sessions\n\n_Domain name and username extraction using Win32 WTS APIs._\n\n## Data Reconnaissance\n\nThe implant receives commands over SSL as encoded data. This data is decoded, and the\ncorrect command ID is derived. Valid command IDs reside between 0 and 0x1D.\n\n_Switch case handling command execution based on command IDs._\n\nBased on the command ID, the implant can perform the following functions:\n\nGather system information and exfiltrate to the control server (same as the basic datagathering functionality previously described)\nGet volume information for all drives on the system (A: through Z:) and exfiltrate to the\ncontrol server\n\n\n-----\n\n_Gathering volume information._\n\nList files in a directory. The directory path is specified by the control server.\nRead the contents of a file and send it to the control server\n\n\n-----\n\n_Reading file contents and sending it the control server._\n\nWrite data sent by the control server to a specified file path\n\n\n-----\n\n_Open handle to a file for writing with no shared permissions._\n\n_Writing data received from control server to file._\n\nCreate new processes based on the file path specified by the control server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Creating a new process for a binary specified by the control server._\n\nWipe and delete files specified by the control server\n\n_Wiping and deleting files._\n\n\n-----\n\nExecute a binary on the system using cmd.exe and log the results into a temp file,\nwhich is then read and the logged results are sent to the control server. The command\nline:\n\ncmd.exe /c “<file_path> > %temp%\\PM*.tmp 2>&1”\n\n_Executing a command and logging results to a temp file._\n\nGet information for all currently running processes\n\n\n-----\n\n_Getting process times for all processes on the system._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Getting username and domain from accounts associated with a running process._\n\nDelete itself from disk using a batch file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Creating a batch file for self-deletion._\n\nStore encoded data received from the control server as a registry value at:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\TowConfigs Description\n\nSet and get the current working directory for the implant\n\n\n-----\n\n_Setting and getting the current working directory for the implant’s process._\n\nThe command handler index table is organized in the implant as follows:\n\n_The command handler index table._\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThis analysis by the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has found previously\nundiscovered components that we attribute to Hidden Cobra, which continues to target\norganizations around the world. The evolution in complexity of these data-gathering implants\nreveals an advanced capability by an attacker that continues its development of tools. Our\ninvestigation uncovered an unknown infrastructure connected to recent operations with\nservers in India using an advanced implant to establish a covert network to gather data and\nlaunch further attacks.\n\nThe McAfee Advanced Threat Research team will provide further updates as our\ninvestigation develops.\n\n_Fighting cybercrime is a global effort best undertaken through effective partnerships between_\n_the public and private sectors. McAfee is working with Thai government authorities to take_\n_down the control server infrastructure of Operation GhostSecret, while preserving the_\n_systems involved for further analysis by law enforcement authorities. By creating and_\n_maintaining partnerships with worldwide law enforcement, McAfee demonstrates that we are_\n_stronger together._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nMcAfee detection\n\nTrojan-Bankshot2\n\n[MITRE ATT&CK techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page)\n\nExfiltration over control server channel: data is exfiltrated over the control server\nchannel using a custom protocol\nCommonly used port: the attackers used common ports such as port 443 for control\nserver communications\nService execution: registers the implant as a service on the victim’s machine\nAutomated collection: the implant automatically collects data about the victim and\nsends it to the control server\nData from local system: local system is discovered and data is gathered\nProcess discovery: implants can list processes running on the system\nSystem time discovery: part of the data reconnaissance method, the system time is\nalso sent to the control server\nFile deletion:: malware can wipe files indicated by the attacker\n\nIP addresses\n\n203.131.222.83\n14.140.116.172\n203.131.222.109\n\n\n-----\n\nHashes\n\nfe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c\n8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35\n33ffbc8d6850794fa3b7bccb7b1aa1289e6eaa45\n\n[Ryan Sherstobitoff](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/ryan-sherstobitoff/)\nRyan Sherstobitoff is a Senior Analyst for Major Campaigns – Advanced Threat Research in\nMcAfee.
