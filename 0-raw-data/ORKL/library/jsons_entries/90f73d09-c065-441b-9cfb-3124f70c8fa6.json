The\nmalware family has remained largely unchanged over the years and only made few\nappearances.\n\nIn early 2023 however, one such appearance seemed particularly noteworthy as the\nconfigured Command & Control suggests that the attackers have managed to compromise\nthe web presence of the National Institute of Virology in India and possibly used it to control\ncomputers infected with the malware family.\n\nIn this blog post, we document the malware and discuss how this finding fits the attacker\nprofile.\n\n_Blog authored by,,,, and colleagues._\n\n## Basic case information\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2020, DCSO first came across an unknown malware family uploaded to VirusTotal. During\nour analysis we discovered that we weren’t the first to notice — we believe it to belong to the\n[malware family dubbed “Jupiter” by BAE Systems, and attributed to the Andariel group.](https://www.baesystems.com/)\n\nInterestingly, the malware is written in PureBasic, a programming language that’s rarely used\nin malware creation (however, [exceptions](https://twitter.com/jaydinbas/status/1319613564559163394) [do exist). While the choice of programming](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/cobalt_upd_ttps/)\nlanguage is rather exotic, the malware itself only offers basic download and shell command\nexecution capabilities.\n\nWe then added custom rules for this family to our monitoring. Around a year later the rule\nproduced another hit (the “OSPREY sample”, based on its code signature by “OSPREY\nVIDEO, INC.”) which we could attribute to a targeted attack attempt against a German\nmedical/pharma company.\n\nCode signing of the “OSPREY sample”\nThe malware family then disappeared from our radar, producing no hits in all of 2022. In the\nbeginning of February 2023 however, it resurfaced in [CISA’s AA23–040A alert (the “CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-040a)\nsample”) hidden away in the IoCs related to the H0lygh0st ransomware, which is assessed\nto be of DPRK origin.\n\nThe “CISA sample” found in the IoCs of CISA’s AA23–040A alert\nAnalysis of the “CISA sample” revealed it to likely be older, with the timestamps dating it to\n2021, the same year as the “OSPREY sample”. Then, a few weeks later our monitoring\nfinally detected another sample and this time it appeared to be a fresh catch too, with\ntimestamps indicating a compile time in mid January 2023.\n\nThe new sample, functionally unchanged, contained a very interesting Command & Control\nserver, suggesting that the threat actors behind it might have managed to compromise the\n[web server for the National Institute of Virology of India, or NIV in short, a designated BSL-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level)\nresearch center authorized to test highly contagious viruses impacting humans.\n\nSample recorded trying to fetch commands on VirusTotal\nAt the time of finding the sample, we were unable to receive actual commands from the\nconfigured C2 so it remains inconclusive if the compromise took place. However, the\nconfigured path does closely resemble another path that we believe was used by the real\nweb page at some point — further indicating that a compromise took place and was\nintentionally chosen to blend in:\n\nResource path indexed by Google, note the additional “s” in “scientifics”\nFor similar attacks it is also documented that commands are closely guarded and only issued\nto requests coming from expected source IPs, typically returning 404 for anyone else in order\nto keep a low profile.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nSo while we do not have definite proof of a compromise, DPRK actors targeting the NIV\n(either as the intended target or in order to attack other targets in the general nexus of the\nNIV such as other medical companies) would fit the attacker profile very well.\n\n## DPRK actors and India\n\nDPRK actors targeting India is not new either. North Korea-linked threat actors have\ncontinued to target public and private sectors in India with a broad-based victimology\n[including a space agency, a](https://www.ft.com/content/ac6a8782-ffad-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47) [nuclear power plant,](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-12/news/cyberattack-hits-indian-nuclear-plant) as well as the energy sector and medical\nresearch previously. Campaigns against strategically sensitive targets have mostly been\nmotivated by the need to siphon-off sensitive information.\n\nThe healthcare and medical research sector has been continuously targeted by DPRK threat\nactors with a significantly increased tempo during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020,\nsuspected North Korean hackers tried to break into various healthcare companies, likely for\n[intelligence gathering and espionage purposes, including Oxford’s AstraZeneca. Additionally,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-astrazeneca-no-idUSKBN2871A2)\n[Microsoft reported that North Korean ZINC and Cerium have taken aim at multiple healthcare](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/)\nentities, including vaccine makers and COVID test developers. Furthermore, South Korean\n[intelligence suspected that North Korea attempted to steal the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/17/north-korea-tried-to-hack-pfizer-for-covid-vaccine)\nin February 2021.\n\n## The DPRK and COVID-19\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic isolated the “hermit state” even further from the\ninternational community. Following the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections in China, North\nKorea shut down any cross-border exchanges in January 2020, which has largely been\nmaintained ever since. In August 2022, Kim Jong-un announced that COVID-19 was\n[eradicated. (According to state media reporting, only 74 people died between the first](https://www.nknews.org/2022/08/north-korea-declares-covid-19-eradicated-implies-kim-jong-un-caught-virus/)\npublicly disclosed case in April and August 2022.) However, Pyongyang again saw a rising\n[numbers of “respiratory illness” in January 2023, leading to a 5-day lockdown in the capital](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-covid-lockdown-report-respiratory-illness/)\nindicating that North Korea still continues to struggle with COVID-19 infections.\n\n[So far, Pyongyang has repeatedly turned down international offers for vaccines such as](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-rejected-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-over-side-effects-says-think-tank-2021-07-09/)\n[Russia’s Sputnik V in April 2021, offers by South Korea in May 2021, and three million doses](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-china-are-beating-u-s-vaccine-diplomacy-experts-say-n1262742)\nof Chinese SINOVAC vaccines as part of a [United Nations-backed COVAX initiative in](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/03/north-korea-kim-jong-un-rejects-covax-coronavirus-vaccine)\nSeptember 2021. One year later, in September 2022, North Korea started its first vaccination\ncampaign in border cities to China and Russia. Media reporting claimed they had received\n[doses from China, probably SINOVAC, alongside other medical supplies to ensure an](https://www.asiapress.org/rimjin-gang/2022/11/society-economy/vaccine/)\nadequate health care provision.\n\n\n-----\n\nCountry-wide distribution of a vaccine poses a bigger challenge though. mRNA vaccines like\nPfizer and Moderna require ultra-cold temperatures but the country’s existing cold chain\ndistribution system is only designed for 2°C — 8°C. With the refusal of SINOVAC, Sputnik V\n[and AstraZeneca, the state might thus be looking for alternatives. As such, the Indian](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-rejected-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-over-side-effects-says-think-tank-2021-07-09/)\n[vaccine COVAXIN may be of special interest, as COVAXIN is relatively easy to store, making](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covaxin-extremely-suitable-for-low-middle-income-countries-due-to-easy-storage-requirements-who/articleshow/87512335.cms)\nit particularly attractive to lower and middle-income countries like North Korea.\n\nThe DPRK’s present COVID situation and the country’s vaccine supply restraints as well as\nprevious patterns provide strong motive for targeting the NIV as a leading health research\ncenter with a focus on COVID. The NIV has played a crucial role in India’s fight against\n[COVID-19 for example, being a forerunner in the areas of vaccine development, genome](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1812784)\n[sequencing and testing supplies. The NIV has also been recognized by the WHO as “a](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/niv-pune-lab-gets-bsl4/article2305614.ece)\ncollaborating centre for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.”\n\n## Technical Details\n\n Investigating the Command & Control\n\nThe Command & Control projectcell.niv[.]co.in resolves to 173.249.33[.]80, which is\nallocated to German mass-hosting provider Contabo GmbH. No other FQDNs have been\nseen on this IP address thus far.\n```\nniv[.]co.in, however, resolves to 173.249.44.87, also allocated to Contabo GmbH, and\n\n```\nappears to be used as a mass-hosting web server by an Indian marketing and web\ndevelopment company, [I Knowledge Factory (IKF). Perhaps unsurprisingly, a variety of](https://www.ikf.co.in/)\nlegitimate domains resolve to it, all seemingly belonging to legitimate Indian entities. An IKF\nmail server is also used (through a CNAME) as an MX record for niv[.]co.in.\n\nIt remains unclear at the time of writing why IKF chose to host at least some of their\ncustomers’ infrastructure in Germany, far away (in both geographic and network terms) from\ntheir (presumed) main audience in the India vicinity.\n\nFurther, IKF’s nameserver setup struck us as odd, with the primary nameserver serving\nniv[.]co.in and others, ns.iknowledgefactory.com, resolving to 103.73.189.76 — allocated to\nEvoke Digital Solutions in India — while having its PTR DNS record set to email.lkf.in. This\ndomain (note the similarity of “l” and “i”) however is currently available for sale, and does not\nseem to be under control of IKF anymore.\n\nAccording to niv[.]co.in’s [SPF policy, any IP address projectcell.niv[.]co.in resolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework)\nto is explicitly permitted to emit e-mails for this domain. This includes 173.249.33[.]80,\nwhich DCSO assesses as likely being under control by Andariel.\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, it has to be noted that the official website of the National Institute of Virology is\n```\nniv.icmr.org.in, a fact also advertised on niv[.]co.in — which appears to have been\n\n```\nabandoned by NIV or IKF commencing October 2022. Rather than letting previously used\ndomains orphan or even expire, it is crucial to set up proper redirects to the new primary\ndomain, and ensure the respective organization maintains control over its domain set all the\ntime.\n\n## Malware analysis\n\nThe malware itself is a basic loader. It can download files, execute shell commands and send\nback the console output.\n\nCommunication happens via HTTP which is manually implemented using socket functions,\nand as such it is not capable of communicating with HTTPS servers.\n\nThe client transfers data via POST requests, in which the data fields are encrypted using a\nsimple rotating xor + base64.\n\nExample request\nWe’ve identified the following fields:\n```\nid=     Xor keypage=    Status code (not encrypted)query=    Basic client\ninforep0=    Shell command output\n\n```\nThe page field contains basic client info, such as:\n```\n10.0.0.1|DESKTOP-BI961TX|batman|110|64\n\n```\nwhere the first field is a collection of local IP addresses, followed by the computer name,\nusername, Windows version as well as bitness of the system.\n\nThe server then responds either with HTTP 504, which signals the bot to stop running, or\nHTTP 500 which may contain a command and/or download payload in the HTTP body.\n\nIn case of HTTP 500 (shell command and/or download task) the HTTP body adheres to the\nfollowing format:\n```\n[10 bytes unused][8 bytes check string][8 bytes xor key][1 byte shell command length]\n[* shell command][1 byte download target path length][* download target path][*\ndownload payload]\n\n```\nAll fields following the xor key are encrypted with it using a simple rolling xor scheme.\n\nThe check string appears to be a magic 8 byte value the client verifies with a simple\nalgorithm, which is satisfied by the following magic bytes:\n```\n0b 15 1f 29 33 3d 47 51\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nExample code of the check algorithm in Python:\n```\nfor i in range(8):  assert(check_string[i] == ((i+1)*10+1))\n\n```\nBased on this, we’ve created a Suricata rule which we’re distributing as part of the IoCs.\n\nIf a download target path is specified in the response, the malware will write the payload to\nthe specified path and copy Explorer.exe’s timestamps to it in order to disguise the file. In\ncase the downloaded file is an EXE file it will also pad the executable with 40,000,000\n(~40MB) random bytes on disk, likely to exceed some security software’s file limits and/or\ngenerate a unique hashsum for downloaded binaries.\n\nIf a shell command is specified, the malware will execute the shell command, capture the\noutput and send the contents back to the C2 using the rep0 POST request field.\n\n## IoCs\n\n[You can also find the accompanying IoCs in form of a MISP event on our GitHub.](https://github.com/DCSO/Blog_CyTec/blob/main/2023_05__andariel_niv/misp.event.json)\n```\nSamples\nc28bb61de4a6ad1c5e225ad9ec2eaf4a6c8ccfff40cf45a640499c0adb0d8740\n9a5504dcfb7e664259bfa58c46cfd33e554225daf1cedea2ec2a9d83bbbfe238\naa29bf4292b68d197f4d8ca026b97ec7785796edcb644db625a8f8b66733ab54\n772b06f34facf6a2ce351b8679ff957cf601ef3ad29645935cb050b4184c8d51\n664f8d19af3400a325998b332343a9304f03bab9738ddab1530869eff13dae54\n34d5a5d8bec893519f204b573c33d54537b093c52df01b3d8c518af08ee94947\n\nC2\nhxxp://projectcell.niv.co[.]in/non_scientific/service.php\nhxxp://40.121.90[.]194/help.php\nhxxp://3.89.226[.]234/login.php\nhxxp://sora[.]bz/xoops_root_path/uploads/information/about.php\nhxxp://sora[.]bz/xoops_root_path/templates_c/login.php\nhxxp://eflow.co[.]kr/member_image/about.php\n\nMutex\nP_FLY_H@CK\nalert http any any -> [$HOME_NET] any (msg: \"DCSO MALWARE Andariel C2\";\nflow:to_client; http.response_body; content:\"|0b 15 1f 29 33 3d 47 51|\"; offset:10;\ndepth:10; reference:url,https://medium.com/@DCSO_CyTec/49a9d04acbc6;\nclasstype:command-and-control; sid:3200000; rev:1;)\n\n```\n\n-----",
