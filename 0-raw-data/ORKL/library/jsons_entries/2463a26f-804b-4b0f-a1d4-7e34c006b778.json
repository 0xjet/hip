    "plain_text": "# Compromised, Serving Up Flash Zero-Day Exploit\n\n[Less than a week after uncovering Operation SnowMan, the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence cloud](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2014/02/operation-snowman-deputydog-actor-compromises-us-veterans-of-foreign-wars-website.html)\n\nhas identified another targeted attack campaign — this one exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Flash.\n\nWe are collaborating with Adobe security on this issue. Adobe has assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014\n[0502 to this vulnerability and released a security bulletin.](http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-07.html)\n\nAs of this blog post, visitors to at least three nonprofit institutions — two of which focus on matters of\n\nnational security and public policy — were redirected to an exploit server hosting the zero-day exploit.\n\nWe’re dubbing this attack “Operation GreedyWonk.”\n\n[We believe GreedyWonk may be related to a May 2012 campaign outlined by ShadowServer, based](http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/)\n\non consistencies in tradecraft (particularly with the websites chosen for this strategic Web compromise),\n\nattack infrastructure, and malware configuration properties.\n\nThe group behind this campaign appears to have sufficient resources (such as access to zero-day exploits)\n\nand a determination to infect visitors to foreign and public policy websites. The threat actors likely sought\n\nto infect users to these sites for follow-on data theft, including information related to defense and public\n\npolicy matters.\n\n## Discovery\n\nOn Feb. 13, FireEye identified a zero-day Adobe Flash exploit that affects the latest version of the Flash\n\nPlayer (12.0.0.4 and 11.7.700.261). Visitors to the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics\n\n(www.piie[.]com) were redirected to an exploit server hosting this Flash zero-day through a hidden\n\niframe.\n\nWe subsequently found that the American Research Center in Egypt (www.arce[.]org) and the Smith\n\nRichardson Foundation (www.srf[.]org) also redirected visitors the exploit server. All three organizations\n\nare nonprofit institutions; the Peterson Institute and Smith Richardson Foundation engage in national\n\nsecurity and public policy issues.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nTo bypass Windows’ Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections, this exploit targets\n\ncomputers with any of the following configurations:\n\nWindows XP\n\nWindows 7 and Java 1 6\n\n\n-----\n\n[Users can mitigate the threat by upgrading from Windows XP and updating Java and Office. If you](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/corporate/executive-perspectives/2014/02/windows-xp-catch-if-you-cannot-patch.html)\n\nhave Java 1.6, update Java to the latest 1.7 version. If you are using an out-of-date Microsoft Office 2007\n\nor 2010, update Microsoft Office to the latest version.\n\nThese mitigations do not patch the underlying vulnerability. But by breaking the exploit’s ASLR-bypass\n\nmeasures, they do prevent the current in-the-wild exploit from functioning.\n\n## Vulnerability analysis\n\nGreedyWonk targets a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The vulnerability permits an\n\nattacker to overwrite the vftable pointer of a Flash object to redirect code execution.\n\n## ASLR bypass\n\nThe attack uses only known ASLR bypasses. Details of these techniques are available from our previous\n\n**blog post on the subject (in the “Non-ASLR modules” section).**\n\nFor Windows XP, the attackers build a return-oriented programming (ROP) chain of MSVCRT (Visual C\n\nruntime) gadgets with hard-coded base addresses for English (“en”) and Chinese (“zh-cn” and “zh-tw”).\n\nOn Windows 7, the attackers use a hard-coded ROP chain for MSVCR71.dll (Visual C++ runtime) if the\n\nuser has Java 1.6, and a hard-coded ROP chain for HXDS.dll (Help Data Services Module) if the user has\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 or 2010.\n\nJava 1.6 is no longer supported and does not receive security updates. In addition to the MSVCR71.dll\n\nASLR bypass, a variety of widely exploited code-execution vulnerabilities exist in Java 1.6. That’s why\n\nFireEye strongly recommends upgrading to Java 1.7.\n\nThe Microsoft Office HXDS.dll ASLR bypass was patched at the end of 2013. More details about this\n\n[bypass are addressed by Microsoft’s Security Bulletin MS13-106 and an accompanying blog entry.](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-106)\n\nFireEye strongly recommends updating Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010 with the latest patches.\n\n## Shellcode analysis\n\nThe shellcode is downloaded in ActionScript as a GIF image. Once ROP marks the shellcode as executable\n\nusing Windows’ VirtualProtect function, it downloads an executable via the InternetOpenURLA and\n\n_InternetReadFile functions. Then it writes the file to disk with CreateFileA and WriteFile functions._\n\nFinally, it runs the file using the WinExec function.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the exploit succeeds, a PlugX/Kaba remote access tool (RAT) payload with the MD5 hash\n\n507aed81e3106da8c50efb3a045c5e2b is installed on the compromised endpoint. This PlugX sample was\n\ncompiled on Feb. 12, one day before we first observed it, indicating that it was deployed specifically for\n\nthis campaign.\n\nThis PlugX payload was configured with the following command-and-control (CnC) domains:\n\njava.ns1[.]name\n\nadservice.no-ip[.]org\n\nwmi.ns01[.]us\n\nSample callback traffic was as follows:\n\nPOST /D28419029043311C6F8BF9F5 HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nHHV1: 0\n\nHHV2: 0\n\nHHV3: 61456\n\nHHV4: 1\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;\n\nInfoPath.2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; SV1)\n\nHost: java.ns1.name\n\nContent-Length: 0\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n## Campaign analysis\n\nBoth java.ns1[.]name and adservice.no-ip[.]org resolved to 74.126.177.68 on Feb. 18, 2014. Passive DNS\n\nanalysis reveals that the domain wmi.ns01.us previously resolved to 103.246.246.103 between July 4,\n\n2013 and July 15, 2013 and 192.74.246.219 on Feb. 17, 2014. java.ns1[.]name also resolved to\n\n192.74.246.219 on February 18.\n\n|Domain|First Seen|Last Seen|IP Address|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|adservice.no-ip[.]org|2014-02-18|2014-02-19|74.126.177.68|\n|java.ns1[.]name|2014-02-18|2014-02-19|74.126.177.68|\n|java.ns1[.]name|2014-02-18|2014-02-18|192.74.246.219|\n|wmi.ns01[.]us|2014-02-17|2014-02-17|192.74.246.219|\n|proxy.ddns[.]info|2013-05-02|2014-02-18|103.246.246.103|\n\n\n-----\n\nwmi.ns01[.]us 2013-07-04 2013-07-15 103.246.246.103\n\nFurther research uncovered a number of older malware samples connecting to the same domain\n\nwmi.ns01[.]us.\n\n**MD5** **Family** **Compile** **Alternate C2s**\n**Time**\n\n7995a9a6a889b914e208eb924e459ebc PlugX 2012-06-09 fuckchina.govnb[.]com\nbf60b8d26bc0c94dda2e3471de6ec977 PlugX 2010-03-15 microsafes.no-ip[.]org\nfd69793bd63c44bbb22f9c4d46873252 Poison 2013-03-07 N/A\n\nIvy\n\n88b375e3b5c50a3e6c881bc96c926928 Poison 2012-06-11 N/A\n\nIvy\n\ncd07a9e49b1f909e1bd9e39a7a6e56b4 Poison 2012-06-11 N/A\n\nIvy\n\n**Domain** **First Seen** **Last Seen** **IP Address**\nfuckchina.govnb[.]com 2013-12-11 2013-12-11 204.200.222.136\nmicrosafes.no-ip[.]org 2014-02-12 2014-02-12 74.126.177.70\nmicrosafes.no-ip[.]org 2013-12-04 2013-12-04 74.126.177.241\n\nThe Poison Ivy variants that connected to the domain wmi.ns01[.]us had the following unique\n\nconfiguration properties:\n\n**MD5** **Password** **Mutex**\nfd69793bd63c44bbb22f9c4d46873252 java7 NBCD*&^FE\n88b375e3b5c50a3e6c881bc96c926928 admin ytf^&^333\ncd07a9e49b1f909e1bd9e39a7a6e56b4 admin ytf^&^333\n\nWe found a related Poison Ivy sample (MD5 8936c87a08ffa56d19fdb87588e35952) with the same “java7”\n\npassword, which was dropped by an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2012-0779).

This exploit, in turn, dropped the Poison Ivy variant. In addition](http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/)\n\nto using the same password “java7,” this variant was configured with the mutex with the similar pattern of\n\n“YFds*&^ff” and connected to a CnC server at windows.ddns[.]us.\n\nUsing passive DNS analysis, we see the domains windows.ddns[.]us and wmi.ns01[.]us both resolved to\n\n76.73.80.188 in mid-2012.\n\n|MD5|Col2|Family|Col4|Compile Time|Col6|Alternate C2s|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7995a9a6a889b914e208eb924e459ebc||PlugX||2012-06-09||fuckchina.govnb[.]com||\n|bf60b8d26bc0c94dda2e3471de6ec977||PlugX||2010-03-15||microsafes.no-ip[.]org||\n|fd69793bd63c44bbb22f9c4d46873252||Poison Ivy||2013-03-07||N/A||\n|88b375e3b5c50a3e6c881bc96c926928||Poison Ivy||2012-06-11||N/A||\n|cd07a9e49b1f909e1bd9e39a7a6e56b4||Poison Ivy||2012-06-11||N/A||\n|Domain|First Seen||Last Seen||IP Address|||\n|fuckchina.govnb[.]com|2013-12-11||2013-12-11||204.200.222.136|||\n|microsafes.no-ip[.]org|2014-02-12||2014-02-12||74.126.177.70|||\n|microsafes.no-ip[.]org|2013-12-04||2013-12-04||74.126.177.241|||\n\n|MD5|Password|Mutex|\n|---|---|---|\n|fd69793bd63c44bbb22f9c4d46873252|java7|NBCD*&^FE|\n|88b375e3b5c50a3e6c881bc96c926928|admin|ytf^&^333|\n|cd07a9e49b1f909e1bd9e39a7a6e56b4|admin|ytf^&^333|\n\n|Domain|First Seen|Last Seen|IP Address|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|wmi.ns01.us|2012-07-07|2012-09-19|76.73.80.188|\n|windows.ddns.us|2012-05-23|2012-06-10|76.73.80.188|\n\n\n-----\n\nexploit test.jar (MD5 7d810e3564c4eb95bcb3d11ce191208e).

The domain ids.ns01[.]us also overlaps with the\n\ndomain wmi.ns01[.]us on the IP 194.183.224.75.\n\n**Domain** **First Seen** **Last Seen** **IP Address**\nwmi.ns01[.]us 2012-07-03 2012-07-04 194.183.224.75\nids.ns01[.]us 2012-04-23 2012-05-18 194.183.224.75\n\nThe Poison Ivy sample referenced above (MD5 fd69793bd63c44bbb22f9c4d46873252) was delivered via\n\nan exploit chain that began with a redirect from the Center for European Policy Studies (www.ceps[.]be).\n\nIn this case, visitors were redirected from www.ceps[.]be to a Java exploit hosted on shop.fujifilm[.]be.\n\nIn what is certainly not a coincidence, we also observed www.arce[.]org (one of the sites redirecting to the\n\ncurrent Flash exploit) also redirect visitors to the Java exploit on shop.fujifilm[.]be in 2013.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis threat actor clearly seeks out and compromises websites of organizations related to international\n\nsecurity policy, defense topics, and other non-profit sociocultural issues. The actor either maintains\n\npersistence on these sites for extended periods of time or is able to re-compromise them periodically.\n\nThis actor also has early access to a number of zero-day exploits, including Flash and Java, and deploys a\n\nvariety of malware families on compromised systems. Based on these and other observations, we conclude\n\nthat this actor has the tradecraft abilities and resources to remain a credible threat in at least the mid\nterm.\n\n|Domain|First Seen|Last Seen|IP Address|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|wmi.ns01[.]us|2012-07-03|2012-07-04|194.183.224.75|\n|ids.ns01[.]us|2012-04-23|2012-05-18|194.183.224.75|\n\n\n-----",
