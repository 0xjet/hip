    "plain_text": "# The awakening: Group-IB uncovers new corporate espionage attacks by RedCurl\n\n**group-ib.com/media/red-curl-threat-report/**\n\nGroup-IB, one of the leading solution providers dedicated to detecting and preventing\ncyberattacks, identifying online fraud, investigating high-tech crimes, and intellectual property\nprotection, detected new attacks by RedCurl, a corporate cyber espionage threat actor\ntargeting companies in various industries. Group-IB’s latest report [“RedCurl: The awakening”](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/red-curl-2.html?utm_source=press_release&utm_campaign=redcurl2-en&utm_medium=organic)\ndetails how the adversary’s tactics and tools have evolved. Since the beginning of 2021,\nRedCurl has carried out four attacks, bringing the total count to 30.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast year, in the report [“RedCurl. The pentest you didn’t know about” Group-IB researchers](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/red-curl.html?utm_source=press_release&utm_campaign=redcurl1-en&utm_medium=organic)\ndescribed for the first time a new Russian-speaking hacker group that they had codenamed\nRedCurl. Between 2018 and 2020, the threat actor carried out at least 26 attacks. Group-IB\nidentified 14 victim organizations across various countries and industries. Victims included\ncompanies in the fields of construction, finance, consulting, retail, insurance, and law located\nin the UK, Germany, Canada, Norway, Russia, and Ukraine. Seven months later, in 2021,\nRedСurl attacks resumed.\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system detected RedCurl’s updated arsenal\nas it appeared: after a long break, the group returned to the corporate cyber espionage\n\n\n-----\n\narena. In every attack, the threat actor demonstrates extensive red teaming skills and the\nability to bypass traditional anti-virus detection using their own custom malware. This means\nthat more and more companies are likely to fall victim to the group, which conducts wellprepared targeted attacks aimed at stealing internal corporate documentation. Commercial\nCorporate cyber espionage remains a rare and largely unique phenomenon. We cannot rule\nout, however, that RedCurl’s success could set a new trend in the cybercrime space.\n\n**Ivan Pisarev**\n\nHead of the Dynamic Malware Analysis Team at Group-IB\n\n## Wholesale and retail attacks\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, Group-IB Threat Intelligence team has identified four attacks.\nOne of the victims was a Russian wholesale company, which RedCurl attacked twice. The\nlocation of the two other victims remains unknown. Immediately after discovering traces\nof the attack, Group-IB specialists contacted the identified victim, shared all the relevant\ninformation, and provided recommendations to contain the incident and prevent it from\nspreading.\n\nDuring the lull in its activities, the group significantly improved their arsenal used during\nthoroughly prepared cyber espionage attacks that can only be detected by a highly qualified\ncybersecurity team. For example, analysis of RedCurl’s latest attacks revealed that the kill\nchain for “patient zero” (between receiving the phishing email and launching the module\nresponsible for executing) had grown from three to five stages. Among other improvements,\nthe group added a new reconnaissance tool whose code shares many similarities with the\nFirstStageAgent module (Group-IB named the tool FSABIN), as well as a PowerShell\ndownloader for the tool. The overall kill chain is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore an attack, RedCurl examines their victim thoroughly by collecting information about\nthe target from public sources. The group’s signature move is sending spear phishing emails\npurporting to come from the victim organization’s HR department. RedCurl actively uses\nsocial engineering: as a rule, email headers contain information about changes to staff\nincentive programs or other company news. Employees are often lured into clicking on a link\nwith the promise of bonuses.\n\nAfter infecting a computer in the victim’s network, RedCurl collects information about its\ninfrastructure. The hackers are mainly interested in the name and version of the infected\nsystem, the list of network and logical drives, and the list of passwords. Group-IB Threat\nIntelligence team discovered that information from the infected device, the IP address, and\nthe time that the request was received were saved in a separate file on the server side.\nIt is noteworthy that before the latter took place, the time was adjusted according to the time\nzone in Minsk (UTC+3).\n\n## Slow but steady\n\nRedCurl is known for its patience: the time from “patient zero” becoming infected to data\nbeing stolen can be anywhere from two to six months. The group does not use popular postexploitation tools such as CobaltStrike and Meterpreter. Moreover, they have never been\nseen using typical ways of controlling compromised devices remotely. Instead, the hackers\nuse self-developed tools and some publicly available programs to gain initial access, achieve\npersistence, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive documentation. All this means that\nRedCurl’s modus operandi remains unique.\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB has noted that despite a high level of control over the victim s network, RedCurl\ndoes not encrypt infrastructure, withdraw money from accounts, or demand ransoms for\nstolen data. This most likely indicates that the group monetizes on its attacks in a different\nway. The group strives to obtain valuable information as covertly as possible. RedCurl\nis mainly interested in the following types of files: business emails, staff records, documents\nrelating to various legal entities, court records, and other internal information. Even after the\nattack has ended, victims could remain unaware that confidential information has been\nexfiltrated to RedCurl’s servers.\n\nGroup-IB’s new report offers recommendations that IT and cybersecurity teams should follow\nregardless of a company’s size and industry. To better understand RedCurl’s techniques,\ntactics, and procedures (TTPs), Group-IB publishes the MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial\nTactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge) matrix based on Group-IB’s experience\nin responding to and analyzing the group’s attacks.\n\n\n-----",
