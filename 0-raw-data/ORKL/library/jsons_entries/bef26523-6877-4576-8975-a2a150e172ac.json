    "plain_text": "# Advisory\n\n### Russian FSB cyber actor Star Blizzard continues worldwide spear-phishing campaigns.\n\n###### Updated and new research, updated\n\n vulnerabilities, security updates and revised\n\n actors.\n\n**7 December 2023**\n\n Crown Copyright 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## Russian FSB cyber actor Star\n\n Blizzard continues worldwide\n\n spear-phishing campaigns\n\n###### The Russia-based actor is targeting organisations and individuals in the UK and other geographical areas of interest\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Russia-based actor Star Blizzard (formerly known as SEABORGIUM, also\nknown as Callisto Group/TA446/COLDRIVER/TAG-53/BlueCharlie) continues\nto successfully use spear-phishing attacks against targeted organisations\nand individuals in the UK, and other geographical areas of interest, for\ninformation-gathering activity.\n\nThe UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the US Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), the US National Security Agency (NSA), the US Cyber\nNational Mission Force (CNMF), the Australian Signals Directorate’s\nAustralian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), the Canadian Centre for\nCyber Security (CCCS), and the New Zealand National Cyber Security\nCentre (NCSC-NZ) assess that Star Blizzard is almost certainly subordinate\nto the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Centre 18.\n\nIndustry has previously published details of Star Blizzard. This advisory\n[draws on that body of information.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis advisory raises awareness of the spear-phishing techniques Star\nBlizzard uses to target individuals and organisations. This activity is\ncontinuing through 2023.\n\n#### Targeting profile\n\nSince 2019, Star Blizzard has targeted sectors including academia, defence,\ngovernmental organisations, NGOs, think tanks and politicians.\n\nTargets in the UK and US appear to have been most affected by Star\nBlizzard activity, however activity has also been observed against targets in\nother NATO countries, and countries neighbouring Russia.\n\nDuring 2022, Star Blizzard activity appeared to expand further, to include\n\ndefence-industrial targets, as well as US Department of Energy facilities.\n\n#### Outline of the attacks\n\nThe activity is typical of spear-phishing campaigns, where an actor targets\na specific individual or group using information known to be of interest to\nthe targets. In a spear-phishing campaign, an actor perceives their target\nto have direct access to information of interest, be an access vector to\nanother target, or both.\n\n###### Research and preparation\n\nUsing open-source resources to conduct reconnaissance, including social\nmedia and professional networking platforms, Star Blizzard identifies hooks\nto engage their target. They take the time to research their interests and\n[identify their real-world social or professional contacts. [T1589;](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/) [T1593]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593/)\n\nStar Blizzard creates email accounts impersonating known contacts of\ntheir targets to help appear legitimate. They also create fake social media\n[or networking profiles that impersonate respected experts [T1585.001] and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001/)\nhave used supposed conference or event invitations as lures.\n\n\n-----\n\nStar Blizzard uses webmail addresses from different providers, including\nOutlook, Gmail, Yahoo and Proton mail in their initial approach [[T1585.002],](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/002/)\nimpersonating known contacts of the target or well-known names in the\ntarget’s field of interest or sector.\n\nTo appear authentic, the actor also creates malicious domains resembling\nlegitimate organisations [T1583.001].\n\n[Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) provides a list of observed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\n[Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in their SEABORGIUM blog, but this is not](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\nexhaustive.\n\n###### Preference for personal email addresses\n\nStar Blizzard has predominantly sent spear-phishing emails to targets’\npersonal email addresses, although they have also used targets’ corporate\nor business email addresses. The actors may intentionally use personal\nemails to circumvent security controls in place on corporate networks.\n\n###### Building a rapport\n\nHaving taken the time to research their targets’ interests and contacts to\ncreate a believable approach, Star Blizzard now starts to build trust. They\noften begin by establishing benign contact on a topic they hope will\nengage their targets. There is often some correspondence between\nattacker and target, sometimes over an extended period, as the attacker\nbuilds rapport.\n\n##### Delivery of malicious link\n\nOnce trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and\n[shares a link [T1566.002], apparently to a document or website of interest.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis leads the target to an actor-controlled server, prompting the target to\nenter account credentials.\n\nThe malicious link may be a URL in an email message, or the actor may\n[embed a link in a document [T1566.001] on OneDrive, Google Drive, or other](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)\n[file-sharing platforms.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/continued-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe-observed-by-tag/)\n\nStar Blizzard uses the open-source framework EvilGinx in their spearphishing activity, which allows them to harvest credentials and session\n[cookies to successfully bypass the use of two-factor authentication [T1539;](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/)\n[T1550.004].](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004/)\n\n##### Exploitation and further activity\n\nWhichever delivery method is used, once the target clicks on the malicious\nURL, they are directed to an actor-controlled server that mirrors the sign-in\npage for a legitimate service. Any credentials entered at this point are now\ncompromised.\n\nStar Blizzard then uses the stolen credentials to log in to a target’s email\n[account [T1078], where they are known to access and steal emails and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)\n[attachments from the victim’s inbox [T1114.002]. They have also set up mail-](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/002/)\nforwarding rules, giving them ongoing visibility of victim correspondence\n\n[[T1114.003].](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003/)\n\nThe actor has also used their access to a victim email account to access\nmailing-list data and a victim’s contacts list, which they then use for followon targeting. They have also used compromised email accounts for further\n[phishing activity [T1586.002].](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/002/)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nSpear-phishing is an established technique used by many actors, and Star\nBlizzard uses it successfully, evolving the technique to maintain their\nsuccess.\n\n\n-----\n\nIndividuals and organisations from previously targeted sectors should be\nvigilant of the techniques described in this advisory.\n\n[In the UK you can report related suspicious activity to the NCSC](https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/)\n\nInformation on effective defence against spear-phishing is included in the\n‘Mitigation’ section below.\n\n#### MITRE ATT&CK®\n\nThis report has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a\nglobally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based\non real-world observations.\n\n\nhost their phishing framework.\n\n\n**Development**\n\n\n[01](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001/)\n\n\nDomains\n\n|Tactic ID Technique Procedure|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Reconnaissance|T1593|Search Open Websites/Domains|Star Blizzard uses open-source research and social media to identify information about victims to use in targeting.|\n|Reconnaissance|T1589|Gather Victim Identity Information|Star Blizzard uses online data sets and open-source resources to gather information about their targets.|\n|Resource Development|T1585.0 01|Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts|Star Blizzard has been observed establishing fraudulent profiles on professional networking sites to conduct reconnaissance.|\n|Resource Development|T1585.0 02|Establish Accounts: Email Accounts|Star Blizzard registers consumer email accounts matching the names of individuals they are impersonating to conduct spear-phishing activity.|\n|Resource Development|T1583.0 01|Acquire Infrastructure: Domains|Star Blizzard registers domains to host their phishing framework.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tactic ID Technique Procedure|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Resource Development|T1586.0 02|Compromise Accounts: Email Accounts|Star Blizzard has been observed using compromised victim email accounts to conduct spear-phishing activity against contacts of the original victim.|\n|Initial Access|T1078|Valid Accounts|Star Blizzard uses compromised credentials, captured from fake log- in pages, to log in to valid victim user accounts.|\n|Initial Access|T1566.0 01|Phishing: Spear-phishing Attachment|Star Blizzard uses malicious links embedded in email attachments to direct victims to their credential- stealing sites.|\n|Initial Access|T1566.0 02|Phishing: Spear-phishing Link|Star Blizzard sends spear-phishing emails with malicious links directly to credential-stealing sites, or to documents hosted on a file-sharing site, which then direct victims to credential-stealing sites.|\n|Defence Evasion|T1550.0 04|Use Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie|Star Blizzard bypasses multi-factor authentication on victim email accounts by using session cookies stolen using EvilGinx.|\n|Credential Access|T1539|Steal Web Session Cookie|Star Blizzard uses EvilGinx to steal the session cookies of victims directed to their fake log-in domains.|\n|Collection|T1114.00 2|Email Collection: Remote Email Collection|Star Blizzard interacts directly with externally facing Exchange services, Office 365 and Google Workspace to access email and steal information using compromised credentials or access tokens.|\n|Collection|T1114.00 3|Email Collection: Email Forwarding Rule|Star Blizzard abuses email- forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and maintain persistent access to victim's emails, even after compromised credentials are reset.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mitigation\n\nA number of mitigations will be useful in defending against the activity\ndescribed in this advisory.\n\n**>** **Use strong passwords. Use a separate password for email accounts and**\n**avoid password re-use across multiple services. See NCSC guidance:**\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secureonline/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email\n\n**>** **Use multi-factor authentication (/2-factor authentication/two-step**\nauthentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See\n[NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services)\n[authentication-online-services and](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services)\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa)\n\n**>** **Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the**\nlatest supported versions, apply security updates promptly, use anti-virus\nand scan regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC\n[guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/antivirus-and-other-security-software)\n[antivirus-and-other-security-software](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/antivirus-and-other-security-software)\n\n**>** **Exercise vigilance. Spear-phishing emails are tailored to avoid suspicion.**\nYou may recognise the sender’s name, but has the email come from an\naddress that you recognise? Would you expect contact from this person’s\nwebmail address rather than their corporate email address? Has the\nsuspicious email come to your personal/webmail address, rather than\nyour corporate one? Can you verify that the email is legitimate via another\n[means? See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing) and https://\n[www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts)\n\n**>** **Enable your email providers’ automated email scanning features. These**\nare turned on by default for consumer mail providers. See NCSC guidance:\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/telling-users-to-avoid-clicking-bad-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/telling-users-to-avoid-clicking-bad-links-still-isnt-working)\n[links-still-isnt-working](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/telling-users-to-avoid-clicking-bad-links-still-isnt-working)\n\n**>** **Disable mail-forwarding. Attackers have been observed to set up mail-**\nforwarding rules to maintain visibility of target emails. If you cannot\ndisable mail-forwarding, then monitor settings regularly to ensure that a\nforwarding rule has not been set up by an external malicious actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis report draws on information derived from NCSC and industry sources.
