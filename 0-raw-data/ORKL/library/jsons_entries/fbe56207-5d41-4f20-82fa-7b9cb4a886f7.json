This secret 'zyfwp' account allowed\nusers to login via SSH and the web interface to gain administrator privileges.\n\nIn an [advisory, Zyxel states that they used the secret account to deliver firmware updates](http://www.zyxel.com/support/CVE-2020-29583.shtml)\nvia FTP automatically.\n\nThis backdoor is a significant risk as it could allow threat actors to create VPN accounts to\ngain access to internal networks or port forward Internal services to make them remotely\naccessible and exploitable.\n\n## Threat actors actively scan for Zyxel backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n[Yesterday, cybersecurity intelligence firm GreyNoise detected three different IP addresses](https://greynoise.io/)\n[actively scanning for SSH devices and attempting to login to them using the Zyxel backdoor](https://viz.greynoise.io/query/?gnql=tags%3A%22Zyxel%20USG%20SSH%20Backdoor%20Attempt%22)\ncredentials.\n\n**IP address scanning for Zyxel SSH backdoor**\n[GreyNoise CEO Andrew Morris told BleepingComputer that the threat actor does not](https://twitter.com/Andrew___Morris)\nappear to be scanning specifically for Zyxel devices but is instead scanning the Internet for\nIP addresses running SSH.\n\nWhen SSH is detected, it will attempt to brute force an account on the device, with one of\nthe credentials tested being the new Zyxel 'zyfwp' backdoor account.\n\nOf particular interest is that [one of the IP addresses is using the built-in SSH client of Cobalt](https://viz.greynoise.io/ip/185.153.196.230)\nStrike to perform the scans. Morris told BleepingComputer that the actor might be scanning\nthis way to evade threat intelligence vendors.\n\nSince May of this year, GreyNoise has observed an unknown actor quietly\nfingerprinting SSH honeypots on the Internet, exclusively through Tor. The actor is\nusing Cobalt Strike's SSH client. This is likely being done to avoid threat intelligence\n[vendors.https://t.co/UUN9VCuyfG](https://t.co/UUN9VCuyfG) [pic.twitter.com/vGxInpR84M](https://t.co/vGxInpR84M)\n\n[— GreyNoise (@GreyNoiseIO) September 16, 2020](https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1306332131434659847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nZyxel released the 'ZLD V4.60 Patch 1' last month that removes the backdoor accounts on\nfirewall devices. Zyxel announced yesterday that they would release the patch for\nAP controllers on January 8th, 2021.\n\nBleepingComputer strongly recommends that all users install the patch as soon as possible\nto prevent threat actors from gaining access to vulnerable networks, deploying ransomware,\nor stealing data.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers are exploiting critical bug in Zyxel firewalls and VPNs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-are-exploiting-critical-bug-in-zyxel-firewalls-and-vpns/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Zyxel patches critical bug affecting firewall and VPN devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zyxel-patches-critical-bug-affecting-firewall-and-vpn-devices/)\n\n[Zyxel warns of flaws impacting firewalls, APs, and controllers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zyxel-warns-of-flaws-impacting-firewalls-aps-and-controllers/)\n\n[BPFDoor: Stealthy Linux malware bypasses firewalls for remote access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-stealthy-linux-malware-bypasses-firewalls-for-remote-access/)\n\n[Protect your devices anywhere with this portable VPN, Firewall deal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/protect-your-devices-anywhere-with-this-portable-vpn-firewall-deal/)\n\n[Backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Firewall](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/firewall/)\n[SSH](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ssh/)\n[VPN](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vpn/)\n[Zyxel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zyxel/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
