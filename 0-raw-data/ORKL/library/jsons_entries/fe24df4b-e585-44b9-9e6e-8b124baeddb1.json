See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)_\n_actor techniques._\n\nThis product was written by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with\ncontributions from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). CISA and FBI are aware of an\nIran-based malicious cyber actor targeting several U.S. federal agencies and other U.S.based networks. Analysis of the threat actor’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicates a correlation with the group known by the\nnames, Pioneer Kitten and UNC757. This threat actor has been observed exploiting several\npublicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) dealing with Pulse Secure\nvirtual private network (VPN), Citrix NetScaler, and F5 vulnerabilities. This threat actor used\nthese vulnerabilities to gain initial access to targeted networks and then maintained access\nwithin the successfully exploited networks for several months using multiple means of\npersistence.\n\nThis Advisory provides the threat actor’s TTPs, IOCs, and exploited CVEs to help\nadministrators and network defenders identify a potential compromise of their network and\nprotect their organization from future attacks.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-259A-Iran-Based_Threat_Actor_Exploits_VPN_Vulnerabilities_S508C.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nCISA and FBI are aware of a widespread campaign from an Iran-based malicious cyber\nactor targeting several industries mainly associated with information technology, government,\nhealthcare, financial, insurance, and media sectors across the United States. The threat\nactor conducts mass-scanning and uses tools, such as Nmap, to identify open ports. Once\nthe open ports are identified, the threat actor exploits CVEs related to VPN infrastructure to\ngain initial access to a targeted network. CISA and the FBI have observed the threat actor\nexploiting multiple CVEs, including CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-11539, CVE-2019-19781,\nand CVE-2020-5902.\n\nAfter gaining initial access to a targeted network, the threat actor obtains administrator-level\ncredentials and installs web shells allowing further entrenchment. After establishing a\nfoothold, the threat actor’s goals appear to be maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.\nThis threat actor has been observed selling access to compromised network infrastructure in\n\n\n-----\n\nan online hacker forum. Industry reporting indicates that the threat actor operates as a\ncontractor supporting Iranian government interests, but the malicious activity appears to also\nserve the threat actor’s own financial interests. The FBI notes this threat actor has the\ncapability, and likely the intent, to deploy ransomware on victim networks.\n\nCISA and FBI have observed this Iran-based threat actor relying on exploits of remote\nexternal services on internet-facing assets to gain initial access to victim networks. The\nthreat actor also relies heavily on open-source and operating system (OS) tooling to conduct\noperations, such as ngrok; fast reverse proxy (FRP); Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n(LDAP) directory browser; as well as web shells known as ChunkyTuna, Tiny, and China\nChopper.\n\nTable 1 illustrates some of the common tools this threat actor has used.\n\n_Table 1: Common exploit tools_\n\n**Tool** **Detail**\n\n\nChunkyTuna\nweb shell\n\nTiny web\nshell\n\nChina\nChopper\nweb shell\n\n\nChunkyTuna allows for chunked transfer encoding hypertext transfer\nprotocol (HTTP) that tunnels Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) streams\nover HTTP. The web shell allows for reverse connections to a server with\nthe intent to exfiltrate data.\n\nTiny uses Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) to create a backdoor. It has the\ncapability to allow a threat actor remote access to the system and can also\ntunnel or route traffic.\n\nChina Chopper is a web shell hosted on a web server and is mainly used\nfor web application attacks; it is configured in a client/server relationship.\nChina Chopper contains security scanners and can be used to upload files\nand brute-force passwords.\n\n\nFRPC FRPC is a modified version of the open-source FRP tool. It allows a system\n—inside a router or firewall providing Network Address Translation—to\nprovide network access to systems/operators located outside of the victim\nnetwork. In this case, FRPC was used as reverse proxy, tunneling Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS), giving the\nthreat actor primary persistence.\n\nChisel Chisel is a fast TCP tunnel over HTTP and secured via Secure Shell\n(SSH). It is a single executable that includes both client and server. The\ntool is useful for passing through firewalls, but it can also be used to\nprovide a secure form of communication to an endpoint on a victim\nnetwork.\n\nngrok ngrok is a tool used to expose a local port to the internet. Optionally,\ntunnels can be secured with TLS.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tool** **Detail**\n\nNmap Nmap is used for vulnerability scanning and network discovery.\n\n\nAngry IP\nScanner\n\n\nAngry IP Scanner is a scanner that can ping a range of Internet Protocol\n(IP) addresses to check if they are active and can also resolve hostnames,\nscan ports, etc.\n\n\nDrupwn Drupwn is a Python-based tool used to scan for vulnerabilities and exploit\nCVEs in Drupal devices.\n\nNotable means of detecting this threat actor:\n\nCISA and the FBI note that this group makes significant use of ngrok, which may\nappear as TCP port 443 connections to external cloud-based infrastructure.\nThe threat actor uses FRPC over port 7557.\n[Malware Analysis Report MAR-10297887-1.v1 details some of the tools this threat](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-259a)\nactor used against some victims.\n\nThe following file paths can be used to detect Tiny web shell, ChunkyTuna web shell, or\nChisel if a network has been compromised by this attacker exploiting CVE-2019-19781.\n\nTiny web shell\n```\n    /netscaler/ns_gui/admin_ui/rdx/core/css/images/css.php\n    /netscaler/ns_gui/vpn/images/vpn_ns_gui.php\n    /var/vpn/themes/imgs/tiny.php\n\n```\nChunkyTuna web shell\n```\n    /var/vpn/themes/imgs/debug.php\n    /var/vpn/themes/imgs/include.php\n    /var/vpn/themes/imgs/whatfile\n\n```\nChisel\n\n```\n    /var/nstmp/chisel\n\n```\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nAs indicated in table 2, the threat actor primarily gained initial access by using the publicly\navailable exploit for CVE-2019-19781. From there, the threat actor used the Citrix\nenvironment to establish a presence on an internal network server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 2: Initial access techniques_\n\n\n**ID**\n\n\n**Technique/Sub-**\n**Technique** **Context**\n\n\n[T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) Exploit PublicFacing\nApplication\n\n**Execution**\n\n\nThe threat actor primarily gained initial access by\ncompromising a Citrix NetScaler remote access server using a\npublicly available exploit for CVE-2019-19781. The threat actor\nalso exploited CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-11539, and CVE2020-5902.\n\n\nAfter gaining initial access, the threat actor began executing scripts, as shown in table 3.\n\n_Table 3: Execution techniques_\n\n**ID** **Technique/Sub-Technique** **Context**\n\n\n[T1059.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: PowerShell\n\n[T1059.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/) Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: Windows\nCommand Shell\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\nA PowerShell script ( keethief and\n```\nkee.ps1 ) was used to access KeePass\n\n```\ndata.\n```\ncmd.exe was launched via sticky keys that\n\n```\nwas likely used as a password changing\nmechanism.\n\n\nCISA observed the threat actor using the techniques identified in table 4 to establish\npersistence.\n\n_Table 4: Persistence techniques_\n\n\n**ID**\n\n\n**Technique/Sub-**\n**Technique** **Context**\n\n\n[T1053.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003/) Scheduled\nTask/Job: Cron\n\n[T1053.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/) Scheduled\nTask/Job:\nScheduled Task\n\n\nThe threat actor loaded a series of scripts to `cron and`\nran them for various purposes (mainly to access\nNetScaler web forms).\n\nThe threat actor installed and used FRPC ( frpc.exe ) on\nboth NetScaler and internal devices. The task was named\n```\nlpupdate and the binary was named svchost, which\n\n```\nwas the reverse proxy.
