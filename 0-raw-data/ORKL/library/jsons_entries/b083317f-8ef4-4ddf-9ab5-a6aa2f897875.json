This document\nprovides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and\nmilitary intelligence Services (RIS) to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints\nassociated with the U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. Government, political, and private\nsector entities. The U.S. Government is referring to this malicious cyber activity by RIS as\nGRIZZLY STEPPE.\n\nPrevious JARs have not attributed malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors.\nHowever, public attribution of these activities to RIS is supported by technical indicators from\nthe U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities. This\n[determination expands upon the Joint Statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national) released October 7, 2016, from the Department\nof Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security.\n\nThis activity by RIS is part of an ongoing campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the\nU.S. government and its citizens. These cyber operations have included spearphishing campaigns\ntargeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities,\npolitical organizations, and corporations leading to the theft of information. In foreign countries,\nRIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical\ninfrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind\nfalse online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack. This\nJAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations,\nsuggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to\nreport such incidents to the U.S. Government.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Description\n\nThe U.S. Government confirms that two different RIS actors participated in the intrusion into a\nU.S. political party. The first actor group, known as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 29,\nentered into the party’s systems in summer 2015, while the second, known as APT28, entered in\nspring 2016.

An dual-directional arrow from the x-tunnel to the targeted systems, \r\nrepresenting malicious commands being issued back and forth.\n\n**Figure 1: The tactics and techniques used by APT29 and APT 28 to conduct cyber intrusions against target systems**\n\nBoth groups have historically targeted government organizations, think tanks, universities, and\ncorporations around the world. APT29 has been observed crafting targeted spearphishing\ncampaigns leveraging web links to a malicious dropper; once executed, the code delivers Remote\nAccess Tools (RATs) and evades detection using a range of techniques. APT28 is known for\nleveraging domains that closely mimic those of targeted organizations and tricking potential\nvictims into entering legitimate credentials. APT28 actors relied heavily on shortened URLs in\ntheir spearphishing email campaigns. Once APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both\ngroups exfiltrate and analyze information to gain intelligence value. These groups use this\ninformation to craft highly targeted spearphishing campaigns. These actors set up operational\ninfrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure, host domains and malware for targeting\norganizations, establish command and control nodes, and harvest credentials and other valuable\ninformation from their targets.\n\nIn summer 2015, an APT29 spearphishing campaign directed emails containing a malicious link\nto over 1,000 recipients, including multiple U.S. Government victims. APT29 used legitimate\n\n\n-----\n\ndomains, to include domains associated with U.S. organizations and educational institutions, to\nhost malware and send spearphishing emails. In the course of that campaign, APT29 successfully\ncompromised a U.S. political party. At least one targeted individual activated links to malware\nhosted on operational infrastructure of opened attachments containing malware. APT29\ndelivered malware to the political party’s systems, established persistence, escalated privileges,\nenumerated active directory accounts, and exfiltrated email from several accounts through\nencrypted connections back through operational infrastructure.\n\nIn spring 2016, APT28 compromised the same political party, again via targeted spearphishing.\nThis time, the spearphishing email tricked recipients into changing their passwords through a\nfake webmail domain hosted on APT28 operational infrastructure. Using the harvested\ncredentials, APT28 was able to gain access and steal content, likely leading to the exfiltration of\ninformation from multiple senior party members. The U.S. Government assesses that information\nwas leaked to the press and publicly disclosed. APT29's use of spearphishing and stolen credentials. The graphic is divided into three vertical portions meant to delineate the adversary space (Russian Intelligence Service), the neutral space where actions are initiated, and the victim space.\r\n\r\n1.

The review of network perimeter netflow or firewall\nlogs will assist in determining whether your network has experienced suspicious activity.\n\nWhen reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find numerous\ninstances of these IPs attempting to connect to their systems. Upon reviewing the traffic from\nthese IPs, some traffic may correspond to malicious activity, and some may correspond to\nlegitimate activity. Some traffic that may appear legitimate is actually malicious, such as\nvulnerability scanning or browsing of legitimate public facing services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS,\nFTP). Connections from these IPs may be performing vulnerability scans attempting to identify\nwebsites that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or Structured Query Language (SQL)\ninjection attacks. If scanning identified vulnerable sites, attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities\nmay be experienced.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork administrators are encouraged to check their public-facing websites for the malicious\nfile hashes. System owners are also advised to run the Yara signature on any system that is\nsuspected to have been targeted by RIS actors.\n\n_Threats from IOCs_\nMalicious actors may use a variety of methods to interfere with information systems. Some\nmethods of attack are listed below. Guidance provided is applicable to many other computer\nnetworks.\n\n  - **_Injection Flaws are broad web application attack techniques that attempt to send_**\ncommands to a browser, database, or other system, allowing a regular user to control\nbehavior. The most common example is SQL injection, which subverts the relationship\nbetween a webpage and its supporting database, typically to obtain information contained\ninside the database. Another form is command injection, where an untrusted user is able\nto send commands to operating systems supporting a web application or database. See the\n[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Publication on SQL](https://www.us-cert.gov/security-publications/sql-injection)\n[Injection](https://www.us-cert.gov/security-publications/sql-injection) for more information.\n\n  - **_Cross-site scripting (XSS)_** **_vulnerabilities_** allow threat actors to insert and execute\nunauthorized code in web applications. Successful XSS attacks on websites can provide\nthe attacker unauthorized access. For prevention and mitigation strategies against XSS,\n[see US-CERT’s Alert on Compromised Web Servers and Web Shells.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-314A)\n\n  - **_Server vulnerabilities may be exploited to allow unauthorized access to sensitive_**\ninformation. An attack against a poorly configured server may allow an adversary access\nto critical information including any websites or databases hosted on the server. See USCERT’s Tip on [Website Security](https://www.us-cert.gov/security-publications/website-security) for additional information.\n\n## Recommended Mitigations\n\n_Commit to Cybersecurity Best Practices_\nA commitment to good cybersecurity and best practices is critical to protecting networks and\nsystems. Here are some questions you may want to ask your organization to help prevent and\nmitigate against attacks.\n\n1. **Backups: Do we backup all critical information? Are the backups stored offline? Have**\nwe tested our ability to revert to backups during an incident?\n2. **Risk Analysis: Have we conducted a cybersecurity risk analysis of the organization?**\n3. **Staff Training: Have we trained staff on cybersecurity best practices?**\n4. **Vulnerability Scanning & Patching: Have we implemented regular scans of our**\nnetwork and systems and appropriate patching of known system vulnerabilities?\n5. **Application Whitelisting: Do we allow only approved programs to run on our networks?**\n6. **Incident Response: Do we have an incident response plan and have we practiced it?**\n\n\n-----\n\n7. **Business Continuity: Are we able to sustain business operations without access to**\ncertain systems? For how long? Have we tested this?\n8. **Penetration Testing: Have we attempted to hack into our own systems to test the**\nsecurity of our systems and our ability to defend against attacks?\n\n_Top Seven Mitigation Strategies_\nDHS encourages network administrators to implement the recommendations below, which can\nprevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber-attacks. These strategies are common sense to\nmany, but DHS continues to see intrusions because organizations fail to use these basic\nmeasures.\n\n1. **Patch applications and operating systems – Vulnerable applications and operating**\nsystems are the targets of most attacks. Ensuring these are patched with the latest updates\ngreatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker. Use best\npractices when updating software and patches by only downloading updates from\nauthenticated vendor sites.\n2. **Application whitelisting – Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies because it**\nallows only specified programs to run while blocking all others, including malicious\nsoftware.\n3. **Restrict administrative privileges – Threat actors are increasingly focused on gaining**\ncontrol of legitimate credentials, especially those associated with highly privileged\naccounts. Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user’s duties. Separate\nadministrators into privilege tiers with limited access to other tiers.\n4. **Network Segmentation and Segregation into Security Zones – Segment networks into**\nlogical enclaves and restrict host-to-host communications paths. This helps protect\nsensitive information and critical services and limits damage from network perimeter\nbreaches.\n5. **Input validation** **– Input validation is a method of sanitizing untrusted user input**\nprovided by users of a web application, and may prevent many types of web application\nsecurity flaws, such as SQLi, XSS, and command injection.\n6. **File Reputation – Tune Anti-Virus file reputation systems to the most aggressive setting**\npossible; some products can limit execution to only the highest reputation files, stopping\na wide range of untrustworthy code from gaining control.\n7. **Understanding firewalls – When anyone or anything can access your network at any**\ntime, your network is more susceptible to being attacked. Firewalls can be configured to\nblock data from certain locations (IP whitelisting) or applications while allowing relevant\nand necessary data through.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Responding to Unauthorized Access to Networks_\n**Implement your security incident response and business continuity plan. It may take time**\nfor your organization’s IT professionals to isolate and remove threats to your systems and restore\nnormal operations. Meanwhile, you should take steps to maintain your organization’s essential\nfunctions according to your business continuity plan. Organizations should maintain and\nregularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business continuity procedures.\n\n**Contact DHS or law enforcement immediately. We encourage you to contact DHS NCCIC**\n[(NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov](mailto:soc@us-cert.gov) or 888-282-0870), the FBI through a local field office or\n[the FBI’s Cyber Division (CyWatch@ic.fbi.gov](mailto:CyWatch@ic.fbi.gov) or 855-292-3937) to report an intrusion and to\nrequest incident response resources or technical assistance.\n\n## Detailed Mitigation Strategies\n\n_Protect Against SQL Injection and Other Attacks on Web Services_\nRoutinely evaluate known and published vulnerabilities, perform software updates and\ntechnology refreshes periodically, and audit external-facing systems for known Web application\nvulnerabilities. Take steps to harden both Web applications and the servers hosting them to\nreduce the risk of network intrusion via this vector.[1]\n\n  - Use and configure available firewalls to block attacks.\n\n  - Take steps to further secure Windows systems such as installing and configuring\nMicrosoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and Microsoft AppLocker.\n\n  - Monitor and remove any unauthorized code present in any www directories.\n\n  - Disable, discontinue, or disallow the use of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)\nand Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and response to these protocols as\nmuch as possible.\n\n  - Remove non-required HTTP verbs from Web servers as typical Web servers and\napplications only require GET, POST, and HEAD.\n\n  - Where possible, minimize server fingerprinting by configuring Web servers to avoid\nresponding with banners identifying the server software and version number.\n\n  - Secure both the operating system and the application.\n\n  - Update and patch production servers regularly.\n\n  - Disable potentially harmful SQL-stored procedure calls.\n\n  - Sanitize and validate input to ensure that it is properly typed and does not contain\nescaped code.\n\n  - Consider using type-safe stored procedures and prepared statements.\n\n  - Perform regular audits of transaction logs for suspicious activity.\n\n  - Perform penetration testing against Web services.\n\n  - Ensure error messages are generic and do not expose too much information.\n\n1 [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648653.aspx. Web site last accessed April 11, 2016.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648653.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Phishing and Spearphishing_\n\n  - Implement a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for your organization’s Domain\nName System (DNS) zone file to minimize risks relating to the receipt of spoofed\nmessages.\n\n  - Educate users to be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls, social media interactions, or\nemail messages from individuals asking about employees or other internal information. If\nan unknown individual claims to be from a legitimate organization, try to verify his or her\nidentity directly with the company.\n\n  - Do not provide personal information or information about your organization, including its\nstructure or networks, unless you are certain of a person’s authority to have the\ninformation.\n\n  - Do not reveal personal or financial information in social media or email, and do not\nrespond to solicitations for this information. This includes following links sent in email.\n\n  - Pay attention to the URL of a website. Malicious websites may look identical to a\nlegitimate site, but the URL often includes a variation in spelling or a different domain\nthan the valid website (e.g., .com vs. .net).\n\n  - If you are unsure whether an email request is legitimate, try to verify it by contacting the\ncompany directly. Do not use contact information provided on a website connected to the\nrequest; instead, check previous statements for contact information. Information about\nknown phishing attacks is also available online from groups such as the Anti-Phishing\n[Working Group (http://www.antiphishing.org).](http://www.antiphishing.org/)\n\n  - Take advantage of anti-phishing features offered by your email client and web browser.\n\n  - Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching of software that\nprocesses Internet data, such as web browsers, browser plugins, and document readers.\n\n_Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls_\n\n  - Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user’s duties.\n\n  - Restrict users’ ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications,\nand apply the principle of “Least Privilege” to all systems and services. Restricting these\nprivileges may prevent malware from running or limit its capability to spread through the\nnetwork.\n\n  - Carefully consider the risks before granting administrative rights to users on their own\nmachines.\n\n  - Scrub and verify all administrator accounts regularly.\n\n  - Configure Group Policy to restrict all users to only one login session, where possible.\n\n  - Enforce secure network authentication where possible.\n\n  - Instruct administrators to use non-privileged accounts for standard functions such as Web\nbrowsing or checking Web mail.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Segment networks into logical enclaves and restrict host-to-host communication paths.\nContainment provided by enclaving also makes incident cleanup significantly less costly.\n\n  - Configure firewalls to disallow RDP traffic coming from outside of the network\nboundary, except for in specific configurations such as when tunneled through a\nsecondary VPN with lower privileges.\n\n  - Audit existing firewall rules and close all ports that are not explicitly needed for business.\nSpecifically, carefully consider which ports should be connecting outbound versus\ninbound.\n\n  - Enforce a strict lockout policy for network users and closely monitor logs for failed login\nactivity. This can be indicative of failed intrusion activity.\n\n  - If remote access between zones is an unavoidable business need, log and monitor these\nconnections closely.\n\n  - In environments with a high risk of interception or intrusion, organizations should\nconsider supplementing password authentication with other forms of authentication such\nas challenge/response or multifactor authentication using biometric or physical tokens.\n\n_Credentials_\n\n  - Enforce a tiered administrative model with dedicated administrator workstations and\nseparate administrative accounts that are used exclusively for each tier to prevent tools,\nsuch as Mimikatz, for credential theft from harvesting domain-level credentials.\n\n  - Implement multi-factor authentication (e.g., smart cards) or at minimum ensure users\nchoose complex passwords that change regularly.\n\n  - Be aware that some services (e.g., FTP, telnet, and .rlogin) transmit user credentials in\nclear text. Minimize the use of these services where possible or consider more secure\nalternatives.\n\n  - Properly secure password files by making hashed passwords more difficult to acquire.\nPassword hashes can be cracked within seconds using freely available tools. Consider\nrestricting access to sensitive password hashes by using a shadow password file or\nequivalent on UNIX systems.\n\n  - Replace or modify services so that all user credentials are passed through an encrypted\nchannel.\n\n  - Avoid password policies that reduce the overall strength of credentials. Policies to avoid\ninclude lack of password expiration date, lack of lockout policy, low or disabled\npassword complexity requirements, and password history set to zero.\n\n  - Ensure that users are not re-using passwords between zones by setting policies and\nconducting regular audits.\n\n  - Use unique passwords for local accounts for each device.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Logging Practices_\n\n  - Ensure event logging (applications, events, login activities, security attributes, etc.) is\nturned on or monitored for identification of security issues.\n\n  - Configure network logs to provide enough information to assist in quickly developing an\naccurate determination of a security incident.\n\n  - Upgrade PowerShell to new versions with enhanced logging features and monitor the\nlogs to detect usage of PowerShell commands, which are often malware-related.\n\n  - Secure logs, potentially in a centralized location, and protect them from modification.\n\n  - Prepare an incident response plan that can be rapidly implemented in case of a cyber\nintrusion.\n\n_How to Enhance Your Organization’s Cybersecurity Posture_\nDHS offers a variety of resources for organizations to help recognize and address their\ncybersecurity risks. Resources include discussion points, steps to start evaluating a cybersecurity\nprogram, and a list of hands-on resources available to organizations. For a list of services, visit\n[https://www.us-cert.gov/ccubedvp. Other resources include:](https://www.us-cert.gov/ccubedvp)\n\n  - **The Cyber Security Advisors (CSA) program bolsters cybersecurity preparedness, risk**\nmitigation, and incident response capabilities of critical infrastructure entities and more\nclosely aligns them with the Federal Government. CSAs are DHS personnel assigned to\ndistricts throughout the country and territories, with at least one advisor in each of the 10\nCSA regions, which mirror the Federal Emergency Management Agency regions. For\n[more information, email cyberadvisor@hq.dhs.gov.](mailto:cyberadvisor@hq.dhs.gov)\n\n  - **Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) is a no-cost, voluntary assessment to evaluate and**\nenhance cybersecurity within critical infrastructure sectors, as well as state, local, tribal,\nand territorial governments. The goal of the CRR is to develop an understanding and\nmeasurement of key cybersecurity capabilities to provide meaningful indicators of an\nentity’s operational resilience and ability to manage cyber risk to critical services during\nnormal operations and times of operational stress and crisis.

CSPs then use the cyber threat information to protect CI customers. OIs use the\nthreat information to protect internal networks. For more information, email\n[ECS_Program@hq.dhs.gov.](mailto:ECS_Program@hq.dhs.gov)\n\n  - **The Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Collaboration Program (CISCP) is a**\nvoluntary information-sharing and collaboration program between and among critical\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure partners and the Federal Government. For more information, email\n[CISCP@us-cert.gov.](mailto:CISCP@us-cert.gov)\n\n- **The Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative is a DHS effort to create a system**\nwhere as soon as a company or federal agency observes an attempted compromise, the\nindicator will be shared in real time with all of our partners, protecting them from that\nparticular threat. That means adversaries can only use an attack once, which increases\ntheir costs and ultimately reduces the prevalence of cyber-attacks. While AIS will not\neliminate sophisticated cyber threats, it will allow companies and federal agencies to\nconcentrate more on them by clearing away less sophisticated attacks.\n\nAIS participants connect to a DHS-managed system in the NCCIC that allows\nbidirectional sharing of cyber threat indicators. A server housed at each participant’s\nlocation allows each to exchange indicators with the NCCIC. Participants will not only\nreceive DHS-developed indicators, but can share indicators they have observed in their\nown network defense efforts, which DHS will then share with all AIS participants. For\nmore information, visit [https://www.dhs.gov/ais.](https://www.dhs.gov/ais)\n\n- **The Cybersecurity Framework (Framework), developed by the National Institute of**\nStandards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with the public and private sectors, is\na tool that can improve the cybersecurity readiness of entities. The Framework enables\nentities, regardless of size, degree of cyber risk, or cyber sophistication, to apply\nprinciples and best practices of risk management to improve the security and resiliency of\ncritical infrastructure. The Framework provides standards, guidelines, and practices that\nare working effectively today.
