    "plain_text": "# Conti Group Leaked!\n\n**[cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/conti-group-leaked](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/conti-group-leaked)**\n\nMarch 2, 2022\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has driven significant attention from the cybersecurity community, due\nin large part to the cyber attacks conducted against Ukraine infrastructure — including\n[evidence of destructive malware such as WhisperGate and HermeticWiper.](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/blog/hermeticwiper-what-we-know-about-new-malware-targeting-ukrainian-infrastructure-thus-far)\n\nWe’ve also seen certain ransomware groups gain increased media attention such as the\n[Conti Ransomware Group that is currently in the spotlight because of leaked information](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a)\nabout the inner workings of the group including its common tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs). As cybersecurity researchers, we believe insight gained from these leaks\nis incredibly important to the cybersecurity community at large. Ongoing awareness and\nvisibility into the leaked tools while supporting the need for continued vigilance is critical\nduring this time, and reinforced by groups like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency\n(CISA) that recently issued a [joint cybersecurity bulletin with the FBI.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-057A_Destructive_Malware_Targeting_Organizations_in_Ukraine.pdf)\n\n**What’s in the Leaked Files and Why it Matters**\n\nIn the next section we will elaborate about the leaked content and why it’s important. The\nprimary source is this site: [https://share.vx-underground.org/Conti/](https://share.vx-underground.org/Conti/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1_\n\n## Conti Chat Logs 2020.7z\n\nThis folder contained chats from June of 2020 until November of the same year.\n\nIt seems one user in particular frequently spams all the other users.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2_\n\nThis can also be a useful tool for us to investigate since we can see maybe even all the\nusernames in one place, allowing us to enumerate all the people in the Conti group.\n\n## Conti Internal Software Leak.7z\n\nThis folder contains 12 git repositories of allegedly internal software by Conti.\n\nUpon quick inspection of these repositories, most of the code appears to be open-source\n[software that is used by the Conti group. For instance, yii2 or](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2) [Kohana is used as part of](https://kohanaframework.org/)\n(what seems to be) the admin panel. The code is mostly written in PHP and is managed by\n[Composer, with the exception of one repository of a tool written in Go.](https://getcomposer.org/)\n\nLogs and databases are not present in the dump, so no actual data is available aside from a\npeek into how the backend of the operation may have looked at a certain point. Some of the\ntools are related to older versions, but there’s no indication of whether the dump was from a\nlong time ago or whether Conti just used older versions.\n\nA few of the config files contained in those repositories has local database usernames and\npasswords listed: (e.g., admin-masterdeb4694b0e9110ffcf84a42f70874a6e152c0b32\\\\application\\\\config\\\\database.php):\n```\n.../* developer_1 */  'vb' => [    'default' => [      'type'    =>\n'PostgreSQL',      'connection' => [        'hostname'  =>\n'localhost',        'port'    => '5432',        'username'  =>\n'admin_user',        'password'  => 'aSFbn8asgf67gydsgjkzs',        \n'persistent' => FALSE,        'database'  => 'admin',      \n],      'primary_key' => '',  // Column to return from INSERT queries, see\n#2188 and #2273      'schema'    => '',      'table_prefix' =>\n'',      'charset'   => 'utf8',      'caching'   => FALSE,    \n],...\n\n```\nThere are a few public IP addresses present in some of the torrc config files, iptables script\nfiles or [tinc script files.](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conti Pony Leak 2016.7z\n\nPony leaks 2016 contains a collection of credentials and certificates from multiple sources.\n\nIt looks like a collection that’s been stolen by the Pony credential stealing malware.\n\nIt includes email accounts and passwords from multiple organizations and mail services like\ngmail.com, mail.ru and yahoo.com. Usernames and passwords from FTP/ RDP and SSH\nservices and credentials from different websites.\n\n## Conti Rocket Chat Leaks.7z\n\n“Conti Rocket Chat Leaks” contains a chat history of Conti members in which they discuss\nabout targets and tips to perform attacks via Cobalt Strike.\n\nTechniques from the chat:\n\nActive Directory Enumeration\n\nSQL Databases Enumeration via sqlcmd.\n\nHow to gain access to Shadow Protect SPX (StorageCraft) backups.\n\nHow to create NTDS dumps vs vssadmin\n\nHow to open New RDP Port 1350\n\nList of Tools:\n\nCobalt Strike\n\nMetasploit\n\nPowerView\n\nShareFinder\n\nAnyDesk\n\nMimikatz\n\n## Conti Screenshots December 2021.7z\n\nIn some of the leaked screenshots, we can see the Conti groups’ Cobalt Strike panel in a\nKali Linux distribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3_\n\nThe other screenshots contained another screenshot of the Cobalt-Strike panel and some\nrelated to CONTI.Recovery Chats.\n\n## Conti Toolkit Leak.7z\n\nThe Conti Toolkit Leak zip contains two main Folders.\n\nThe first is called TeamTNTTools which unsurprisingly contains tools used by the APT\nTeamTNT. Specifically, it contains 2 zip files with the NGROK and SugarLogic tools. Both are\ntools that use shell/bash scripts to target various operating systems as well as AWS and\nKubernetes\n\nThe other folder’s name is in Russian and loosely translates to “Manual for Hard Workers\nand Software.” This appear to be an updated version of the content that was leaked by a\ndisgruntled Conti affiliate onto the XSS forum in August of 2021 and contains Conti’s training\nmanual for their partners.\n\n## Conti Trickbot Forum Leak.7z\n\nOne of the leaked files is a dump of forum chats from the Trickbot forums, including\ncorrespondences in the forum from 2019 until 2021.\n\nWhile most of the correspondences contain instructions for operators about how to laterally\nmove across networks and how to use certain tools used by the Trickbot gang/group, we did\nfind some interesting bits.\n\nFrom the different correspondences and toolset dumps we can learn a lot about the Trickbot\nand Conti gang’s TTPs. For instance in one of the correspondences a member shares his\nweb shell of choice, “the lightest and most durable webshell I use”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4_\n\nWe also found some evidence from early July 2021 that the group used exploits such as\nZeroLogon.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5_\n\nAs well as techniques such as Kerberoasting to carry out their attacks.\n\n_Figure 6_\n\nOn a different post, the group shares some code to dump MSSQL credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7_\n\nOn a different post from February 2021, a user in the forum shares his code for a PowerShell\nscript to install a backdoor on a victim’s machine, including installing Tor, SSH and setting up\na firewall rule as well as a new user account on the victim’s machine called\n“oldadministrator.”\n\n_Figure 8_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9_\n\nAlso, in a post they are sharing techniques to stop “everything” (short version for brevity\nreasons), in order to have all applications/DBs closed before encrypting/locking a server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10_\n\n## Conti Trickbot Leaks.7z\n\nThere were more leaks of two Trickbot server-side components written in Erlang\n\nsupposedly by “Sergey Loguntsov” https://github.com/loguntsov aka Begemot.\n\nThe two components are trickbot-command-dispatcher-backend and trickbot-data-collector\nbackend dubbed lero and dero.\n\n## Conti Source Code Leak\n\nAdditionally, the Conti Locker source code was leaked, first as a password protected zip file\nbut later it was leaked again — this time without any password.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe zip contents include Conti Locker v2 source code as well as the source code for the\ndecryptor.\n\n## Training Material Leak\n\nAn older leak that also contained some older training materials of the Conti group contained\n12 archive files with different topics, such as:\n\nCracking\nMetasploit\nNetwork Pentesting\nCoblat Strike\nPowerShell for Pentesters\nWindows Red Teaming\nWMI Attacks (and Defenses)\nSQL Server\nActive Directory\nReverse Engineering\n\n_Figure 11_\n\nSome of the archives contain videos of online courses in Russian.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12_\n\n## Summary\n\nTo improve defenders’ ability to protect against the next wave of targeted attacks and\ndestructive malware, information sharing, and deeper analysis and insight into the use of\nparticular TTPs is critical. In many ways, we believe what we are seeing today could\npotentially be the tip of the iceberg, which is why we can’t let up on our efforts to support\nongoing awareness and hyper cybersecurity vigilance.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nConti taking over TrickBot operation\n\nhttps://www.scmagazine.com/brief/ransomware/trickbot-operation-usurped-by-contiransomware\n\nBleeping Computer article about the original Conti leak\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomwares-internal-chats-leakedafter-siding-with-russia/\n\nTwitter account leaking Conti information\n\n[https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks](https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks)\n\n\n-----",
