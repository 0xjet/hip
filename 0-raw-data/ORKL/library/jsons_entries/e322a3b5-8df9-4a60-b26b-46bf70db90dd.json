    "plain_text": "# Google's unusual move to shut down an active counterterrorism operation being conducted by a Western democracy\n\n**[technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021318/google-security-shut-down-counter-terrorist-us-ally](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021318/google-security-shut-down-counter-terrorist-us-ally/)**\n\nGoogle’s security teams publicly exposed a nine-month hacking operation\nWhat wasn’t disclosed: The move shut down an active counter-terrorist operation being\nconducted by a Western government\nThe decision has raised alarms inside Google and elsewhere\n\nGoogle runs some of the most venerated cybersecurity operations on the planet: its Project\nZero team, for example, finds powerful undiscovered security vulnerabilities, while its Threat\nAnalysis Group directly counters hacking backed by governments, including North Korea,\nChina, and Russia. And those two teams caught an unexpectedly big fish recently: an “expert”\nhacking group exploiting 11 powerful vulnerabilities to compromise devices running iOS,\nAndroid, and Windows.\n\nBut MIT Technology Review has learned that the hackers in question were actually Western\ngovernment operatives actively conducting a counterterrorism operation. The company’s\ndecision to stop and publicize the attack caused internal division at Google and raised\nquestions inside the intelligence communities of the United States and its allies.\n\n\n-----\n\n[A pair of recent Google blog posts detail the collection of zero-day vulnerabilities that it](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/03/in-wild-series-october-2020-0-day.html)\ndiscovered hackers using over the course of nine months. The exploits, whichwent back to\nearly 2020 and used never-before-seen techniques, were “watering hole” attacks that used\ninfected websites to deliver malware to visitors. They caught the attention of cybersecurity\nexperts thanks to their scale, sophistication, and speed.\n\nGoogle’s announcement glaringly omitted key details, however, including who was\nresponsible for the hacking and who was being targeted, as well as important technical\ninformation on the malware or the domains used in the operation. At least some of that\ninformation would typically be made public in some way, leading one security expert to\n[criticize the report as a “dark hole.”](https://securityconversations.com/dark-holes-and-apex-threat-actors/)\n\n## “Different ethical questions”\n\nSecurity companies regularly shut down exploits that are being used by friendly\ngovernments, but such actions are rarely made public. In response to this incident, some\nGoogle employees have argued that counterterrorism missions ought to be out of bounds of\npublic disclosure; others believe the company was entirely within its rights, and that the\nannouncement serves to protect users and make the internet more secure.\n\n“Project Zero is dedicated to finding and patching 0-day vulnerabilities, and posting technical\nresearch designed to advance the understanding of novel security vulnerabilities and\nexploitation techniques across the research community,” a Google spokesperson said in a\nstatement. “We believe sharing this research leads to better defensive strategies and\nincreases security for everyone. We don’t perform attribution as part of this research.”\n\nIt’s true that Project Zero does not formally attribute hacking to specific groups. But the\nThreat Analysis Group, which also worked on the project, does perform attribution. Google\nomitted many more details than just the name of the government behind the hacks, and\nthrough that information, the teams knew internally who the hacker and targets were. It is\nnot clear whether Google gave advance notice to government officials that they would be\npublicizing and shutting down the method of attack.\n\nBut Western operations are recognizable, according to one former senior US intelligence\nofficial.\n\n“There are certain hallmarks in Western operations that are not present in other entities …\nyou can see it translate down into the code,” said the former official, who is not authorized to\ncomment on operations and spoke on condition of anonymity. “And this is where I think one\nof the key ethical dimensions comes in. How one treats intelligence activity or law\nenforcement activity driven under democratic oversight within a lawfully elected\nrepresentative government is very different from that of an authoritarian regime.”\n\n“The oversight is baked into Western operations at the technical, tradecraft, and procedure\nlevel ” they added\n\n\n-----\n\n“There are certain hallmarks in Western operations that are not present in other entities …\nyou can see it translate down into the code.”\n\nGoogle found the hacking group exploiting 11 zero-day vulnerabilities in just nine months, a\nhigh number of exploits over a short period. Software that was attacked included the Safari\nbrowser on iPhones but also many Google products, including the Chrome browser on\nAndroid phones and Windows computers.\n\nBut the conclusion within Google was that who was hacking and why is never as important as\nthe security flaws themselves. Earlier this year, Project Zero’s Maddie Stone argued that it is\ntoo easy for hackers to find and use powerful zero-day vulnerabilities and that her team faces\nan uphill battle detecting their use.\n\nInstead of focusing on who was behind and targeted by a specific operation, Google decided\nto take broader action for everyone. The justification was that even if a Western government\nwas the one exploiting those vulnerabilities today, it will eventually be used by others, and so\nthe right choice is always to fix the flaw today.\n\n## “It’s not their job to figure out”\n\nThis is far from the first time a Western cybersecurity team has caught hackers from allied\ncountries. Some companies, however, have a quiet policy of not publicly exposing such\nhacking operations if both the security team and the hackers are considered friendly—for\nexample, if they are members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance, which is made up of the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Several members\nof Google’s security teams are veterans of Western intelligence agencies, and some have\nconducted hacking campaigns for these governments.\n\nIn [some cases, security companies will clean up so-called “friendly” malware but avoid going](https://www.cyberscoop.com/kevin-mandia-fireeye-u-s-malware-nice/)\npublic with it.\n\n“They typically don’t attribute US-based operations,” says Sasha Romanosky, a former\n[Pentagon official who published recent research into private-sector cybersecurity](https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP68257.html)\ninvestigations. “They told us they specifically step away. It’s not their job to figure out; they\npolitely move aside. That’s not unexpected.”\n\nWhile the Google situation is in some ways unusual, there have been somewhat similar cases\n[in the past. The Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky came under fire in 2018 when it](https://www.cyberscoop.com/kaspersky-slingshot-isis-operation-socom-five-eyes/)\nexposed an American-led counterterrorism cyber operation against ISIS and Al Qaeda\nmembers in the Middle East. Kaspersky, like Google, did not explicitly attribute the threat\n\n\n-----\n\nbut nevertheless exposed it and rendered it useless, American officials said, which caused the\noperatives to lose access to a valuable surveillance program and even put the lives of soldiers\non the ground at risk.\n\nKaspersky was already under heavy criticism for its relationship with the Russian\n[government at the time, and the company was ultimately banned from US government](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-formalizes-kaspersky-ban-11568194206#:~:text=Rule%20barring%20federal%20agencies%2C%20contractors,company's%20products%20goes%20into%20effect&text=Washington%20has%20formally%20barred%20federal,Russian%20cybersecurity%20company%20Kaspersky%20Lab.)\nsystems. It has always denied having any special relationship with the Kremlin.\n\n[Google has found itself in similar water before, too. In 2019, the company released research](https://medium.com/chronicle-blog/who-is-gossipgirl-3b4170f846c0)\non what may have been an American hacking group, although specific attribution was never\nmade. But that research was about a historical operation. Google’s recent announcements,\nhowever, put the spotlight on what had been a live cyber-espionage operation.\n\n## Who’s being protected?\n\nThe alarms raised both inside government and at Google show the company is in a difficult\nposition.\n\nGoogle security teams have a responsibility to the company’s customers, and it is widely\nexpected that they will do their utmost to protect the products—and therefore users—who are\nunder attack. In this incident, it’s notable that the techniques used affected not just Google\nproducts like Chrome and Android, but also iPhones.\n\nWhile different teams draw their own lines, Project Zero has made its name by tackling\ncritical vulnerabilities all over the internet, not just those found in Google’s products.\n\nBut while protecting customers from attack is important, some argue that\ncounterterrorism operations are different, with potentially life-and-death consequences\nthat go beyond day-to-day internet security.\n\nWhen state-backed hackers in Western nations find cybersecurity flaws, there are established\nmethods for working out the potential costs and benefits of disclosing the security gap to the\ncompany that is affected. In the United States it’s called the “vulnerabilities equities process.”\nCritics worry that US intelligence hoards large numbers of exploits, but the American system\nis more formal, transparent, and expansive than what’s done in almost every other country\non earth, including Western allies. The process is meant to allow government officials to\nbalance the advantages of keeping flaws secret in order to use them for intelligence purposes\nwith the wider benefits of telling a tech company about a weakness in order to have it fixed.\n\n“The level of oversight even in Western democracies about what their national security\nagencies are actually doing is, in many cases, a lot less than we have in the United States.”\n\n\n-----\n\nLast year the NSA made the unusual move to take credit for revealing an old flaw in\nMicrosoft Windows. That kind of report from government to industry is normally kept\nanonymous and often secret.\n\nBut even though the American intelligence system’s disclosure process can be opaque,\nsimilar processes in other Western nations are often smaller, more secretive, or simply\ninformal and therefore easy to bypass.\n\n“The level of oversight even in Western democracies about what their national security\nagencies are actually doing is, in many cases, a lot less than we have in the United States,”\nsays Michael Daniel, who was White House cybersecurity coordinator for the Obama\nadministration.\n\n“The degree of parliamentary oversight is much less. These countries do not have the robust\ninter-agency processes the US has. I’m not normally one to brag about the US—we’ve got a\nlot of problems—but this is one area where we have robust processes that other Western\ndemocracies just don’t.”\n\nThe fact that the hacking group hit by the Google investigation possessed and used so many\nzero-day vulnerabilities so rapidly could indicate a problematic imbalance. But some\nobservers worry about live counterterrorism cyberoperations being shut down at potentially\ndecisive moments without the ability to quickly start up again.\n\n“US allies don’t all have the ability to regenerate entire operations as quickly as some other\nplayers,” the former senior US intelligence official said. Worries about suddenly losing access\nto an exploit capability or being spotted by a target are particularly high for counterterrorism\nmissions, especially during “periods of incredible exposure” when a lot of exploitation is\ntaking place, the official explained. Google’s ability to shut down such an operation is likely to\nbe the source of more conflict.\n\n“This is still something that hasn’t been well addressed,” the official said. “The idea that\nsomeone like Google can destroy that much capability that quickly is slowly dawning on\nfolks.”\n\n\n-----",
