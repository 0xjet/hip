One of these networks originated in China and the other in**\n**the Philippines.**\n\nIn each case, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake\naccounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what\nthey are doing, and that was the basis for our action. When we investigate and remove these\noperations, we focus on behavior rather than content, no matter who’s behind them, what\nthey post, or whether they’re foreign or domestic.\n\nOver the past three years, we’ve shared our findings about coordinated inauthentic behavior\nwe detect and remove from our platforms. Earlier this year, we started publishing regular CIB\nreports where we share information about the networks we take down over the course of\neach month to make it easier for people to see progress we’re making in one place. In some\n\n\n-----\n\ncases, like today, we also share our findings soon after our enforcement. The takedowns we\nare announcing today will also be included in our September report. You can find more\n[information about our previous CIB enforcement actions here.](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\n\nWe are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing\neffort. We’re committed to continually improving to stay ahead.\n\n**WHAT WE FOUND**\n_(We will update the numbers as soon as the latest data becomes available)_\n\n**We removed 155 accounts, 11 Pages, 9 Groups and 6 Instagram accounts for violating**\n**our policy against** **[foreign or government interference which is](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/inauthentic-behavior-policy-update/)** **coordinated**\n**inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign or government entity. This activity**\n**originated in China and focused primarily on the Philippines and Southeast Asia more**\n**broadly, and also on the United States.**\n\nWe identified several clusters of connected activity that relied on fake accounts to pose as\nlocals in countries they targeted, post in Groups, amplify their own content, manage Pages,\nlike and comment on other people’s posts particularly about naval activity in the South China\nSea, including US Navy ships. This campaign took operational security steps to conceal their\nidentity and location including through the use of VPNs. Some of this network’s Pages were\npreviously removed for violating our inauthentic behavior and spam policies.\n\nIn Southeast Asia where this network focused most of its activity, they posted in Chinese,\nFilipino and English about global news and current events including Beijing’s interests in the\nSouth China Sea; Hong Kong; content supportive of President Rodrigo Duterte and Sarah\nDuterte’s potential run in the 2022 Presidential election; criticism of Rappler, an independent\nnews organization in the Philippines; issues relevant to the overseas Filipino workers; and\npraise and some criticism of China. In the US, where this network focused the least and\ngained almost no following, they posted content both in support of and against presidential\ncandidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWe found this network as part of our internal investigation into suspected coordinated\ninauthentic behavior in the region. Although the people behind this activity attempted to\nconceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals in the\nFujian province of China.\n\n_Presence on Facebook and Instagram: 155 Facebook accounts, 11 Pages, 9 Groups_\nand 6 Instagram accounts\n_Followers: About 133,000 accounts followed one or more of these Pages, around_\n59,000 people joined one or more of these Groups, and about 150 accounts followed\none or more of these Instagram accounts. (Updated on October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM\n**_PT to reflect the latest numbers.)_**\n_Advertising: About $60 in spending for ads on Facebook paid for in Chinese yuan._\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a sample of the content posted by some of these Pages and accounts:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nTranslation: “There is no use for emergency powers. We will oppose it in the Senate.”\n\n– Sen. Franklin Drilon\n\nWhere is your shame Drilon? Right now you are a nuisance you did nothing but harass and\ntalk nonsense things.\n\nYou did nothing but oppose!\n\nYou don’t think anything but personal interest only..\n\n\n-----\n\n**We also removed 64 Facebook accounts, 32 Pages and 33 Instagram accounts for**\n**violating our policy against foreign or** **[government interference which is](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/inauthentic-behavior-policy-update/)** **coordinated**\n**inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign or government entity. This network**\n**originated in in the Philippines and focused on domestic audiences. (Updated on**\n**_October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM PT to reflect the latest enforcement numbers.)_**\n\nThis network consisted of several clusters of connected activity that relied on fake accounts\nto evade enforcement, post content, comment and manage Pages. This operation appeared\nto have accelerated between 2019 and 2020. They posted in Filipino and English about local\nnews and events including domestic politics, military activities against terrorism, pending\nanti-terrorism bill, criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition, the Communist\nParty of the Philippines and its military wing the New People’s Army, and the National\nDemocratic Front of the Philippines.\n\nWe found the full scope of this activity after investigating information about a portion of this\nnetwork brought to our attention by civil society in the Philippines and Rappler, an\nindependent news organization in the Philippines. Although the people behind this activity\nattempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to Philippine military and\nPhilippine police.\n\n_Presence_ _on Facebook and Instagram: 64 Facebook accounts, 32 Pages and 33_\nInstagram accounts (Updated on October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM PT to reflect the\n**_latest enforcement numbers.)_**\n_Followers: About 209,000 accounts followed one or more of these Pages and about_\n5,500 people followed one of more of these Instagram accounts. (Updated on\n**_October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM PT to reflect the latest numbers.)_**\n_Advertising: Around $1,300 in spending for ads on Facebook paid for in Philippine_\npeso. (Updated on October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM PT to reflect the latest numbers.)\n\nBelow is a sample of the content posted by some of these Pages and accounts:\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation: caption: Joining\n\nany organizations of the terrorist CPP-NPA-NDF is suicide because it is like slowly\napproaching your death. Which is why my fellow country men, be smart and do not be\ndeceived by the terrorist CPP-NPA-NDF, because they take delight in Filipino citizens joining\ntheir cause. Please share! Text overlay: Joining any organizations of CPP-NPA-NDF is like\nsuicide because you are slowly approaching your own death. Stairway to death\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation:\nLet’s all unite to defeat the terrorists that are an obstacle to the freedom of our fellow\ncountrymen which they’ve poisoned with their beliefs!\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation:\n\nBe cautious of progressive groups such as these…\n\nThey use these schools as recruitment basins of CPP NPA in Central Luzon\n\n#ThoseWhoKnowAreSafe\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation: Aktibista\n\n\nnoon = An activist in the past Virus ngayon = Now a virus\n\n\n-----",
