Foxconn subsidiaries\ninclude Sharp Corporation, Innolux, FIH Mobile, and Belkin.\n\nBleepingComputer has been tracking a rumored Foxconn ransomware attack that occurred\nover the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nToday, the DoppelPaymer ransomware published files belonging to Foxconn NA on their\nransomware data leak site. The leaked data includes generic business documents and\nreports but does not contain any financial information or employee's personal details.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DoppelPaymer ransomware data leak site**\nSources in the cybersecurity industry have confirmed that Foxconn suffered an attack\naround November 29th, 2020, at their Foxconn CTBG MX facility located in Ciudad Juárez,\nMexico.\n\nThis facility opened in 2005 and is used by Foxconn for assembly and shipping of\nelectronics equipment to all regions in South and North America.\n\n\"Our 682,000 square ft building was established back in 2005, and is located in Ciudad\nJuárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. [..] Foxconn CTBG\nMX is strategically located to support all Americas region,\" the Foxconn CTBG MX web\npage describes the facility.\n\nSince the attack, the facility's web site has been down and currently shows an error to\nvisitors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Foxconn CTBG MX facility website**\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n## Attackers demand $34 million ransom\n\nSources have also shared the ransom note created on Foxconn servers during the\nransomware attack, as can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Foxconn ransom note**\nIncluded in the ransom note is a link to Foxconn's victim page on DoppelPaymer's Tor\npayment site where the threat actors are demanding a 1804.0955 BTC ransom, or\napproximately $34,686,000 at today's bitcoin prices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Foxconn victim page on DoppelPaymer's website**\nIn an interview with DoppelPaymer, the ransomware gang confirmed that they attacked\nFoxconn's North America facility on November 29th but did not attack the whole company.\n\nAs part of this attack, the threat actors claim to have encrypted about 1,200 servers, stole\n100 GB of unencrypted files, and deleted 20-30 TB Of backups.\n\n\"We encrypted NA segment, not whole foxconn, it's about 1200-1400 servers, and not\nfocused on workstations. They also had about 75TB's of misc backups, what we were able\nto - we destroyed (approx 20-30TB),\" DoppelPayment told us about the attack.\n\nIn a statement to BleepingComputer, Foxconn confirmed the attack and said they are slowly\nbringing their systems back into service.\n\n\"We can confirm that an information system in the US that supports some of our operations\nin the Americas was the focus of a cybersecurity attack on November 29. We are working\nwith technical experts and law enforcement agencies to carry out an investigation to\n\n\n-----\n\ndetermine the full impact of this illegal action and to identify those responsible and bring\nthem to justice.\"\n\n\"The system that was affected by this incident is being thoroughly inspected and being\nbrought back into service in phases,\" Foxconn told BleepingComputer.\n\n[Other victims attacked by DoppelPaymer in the past include Compal,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/laptop-maker-compal-hit-by-ransomware-17-million-demanded/) PEMEX (Petróleos\nMexicanos), the [City of Torrance in California, Newcastle University,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-los-angeles-county-city-leaks-files/) Hall County in\n[Georgia, Banijay Group SAS, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/masterchef-big-brother-producer-hit-by-doppelpaymer-ransomware/) [Bretagne Télécom.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-hacked-bretagne-t-l-com-using-the-citrix-adc-flaw/)\n\n_Update 12/8/20: Added statement from Foxconn._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[DoppelPaymer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/doppelpaymer/)\n[Foxconn](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/foxconn/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
