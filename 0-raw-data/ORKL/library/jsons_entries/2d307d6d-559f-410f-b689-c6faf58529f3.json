Toddler is considered to be an important example of this trend in\nterms of it’s technical features and operational chain.\n\n**Why does it matter?**\n\nStealing banking credentials of end users have become the most prominent\nmethod for cyber-fraud. These high-end mobile banking botnets enable attackers to\nbypass additional layers of security such as OTP and 2nd Factor authentication while\npresenting new opportunities for social engineering attacks. Therefore, these trends\nare expected to result in high amounts of fraud losses for both banking institutions\nand end-users if fraud mechanisms are not put in place accordingly.\n\n**What should be done?**\n\nInner mechanics of Toddler malware should be analyzed by security operation teams\nand fraud divisions of finance institutions for the purpose of implementing multiple\nlayers of security to prevent pre- and post-infection phases. Detection and takedown\nof malicious URLs (e.g. U.S.T.A) in a timely manner and running anti-malware SDKs (e.g.\nSKALA) on end-user devices already showed some progress to quickly repel these\ntype of cyber attacks. However, most of the financial organizations are still unaware\nof the problem as mobile malware is spreading at a fast pace than ever before.\n\n\n3 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data.

Teabot, Anatsa, ...). At the time of the analysis, Toddler\nis largely targeting Spain, but the malware sample contains textual content for\ntargeting Spanish, English, Italian, German, French, and Dutch-speaking users. The PTI\nteam has identified the following Android application names used by the Toddler\ncampaign : “BPOST”, “UPS”, and “Correos”, The PTI team has de-anonymized the C&C\nserver and discovered that Toddler has already infected more than 7,632 devices and\nstolen over 1023 banking credentials at the time of writing this report. Statistics and\nobservations from the main C&C panel are also provided in detail. Toddler has all of\nthe generic banking malware features such as overlay attack and SMS stealing for\nOTP, but the key differences are that it :\n\n## • [prevents device reboot by closing the reboot UI (and prevents boot into safe]\nmode);\n\n## • [is very persistent and has multiple removal prevention mechanisms, making it]\nalmost impossible to be removed by end users;\n\n## • [uses multiple hacked legitimate websites for hosting the malicious APK file.]\n\n\n4 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information in an “as is”\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n\n#### 1.1 Overview\n\nThis report is based on findings obtained from the analysis of Toddler malware operation,\nconducted by different cyber-crime groups for the purpose of stealing banking credentials\nand personally identifiable information (”PII”) of end-users.\n\nFollowing its detailed research on both malware sample and command and control server\nof Toddler cybercrime operation, PTI team was able to discover numerous important details\nwhich indicate an ongoing trend against banking customers in E.U. states. PTI has reached\nthis conclusion due to the fact that; (1) ”Toddler” malware was pre-configured to act against\nmobile applications of multiple EU-based banking institutions and (2) most of the infected\nvictims were detected to be users of these EU-based banks (with a meaningful concentration\non Spain and Switzerland based organizations).\n\n#### 1.2 Working Mechanism\n\nOur analysis on Toddler malware sample has further revealed that Toddler uses overlay\nattacks to perform ”webview-based application phishing”. The malware mainly targets\nmobile banking and cryptocurrency applications but also gathers a wide range of user\ndata from all installed applications on the victim’s device.\n\n**Analyst Note : ”Webview-based application phishing” is the most common method used**\nby banking malware applications. This technique is based on bringing a fake login screen\nin front of an actual mobile banking application in order to trick the end-user to fill in\ntheir credentials. Unfortunately; it is visually not possible for an end-user to notice these\n”overlay” attacks, as their timing and design is virtually indistinguishable.\n\nUpon installation, Toddler malware instantly starts tracking applications being launched on\nthe device. Once it detects a target application launch (e.g. when the end-user clicks on\nhis/her mobile banking application on the device), the malware starts an overlay attack.\nToddler downloads the specially crafted login page for the opened target application\nfrom its C&C server. The downloaded webview phishing page is then laid over the target\napplication. The user suspects nothing because this event happens almost instantaneously\nwhen the legitimate application is opened. Once the application credentials are entered\ninto the overlayed phishing page, Toddler malware sends these credentials to the C&C\nserver controlled by the attacker.\n\nAs also discussed in the latter sections of this report; Toddler banking malware operation is\ncapable of;\n\n## • [Remotely controlling the victims device and simulating inseparable user behavior;]\n • [Reading SMS messages and send these messages to Command and Control server of]\nthe operation in order to bypass SMS OTP precautions,\n\n5 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information in an “as is”\n\n\n-----\n\n## • [Acquiring multiple accessibility authorities (which are originally intended for users with]\ndisabilities) and use these for approving different notifications automatically on behalf\nof the user and,\n\n## • [Applying multiple high-end techniques that make it virtually impossible to be deleted]\nby an end-user.\n\n**Figure 1. Overlay attacks on various banking applications**\n\n#### 1.3 Current Impact and Future Forecasts\n\nStarting from the mid 2020; PTI has been working on different mobile banking botnets\ntargeting EU member states (for reference, please see our reports on FluBot and BrunHilda).\nToddler has been found to be another important example of this trend with multiple\ninteresting features.\n\nDuring PTI’s analysis on Toddler’s Command and Control servers; a total of 7632 devices\nhave been detected to be infected. As a result of these infections; 1023 banking credentials\nwere detected to be stolen. Even though Toddler is pre-configured to act against dozens\nof different banking institutions; our team has witnessed that 100 percent of infected\nend-users were customers of 18 financial institutions. Among these 18 banking institutions; 5\norganizations were witnessed to be the main targets with nearly 90 percent of all infections\n(remaining 10 percent were shared among the remaining 13 different banks). This is thought to\nbe resulting from a partially targeted SMS-Phishing campaign, aimed at specific user groups.\n\nSimilar to Flubot, which had been initially discovered to be primarily targeting Spain but\nthen detected to be used very effectively in multiple different EU member states; Toddler is\nforecasted to be another notorious mobile banking malware with a potential of creating\nfundamental fraud losses for both banking organizations and customers in short-to-medium\nfuture.\n\n6 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data.

After performing deep enumeration on the\ntarget host, the PTI team was able to detect the C&C login page at the path\n**http://185.215.113.31/kioglsehnoiergnsoeigniseogosegnr/. At this point, the PTI team started**\nscanning the entire global IPv4 range for a React application login page with the same path\nfor detecting another Toddler C&C server. Scan results revealed a host that could potentially\nbe another Toddler C&C server at 188.116.27.100.\n\n**Figure 15. Command and Control Panel Login Page**\n\nWith the help of the data gathered in the deep enumeration phase, the PTI team was able to\ndeanonymize and analyze the contents of the C&C panel of the Toddler servers. The botnet\npanel is a React application with a REST API exposed on address http://185.215.113.31:82/api/\nthat enables the Toddler malware to interact.\n\n15 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data.

Victims Android Version Statistics**\n\n### 3 Conclusion\n\nThe number of mobile banking malware types has been increasing at an alarming rate\nover the past five years. The PTI team has investigated multiple mobile botnets during\n2021 that are significantly advanced over their predecessors in terms of rapid spreading,\nobfuscation, and domain generation capabilities. One of the most recent examples of mobile\nmalware, dubbed ”FluBot” by the PTI team, shows similar characteristics with the Toddler\nmalware. We can immediately observe ”Spain” as the target country in both cases. It should\nalso be noted that in both cases, cybercriminals used the same company names to disguise\ntheir malware. Apart from their similarities, Toddler sets a new precedent for persistence\nmodule implementation. Removal of the malware from the device requires huge technical\nexpertise and it looks like the process will not get easier in the future. Within a very short\ntime frame, Toddler was able to infect more than 7,632 mobile phones.
