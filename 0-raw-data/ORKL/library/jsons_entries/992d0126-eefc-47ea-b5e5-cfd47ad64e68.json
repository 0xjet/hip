The losses created this way are\nestimated to tens of millions of dollars.\n\n## Direct access to the local network\n\nDubbed DarkVishnya, the attacks targeted at least eight banks using readily-available gear\n[such as netbooks or inexpensive laptops, Raspberry Pi mini-computers, or a](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) [Bash Bunny -](https://shop.hak5.org/products/bash-bunny)\na USB-sized piece hardware for penetration testing purposes that can pose as a keyboard,\nflash storage, network adapter, or as any serial device.\n\nThey gained access to the local network from various places inside the victim's central or\nregional offices, and even from company branches in a different country.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven their position, the devices could launch attacks that bypassed network defenses and\ncould easily run reconnaissance routines, which are the first step of a cyber attack once on\nthe target infrastructure.\n\nSergey Golovanov from Kaspersky Lab says that the researchers discovered this attack\nmethod between 2017 and 2018 while investigating cybertheft incidents.\n\n\"Inside the local network, the device appeared as an unknown computer, an external flash\n[drive, or even a keyboard,\" he details.](http://securelist.com/darkvishnya/89169/)\n\nTo control the rogue gear remotely, the attackers used a built-in or USB-powered\nGPRS/3G/LTE wireless modules.\n\nIn the second stage of the attack, the intruders scanned the digital premises in search of\nopen resources such as shared folders and web servers with public access.\n\nThe goal was to identify and collect valuable information like login credentials for systems\nused for making payments. To this end, the threat actor tried to brute-force their way in or\nintercept traffic to extract login data.\n\nEvading firewall restrictions was possible through reverse TCP shells and the use of a\ndifferent payload to create the communication tunnel. If all went well, the adversary would\nlog into the target system and gain persistence.\n\nGolovanov says that the threat actor launched on the compromised system malicious\nservices created with the MSFvenom tool from the Metasploit Framework.\n\n## Fileless attacks are difficult to spot\n\nThe success of these operations is owed to the fact that they did not rely on specific\nmalware to achieve their goals but relied on tools like PowerShell that could bypass\nwhitelisting technologies and domain policies in most cases.\n\nAlthough widely abused by cybercriminals to run malicious scripts, PowerShell is a\nlegitimate component that is typically available on target machines.\n\nSome system administrators block PowerShell on network machines to minimize the attack\nsurface. If this was the case, the DarkVishnya attacks would use the Impacket Python\nlibrary, winexesvc.exe or psexec.exe for remote execution of processes.\n\nAll three are legitimate tools used by admin to run commands on remote machines and\nredirect the output on the local system. PsExec has been used maliciously since at least\n[2004 and it was used by NotPetya ransomware for lateral movement.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/petya-ransomware-outbreak-originated-in-ukraine-via-tainted-accounting-software/)\n\n## Crims take a page from pentesters' book\n\n\n-----\n\nThis method of compromise is not new. It has been used in attacks against banks as early\n[as 2013, when a gang stole over £1.3 million from Barclays Bank by connecting a keyboard](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-24172305)\nvideo mouse (KVM) switch with a 3G router to a computer in the bank.\n\nPenetration testers also use this method to breach defenses of a target with strong\nprotections against outside access. Bash Bunny, for example, is specially built for this\npurpose as its form factor resembles a flash drive and once connected to a computer it can\nrun scripts that give access to assets on the network.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[GitHub: Attackers stole login details of 100K npm user accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-attackers-stole-login-details-of-100k-npm-user-accounts/)\n\n[National bank hit by ransomware trolls hackers with dick pics](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/national-bank-hit-by-ransomware-trolls-hackers-with-dick-pics/)\n\n[Heroku admits that customer credentials were stolen in cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/heroku-admits-that-customer-credentials-were-stolen-in-cyberattack/)\n\n[A YouTuber is encouraging you to DDoS Russia—how risky is this?](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-youtuber-is-encouraging-you-to-ddos-russia-how-risky-is-this/)\n\n[Austin Peay State University resumes after ransomware cyber attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/austin-peay-state-university-resumes-after-ransomware-cyber-attack/)\n\n[Bank](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bank/)\n[Breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/breach/)\n[Cyber Attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-attack/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
