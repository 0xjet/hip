Panda, first discovered in early 2016 by Fox IT and later analyzed by\nProofpoint, 1 spreads through phishing attacks and targets Windows operating systems (OS).\nIts main attack techniques include web injects, screen shots of user activity (up to 100 per\nmouse click), logging of keyboard input, Clipboard pastes (to grab passwords and paste\nthem into form fields), and exploits to the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) desktop sharing\nsystem. All of these attack methods are supported by ATSEngine,2 [which Ramnit, another](https://f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/malware/ramnit-goes-on-a-holiday-shopping-spree-targeting-retailers-and-banks)\nprolific banking trojan, also used in its 2017 holiday campaign.\n\n\nPanda is primarily focused on financial services organizations, but it is expanding its\nindustry targets with each new campaign.\nPanda was heavily focused on cryptocurrency sites in February.\nPanda is currently targeting Facebook and Twitter in all three campaigns active in May.\nThere are different C&Cs for each campaign, three of which are connected through a\nknown threat actor network in Russia, the fourth is hosted in China.\n\nWe analyzed four campaigns that were active between February and May of 2018. The three\nMay campaigns are still active at the time of this writing. Two of the four campaigns are\nacting from the same botnet version but have different targets and different command and\n\n\n-----\n\ncontrol (C&C) servers.\n\nPanda is still primarily focused on targeting global financial services, but following the\nworldwide cryptocurrency hype, it has expanded its targets to online cryptocurrency\nexchanges and brokerage services. Social media, search, email, and adult sites are also\nbeing targeted by Panda.\n\nFigure 1: Panda campaign targets by industry\n\n_Figure 1: Panda campaign targets by industry_\n\nThe campaigns that targeted Italian, US, and Canadian financial organizations were the\nsame ones that targeted cryptocurrency sites. The campaign that focused on Japanese\nfinancial organizations had the broadest set of industry targets. Across all campaigns in May,\nthe same social media, search, email, ecommerce, and tech providers were targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Panda industry targets by campaign\n\n_Figure 2: Panda industry targets by campaign_\n\nAdult sites were also targeted by Panda in May. We have been seeing an expansion of\nbanking trojan targets into other industries that collect payment information and other forms\nof personally identifiable information (PII), so this behavior is not surprising given the size of\nthe adult industry and potential revenue generation for fraudsters.\n\n## February Campaign - Botnet “Onore2” Targets Italian Financial Services and Cryptocurrency Sites Equally\n\nThe Panda configuration we analyzed from February was marked as botnet “onore2.” This\ncampaign leverage the same attack techniques as previously described, and it is able to\nkeylog popular web browsers and VNC in order to hijack user interaction session and steal\npersonal information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Italian campaign, botnet Onore2 dynamic configuration\n\n_Figure 3: Italian campaign, botnet Onore2 dynamic configuration_\n\nThe Onore2 campaign targeted two industries: financial services and cryptocurrency sites.\nThe majority of the targets were financial services sites in Italy at 51%, followed closely by\ncryptocurrency targets used worldwide at 49%.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: The February Panda Onore2 campaign targeted Italian financial services and\ncryptocurrency sites\n\n_Figure 4: The February Panda Onore2 campaign targeted Italian financial services and_\n_cryptocurrency sites_\n\nThe cryptocurrency sites Panda focused on in February were primarily targeted through\nscreenshots versus the typical web inject. We assume this was to document and spy on user\ninteraction at cryptocurrency accounts, side by side to the web injection list. The list of\ncryptocurrency sites targeted includes but is not limited to:\n\nAnycoindirect.eu\nBtcc.com\nBitstamp.net\nBethumb.com\nBitpanda\nBitbey.net\nBity.com\nBlockchain.info\nCex.io\nCoinbase.com\nCoinsbank.com\nCryptocompare.com\n\n\n-----\n\nExmo.com\nGatecoin.com\nGdax.com\nHitbtc.com\nHolytransaction.com\nKraken.com\nLitebit.eu\nLivecoin.net\nLocalbitcoins.com\nMinergate.com\nOkcoin.com\nSlushpool.com\n\nThe financial services sites included in the Onore2 campaign were targeted through\nwebinjects and socks. They included but were not limited to:\n\nAllianzbank.it\nBcc.it\nBnl.it\nBancacrfirenze.it\nBancagenerali.it\nBankingforyou.it\nCarifvg.it\nCaript.it\nCedacri.it\nCredem.it\nCsebo.it\nIcb.mps.it\nInbank.it\nPoste.it\nRelaxbanking.it\nTecmarket.it\n\n**Command and Control (C&C) Servers**\n\nThe C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps://0a109ec2ab47[.]com/. Note the use of HTTPS\nfor the malware phoning home through encryption to hide its exploits from traditional\nintrusion inspection controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Italian campaign C&C Whois\n\n_Figure 5: Italian campaign C&C Whois_\n\nThe domain is registered through Namesilo.com to a registrant with a fake address in the\nUS, and an email contact at minex-coin.com. Minex-coin is also registered with\nNamesilo.com, but the Whois is privacy protected. The name servers are in Russia:\nsamara.ens.mail.ru under a provider (ASN 47764) that comes up often in F5 Labs’ threat\nresearch.\n\n## May Campaign - Botnet “2.6.8” Targets US Financials\n\nThe latest sample analyzed from May 1, 2018 was marked as botnet “2.6.8”. Comparing this\nbotnet configuration to the Onore2 campaign and the other 2.6.8 campaign targeting\nJapanese financials (see next section), it has a different C&C address, and a\n“keylog_process.” Instead of adding the Internet browsers, “putty.exe” was added.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: US campaign “2.6.8” dynamic configuration\n\n_Figure 6: US campaign “2.6.8” dynamic configuration_\n\nThis is not the first time Panda has targeted US-based financial organizations. This\ncampaign had targets in 8 industries, 76% of which were US financial organizations. This\ncampaign also targeted half a dozen Canadian financial organizations, followed by\ncryptocurrency sites, global social media providers, search and email providers, payroll,\nentertainment, and tech providers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: May Panda campaign “2.6.8” targets US and Canadian financial services, social\nmedia, search and email providers, cryptocurrency sites, and payroll sites\n\n_Figure 7: May Panda campaign “2.6.8” targets US and Canadian financial services, social_\n_media, search and email providers, cryptocurrency sites, and payroll sites_\n\nPanda is hitting the typical large financial targets in the US, such as:\n\nAdp.com\nBankofamerica.com\nCiti.com\nPaychex.com\nWellsfargo.com\n\nThe Canadian financial organizations targeted are:\n\nbmo.com\ndesjardins.com\nroyalbank.com\nscotiabank.com\n\nThe cryptocurrency sites targeted are:\n\nBlockchain.info\nbbt.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign is also targeting major social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram,\nas well as messaging apps like Skype, and entertainment platforms like Youtube.\nAdditionally, Panda is targeting Microsoft.com, bing.com, and msn.com.\n\n**C&C Server**\n\nThe C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps://adshiepkhach[.]top/. Note the use of HTTPS\nagain to hide from traditional intrusion inspection controls.\n\nThe registrant is in Russia. The domain for the email contact is bk.ru, which is owned by the\nsame ASN 47764 that continually comes up in our threat research.\n\nFigure 8: US Campaign C&C Whois\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: US Campaign C&C Whois_\n\n## May Campaign - Botnet “2.6.8” Also Targets Japanese Financials\n\nThis sample was also analyzed from May 1, 2018 and was also marked as botnet “2.6.8”.\nComparing the two botnet configurations, there is an interesting change: when Zeus.Panda\nis targeting Japan, the authors removed the Content Security Policy (CSP) headers:\nremove_csp - 1 : The CSP header is a security standard for preventing cross-site scripting\n(XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks that could execute malicious code from\nan otherwise trusted site.3\n\nFigure 09: Japan campaign ”2.6.8” dynamic configuration\n\n_Figure 9: Japan campaign ”2.6.8” dynamic configuration_\n\nIn parallel with the US targeted campaign, this Panda campaign is targeting the following\nJapanese financial services organizations, most of which are credit card providers:\n\nsaisoncard.co.jp\nidemitsucard.com\nmufg jp\n\n\n-----\n\naeon.co.jp\nlifecard.co.jp\npocketcard.co.jp\ncedyna.co.jp\neposcard.co.jp\norico.co.jp\nrakuten*.co.jp\nsmbc-card.com\n\nThis campaign also targets the ecommerce giant Amazon; entertainment platform Youtube;\nMicrosoft.com, Live.com, Yahoo.com, Google.com, likely targeting email accounts; the social\nmedia leaders Facebook and Twitter; as well as a Japanese adult site Dmm.co, and\nPornhub.\n\nFigure 10: May Panda “2.6.8” campaign targets Japanese financial services, search and\nemail providers, social media, and adult sites\n\n_Figure 10: May Panda “2.6.8” campaign targets Japanese financial services, search and_\n_email providers, social media, and adult sites_\n\n**C&C Server**\n\nThe C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps://antrefurniture[.]top/. Again, note the use of\nHTTPS to hide activity from traditional intrusion inspection controls. It’s also a .top top-level\ndomain (TLD) like the US campaign. Spamhaus.org says 40% of .top TLDs are used for\nabusive purposes.[4]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe registrant is also in Russia, and the domain for the email contact is bk.ru like the US\ncampaign, which again is owned by ASN 47764 that continually comes up in F5 Labs’ threat\nresearch.\n\nFigure 11: Japan campaign C&C Whois\n\n_Figure 11: Japan campaign C&C Whois_\n\n## May Campaign - Botnet “Cosmos3” Targets Latin America Financial Services\n\nThe third parallel attack campaign, marked as botnet “cosmos3,” is currently active and\ntargeting financial institutions in Latin America.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: LATAM campaign “Cosmos3” dynamic configuration\n\n_Figure 12: LATAM campaign “Cosmos3” dynamic configuration_\n\nThis campaign primarily focused on banks in Argentina, Columbia, and Ecuador, followed by\nthe same social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr), search, email (MSN, Bing),\nentertainment (YouTube) and tech provider (Microsoft) targets as the other campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: May Panda \"Cosmos3\" campaign targets LATAM financial services, social media,\nsearch, email, and tech providers\n\n_Figure 13: May Panda \"Cosmos3\" campaign targets LATAM financial services, social media,_\n_search, email, and tech providers_\n\nThe Latin American targets in this campaign are:\n\navvillas.com.co\nbbvanet.com.co\nbancodebogota.com\nbancocredicoop.coop\nbancopatagonia.com.ar\nbanco.colpatria.com.co\ndavivienda.com\npichincha.com\nsantanderrio.com.ar\ntransaccionesbancolombia.com\n\n**C&C Server**\n\nThe C&C server for this campaign is: hxxps:// cotrus[.]co/. Note the use of HTTPS again to\nhide from traditional intrusion inspection controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domain is registered in China. The email registrant domain GMZ.com resolves to the\nGerman service provider 1&1.\n\nFigure 14: LATAM campaign C&C Whois\n\n_Figure 14: LATAM campaign C&C Whois_\n\n## QA in Production Tests\n\n\n-----\n\nContinual maintenance is required to keep the fraud operations going and making money.\nLike any business, this involves testing, and sometimes testing in production like we saw in\nthis campaign where the threat actors were infecting computers with different versions of the\nconfiguration.\n\nThis testing in production was against campaign 2.6.1 and had minor changes from the\nOnore2 campaign:\n\n“onore2” botnet was configured to grab cookies and cache\n“2.6.1” was marked to delete cookies and cache\nGrabber pause was marked 2, which is the indication on how long panda grabber will\nwait before starting the actual module.\nGrabber flags:\n\nGrab_del_cookie - 0\nGrab_del_cache - 0\n\nFigure 15: QA Test “2.6.1” dynamic configuration\n\n_Figure 15: QA Test “2.6.1” dynamic configuration_\n\n\n-----\n\nTo make sure the injection was working correctly, the Panda authors tested against an\nAustralian domain. Once the URL was detected, it sent an injection JS alert “Page Injected!”\n\nFigure 16: QA Injection alert, “Page Injected!”\n\n_Figure 16: QA Injection alert, “Page Injected!”_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPanda’s expansion beyond traditional banking targets is following the trend we noticed\nduring the 2017 holiday season.5 This is the first campaign we have seen targeting\ncryptocurrency sites, but it’s a move that makes sense, given the popularity of\ncryptocurrency. This act of simultaneous campaigns targeting several regions around the\nworld and industries indicates these are highly active threat actors, and we expect their\nefforts to continue with multiple new campaigns coming out as their current efforts are\ndiscovered and taken down. We will continue to look for patterns by monitoring this activity\nand the networks and services from which they are choosing to launch their activities. In the\nmeantime, we highly recommend all businesses maintain up-to-date patches on endpoints\nand ensure AV controls are continuously updated so their systems don’t get infected with this\nmalware. To protect your business from infected consumers that cause costly fraud\ninvestigations, monetary returns, and so on, we recommend instituting advanced web fraud\nprotections because this customized security control is not just for banks anymore!\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nMD5\n\nItaly and cryptocurrencies targets — e9d881b40d94a541b11fad44f1efbb7c\n\nUSA — 35a7e666942eb0c70e73d5dc502a97d2\n\nJapan — 3b78b983ed00cfa580c0b1c9beda4ca2\n\nLatin America — 8822dc8e66b51344b623c6cd29a91db1\n\nQA in production — 5d4c4668567b0b3321b0125779bdb3ae\n\nC&C servers\n\nItaly: hxxps://0a109ec2ab47[.]com\n\nUS: hxxps://adshiepkhach[.]top\n\nJapan: hxxps://antrefurniture[.]top\n\n\n-----\n\nLatin America: hxxps://cotrus[.]co\n\n\n-----",
