Our monitoring has enabled us to learn and attribute\n\nthis APT group’s movements, technical developments, and working relationships with\n\nother cyberespionage and cybercriminal groups. While patterns emerge during incident\n\nresponses and analysis, the group’s longevity in cyberespionage has neither wavered nor\n\nbecome predictable over time. Earth Aughisky remains a formidable threat and continues\n\nto disrupt daily operations of critical businesses, government organizations, and public\n\nservices, among others. In recent months, this cyberespionage group has even expanded\n\noperations to target more areas, high-value personnel, and organizations.\n\nIn this research, we look at the different malware families and routines previously connected\n\nto Earth Aughisky, as well as our insights on malware that have yet to be attributed to the\n\ngroup. We also include the overlapping technical details that link these malware families,\n\nas well as the connections of these routines to other APT groups active in cyberespionage\n\nand cybercrime to date. Finally, we analyzed the likely rationale for the recent changes in\n\nactivities, targeting, and deployments of this APT group, and the potential implications of\n\nthese changes to cybersecurity and real-world events.\n\nNoting the group’s access to a myriad of resources, Earth Aughisky remains a threat and\n\nwill likely take advantage of their long history in cyberespionage and cybercrime. The\n\ngroup’s previous and future potential targets can benefit in constantly learning, adjusting,\n\nand reinforcing their enabled security measures in order to mitigate the risks and damage\n\nthat Earth Aughisky can inflict in these turbulent times.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhile remote access trojan (RAT) Taidoor was disclosed[1] over a decade ago, reports[2] on advanced\n\npersistent threat (APT) group Earth Aughisky’s campaigns and activities continued[3] to surface[4] as victim\n\norganizations come clean on operation disruptions. The group constantly updates[5] malware routines to\n\nmanage security solutions’ developments and remain a formidable threat as the group improves[6] its\n\ntactics. In the last decade, Earth Aughisky has deployed a number of associated malware to facilitate their\n\nattacks, noted in their varying levels of sophistication.\n\nThe group’s targets[7] are primarily entities found in Taiwan,[8] with our solutions’ sensors detecting 95%\n\nof their targeted victims located in the country. In recent years, however, we noticed Earth Aughisky’s\n\nactivities extending to Japan beginning in late 2017 and 2018.[9]\n\nOur sensors caught the first activities targeting Japan towards the end of 2017, matching public reports\n\nof observed deployments in 2018. This additional targeting can also be seen to support the organizational\n\nchanges discussed in the latter part of this research. Earth Aughisky mostly targets government institutions,\n\nfollowed by a significant number of enterprise victims[10] in critical industries.[11]\n\n\n**Government**\n###### 57.7%\n\n**Telecommunication**\n###### 11.1%\n\n**Manufacturing**\n###### 9.2%\n\n**Heavy**\n###### 6.7%\n\n\n**Technology**\n###### 4.3%\n\n**Transportation**\n###### 3.7%\n\n**Healthcare**\n###### 1.2%\n\n**Others**\n###### 6.1%\n\n\nFigure 1. Earth Aughisky’s targets distributed by industry\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to other APT groups, Earth Aughisky’s cyberespionage activities have been closely monitored and\n\ntracked. The group uses spear phishing as a common means of entry. Once inside their target’s systems,\n\nwe observed varied efforts at evading detection, such as abusing legitimate user accounts and functions,\n\nleveraging weak network architecture designs, and deploying later-stage backdoors, to stay for as long\n\nas possible. While some agencies discuss the sensitivities and types of information the group exfiltrates,[12]\n\nothers have kept these details confidential.\n\nSince then, a number of malware families associated with Earth Aughisky have been disclosed or discussed\n\nby different sources, while some have yet to be attributed, documented, or noticed.

Observed malware activity timeline\n\n_(Note: Serkdes might have been shared by different cybercriminal groups, detailed in the_\n\n_Serkdes section)_\n\nEach malware serves a different purpose for every Earth Aughisky operation. Some of them are used\n\nfor initial intrusion, which are usually bundled with spear phishing emails or exploits, where samples\n\ncan be relatively easy to source. On the other hand, some malware families are used to maintain long\nterm footprints, activated through more sophisticated techniques, and sometimes wrapped with an extra\n\nloader.\n\nAmong the backdoors used in later stages, few are hidden more and most of the time can only be\n\nobserved in routines deployed to high-value targets. The variations in approaches based on the number\n\nof factors reduce the chance that important operations get disrupted and make important tools less\n\nlikely to be disclosed. Our observations showed that among the targets categorized as “Important”\n\n\n-----\n\ninclude industries such as critical infrastructure, government agencies, and military-related organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, “General” targets include vulnerable systems or offices in other industries like the healthcare\n\nsector.\n\n**Categorization** **Malware Families Used**\n\nInitial intrusion Roudan, Taikite, ASRWEC / Comeon /\nIllitat Downloader\n\nLater stage payloads Taleret, Kuangdao, Specas, Serkdes\n\nLater stage payloads: High-value targets Buxzop, GrubbyRAT\n\nShort-lived / Not widely used TWTRAT, SiyBot, GOORAT\n\nNot enough data to categorize LuckDLL, K4RAT\n\nTable 2.

Over the years,\n\ndifferent formats have been used for callback traffic, which basically contains an encoded MAC address\n\nand some random data. Detailed malware analysis are available in previous reports.\n\nFigure 3. Roudan network traffic, wherein 121212121212 is the encoded MAC address for\n_010101010101. INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE is sometimes enabled since April 2018_\n\nAlthough the name “Taidoor” has been adopted widely for years, threat actors actually name this malware\n\n“Roudan.” The term can be observed in looking at both backdoor and backdoor builder. A few samples\n\ncontain a simplified Chinese version of Roudan, which is “肉弹” or “肉蛋” (although not exactly the same,\n\n“肉弹” has a meaning similar to “cannon fodder”).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Roudan builders\n\nFigure 5. The Roudan project name (Hash: 18c67331716ae672e46583700c4a3eb2abdaa61c), “ziliao,” is\nwritten as “資料,” which simply means “data”\n\n##### Taleret (Dalgan)\n\nTaleret malware was disclosed in 2013[20] and has been repeatedly mentioned[21] with Roudan/Taidoor in\n\ndifferent reports.[22, 23], [24] The malware searches for C&C configurations on public blogs or other repositories\n\nand uses “XXXXX” or “ARTEMIS” as maker to locate the configuration. The configuration can be decrypted\n\nusing Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) key “C3 7F 12 A0”.[25]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Two different types of configurations found on the same blog\n\nTechnically, any service that serves configurable content can be abused to host the malware configuration.\n\nFrom our observations, there are also other web services embedded inside the malware.\n\nFigure 7. A special configuration host setting in Taleret capable of retrieving data from the blog and\nC&C server. In this example, Google groups (Hash: f2dfd3910017cd9b3798e9b9dce8ddcace5c6af6)\nand Facebook (Hash: 0dfd5669f67a3a992817ca6db096a4cbeadc3257) are abused to host malware\nconfigurations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two different Taleret implementations. A simpler one uses “XXXXX” as a marker, while another\n\nuses “ARTEMIS” as a marker, which has more accompanying functions.\n\n###### XXXXX Implementation\n\nOnce the backdoor retrieves the actual C&C server, it proceeds to save the configuration to the registry\n\n_<Software\\Microsoft\\SysInternal> in case the configuration is not available next time. The implementation_\n\nthen calls back to the C&C server with Cookie MCI and MUID.\n\nWhile MCI contains an encoded MAC address and IP Address with a corresponding logic, MUID is a\n\nrandom string generated based on CoCreateGuid or GetTickCount.\n\n**MAC and IP Address**\n**Encoding Logic**\n**Original Characters**\n\n'0'~'9' <ASCII Code> + 0x18\n\n'.' Transfer to 'R'\n\n'A' ~ 'F' <ASCII Code> + 0x1\n\nTable 3. MAC and IP address encoding in the MCI\n\nFigure 8. XXXXX implementation traffic\n\nSecurity teams and analysts can note that some samples drop the special log file at %tmp%\\~I.dat, which\n\ncontains the execution history.\n\nFigure 9. The ~alot.dat log file\n\n|MAC and IP Address Original Characters|Encoding Logic|\n|---|---|\n|'0'~'9'|<ASCII Code> + 0x18|\n|'.'|Transfer to 'R'|\n|'A' ~ 'F'|<ASCII Code> + 0x1|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ARTEMIS Implementation\n\nStudying the ARTEMIS implementation, the traffic contains information similar to MCI and MUID. But\n\ninstead of using a Cookie, it sends the information to the C&C server using an HTTPS post. The traffic\n\nstarts with “SVc5” followed by a hardcoded “1”, the size of both MCI and MUID feedback information, and\n\nthe encoded information itself. Studying the samples, we noticed that after 2015, the header changed to\n\n“SSSS” from “SVc5”, suggesting two different malware protocols in place, but analysis on the feedback\n\ninformation showed that it remained largely the same.\n\nFigure 10. ARTEMIS implementation traffic before 2015 (top), and after 2015 (bottom)\n\nAlthough it’s disabled in most samples, this implementation is capable of dropping the log file under\n\n_%tmp%\\~ah[4 random number].dat, which contains information likely designed for debugging._\n\nFigure 11. The ~ah[four random numbers].dat log file\n\n##### Serkdes (Yalink)\n\nIn 2018, security researchers NTT[26] and Macnica[27] reported malware Serkdes found in Taidoor-related\n\nincidents. In some versions, Serkdes is capable of loading the configuration from a separate file, sysconf.\n\ndll, via the executable GetPrivateProfileStruct.[28]\n\nFigure 12. Extra configuration file sysconf.dll (Hash: 4dc73b64f25c96d9bd58f9bc84aa9efa413620ed)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware has a hardcoded version of itself inside used as a mutex. We have identified V1.0, V1.2, V1.3,\n\nV1.5, V1.7, and V2.0 from the samples we have collected. While comparing Serkdes versions with sample\n\ncompile time, we found some conflicting details that suggests this backdoor is being used by, and shared\n\nwith, different related groups.\n\nThere are two batches of V1.0: one was compiled on March 2016, while the other batch was compiled from\n\nNovember 2017 to June 2018. However, before the 2016 version, there were already a lot of V1.X samples\n\nobserved in attacks, and may have been deployed by more than one cybercriminal group. Moreover,\n\nbetween the 2016 V1.0 and 2017 V1.0, there was V2.0, which was compiled in September 2017.\n\nAnother interesting finding is that some Serkdes samples call back to a subdomain under sslvps[.]top,\n\nwhich is believed[29] to be one of APT group DragonOK’s domains. This could indicate that Serkdes is not\n\nexclusively used by only one group in East Asia, and all the groups using the backdoor actively have the\n\nregion in their sights as a target.\n\n**Version** **Compilation Period**\n\n1.3 July 2014\n\n1.2 Sept 2014\n\n1.5 Nov2014\n\n1.7 Aug 2015 / Oct 2015\n\n1.0 Mar 2016\n\n2.0 Sept 2017\n\n1.0 Nov 2017 / June 2018\n\n1.2 Aug 2018\n\nTable 4. Summary of the compilation periods of Serkdes’ versions\n\n##### Buxzop/DropNetClient\n\nDropNetClient was first disclosed in HITCON 2015,[30] reportedly found abusing a DropBox API to perform\n\nC&C communication. Later the same year, the malware was reimplemented, with the new version now\n\ncalled “Buxzop.” As DropNetClient, the malware embeds a DropBox secret to perform C&C communication\n\nand encodes it with a customized algorithm.\n\n|Version|Compilation Period|\n|---|---|\n|1.3|July 2014|\n|1.2|Sept 2014|\n|1.5|Nov2014|\n|1.7|Aug 2015 / Oct 2015|\n|1.0|Mar 2016|\n|2.0|Sept 2017|\n|1.0|Nov 2017 / June 2018|\n|1.2|Aug 2018|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Buxzop string decoding\n\nOnce activated, the malware creates a folder, /1/001, which serves to store uploaded victim information.\n\nFigure 14. Buxzop callback to create a folder (the actual traffic is in https)\n\nThe uploaded information is in the format <<host-name>(<IP>[MAC Address])> such as win-123(0.0.0.0[00\n_01-02-03-04-05]). The information is encrypted with a modified version of RC4, which is basically an_\n\nadditional extra bit operation before and after the regular RC4 stream.\n\nFigure 15. Buxzop RC4\n\n##### K4RAT\n\nLooking at the call back traffic of K4RAT, “MP” is the campaign code embedded inside the malware\n\nconfiguration. “M10” contains MAC address, which is encrypted by RC4 with key “a1 a2 a3 a4”. “M11” is\n\nthe IP address with same encryption procedure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. K4RAT callback traffic\n\n##### LuckDLL\n\nLuckDLL is a relatively new backdoor that became active after 2020. Some samples contain a program\n\ndatabase (.pdb) string _<C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\luckDll\\x64\\Release\\luckDll.pdb> or_ _<C:\\Users\\user\\_\n\n_Desktop\\luckDll\\Release\\luckDll.pdb>._\n\nFigure 17. LuckDLL pdb string\n\nLuckDLL embeds a public key inside the configuration before communicating with the C&C server. It then\n\ngenerates a random session key and initialization vector (IV) to encrypt actual traffic.\n\nFigure 18. Public key (top) and session key (bottom)\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the initial communication, the public key encrypts the session key and IV, and shared with the C&C\n\nserver. The hash-like value after parameter api_key is also embedded in the malware configuration, likely\n\nused to identify which private key should be used to decrypt the traffic.\n\nFigure 19. LuckDLL traffic using the shared encrypted session key (while the actual traffic is in HTTPS)\n\n##### GrubbyRAT\n\nBased on our sensors and observation, GrubbyRAT is a rarely deployed backdoor. The threat actor\n\nonly deploys it mostly to important targets, depending on the APT group’s evaluation of the company,\n\npersonnel, or industry’s sensitivity level. The malware has a separate configuration file, which is encrypted\n\nwith a simple algorithm.\n\nThe configuration file is sometimes installed under an existing application folder or general system folders,\n\nand uses a similar file name as the application component. This technique indicates that GrubbyRAT is\n\ninstalled manually, likely after the actor has investigated the environment and gained an administrative\n\nlevel of control in the system.\n\nEvery time GrubbyRAT tries to read the configuration, it first reads the encrypted file and write the\n\ndecrypted configuration to a temporary folder with the prefix 123. The temp configuration then sets the\n\nfile time as C:\\windows\\system32\\c_20000.nls and deletes the temporary file after reading.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Decrypted GrubbyRAT configuration\n\nThe callback traffic is set in the format _<hardcoded 0x33><OSVERSIONINFOEXA result><Is Admin or_\n\n_not><getsockname result><machine name>._\n\nFigure 21. GrubbyRAT callback information\n\nA random key is generated from GetTickCount and uses it to encrypt the callback information, resulting\n\nin traffic with length _0xee, where the first_ _0xe is the random key, and the remaining is the encrypted_\n\ninformation.\n\nFigure 22. GrubbyRAT callback’s actual traffic\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Kuangdao (KD)\n\nKuangdao malware was disclosed on 2020[31] and as far back as 2008[32] or even earlier, as previous reports\n\nprovide detailed malware analysis that can be matched. As reported, there is a special string “KD” in .pdb.\n\nFigure 23. Kuangdao .pdb string\n\nInterestingly, Earth Aughisky previously named the C&C domain using the real malware name. For example,\n\nin certain Roudan samples, the C&C domain is named “roudan[.]serveftp[.]com”. With Kuangdao, we\n\nfound a special string in the C&C domain named “kuangd” or “kuangdao” (狂刀, meaning “madness\n\nblade”). This string could be observed in multiple backdoor configurations and matches the .pdb string\n\n“KD”, figuring in how actors named this malware.\n\nFigure 24. The Roudan C&C domain (Hash: a9982fede417d96b0a8604b485c548ad1c5f845b)\n\nFigure 25. The Kuangdao C&C domain\n\n##### Taikite (SVCMONDR)\n\nThe malware was first disclosed in a report[33] identifying CVE-2015-2545, using the dropped file name\n\nas malware name “SVCMONDR.” Given the .pdb in some samples and that the malware was mainly\n\nobserved in Taiwan, we named this malware “Taikite.” The first C&C callback traffic is encoded in Base64,\n\nwith detailed feedback data structure and behavior analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26. The Taikite .pdb string (Hash: 44673e28e03d642e937eb5d6fed9fc6535e4b872)\n\nFigure 27. Taikite traffic\n\n##### Specas\n\nThis malware family was categorized as Taidoor in an earlier report,[34] but is also sometimes identified as\n\n“Taleret.” As other communities have used the name Taleret to identify another malware[35] and the protocol\n\nis slightly different than regular Roudan, we will use the name “Specas” to describe this malware in this\n\nreport.\n\nOn the first C&C callback, it generates a random URL by template “http://%s:%d%s0%u%u” and\n\n“/%c%c%c%c%c.asp?”. Looking at the GET request line, _mhbvi is composed simply of five random_\n\ncharacters, with one hardcoded “0” after a question mark. For the remaining numbers on the line\n\n“100287525376”, GetTickCount “287525376” is the derived result. “100” before “287525376” is calculated\n\nas (287525376 & 0X1FF) + 100, which is likely used as the checksum in the traffic.\n\nFigure 28. Specas traffic\n\nThe malware also drops a log file at [current module name].xxt, which contains the execution history.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. Specas .xxt log\n\nBased on analysis, Specas malware is also capable of reading extra proxy settings from %systemroot%\\\n\n_system32\\sprxx.dll, with the format being <IP>:<Port>._\n\nFigure 30. Specas sprxx.dll proxy setting\n\n##### SiyBot\n\nSiyBot is a backdoor we observed to be deployed less and only in few instances of an attack. Similar to\n\nBuxzop, SiyBot abuses public services to perform C&C communication. The malware mainly leverages\n\nGubb and 30 Boxes in its earlier version.\n\nFigure 31. Service API\n\nLike most other malware that abuse public web service, the necessary credential or token can be found\n\nin the malware configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 32. Embedded 30 Boxes credential in the malware\n\nSiyBot supports few basic functions such as chconf, run, download run, and download.\n\nFigure 33. Backdoor command\n\n##### TWTRAT\n\nTWTRAT is an old backdoor compiled around 2010 based on analysis of the malware binary, first observed\n\nas abusing Twitter direct messages to perform C&C communication. TWTRAT only supports some basic\n\nfunctions, specifically “down,” “run,” and “downr”; the commands are very similar to SiyBot. Given that\n\nthere are new backdoors abusing different public services since the year of compilation and that we have\n\nnot observed activities of TWTRAT afterward, this backdoor was only used for a limited period.\n\nFigure 34. TWTRAT invokes direct_message\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 35. Twitter account embedded in the malware configuration\n\n##### GOORAT\n\nGOORAT is a possible precedent to Taleret, observed active around 2009 to 2010 based on the samples\n\nsubmitted in repositories and analysis of the malware binary. Like Taleret, the malware searches for content\n\nbetween “XXXXX”, but the content inside is a command rather than a configuration. Most samples were\n\nconfigured to retrieve data from Google groups, while the rest of the samples we observed would search\n\nfor data from different blogs. Eventually, it appears that the group has apparently abandoned this branch\n\nand turned to using Taleret instead.\n\nFigure 36. Embedded site in GOORAT\n\n##### ASRWEC Downloader\n\nASRWEC is a downloader capable of searching for the actual payload on blogs or other repositories\n\nthat was first disclosed in 2012[36] and subsequently reported on. This downloader first locates the actual\n\npayload between a special marker, “yxyyyxyy”, with actual decryption procedures documented in detail.\n\nThe payload we observed includes both Roudan and SiyBot.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 37. ASRWEC payload found from the blog (the characters after “yxyyyxyy”)\n\n##### Comeon Downloader\n\nSimilar to ASRWEC, Comeon is another type of downloader from Earth Aughisky capable of searching\n\nfor payload between *****. We call this Comeon because of the export function name we observed during\n\nanalysis. Aside from using a different maker, most Comeon payload were hosted on private servers rather\n\nthan a public blog such as 210[.]240[.]26[.]2/java.txt or TheoreticalModel[.]onmypc[.]us/u.txt.\n\nThe actual payload could be decrypted by:\n\n1. Skipping the first character\n\n2. Decoding using Base64\n\n3. Decrypting with RC4, using key “A1 A2 A3 A4 A5”\n\nBased on our observations of samples, the payload of Comeon downloader is Roudan, such as the one\n\nhosted on kaiwanxiao[.]pixnet[.]net/blog/post/366093431.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38. Comeon downloader payload on blog\n\nThe malware is capable of dropping the log file at %temp%\\iod.zp, with the content likely designed for\n\ndebugging purposes.\n\nFigure 39. The iod.zp log file\n\n##### Illitat Downloader\n\nIllitat was first disclosed on 2012[37] and again observed in 2015.[38] This downloader calls back to fc.asp\n\nusing the local environment information it collects such as the machine name and IP address, and then\n\ncalls dw.html to download the actual payload. Based on the reports, all the samples’ payloads are Roudan.\n\nFigure 40. Special mutex in some samples used to name this malware\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nWhile some of the listed malware families here were previously documented and attributed to Earth\n\nAughisky, we list the other malware families we analyzed (that have yet to be reported) in this section to\n\ncomplete the APT group’s technical profile. We also identify and connect a number of these unreported\n\nmalware families based on analysis of the sourced samples over the years, such as similarities in codes,\n\ndomains, and naming conventions.\n\n##### Connections Between Families\n\nWe describe the links between the different malware and how our observations have led us to tie them\n\ntogether as being employed by Earth Aughisky.\n\n**8**\n\nSerkdes Buxzop Taikite K4RAT\n\n**2** **8**\n\n**6**\n\n**7** **1**\n\n**5**\n\n**1** **5**\n\n**1** **5** **1** **1** IP/Domain/Passive DNS overlap\n\nLuckDLL Kuangdao Specas **2** Host on same repository\n\n**1** **3** **3** Same function (logging/proxy)\n\n**6** **5** **7**\n\n**4** Payload and downloader\n\nTaleret **5** Special string (marker/class name)\n\n**1** **1**\n\n**6** **6** Same incident\n\n**2** **3**\n\nGrubbyRAT **3** GOORAT **1** **7** Same loader/Dropper\n\n**1** **1** **8** Same campaigns code/Password\n\n**7**\n**2** **7**\n\n**4**\n\nRoudan\n\n**4**\n\nPittyTiger SiyBot ASRWEC/Illitat/Comeon GOORAT\n\n**1**\n\nFigure 41.

Since there is no evidence\n\nthat either of the droppers is leveraged by more groups, we believe TWTRAT is also one of Earth Aughisky’s\n\nmalware.\n\n###### Taleret and Buxzop\n\nEarth Aughisky has been using a special loader for several years posing as one of the different system\n\nDLLs such as version.dll or cryptbase.dll. Once activated, it loads an encrypted payload from a separate\n\nfile and decrypts it with RC4. Based on the samples we collected, most of the payloads are located at\n\none of the five files: [Same Folder]\\master_patch.dat, master_update.dat, crypt_base.dat, Extensions.xml,\n\nor ipatch.dat.\n\nAfter loading the payload into the memory, it searches for “MyThread” or “MyBegin” export function and\n\ntransfers the control to the in-memory executable. Based on the samples we collected, most payloads\n\nare Taleret and a few instances had Buxzop.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Links to PittyTiger\n\nAirbus Cybersecurity published a report[43] on the APT group PittyTiger[44] disclosing a detailed analysis of\n\nthe threat actor, including Rerol malware (MD5: b6380439ff9ed0c6d45759da0f3b05b8). But researchers\n\nfrom Mandiant also connected Earth Aughisky to PittyTiger via Roudan.[45]\n\nAccording to the disclosure, PittyTiger has been active since 2011 and attacked targets in Europe. Rerol[46]\n\nwas used for initial intrusion and was reportedly capable of downloading a second payload from the\n\ncontroller. The dropper of Rerol mentioned is a specially crafted dropper widely observed in other Earth\n\nAughisky attacks. Based on analysis of the sample of the dropper we collected, majority of the payloads\n\nwere the different Earth Aughisky malware, but a few of them also noticeably dropped PittyTiger artifacts\n\n(such as Rerol, trojan MMRAT,[47] and a decoy document used to deceive victims).\n\n**Earth**\n**MMRAT** **Rerol**\n**Aughisky**\n\nMay 2014 April 2014 April 2010\nJune 2014 June 2010\nJul 2014 March 2011\nAug 2014 June 2011\n\nAug 2011\nMarch 2012\nAug 2012\nSept 2012\nJan 2013\nMarch 2013\nApril 2013\nMay 2013\nJune 2013\nJuly 2013\nAug 2013\nSept 2013\nJan 2014\nMay 2014\nJune 2014\nJuly 2014\nDec 2014\nApril 2015\nNov 2015\nMarch 2017\n\nTable 14.

For those we confirmed not using proxies or virtual private networks\n\n(VPNs), most of them were tracked as originating and located in Fuzhou, Fujian. Considering some\n\nconnections made between Earth Aughisky and PittyTiger, these observations also match the Airbus\n\nCybersecurity PittyTiger report described.[53]\n\n\n-----\n\n## Updates and Changes\n\n\nIXESHE\ndisappeared\n\n\nRoudan with\n.pdb observed\n\n\n(Old) Incident numbers\nSerkdes 1.0 dropped Serkedes 2.0 Serkdes 1.2\n\n**2016** **2017** **2018** **2019**\n\nFigure 52. Special events timeline between 2017 to 2019\n\nEarth Aughisky has been active for a long time. However, our continuous tracking of the group showed\n\nsomething interesting that has been happening since 2017. In this section, we describe our observations,\n\nspecifically on potential changes in Earth Aughisky as an organization.\n\n##### Level of Activity\n\nThe first landscape change is the noticeable drop of attack incidents in Taiwan. In a nutshell, Earth Aughisky\n\nwas active before 2017, but activities significantly dropped during the said year and dropped further after\n\n2019. Meanwhile, other APT groups previously documented as targeting Taiwan also had notable shifts in\n\ntargets and activities in Japan and Southeast Asia, pointing to a likelihood of related internal changes in\n\norganization and objectives.[54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]\n\n|Col1|Col2|Simpler vers Roudan obs|Col4|Col5|Col6|ion of erved|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||\n||New Serkd||||es 1|.0|\n||||||||\n||First inc Japan r|||ide eco|nt i rde|n d|\n||||||||\n|Serkedes 2.0|||||||\n||||||||\n\n|Incident numbers dropped|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n\n\n-----\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\nFigure 53. Trend of incidents observed (top) and trend of sample compilation time (bottom)\n\n##### Group Overlap\n\nFor the incidents in Japan wherein Serkdes malware was observed and identified, it seems\n\nthat there are interesting overlaps between different groups. Certain Upheart samples (Hash:\n\na7b7a6a9b4aafe2ac1f792c901a21906df3c09adea6549446da1ed72f90b9194) we identified,\n\nwhich was initially reported as belonging to DragonOK based on a report by Macnica,[60] were\n\nsubmitted to a public repository by the same source around the same time a Serkdes sample (Hash:\n\n5888b026ab7df42ed32d53038e9b8541cf272f0010385694e2ba28e0454f14c2) was also uploaded. This\n\nsuggests a possibility that both samples are employed in an attack. In addition, as mentioned in Serkdes\n\nsection, some Serkdes samples call back to a subdomain under sslvps[.]top, which is also believed to be\n\none of DragonOK’s domains.\n\nThe NTT report presented another overlap with PoshC2, but the evidence was not strong enough to\n\nmake the connection. We have never seen Earth Aughisky utilize PoshC2 before. While it might be a\n\ncoincidence that they adopted a new open-source tool, other researchers reported that PoshC2 was\n\nadopted[61] by DragonOK and BlackTech[62] for activities in Japan around the same time. We continue to\n\nmonitor and study these instances for better threat intelligence and knowledge on these connections.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Special Roudan Sample\n\nNTT pointed out that they acquired a Roudan sample that seemingly contained only two functions, which\n\nis less than the older samples of the malware. Based on the samples we collected, Roudan seems to\n\nhave been developed into a simpler version between 2016 and 2017, potentially indicating a new malware\n\ndeveloper team operating within the group.\n\nIn some samples compiled in 2019, the .pdb string C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\MsgHandleDll0304\\Release\\\n\n_MsgHandleDll.pdb was observed in some samples, which is something that we have not observed in the_\n\nlast decade.\n\nFigure 54. Roudan .pdb string (Hash: 071e0693b5b6219e6cf02621e02c09f36ddee5e3)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEarth Aughisky has demonstrated a long history in cyberespionage. Since its first disclosure, there have\n\nbeen continuous reports about its activities for over a decade. Tracking this group and their longevity in\n\ncyber espionage have given security teams and analysts time to gather information and technical data on\n\ntheir knowledge and skill development as a group, as well as look into the group’s relations and potential\n\nlinks to other groups and activities.\n\nExamples of these are GOORAT and TWTRAT’s short period of use. Studying a small number of samples\n\nof TWTRAT backdoor and not seeing this malware family used after 2010 suggests that the group’s\n\nexploration of their technical skills had to yet reach maturity. The coding was too complex and contained\n\nunnecessary data that was not required to abuse the services it needed, which was a strong indicator that\n\nthe operation and the developers’ skills for malware implementation were still in development.\n\nIn GOORAT’s case, the subsequent choice of using Taleret over this earlier backdoor reduced the resources\n\nneeded to operate the malware: Taleret hosts the malware configuration on web services, while GOORAT\n\nhosts the command itself. While not an exhaustive list of their development, and even as newer and more\n\ndeveloped security technologies (such as behavior analysis and monitoring) can detect and block these\n\nthreats especially in public services, Earth Aughisky choosing Taleret allowed the group to:\n\n- Change the C&C server being used faster and easier.\n\n- Avoid in-depth analysis from security teams and researchers.\n\n- Minimize the coding complexity needed in communicating by web service.\n\nMoreover, while relatively inactive compared to a number of APT groups, studying links such as this group’s\n\npotential connection to PittyTiger allow security practitioners and researchers a general understanding\n\nof APT groups via closer analyses of previous deployments. These groups can be connected to actual\n\norganizations or considered an extension of certain government agencies, and having the background of\n\nthese connections allow security teams and (potential) targets to make ample preparations in dealing with\n\nattacks from such threat actors working in tandem or individually.\n\nIn addition, the changes from and in the activities of the group can be matched with real-world organizational\n\nchanges such as political shifts and transitions. For Earth Aughisky, changes in routines, frequency, or\n\nlevel of activity, and overlaps in the organization can imply:\n\n\n-----\n\n- A change in their focus or objectives, making their target countries, regions, industries, and/or\n\ncompanies different.\n\n- A change in their tool arsenal, which means they might begin using malware previously documented\n\nand attributed to other groups and vice versa.\n\n- A change in their current malware and infrastructure.\n\nGroups such as Earth Aughisky have plenty of resources to develop varied custom tools for their operations\n\nand will likely take advantage of their long cybercriminal and cyberespionage history. After a decade, this\n\nlevel of consistency and even this observed break from activity can be looked as either a period of respite\n\nfrom attacks for victims or a period for a higher level of vigilance for when the threat actor decides to\n\nbecome active again.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nFind the full list of the IOCs related to Earth Aughisky in the Reference section.[63]\n\n\n-----\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n|Reconnaissance|Resource Development|Initial Access|Execution|Persistence|Privilege Escalation T1546 Event Triggered Execution|Defense Evasion T1140 Deobfuscate/ Decode Files or Information|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|T1598 Phishing for Information|T1583 Acquire Infrastructure|T1566 Phishing|T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter|T1546 Event Triggered Execution|||\n||T1586 Compromise Accounts|T1078 Valid Accounts|T1203 Exploitation for Client Execution|T1574 Hijack Execution Flow|T1574 Hijack Execution Flow|T1480 Execution Guardrails|\n||T1584 Compromise Infrastructure||T1129 Shared Modules|T1205 Traffic Signaling|T1055 Process Injection|T1211 Exploitation for Defense Evasion|\n||T1587 Develop Capabilities||T1072 Software Deployment Tools|T1078 Valid Accounts|T1078 Valid Accounts|T1564 Hide Artifacts|\n||T1588 Obtain Capabilities||T1569 System Services||T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation|T1574 Hijack Execution Flow|\n||T1608 Stage Capabilities||T1204 User Execution|||T1070 Indicator Removal on Host|\n|||||||T1036 Masquerading|\n|||||||T1112 Modify Registry|\n|||||||T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information|\n|||||||T1055 Process Injection|\n|||||||T1620 Reflective Code Loading|\n|||||||T1205 Traffic Signaling|\n|||||||T1078 Valid Accounts|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Credential Access|Discovery|Lateral Movement|Collection|Command and Control|Exfiltration T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|T1003 OS Credential Dumping|T1135 Network Share Discovery|T1570 Lateral Tool Transfer|T1560 Archive Collected Data|T1132 Data Encoding||\n|T1056 Input Capture|T1016 System Network Configuration Discovery|T1072 Software Deployment Tools|T1005 Data from Local System|T1001 Data Obfuscation|T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service|\n|T1110 Brute Force|T1201 Password Policy Discovery||T1114 Email Collection|T1573 Encrypted Channel||\n|T1555 Credentials from Password Stores|T1007 System Service Discovery||T1056 Input Capture|T1008 Fallback Channels||\n||T1049 System Network Connections Discovery||T1113 Screen Capture|T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer||\n||T1057 Process Discovery|||T1095 Non-Application Layer Protocol||\n||T1083 File and Directory Discovery|||T1571 Non-Standard Port||\n||T1087 Account Discovery|||T1090 Proxy||\n|||||T1205 Traffic Signaling||\n|||||T1102 Web Service||\n\n\n-----\n\n##### References\n\n1 Mila.
