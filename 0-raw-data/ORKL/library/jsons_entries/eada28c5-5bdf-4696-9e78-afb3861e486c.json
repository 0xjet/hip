Two new malware families are**\n\n**used in this campaign that we name UP007 and SLServer.**\n\n**The UP007 malware family was previously observed by Arbor Security Emergency Response Team (ASERT) in the report**\n\n**[“Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger,” which analyzes a set of samples that were hosted on the national level electoral](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/uncovering-the-seven-pointed-dagger/)**\n\n**commission of Myanmar (Burma): the Myanmar Union Election Commission. One of the samples analyzed was described as**\n\n**[“unknown malware”, which we call UP007 based on an identifier in the malware’s network traffic. In a �report released today, ASERT](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/four-element-sword-engagement)**\n\n**describes a series of campaigns targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese interests, which also includes details on the same**\n\n**UP007 sample we analyze.**\n\n**[A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report includes analysis of the SLServer sample we analyze (PwC refers to the family as](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant-election-targetting.html)**\n\n**SunOrcal). We refer to the malware as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the file. These previous reports collected samples from�**\n\n**[VirusTotal. We received the original email lure and samples used in the campaign from a targeted source, and found that both](https://www.virustotal.com/)**\n\n**UP007 and SLServer were sent to targets in the same attack.**\n\n**This research note builds on previous reporting by more closely examining UP007 and SLServer, variations of these samples found**\n\n**“in the wild”, and the connections between these attacks and other campaigns. Previous reports have shown overlap in the tactics,**\n\n**techniques, and procedures used in this campaign in other operations targeting groups in Burma, Hong Kong, and the Tibetan**\n\n**community. We speculate that either a single threat actor is targeting these groups or some level of formal or informal resource**\n\n**sharing is occurring between the operators behind the campaigns.**\n\n# Espionage Campaign Targeting Hong Kong Activists\n\n**In the week prior to the January 2016 Taiwanese General Election, Hong Kong-based pro-democracy activists received a targeted**\n\n**email purporting to come from a Taiwanese non-profit organization with information about the upcoming election. The email included�**\n\n**[a Google Drive link to a RAR archive file: “�2016總統[選舉⺠情中⼼預測值].rar”, which translates to “Predictive Forecast from Centre](http://www.rarlab.com/)**\n\n**of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections.rar”.**\n\n**_Figure 1: Targeting email sent to Hong Kong democracy activists_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**districts conclude their voting (1041229); Centre of Public Sentiment’s predicted forecast in the 2016 presidential elections (104.12.28).**\n\n**The 2016 Election enters its crucial final 10 days. On the 6th, Ing-wen Tsai, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) candidate, called on�**\n**DPP supporters to consolidate their votes. She warned that the intense internal competition within the DPP had caused people to be**\n**worried about a splitting of the votes, potentially leading to the loss of the 15th and 16th seats.**\n\n**The election day is on the 16th. Besides the presidential election, there is also the legislative election which includes district seats and**\n**non-district seats. There are 34 non-district seats in total, of which the DPP won 13 during the last election. Given the higher degree of**\n**support this time, the DPP should be able to secure 16 seats. But as the New Power Party’s (NPP) influence and support grows, it might�**\n**threaten the DPP.**\n\n**In order to promote support for non-district legislators, the DPP Central Standing Committee organized a campaign event this afternoon.**\n**The chairwoman of the DPP, Ing-wen Tsai, said there are only ten days left before the election, and the three things she worried the most**\n**about were: 1) ballot bribery, which may cause DPP’s loss in certain swing areas; 2) whether young people would return home to vote on**\n**Jan 16th; 3) vote splitting that may lead good candidates to lose in non-district legislative elections.**\n\n**Predictive Forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 Presidential Elections.rar**\n\n\n# Delivery Mechanism\n\n**We have observed the use of Google Drive links as a delivery vector in recent campaigns targeting Tibetan organizations. In these**\n\n**[campaigns, Google Drive links were used to send malware and phishing pages. We have also seen the tactic used in recent](https://citizenlab.org/2015/06/targeted-attacks-against-tibetan-and-hong-kong-groups-exploiting-cve-2014-4114/)**\n\n**[espionage campaigns targeting an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. The prior use of Google Drive as a](https://citizenlab.org/2015/10/targeted-attacks-ngo-burma/)**\n\n**delivery vector against Tibetan groups is significant, as Tibetan groups are �promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending file�**\n\n**attachments to prevent infection from document-based malware.**\n\n## Examining the RAR Archive\n\n**Within the linked RAR archive, the top three directories contain a mix of malicious and benign documents, as well as shortcuts that**\n\n**run two executables that are deeply nested within hidden directories in the archive. The file structure of this archive is shown in�**\n\n**Figure 2.**\n\n**_Figure 2: File structure of delivered RAR archive._**\n\n**The top level directory of this archive contains a benign Word document named 聲明.doc, which translates to “Statement.doc”. The**\n\n**text of this document is written in Chinese and is related to the Taiwanese election.**\n\n\n**Document Text:**\n**73個⽴[委選區選情研判](1041229),**\n**2016總統[選舉⺠情中⼼預測值](104.12.28).**\n**⽂件[內容僅代表個⼈⽴場，僅供參閱。解壓選舉⺠情中⼼預測值到桌⾯即可查閱全部數據].**\n\n\n**English Translation:**\n**Election polling of 73 legislative electoral districts（12/29/104).**\n**Predicted forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 presidential elections (12/28/104).**\n**All the documents represent personal views and are for reference only.

The lack of emphasis on tricking targets into running a single**\n\n**malicious file is interesting. We are unsure as to why the operators chose to deploy two separate infection chains within the same�**\n\n**delivery mechanism. It is also unclear why the benign document was included at the top directory, as this would require more user**\n\n**interaction for a compromise to be successful. It is possible that this mixture of benign and malicious files is intended to lull the�**\n\n**targets into a false sense of security.**\n\n**Within the archive there are two Microsoft Word files: �2016總統[選舉⺠情中⼼預測值].doc (translation: “Predictive forecast from**\n\n**Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections”) and 73個⽴[委選區選情研判].doc (translation: “Election polling of 73**\n\n**legislative electoral districts”).

The focus of the report was on the�**\n\n**discovery of the new Trochilus RAT. However, one of the RAR files was noted as unknown malware. This sample (�Security-**\n\n**Patch-Update.exe, MD5: 82896b68314d108141728a4112618304) is also UP007, signed with the 5D 11 78 4F B8 17 65**\n\n**02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9 certificate and configured to communicate with �59.188.12[.]123 directly over port 8008,**\n\n**identical to fzyy.exe mentioned above. In this instance, if any of the previously discussed registry keys were present, the sample**\n\n**will execute the dropped runas.exe binary. Given this execution, nvsvc.exe is likely also an older component. As discussed**\n\n**above the UP007 sample we analyzed shares the same C2 (computer.security-centers[.]com) as the Trochilus RAT**\n\n**[sample reported by ASERT.](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/uncovering-the-seven-pointed-dagger/)**\n\n**[In November 2015, Palo Alto Networks reported on a newly discovered trojan referred to as Bookworm. They revealed a campaign](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/attack-campaign-on-the-government-of-thailand-delivers-bookworm-trojan/)**\n\n**focused on the targeting of government entities in Thailand. The campaign used a malware family known as FFRAT, and the sample**\n\n**described in the report connected to the domain hkemail.f3322[.]org for command and control. In August 2015, the same**\n\n**domain was reportedly used to host an instance of UP007 as well.**\n\n**[Finally, the relationship between the SLServer C2 www.olinaodi[.]com and our previous research into the Surtr malware family was](https://citizenlab.org/2013/08/surtr-malware-family-targeting-the-tibetan-community/)**\n\n**[highlighted by PwC through the overlap in the toucan6712@163[.]com registrant. We tracked malware campaigns using the](https://targetedthreats.net/)**\n\n**Surtr family that have targeted Tibetan organizations since 2013.**\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**This latest espionage campaign against Hong Kong activists appears to be connected to a broader set of targets, and operations.**\n\n**[The recent detailed reporting by ASERT makes it clear that the UP007 malware family has been found in previous campaigns](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2015-08-Uncovering-the-Seven-Pointed-Dagger.pdf)**\n\n**targeting Burmese interests. In addition, the campaigns share some C2 infrastructure with previous operations against targets in**\n\n**Thailand and the Tibetan community. The domain registration connections between SLServer infrastructure and Surtr infrastructure**\n\n**also suggests some level of potential coordination between campaigns targeting Hong Kong groups and the Tibetan community.**\n\n**Despite these connections, it is unclear if these campaigns are being conducted by the same threat actor.**\n\n**We cannot exclude the possibility that distinct operators have a degree of sharing of tools and infrastructure. Alternatively, security**\n\n**[researcher Ned Moran has articulated a concept of a “digital quartermaster,” to refer to an actor that supplies threat infrastructure](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)**\n\n**and malware development resources to multiple groups. While these scenarios are plausible, we do not have enough data to**\n\n**properly assess these competing hypotheses, or to make conclusive statements about the identity of the threat actors.**\n\n**What is clear from our analysis is that civil society groups across Asia continue to be targeted by persistent and organized cyber**\n\n**espionage campaigns. Civil society often lack the resources and awareness to defend against these operations and closer attention**\n\n**to the threats they face is needed.**\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**[Special thanks to Valkyrie-X Security Research Group and ASERT.
