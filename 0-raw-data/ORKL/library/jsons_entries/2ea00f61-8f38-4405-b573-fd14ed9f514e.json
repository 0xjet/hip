The average number of targets has increased by ten times,\nreaching 1,000 daily.\n\nThe botnet now relies on 42 C2 domains to operate 60,000 active bot nodes daily,\ngenerating up to 1Tbps of destructive traffic.\n\n**List of C2 addresses used**\n\n**by Fodcha** _(360Netlab)_\nAccording to Netlab, Fodcha reached a new peak on October 11, 2022, attacking 1,396\ntargets in a single day.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome notable examples of confirmed attacks of Fodcha include:\n\nA DDoS attack against a healthcare organization on June 7 and 8, 2022.\nA DDoS attack against the communication infrastructure of a company in September\n2022.\nA 1Tbps DDoS attack against a well-known cloud service provider on September 21,\n2022.\n\nMost of Fodcha’s targets are located in China and the United States, but the botnet’s reach is\nalready global, having infected systems in Europe, Australia, Japan, Russia, Brazil, and\nCanada.\n\n**Fodcha's victim heatmap and activity volume diagram** _(360Netlab)_\n\n## Embedding ransom demands\n\nNetlab's analysts believe Fodcha is making money by renting its firepower to other threat\nactors who wish to launch DDoS attacks. However, the latest version also includes extortion\nby demanding a Monero ransom to stop the attacks.\n\nBased on DDoS packets deciphered by Netlab, Fodcha now demands the payment of 10\nXMR (Monero) from victims, worth approximately $1,500.\n\nThese demands are embedded in the 'Data' portion of the botnet's DDoS packets and warn\nthat the attacks will continue unless a payment is made.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fodcha's ransom message** _(360Netlab)_\nHowever, as Monero is a privacy coin, it is much harder to trace. Therefore, it is not offered\nfor sale by almost all US crypto exchanges due to the legal requirements to prevent money\nlaundering or other illicit activity.\n\nTherefore, while ransomware gangs and other threat actors commonly request XMR as a\npayment option, almost all companies choose to pay in bitcoin, which will likely be a similar\nsituation with DDoS attacks.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Updated RapperBot malware targets game servers in DDoS attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/updated-rapperbot-malware-targets-game-servers-in-ddos-attacks/)\n\n[Malicious extension lets attackers control Google Chrome remotely](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-extension-lets-attackers-control-google-chrome-remotely/)\n\n[New Chaos malware infects Windows, Linux devices for DDoS attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chaos-malware-infects-windows-linux-devices-for-ddos-attacks/)\n\n[Pro-Russian hacktivists take down EU Parliament site in DDoS attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pro-russian-hacktivists-take-down-eu-parliament-site-in-ddos-attack/)\n\n[FBI: Hacktivist DDoS attacks had minor impact on critical orgs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-hacktivist-ddos-attacks-had-minor-impact-on-critical-orgs/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
