    "plain_text": "## APT42: Crooked Charms, Cons\n and Compromises\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that APT42 is an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage group\ntasked with conducting information collection and surveillance operations against individuals and\norganizations of strategic interest to the Iranian government. We further estimate with moderate\nconfidence that APT42 operates on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Intelligence\nOrganization (IRGC-IO) based on targeting patterns that align with the organization's operational mandates\nand priorities.\n\nActive since at least 2015, APT42 is characterized by highly targeted spear phishing and surveillance\noperations against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to Iran. The group’s operations,\nwhich are designed to build trust and rapport with their victims, have included accessing the personal and\ncorporate email accounts of government officials, former Iranian policymakers or political figures, members\nof the Iranian diaspora and opposition groups, journalists, and academics who are involved in research on Iran.\nAfter gaining access, the group has deployed mobile malware capable of tracking victim locations, recording\nphone conversations, accessing videos and images, and extracting entire SMS inboxes.\n\nAPT42 has a demonstrated ability to alter its operational focus as Iran’s priorities evolve over time.\nWe anticipate APT42 will continue to conduct cyber espionage operations in support of Iran’s strategic\npriorities in the long term based on their extensive operational history and imperviousness to public\nreporting and infrastructure takedowns.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Overview\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that APT42 is a prolific\nand well-resourced threat actor that carries out Iranian statesponsored espionage and surveillance activity in support of Iran’s\nstrategic priorities. The group has been active since at least early\n2015 and relies primarily on highly targeted social engineering\nefforts to achieve its objectives against both individuals and\norganizations of interest to the Iranian government. APT42\noperations broadly fall into three categories:\n\n- Credential harvesting: APT42 frequently targets corporate\n\nand personal email accounts through highly targeted spearphishing campaigns with enhanced emphasis on building trust\nand rapport with the target before attempting to steal their\ncredentials. Mandiant also has indications that the group uses\ncredential harvesting to collect Multi-Factor Authentication\n(MFA) codes to bypass authentication methods and has used\ncompromised credentials to pursue access to the networks,\ndevices and accounts of employers, colleagues and relatives.\n\n\n\n- Surveillance operations: As of at least late 2015, a subset\n\nof APT42’s infrastructure served as command-and-control\n(C2) servers for Android mobile malware designed to track\nlocations, monitor communications and generally surveil the\nactivities of individuals of interest to the Iranian government,\nincluding activists and dissidents inside Iran.\n\n- Malware deployment: While APT42 primarily prefers credential\n\nharvesting over activity on disk, several custom backdoors\nand lightweight tools complement its arsenal. The group\nlikely incorporates these tools into their operations when the\nobjectives extend beyond credential harvesting.\n\nMandiant has observed over 30 confirmed APT42 targeted\noperations spanning these categories since early 2015. The total\nnumber of APT42 intrusion operations is almost certainly much\nhigher based on the group’s high operational tempo, visibility\ngaps caused in part by the group’s targeting of personal email\naccounts and domestically focused efforts and extensive\nopen-source industry reporting on threat clusters likely\nassociated with APT42.\n\nAPT42 had been previously tracked by Mandiant as UNC788.\n\n\nCredential Harvesting Surveillance Operations Malware Development\n\n**FIGURE 1. APT42 operations by category.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targeting\n\nThe targeting patterns for APT42 operations are similar to other\nIranian cyber espionage actors, with a large segment of activity\nfocused on the Middle East region. However, unlike other\nsuspected IRGC-affiliated cyber espionage groups that have\nfocused on targeting the defense industrial base or conducting\nlarge-scale collection of personally identifiable information (PII),\nAPT42 primarily targets organizations and individuals deemed\nopponents or enemies of the regime, specifically gaining access\nto their personal accounts and mobile devices. The group has\nconsistently targeted Western think tanks, researchers,\njournalists, current Western government officials, former\nIranian government officials and the Iranian diaspora abroad.\n\nSome APT42 activity indicates the group alters its operational\nfocus as Iran’s priorities evolve. This includes targeted\noperations against the pharmaceutical sector at the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and the pursuit of domestic\nand foreign-based opposition groups prior to an Iranian\npresidential election. This indicates that APT42 is trusted by the\nIranian government to quickly react to geopolitical changes by\nadjusting their flexible operations to targets of operational\ninterest to Tehran.\n\n##### APT 42 Targeting\n\nTargeted Industries\n\nCivil society and non-profits\n\nEducation\n\nGovernments\n\nHealthcare\n\nLegal and professional services\n\nManufacturing\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\n**FIGURE 2. Countries and industries targeted directly by APT42.**\n\n\nAPT42 has targeted the following sectors:\n\n- Civil society and nonprofits\n\n- Education\n\n- Governments\n\n- Healthcare\n\n- Legal and professional services\n\n- Manufacturing\n\n- Media and entertainment\n\n- Pharmaceuticals\n\nAPT42 has targeted organizations in at least 14 countries since\nour first observation of its activity in 2015, including in Australia,\nEurope, the Middle East and the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cyber Espionage Operations\n\nAPT42 operations are consistent with Iran’s strategic priorities\nand reflect an operational mandate to collect information on\nindividuals and organizations of interest to the Iranian\ngovernment or deemed to pose a threat to the regime. The group’s\nactivity focuses on social engineering and exhibits patience and\nresource-intensive efforts to craft targeted decoy content and\nbuild rapport with targets before providing a credential harvesting\nlink or malicious attachment.\n\n##### Credential Harvesting Activity\n\nAPT42 has consistently targeted Western think tanks and\nacademics, media organizations, members of the Iranian\ndiaspora in the United Kingdom, Israel, the United States and\nhigh-profile Iranian individuals within Iran in efforts to collect\ncredentials of individuals of interest to the Iranian government.\nSome credential harvesting efforts have also included\ncomponents designed to steal MFA codes.\n\n**FIGURE 3. APT42 fake Google Books page.**\n\n\n**Personal Email Targeting**\n\nAPT42 has consistently targeted the personal email accounts and\nMFA codes of individuals of interest to the Iranian government.\n\n- In May 2017, APT42 targeted the senior leadership of an Iranian\n\nopposition group operating from Europe and North America\nwith spear-phishing emails mimicking legitimate Google\ncorrespondence. The emails contained links to fake Google\nBooks pages which redirected to sign-in pages designed to\nsteal credentials and two-factor authentication codes.\n\n\n-----\n\n- In April 2018, APT42 targeted the Google Gmail account of an Iranian environmental activist with a fake login page. The individual had\n\npreviously been arrested by the Iranian government which cracked down on environmental activism in early 2018.\n\n**FIGURE 4. Gmail login page personalized for a redacted victim (left), spoofed two-factor authentication (right).**\n\n- In October 2019, APT42 attempted to steal the personal Gmail credentials of an Iranian lecturer and newspaper editor in Israel.\n\n- In February 2021, APT42 targeted the personal email credentials of a senior Israeli government official with a credential harvesting\n\npage mimicking the Gmail login page.\n\n**FIGURE 5. Pre-filled login form for credential harvesting.**\n\n- In June 2020, APT42 sent a spear-phishing email to an employee of a U.S.-based non-profit organization who had previously published\n\non the condition of Iran’s civil society.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Impersonation and Building Trust**\n\nAPT42 often attempts to build rapport with their target by\nimpersonating journalists or researchers and engaging the\ntarget in benign conversation for multiple days or weeks before\nsending a malicious link. In some cases, the group uses\ncompromised email accounts in follow-on operations targeting\ncolleagues, acquaintances or relatives of the initial victim.\n\n- APT42 used a compromised email account belonging to a U.S.\nbased think tank employee to target Middle East researchers\nat other think tanks and academic organizations, U.S.\ngovernment officials involved in Middle East and Iran policy, a\nformer Iranian government official, and high-ranking members\nof an Iranian opposition group between March and June 2021.\n\n– The actor posed as a well-known journalist from a U.S. media\n\norganization requesting an interview and engaged the initial\ntarget for 37 days to gain their trust before finally directing\nthem to a credential harvesting page. In other instances,\nAPT42 provided a Dropbox link to a PDF with an embedded\nURL shortening link that led to a credential harvesting page\n(shown in Figure 6).\n\n**FIGURE 6. PDF document with embedded link to credential harvesting page.**\n\n\n– After sending an email from the compromised inbox, APT42\n\nattempted to cover their tracks by deleting the message\nfrom the victim’s Sent folder.\n\n– APT42 also attempted to access the personal email accounts\n\nof their targets, taking careful steps to avoid detection.\n\n– APT42 was able to bypass multi-factor authentication by\n\ncapturing SMS-based one-time passwords and successfully\nsetting up two-factor verification using the Microsoft\nAuthenticator application.\n\n– Once inside one victim organization, APT42 accessed files\n\nrelating to Iran through their M365 environment.\n\n– The group authenticated to the compromised accounts\n\nusing an Outlook client, suggesting existing mail items may\nhave been synchronized with the attacker's host.\n\n\n-----\n\n- APT42 impersonated a legitimate British news organization to obtain the personal email credentials of political science professors\n\nwith ties to local governments or with relatives holding dual citizenship with Iran in February 2022. The group invited its targets,\nlocated in Belgium and the United Arab Emirates, to an online interview via a customized PDF document containing an embedded link\nleading to a Gmail credential harvesting page.\n\n**FIGURE 7. PDF with interview invitation.**\n\n\n\n- In the weeks ahead of Iran’s June 18, 2021, presidential\n\nelection, APT42 used a compromised email address belonging\nto an Iran researcher at a U.S. think tank to spear phish\na member of an Iranian opposition group headquartered\nin Europe in a probable attempt to gain access to the\norganization and its other members. The group impersonated\nthe researcher and invited the target to review and provide\nfeedback on one of the researcher’s articles on Iranian nuclear\nissues in a likely effort to build trust with the target before\nengaging in further conversation.\n\n\n\n- Between March and June 2020, APT42 targeted high-profile\n\nindividuals in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry in what may\nhave been a temporary shift to support Iranian public health\npriorities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. APT42 attempted to\nsteal personal email credentials with credential harvesting\nforms masquerading as popular email services such as Gmail\nand Yahoo and impersonated a legitimate vaccinologist at the\nUniversity of Oxford, claiming to have identified an information\nleakage from the targeted organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 8. APT42 impersonates University of Oxford vaccinologist.**\n\n**FIGURE 9. APT42 Credential harvesting page masquerading as a Yahoo login portal.**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Surveillance Operations\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that APT42 conducts\nsurveillance and monitoring operations against individuals of\ninterest to the Iranian government. In addition to credential\nharvesting activity, the group uses mobile malware to target\nindividuals of interest, including those with connections to the\nGreen Movement in Iran and other political targets. Mandiant\nobserved APT42 target individuals who claimed to be able to\nprovide tools to bypass government restrictions such as those\nimposed on Telegram.\n\n- APT42 likely delivers its Android malware such as VINETHORN\n\nand PINEFLOWER via text messages.\n\n**FIGURE 10. VINETHORN malicious Android application.**\n\n\n\n- Between July 2020 and March 2021, the group successfully\n\nused PINEFLOWER Android malware to compromise several\ndozen Android devices we believe belong to individuals\nresiding in Iran.\n\n– APT42 exfiltrated recorded phone calls, room audio\n\nrecordings, images and entire SMS inboxes from at least 10\ncompromised devices, often daily.\n\n– APT42 used earlier versions of PINEFLOWER as early as 2015.\n\n- APT42 infrastructure served as command and control for\n\na VINETHORN payload masquerading as a legitimate VPN\napplication between April and October 2021.\n\n- Mandiant most recently observed APT42 PINEFLOWER activity\n\ntargeting Iran-based individuals with ties to universities,\nreformist political groups, and human rights activists between\nJune and August 2022.\n\n\n\n- In early July 2021, APT42 hosted malicious webpages masquerading as an adult content website and a free audio/video calling and instant\n\nmessenger software. The landing pages profiled visitors to the page, requested the user to turn on location services, and sent the data\nback to a hard-coded Telegram chat. In one instance, the page supported formatting for mobile devices and displayed requests to the\nuser in Arabic, suggesting Arabic speakers may have been targeted. Iran saw significant protests in July 2021, including in the Khuzestan\nregion, which is home to Iran’s Arab minority.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 11. APT42 domain masquerades as legitimate messaging platform.**\n\nThe use of Android malware to target individuals of interest to\nthe Iranian government provides APT42 with a productive\nmethod of obtaining sensitive information on targets, including\nmovement, contacts and personal information. The group’s\nproven ability to record phone calls, activate the microphone\nand record the audio, exfiltrate images and take pictures on\ncommand, read SMS messages and track the victim's GPS\nlocation in real time poses a real-world risk to individual victims\nof this campaign.\n\n**FIGURE 12. Banner response (left) versus de-obfuscated PowerShell code (right).**\n\n\n##### Malware Operations\n\nWhile APT42 focuses on credential harvesting rather than\ndeploying malware on a system, several custom backdoors and\nlightweight tools complement its arsenal. Since 2020, APT42 has\nprimarily relied on lightweight toehold backdoors over fully\nfunctional modular tools. Mandiant assesses that APT42 has\nlimited in-house malware development resources because\nrecent malware families such as TABBYCAT and VBREVSHELL\nhave included or largely consisted of publicly available code\ncopied from GitHub projects.\n\n- In September 2021, APT42 used a compromised European\n\ngovernment email account to send a phishing email to almost\n150 email addresses associated with individuals or entities\nemployed by or affiliated with civil society, government or\nintergovernmental organizations around the world. The email\nused lure content pertaining the organizational chart of an\nembassy in Tehran and contained a Google Drive link to a\nmalicious macro document leading to TAMECAT, a PowerShell\ntoehold backdoor.\n\n- In January and February 2022, APT42 hosted several\n\nmalicious Office documents on an Amazon Web Service\ninstance, Google Drive and Dropbox. Likely delivered via a\nlink sent in a spear-phishing email, the malicious documents\nused geopolitically themed decoy content and fetched\na password-protected remote template document via\nMicrosoft OneDrive links. These documents led to TABBYCAT\nand VBREVSHELL malware, which are a VBA-based dropper\nand reverse shell macro, respectively.\n\n- APT42 infrastructure hosted malicious PowerShell code\n\nin the banners of odd ports in early March 2022. The code,\nwhen run, retrieved additional PowerShell payloads including\nPOWERPOST, a custom reconnaissance tool that can collect\ndata on a local host, including system information and local\naccount names.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Attribution\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that APT42 conducts\ncyber espionage operations on behalf of the Iranian government\nbased on years of activity targeting unique, high-priority targets\nboth inside and outside of Iran. Both Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security have the\nmandate to conduct cyber espionage operations against the\ndomestic populace and foreign targets of strategic intelligence\nvalue. However, we estimate with moderate confidence that\nAPT42 operates on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard\nCorps’ Intelligence Organization based on targeting patterns\nthat align with the organization’s operational mandates and\npriorities, which includes defending the regime against internal\nand external threats, pursuing perceived domestic enemies,\nand confronting “revolutionary” ideas emanating from the West.\n#### Historical Connections\n to APT35\n\nAPT42 generally corresponds with activity other organizations\nhave referred to as TA453 (Proofpoint), Yellow Garuda (PwC), and\nITG18 (IBM). The group is also consistent with a sub-section of\npublicly reported threat clusters: Phosphorus (Microsoft) and\nCharming Kitten (ClearSky and CERTFA). Similarity in malicious\ncyber operations between various Iranian groups and a dynamic\ninstitutional ecosystem in Iran contributed to significant\nconflation of historical APT42 and APT35 activity.\n\nMandiant assesses with moderate confidence that both APT35\nand APT42 operate on behalf of the IRGC but originate from\ndifferent missions and contracts or contractors based on\nsubstantial differences in their respective targeting patterns\nand tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\n- Historical APT35 operations focused on long-term,\n\nresource intensive operations targeting the U.S. and\nMiddle Eastern military, diplomatic, and government\npersonnel, organizations in the media, energy, and defense\nindustrial base, and engineering, business services, and\ntelecommunications sectors.\n\n- In contrast, APT42 operations focus on individuals\n\nand organizations of interest to the Iranian government\nfor domestic politics, foreign policy, and regime\nstability purposes.\n\n- While both APT42 and APT35 have used MAGICDROP and\n\nBROKEYOLK malware, Mandiant observed no similarities\nbetween the respective C2 infrastructure or how the groups\noperationalized the malware.\n\n- The IRGC frequently relies on contractors to execute different\n\ncyber operations mission sets (such as U.S. Treasury\nDepartment sanctions against Net Peygard Samavat).\n\n\n#### Potential Ties Between APT42 and Ransomware Activity\n\nMandiant further highlights open-source reporting from\nMicrosoft claiming a connection between intrusion activity\nclusters that generally align with APT42 and UNC2448, an\nIran-nexus threat actor known for widespread scanning for\nvarious vulnerabilities, the use of the Fast Reverse Proxy tool,\nand reported ransomware activity using BitLocker. Notably,\nMandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42\nand UNC2448.\n\n[• In November 2021, Microsoft reported that “Phosphorus”](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/)\n\nhad targeted Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN and unpatched\non-premises Exchange servers globally with the intent of\ndeploying ransomware such as BitLocker on vulnerable\nnetworks, aligning with activity we track as UNC2448.\n[Previous reporting on Phosphorus generally aligned with](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/)\nAPT42’s credential harvesting and spear-phishing operations.\n\nWhile Mandiant has not observed technical overlaps between\nAPT42 and UNC2448, the latter may also have ties to the IRGC-IO.\nWe assess with moderate confidence that UNC2448 and the\nRevengers Telegram persona are operated by at least two\nIranian front companies, Najee Technology and Afkar System,\nbased on open-source information and operational security\nlapses by the threat actors. Public leaking campaigns from the\nLab Dookhtegan Telegram account further allege these\ncompanies are responsible for threat activity aligned with\nUNC2448 and operate on behalf of the IRGC-IO.\n\n- Mandiant identified links between UNC2448, the Revengers\n\npersona, an individual named Ahmad Khatibi, and a likely\nIranian front company named Afkar System.\n\n- The Revengers persona had offered data and access to\n\nprimarily Israeli companies for sale on its Telegram channel\nbetween February and September 2021.\n\n- Additionally, infrastructure overlaps likely caused by human\n\nerror indicate that UNC2448 has connections to a second front\ncompany, Najee Technology.\n\n- Public posts by the Lab Dookhtegan Telegram channel in July\n\n2022 claim Afkar System and Najee Technology are front\ncompanies conducting cyber operations on behalf of the\nIRGC’s Intelligence Organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook and Implications\n\nAPT42 has consistently targeted the personal email credentials,\nMulti-factor authentication codes and mobile device location\nand communication data of individuals of interest to the Iranian\ngovernment. They can use this access to enable follow-on\ncompromises of corporate networks such as those of Western\nthink tanks, academics, media organizations, biomedical\nresearch and pharmaceutical companies and governments.\nThe group’s surveillance activity highlights the real-world risk to\nindividual targets of APT42 operations, which include Iranian\ndual-nationals, former government officials and dissidents both\ninside Iran and those who previously left the country, often out\nof fear for their personal safety.\n\n\nWe do not anticipate significant changes to APT42’s operational\ntactics and mandate given the long history of activity and\nimperviousness to infrastructure take downs and a media\nspotlight on operational security failures. Nevertheless, the\ngroup has displayed its ability to rapidly alter its operational\nfocus as Iran’s priorities change over time with evolving\ndomestic and geopolitical conditions. We assess with high\nconfidence that APT42 will continue to perform cyber espionage\nand surveillance operations aligned with evolving Iranian\noperational intelligence collection requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Technical Annex: Attack Lifecycle\n\n                                   - CHAIRSMACK\n\n                                  - GHAMBAR\n\n                                   - PINEFLOWER\n\n                                    - VINETHORN\n\n                                            - Adding alternate email address\nto accounts\n\n                                               - Deleting login notification emails\n\n                                             - Deleting sent emails\n\n                                            - Registering Microsoft\nAuthenticator application\n\n                                          - Scheduled tasks\n\n                                          - Windows Registry modifications\n\n**MAINTAIN PRESENCE**\n\n**INITIAL COMPROMISE** **ESTABLISH FOOTHOLD**\n\n\n**COMPLETE MISSION**\n\n\n\n - Byoassing MFA\n\n - Credential theft\n\n - Credential harvesting forms\n\n - Patient social engineering\n\n - SMS messages for Android malware\n\n - Spear phishing\n\n**FIGURE 13. APT42 Attack Lifecycle.**\n\n##### Initial Compromise\n\n\n\n- BROKEYOLK\n\n- CHAIRSMACK\n\n- GHAMBAR\n\n- MAGICDROP\n\n- PINEFLOWER\n\n- POWERPOST\n\n- TABBYCAT\n\n- TAMECAT\n\n- VBREVSHELL\n\n- VINETHORN\n\n- Registering Microsoft\nAuthenticator application\n\n\nAPT42 primarily relies on spear phishing to perform an initial\ncompromise. The group is patient and creative in their social\nengineering efforts, often engaging their target for days or\nweeks to build trust before providing a link to a credential\nharvesting page or attaching a malicious attachment to their\ncorrespondence. APT42 is capable of bypassing MFA and\nintercepting SMS-based one-time passwords using credential\nharvesting forms and likely delivers Android malware via\nSMS messages.\n\n- APT42 frequently impersonates well-known journalists or\n\npublic figures ostensibly requesting interviews with their\ntargets. In one instance, APT42 conversed with their target\nfor 37 days before sending them a URL shortening link that\nredirected to a credential harvesting page.\n\n- APT42 sends spear phishing emails containing a PDF\n\ndocument attachment or links to Google Drive or Dropboxhosted PDF documents with an embedded link to a credential\nharvesting page.\n\n- The group is capable of intercepting MFA authentication codes\n\nvia credential harvesting forms.\n\n\n\n                                 - Credential theft\n\n                                - Obtaining files from victim Sharepoint\n\n       - POWERPOST        - Personal data theft\n\n       - GHAMBAR        - Phishing additional victims\n\n         - Browsing victom’s contacts from compromised account\n\n         - Synchronizing mail items\n\n         - Taking screenshots\n\n##### Establish Foothold\n\nOnce successfully authenticated to a victim’s personal or\ncorporate email account, APT42 registers their own Microsoft\nAuthenticator application as a new MFA method. environments,\nAPT42 uses a variety of primarily lightweight malware, some of\nwhich are based on publicly available scripts. Examples include:\n\n- BROKEYOLK\n\n- CHAIRSMACK\n\n- GHAMBAR\n\n- MAGICDROP\n\n- POWERPOST\n\n- PINEFLOWER\n\n- TABBYCAT\n\n- TAMECAT\n\n- VBREVSHELL\n\n- VINETHORN\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Escalate Privileges\n\nAPT42 uses custom malware capable of logging keystrokes and\nstealing logins and cookie data for common browsers to perform\nprivilege escalation in a victim environment. Examples include:\n\n- CHAIRSMACK\n\n- DOSTEALER\n\n- GHAMBAR\n\n##### Internal Reconnaissance\n\nAfter logging in to the target environment with stolen\ncredentials, APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance by\nbrowsing the compromised user’s contacts and accessing the\ntargeted organization’s collaborative spaces, such as\nSharepoint. The group also logs in to compromised accounts\nwith a Microsoft Outlook client, which can lead the existing mail\nitems from affected users to be synchronized with the attacker’s\nhost. This access can be used to spear phish additional targets\nwith legitimate, stolen content from the compromised\norganization or pre-existing email conversations.\n\nAPT42 also uses malware capable of taking screenshots and\ncollecting system and network information, including:\n\n- GHAMBAR\n\n- POWERPOST\n\n##### Lateral Movement\n\nTo move laterally, APT42 often attempts to use the compromised\npersonal email account of the victim to access other the victim’s\ncorporate accounts, and vice versa. The group sends spearphishing emails from compromised email accounts to additional\ntargets both internal and external to the targeted organization.\n\n- In April 2021, APT42 used a compromised corporate email\n\naccount of an employee at a U.S.-based think tank to access\nthe individual’s personal email account. The corporate\naccount, configured as a recovery email, received login\nverification codes from the personal email provider, which\nAPT42 deleted to cover their tracks.\n\n- On multiple occasions, APT42 used their victim’s trusted\n\nrelationships with their contacts to send additional spearphishing emails to follow-on targets, including coworkers,\nindustry peers and relatives.\n\n\n##### Maintain Presence\n\nTo maintain their presence in a victim’s environment, APT42\nrelies on custom malware using scheduled tasks or Windows\nregistry modifications for persistence, including:\n\n- CHAIRSMACK\n\n- GHAMBAR\n\nAdditionally, APT42 uses various techniques to maintain access\nto a victim’s personal or corporate email account, including\nregistering their Microsoft Authenticator application to receive\nMFA codes to their own devices. When APT42 sends spearphishing emails from a compromised account or attempts to\nmove laterally to a different account, the group deletes login\nnotification emails and clears the messages from the Sent folder\nto cover their tracks.\n\n##### Complete Mission\n\nMandiant assesses that APT42’s objective is two-fold:\n\n- APT42 seeks to steal credentials to personal and corporate\n\nemail accounts and use those credentials to conduct followon operations and steal personal or business documents and\nresearch pertinent to Iran.\n\n- APT42 seeks to track the locations, monitor the phone and\n\nemail communications and generally surveil the activities of\nindividuals of interest to the Iranian government, including\nactivists and dissidents inside Iran.\n\nWe have no evidence to suggest APT42 hands harvested\ncredentials to other threat actors for follow-on operations at\nthis time.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix 1.

Malware used by APT|T42.|\n|---|---|\n|Malware|Description|\n|BROKEYOLK|BROKEYOLK is a .NET downloader that downloads and executes a file from a hard-coded command and control (C2) server. The malware communicates via SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests using HTTP.|\n|CHAIRSMACK|CHAIRSMACK is a backdoor written in C++ that communicates using HTTP. CHAIRSMACK's core functionality involves expanding its capabilities by retrieving plugins from a C2 server. Downloaded plugins are cached on disk for future use. Capabilities added via plugins are inferred based on supported backdoor command names. These capabilities include shell command execution, screenshot capture, audio capture, keylogging, file transfer, and file execution.|\n|DOSTEALER|DOSTEALER is a dataminer that mines browser login and cookie data. It is also capable of taking screenshots and logging keystrokes.|\n|GHAMBAR|GHAMBAR is a remote administration tool (RAT) that communicates with its C2 server using SOAP requests over HTTP. Its capabilities include filesystem manipulation, file upload and download, shell command execution, keylogging, screen capture, clipboard monitoring, and additional plugin execution.|\n|MAGICDROP|MAGICDROP is a dropper written in C++. It decrypts files from its .data section and writes them to disk in the system's %TEMP% directory. The files dropped often include a decoy file, a next-stage payload, and sometimes an installer for the payload.|\n|PINEFLOWER|PINEFLOWER is an Android malware family capable of a wide range of backdoor functionality, including stealing system inform information, logging and recording phone calls, initiating audio recordings, reading SMS inboxes and sending SMS messages. The malware also has features to facilitate device location tracking, deleting, downloading, and uploading files, reading connectivity state, speed, and activity, and toggling Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and mobile data settings.|\n|POWERPOST|POWERPOST is a reconnaissance tool written in PowerShell that can collect data on a local host including system information and user account names. POWERPOST writes the data to disk and then sends the collected data to a hardcoded remote server via HTTP POSTs.|\n|SILENTUPLOADER|SILENTUPLOADER is an uploader written in MSIL that is dropped by DOSTEALER and is designed to work specifically in tandem with it. It checks for files in a specified folder every 30 seconds and uploads them to a remote server.|\n|TABBYCAT|TABBYCAT is a Microsoft Word VBA macro that functions as a dropper. It relies on social engineering in order to be executed as a macro within a decoy Microsoft Word document. It decodes a payload embedded in a UserForm and launches it. TABBYCAT has been observed dropping the VBREVSHELL backdoor.|\n|TAMECAT|TAMECAT is a PowerShell toehold that can execute arbitrary PowerShell or C# content. TAMECAT has been observed dropped by malicious macro documents, communicates with its C2 node via HTTP, and expects data from the C2 to be Base64-encoded.|\n|VBREVSHELL|VBREVSHELL is a VBA macro that spawns a reverse shell relying exclusively on Windows API calls.|\n|VINETHORN|VINETHORN is an Android malware family capable of a wide range of backdoor functionality. It can steal system information, read SMS inboxes, send SMS messages, access contact lists and call histories, record audio and video, and track device location via GPS.|\n\n\n**TABLE 13.
