That Complicates US Strategy\n\n**[wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-hack-wasnt-cyberwar-us-strategy](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-hack-wasnt-cyberwar-us-strategy)**\n\nErica Borghard, Jacquelyn Schneider December 17, 2020\n\nThe list of US government agencies compromised in the SolarWinds hack continues to\n[expand, with reports of infiltrations at Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security, and](https://www.newsweek.com/suspected-russian-solarwinds-hack-compromised-homeland-security-department-1554656)\n[potentially State, Defense, and the CDC. This is a](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html) [big deal for national security: It is the](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-commerce-treasury/)\nlargest known data breach of US government information since the Office of Personnel\nManagement hack in 2014, and could give hackers a trove of inside information.\n\nThough the scope of this hack is still being determined, such an extraordinary breach begs a\nfairly obvious question: Is US cyber strategy working? The US has historically relied on, first,\na [deterrence strategy and, more recently, the idea of “defend forward” to prevent and](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf)\nrespond to malicious behavior in cyberspace. Is a failure of these strategies to blame? The\nanswer (like all things political) is complicated.\n\nFirst off, it’s important to establish what this hack was. The fact that a purportedly nation[state actor (likely Russia) was able to compromise a third party (SolarWinds) to gain access](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html)\nto an as-yet-unknown number of US government networks and exfiltrate data is a significant\nespionage achievement. And it illustrates how third-party vendors can provide an avenue for\nthreat actors to conduct espionage campaigns at a scope and scale typically not seen\noutside of cyberspace.\n\n\n-----\n\n[But to call this incident a cyberattack would be off the mark. At this point, the operation](https://twitter.com/RidT/status/1338579529116381185)\nappears to have been espionage to steal national security information, rather than to disrupt,\ndeny, or degrade US government data or networks. While it may seem like splitting hairs,\nterminology is important because it has policy, and often legal, consequences. Espionage is\nan accepted part of international statecraft, one that states often respond to with arrests,\ndiplomacy, or counterintelligence. In contrast, an attack (even a cyberattack) has\n[international and domestic legal ramifications that could allow states to respond with force.](https://ccdcoe.org/research/tallinn-manual/)\nSo far at least, this hack is not that.\n\nThe question of what this incident means for cyber deterrence, on the other hand, is less\nstraightforward. To understand why this is a complicated question, it's helpful to understand\nhow this strategy works (and doesn’t). Deterrence is about convincing an adversary not to do\nsomething by threatening punishment or making it seem unlikely the operation will succeed.\nThis is a hard thing to do for a few reasons. First, states need to threaten a response that is\nboth scary and believable. A threat may not be credible because the state lacks the\ncapabilities to carry it out. Or, as is more often the case with the United States, threats may\nlack credibility because adversaries don’t believe there will be follow-through. For instance,\nthe US might threaten to use nuclear weapons in response to cyber espionage, but no state\nwould believe the US would actually launch a nuclear attack in response to a data breach.\nIt’s just not a credible threat.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, it's also hard to tell when deterrence has actually\nworked because, if it does, nothing happens. So even if a state was deterred by a good\ndefense, it's almost impossible to know whether the state didn’t follow through with the attack\nsimply because it wasn’t interested in taking the action in the first place.\n\nThere are few if any, deterrence mechanisms that work to prevent cyber espionage. Because\nstates routinely spy on one another—friends and foes alike—there are a very limited number\nof credible punishments states can use to threaten others into not spying. The US has tried\n[using a handful of options for cyber deterrence, such as issuing warrants for state-sponsored](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n[hackers or threatening sanctions for cyber intelligence. But these have had limited success.](https://www.state.gov/cyber-sanctions/)\n[This does not mean, however, we should throw out the deterrence baby with the bathwater.](https://www.lawfareblog.com/layered-cyber-deterrence-strategy-securing-connectivity-21st-century)\nAs [Jon Lindsay, a professor at University of Toronto, points out, the success of deterrence](https://twitter.com/jonrlindsay/status/1338961551965896704)\noutside of cyberspace can incentivize and shape state behavior within cyberspace. And,\nthere is compelling evidence that deterrence can work in cyberspace. No adversary has ever\nconducted a cyberattack against the United States that created violence or sustained,\nsignificant effects on infrastructure or military capabilities. Arguably, this is because the US’s\nlarge and lethal conventional military force is a credible deterrent at higher cyber thresholds.\nThe more vexing strategic challenge for the US is in the space between national security\nespionage (where deterrence doesn’t quite apply) and major cyberattacks (where deterrence\nseems to hold).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn terms of the SolarWinds incident, the deterrence game is not yet over. The breach is still\nongoing, and the ultimate end game is still unknown. Information gleaned from the breach\ncould be used for other detrimental foreign policy objectives outside of cyberspace, or the\nthreat actor could exploit its access to US government networks to engage in follow-on\ndisruptive or destructive actions (in other words, conduct a cyberattack).\n\nBut what about the Department of Defense’s new defend forward strategy, which was meant\nto fill in the gap where traditional deterrence mechanisms might not work? Some view this\n[latest incident as a defend-forward failure because the Defense Department seemingly did](https://www.lawfareblog.com/solarwinds-breach-why-your-work-computers-are-down-today)\nnot manage to stop this hack before it occurred. Introduced in the 2018 Defense Department\n[Cyber Strategy, this strategy aims to “disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source.”](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF)\nThis represented a change in how the Defense Department conceptualized operating in\ncyberspace, going beyond maneuvering in networks it owns, to operating in those that others\n[may control. There has been some](https://www.cfr.org/blog/implications-defending-forward-new-pentagon-cyber-strategy) [controversy about this posture. In part, this may be](https://watermark.silverchair.com/tyz008.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArQwggKwBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKhMIICnQIBADCCApYGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMnt3DdHtb-PZbdBeaAgEQgIICZ9R0SOJZUJZsFh1XH4CTWMqkhZok56DCsj0dNEHpc2URHC94MIMlUYT7bmOMazmOWaiT9UZFG9rMT3MBEChp-n3iE4deeLvS186TTvOveW_YfpvC7q1FLUadC47-MCKX2-8G_SvzpH5czYnULOd_9wsNEfqZF6YICdaRL9iFJvxcP5oEdEyshCIIlFXh5eGGg9dRZ6fmAO0BG8WZGzqNdb-d_Up1Ac-WXt91CWLT7LqXxcAk36GdPFDKVhgWb5vE3-pBflHXo1y4TKJE2gtMaX3CnmilJBoAooVyw4vkm7EOYRrxNCNMAMF2jQauiZhTbFP0FeKS2RtNZa8-UP64bttEXprKnE1b49AbEP5O57DRMw0y2r0e3E86T76BiwOndlSay7RuLlp49omWRm4kC3dEvYFmpNQZF32yVimfKQGq4euoUth_-tcyJRCeX2kWzh3O8iD1jfaE1IVN0jutFSiV-AGJInlobQ2Shpl32bFg1y1fBFtv_TTrN10SxK9KC8_zVebdVHYvctAlvkUw-NQjnFMYXD5YrEPOXZEsUjowjxaEvRiB0yPksFynnVN_2_F67AGSqDrJeBvKHW43MKNIc09ZxCQU8AePSAnp1O2YnTv6ClFKGiqZV4d7rQTvjWTpMOoM_DLRIdMafUxMtenrlb6rdMsgFfZh8fs7Ba4ikKm_lei8jY9eD30myQ3nLApygsmBjo_plBIjUnxk8qt6c8M5_fmonMBMzqUur_79SPJBKTCP4aXpX9reZpBQ8K_d-Z7euUJeQryqK9iVaI_i5Iytfw0ZqTQpopprQXcDRwybPvv63Q)\n[because defend forward has been described in many](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bolton-says-u-s-is-expanding-offensive-cyber-operations-11560266199) [different ways, making it hard to](https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110592/witnesses/HHRG-116-AS26-Wstate-NakasoneP-20200304.pdf)\nunderstand what the concept actually means and the conditions under which it is meant to\napply.\n\nHere’s our [take on defend forward, which we see as two types of activities: The first is](https://www.lawfareblog.com/operationalizing-defend-forward-how-concept-works-change-adversary-behavior)\ninformation gathering and sharing with allies, partner agencies, and critical infrastructure by\n[maneuvering in networks where adversaries operate. These activities create more robust](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2078716/dod-has-enduring-role-in-election-defense/)\n[defense mechanisms, but largely leave the adversary alone. The second includes countering](https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-cyber-commands-malware-inoculation-linking-offense-and-defense-cyberspace)\nadversary offensive cyber capabilities and infrastructure within the adversaries’ own\nnetworks. In other words, launching cyberattacks against adversary hacking groups—like\n[threat actors associated with the Russian government. It isn’t clear how much of this second](https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/what-a-u-s-operation-against-russian-trolls-predicts-about-escalation-in-cyberspace/)\ncategory the Defense Department has been doing, but the SolarWinds incident suggests the\nUS could be doing more.\n\nHow should the US cyber strategy adapt after SolarWinds? Deterrence may be an ineffective\nstrategy for preventing espionage, but other options remain. To decrease the scope and\n[severity of these intelligence breaches, the US must improve its defenses, conduct](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-hack-supply-chain-reckoning/)\ncounterintelligence operations, and also conduct counter-cyber operations to degrade the\ncapabilities and infrastructure that enable adversaries to conduct espionage. That’s where\ndefend forward could be used more effectively.\n\nThis doesn’t mean deterrence is completely dead. Instead, the US should continue to build\nand rely on strategic deterrence to convince states not to weaponize the cyber intelligence\nthey collect. That effort could start with better signaling that the US is serious about these\n[responding to significant cyberattacks, including a frank conversation with Russian President](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-obama-said-putin-red-phone-about-election-hack-n697116)\nVladimir Putin, reminding him that while he may have scored an intelligence coup in\nSolarWinds, Russia is still overmatched in economic and military power by the US.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SolarWinds incident reveals an important truth about our cyber strategy: The US should\nfocus less on convincing adversaries not to conduct intelligence, and focus more on making\nthese efforts less successful. This means investing more in defense and information sharing,\nbut it also means making it more difficult for threat actors, like those affiliated with Russia or\nChina, to conduct both cyber espionage and cyberattacks by “defending forward” to degrade\nthese countries’ offensive cyber capabilities.\n\nWIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of\n_[viewpoints.
