Called \"initial access brokers,\" these\ngroups operate as the supply chain of the criminal underground, providing ransomware gangs (and others) with access to large collections of\ncompromised systems.\n\nConsisting of hacked RDP endpoints, backdoored networking devices, and malware-infected computers, these systems allow ransomware\ngangs to easily gain access to corporate networks, escalate their access, and encrypt files to demand huge ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\nese t a access b o e s a e a c uc a pa t o t e cybe c e sce e oday, t ee types o b o e s sta d out as t e sou ces o ost\nransomware attacks:\n\n**Sellers of compromised RDP endpoints: Cybercrime gangs are currently carrying out brute-force attacks against workstations or**\nservers configured for remote RDP access that have also been left exposed on the internet with weak credentials. These systems are\nlater sold on so-called \"RDP shops\" from where ransomware gangs often select systems they believe might be located inside the\nnetwork of a high-value target.\n**Sellers of hacked networking devices: Cybercrime gangs are also using exploits for publicly known vulnerabilities to take control of a**\ncompany's networking equipment, such as VPN servers, firewalls, or other edge devices. Access to these devices and the internal\nnetworks they protect/connect is sold on hacking forums or to ransomware gangs directly.\n**Sellers of computers already infected with malware: Many of today's malware botnets will often comb through the computers they**\ninfect for systems on corporate networks and then sell access to these high-value systems to other cybercrime operations, including\nransomware gangs.\n\nProtecting against these three types of initial access vectors is often the easiest way of avoiding ransomware.\n\nHowever, while safeguarding against the first two typically involves practicing good password policies and keeping equipment updated, the\nthird vector is harder to protect against.\n\nThis is because malware botnet operators often rely on social engineering to trick users into installing malware on their systems themselves,\neven if computers are running up-to-date software.\n\nThis article focuses on the known malware strains that have been used over the past two years to install ransomware.\n\n[Compiled with the help of security researchers from Advanced Intelligence,](https://www.advanced-intel.com/) [Binary Defense, and](https://www.binarydefense.com/) [Sophos, the list below should serve as a](https://www.sophos.com/)\n\"code red\" moment for any organization.\n\n**Once any of these malware strains are detected, system administrators should drop everything, take systems offline, and audit and**\n**remove the malware as a top priority.**\n\n_ZDNet will keep the list up to date going forward._\n\n\n-----\n\nr emotet.png\n\n\n[Emotet is considered today's biggest malware botnet.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet)\n\nThere are few cases where Emotet has dealt with ransomware gangs directly, but many ransomware infections have been traced back to initial\nEmotet infections.\n\nUsually, Emotet sold access to its infected systems to other malware gangs, which later sold their own access to ransomware gangs.\n\nToday, the most common ransomware infection chain linked back to Emotet is: Emotet—Trickbot—Ryuk\n\n\n-----\n\nr trickbot.png\n\n\n[Trickbot is a malware botnet and cybercrime similar to Emotet.
