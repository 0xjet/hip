SideCopy has been active since 2019, primarily targeting](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/sidecopy)\nSouth Asian countries, with a focus on India and Afghanistan. The group's name comes from\nits use of an infection chain that mimics that of SideWinder APT, an Indian-linked threat\ngroup.\n\n_The distinction between SideWinder and SideCopy was first made by security researcher_\n_[@Sebdraven and is documented here.](https://twitter.com/Sebdraven)_\n\n\n-----\n\nSome reports suggest that SideCopy may be a subdivision of Transparent Tribe (APT36),\nwith similar tactics and techniques observed.\n\nThe S2 Research Team has blogged previously on the activities of Transparent Tribe:\n\n[Transparent Tribe APT Infrastructure Mapping - Part One](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/transparent-tribe-apt-infrastructure-mapping-1)\n\n[Transparent Tribe APT Infrastructure Mapping - Part Two](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/transparent-tribe-apt-infrastructure-mapping)\n\nIn this post we share the discoveries of our S2 Threat Research Team after examining\n[analysis by the Chinese cyber security company QiAnXin, published on 20 March 2023,](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/Analysis-of-SideCopy-Group%27s-Recent-Attacks-Using-Indian-Ministry-of-Defense-Documents-as-Lures-EN/)\nwhich detailed a SideCopy attack chain used to deploy AllaKore RAT. [AllaKore RAT is an](https://github.com/Anderson-D/AllaKore)\nopen-source remote access tool which has been modified for the purposes of SideCopy\noperations, and is commonly observed in their intrusions.\n\n### Key Findings\n\nIdentification of additional malware samples and C2 infrastructure associated with\nSideCopy targeting of the Indian Ministry of Defense\n\nEvidence of management activity sourced from mobile IPs located in Pakistan,\ncentered around a key IP address (66.219.22.252) connected to SideCopy’s use of\nAction RAT\n\nFurther credence provided to the assessment that SideCopy is a Pakistani-linked threat\nactor group, involved state-level espionage activities\n\n### India in the Crosshairs\n\n\n-----\n\nAs discussed in the analysis by QiAnXin, spear phishing was used as the initial delivery\nmethod for this campaign. Examining the lures involved, the targets appear to be users in\nIndia, specifically in the Ministry of Defence.\n\n**Figure 1: Example PDF Lure**\n**(https://twitter.com/jaydinbas/status/1629149627848044550)**\n\nIn a bid to further understanding of this campaign, we will not seek to repeat analysis of the\ninfection chain. Instead we will focus on the two tools which were ultimately dropped,\nexamining threat telemetry surrounding their associated command and control (C2)\ninfrastructure.\n\n### DUser.dll (Action RAT)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first tool, identified as [Action RAT in analysis by Cyble, is dropped onto the victim](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/21/notorious-sidecopy-apt-group-sets-sights-on-indias-drdo/)\nmachine alongside a benign executable which is used to sideload it, in order to avoid\ndetection. Action RAT’s capabilities include the ability to receive commands from the C2\nserver, to retrieve information from the victim machine, to execute further payloads, and to\nupload information back to the C2.\n\nWe found two samples of Action RAT (loaded as DUser.dll), including the sample analyzed\nby Cyble.\n\n**Cyble Sample** **Stage 1: feeadc91373732d65883c8351a6454a77a063ff5 (DRDO - K4**\nMissile Clean room.pptx.lnk)\nC2: www.cornerstonebeverly[.]org\nAction RAT:\n3c4c8cbab1983c775e6a76166f7b3c84dde8c8c5 (DUser.dll)\nC2: 144.91.72.17:8080\n(Contabo GmbH)\n\n**Sample Two** **Stage 1: 0d68a135b1f4be18481cf44ed02bcbf82aeb542e (Cyber**\nAdvisory - Profiles (Pic and Mob No) of PIOs.docx.lnk)\nC2: www.kwalityproducts[.]com\n**Action RAT: cb031561fd76643885671922db7d5b840060334d (DUser.dll)\nC2:**\n84.46.250.78:8080 (Contabo GmbH)\n\nExamining threat telemetry for the two C2 IPs 144.91.72.17 and 84.46.250.78 we observed\ninitial victim connections on 06 February 2023 and 15 March 2023 respectively.\n\nIn total we observed 18 distinct victims, all located in India, connecting to the C2 servers highlighting the targeted nature of the campaign.\n\nFurther to this activity we also observed 37 distinct IPs (again all located in India) connecting\nto 144.91.72.17:9468 in activity which commenced on 07 January 2023. Of the 37 IPs, two\nwere observed connecting to the Action RAT port (TCP/8080).\n\nWe were unable to identify a sample talking to TCP/9468 of 144.91.72.17, however we\nwould hypothesize that this IP was used for C2 communications with another tool associated\nwith SideCopy activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Management Hints?**\n\nExamining outbound activity from 144.91.72.17 and 84.46.250.78, we observed connections\nfrom 84.46.250.78 to 66.219.22.252:82 (IMMEDION, US). Whilst 66.219.22.252 is assigned\nto an American provider, WHOIS data places it in Pakistan.\n\nFurther examining connections to 66.219.22.252:82, we observed communications sourced\nfrom 17 distinct IPs assigned to Pakistani mobile providers and four Proton VPN nodes\nduring the period of interest.\n\nAll of the Proton VPN nodes and all but three of the Pakistani mobile IPs were also observed\nconnecting to 66.219.22.252:3389 within the same time period. Port 3389 (RDP) is often\nobserved open on SideCopy (and Transparent Tribe) C2 servers, and is believed to be\nutilized for management purposes by the threat actors.\n\n_These findings are therefore indicative of management of 66.219.22.252 by actors likely_\n_located in Pakistan, in addition to actors unknown accessing via Proton VPN infrastructure._\n\nExamining the communications sourced from the Pakistani mobile IPs, to 66.219.22.252:82\nand 66.219.22.252:3389, we can start to build a general pattern of life, illustrated in Figure 2\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Pattern of Life for Management of 66.219.22.252**\n\nThe timings in Figure 2 shown above are based on UTC, which is 5 hours behind Pakistan\nStandard Time. Therefore, Figure 2 demonstrates that management of 66.219.22.252 occurs\nbetween Monday to Saturday, from roughly 10AM to 7PM - with some exceptions on\nThursdays.\n\nThese data points are potentially indicative of the threat actors accessing their infrastructure\nwithin a typical working week cadence, suggesting that management is undertaken\nprofessionally.\n\nFinally, when analyzing threat telemetry data for 66.219.22.252, we also observed inbound\nconnections to TCP/8080 and TCP/9467 sourced from IP addresses assigned to Indian\nproviders TCP/9467 is noteworthy given its similarity to the activity observed on\n\n\n-----\n\n**144.91.72.17:9468 which we assess to be indicative of SideCopy C2 communications.**\n\nThe findings in this section derived from threat telemetry data are summarized below in\nFigure 2.\n\n**Figure 3: Threat Telemetry Data Associated with the Action RAT C2s**\n\n### AllaKore RAT\n\nAccording to QiAnXin’s analysis, DUser.dll is also used to load and execute a version of\nAllaKore RAT, which is dropped on the victim machine via separate infrastructure. AllaKore\nRAT’s capabilities include functionality which allows for keylogging, screenshotting, and\n\n\n-----\n\nremote access of the victim machine, with an ability to also upload stolen information to the\nC2 server.\n\nWe found two samples of AllaKore RAT, both of which were referenced by QiAnXin.\n\n**Sample One** **Dropped via: f369ee5fc8dcf5a9e95d85dadff5a095a0e3a760 (hta.dll)**\n**C2: www.kcps[.]edu[.]in\nAllaKore RAT:**\nea844939dc428e6fdb6624d717d0286e4dcae9b1 (simsre.exe)\nC2:\n89.117.63.146:9921\n\n**Sample Two** **Dropped via: f369ee5fc8dcf5a9e95d85dadff5a095a0e3a760 (hta.dll)**\n**C2: www.kcps[.]edu[.]in\nAllaKore RAT:**\n972d85b5736ae8bdf06a9d74f2a3356829ce2095 (sicsmdb.exe)\nC2:\n185.229.119.60:9134\n\nExamining threat telemetry data for the two C2 IPs 89.117.63.146 and 185.229.119.60 we\nobserved initial victim connections on 06 January 2023 and 22 February 2023 respectively.\n\nIn total we observed 236 distinct victims, all located in India, connecting to the C2 servers.\nWhen compared to the victim numbers for the Action RAT C2s, it could be assessed that\nAllaKore RAT is deployed more widely and via other means outside of the scope of the\ninfection chain described by QiAnXin.\n\nFurther to this activity we also observed 455 distinct IPs (again all located in India)\nconnecting to 89.117.63.146:7439 and 185.229.119.60:7469 in activity which commenced at\nthe same time as the activity on the ports associated with the AllaKore RAT samples.\n\nWe were unable to identify samples talking to TCP/7439 of 89.117.63.146 and TCP/7469 of\n**185.229.119.60, however as previously we would hypothesize that this IP was used for C2**\ncommunications with another tool associated with SideCopy activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post we have sought to illustrate the following points:\n\nWe have good evidence to demonstrate this particular SideCopy campaign, highlighted\nfirst by others in the industry, was successful in targeting Indian users. This finding is\nbased on observations within our threat telemetry data, indicating victim connections to\nthe C2 servers.\n\nVictim activity predated the public reporting of this campaign, in some cases by several\nmonths. This continues to support the statistics about attacker dwell time, and\nhighlights the importance of retrospective analysis of data logs.\n\nThere is specific evidence to demonstrate that the Action RAT infrastructure, connected\nto SideCopy, is managed by users accessing the Internet from Pakistan.\n\nPivots on known threat actor infrastructure can lead to the identification of further,\npreviously unknown infrastructure, in addition to hints at attribution and management.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nWe would recommend that cyber defenders, particularly those located in countries /\nregions which SideCopy operations are known to target, use the IOCs mentioned in\nthis blog to hunt against their own data holdings (including historical logs), and to\npreemptively block malicious activity.\n\nUsers of Pure Signal Recon can examine this campaign by querying against the\ndomains and IP addresses referenced in the IOC section below. Further pivots into\nother currently unknown infrastructure may be possible as this threat actor undertakes\nfuture campaigns.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Malware Hashes (SHA1)**\n\n\n-----\n\n0d68a135b1f4be18481cf44ed02bcbf82aeb542e\n\n3c4c8cbab1983c775e6a76166f7b3c84dde8c8c5\n\n972d85b5736ae8bdf06a9d74f2a3356829ce2095\n\ncb031561fd76643885671922db7d5b840060334d\n\nea844939dc428e6fdb6624d717d0286e4dcae9b1\n\nf369ee5fc8dcf5a9e95d85dadff5a095a0e3a760\n\nf369ee5fc8dcf5a9e95d85dadff5a095a0e3a760\n\nfeeadc91373732d65883c8351a6454a77a063ff5\n\n**Domains**\n\nwww.cornerstonebeverly[.]org\n\nwww.kwalityproducts[.]com\n\nwww.kcps[.]edu[.]in\n\n**IP Addresses (with port pairings 🍷)**\n\n144.91.72.17:8080\n\n144.91.72.17:9468\n\n185.229.119.60:9134\n\n66.219.22.252:8080\n\n66.219.22.252:9467\n\n84.46.250.78:8080\n\n89.117.63.146:9921\n\n\n-----",
