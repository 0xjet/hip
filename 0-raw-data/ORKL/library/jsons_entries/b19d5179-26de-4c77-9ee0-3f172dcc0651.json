HouseCall for Home Networks is a free tool that](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/housecall/home-network.html)\nfeatures device recognition and vulnerability scanning in users' networks and connected\ndevices. Home Network Security is a solution plugged into users’ routers that protects\nconnected devices from potential cyberattacks. Our scanning can cover multiple operating\nsystems, including Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and other software development kit\n(SDK) platforms.\n\nThis blog tackles the recently ill-famed VPNFilter malware and if deployed devices are\nvulnerable to it and other vulnerabilities. VPNFilter is a newly discovered, multi-stage\n[malware (detected by Trend Micro as ELF_VPNFILT.A,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ELF_VPNFILT.A) [ELF_VPNFILT.B,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ELF_VPNFILT.B) [ELF_VPNFILT.C,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ELF_VPNFILT.C)\n[and ELF_VPNFILT.D) that affects many models of connected devices. Initially reported at the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ELF_VPNFILT.D)\ntail end of May to have infected at least 500,000 networking devices across 54 countries,\nincluding those from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Link, to steal website credentials\n[and even render devices unusable, the malware is now seen targeting more devices to](https://www.zdnet.com/article/vpnfilter-malware-now-targeting-asus-d-link-huawei-zte/)\n\n\n-----\n\ndeliver exploits and even override reboots. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has\n[even released a public service announcement (PSA), warning that it is the work of foreign](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180525.aspx)\nthreat actors looking to compromise networked devices worldwide.\n\n## Different brands and models affected by VPNFilter and more\n\nVPNFilter is known to affect over ten brands and 70 models of devices. Our IoT scanning\ntool can identify other publicly known vulnerabilities targeting the devices as listed below:\n\n**Manufacturer** **Model** **Device**\n**Type**\n\n\nAsus RT-AC66U, RT-N10, RT-N10E, RT-N10U, RT-N56U, and RTN66U\n\nD-Link DES-1210-08P DIR-300, DIR-300A, DSR-250N, DSR-500N,\nDSR-1000, and DSR-1000N\n\n\nRouters\n\nEthernet\nswitch\nRouters\n\n\nHuawei HG8245 Router\n\n\nLinksys E1200, E2500, E3000 E3200, E4200, RV082, and\nWRVS4400N\n\nMikroTik CCR1009, CCR1016, CCR1036, CCR1072, CRS109,\nCRS112, CRS125, RB411, RB450, RB750, RB911, RB921,\nRB941, RB951, RB952, RB960, RB962, RB1100, RB1200,\nRB2011, RB3011, RB Groove, RB Omnitik, and STX5\n\nNetgear DG834, DGN1000, DGN2200, DGN3500, FVS318N,\nMBRN3000, R6400, R7000, R8000, WNR1000, WNR2000,\nWNR2200, WNR4000, WNDR3700, WNDR4000, WNDR4300,\nWNDR4300-TN, and UTM50\n\nQNAP TS251, TS439 Pro, and other QNAP NAS devices running\nQTS software\n\n\nRouters\n\nRouters\n\nRouters\n\nNAS\ndevices\n\n\nTP-Link R600VPN, TL-WR741ND, and TL-WR841N Routers\n\nUbiquiti NSM2 and PBE M5 Wireless\naccess\npoints\n\nZTE ZXHN H108N Router\n\n_Table 1. Some of the known affected devices by VPNFilter_\n\nBased on our data from June 1 to July 12, plenty of the devices are still using old firmware\nversions. In fact, 19 known vulnerabilities, not only taken advantage of by VPNFilter but other\nmalware as well, can still be detected in devices up to this day.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the time of our scanning, we observed that 34 percent of home networks had at least one\ndevice with a known vulnerability. We found that 9 percent of vulnerable devices are\npotentially affected by VPNFilter.\n\n**Device Vulnerabilities** **Vulnerable Devices/Services**\n\n\nAuthentication Bypass Vulnerability CVE2015-7261\n\nReaper Remote Code Execution CVE2011-4723\n\n\nQNAP FTP Service\n\nD-Link DIR-300\n\n\nRemote Code Execution CVE-2014-9583 ASUS RT-AC66U, RT-N66U\n\n\nReaper OS Command Injection CVE2013-2678\n\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerability CVE-20130229\n\nStack Overflow Vulnerability CVE-20130230\n\n\nLinksys E2500\n\nVulnerable UPnP Service (e.g. Netgear/TPLink/D-Link)\n\nVulnerable UPnP Service (e.g. Netgear/TPLink/D-Link)\n\n\nRemote Code Execution CVE-2017-6361 QNAP QTS before 4.2.4 Build 20170313\n\nRouter JSONP Info Leak CVE-2017-8877 ASUS RT-AC* and RT-N*\n\n\nRouter Password Disclosure CVE-20175521\n\nStack Overflow Vulnerability CVE-20125958\n\nStack Overflow Vulnerability CVE-20125959\n\n\nNetgear R6400, R7000, R8000\n\nVulnerable UPnP Service (e.g. Netgear/TPLink/D-Link)\n\nVulnerable UPnP Service (e.g. Netgear/TPLink/D-Link)\n\n\nReaper Router Remote Code Execution D-Link DIR-300\n\nRouter Password Disclosure Netgear WNR2000\n\nRemote Code Execution CVE-2016-6277 Netgear R6400, R7000\n\nRouter Session Stealing CVE-2017-6549 ASUS RT-N66U\n\nOS Command Injection CVE-2013-2679 Linksys E4200\n\nAuthentication Bypass Vulnerability Netgear WNR1000\n\nRouter Password Disclosure Netgear WNR1000\n\n\nUnauthenticated Router Access\nVulnerability\n\n\nTP-Link TL-WR841N\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 2. 19 vulnerability detections on VPNFilter-affected devices_\n\nAs expected, the 19 vulnerabilities primarily affect routers. Interestingly, the Authentication\nBypass Vulnerability CVE-2015-7261, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) flaw in the QNAP NAS\nfirmware, mostly affects printers based on our detection. While determining the possible\nreason behind this, we found that many of the detected printers’ FTP could connect to the\nnetwork without any authentication. In some cases, this may be the printer’s default\nconfiguration, but it still poses a potential security risk if the FTP is set as open on the\ninternet.\n\n[Figure 1. A Shodan result of an FTP connection to a printer without authentication](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/07/shodan-ftp-printer.jpg)\n\n_Figure 1. A Shodan result of an FTP connection to a printer without authentication_\n\nThe other vulnerabilities detected, such as the Buffer Overflow [CVE-2013-0229 and Stack](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0229)\nOverflow [CVE-2013-0230, can allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0230)\nexecute arbitrary code in systems, respectively. Vulnerable UPnP Services detected,\nmoreover, aren’t exclusively associated with Netgear/TP-Link/D-Link devices, as other\nbrands could also have the same vulnerability. In that case, we can expect more detections.\n\n## Protecting devices and networks against VPNFilter malware and other vulnerabilities\n\nThe threat of VPNFilter malware is augmented by the fact that other publicly known\nvulnerabilities were detected in the affected devices. Since not all device manufacturers\nprovide immediate fixes for discovered vulnerabilities and not all users regularly apply\npatches, users should first secure the way they set up their devices and networks. Trend\nMicro™ Home Network Security solution can check internet traffic between the router and all\nconnected devices. Our IoT scanning tool has been integrated into the Home Network\n[Security solution and HouseCall™ for Home Networks scanner. Enterprises can also monitor](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/housecall/home-network.html)\nall ports and network protocols for advanced threats and thwart targeted attacks with the\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Inspector network appliance.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/advanced-threat-protection/inspector.html)\n\nAside from adopting security solutions that can protect networks and connected devices from\nthe vulnerabilities through the identification and assessment of potential risks, we\nrecommend standard security measures, such as:\n\nUpdating the firmware versions of devices once they’re available to avoid attacks that\nexploit known vulnerabilities.\nAvoiding the use of public Wi-Fi on devices that are also used in home or corporate\nnetworks.\nChanging device’s default credentials and using strong passwords to deter\nunauthorized access.\nBeing wary of suspicious URLs or attachments from unknown sources that may lead to\ninfecting devices connected to the network\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers of the [Trend Micro Home Network Security solution are also protected from particular](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/homenetworksecurity.html)\nvulnerabilities via these rules:\n\n1058981 WEB Directory Traversal -21\n1130327 EXPLOIT ASUSWRT 3.0.0.4.376_1071 LAN Backdoor Command Execution\n(CVE-2014-9583)\n\n\n-----",
