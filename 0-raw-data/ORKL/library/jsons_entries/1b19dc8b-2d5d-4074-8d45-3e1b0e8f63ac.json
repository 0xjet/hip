MSTIC assesses with](https://www.sysaid.com/security-compliance/important-update-regarding-apache-log4j)\nhigh confidence that MERCURY’s observed activity was affiliated with Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and\nSecurity (MOIS).\n\nWhile MERCURY has used Log4j 2 exploits in the past, such as on vulnerable VMware apps, we have\nnot seen this actor using SysAid apps as a vector for initial access until now. After gaining access,\nMERCURY establishes persistence, dumps credentials, and moves laterally within the targeted\norganization using both custom and well-known hacking tools, as well as built-in operating system tools\nfor its hands-on-keyboard attack.\n\nThis blog details Microsoft’s analysis of observed MERCURY activity and related tools used in targeted\nattacks. This information is shared with our customers and industry partners to improve detection of\nthese attacks, such as implementing detections against MERCURY’s tools in both Microsoft Defender\nAntivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. As with any observed nation-state actor activity,\nMicrosoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the\ninformation needed to secure their accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## MERCURY TTPs align with Iran-based nation-state actor\n\nMicrosoft assesses with moderate confidence that MERCURY exploited remote code execution\nvulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 (also referred to as “Log4Shell”) in vulnerable SysAid Server\ninstances the targets were running. MERCURY has used Log4j 2 exploits in past campaigns as well.\n\nMSTIC assesses with high confidence that MERCURY is coordinating its operations in affiliation with\n[Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). According to the US Cyber Command, MuddyWater,](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\na group we track as MERCURY, “is a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and\nSecurity.”\n\nThe following are common MERCURY techniques and tooling:\n\n**Adversary-in-the-mailbox phishing: MERCURY has a long history of spear-phishing its targets.**\nRecently, there has been an uptick in the volume of these phishing attacks. The source of the\nphishing comes from compromised mailboxes and initiating previous email conversations with\ntargets. MERCURY operators include links to or directly attach commercial remote access tools,\nsuch as ScreenConnect, in these initial phishing mails.\n**Use of cloud file-sharing services: MERCURY utilizes commercially available file-sharing**\nservices as well as self-hosting resources for delivering payloads.\n**Use of commercial remote access applications: The initial foothold on victims emerges via**\ncommercially available remote access applications. This allows MERCURY to gain elevated\nprivileges and be able to transfer files, primarily PowerShell scripts, easily over to the victim’s\nenvironment.\n**Tooling: MERCURY’s tools of choice tend to be Venom proxy tool, Ligolo reverse tunneling, and**\nhome-grown PowerShell programs.\n**Targeting: MERCURY targets a variety of Middle Eastern-geolocated organizations. Mailbox**\nvictims correlate directly with organizations that do business with the Middle Eastern victims.\n\nThis latest activity sheds light on behavior MERCURY isn’t widely known for: scanning and exploiting a\nvulnerable application on a target’s device. They have been observed performing this activity in the\npast, but it is not very common. The exploits are derived from open source and sculpted to fit their\nneeds.\n\n## Observed actor activity\n\n### Initial access\n\nOn July 23 and 25, 2022, MERCURY was observed using exploits against vulnerable SysAid Server\ninstances as its initial access vector. Based on observations from past campaigns and vulnerabilities\nfound in target environments, Microsoft assess that the exploits used were most likely related to Log4j\n2. The threat actor leveraged Log4j 2 exploits against VMware applications earlier in 2022 and likely\nlooked for similarly vulnerable internet-facing apps. SysAid, which provides IT management tools,\nmight have presented as an attractive target for its presence in the targeted country.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Observed MERCURY attack chain\nExploiting SysAid successfully enables the threat actor to drop and leverage web shells to execute\nseveral commands, as listed below. Most commands are related to reconnaissance, with one encoded\nPowerShell that downloads the actor’s tool for lateral movement and persistence.\n\n**Executed commands:**\n\ncmd.exe /C whoami\ncmd.exe /C powershell -exec bypass -w 1 -enc UwB….\ncmd.exe /C hostname\ncmd.exe /C ipconfig /all\ncmd.exe /C net user\ncmd.exe /C net localgroup administrators\ncmd.exe /C net user admin * /add\ncmd.exe /C net localgroup Administrators admin /add\ncmd.exe /C quser\n\n### Persistence\n\nOnce MERCURY has obtained access to the target organization, the threat actor establishes\npersistence using several methods, including:\n\nDropping a web shell, providing effective and continued access to the compromised device.\nAdding a user and elevating their privileges to local administrator.\nAdding the leveraged tools in the startup folders and ASEP registry keys, ensuring their\npersistence upon device reboot.\nStealing credentials.\n\nThe actor leverages the new local administrator user to connect through remote desktop protocol\n(RDP). During this session, the threat actor dumps credentials by leveraging the open-source\napplication Mimikatz. We also observed MERCURY later performing additional credential dumping in\nSQL servers to steal other high privileged accounts, like service accounts.\n\n### Lateral movement\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed MERCURY further using its foothold to compromise other devices within the target\norganizations by leveraging several methods, such as:\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to launch commands on devices within\norganizations.\nRemote services (leveraging RemCom tool) to run encoded PowerShell commands within\norganizations.\n\nMost of the commands launched are meant to install tools on targets or perform reconnaissance to find\ndomain administrator accounts.\n\n### Communication\n\nThroughout the attack, the threat actor used different methods to communicate with their commandand-control (C2) server, including:\n\nBuilt-in operating system tools such as PowerShell\nTunneling tool called vpnui.exe, a unique version of the open-source tool Ligolo\n[Remote monitoring and management software called eHorus](https://ehorus.com/)\n\nMicrosoft will continue to monitor MERCURY activity and implement protections for our customers. The\ncurrent detections, advanced detections, and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed\nbelow.\n\n## Recommended customer actions\n\nThe techniques used by the actor and described in the Observed actor activity section can be mitigated\nby adopting the security considerations provided below:\n\nCheck if you use SysAid in your network. If you do, apply security patches and update affected\nproducts and services as soon as possible. Refer to SysAid’s Important Update Regarding\nApache Log4j for technical information about the vulnerabilities and mitigation recommendations.\nRefer to the detailed Guidance for preventing, detecting, and hunting for exploitation of the Log4j\n2 vulnerability.\nUse the included indicators of compromise to investigate whether they exist in your environment\nand assess for potential intrusion.\nBlock in-bound traffic from IPs specified in the indicators of compromise table.\nReview all authentication activity for remote access infrastructure, with a particular focus on\naccounts configured with single factor authentication, to confirm authenticity and investigate any\nanomalous activity.\nEnable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate potentially compromised credentials and\nensure that MFA is enforced for all remote connectivity. Note: Microsoft strongly encourages all\n[customers download and use password-less solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure](https://www.microsoft.com/account/authenticator/)\naccounts.\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below list provides IOCs observed during our investigation. We encourage our customers to\ninvestigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify\npast related activity and prevent future attacks against their systems.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Description**\n\nhxxp://sygateway[.]com Domain First seen:\nMay 16,\n2022\n\n\n91[.]121[.]240[.]104 IP\naddress\n\n164[.]132[.]237[.]64 IP\naddress\n\ne81a8f8ad804c4d83869d7806a303ff04f31cce376c5df8aada2e9db2c1eeb98 SHA256\n\n416e937fb467b7092b9f038c1f1ea5ca831dd19ed478cca444a656b5d9440bb4 SHA256\n\n25325dc4b8dcf3711e628d08854e97c49cfb904c08f6129ed1d432c6bfff576b SHA256\n\n3c2fe308c0a563e06263bbacf793bbe9b2259d795fcc36b953793a7e499e7f71 SHA256\n\n3137413d086b188cd25ad5c6906fbb396554f36b41d5cff5a2176c28dd29fb0a SHA256\n\n87f317bbba0f50d033543e6ebab31665a74c206780798cef277781dfdd4c3f2f SHA256\n\ne4ca146095414dbe44d9ba2d702fd30d27214af5a0378351109d5f91bb69cdb6 SHA256\n\nd2e2a0033157ff02d3668ef5cc56cb68c5540b97a359818c67bd3e37691b38c6 SHA256\n\n3ca1778cd4c215f0f3bcfdd91186da116495f2d9c30ec22078eb4061ae4b5b1b SHA256\n\nbbfee9ef90814bf41e499d9608647a29d7451183e7fe25f472c56db9133f7e40 SHA256\n\nb8206d45050df5f886afefa25f384bd517d5869ca37e08eba3500cda03bddfef SHA256\n\n**NOTE: These indicators should not be considered exhaustive for this observed activity.**\n\n### Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence\n\n\nFirst seen:\nMay 17,\n2022\n\nFirst seen:\nNovember\n26, 2021\n\nmimikatz.exe\n\nvpnui.exe\nLigolo\n\nVBScript\n\nRemcom\n\nWeb shell\n\nWeb shell\n\nWeb shell\n\nWeb shell\n\nWeb shell\n\nWeb shell\n\nWeb shell\n\n\n-----\n\nCommunity members and customers can find summary information and all IOCs from this blog post in\n[the linked Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence portal article.](https://ti.defender.microsoft.com/articles/13e0f94b)\n\n## Detections\n\n### Microsoft Defender Antivirus\n\n[Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects attempted exploitation and post-exploitation activity and payloads.](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows)\nTurn on cloud-delivered protection to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques.
