However, there were still some interesting stories\nthat we outline below.\n\nThis week's most interesting story is [CNN's report on Conti Leaks, a Ukrainian researcher](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang/index.html)\nwho has had access to Conti's internal servers for years.\n\nAfter [Conti sided with Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, the researcher fought back by](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-hackers-pick-sides-over-russia-invading-ukraine/)\n[leaking internal chats and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomwares-internal-chats-leaked-after-siding-with-russia/) [source code for the Conti Ransomware gang, providing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/more-conti-ransomware-source-code-leaked-on-twitter-out-of-revenge/)\nresearchers and law enforcement a glimpse into their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Other interesting news is a clever IPFuscation technique used by the Hive ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-uses-new-ipfuscation-trick-to-hide-payload/)\ngang to obfuscate payloads by representing them as IP addresses to evade detection. By\nrunning the list of IP addresses through a decoder, it results in a binary payload that can be\ninstalled.\n\nContributors and those who provided new ransomware information and stories this week\n[include: @PolarToffee,](https://twitter.com/PolarToffee) [@FourOctets,](https://twitter.com/FourOctets) [@jorntvdw,](https://twitter.com/jorntvdw) [@LawrenceAbrams,](https://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams) [@Seifreed,](https://twitter.com/Seifreed)\n[@serghei,](https://twitter.com/serghei) [@malwrhunterteam,](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam) [@DanielGallagher,](https://twitter.com/DanielGallagher) [@VK_Intel,](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel) [@malwareforme,](https://twitter.com/malwareforme)\n[@Ionut_Ilascu,](https://twitter.com/Ionut_Ilascu) [@struppigel,](https://twitter.com/struppigel) [@demonslay335,](https://twitter.com/demonslay335) [@fwosar,](https://twitter.com/fwosar) [@billtoulas,](https://twitter.com/billtoulas) [@BleepinComputer,](https://twitter.com/BleepinComputer)\n[@rivitna2,](https://twitter.com/rivitna2) [@MinervaLabs,](https://twitter.com/minervalabs) [@Amigo_A_,](https://twitter.com/Amigo_A_) [@SentinelOne,](https://twitter.com/SentinelOne) [@AquaSecTeam,](https://twitter.com/AquaSecTeam) [@ContiLeaks,](https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks)\n[@snlyngaas, and](https://twitter.com/snlyngaas) [@pcrisk.](https://twitter.com/pcrisk)\n\n## March 27th 2022\n\n### Hive ransomware ports its Linux VMware ESXi encryptor to Rust\n\nThe Hive ransomware operation has converted their VMware ESXi Linux encryptor to the\nRust programming language and added new features to make it harder for security\nresearchers to snoop on victim's ransom negotiations.\n\n## March 28th 2022\n\n### SunCrypt ransomware is still alive and kicking in 2022\n\nSunCrypt, a ransomware as service (RaaS) operation that reached prominence in mid-2020,\nis reportedly still active, even if barely, as its operators continue to work on giving its strain\nnew capabilities.\n\n### New KalajaTomorr ransomware\n\n[Amigo-A found a new ransomware that drops a ransom note named Hello.txt.](https://twitter.com/Amigo_A_)\n\n## March 29th 2022\n\n### Threat Alert: First Python Ransomware Attack Targeting Jupyter Notebooks\n\nTeam Nautilus has uncovered a Python-based ransomware attack that, for the first time, was\ntargeting Jupyter Notebook, a popular tool used by data practitioners. The attackers gained\ninitial access via misconfigured environments, then ran a ransomware script that encrypts\nevery file on a given path on the server and deletes itself after execution to conceal the\nattack.
