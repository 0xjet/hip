This malware has gone\nunder the radar for what may be several years. Telemetry and limited anecdotal reports indicate that Chinese nationals\nassociated with large multinational corporations may be the targets of campaigns employing GlassRAT. While \"transparent\"\nto most antivirus products, GlassRAT can be detected using network forensic or endpoint tools such as RSA[®] Security\nAnalytics and/or RSA[®] ECAT. Also presented is evidence that GlassRAT's command and control (C2) infrastructure has some\nhistorical overlap with other malicious malware campaigns that have previously targeted Asia-based organizations of\ngeopolitical and strategic importance.\n\n#### OVERVIEW\n\nWhen a cyber espionage campaign is identified; the threat actors' tools, techniques, and procedures revealed; the malware\nnow detectable by antivirus- What do the bad guys do next?  History shows us that this is just part of the process. Once\noperations or campaigns are uncovered, the attackers have contingency plans, which can include minimally substituting only\nthe tools in their kit that may have been detected and/or perhaps finding new victims, who are less alert to their\nthreat. There maybe no need to change the Command and Control infrastructure or their techniques.\n\nIn very large cyber intelligence organizations, which carry a diverse list of objectives and targets, there is likely to be shared\nleadership, policies and procedures, infrastructure, and ample sources and libraries of advanced hacking tools (many still\nunexposed to researchers)- all servicing subordinate organizations with far narrower objectives.\n\nGlassRAT has (briefly) shared C2 infrastructure with some large campaigns, identified earlier in the decade, that targeted\ngeopolitical organizations in the Asia-Pacific region. The telemetry of GlassRAT and limited forensic samples suggest that\ntargeting is narrowly focused.\n\nThus, what makes GlassRat notable is not what it is, but perhaps rather where it came from, who is using it, and for what\npurpose. Spoiler alert: this paper does not offer a conclusion.  Rather, we believe the limited facts are worth consideration,\nparticularly when there may-well be many more undetected / undetectable samples in the wild. Detecting the infrastructure\nand resulting behavior of these tools is perhaps more important when preventive defenses consistently fail. It is also\ncrucially important to recognize the potential origins of these attacks, when detected, to better understand risks to the\norganization.\n\nRSA Research looked for any similarities with other previously described malware, and exploitation campaigns. While\nseveral code similarities were found with other malware such as Taidoor[1] and Taleret[2], the most interesting overlap with\nGlassRAT might be in the C2 infrastructure shared with geopolitical campaigns (outlined below), which were reported earlier\nin this decade.\n\n#### BACKGROUND\n\nGlassRAT appears to have operated, stealthily, for nearly 3 years in some environments. Evidence indicates that Chinese\nnationals associated with large multinational corporations in and outside of China may be the targets of campaigns\nemployed by GlassRat.\n\nGlassRat employs many of the telltale signs of good, at least very effective, malware design. Its dropper is signed using a\ncompromised certificate from a trusted and well-known publisher.[3] It deletes itself after successfully delivering its\npayload. Once installed, the malicious DLL file persists below the radar of endpoint antivirus.\n\nGlassRat first came to the attention of RSA Research in February 2015 when the RSA® Incident Response team, which\nspecializes in responding to advance threat intrusions in large enterprise networks, detected malicious traffic while\ninvestigating an incident at a multi-national firm based in the U.S. A dll sample was discovered, using RSA ECAT, on the PC\nof a Chinese national. There was no evidence of any dropper.  Retrospective analysis on Virus Total revealed a sample\nsubmitted from Hong Kong in December 2014, which exhibited matching characteristics, but a different hash. This\n\n1 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_the_taidoor_campaign.pdf\n2 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/evasive-tactics-taidoor-3.html\n3 The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued this certificate was informed and subsequently revoked the likely stolen code-signing certificate, after\nindependently confirming the maliciousness of the signed code.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe client environment.\n\nThat signature alerted several months later, in September 2015, from samples appearing to originate in China. These\nincluded two droppers, and malware that was functionally identical but with different C2. (The domains were different, but\nthe IP’s overlapped with the previous samples for a period of time.)\n\nRSA Research has linked GlassRAT C2 to other malicious malware C2 infrastructure by way of malicious domains that\npointed to common hosting. In September 2012, Dell SecureWorks reported on a cyber espionage campaign that used a\nRAT named Mirage (also known as MirageFox).[4] PlugX C2 hosts in these and other campaigns were enumerated[56 ]by\nHaruyama and Suzuki at BlackHat Asia in 2014. The threat actor group who controlled alternate009.com created C2 host\nrecords for PlugX malware targeting Mongolian government[78].\n\nThat same threat actor group who controlled alternate009.com created C2 host records for Mirage malware[9] targeting the\nPhilippines military[10].\n\nThe malicious domain mechanicnote.com was used for C2 by several different types of malware, including Mirage malware[11 ]\n\nused for targeting the Philippine military.  This malware with mechanicnote.com domain C2 used a controller on the same\nIP address and server also used for GlassRAT malware C2 (101.55.x.x, bits.foryousee.net).\n\nThe domain news-google.net employed by MagicFire malware[12] C2 targeting the Philippine military, also used a malware\ncontroller hosted on the IP address 173.231.x.x, which was used for Mongolia-targeting PlugX malware[13] employing the\nmalicious cainformations.com domain. Another mecahnicnote.com C2 URL used the same IP address, 198.40.x.x, as did\nmalware using cainformations.com and alternate009.com domains for C2. These domains in turn are tied directly to\nMagicfire, Mirage and PlugX malware in several malicious campaigns.\n\nTo summarize the GlassRAT C2 infrastructure connections, we have GlassRAT connected to Mirage malware C2 hosting,\nwhich in turn is connected to Magicfire, PlugX and Mirage malware targeting the Philippine military and the Mongolia\ngovernment. The temporal overlap window in shared infrastructure was relatively short implying a possible operational\nsecurity slip by the actors behind GlassRAT if not deliberate sharing of infrastructure. The infrastructure overlap traced by\nRSA Research can be seen in detail in the attached C2 overlap graphic in the Appendix.\n\n4 http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/the-mirage-campaign/\n5 https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-14/materials/Haruyama/Asia-14-Haruyama-I-Know-You-Want-Me-Unplugging-PlugX.pdf\n6 http://pastebin.com/B2jNMrM8\n7 https://www.threatconnect.com/khaan-quest-chinese-cyber-espionage-targeting-mongolia/\n8 http://pastebin.com/B2jNMrM8\n9 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/421f4c83898ff3ae9b2a94621140ef770888a8a0914b163cdae4690433173899/analysis/\n10 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/christmas-themed-malware-starts-to-jingle-all-the-way/\n11 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/91279f578d2836ea679ae9578068cb70810fb781faf6d7c03c3212aa509f3e7b/analysis/\n12 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/2ee38b14a570f693c093a53c53c6d10234fb11cfb7318022190cdb8c96d73b35/analysis/\n13 http://pastebin.com/B2jNMrM8\n\n###### 5\n\n\n-----\n\n#### DROPPER SUBMISSIONS FROM CHINA\n\nAs discussed above, RSA Research was first alerted to some specific zero detection malware by the RSA Incident Response\nservices team. Also notable is that the first observed sample[14] of this zero detection malware may have been deployed\nsince September of 2012, if the compile time (Figure 1) is any indicator.  We don’t know if there is any connection between\nthe compilation of GlassRAT and the reports of malware outlined above, much occurring in roughly the same timeframe.\n\nFigure 1 Compilation timestamp of first known sample of GlassRAT malware, appearing on VirusTotal in September of 2014.\n\nThe indicators (see GlassRAT Yara signature in appendix) were fed into the RSA Research hunting capability. Months later;\nRSA Research was alerted to two samples of the GlassRAT malware installer program or \"dropper.\" Both of these dropper\nsamples were not detected by static analysis routines of 57 different Antivirus vendors (Figure 2) on the VirusTotal website.\n\nFigure 2 Zero Antivirus detection ratio of GlassRAT dropper\n\nThe two GlassRAT malware dropper samples were functionally identical. One of the samples was uploaded to VirusTotal\nabout four hours before the next dropper[15]. The second GlassRAT dropper for which RSA Research was alerted[16 ]was signed\nwith a valid code-signing certificate associated with a Beijing-based software developer. One particular application\nassociated with this developer has over half a billion users worldwide, according to the company.\n\n14 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/89317809806ef90bb619a4163562f7db3ca70768db706a4ea483fdb370a79ede/analysis/\n15 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/c11faf7290299bb13925e46d040ed59ab3ca8938eab1f171aa452603602155cb/analysis/\n16 https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/30d26aebcee21e4811ff3a44a7198a5c519843a24f334880384a7158e07ae399/analysis/\n\n###### 6\n\n\n-----\n\n#### UNDER THE RADAR FOR YEARS, TARGETS CHINESE NATIONALS OR ORGANIZATIONS\n\nAlso notable is that the first publically accessible sample of this zero-detection malware (Figure 3) may have been in the\nwild since September of 2012, if the compile time is any indicator. RSA Research has no reason to suspect that the compile\ndate was forged. Additionally, RSA has learned through telemetry data and limited anecdotal reports that GlassRAT may\nprincipally be targeting Chinese nationals or other Chinese speakers, in China and elsewhere, since at least early 2013. The\nsamples uploaded on 24 September 2015 appear to be the first known instance of the dropper/installer files.\n\nFigure 3 First sample of GlassRAT known in the wild\n\nThe absence of an identified dropper in public malware databases prior to September 2015 may explain why the GlassRAT\nTrojan has maintained a low profile with AV vendors since its first appearance on VirusTotal in December of 2014 (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4 First submission date of identified GlassRAT malware as per VirusTotal\n\nFigure 5 shows some of the code-signing certificate details, with the name of the software developer redacted.\n\n###### 7\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 GlassRAT signed file metadata\n\nAt the time of this writing, the malware has been shared with Symantec and Adobe, who were indirectly effected because of\nthe Adobe trademark and the Symantec/Verisign certificate. As more vendors are made aware of this malware, RSA\nResearch believes the detection ratio will increase from the near zero ratio at the time of this writing.\n\n#### GLASSRAT MALWARE ANALYSIS, DESIGNED FOR DECEPTION\n\nRSA's Research has analyzed the GlassRAT trojan and determined that it is a simple but capable RAT with reverse shell as\nwell as other typical capabilities of RATs, such as file transferring and process listing. The GlassRAT dropper uses the\ntrademarked icon of Adobe Flash player, and was named “Flash.exe” (Figure 6) when it was uploaded to VirusTotal from an\nIP address, likely in the Peoples Republic of China on September 17, 2015.\n\nFigure 6 GlassRAT dropper as viewed in Windows Explorer\n\nDouble clicking on the flash.exe files causes the dropper to launch. The GlassRAt malware installation is as follows:\n\n1. Dropper (flash.exe) writes the GlassRAT DLL to the ProgramData folder\n\n2. Dropper runs the DLL file using the built-in Windows utility rundll32.exe\n\n3. GlassRAT DLL file modifies the run key for logon persistence with user-level permissions with the following registry key.\n```\n     HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run  Update\n\n```\n4. the dropper deletes itself with and embedded command:\n```\n     “cmd.exe /c erase /F \"%s\",” \n\n###### 8\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWindows Vista and later “C:\\ProgramData\\Application Data\\” as would be shown in the Microsoft SysInternals Autoruns tool.\n\nFigure 7 GlassRAT non-privileged persistence as viewed through the Autoruns tool\n\nManually bypassing UAC with a right-click reveals metadata associated with the dropper (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 UAC pop-up if invoked with right click and \"Run as administrator\"\n\nThe program name text presented in the UAC dialog box is identical to the name of the legitimate “500 million-user”\napplication produced by the owner of the certificate.\n\nIn the case of installation with privileged user rights such as might be obtained by an exploit or particularly good social\nengineering technique, persistence would consist of installation as an unused service (such as the \"RasAuto\" service in\nFigure 9), which is commonly a disabled-by-default service on ordinary Windows user/client PC's.\n\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services c:\\programdata\\application data\\updatef.dll\n\nFigure 9 GlassRAT persistence mechanism if installed using administrative privileges\n\nThe timestamp on the DLL reflects the compile date of the binary.\n\nRSA Research found samples of GlassRAT with three unique C2 configurations (Table 1). Static analysis of these GlassRAT\nDLL's revealed that the C2 host configuration is obfuscated in all of the samples using a simple XOR technique, utilizing\n0x01 as the one-byte key. The most recent sample used URL's for C2, other samples used URL's in combination with a hard\ncoded IP address (perhaps as a backup), and yet another GlassRAT sample we found used only a single IP address with no\nURLs. The C2 port for each specified C2 node is stored as a packed string and can be readily decoded with a simple script.\n\n###### 9\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GlassRAT DLL MD5 Obfuscated C2 C2 hosts XOR decoded hosts(s) with 0x01\n```\n5c17395731ec666ad0056d3c88e99c4d 003/064/50/60 112.175.x.x\ne98027f502f5acbcb5eda17e67a21cdc chur/gnsxntrdd/odu bits.foryousee.net\n                     012/31/084/353 103.20.x.x\n59b404076e1af7d0faae4a62fa41b69f py/s`trdsr/bnl qx.rausers.com\n                     ly/s`trdsr/bnl mx.rausers.com\n                     yy/s`trdsr/bnl xx.rausers.com\n\n```\nTable 1 Three different GlassRAT C2 host configurations found in the wild by RSA Research\n\n#### GLASSRAT CAPABILITIES AND FUNCTIONS\n\nGlassRAT provides reverse shell functionality to an infected victim. The communication contains a handshake between the\nattacker and the victim. The sample will send the hard coded value 0x cb ff 5d c9 ad 3f 5b a1 54 13 fe fb 05 c6 22, the\nresponse from the C2 is then compared with the value 0x3f5ba154 and then the subsequent commands are a series of two\nbyte codes. The malware performs a sanity check to make sure that the low byte of the two-byte combinations is 17 (0x11)\nor less. A QWORD is used to track directionality, and a DWORD is used to delimit data size. Control data is then passed to\nand from GlassRAT in the clear, such that system information and Windows command shell output would be readily\nobservable in network traffic. GlassRAT initially accepts two primary commands (both with a set of sub commands) from its\ncontroller which are as follows:\n\n**0x01: Provides/Enumerates system information from the victim host**\n**0x02: Native Command and reverse shell communications and output.**\n\nThe initial beacon and handshake of controller-initiated C2 will pass the IP address of the victim to the GlassRAT controller.\nHowever, this was not observed in our dynamic analysis, suggesting that it requires manual command from the C2\noperator. Perhaps such commands are performed by the operator only if a connection by a nosy researcher has been ruled\nout.\n\nWhen the 0x01 primary command is issued the malware is configured with the following subcommands, which are in red.\n```\n     0x01 01 – C2 request for System Information\n     0x01 02 – Victim response to request for system information\n     0x01 03 – C2/Victim keep alive\n     0x01 06 – C2 Read C:\\ProgramData\\off.dat \n\n```\nWhen the 0x02 primary command is issued the malware is configured with the following subcommands. Not all of the 17\npossibilities are utilized in the samples that were analyzed, and this could allow for future expansion of the malware’s\ncapabilities by its author(s).\n```\n     0x02 01 – C2 Cmd command\n     0x02 02 – Victim Response from cmd commands\n     0x02 03 – C2 initiate cmd.exe pipe/thread\n     0x02 04 – C2 kill cmd pipe/thread\n     0x02 05 – C2 execute file/start process \n     0x02 06 – Not Used/present\n     0x02 07 – Not Used/present\n     0x02 08 – Victim response to file download – File not found \n     0x02 09 – Not Used/present\n     0x02 0A – Not Used/present\n     0x02 0B – C2 command to get handle information \n     0x02 0C – Download file from Victim\n     0x02 0D – Victim response to file download – File transmission\n\n###### 10\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n     0x02 0F – Not Used/present\n     0x02 10 – C2 command to get handle information\n     0x02 11 – Create process on Victim \n     0x02 12 – Victim response to file upload\n\n#### COMMAND AND CONTROL\n\n```\nTo perform dynamic analysis on the new dropper, RSA Research leveraged RSA Security Analytics (Figure 10) and RSA\nECAT to quickly gather indicators and forensic details about the GlassRAT malware.\n\nFigure 10 GlassRAT C2 activity in RSA[®] Security Analytics\n\nRSA[®] ECAT (Figure 11) reveals that the Trojan is loaded as RasAuto service (via svchost.exe network service process) when\ninstalled with administrative privileges, and Figure 12 indicates detection by RSA[®] ECAT when installed with non-privileged\ncredentials (rundll32.exe running the GlassRAT DLL).\n\nFigure 11 GlassRAT (administrative install) C2 as detected by RSA[®] ECAT\n\n###### 11\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 GlassRAT (user-level install) C2 as detected by RSA[®] ECAT\n\nAnalysts wishing to leverage RSA[®] ECAT to find RATs including GlassRAT in their enterprise networks may want to refer to\nthe technical whitepaper “Catching the R.A.T. with ECAT”[17] presented at RSA Charge by Justin Lamarre.\n\nRSA[®] Security Analytics reveals connections to following host aliases, which as of the time of this writing, resolve to the\nsame IP address: 115.144.x.x in South Korea. The GlassRAT connects with the following string in the handshake.\n\ncb ff 5d c9 ad 3f 5b a1 54 13 fe fb 05 c6 22\n\nThe handshake protocol has been incorporated into a parser for RSA[®] Security Analytics (Figure 13) that is included in this\nreport’s annex, as well as on RSA[®] Live.\n\nFigure 13 GlassRAT C2 parser in action on RSA[®] Security Analytics\n\nEven without the parser (typical with a protocol-abusing raw socket connection) RSA[®] Security Analytics flags on “unknown\nservice over http port” and “unknown service over ssl port” (Figure 14), cluing the security investigator to the probability\nthat the traffic is malicious.\n\n17 http://charge.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Finding-The-R.A.T-With-ECAT.pdf\n\n###### 12\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 GlassRAT protocol abuse identified by Security Analytics\n\n\nIn each case, the Trojan dropper installed the DLL with the file pointer hard coded to be 12 megabytes in size. Thus,\nalthough the functional part of the GlassRAT DLL is only 16kb or so in size, the file size shown on disk is much larger (Figure\n15).\n\nFigure 15 GlassRAT DLL takes 11+MB on disk, but consists of mostly null data bytes\n\n#### APPENDIX\n\nCampaign C2 overlap graphic\n\nMalware hashes\n\nC2 infrastructure (some IP addresses redacted)\n\nGlassRAT Yara signature\n\n#### PRIVATE ANNEX \n\nUnredacted C2 infrastructure\n\nUnredacted campaign C2 overlap graphic\n\nGlassRAT C2 decoder script\n\n(RSA customers and vetted industry partners can have access to the private annex by emailing conops@RSA.com.)\n\n###### 13\n\n\n-----",
