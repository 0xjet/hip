Now, researchers in Threat Protection Labs have identified a new pattern and\ntechnique in use, seeing this malware being poised and ready to be deployed to target a\nwider set of Android users. The research team have seen that Hydra Banking Trojan 2.0, is\nnow preparing to target crypto apps, having previously focused on financial services and\nbanking customers – its evolution shows it as poised to target consumers via over 200\napps.\n\nThis new threat was first spotted in January 2022 by Avira’s Threat Protection team, leading\nto a deep dive with conclusions reached in March 2022, shared below.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nWhile checking one internet monitoring cyber threat intelligence feed we noticed quite a\nstrange URL. The host was just an IP, no domain, ending with the mundane ’download.php‘.\nSimple yet surprising when noticing it was serving an APK with a hash not seen anywhere\nelse before.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: The URL serving malicious APKs\nAt that moment, little did we know it would lead to the discovery of an ongoing Hydra\ncampaign targeting ~50 million German and Austrian banking customers and potentially\nmany other targets.\n\nHydra is an Android BankBot variant, a type of malware designed to steal banking\ncredentials. The way it does this is by requesting the user enables dangerous permissions\nsuch as accessibility and every time the banking app is opened, the malware is hijacking\nthe user by overwriting the legit banking application login page with a malicious one. The\ngoal is the same, to trick the user to enter his login credentials so that it will go straight to\nthe malware authors.\n\n## 2. Ongoing Campaign\n\nThe campaign appears to have been running since the last quarter of 2021 and is still\nongoing at the time of writing this, March 2022\n\nThe host (172.121.14[.]62) from which this research started seems to have served more\nthan 30 different samples (at the time of writing this) related to this campaign.\n\nFigure 2: List of malicious samples served by 172.121.14[ .]62Looking at the domains being\nhosted on that IP we also notice a lot of phishing domains targeting BAWAG P.S.K. and\n\n\n-----\n\nCommerzBank users, masquerading as reputable organisations to trick consumers:\n\nFigure 3: List of phishing URLs served by 172.121.14[.]62The Avira technology is\nsuccessfully detecting this malware and quarantining it – as per the detection names below\nwhich appear when Avira picks up the malware, samples shown below – while we\ncontinued to research this malware and establish its course:\n\nANDROID/Dropper.Agent.GAAN.Gen\nANDROID/Dropper.FKLB.Gen\nANDROID/Dropper.FKHF.Gen\n\n## 3. Dynamic analysis\n\nMoving forward to the analysis of the sample, the first step was to send it to our in-house\nDynamic Analysis Android Sandbox, aka DANY. After getting the behavioral report we\nnoticed some interesting things.\n\nThe Avira Dynamic analysis report revealed the following behaviour:\n\n1. Accessibility service is used\n2. Drops a DEX which gets deleted afterwards\n3. Hides launcher icon\n4. Saved preferences contain a list of other banking apps’ package names\n5. Accesses an .onion DarkWeb URL\n6. Drops a zip file from URL\n\n\n-----\n\n**What we mean by an .onion DarkWeb URL**\n\nThe dark web, also known as the deep web or dark net, is a privacy-focused part of\nthe internet, running on the Tor Network. It’s harder to access, accessed through the\nTor Browser, or through connection to the network using a special library to handle the\nnecessary steps.\n\nAn .onion is a hidden service, a website running on the Tor Network. These domains\nusually have random characters and end with the .onion extension. They can’t easily\nbe taken down by a central authority and the server hosting the website is difficult to\nlocate. Their appeal to those people behind the Hydra Banking Trojan 2.0, is that they\nfunction on a private key mechanism. This means that anybody with the private key\ncan keep that website up and maintain control, so even if the server hosting the\nwebsite was found and taken down, in a short space of time the person with the\nprivate key could simply start it up once again.\n\n1. The app’s name is BAWAG PSK Security and the logo is similar to one used by an\nAustrian Bank. Right off the bat it asks for accessibility permission.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n4: First thing you see after opening the app\nUsually banking apps don’t ask you for that kind of permission, some even refuse to\noperate if you have a rooted phone, thus we can assume that this sample may be banker\nmalware looking to steal some credentials.\n\nBanking malware has been going around for a long time and is here to stay, the Covid\npandemic has hugely accelerated the adoption of internet banking apps.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Nowadays, dropping a DEX file and deleting it is a practice used both by malware for\nhiding reasons, but also by clean apps in an obfuscation attempt. But we’ll take note of it\nand check it later\n\nFigure 5:\n\nFull path of the dropped DEX file (danyleted means the folder/file was deleted)\n3. Now, hiding the app’s icon after giving the accessibility may also be a red flag, but it’s a\ntechnique again, also used by clean apps, yet they announce this to you beforehand so\nthere’s nothing hidden under the table (or at least the good ones).\n\n4. Looking over the Shared Preferences we notice a list of other banking and security apps’\npackage names under a key containing the word “injects”. We’re now highly suspicious.\n\nFigure 6: Shared Preference with a key containing “injects” in itself, the value being a list of\nmostly banking apps\n5. Looking at the URLs accessed, we can see something really fascinating – an actual\nworking request to an .onion Tor (DarkWeb) URL. (Taking a small explanatory break: to\naccess an .onion URL you need to connect to the Tor network).\n\nNow, when building DANY we didn’t add any Tor support by default, so unless it became\nsentient, the sample downloaded what it needed to perform such a connection\n\nFigure 7: List of accessed URLs\n\nFigure 8: Process initiating a Tor network connection\nFollowing the network trail, we can see that the sample downloaded Tor libraries from a now\ninactive GitHub URL, then made a request to the .onion\n\nFigure 9: The .onion and its base64 encrypted payload\nthe response being another url on the clearnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Decrypted base64 payload\nBy using an .onion to get the “real” URL the malware authors minimize their losses. When\nthe “real” URL’s domain gets taken down, another one can be set up and the response from\nthe .onion will simply be updated, as the .onion, by design, can only be taken down by the\none who holds its private key.\n\nThis way, if someone downloads the sample after a few years and the initial “real” URL was\nbanned, the infection will still be effective.\n\n6. Continuing with the network path, the “real” URL is used to download a zip file.\n\nFigure 11: Zip archive served by the “real” URL\nWhat is in that archive you ask? Well that’s actually the core of the entire sample.\n\nFigure 12: Contents of the malicious archive\nInside the inj folder is a list of folders containing phishing html kits, whereby the malware is\nmasquerading as reputable major banks in Germany and Austria such as: Volksbank, Bank\nAustria, BAWAG P.S.K., CommerzBank, Deutsche Bank, easybank, Santander Consumer\nBank and some pin apps of Huawei and Samsung phones.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Phishing HTML for Bank of Austria login page\nWe observed some of them in a state of “TODO”, indicating they are the most probable next\ntargets.\n\nFigure 14: “TODO” Phishing HTML masquerading as a CommerzBank login page\nWhat is even more concerning is what was found in the other folder of the archive\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Contents of icons folder\nWe came upon a stash of more than 200 icons belonging to European banking apps,\nCrypto apps and other popular apps. All the indications point in conclusion towards this\nmalware campaign evolving throughout 2022, not only targeting a larger network of\nEuropean banks, but also targeting the crypto realm.\n\nBased on this information alone we could label the sample as malware and write a\nbehavioral rule to detect this type of family, ensuring our systems maintain their high\ndetection rates. In addition to this, we’re now going the extra mile into the static analysis\nrealm – as there may be other dormant behavior or IoCs which could help us in finding\nother samples and employ even better clustering techniques, to route this malware out.\n\n## 4. Static analysis\n\nLet’s take a look over the dropped dex, shall we?\n\n**Strings Encryption**\n\nThe first thing we notice are the strings encrypted using XOR and a per class lookup table,\nin a similar way Flubot does, thus using the same decryption method.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Encrypted strings, decryption key and decryption meth\nNow that we can better understand what’s going on, let’s take a look over what is\nhappening with those icons and phishing html files at the code level.\n\nFigure 17: onFcmmessageReceived methods checking the received message is a\nnotification calling another method onInjectNotificationReceived, passing the data along\nThe intercepted notification is now sent to the CC and also displayed without any change.\nBut what is up with that dropped folder with lots of apps icons? Well, due to some limitation\nof Android, you can only get the launcher icon of an installed app, not the one displayed\ninside the notification (yes, they are different). Thus, the malware authors made a big list of\nicons for the intercepted notifications. Even though the notifications’ text is not manipulated\nin any way now, in the near future it could be and the list of the dropped notification icons\nmay be the list of targets for that.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: onInjectNotificationReceived code and exfiltration to the CC\nWhen an app is started it will be checked to see if it is indeed one of the targets and our\nresearch tells us that if that’s the case, the dropped html files will be used as a phishing\nlogin page to collect the victims’ credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: Checking if the app is one of the phishing targets\n\n## Some other interesting capabilities include:\n\n### Exfiltrating all sent & received SMS text messages\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20: Every received SMS is exfiltrated along with the sender’s phone number to the\nCC at device/SMS endpoint\n\nFigure 21: Every sent SMS is exfiltrated to the CC to the device/read-SMS endpoint\n\n### Cutting the internet connection surely will stop the malware from stealing my stuff, right?\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22: Methods used for starting Wi-Fi/Mobile Data\nThere is no benefit to cutting the connection, so that is not an option to stop this malware in\nits tracks. The malware goes to the settings and enables the Wi-Fi/Mobile Data on its own.\n\nThe malware also checks if the execution environment is a popular Android emulator like\nAVD, Genymotion or VirtualBox or a real Android device as shown in Figure 23.\n\nFigure 23: Checks against popular emulator fingerprints (Genymotion, AVD, Virtualbox)\n\n### Hiding the app from the launcher\n\nFigure 24: The empty website, with the warning from the browser\n\n### ‘What if we just delete the malware by going to the Settings and uninstall it, even if it doesn’t have an icon?’\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25: On line 889, the samples checks if its name aka “BAWAG PSK Security” is\npresent on the screen, does some sanity context checks (e.g. the text is not coming from\nthe sample itself being displayed, or the installer, etc) and clicks on the necessary button to\ninstantly get out of there)\nUnfortunately that won’t help a consumer. Every time you manage to get there and click\nUninstall, it circumvents this tactic as you will discover you’re sent back to the Home\nscreen.\n\n### Exfiltrating the unlocking pin to the CC\n\nFigure 26: The samples monitor events relating to the unlocking of the screen and\nintercepts the pin code, exfiltrating it to its CC\n\n### Sending bulk SMS text messages to all the contacts\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27: Functionality for bulk sending a SMS text message to all victim’s contacts\n\n### TeamViewer integration, in case the malware authors want to see/do some custom actions on the infected devices\n\nFigure 28: TeamViewer functionality, finding the on screen displayed username and\npassword\n\n### Last but not least, one artifact which may unfortunately reflect reality:\n\nFigure 29: A sad\n\nreality reflecting string or just trolling\n\n\n-----\n\n## MITRE Mobile ATT&CK v10 Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name**\n\ncollection T1409 Access Stored Application Data\n\ncollection T1410 Network Traffic Capture or Redirection\n\ncollection T1412 Capture SMS Messages\n\ncollection T1413 Access Sensitive Data in Device Logs\n\ncollection T1417 Input Capture\n\ncollection T1432 Access Contact List\n\ncollection T1433 Access Call Log\n\ncollection T1513 Screen Capture\n\ncollection T1517 Access Notifications\n\ncollection T1533 Data from Local System\n\ncollection T1616 Call Control\n\ncommand-and-control T1437 Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\ncommand-and-control T1438 Alternate Network Mediums\n\ncommand-and-control T1509 Uncommonly Used Port\n\ncommand-and-control T1616 Call Control\n\ncredential-access T1409 Access Stored Application Data\n\ncredential-access T1410 Network Traffic Capture or Redirection\n\ncredential-access T1411 Input Prompt\n\ncredential-access T1412 Capture SMS Messages\n\ncredential-access T1413 Access Sensitive Data in Device Logs\n\ncredential-access T1416 URI Hijacking\n\ncredential-access T1417 Input Capture\n\ncredential-access T1517 Access Notifications\n\ndefense-evasion T1406 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\n\n-----\n\ndefense-evasion T1444 Masquerade as Legitimate Application\n\ndefense-evasion T1447 Delete Device Data\n\ndefense-evasion T1508 Suppress Application Icon\n\ndefense-evasion T1516 Input Injection\n\ndefense-evasion T1523 Evade Analysis Environment\n\ndefense-evasion T1576 Uninstall Malicious Application\n\ndefense-evasion T1604 Proxy Through Victim\n\ndefense-evasion T1618 User Evasion\n\ndiscovery T1424 Process Discovery\n\ndiscovery T1523 Evade Analysis Environment\n\nexecution T1402 Broadcast Receivers\n\nexecution T1603 Scheduled Task/Job\n\nexfiltration T1437 Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\nexfiltration T1438 Alternate Network Mediums\n\nimpact T1447 Delete Device Data\n\nimpact T1448 Carrier Billing Fraud\n\nimpact T1516 Input Injection\n\nimpact T1582 SMS Control\n\nimpact T1616 Call Control\n\ninitial-access T1444 Masquerade as Legitimate Application\n\ninitial-access T1476 Deliver Malicious App via Other Means\n\nnetwork-effects T1439 Eavesdrop on Insecure Network Communication\n\nnetwork-effects T1463 Manipulate Device Communication\n\npersistence T1402 Broadcast Receivers\n\npersistence T1603 Scheduled Task/Job\n\nprivilege-escalation T1401 Device Administrator Permissions\n\n\n-----\n\nremote-service-effects T1468 Remotely Track Device Without Authorization\n\n## Conclusion & further assumptions\n\nIn a nutshell, combining third-party cyber threat intelligence sources with Avira’s Behavioral\nAnalysis Android Sandbox, aka DANY, and some manual analysis we were able to gain a\nbetter look at an ongoing malware campaign targeting users from major banks of Germany\nand Austria.\n\nWhile currently this campaign targets banking users from Central Europe, the artifacts\nfound make us believe they will soon expand to the rest of Europe, as Hydra Banking\nTrojan 2.0 attempts to spread its tentacles. Moreover, at Avira our research highlights that it\nwill be aiming squarely at the crypto space, targeting even more people, as they access\ncrypto apps.\n\n2022 may be the year of crypto malware. This type of malware has been on the rise and\nthis new research indicates just how crypto malware is set to aggressively target more\nunsuspecting victims across Europe this year.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nSometimes, fast adoption of technology is a good thing, but being fast sometimes means\nskipping steps in your growth. If you have people around you who are new to the realm of\nInternet Banking like your parents or grandparents, please be patient and share some of\nyour internet behavior knowledge with them.\n\nAlso, here are some recommendations for being safe while doing banking from your phone:\n\n1. Always keep your device up to date\n2. Use a reputable mobile security solution for Android (such as Avira Antivirus Security,\n\nNorton Mobile Security, or any other trustworthy solution), to help you avoid malware,\nit’s certainly worth considering the free versions available.\n3. Official Banking Apps are always on Google Play Store (or the equivalent official store\n\nfrom your region), do not install apps by clicking on random links.\n4. When in doubt, seek professional help.\n5. Don’t click links in sketchy text messages. They can take you to spoof sites that look\n\nreal but will steal your personal information or install malware on your device.\n\n## IoCs\n\n**URLs**\n\nhxxp://176.121.14[.]62/apk/psk/download.php <\n\nhxxp://loa5ta2rso7xahp7lubajje6txt366hr3ovjgthzmdy7gav23xdqwnid[.]onion/api/mirrors\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/dyd1y/tor-files/main/all_tor.zip\n\nhxxps://yuuzzlllaa[.]xyz/storage/zip/kB2xjRKM2JcaZ6vmAVVkY5aNVtjyYozXMNn4taGj.zip\n\nhxxps://babosiki[.]buzz\n\nhxxps://trustpoopin[.]xyz\n\nhxxps://trygotii[.]xyz\n\nhxxps://trytogoi[.]xyz\n\n**Hashes**\nb3572431c29f5d942a11d6eeed332f22b541ead431b1e2a5b76ee9dc7482d2da\nd1f96474168d3f712c93482972a629c0b27d59c72bdd42acccc7a9776d6d347d\n21927dca6d36fb51ed87f42f925bde7ac18a28d0896f64b572e36ce7ba86c012\n68a7db00684e7ea754c9d2f1d26c242059567ae6750ea2b264ef1e7d92c5a019\nd213631f26bf4970164ba08baab5b5f8718dd5d9cb6ffe4704dc12e463745566\nef05c7bf79a177f153260d34f3f8c4446960ca486eeeb04e58ca5625498ba0e4\na93d66a127091d11090f544514d7e677c24db69d361008e60fffc5200331a1fe\n5a8faa90a1b947ae55fc981d051840628983705c6433002e1cc8444a7e8526fd\nb4dadf3553bb82499c4d0b6be96c47c46abc6904b611376d75c844ffb83725c6\n460882326e78aaad6457180909ce01ab3a88607ea885798173322d210cb1af4b\n580b2dca744c6f30f5f1222f3f1cce7cd25765cbe306844dab269a6e526ffd0e\n63907ab37b4d39b645fa1bef4821f2bccfa4fa26a484a5ade792075abd235716\n77b62979b466467a00deb74ada61d5d8ba349edb763e1f11bb993fbb2b24d543\neabb9dd3e9dad713b517bb576e979e85c1d7630fe398cf42d3d92cd1264726f8\n5f07fd5f9bae3d67496be866e6035926faaef8df7b50c69ee38651bd0c7b660b\n8daba255898f93cb348cc1b59dd25223bd459443a41784f423cbb0cee653d846\n6e5b7c860358dfc9ad679cecc37668eb98c1d815ec0c3f9a7e180f8213ba8220\ne2bf4069cb1056681287e2165e2b23c2aec313a55d6823ffc0c3f9af13081d35\n7a10575b8a9a0cdfccb4585ab32ed568c07c69c05bd9b329750839959cb5be15\n9d793019580da230f3583021dc5b571523745c525a96d1d67f3e693c10b0c260\nd781680e473405d58eff13c4154cd43b8f56ccc677c54b150aa9b5e19032c895\n617ec9a28b66d534af9618cd73d93f2703528551b19e8a96671b2bf1ee2c21b8\nf42d620a30e299a3a5393a3c6d6452de88e52375a1e8814525c99bc4d50a5771\nf5ec3c21987ea44b11a5894c2f8eb68e6dff2c2710875ee94cc9e93bf434152a\n4457337649604203ebd38672733bfba4f727e2d614e2518e544693ff4bf3ea86\n7b28f3c7172209d74e21c4359f56269d7cb65a24684580524c00b56a0650d5ba\nda45d415c8e7b6293c8f5bbd9ad1443fa54f0661008c9cd0b8e5052730735eda\ncb8c66be084885dd88353e6725d48dca46286d757e70e55d9c568ceaeb91453a\nf48bb168c6904b7bed1bccb9f505eae2a85d7eaeaae4d84ecf7881c44ae16791\n8601cfffef535dd68dea6fff720d70bbb7ca5ea9e5f20ee2d7f88355d8c74489\nff3164a1c89f020367105045ee195a5c922154c5472a9fc8ccc8152ea54f6610\n\n\n-----\n\nde3e82705f19a16b62209ac96811b2101560656249dde4ec2b8b8def755ac127\naf27b354c20280567357f5ec779d14e95ec6e04dc10625ef9d4dc99cc55b9eed\na3c34975e0f8791acfe1b7b5e3dac3d92fa1623aefa5101e5185c944bbbf10ac\n3b56b9c0d98c475c5f3f3ad98f8a56709f211f8b14a0bec3aba32791ebc647f0\n184ea57eb7c01ce4de824c21a8627065ad7001dd09c849663e3ff5bbd4e554fe\n\n**[Ionut Bucur](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/author/ionut-bucur)**\n\nWorking at the Avira Threat Protection Labs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Avira Protection Labs](https://www.avira.com/en/blog/author/avira-labs)**\n\nProtection Lab is the heart of Avira’s threat detection and protection unit.
