According to the alert, the\nemail was written in Japanese and asked recipients to click the link to confirm their\nevacuation area from a tsunami after an earthquake. The link in the email is not critical\ninformation to save your life but malware to steal crucial information from you. The malware\n[is Smoke Loader, infamous commodity malware used by various cybercriminals since 2011.](https://cyb3rsleuth.blogspot.com/2011/08/smoke-loader.html)\n\nSmoke Loader is a modular loader where attackers can select any payload to be installed on\nthe victim by Smoke Loader. Thus, the final payload can vary between attacks. For example,\nwe previously reported on the Retefe Banking Trojan being distributed by Smoke Loader in\nSweden, and Japan. We have also seen backdoors, ransomware, cryptominers, password\nstealers, Point-of-Sale (PoS) malware, and banking Trojans installed by Smoke Loader.\n\nThis attack seems to be aiming to steal credentials from unidentified targets in Japan and\ntook a similar approach to normal targeted attacks. The attacker registered the fake\nJapanese government agency domain and ensured the file path to the malware on the\nserver is close to the legitimate agency web site. They wrote the lure email in fluent\nJapanese and did not distribute it broadly. In late November, the attacker started using\nanother commodity malware known as AzoRult. Figure 1 shows the timeline of this attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Time line of the attack_\n\n## Smoke Loader Analysis\n\nThough it’s been seven years since Smoke Loader first appeared, the author keeps updating\nthe code. [Malwarebytes published an excellent analysis of Smoke Loader in 2016. The](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/08/smoke-loader-downloader-with-a-smokescreen-still-alive/)\nsamples we looked at added the following techniques to avoid detection or analysis.\n\nCode obfuscation by junk jump\nDecrypts subroutines and encrypts them after execution\n[Employs PROPagate trick to inject second stage code into an explorer.exe process](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2017/10/26/propagate-a-new-code-injection-trick/)\nChanges the algorithm of generating the unique ID\nEncrypts network traffics and payload file\n\n[Some of these techniques were already reported by FireEye and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/06/rig-ek-delivering-monero-miner-via-propagate-injection-technique.html) [Talos this year. We will](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/smoking-guns-smoke-loader-learned-new.html)\nfocus on the unique ID, C2 communication, and the payload in this blog.\n\n## Generating a unique ID\n\nInitially, the threat generates a unique ID for the compromised machine from the computer\nname, the hardcoded static number(0B0D0406), and the volume serial number of the system\ndrive. Smoke Loader uses the unique ID for three purposes:\n\nTracking the compromised machine at C2.\nEncrypting payload by the ID.\nCreating random file names for persistence.\n\nHere’s how to create the unique ID. If the computer name is “Test_PC” and the volume serial\nnumber is “12345678”, the threat appends the three values like the following:\n\n\"Test_PC\" + \"0B0D0406\" + \"12345678\" = \"Test_PC0B0D040612345678\"\n\nand it calculates the MD5 hash value of the string,\n\nMD5(\"Test_PC0B0D040612345678\") = 41EE612602833345FC5BD2B98103811C\n\nIt then appends the volume serial to the hash value and gets the 40 characters unique ID.\n\n\"41EE612602833345FC5BD2B98103811C\" + \"12345678\" =\n\"41EE612602833345FC5BD2B98103811C12345678\"\n\nNext, Smoke Loader generates two strings based on the first eight characters and the last\neight characters of the ID. Following is the algorithm written in Python.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n\n# the unique ID\nid = \"41EE612602833345FC5BD2B98103811C12345678\"\n\ndef makeStrings(_s):\nresults = \"\"\n\nfor n in _s:\nresults += chr((ord(n) - 0x30) + ord('a'))\n\nreturn results\n\nstringA = makeStrings(id[:8]) # \"ebvvgbcg\"\nstringB = makeStrings(id[-8:]) # \"bcdefghi\"\n\n\nSmoke Loader uses these strings for the file name. It copies itself as follows.\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\[stringA\\[stringB].exe\n\nand it creates following shortcut file to execute the threat when the computer starts.\n\n%StartUp%\\[stringA].lnk\n\nThese two strings look random. However, the attacker always generates two identical strings\nto the compromised machine since it is based on the static values of the environment.\n\n## C2 Communication\n\nSmoke Loader contains the following hardcoded C2 address.\n\njma-go[.]jp/js/metrology/jma.php\n\nAn outline of initial C2 communication follows.\n\n1. Smoke Loader sends the encrypted data to C2 by HTTP POST method.\n2. C2 server replies HTTP 404 response (Not Found) with encrypted data.\n3. Smoke Loader extracts the plugin from C2, encrypts it by using the unique ID, and\n\nsaves it local disk.\n4. Smoke Loader extracts the payload modules from the encrypted plugin file and injects\n\nthem into an Explorer.exe process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Initial communication_\n\n## Making initial POST data\n\nSmoke Loader creates the data to send C2. At offset 0, there is a marker ‘E207’ followed by\n[the unique ID (Figure 3). The marker is ‘072E’ in little-endian form and ‘2018’ in decimal.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)\nSmoke Loader uses the marker every time communicating with C2.\n\n_Figure 3 POST data_\n\nSmoke Loader finally encrypts the data with RC4 cipher by using the static key 0x161A9A0C\nand send it to the C2 by HTTP POST method.\n\n## Plugin from C2\n\nThe C2 server responds the plugin data contains the final payload with HTTP 404 status\ncode. Smoke Loader obtains the encrypted header size from the first DWORD value of the\nplugin and decrypts the following bytes with RC4 cipher by the different static key\n\n\n-----\n\n0x1D17D70A. Figure 4 shows the plugin data after decryption. It then verifies the marker\n‘E207’ and gets the plugin size which is defined in the \"plugin_size’ variable.\n\n_Figure 4 Reply data from C2_\n\nAfter checking the plugin size, Smoke Loader encrypts plugin data with an RC4 cipher using\nthe unique ID and saves it as the following path with the generated string from the ID. Since\nthe file is encrypted with the distinct value to the machine, the file hash is always different on\neach computer even if the plugin is identical.\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\[stringA]\\[stringA]\n\nThen Smoke Loader decrypts the saved plugin data. The plugin data has thirteen-byte length\nheader and consists from following values.\n\n**Offset** **Size** **Value**\n\n0x00 DWORD Plugin size\n\n0x04 DWORD Plugin marker, 0xD5A08DD8\n\n0x08 DWORD Unknown, possible plugin identifier\n\n0x0C BYTE Number of modules in the plugin\n\n_Table 1 Plugin header_\n\nThe plugin can contain multiple modules. In the case of this tsunami campaign, the payload\ncontains six modules. Each module has a header that includes its size and RC4 key to\ndecrypt.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Plugin header and module header_\n\nSmoke Loader decrypts a module with RC4 cipher by the specified key. After verifying\narchitecture flag (64 bit or 32 bit) in the module, the threat executes Explorer.exe process\nand injects the module into the process. Since the threat repeats this the number of modules\ntimes, there should be multiple Explorer.exe processes on the compromised machine.\n\n## Payload Modules\n\nTable 2 shows the list of modules in this campaign. There are three types of functions in two\narchitectures.\n\n**Module** **Architecture** **Function**\n\n1 32 bit Stealing stored credential from browsers and email programs\n\n2 64 bit Incomplete porting of Module 1\n\n3 32 bit Stealing data sending from Browsers\n\n4 64 bit Same with Module 3\n\n5 32 bit Stealing login credential from email protocols\n\n6 64 bit Same with Module 5\n\n_Table 2 Module list_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen injecting modules, Smoke Loader passes the configuration data including the following\nvalues to the modules for C2 communication. Each module has exact same C2\ncommunication code with the loader.\n\nRC4 encryption key for HTTP POST\nThe unique ID\nC2 URL\n\n**Module 1**\n\nThis module aims to steal stored credentials in following programs.\n\nInternet Explorer\nFirefox\nChrome\nOpera\nChromium\nYandex\nAmigo\nQQBrowser\nOutlook\nThunderbird\nWinSCP\n\nModule 2 contains a partial code of Module 1 but appears to be in the under development\nphase.\n\n**Modules 3 and 4**\n\nThese modules hook APIs and steals all data being sent data from following browsers.\n\nFirefox\nInternet Explorer\nEdge\nChrome\nOpera\n\n**Modules 5 and 6**\n\nThese modules hook APIs and steals user id, password, and their associated remote ftp and\nemail server addresses on following protocols.\n\nFTP on port 21\nSMTP on port 25, 587, 2525\nPOP3 on port 110\n\n\n-----\n\nIMAP on port 143\n\n## Infrastructures and another tools\n\nA person registered the domain name jma-go[.]jp on Oct 30, 2018.
