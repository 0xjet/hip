The process of liberalization has cast a spotlight onto these resources, which many have been eyeing for**\n\n**commercial exploitation, especially neighbouring countries like China and India, and yet they are situated in the midst of armed**\n\n**conflict. China’s demand for natural resources has led it to invest heavily in Burma, providing backing for infrastructure projects such�**\n\n**as pipelines, dams, highways, and railways. This undertaking is not without controversy, as these development projects cut across**\n\n**[territories known for being political hotspots and have resulted in concerns regarding their significant environmental and human�](http://www.earthrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/the-burma-china-pipelines.pdf)**\n\n**rights impact.**\n\n**[The Kyaukpyu Shwe Gas Pipeline, for instance, transports crude and natural gas overland from the Bay of Bengal, traversing the](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrmeyer/2015/02/09/oil-and-gas-china-takes-a-shortcut/)**\n\n**conflict-ridden� Arakan and northern Shan States, and finally to the city of Kunming, the capital of China’s Yunnan province which�**\n\n**[borders Burma.

During the last years of the military junta (1962-2011), Burmese independent media groups experienced waves**\n\n**[of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and defacement attacks, often around the anniversary of the 2007 “Saffron Revolution,” a](http://access.opennet.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/accesscontested-chapter-08.pdf)**\n\n**[period of mass protests during which authorities shut down national access to the Internet.

In 2000, Burmese political activists reported receiving](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JJ01Ae01.html)**\n\n**malware attacks, and accused the government of engaging in an organized attack campaign.**\n\n## Post-Reform Targeted Attacks\n\n**Since the beginning of the reform period, a number of reports have emerged of targeted malware attacks against journalists and**\n\n**Burmese government targets that are contextually related to the energy sector and industrial development issues in the country.**\n\n**[Beginning in 2013, a number of domestic and foreign journalists working in the country received warnings from Google that their](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/asia/journalists-e-mail-accounts-targeted-in-myanmar.html)**\n\n**Gmail accounts might have been targeted by “state-sponsored attackers”.

This IFRAME served visitors a variant of the Evilgrab�**\n\n**malware family. The Evilgrab malware has typical RAT capabilities including collecting screenshots, recording keystrokes, and**\n\n**capturing video and audio from the webcam and microphones of compromised devices. This kind of attack, in which attackers**\n\n**compromise normally trusted websites and serve malicious code to specific visitors, is often referred to as a �strategic web**\n\n**compromise.**\n\n**Palo Alto Networks identified the compromise after a computer belonging to a “globally recognized organization in the oil and gas�**\n\n**industry” visited the URL containing the malicious code. While the report does not attribute the attack to a specific actor, it notes that�**\n\n**the choice of the President’s website as a vector suggests that individuals or organizations engaged in political relations with Burma**\n\n**may have been the intended target.**\n\n**[In August 2015, Arbor Networks released a report documenting a similar strategic web compromise against a Myanmar Ministry of](https://asert.arbornetworks.com/defending-the-white-elephant/)**\n\n**Information website (http://www.moi.gov[.]mm) hosting content related to the Myanmar Motion Picture Development**\n\n**Department. Similar to the previous attack against the President of Myanmar website, an IFRAME was injected into the site that**\n\n**pointed to a malicious file in the Drupal themes folder. The malware in this attack is from the PlugX malware family, which�**\n\n**[has similar RAT functionality as EvilGrab.](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/112/pulling-the-plug-on-plugx)**\n\n**The malware used “Kpsez-htday” as a Command and Control (C2) authentication string, which may be a reference to the Kyaukpyu**\n\n**Special Economic Zone. Arbor Networks also identified common C2 domains used by this malware, and the Evilgrab malware�**\n\n**reported by Palo Alto Networks:**\n\n**usafbi.websecexp[.]com**\n\n**usacia.websecexp[.]com**\n\n**webhttps.websecexp[.]com**\n\n**appeur.gnway[.]cc**\n\n**Arbor Networks further identified PlugX malware hosted on the website of the Union Election Commission�**\n\n**(http://www.uecmyanmar[.]org), a national level electoral commission in Burma.**\n\n**[PlugX uses a technique called DLL sideloading, in which a legitimate executable runs a malicious DLL. This malicious code then](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/legacy/resources/pdfs/fireeye-dll-sideloading.pdf)**\n\n**decrypts and decompresses the binary file in memory which contains the main malicious functionality. Since the malicious code is�**\n\n**being run by a signed, legitimate executable, and the payload never exists unencrypted on disk, it is more difficult for antivirus�**\n\n**programs to detect the malware. The PlugX sample found on the Union Election Commission website used a legitimate executable**\n\n**signed by McAfee.**\n\n**The overlapping C2 servers that link the PlugX attacks to the previous Evilgrab reported by Palo Alto Networks suggest that either**\n\n**the same attack group is responsible for the two attacks, or that multiple groups are using the same infrastructure.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This report analyzes two targeted malware attacks against an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. These**\n\n**attacks have technical and contextual links to previously reported attacks on Burmese government websites, and are also linked to**\n\n**attack campaigns against Tibetan groups. We conclude that at least two scenarios are possible: these attacks are being conducted**\n\n**by the same attackers, or multiple attack groups are sharing infrastructure and development resources.**\n\n## Attack 1\n\n**On June 5, 2015, staff members of the NGO received an email with the subject “Japanese firms apply to operate in SEZs Permit.”�**\n\n**[This subject line matches the title of an article published by online news organization Eleven Myanmar about Japanese insurance](http://elevenmyanmar.com/business/japanese-firms-apply-operate-sezs)**\n\n**companies activities’ in Burma’s Thilawa Special Economic Zone.**\n\n**The email body contained the following content:**\n\n\n**“Dear all,**\n**Japanese firms apply to operate in SEZs Permit.�**\n\n**[Redacted Google Drive link]**\n\n\n**The NGO was suspicious of the email, as it appeared to be sent from an email address that closely resembled (but did not match),**\n\n**the address of an individual in the organization.**\n\n**The Google Drive link in the body connects to a file ‘Permit.zip’. This zip folder contains �Permit.jpg.lnk, a shortcut that opens a**\n\n**command prompt to download and run ca-bundle.exe from the Chinese forum site hjclub.info**\n\n**(hxxp://www.hjclub.info/bbs/uploadfiles/45/ca-bundle.exe’,’%TEMP%\\ca-bundle[.]exe). When executed, �ca-bundle.exe drops a**\n\n**self-extracting archive (AwViewWx.exe) that contains the three components of PlugX, a signed legitimate executable, a malicious**\n\n**DLL, and a binary file containing the main payload.�**\n\n**In this case the malware uses a McAfee Oem module as its legitimate executable (MD5:**\n\n**884d46c01c762ad6ddd2759fd921bf71) with a certificate that expired in 2008. This executable is the same one used in the�**\n\n**PlugX sample reported by Arbor Networks.**\n\n**The malware connects to the C2 t2.mailsecurityservice[.]com and t1.mailsecurityservice[.]com, which resolve to**\n\n**[118.193.212.98, a server registered to a customer in Shanghai, China, according to WHOIS results. We found an additional](http://who.is/whois-ip/ip-address/118.193.212.98)**\n\n**malware sample (MD5:15c926d2602f65be0de65fa9c06aa6c6) hosted on the C2 at the address**\n\n**hxxp://client.mailsecurityservice.com/ViewClient/connect.php?n=zxishanchu1106[.]exe. This sample also**\n\n**uses t2.mailsecurityservice[.]com as a C2.**\n\n## Attack 2\n\n\n-----\n\n**The email body contained the following content:**\n\n\n**Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to…**\n\n**[Redacted Google Drive link]**\n\n\n**The Google Drive link connects to a zip file “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.zip”.�**\n\n**The zip archive includes two files: a benign document “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About�**\n\n**Reforms.docx.” and a Windows Screensaver file that contains malware “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to�**\n\n**Concerns About Reforms.scr”. The .scr file includes a Microsoft document icon to trick recipients into thinking it is a document file.�**\n\n**The file is actually a self extracting RAR archive that drops three files: a legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, and a binary file�**\n\n**with the payload.**\n\n**While these three components are similar to the structure of PlugX, the malware used in this attack is the 3102 variant of the 9002**\n\n**malware family. The variant is labeled 3102, because it always uses the string “3102” in its first communications with a C2 server.�**\n\n**The legitimate executable is labeled “lsass.exe” presumably to make it appear to look like a Windows system file when it is run.�**\n\n**What appears to be a DLL used for error handling XLBugHandler.dll is actually malicious.**\n\n**To bypass certificate warnings, the malware uses a genuine code-signing certificate signed by Shenzhen Thunder Networking�**\n\n**Technologies Ltd. on August 3 2015, which relative to other attacks we have observed is an unusually recent signature.**\n\n**The malware connects to the C2 198.44.190.85. This IP is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosted in the US and owned by**\n\n**[VpsQuan, a company that markets international IP addresses (thus helping to bypass China’s Great Firewall) to Chinese citizens.](http://www.vpsquan.com/)**\n\n# Connections with Previously Reported Attacks\n\n**The attacks against the environmental NGO share features with the recent strategic web compromises against Burmese**\n\n**government websites and to campaigns targeting the Tibetan diaspora.**\n\n## Connections to Campaigns Targeting Burmese Government Websites\n\n**The PlugX malware used in Attack 1 shares common features with the malware identified by Arbor Networks on the websites of the�**\n\n**Myanmar Ministry of Information and the Union Election Commission. Similar to the malware used in Attack 1, the PlugX samples**\n\n**found on the Ministry of Information website also rely on a McAfee Oem module for the DLL side loading attack. The sample found**\n\n**on the Union Election Commission website has closer similarities, as it uses the same legitimate McAfee executable (MD5**\n\n**884d46c01c762ad6ddd2759fd921bf71) that we found in Attack 1.**\n\n**In addition, the time frame of the attacks (May and August 215) and the campaigns identified by Arbor Networks and Palo Alto�**\n\n**N** **k** **b** **dl** **i** **il** **(J** **d A** **2015)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Our analysis of Attacks 1 and 2 uncovered similarities in attack vectors, infrastructure, and malware with campaigns against groups**\n\n**in the Tibetan diaspora.**\n\n**The use of Google Drive in the environmental NGO attacks is interesting as we have seen the same tactic used to deliver malware**\n\n**to Tibetan organizations during campaigns over May to July 2015. The use of Google Drive in these campaigns occur as Tibetan**\n\n**[groups are promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending file attachments� to prevent infection from document-based](https://www.cybersuperhero.net/safer-file-sharing/)**\n\n**malware. Beyond this common tactic, we also see infrastructure overlap that links the attacks to previous campaigns against**\n\n**Tibetan groups.**\n\n**The C2 domain mailsecurityservice.com that was used in Attack 1 was registered with the same email**\n\n**[(wojiaojilao2@sohu.com) as another C2 domain iyouthen.com that we identified on VirusTotal�.

The Palo Alto Networks report suggests that these attacks have also affected industry groups interested in**\n\n**[the region. Our analysis provides yet another example of a civil society group targeted as part of a wider campaign that includes](https://targetedthreats.net/)**\n\n**government and the private sector. The threat actors responsible appear to be interested in monitoring the activities of groups with a**\n\n**stake in international investment and natural resource development in Burma. However, while industry groups and governments**\n\n**may benefit from well-resourced enterprise security support, civil society organizations typically �do not have access to the same**\n\n**resources.**\n\n**The further connections to previous campaigns against Tibetan organizations can be interpreted in two ways: either the attack**\n\n**group is the same, or there is a degree of infrastructure and tool sharing between multiple threat actors. Sharing between groups**\n\n**[could be informal, or be coordinated via what Ned Moran describes as a “digital quartermaster,” which maintains and supplies threat](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)**\n\n**infrastructure and malware development resources to multiple groups.
