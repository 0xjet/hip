If this date is correct, this would suggest @okta failed to publicly](https://twitter.com/okta)\nacknowledge any breach for at least two months.\n\nLAPSUS$ used off-the-shelf tooling from GitHub for the majority of their attacks. After\ndownloading Process Explorer and Process Hacker, LAPSUS$ bypassed the FireEye\n\n\n-----\n\nendpoint agent by simply terminating it! 3/N\n\nLAPSUS$ was able to create backdoor users in Sitel's environment after retrieving an Excel\ndocument conspicuously titled \"DomAdmins-LastPass.xlsx\" `. 5/N\n\n\n-----\n\nThe LAPSUS$ ransomware group has claimed to breach Okta sharing the following images\nfrom internal systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**This Thread may be Removed Anytime!**\n\nTwitter may remove this content at anytime! Save it as PDF for later use!\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshots are very worrisome. In the pictures below, LAPSUS$ appears to have\ngotten access to the [@Cloudflare tenant with the ability to reset employee passwords:](https://twitter.com/Cloudflare)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see how LAPSUS$ originally began investigating their compromised host on\nJanuary 19th, 2022. With little regard for OPSEC, LAPSUS$ searched for a CVE-202134484 bypass on their compromised host and downloaded the pre-built version from GitHub.\n2/N\n\n[https://twitter.com/KLINIX5/status/1451558296872173577](https://twitter.com/KLINIX5/status/1451558296872173577)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Rant about how @Bugcrowd and](https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd) [@Hacker0x01 setup their platforms to let vendors who](https://twitter.com/Hacker0x01)\n[host private programs abuse researchers. Entirely based on a true story with @Bugcrowd in](https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd)\nmy case. This is for my [#bugbounty friends out there. 1/n](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/bugbounty)\nLAPSUS$ finished off their attack by creating a malicious \"email transport rule\" to forward all\nmail within Sitel's environment to their own accounts. 6/N docs.microsoft.com/en\n\n-----\n\nus/exchange…\n\nNew documents for the Okta breach: I have obtained copies of the Mandiant report detailing\nthe embarrassing Sitel/SYKES breach timeline and the methodology of the LAPSUS$ group.\n1/N\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1506107157124722690](https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1506107157124722690)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nMy questions for Okta: You knew that the machine of one of your customer support members\nwas compromised back in January. Why didn't you investigate it? Having the capability to\ndetect an attack is useless if you aren't willing to respond. 7/N\n\nEven when Okta received the Mandiant report in March explicitly detailing the attack, they\ncontinued to ignore the obvious signs that their environment was breached until LAPSUS$\nshined a spotlight on their inaction. 8/N\n\nFor the Sitel Group: Why weren't your customers immediately informed upon the first sign of\ncompromise? Why did your customers have to wait two months to even hear that you were\nbreached? 9/N\n\n\n-----\n\nSitel Group serves many more customers than Okta. Often times, for support staff to perform\ntheir jobs, they need Administrative privileges into their customer's environment. The attack\nhighlights the increased risk of outsourcing access to your org.'s internal environment. 10/N\n\nGood questions to ask include: Who knows how your sub-processors handle their own\nsecurity? As we saw in this case, Sitel didn't take the security of their environment very\nseriously. What can an attacker do if one of your sub-processors becomes compromised?\n11/N\n\nAnyone hiring? 😂 12/N\n\n[https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1508820739968880640](https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1508820739968880640)\n\nWould like to clarify some misconceptions I've seen. No, this data is not attorney-client\nprivileged. None of what I shared is from my organization and it was obtained entirely\nindependently. I did not break any NDA/contract. 13/N\n\n                               - • •\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?
