In addition, we found that another actor could have been somewhat\ninvolved in the LockBit and/or the ALPHV RaaS program. After pivoting from its avatar, we\nfound with medium high confidence that the ransomware brand was inspired by a cult\nRussian movie where the Black Cat gang leaves a cat drawing or an actual cat at the scene\nof the crime.\n\nLast but not least, we found a running tool being leveraged by affiliates of ALPHV to\ndownload and run payloads upon an attack, from a remote server, which possesses strong\ncode overlap with the LockBit’s running tool.\n\nAt the end of the document, we provide actionable intelligence to strengthen relevant\n**layers of defences seeking to reduce or pre-empt the impact of this emerging threat.**\n\n### Table of contents\n\n## Intrusion Set\n\n### Description/Chronology\n\n\n-----\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the first attack that deployed ALPHV **RaaS was reported by**\n[Symantec.

Upon our analysis we already found some probable victims\nthat remained under the scope of the cybersecurity community so far. From the limited\namount of data available one can highlight that, as it is commonly observed, the most\ntargeted countries are primarily American and then European.

ALPHV owns a business-oriented\npremium account that costs about one hundred dollars per year, which shows the intention of\nthe latter to weight into the RaaS landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 : On the left, a screenshot taken on December 28, 2021 from a random channel of\n_the Russian cybercrime Forum XSS. ALPHV operator replied to the trolling post of another_\n_user named Kelegen (on the right) claiming that the LockBit Dedicated Leak Site was pwned._\n_The premium account ‘ALPHV’ was created on December 9, 2021 and has posted so far_\n_only this short message._\nAn analysis from Korean **Threat Intelligence** **[S2W Lab company pinpointed that like other](https://medium.com/s2wblog/blackcat-new-rust-based-ransomware-borrowing-blackmatters-configuration-31c8d330a809)**\n**RaaS ransomgangs, a config file is leveraged as an input to endow the ransomware with**\ncustom features tailored for the victims (see Analysis for details). Of note is the strong\noverlap with the config file previously used by BlackMatter. From the timeline provided by\n**S2W though, they conclude that it would have been too soon for ALPHV to rebrand from**\n**BlackMatter while rewriting from scratch a DLS (Dedicated Leak Site)and a RUST-based**\nransomware. This could substantiate at the first glance an attribution to the REvil ransom\ncartel whom first shutdown occurred in July 2021 and then was hacked and forced offline\nafter a comeback since the end of October this year but there is too little material at the time\nof writing to conclude.\n\nAs far as BlackMatter is concerned however, technical evidences such as the encryption\n[routine study and code similarities show that BlackMatter signed the come-back of](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/blackmatter-ransomware-analysis-the-dark-side-returns/)\n**Darkside core teams. This revival took place at the moment of Darkside’s disappearance**\nfollowing its infamous Colonial Pipeline major attack. We shall then recall the genesis of\n**Darkside, which was born in August 2020 when pentesters firstrent REvil** **RaaS (operated**\nby Pinchy Spider) until Carbon Spider operated its own variant based on the code of REvil\nthat became Darkside. To conclude on that first part, we thus underline past ties between\n**Revil and Darkside as well as more recently between Darkside and BlackMatter.**\n\nAs far as the ransomware code is concerned we shall underline that BlackMatter is a\n[mashup between LockBit, Darkside, and REvil.](https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2021/09/05/BlackMatterRansomware/#ransom-note)\n\n\n-----\n\nA possible scenario would be that at least one actor (affiliate and/or operator and/or web\ndeveloper) with recent or past ties to Darkside/BlackMatter/REvil decided to jump into a\nnew RaaS program referred to as ALPHV, but this assumption remains speculative at this\nstage.\n\nFrom another interesting conversation on the RAMP forum about the withdrawal of\n**[BlackMatter and assumptions on their next move, an avatar named BlackCat46also arouse](http://10.10.0.46/hxxp://rampjcdlqvgkoz5oywutpo6ggl7g6tvddysustfl6qzhr5osr24xxqqd%5B.%5Donion/members/blackcat46.164/)**\nour interest (see Figure 3). Indeed, it turns out that the latter participated in the past not only\nin a similar conversation on the Russian cybercrime XSS forum with the same account\nname, but also in other topics involving the LockBitSupp account.\n\n_Figure 3_\n\n_Screenshot taken from Russian cybercrime XSS forum, displaying that LockBit claims to_\n_know the operator of ALPHV, a former member of the infamous REvil group, and that_\n_BlackCat46 liked this assumption. Its avatar on XSS and Exploit, both major Russian-_\n_speaking cybercrime forums, represent a picture of the famous Russian revolutionary LENIN_\n_taken in Gorki where he spent the last year of his life._\nThis could show that the latter has a particular interest in BlackMatter and a kind of\n‘friendship’ with the LockBit operator; at the very least, a cross-analysis of its avatar content\nshows a particular tropism for RaaS programs.\n\nIn addition to that, the most recent avatar on RAMP of BlackCat46 is an angry cat, which\nobviously reminds the free black cat icon that was chosen by ALPHV for private onion\nnegotiation sites (also angry). By reverse image search analysis, we found its RAMP avatar\n[on an entertainment website illustrating a 1979 cult film upon the Former Soviet Union called](https://zlodei.fandom.com/ru/wiki/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0_(%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0))\n‘The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed.’ The plot synopsis is not without remembering\n\n\n-----\n\nwhat could experience members of RaaS programs in which a gang of armed robbers calling\nitself “The Black Cat” keeps evading capture. Even more striking is the bleeding knife\nwebsite icon used for the crime investigation category that turns out to be the very same\nused on the public DLS of ALPHV (see Figure 4). We retrieved the link between those two\nobserved website icons by ALPHV on their Private and Public DLS.\n\n_Figure 4 :_ _On the left, the profile of BlackCat46 on RAMP forum. On the right, an illustration_\n_obtained by reverse image analysis of the BlackCat46 avatar on RAMP forum linked to a cult_\n_Russian movie where the Black Cat gang leaves a cat drawing or an actual cat at the scene_\n_of the crime. The knife icon of the website used for the crime investigation category matches_\n_the one used by ALPHV on their Public DLS._\nBased on topics and conversations in which BlackCat46 is involved, we think that his profile\ncould fit the one of an affiliate being involved in RaaS program with pentesting skills. More\n[interesting is that the latter requested help to protect against DDOS attacks on the](http://10.10.0.46/hxxps://forum.exploit%5B.i%5Dn/topic/198881/?tab=comments#comment-1260078)\naforementioned Russian cybercrime forum known as ‘Exploit’ (with the same Lenin avatar\npicture and account name BlackCat46 than was observed on XSS). This recalls the fact that\n**ALPHV named and shamed LockBit, which recently suffered DDOS attacks right after the**\nlatter defrayed the chronicle by leaking very sensitive data of Accenture on their centralized\nDLS reachable by a unique onion domain. It is assumed that the hack back was triggered by\nvictims’ third parties assisting with incident response and/or US agencies according to\n**LockBit operator. As a result, one could conjecture that BlackCat46 could have been**\nsomewhat involved into the LockBit **RaaS program and/or the ALPHV one to avoid being**\nhacked back by DDoS attacks.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Frontend and backend analysis of DLS\n\n\n-----\n\n**[S2W Lab also showed that the frontend developing was carried out in three stages. First, a](https://medium.com/s2wblog/blackcat-new-rust-based-ransomware-borrowing-blackmatters-configuration-31c8d330a809)**\nPrivate Leak Site was used (now down) that became a unique Public Dedicated Leak Site\n(DLS) while negotiation site are unique per victim. For this, a UUID is generated via the\ncommand:\n\n_cmd /c wmic csproduct get UUID_\n\nThis command is used to generate an access key being required to reach the correct URL\nfollowing this scheme:\n\n_hxxp://Av3TorUniqueHiddenWebAddress[.]onion/?access-key=${ACCESS_KEY}”_\n\n**As far as the Public Leak Site of** **ALPHV is concerned, its technology relies for the**\nfrontend on **[Angular, which enhances users experience with single page applications. This](https://github.com/angular/angular)**\nextensively used open source framework is coupled to zone.js to reduce UI refreshing when\nchange detection occurs.\n\nFrom our experience, this web technology is not often encountered and translates good skills\nin terms of web developing. The web developer could be a dedicated person and not\nnecessarily the operator maintaining in operational conditions the infrastructure. As a result,\nan automated survey of their Public Dedicated Leak Site (DLS) by CTI teams is more\ndifficult. Fortunately we found a workaround to provide information on victims that can be\ningested in an automated way:\n\n_Content available in the Private release_\n\n**Concerning the backend, this group claims to have learned from other ransom-cartels’**\nmistakes such as Conti, which recently saw their servers uncovered by the Prodaft Threat\nIntel team. Also peculiar is the generation of a unique onion domain per each new\n**company hit by ALPHV ransomware. This change of modus operandi was most likely driven**\nby the intention to reduce the impact of the aforementioned DDOS attack.\n\n**ALPHV offer an intricate affiliate program (see appendix) with self-deletion scripts, a built-in**\nBitcoin mixer integrated, which does not communicate with the ALPHV infrastructure\nbackend. The latter is fragmented into nodes that are interconnected through a whole\nnetwork of pads within the onion network being behind a Network Address Translation (NAT)\nso genuine IP addresses are not directly accessible from the internet and are protected by a\nfirewall.\n\n### Analysis of the Ransomware-as-a-service program\n\nSince early December 2021, the operator of ALPHV has been promoting its RaaS program\non the underground Russian forums RAMP (see an English translation in appendix) inviting\nother criminals to join ransomware attacks against large companies. The operator mentioned\n\n\n-----\n\nlater that only Russian speaking affiliate could join the program either by payment or by skill.\nIt is worth mentioning though that overall, more and more Chinese translations are found on\nunderground forums in a sort of an objective alliance between countries of Commonwealth of\nIndependent States and China black hats against western countries. The operator claims\nthat the malware can encrypt data on systems running Windows, Linux and VMware ESXi,\nand partners will receive 80% to 90% of the final ransom, depending on the total amount\nreceived from the victims.\n\n_Figure 5 : ALPHV operator named RANSOM joined the RAMP forum the 8th December,_\n_2021 and depicted the day after its RaaS affiliate program. RAMP is a Russian-speaking_\n_underground forum that was launched in July 2021. The operator of RAMP was linked to the_\n_operator of Babuk and Payload.bin. N.B: we translated this page into English._\n**ALPHV operators were also seen on another underground Russian forum known as Exploit**\n(see Figure 6) where they were actively recruiting pentesters specialized in Windows/Linux\nand ESXi. In the same post, they shared two TOX addresses and a jabber address to\ndiscuss in a secure environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 : Screenshot taken from the Exploit underground forum showing the active_\n_recruiting process engaged by ALPHV to collaborate with pentesters specialized in_\n_Windows/Linux and ESXi. They shared two TOX addresses and a Jabber to discuss in a_\n_secure environment._\n**Focusing now on the ransomware anatomy, the latter encrypts selected files throughout a**\nwhitelist and adds custom extensions to infected files (7 length extension such as .sykffle\nwas so far witnessed in the wild for this program and most of the time chosen randomly). A\npeculiar trait of this ransomware upon deployment is its ability throughout command-line to\napply numerous options (reachable via –help). Available features are presented for Windows\nand Linux systems respectively in Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 7 : Features provided by a representative sample of an ALPHV ransomware sample_\n_targeting Windows systems._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 : Features provided by a representative sample of an ALPHV ransomware sample_\n_targeting Linux systems_\nEvery sample can be customized via an embedded JSON configuration file as shown by\n[Bleeping computer that enables common features such as creating a unique access token is](https://github.com/Bleeping/BlackCat-ALPHV-Ransomware)\na previously seen anti-analysis tactic used by similar threats such as for the victim to keep\nnegotiations for private, changing extensions, ransom notes, data encryption, exclusions of\nfolders/files/extensions, and the services and processes to be automatically killed to crank up\nthe impact. Supplying an access token as a parameter is previously seen anti-analysis tactic\nsuch as threats like [Egregor.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/egregor-raas-continues-the-chaos-with-cobalt-strike-and-rclone/)\n\n_Figure 9 : Screenshot of a representative sample of the config file extracted from a Windows_\n_ALPHV ransomware strain. Admin credentials and the victim’s name could be stored and_\n_could leak upon negotiations to the public even before being exposed on ALPHV’s DLS if a_\n_payload is pushed towards a third-party platform. Several features that can be enabled or_\n_disabled make this ransomware very versatile and impactful, in particular the capability of_\n_ESXi VM and Snapshot kill._\n\n\n-----\n\nWe could extract and analyse several outputs of both Linux and Windows samples and\nconfirm the conclusions of S2W (see Figure 9). Of important note is that every successful\nattack stores Admin credentials and the victim’s name into specific fields of the config file that\ncould become public once payloads are submitted to third-party platforms such as Virustotal\n[(please see an obfuscated example displayed via an open-source script).](https://github.com/f0wl/blackCatConf)\n\nEvery compiled sample analysed so far would have been compiled via the emerging Rust\nlanguage, instead of a more commonly encountered C/C++ language. Rust is a multiparadigm programming language, developed by Mozilla in 2010. As a matter of fact, it is the\n[third impactful malware written in Rust language, and the first of a kind as a Ransomware-](https://therecord.media/alphv-blackcat-is-the-first-professional-ransomware-gang-to-use-rust/)\n**as-a-service. Such a peculiar choice was probably made not only because Rust is a cross-**\nplatform language (Windows, Linux, OSX) but also to better evade existing detection\ncapabilities and reverse engineering methods. Moreover, when compared with C/C++\nprogramming language, as Rust applies stricter rules, the latter could be considered more\nsecure by default in the eyes of a programmer. Alternatively the GoLang programming\nlanguage keeps growing fast and is also an open-source project with cross-platform\n[capabilities. The latter was already used for instance by HIVE or](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hive-attacks-analysis-of-the-human-operated-ransomware-targeting-healthcare/) [NEPHILIM RaaS programs](https://twitter.com/vk_intel/status/1281677718376120328)\nto take advantage of the language’s concurrency features to encrypt files faster. However, its\nties with Google might restrain some operators of ransomwares, as Google’s projects in\noverall do not fit the political vision they want to display to the public.\n\n[There are four types of encryption options as described by BleepingComputer (i.e., Full,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alphv-blackcat-this-years-most-sophisticated-ransomware/)\nFast, DotPattern and Auto). All samples of ALPHV use a combination of AES128-CTR and\nRSA-2048 encryption to secure their malware against the researchers getting encrypted files\nback. Amongst the several modes that AES operates with, mostly used is CBC\n(Cipher Block Chaining) while CTR (CounTeR) was witnessed in the past by a few threats\nsuch as **[LockerGoga,](https://www.nioguard.com/2019/03/analysis-of-lockergoga-ransomware.html)** **[Nefilim and](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Hacquebord-etal.pdf)** **[REvil. In the case where (Advanced Encryption](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/07/threat-spotlight-sodinokibi-ransomware)**\nStandard) AES is not supported by the OS and if auto mode option is enabled, ChaCha20\nencryption is applied instead. So far, no weaknesses were found and over all, such new\n**RaaS program is considered by the cybersecurity to be very sophisticated. ALPHV also**\n[mentions that in contrast to what happened to Revil after the massive Kaseya attack, a leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseyas-universal-revil-decryption-key-leaked-on-a-hacking-forum/)\nof a universal decryptor is not possible.\n\nDiving into reverse engineering code analysis of ALPHV ransomware targeting Windows\nsystems, we discuss key functions leveraged by the ransomware and any commonalities\nfound with past known techniques:\n\n_EnumServicesStatusExW: is usually used by ransomwares for enumerating all the_\nactive services with the aim to delete services matching a list (present in the config file\nof ALPHV).

The former reads ARP tables and wake systems up by sending Wake-on-LAN\ncommands (then use RPC to copy itself to identified network shares) while the latter\nretrieves the ARP cache to focus only on network shares to which the victims normally\nconnects to. To be noted beyond Ryuk’ wake-on-LAN peculiar feature is that other\n[RaaS programs borrowed that capability such as LockBit or](https://www.trendmicro.com/fr_fr/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html) [Thanos.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/thanos-ransomware-builder/)\n\n_Figure 10 Command line tool called arp (available on Linux, MacOS and Windows) was_\n_found in the source code of ALPHV ransomware to be used as an ARP scanner feature. The_\n_scanner allows to look for details about the network configuration [T1016]._\nWe are discussing the approach to gather indicators of compromise (IOCs) and define the\ninfrastructure and TTPs leveraged by affiliates of the ALPHV RaaS program and its operator.\n\nBesides, from TLP WHITE indicators of compromise shared by the platform Malware\nBazaar (5 samples were available) we could pivot on VT intel to harvest other reported and\nrelated IOCs (see the Recommendation section for technical details). By pivoting on one\nof the ELF Linux variant samples, a lower sized file named setup.exe (see details in VT [here)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f0a694b6ed97dcf4932ea91b955bd93457d1979ea88a670895094f8771f7e199)\nthat contrasted with the other ransomware payloads has drawn our attention. As no GUID\nidentifier has been found in this file we sought to pivot around artefacts (unique strings into\ncontent file). As such, we could find two other similar files reported into VirusTotal (see Figure\n11).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Screenshot of VirusTotal Intelligence platform after pivoting on a unique string_\n_found into Portable Executable content. The size of the files are very close while the second_\n_one turns out to be linked to another infamous Ransomware group dubbed LockBit._\nThose files are .Net modules and not with a PE more standard format file. We analysed more\n[thoroughly the file by reverse engineering the latter via the open-source tool dnSpy. We first](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)\nwant to point out that no obfuscation is at play, thus all code can be directly rationalized. Four\nmain functions stood out as shown in Figure 12 after reversing the runner used by ALPHV’\naffiliates. It is interesting to note that download and upload functions point to the IP address:\n\n_141.136.44[.]54_\n\nThe latter resolves the host from which was also present the runner setup.exe, meaning that\nransomware payloads were hosted at the same place. We found out, about the same time,\n[that @malwrhunterteam substantiated this result in one of their tweet. Once the runner is](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1476204657823395843)\nlaunched with an access-token set as an input, a messagebox like the one shown in Figure 9\npops up and asks the user whether or not “REALLY RUN LOCKER????”. If the user chooses\n“YES”, an ALPHV ransomware payload will be downloaded from the remote host- and\nexecuted locally.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 Screenshot of the runner setup.exe found to be tight to the ALPHV threat arsenal._\n_Four main functions are at play (DownloadAndRun, FullInfo, Start, UploaddDedInfo and_\n_UploadFiles). Both the runner and the payloads are hosted at hxxp://141.136.44[.]54/files/._\n\n### Commonalities between LockBit2.0 and ALPHV\n\n[After investigations via VT Intelligence we found that the second hash shown in Figure 11](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4067a9a9a9cfc5a4f588883953f64ce6d8c418bfb02b32b2715c9a30bb86ea12)\nwas detected by some antivirus as LockBit ransomware. We thus decided to pursue the\nresearch in that direction and pivot around that IOC. After having unravelled the\ninfrastructure behind that IOC, one can observe in Figure 13 that i the occurrence LockBit is\noften used in namings ii the runner.exe (setup.exe) possesses numerous variants, iii URLs\nfollow the same pattern observed for ALPHV (i.e., _[http://ip_address/files/toolname.exe) and](http://ip_address/files/toolname.exe)_\n_iv the payload name 4mmc.exe was also used by ALPHV (see_ [here an example).](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3a08e3bfec2db5dbece359ac9662e65361a8625a0122e68b56cd5ef3aedf8ce1)\n\nWe checked that the payloads do indeed correspond to LockBit weaponized strains.\n[Moreover we found that the hash value of the tool referred to as screensaver.exe was](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c3ec60b8052e31db149c35080afea5b57b1e8a034386555d12035eb5edefdd68)\nreported by [The DFIR report back in June 2020 upon an attack by LockBit ransomware in](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/10/lockbit-ransomware-why-you-no-spread/)\nwhich an executable that allows to lock out access to the desktop was dropped but was not\nused.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 : Screenshot taken from Virustotal Intelligence platform after having pivoted_\n_around the second hash highlighted in Figure 11 (see blue colour). One can observe several_\n_IOCs that belong to the infamous LockBit ransomware as well as some of its toolset, namely_\n_a screensaver locker, and a runner for downloading payloads for encryption that is similar to_\n_the one that ALPHV used_\nAs we found no direct link of this infrastructure with recent attacks perpetrated by LockBit\naffiliates, the latter could also have been used as a test infrastructure by ALPHV. This is\nsubstantiated by the filename LockBit_gay.exe (see Figure 13) submitted the VT on 2021-1108, which could indicate that an imposter essentially rebranded the tool used by LockBit’\naffiliates and used it for ALPHV’s campaigns. The word ‘gay’ is not without recalling the\nrecent flooded Babuk’s new ransomware forum (RAMP), crippled by a comment spammer\nwith gay orgy porn GIFs. Not only the filenames (setup.exe), their size (in a range of 15-15.5\nKB) but also the source code is obviously strongly overlapping as demonstrated in Figure\n14. The main change arises from the adaptation of the code with the aim to include the antianalysis tactic required for running a payload of ALPHV (i.e., the aforementioned unique\naccesstoken).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure_\n\n_14 Source Code Differencing via Git Diff. Reverse engineering analysis shows that the_\n_source code of the_ _[LockBit’s arsenal (in red) and the ALPHV’s arsenal (in green) are strongly](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4067a9a9a9cfc5a4f588883953f64ce6d8c418bfb02b32b2715c9a30bb86ea12/relations)_\n_overlapping. The main change arises from the adaptation of the code to include the unique_\n_accesstoken per victim required for running a payload of ALPHV._\nIt is hard to conclude at this stage to conclude whether or not ALPHV is a ‘new’ group or not.\nHowever, it suggests that ALPHV at the very least borrowed a part of the LockBit’s toolset,\nwhich requires non-public knowledge. Such knowledge of leveraging a runner for\ndownloading and running ransomwares from remote servers could have been likely shared\nby affiliates that participle sometimes to several ransomware-as-a-service program. It could\nalso be a subgroup of LockBit that split because of internal frictions or a rebrand triggered\nby the core-group of LockBit to take their ransomware to the next generation and escape\nsanctions.\n\n### TTPs\n\n**[Intrusion Set](THREAT ACTOR operating ALPHV and its affiliates’ modus operandi)**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Here is a JSON file format compatible with the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator of shared TTPs of](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/#layerURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Intrinsec/IOCs/main/Ransomware-group_ALPHV_BLACKCAT_NOBERUS/AlphV_intrusion_set_ATT%26CK_Navigator.4.5.5_layer_4.3.json)\nboth representative payloads targeting Linux / Windows systems as well as the operator and\naffiliates modus operandi reported so far.

A unique onion domain is generated for each new company. For each advertiser,_\n_an entrance is provided through its own unique onion domain (hello LockBit)._\n\n_Own datacenter for hosting leak files over 100 TB._\n\n\n-----\n\n_We are already cooperating with top recovery companies that worked with darks, revils, etc._\n\n_There is a support on chats, which sits 24 by 7, but if you wish, you can negotiate yourself._\n\n**_SECURITY_**\n\n_We are in every possible way ready for existence in modern conditions, meeting all the_\n_requirements for the security of infrastructure and advertisements. In the affiliate program all_\n_possible links with forums are architecturally excluded (hello revil), algorithms for self-_\n_deletion of data upon expiration of the limitation period are laid down, a built-in mixer is_\n_integrated with a real break in the chain (not to be confused with Wasabi, BitMix and others),_\n_because you get completely clean coins from foreign exchanges. The wallets to which your_\n_coins were sent are unknown for our backend. The infrastructure is fragmented into the so-_\n_called. nodes that are interconnected through a whole network of pads within the onion_\n_network and are located behind NAT + FW. Even when receiving a full-fledged cmdshell, the_\n_attacker will not be able to reveal the real IP address of the server. (hi Conti)_\n\n**_SOFTWARE_**\n\n_The software is written from scratch without using any templates or previously leaked source_\n_codes of other ransomware. The choice is offered:_\n\n**_4 encryption modes:_**\n\n_-Full – full file encryption. The safest and slowest._\n\n_-Fast – encryption of the first N megabytes. Not recommended for use, the most unsafe_\n_possible solution, but the fastest._\n\n_-DotPattern – encryption of N megabytes through M step. If configured incorrectly, Fast can_\n_work worse both in speed and in cryptographic strength._\n\n_-Auto. Depending on the type and size of the file, the locker (both on windows and * nix /_\n_esxi) chooses the most optimal (in terms of speed / security) strategy for processing files._\n\n_-SmartPattern – encryption of N megabytes in percentage steps. By default, it encrypts 10_\n_megabytes every 10% of the file starting from the header. The most optimal mode in the ratio_\n_of speed / cryptographic strength._\n\n_2 encryption algorithms:_\n\n_-ChaCha20_\n\n_-AES_\n\n\n-----\n\n_In auto mode, the software detects the presence of AES hardware support (exists in all_\n_modern processors) and uses it. If there is no AES support, the software encrypts files_\n_ChaCha20._\n\n_Cross-platform software, i.e. if you mount Windows disks in Linux or vice versa, the_\n_decryptor will be able to decrypt the files._\n\n**_Supported OS:_**\n\n_– All line of Windows from 7 and higher (tested by us on 7, 8.1, 10, 11; 2008r2, 2012, 2016,_\n_2019, 2022); XP and 2003 can be encrypted over SMB._\n\n_– ESXI (tested on 5.5, 6.5, 7.0.2u)_\n\n_– Debian (tested on 7, 8, 9);_\n\n_– Ubuntu (tested on 18.04, 20.04)_\n\n_– ReadyNAS, Synology_\n\n_Since recently binaries have been leaking to analysts, and premium VT allows you to_\n_download samples and receive readme in chats, random people may appear who can_\n_disrupt negotiations (hello darkside), when launching the software it is MANDATORY to use_\n_the –access-token flag. The cmdline arguments are not passed to the AVers, which will keep_\n_the privacy of the correspondence with the victim. For the same reason, each encrypted_\n_computer generates its own unique ID used to separate chats._\n\n_There is a function of automatic downloading of files from the MEGA service, you give a link_\n_to the files, they are automatically downloaded to our servers._\n\n_You can get a full description of all functionality in the FAQ section._\n\n**_ACCOUNT_**\n\n_If there is no activity for two weeks, your account will be frozen and subsequently deleted. To_\n_avoid this, we recommend that you notify the administration about possible vacations,_\n_pauses and other things._\n\n_The rate is dynamic and depends on the amount of a single payment for each company,_\n_namely:_\n\n_– up to 1.5M $ – 80%_\n\n_– up to $ 3.0M – 85%_\n\n_– from $ 3.0M – 90%_\n\n\n-----\n\n_After reaching the $ 1.5M mark in terms of the sum of all payments on your account, you will_\n_have access to hosting services for files of companies’ leaks, dialing and DDoS’a absolutely_\n_free._\n\n### FAQ dedicated to its affiliates (published on the public DLS of ALPHV)\n\n**_Wed Nov 17 2021_**\n\n_How – To_\n\n_How to start a locker on ESXi or * nix?_\n\n1.

Besides, all common ports are\nsecurely filtered or closed but the 80 (http), amongst which, a RDP port is available and very\noften used as the entry vector by brute forcing weak accounts. Passive HTTP server banners\nreveals that the attacker has set up an Apache server (with a current version installed being\n[2.4.29 though a 2.4.52 version was released the 2021-12-20) on an Ubuntu Linux](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#apache24)\ndistribution. The attackers have added a module to compress the traffic as shown by a\npassive analysis of the banners (content-encoding: gzip), most likely to lure malware\nscanners and keep surmise while upload/download operations get faster.\n\nWe found two domains that resolved to that the given IP address:\n\n**support-global-it-ss[.]com**\n\n**hosting-global-it-ss[.]com**\n\nThe homepages indicates that those websites proposes IT support services, which seem to\nbelong to the same structure and could be legitimate. No direct link with the malicious\nactivities emanating from the given IP could be established.\n\n**Do you want to know more about adversaries’ TTPs and emerging threats targeting**\n**your organization?
