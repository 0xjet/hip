This iteration is targeted towards victims in Vietnam and still maintains extremely low\nAV detection almost a year after it was first discovered. Despite having been in the wild for an extended period of time, the operation appears\nto still be active. During our analysis, we were able communicate directly with the command and control server as recently as early June 2017.\n\nWhile there seem to be similarities to an OceanLotus sample discovered in May 2015, a variety of improvements have been made since then.\nSome of the improvements include the use of a decoy document, elimination of the use of command line utilities, a robust string encoding\nmechanism, custom binary protocol traffic with encryption, and a modularized backdoor.\n\n## Infection Vector\n\nThe new OceanLotus backdoor is distributed in a zip file. While we don’t have direct evidence for the initial infection vector we presume it’s\nmost likely via an email attachment. Once the user has extracted the zip file, they see a directory containing a file with a Microsoft Word\ndocument icon. The file is actually an application bundle, which contains executable code. (see Figure 1). Once the user double clicks on the\npurported Word document, the Trojan executes and then launches Word to display a decoy document.\n\nThe malware uses the decoy document to help mask the execution of the malware. This technique is a common one for Windows-based\nmalware, but rare on macOS. In order to achieve this layer of obfuscation, the malware author had to trick the operating system into believing\nthe folder is an application bundle despite the .docx extension. Traditionally, macOS malware have emulated legitimate application installers\nsuch as Adobe Flash, which was how the previous version of OceanLotus was packaged.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Context menu and file listing_\n\nOnce the application bundle is launched, it opens a hidden file in the bundle’s Resources folder named .CFUserEncoding which is a passwordprotected Word document (see Figure 2). It also copies this file to the executable path and essentially replaces the application bundle after\npersistence has been set up. This would lead the victim to believe that nothing was amiss, as they thought they were opening a Word\ndocument and a Word document opened. In this case, the Word file has the name “Noi dung chi tiet.docx”, which is Vietnamese for “Details.”\n\n_Figure 2. Decoy document prompts for a password to open the file_\n\n## Persistence\n\nCompared to the previous version of this backdoor, the persistence mechanism for this remained largely the same. This version creates a\n[Launch Agent that runs when the victim host starts up, where as in the previous version execution was upon when a user logs in. It also](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html)\ncopies itself to a different location and filename based on the UID of the user who ran the application.\n\nFor a user other than root, it takes the MD5 hash of the structure returned by getpwuid() and breaks the hash down into segments <first 8\n_chars of hash>-<next 16 chars of hash>-<last 8 chars of hash>. This segmented MD5 hash is prepended with “0000-“ then used as a directory_\nin ~/Library/OpenSSL/ to store the executable file (see Figure 3). If the user is root, the executable is stored in the system wide library directory\nat /Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the executable and plist locations look like legitimate applications.\n\n**UID** **plist Location** **Executable Location**\n\n0 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mtmfsd.plist /Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs\n\n - 0 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.openssl.plist ~/Library/OpenSSL/0000-<segmented MD5 hash>/servicessl\n\n_Figure 3. plist and executable names and locations based on UID_\n\nOnce the malware has set up persistence, it deletes the application bundle from the executable path leaving the decoy document in its place\nand launches itself as a service from the new location.\n\n## No Command Line Utilities\n\nOne of the first things we noticed about this backdoor is the lack of suspicious strings which often times provides context as to what the\nmalware might do on a victim host. In most macOS malware, calls to the system() or exec() functions to run additional scripts are in place. In\nthis case, these were not present nor were there command line utility strings that may easily convey the malicious intention of the application.\nThis shows a deep level of understanding of the macOS platform by the author of this backdoor compared to other threat actors that will\ncommonly copy and paste scripts from the Internet.\n\n\n-----\n\ne ac o t ese st gs ay a so doub e as a a t a a ys s tec que to a e t e a a e see ess susp c ous, espec a y to bas c stat c\nanalysis.\n\n## String Decoding\n\nSince there appear to be no obvious suspicious strings in plaintext, we move onto the possibility of use of encoded, or obfuscated strings.\n\nThe string decode routine for this backdoor is an upgrade from previous versions in which strings were XOR encoded with the word “Variable”\nas a key. The string decode routine now consists of a combination of bit shifting and XOR operations with a variable key that depends on the\nlength of the string that was encoded. If the computation for the variable XOR key turns out to be 0, the default XOR key of 0x1B is used.\nFigure 4 shows a Python implementation of the decode function.\n\n_Figure 4. Python implementation of the malware’s string decode function_\n\nAfter decoding the strings (see Figure 5), we can glean that the malware sets up persistence, surveys the victim’s computer, and sends this\ninformation back to a server. At this point, it is still not obvious that this malware contains backdoor functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. List of decoded strings_\n\n## Custom Binary Protocol and Encrypted Traffic\n\nThe threat actors responsible for this malware appear to have spent some amount of effort to develop their own custom communication\nprotocol. They did not simply use an off-the-shelf web server for their command and control server, as is commonly done. Instead, they created\ntheir own command and control mechanism.\n\nThe backdoor uses a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, a well-known port that is unlikely to be blocked by traditional firewalls due to its\nuse in HTTPS connections. The packet seen in Figure 6 is encoded with a combination of bit shifting (see Figure 7) and XOR with a key of\n0x1B before it is sent. The bits are always rotated to the left 3 times before doing the XOR operation. This is an improvement from the previous\nversion where the packet was only XOR encoded with a key of 0x1B.\n\n_Figure 6. Initial packet sent by the client to the server_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Bit shifting function used in the encode/decode routine for network packets_\n\nAfter decoding the packet, we can see a breakdown of different fields. Figure 8 shows the initial packet sent by the client to the server. It is\nrelatively empty aside from the “magic” bytes, length of data and type of communication.\n\n_Figure 8. Initial packet sent by the client to the server (decoded)_\n\nDepending on the command response sent from the server, a packet may be bigger than 0x52 bytes. Data beyond 0x52 bytes is zlib\ncompressed then encrypted with AES in CBC mode with a null initialization vector (IV) and a key sent from the server that is padded to 32\nbytes.\n\nWe captured live traffic from the server, and observed that the encryption keys sent from the server are ephemeral. This means that each new\nsession with the server is given a different key used to encrypt data sent back and forth within that session. This is a marked improvement\ncompared to the previous version, where only XOR encoding with a one-byte key was used for encryption.\n\nAfter decoding the packet it receives from the server, the backdoor validates certain fields like the “magic” bytes and makes sure the length of\nthe data being received is not over a certain amount. Throughout the program execution, it also checks and handles any errors that may have\nbeen generated.\n\n## Command and Control Communications\n\nThe command and control server communication sequence is as follows:\n\n1. The client initiates a session with the server by sending a packet with 0x2170272 in the command field.\n2. The server then responds with an ephemeral encryption key and a command.\n3. The client checks if the received packet from the server is valid.\n\n\n-----\n\ne c e t e ecutes t e co a d se t by t e se e a d espo ds t a b co p essed a d S e c ypted b ob o t e esu t t e\nsends this back to the server.\n\nUnlike the previous versions of OceanLotus where the commands can be easily gathered from its strings, the author has obfuscated the\nfunctions with constant values. We decoded the following available commands as seen in Figure 9.\n\n**Command** **Command Description**\n\n0x2170272 Initialize\n\n0x5CCA727 ???\n\n0x2E25992 receive file from server\n\n0x2CD9070 get info on a file / directory\n\n0x12B3629 delete file / directory\n\n0x138E3E6 ???\n\n0x25D5082 execute function from a dynamic library\n\n0x25360EA send file to server\n\n0x17B1CC4 ???\n\n0x18320E0 send victim and computer information together with the backdoor’s watermark\n\n0x1B25503 execute a function from a dynamic library\n\n0x1532E65 execute a function from a dynamic library\n\n_Figure 9. List of commands available_\n\n**Command 0x2170272**\n\nWhen the backdoor is launched, a file is created in /Library/Preferences/.files or ~/Library/Preferences/.files depending on the victim’s user ID.\nThis file (see Figure 10) contains a timestamp and the victim’s name concatenated with the machine’s serial number which is then hashed\ntwice with MD5. This is then copied to a buffer that is 0x110 bytes long and AES encrypted in CBC mode with a null IV and a key of “pth”. It is\nthen saved into the file.\n\nTimestamp + MD5(MD5(<victim’s name + machine serial number>))\n\nAfter this file is created, the client sends its first packet to the server with 0x2170272 in the command field. The server acknowledges and\nresponds with the same command and the client verifies that the file has been created.\n\n\\xa7\\xf1\\xd9*\\x82\\xc8\\xd8\\xfe4137674062B3226FE630C24F7DE1021E\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\\n\n_Figure 10. Decrypted contents of ~/Library/Preferences/.files_\n\n**Command 0x18320E0**\n\nThe server then sends this command with an ephemeral key shortly after it sends the 0x2170272 command. The client gathers all the data\nseen in Figure 11, encrypts it with the key provided by the server and sends it back. One thing to note is the Base64 string that is sent in this\npacket. This string is static in the binary and does not change, which may be indicative of a marker for campaign or version identification.\n\n\\x00\\x00\\x004137674062B3226FE630C24F7DE1021E\\xe9\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00Mac OS X 10.X.X\\xb6\\x03\\x00\\x00\n\n\\x00username\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00localhost\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00Ze0pXcpfbqbS4wD0eS/LVQ==\\xb6\\xbc\\x1cY\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00M\\x00\\x00\\x00/Users/use\n**ABCDEF01-23456789ABCDEF01-23456789/**\n\n**servicessl\\x8b\\xbc\\x1cY\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x00\\x00en0 : AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF[\\x00\\x00\\x00lo0 : fe80::1\\nlo0 : 127.0.0.1\\nlo0 : ::1\\nen0**\n**fe80::aaaa:bbbb:cccc:111\\nen0 : 192.168.1.254**\n\n\\x05\\x01\\x00\\x00f\\x00\\x00\\x00Model ID:iMac8,1\\nCPU:Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU   T7700 @ 2.40GHz\\nMemory:4.00\\nSerial No:XXXXXX\n\n_Figure 11.

This means that additional functionality can be added to this\nbackdoor by loading modules directly from the C2 server.\n\n_Figure 12. Snippets showing loaded function pointers and their parameters_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost macOS malware in the wild today are not very complex, but threat actors have been quickly improving their tradecraft. The increased\nlevel of sophistication and complexity may be indicative of increased targeting of macOS hosts looking to the future. With this OceanLotus\n[attack in combination with recent macOS versions of the Sofacy](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/unit42-sofacys-komplex-os-x-trojan/) [group’s toolset, we have now observed multiple espionage motivated threat](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-xagentosx-sofacys-xagent-macos-tool/)\nactors targeting macOS. It is imperative that the same types of strong security practices and policies organizations use to defend Windows\ndevices are applied universally to include macOS devices as well.\n\nApple has already updated the macOS protection systems to address this variant of OceanLotus.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected and may learn more via the following:\n\nSamples are classified as malicious by WildFire\nDomains and IPs have been classified as malicious and IPS signatures generated\n[AutoFocus users may learn more via the OceanLotus tag](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.OceanLotus)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Hashes**\n\nb33370167853330704945684c50ce0af6eb27838e1e3f88ea457d2c88a223d8b Noi dung chi tiet.zip\n\nb3cf3e3b52b4b899cd0814fc75698ea24f08ce18642665adcd3555a068b5c16d Info.plist\n\n07154b7a45937f2f5a2cda5b701504b179d0304fc653edb2d0672f54796c35f7 Noi dung chi tiet\n\n82502191c9484b04d685374f9879a0066069c49b8acae7a04b01d38d07e8eca0 PkgInfo\n\nf0c1b360c0b24b5450a79138650e6ee254afae6ce8f6c68da7d1f32f91582680 .CFUserEncoding\n\ne84b5c5152d8edf1e814cc4b4975bfe4dc0063ef90294cc96b383f523042f783 info.icns\n\n**C2 Server**\n\ncall[.]raidstore[.]org\n\ntechnology[.]macosevents[.]com\n\npress[.]infomapress[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n[ ]ce t a status[ ] et\n\n93.115.38.178\n\n**Dropped Files**\n\n**UID == 0** **UID > 0**\n\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mtmfsd.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.openssl.plist\n\n/Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs ~/Library/OpenSSL/0000-<segmented MD5 hash>/servicessl\n\n/Library/Preferences/.files ~/Library/Preferences/.files\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
