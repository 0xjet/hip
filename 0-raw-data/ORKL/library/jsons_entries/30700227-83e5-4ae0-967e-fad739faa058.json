The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems\n\nto point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have\n\nshown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries\n\n(Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade\n\nagreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters.\n\nAfter observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014.\n\nThe targeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman\n\nand Jorge Lanata. Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group’s activities\n\nback as far as 2008.\n\nThis report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control\n\ninfrastructure spread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in\n\nVenezuela and Ecuador. Who is responsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat\n\nis sponsored by a state actor or actors, given their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their\n\npersistence. However, we do not conclusively attribute Packrat to a particular sponsor.\n\n# Part 1: Packrat’s Seven Years of Activity\n\nThe authors on this report have been independently investigating malware and phishing campaigns in Latin America.\n\nThis report is the result of discovering that the cases we have been investigating are linked by a common threat actor\n\nwith targeting in several countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. We refer to this threat actor as\n\n**Packrat, to highlight their preference for packed, commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and their retention of the**\n\nsame domains and servers over many years.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1: Some of Packrat’s known targets and activity types\n\nPackrat has systematically targeted high profile political figures, journalists, and others in several countries with malware\n\nand phishing. In total we uncovered 12 different malware command and control domains, and over 30 samples of\n\nmalware stretching over a seven year time period. Packrat also favors an interesting strategy: create and maintain fake\n\nopposition groups and news organizations, then use these to distribute malware and conduct phishing attacks.\n\nSome of these organizations exist in name only, while others have a more elaborate online presence. Packrat has also\n\ncreated elaborate fake news organizations without any evidence we can find of malware or phishing activity.\n\nI 2 P k t’ j ti iti\n\n\n-----\n\ny p g p gy\n\nnetwork infrastructure and activities. For a detailed chronology of the malware used, see 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s\n\n**Implants.**\n\n## Packrat’s Greatest Hits\n\n**2008-2013**\n\nTools and infrastructure used by Packrat suggest that they have been active since at least 2008. During this period,\n\nPackrat used hosting services in Brazil, and some of their malware samples were uploaded from Brazilian IP space to\n\npopular online virus scanning services. Some of the messages they sent also contained Brazilian bait content. While this is\n\nsuggestive of Brazilian targeting, we have yet to find confirmed victims from this period.\n\n**2014**\n\nBy 2014, Packrat was targeting high-profile Argentine lawyer Alberto Nisman, and well-known investigative journalist and\n\ntelevision news host, Jorge Lanata. Maximo Kirchner, son of Argentina’s president, also announced that he was\n\ntargeted. The screenshot he released of the phishing email he received is consistent with what we have seen, although\n\nwe have not been able to verify his claims. In addition, a number of phishing domains with Ecuadorian and Venezuelan\n\ntargeting that we identified became active during this period.\n\n**2015**\n\n2015 seems to have marked an extensive campaign of phishing and malware attacks targeting civil society and public\n\nfigures, including parliamentarians in Ecuador. We observed a range of phishing domains and attacks, often using fake\n\norganizations during this period. We also found fake organizations and possible disinformation campaigns with targets in\n\nEcuador, Venezuela and the Venezuelan diaspora.\n\n## 1.1 Nisman and the Argentine Cases\n\nIn January 2015, controversial Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead of a gunshot under suspicious\n\ncircumstances. Argentine news reported that a malicious file was found on his Android phone by the Buenos Aires\n\n[Metropolitan Police forensic lab. The file was named “estrictamente secreto y confidencial.pdf.jar,” or “strictly secret](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)\n\nand confidential” in English.\n\n[An identically titled file was uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina on the 29th of May, 2015. The file was a remote access](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/aa9aa05af8df2cc99eb936e2d17623a68abdbb60606bb097379457c4a3760116/analysis/)\n\ntoolkit, known as AlienSpy, which allowed an attacker the ability to record the activities of a target, access their email,\n\ntheir webcam, and more. However, the file was built for the Windows operating system, and could not have infected\n\nNisman’s Android phone.\n\n[The initial analysis of the alienspy implant by Morgan Marquis–Boire revealed the command and control server of the](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)\n\nattackers to be deyrep24.ddns.net. In addition to the malware apparently used to target Nisman, Lanata, and Kirchner\n\n(see below), three other samples[[1]] were found which used deyrep24.ddns.net as a command and control domain. One\n\nof these, 3 MAR PROYECTO GRIPEN.docx.jar, was a build of AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants) which masqueraded as a\n\ndocument containing communication between Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Ecuador’s Ambassador to\n\nSweden concerning the acquisition of fighter jets.\n\n[After the finding was made public, other targets came forward. Prominent investigative journalist and television host](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)\n\n[Jorge Lanata revealed that he too had been targeted by the same malware. The president’s son, Maximo Kirchner,](http://pastebin.com/iiAGSMYc)\n\n[also claimed to have been targeted. We were unable to verify Kirchner’s claim, however, a screenshot showing his](http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/196727/an%C3%ADbal-m%C3%A1ximo-kirchner-received-same-virus-as-lanata)\n\n[targeting was included in a report of this claim:](http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=803749)\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\n\nThe email which he claims to have received has an attachment named “Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf.jar”\n\n(size 67.3kb) which is the same as the malware sent to Nisman and Lanata. Additionally, the sender’s email address\n\n[(claudiobonadio88@gmail.com) purports to be well-known judge Claudio Bonadio. This similar to the targeting of Lanata,](mailto:claudiobonadio88@gmail.com)\n\n[who also received an email also claiming to be from Claudio Bonadio (cfed.bonadio@gmail.com).](mailto:cfed.bonadio@gmail.com)\n\n## 1.2 Ecuadorian Campaigns\n\nIn 2015, we began independently receiving a growing number of reports of phishing attacks via e-mail and SMS targeting\n\njournalists and other public figures in Ecuador. Some emails we examined had no political content, but were simple\n\ncredential phishing for social media and email providers, like Gmail. Others, however, had explicit political content\n\nconcerning a range of political figures and issues in Ecuador. Further investigation revealed an extensive campaign, as\n\nwell as many fake organizations (See Section 6: Possible Deception Operations).\n\nOne of the authors developed a Gmail search query for strings associated with the attacks (See Appendix A: The Search\n\n**Query). We shared this query with many potential targets, resulting in hits for phishing attacks, as well as suspicious**\n\nMicrosoft Word (DOCX) files sent to a range of journalists and public figures. These documents contained embedded\n\nRATs written in Java, including Adzok and AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants). Subsequently, using indicators found in the\n\nJAR files, as well as an updated Gmail query we were able to identify a larger set of malicious files and domains used by\n\nPackrat (See Appendix B: Malware Samples).\n\nWe found a dense web of interconnections between phishing and malware sites. Sites often shared registration\n\ninformation, or were hosted from the same servers. We determined that the malware samples typically communicated\n\nwith daynews.sytes.net, which is linked to the Argentine cases. Ultimately, investigation of this infrastructure also revealed\n\nmalware and infrastructure in Brazil, and fake sites in Venezuela.\n\n## 1.3 Shared Command & Control Infrastructure\n\nThis section describes Packrat’s command and control infrastructure in narrative form, Appendix B provides a full list of\n\nCommand & Control domains along with the related binaries and malware families.\n\nPackrat’s deyrep24.ddns.net domain was created on November 7th, 2014, and at the time of Nisman’s targeting,\n\npointed to the IP address: 50.62.133.49. This IP address belongs to a GoDaddy range for dedicated hosting, and on March\n\n3rd, 2015, the domain moved to another GoDaddy IP: 192.169.243.65. Passive DNS records revealed that at the same\n\ntime as this IP was being used by the deyrep24.ddns.net command and control domain, it was being used by the domain\n\n**daynews.sytes.net which had been created on March 1st, 2015. Over the course of our joint investigation we found 5**\n\nsamples of malware using this domain which were used to target journalists and civil society in Ecuador (See Appendix D:\n\n**Seeding Domains for a larger list).**\n\n**Packrat’s Command & Control Infrastructure**\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 4: Packrat’s Command and Control infrastructure [Click image for hires]\n\nSearching for domains related to daynews.sytes.net lead us to taskmgr.serveftp.com which on the August 11th, 2014 was\n\nat the IP address 190.210.180.181, an IP address in Argentina, used by daynews.sytes.net for a brief period when it was first\n\nregistered, before being quickly moved to GoDaddy hosting. The taskmgr.serveftp.com domain also returns to\n\n**190.210.180.181 on multiple dates in October of 2014, and May of 2015. On July 23rd, 2014, taskmgr.serveftp.com was**\n\nhosted at 201.52.24.126, a Brazillian IP address, which was also hosting taskmgr.servehttp.com, and\n\n**taskmgr.redirectme.com. We found a total of 15 malware samples using either taskmgr.servehttp.com or**\n\n**taskmgr.serveftp.com as command and control domains (or both in the case of several samples). The earliest of these**\n\nsamples had a compile time of December 24th, 2008, providing us with the earliest date we know of that Packrat was\n\nactive. While it is possible that this timestamp is faked, we have seen no evidence of this on other samples by these\n\nattackers.\n\n**Packrat’s Command and Control Infrastructure**\n\n**Domain** **Relevant Resolution** **Relevant Date of resolution**\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net 50.62.133.49 November 7th, 2014\n\n192.169.243.65 March 3rd, 2015\n\ndaynews.sytes.net 192.169.243.65 March 3rd, 2015\n\n190.20.180.181 March 1st, 2015\n\ntaskmgr.serveftp.com 190.210.180.181 August 11th, 2014\n\n201.52.24.126 July 23rd, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com 186.220.1.84 June 24th, 2014\n\n201.52.24.126 July 23rd, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\n186.220.11.67 August 15th, 2014\n\ntaskmgr.redirectme.com 201.52.24.126 July 23rd, 2014\n\n186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\nruley.no-ip.org 186.220.1.84 July 11th, 2014\n\n|Domain|Relevant Resolution|Relevant Date of resolution|\n|---|---|---|\n|deyrep24.ddns.net|50.62.133.49|November 7th, 2014|\n||192.169.243.65|March 3rd, 2015|\n|daynews.sytes.net|192.169.243.65|March 3rd, 2015|\n||190.20.180.181|March 1st, 2015|\n|taskmgr.serveftp.com|190.210.180.181|August 11th, 2014|\n||201.52.24.126|July 23rd, 2014|\n||186.220.1.84|July 11th, 2014|\n|taskmgr.servehttp.com|186.220.1.84|June 24th, 2014|\n||201.52.24.126|July 23rd, 2014|\n||186.220.1.84|July 11th, 2014|\n||186.220.11.67|August 15th, 2014|\n|taskmgr.redirectme.com|201.52.24.126|July 23rd, 2014|\n||186.220.1.84|July 11th, 2014|\n\n\n-----\n\n|wjwj.no-ip.org|189.100.148.188|September 6th, 2012|\n|---|---|---|\n|conhost.servehttp.com|186.220.11.67|August 15th, 2014|\n|dllhost.servehttp.com|186.220.11.67|August 15th, 2014|\n|wjwjwj.no-ip.org|179.208.187.216|March 25th, 2014|\n||186.220.1.84|June 24th, 2014|\n|wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org|179.208.187.216|March 25th, 2014|\n\n\nOn July 11th 2014, all ‘taskmgr’ domains were hosted on 186.220.1.84, an IP address in Brazil. At the same time, this IP\n\naddress was hosting ruley.no-ip.org. We managed to find a malware sample[[2]] using both ruley.no-ip.org and\n\n**taskmgr.servehttp.com as command and control domains. On September 6th, 2012, ruley.no-ip.org was hosted at**\n\n**189.100.148.188, another Brazillian IP address, along with two other domains lolinha.no-ip.org and wjwj.no-ip.org. We**\n\nfound two samples configured with all three of these domains as command and control servers, three samples which\n\nused both ruley.no-ip.org and wjwj.no-ip.org, two samples just using wjwj.no-ip.org, and one sample just using ruley.no\n**ip.org. On August 15th, 2014, taskmgr.servehttp.com was hosted on 186.220.11.67, another IP address in Brazil. On the**\n\nsame date, this IP hosted both conhost.servehttp.com and dllhost.servehttp.com. We found two samples configured with\n\nboth conhost.servehttp.com and dllhost.servehttp.com as command and control servers.\n\nIn addition to these domains, the domains wjwjwj.no-ip.org and wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org appear to be related. On March 25th,\n\n2014 both wjwj.no-ip.org and wjwjwj.no-ip.org point to 179.208.187.216. On June 24th, 2014, both taskmgr.servehttp.com\n\nand wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org pointed to 186.220.1.84. We didn’t manage to find malware samples related to either wjwjwj.no\n**ip.org or wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org.**\n\nThe command and control servers behind these domains were hosted with a variety of providers around Latin America,\n\nincluding: Uruguay Montevideo Administración Nacional De Telecomunicaciones, Argentina Buenos Aires Nss S.A.\n\n(IPLAN), and Claro Brazil.\n\nPackrat has also used servers in Europe and the US, including Portlane AB in Sweden and GoDaddy in the United States.\n\nWe have notified hosting providers in order to facilitate the shutdown of Packrat’s infrastructure.\n\n# Part 2: Recent Malware Attacks in Ecuador\n\nPackrat is active in many countries, but it is in Ecuador that we were able to gather the most systematic evidence of their\n\nactivities, as well as connect directly with targets and victims. We are also tracking active attacks against Ecuadorian\n\ntargets at the time of writing.\n\nImage 5: Some of Packrat’s known target groups in Ecuador\n\nUsing email inbox search queries that we shared with potential targets (See: Appendix A), as well as analysis of malware\n\ndatabases and seeding infrastructure, we collected a diverse set of malware and phishing attacks targeting journalists,\n\npublic figures, politicians, and other prominent individuals (see: 5. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns for\n\nexamples).\n\n## 2.1 Previous Reports of Packrat Malware in Ecuador\n\n\n-----\n\nnews organizations, the director of Fundamedios, and others, had received suspicious messages and phishing attempts.\n\n[Fundamedios later updated their reporting to note that Access Now had stated that some of these attacks shared](http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/periodistas-y-activistas-ecuatorianos-atacados-con-el-mismo-software-espia-de-la-computadora-del-fiscal-nisman/)\n\ncommand and control infrastructure with the malware that was reportedly used to target Nisman. There are also\n\nindications on Twitter of phishing attacks and malware. We have been able to link many of these reports to Packrat.\n\n## 2.2 Common Techniques\n\nWe observed a range of social engineering techniques used to send malware to Ecuadorian targets. In the cases where\n\nwe observed seeding, we found that the malware was often accompanied by political bait content, frequently relevant\n\nto Ecuador’s opposition. In other cases, the seeding was personalized to the intended victim. The most common\n\ndelivery mechanism was via Microsoft Word DOCX files containing malicious Java. However, in other cases, attackers\n\nused fake updates.\n\n**Common Seeding Techniques**\n\nEmailed as attached malicious files\nAs links to malware hosted on sites controlled by the attackers\n\nOn Google Drive or Onedrive\n\nPopups or fake update notifications on politically themed / lookalike sites\n\nPackrat often uses email senders and websites in its social engineering that appear similar to real persons and\n\norganizations. For example, they registered ecuadorenvivo.co, which looks like the genuine domain of the Ecuador En\n\nVivo news website (ecuadorenvivo.com). Packrat then sent e-mails purporting to be e-mail news updates (a practice by\n\nthe real Ecuador En Vivo) from the ecuadorenvivo.co domain.\n\nPackrat also sometimes creates identical paths to real news stories, and hides them under clickable links. For example:\n\n**Typical Lookalike Domain**\n\n\n**What the target sees:**\n\nhttp://ecuadorenvivo.com/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html\n\n\n**HREF of the actual malicious link:**\n\nhttp://ecuadorenvivo.co/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html\n\n\n## 2.3 Three Attacks in Detail\n\nTo illustrate Packrat’s approach, this section describes three recent attacks in detail. The attacks date from between\n\nSpring and Fall 2015. Targets of these attacks include Ecuadorian journalists and public figures.\n\n**2.3.1 Attack 1: Email from a fake opposition movement**\n\nThroughout April 2015, multiple targets received e-mails from the “Movimento Anti Correista” (English: “Anti Correa\n\nMovement”), a fictitious group (based on open source searches and consultation with individuals familiar with the\n\nregion) that purports to be opponents of Ecuador’s current president, Rafael Correa. The emails contained a Microsoft\n\nWord DOCX attachment containing Adzok malware (See: Section 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants), as well as text\n\nand graphics to bolster the fiction.\n\n**Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”**\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 6: Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”\n\n\n**Seeding text translation:**\n\n\n**Subject: Foul Play by Rafael Correa Against the Opposition**\n**Body:**\n\nWe are sharing with you this leaked document about President Rafael Correa’s dirty tricks against the opposition\n\n(Open on a PC, this cannot be read on a phone.)Coming soon more leaks on: www[.]movimientoanticorreista.com\n\n\nThe e-mail seems intended for several purposes. It is obviously designed to trick the target into downloading and viewing\n\nthe document, but it also seems to be an effort to establish the legitimacy of the domain, and the identity of the\n\nmovement.\n\n**The Malicious Attachment**\n\n\nName La jugada sucia De Correa ante la oposición.ppt\nType: Microsoft Word Document file (.docx)\n\nMD5: ea7bcf58a4ccdecb0c64e56b9998a4ac\n\n\n-----\n\n[Embedded in this document is software called “Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator.” Analysis of the malware can](http://adzok.com/)\n\nbe found in Section 3: The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants and the configuration of this implant can be found in\n\n**Appendix C: Malware Configuration.**\n\n**2.3.2 Attack 2: You are being spied on!**\n\nThis attack is designed to create a sense of fear and concern in the target, leading to the file being opened. The e-mail is\n\ncustomized for the target’s name, and claims that the target is being spied on by SENAIN, Ecuador’s National\n\nIntelligence Secretariat. The attachment purports to be a list of Twitter users spied on by SENAIN. Interestingly, the\n\npurported sender is “Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in Ecuador’s last presidential election.\n\nImage 8: Email with the purported sender as “Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in\n\nEcuador’s last presidential election\n\n**Seeding text translation:**\n\n\n**Subject: [Target’s Name] spied on by SENAIN**\n\n**Body:**\nGreetings,G.L\n\nNote: Open this on your personal computer. It can’t be opened by smartphones.\n\n\nLike Attack 1, the malware is not delivered with an exploit, but rather requires that the victim double clicks on the file and\n\naccepts any prompts before executing it.\n\n**The document instructs the target to click:**\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 9: Document instructing the target to click\n\n\n**English Translation**\n\n\n**In English: TO READ ALL THE TWEETS DOUBLE CLICK ON THE GRAPHIC OF TWITTER**\n\n\nWhen the image is double clicked, the victim is infected with malware from the AlienSpy family. Examining the\n\nconfiguration file of the malware reveals that the malware uses the the C2 server daynews.sytes.net, which is a domain\n\ncommon to several Packrat attacks. Interestingly, we found that the same document (identical MD5) was re-purposed\n\nfor several other attacks.\n\n**File Name** **MD5**\n\nLOS TUITEROS ESPIADOS POR SENAIN.docx efc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\nLos trinos de Rafael Correa.docx efc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\nDetailed analysis of the malware can be found in Section 3 and the configuration of this implant can be found in\n\n**Appendix C.**\n\n**2.3.3 Attack 3: “Exclusive Information about Correa’s Lies”**\n\nThis attack was served via a link to a fake political website hosting malicious content. The e-mail served to direct the\n\nvictim to the site.

This kind of engagement could be](http://blog.9bplus.com/operators-have-feelings-too/)\n\nconsidered a serious breach of operational security. Packrat took exception to these unwritten rules. It may be that\n\nPackrat has experienced other cases of individuals touching their infrastructure, or attempting to analyze their files,\n\nespecially after some of their infrastructure was exposed. Since Packrat prefers to leave the infrastructure online, they\n\nmay be trying to discourage unwelcome attention.\n\n# 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants\n\nOver the past seven years Packrat has used several different types of malware, much of it off-the-shelf RATs, such as\n\nCybergate, Xtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok. While these malware families are known to researchers, Packrat typically\n\nobfuscates their malware using a range of tools, including: an unknown VB6 crypter, AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact,\n\nPEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator. This layer of obfuscation means that Packrat’s attacks frequently escaped detection by\n\nantivirus when the attacks were deployed. This section describes these tools, roughly grouped into distinct time periods.\n\nImage 12: Packrat malware families\n\n## 3.1. 2008-2014: Packed RATS, mostly CyberGate\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, Packrat made extensive use of off-the-shelf RATs encapsulated in AutoIt3Wrapper, a runtime\n\npacker. This packer is written in AutoIt, a compilable scripting language for automating tasks in Windows. The use of an\n\ninitial obfuscation layer seems to have been enough to thwart or at least misguide detection as well as leverage some\n\n\n-----\n\nother and other Delphi based RATs, SpyNet and Cerberus.\n\nMany of these attacks included embedded decoy Office documents that are opened at execution of the implant, likely\n\nin the context of a targeted attack. Among the documents we found are résumés of purported Brazilian citizens, as well\n\nas purported payment receipts of the Association of Lawyers of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nImage 13: A résumé\n\nThese attacks suggest that Packrat had Portuguese speaking targets during this period. Based on the specifics of the bait\n\ndocuments, it seems likely that they were Brazilian.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe majority of the implants we found were configured to beacon back to a Command & Control,\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com, although a few others include ruley.no-ip.org, lolinha.no-ip.org, and taskmgr.serveftp.com (See\n\n**Appendix B for a complete list).**\n\n**3.1.1 Analysis of CyberGate RAT**\n\nThe CyberGate RAT samples we analyzed were, as mentioned above, typically wrapped in a layer of AutoIt. Code and\n\nstrings found in the binary indicate that it is based on the Spy-Net RAT version 2.6. This RAT was developed by a Brazilian\n\n[hacker using the handle spynetcoder and is outlined on the Spy-Net RAT ‘official’ website.](http://spynet-rat-officiel.blogspot.com/)\n\n**CyberGate’s Infection Routine**\n\nAfter unpacking from the applied runtime packer, CyberGate runs its second stage, which is likeley the infection routine.\n\nThis injects the third stage, a DLL, into a running process. Once implanted, CyberGate then deploys a range of\n\ntechniques for persistence and monitoring.\n\nThe third stage module picks from three execution paths (based on mutexes, which can also be set by a prior infection):\n\nPassword gathering (mutex: “_x_X_PASSWORDLIST_X_x_”)\n\nBlock mouse and keyboard input to any other application (mutex: “_x_X_BLOCKMOUSE_X_x_”)\n\nInfection routine\n\n**CyberGate Anti Analysis**\n\nThe infection routine comes with a set of anti-analysis features packaged in a single function. CyberGate searches for a\n\nrange of virtual and sandbox environments.[[3]] It also checks for user space debuggers through the IsDebuggerPresent\n\nAPI, and for SoftICE and Syser through their respective pipes. The malware performs breakpoint detection on the function\n\nentries of the listed anti-analysis features by checking whether the first byte of each function equals ‘CC’, the\n\nbytecode indicating a breakpoint.\n\nImage 15: CyberGate Anti Analysis\n\n**CyberGate Process Injection**\n\nThe infection routine fetches the encrypted implant from the resource section, and upon decryption attempts to inject its\n\nimplant into the Windows system shell process (explorer.exe). If this fails, CyberGate launches an explorer.exe process on\n\nits own, injects its implant into it, and then completes the setup. Additionally, another instance of the CyberGate implant\n\nis injected into a default browser process, which runs invisibly.\n\nThe infection routine drops a copy of itself into different directories, depending on the Windows version: /System,\n\n/Windows, or /Program Files. The implant’s name varies: taskhost.exe, regedit.exe, or taskmgr.exe are all common. The\n\ninfection routine also writes a copy of the encrypted implant into the %TEMP% directory and names it XX–XX–XX.txt.\n\nTo achieve persistence, the second stage writes registry keys so that CyberGate is run at startup:\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\%GUID%\\StubPath:\n“C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\Run\\Policies:\n\n“C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\msconfig: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\n\n\n**Password Collection**\n\nIf tasked with password collection, the second stage binary grabs passwords from a range of locations, including: the No\nip Dynamic Update Client (DUC), MSN messenger, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The credentials are collected from the\n\nWindows Registry, browser profiles, the RAS dial up settings, Local Security Authority (LSA) settings, MS ProtectedStorage,\n\nMS IntelliForms, and the credential store.\n\n**CyberGate’s Functionality**\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 16: Searching for indicators of an existing Spy-Net\n\ninstallation\n\nThe CyberGate implant comes with the same credential stealing capabilities as the infector, and is extended by routines\n\nto spy on Chrome and STEAM credentials as well. Also inherited from the infector, the implant owns the same anti-analysis\n\nroutine protecting it from sandboxes and debuggers.\n\nBeyond the capabilities seen in the infector, CyberGate has a range of features that provide an attacker with a full\n\nspectrum of monitoring and remote control functionality.\n\nCyberGate capabilities include:\n\nCollecting detailed information about the infected system\nActivation and control of the webcam and microphone\n\nScreenshot capture\nBlocking user input (e.g. keyboard and mouse)\nControl over processes, windows, applications, devices, drive, ports, TCP & UDP connections, the clipboard,\n\nregistry keys and values etc.\nControl over the filesystem\nDownload and execution of further binaries\n\nExfiltration via FTP\nCollection of information on installed security products\n\nInterestingly, CyberGate gathers information on installed security products through the Windows Management\n\nInstrumentation (WMI) by launching cscript.exe on a hardcoded .vbs-script. The script requests name and version number\n\nof installed antivirus and firewall solutions and dumps the data to a file:\n\n\nSet objSecurityCenter = GetObject(“winmgmts:.rootSecurityCenter”)\nSet colFirewall = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From FirewallProduct”,,48)\n\nSet colAntiVirus = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From AntiVirusProduct”,,48)\nSet objFileSystem = CreateObject(“Scripting.fileSystemObject”)\nSet objFile = objFileSystem.CreateTextFile(“%FILEPATH%”, True)\n\nEnter = Chr(13) + Chr(10)\nCountFW = 0\n\nCountAV = 0For Each objFirewall In colFirewall\nCountFW = CountFW + 1\nInfo = Info & “F” & CountFw & “) ” & objFirewall.displayName & ” v” & objFirewall.versionNumber &\n\nEnter\nNextFor Each objAntiVirus In colAntiVirus\nCountAV = CountAV + 1\n\nInfo = Info & “A” & CountAV & “) ” & objAntiVirus.displayName & ” v” & objAntiVirus.versionNumber &\nEnterobjFile.WriteLine(Info)\nobjFile.Close\n\n\nCollected data is stored in dump files on disk and exfiltrated to the remote server component by HTTP or FTP.\n\n**3.1.2 Analysis of XTremeRAT**\n\nXTremeRAT is commercial off-the-shelf malware, often available cracked, and used to monitor victim machines. While\n\n[used by apolitical hackers, XTremeRAT has been extensively used by government-linked malware groups to target the](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-marczak.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile often packed, XTreme RAT itself has limited stealth and persistence functionality. Its monitoring capabilities are also\n\nstraightforward. The versions we analyze here have no code obfuscation. XTreme Rat is implemented as client/server\n\narchitecture, where the infected machine acts as server, while the C&C component is the client.\n\n**This version of Xtreme Rat’s capabilities include:**\n\nLogging keystrokes\nLogging the name of the foreground desktop application\nSniffing the clipboard for passwords\n\nDownloading and executing binaries via HTTP, presumably to install second stage malware\n\nImage 17: Installation of the XTreme RAT keylogger module\n\n**Xtreme RAT operation and keylogging functionality**\n\nThe Xtreme RAT implant sniffs the clipboard contents via the keylogger window, using a clipboard viewer that it also\n\ninstalls. The viewer receives the window message WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD every time the clipboard changes, and provides\n\naccess to Clipboard contents. Clipboard and keylogger data is dumped to a .dat-file that, along with the configuration\n\nfile (.cfg), is located in the […]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows folder for the current user. Both filenames are\n\ndictated by XTreme RAT’s configuration.\n\n**XTreme RAT data files**\n\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.cfg\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.dat\n\n\nThe dump file is exfiltrated via push to FTP. XTreme RAT comes with preconfigured FTP server credential placeholders\n\n(ftpuser/ftppass) to log on to ftp.ftpserver.com, which are then switched for updated values received from the C&C at\n\nruntime.\n\nThe XTreme RAT implant also creates a mutex named following the same naming scheme as configuration and dump file\n\n(e.g. “RJokLSZBjPERSIST”). The RAT’s configuration is fetched from the .rsrc-section and encrypted using RC4, with the\n\n[key “CONFIG”. The same algorithm and key combination has been seen in use before in other variants of XTreme RAT.](https://malware.lu/articles/2012/07/22/xtreme-rat-analysis.html)\n\nThis variant of XTreme RAT uses explorer.exe as a container for remote threads to carry out specific functions. Thread\n\ninjection can happen on at least three occasions.\n\nPossible injections of explorer.exe by XTreme RAT:\n\n**A ‘watchdog’ thread to restore persistence keys, and to locate and run the infector binary.

The\n\n[software began as the free RAT “Frutas,” and was identified in 2013 during a campaign in Mexico. This was](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/cross-platform-frutas-rat-builder-and-back-door)\n\nb tl d t d f i l l th “P i RAT” Ad i d Ad i d ld b h d f $75 f\n\n\n-----\n\n[The software was most recently branded “AlienSpy,” and was again](http://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/FTA_1015_Alienspy_FINAL.pdf) [found by security researchers in targeted spying](http://contagiodump.blogspot.ch/2014/11/alienspy-java-rat-samples-and-traffic.html)\n\n[operations. At the time of this report, the latest re-packaging of this RAT is known as JSocket. For the purposes of this](https://jsocket.org/)\n\nreport, we’ll refer to all variants of this spyware as “AlienSpy.” AlienSpy is a relatively full-featured RAT with a range of\n\nfeatures, such as recording the victim’s keystrokes, audio eavesdropping via a device’s built-in microphone, remote\n\nviewing of the desktop, and the ability to turn on a victim’s webcam “without user notification.” Alienspy has been\n\n[extensively analyzed by malware researchers, including reports by ProofPoint and Fidelis.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/You-Dirty-RAT)\n\n**3.2.1 Packrat’s Alienspy Deployment**\n\nFrom 2014 to early 2015, Packrat’s preferred technique was to send AlienSpy implants as attachments in phishing emails\n\nwith the extension ‘.pdf.jar.’ The default setting in Windows is to hide file extensions, thus making it appear to be a\n\n“.pdf” file. With some minor differences, all the samples from this time period are built in a similar manner. There’s an\n\nouter .jar (Java archive) file containing a folder named META-INF and two files: Favicon.ico and Principal.class. Upon\n\nexecution, Principal.class unzips the contents of “Favicon.ico” (not an icon file, but a .zip archive), and looks for a\n\nfilename containing “.jar”.\n\n**Contents of Favicon.ico**\n\n\n0doc.jar\n\n1Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf\n\n\nOnce it finds the right file (in this case 0doc.jar), it drops it to a randomly-named temp file starting with a constant string\n\nand invokes Java to run it.\n\n**Inside the .jar file from “Favicon.ico”**\n\n\nMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MF\nMANIFEST.MF\nID\n\nplugins/Server.class\nMain.class\nEstrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf\n\n\n[“Main.class” is obfuscated using Allatori, a Russian-origin JVM obfuscator used by AlienSpy.](http://www.allatori.com/)\n\nThis reads part of an RC4 key from the file “ID.” To this it appends a constant string, then uses the full RC4 key to decrypt\n\nthe contents of MANIFEST.MF, which yields the actual Adwind implant JAR file. Others have written about the operation\n\n[and deobfuscation of Allatori, including how to deobfuscate it, here, here, and here.](https://boredliner.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/cracking-obfuscated-java-code-adwind-3/)\n\n**AlienSpy in MS Office Documents**\n\nIn 2015, Packrat started sending AlienSpy implants embedded in .docx files. The method used to obfuscate these files is\n\nmore complex, but ultimately similar to previous techniques. Uncompressing an infected MS Word document reveals a\n\nfile named “oleObject1.bin” under the directories word/embeddings. Opening this file, which is a jar, reveals:\n\n\na\n\nabcdefghijka.class\nabcdefghijkf.class\nabcdefghijkj.class\n\nabcdefghijks.class\nabcdefghijku.class\nabcdefghijkz.class\n\na.txt\nb.txt\n\nc.dat\nkjmhs\nMain.class\n\nMETA-INF\n\n\nSimilar to the obfuscation described above in Packrat’s earlier uses of AlienSpy, half the decryption key is in a.txt. The\n\nother half is a string which is decrypted iteratively by the abcdefghijk[a,f,j,s,u,z].class files with the method and class\n\n\n-----\n\n“reg.exe” (Access type: “SETVAL”, Path:\n\n“\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\CURRENTVERSION\\RUN”, Key: “JAVASE”, Value:\n“”C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\RoUndCuBe\\bin\\javaw.exe” -jar\n“C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas934FlashJava.\n\n\n**3.2.2 Adzok makes an appearance**\n\nBetween 2014-2015, Packrat also used Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator. Similar to AlienSpy in functionality, the java\nbased Adzok is apparently from Bolivia. The premium version costs $990, but it appears that Packrat is using the “free”\n\nversion. This version of Adzok does not use obfuscation, which makes it possible to simply uncompress the jar files within\n\nthe docx and read the clear-text configuration file. Given the obfuscated nature of the other RATs that Packrat has used,\n\ntheir use of Adzok is surprising. It is possible that they were having stability, compatibility, or detection problems with other\n\nRATs and that Adzok served a specific requirement.\n\n# 4. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns\n\nPackrat is active in phishing, often against the same groups and individuals whom they target with malware. For\n\nexample, when examining one target of malware attacks, we found this individual had been targeted by dozens of\n\nphishing attempts by Packrat during the same period. The same domains and fake identities that Packrat uses to seed\n\nmalware are also used to serve phishing, although Packrat also maintains dedicated phishing sites and servers. While\n\nphishing e-mails appeared to be regularly sent, we also observed particular cases of the phishing apparently sent to\n\ntargets in response to contacts they made during our investigation.\n\nWe have been able to achieve the most systematic visibility of Packrat’s campaign against Ecuadorian targets, but\n\nhave found evidence of targeting in neighboring countries including Venezuela. Packrat uses both e-mails and social\n\nmedia messages, as well as SMSes to send phishing messages.\n\nThis section describes these phishing campaigns, and describes both Politically-Themed and Non-Politically Themed\n\nphishing attacks.\n\n**Category** **Example Domain** **Note**\n\nPolitics & News lavozamericana.info Fake news website\n\nGovernmental – asambleanacional-gob- Lookalike to the Ecuadorian National\n\nEcuador ec.cu9.co Assembly’s e-mail login\n\nPolitical Movement –\n\nmovimientoanticorreista.com Fake political movement\n\nEcuador\n\nFree E-mail mgoogle.us Fake Google login\n\n## 4.1 Non-Politically Themed Phishing Content\n\nOne of the most common phishing techniques is lookalike communications from popular webmail and social media sites\n\ncontaining requests for password verification, notifications of unauthorized logins, and so on. Packrat uses a wide range\n\nof templates for the major email providers, including Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. A majority of the e-mails are in Spanish.\n\nThe messages are typically personalized to the targets, including both their names and e-mail addresses.\n\n|Category|Example Domain|Note|\n|---|---|---|\n|Politics & News|lavozamericana.info|Fake news website|\n|Governmental – Ecuador|asambleanacional-gob- ec.cu9.co|Lookalike to the Ecuadorian National Assembly’s e-mail login|\n|Political Movement – Ecuador|movimientoanticorreista.com|Fake political movement|\n|Free E-mail|mgoogle.us|Fake Google login|\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 18: Example phishing email\n\n\n**Translated Message**\n\n\n**From: Gmail Team no.response.delivery.es@gmail.com**\n**Subject: [Victim Name], you have a pending warning !**\n\n**To: [victim email]**\n\n\n\n[Victim email],\n\n[Victim Name]for security reasons we request that you verify your account below.\n\nTo ensure proper use of your account, we request that you verify it.\n\nClick here to verify your account.\n\nDepending on the attack, the phishing either contains a direct link to the phishing URL, or uses a shortener.\n\n**4.1.1 Most Recent Non-Political Phishing**\n\nRecently, the attackers appear to have slightly varied their technique. We have observed them making extensive use of\n\ntinyurl as a shortener, as well as moving their phishing pages to the free host cu9.co. The attackers may have concluded\n\nthat using a free provider reduced costs and increased flexibility.\n\n**Example recent phishing URL and shortener:**\n\n\ntinyurl.com/nww83ov Yields: main-latam-soporte-widget-local.cu9[dot]co\n\n\n**4.1.2 Example Non-Political Phishing SMSes**\n\nA number of Packrat’s targets also received phishing SMSes. The SMSes often use similar language to the phishing e\nmails, and in some cases use the same shortened URL. In other cases, the attackers push harder, warning the targeted\n\nuser that their accounts will be terminated if they fail to follow the link. In at least one case we observed that the\n\nmessages contained improperly formatted e-mail addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 19: Example of non political phishing\n\n## 4.2 Politically Themed Phishing\n\nWe observed a wide range of e-mails and messages that contained content with political overtones. Packrat takes two\n\nbasic approaches in the attacks we have examined. First approach: create fake political and media organizations.\n\nSecond approach: impersonate well-known groups and high-profile individuals. Attacks typically took the form of\n\nmessages and e-mails containing information either in ‘solidarity,’ upsetting information, or other relevant news. A\n\nmajority of what we observed seemed to be crafted to appeal to opposition elements.\n\nWhile much of the phishing seems to mimic common free webmail and social media sites, in specific cases, Packrat\n\nmimicked e-mail services of high-profile targets, like the Ecuadorian National Assembly.\n\n**4.2.1 Targeting Ecuadorian Parliamentarians**\n\nA group we believe to be Packrat has operated a phishing campaign that mimics the Ecuadorian national assembly’s\n\nwebmail portal. This malicious site prompts the target(s) to enter their email credentials, which are captured via formmail,\n\na technique seen repeatedly in the phishing pages we identified (see below).\n\n\nasambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co\n\n\nThe legitimate domain is:\n\nhttp://mail.asambleanacional.gob.ec/\n\n**4.2.2 A Typical Credential Harvesting Page**\n\nWhatever the bait, the links on the messages typically lead victims (often via a shortener) to a lookalike domain for a free\n\nemail provider. During the summer of 2015, a frequently observed domain was a lookalike for Google, although there\n\nhave been many others:\n\n\nmgoogle.us\n\n\nWhile the attacks were active, mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 20: mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login\n\nOnce a victim’s credentials are entered, they are shown a Spanish language note “confirming” that their gmail has\n\nbeen “unblocked” and thanking the victim for “choosing us.”\n\nImage 21: A Spanish language note “confirming” that their Gmail\n\nhas been “unblocked”\n\nIn other cases, Packrat sends “confirmation” emails to the original victim, congratulating them on “successfully”\n\nverifying their account after credentials are entered. In specific cases, we found that this e-mail arrived several hours\n\nbefore phished accounts were accessed.\n\nWhile the phishing has used different tools to harvest credentials, we find that Packrat makes repeated use of the\n\nlegitimate online website form service formmail.com to receive phished credentials. Formmail is a legitimate HTML-based\n\nform processor that receives the contents of data entered into forms, then sends them to an e-mail address.\n\n## 4.3 A Sample of Phishing & Malware Seeding Sites\n\nThe attackers control a range of domains that they use to serve both phishing and malware. This section outlines\n\nelements of this infrastructure. A more complete list is in Appendix D, but we describe certain domains of interest here.\n\nThe phishing page mgoogle.us, for example, has resolved to a range of IPs, including:\n\n|IP|First Seen|Last Seen|WHOIS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|198.12.150.249|5/19/2015 6:16:00|9/4/2015 9:51:00|Godaddy|\n|50.63.202.57|9/4/2015 12:52:00|10/8/2015 21:44:00|Godaddy|\n\n\n-----\n\npolitical angle.\n\n**WHOIS**\n\n\nName Pedro Luis\n\nOrganization Reterg is\n\nAddress teredotr\nCity berlin\n\nState berlin\n\nCountry DE Germany\nPhone +49.454545445\n\nPrivate no\n\n\n[The registrant of the site is enripintos123@outlook.es, whom we find listed as the registrant for a range of other domains.

The two exceptions are lavozamericana.info and pancaliente.info (see Section 6. Possible\n\n**Deception Operations). Both of those domains were registered within the timeframe of other registrations of lookalike or**\n\nconfirmed phishing domains.\n\n**4.3.1 Lookalike Fake News Sites**\n\nThe website Ecuador En Vivio (ecuadorenvivo.com) is a legitimate news site, however the attackers control the lookalike\n\necuadorenvivo.co domain. Packrat has used this fake domain to send emails to targets, either containing attachment\nbased malware, or links to the site which has also been used to seed malware via a plugin error.\n\n[A Twitter user spotted the fake plugin notification in May 2015 and alerted their followers, and included a screenshot](https://twitter.com/el_mercioco/status/596141189071577090)\n\npurporting to show one of the fake plugin alerts.\n\nImage 22: Fake plugin notification\n\nSimilarly, Focus Ecuador (focusecuador.net) is a genuine news website, however the domain focusecuador.tk, is\n\ncontrolled by the attackers, and has been observed seeding malware using a fake popup. Examination of the IP hosting\n\nfocusecuador.tk (193.105.134.27) reveals a long list of obvious lookalike domains (See Appendix D).\n\n**4.3.2 A Fake News Organization: The American Voice?**\n\nA second interesting domain is lavozamericana.info, which is no longer active. However we were also able to find a\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the fake identity appears to have had at least some success, as some of the followers of the account\n\nappear to be genuine. While the site is no longer active, Google’s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on\n\nthe site.\n\nImage 23: Google’s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site\n\nWhile we have received reports that individuals targeted by Packrat lost access to their iCloud accounts during the\n\ntimeframe of this attack, we have been unable to verify conclusively whether Packrat was responsible.\n\n**4.3.3 A Fake Opposition Movement**\n\nA number of the targets we identified had received e-mails and messages purporting to come from\n\nmovimientoanticorreista.com, including the example Attack 1 above. The same domain was also mentioned in a recent\n\nreport by an Ecuadorian NGO of malware attacks against journalists in Ecuador. We found malware seeding messages\n\n[associated with this domain, typically sent by movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com.](mailto:movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com)\n\n**Another Anti Correa Movement E-mail**\n\n\nDe: Movimiento Anti Correista <movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com>\n\nFecha: [REDACTED: April 2015]\n\nAsunto: DOCUMENTOS FILTRADOS DEL GOBIERNO CORREISTA – EL SILLON MILLONARIO Y LAS ACTIVIDADES\nCORRUPTAS\n\nPara: [REDACTED]SALUDOS ESTIMADO,Compartimos con usted nuestro nuevo sitio web en el cual estaremos\n\npublicando información del corrupto gobierno de Rafael Correa.DESCARGUE LOS DOCUMENTOS\nDE:www.movimientoanticorreista.com\n\n\n**Translated E-mail**\n\n\nFrom: Anti Correa Movement <movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com>\nSubject: LEAKED DOCUMENTS FROM THE CORREISTA GOVERNMENT – THE ARMCHAIR MILLIONAIRE AND CORRUPT\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nTo: [REDACTED]ESTEEMED GREETINGS,We are sharing with you our new website where we will publish information\nabout the corrupt government of Rafael Correa.DOWNLOAD DOCUMENTS:www.movimientoanticorreista.com\n\n\n## 4.4 A Window Into Campaign Scope\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1wl3YE2\n\n\nThis link was created Oct. 31, 2014 by an anonymous sharer. Examining statistics for the bit.ly link, we were able to see a\n\nsuperficial overview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks.\n\nImage 25: An overview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks\n\nThe distribution of clicks is particularly interesting, and suggests that a majority of the hits were located in Ecuador, with\n\nothers in Argentina, Germany, the United States, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The absence of Brazil is not necessarily\n\nsurprising, as it is likely that the attackers, if they continue to phish in Brazil, may be using separate, Portuguese language\n\nsites. This provides an indirect window into the location of Packrat’s targets.\n\nA majority of clicks (322) came from direct link clicks, rather than link shares elsewhere. While this particular bitly link was\n\nnot extensively clicked on social media sites, Packrat does use social media for some seeding.\n\n## 4.5 Note: Lots of Phishing, Not All of it Linkable\n\nThe investigation yielded a high volume of Spanish-language phishing attacks against the same individuals that Packrat\n\ntargeted, however for a number of reasons we were unable to link much of the phishing activity to Packrat. One of the\n\nmost notable and high volume campaigns that we identified used the domain gmail.com.msg07.xyz and masqueraded\n\nas a range of account notifications from popular providers including Gmail. Typically these messages displayed as\n\noriginating from e-mail addresses like “no-responder@supportgmai1.com.”  In some cases, individuals received these\n\nmessages almost weekly over long periods of time.\n\n# 5. Possible Deception Operations\n\nNot all of the domains associated with this group appear to have been built to spread malware, or to trick victims into\n\nentering their passwords. Several domains are extensively built out, and currently maintained, which appear to be\n\ndesigned to convey the impression of active, news media sites. Some of these sites contain ‘original’ news stories and\n\n‘leaks’ about political figures. At least two of these sites seem Venezuela-specific, while a third is Ecuador-oriented.\n\nWhat makes these three fake organizations exceptionally interesting is that we have found no evidence that they are\n\n\n-----\n\nThey may also be coupled with other operations on which we have no visibility.\n\n## 5.1 Anti-Chavez: The Very Strange Case of pancaliente.info\n\nUpdate: immediately **prior to the publication of this report the Pancaliente.info site went offline. The site is still viewable in**\n\n**Google’s cache. The second domain of this type (chavistas24.com) remains online.**\n\nOne of the most interesting domains also hosted on 198.12.150.249 is pancaliente.info. At first glance this is a Venezuela\nfocused news and information site. Unlike all of the other sites hosted on this IP that we could verify, this site appeared to\n\nhave a large volume of original content that was presented in a news format.\n\nNevertheless, the site has many links to the other domains. While the domain registration is currently masked, the\n\nregistration e-mail is shared with other phishing sites.\n\n[pancaliente.info](http://pancaliente.info/) [GoDaddy.com,LLC(R171-] [enripintos123@outlook.es ns1.hostinger.ru 10/25/2014 49454545445](http://ns1.hostinger.ru/)\n\nLRMS)\n\n[The registration can be verified, although pancaliente.info’s WHOIS has since been made private.](http://domainbigdata.com/email/enripintos123@outlook.es)\n\nImage 26: Pan caliente website as it appeared in October 2015\n\nExamining more closely, much of the content seems to be intended to appeal to Venezuelans at home and abroad who\n\noppose the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV: the party of Hugo Chavez). Some of the reports are intriguing\n\nbecause they describe private documents seemingly obtained by the site (and of questionable veracity), but without\n\nfurther information about their origins.\n\nIn other cases, the site has published purportedly “leaked” documents. Many of these stories are critical of individuals\n\nlinked to the PSUV. Many reports also concern the “Expat” community of Venezuelans who oppose the regime from\n\noverseas, especially the diaspora in Spain.\n\n[PanCaliente is referenced elsewhere online, such as an apparently leaked document hosted on Slideshare.

Also still online is at least one\n\nreport that still refers to the site as venezuela365. Interestingly, that first ‘report’ refers to “secret” information,\n\nincluding reproducing a purported cheque, without explaining its provenance.\n\n\nhttp://pancaliente[.]info/los-negocios-secretos-de-leocenis-garcia-y-gonzalo-tirado/\n\n\n“García demandó a Tirado en un corte de Miami cuando el empresario le dio al periodista un cheque falso al cual\n\nVenezuela365 tuvo acceso.”\n\nThe source of this page also contains links to the now-defunct venezuela365.com\n\n\n“http://venezuela365.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tirado-g-300×169.jpg“\n\n\nAn identically named image is now hosted on pancaliente.info, in an identical directory.\n\n[The venezuela365.com domain was registered behind DomainsByProxy, however previous WHOIS names Sistekon Corp](http://www.statsinfinity.com/domain/4G8CJ9J0HT_qqbR34C2sHQ.._info.html)\n\n[as a prior registrant. Sistekon Corporation seems to now be defunct, although its information is still on archive.org, and](http://web.archive.org/web/20130719001853/http://www.sistekon.com/)\n\nindicates that it develops IT software as well as selling various security solutions. Given that the domain expired in 2013, but\n\nwas re-registered in 2014 at around the same time as pancaliente.info, the link may be coincidental.\n\nWe found no evidence that PanCaliente or venezuela365 was ever used to seed malware or conduct phishing attempts,\n\neither directly, or as a pretext for malicious content.\n\n## 5.2 And Pro-Chavez: Chavistas 24.com\n\nThe domain, chavistas24.com, which seems to refer to supporters of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, also has\n\na range of content that is apparently supportive of the party.\n\nImage 30: Screenshot of Chavistas24.com showing articles tagged “Traitors of the Revolution”on\n\nChavistas24.com\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chavistas24/\n\n\n[Image 31: The Chavistas 24 Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/chavistas24/)\n\nWe found no evidence that chavistas24.com was used to phish or send malware, either directly, or as a pretext for\n\nmalicious content or messages.\n\n## 5.3 Seeking Angry Police?\n\nPackrat appears to be interested in attracting dissatisfied members of Ecuador’s National Police, and has created a\n\nwebsite (justicia-desvinculados.com) and social media identity built around “Los Desvinculados,” referring to police let\n\ngo from Ecuador’s National Police, possibly in the context of corruption inquiries. The website, which also includes a\n\nlogin section, contains news and highly critical reports about the Ecuadorian government.\n\n[Ecuador’s police have previously been involved in protests over benefit cuts that some have seen as one of the](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/30/ecuador-chaos-police-rafael-correa)\n\nstrongest threats to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa’s rule.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 32: Screenshot of Los Desvinculados website\n\nThe social media component of this creation, including a Twitter page of the same name (twitter.com/justdesvincula2)\n\nfurther develops the identity.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 33: Screenshot of Desvinculados Twitter page\n\nAs with the two other operations described in this section, we have been unable to identify malware or phishing\n\nassociated directly or indirectly with Justicia Desvinculados.\n\n# Part 6: The Challenge of Attribution\n\nThe evidence presented in this report points to a coordinated and persistent campaign with a regional focus. Naturally,\n\nthis raises questions about attribution. This section assesses two competing hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State\n**Sponsored and Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not State-Sponsored. For each hypothesis we provide one or more scenarios that**\n\nwe consider plausible versions of the hypothesis.\n\n## 6.1 Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored\n\n**6.1.2 Examining the Target List**\n\nThe list of known targets is full of influential people whose activities could have an impact on the domestic and regional\n\npolitical standing of regimes in several countries. Where we have been able to identify individuals who have been\n\ntargeted, we find vocal, strong regime critics and independent journalists in Ecuador and Argentina. Interestingly,\n\nPackrat has also targeted parliamentarians, and others within the government of Ecuador. This diversity of targets with\n\n(possibly) opposing positions is a common theme in the data.\n\nIn other cases, we find phishing and malware-seeding websites, emails and messages with obviously political themes.\n\nPackrat created fake political organizations, whose identities, logos, and websites are then used to seed phishing attacks\n\nand malware. These materials seem designed to appeal primarily to both critics and (some) members of governments in\n\nEcuador and Venezuela. We also believe that there are targets in other countries, including Brazil, but have limited\n\n\n-----\n\nthe seeding and targeting suggest, further, that the sponsor(s) of this activity would be interested in the opponents of\n\nseveral regimes.\n\n**6.1.3 Motivation for Disinformation Campaigns**\n\nWe see a range of fake websites touching on political themes, but not obviously used to seed malware. While some of\n\nthese sites share the same registrations as malware serving sites, they differ by having extensive content, and show no\n\nevidence of having hosted malicious files or phishing pages, or of having been used as pretexts for campaigns, as is\n\ncommon with Packrat. The content reflects extensive effort, as does the backstopping with identities on social media\n\nsites.\n\nThere seem to be three possible explanations for these pages. First, the pages may be an attempt to create credible fake\n\norganizations that can be used to actively promote disinformation, interspersed with real news. Second, the pages may\n\nserve as honeypots, used to attract targets, either to identify and possibly manipulate them, or to build trust that could\n\nthen be used in malware attacks. Finally, the pages may be part of information gathering operations that have other\n\ncomponents of which we are not aware.\n\nWhile it would not be surprising for a political movement or well-funded set of interests to engage in these activities in one\n\ncountry, Packrat has done so in multiple countries. It is not clear what group beyond a state, would be interested in this\n\nkind of activity, and have the resources to support it.\n\n**6.1.4 Ability to Pay**\n\nThe hosting and domain registrations necessary to maintain this campaign infrastructure for more than seven years\n\nclearly have associated costs. The human labor associated with creating and maintaining the many fake websites we\n\nhave observed is also costly. This is especially true for the websites with substantial “original” content, such as\n\nPanCaliente. Finally, the extensive and personalized targeting clearly reflects substantial human effort.\n\nThe cost of this campaign suggests that Packrat is either well-resourced, or has sponsors who can pay for server space\n\nand time, as well as the costs of Packrat’s operators. We see no evidence of targeting with out-of-scope seeding\n\nmaterials, such as industry, business or the financial sector. Given the cost of the campaign, it is difficult to see who,\n\nbeyond a state or an organized entity with political aspirations, would both want the information, and be in a position to\n\npay for it.\n\n**6.1.5 Clues That Packrat Feels ‘Safe’**\n\nWhen the first reports were published on the Nisman and Argentine targeting in early 2015, some of Packrat’s\n\ninfrastructure was exposed. Nevertheless, much of the infrastructure has remained online. From a pragmatic point of view\n\nthis makes sense. If Packrat had successful implants operational at that time, taking the infrastructure offline would close\n\nthat access. Packrat would have had to engage in a process of pushing out updated implants to the infected\n\ncomputers that connected to a new host. This time-consuming process would also be prone to failure and possible\n\ndetection.\n\nIf Packrat were afraid of criminal punishment in their country of residence, it would have been natural to take the servers\n\noffline once exposed. Their interlinked infrastructure can be used to investigate, as we did, the broader structure of their\n\ncampaigns. In the hands of a law enforcement agency, these active servers could potentially be traced back to the\n\nresponsible parties.\n\nThe fact that the servers remain online suggests that Packrat is operating purely on practical concerns, which do not\n\ninclude fear of the authorities. We take this to suggest that they may enjoy a degree of protection in the country or\n\ncountries in which they operate.\n\nWhile it is less conclusive, their taunts of a Citizen Lab researcher also suggest a degree of confidence that these actions\n\nwill not have consequence for them. Given their decision to keep their infrastructure online, this researcher may not have\n\nbeen the first (or the last) to bother them by analyzing one of their attacks.\n\n**6.1.6 Two Scenarios of State Sponsorship**\n\nIn this section we present two possible scenarios for state sponsorship. The data we have presented in this report could be\n\nexplained by either of these possibilities (or by the scenario outlined for Hypothesis 2: Non State Sponsor).\n\n**Scenario 1: A Single State Sponsor**\n\nThere are several possible explanations for the targeting we see. It is possible that Packrat is working for a single\n\n\n-----\n\nThe strong representation of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas) countries, and their recent “fellow-travelers”\n\n(Argentina included, although it has recently changed ruling parties), among the locations of targeting may be\n\ninstructive. The leaders of these countries are widely seen as political allies on the leftist spectrum, although Argentina’s\n\n[most recent election in November 2015 elected a president who seems to reject this relationship. The governments of](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/argentina-election-exit-polls-buenos-aires-mauricio-macri)\n\nEcuador and Venezuela, meanwhile, are especially close allies, although it is unclear how this will evolve given\n\n[Venezuela’s very recent elections.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/venezuela-parliamentary-election-opposition-win-political-prisoners-amnesty)\n\nSome may jump to interpret public reports of malware attacks targeting opponents of the Ecuadorian government as\n\nconclusive evidence of official Ecuadorian government involvement with Packrat. They may also point to previous\n\nreports that Ecuador’s domestic intelligence agency reportedly used the commercial trojan made by Hacking Team to\n\n[target at least one dissident. However, the presence of targets within the Ecuadorian parliament and possibly elsewhere](http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/08/06/apnewsbreak-leaked-hacking-team-emails-suggest-ecuador-illegally-spied-on/)\n\nin the government challenges any simplistic theory of Ecuadorian government sponsorship, but does not completely rule\n\nit out as intra-governmental rivalries or other dynamics could be at play.\n\n**Scenario 2: Mercenary Work for One or More Government Sponsors**\n\nThe range and diversity of regional targets, which includes the opponents of several regimes, as well as those same\n\ngovernments supporters in some cases, could be taken as indicating that the threat actor group is reusing the same\n\ninfrastructure for campaigns on behalf of multiple client governments at once. It is possible, for example, that Packrat is in\n\nthe “address book” of multiple clients, and reuses the same infrastructure for multiple campaigns.\n\n## 6.2 Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not a State Actor\n\nAlthough some of the evidence we have outlined above provides circumstantial support for state sponsorship, other\n\nfeatures of Packrat’s activity are not so clear. This section briefly lays out the most salient of these pieces of evidence:\n\nlack of technical sophistication. We evaluate this fact, and then briefly note a potential scenario for non-state\n\nsponsorship.\n\n**6.2.1 Lack of Use of technically sophisticated tools**\n\nThe malware used by this campaign is primarily Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RATs, not boutique or tailor-made\n\nimplants. Nor is it the commercial malware sold to governments by companies like FinFisher and Hacking Team.\n\nAdditionally, the attackers do not make use of exploits for their malware seeding. The lack of exploits very likely hampers\n\nthe efficacy of many attacks. For example some of the bait documents instruct victims to double click on an icon in the\n\ndocument. This is cumbersome, and is more likely to result in failed attacks or discovery. A threat actor with the direct\n\nsupport of a government might have access to more sophisticated malware, and exploits.\n\nHowever, it is well documented that not all government-linked malware groups make use of sophisticated malware or\n\n[exploits. Prior research by Citizen Lab, for example, has shown that state-sponsored groups targeting civil society often](https://targetedthreats.net/)\n\nuse the minimum necessary technical sophistication in their campaigns. Why use more sophisticated or esoteric\n\ntechnique when simpler tools suffice? Other research on government-linked hacking groups in the Middle East also\n\nsuggests that these groups persist in exploit-less targeting, perhaps because it is inexpensive, and that it nevertheless\n\nachieves a minimum satisfactory level of infections.\n\nUltimately, the reliance on COTS malware and lack of exploits does not enable us to draw many conclusions. However, it\n\ndoes have one feature worth noting: by extensively obfuscating COTS malware, the attackers are nevertheless able to\n\ndeliver malware that is effective at evading detection while simultaneously being difficult to attribute. That said, since\n\nobfuscated malware is also common in criminal hacking, the pairing of crimeware and obfuscators does not tell either\n\nway towards this hypothesis.\n\n**6.2.2: Scenario: Non-State Group**\n\nIt is impossible to reject the possibility that Packrat is a criminal or non-state group. Such a group could, in theory, be a\n\nsupporter of an opposition political movement, or have other interests in the critics of regimes. There are a range of\n\npowerful non-state groups in South America, including cartels and others involved in illegal trafficking, who would\n\ncertainly have the ability to pay for these operations. Nevertheless, given the particular targets we are aware of, we are\n\nunsure of why these individuals would be of primary interest to groups involved in illegal activities.\n\nAnother possibility, also unfalsifiable, is that a non-government group with political ambitions is responsible for Packrat.\n\nSuch a group might be particularly interested in potential allies or sources of instability, as well as governments.\n\n## 6.3 Adjudicating between competing hypotheses\n\n\n-----\n\n# 7. Conclusion\n\nThis report described a seven year campaign with targets in several Latin American countries. While there are many well\nknown threat actors in Latin America, many of the most visible are engaged in cybercrime. What distinguishes Packrat is\n\nthe extensive and often ingenious targeting of political figures, journalists and others. They are also distinguished by their\n\nability to remain active over such an extended period, seemingly unfazed by discovery.\n\nPackrat highlights the extent to which multi-year campaigns can be run using limited technical sophistication, and a lot\n\nof creativity. From a technical perspective, they rely almost entirely on off-the-shelf RATs and packers to evade antivirus\n\ndetection. Where they excel is in the time and effort spent to create detailed and moderately convincing fake\n\norganizations to seed their malware.\n\nTheir persistence, and their willingness to keep using domains even after they are exposed suggests that exposure of their\n\ninfrastructure is not an existential threat. Their threats and taunts are similarly brazen. This strongly suggests, but does not\n\nprove, that Packrat operates with a perception of safety.\n\nUltimately, this report does not conclusively attribute Packrat’s activities, however we hope that by exposing their\n\nactivities, we have provided encouragement to others to continue to follow the thread.\n\n## Note: The Precarious Position of Media in Latin America\n\nWhile we discourage a direct link between specific incidents of non-digital harassment of journalists and Packrat, the\n\ncase highlights the difficult situation faced by journalists and freedom of expression supporters in countries like Ecuador.\n\n[In Ecuador, for example, numerous](https://www.hrw.org/americas/ecuador) [observers, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression,](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/ecuador)\n\nhave expressed concern that the freedoms afforded to journalists continue to be constricted. In Ecuador journalists, and\n\neven cartoonists, have faced apparent retaliation for political speech. Journalist Martha Roldos, for example, had\n\npersonal e-mails exposed in the press, and recordings of her conversations played in public. Freedom of expression and\n\n[journalism organization Fundamedios, which has documented over 600 attacks against journalists from 2008-2012, has](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/ngo-alert-ecuadorian-government-orders-press-freedom-group-to-disband)\n\n[face forced shutdown. Interestingly, both of these individuals were also targets of Packrat. While we have no evidence](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16453&LangID=E)\n\nlinking the perpetrators of these actions to Packrat, nor reason to believe the sponsor is the same, the targeted malware\n\nthat we describe only adds to the threats these individuals and organizations face.\n\n# Footnotes\n\n[1] See Appendix B for details.\n\n[2] bc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832\n\n[3] Sandboxes include ThreatExpert, Anubis, CWSandbox, JoeBox and Norman Sandbox.

Command & Control domains and port. The following configuration, for example, has been extracted\n\nfrom 01dec1b1d0760d5a1a562edcfeb478d1:\n\n|Key|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Activate Keylogger|TRUE|\n|Active X Startup|{C452W6HW-7DQ6-8U8P-2730-EI158IF7748K}|\n|Change Creation Date|TRUE|\n|CyberGate Version||\n|Domain|taskmgr.redirectme.net|taskmgr.servehttp.com||\n|Enable Message Box|FALSE|\n|FTP Address|ftp.server.com|\n|FTP Directory Value|./logs/|\n|FTP Interval|30|\n|FTP Password|+|\n|FTP Port|21|\n|FTP UserName|ftp_user|\n|Google Chrome Passwords||\n|Hide File|TRUE|\n|Install Directory|System32|\n|Install File Name|taskhost.exe|\n|Install Flag|TRUE|\n|Install Message Box|Arquivo Extraido com sucesso|\n|Install Message Title|Ok|\n|Keylogger Backspace = Delete|FALSE|\n|Keylogger Enable FTP|FALSE|\n|Melt File|FALSE|\n|Message Box Button|0|\n|Message Box Icon|64|\n|Mutex|***MUTEX***|\n|P2P Spread||\n|Password|abcd1234|\n|Persistence|TRUE|\n|Port|2012|2008||\n|Process Injection|Disabled|\n|REG Key HKCU|msconfig|\n|REG Key HKLM|msconfig|\n\n\n-----\n\nUSB Spread FALSE\n\nWhen no decoy Office document is added to the AutoIt3 stub, they normally enabled the Message Box and used\n\n“Arquivo corrompido“ as message. Additionally, the ServerID value seems to change, including additional values like\n\n**ley, vtima, Emais 10.**\n\n## Xtreme RAT Configuration\n\nFollowing is the configuration for one of the
