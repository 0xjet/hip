For example, in the Secureworks® 2022 State of the Threat report,](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-state-of-the-threat-2022)\nCounter Threat Unit™(CTU) researchers described legitimate web searches being hijacked\n\n\n-----\n\nby SEO poisoning to infect victims systems with Gootloader, and malicious Google Ads\nbundling infostealers like RedLine in trojanized installers for messaging apps such as Signal.\n\nRecently, CTU™ researchers observed Bumblebee malware distributed via trojanized\ninstallers for popular software such as Zoom, Cisco AnyConnect, ChatGPT, and Citrix\nWorkspace. Bumblebee is a modular loader, historically distributed primarily through\nphishing, that has been used to deliver payloads commonly associated with ransomware\ndeployments. Trojanizing installers for software that is particularly topical (e.g., ChatGPT) or\nsoftware commonly used by remote workers increases the likelihood of new infections.\n\nOne of the Bumblebee samples CTU researchers analyzed was downloaded from http:\n//appcisco . com/vpncleint/cisco-anyconnect-4_9_0195.msi. On or around February 16,\n2023, a threat actor created a fake download page for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility\nClient v4.x (see Figure 1) on the appcisco . com domain. An infection chain that began with a\nmalicious Google Ad sent the user to this fake download page via a compromised\nWordPress site.\n\n_Figure 1. Malicious web page serving trojanized Cisco AnyConnect VPN installer. (Source:_\n_DomainTools)_\n\nThe cisco-anyconnect-4_9_0195.msi file is an MSI installer that contains two files (see\nFigure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Contents of trojanized Cisco AnyConnect VPN installer. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nWhen the MSI installer is executed, renamed versions of these two files are copied to the\n“%Temp%\\Package Installation Dir” folder (see Figure 3) and executed.\n\n_Figure 3. Renamed contents of trojanized Cisco AnyConnect installer. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nFILE_InstallMeCisco (renamed to CiscoSetup.exe) is a legitimate installer for the Cisco\nAnyConnect VPN Secure Mobility Client application. FILE_InstallMeExe (renamed to\ncisco2.ps1) is a PowerShell script. CTU researchers identified other samples that used the\nsame technique with a different software installer and related PowerShell script name, such\nas Zoom (ZoomInstaller.exe and zoom.ps1), ChatGPT (ChatGPT.msi and chch.ps1) and\nCitrix (CitrixWorkspaceApp.exe and citrix.ps1).\n\nThe PowerShell script contains a selection of renamed functions copied from the\nPowerSploit ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script. It also contains an encoded Bumblebee\nmalware payload that it reflectively loads into memory.\n\nIn one compromised environment, CTU researchers observed the threat actor moving\nlaterally approximately three hours after infection, and deploying Cobalt Strike as well as the\nlegitimate AnyDesk and DameWare remote access tools. The attacker used a Scheduled\nTask named WindowsSensor15 as a persistence mechanism for Cobalt Strike. Additional\ntools deployed by the threat actor included pshashes.txt, which is likely a script for\n[conducting Kerberoasting attacks; a batch script to dump the contents of the Active Directory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/)\ndatabase; and a network scanning utility (netscanold.exe). These tools were dropped in the\nC:\\ProgramData directory. Network defenders detected the activity and disrupted access\nbefore the attacker achieved their objective, which was likely to deploy ransomware.\n\nTo mitigate this and similar threats, organizations should ensure that software installers and\nupdates are only downloaded from known and trusted websites. Users should not have\n[privileges to install software and run scripts on their computers. Tools such as AppLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview)\ncan prevent malware from being executed even if it is inadvertently downloaded.\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers identified numerous indicators associated with this threat (see Table 1).\nDue to the large number of C2 IP addresses extracted from the Bumblebee malware\nconfiguration data, the table only lists a subset. However, all identified indicators have been\napplied to Secureworks customer protections. Note that IP addresses can be reallocated.\nThe IP addresses and domains may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before\nopening them in a browser.\n\n**Indicator** **Type**
