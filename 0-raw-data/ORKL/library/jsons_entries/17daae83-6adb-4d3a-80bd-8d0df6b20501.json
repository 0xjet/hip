REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Pool/File Photo\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com\n\nOct 21 (Reuters) - The ransomware group REvil was itself hacked and forced offline this\nweek by a multi-country operation, according to three private sector cyber experts working\nwith the United States and one former official.\n\nFormer partners and associates of the Russian-led criminal gang were responsible for a May\ncyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline that led to widespread gas shortages on the U.S. East\n[Coast. REvil's direct victims include top meatpacker JBS (JBSS3.SA). The crime group's](https://www.reuters.com/companies/JBSS3.SA)\n\"Happy Blog” website, which had been used to leak victim data and extort companies, is no\nlonger available.\n\nOfficials said the Colonial attack used encryption software called DarkSide, which was\ndeveloped by REvil associates.\n\n\n-----\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com\n\n[VMWare (VMW.N) head of cybersecurity strategy Tom Kellermann said law enforcement and](https://www.reuters.com/companies/VMW.N)\nintelligence personnel stopped the group from victimizing additional companies.\n\n\"The FBI, in conjunction with Cyber Command, the Secret Service and like-minded countries,\nhave truly engaged in significant disruptive actions against these groups,” said Kellermann,\nan adviser to the U.S. Secret Service on cybercrime investigations. “REvil was top of the list.”\n\nA leadership figure known as \"0_neday,\" who had helped restart the group's operations after\nan earlier shutdown, said REvil's servers had been hacked by an unnamed party.\n\n\"The server was compromised, and they were looking for me,\" 0_neday wrote on a\ncybercrime forum last weekend and first spotted by security firm Recorded Future. \"Good\nluck, everyone; I'm off.\"\n\nU.S. government attempts to stop REvil, one of the worst of dozens of ransomware gangs\nthat work with hackers to penetrate and paralyze companies around the world, accelerated\n[after the group compromised U.S. software management company Kaseya in July.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-says-uncertain-who-is-behind-latest-ransomware-attack-2021-07-03)\n\nThat breach opened access to hundreds of Kaseya's customers all at once, leading to\nnumerous emergency cyber incident response calls.\n\n## DECRYPTION KEY\n\nFollowing the attack on Kaseya, the FBI obtained a universal decryption key that allowed\nthose infected via Kaseya to recover their files without paying a ransom.\n\nBut law enforcement officials initially withheld the key for weeks as it quietly pursued REvil's\nstaff, [the FBI later acknowledged.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ransomware-fbi-revil-decryption-key/2021/09/21/4a9417d0-f15f-11eb-a452-4da5fe48582d_story.html)\n\nAccording to three people familiar with the matter, law enforcement and intelligence cyber\nspecialists were able to hack REvil's computer network infrastructure, obtaining control of at\nleast some of their servers.\n\nAfter websites that the hacker group used to conduct business went offline in July, the main\nspokesman for the group, who calls himself \"Unknown,\" vanished from the internet.\n\nWhen gang member 0_neday and others restored those websites from a backup last month,\nhe unknowingly restarted some internal systems that were already controlled by law\nenforcement.\n\n“The REvil ransomware gang restored the infrastructure from the backups under the\nassumption that they had not been compromised,” said Oleg Skulkin, deputy head of the\nforensics lab at the Russian-led security company Group-IB. “Ironically, the gang's own\nfavorite tactic of compromising the backups was turned against them.”\n\n\n-----\n\nReliable backups are one of the most important defenses against ransomware attacks, but\nthey must be kept unconnected from the main networks or they too can be encrypted by\nextortionists such as REvil.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the\noperation specifically.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, we are undertaking a whole of government ransomware effort, including\ndisruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors, working with the private sector to\nmodernize our defenses, and building an international coalition to hold countries who harbor\nransom actors accountable,\" the person said.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nOne person familiar with the events said that a foreign partner of the U.S. government\ncarried out the hacking operation that penetrated REvil's computer architecture. A former\nU.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the operation is still active.\n\nThe success stems from a determination by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco that\nransomware attacks on critical infrastructure should be treated as a national security issue\nakin to terrorism, Kellermann said.\n\n[In June, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General John Carlin told Reuters the Justice](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-give-ransomware-hacks-similar-priority-terrorism-official-says-2021-06-03)\nDepartment was elevating investigations of ransomware attacks to a similar priority.\n\nSuch actions gave the Justice Department and other agencies a legal basis to get help from\nU.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense, Kellermann said.\n\n\"Before, you couldn't hack into these forums, and the military didn't want to have anything to\ndo with it. Since then, the gloves have come off.\"\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com\n\nReporting by Joseph Menn and Christopher Bing; Editing by Chris Sanders and Grant\nMcCool\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n\n-----",
