    "plain_text": "# Russian hacker group Evil Corp targets US workers at home\n\n**bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53195749**\n\nBBC News\n\n**Published**\n26 June 2020\n\nImage source, Reuters\n\nImage caption,\nOne Russian national is accused of carrying out attacks on behalf of the Russian state\n\n**A Russian hacking group is launching ransomware attacks against a number of US**\n**companies, targeting employees who are working from home due to Covid-19.**\n\nEvil Corp hackers have tried to access at least 31 organisations' networks in order to cripple\nsystems and demand millions of dollars in ransom.\n\nThe group's two alleged leaders were indicted by the US Justice Department in December\n2019.\n\nThere are concerns that US voting systems could also be targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast year, US authorities filed charges against Evil Corp s alleged leaders Maksim Yakubets\nand Igor Turashev, accusing them of using malware to steal millions of dollars from groups\nincluding schools and religious organisations in over 40 countries.\n\nOfficials announced a $5m reward for information leading to their arrest, which they said was\nthe largest amount ever offered for a cyber criminal. Both men are still at large.\n\nImage source, US Department of Justice\n\nImage caption,\nMaksim Yakubets (L) and Igor Turashev are accused of running Evil Corp\n\nThe threat comes as the majority of Americans have been working from home due to the\n[coronavirus pandemic - 62% according to a Gallup poll.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/306695/workers-discovering-affinity-remote-work.aspx)\n\nThe US presidential election is also just months away, and federal and local officials have\nbeen working to put measures in place to protect voter records as well as manage safe\nvoting practices amid the pandemic.\n\n## What do we know about the attack?\n\nSymantec Corporation, a firm that monitors corporate and government networks released a\nnotice warning of the threat it identified on Thursday night.\n\nThe attacks used what Symantec described as a relatively new type of ransomware called\nWastedLocker, which has been attributed to Evil Corp. Ransomware are computer viruses\nthat threaten to delete files unless the ransom is paid. The WastedLocker ransomware virus\ndemands ransoms of $500,000 to $1m to unlock computer files it seizes.\n\nSymantec said the \"vast majority of targets are major corporations, including many\nhousehold names\", and eight targets were Fortune 500 companies. All are US-owned but\none, which is a US-based subsidiary.\n\nMost targeted companies were in the manufacturing, information technology and media\nsectors.\n\nMedia caption,\nTechnology explained: what is ransomware?\n\nSymantec said the hackers had breached the networks of these companies and were \"laying\nthe groundwork\" for future ransomware attacks that would let them block access to data and\ndemand millions of dollars.\n\n[Symantec technical director Eric Chien told the New York Times the hackers take advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/russia-ransomware-coronavirus-work-home.html)\nof employees now using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access work systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey use VPNs to identify which company a user works for, and then infect the user s\ncomputer when they visit a public or commercial site. When the user next connects to their\nemployer's system, the hackers can attack.\n\n## What's the context?\n\nThere have been a number of recent cyber-attacks on local governments across the US.\n\nCities and towns in Louisiana, Oregon, Maryland, Georgia, Texas and Florida were hit by\nransomware attacks last year.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is looking into safeguarding voter registration\ndatabases ahead of November 3's general election. In February, the agency's head of cybersecurity [said this was a key election security concern.](https://www.businessinsider.com/department-homeland-security-voter-registration-databases-security-concern-2020-2)\n\nThese attacks by foreign cyber-criminals are far from a new threat.\n\nDuring the impeachment inquiry last year, former White House security adviser and Russia\nexpert Fiona Hill testified that \"Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to\nrepeat their interference in the 2020 election\".\n\nIn 2018, the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking\nDemocratic officials in the 2016 US elections, using spear phishing emails and malicious\nsoftware.\n\nThe hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board site. Moscow\nhas said there is no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking.\n\n\n-----",
