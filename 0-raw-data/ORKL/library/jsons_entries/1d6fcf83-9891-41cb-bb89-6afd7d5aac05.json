APT12 is\nbelieved to be a cyber espionage group thought to have links to the Chinese People's\nLiberation Army. APT12's targets are consistent with larger People's Republic of China\n(PRC) goals. Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this group are in-line with PRC goals\nand self-interest in Taiwan. Additionally, the new campaigns we uncovered further highlight\nthe correlation between APT groups ceasing and retooling operations after media exposure,\nas APT12 used the same strategy after compromising the New York Times in Oct 2012.\nMuch like Darwin’s theory of biological evolution, APT12 been forced to evolve and adapt in\norder to maintain its mission.\n\nThe new campaign marks the first APT12 activity publicly reported since Arbor Networks\n[released their blog “Illuminating The Etumbot APT Backdoor.” FireEye refers to the Etumbot](https://www.netscout.com/arbor-ddos)\nbackdoor as RIPTIDE. Since the release of the Arbor blog post, FireEye has observed\nAPT12 use a modified RIPTIDE backdoor that we call HIGHTIDE. This is the second time\nFireEye has discovered APT12 retooling after a public disclosure. As such, FireEye believes\nthis to be a common theme for this APT group, as APT12 will continue to evolve in an effort\nto avoid detection and continue its cyber operations.\n\nFireEye researchers also discovered two possibly related campaigns utilizing two other\nbackdoors known as THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT. Both backdoors were dropped from\nmalicious documents built utilizing the “Tran Duy Linh” exploit kit, which exploited CVE-20120158. These documents were also emailed to organizations in Japan and Taiwan. While\nAPT12 has previously used THREEBYTE, it is unclear if APT12 was responsible for the\nrecently discovered campaign utilizing THREEBYTE. Similarly, WATERSPOUT is a newly\ndiscovered backdoor and the threat actors behind the campaign have not been positively\nidentified. However, the WATERSPOUT campaign shared several traits with the RIPTIDE\nand HIGHTIDE campaign that we have attributed to APT12.\n\n**Background**\n\nFrom October 2012 to May 2014, FireEye observed APT12 utilizing RIPTIDE, a proxy-aware\nbackdoor that communicates via HTTP to a hard-coded command and control (C2) server.\nRIPTIDE’s first communication with its C2 server fetches an encryption key, and the RC4\nencryption key is used to encrypt all further communication.\n\n\n-----\n\nRIPTIDE HTTP GET Request Example\n\n\nFigure 1: RIPTIDE HTTP GET\n\nRequest Example\nIn June 2014, [Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its](https://www.netscout.com/arbor-ddos)\nC2 infrastructure in great depth. The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in\ncampaigns from March 2011 till May 2014.\n\nFollowing the release of the article, FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE’s\nprotocols and strings. We suspect this change was a direct result of the Arbor blog post in\norder to decrease detection of RIPTIDE by security vendors. The changes to RIPTIDE were\nsignificant enough to circumvent existing RIPTIDE detection rules. FireEye dubbed this new\nmalware family HIGHTIDE.\n\n**HIGHTIDE Malware Family**\n\nOn Sunday August 24, 2014 we observed a spear phish email sent to a Taiwanese\ngovernment ministry. Attached to this email was a malicious Microsoft Word document (MD5:\nf6fafb7c30b1114befc93f39d0698560) that exploited CVE-2012-0158. It is worth noting that\n**this email appeared to have been sent from another Taiwanese Government employee,**\n**implying that the email was sent from a valid but compromised account.**\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT12 Spearphishing Email\n\n\nFigure 2: APT12 Spearphishing\n\nEmail\nThe exploit document dropped the HIGHTIDE backdoor with the following properties:\n\nMD5 6e59861931fa2796ee107dc27bfdd480\n\nSize 75264 bytes\n\nComplie Time 2014-08-23 08:22:49\n\nImport Hash ead55ef2b18a80c00786c25211981570\n\nThe HIGHTIDE backdoor connected directly to 141.108.2.157. If you compare the HTTP\nGET request from the RIPTIDE samples (Figure 1) to the HTTP GET request from the\nHIGHTIDE samples (Figure 3) you can see the malware author changed the following items:\n\nUser Agent\nFormat and structure of the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n\n\n-----\n\nHIGHTIDE GET Request Example\n\n\nFigure 3: HIGHTIDE GET\n\nRequest Example\nSimilar to RIPTIDE campaigns, APT12 infects target systems with HIGHTIDE using a\nMicrosoft Word (.doc) document that exploits CVE-2012-0158. FireEye observed APT12\ndeliver these exploit documents via phishing emails in multiple cases. Based on past APT12\nactivity, we expect the threat group to continue to utilize phishing as a malware delivery\nmethod.\n\nMD5 File Name Exploit\n\n73f493f6a2b0da23a79b50765c164e88 議程最新修正及注意事項.doc CVE20120158\n\nf6fafb7c30b1114befc93f39d0698560 0824.1.doc CVE20120158\n\n\neaa6e03d9dae356481215e3a9d2914dc 簡易名冊0全國各警察機關主官至分局\n長.doc\n\n\nCVE20120158\n\n\n06da4eb2ab6412c0dc7f295920eb61c4 附檔.doc CVE20120158\n\n\n-----\n\n53baedf3765e27fb465057c48387c9b6 103年第3屆通訊錄.doc CVE20120158\n\n\n00a95fb30be2d6271c491545f6c6a707 2014 09 17 Welcome Reception for\nBob and Jason_invitation.doc\n\n4ab6bf7e6796bb930be2dd0141128d06 產諮會_Y103(2)委員會_從東協新興\n國家崛起(0825).doc\n\nFigure 4: Identified exploit documents for HIGHTIDE\n\n\nCVE20120158\n\nCVE20120158\n\n\nWhen the file is opened, it drops HIGHTIDE in the form of an executable file onto the\ninfected system.\n\nRIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE differ on several points: executable file location, image base\naddress, the User-Agent within the GET requests, and the format of the URI. The RIPTIDE\nexploit document drops its executable file into the C:\\Documents and Settings\\\n{user}\\Application Data\\Location folder while the HIGHTIDE exploit document drops its\nexecutable file into the C:\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\{user}\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\Temp\\\nfolder. All but one sample that we identified were written to this folder as word.exe. The one\noutlier was written as winword.exe.\n\nResearch into this HIGHTIDE campaign revealed APT12 targeted multiple Taiwanese\nGovernment organizations between August 22 and 28.\n\n**THREEBYTE Malware Family**\n\nOn Monday August 25, 2014 we observed a different spear phish email sent from\nlilywang823@gmail.com to a technology company located in Taiwan. This spear phish\ncontained a malicious Word document that exploited CVE-2012-0158. The MD5 of the\nexploit document was e009b95ff7b69cbbebc538b2c5728b11.\n\nSimilar to the newly discovered HIGHTIDE samples documented above, this malicious\ndocument dropped a backdoor to C:\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\{user}\\LOCAL\nSETTINGS\\Temp\\word.exe. This backdoor had the following properties:\n\nMD5 16e627dbe730488b1c3d448bfc9096e2\n\nSize 75776 bytes\n\nComplie Time 2014-08-25 01:22:20\n\nImport Hash dcfaa2650d29ec1bd88e262d11d3236f\n\n\n-----\n\nThis backdoor sent the following callback traffic to video[.]csmcpr[.]com:\n\n\nTHREEBYTE GET Request Beacon\n\n\nFigure 5: THREEBYTE GET\n\nRequest Beacon\nThe THREEBYTE spear phishing incident (while not yet attributed) shared the following\ncharacteristics with the above HIGHTIDE campaign attributed to APT12:\n\nThe THREEBYTE backdoor was compiled two days after the HIGHTIDE backdoors.\nBoth the THREEBYTE and HIGHTIDE backdoors were used in attacks targeting\norganizations in Taiwan.\nBoth the THREEBYTE and HIGHTIDE backdoors were written to the same filepath of\nC:\\DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\\{user}\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\Temp\\word.exe.\nAPT12 has previously used the THREEBYTE backdoor.\n\n**WATERSPOUT Malware Family**\n\nOn August 25, 2014, we observed another round of spear phishing emails targeting a hightechnology company in Japan. Attached to this email was another malicious document that\nwas designed to exploit CVE-2012-0158. This malicious Word document had an MD5 of\n499bec15ac83f2c8998f03917b63652e and dropped a backdoor to C:\\DOCUMENTS and\nSETTINGS\\{user}\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\Temp\\word.exe. The backdoor had the following\nproperties:\n\nMD5 f9cfda6062a8ac9e332186a7ec0e706a\n\n\n-----\n\nSize 49152 bytes\n\nComplie Time 2014-08-25 02:10:11\n\nImport Hash 864cd776c24a3c653fd89899ca32fe0b\n\nThe backdoor connects to a command and control server at icc[.]ignorelist[.]com.\n\nSimilar to RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE, the WATERSPOUT backdoor is an HTTP-based\nbackdoor that communicates with its C2 server.\n\nGET /<string>/<5 digit number>/<4 character string>.php?<first 3 characters of last\nstring>_id=<43 character string>= HTTP/1.1\nAccept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif, application/xaml+xml,\nimage/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2;\n.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\nHost: <C2 Location>\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nFigure 6: Sample GET request for WATERSPOUT backdoor\n\nAlthough there are no current infrastructure ties to link this backdoor to APT12, there are\nseveral data points that show a possible tie to the same actors:\n\nSame initial delivery method (spear phishing email) with a Microsoft Word Document\nexploiting CVE-2012-0158.\n\nAlthough these points do not definitively tie WATERSPOUT to APT12, they do indicate a\npossible connection between the WATERSPOUT campaign, the THREEBYTE campaign,\nand the HIGHTIDE campaign attributed to APT12.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFireEye believes the change from RIPTIDE to HIGHTIDE represents a temporary tool shift to\ndecrease malware detection while APT12 developed a completely new malware toolset.\nThese development efforts may have resulted in the emergence of the WATERSPOUT\nbackdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompile dates for all three malware families\n\n\nFigure 7: Compile dates for all\n\nthree malware families\nAPT12’s adaptations to public disclosures lead FireEye to make several conclusions about\nthis threat group:\n\nThough public disclosures resulted in APT12 adaptations, FireEye observed only a brief\npause in APT12 activity before the threat actors returned to normal activity levels. Similarly,\nthe public disclosure of APT12’s intrusion at the New York Times also led to only a brief\npause in the threat group’s activity and immediate changes in TTPs. The pause and retooling\n[by APT12 was covered in the Mandiant 2014 M-Trends report. Currently, APT12 continues to](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage)\ntarget organizations and conduct cyber operations using its new tools. Most recently, FireEye\nobserved HIGHTIDE at multiple Taiwan-based organizations and the suspected APT12\nWATERSPOUT backdoor at a Japan-based electronics company. We expect that APT12 will\ncontinue their trend and evolve and change its tactics to stay ahead of network defenders.\n\n[Note: IOCs for this campaign can be found here.](https://github.com/mandiant/iocs/blob/master/APT12/2384c8ce-6eca-4d06-8aa4-151b53d9a6bc.ioc)\n\n\n-----",
