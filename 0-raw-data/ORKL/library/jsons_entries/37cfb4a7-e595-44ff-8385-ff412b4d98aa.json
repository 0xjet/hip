Mariposa Overview\n\nDefence Intelligence first observed Mariposa in May of 2009 as an emerging botnet. In\nthe following months, Mariposa showed a significant increase in beaconing traffic to its\ncommand and control servers. This is indicative of an increasingly high number of\ncompromised computers actively participating in the Mariposa botnet.\n\nThe most dangerous capability of this botnet is that arbitrary executable programs are\ndownloaded and executed on command. This allows the bot master to infinitely extend\nthe functionality of the malicious software beyond what is implemented during the initial\ncompromise. In addition, the malware can be updated on command to a new variant of\nthe binary, effectively reducing or eliminating the detection rates of traditional host\ndetection methods.\n\nCommands from the botnet master may be directed at participants in a specific country,\nindividual computers, or all computers. As a result, the observation of the live command\nand control channel may not include all of the activity and capabilities of Mariposa.\n\nThe command and control channel employs custom encrypted UDP datagrams to\nreceive instructions and transmit data. A detailed analysis of the encryption and\nmessage formats used by the Mariposa.A protocol are presented in this paper.\n\nDuring empirical analysis of internal controlled compromised systems, the following\nDNS domain names were observed as the command and control servers:\n\n      - lalundelau.sinip.es\n\n     - bf2back.sinip.es\n\n     - thejacksonfive.mobi\n\n     - thejacksonfive.us\n\n     - thejacksonfive.biz\n\n     - butterfly.BigMoney.biz\n\n      - bfisback.sinip.es\n\n     - bfisback.no-ip.org\n\n     - qwertasdfg.sinip.es\n\n     - shv4b.getmyip.com\n\n     - shv4.no-ip.biz\n\n      - butterfly.sinip.es\n\n      - defintelsucks.sinip.es\n\n     - defintelsucks.net\n\n     - defintelsucks.com\n\n     - gusanodeseda.sinip.es\n\n     - gusanodeseda.net\n\n      - legion.sinip.es\n\nD f I t lli 2 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\n      - booster.estr.es\n\n     - sexme.in\n\n      - extraperlo.biz\n\n     - legionarios.servecounterstrike.com\n\n     - thesexydude.com\n\n     - yougotissuez.com\n\n     - gusanodeseda.mobi\n\n      - tamiflux.org\n\n      - tamiflux.net\n\n     - binaryfeed.in\n\n     - youare.sexidude.com\n\n     - mierda.notengodominio.com\n\nThe above list consists of all Mariposa related domains including all command and\ncontrol servers observed from May 2009 to the present.\n\nOver two weeks of analysis conducted in October 2009, two unique malicious programs\nwere downloaded and executed on the compromised computers. One malware update\nwas received during this period, introducing new command and control domain names,\nadding a ʻconfirmation of downloadʼ message, and renaming ASCII commands.\n\nIt has also been observed that the botnet participants are receiving Google custom\nsearch engine URL fragments in a command from the bot master. This indicates a\npossible hijacking of Google AdSense advertisement revenue.\n\nThis paper details the result of static binary analysis, a review of the command and\ncontrol protocols including a breakdown of the encryption, and empirical behaviour\nanalysis findings conducted in October 2009.A brief description of more recent events\ncan be found at the end of this paper.\n\nThanks to a coordinated effort by the Mariposa Working Group, including our partners at\nPanda Security and the Georgia Tech Information Security Center, the Mariposa botnet\ncommand and control servers were shut down December 23, 2009. At the time of this\npublication, Mariposa consists of an estimated 12.7 million compromised personal,\ncorporate, government and university computer systems. Forensic analysis is ongoing\nbut sensitive data stolen from victims in more than 190 countries, including account\ninformation, usernames, passwords, banking credentials, and credit card data has\nalready been recovered.\n\n# 2. Traditional Detection Rates\n\nTwo samples of the botnet client malware were submitted to VirusTotal.\n\nD f I t lli 3 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MD5 hash of the original sample is f4e2c305ef2d38b6d4e4be9d19de16ed. As of\nOctober 8th, this variant of the binary was detected by 36 out of 41 anti-virus vendors\naccording to VirusTotal.\n\nThe MD5 hash of the updated sample is 98812839bd6597ec86fad72a0f20d4e5. This\nvariant of the binary was detected by 14 out of 41 anti-virus vendors according to\nVirusTotal. It is clear that binary updates are active and are intended to reduce the antivirus detection rates.\n\nD f I t lli 4 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo of the payload binaries that were downloaded and executed through the Mariposa\nbotnet were also submitted to VirusTotal.\n\nThe executable payload “81.exe” with the MD5 hash\n56902dc35453158a34e85db5b590ab19 that was commanded to be executed on\nOctober 4th had a detection rate of 3 out of 41.\n\nThe executable payload “8” with the MD5 hash c4e13b7cb9425ef18d95d446cad9c3e0\nthat was commanded to be executed on October 2nd had a detection rate of 6 out of\n41.\n\n# 3. Static Binary Analysis\n\nStatic binary analysis was performed on a selected sample prior to October 4th, and on\nthe updated binary received on October 4th. The latter sample was used to analyze the\nremote thread in Section 3.3 to provide the most recent information. The methods used\nfor obfuscation, packing and anti-debugging are pertinent to both of the analyzed\nsamples.\n\n**3.1.Obfuscation and Packing**\n\nThe program entry point begins with an obfuscated loop that contains a mixture\nof meaningless SIMD and FPU instructions. At the end of the loop, the code\njumps to an address that begins to XOR the .text section of the image in RAM\nwith the constant 0x0CB2DC4AA.\n\nThe address of the decoded .text section is pushed onto the stack, and a RETN\ninstruction is used to pass control to the decoded code. This code starts the antidebugging techniques described in Section 3.2.\n\nD f I t lli 5 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.2.Anti-Debugging**\n\nFour anti-debugging techniques are used in the packed binary to prevent runtime\ndebugging of the unpacker and binary dropping process. The program will crash\nif a debugger is detected.\n\nTwo anti-debugging techniques are used in the second stage dropped binary, as\nwell as the update executables.\n\n**3.2.1.OutputDebugStringA() Return Value**\n\nOutputDebugStringA() is called with a valid ASCII string. The return value\nin the EAX register is added with the address of the next instruction. If the\nprocess is under debugger control, the EAX register will contain the\naddress of the ASCII string, causing the upcoming RETN instruction to\njump to a bad address.\n\nTo circumvent this anti-debugger technique, set the EAX register to 0\nbefore executing the ADD instruction.\n\n**3.2.2.Stack Segment Register**\n\nThe stack segment register technique is also used to prevent debugging\nof the process. See **[http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1893 (6)](http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1893)**\nStack Segment register\n\n**3.2.3.NtQueryInformationProcess()**\n\nThe NtQueryInformationProcess() function in ntdll is used to determine if a\nDebugPort is currently available for the process. The return value of the\nfunction is checked to determine if the process is under debugger control.\n\n**3.2.4.OllyDbg Crash**\n\nA specific sequence of bytes is placed in the .text section that exploit a\nweakness in the OllyDbg disassembler. When OllyDbg attempts to display\nthe disassembly for this sequence of bytes the OllyDbg process will crash.\n\n_This issue does not exist with the latest Version 2 Beta2 of OllyDbg._\n\n**3.2.5.BeingDebugged Flag**\n\nThe first anti-debugging technique uses the BeingDebugged flag in the\nProcess Environment Block (PEB). If the flag does not equal 0, the\nprogram exits gracefully.\n\nD f I t lli 6 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.2.6.NtGlobalFlag DebugHeap**\n\nThe second anti-debugging technique uses the DebugHeap flag in the\nNtGlobalFlag word in the Process Environment Block (PEB). If the\nDebugHeap flag is set, the program exits gracefully.\n\n**3.3.Remote Thread**\n\n**3.3.1.Injection**\n\nA remote process executable name is taken from the strings in the\ndecoded .data section. The injection enumerates the process list using\nProcess32First() and Process32Next() comparing the result with the string\n“explorer.exe”. If the process is found, the process ID is returned.\n\nUsing the process ID of the target, VirtualAllocEx() is used to allocate five\nmemory regions in the target processʼ virtual address space.\n\nData is copied from regions of resident memory into the target using\nZwWriteVirtualMemory(). These regions include the thread code, data, the\n\n[Autorun] string used by the USB spreader, pointers to library imports, a\nregion containing the target binary name, and “Desktop.ini”.\n\nFollowing injection of the data into the target process,\nCreateRemoteThread() is called to start a new thread inside the target\nprocess.\n\nDuring the analysis process, the string “explorer.exe” was changed to\nanother process name to have the thread injected and run in another\nbinary running under the OllyDbg debugger. A breakpoint was added to\nthe thread entry point to stop execution upon thread creation.\n\nD f I t lli 7 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\nThe parameters to the CreateRemoteThread() function are on the stack\ncontaining the process ID of the target and the StartAddress for the thread\nin the virtual address space of the target process.\n\n**3.3.2.Functionality**\n\nThe thread that is started in the target process performs the following:\n\n        - copies the source binary filename to the C:\\RECYCLER folder as\n\n“dllrun32.exe”. It loads ws2_32.dll, advapi32.dll, user32.dll,\nwininet.dll, and shell32.dll.\n\n         - calls WSAStartup() to initialize the sockets API.\n\n         - modifies the Winlogin registry entries to enable the bot to start at boot\n\n         - creates a named pipe: “\\\\.\\pipe\\nemntkentktkj”\n\n         - calls InternetOpenA(“Mozilla”)\n\n        - calls RegisterClassExA “nonoclass”\n\n        - calls CreateWindowExA “nonoclass” with WS_OVERLAPPED flag\n\nA loop is entered that starts by decoding the command and control DNS\nnames from RAM, in the first case “lalundelau.sinip.es” is retrieved.\n\nFor each command and control domain:\n\n        - PeekMessageA() is called.\n\n         - socket() is called to create a socket.\n\n          - ioctlsocket() is called.\n\n         - gethostbyname() is called to perform a DNS resolution of the\n\ndecoded command and control domain name.\n\n         - htons(5096) is called to get the target port in network byte order.\n\n         - the string “bpr2” is encrypted and sent to the command and control\n\nserver with sendto(). This is the initial association command sent to\nthe command and control server.\n\nD f I t lli 8 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther static analysis was not performed as the encryption method was\ndetermined at this point. Analysis has been focused on the command and\ncontrol protocol and empirical behaviour. Refer to Section 4, and Section 5\nfor further details.\n\n# 4. Command and Control Protocol Analysis\n\n**4.1.Overview**\n\nThe command and control protocol uses a 3 byte header which contains an\nopcode, a 2 byte sequence number, and an encrypted payload. The encryption\nscheme is described in Section 4.2.\n\n**Byte Position**\n\n**0** **1** **2** **3..n**\n\nOpcode SeqNum Low SeqNum High Encrypted Payload\n\nOpcodes:\n\n    - 0x01: Command/Response\n\n     - 0x61: Join server message\n\n     - 0x40: Join server acknowledgement\n\n     - 0x80: Acknowledgement\n\nThe first byte of the decrypted payload contains a Command Type. The following\ntable shows the command types that were observed on the command and\ncontrol channel. The 0xDA Command Type was observed once on October 5th\nand contained 120 bytes of binary data.\n\n**Command Type** **Description** **Payload Length**\n\n0x12 (If opcode==0x40) 32 bit IP Address 4 bytes\n\n0x12 (If opcode==0x01) System Information/ Variable\nCountry Code from bot to\nserver\n\n0x14 ASCII String Variable\n\n0x51 Disconnect C&C 0\n\n0x62 Connect “bpr2” string 4 bytes\n\n0xD1 Binary/ASCII String Variable\n\n0xDA Unknown binary data 120 (Observed)\n\nD f I t lli 9 M tt Th\n\n|Byte Position|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|0|1|2|3..n|\n|Opcode|SeqNum Low|SeqNum High|Encrypted Payload|\n\n|Command Type|Description|Payload Length|\n|---|---|---|\n|0x12 (If opcode==0x40)|32 bit IP Address|4 bytes|\n|0x12 (If opcode==0x01)|System Information/ Country Code from bot to server|Variable|\n|0x14|ASCII String|Variable|\n|0x51|Disconnect C&C|0|\n|0x62|Connect “bpr2” string|4 bytes|\n|0xD1|Binary/ASCII String|Variable|\n|0xDA|Unknown binary data|120 (Observed)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.2.Encryption**\n\nThe encryption is a basic XOR of each ciphertext byte using two alternating\nvalues. The XOR values are recovered from the sequence numbers and the\nbitwise not of the payload length.\n\nThe following code demonstrates the encryption/decryption process.\n\n\nuint8_t not;\nuint8_t xor[2];\nuint8_t alt;\n\nnot = ~(uint8_t)payload_length;\nxor[0] = not ^ data[1];\nxor[1] = not ^ data[2];\n\nfor(pos=3;pos<length;pos++)\n{\n� data[pos] = data[pos] ^ xor[alt];\n\n� // Alternate the XOR value array index\n� alt ^= 1;\n}\n\n\nThe screenshot above shows the disassembly of the decryption loop being\ndebugged in the remote thread.\n\nD f I t lli 10 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.3.Command Set**\n\nCommands are sent from the command and control server to the bot process as\nencrypted ASCII messages. The following table shows the commands that have\nbeen observed on the command and control channel of the Mariposa botnet.\n\nAs of October 4th, the ʻdownloadʼ command has been renamed to ʻtrinkaʼ.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nalinfiernoya Remove the bot\n\ntrinka <download URL> Download and run executable\n\npillaestenuevoya <update URL> Update Malware\n\ngg0 Disable google\n\ngg1 <google custom search info> Enable google\n\nch1 <IP address list> Channel IP list\n\nu1 Enable USB Spreader\n\nu0 Disable USB Spreader\n\ns1 <channel number> Silence channel\n\nm0 Disable MSN Spreader\n\nm1 <URL> Enable MSN Spreader\n\n# 5. Empirical Behaviour Analysis\n\n**5.1.Observation Environment**\n\nThe observation environment consists of two compromised Windows XP Pro SP2\ncomputers. Each computer has a public static IP address, connected to a switch\nand a Linux router. The tcpdump utility was used on the Linux router to capture\npackets with a MAC address filter to retrieve separate dumps for each\ncompromised system.\n\n**5.2.Domain Resolution Queries**\n\nPrior to the update on October 4th, the following DNS lookups were observed:\n\n     - butterfly.BigMoney.biz\n\n      - bfisback.sinip.es\n\n     - qwertasdfg.sinip.es\n�\n\nD f I t lli 11 M tt Th\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|alinfiernoya|Remove the bot|\n|trinka <download URL>|Download and run executable|\n|pillaestenuevoya <update URL>|Update Malware|\n|gg0|Disable google|\n|gg1 <google custom search info>|Enable google|\n|ch1 <IP address list>|Channel IP list|\n|u1|Enable USB Spreader|\n|u0|Disable USB Spreader|\n|s1 <channel number>|Silence channel|\n|m0|Disable MSN Spreader|\n|m1 <URL>|Enable MSN Spreader|\n\n\n-----\n\n� Following the October 4th update, the ensuing DNS lookups were observed:\n\n      - lalundelau.sinip.es\n\n     - bf2back.sinip.es\n\n     - thejacksonfive.mobi\n\n**5.3.UDP Command and Control Connections**\n\nConnections were observed to the following IP addresses:\n\n     - 62.128.52.191\n\n     - 200.74.244.84\n\n     - 66.197.176.41\n\n     - 24.173.86.145\n\n     - 74.208.162.142\n\n     - 87.106.179.75\n\n     - 204.16.173.30\n\n     - 76.73.56.12\n\nConnections were observed using the following ports (listed chronologically):\n\n     - 5906\n\n     - 5907\n\n     - 3431\n\n     - 3435\n\n     - 3437\n\n     - 3434\n\n     - 3433\n\n**5.4.Decrypted Command and Control Commands**\n\nThe command and control communication channel is initiated by the bot sending\na UDP message containing the connect command to the server.\n\nMariposa UDP x.x.144.158:1156 -> 200.74.244.84:3431 Payload [7]: 61 A2 24 62 70 72 32 Connect.\n\nThe server responds with the 0x40 opcode, with the 0x12 command type\nfollowed by the 4 byte IP address.

BlackEnergy DDoS\n\nOn November 3 2009, a new binary was downloaded from rapidshare as instructed by\nbutterfly.bigmoney.biz. This file, named blackjackson.exe, was found to be version 1.92\nof the BlackEnergy DDoS bot and along with its installation came a new command and\ncontrol domain, thejacksonfive.us. Both thejacksonfive.us and thejacksonfive.mobi are\nnow also used as web based GUI controls for BlackEnergy.\n\nA good writeup on BlackEnergy can be found in Arbor's [BlackEnergy+DDoS+Bot](http://atlas-public.ec2.arbor.net/docs/BlackEnergy+DDoS+Bot+Analysis.pdf)\n[+Analysis.pdf. A third related domain, tamiflux.net, is also used as a web interface for](http://atlas-public.ec2.arbor.net/docs/BlackEnergy+DDoS+Bot+Analysis.pdf)\nthe DDOS malware and is currently the only one blacklisted by Firefox.\n\nOn November 4th, thejacksonfive.us issued a command to begin an HTTP GET request\nflood of three domains and one IP:\n\nal-hora.net\nsaaid.net\nislamlight.net\n74.86.18.4 (the IP address for saaid.net)\n\nThese Saudi Arabian sites appear to be forums for religious and regional political\ndiscussion so the motivation behind the attacks may also be religious or political. Alhora.com has been targeted for \"censorship\" for quite some time now and has\napparently been kept offline since December 2007. Read more at [www.rsf.org.](http://www.rsf.org/en-ennemi26081-Saudi_Arabia.html)\nCurrently, of the sites being targeted, only saaid.net has managed to recover from the\nattacks.\n\nOn November 5, thejacksonfive.us changed orders to alter the attack slightly, using a\nSYN flood instead of a GET request flood and only targeting islamlight.net and\nsaaid.net. This alteration was likely made in response to saaid.net's sustained presence\nonline. (They talk about the attack on the home page.) Tamiflux.net is HTTP flooding the\nsame domains. Gaining some insight into the attacks we've discovered that the DDOS\nbotnet has about 5500 members under active control at any given time.\n\nD f I t lli 14 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\n# 7. Mariposa Defined\n\nDefence Intelligence received quite a few responses to our announcement of the\nMariposa botnet. They have run the gamut from polite information inquiries to\naccusations of falsifying our findings for media coverage, and thinly veiled threats of\nlegal action. A response of our own has become necessary and we hope it at least\nanswers some common questions many of you have asked.\n\n**Who is Defence Intelligence?**\n\nTo begin with we are not an antivirus company. We have spent the last 14 years\nprotecting companies from hackers, not viruses. Until just a few years ago a virus and a\nhacker had very little to do with each other. Viruses are annoying and at times\ndestructive but pose very little actual threat to a company or government's information\nand its assets. A hacker's goal on the other hand is to stealthily gain control of a\ntargeted system with the intent of stealing data, attacking the internal network, or using\nthe controlled system to attack an external network.\n\nIn the last few years these two distinct threats have blended. Hackers have discovered\nthat direct external attacks are unnecessary and risky. It is now easier to engineer\nmalicious software that is delivered to a system remotely through various means. Once\nthat malicious software is on an internal computer, it then communicates outbound to\nthe hacker, handing them complete control of the affected system.\n\n_When a system is compromised in this manner the attack is all too often_\n_misunderstood and dismissed as a mere virus, not just by the victim but by those_\n\n_providing that victimʼs system security._\n\nThe Defence Intelligence team comes from an information security background, and not\nan antivirus background, which means we view things differently. Within incident\nresponse, multiple events form an incident and events are constructed using various\ncomponents. IP addresses, domain names, binaries, people, companies, and networks\nare all parts of this particular incident, which in this case, is a botnet.\n\n**What is Mariposa?**\n\nMariposa is a collection of compromised computers that are directly under the control of\na single malicious entity. In the security industry we call this a botnet.\n\nMariposa is NOT a virus, or a worm, or a trojan or any other dated designation still\ninappropriately assigned to modern day malware. The malicious software used by\nMariposa, and any other botnet, actively evolves to become whatever is needed by its\ncontroller and is not limited by the boundaries of antivirus labels. This means that a\n\nD f I t lli 15 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\ntrojan can be told to spread like a worm. It means that malware designed to send spam\ncan be instructed to steal banking information.\n\nModern malware can no longer be classified by its perceived purpose or propagation\nmethod because those change in an instant. This software is engineered to gain access\nto and maintain control over the victim machine, and infiltrating a userʼs computer is not\ndifficult. Using a variety of software exploits and social engineering tactics, an attacker\nwill find a way to distribute his malware to his victims.\n\n_Panda Security recently released a report indicating that almost 60% of all PCs scanned_\n\n_in a month was compromised with malware of some kind._\n\nOnce the malware is on the system it seeks communication with its controlling entity.\nWith communication to the controlling entity, any compromised machine can be capable\nof carrying out any order issued by the botnet controller and any data on the\ncompromised machine can be extracted for use, sale or distribution by the attacker.\n\n**Why did you call it Mariposa?**\n\nOur naming of this botnet as Mariposa has been a cause of concern for some. The\nconfusion comes when antivirus companies or those using antivirus, search for the\nMariposa name only to find no results. This is because Mariposa refers to the botnet\nand not the malware it utilizes.\n\nThe malware used by Mariposa goes by many names, and this is part of the problem.\nEven amongst antivirus groups and within their own companies it is difficult to find a\ncommon name for any one family of malware.\n\nBelow are some of the names attributed to binaries which are used within Mariposa that\nare detected by McAfee and Trend. This provides a quality example for the current\nconfusion in botnet malware identification.\n\n**McAfee�** **Trend**\nW32/Autorun.worm.zzq� WORM_AUTORUN.ZRO\nW32/Virut.n.gen� WORM_Generic.DIT\nDownloader-BQP� TROJ_Generic.DIT\nW32/Autorun.worm.zzk� PE_VIRUX.A\nPWS-Zbot� WORM_PALEVO.T\nGeneric.dx!dpk� WORM_PALEVO.AZ\nDownloader-BRW� WORM_PALEVO.AS\nW32/Virut.j� WORM_AUTORUN.EUC\nW32/Autorun.worm.fq� WORM_AUTORUN.EPB\nW32/Autorun.worm.c� TSPY_ZBOT.SMQ\nW32/Autorun.worm!bf� PE_VIRUX.F-1\nGeneric.dx!la� PE_VIRUX.E\nGeneric.dx!ha� PE_VIRUX.D\nGeneric.dx!dqe� PE_VIRUX.C-1\n\nD f I t lli 16 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is our hope that perhaps not in our terminology, but with our methodology, that\nDefence Intelligence can provide some guidance to improve upon the multiple naming\nconvention, allowing a clearer arena for botnet discussion and understanding.\n\n**Why didnʼt my AV pick this up?**\n\nUsing signatures and automated classification, especially when involving heuristics,\nresults in a cacophony of naming options for every distinct variant of a given piece of\nmalware. That said, many AV companies have had the ability to detect some variations\nof the malware behind Mariposa long before we became aware of this botnetʼs activity.\n\nWith our approach to compromise detection, utilized by our Nemesis software, we can\ndetect the botnet which allows the organization to track down systems affected by the\nmalware, regardless of the variant or antivirus identification ability. While AV companies\nlook at single binaries and classify based upon discrete behavior of code, or the packer\nthat is used to obfuscate the binary, we look at the threat holistically, a macro versus\nmicro approach.\n\nAt Defence Intelligence we consider the code used within Mariposa as only one\nidentifying factor. Command structure is another. This is defined by domain names, IP\naddresses, and communication protocols and the fluctuation of each. We also consider\nthe end point organization or individual over the botnet, ultimately any indicator as to\nwho is responsible for the formation and/or control of the hosts affected by this malware.\n\nWith perpetual addition of variants and updates, the reliance on AV detection to keep\npace is not advised. VirusTotal is a free web based service that analyzes files through\nmultiple antivirus engines, revealing their detection capability of any suspected\nmalware.

At that point, however, the\nmalware has potentially fulfilled any of its initial goals and its removal might be a futile\nand meaningless task. Unfortunately, Mariposa does not use static malware.\n\nMalware authors often update their code to evade detection as well as try different\nconfigurations, all of which result in a new malware variant. Mariposa has approximately\n1500 variants, resulting in a persistent and dynamic botnet.\n\nOne example is this update file recently dropped onto a compromised system as\ninstructed by the Mariposa botnet controller. VirusTotal shows that only two of the 41 AV\ngroups currently detect it.\n\nD f I t lli 19 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\nFile svc.exe received on 2009.09.29 15:27:36 (UTC)\nCurrent status: finished\nResult: 2/41 (4.88%)\n\n[http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/7987d324cedbfeb9df94f7cbaf0ed2091431d6443c5b5fbff6ad7a7c380bf8d3-1254238056)\n\n[7987d324cedbfeb9df94f7cbaf0ed2091431d6443c5b5fbff6ad7a7c380bf8d3-1254238056](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/7987d324cedbfeb9df94f7cbaf0ed2091431d6443c5b5fbff6ad7a7c380bf8d3-1254238056)\n\nA signature may soon come out for this code from your AV vendor, but by that time, a\nnew piece of code may be written and downloaded that bypasses AV yet again.\n\n**Well, how do I stop this thing?**\n\nAs IPs, ports, and domains involved in the command structure of Mariposa are\nchanging, it becomes difficult for security administrators to mitigate the capabilities of\nthis botnet. At this time we suggest an approach of tracking down the compromised\nsystems rather than establish rules to block the communication to the botnet controller.\nUDP connections are still actively used for Mariposa communication, so observance of\nyour network activity is the best place to start. If one system is frequently sending data\nacross the outbound UDP protocol, regardless of port, mark it as suspicious and\nconsider removing it from the network. Your own remediation technique is up to you but\nreimaging, though time consuming, is the only confident way to cleanse a compromised\nmachine.\n\n# 8. Updates\n\nAntivirus detection rates have increased significantly since Mariposa was shut down.\nPanda Security is coordinating international communication among other antivirus\ncompanies to ensure that their signatures are updated.\n\nThe executable payload “81” with the MD5 hash\n56902dc35453158a34e85db5b590ab19 that was commanded to be executed on\nOctober 4th had a detection rate of 3 out of 41 when it was first submitted. VirusTotal\nresults are now 31 out of 41 (75.61%).\n\nThe executable payload “8” with the MD5 hash c4e13b7cb9425ef18d95d446cad9c3e0\nthat was commanded to be executed on October 2nd originally had a detection rate of 6\nout of 41. VirusTotal results are now 34 out of 41 (82.93%).\n\nIn November 2009, Mariposa updated to a new version that utilizes a 21 byte protocol\ninstead of the 7 byte analyzed in this paper. More information may be provided in the\nfuture.\n\nD f I t lli 20 M tt Th\n\n\n-----\n\n# 9. Thank You\n\nDefence Intelligence would like to express its utmost thanks to all individuals,\ncompanies and agencies involved either directly or indirectly in the takedown of the\nMariposa botnet. You worked tirelessly to rid the Internet of this scourge and your\ndedicated effort is appreciated. We look forward to working with you again soon.\n\nD f I t lli 21 M tt Th\n\n\n-----",
