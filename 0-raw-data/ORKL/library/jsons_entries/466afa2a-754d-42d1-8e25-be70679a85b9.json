Have you ever looked in wonder at satellite phones or satellite-based Internet**\n\n**connections wondering what makes them tick? What if we told you that there’s more to satellite-based**\n\n**Internet connections than entertainment, traffic and weather? Much, much more.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**When you are an APT group, you need to deal with many different problems. One of them, and perhaps**\n\n**the biggest, is the constant seizure and takedown of domains and servers used for command-and-**\n\n**control (C&C). These servers are constantly appropriated by law enforcement or shut down by ISPs.**\n\n**Sometimes they can be used to trace the attackers back to their physical locations.**\n\n**Some of the most advanced threat actors or users of commercial hacking tools have found a solution to**\n\n**the takedown problem — the use of satellite-based Internet links. In the past, we’ve seen three different**\n\n**actors using such links to mask their operations. The most interesting and unusual of them is the Turla**\n\n**group.**\n\n**Also known as Snake or Uroburos, names which come from its top class rootkit, the Turla cyber-**\n\n**espionage group has been active for more than 8 years. Several papers have been published about the**\n\n**[group’s operations, but until the Epic Turla research was published by Kaspersky Lab, little information](http://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/)**\n\n**was available about the more unusual aspects of their operations, such as the first stages of infection**\n\n**through watering-hole attacks.**\n\n**What makes the Turla group special is not just the complexity of its tools, which include the Uroboros**\n\n**rootkit, aka “Snake”, as well as mechanisms designed to bypass air gaps through multi-stage proxy**\n\n**networks inside LANs, but the exquisite satellite-based C&C mechanism used in the latter stages of the**\n\n**attack.**\n\n**In this blog, we hope to shed more light on the satellite-based C&C mechanisms that APT groups,**\n\n**including the Turla/Snake group, use to control their most important victims. As the use of these**\n\n**mechanisms becomes more popular, it’s important for system administrators to deploy the correct**\n\n**defense strategies to mitigate such attacks. For IOCs, see the appendix.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Although relatively rare, since 2007 several elite APT groups have been using — and abusing —**\n\n**satellite links to manage their operations — most often, their C&C infrastructure. Turla is one of them.**\n\n**Using this approach offers some advantages, such as making it hard to identify the operators behind**\n\n**the attack, but it also poses some risks to the attackers.**\n\n**On the one hand, it’s valuable because the true location and hardware of the C&C server cannot be**\n\n**easily determined or physically seized. Satellite-based Internet receivers can be located anywhere**\n\n**within the area covered by a satellite, and this is generally quite large. The method used by the Turla**\n\n**group to hijack the downstream links is highly anonymous and does not require a valid satellite Internet**\n\n**subscription.**\n\n**On the other hand, the disadvantage comes from the fact that satellite-based Internet is slow and can**\n\n**be unstable.**\n\n**In the beginning, it was unclear to us and other researchers whether some of the links observed were**\n\n**commercial Internet connections via satellite, purchased by the attackers, or if the attackers had**\n\n**breached the ISPs and performed Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks at the router level to hijack the**\n\n**stream. We have analyzed these mechanisms and come to the astonishing conclusion that the method**\n\n**used by the Turla group is incredibly simple and straightforward, as well as highly anonymous and very**\n\n**cheap to operate and manage.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**satellite link may cost up to $7000 per week. For longer term contracts this cost may decrease**\n\n**considerably, but the bandwidth still remains very expensive.**\n\n**Another way of getting a C&C server into a satellite’s IP range is to hijack the network traffic between**\n\n**the victim and the satellite operator and to inject packets along the way. This requires either exploitation**\n\n**of the satellite provider itself, or of another ISP on the way.**\n\n**These kinds of hijacking attacks have been observed in the past and were documented by Renesys**\n\n**(now part of Dyn) in a blogpost dated November 2013.**\n\n**According to Renesys: “Various providers’ BGP routes were hijacked, and as a result a portion of their**\n\n**_Internet traffic was misdirected to flow through Belarusian and Icelandic ISPs. We have BGP routing_**\n\n**_data that show the second-by-second evolution of 21 Belarusian events in February and May 2013, and_**\n\n**_17 Icelandic events in July- August 2013.”_**\n\n**[In a more recent blogpost from 2015, Dyn researchers point out that: “For security analysts reviewing](http://research.dyn.com/2015/01/vast-world-of-fraudulent-routing/)**\n\n**_alert logs, it is important to appreciate that the IP addresses identified as the source of incidents can_**\n\n**_and are regularly spoofed. For example, an attack that appeared to come from a Comcast IP located in_**\n\n**_New Jersey may really have been from a hijacker located in Eastern Europe, briefly commandeering_**\n\n**_Comcast IP space. It is interesting to note that all six cases discussed above were conducted from_**\n\n**_either Europe or Russia.”_**\n\n**Obviously, such incredibly apparent and large-scale attacks have little chance of surviving for long**\n\n**periods of time, which is one of the key requirements for running an APT operation. It is therefore not**\n\n**very feasible to perform the attack through MitM traffic hijacking, unless the attackers have direct**\n\n**control over some high-traffic network points, such as backbone routers or fiber optics. There are signs**\n\n**that such attacks are becoming more common, but there is a much simpler way to hijack satellite-**\n\n**based Internet traffic.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The hijacking of satellite DVB-S links has been described a few times in the past and a presentation on**\n\n**[hijacking satellite DVB links was delivered at BlackHat 2010 by the S21Sec researcher Leonardo Nve](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Nve_Leonardo/BlackHat-DC-2010-Nve-Playing-with-SAT-1.2-wp.pdf)**\n\n**Egea.**\n\n**To hijack satellite DVB-S links, one needs the following:**\n\n**A satellite dish – the size depends on geographical position and satellite**\n\n**A low-noise block downconverter (LNB)**\n\n**A dedicated DVB-S tuner (PCIe card)**\n\n**A PC, preferably running Linux**\n\n**While the dish and the LNB are more-or-less standard, the card is perhaps the most important**\n\n**[component. Currently, the best DVB-S cards are made by a company called TBS Technologies. The](http://www.tbsdtv.com/)**\n\n**[TBS-6922SE is perhaps the best entry-level card for the task.](http://www.tbsdtv.com/products/tbs6922se-dvb-s2-tv-tuner-pcie-card.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_TBS-6922SE PCIe card for receiving DVB-S channels_**\n\n**The TBS card is particularly well-suited to this task because it has dedicated Linux kernel drivers and**\n\n**supports a function known as a brute-force scan which allows wide-frequency ranges to be tested for**\n\n**interesting signals. Of course, other PCI or PCIe cards might work as well, while, in general the USB-**\n\n**based cards are relatively poor and should be avoided.**\n\n**Unlike full duplex satellite-based Internet, the downstream-only Internet links are used to accelerate**\n\n**Internet downloads and are very cheap and easy to deploy. They are also inherently insecure and use**\n\n**no encryption to obfuscate the traffic. This creates the possibility for abuse.**\n\n**Companies that provide downstream-only Internet access use teleport points to beam the traffic up to**\n\n**the satellite. The satellite broadcasts the traffic to larger areas on the ground, in the Ku band (12-**\n\n**18Ghz) by routing certain IP classes through the teleport points.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**To attack satellite-based Internet connections, both the legitimate users of these links as well as the**\n\n**attackers’ own satellite dishes point to the specific satellite that is broadcasting the traffic. The attackers**\n\n**abuse the fact that the packets are unencrypted. Once an IP address that is routed through the**\n\n**satellite’s downstream link is identified, the attackers start listening for packets coming from the Internet**\n\n**to this specific IP. When such a packet is identified, for instance a TCP/IP SYN packet, they identify the**\n\n**source and spoof a reply packet (e.g. SYN ACK) back to the source using a conventional Internet line.**\n\n**At the same time, the legitimate user of the link just ignores the packet as it goes to an otherwise**\n\n**unopened port, for instance, port 80 or 10080. There is an important observation to make here:**\n\n**normally, if a packet hits a closed port, a RST or FIN packet will be sent back to the source to indicate**\n\n**that there is nothing expecting the packet. However, for slow links, firewalls are recommended and**\n\n**used to simply DROP packets to closed ports. This creates an opportunity for abuse.**\n\n**During the analysis, we observed the Turla attackers abusing several satellite DVB-S Internet providers,**\n\n**most of them offering downstream-only connections in the Middle East and Africa. Interestingly, the**\n\n**coverage of these beams does not include Europe or Asia, meaning that a dish is required in either the**\n\n**Middle East or Africa. Alternatively, a much larger dish (3m+) can be used in other areas to boost the**\n\n**signal.**\n\n**To calculate the dish size, one can use various tools, including online resources such as**\n\n**satbeams.com:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Sample dish calculation – (c) www.satbeams.com_**\n\n**The table below shows some of the command-and-control servers related to the Turla actor with**\n\n**domains resolving to an IP belonging to satellite-based Internet providers:**\n\n**IP** **First seen** **Hosts**\n\n**84.11.79.6** **Nov, 2007** **n/a, see note below**\n\n**pressforum.serveblog.net**\n**92.62.218.99** **Feb 25th, 2014**\n\n**music-world.servemp3.com**\n\n\n**pressforum.serveblog.net**\n**209.239.79.47** **Feb 27th, 2014**\n\n**music-world.servemp3.com**\n\n**209.239.79.52** **March 18th, 2014** **hockey-news.servehttp.com**\n\n**209.239.79.152** **March 18th, 2014** **hockey-news.servehttp.com**\n\n**209.239.79.33** **January 25th, 2014** **eu-society.com**\n\n**cars-online.zapto.org**\n\n**fifa-rules.25u.com**\n\n**forum.sytes.net**\n\n**health-everyday.faqserv.com**\n\n**music-world.servemp3.com**\n\n\n**92.62.220.170** **March 19th, 2014**\n\n\n**nhl-blog.servegame.com**\n\n**olympik-blog.4dq.com**\n\n**supernews.sytes.net**\n\n**tiger.got-game.org**\n\n**top-facts.sytes.net**\n\n**x-files.zapto.org**\n\n\n-----\n\n**hockey-news.servehttp.com**\n**82.146.174.58** **May 28th, 2014**\n\n**leagueoflegends.servequake.com**\n\n**music-world.servemp3.com**\n\n**82.146.166.56** **March 11th, 2014** **easport-news.publicvm.com**\n\n**82.146.166.62** **June 24th, 2014** **hockey-news.servehttp.com**\n\n**africankingdom.deaftone.com**\n\n**aromatravel.org**\n\n**marketplace.servehttp.com**\n\n\n**62.243.189.231** **April 4th, 2014**\n\n\n**newutils.3utilities.com**\n\n**people-health.net**\n\n**pressforum.serveblog.net**\n\n**weather-online.hopto.org**\n\n\n**77.246.76.19** **March 17th, 2015** **onlineshop.sellclassics.com**\n\n**62.243.189.187** **May 2nd, 2012** **eu-society.com**\n\n**62.243.189.215** **January 3rd, 2013** **people-health.net**\n\n**forum.sytes.net**\n**217.20.243.37** **July 3, 2014**\n\n**music-world.servemp3.com**\n\n**217.20.242.22** **September 1st, 2014** **mediahistory.linkpc.net**\n\n**accessdest.strangled.net**\n\n**chinafood.chickenkiller.com**\n\n**coldriver.strangled.net**\n\n**developarea.mooo.com**\n\n**downtown.crabdance.com**\n\n\n**83.229.75.141** **August 05, 2015**\n\n\n**greateplan.ocry.com**\n\n**industrywork.mooo.com**\n\n**radiobutton.mooo.com**\n\n**securesource.strangled.net**\n\n**sportnewspaper.strangled.net**\n\n**supercar.ignorelist.com**\n\n**supernews.instanthq.com**\n\n\n**_Note: 84.11.79.6 is hardcoded in the configuration block of the malicious sample._**\n\n**The observed satellite IPs have the following ‘WHOIS’ information:**\n\n**IP** **Country** **ISP**\n\n\n**92.62.220.170**\n\n**92.62.219.172**\n\n**92.62.218.99**\n\n\n**Skylinks Satellite**\n**Nigeria**\n\n**Communications Limited**\n\n\n-----\n\n**209.239.79.52**\n\n**209.239.79.152**\n\n**209.239.79.33**\n\n**82.146.174.58**\n\n**82.146.166.56**\n\n**82.146.166.62**\n\n**62.243.189.231**\n\n**62.243.189.187**\n\n**62.243.189.215**\n\n\n**Teleskies, Telesat Network**\n**UAE**\n\n**Services Inc**\n\n**Lebanon** **Lunasat Isp**\n\n**Denmark** **Emperion**\n\n\n**77.246.71.10**\n\n**Lebanon** **Intrasky Offshore S.a.l.**\n**77.246.76.19**\n\n**84.11.79.6** **Germany** **IABG mbH**\n\n**Sky Power International**\n**217.20.243.37** **Somalia**\n\n**Ltd**\n\n**Sky Power International**\n**217.20.242.22** **Nigeria**\n\n**Ltd**\n\n\n**SkyVision Global**\n**83.229.75.141** **United Kingdom**\n\n**Networks Ltd**\n\n**SkyVision Global**\n**217.194.150.31** **Niger**\n\n**Networks Ltd**\n\n**41.190.233.29** **Congo** **Orioncom**\n\n**One interesting case is probably 84.11.79.6, which falls into the satellite IP range of IABG mbH.**\n\n**This IP is encrypted in the C&C of the following backdoor used by Turla group, known as “** **[Agent.DNE“:](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7d5d7a372d6b4b48640fae95238ee74b99be35d8e64b4de5bde8d8d140c91d7c/analysis/1430803399/)**\n\n**md5** **0328dedfce54e185ad395ac44aa4223c**\n\n**size** **91136 bytes**\n\n**type** **Windows PE**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Agent.DNE C&C configuration_**\n\n**This Agent.DNE sample has a compilation timestamp of Thu Nov 22 14:34:15 2007, meaning that the**\n\n**Turla group has been using satellite-based Internet links for almost eight years.**\n\n**The regular usage of satellite-based Internet links by the Turla group represents an interesting aspect**\n\n**of their operation.

When such a packet is identified, for instance a TCP/IP SYN packet,**\n\n**they identify the source and spoof a reply packet (e.g. SYN ACK) back to the source using a conventional Internet line.**\n\n**Say, Alice is the ordinary/legitimate subscriber, Bob sends this SYN packet to her, which is also received by Mallory, and**\n\n**Mallory sends the SYN/ACK. If Bob sends this SYN packet, he probably expects Alice to send the SYN/ACK, which she**\n\n**does. So, both Alice and Mallory send a SYN/ACK. What is Mallory supposed to gain from this?**\n\n**> At the same time, the legitimate user of the link just ignores the packet as it goes to an otherwise unopened port, for**\n\n**instance, port 80 or 10080.**\n\n**Huh? Bob opened that connection, so he certainly does not ignore packets. Alice responds to a SYN packet, so she**\n\n**does not ignore either. The port observed by Mallory quite likely is *not* unopened.**\n\n**Instead, if I were Mallory, I would do the following: I see that Alice is a satellite subscriber and learn her IP address.**\n\n**Thus I can send TCP SYN to Port 80 on her IP address If she does not run a web server and is behind a firewall I**\n\n\n**[Reply](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72081/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/?replytocom=585306#respond)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**firewall) throws away the packets, so my own connection will be stable.**\n\n**I’d like to point out the lesson to be learned here: If you are on a broadcast network, send your RST packets. Otherwise,**\n\n**everyone is free to hide under your IP address.**\n\n**(Besides, if there are unassigned IP addresses, Mallory might just use one of those—if they are routed by the satellite**\n\n**network’s operator, although they are unassigned.)**\n\n**[Reply](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72081/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/?replytocom=587144#respond)**\n\n**Your email address will not be published.
