In](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/07/current-events-lures.html)\nthis post, we'll provide a technical breakdown of one of the latest Lokibot campaigns.\nTalos also has a new script to unpack the dropper's third stage.\n\nThe actors behind Lokibot usually have the ability to steal multiple types of credentials\nand other sensitive information. This new campaign utilizes a complex, multi-stage,\nmulti-layered dropper to execute Lokibot on the victim machine.\n\n**What's new?**\n\nThis sample is using the known technique of blurring images in documents to encourage users\nto enable macros. While quite simple this is fairly common and effective against users. This\nwrite up is intended to be a deep dive for reverse engineers into the latest tricks Lokibot is\nusing to infect user machines.\n\n**How did it work?**\n\nThe attack starts with a malicious XLS attachment, sent in a phishing email, containing an\nobfuscated macro that downloads a heavily packed second-stage downloader. The second stage\nfetches the encrypted third-stage, which includes three layered encrypted Lokibot. After a\nprivilege escalation, the third stage deploys Lokibot. The Image below shows the infection\nchain.\n\n\n-----\n\n**So what?**\n\nDefenders need to be constantly vigilant and monitor the behavior of systems within their\nnetwork. This blog provides a detailed overview of how complex the infection chain is for\nLokibot and which tricks the adversaries are using to bypass common security features and\ntools of modern operating systems.\n\n## First-stage analysis\n\nWhen the user opens the phishing email, it presents a Spanish social engineering message\n(\"Payment: Find scheduled payment dates attached\"). The figure below shows a screenshot of\none of the emails we looked at.\n\nThe Excel sheet uses another common social engineering technique by showing a blurred-out\nimage of a table with the text \"Changing the size of this document, please wait,\" in Spanish. If\nthe victim clicks the \"Enable Content\" button, thinking it will make the image visible, a\nmalicious macro is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe macro is mainly obfuscated by using long hexadecimal variable names. The screenshot\nbelow shows a portion of the `Workbook_Open` function of this macro.\n\nThe deobfuscated macro is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt decrypts the URL for the second-stage from hardcoded bytes, saves it to the \"Templates\"\nfolder, and executes it. The traffic generated from the macro is shown below.\n\n## Second-stage analysis\n\nThe second-stage executable is packed with a Delphi-based packer.\n\n### Packer analysis\n\nThe packer contains a timer `xvv` timer under `Form_main`, which unpacks the payload. The\ntimer and its handler code are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe unpacking function performs the following steps:\n\n1. Loads the image resource with name `T__6541957882` into memory.\n2. Finds the anchor `WWEX` and copies data following to the new buffer.\n3. Adds `0xEE` to the bytes to decode the DLL.\n4. Reflectively loads decoded DLL into memory and executes it.\n\nThe figure below shows the resource image that contains the encoded executable.\n\nThe following image shows the location of the embedded executable following anchor\n`WWEX`.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following code shows the code and decoded DLL.\n\n### Unpacked DLL analysis\n\nThe unpacked DLL is also written in Delphi. It fetches the third payload from the hardcoded\nURL.\n\nThe DLL sets a timer, as shown below, which will execute the downloader function periodically.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe `Download3rdStage` will first decode `https://discord.com` and try to connect to it. Then,\nit performs a time-based anti-debug check, as shown in the code below. If any of these checks\nfail, the DLL will not download the third stage.\n\nOnce the checks have passed, DLL will decrypt the hardcoded third-stage URL, as shown in the\ncode below, and send the HTTP request.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn response to the request, the server sends a ~618KB long hex string, as shown below.\n\nThe DLL decodes the hex string using the following steps:\n\n1. Reverse the hex string.\n2. Convert hexadecimal digits to bytes (unhexlify).\n3. XOR decode with hardcoded key \"ZKkz8PH0\".\n\n[We have written a small Python script to decrypt the third stage. The same decryption method](https://gist.github.com/irshadqemu/68a4db9b3f8f4f205e17f6050ffbb652#file-unpack_3rdstage_lokibot-py)\nwas also used to decrypt the hardcoded command and control (C2).The resulting file is also a\nDLL, which the second stage reflectively loads.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Third-stage analysis\n\nThe third stage is also written in Delphi. At the start, it loads a sizable binary resource named\n`DVCLAL` into memory. It then generates the key `7x21zoom8675309` from hard coded\nbytes. The key is then used to decrypt the resource data using a custom encryption algorithm.\nThe malware then recovers the configuration structure from decrypted resource data. The\nstructure fields are delimited by string `*()%@5YT!@#G__T@#$%^&*()__#@$#57$#!@`.\n\nThe decryption algorithm is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hex dump below shows a structure field highlighted separated by delimiters.\n\nThe configuration structure layout is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nInjecting malicious DLL to Notepad.exe\n\nThen, the malware will check if `InjectDLLToNotepadFlag` is set and `reverse_str(FileName)\n+ \".url\"` (mheX.url) file doesn't exist in C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\`. If yes, it will\ninject malicious DLL into Notepad.exe using the following steps:\n\n1. Launch a Notepad.exe in the suspended state (dwCreationFlag =\n\nCREATE_SUSPENDED).\n2. Get the imported DLL name from the malicious DLL's import table (the first one is\n\n\"kernel32.dll\") and write to the suspended process.\n3. Write the following 12-byte structure containing addresses of kernel32: LoadLibrary,\n\nkernel32.sleep, and DLL string.\n\n4. Write a 210-bytes shellcode to Notepad.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Execute this shellcode in Notepad.exe using CreateRemoteThread and pass the pointer\n\nto the 12-byte structure shown above. This shellcode loads the DLL (\"kernel32.dll\") and\nthen goes into an infinite sleep loop.\n6. Write DLL (\"kernel32.dll\") string again to notepad.exe.\n\n7. Write the 20-byte structure to Notepad.exe containing pointers to important APIs and\n\ntwo strings: imported DLL name and imported API name.\n\n8.\n\nWrite 144 bytes of shellcode to Notepad.exe.\n\n9. Execute this shellcode in Notepad.exe using `CreateRemoteThread` and pass the pointer\n\nto the 20-byte structure from step 7 as param. This shellcode will resolve the import\npointed by the last variable of the structure in step 7, and then exits using\n`RtlExistUserThread`.\n10. Repeat Steps 2 - 9 for all of the imported DLLs and imported functions in the malicious\n\nDLL's import table.\n11. Write malicious DLL to Notepad.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n12. Write an eight-byte structure to Notepad.exe containing Malicious DLL base address and\n\nentry point.\n\n13. Write 122 bytes of shellcode to notepad.exe.\n\n14. Execute the shellcode in Notepad.exe using `CreateRemoteThread` by passing the\n\npointer to structure from step 12 as param. The shellcode calls the entry-point point of\nthe malicious DLL.\n\n**Injected DLL analysis (UAC bypass using two techniques)**\n\nIt checks if `C:\\Windows\\Finex` exists. If not, it will drop the following file at path\n`C:\\Users\\Public\\cde.bat`:\n\nThen, it drops C:\\Users\\Public\\x.bat containing the following content.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, it drops C:\\Users\\Public\\x.vbs.\n\nThen it drops, C:\\Users\\Public\\Natso.bat.\n\n[Then, it executes `Natso.bat`, which is a \"fileless\" UAC bypass found by James Forshaw. More](https://twitter.com/tiraniddo)\ndetails here.\n\nIf C:\\Windows\\Finex still doesn't exist (which means the UAC bypass failed), it will update the\nNasto.bat and execute it using the code shown below.\n\n[This is another UAC bypass technique based on fodhelper.exe. More details here. On our test](https://gist.github.com/netbiosX/a114f8822eb20b115e33db55deee6692)\nmachine, the last bypass was successful, and `C:\\Windows\\Finex` was successfully created.\nAfter that, the DLL deletes the dropped file and exits.\n\n### Decrypting and executing Lokibot\n\nAfter attempting to bypass the UAC, the third-stage DLL will check if `AutoRunKeyFlag` is set.\nFor this DLL, it is not set. It will then jump to code that decrypts the Lokibot executable using\ndecryption keys from the configuration structure. The first two layers are decrypted using\n`DecryptionKeyA` and `DecryptionKeyB`, and reverses all the data. After that, the final layer\nis decrypted using the same decryption method used to decrypt resource data at the start of the\nthird stage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DLL contains multiple ways to execute a PE file. The execution method is decided based on\nthe values of ExecutionFlag A, B, C. Their values will lead to the following code for the current\nconfiguration, which will decrypt the shellcode from the configuration using DecryptionKeyB,\npass it three parameters: pointer to decrypted Lokibot .exe, a pointer to an array of string and a\npointer to current command line.\n\nThe shellcode will create a suspended process using the third parameter as a command line\n[command and injects Lokibot into it using process hollowing.](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/analyzing-malware-hollow-processes/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat actors are getting more sophisticated when it comes to hiding their final payload. This\ndropper uses three stages and three layers of encryption to hide its final payload. The dropper\nalso injects code into a suspended process to bypass UAC and uses process hollowing to execute\nits final payload. The majority of malware is getting more and more sophisticated. They are\nconstantly improving their social engineering techniques to trick the user into opening\nmalicious attachments and running malicious code. The malware code and its infection\ntechniques is also improving constantly like we have described in this blog. The adversaries\ncombine clever techniques to make detection harder. More than ever it is important to have a\nmulti layered security architecture in place to detect these kinds of attacks. It isn't unlikely that\nthe adversaries will manage to bypass one or the other security measures, but it is much harder\nfor them to bypass all of them. These campaigns and the refinement of the TTPs being used will\nlikely continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this\nthreat are listed below.\n\n**[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)**\nideally suited to prevent the execution of the\nmalware detailed in this post.
