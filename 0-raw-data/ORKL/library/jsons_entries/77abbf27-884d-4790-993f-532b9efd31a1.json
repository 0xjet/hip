The operations have primarily\ntargeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with narratives critical of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe, occasionally leveraging\nother themes such as anti-U.S. and COVID-19-related narratives as part of this broader anti[NATO agenda. We have dubbed this campaign “Ghostwriter.”](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\n\nMany, though not all of the incidents we suspect to be part of the Ghostwriter campaign,\nappear to have leveraged website compromises or spoofed email accounts to disseminate\nfabricated content, including falsified news articles, quotes, correspondence and other\ndocuments designed to appear as coming from military officials and political figures in the\ntarget countries.\n\nThis falsified content has been referenced as source material in articles and op-eds authored\nby at least 14 inauthentic personas posing as locals, journalists and analysts within those\ncountries. These articles and op-eds, primarily written in English, have been consistently\npublished to a core set of third-party websites that appear to accept user-submitted content,\nmost notably OpEdNews.com, BalticWord.com, and the pro-Russian site TheDuran.com,\namong others, as well as to suspected Ghostwriter-affiliated blogs.\n\nSome of these incidents and personas have received public attention from researchers,\nforeign news outlets, or government entities in Lithuania and Poland, but have not been tied\nto a broader activity set. Others have received little attention and remain relatively obscure.\nMandiant Threat Intelligence has independently discovered several Ghostwriter personas\nand identified additional incidents involving some of those personas previously exposed.\n\n[We believe the assets and operations discussed in this report are for the first time being](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\ncollectively tied together and assessed to comprise part of a larger, concerted and ongoing\ninfluence campaign.\n\nRead [the report today to learn more.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\n\n\n-----",
