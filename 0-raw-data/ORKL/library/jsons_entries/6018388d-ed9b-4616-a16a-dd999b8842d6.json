Their targets have spanned all across the world, with a focus on government, defense organizations and various Eastern European governments.|\n|Tweet||\n|24||\n\n\n### 36\n\n\n**[There have been numerous reports on their activities, to the extent that a Wikipedia entry has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofacy_Group)**\n\n**even been created for them.**\n\n**From these reports, we know that the group uses an abundance of tools and tactics, ranging**\n\n**across zero-day exploits targeting common applications such as Java or Microsoft Office, heavy**\n\n**use of spear-phishing attacks, compromising legitimate websites to stage watering-hole attacks,**\n\n**and targeting over a variety of operating systems – Windows, OSX, Linux, even mobile iOS.**\n\n**The Linux malware Fysbis is a preferred tool of Sofacy, and though it is not particularly**\n\n**sophisticated, Linux security in general is still a maturing area, especially in regards to malware.**\n\n**In short, it is entirely plausible that this tool has contributed to the success of associated attacks**\n\n**by this group. This blog post focuses specifically on this Linux tool preferred by Sofacy and**\n\n**describes considerations and implications when it comes to Linux malware.**\n\n**Fysbis is a modular Linux trojan / backdoor that implements plug-in and controller modules as**\n\n**distinct classes. For reference, some vendors categorize this malware under the Sednit attacker**\n\n**group naming designation. This malware includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Executable**\n\n**and Linking Format (ELF) binaries. Additionally, Fysbis can install itself to a victim system with or**\n\n**without root privileges. This increases the options available to an adversary when it comes to**\n\n**selecting accounts for installation.**\n\n**Summary information for the three binaries we analyzed follows:**\n\n**MD5** **364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467**\n\n**SHA-256** **8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce19335**\n\n**5d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb**\n\n**ssdeep** **3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l0H786**\n\n**O26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n+1R43QcIL**\n\n**XdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi**\n\n**Size** **141.2 KB (144560 bytes)**\n\n**Type** **ELF 64-bit (stripped)**\n\n**Install as root** **/bin/rsyncd**\n\n**Root install desc** **synchronize and backup service**\n\n**Install as non-root** **~/.config/dbus-notifier/dbus-inotifier**\n\n\n**Get Updates**\n**Sign up to receive the latest news, cyber**\n**threat intelligence and research from Unit**\n**42.**\n\n**Business Email**\n\n**Submit**\n\n\n**LikeLike**\n\n\n**Non-root install**\n\n**desc**\n\n\n**Select a Category**\n\n**Select a Month**\n\n**[MORE →](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/archives/)**\n\n\n## 24\n\n\n**system service d-bus notifier**\n\n\n**C2** **azureon-line[.]com (TCP/80)**\n\n**Usage Timeframe** **Late 2014**\n\n**Table 1: Sample 1 – Late 2014 Sofacy 64-bit Fysbis**\n\n**MD5** **075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39**\n\n**SHA-256** **02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba43795f2**\n\n**480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592**\n\n**ssdeep** **3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf454U**\n\n**NqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrIW33HxIajF:**\n\n**9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN+rv eQLZPTrV3Z**\n\n**Size** **175.9 KB (180148 bytes)**\n\n**Type** **ELF 32-bit (stripped)**\n\n**Install as root** **/bin/ksysdefd**\n\n**Root install desc** **system kernel service defender**\n\n\n## Palo Alto Networks News of the Week – February 13\n\n**[posted by Anna Lough on February 13, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/anna-lough/)**\n\n## A Look Into Fysbis: Sofacy’s Linux Backdoor\n\n**[posted by Bryan Lee on February 12, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/bryan-lee/)**\n\n## The Cybersecurity Canon: Dragnet Nation\n\n**[posted by Palo Alto Networks on February 12, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/palo-alto-networks-staff/)**\n\n## Channel Scoop – February 12, 2016\n\n**[posted by Lang Tibbils on February 12, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/lang-tibbils/)**\n\n## The Cybersecurity Canon: Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar\n\n**[posted by Palo Alto Networks on February 11, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/palo-alto-networks-staff/)**\n\n**[MORE →](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/archives/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**C2** **198.105.125[.]74 (TCP/80)**\n\n**Usage Timeframe** **Early 2015**\n\n**Table 2: Sample 2 – Early 2015 Sofacy 32-bit Fysbis**\n\n**MD5** **e107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8**\n\n**SHA-256** **fd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d57ed**\n\n**9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61**\n\n**ssdeep** **6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6BCUd**\n\n**c4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+**\n\n**Size** **314.4 KB (321902 bytes)**\n\n**Type** **ELF 64-bit (not stripped)**\n\n**Install as root** **/bin/ksysdefd**\n\n**Root install desc** **system kernel service defender**\n\n**Install as non-root** **~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd**\n\n\n**Non-root install**\n\n**desc**\n\n\n**system kernel service defender**\n\n\n**C2** **mozilla-plugins[.]com (TCP/80)**\n\n**Usage Timeframe** **Late 2015**\n\n**Table 3: Sample 3 – Late 2015 Sofacy 64-bit Fysbis**\n\n**Overall, these binaries are assessed as low sophistication, but effective. They epitomize the**\n\n**grudging reality that Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors often don’t require advanced**\n\n**means to affect their objectives. Rather, these actors more often than not hold their advanced**\n\n**malware and zero day exploits in reserve and employ just enough resources to meet their goals.**\n\n**It is only fair that defenders use any shortcuts or tricks at their disposal to shorten the amount of**\n\n**time it takes to assess threats. In other words, defenders should always look for ways to work**\n\n**smarter before they have to work harder.**\n\n**Binary strings alone revealed a good amount about these files, increasing the efficacy of**\n\n**[activities such as static analysis categorization (e.g., Yara). One example of this is Fysbis](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/)**\n\n**installation and platform targeting information for the samples in Table 1 and Table 2.**\n\n**Figure 1: Sofacy Fysbis installation and platform targeting found in strings**\n\n**In this case, we can see the binary installation path and local reconnaissance to determine**\n\n**which flavor of Linux the malware is running. This is followed by a number of Linux shell**\n\n**command style commands related to the malware establishing persistence.**\n\n**Another example of easily obtained information from these samples is capability based.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Sofacy Fysbis capability related leakage through strings**\n\n**Figure 2 shows interactive status / feedback strings that can give a defender an initial profile of**\n\n**capabilities. In addition to contributing to static analysis detections, this can be useful as a**\n\n**starting point for further incident response prioritization and qualification of the threat.**\n\n**Interestingly, the most recent ELF 64-bit binary we analyzed (Table 3) was not stripped prior to**\n\n**delivery, which offered additional context in the form of symbolic information. Defenders more**\n\n**[familiar with Windows Portable Executable (PE) binaries can equate this with compilation of a](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms809762.aspx)**\n\n**Debug version versus a Release version. For comparison, if we were to inspect Fysbis**\n\n**“RemoteShell” associated strings in one of the stripped variants, we would only see the**\n\n**following:**\n\n**Figure 3: Sofacy Fysbis stripped binary string references to RemoteShell capability**\n\n**Compare this with what is available from the non-stripped variant:**\n\n**Figure 4: Sofacy Fysbis non-stripped binary strings referenes to RemoteShell capability**\n\n**Little static analysis gifts like these can help to speed defender enumeration of capabilities and –**\n\n**more importantly – further contribute to correlation and detection across related samples.**\n\n**Additionally, this latest sample demonstrated minor evolution of the threat, most notably in terms**\n\n**of obfuscation. Specifically, both samples in Table 1 and Table 2 leaked installation information**\n\n**in the clear within binary strings. This was not the case with the sample in Table 3. Taking a**\n\n**closer look at this non-stripped binary using a disassembler, the following corresponds to**\n\n**decoding malware installation information for a root-privilege account.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In this case, the symbolic information hints at the method used for decoding, with references to**\n\n**mask, path, name, and info byte arrays.**\n\n**Figure 6: Assembly view of Sample 3 root installation related byte arrays**\n\n**As it turns out, the referenced byte mask is applied to the other byte arrays using a rolling**\n\n**double-XOR algorithm to construct malware installation paths, filenames, and descriptions for a**\n\n**Linux root account. Corresponding INSTALLUSER byte arrays exist, which facilitate the non-**\n\n**root installation for the trojan. The same masking method is also used by the binary to decode**\n\n**malware configuration C2 information, further showcasing how a little symbolic information can**\n\n**go a long way towards completeness and higher confidence in assessment of a malware**\n\n**sample.**\n\n**If you would like to learn more about how Fysbis works, the samples analyzed remain fairly**\n\n**[consistent with the sample analysis found here.](http://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=4276269)**\n\n**As Unit 42 has discussed in depth in other blog articles, we have observed that adversaries in**\n\n**general are seemingly hesitant in changing their infrastructure. This may be due to not wanting**\n\n**to commit additional resources, or simply a matter of retaining familiarity for the sake of**\n\n**timeliness. In either case, we see the same type of behavior here with the Fysbis samples in**\n\n**use by Sofacy.**\n\n**The oldest sample (Table 1), was found to beacon to the domain azureon-line[.]com, which had**\n\n**already been widely publicized as a known command and control domain for the Sofacy group.**\n\n**Using passive DNS, we can see that two of the original IPs this domain resolved to,**\n\n**193.169.244[.]190 and 111.90.148[.]148 also mapped to a number of other domains that had**\n\n**been in use by the Sofacy group during that time period.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Sample 1 C2 resolutions**\n\n**The first of the newer samples (Table 2), continues the trend and beacons to an IP also widely**\n\n**associated with the Sofacy group, 198.105.125[.]74. This IP has been mostly associated with**\n\n**[the tool specifically known as CHOPSTICK, which can be read about here.](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt28.pdf)**\n\n**Figure 8: Sample 2 C2 resolutions**\n\n**The newest sample (Table 3), introduces a previously unknown command and control beacon to**\n\n**mozilla-plugins[.]com. This activity aligns with the previously observed Sofacy group tactic of**\n\n**integrating legitimate company references into their infrastructure naming convention. Neither**\n\n**this new domain nor the IP it resolves to have been observed in the past, indicating that the**\n\n**sample in Table 3 may be associated with a newer campaign. Comparing this sample’s binary**\n\n**with the other two however, shows there are significant similarities on the code level as well as**\n\n**in terms of shared behavior.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Linux is used across business and home environments and appears in a variety of form factors.**\n\n**It is a preferred platform within data centers and the cloud for businesses, as well as an ongoing**\n\n**favorite when it comes to a majority of Internet-facing web and application servers. Linux is also**\n\n**at the foundation of Android devices and a number of other embedded systems. The value**\n\n**proposition of Linux – especially when it comes to its use in the enterprise – can be broken out**\n\n**into three perceived benefits: lower total cost of ownership (TCO), security, and feature set.**\n\n**While numbers and comparison alone can contribute to measurement of TCO and feature set,**\n\n**security requires further qualification. Expertise in the Linux platform is highly sought after**\n\n**across all industries for multiple disciplines, from system administration to big data analytics to**\n\n**incident response.**\n\n**The majority of businesses still maintain Windows-heavy user environments where certain core**\n\n**infrastructure components also operate under Windows servers (e.g., Active Directory,**\n\n**SharePoint, etc.). This means, from a practical perspective, most of a business’s focus remains**\n\n**on supporting and protecting Windows assets. Linux remains a mystery to a number of**\n\n**enterprise IT specialists –most critically for network defenders. Identifying and qualifying**\n\n**potential incidents requires a familiarity with what constitutes normal operation in order to isolate**\n\n**anomalies. The same is true for any other asset in an environment, normal operation is entirely**\n\n**dependent on a given asset’s role / function in the enterprise.**\n\n**Lack of expertise and visibility into non-Windows platforms combine in some environments to**\n\n**present significant risks against an organization’s security posture. As a recent caution, the**\n\n**[Linux vulnerability described under CVE-2016-0728 further demonstrates the potential breadth](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3023870/security/linux-kernel-flaw-endangers-millions-of-pcs-servers-and-android-devices.html)**\n\n**of real-world risks to associated platforms. A natural extension of this exposure is increased**\n\n**targeting by both dedicated and opportunistic attackers across various malicious actor**\n\n**motivations. Despite the lingering belief (and false sense of security) that Linux inherently yields**\n\n**higher degrees of protection from malicious actors, Linux malware and vulnerabilities do exist**\n\n**and are in use by advanced adversaries.
