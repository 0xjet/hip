    "plain_text": "# Merlin for Red Teams\n\n**[lockboxx.blogspot.com/2018/02/merlin-for-red-teams.html](http://lockboxx.blogspot.com/2018/02/merlin-for-red-teams.html)**\n\nGo checkout [Merlin. It’s your classic HTTP beaconing, remote access trojan, but with a few](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin)\ntwists that we will cover in this post. If you’re new to the project and just want to get started\n[with the server and client, the first post is for you. Starting w/ Merlin is very easy, you can](https://medium.com/@Ne0nd0g/introducing-merlin-645da3c635a)\nbuild from source (which I highly suggest), or you can simply download and run one of the\n[release binaries. If your using one of the precompiled servers, the only setup you have to do](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/releases)\nis create a folder structure for the SSL certs. For starters the project is all built around\n[GoLang, which is my current programming obsession for a number of reasons (natively](http://lockboxx.blogspot.com/2017/11/golang-scripting-glse-and-gscript.html)\ncompiled binaries, writes like an interpreted language). This makes the project really fun to\ndevelop on and the project creator, [Ne0nd0g, has a small community already growing this](https://twitter.com/ne0nd0g)\n[project. I also really appreciate the vendoring, which allows one to track the revisions of all](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/blob/master/vendor/vendor.json)\nthe packages, and use static versions of those packages. Versioning is something that is\npretty critical when your talking about agent integrity and RCE on clients. The following are\nsome of the things that I think really sets Merlin apart from other agents.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Merlin is how versatile the agents are, because they are\nbased on GoLang I like how Russel really highlights the cross-platform nature of GoLang by\n\n\n-----\n\n[showing all the various systems that Merlin can be cross-compiled for. This means we can](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/blob/dev/data/bin/README.MD)\nuse a single code base and put agents on most any machine we encounter, having them all\ncall back to whatever platform we decide to run the listening post (vs only being able to put\nagents on Windows, or only being able to run listening posts on Linux). This cross-platform\n[nature can also be seen in this default make file, which has an easy mode \"make all\" to build](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/blob/master/Makefile)\nan agent and server for the three major platforms (OSX, Windows, Linux). The wiki is great\nfor [build information. There is also tons of information on the wiki for running a server (aka](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/wiki/Building)\n[operating the agents). Merlin also includes some advanced logging, which is really useful for](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/wiki/Logging)\ncapturing details after an operation has concluded.\n\nI like that the transport protocol is HTTP/2 and modern TLS, I think this gives Merlin both a\nlot of flexibility and security. The HTTP/S protocol is one of the most readily available\noutbound ports (tcp/443), as most people need to reach web sites during the day (the port\nthat the protocol uses is configurable as well). The TLS gives us end to end encryption, and\nthe PFS ciphers make it even harder for network security monitors in the middle to decrypt\nour traffic. Further, the HTTP/2 that is negotiated after the TLS handshake adds an extra\nlayer of obfuscation to the C2 coms, making the traffic a non-human readable protocol. I\n[learned all about HTTP/2 here, as this project was my first introduction to the protocol.](https://daniel.haxx.se/http2/)\n[Russel also wrote a SANS whitepaper on the HTTP/2 protocol that covers inspecting the](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/protocols/practical-approach-detecting-preventing-web-application-attacks-http-2-36877)\nprotocol in use and detecting its use on the network.\n\n[The JavaScript agent is an awesome twist, as it lets the attacker control unforeseen](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/tree/dev/data/html/scripts)\nplatforms or browsers from the same common listening post or server. One primary end goal\nof a cross platform implant is a unified management server. A JavaScript agent extends this\nto any platform that can run JavaScript, albeit more limited than a native implant. Another\nbonus with the JavaScript agent is you can do things like perform CSRF attacks on other\npages that the user may be logged into. You can read more about the JavaScript agents\nhere, and keep in mind these are currently only in the dev branch.\n\nCurrently the master branch is a little light in terms of features but the dev branch is already\nteeming with new features. The project is really well laid out so it’s pretty easy to add new\n[features and if you want to see the things we are adding checkout the dev branch. There are](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/tree/dev)\nstill a bunch of basic features we need to add so feel free to dig into the code and add\nsomething! Ne0nd0g is putting extensive planning and foresight into the structure of this\n[project. This will soon surface in the shape of modules, which I'm super excited about! I think](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/tree/master/pkg/modules)\nthis will really open Merlin up to more specialized OS-specific development and cool post\nexploitation modules. I also enjoy working w/ Russel, he's energetic, appreciates the other\ndevelopers, and he adheres to some great programming standards. If your looking to learn\nGoLang, work on a great project, or even learn from some awesome developers, I highly\nencourage you to mess with the Merlin source. Ultimately, should you decide add to the\nproject, [def read the developers guide, as it has many of those great programming standards](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/blob/dev/docs/CONTRIBUTING.MD)\nlisted in there.\n\n\n-----",
