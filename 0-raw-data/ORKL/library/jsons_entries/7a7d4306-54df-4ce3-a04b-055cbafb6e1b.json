But over the last few years, we’ve observed hackers using\nmalware to steal smaller amounts of cryptocurrency from individual users.\n\nUsing malware to steal or extort cryptocurrency is nothing new. In fact, nearly all ransomware\nstrains are initially delivered to victims’ devices through malware, and many large-scale\nexchange hacks also involve malware. But these attacks take careful planning and skill to\npull off, as they’re typically targeted against deep-pocketed, professional organizations and,\nif successful, require hackers to launder large sums of cryptocurrency. With other types of\nmalware, less sophisticated hackers can take a cheaper “spray-and-pray” approach,\nspamming millions of potential victims and stealing smaller amounts from each individual\ntricked into downloading the malware. Many of these malware strains are available for\npurchase on the darknet, making it even easier for less sophisticated hackers to deploy them\nagainst victims.\n\nWe’re equipping our partners in law enforcement, compliance, and cybersecurity to combat\nthis problem by adding a new tag for malware operator addresses in all Chainalysis\nproducts. Below, we’ll examine trends in hackers’ usage of cryptocurrency-focused malware\nover the last decade and share two case studies to help you understand this underdiscussed area of crypto crime.\n\n## Malware and cryptocurrency summarized\n\nMalware refers to malicious software that carries out harmful activity on a victim’s device,\nusually without their knowledge. Malware-powered crime can be as simple as stealing\ninformation or money from victims, but can also be much more complex and grand in scale.\nFor instance, malware operators who have infected enough devices can use those devices\nas a botnet, having them work in concert to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDOS)\nattacks, commit ad fraud, or send spam emails to spread the malware further.\n\nThe malware families we discuss here are all used to steal cryptocurrency from victims,\nthough some of them are used for other activities as well. The grid below breaks down the\nmost common types of cryptocurrency-focused malware families.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Type** **Description** **Example**\n\n\n**Info stealers** Collect saved credentials, files, autocomplete history, and\ncryptocurrency wallets from compromised computers.\n\n**Clippers** Can insert new text into the victim’s clipboard, replacing text\nthe user has copied. Hackers can use clippers to replace\ncryptocurrency addresses copied into the clipboard with their\nown, allowing them to reroute planned transactions to their\nown wallets.\n\n**Cryptojackers** Makes unauthorized use of victim device’s computing power\nto mine cryptocurrency.\n\n**Trojans** Virus that looks like a legitimate program but infiltrates\nvictim’s computer to disrupt operations, steal, or cause other\ntypes of harm.\n\n\nRedline\n\nHackBoss\n\nGlupteba\n\nMekotio\nbanking\ntrojan\n\n\nMany of the malware families described above are available to purchase for relatively little\nmoney on cybercriminal forums. For instance, the screenshots below show an advertisement\nfor Redline, an info stealer malware, posted on a Russian cybercrime forum.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe seller offers cybercriminals one month of Redline access for $150 and lifetime access for\n$800. Buyers also get access to Spectrum Crypt Service, a Telegram-based tool that allows\ncybercriminals to encrypt Redline so that it’s more difficult for victims’ antivirus software to\ndetect it once it’s been downloaded. The proliferation of cheap access to malware families\nlike Redline means that even relatively low-skilled cybercriminals can use them to steal\ncryptocurrency. Law enforcement and compliance teams must keep this in mind, and\nunderstand that the malware attacks they investigate aren’t necessarily carried out by the\nadministrators of the malware family itself, but instead are often carried out by smaller\ngroups renting access to the malware family, similar to [ransomware affiliates.](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ransomware-ecosystem-crypto-crime-2021/)\n\nThe graph below shows the number of victim transfers to cryptocurrency addresses\nassociated with a sample of malware families in the info stealer and clipper categories\ninvestigated by Chainalysis.\n\n_Note: This graph does not reflect activity by cryptojackers or ransomware._\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall, the malware families in this sample have received 5,574 transfers from victims in\n2021, up from 5,447 in 2020.\n\nWhich malware families were most active?\n\n_Note: This graph does not reflect activity by cryptojackers or ransomware._\n\nCryptbot, an infostealer that takes victims’ cryptocurrency wallet and account credentials,\nwas the most prolific malware family in the group, raking in almost half a million dollars in\npilfered Bitcoin. Another prolific family is QuilClipper, a clipboard stealer or “clipper,” ranked\neighth on the graph above. Clippers can be used to insert new text into the “clipboard” that\nholds text a user has copied, usually with the intent to paste elsewhere. Clippers typically\nuse this functionality to detect when a user has copied a cryptocurrency address to which\nthey intend to send funds — the clipper malware effectively hijacks the transaction by then\nsubstituting an address controlled by the hacker for the one copied by the user, thereby\ntricking the user into sending cryptocurrency to the hacker.\n\nHowever, none of those numbers reflect totals from what we believe to be the most prolific\ntype of cryptocurrency-focused malware: Cryptojackers\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cryptojacker activity is murky but substantial\n\nCryptojackers obtain funds for malware operators by utilizing the victim’s computing power to\nmine cryptocurrency — usually Monero, but we’ve seen Zcash and Ethereum mined as well.\nSince funds are moving directly from the mempool to mining addresses unknown to us,\nrather than from the victim’s wallet to a new wallet, it’s more difficult to passively collect data\non cryptojacking activity the way we can other forms of cryptocurrency-based crime.\n[However, we know it’s a big problem. In 2020, Cisco’s cloud security division reported that](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_ae/about/press/2021/220321.html)\ncryptojacking malware affected 69% of its clients, which would translate to an incredible\namount of stolen computer power, and therefore a significant amount of illicitly-mined\ncryptocurrency. A 2018 [report from Palo Alto Networks estimated that 5% of all Monero in](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-rise-cryptocurrency-miners/)\ncirculation was mined by cryptojackers, which would represent over $100 million in revenue,\nmaking cryptojackers the most prolific form of cryptocurrency-focused malware.\n\nThese numbers are likely only scratching the surface for cryptojacking. As we identify more\nmalware families involved in this activity, we expect to learn that total revenue for the\ncategory is even bigger than it currently appears.\n\n### Malware and money laundering\n\nThe vast majority of malware operators receive initial victim payments at private wallet\naddresses, though a few use addresses hosted by larger services. Of that smaller group, the\nmajority use addresses hosted by exchanges — mostly high-risk exchanges that have low or\n\n\n-----\n\nno KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements.\n\nAfter receiving cryptocurrency from victims, malware operators then send the majority of\nfunds on to addresses at centralized exchanges.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, that majority is slim and getting slimmer. Exchanges only received 54% of funds\nsent from malware addresses in 2021, down from 75% in 2020. DeFi protocols make up\nmuch of the difference at 20% in 2021, after having received a negligible share of malware\nfunds in 2020. Illicit services seemingly unrelated to malware — mostly darknet markets —\nare also a significant money laundering avenue for malware operators, having received\nroughly 15% of all funds sent from malware addresses in 2021.\n\nMalware-based cryptocurrency theft is difficult to investigate in part due to the large number\nof less sophisticated cybercriminals who can rent access to these malware families. But\nstudying how cybercriminals launder stolen cryptocurrency may be investigators’ best bet for\nfinding those involved. Using blockchain analysis, investigators can follow the funds, find the\ndeposit addresses cybercriminals use to cash out, and subpoena the services hosting those\naddresses to identify the attackers.\n\n## Investigating the HackBoss clipper\n\nAccording to Chainalysis data, the HackBoss clipper stole over $80,000 worth of\ncryptocurrency throughout 2021. Since 2012, HackBoss has been the most prolific clipper\nmalware overall, having taken over $560,000 from victims in assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum,\nRipple, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, HackBoss is targeted at fellow hackers rather than what we think of as ordinary\n[victims. According to reporting from Avast.io’s Decoded, HackBoss is distributed through a](https://decoded.avast.io/romanalinkeova/hackboss-a-cryptocurrency-stealing-malware-distributed-through-telegram/)\nTelegram channel that purports to provide hacking tools such as social media site crackers.\nHowever, instead of those tools, the channel’s users are actually downloading the HackBoss\nclipper, which steals cryptocurrency from them by inserting its own addresses into the\nclipboard when victims attempt to copy and paste another address to carry out a\ncryptocurrency transaction.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [Chainalysis Reactor graph above shows HackBoss receiving cryptocurrency from](https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/)\nvictims on the left. From there, the malware operators move funds to deposit addresses\nhosted by high-risk exchanges.\n\nWhile HackBoss is uniquely targeted at hackers attempting to download tools to carry out\ntheir own cybercrimes, most other clippers are targeted at ordinary cryptocurrency users. It’s\nextremely difficult to know if one has fallen victim to a clipper until a transaction has been\nhijacked given how long and complex cryptocurrency addresses are — most people don’t\nread through the recipient’s entire address between pasting it into their wallet and sending a\ntransaction. However, that may be necessary for users trying to be as careful as possible. At\nthe very least, cryptocurrency users need to be vigilant about what links they click and\nprograms they download, as there are several active malware strains — not just clippers, but\nothers too — attempting to steal their funds.\n\n## Case study: Glupteba botnet hijacks computers to mine Monero and harnesses the Bitcoin blockchain to evade shutdown\n\nA complaint filed by Google in late 2021 named multiple Russian nationals and entities\nalleged to be responsible for operating the Glupteba botnet, which has compromised over 1\nmillion machines. Glupteba’s operators have used these machines for several criminal\nschemes, including utilizing their computing power to mine cryptocurrency — specifically, in\nthis case, Monero — in a practice known as cryptojacking.\n\nPerhaps most notable is Glupteba’s use of the Bitcoin blockchain to withstand attempts to\ntake it offline, encoding updated command-and-control servers (C2) into the Op_Returns of\nBitcoin transactions. Google used Chainalysis software and Chainalysis Investigative\n\n\n-----\n\nServices to analyze the Bitcoin addresses and transactions responsible for sending updated\nC2 instructions. Below, we’ll break down how the Glupteba botnet uses the Bitcoin\nblockchain to defend itself and what it means for cybersecurity and law enforcement.\n\n### A primer on the Glupteba botnet\n\nThe cybercriminals behind the Glupteba botnet have used it to carry out a variety of criminal\nschemes. In addition to cryptojacking, the botnet has been used to acquire and sell Google\naccount information stolen from infected machines, commit digital advertising fraud, and sell\nstolen credit card data.\n\nGoogle was able to identify the individuals named in the complaint by obtaining and\nexamining an IP address used by one of Glupteba’s C2 servers. All individuals were also\nlisted as owners or administrators of shell companies connected to Glupteba-related crimes,\nsuch as one used to sell fraudulent digital advertising impressions supplied by the botnet.\nGoogle was able to successfully take down the current C2 server, however as Glupteba has\nproven to be infallible against these actions through it’s blockchain failsafe, we will soon see\na new C2 assigned.\n\n### How Glupteba weaponizes the blockchain\n\nIn order to direct botnets, cybercriminals rely on command-and-control (C2) servers, which\nallow them to send commands to machines infected with malware. Botnets look for domain\naddresses controlled by their C2 servers in order to receive instructions, with directions on\nwhere to look for those domain addresses hard coded into the malware itself.\n\nIn order to combat botnets, law enforcement and cybersecurity professionals try to take\nthose domains offline so that the botnets can no longer receive instructions from the C2\nserver. In response, botnet operators typically set up a number of backup domains in case\nthe active domain is taken down. Most malware algorithmically generates new domain\naddresses for botnets to scan until they find one of those backups, allowing them to receive\nnew instructions from the C2 server.\n\nHowever, Glupteba does something new. When its C2 server is disrupted, Glupteba is\nprogrammed to search the Bitcoin blockchain for transactions carried out by three addresses\ncontrolled by its operators. Those addresses carry out transactions of little or no monetary\nvalue, with encrypted data written into the transaction’s Op_Return field, which is used to\nmark transactions as invalid. Glupteba malware can then decode the data entered into the\nOp_Return field to obtain the domain address of a new C2 server.\n\nIn other words, whenever one of Glupteba’s C2 servers is shut down, it can simply scan the\nblockchain to find the new C2 server domain address, hidden amongst hundreds of\nthousands of daily transactions. This tactic makes the Glupteba botnet extremely difficult to\n\n\n-----\n\ndisrupt through conventional cybersecurity techniques focused on disabling C2 server\ndomains. This is the first known case of a botnet using this approach.\n\nHere’s what we know about the three Bitcoin addresses we’ve identified as being used by\nGlupteba’s operators to keep the botnet online:\n\n\n**Address** **Dates**\n**active**\n\n15y7dskU5TqNHXRtu5wzBpXdY5mT4RZNC6 6/17/2019 –\n5/13/2020\n\n1CgPCp3E9399ZFodMnTSSvaf5TpGiym2N1 4/8/2020 –\n10/19/2021\n\n1CUhaTe3AiP9Tdr4B6wedoe9vNsymLiD97 10/13/21 –\npresent\n\n\n**Number of**\n**transfers**\n\n\n**Number of**\n**Op_Returns**\n\n\n32 8\n\n16 6\n\n18 6\n\n\nCombined, the three addresses have only transacted a few hundred dollars’ worth of Bitcoin,\nbut the messages encoded into the Op_Returns on some of those transactions have helped\nthe Glupteba botnet remain operational. Let’s look more closely at address 157d… in\n[Chainalysis Reactor as an example.](https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe see that the Glupteba address received its initial funding from a mixing service, before\ninitiating the invalid transactions with Op_Returns we see at the top of the graph. The funds\nassociated with those invalid transactions then travel to the refund wallets on the right, and\neventually back to the original Glupteba address. The other two addresses show similar\ntransaction patterns. Google identified the three Glupteba addresses and brought them to\n\n\n-----\n\nChainalysis, at which point our investigators were able to decode the data contained in the\nOp_Returns’ message fields, allowing them to discover the new C2 server domain\naddresses being sent to the botnet.\n\nLike address 15y7d…, address 1CgPC… was initially funded through outputs from mixing\ntransactions. However, the third address, 1Cuha…, received initial funding from another\nprivate wallet address: bc1qhjuvzwcv0pp68kn2sqvx3d2k3pqfllv3c4vywd.\n\nInterestingly, other transactions sent by bc1qh… have been associated with Federation\n[Tower, a luxury office building in Moscow that also housed Suex, a now-sanctioned](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ofac-sanction-suex-september-2021)\ncryptocurrency OTC broker involved in money laundering for several forms of cybercrime,\n[including ransomware. Reporting from Bloomberg and](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/bitcoin-money-laundering-happening-in-moscow-s-vostok-tower-experts-say) _[The New York Times discusses other](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/06/world/europe/ransomware-russia-bitcoin.html)_\ncryptocurrency businesses headquartered in Federation Tower, including EggChange, an\nexchange that’s also been linked to cybercrime and whose founder, Denis Dubnikov, was\narrested by U.S. authorities in November 2021. These links raise more questions about the\ninterconnectedness of illicit, Russia-based cryptocurrency businesses associated with\nmalware and ransomware attacks.\n\n### Glupteba shows why all cybersecurity teams need to understand cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nGlupteba s blockchain-based method of avoiding the shutdown of its botnet represents a\nnever-before-seen threat vector for cryptocurrencies. In the private sector, cryptocurrency\nbusinesses and financial institutions have thus far typically been the ones tackling cases\ninvolved in blockchain analysis, usually from an AML/CFT compliance perspective. But this\ncase shows that cybersecurity teams at virtually any company that could be a target for\ncybercriminals — especially those possessing large amounts of sensitive customer data —\nmust be well-versed in cryptocurrency and blockchain analysis in order to stay ahead of\ncybercriminals. At Chainalysis, we’re eager to work with those teams to help them\nunderstand how our tools can assist them in diagnosing and fighting these threats, so that\ncryptocurrencies can’t be weaponized against them or their users.\n\n## The convergence of malware and cryptocurrency: Same cybercriminals, new methods\n\nThe cybersecurity industry has been dealing with malware for years, but the usage of these\nmalicious programs to steal cryptocurrency means cybersecurity teams need new tools in\ntheir toolbox. Chainalysis gives cybersecurity teams new avenues of investigation for\nmalware, allowing them to take advantage of blockchains’ transparency and track the\nmovement of funds that have been stolen until they reach an address whose owner can be\nidentified. Likewise, cryptocurrency compliance teams already well-versed in blockchain\nanalysis must educate themselves on malware in order to ensure these threat actors aren’t\ntaking advantage of their platforms to launder stolen cryptocurrency.\n\n**_This blog is a preview of our 2022 Crypto Crime Report._** **_[Sign up here to download](https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html)_**\n**_your copy now!_**\n\n_This material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax,_\n_financial, or investment advice.
