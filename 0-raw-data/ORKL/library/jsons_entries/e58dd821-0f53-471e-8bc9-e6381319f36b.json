The campaign is primarily targeting](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-black-basta-ransomware)\nU.S.-based companies.\n\nBlack Basta is a ransomware group that emerged in April 2022 and specifically targets organizations in the United\nStates, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The group is known for using double-extortion\ntactics: they steal sensitive files and information from victims and later use it to extort victims by threatening to\npublish the data unless the victim pays the ransom.\n\nIn this latest campaign, the Black Basta ransomware gang is using QakBot malware to create an initial point of\nentry and move laterally within an organization’s network. QakBot, also known as QBot or Pinkslipbot, is a banking\ntrojan primarily used to steal victims’ financial data, including browser information, keystrokes, and credentials.\nOnce QakBot has successfully infected an environment, the malware installs a backdoor allowing the threat actor\nto drop additional malware—namely, ransomware.\n\nIn this threat alert, the Cybereason team describes one attack scenario that started from a QBot infection, resulting\n[in multiple key machines loading Cobalt Strike, which finally led to the global deployment of Black Basta](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-all-paths-lead-to-cobalt-strike-icedid-emotet-and-qbot)\nransomware. To make the recovery more difficult, the threat actor also locked the victim out of the network by\ndisabling DNS services. We observed this tactic used on more than one victim.\n\nThe creation of this threat alert was motivated by the large number of organizations whose IT infrastructures were\nimpacted by this recent Qakbot campaign and by the aggressiveness of the threat actor behind it, often leading to\nransomware (Black Basta in our case, but it could lead to other ransomware strains).\n\n## KEY OBSERVATIONS\n\n**Threat actor moves extremely fast: In the different cases of compromise we identified, the threat actor**\nobtained domain administrator privileges in less than two hours and moved to ransomware deployment in\nless than 12 hours.\n\n**High Severity: The Cybereason GSOC assesses the threat level as HIGH given the potentially widespread**\ncampaign being run by Black Basta.\n\n**Widespread QBot campaign targeting U.S.-based companies: Threat actors leveraging the QBot loader**\ncasted a large net targeting mainly on U.S.-based companies and acted quickly on any spear phishing victims\nthey compromised. In the last two weeks, we observed more than 10 different customers affected by this\nrecent campaign.\n**Network lockout: Among the many Qakbot infections we identified, two allowed the threat actor to deploy**\nransomware and then lock the victim out of its network by disabling the victim’s DNS service, making the\nrecovery even more complex.\n**Black Basta deployment: One particularly fast compromise we observed led to the deployment of Black**\nBasta ransomware. This allowed us to tie a link between threat actors leveraging Qakbot and Black Basta\noperators.\n\nGiven all of these observations, we recommend that security and detection teams keep an eye out for this\ncampaign, since it can quickly lead to severe IT infrastructure damage.\n\n## ANALYSIS\n\nThe Cybereason Managed Services team observed multiple infections of Black Basta using QakBot beginning on\nNovember 14, 2022. These QakBot infections began with a spam/phishing email containing malicious URL links.\nQakbot was the primary method Black Basta used to maintain a presence on victims’ networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat said, we also observed the threat actor using Cobalt Strike during the compromise to gain remote access to\nthe domain controller. Finally, ransomware was deployed and the attacker then disabled security mechanisms,\nsuch as EDR and antivirus programs.\n\nThis Threat Alert is broken down into three main parts:\n\n**Infection Vector, related to QBot deployment and post-exploitation on the patient zero machine**\n**Lateral Movement, related to the key machines the threat actor leveraged to complete the domain**\ncompromise\n**Global Ransomware Deployment, related to the large-scale deployment of the Black Basta ransomware,**\nalong with attempts to deactivate security mechanisms\n\nThis attack diagram summarizes the actions carried out by Black Basta affiliates:\n\n_Attack Scenario Diagram_\n\n### Infection Vector\n\n**QBot Deployment**\n\nRecently, security researchers have observed aggressive QBot campaigns, and the Cybereason team was able to\nmap the identified activity to public CTI posts:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: Twitter_\n\n_[(https://twitter.com/Max_Mal_/status/1592577982912425984)](https://twitter.com/Max_Mal_/status/1592577982912425984)_\n\nUsing this source to infer the original phishing vector, we concluded that the attacker uses an IMG file (Disk Image\nFile, similar to the ISO format) as the initial compromise vector. We also identified other QBot infection vectors\n[starting from ISO files, depending on the campaign. Prior to Microsoft patch regarding MOTW (Mark of the web),](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-windows-zero-day-bug-exploited-to-push-malware/)\nfiles inside of these types of image files (ISO/IMG) were not marked properly with Mark of The Web, a system to\nallow Windows to flag a file with metadata such as download URL, and warn users prior to opening the file. After\nthis patch fixed the bug, the threat actors have moved to a zero day for MOTW that allows a user to bypass the\nMicrosoft security flags with a malformed signature inside the malicious files.\n\nAdditionally, QBot recently changed the way it is loading its malicious payload from JavaScript to VBS.\n\nThe malicious VBS file is delivered via an image file mounted to the D: drive. The regsvr32.exe process then\nexecutes another randomly named file from the same mount, in a randomly named folder–in this case\n“\\inducted\\aficionado.tmp”. The subsequent regsvr32.exe child process contains the Qbot module most commonly\nseen in recent attacks: fwpolicyiomgr.dll.\n\nThis file is named after a legitimate Windows file normally located in “C:\\Windows\\System32\\FWPolicyIOMgr.dll”,\nbut crucially in the case of Qbot, it is loaded as floating code without an image file on disk.\n\n\n-----\n\n_QBot full infection process tree, as seen from the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\nIn the example above:\n\nThe processes included in the process tree from wscript.exe to wermgr.exe are related to QBot.\nThe processes included in the process tree from wermgr.exe to getmac.exe are related to Cobalt Strike.\n\nThis diagram explains the infection vector:\n\n\n-----\n\n_QBot Infection Process_\n\nSubsequently, the fwpolicyiomgr.dll module is injected into the iexplore.exe process which connects to a multitude\nof Qbot C2 servers, many of which see no significant data sent/transferred. There are also connections to many\nlegitimate websites such as yahoo.com, xfinity.com, irs.gov, and more. For a full list of Qbot C2 servers, refer to\n“Associated IPs” below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_List of domain/IP addresses that iexplore.exe communicates with, including legitimate and QBot C2s_\n\nThe iexplore.exe process executes Qbot discovery commands as follows:\n\nnet view\ncmd /c set\narp -a\nipconfig /all\nnslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.{Domain}\nnet share\nroute print\nnetstat -nao\nnet localgroup\nwhoami /all\n\nAdditionally, iexplore.exe spawns another instance of Qbot through regsvr32.exe, which in that case failed to\nload:\n\n_Regsvr32.exe trying to load a DLL_\n\nThis activity, Regsvr32.exe trying to load a DLL, is most likely related to QBot persistence mechanisms.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Wermgr.exe process then starts and loads the Qbot module fwpolicyiomgr.dll, along with two new floating\npayloads (plugin_payload54.dll and plugin_payload55.dll). It also connects to the C2 domain jesofidiwi[.]com.\n\n_Full process tree as seen from the Cybereason Platform after QBot loading_\n\nThe Jesofidiwi[.]com domain is the main domain used by the threat actor to persist on the network, and the\n[Cybereason team noticed that it is embedded in recent Bumblebee samples.](https://www.cybereason.com/press/cybereason-security-analysts-rate-the-bumblebee-malware-loader-as-a-critical-threat-to-organizations)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Extract from_\n_https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4a2e23d604d2d2774df43b5c539f9726c6033db55b483c49e4e84314265f6f6e/details_\n\nAccording to the VirusTotal information, this C2address relates to Cobalt Strike, which we will confirm in the next\npart of this report.\n\nThe Wermgr.exe process injects into the getmac.exe process, a Windows binary used for getting MAC addresses\nand network adapter information.\n\nGetmac.exe loads a number of open source C# frameworks for stealing browser credentials, Kerberos interaction,\npassword management, compression libraries along with .NET namespaces, and more.\n\nLoading the frameworks helps the threat actors remain fileless to accomplish their goal in-memory.\n\nThe full list of loaded modules includes:\n\n_sharpweb {FLOATING}_\n\n_sharpchromium {FLOATING}_\n\n_passvault {FLOATING}_\n\n_rubeus {FLOATING}_\n\n_processes {FLOATING}_\n\n_goc {FLOATING}_\n\n_dnsclient {FLOATING}_\n\n_commandline {FLOATING}_\n\n_newtonsoft.json {FLOATING}_\n\n_abc {FLOATING}_\n\n_system.threading.tasks.dataflow {FLOATING}_\n\n_icsharpcode.sharpziplib {FLOATING}_\n_system.buffers {FLOATING}_\n\n_Getmac.exe with network scanning suspicions_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cmd.exe process is executed with various reconnaissance and clean up commands based on what was\ndiscovered during the discovery phase, including users and machines that were later compromised:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C del *.txt\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C del OTllMzNkZjMtZTZhMi00NzhkLTgyZjAtZjlkOTZmYTU4ODY0.bin\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net accounts /domain\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net group \"Domain Admins\" /do\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net group \"domain controllers\" /domain\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net user {user} /domain\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C net user {user} /domain\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:{domain}\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C query user /server:{IP}\n\nPowerShell is used to query information against Active Directory Domain Services with the\nSystem.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher class. The results are then saved as ccccOUT.csv.\n\npowershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand $so = New-Object\nSystem.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher; $so.filter = \"(&(samAccountType=805306369))\"; $so.FindAll() |\nSelect -Property @{N='Name'; E={$_.properties.samaccountname}},@{N='OS'; E=\n{$_.properties.operatingsystem}},@{N='Descr'; E={$_.properties.description}},@{N='LastTime'; E={;\n\n[datetime]::FromFileTime($_.properties.lastlogontimestamp -as [string]).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd\nHH:mm')}},@{N='IP'; E={$_.properties.ipv4address}},@{N='ManagedBy'; E=\n{$_.properties.managedby}},@{N='primarygroup'; E={$_.properties.primarygroup}} | Export-csv ccccOUT.csv encoding utf8\n\n**credential Harvesting**\n\nThe below esentutl.exe command is used to get the victim’s internet history data by combining separate log,\ndatabase, and system files to form a cohesive history for later use. The file that will contain the history data is\nWebCacheV01.dat.\n\nesentutl.exe /r V01 /l\"C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" /s\"C:\\Users\\\n\n[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\" /d\"C:\\Users\\\n\n[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\"\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nThe attackers were able to compromise a domain admin account, which was possibly used to drop a Cobalt Strike\npayload to several servers, including a domain controller, in the customer environment.\n\nThis was done by placing the Cobalt Strike payload in the public folder and executing it with the rundll32.exe\nSetVolume commands through remote services deployed from the initial machine.\n\nC:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\rundll32.exe C:\\users\\public\\cob_54.dll,SetVolume\n\n\n-----\n\n_Rundll32.exe Malop with services.exe parent_\n\n_Getmac.exe sending StartService Remote Procedure Call to one of the compromised servers_\n\n_Outgoing connection to the compromised server over port 135 (RPC)._\n\n_The connection being received by the services.exe process on the compromised server_\n\nA quick analysis of the DLL files shows that the application masquerades as the Rainmeter program:\n\n_DLL File Property of cob_54.dll_\n\nIn another case, we identified what seems to be the x86 version of this DLL, named cob_56.dll.\n\nFinally, affected rundll32.exe processes actively communicated with their C2 server,\n\ntevokaxol[.]com and jesofidiwi[.]com:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Communication from the rundll32.exe process to their C2_\n\nThis process is used to deploy more floating code into the getmac.exe process, as seen on patient zero:\n\n_Rundll32.exe with the malicious Cobalt Strike modules, spawning getmac.exe as well as injecting code into the_\n_process_\n\n### Global Deployment of Black Basta\n\nThe final phase of the attack was to infect as many machines as possible, using the information and credentials\ngathered during the first two initial infection phases.\n\nThis chapter describes the different steps the threat actor took to globally deploy the Black Basta ransomware.\n\n**Identifying Security Mechanisms**\n\nThe Cybereason team identified the threat actor looking for the EDR installed on the machine, through the\nwmic.exe executable.\n\nThe Cybereason team identified the threat actor manually spawning a cmd.exe process on one server, looking for\nthe presence of Cybereason EDR:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Process tree showing the threat actor launching cmd.exe then wmic.exe to identify the presence of Cybereason_\n\nIt is likely the threat actor was looking for machines without a sensor to deploy additional malicious tools without\nbeing detected.\n\n**Spreading through WMI**\n\nThrough the investigation, the Cybereason team identified that the threat actor moved laterally on many machines\nthrough Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Process created through remote WMI_\n\nWMI is leveraged to execute the malicious commands and the ransomware [REDACTED].exe. (We redacted the\nfile name to maintain customer confidentiality.)\n\nThe threat actor deployed the ransomware through what we call a pivot machine, a machine that didn’t have a\nsensor. In that case, that machine was obsolete and had access to every other machine in the network.\n\nThe Cybereason team identified many connections to TCP port 135 from this pivot machine, designed to map the\ninternal network for potential targets.\n\n**Attempts to Disable Security Mechanisms**\n\nAt this point, the threat actor was targeting most of the machines it could reach and made its first attempts to\ndisable the EDR sensor and antivirus software using two scripts, av.bat and av1.bat.\n\n_Process tree showing a remote WMI call to launch 2 bat files, av.bat and av1.bat_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs seen on the capture above, the script calls the msiexec.exe, trying to uninstall the corresponding package of the\nEDR/antivirus.\n\n**Data Encryption: Black Basta**\n\nThis threat alert mostly focuses on the deployment of the ransomware, rather than on the analysis of the\nransomware binary itself, which explains the short size of this subchapter.\n\nCreating the Ransom Note\n\nBlack Basta generates the ransom note file, named readme.txt, in each folder Black Basta reaches on the machine.\nThe image below shows what the content of the file looks like:\n\n_Preview from the dropped ransom note_\n\nThe embedded TOR address links clearly to Black Basta, on the analyzed sample:\n\nhxxps://aazsbsgya565vlu2c6bzy6yfiebkcbtvvcytvolt33s77xypi7nypxyd[.]onion\n\nEncrypting the Files\n\nAfter creating the ransom note, the actual file encryption process ignites. Black Basta encrypts the files on the\nmachine and adds a random extension to each file.\n\nOn top of that, Black Basta replaces the desktop wallpaper and avoids some specific folders like C:\\Windows or the\nRecycle Bin.\n\n**Volume Shadow Copy Deletion**\n\nIn order to delete the machine’s shadow copies, Black Basta executes the process vssadmin.exe with the\ncommand line :Vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\n\nAs seen in the process tree below, the process [REDACTED].exe spawns a cmd.exe process right after the launch\nbegins.\n\n_Cybereason process tree showing [REDACTED].exe launching cmd.exe which calls vssadmin.exe_\n\nOn the observed machine, encryption did not have time to trigger because the process was prevented immediately\nafter its launch.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CYBEREASON RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe [Cybereason Defense Platform can detect and prevent Qakbot post-exploitations and Black Basta impact.](https://www.cybereason.com/platform#graphic)\nCybereason recommends the following actions:\n\n**Enhance Cybereason sensor policies: Set the Cybereason Anti-Ransomware protection mode to**\n**Prevent. More information for Cybereason customers can be found on the NEST.**\n**Enable Variant Payload Protection (VPP) in your Cybereason sensor policy: Upgrade to a version that**\nhas VPP and enable it, as this will completely prevent Black Basta ransomware execution. VPP is supported\nin version 21.2.100 and above (Beta, and disabled by default) and 22.1.183 and above (GA, and enabled by\ndefault). More information can be found on the NEST.\n**Block compromised users: Block users whose machines were involved in the attack, in order to stop or at**\nleast slow down attacker propagation over the network.\n**Identify and block malicious network connections: Identify network flows toward malicious IPs or domains**\nidentified in the reports and block connections to stop the attacker from controlling the compromised\nmachines.\n**Reset Active Directory access: If Domain Controllers (DCs) were accessed by the attacker and potentially**\nall accounts have been stolen, it is recommended that, when rebuilding the network, all AD accesses are\nreset. Important note: krbtgt account needs to be reset twice and in a timely fashion.\n**Engage Incident Response: It is important to investigate the actions of the attacker thoroughly to ensure**\nyou’ve not missed any activity and you’ve patched everything that needs to be patched.\n**Cleanse compromised machines: Isolate and re-image all infected machines, to limit the risk of a second**\ncompromise or the attacker getting subsequent access to the network.\n**Hunt proactively: Use the Investigation screen in the Cybereason Defense Platform and the queries in the**\n**Hunting Queries section** **of the NEST version of this article to search for assets that have potentially been**\nexploited. Based on the search results, take further remediation actions, such as isolating the infected\nmachines, and deleting the payload file.\n**Add IOCs: Add the aforementioned IoCs to the custom reputation with “Block and Prevent.”**\n**Disable disk image file auto-mounting: To prevent this infection technique from succeeding, consider**\ndisabling auto-mounting of disk image files (primarily .iso, .img, .vhd, and .vhdx) globally through GPOs.\n\nThis can be achieved by modifying the registry values related to the Windows Explorer file associations\nin order to disable the automatic Explorer \"Mount and Burn\" dialog for these file extensions. (This will\nnot deactivate the mount functionality itself.)\n\n## IOCs\n\nWe recommend blocking the following domains and IP addresses using your network infrastructure:\n\nAssociated Domains:\n\njesofidiwi[.]com (Cobalt Strike C2)\ndimingol[.]com (Cobalt Strike-related domain used for DNS exfiltration)\ntevokaxol[.]com (Cobalt Strike C2)\n\nvopaxafi[.]com (Cobalt Strike C2)\n\nAssociated IPs:\n\n108.177.235.29\n\n\n-----\n\n144.202.42.216\n\n108.62.118.197\n\nQakbot C2 addresses\n\nServer address Port Number\n\n94.70.37.145 2222\n\n172.90.139.138 2222\n\n70.50.3.214 2222\n\n90.89.95.158 2222\n\n200.93.14.206 2222\n\n142.161.27.232 2222\n\n82.127.174.33 2222\n\n92.207.132.174 2222\n\n92.189.214.236 2222\n\n24.64.114.59 2222\n\n82.31.37.241 443\n\n87.223.80.45 443\n\n76.9.168.249 443\n\n174.115.87.57 443\n\n82.41.186.124 443\n\n131.106.168.223 443\n\n75.98.154.19 443\n\n170.253.25.35 443\n\n\n-----\n\n86.133.237.3 443\n\n73.88.173.113 443\n\n84.209.52.11 443\n\n180.151.104.143 443\n\n105.184.161.242 443\n\n24.49.232.96 443\n\n157.231.42.190 443\n\n75.143.236.149 443\n\n70.64.77.115 443\n\n137.186.193.226 3389\n\n91.165.188.74 50000\n\nAdd the following hashes to the blocklist in your Cybereason environment:\n\nAssociated Hashes (SHA1):\n\n75b2593da627472b1c990f244e24d4e971c939e7 (aficionado.tmp)\n3a852c006085d0ce8a18063e17f525e950bb914c (cob_54.dll)\n4202bf2408750589e36750d077746266176ac239 (cob_56.dll)\n\nHunt for the following files (those are also mentioned in the Hunting Queries chapter):\n\nAssociated file names:\n\nAficionado.tmp (Qbot loader)\nfwpolicyiomgr.dll (Qbot module)\nplugin_payload54.dll\nPlugin_payload55.dll\n\ncob_54.dll\n\nThese indicators can be used for threat hunting purposes.\n\n## ABOUT THE RESEARCHERS\n\n\n-----\n\nLoïc Castel, IR Security Analyst, Cybereason IR Team\n\nLoïc Castel is a Security Analyst with the Cybereason IR team.
