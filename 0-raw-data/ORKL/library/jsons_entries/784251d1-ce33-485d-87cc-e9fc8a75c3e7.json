As a more concrete proof of the way these symbiotic relationships and work flows intersect, we discovered a connection between [EMOTET,](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/exploring-emotet-examining-emotets-activities-infrastructure/)\n[URSNIF, DRIDEX and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/ursnif-the-multifaceted-malware/) [BitPaymer from open source information and the loaders of the samples we had, functioning as if tasks were divided among different](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ransom_bitpaymer.a)\ndevelopers and operators.\n\n\nGo to…\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Connections of EMOTET, DRIDEX, URSNIF and BitPaymer._\n\n**_Background and details_**\n\nIn order to have a better understanding of the significance of these connections, here’s a summarized background of each malware family:\n\nURSNIF / [GOZI-ISFB](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/gozi)\n\nStill considered as one of the global top threats, this banking trojan’s source code was among those [repeatedly leaked because of its evolution and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/online-banking-trojan-brief-history-of-notable-online-banking-trojans) notoriety\nfor adaptive behaviors. This spyware monitors traffic, features a keylogger, and steals credentials stored in browsers and applications. The malware creators of\nGOZI admitted to its creation and distribution, and was [sentenced in 2015 and 2016.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/nikita-kuzmin-creator-gozi-virus-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court)\n\nDRIDEX\n\nAnother banking trojan that [targets banking and financial institutions, the cybercriminals behind it use various methods and techniques to steal personal](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/3147/dealing-with-the-mess-of-dridex)\ninformation and credentials through malicious attachments and HTML injections. DRIDEX evolved from [CRIDEX, GameOver Zeus and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/cridex) [ZBOT, and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/16/the-zeus-zbot-and-kneber-connection) proved\nto be resilient even after it was momentarily taken down in 2015 through [a partnership with the FBI.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/us-law-enforcement-takedown-dridex-botnet/)\n\nEMOTET\n\nDiscovered by [Trend Micro in 2014, this malware acts as a loader for payloads such as](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-banking-malware-uses-network-sniffing-for-data-theft/) [Gootkit, ZeusPanda, IcedID, TrickBot, and DRIDEX for critical](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fake-judicial-spam-leads-to-backdoor-with-fake-certificate-authority/)\nattacks. Other publications have also [mentioned observing obfuscation techniques between EMOTET and URSNIF/GOZI-ISFB.](https://www.hurricanelabs.com/blog/the-emotet-trojan-a-tale-of-two-malware-samples)\n\nBitPaymer\n\nThis ransomware was used to [target medical institutions via remote desktop protocol and other email-related techniques, momentarily shutting down routine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bit-paymer-ransomware-hits-scottish-hospitals/)\nservices for a high ransom. Security [researchers later published evidence that not only was](https://mauronz.github.io/deobf-bitpaymer/) [DRIDEX dropping BitPaymer, but that it also came from the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/) same\ncybercriminal group.\n\nDuring our analysis, we found evidence that the malware families identified had shared loaders: the overview of the payload decryption procedure, and the\nloaders’ internal data structure. While the first figure of the disassembled PE packers had small differences in their arithmetic operations’ instructions, we\nfound that the four payload decryption procedures were identical in data structures’ overview on the way they decrypted the actual PE payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Overview of identical structures of payloads’ loader decryption procedures._\n\nFurther analysis also revealed that the internal data structure of the four malware families were the same. We compared the disassembled codes from the\nsamples we had and noticed the encrypted payload address and size placed into the decryption procedure located at offset 0x34 and 0x38.\n\n_Figure 3. Identical data structures show similar payload addresses and sizes._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Data structure used by the shared loader._\n\nAs cybercrime organizational structures in some countries tend to compartmentalize work, we suspect that the four malware families’ gangs might be in\ncontact with the same weapon providers for PE loaders. In addition, it’s also possible that these four cybercrime groups may establish some attributional –\nworking or otherwise – relationships and have exchanged or continue to exchange resources.\n\n[In our history of monitoring botnets and the underground organizations who make and/or use them, the cybercriminals behind](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/exploring-emotet-examining-emotets-activities-infrastructure/) EMOTET may be sharing to\ncollaborate with trusted, highly-skilled cybercriminal groups, and may be a sign of these four groups’ ongoing and intriguing relationship.\n\nAlliances like these could lead to more destructive malware deployments in the future. More than ever, it is important for organizations to heighten\ncybersecurity preventive measures, such as establishing policies and procedures for handling security threats. Regular education awareness sessions and\nreminders for employees can help protect the enterprise from attacks and intrusions from malicious emails and URLs. Installing and updating a multi-layered\nprotection and solution in preventing online banking threats can go a long way in securing businesses.\n\n**_Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\nTrend Micro endpoint solutions such as the [Smart Protection Suites and](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/complete-user-protection/index.html) [Worry-Free Business Security solutions can protect users and businesses from threats](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/small-business/product-security/?_ga=2.84377822.674697187.1538446194-533054814.1523611328)\nby detecting malicious files and messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs.
