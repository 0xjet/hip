Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers\nattribute this activity to [BRONZE SILHOUETTE (referred to in the advisory as Volt Typhoon)](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-silhouette)\nand have observed the threat group conducting network intrusion operations against U.S\ngovernment and defense organizations since 2021. The tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) and victimology observed during Secureworks incident response (IR) engagements\nsuggest BRONZE SILHOUTTE targets organizations for intelligence-gathering purposes that\nare in alignment with the requirements of the PRC. The threat group has demonstrated\ncareful consideration for operational security such as the use of preinstalled binaries to “live\noff the land,” incorporation of defense evasion techniques, and reliance on compromised\ninfrastructure to prevent detection and attribution of its intrusion activity, and to blend in with\nlegitimate network activity.\n\n## June 2021 IR engagement\n\nDuring a June 2021 engagement, Secureworks incident responders discovered that\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE had gained initial access to the compromised organization's singlefactor Citrix environment via a domain administrator account. It is unclear how the threat\nactors obtained these credentials. BRONZE SILHOUETTE moved laterally to another web\nserver and dropped a simple Java-based web shell (AuditReport.jspx). Secureworks incident\nresponders observed the threat actors execute a series of reconnaissance commands via\nthe web shell (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Reconnaissance commands issued through Java-based web shell. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE then wrote Base64-encoded text to C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ntuser.ini and\ndecoded it to C:\\Windows\\Temp\\iisstart.aspx via the certutil command (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Web shell written to disk, decoded, and copied to remote web server. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\n[The iisstart.aspx file is a C# web shell that is likely a derivative of the Awen web shell and is](https://github.com/SecWiki/WebShell-2/blob/master/Aspx/awen%20asp.net%20webshell.aspx)\nused for remote command execution (see Figure 3). The threat actors copied the web shell\nto a second web server in the environment and used it to gather system information via the\n‘whoami' and ‘tasklist' commands.\n\n_Figure 3. Snippet from the C# web shell deployed by BRONZE SILHOUETTE. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nSecureworks incident responders observed BRONZE SILHOUETTE using the\nAuditReport jspx web shell to perform the following tasks on the first web server:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute the Ntdsutil Active](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/use-ntdsutil-manage-ad-files)\nDirectory (AD) management tool on the domain controller (see Figure 4). This\ncommand creates a copy of the ntds.dit AD database for credential attacks such as\n[pass the hash or offline password hash cracking.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/)\n\n_Figure 4. Credential dumping using Ntdsutil. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCopied the ntds.dit database to the web server via xcopy, compressed the database as\n[a multi-volume password-protected archive via 7-Zip, and saved the volumes to a](https://www.7-zip.org/)\npublic-facing directory on the same server with legitimate-sounding filenames and a .gif\nextension.\nUsed the rd command with the /S switch to delete the threat actors' working directories\nand files.\n\nThe threat actors then exfiltrated the dumped AD database to an external IP address. This IP\naddress belonged to a compromised server at an organization in the same vertical as the\ncompromised organization.\n\n## September 2021 IR engagement\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE reappeared in a September 2021 Secureworks IR engagement\nagainst an organization in the U.S. The threat actors gained initial access by exploiting a\nvulnerability in an internet-facing ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus server (likely CVE2021-40539). BRONZE SILHOUETTE deployed a web shell (ReportGenerate.jsp) and\ninteracted with it to run reconnaissance commands using built-in Windows tools such as net\nuser, nltest, netstat, and systeminfo (see Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. BRONZE SILHOUETTE reconnaissance commands. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nSecureworks incident responders observed the threat actors executing ADSSPlus.exe,\n[which is a renamed csvde.exe file. The csvde.exe command-line utility provides import and](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2113.comma-separated-value-directory-exchange-csvde-utility.aspx)\nexport functionality for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) repositories. The threat\nactors used the '-f' switch, which exports a list of AD objects to the ADSSPlus.dat file (see\nFigure 6).\n\n_Figure 6. Threat actor command to export AD objects to ADSSPlus.dat. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\n[BRONZE SILHOUETTE used the Windows makecab command to compress the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/makecab)\nADSSPlus.dat file into a cabinet (.cab) file, but Secureworks incident responders did not\nobserve the threat actor exfiltrating the file.\n\n## June 2022 IR engagement\n\nDuring a June 2022 engagement, Secureworks incident responders discovered that\nBRONZE SILHOUTTE had deployed a single web shell to multiple servers across the\n[environment after likely exploiting an internet-facing PRTG Network Monitor server. The web](https://www.paessler.com/prtg)\nshell was also a derivative of the Awen web shell but included key modifications such as the\naddition of AES encryption and decryption for command and control (C2) communications.\nBased on web shell file creation timestamps, the network was likely compromised in May\n2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors used WMI to execute the native vssadmin command on a domain\ncontroller to create a volume shadow copy (see Figure 7). They then extracted the ntds.dit\nAD database and the SYSTEM registry hive from the volume shadow copy (see Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7. Threat actor WMI commands to extract the ntds.dit database. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nSecureworks incident responders observed the threat actors using 7-Zip to create an archive\nfile containing the SYSTEM registry hive and ntds.dit, likely for exfiltration. A few days later,\nthe threat actors moved laterally to a ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus server and ran\nreconnaissance commands. One command revealed BRONZE SILHOUETTE searching for\none of its C2 IP addresses (see Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8. Threat actor commands run under the ManageEngine Java process. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nA CTU investigation into the attacker-controlled C2 infrastructure revealed at least three\nPRTG servers belonging to other organizations. This discovery suggests that BRONZE\nSILHOUETTE targets vulnerable PRTG servers for initial access into a target environment\nand to establish its C2 infrastructure.\n\n## BRONZE SILHOUETTE: A member of the new wave of Chinese threat groups?\n\nCTU analysis of the direct observations from BRONZE SILHOUETTE intrusions reveals a\nthreat group that favors web shells for persistence and relies on short bursts of activity\nprimarily involving living-off-the-land binaries to achieve its objectives. For example, the June\n2021 IR engagement determined that the threat actors were inside the compromised network\n\n\n-----\n\nfor only 90 minutes before obtaining the ntds.dit AD database. The threat actors also take\nsteps to identify and remove evidence of their presence on a network, such as inspecting\nserver logs for their C2 IP address and deleting files used during their intrusions.\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE's use of other organizations' compromised servers in its C2 proxy\nnetwork may help obfuscate the source of the intrusion activity and make attribution more\nchallenging. In some intrusions, the C2 communications could blend in with legitimate\nbusiness network traffic to reduce the likelihood of detection.\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE has consistently focused on operational security, including a\nminimal intrusion footprint, incorporation of defense evasion techniques, and use of\ncompromised infrastructure in multiple intrusions. This focus suggests a high level of\noperational maturity and adherence to a blueprint designed to reduce the likelihood of the\ndetection and attribution of its intrusion activity. This attention to operational security,\nparticularly when targeting Western organizations, is consistent with network compromises\nthat CTU researchers have attributed to Chinese threat groups in recent years. These\ntradecraft developments have likely been driven by a series of high-profile U.S. Department\nof Justice indictments of Chinese nationals allegedly involved in cyberespionage activity,\npublic exposures of this type of activity by security vendors, and the consequential likely\nincreased pressure from PRC leadership to avoid public scrutiny of its cyberespionage\nactivity.\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE likely operates on behalf the PRC. The targeting of U.S.\ngovernment and defense organizations for intelligence gain aligns with PRC requirements,\nand the tradecraft observed in these engagements overlap with other state-sponsored\nChinese threat groups.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this threat, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note\nthat IP addresses can be reallocated. The IP addresses may contain malicious content, so\nconsider the risks before opening them in a browser.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\n006c4a5950f75c2c9049cda1a62c09a0 MD5\nhash\n\n4d3572cfc8460fe0299377f6bc05d865a987529f SHA1\nhash\n\n\n3a9d8bb85fbcfe92bae79d5ab18e4bca9eaf36ce\n\na70086e8d1ab85336c83945f\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\nWeb shell (iisstart.aspx)\nused by BRONZE\nSILHOUETTE\n\nWeb shell (iisstart.aspx)\nused by BRONZE\nSILHOUETTE\n\nWeb shell (iisstart.aspx)\nused by BRONZE\nSILHOUETTE\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\naf3a81605aa8e29c8be9e91d2ce19fc1 MD5\nhash\n\na9e32e2bd499c1070f4e0b5a6d85119f1aa0a778 SHA1\nhash\n\n\nfe95a382b4f879830e2666473d662a24b34fccf3\n\n4b6b3505ee1b62b32adafa15\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\n670545a24a2ce2ac7a0e863790bfe2e1 MD5\nhash\n\n4ba6b043313c8d163f2ab7c4505c8b9b8cd68061 SHA1\nhash\n\n\nee8df354503a56c62719656fae71b3502acf9f87\n\n951c55ffd955feec90a11484\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\nBase64-encoded web shell\n(ntuser.ini) used by\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE\n\nBase64-encoded web shell\n(ntuser.ini) used by\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE\n\nBase64-encoded web shell\n(ntuser.ini) used by\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE\n\nJava web shell\n(AuditReport.jspx) used by\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE\n\nJava web shell\n(AuditReport.jspx) used by\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE\n\nJava web shell\n(AuditReport.jspx) used by\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE C2\nserver\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE C2\nserver\n\nBRONZE SILHOUETTE C2\nserver\n\n\n109.166.39.139 IP\naddress\n\n23.227.198.247 IP\naddress\n\n104.161.54.203 IP\naddress\n\n_Table 1.
