Hello Kitty/FiveHands actors aggressively apply pressure to victims typically using the double extortion technique. In some cases, if the victim does not respond quickly or does not pay the ransom, the threat actors will launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the victim company’s public facing website. Hello Kitty/FiveHands actors demand varying ransom payments in Bitcoin (BTC) that appear tailored to each victim, commensurate with their assessed ability to pay it. If no ransom is paid, the threat actors will post victim data to the Babuk site (payload.bin) or sell it to a third-party data broker.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Details\n\n##### Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware uses compromised credentials or known vulnerabilities in SonicWall products (CVE-2021-20016, CVE-2021-20021, CVE-2021- 20022, CVE-2021-20023). Once inside the network, the threat actor will use publicly available penetration tool suites such as Cobalt Strike, Mandiant’s Commando, or PowerShell Empire preloaded with publicly available tools like Bloodhound and Mimikatz to map the network and escalate privileges before exfiltration and encryption. \n\n## Indicators\n\n##### The following indicators were leveraged by threat actors during Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware compromises: \n\n|Tools|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Filename SHA-256||\n|Rclone.exe 53ae3567a34097f29011d752f1d3afab8f92beb36a8d6a5df5c1 d4b12edc1703||\n|Mimikatz.exe 3e02e94e3ecb5d77415c25ee7ecece24953b4d7bd21bf9f9e34 13ffbdad472d2||\n|Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.3850.exe 87bfb05057f215659cc801750118900145f8a22fa93ac4c6e1bfd 81aa98b0a55||\n|Netscan.exe a710f573f73c163d54c95b4175706329db3ed89cd9337c583d0 bb24b6a384789||\n|RouterScan.exe 18229920a45130f00539405fecab500d8010ef93856e1c5bcabf 5aa5532b3311||\n|MEGAClient.exe 9a4acb3112a52fcc58b221b12fa5e90f068247ac3f8990ff2b4bf7 e20ed5b4e1||\n|pCloud.exe 6ce1ab4f45c78a102197258acd2da446902dad2031825c93d87 5660c90df27c4||\n|psexec.c|3337e3875b05e0bfba69ab926532e3f179e8cfbf162ebb60ce58 a0281437a7ef|\n\n\n-----\n\ns3browser-9-5-3.exe 5f312e137beb1ce75f8fdf03a59e1b3cba3dc57ccc16e48daee3e\n\ne52c08fa149\n\n**SombRAT – SHA- 256**\n61e286c62e556ac79b01c17357176e58efb67d86c5d17407e128094c3151f7f9\n\n|PAExec.exe 19ce4f92e7a7b1a812ee2efa834733279ddf1052e123cf36bb77 443197a0ed5f|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|my15.ps1 (Warprism) 3b90d9fad35a45a738c6b2830896168c99014474de17984411b e61b25acf6db5||\n|grabff.exe 7d57e0ba8b36ec221b16807ce4e13a1125d53922fa50c3827a5 ebd6811736ffd||\n|grbachrome.exe 374a98a083fc04f30b86718a9fe7a5a61d1afc22b93222a89d2b 752b5da1df7e||\n|spoolsv.exe 88a2d5cbb7ae903f8208b4a831e8ca6fb5ccb6717d4ea158ce79 2436aa2b9a4d||\n|9e63911b5b7e63023708125418d6d 59f5320b70ef8c51be409aec486366c76f6dff2730b0ab227ffd1 4d5.virus 607a4ba9b54||\n|rfusclient.exe a9226978b33d0bca5b6a216b98dc25558458c28fea11d1ffc650 cab1527dc5d0||\n|s3browser-9-5-3.exe|5f312e137beb1ce75f8fdf03a59e1b3cba3dc57ccc16e48daee3e e52c08fa149|\n\n\n99baffcd7a6b939b72c99af7c1e88523a50053ab966a079d9bf268aff884426e\n\n\nfdc2de095390ec046dc3f398a47a38670282bdc2ef76dd7fc1195ac4ee0421a8\n\n\n71c97ea6d14f4a6da86d51d07ea284447cc486488b9637f9c1de0ba42054c6f2\n\n\nccacf4658ae778d02e4e55cd161b5a0772eb8b8eee62fed34e2d8f11db2cc4bc\n\n\n15df17be2f97295b0d8d66e434e2949850c8edc2a8edddf9b30b2b638b20612b\n\ne09ead5b6ac9ec9203b9fb6c9152ba451498bb291478a69ac71ff6c36c468f9e\n\n**HelloKitty/Five Hands Ransomware**\nionline.exe 02a08b994265901a649f1bcf6772bc06df2eb51e\n\n|HelloKitty/Five Hands Ransomware|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|ionline.exe|02a08b994265901a649f1bcf6772bc06df2eb51e b09906af9fd0f4a8103e9851|\n\n\n-----\n\ne94064401b54c399d3f844fdf08f880cb8c5d74c3\n4de9dc28733dd22dabba678\n\n|f568229e696c0e82abb35ec73d162d5e.virus c2498845ed4b287fd0f95528926c8ee620ef0cbb 5b27865b2007d6379ffe4323|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|dc007e71085297883ca68a919e37687427b7e6db0 dc007e71085297883ca68a919e37687427b7e6d c24ca014c148f226d8dd98f.bin b0c24ca014c148f226d8dd98f||\n|947e357bfdfe411be6c97af6559fd1cdc5c9d6f5cea 947e357bfdfe411be6c97af6559fd1cdc5c9d6f5c 122bf174d124ee03d2de8.bin ea122bf174d124ee03d2de8||\n|ef614b456ca4eaa8156a895f450577600ad41bd553 ef614b456ca4eaa8156a895f450577600ad41bd5 b4512ae6abf3fb8b5eb04e.bin 53b4512ae6abf3fb8b5eb04e||\n|bade05a30aba181ffbe4325c1ba6c76ef9e02cbe41 bade05a30aba181ffbe4325c1ba6c76ef9e02cbe a4190bd3671152c51c4a7b.bin 41a4190bd3671152c51c4a7||\n|52dace403e8f9b4f7ea20c0c3565fa11b6953b404a 52dace403e8f9b4f7ea20c0c3565fa11b6953b40 7d49d63af237a57b36fd2a.bin 4a7d49d63af237a57b36fd2a||\n|a147945635d5bd0fa832c9b55bc3ebcea7a7787e8f a147945635d5bd0fa832c9b55bc3ebcea7a7787 89b98a44279f8eddda2a77.bin e8f89b98a44279f8eddda2a77||\n|0e5f7737704c8f25b2b8157561be54a463057cd4d 0e5f7737704c8f25b2b8157561be54a463057cd4 79c7e016c30a1cf6590a85c.bin d79c7e016c30a1cf6590a85c||\n|servmanger.exe 7be901c5f7ffeb8f99e4f5813c259d02273356803 80ed06df03fb836a041cb06||\n|Hi_Kitty_2.exe 501487b025f25ddf1ca32deb57a2b4db43ccf663 5c1edc74b9cff54ce0e5bcfe||\n|ag.exe 9a7daafc56300bd94ceef23eac56a0735b63ec6b 9a7a409fb5a9b63efe1aa0b0||\n|3ae7bedf236d4e53a33f3a3e1e80eae2d93e91b19 3ae7bedf236d4e53a33f3a3e1e80eae2d93e91b1 88da2f7fcb8fde5dcc3a0e9.bin 988da2f7fcb8fde5dcc3a0e9||\n|10887d13dba1f83ef34e047455a04416d25a83079 10887d13dba1f83ef34e047455a04416d25a830 a7f3798ce3483e0526e3768.bin 79a7f3798ce3483e0526e3768||\n|Outlook.exe|e94064401b54c399d3f844fdf08f880cb8c5d74c3 4de9dc28733dd22dabba678|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Information Requested\n\n##### The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization decides to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so provides investigators and analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.\n\n The FBI may seek the following information:\n\n  Recovered executable files \n  Live memory (RAM) capture \n  Images of infected systems \n  Malware samples \n  IP addresses identified as malicious or suspicious \n  Email addresses of the attackers \n  A copy of the ransom note \n  Ransom amount\n  Bitcoin wallets used by the attackers \n  Bitcoin wallets used to pay the ransom\n  Post-incident forensic reports\n\n## Recommended Mitigations\n\n#####  Back-up critical data offline.\n  Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or\n storage device.\n  Secure your back-ups and ensure all data is not accessible for modification or\n deletion from the system where the data resides.\n\n\n-----\n\n#####  Use two-factor authentication with strong passwords, including for remote\n access services.\n  Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN\n login credentials and change passwords and settings, if applicable.\n  Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date. \n  Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.\n  Review the following additional resources:\n o CISA’s analysis report and malware analysis report on FiveHands\n ransomware provide analysis of a threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures used in a successful cyberattack; indicators of compromise; and recommended mitigations to protect against, detect, and respond to potential FiveHands ransomware attacks. o The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United\n Kingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a network and common mistakes to avoid in incident handling.  o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State\n Information Sharing & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack. o StopRansomware.gov is the US Government’s official one-stop location for\n resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.\n\n If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend the following actions:\n\n  Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and\n disable the computer’s networking capabilities, including wireless and Bluetooth. Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired or wireless.\n  Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove\n from the network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any additional computers or devices that share a network with the infected computer(s), even if they have not been fully encrypted by ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers and\n\n\n-----\n\n##### devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists.\n  Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secured. If\n possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Reporting Notice\n\nThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or\n\ncriminal activity to their local FBI field office. With regards to specific information that appears\n\nin this communication; the context, individual indicators, particularly those of a non\ndeterministic or ephemeral nature (such as filenames or IP addresses), may not be indicative of\n\na compromise. Indicators should always be evaluated in light of your complete information\n\n\nsecurity situation.\n\n\nField office contacts can be identified at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices. When available,\n\neach report submitted should include the date, time, location, type of activity, number of\n\npeople, and type of equipment used for the activity, the name of the submitting company or\n\norganization, and a designated point of contact.\n\n## Administrative Note\n\nThis product is marked TLP:WHITE.
