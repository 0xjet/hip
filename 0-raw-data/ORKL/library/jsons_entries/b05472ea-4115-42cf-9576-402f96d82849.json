Schwartz (euroinfosec) • December 30, 2021](https://www.twitter.com/euroinfosec)\n\nPhoto: Spar\nA ransomware operation called Vice Society has claimed credit for attacks that hit two\n[groups of independently owned and operated Spar-branded stores earlier this month.](https://www.govinfosecurity.com/nordic-choice-hotels-spar-stores-are-latest-attack-victims-a-18082)\n\n**See Also:** OnDemand | Understanding Human Behavior: Tackling Retail's ATO & Fraud\nPrevention Challenge\n\nOn Dec. 6 via Twitter, [Spar reported that for some of its U.K. operations, \"there has been an](https://twitter.com/SPARintheUK/status/1467860628039737354)\nonline attack on our IT systems which is affecting stores' ability to process card payments,\nmeaning that a number of Spar stores are currently closed.\"\n\nNo specific ransomware group was blamed for the attack. But the Vice Society ransomware\ngroup on Friday claimed credit for the hit via its data leak site, says Israeli threat intelligence\nfirm Kela.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpecifically, Vice Society says it infected systems at James Hall & Co., which acts as the\nprimary wholesaler to more than 600 Spar stores in the north of England, and Heron and\nBrearley, owner of Mannin Retail, which operates 19 Spar stores on the Isle of Man. The Isle\nof Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency located in the Irish Sea between Great\nBritain and Northern Ireland.\n\nScreenshot from the Vice Society data leak site (Source: Kela)\n\"When browsing through files leaked by Vice Society, Kela saw documents apparently\nrelated to Spar operations, as well as to both companies mentioned in the listing,\" Victoria\nKivilevich, director of threat research at Kela, tells Information Security Media Group. \"The\ngang published more than 93,000 files.\"\n\n## Attack Aftermath\n\nThe naming of the victims by Vice Society, as well as the dumping of their allegedly stolen\ndata, suggests that neither business paid a ransom to the attackers.\n\nHeron and Brearley didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Multiple emails\nsent to James Hall & Co., for which the website continues to be offline, were returned as\nundeliverable\n\n\n-----\n\nBritain s [National Cyber Security Center on Dec. 10 confirmed that James Hall & Co. had](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/spar-stores-incident)\nbeen attacked.\n\n\"We are aware of an incident affecting some Spar stores serviced by James Hall & Co. in the\nNorth of England and are working with partners in response,\" an NCSC spokesman said at\nthe time. \"James Hall & Co. has confirmed that it is now bringing affected stores back\nonline.\"\n\n[The NCSC also urged organizations to follow its ransomware guidance \"help mitigate](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware-and-ransomware-attacks)\nattacks, their impact and enable effective recovery.\"\n\n## More Attacks\n\nVice Society first launched its data leak site in May, on which it listed Indianapolis, Indianabased [Eskenazi Health, a public health provider. The same month, the group also appeared](https://www.govinfosecurity.com/after-ransomware-attack-when-must-patients-be-notified-a-17387)\nto have been behind a ransomware attack against New Zealand's Waikato District Health\nBoard.\n\nAnd now Vice Society launched their data leak site. At least one of the victims was hit\nby ransomware just recently in May. [https://t.co/sbreVwximY](https://t.co/sbreVwximY)\n[pic.twitter.com/abUvSPMupC— KELA (@Intel_by_KELA) June 24, 2021](https://t.co/abUvSPMupC)\n\nSince then, the group has continued to rack up new victims. In the past week, for example,\nbeyond the Spar operators, the gang has also claimed credit for infecting with ransomware a\nBrazilian dental company and a Colombian university.\n\n## Data-Leaking Ransomware Groups Continue\n\nVice Society is just one of a number of active ransomware groups that run data leak sites. In\nthe past 10 days, Kela says multiple groups have listed fresh victims on their sites. The\ngroups include Alphv - aka Blackcat, AvosLocker, AtomSilo, BlackByte, Clop, Conti,\n54bb47h, Grief, Hive, LockBit, LV, Quantum, Rook, Snatch and Vice Society.\n\nThe monthly total number of victims being listed on ransomware groups' data leak sites\n[continues to increase. Cybersecurity firm Group-IB has reported that for the 12 months](https://www.govinfosecurity.com/ransomware-operations-double-down-on-data-leak-sites-a-18046)\nending on June 30, the number of publicly listed initial access offers - compared to the\npreceding 12-month period - nearly tripled, increasing from 362 to 1,099.\n\n[That trend has been continuing, says Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at threat intelligence](https://twitter.com/uuallan/status/1446458509453889536)\nfirm Recorded Future. In September, he reported that the total number of monthly victims\nbeing listed across all ransomware groups' data leak sites had hit an all-time high.\n\nBut the number of victims of ransomware groups remains unclear, in part because multiple\ngangs don't run data leak sites or attempt to publicly name and shame victims. And of the\nones that do, Group-IB estimates that only 13% of such groups' victims ever get listed on a\n\n\n-----\n\ndata leak site.\n\n\n-----",
