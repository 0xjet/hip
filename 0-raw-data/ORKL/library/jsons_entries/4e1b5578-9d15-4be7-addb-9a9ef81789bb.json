With stealth a key\n\ncomponent, we code-named this\n\ndownloader Furtim, the Latin translation for “stealthy”.\n\nAt time of its �nding, Furtim showed a 0% detection rate in VirusTotal, signifying that the\n\ndevelopers were awarded partial success in their attempt to remain hidden.\n\nIn our labs, we purposefully infected a computer to monitor Furtim’s activities on the device and\n\nits communication with its Command & Control to understand its goals.\n\n**/** enSilo's customers are protected from Furtim **/**\n\n\n-----\n\n# What are Furtim’s components?\n\nA driver. The driver tests the target’s machine environment – for example, the processes\n\nthat it runs and the security programs that are installed.\n\nA downloader. The downloader is the malware component that opens up the backdoor\n\nfor the following installation of malicious modules of the malware, aka the “payloads”. You\n\ncan consider the downloader as the malware socket, a placeholder that sets everything in\n\nplace so that when the threat actor decides that the time is ripe, the payload simply plugs\n\ninto it.\n\nThree payloads. We found three malicious modules: a power con�guration change utility,\n\na stealer and a third �le that communicates back to a server. Details on these appear\n\nbelow.\n\n# What’s so unique about Furtim?\n\nFurtim goes great lengths to ensure that it remains undercover. These measures show that\n\nFurtim’s developers were very thorough in their activity, anticipating a campaign where they\n\ncan use Furtim throughout:\n\nPrior to installation, Furtim checks whether the target machine includes any security\n\nproduct, virtualized or sandboxed environment and foregoes installation if any is found.\n\nIn fact, Furtim tests the existence of these security parties against a monstrous-size list of\n\nmore than 400 items, from the obvious well-known products, to those on the verge of the\n\nesoteric. While we have seen cases where downloaders and other malwares do not install\n\nif other products are present, the list that Furtim tests against is beyond any typical\n\nmalware.\n\nFurtim avoids DNS �ltering services by scanning the network interfaces on the infected\n\nmachine. If it �nds any of these services, it replaces any known �ltering nameserver to\n\npublic nameservers o�ered by Google and Level3 Communications.\n\nFurtim blocks access to nearly 250 security related sites, such as AV update sites, by\n\nreplacing Windows' hosts �le. The blocked sites list also includes technical help sites such\n\nas BleepingComputer.com.\n\nOnce installed, the target’s device has to be re-booted in order for Furtim to properly latch\n\ninto the system. At that stage, Furtim ensures that any re-boot policy on a machine, even\n\nthose de�ned by an administrator (aka “Group Policy”) is overridden so that downloaded\n\npayloads will run.\n\nOn �rst run, Furtim does a few con�guration changes on its host system to block the user\n\nfrom accessing the command line and task manager. These measures are taken to\n\nprevent the possibility that these tools might reveal, or used to kill, the malicious\n\nprocesses. In addition, Furtim disables Windows noti�cation and pop-up mechanisms.\n\nUpon initial communication, Furtim collects unique information from the device it is\n\nrunning on, such as the computer name and installation date and sends that information\n\nto a speci�c server. The server stores the received details about the infected machine to\n\nens re that the pa load is sent onl once In fact e en if the infected machine sends the\n\n\n-----\n\npayload and will return 404 error on any of these subsequent requests. We believe that\n\nthis is done to prevent security researchers and AV companies trying to collect the\n\nsamples from the server by repeating previous requests or running the sample multiple\n\ntimes.\n\n# What are the payloads that Furtim\n\n accepts?\n\nWe have witnessed the following three payloads though it is possible that Furtim was\n\ndeveloped to accept more than just these three.\n\n1. Power saving con�guration tool. The tool disables sleep mode and hibernation to ensure\n\nthat the system is always up and running unless manually shut down by a user. This way,\n\nopen communications with the C&C server is maintained.\n\n2. A stealer, named Pony Stealer. Pony Stealer is a commercial credential stealer, considered\n\none of the more powerful stealers in the market today. As its name implies, this malicious\n\nprogram steals saved credentials from various installed programs and sends them back\n\nto a server where they are conveniently organized in a searchable web platform for easy\n\naccess. In practice, stealers are used to aid in lateral movement inside the organization.\n\n3. A third unknown payload. This payload communicates back a list of certain discovered\n\nprocesses to a Russian server. These processes of interest include virtualization\n\nenvironments and security products. On the face of it, Furtim would not have installed\n\nwere these processes in place, however, this double check is done as a second\n\nprecautionary step. This third payload may very well include also the main malicious\n\nfunctionality and persistence capabilities. Given its complexity, it will take a while to\n\ncompletely understand that extent of its functionality. We will update its section, once\n\nmore details are revealed.\n\n# Who’s behind this attack?\n\nGiven the defense measures that Furtim takes, we can imagine that Furtim is more than a\n\ndownloader used by common fraudsters. The threat actors behind Furtim were dedicated,\n\nknowing that it’s worth to remain stealthy, even on the expense of hitting more targets, than\n\nbeing revealed.\n\nWe do know that the C&C server is hosted at a Russian domain, which resolves to several\n\nUkrainian IP addresses.\n\nAdditionally, communications are con�gured to accept Russian.\n\nWith this in mind, it is easy to point a �nger at Russia. However, we cannot jump to those\n\nconclusions as threat actors typically hide their identity by masquerading as coming from a\n\ncertain location.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Who is Furtim targeting?\n\nThis is one more question we don’t have the answer for. Nor do we know how the victim\n\nbecomes infected. We do know that this is an active malware as the server is live and kicking,\n\ncommunicating with its instances.\n\n# How can you protect yourself against\n\n Furtim and other such malware?\n\nAll evidence points that the threat actors behind Furtim are dedicated and will take the\n\nnecessary measures to slowly infect and remain stealthy. The dedicated threat actor has the\n\nwill and time to in�ltrate. With this in mind, we need to recognize that in�ltration is\n\ninevitable, and address threat actors under the assumption that they already inside. This\n\napproach requires cutting out in real-time the malicious communications so that once inside,\n\nthey cannot communicate outbound and in return, the consequences of the attack are\n\nprevented.\n\n\n### Get Technical!\n\n Schedule a Demo of enSilo's Exfiltration\n\n Prevention Platform\n\n\nPOST TAGS [RESEARCH](http://blog.ensilo.com/topic/research)\n\n\n**Comments for this thread are now closed.** **×**\n\n\n**0 Comments** **[Ensilo Blog](https://disqus.com/home/forums/ensiloblog/)** [1](https://disqus.com/home/inbox/) **Login**\n\n\n Recommend\n\n\n###### ⤤ Share Sort by Best\n\nThis discussion has been closed.\n\n\n###### ✉ Subscribe d Add Disqus to your site Add Disqus Add � Privacy\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Subscribe to enSilo's Blog and Stay on Top of the Latest\n\n Security Research and Industry News\n\nEmail*\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Congress Calling Out on HIPAA](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-congress-calling-out-on-hipaa)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Symantec Critical Vulnerability](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-symantec-critical-vulnerability)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Breach at the Clinton Foundation](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-breach-at-the-clinton-foundation)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Nation State Cyber-Espionage](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-nation-state-cyber-espionage-sofacy)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Cryptxxx Nearing Extinction](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-cryptxxx-nearing-extinction)\n\n[Revenge of the Nerds: enSilo Featured as Gartner’s Cool Vendor](http://blog.ensilo.com/revenge-of-the-nerds-ensilo-featured-as-gartners-cool-vendor)\n\n[Furtim: The Ultra-Cautious Malware](http://blog.ensilo.com/furtim-the-ultra-cautious-malware)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Vulnerability in SAP](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-vulnerability-in-sap)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: The Feds Issue Cyber Espionage Alerts](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-the-feds-issue-cyber-espionage-alerts)\n\n[Cyber-Security in 120 Secs: Breach at Bay Area's Children's Association](http://blog.ensilo.com/cyber-security-in-120-secs-breach-at-bay-areas-childrens-association)\n\n#### Posts by Topic\n\n[Weekly Security News (41)](http://blog.ensilo.com/topic/weekly-security-news)\n\n[Research (10)](http://blog.ensilo.com/topic/research)\n\n[Industry (7)](http://blog.ensilo.com/topic/industry)\n\n[Business (6)](http://blog.ensilo.com/topic/business)\n\n[Windows (5)](http://blog.ensilo.com/topic/windows)\n\n#### Archive by Month\n\n[May 2016 (9)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2016/05)\n\n[October 2015 (7)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2015/10)\n\n[February 2016 (7)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2016/02)\n\n[December 2015 (6)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2015/12)\n\n[January 2016 (6)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2016/01)\n\n[November 2015 (5)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2015/11)\n\n[March 2016 (4)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2016/03)\n\n\n-----\n\n[March 2015 (2)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2015/03)\n\n[April 2015 (2)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2015/04)\n\n[June 2015 (2)](http://blog.ensilo.com/archive/2015/06)\n\nsee all\n\n\n#### Prevent threat actors from ex�ltrating your data.\n\n Schedule a demo.\n\n\n© C O P Y R I G H T E N S I L O\n####  /  /  / \n\n\n-----",
