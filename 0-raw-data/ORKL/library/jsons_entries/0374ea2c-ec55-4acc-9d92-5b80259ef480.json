This discovery comes on the heels of alerts by the Ukrainian Computer Emergency](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ukrainian-cyber-officials-warn-of-new-wave-of-phishing-attacks/)\nResponse Team (CERT-UA) and the State Service of Special Communications and\nInformation Protection of Ukraine about widespread phishing campaigns targeting private\nemail accounts of Ukrainian armed service members by ‘UNC1151’, which Proofpoint tracks\nas part of TA445. The email observed by Proofpoint may represent the next stage of these\nattacks. The email included a malicious macro attachment which utilized social engineering\nthemes pertaining to the Emergency Meeting of the NATO Security Council held on February\n23, 2022. The email also contained a malicious attachment which attempted to download\n\n\n-----\n\nmalicious Lua malware named SunSeed and targeted European government personnel\ntasked with managing transportation and population movement in Europe. While Proofpoint\nhas not definitively attributed this campaign to the threat actor TA445, researchers\nacknowledge that the timeline, use of compromised sender addresses aligning with\nUkrainian government reports, and the victimology of the campaign align with published\nTA445 tactics to include the targeting and collection around refugee movement in Europe.\n\nProofpoint assesses that, in light of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, actions by proxy actors\nlike TA445 will continue to target European governments to gather intelligence around the\nmovement of refugees from Ukraine and on issues of importance to the Russian government.\n[TA445, which appears to operate out of Belarus, specifically has a history of engaging in a](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\nsignificant volume of disinformation operations intended to manipulate European sentiment\naround the movement of refugees within NATO countries. These controlled narratives may\nintend to marshal anti-refugee sentiment within European countries and exacerbate tensions\nbetween NATO members, decreasing Western support for the Ukrainian entities involved in\n[armed conflict. This approach is a known factor within the hybrid warfare model employed](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/07/03/west-fears-russia-s-hybrid-warfare.-they-re-missing-bigger-picture-pub-79412)\nby the Russian military and by extension that of Belarus.\n\n## Delivery\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Proofpoint detected an email originating from a ukr[.]net email\naddress which was sent to a European government entity. The email utilized the subject \"IN\nACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE\nSECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022\" and included a macro enabled\nXLS file titled “list of persons.xlsx,” which was later determined to deliver SunSeed malware.\nThe social engineering lure utilized in this phishing campaign were very timely, following a\nNATO Security Council meeting on February 23, 2022 and a news story about a Russian\ngovernment “kill list” targeting Ukrainians that began circulating in Western media outlets\non February 21, 2022. The format of the subject included the date “24.02.2022” at the end of\nsubject line and was superficially similar to emails reported by the State Service of Special\nCommunications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) on February 25, 2022.\nThis alert indicated that mass phishing campaigns were targeting “Citizens’ e-mail addresses”\nin Ukraine. The timing of the Proofpoint observed campaign is notable as it occurred within\nclose proximity to the campaigns reported by Ukrainian state agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 1. SSSCIP Ukraine reported email including date format 24.02.2022.](https://twitter.com/dsszzi/status/1497103078029291522)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 2. CERT-UA reports of UNC1151 targeting private accounts of Ukrainian military](https://www.facebook.com/UACERT/posts/312939130865352)_\n_personnel._\n\nOpen-source research on the sender email address identified the account on a Ukrainian\npublic procurement document for a Stihl lawn mower in 2016. The email account was listed\nas the contact address on the purchase, while the customer was listed as “Військова частина\nА2622” or military unit A2622. This title, as well as the address listed, appear to refer to a\nmilitary barracks that houses a military unit in “Чернігівська область” or the Chernihiv\nregion of Ukraine. While Proofpoint has not definitively determined that this detected\ncampaign is aligned with the phishing campaigns reported by the Ukrainian government or\nthat this activity can be attributed to TA445, researchers assess that this may represent a\ncontinuation of the campaigns that utilize compromised Ukrainian personal accounts of\narmed service members to target the governments of NATO members in Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Ukrainian military procurement documents including possible compromised_\n_sender email as contact._\n\n## Macro Enabled Attachments\n\nThe malicious XLS attachment observed in the email was laden with a simple but distinct\nmacro. When enabled, it executes a VB macro named “Module1” which creates a Windows\nInstaller (msiexec.exe) object invoking Windows Installer to call out to an actor-controlled\nstaging IP and download a malicious MSI package. It also sets a Microsoft\n[document UILevel equal to “2” which specifies a user interface level of “completely silent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/uilevel)\ninstallation.” This hides all macro actions and network connections from the user. The actor\n[accesses the delivery IP via the Microsoft Installer InstallProduct method which is intended](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/downloading-an-installation-from-the-internet)\n\n\n-----\n\nto obtain an MSI install file from a URL, save it to a cached location, and finally begin\ninstallation of the MSI package. Since the actor is utilizing an MSI package as an installer for\na Lua-based malware, this method is well suited to be deployed via a malicious macro-laden\ndocument delivered via phishing.\n\n_Figure 4. Observed malicious macro within list of persons.xlsx._\n\n## SunSeed Lua Malware Installation\n\nAnalysis of the actor-controlled delivery infrastructure identified an MSI package which\ninstalled a series of Lua-based dependencies, executed a malicious Lua script that Proofpoint\nhas dubbed SunSeed, and established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at\n[Windows Startup. This file, named qwerty_setup.msi, was previously identified publicly by](https://twitter.com/cybercdh/status/1497486233743863812)\n\n\n-----\n\n[security researcher Colin Hardy in response to Proofpoint s initial content regarding this](https://twitter.com/threatinsight/status/1497355737844133895)\nthreat. The package installs 12 legitimate Lua dependencies, a Windows Lua interpreter, a\nmalicious Lua script (SunSeed), and a Windows shortcut LNK file for persistence. Notably,\nthe legitimate Windows Lua interpreter sppsvc.exe has been modified so it does not print any\noutput to the Windows Console. This is likely an effort to conceal the malware installation\nfrom the infected user. All files, except for the LNK file, are installed to the folder\nC:\\ProgramData\\.security-soft\\. The LNK persistence script, which executes the SunSeed\ncommand “print.lua” via the Window Lua interpreter, is saved to the directory\nC:\\ProgramData\\.security-soft\\sppsvc.exe to be executed at startup. This executes the\nmalicious SunSeed Lua script “print.lua” that attempts to retrieve additional malicious Lua\ncode from the actor command and control (C2) server.\n\n**Legitimate Files and Lua Dependencies:**\n\nluacom.dll (LuaCom Library)\nltn12.lua (LuaSocket: LTN12 module)\nmime.lua (MIME support for the Lua language)\nhttp.lua (HTTP library for Lua)\nurl.lua (luasocket)\ntp.lua (luasocket)\nsocket.lua (luasocket)\ntp.lua\ncore.dll\nmime.dll\nlua51.dll\nsppsvc.exe (Lua Windows Standalone Interpreter – modified to suppress console\noutput)\n<6 characters>.rbs (Windows Installer Rollback Script)\n\n**Persistence File:**\n\nSoftware Protection Service.lnk\n\nInstallation Directory:\n\n~\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Software\nProtection Service.lnk\n\n**Malicious SunSeed Lua Script:**\n\nprint.lua|\n7bf33b494c70bd0a0a865b5fbcee0c58fa9274b8741b03695b45998bcd459328\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Asylum Ambuscade - Campaign Snapshot._\n\nProofpoint researchers observed several distinct and unusual aspects about the MSI package\nupon closer inspection. The actor utilized the Japanese Shift-JIS code base, resulting in a\nJapanese language installation message upon launching the MSI package. This may be a\nrudimentary false flag intended to conceal the spoken language of the threat actor.\nAdditionally, examination of the cryptography calls made by the package during installation\nindicates that the MSI file appears to have been created using a dated version of WiX Toolset\nversion 3.11.0.1528. This is an open-source software that allows users to “build MSIs without\nrequiring additional software on a build server” from the command line. This version was last\nupdated in 2017 with a more recent update being pushed in 2019 and an entirely new version\nof the toolset made available in May 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Japanese code base MSI package installation display._\n\n_Figure 7. MSI package cryptography call indicating Windows Installer XML version._\n\n## SunSeed Malware Capabilities: A Lua Downloader\n\nBased on decoding of the SunSeed print.lua malicious second stage payload script, it appears\nto be a simple downloader which obtains the C Drive partition serial number from the host,\nappends to a URL request via a Lua socket, consistently pings the C2 server for additional\n\n\n-----\n\nLua code, and executes the code upon receiving it within a response. At the time of analysis,\nProofpoint did not receive additional Lua code from the C2 server. However, researchers\nbelieve that this is likely intended to deliver subsequent stage payloads to the infected host.\nFurther attempts to decode the SunSeed Lua host included several notable strings that may\nsuggest a possible response from the actor-controlled server. These strings do not appear to\nbe part of the initial SunSeed script’s functionality in the absence of a C2 server response.\nObserved string values include, but are not limited to:\n\n“serial”\n“string”\n“luacom”\n“CreateObject”\n“Scripting.FileSystemObject”\n“Drives”\n“SerialNumber”\n“socket.http”\n“request”\n“http://84.32.188[.]96/”\n“ socket”\n“sleep”\n\n## Command and Control\n\nThe SunSeed malware when executed issues GET requests over HTTP via port 80 using a Lua\nSocket. The requests are issued to the C2 server every three seconds anticipating a response.\nThe malware specifies the user agent as “LuaSocket 2.0.2” and appends the infected target’s\nC Drive partition serial number to the URI request. This is a unique decimal digit value\nassigned to a drive upon creation of the file system. It may be an attempt by actors to track\ninfected victims on the backend per their unique serial number. Additionally, this may allow\noperators to be selective about which infections are issued a next stage payload response.\nBased on the observed strings in the Lua script, researchers speculate that the server\nresponse may include further malicious commands, or a Lua based installer code which is\nexecuted as a response to the SunSeed payload, depending on the received serial\nidentification number.\n\n_Figure 8. SunSeed Lua malware C2 communication._\n\n## Victimology and Targeting\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the finite data set available to Proofpoint surrounding this campaign, limited\nconclusions can be drawn regarding targeting. The Proofpoint-observed email messages were\nlimited to European governmental entities. The targeted individuals possessed a range of\nexpertise and professional responsibilities. However, there was a clear preference for\ntargeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget\nallocation, administration, and population movement within Europe. This campaign may\nrepresent an attempt to gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement\nof funds, supplies, and people within NATO member countries.\n\n## Attribution Remains Unclear\n\nSeveral temporal and anecdotal indicators exist which suggest that this activity aligns with\n[reported campaigns by the threat actor TA445/UNC1151/Ghostwriter. However, Proofpoint](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\nhas not yet observed concrete technical overlaps which would allow us to definitively\nattribute this campaign to this actor. In addition to the notable overlaps with Ukrainian\ngovernment reported campaigns referenced previously, the victimology of this campaign with\nprominent NATO governments being targeted and a possible focus on the movements of\nrefugees in NATO countries recalls historic motivations of TA445’s information operations\ncirca 2021. Specifically, the anti-migratory narratives disseminated by the group also referred\nto as Ghostwriter during the 2021 migratory crisis in which Belarus intentionally funneled\nrefugees to the Polish border belies a possible connection between this 2022 campaign and\nTA445’s historic mandate. Mainly both campaigns may indicate the weaponization of\nmigrants and refugees of war through a hybrid information warfare and targeted cyberattack model. Researchers at Mandiant addressed these tactics by UNC1151’s information\n[operation team referred to as Ghostwriter (collectively TA445) in a recent presentation (12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2KqGBkDwww)\ntime stamp), disclosing the existence of the group and attributing the activity to Belarus.\nProofpoint also notes that, in addition to the Asylum Ambuscade operation, in recent days\nresearchers have detected TA445 credential harvesting activity that aligns with Mandiant’s\ndescription of this threat group to include the use of GoPhish to deliver malicious email\ncontent. This activity appears distinct from the Asylum Ambuscade campaign. Proofpoint is\ncurrently tracking the actor responsible for Asylum Ambuscade as distinct from TA445 until\na technical relationship can be further established.\n\n**Tactic** **Asylum Ambuscade Campaign** **TA445**\n\n**Document Attachment Phishing**\n\n**Focus on Refugee Issues and NATO**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Use of Macro Enabled Documents**\n\n**Use of GoPhish**\n\n**Use of MSI Packages**\n\n**Use of Lua Based Malware**\n\n**Use of Compromised Sender**\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\n_Figure 9. Comparison of Asylum Ambuscade campaign and TA445 TTPs._\n\nWhile Proofpoint has not definitively determined attribution at this time, researchers assess\nwith moderate confidence that this campaign and a historic campaign from July 2021 were\nconducted by the same threat actor. The July 2021 campaign utilized a highly similar macroladen XLS attachment to deliver MSI packages that install a Lua malware script. Similarly,\nthe campaign utilized a very recent government report as the basis of the social engineering\n[content and titled the malicious attachment “list of participants of the briefing.xls.” In](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a8fd0a5de66fa39056c0ddf2ec74ccd38b2ede147afa602aba00a3f0b55a88e0)\naddition to the file name being quite similar to the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, the Lua\nscript created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of\nthe infected victim’s C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in\nboth samples revealed that the same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create\nthe MSI packages. Finally, the macros in this historic campaign utilized the identical\ntechnique as the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, using Windows Installer to retrieve an MSI\npackage from an actor-controlled IP resource and suppressing indications of installation\nfrom the user. The July 2021 campaign targeted senior cyber security practitioners and\ndecisionmakers at private US-based companies, including those in the defense sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Historic malicious macro seen in July 2021._\n\n## Conclusion: Balancing Accurate Reporting in a Timely Fashion\n\nThis activity, independent of attribution conclusions, represents an effort to target NATO\nentities with compromised Ukrainian military accounts during an active period of armed\nconflict between Russia, its proxies, and Ukraine. In publishing this report, Proofpoint seeks\nto balance the accuracy of responsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of\nactionable intelligence. The onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has\naccelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to\nanswer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state\noperators. However, these are issues that Proofpoint will continue to research while\n\n\n-----\n\nprotecting customers globally. Proofpoint invites additional details and input around any\nobserved activity that aligns with these reports. While the utilized techniques in this\ncampaign are not groundbreaking individually, if deployed collectively, and during a high\ntempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective. As the conflict continues,\nresearchers assess similar attacks against governmental entities in NATO countries are likely.\nAdditionally, the possibility of exploiting intelligence around refugee movements in Europe\nfor disinformation purposes is a proven part of Russian and Belarussian-state techniques.\nBeing aware of this threat and disclosing it publicly are paramount for cultivating awareness\namong targeted entities.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**IOC** **Type of**\n\n**IOC**\n\n<redacted>@ukr[.]net Sender\n\nEmail\n\n\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING\nOF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022\n\n\nEmail\nSubject\n\n\nlist of persons.xls\n1561ece482c78a2d587b66c8eaf211e806ff438e506fcef8f14ae367db82d9b3\n\n\nAttachment\n\n\n84.32.188[.]96 IP\n\n\nqwerty_setup.msi\n\n31d765deae26fb5cb506635754c700c57f9bd0fc643a622dc0911c42bf93d18f\n\n\nMSI\nPackage\n\n\nprint.lua\n7bf33b494c70bd0a0a865b5fbcee0c58fa9274b8741b03695b45998bcd459328\n\n\nLua Script\n\n\n-----\n\nluacom.dll\nf97f26f9cb210c0fcf2b50b7b9c8c93192b420cdbd946226ec2848fd19a9af2c\n\nltn12.lua\nb1864aed85c114354b04fbe9b3f41c5ebc4df6d129e08ef65a0c413d0daabd29\n\nmime.lua\ne9167e0da842a0b856cbe6a2cf576f2d11bcedb5985e8e4c8c71a73486f6fa5a\n\nhttp.lua\nd10fbef2fe8aa983fc6950772c6bec4dc4f909f24ab64732c14b3e5f3318700c\n\nsocket.dll\n3694f63e5093183972ed46c6bef5c63e0548f743a8fa6bb6983dcf107cab9044\n\nmime.dll\n976b7b17f2663fee38d4c4b1c251269f862785b17343f34479732bf9ddd29657\n\nlua5.1.dll\nfbbe7ee073d0290ac13c98b92a8405ea04dcc6837b4144889885dd70679e933f\n\nurl.lua\n269526c11dbb25b1b4b13eec4e7577e15de33ca18afa70a2be5f373b771bd1ab\n\nsppsvc.exe\n737f08702f00e78dbe78acbeda63b73d04c1f8e741c5282a9aa1409369b6efa8\n\ntp.lua\n\n343afa62f69c7c140fbbf02b4ba2f7b2f711b6201bb6671c67a3744394084269\n\nsocket.lua\n15fd138a169cae80fecf4c797b33a257d587ed446f02ecf3ef913e307a22f96d\n\n\nFiles\n\n\nSoftware Protection Service.lnk File Name\n\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Software\nProtection Service.lnk\n\n\nDirectory\n\nPath\n\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\.security-soft Directory\n\nPath\n\nhxxp://84.32.188[.]96/<hexadecimal_value> URL\n\n\n-----\n\nlist of participants of the briefing.xls\n\na8fd0a5de66fa39056c0ddf2ec74ccd38b2ede147afa602aba00a3f0b55a88e0\n\n\nFile\n\n\n157.230.104[.]79 IP\n\n\ni.msi\n\n2e1de7b61ed25579e796ec4c0df2e25d2b98a1f8d4fdb077e2b52ee06c768fca\n\n\nMSI\nPackage\n\n\nhxxp://45.61.137[.]231/?id=<hexdecimal_value> URL\n\n\nwlua5.1.exe\n\n737f08702f00e78dbe78acbeda63b73d04c1f8e741c5282a9aa1409369b6efa8\n\ncore.lua\n\n737f08702f00e78dbe78acbeda63b73d04c1f8e741c5282a9aa1409369b6efa8\n\nluacom.dll\n\nf97f26f9cb210c0fcf2b50b7b9c8c93192b420cdbd946226ec2848fd19a9af2c\n\nstruct.dll\n\n5b317f27ad1e2c641f85bef601740b65e93f28df06ed03daa1f98d0aa5e69cf0\n\nltn12.lua\n\nb1864aed85c114354b04fbe9b3f41c5ebc4df6d129e08ef65a0c413d0daabd29\n\nmime.lua\n\ne9167e0da842a0b856cbe6a2cf576f2d11bcedb5985e8e4c8c71a73486f6fa5a\n\nhttp.lua\n\nd10fbef2fe8aa983fc6950772c6bec4dc4f909f24ab64732c14b3e5f3318700c\n\nsocket.dll\n\n3694f63e5093183972ed46c6bef5c63e0548f743a8fa6bb6983dcf107cab9044\n\n\nFiles\n\n\n-----\n\ncore.dll\n\n9aa3ca96a84eb5606694adb58776c9e926020ef184828b6f7e6f9b50498f7071\n\ncore.lua\n\n20180a8012970453daef6db45b2978fd962d2168fb3b2b1580da3af6465fe2f6\n\nmime.dll\n\n976b7b17f2663fee38d4c4b1c251269f862785b17343f34479732bf9ddd29657\n\nlua5.1.dll\n\nfbbe7ee073d0290ac13c98b92a8405ea04dcc6837b4144889885dd70679e933f\n\nurl.lua\n\n269526c11dbb25b1b4b13eec4e7577e15de33ca18afa70a2be5f373b771bd1ab\n\nalien.lua\n\n303e004364b1beda0338eb10a845e6b0965ca9fa8ee16fa9f3a3c6ef03c6939f\n\ntp.lua\n\n343afa62f69c7c140fbbf02b4ba2f7b2f711b6201bb6671c67a3744394084269\n\nsocket.lua\n\n15fd138a169cae80fecf4c797b33a257d587ed446f02ecf3ef913e307a22f96d\n\n**YARA Signatures**\n\n\n-----\n\nrule WindowsInstaller_Silent_InstallProduct_MacroMethod\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"Proofpoint Threat Research\"\n\ndate = \"20210728\"\n\nhash = \"1561ece482c78a2d587b66c8eaf211e806ff438e506fcef8f14ae367db82d9b3;\na8fd0a5de66fa39056c0ddf2ec74ccd38b2ede147afa602aba00a3f0b55a88e0\"\n\nreference = \"This signature has not been quality controlled in a production\nenvironment.
