The specific points of connection between these new samples and Operation Blockbuster](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\ninclude:\n\n[payloads delivered by the macros discussed in Operation Blockbuster Sequel](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-the-blockbuster-sequel/)\n[malware used by the HiddenCobra threat group](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A)\n[malware used in the 2016 attack on the Bangladesh SWIFT banking system](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.jp/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\n[APK samples mimicking legitimate APKs hosted on Google Play](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/android-malware-appears-linked-to-lazarus-cybercrime-group)\n\nAlthough Unit 42 cannot provide a full picture of the details surrounding the delivery of these samples, we are confident this activity targets\nKorean language speakers who use Samsung devices. Based on this evidence we believe this new malware is likely targeting South Koreans.\n\nThe newly discovered samples show new capabilities not previously documented. A strong relationship between previously identified malware\nsamples attributed to these campaigns and the newly discovered samples examined in this report.\n\nNew Malware Cluster\n\nAt the center of the cluster of new malware samples is a PE (ed9e373a687e42a84252c2c01046824ed699b32add73dcf3569373ac929fd3b9)\nuploaded to VirusTotal with the filename \"JAVAC.EXE\". The sample requires two command line parameters to run, the first is a port number\nwhich the binary binds to, acting as a webserver, and the second is also a port number which is used for encrypted protocol communications.\n\nThe first port mimics an Apache server, using header values that Apache would use and will serve different resources to requests on the port,\ndepending on the User-Agent header values used. Some of the responses given are embedded in the original PE, whilst others are expected\nto be found on the local disk. The following JavaScript files are embedded in the resource section of JAVAC.exe:\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Purpose**\n\n\n**jquery50.js**\n\n\n2b15e4289a3eb8e4eb8c2343895002dde7f5b2791e3c799b4f869be0aa85d2e8 Gets and sets client HTTP Cookie header\nvalues e.g. \"GoogleAppCookie\".

These are used to accomplish\nthe following:\n\nInstall and invoke an APK\n\nWrite an ELF file to disk on the client\n\nThree nested APKs which ultimately lead to\na backdoor APK implant. This file is likely\ninstalled silently by visiting the next resource\nwith an HTTP client.\n\nFurther details on this APK follow below.\n\n\nThe system name this PE HTTP server is intended to execute on has a hostname of \"RUMPUS-5ED8EE00\". This is checked by JAVAC.exe\nduring execution. Besides the resources listed in the table above, it is important to note that JAVAC.exe expects additional files located on the\nsystem due to some of the resources referencing local JavaScript files. These include the following filenames:\n\nmboard_ok.css\nnode_n.js\nnode_e.js\nnode_g.js\nnode_p.js\nnode_ok.js\nnode_nc.js\nnode_ex.js\n\nWe have not been able to obtain copies of these resources.\n\nRelated ELF ARM Samples\n\nThe ELF ARM file embedded in main.js is written to HTTP clients' disks by the logic in main.js. Below is a table outlining indicators from this\nembedded ELF ARM.\n\n**SHA256** **Description** **Embedded IPv4**\n**Addresses**\n\n\n0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf2a8fd7142d ELF ARM file embedded in\nmain.js\n\n\n97.211.212.31\n\n14.139.200.107\n\n175.100.189.174\n\n\n[This ELF ARM file is one of three we identified. These ELF files are similar to PE files named Cruprox by](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-041002-5341-99) [Symantec,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group) [Manuscrypt by Kaspersky,](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332/)\n[and Clevore by Trend Micro. The ELF ARM samples contain lists of domains (used for deception) and IPv4 addresses (used for command and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_clevore.a)\ncontrol). These domains and IPv4 addresses are used to generate crafted TLS sessions similarly to the \"fake TLS\" communication\n[mechanisms in section 4.3.3.1 of the Operation Blockbuster report by Novetta.](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n\n[The ELF ARM samples choose one of the embedded domains to populate an SNI field of a TLS connection to one of the embedded IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)\naddresses. By doing command and control in this way an analyst observing the connection stream only sees what looks like (but is not) a TLS\nconnection to a legitimate domain name. The domain names included in\n0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf2a8fd7142d are as follows:\n\nmyservice.xbox[.]com\nuk.yahoo[.]com\nweb.whatsapp[.]com\nwww.apple[.]com\nwww.baidu[.]com\nwww.bing[.]com\nwww.bitcoin[.]org\nwww.comodo[.]com\nwww.debian[.]org\nwww.dropbox[.]com\nwww.facebook[.]com\nwww.github[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\ngoog e[ ]co\nwww.lenovo[.]com\nwww.microsoft[.]com\nwww.paypal[.]com\nwww.tumblr[.]com\nwww.twitter[.]com\nwww.wetransfer[.]com\nwww.wikipedia[.]org\n\nAn example TLS \"Client Hello\" record generated by 0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf2a8fd7142d is given below.\nIt includes a legitimate domain name in its SNI field yet is sent to a command and control IPv4 address.\n\nBy examining strings, binary functions, and embedded IPv4 addresses of\n0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf2a8fd7142d, we were able to hunt for and locate two additional ELF ARM\nsamples. Below is a table of the related ELF ARM samples:\n\n**SHA256** **Description**\n\n**800f9ffd063dd2526a4a43b7370a8b04fbb9ffeff9c578aa644c44947d367266** ELF ARM file likely of the same malware family as\n0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf\nEmbedded in\n06cadaac0710ed1ef262e79c5cf12d8cd463b226d45d0014b208\n(described below)\n\n\n**153db613853fb42357acb91b393d853e2e5fe98b7af5d44ab25131c04af3b0d6**\n\nRelated APK Samples\n\n\nELF ARM file likely of the same malware family as\n0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf\n\n\nIn addition to ELF ARM files the HTTP Server can also serve APK files. As previously stated, an APK with SHA256\n4694895d6cc30a336d125d20065de25246cc273ba8f55b5e56746fddaadb4d8a is embedded as a resource in the HTTP PE server sample with\na name of \"umc.apk\".\n\nUmc.apk defines intent filters to receive events from the Android operating system when the APK is replaced (PACKAGE_REPLACED), when\nthe device receives a text message (SMS_RECEIVED), and when the device is in use by a user (USER_PRESENT). Umc.apk installs an\nembedded APK with the SHA256 value of a984a5ac41446db9592345e547afe7fb0a3d85fcbbbdc46e16be1336f7a54041.\nA984a5ac41446db9592345e547afe7fb0a3d85fcbbbdc46e16be1336f7a54041 has a name of \"install.apk\".\nTh f i t ll k i t l k d i t ll thi d APK ith SHA256 h h f\n\n\n-----\n\n60 08 8dd 5a 3 6 ebed9 0 3060e58c d3 d ea050dcd 9 d 6 a d a a e o object ap\nObject.apk is the final malicious payload.

It shows the internal version number for this APK is\n“4.2.160713” it is unclear if this is an accurate representation of the number of iterations of development undertaken on this malware family, or\nif it is to give the APK an air of legitimacy.\n\nConfiguration information for object.apk is included in the APK as a resource named \"assest.png\". The configuration information can be\ndecoded using the following Python function:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\ndef cnfdecr(s):\nb = ''\nfor each in s:\ntmp = ord(each)\ntmp = tmp - 55\ntmp = tmp ^ 0x12\nb += chr(tmp)\nreturn b\n\n\nThe decoded configuration values and their purposes follow:\n\n**Value** **Purpose**\n\n4 Proxy Count\n\n113.10.170.98 IPv4\n\n443 Port Number\n\n98.101.211.250 IPv4\n\n443 Port Number\n\n173.0.138.250 IPv4\n\n443 Port Number\n\n192.168.1.49 IPv4\n\n443 Port Number\n\n60 Sleep Time\n\n\n-----\n\n5 Max Repetition Count\n\nFollowing our analysis of the payload APK, we were able to locate an additional related APK. The APK with SHA256 hash value of\n06cadaac0710ed1ef262e79c5cf12d8cd463b226d45d0014b2085432cdabb4f3 contains\n800f9ffd063dd2526a4a43b7370a8b04fbb9ffeff9c578aa644c44947d367266, one of the ELF ARM files discussed in a table under the section\ntitled, \"Related ELF ARM Samples\".\n\nThis APK, 06cadaac0710ed1ef262e79c5cf12d8cd463b226d45d0014b2085432cdabb4f3, contains resources which reference legitimate\napplications of varying popularity. We hypothesize the inclusion of these resources are to disguise the application's true intent and to make the\napplication seem legitimate. The inclusion of KaKaoTalk resources leads us to believe this APK is targeting South Koreans. The image below\nshows some of the referenced mobile applications resources:\n\nThe purpose of 06cadaac0710ed1ef262e79c5cf12d8cd463b226d45d0014b2085432cdabb4f3 is to execute the ELF ARM file is contains.\nBelow shows decompiled source code of the \"com.godpeople.GPtong.ETC.SplashActivity\" resource in the APK which contains the main\nfunctionality of the APK. It executes the ELF ARM file named \"while\" and logs activity to the debug log named \"snowflake\".\n\nRelationships to Known Samples\n\nOriginally, the PE server was identified by its binary overlaps with the following samples:\n\n410959e9bfd9fb75e51153dd3b04e24a11d3734d8fb1c11608174946e3aab710\n4cf164497c275ae0f86c28d7847b10f5bd302ba12b995646c32cb53d03b7e6b5\n\nWhen executing, both samples create the mutex \"FwtSqmSession106839323_S-1-5-20\" which has ties to Operation Blockbuster and the\nattacks on the SWIFT banking system. Once this overlap in indicators was identified, and manual investigation began, additional overlaps\nbegan to emerge.\n\n\n-----\n\ndd t o a u ct o a code o e aps a e ou d bet ee t e o o g sa p es a d t e se e\n\n1d195c40169cbdb0f50eca40ebda62321aa05a54137635c7ebb2960690eb1d82\naf71ba26fd77830eea345c638d8c2328830882fd0bd7158e0abc4b32ca0b7b74\n\nThe PE server sample is not the only sample with ties to previously identified malware. Infrastructure reuse also exist between the IPv4\naddresses embedded in ELF ARM files detailed in the previous section and previously identified malware. For example, 175.100.189.174 is\nembedded in 800f9ffd063dd2526a4a43b7370a8b04fbb9ffeff9c578aa644c44947d367266 and is also contacted by\na606716355035d4a1ea0b15f3bee30aad41a2c32df28c2d468eafd18361d60d6, a documented Destover sample.\nAnother example of IPv4 address reuse is 119.29.11.203. This IPv4 address is embedded in the ELF file with SHA256 of\n153db613853fb42357acb91b393d853e2e5fe98b7af5d44ab25131c04af3b0d6 and is also contacted by\n7429a6b6e8518a1ec1d1c37a8786359885f2fd4abde560adaef331ca9deaeefd which is a PE payload delivered by the macros in the following\nmalicious documents:\n\n7576bfd8102371e75526f545630753b52303daf2b41425cd363d6f6f7ce2c0c0\nffdc53425ce42cf1d738fe22016492e1cb8e1bc657833ad6e69721b3c28718b2\nc98e7241693fbcbfedf254f2edc8173af54fcacebb7047eb7646235736dd5b89\n\nThese macros share the same logic as macros discussed by Unit42 in previous reports.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt is clear that source code was reused between previously reported samples and the cluster of new samples outlined by Unit 42. Additionally,\ncommand and control IPv4 addresses were reused by the malware discussed in this analysis. Technical indicators as well as soft indicators,\nsuch as APK themes and names, provide soft and tenable ties to the actors behind Operation Blockbuster and the HiddenCobra group.\nThe image below summarizes all of the relationships presented in this report:\n\nAttribution is difficult to confidently achieve even with an in-depth technical knowledge and large pool of telemetry to hunt through. Without\ntargeting and delivery information this report offers a partial perspective on this new activity targeting Korean speaking Samsung users.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers can review this cluster of newly discovered malware by examining the GoingMobile AutoFocus tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/)\n\nUnit 42, before publication, notified both Samsung and the KrCERT of the activity detailed here. We would like to thank both organizations for\nworking so quickly with us.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA256**\n\n06cadaac0710ed1ef262e79c5cf12d8cd463b226d45d0014b2085432cdabb4f3\n\n0ff83f3b509c0ec7070d33dceb43cef4c529338487cd7e4c6efccf2a8fd7142d\n\n153db613853fb42357acb91b393d853e2e5fe98b7af5d44ab25131c04af3b0d6\n\n1d195c40169cbdb0f50eca40ebda62321aa05a54137635c7ebb2960690eb1d82\n\n2b15e4289a3eb8e4eb8c2343895002dde7f5b2791e3c799b4f869be0aa85d2e8\n\n410959e9bfd9fb75e51153dd3b04e24a11d3734d8fb1c11608174946e3aab710\n\n4607082448dd745af3261ebed97013060e58c1d3241d21ea050dcdf7794df416\n4694895d6cc30a336d125d20065de25246cc273ba8f55b5e56746fddaadb4d8a\n\n4cf164497c275ae0f86c28d7847b10f5bd302ba12b995646c32cb53d03b7e6b5\n\n7429a6b6e8518a1ec1d1c37a8786359885f2fd4abde560adaef331ca9deaeefd\n\n7576bfd8102371e75526f545630753b52303daf2b41425cd363d6f6f7ce2c0c0\n\n790662a047047b0470e2f243e2628d8f1b62794c1359b75ed9b856325e9c961a\n\n\n-----\n\n800 9 d063dd 5 6a a 3b 3 0a8b0 bb9 e 9c5 8aa6 c 9 d36 66\n941cd0662cae55bc06727f1d658aba67f33442e63b03bebe012dad495e9e37dc\na606716355035d4a1ea0b15f3bee30aad41a2c32df28c2d468eafd18361d60d6\na984a5ac41446db9592345e547afe7fb0a3d85fcbbbdc46e16be1336f7a54041\nb183625c006f50f2b64ebe0aebda7b68ae285e53d1b4b00c8f49cde2dfc89348\nc98e7241693fbcbfedf254f2edc8173af54fcacebb7047eb7646235736dd5b89\ncf3e9baaac7efcaff8a9864da9f12b4115ba3f148ae5cfc21f3c158f6182b792\ned9e373a687e42a84252c2c01046824ed699b32add73dcf3569373ac929fd3b9\nffdc53425ce42cf1d738fe22016492e1cb8e1bc657833ad6e69721b3c28718b2\n\n**Mutexes**\nFwtSqmSession106839323_S-1-5-20\n\n**IPv4s**\n\n110.45.145.103\n113.10.170.98\n114.215.130.173\n119.29.11.203\n124.248.228.30\n139.196.55.146\n14.139.200.107\n173.0.138.250\n175.100.189.174\n181.119.19.100\n197.211.212.31\n199.180.148.134\n211.115.205.41\n217.117.4.110\n61.106.2.96\n98.101.211.250\n\n**Domains**\n\nwww.radioapp[.]co[.]kr\n\n**Filenames**\nJAVAC.EXE\njquery50.js\njquery52.js\njquery99.js\nmain.js\numc.apk\nupdate.js\nmboard_ok.css\nnode_n.js\nnode_e.js\nnode_g.js\nnode_p.js\nnode_ok.js\nnode_nc.js\nnode_ex.js\nobject.apk\nInstall.apk\nwhile\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
