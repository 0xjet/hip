The interview, conducted by a Russian cybersecurity\n[researcher and posted on the YouTube channel RussianOSINT, covered the group's prior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQCQ1VZp8s&feature=youtu.be)\nattacks, how it splits its profits, and various tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) the\ngroup uses to conduct its attacks.\n\n[REvil has been one of the most active ransomware gangs in recent memory, claiming](https://intel471.com/blog/changes-in-revil-ransomware-version-2-2/)\n[responsibility for such attacks as those on U.K.-based financial service provider Travelex,](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/02/travelex-malware/)\n[U.S.-based entertainment and media law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks and 23 local](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-data-ransomware-grubman-law-firm-madonna-2020-5)\ngovernments in Texas.\n\nThe representative interviewed told host Sergey RedHunt that the malware was created from\nthe source code of a separate, defunct ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) where core REvil\nmembers previously were affiliates. When that RaaS variant was shut down, the actors\nbehind REvil purchased the source code and developed their own ransomware. He also\nclaimed that REvil has 10 developers that keep it running.\n\nWhile the group carries out attacks on its own, it has found the RaaS model brings back more\nmoney. Affiliates are responsible for gaining access to target networks, downloading valuable\nfiles and deploying the actual ransomware, while the REvil gang handles victim negotiations\nand blackmailing, ransom collection and distribution. This model has apparently led to\nskyrocketing profits: according to the REvil representative, one affiliate's earnings rose from\nabout US $20,000 to US $30,000 per target with another RaaS offering to about US $7\nmillion to $8 million per target in only six months after joining forces with REvil.\n\nOne of the most common ways the group gains access to organizations is through remote\n[desktop protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, such as the BlueGate vulnerability, which allows](https://www.securityweek.com/poc-exploits-created-recently-patched-bluegate-windows-server-flaws)\nremote code execution by an authorized user. The representative admittedly preferred to use\ninformation stealers to obtain remote access credentials, which are then used to secure an\ninitial foothold in company networks. In the case of the Travelex and Grubman Shire\n\n\n-----\n\nMeiselas & Sacks attacks, the representative said networks were compromised by exploiting\n[outdated Citrix and Pulse Secure remote access software, with the actors allegedly gaining](https://www.cyberscoop.com/citrix-vulnerability-backdoor-fireeye/)\naccess to an entire network in \"about three minutes.\"\n\nThe representative claimed that most desirable targets for attacks were agriculture\ncompanies, insurance companies, internet service providers, law firms and manufacturers.\nHe also claimed that most victims pay the ransom to avoid having their data dumped online\nrather than just to decrypt the files. According to the representative, there were only 12 cases\nwhen the gang could not decrypt files, due to them being corrupted by victims looking to\nrecover them by using third-party or antivirus software. The REvil team allegedly did not\ntake ransom payments in these cases.\n\nREvil has also allegedly taken precautions against attempts by cybersecurity researchers or\nlaw enforcement to infiltrate the group or take down its infrastructure. The gang has\nintroduced additional protection measures and vetted new affiliates by asking general\npolitical and social questions related to former Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\ncountries that only native Russian speakers typically could answer. Russian-speaking\ninfiltrators usually were vetted by asking specific technical questions about attack techniques.\nThe gang is also aware that cybersecurity experts and vendors often tried to penetrate the\ngroup's resources, allegedly identifying attempts to exploit cross-site scripting (XSS)\nvulnerabilities. All the attacks allegedly were unsuccessful.\n\n[The interview supports a number of trends Intel 471 has been tracking among prominent](https://intel471.com/blog/revil-ransomware-as-a-service-an-analysis-of-a-ransomware-affiliate-operation/)\nRaaS crews, including affiliate payout structures, the relationship between ransomware\ngangs and information stealers, the growing push to expose private information if ransoms\nare not paid, and other ties to popular forums in the criminal underground.\n\nIntel 471 will soon be releasing a three-part series that examines the impact of gangs like\nREvil amid the onslaught of RaaS-based attacks over the past year. The series will cover the\nexplosion in the affiliate model, the relationship between actors selling access to enterprises\nand how it portends ransomware attacks, and what happens inside businesses when an\nattack occurs.\n\nYou can watch the full interview with the alleged REvil representative below.\n\n\n-----",
