    "plain_text": "# Confucius APT Android Spyware Targets Pakistani and Other South Asian Regions\n\n**[cybleinc.com/2021/02/17/confucius-apt-android-spyware-targets-pakistani-and-other-south-asian-regions](https://cybleinc.com/2021/02/17/confucius-apt-android-spyware-targets-pakistani-and-other-south-asian-regions/)**\n\nTwo Android spyware strains named Hornbill and Sunbird were recently discovered with possible connections\nto the advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Confucius. The group first appeared in 2013 as a hacking\ngroup primarily pursuing Pakistani and other South Asian targets. Confucius has created mainly Windows\nmalware in the past. However, after the spying app ChatSpy came into existence in 2017, the group has also\nextended its mobile malware capabilities.\n\nThe two android malware strains, Hornbill and Sunbird, are embedded inside fake Android applications and\nused as spyware for monitoring and exfiltrating data from the mobile phones of their targets. These fake Android\napplications were used to spy on Pakistan’s military and nuclear authorities, along with election officials from\nKashmir. The counterfeit apps contain advanced capabilities, including capturing photos from the camera,\ncapturing the geolocation, scrap WhatsApp messages and media, and requesting elevated privileges. The data is\nfirst collected in SQLite databases, compressed to ZIP files and uploaded to the hacker’s C2 servers.\n\nCounterfeit applications published by the APT group mimic various genuine-looking applications. The Sunbird\nstrain has been embedded into fake applications with legitimate-looking names such as “Google Security\nFramework,” “Falconry Connect,” “Mania Soccer” and “Quran Majeed.” According to security researchers\nat [Lookout, apps embedded with Sunbird have more extensive malicious capabilities than Hornbill.](https://blog.lookout.com/lookout-discovers-novel-confucius-apt-android-spyware-linked-to-india-pakistan-conflict)\n\nWhile the Hornbill works as a spyware used to extract data of interest from the target device, the Sunbird\nadditionally works as a remote access trojan (RAT), allowing hackers to execute commands on an infected\ndevice. Both malwares can exfiltrate a wide range of data from target devices.\n\nData exfiltrated by Hornbill and Sunbird:\n\nCall logs\nContacts\nDevice metadata including phone number, IMEI/Android ID, Model and Manufacturer, and Android\nversion details\nGeolocation\n\nImages stored on external storage\nWhatsApp voice notes, if installed\n\nActions performed on target devices:\n\n\n-----\n\nRequesting device administrator privileges\nTaking screenshots and capturing whatever a victim is currently viewing on their device\n\nTaking photos with the device camera\nRecording environment and call audio\nScraping WhatsApp messages and contacts via accessibility services\nScraping WhatsApp notifications via accessibility services\n\nThe Sunbird malware consists of certain additional malicious capabilities when compared with Hornbill. The\nadditional data exfiltrated by Sunbird includes:\n\nList of installed applications\nBrowser history\nCalendar information\nBlackBerry Messenger (BBM) audio files, documents, and images\n\nWhatsApp Audio files, documents, databases, voice notes, and images\nContent sent and received via IMO instant messaging application\n\nAdditional actions performed by Sunbird include:\n\nDownload attacker-specified content from FTP shares\nRun arbitrary commands as root, if possible\n\nScrape BBM messages and contacts via accessibility services\nScrape BBM notifications via accessibility services\n\nThe Confucius APT malware campaign involves social engineering tactics for luring unsuspecting targets to\ndownload these applications from direct links. Multiple malicious applications with the Sunbird and Hornbill\nstrains are hosted on third-party app stores. Apps embedded with the Hornbill strain are more passive in\nnature, target a limited set of data, and are used as a reconnaissance tool. The malware only uploads data\nto the C2 server only when it runs for the first time on the infected device. The Hornbill keeps mobile internet\nand battery usage low by only uploading new data from target devices. On the other hand, the\nSunbird strain uploads data in fixed intervals. Hornbill actors seem more interested in monitoring the user’s\nWhatsApp activity, and Hornbill abuses the android accessibility services to detect an active WhatsApp call and\nrecords it.\n\nResearchers believe that the same threat actor is behind both the malware, and neither of these apps were\ndistributed via Google Play or any authorized app stores.\n\n**Possible Targets of the Campaign & exfiltrated data:**\n\nSecurity researchers were able to get access to 18GB of exfiltrated data exposed on insecurely configured C2\nservers of the Sunbird malware. The data also included the location of the infected devices, which helped\nresearchers determine the possible targets of this malware campaign. Some of\nthe targets identified included individuals related to Pakistan Air Force (PAF), Pakistan Atomic Energy\nCommission, and other departments.\n\nChart, pie chart, sunburst chart Description automatically generated\n\nPublicly-accessible exfiltrated content exposed on Sunbird C2 servers for five campaigns during 2018 –\n2019 (Image source: [Lookout Threat Intel)](https://blog.lookout.com/lookout-discovers-novel-confucius-apt-android-spyware-linked-to-india-pakistan-conflict)\n\nThe data exfiltrated by Sunbird included information such as SMS messages, contacts, and call logs uploaded at\nfixed intervals.\n\n**Connection to Confucius APT:**\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to fake Android applications, the Confucius APT group also targets Windows systems. We analyzed a\nConfucius malware sample and observed that the attack kill chain starts with a word document delivered to the\ntarget. The document is crafted in a way that encourages the target to open that document. Once the user opens\nthe document, it uses template injection to download the RTF exploit that downloads the final stage payload.\n\nThe RTF contains a DLL embedded in an OLE object, as shown in the image below.\n\n_DLL Embedded in RTF file_\n\nText Description automatically generated\n\nThe embedded DLL file, bing.dll (SHA256: 8b535452727edf06280c495b190c10eb0a90522fad1c61cae8bfeef9b84a4879) contains an export “mark” is\nresponsible for downloading the payload. The name of the released .dll file is linknew.dll.\n\nThe malware also checks for the presence of a debugger and whether it is being executed in a virtual\nenvironment. The malicious bing.dll connects to “hxxp://mlservices.online/content/upgrade” to download\nthe payload file. A LNK file named update.lnk and pointing to the payload file update.exe is dropped\nto the startup folders – “%AppData%Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup” for adding\npersistence. After dropping the payload, it runs in the background and performs spyware\nactivities similar to Hornbill and Sunbird. We are sharing IOCs related to Confucius windows malware and Fake\nAndroid applications.\n\n**Security Recommendations:**\n\nEnsure anti-virus software and associated files are up-to-date.\nSearch for existing signs of the indicated IOCs in your environment.\nConsider blocking or setting up detection for all URL and IP-based IOCs.\nDownload applications from official app stores such as Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\nAvoid websites providing bootleg Android APKs and iOS APPs.\nKeep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\nExercise caution while opening attachments and links in emails.\nKeep systems fully patched to mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\n\n-----\n\n### SHA-1 Hashes\n\n Hornbill\n\n b6b239ccef57a261a254f5167357dc9096618939\n\n 1f1bab3c5a60275384083ef9e2a5b9fe6c194a35\n\n 704579a14a2ee80c89ad12019e19e50eb27dffea\n\n 3372458b73d3d5c3957a75dfe6cff62c5cd3cd4f\n\n 77867ddb68b68a340ccdb79bd9d46281d5956fa5\n\n c504cef5e0e04b15d21388e6f9cc2c320071d50b\n\n 0cc49097778372fdf1ba2143e31a8f235342f9c9\n\n Sunbird\n\n 9b684cff07f98083bdb085cb846929ebca2c3df1\n\n 2ecb5b88b12ba44cfce2f51df7f16fbd4754aea2\n\n 665d23eda84cd008ccde013bde6a836976bcc4fc\n\n a38931d68b26f04a94241f2155bcbf465b3fa99a\n\n df5188225ab6de0a6e71635e997c4473c02d6527\n\n e01729e5ceb827318e5198a24a12ae6d6bbc4ab3\n\n 8ae67888befb4f01f216d94f07051fc047150ceb\n\n 41268c45dc2453469ea8a0a0c615bdb562d1d9de\n\n a4161cfe2d6146566094ee979ea893cd2fe3ae72\n\n 03d199cff2be8667932933d1bcb6bb58d364545a\n\n fc2929a021ca1e83f0d87ca9c9c85df0057373e5\n\n a6128100cd9c505e12af16a163d4fea35c42808a\n\n 6b75e6df7744a232a350658ad06e9574483a0b8b\n\n be524a5a42b4b3f48f5571311f9be683024b6939\n\n SHA-256 Hashes – Confucius\n\n 8b535452727edf06280c495b190c10eb0a90522fad1c61cae8bfeef9b84a4879\n\n 8ecf1c276e10e3f3e9f7bc9e728fde9abea23348a2af6ce70269008d632a412d\n\n 3ce48f371129a086935b031333387ea73282bda5f22ff78c85ee7f0f5e4625fe\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1c41a03c65108e0d965b250dc9b3388a267909df9f36c3fefffbd26d512a2126\n\n 07277c9f33d0ae873c2be3742669594acc18c7aa93ecadb8b2ce9b870baceb2f\n\n ea52d6358d53fc79e1ab61f64cb77bb47f773f0aa29223b115811e2f339e85f5\n\n 686847b331ace1b93b48528ba50507cbf0f9b59aef5b5f539a7d6f2246135424\n\n 2f5fc653550b0b5d093427263b26892e3468e125686eb41206319c7060212c40\n\n b9b5a9fa0ad7f802899e82e103a6c2c699c09390b1a79ae2b357cacc68f1ca8e\n\n 4500851dad1ac87165fc938fe5034983c10423f800bbc2661741f39e43ab8c8d\n\n a3cd781b14d75de94e5263ce37a572cdf5fe5013ec85ff8daeee3783ff95b073\n\n 59ccfff73bdb8567e7673a57b73f86fc082b0e4eeaa3faf7e92875c35bf4f62c\n\n 59cd62ad204e536b178db3e2ea10b36c782be4aa4849c10eef8484433a524297\n\n\n-----\n\n### Command and Control Infrastructure\n\n Hornbill\n\n pieupdate[.]online\n\n chatk.goldenbirdcoin[.]com\n\n cucuchat[.]com\n\n 184.154.203[.]90\n\n 69.175.35[.]98\n\n samaatv[.]online\n\n tea-time[.]link\n\n Sunbird\n\n data10.000webhostapp[.]com\n\n global134.000webhostapp[.]com\n\n wixten.000webhostapp[.]com\n\n sunshinereal.000webhostapp[.]com\n\n 23.82.19[.]250\n\n Confucius\n\n Mlservices[.]online\n\n msoffice.user-assist[.]site\n\n msoffice.user-assist[.]site\n\n Wordupdate[.]com\n\n http://wordupdate[.]com/refresh/content&nbsp;\n\n http://mlservices[.]online/content/upgrade&nbsp;\n\n http://wordupdate[.]com/recent/update&nbsp;\n\n**About Cyble:**\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from cybercrimes](https://cyble.io/)\nand exposure in the darkweb.
