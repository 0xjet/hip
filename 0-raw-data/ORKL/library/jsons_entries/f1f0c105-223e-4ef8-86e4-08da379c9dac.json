Based on the contents of malicious files used in the attacks, it appears that its\nmain targets are organizations and individuals whose work involves North Korea. These include North\nKorean defectors, human rights activists for North Korea, North Korean researchers, and journalists. In\nsome cases, it has even accessed South Korean military related documents.\n\nRed Eyes group’s main method is to send a document via email or mobile messenger to deliver the\nmalware. Typically, executable files in formats such as .vbs or .exe are inserted in documents. The\ngroup also exploits the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) vulnerability of the Hangul word-processing\nprogram, which is widely used throughout South Korea.\n\nMicrosoft Office documents have also been used in attacks. In October 2017, the group launched an\nattack that exploited Microsoft Word’s Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) feature. In February 2018, Red\nEyes exploited the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). 1 It was later\nrevealed, however, that the first such attack had taken place in November 2017. Then, in March\n2018, Red Eyes launched a targeted mobile malware attack.2\n\nThe activities of Red Eyes were first detected in the fall of 2016, not long after the disappearance of\nan earlier group of hackers that were active from 2015 to the spring of 2016. That earlier group\ncarried out Operation ProgamsByMe in 2015 and is thought to be affiliated with Red Eyes. Red Eyes\nuse a variety of methods and is known to include text strings within their code such as “First,”\n“Happy,” and “Work.”\n\nIn this report, we will take a closer look at the main activities of Red Eyes and another group that\nmay be affiliated with it.\n\n1 http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/group-123-goes-wild.html\n\n2 https://byline.network/2018/03/1-1052/\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n## Overview of the Activities of Red Eyes\n\nHacking attempts have targeted North Korean defectors and human rights activists for North Korea over\nthe course of five years. In one case, a website operated by North Korean defectors was attacked. An\ninvestigation carried out by major domestic and overseas security vendors revealed that some of the\nattacks were the work of a group called Red Eyes.\n\nRed Eyes attack group is also known as Geumseong121, Group 123, ScarCruft, APT37, Reaper, and\nRicochet Chollima. Based on the contents of malicious files used in the attacks, it appears that its main\ntargets are organizations and individuals whose work involves North Korea. These include North Korean\ndefectors, human rights activists for North Korea, North Korean researchers, and journalists. In some\ncases, it has even accessed Korean military related documents.\n\nThe information about the group was first reported by Cisco Talos, a threat intelligence team, in\n2017,3 but Red Eyes received more attention at the end of January 2018, when it launched an attack\nthat exploited the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). 4 Soon after,\ncybersecurity companies released their findings: FireEye released its analysis of the group in\nFebruary,5 and in March, ESTsecurity announced its findings on mobile malware that had been\ndistributed through a mobile messenger.\n\n3 http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/02/korean-maldoc.html\n\n4 http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/group-123-goes-wild.html\n\n5 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/02/apt37-overlooked-north-korean-actor.html\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n### 1. Current Status and Characteristics \n\nMalware with Red Eyes characteristics were discovered repeatedly beginning in the fall of 2016\nthrough the end of 2017. The occurrence of the malware is shown in Figure 1. Most of the malware\ntook the form of document files, droppers, or backdoors.\n\n[Figure 1] Occurrence of Malware from Red Eyes Group (Sept. 2016-Feb. 2018)\n\nOne of the characteristics of malware from this group is that it uses a program database (PDB) text\nstring. Table 1 shows the PDB text strings that were used to gain information about the malware,\nsuch as its version and type.\n\nd:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\2ndBD\\T+M\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb\n\nD:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\First-Dragon(VS2015)\\Sample\\Release\\DogCall.pdb\n\nD:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\VC2008(Version15)\\T+M\\T+M\\TMProject\\Release\\ErasePartition.pdb\n\nE:\\Happy\\Work\\Source\\version 12\\First-Dragon\\Sample\\Release\\DogCall.pdb\n\ne:\\Happy\\Work\\Source\\version 12\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb\n\n[Table 1] PDB Strings in Red Eyes Group Malware\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n### 2. Main Attacks and Methods\n\nRed Eyes spreads malware mainly by sending malicious email attachments to their targets. In March\n2018, it also used mobile messenger texts to send malware.\n\nThey mainly exploit the EPS vulnerability of the Hangul (.hwp) word-processing program, which is\nwidely used in South Korea, or used the method of inserting executable files, such as .vbs or .exe.\nThey also use Microsoft Office documents for attacks. In October 2017, the group launched an attack\nthat exploited Microsoft Word’s DDE feature. Then, in February 2018, it used a Microsoft Office file\nto exploit the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). This method of attack was\nlater identified to have first taken place in November 2017.\n\nRed Eyes group has been active since 2016. Its main attacks are listed in [Table 2].\n\n**Date** **Attack Method** **Document Content**\n\n2016.09 Hangul EPS Academic conference on North Korea\n\n2016.09 Hangul EPS News about North Korea and North Korean defectors\n\n2017.01 Malware inserted in Hangul file New year address of North Korea\n\n2017.01 Hangul EPS Announcement of support for public activities of private\norganization in 2017\n\n2017.02 Hangul EPS Résumés of Korean-Chinese migrants\n\n2017.03 Hangul EPS Political content (malware inserted in the document destroyed\ndata on the hard disk)\n\n2017.03 Hangul EPS Military content\n\n2017.03 Hangul EPS Labor contracts\n\n2017.05 Hangul EPS News on a man who lived 555 days without a heart\n\n2017.10 DDE Confirmation of money transfers and content seemingly related\nto propaganda leaflets or balloons for North Korea\n\n2017.10 Hangul EPS Request for assistance for North Korean defectors\n\n2017.11 Inserted .vbs file Conference on the North Korean Human Rights Act\n\n\n2017.11 Flash file attached to the Excel\nfile\n\n\nCosmetics prices\n\n\n\n[Table 2] Main Attacks by Red Eyes Group\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\nThe group first exploited the EPS vulnerability of the Hangul word program in the fall of 2016. The\nmalicious documents concerned academic conferences and news about North Korea and matters\nrelating to North Korean defectors.\n\nIn January 2017, a Hangul file containing the new year address of North Korea was used in an email\nattachment attack that used the file as loader for in-memory execution of another malware.\n\nA variant of this malware was found in November 2016.\n\n[Figure 2] Occurrence of Malware from Red Eyes Group (Sept. 2016-Feb. 2018)\n\nIn February 2017, a DogCall backdoor was found in a Hangul file disguised as a résumé. The DDEbased attacks took place in late October and November 2017.\n\nIn November 2017, Red Eyes used an attack method where a .vbs file was linked in the body of a\nHangul file concerning a civic organization for human rights in North Korea. (md5:\n7ca1e08fc07166a440576d1af0a15bb1). If the user clicks on the text, an HncModuleUpdate.vbs file\nis executed to perform malicious tasks.\n\nAt the end of January 2018, the Korea National Computer Emergency Response Team (krCERT) within\nthe Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) announced that it had discovered the Adobe Flash Player\nzero-day vulnerability. In fact, however, a similar attack had occurred in November 2017 using a\ndocument on cosmetics prices.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\nThe malicious Hangul document (md5: 44bdeb6c0af7c36a08c64e31ceadc63c) discovered in January\n2017, masquerading as the New Year address of North Korea, had an executable file inserted. Malware\nis executed if the user clicks on the file.\n\nWhen an object is inserted in a Hangul file, it is possible to check the original file path as shown in Figure\n3. This information can provide clues as to who may have developed the malware.\n\n[Figure 3] Path of the Attachment Used in the Hangul Document\n\nC:\\Users\\pad-2\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Hwp (3).exe\n\n\\\\192.168.100.22\\saggazi\\Happy\\Work\\2016.8~\\2016.8.10~\\(University in Korea)\\(Korean\n\nname)2016.8.24\\2017.1.1mail\\Hwp.exe\n\n[Table 3] Path of an Inserted Document\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the original file was attached from a path where the username of the system was\n“pad-2” and the mapped network folder was called \"saggazi.\" The path also included the name of a\nuniversity in South Korea and a name in Korean characters. Based on the presence of Korean characters\nand “saggazi,” a transliteration of a Korean word, it can be assumed that the malware creator is Korean\nor someone who is familiar with the language.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n## Detailed Analysis of Malware\n\nThe malware distributed by Red Eyes group can be divided into four main types as shown in Table 4.\n\n**Category** **Description**\n\nReloader (DocPrint) Loader that executes another malware in-memory\n\nReloaderx Collects system information and downloads additional files\n\nRedoor (DogCall) Uses backdoor function\n\nWiper Destroys data on the hard disk\n\n[Table 4] Main Malware of Red Eyes Group\n\n### 1. Reloader (DocPrint)\n\nThe Reloader (DocPrint) executes another malware in-memory using a wscript.exe file. The actual\nmalware is encrypted and a similar decryption code is found in its variants.\n\n[Figure 4] Main Decryption Code\n\n### 2. Reloaderx\n\nReloaderx (md5: 6Cec7de9d4797895775e2add9d6855ba) is executed in-memory by DocPrint (md5:\n0ff0f3f0722dd122a0f5c3d4c7752675, fc0a9850f7b6a91f7757d64c86cfc141), which was inserted in the\nHangul file disguised as the 2017 New Year address of North Korea.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\nReloaderx collects the following system information and downloads additional malware:\n\nComputer name\n\nUser name\n\nExecution path\n\nBIOS model\n\nVariants of Reloaderx were also discovered in November 2016, and they shared the same C&C server\naddresses as follows:\n\n**MD5** **C&C Server Address**\n\n9cd11aa7872f9cba98264113d3d72893 www.w****ush.co.kr/bbs/data/image/work/webproxy.php\n\n9f1e60e0c794aa3f3bdf8a6645ccabdc www.belasting-telefoon.nl/images/banners/temp/index.php\n\n[Table 5] Reloaderx Malware and Its C&C Server Address\n\n### 3. Redoor (DogCall)\n\nRedoor, also known as DogCall or ROKRAT, was first discovered in February 2017. Redoor is the malware\nexecuted by Reloader that acts as a loader. Until January 2017, Reloader executed Reloaderx, but in\nFebruary of that year it began executing Redoor. It is a commonly used backdoor, and was used as\nrecently as March 2018.\n\n### 4. Wiper \n\nOne kind of malware used by Red Eyes group destroys all data on the hard disk when executed. After\ndestroying the data and rebooting the system, it would display the message “Are you Happy?” as shown\nin Figure 5.\n\n[Figure 5] Message Displayed after Hard Disk Destruction\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n## Possible Association with Other Attack Groups\n\nIn the aforementioned cases involving the Hangul document, we saw that the malware creator’s system\nusername was “pad-2” and that the file path included text strings such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work.”\nThis suggests an association between the Hangul attacks and other attacks that have occurred since 2015.\n\n[Figure 6] Overview of Similarities between Attacks, 2015–2018\n\n### Operation ProgamsByMe (2015) \n\nOperation ProgamsByMe started in July 2015 and continued until April 2016. The characteristic of this\nmalware is that it contained the text string “ProgamsByMe,” which could reflect either a typographical\nerror or an intentional misspelling of “Programs.”\n\nThe attack group that carried out this attack sent email to the targets, either exploiting the vulnerabilities\nof Hangul or disguising the malware as an update for another popular program. In one case, malware\nwas distributed via a specific Active-X installation file.\n\nThis group of hackers attempted to attack an ICT company in May 2015 by disguising malware as a\nsecurity update (malware removal and patch update) for the Hancom Office suite, which includes Hangul\n(md5 : 89c3254aa577d3788f0f402fe6e5a855).\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\nIn January 2016, this group distributed malware (md5: 06ae5d62d56f21cd2676989743b9626c)\npurporting to discuss countermeasures to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, “Truth and\ncountermeasures on North Korea's hydrogen bomb game.hwp”. In February 2016, it used malware (md5:\nd00e3196bc847e63fc4b255e8ab06d1c) disguised as a piracy investigation program of the Korean\nNational Police Agency (md5: f793deeee9dc4235d228e68d27057dcc). In March 2016, the group\nattacked a media organization and additionally installed keyloggers.\n\n**Date** **Attack Target** **Key Points**\n\n2015.07 IT company Attack method not confirmed\n\n2016.01 Unknown Disguised as a Hancom update file\n\n2016.01 Unknown Infection using the file, Truth and countermeasure on North\nKorea's hydrogen bomb game.hwp\n\n2016.02 Unknown Disguised as the software piracy investigation program of the\nKorean Police Agency\n\n2016.04 Unknown Disguised as the Chrome installer and a screen-capture tool\n\n\n2016.03 Media\norganization\n\n\nUnidentified infection method (but an added keylogger was\ndiscovered)\n\n\n\n[Table 6] Main Attacks involving Operation ProgamsByMe\n\nThe malware used in the attacks listed in Table 6 all contain the PDB string “ProgamsByMe.” It also\nincludes text strings such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work,” and include the use of a tilde (~) for the date\nof creation.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\nThe types of malware used by the group behind Operation ProgamsByMe are shown in Table 7.\n\n**PDB Contents** **Function**\n\nBackdoor Backdoor\n\nCppUACSelfElevatrion Dropper (drops additional malware and includes text strings, as\nshown in Figure 7)\n\nFirstUrlMon Downloader\n\nHwpConvert Malicious HWP production tool\n\nInstaller, InstallBD Dropper\n\nManager, Manager_Them Malware control\n\nKeyLogger, OffSM Keylogger\n\nPrivilegeEscalation Elevates privileges\n\nScreenCap Screen capture\n\nSoundRec Recording\n\n[Table 7] Main Malware from the Group behind Operation ProgamsByMe\n\nThe group also used tools such as keylogging, recording, and screen capture tools in the attack to monitor\nattack targets.\n\nIn addition, the code had some interesting features.\n\n- Awkward Korean messages\n\nThe dropper that was created and widely distributed in August 2015 included CppUACSelfElevation.pdb\nin its PDB.\n\nThis dropper (md5: 9ac2ffd3f1cea2e01ed77c2e7b4a29e7) displays an error message which is closer to\nNorth Korean language usage, which sounds awkward to South Koreans.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n[Figure 7] Awkward-Sounding Korean Message (in Gray)\n\n- Tools believed to have been used by the attacker\n\nThere are also programs that seem to be tools internally used by the attacker. The attacker used these\ntools to add malware to the Hangul file (md5: 2f0492f53d348bea993b7ae5983508a6).\n\n[Figure 8] Malicious HWP File Generator\n\n© AhnLab, Inc.

In the program information, the malware creators refer to\nthemselves as the “Team,” as shown in Figure 10.\n\n[Figure 10] The Management Program Used by the Attacker\n\n### Malware Created by the User “Pad-1” (2016)\n\nAs mentioned before, the document distributed in 2017 disguised as the New Year address of North\nKorea (md5: 44bdeb6c0af7c36a08c64e31ceadc63c) came from a person whose system username was\n“pad-2.” However, malware designed from the system where the username was “pad-1” was discovered\nfrom December 2016 to January 2017. This malware included the following PDB: C:\\Users\\pad1\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2015\\Projects\\ConsoleApplication9\\Release\\ConsoleApplication9.pdb.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n[Figure 11] Malware Created in a System with Username pad-1\n\nMalwares created on a system with username “pad-1” can be classified into four types as shown in Table\n8.\n\n**PDB Contents** **Function**\n\nConsoleApplication5 External file loader\n\nConsoleApplication9 Loader with malware\n\nConsoleApplication12 Listen on a specific port\n\nSystem information collection and screen capture (no information on\nNone\nPDB, but created from the same shellcode)\n\n[Table 8] Malware Created by User \"pad-1\"\n\nA variant (md5: f0a5385d0d9f7c546b25a7448ca5b1c9) of ConsoleApplication5.pdb was downloaded in\nDecember 2016 from the address http://www.i***.com/admin/data/bbs/review2/im/jquery_min_1.5.1.js.\nThis web address (i ***.com) is identical to the address used in Red Eyes attacks that took place in\nJanuary and March 2017.\n\nThe attacker distributed malware to manufacturing companies using the filenames jquery_min_1.5.1.js\nand jquery_min_2.2.2.js.\n\n**Sample MD5** **Distribution address**\n\nf0a5385d0d9f7c546b25a7448ca5b1c9 http://www.i**z.com/admin/data/bbs/review2/im/jquery_min_1.5.1.js\n\n8b55d52b12cf319d9785ad8eeeade5ea http://dr-*****s.com/admin/data/banner/jquery_min_1.5.1.js\n\n2fdbb9a500143a2dd3d226a1cc3e45b5 http://dr-*****s.com/admin/data/banner/jquery_min_2.2.2.js\n\n[Table 9] Information on ConsoleApplication5.pdb Variants\n\n© AhnLab, Inc.

By the fall of 2017, nine variants of this malware had been found.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Analysis Report] Red Eyes Hacking Group\n\n## AhnLab’s Response\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and remediates malware of the Red Eyes group under the\nfollowing aliases:\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Agent (2017.02.07.00)\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Backdoor (2015.08.01.00)\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Reloaderx (2016.11.06.00)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Red Eyes group appeared in the fall of 2016 and is now drawing significant attention. The group uses\na variety of methods but can be identified by a code that includes text strings such as “First,” “Happy,”\nand “Work.” Red Eyes may very well be behind Operation ProgamsByMe, which took place in 2015; it is\nlikely that they are at least associated with it either directly or indirectly. Red Eyes appeared right after\nthe disappearance of a group that was active in 2015 through to the spring of 2016.\n\nThis suggests that the activities of Red Eyes in South Korea date back to 2015, and possibly even earlier.\nBecause the hackers seem to have used the same source code but different compilation paths for the\nmalware, we can conclude that there is more than one attacker involved.\n\nCurrently, the Red Eyes group is targeting other countries in addition to South Korea. There is a clear\nneed to continue monitoring its movements.\n\n© AhnLab, Inc.
