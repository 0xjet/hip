None of these apps were\navailable on the official Google Play Store, suggesting they were likely distributed through\n[actor-operated watering holes or third-party app stores. Lookout previously reported on](http://commercial-surveillanceware-operators-latest-to-take-advantage-of-covid-19/?utm_source=BL&utm_medium=BL&utm_campaign=WW-MU-MU-MU-MU-P_NON-SyrianCovidThreat_Blog)\nanother surveillanceware campaign using COVID-19 related lures targeting Libya.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Applications from this surveillance campaign impersonate a variety of applications, with titles_\n_such as “Covid19”, “Telegram Covid_19”, “Android Telegram”, and “Threema Arabic” (an_\n_end-to-end encrypted messaging application), as well as a phone signal booster and_\n_OfficeSuite application. Package names also allude to Syrian targeting, with names such as_\n_“com.syria.tel”, “syria.tel.ctu”, and “com.syriatel.ctu”._\n\n## Syrian connections\n\nLookout researchers found 71 malicious Android applications connected to the same\ncommand-and-control (C2) server. The IP address of the C2 server is located in a block of\naddresses held by Tarassul Internet Service Provider, an ISP owned by – and sharing\nnetwork infrastructure with – the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) (Freedom\nHouse, 2018). STE has a history of hosting infrastructure for the Syrian Electronic Army\n(SEA), a Syrian state-sponsored hacking group. Notably, the C2 servers of [SilverHawk, an](https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-DelRosso-Under-the-SEA.pdf)\nAndroid malware family previously reported on by Lookout researchers, were located on IP\naddresses belonging to STE.\n\nNot all applications in this campaign were completely scrubbed of sensitive information when\nthey were created. A large portion of the malicious applications are SpyNote samples, which\nstore C2 information, along with user inputted names, version numbers, and other\ninformation, in res/values/strings.xml. In the strings.xml files of these applications, 22 APKs\nreference “Allosh”, a name previously used in connection with a known Syrian Electronic\nArmy persona.\n\nPrevious strings appearing in other malware associated with the Syrian Electronic Army\ncontain this name, such as “c:\\users\\allosh hacker\\documents\\visual studio\n[2012\\Projects\\allosh\\allosh\\obj\\Debug\\Windows.pdb” mentioned in reporting by Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/03/maliciously-repackaged-psiphon/)\non the SEA malicious repackaging of the Psiphon 3 circumvention tool, and “c:\\Users\\Allosh\nHacker\\Desktop\\Application\\obj\\Debug\\Clean Application.pdb” from pdb paths discovered in\nbinaries associated with SilverHawk infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screenshot of a strings.xml file, and all unique personas discovered in this campaign._\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army has been active recently, with one of their Twitter accounts\n[claiming responsibility this month for DDoS attacks against Belgian media, as well as](https://twitter.com/Official_SEA7/status/1245805216756150273)\n[defacing PayPal and eBay websites as recently as April 7, 2020.](https://twitter.com/Official_SEA7/status/1247711650376904704)\n\n_Two of the most recent claims by @Official_SEA7, one of the Syrian Electronic Army’s_\n_multiple Twitter accounts which has been active since 2013._\n\nSyrian authorities are known to heavily censor their country’s internet, with Syria ranking\n[174th on Reporters Without Borders 2019 World Press Freedom Index. In addition,](https://rsf.org/en/syria)\naccording to the 2018 Freedom of the Net Report published by Freedom House, an NGO\nwhich conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights,\n“In areas controlled by the government, the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE)\nserves as both an ISP and the telecommunications regulator, providing the government with\n\n\n-----\n\ntight control over the internet Infrastructure. Furthermore, private fixed-line and mobile ISPs\nare required to sign a memorandum of understanding to connect to the international internet\nvia gateways controlled by the Syrian Information Organization (SIO)” (Freedom on the Net\n2018).\n\n_After installation, the original Covid19 application hides its icon and only displays the newly_\n_installed Degree Measure application._\n\nThe newly installed application (com.finger.body.temperature.ap) is a benign prank - a fake\ndigital thermometer that serves as a decoy.

While not always the case, some unique identifiers are similar to the name of\nthe C2 domain, while other times they refer to the title of the application, highlighting another\nlevel of customization of this malware.\n\n## Prevalence of commercial surveillanceware\n\nOf the malicious applications in this campaign, 64 of 71 are SpyNote samples, a well known\ncommercial surveillanceware family. The remainder belong to the SandroRat, AndoServer,\nand SLRat families, of which the latter two have not yet been publicly reported on.\n\nSLRat appears to have gained popularity since its developer first publicized it in May 2016,\nadvertising it as “the Best and Free android remote admin tool”, while AndoServer has not\nyet been seen for sale or mentioned on public forums. Based on samples ingested to date\nhowever, Lookout researchers believe it is also a customizable Android malware that may be\nfor sale, or only known about and used by a smaller group of operators.\n\nGiven Syria’s history of censorship and past mobile and desktop surveillance campaigns, it\nshould come as no surprise that another campaign is active. SilverHawk actors initially\nentered the mobile malware space using the commercial Android surveillanceware\nAndroRat, before customizing it and then developing their own mobile tooling. It is in line with\nknown TTPs that a new commercial or public spy tool might have been adopted and used by\nthis actor as part of new surveillance efforts, and there are likely more to be discovered.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Lookout has been ingesting samples from the AndoServer and SJRat families since 2016,_\n_and has seen a spike in activity towards the end of 2019._\n\n### IOCs (SHA1 hashes of the malicious apps):\n\n1aefc2ebaf1a78f23473ce6275b0b514bbcdfb08\n\n213b7f8c3f26a87b116927143289886742b979a1\n\n321682c8395216b6f71ac1f4a1188040bbddfeb4\n\n8cae26c899440f890a8faca2e63ba42c0195cd3b\n\nccb143b25cedf043a8be46a1f3c3f8a0a3e4c2b2\n\n61ecf4d82246a22dc2d390eca1e20abd6b961083\n\n1e30cc843a32db0296502795781f8064adbceee6\n\na07370617fa695b047359ac345375d05a7135da0\n\n915e3470e5ab85cb1fe565484b15004a19e88da6\n\n3bfa1b4d98c02c43e7b3af9e536dbcd79e0b9197\n\nd14bb8de94e6f6a733b0962c6d0847376286874f\n\n3c5fd8b163b32cde47dd50c4b61ab087c0cad8d4\n\n4dcc2d9ef4921b3eb4e4dc72dd3716520d558102\n\n07c1edf35c60ea6f2ff02df6e0bfa24abb3029c1\n\n50c607a138e33c8cbdcf2f617f61095b7efa06da\n\nb1a9bc32ece469d7e2d43e894e68cb3bec17ac82\n\n34cb80d4e5d19fcaf724b73aacfebbb19c79337e\n\nc21919c6064c739533878da39d0feaf83e99f586\n\na62250430da13436b80a62f6a1fee67ed0050e37\n\n246a17230dbe8a5c533231fa1da80d977985b111\n\n358653280acdfd84b6ca326c9b06d12878af69c8\n\n4ec39acfc6f3f9715d0d0e2b0a2f7121d617b605\n\n9f09a4868f61d174ad075e5acaa8d849294dbf69\n\n\n-----\n\n8952bdf2e3d777d01011e6f8619fca8835e8c434\nb9dffff37efbfb8e577ee242c8807db967704a0d\n5f6019eae4a16abd11d981b2da5d4ef05115a5c4\n0b7cf990bb0dc62dd44d9fa6410ca591dfe47a5d\n08162ad39a6237e4eebacf764a5ca6158816a86e\nf2fb9826da43f92ff69686f999f205502a33342c\nc2e5287433a0e3c7d059494e65b87c3c36f74a47\nc7405d85a78a62003494f398084cff8f1794e2ab\n16c9ef6ed5af0855a3e6b963ff9c2d65d70de11e\nbae5c56d3cd888ec19c42bf5d782de327d012a37\n34cc91ad64f52420b6e1531c097ac1602af1f089\n00455a4652faf751753b5ebfbb0656bee530f4ef\nb263eec151b11d0a6ebcfcf37b3b98458d2d530c\n18cc448d71437e7a72558f6680ff10fb234fc64f\n6a68f8d962adae7d767b6dfeb2d5b90be412b1f1\n0fdc50226a7eb9aee6e6422907425d4531290374\naa43f78a2667909546c3cd993a2940b076634379\n5b2e709dfc95e9fc4e4343b92c76cc2193acd49a\ne6962b122e14e59c7c88a25d405d6c653b31590e\n9c83fdecc8429bc278d03116ca9e2cff5013987e\n53653984310845988103051e7acf4ed336150b99\n18451fc0e8fbe878f242e7ee1834091c455f8fc1\n0f7bf07352b4d1852f651dda350fd446b3477740\n615863ce030f3de3e377352637d6ecc55dfd185a\nb46b241620a4d5682e9083ce726827fdbf4a96e5\nab259f11163ea51767a6b17855bc0e79a8ae96e4\n447165f88f951f8d26bc721f3047533a54f59ce0\n29e04da270da0a6bedfcaee3f6fe8251d6cdef31\n6cebf3c27fb348272b72041451b232f78190f83d\ne99ebc998ab63026b9b40fff55037c1b69a80369\nddf2b474a0ed1b47278d00872a84d2a2405cc33c\n01963c9c70102961cb8b424f623e9be32d7b255b\n8d664c9753f7bf65a8cce69dca5486971d1f06ca\n2d01b7691ce5647e60c566eda33166bf2e9bcc53\n44d8bc4406227aeec9711b74f771c05ddfd3d173\n0c04da70ba0771734f99eba05a5676713675d0e8\n37e11e1a45f166b16170e8d649c3b75ee93e90a8\ndbfbfe43f04c58bcf5daa71df61dcc354bbf2d27\ndc3778ffb7399e009a287983f0113e15fd8b227e\n1a0a65e6b4a2c42e5dc3d7db2179c04952a03948\n\n\n-----\n\n69f475024e006b51f7ec6a1990bad460fe9805f0\na32900a79d459da90e49ee8acf23dcfd03bfcb4b\n5c8bf130f8e5c7756674a6d376dd7f25fbded4e4\n\nLookout researchers have uncovered a long-running surveillance campaign tied to Syrian\nnation-state actors, which recently started using the novel coronavirus as its newest lure to\nentice its targets to download malware.\n\nThis campaign appears to have been active since the start of January 2018, and targets\nArabic-speaking users, likely in Syria and the surrounding region.

It is in line with\nknown TTPs that a new commercial or public spy tool might have been adopted and used by\nthis actor as part of new surveillance efforts, and there are likely more to be discovered.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Lookout has been ingesting samples from the AndoServer and SJRat families since 2016,_\n_and has seen a spike in activity towards the end of 2019._\n\n### IOCs (SHA1 hashes of the malicious apps):\n\n1aefc2ebaf1a78f23473ce6275b0b514bbcdfb08\n\n213b7f8c3f26a87b116927143289886742b979a1\n\n321682c8395216b6f71ac1f4a1188040bbddfeb4\n\n8cae26c899440f890a8faca2e63ba42c0195cd3b\n\nccb143b25cedf043a8be46a1f3c3f8a0a3e4c2b2\n\n61ecf4d82246a22dc2d390eca1e20abd6b961083\n\n1e30cc843a32db0296502795781f8064adbceee6\n\na07370617fa695b047359ac345375d05a7135da0\n\n915e3470e5ab85cb1fe565484b15004a19e88da6\n\n3bfa1b4d98c02c43e7b3af9e536dbcd79e0b9197\n\nd14bb8de94e6f6a733b0962c6d0847376286874f\n\n3c5fd8b163b32cde47dd50c4b61ab087c0cad8d4\n\n4dcc2d9ef4921b3eb4e4dc72dd3716520d558102\n\n07c1edf35c60ea6f2ff02df6e0bfa24abb3029c1\n\n50c607a138e33c8cbdcf2f617f61095b7efa06da\n\nb1a9bc32ece469d7e2d43e894e68cb3bec17ac82\n\n34cb80d4e5d19fcaf724b73aacfebbb19c79337e\n\nc21919c6064c739533878da39d0feaf83e99f586\n\na62250430da13436b80a62f6a1fee67ed0050e37\n\n246a17230dbe8a5c533231fa1da80d977985b111\n\n358653280acdfd84b6ca326c9b06d12878af69c8\n\n4ec39acfc6f3f9715d0d0e2b0a2f7121d617b605\n\n9f09a4868f61d174ad075e5acaa8d849294dbf69\n\n\n-----\n\n8952bdf2e3d777d01011e6f8619fca8835e8c434\nb9dffff37efbfb8e577ee242c8807db967704a0d\n5f6019eae4a16abd11d981b2da5d4ef05115a5c4\n0b7cf990bb0dc62dd44d9fa6410ca591dfe47a5d\n08162ad39a6237e4eebacf764a5ca6158816a86e\nf2fb9826da43f92ff69686f999f205502a33342c\nc2e5287433a0e3c7d059494e65b87c3c36f74a47\nc7405d85a78a62003494f398084cff8f1794e2ab\n16c9ef6ed5af0855a3e6b963ff9c2d65d70de11e\nbae5c56d3cd888ec19c42bf5d782de327d012a37\n34cc91ad64f52420b6e1531c097ac1602af1f089\n00455a4652faf751753b5ebfbb0656bee530f4ef\nb263eec151b11d0a6ebcfcf37b3b98458d2d530c\n18cc448d71437e7a72558f6680ff10fb234fc64f\n6a68f8d962adae7d767b6dfeb2d5b90be412b1f1\n0fdc50226a7eb9aee6e6422907425d4531290374\naa43f78a2667909546c3cd993a2940b076634379\n5b2e709dfc95e9fc4e4343b92c76cc2193acd49a\ne6962b122e14e59c7c88a25d405d6c653b31590e\n9c83fdecc8429bc278d03116ca9e2cff5013987e\n53653984310845988103051e7acf4ed336150b99\n18451fc0e8fbe878f242e7ee1834091c455f8fc1\n0f7bf07352b4d1852f651dda350fd446b3477740\n615863ce030f3de3e377352637d6ecc55dfd185a\nb46b241620a4d5682e9083ce726827fdbf4a96e5\nab259f11163ea51767a6b17855bc0e79a8ae96e4\n447165f88f951f8d26bc721f3047533a54f59ce0\n29e04da270da0a6bedfcaee3f6fe8251d6cdef31\n6cebf3c27fb348272b72041451b232f78190f83d\ne99ebc998ab63026b9b40fff55037c1b69a80369\nddf2b474a0ed1b47278d00872a84d2a2405cc33c\n01963c9c70102961cb8b424f623e9be32d7b255b\n8d664c9753f7bf65a8cce69dca5486971d1f06ca\n2d01b7691ce5647e60c566eda33166bf2e9bcc53\n44d8bc4406227aeec9711b74f771c05ddfd3d173\n0c04da70ba0771734f99eba05a5676713675d0e8\n37e11e1a45f166b16170e8d649c3b75ee93e90a8\ndbfbfe43f04c58bcf5daa71df61dcc354bbf2d27\ndc3778ffb7399e009a287983f0113e15fd8b227e\n1a0a65e6b4a2c42e5dc3d7db2179c04952a03948\n\n\n-----\n\n69f475024e006b51f7ec6a1990bad460fe9805f0\na32900a79d459da90e49ee8acf23dcfd03bfcb4b\n5c8bf130f8e5c7756674a6d376dd7f25fbded4e4\n\nApril 15, 2020\n\nDownload Case Study\n**{{consumer=\"/components/cta/consumer\"}}**\n\nTAGS:\n\n|\n\n[Threat Intelligence](https://blog.lookout.com/tag/threat-intelligence)\n\n\n-----",
