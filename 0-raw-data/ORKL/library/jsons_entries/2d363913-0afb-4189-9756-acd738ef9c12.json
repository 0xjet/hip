The bot begins execution by unraveling code encrypted](https://blog.avast.com/2013/05/29/analysis-of-a-self-debugging-sirefef-cryptor/)\nwith RC4 within Thread Local Storage (TLS) callback functions. To find the starting location of\nthe decrypted code, it searches for the PUSH EBP assembly instruction, which is 0x55.\n\nThis is a smart approach as most reverse engineers will place a software breakpoint at this\nlocation to begin executing the decrypted code. However, whenever a software breakpoint is\nplaced, the instruction is actually replaced with an INT3 (0xCC), and therefore the malware\nwouldn’t continue to execute as intended. Pretty slick.\n\n\n-----\n\nSolarbot looking for “PUSH EBP” (0x55)\n\nIt’s currently undetermined how the bot spreads, but researchers at ESET believe it’s likely\nspread through Facebook, based on its ability to steal login credentials.\n\nIn addition, the bot’s creator had been publicly advertising the malware on the web, before the\nsite was taken down just recently. The bot supports multiple plugins (must be written in Delphi),\nand even makes some references to TOR configuration files.\n\nTOR has seen a lot of publicity lately, after a sudden surge in traffic occured earlier this month,\n[believed to be caused by the Mevade/SBC botnet. Perhaps we will see even more malware use](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/whats-in-the-news/2013/09/sbc-botnet-to-blame-for-tor-traffic-surge/)\nTOR to route traffic to C2 servers in the coming future.\n\nWe’ll continue to keep you updated with any unique findings on the solarbot malware. As a\nclosing note, users of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware are protected from known solarbot variants,\ndetected as Malware.Packer.SB.\n\n\n-----\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[Joshua Cannell is a Malware Intelligence Analyst at Malwarebytes where he performs research](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/author/jcannell/)\nand in-depth analysis on current malware threats.
