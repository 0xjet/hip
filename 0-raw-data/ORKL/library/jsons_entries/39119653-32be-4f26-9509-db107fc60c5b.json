The threat actor is purporting to be entities associated with the Netflix global\nphenomenon using emails enticing targets to get early access to a new season of Squid Game or to\nbecome a part of the TV show casting.\n\nOn October 27, 2021, Proofpoint observed thousands of emails targeting all industries primarily in the\nUnited States. The emails used subjects such as:\n\nSquid Game is back, watch new season before anyone else.\nInvite for Customer to access the new sesason. [sic]\nSquid game new season commercials casting preview\nSquid game scheduled season commercials talent cast schedule\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Netflix Squid Game email lure inviting customers to get early access to a new season_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Netflix Squid Game email lure soliciting actors and background talent to apply to be on the_\n_show or show commercials_\n\nThe emails tell the victim to fill out either an attached document to get early access to the new season\nof the show or a talent form to become part of the background casting. The attachments are Excel\ndocuments with macros that, if enabled, will download the Dridex banking trojan affiliate id “22203”\nfrom Discord URLs. Dridex is a prolific banking trojan distributed by multiple affiliates that can lead to\ndata theft and installation of follow-on malware such as ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: One of the several Excel attachment lures observed in this campaign_\n\nTA575 is a Dridex affiliate tracked by Proofpoint since late 2020. This group distributes malware via\nmalicious URLs, Microsoft Office attachments, and password-protected files. On average, TA575\nsends thousands of emails per campaign impacting hundreds of organizations. TA575 also uses the\nDiscord content delivery network (CDN) to host and distribute Dridex. Discord, a communications\nplatform with consumer and enterprise uses, is an increasingly popular malware hosting service for\ncybercriminals.\n\nTA575 themes generally include invoicing and payments, but occasionally include popular news,\nevents, and cultural references. Cybercriminal threat actors in general have pounced on Squid Game\n[as a popular lure and malware theme. This makes sense; as Squid Game is Netflix’s “biggest ever”](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/you-definitely-dont-want-to-play-squid-game-themed-malware-is-here/)\nseries, the pool of potential victims who would inadvertently interact with malicious content associated\nwith it is higher than a general lure theme. TA575 is betting the invitation to be part of the upcoming\nseason will entice more users to interact with the malicious Microsoft Excel file.\n\nProofpoint observed the following indicators of compromise:\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n\n85d2fe6405aac0816f7286bc26174151ae69a08210aec78fea5628862489d8ac Dridex SHA256\n\n149[.]202[.]179[.]100:443 Dridex C2\n\n66[.]147[.]235[.]11:6891 Dridex C2\n\n\n-----\n\n81[.]0[.]236[.]89:13786 Dridex C2\n\n\nhxxps[:]//cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/\n\nattachments/902882967184113677/902908322359959602/xEljRErMuphgnb[.]dll\n\nhxxps[:]//cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/\n\nattachments/902882967184113677/902903501724725280/TgrWe[.]dll\n\nhxxps[:]//cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/\n\nattachments/902882967184113677/902907845887012875/nmQxwiMDXToNFO[.]dll\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\nExcel Payload\n\nExcel Payload\n\nExcel Payload\n\n\n-----",
