    "plain_text": "# A wolf in sheep's clothing: Actors spread malware by leveraging trust in Amnesty International and fear of Pegasus\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/fakeantipegasusamnesty.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/fakeantipegasusamnesty.html)**\n\nBy [Vitor Ventura and](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/_vventura&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1632925718021000&usg=AOvVaw3eVxDYOmRt7BHCQH2PkSjC) [Arnaud Zobec.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/AZobec&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1632925718021000&usg=AOvVaw3H-twgpiIhkQAKnVz_NPiC)\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors are impersonating the group Amnesty International and promising to protect\nagainst the Pegasus spyware as part of a scheme to deliver malware.\n\nAmnesty International recently made international headlines when it released a\ngroundbreaking report on the widespread use of Pegasus to target international journalists\nand activists.\n\nAdversaries have set up a phony website that looks like Amnesty International's — a human\nrights-focused non-governmental organization — and points to a promised anti-virus tool to\nprotect against the NSO Group's Pegasus tool. However, the download actually installs the\nlittle-known Sarwent malware.\n\nSarwent contains the usual abilities of a remote access tool (RAT) — mainly serving as a\nbackdoor on the victim machine — and can also activate the remote desktop protocol on the\nvictim machine, potentially allowing the adversary to access the desktop directly. We believe\nthis campaign has the potential to infect many users given the recent spotlight on the\nPegasus spyware. In addition to Amnesty International's report, Apple also had to recently\nrelease a security update for iOS that patched a vulnerability attackers were exploiting to\ninstall Pegasus. Many users may be searching for protection against this threat at this time.\n\nThe malicious software being deployed is not a standard information stealer that, once\nexecuted, steals credentials and exfiltrates them immediately. In this case, Sarwent has a\nlook and feel that could easily be recognized as a regular anti-virus program. It provides the\nattacker with the means to upload and execute any other malicious tools. Likewise, it can\nexfiltrate any kind of data from the victim's computer.\n\nThe campaign targets people who might be concerned that they are targeted by the Pegasus\nspyware. This targeting raises issues of possible state involvement, but there is insufficient\ninformation available to Talos to make any determination on which state or nation. It is\npossible that this is simply a financially motivated actor looking to leverage headlines to gain\nnew access.\n\n## The campaign\n\nCisco Talos recently discovered this actor building a site that has almost the identical look\nand feel of Amnesty International's legitimate site. The original site has a white background\nbehind the menu, but as you can see below, the fake site has a transparent background.\n\n\n-----\n\nFake Amnesty International website.\n\nThe attacker-controlled homepage advertises the \"Amnesty Anti Pegasus\" software, which\nthe actor is calling \"AVPegasus.\"\n\nHome page of the fake Amnesty International website advertising Anti-Pegasus AV\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, this alleged anti-virus software is actually a known remote access tool (RAT) called\nSarwent.\n\nFake AntiPegasus software User interface\n\nAs the screenshot above shows, even during the execution of the malware, the actor went to\nsome length to trick the victim into believing that it was a legitimate anti-virus. This denotes a\ncertain level of commitment on the actor's part that goes beyond the simple dropping of a\nRAT.\n\nIt is clear the actor is attempting to deceive concerned users into downloading and installing\nthe fake anti-virus. However, we haven't yet seen a malicious advertisement or phishing\ncampaign to promote the fake, and have no information currently on how the actor intends to\nattract targets to the fraudulent website they are using to distribute the malware.\n\n## Victimology\n\nAn analysis on the domains involved in this campaign shows that the initial domains are\nbeing accessed worldwide, without search engine matches or email telemetry that indicates\n\n\n-----\n\na widespread email campaign. The initial lure domains are seen globally, but have a low\nvolume when compared to other large-scale campaigns.\n\nInitial lure domains accesses world wide distribution\n\nLooking at the C2 domains' volume, we can see a much narrower distribution country wise,\nwith an even lower volume. In the case of the C2 active during our investigation, the\ncountries affected are the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, India, Ukraine, Czec\nRepublic, Romania and Colombia, as can be seen on the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nSarwent command and control web panel.\n\n## Threat actor\n\nCisco Talos believes with high confidence that the actor in this case is a Russian speaker\nlocated in Russia and has been running Sarwent-based attacks since at least January 2021,\ncovering a variety of victim profiles.\n\nIn previous campaigns, Talos found victims in several countries including, but not limited to,\nColombia, India, the United States and Germany. We were however unable to identify the\nkind of lures used in the previous campaigns.\n\nTalos assesses with moderate confidence that this actor has been using the Sarwent\nmalware or another one with a similar backend, since 2014, which makes this malware much\nolder than originally expected. The other possibility is that the threat actor has been using\nmalware previously used by another actor.\n\nGiven the available data, we remain uncertain about the intentions of the actor. The use of\nAmnesty International's name, an organization whose work often puts it at odds with\ngovernments around the world, as well as the Pegasus brand, a malware that has been used\nto target dissidents and journalists on behalf of governments, certainly raises concerns about\nwho exactly is being targeted and why. However our investigation has not found any other\nsupporting data to make clear whether this is a financially motivated actor using headlines to\ngain new access, or a state supported actor going after targets who are rightfully concerned\nabout the threat Pegasus presents to them.\n\n## Malware\n\nThis malware in its current Delphi version is not seen very often in the wild. It has several\nmeans of executing remote tasks, including remote desktop protocol (RDP) and Virtual\nNetwork Computing (VNC), despite the malware having shell and PowerShell execution\ncapabilities.\n\nOnce the malware is executed, it contacts the domain medicalsystemworld[.]site. Then, it\nattempts to download another copy of itself if it needs to update later.\n\nAfter that, the malware will perform the regular beacon activity to the command and control\n(C2) site, which is hosted on the same domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 communication traffic\n\nDuring the first communication, the malware exfiltrates some information about the victim,\nincluding the operating system version, whether anti-virus software is installed and the\nsystem architecture. After that, the adversary can issue commands via the command line or\nPowerShell or access the desktop remotely via VNC or RDP.\n\nThe level of customization present in the fake anti-virus indicates that it is likely the operator\nhas access to the source code of the Sarwent malware, and that they are not using a typical\nbuilder service. This level of familiarity also supports our earlier finding that the actor had\nbeen using the Sarwent malware since as early as 2014. This access is especially\ninteresting given that we were unable to find anyone selling access or builders for this\nmalware.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe domains amnestyinternationalantipegasus[.]com, amnestyvspegasus[.]com and\nantipegasusamnesty[.]com were used to lure victims into downloading the malware. Records\nshow that these domains were registered on Sept. 2, 2021 and the first two hosted on the\nsame IP address. In fact, at the time of this investigation the second domain we mentioned\nabove even has a download button that points to the first.\n\nAll but two of the domains associated with this campaign have their contact information\nanonymized. Amnestyinternationalantipegasus[.]com is registered under the name \"Evgen\nTarasevich '' with the email vitapruneaummi51@gmail[.]com, antipegasusamnesty[.]com\nhowever is registered under the name Vladislav Syhomlin with the email address\nvladmakop@rambler[.]ru in both cases the domains have addresses in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nOur current, low-confidence, assessment is that these operational security errors were\nintentional and intended to distract and mislead investigators.\n\nDuring execution, the malware contacts two different hostnames, one of which we already\nestablished as being the C2. The second domain is alwaysstriveandprosper[.]space — this\n\n\n-----\n\ndomain is not currently active. However, it is resolving to the same IP address as the first C2\nso this might be a backup domain in case the first one is taken down. A quick Google search\nshowed that the description of the site used to be the same has the current C2.\n\nHeading of a second disabled C2\n\nThe page name shown in the screenshot above translates to \"Authorization\" in Russian.\nTherefore, we believe it was most likely an old C2 that was in place. The domain\nmementomoriforlife[.]ru was registered two days later and had passive DNS that shows it\nhas been pointing to the same two IP addresses we found linked to this campaign. Talos has\nblocklisted both of these IPs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt first glance, it may seem like an actor trying to gather some easy-to-monetize information.\nHowever, there are aspects of this, such as the level of customization with the RAT,\ninformation that appears to be intentionally misleading and the low volume of targets, that\nindicate this may be a more advanced actor without a financial motivation.\n\nThis is just the latest example of a threat actor trying to capitalize on people's concerns for\ntheir safety and recent headlines. Pegasus has been in the news recently, just as COVID-19\nhas been for a months, a common lure theme for attackers. Adversaries have also used\n[international summits,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/navrat.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1632925718035000&usg=AOvVaw0UNYpfqVW-idjhrpB5mWkR) [elections and more to try to lure victims in and steal their information](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/11/political-malware.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1632925718036000&usg=AOvVaw3gIgxUAzJ6IIefB7mI496d)\nor spread malware.
