REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nUnknown hackers infected the computers of some Apple workers when they visited a\nwebsite for software developers that had been infected with malicious software. The malware\nhad been designed to attack Mac computers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same software, which infected Macs by exploiting a flaw in a version of Oracle Corp s\nJava software used as a plug-in on Web browsers, was used to launch attacks against\nFacebook, which the social network disclosed on Friday.\n\nThe malware was also employed in attacks against Mac computers used by “other\ncompanies,” Apple said, without elaborating on the scale of the assault.\n\nTwitter, which disclosed that it had been breached February 1 and that hackers might gave\naccessed some information on about 250,000 users, was hit in the same campaign,\naccording to a person close to the investigation.\n\nAnother person briefed on the case said that hundreds of companies, including defense\ncontractors, had been infected with the same malicious software. Though this person said\nthat the malware could have originated from China, there was no proof.\n\n“This is a new campaign. It’s not like the other ones you read about where everyone can tell\nit’s China,” the first person said.\n\nInvestigations into the breaches are ongoing. It was not immediately clear when the attacks\nhad begun, the extent to which the hackers had succeeded in stealing data from targeted\nsystems, or whether all infected machines have been identified.\n\nThe malware was distributed at least in part through a site aimed at iPhone developers,\nwhich might still be infecting visitors who haven’t disabled Java in their browser, the person\nclose to the case said. There is a version that infects computers running Microsoft Windows\nas well.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSecurity firm F-Secure wrote that the attackers might have been trying to get access to the\ncode for apps on smartphones, seeking a way to infect millions of end-users. It urged\ndevelopers to check their source code for unintended changes.\n\nApple disclosed the breach as tensions are heating up over U.S. allegations that the Chinese\nmilitary engages in cyber espionage on U.S. companies.\n\nU.S. cyber security firm Mandiant reported over the weekend that it has uncovered evidence\nthat the Chinese military is behind a slew of cyber attacks on U.S. businesses. The White\nHouse said it has repeatedly raised concerns about Chinese cyber theft with Beijing.\n\nThe breaches described by Apple mark the highest-profile cyber attacks to date on\nbusinesses running Mac computers. Hackers have traditionally focused on attacking\nmachines running the Windows operating system, though they have gradually turned their\nattention to Apple products over the past couple of years as the company gained market\nshare over Microsoft Corp.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is the first really big attack on Macs, said the source, who declined to be identified\nbecause the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. “Apple has more on its\nhands than the attack on itself.”\n\nCharlie Miller, a prominent expert on Apple security who is co-author of the Mac Hacker’s\nHandbook, said the attacks show that criminal hackers are investing more time studying the\nMac OS X operating system so they can attack Apple computers.\n\nFor example, he noted, hackers recently figured out a fairly sophisticated way to attack Macs\nby exploiting a flaw in Adobe Systems Inc’s Flash software.\n\n“The only thing that was making it safe before is that nobody bothered to attack it. That goes\naway if somebody bothers to attack it,” Miller said.\n\n## NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nCyber security attacks have been on the rise. In last week’s State of the Union address, U.S.\nPresident Barack Obama issued an executive order seeking better protection of the country’s\ncritical infrastructure from cyber attacks.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday that the Obama\nadministration has repeatedly taken up its concerns about Chinese cyber theft with Beijing,\nincluding the country’s military. There was no indication as to whether the group described by\nMandiant was involved in the attacks described by Apple and Facebook.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to specify how many companies had been breached in the\ncampaign targeting Macs, saying he could not elaborate further on the statement it provided.\n\n“Apple has identified malware which infected a limited number of Mac systems through a\nvulnerability in the Java plug-in for browsers. The malware was employed in an attack\nagainst Apple and other companies, and was spread through a website for software\ndevelopers,” the statement said.\n\n“We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them\nfrom our network. There is no evidence that any data left Apple,” it continued.\n\nThe statement said Apple was working closely with law enforcement to find the culprits, but\nthe spokesman would not elaborate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to\ncomment.\n\nApple said it plans to release a piece of software on Tuesday that customers can use to\nidentify and repair Macs infected with the malware used in the attacks.\n\nEditing by Andre Grenon, Edwin Chan and Richard Chang\n\n[Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
