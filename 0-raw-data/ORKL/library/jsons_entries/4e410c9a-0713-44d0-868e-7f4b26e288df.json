Unfortunately, Android users can fall prey to malware attacks\nusing the COVID-19 cover, especially if they sideload apps by circumventing the installation\nprocess through the official Play Store.\n\nUsers are always facing risks when using technology, especially when it’s connected to the\nInternet. One of the ways to increase your possible exposure to Android malware is to\ninstall apps outside of regular vendor-endorsed channels..\n\nAnd what better way to get people’s attention than by using an app that’s simply called\n“About Koronavirus.” Users with a voracious appetite consume everything that’s\ncoronavirus-related, and in this case, the app would lock the screen of the phone,\nprompting people to pay for a code to return the control of their device.\n\nWhile it’s not as damaging as ransomware, the average user will have a hard time\ndistinguishing between threats, as the result is the same, and that’s getting locked out of\nyour device.\n\n**Sideloading is dangerous**\n\n\n-----\n\nPeople should generally be wary of installing applications from sources outside of official\necosystems, like the Play Store. It’s a sure way of compromising a phone, whether it’s\nthrough malware designed to lock the phone or to steal personal or financial information.\n\nBitdefender telemetry picked up a malware variation of a SLocker – a consecrated piece of\nmalware that locks the user out. The phone itself and the data are not affected, but the\nphone becomes unusable, as the home screen is no longer accessible. It’s not a terribly\nclever piece of software – and it could’nt be much more, given how Android is built –, and\nthere are ways to remove it even after it became active.\n\nThe app is called “Koronavirus haqida”, which translates into “About Coronavirus.” The\npackage name is “com.lololo” (MD5: 476b68a650223780ec73f804e639b7ce) and after the\nuser installs the application and runs it, the screen is locked and displays a simple\nransomware message, in the Uzbek language.\n\nTo make the threat even more convincing, the attacker says that you can only pay within 20\nminutes, after which the phone won’t be usable. The good news is that the time limit is\nfalse, as there’s nothing like that implemented in the code. The bad news is that the phone\nis genuinely locked, which means that none of the buttons will work, and it survives a\nsystem reboot.\n\nDepending on the Android version, the SLocker will behave differently, depending on the\nlevel of access permitted by the OS. Newer Android versions, from 8.0 and upwards, won’t\nallow the app to lock the buttons, but users still can’t delete the app normally.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is the rough translation:\n```\nCongratulations!\nYour phone is blocked! You have 20 minutes to enter the code, otherwise the\nphone will not turn on again …\nDon't see this as an arbitrary message, it will be difficult for you 🙁\nUnlock password\nExact time\nTo unlock the code, call +998 998 910 312 Make 8000 paynet and get the\ncode. (Don't ask for the code without Paynet, I won't tell you anyway)\n\n```\nIf the user enters the wrong code, a simple message is displayed: “Avval paynet, keyin kod\n😅“ that translates to “First paynet then code.”\n\nAnd here comes the strange part, as the code expected by the app is actually the phone\nnumber, 998 998 910 312, without the “+” sign. It’s hardcoded into the app, so it’s the same\none for anyone foolish enough to install the malware.\n\nJust unlocking the phone by entering the right code doesn’t remove the application. It will\ncontinue to run in the memory until it’s removed. If the user kills the app from memory and\nreruns it, the phone will be locked once more.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou will also notice a checkbox, with the text Nimaga telefon blocklandi?, translating to\n“Why is the phone blocked?”. When the checkbox is selected, the following message is\nshown: “You have installed something prohibited from the internet on your phone. If you do\nnot PayNet within the specified time, your phone will not light up again. ☎ Get the code by\ndialing + 998 99 891 03 12 for 8000 PayNet sum! “, 0”.\n\n**Lessons to be learned**\n\nOnce the user runs the malware and locks the phone, it can only be removed via the\nAndroid Debug Bridge (adb) or Safe Mode. If the correct code is entered and the screen\nunlocked, the app can be removed from the OS as well, through the usual methods.\n\nThe malware is not as aggressive as others, but the fact that’s trying to make use of the\ncoronavirus scare is likely to help it get more traction.\n\nWhat’s equally interesting about this SLocker malware is the fact that it’s not entirely\noriginal. In fact, it’s most likely a copy of some older versions; it was just adapted to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen we look closer at the file structure, we see there’s an image in “\\res\\drawable\\”\nnamed “image_1.png” that has a message in Russian, and not in Uzbek. The likely\nexplanation is that it’s leftover from the previous versions of the screen locker.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe translation you were blocked for cheating.\n\nIn the past few months, the malware was reported in Ukraine, Russia, numerous countries\nin Central Asia, including Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and parts of India and North\nAfrica.\n\nVarious samples with the same package name (Virus or ELOSTORA VIRUS labels), have\nbeen identified as well. However, they have no relation to the Coronavirus, but appeared\nafter COVID-19 became a pandemic.\n\n**Indicators of compromise:**\n\nMD5 First seen on\n\n6e3d57271a1c0e8e79c88d15f3897bab Nov 30 2019\n\n698aa564ba543d8b0bb247471554672b Feb 21 2020\n\n1dfc2e6f96727ab1bb37bc5ac303dc62 Mar 09 2020\n\n8fc2e3254eabdfceee843c6bc3367f6c Mar 09 2020\n\nc89cd578e2a647671ce7254d3fab41dc Mar 20 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Silviu STAHIE\n\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades,\ncovering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/sstahie/)\n\n\n## Silviu STAHIE\n\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades,\ncovering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/sstahie/)\n\n\n-----",
