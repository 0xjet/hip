At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/security-operations-center)\nElite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to\nthreats within minutes.\n\nWe have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our\nspace – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.\n\nOur Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat\nResponse and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU\nteam.\n\nIn TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent\nthreat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what\nrecommendations we have going forward.\n\n**Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…**\n\n## What did we find?\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline Stealer malware impacting a customer in the software industry.\n\nThe malware was disguised as an installer for a photo editing software and was\ninadvertently executed by the user.\nWhen executed, the fake installer communicated with the command-and-control,\nperformed anti-analysis checks and then injected code into the legitimate Windows\n[binary MSBuild.exe using the process hollowing technique. Using the hollowed](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\nprocess, the malware retrieves additional files hosted on the Discord chat service and\nconfigures a scheduled task for persistence.\n\n## How did we find it?\n\neSentire [MDR for Endpoint identified the process-hollowing activity.](https://www.esentire.com/how-we-do-it/signals/endpoint)\n\n## What did we do?\n\nOur [24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts investigated and confirmed the activity was malicious.](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/security-operations-center)\nWe also provided remediation recommendations and support to the customer.\n\n## What can you learn from this TRU positive?\n\n[eSentire has observed an increase in Redline Stealer infections since March 2022.](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/increase-in-redline-stealer-observations)\nRedline Stealer is a general-purpose information stealer capable of collecting\ncredentials and sensitive data from compromised systems.\nIt was initially advertised on various hacking forums in early 2020 for $150 and $200\nUSD for a “lite” and pro version respectively (Figure 1).\nCredentials stolen by information stealing malware can be used to further infiltrate\nnetworks or monetized through sale on various underground markets.\n\nIt’s well-established that extortion groups such as LAPSUS$ use stolen\ncredentials or session cookies purchased from these markets.\nAccording to [Microsoft, LAPSUS$ has used Redline Stealer directly as part of](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/)\ntheir initial access phase.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Early advertisement for Redline Stealer_\n\n## Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:\n\nProtecting against information stealers requires a multi-layered defense approach to defend\nendpoints from malware and detect or block unauthorized login activity against applications\nand remote access services. Therefore, we recommend:\n\nProtect all endpoints against malware.\n\nEnsure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.\nUse a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product\nto detect and contain threats.\nIn the event information stealing malware is identified, reset user credentials and\nterminate logon sessions.\nRestrict access to enterprise applications from personal devices outside the scope of\nsecurity monitoring.\nEnsure adequate logging is in place for remote access services such as VPN and use\nmodern authentication methods which support MFA and conditional access.\n\n## Ask Yourself...\n\nCan you identify Redline Stealer in time to minimize credential compromise?\nDo you have the visibility to identify use of compromised credentials in your\norganization?\n\neSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) is a world-class team of threat researchers who\ndevelop new detections enriched by original threat intelligence and leverage new machine\nlearning models that correlate multi-signal data and automate rapid response to advanced\nthreats.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you are not currently engaged with an MDR provider, eSentire MDR can help you reclaim\nthe advantage and put your business ahead of disruption.\n\nLearn what it means to have an elite team of Threat Hunters and Researchers that works for\nyou.
