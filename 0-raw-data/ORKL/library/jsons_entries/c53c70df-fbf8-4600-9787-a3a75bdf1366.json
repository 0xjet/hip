These tools contain\nreconnaissance/spreader scripts, exploits for Red Hat and CentOS, binary injectors, and more. In this blog, we focus on analyzing the\nworm and ransomware script.\n\nBy: Aliakbar Zahravi June 17, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\nA recently discovered Bash ransomware piqued our interest in multiple ways. Upon investigating, we found that the attack chain is fully\nimplemented as a bash script, but it also seems that the scripts are still under development. Most components of this attack mainly\ntarget Red Hat and CentOS Linux distributions; however, in some scripts Debian-based Linux distributions are included as well. The\nworm and ransomware scripts also use the API of the messaging application Telegram for command-and-control (C&C) communication.\nWe also found that most components of this attack have very low detection numbers in Virus Total. The hack tools URL with the\nransomware information was initially reported by Twitter user [@r3dbU7z.](https://twitter.com/r3dbu7z?lang=en)\n\nIn the next sections of this blog, we analyze the content of the “api_attack/” directory, which contains the Secure Shell (SSH) worm and\nransomware script.\n\nAttack preview\n\nThe following is a list and overview of the hacking tools. We’ve observed that some of these scripts are based on open-source code.\n[For example, binaryinject1.so is a modified version of a rootkit called “libprocesshider” that hides a process under Linux using the ld](https://github.com/gianlucaborello/libprocesshider)\npreloader and “pwd.c” (“CVE-2017-1000253.c”), which is a publicly available exploit for CentOS 7 kernel versions 3.10.0514.21.2.el7.x86_64 and 3.10.0-514.26.1.el7.x86_64.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.\n\nThreat actor’s hack tools directory\nAmong all these tools, the content of “api_attack/” grabbed our attention. The “api_attack” directory contains the various versions of the\nBash ransomware that we named DarkRadiation, as well as the SSH worm that is responsible for spreading this ransomware. The\n“Supermicro_cr_third” script in this directory seems to be the most complete version of the ransomware. This script is obfuscated with\nan open-source tool called “node-bash-obfuscate”, which is a Node.js CLI tool and library to obfuscate bash scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\n/api_attack\n\nhosting directory\nMost scripts in this directory have zero detections in Virus Total:\n\n\nFigure 2. Threat actor’s hack tools directory for\n\nFigure 3. Threat actor’s malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Virus Total results\nMalware analysis\n\nIn this section, we take a closer look at worm and ransomware scripts.\n\n**SSH Worm**\n\nThe “downloader.sh” is an SSH worm that accepts base64-encoded configuration credentials as an argument. These credentials would\neither be dumped by the attacker after the initial foothold on a victim’s systems or used as a brute-force list that targets systems with\nweak password protection. Essentially, the malware checks if the given configuration is set to use an SSH password attack or an SSH\nkey base attack — it can also test SSH passwords or SSH keys against the targeted IP address. Upon successful connection, the\nmalware downloads and executes ransomware on a remote system. The following is a format credential input to the script after\ndecoding:\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates this behavior of the malware:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Worm entry function\n\nThe check_ssh_connection function returns code:0 for a successful connection, code:254 for the ping error, and code:255 for SSH\nconnection error both with password and key. The malware uses the sshpass utility to use non-interactive SSH password\nauthentication.\n\nIn the case of SSH inline password, the malware sets sshpass parameter “passwordauthentication=yes”. It stores the ransomware\nscript in the “/usr/share/man/man8/” directory and executes it. To keep the process running in case the SSH session is terminated, the\nmalware uses screen session and nohup command.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Worm\n\nreconnaissance and spreading functionality\nThe malware obtains an encryption password ($crypt_pass) via an API call to its C&C server and passes it to the supermicro_cr.gz\nscript.\n\nFigure 7.\n\nRequest for encryption key\nThe malware has an install_tools function to download and install necessary utilities on an infected system in case they are not already\ninstalled. Based on this function, we can see that the worm only downloads and installs prerequisite packages for CentOS- or RHELbased Linux distribution because it uses only the Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) package manager. Some other hacking tools as\nwell as the DarkRadiation ransomware variants use only YUM to download and install prerequisite packages.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Prerequisite package installation\n\nFinally, the malware reports the scanning/spreading result to the attacker via Telegram’s API:\n\nFigure 9. The malware sends\n\nexecution status to the attacker's Telegram channel.\n**The DarkRadiation Ransomware**\n\nIn the previous section, we talked about the SSH worm script that received the credential configuration as a base64 parameter and\nused it against target systems to download and execute the ransomware.\n\nLooking at various iterations of the ransomware in this section, we investigate the script called “supermicro_cr_third”, which seems like\nthe latest version. The ransomware is written in bash script and targets Red Hat/CentOS and Debian Linux distributions. The malware\nuses OpenSSL’s AES algorithm with CBC mode to encrypt files in various directories. It also uses Telegram’s API to send an infection\nstatus to the threat actor(s).\n\nWe observed that this script is heavily under development, and various versions of this ransomware are all similar with only minor\nchanges. Some functions are commented by the malware author, while some functions are not used (dead code) in some cases. In this\nsection, we discuss the details of how this ransomware works.\n\n[The script is obfuscated with an open-source tool called “node-bash-obfuscate,” which is a Node.js CLI tool and library to obfuscate](https://github.com/willshiao/node-bash-obfuscate)\nbash scripts. This tool divides the bash script into chunks and then assigns a variable name to each chunk and replaces the original\nscript with variable references, essentially scrambling the original script.\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates the use of this script to obfuscate a bash script:\n\nFigure 10.\n\nnode-bash-obfuscate options\n\nFigure 11.\n\nnode-bash-obfuscate sample output\nsupermicro_cr_third analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. A supermicro_cr_third obfuscated script\nUpon execution, the malware checks if it executed as root; if it did not, it displays “Please run as root” message, removes itself, and\nexits.\n\nFigure 13. supermicro_cr_third main function\n\nFigure 14. Checking if script run as root\n\nIt then checks if curl and OpenSSL are installed; if they are not, the malware then downloads and installs them.\n\nFigure 15. A prerequisite package installation in another version\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. A prerequisite package installation in supermicro_cr_third\n\nThe bot_who function is a bash script that takes a snapshot of the users that are currently logged into a Unix computer system using the\n“who” command. It stores the result in a hidden file called (“/tmp/.ccw”). Afterward, every five seconds it again executes the “who”\ncommand and checks the output “.ccw” file. If they are not equal (new user logging in), the malware sends a message to the attacker\nvia Telegram’s API:\n\nFigure 17. supermicro_bt script\n\nBefore the encryption process, the ransomware retrieves a list of all available users on an infected system by querying the\n\"/etc/shadow\" file. It overwrites all existing user passwords with “megapassword” and deletes all existing users except “ferrum.” After\nthat, the malware creates a new user from its configuration section with username “ferrum” and password “MegPw0rD3”. It executes\n\"usermod --shell /bin/nologin\" command to disable all existing shell users on an infected system:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. supermicro_cr_third configuration\n\nFigure 19. user_change function in supermicro_cr_third\nSome ransomware variants attempt to delete all existing users except username “ferrum” and “root”:\n\nFigure 20. user_change\n\nfunction in crypt3.sh)\nIt also checks if “0.txt” exists in the C&C server. If it does not exist, the malware does not execute the encryption process and sleeps for\n60 seconds, after which it tries again. It must be noted that wget will be invoked with “--spider” option to just check if “0.txt” exists in the\ngiven URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. loop_wget_telegram function\n\nFigure 22. “/check_attack” directory\n\nFor encryption, the ransomware uses OpenSSL’s AES algorithm in CBC mode. The malware gets an encryption password through the\ncommand-line argument passed by the worm script:\n\nFigure 23. supermicro_cr_third key configuration\nIt is important to note that the encryption path can be different in other versions. Super_micro_third uses a separated script called\n(crypt_file.sh) for file encryption. However, other variants such as supermicro_cr do the file encryption by themselves. Also, it must be\nnoted that the ransomware appends radioactive symbols (“☢”) as a file extension for an encrypted file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. super_micro_third encryption process\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n\n25. supermicro_cr encryption function\nThe malware sends the encryption status to the attacker via Telegram’s API:\n\nFigure 26. Telegram configuration\n\nThe malware also stops and disables all running Docker containers on an infected system and creates a ransom note:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27.\n\nRansom note\nConclusion\n\nOverall, an adversary uses a variety of hacking tools to move laterally on victims’ networks to deploy ransomware. These hacking tools\n[contain reconnaissance/spreader scripts, exploits for Red Hat and CentOS, binary injectors (libprocesshider rootkit), and more.](https://github.com/gianlucaborello/libprocesshider)\nHowever, most of the tools have very low detection numbers in Virus Total. It seems that some of the scripts are still in the development\nphase.\n\nThere were other notable elements as well. The worm and ransomware scripts are able to communicate with the attacker via Telegram\nAPI and directly access the C&C server. The ransomware can delete all users on an infected system (although in some variants it\nkeeps the root user) and can create an account only for the attacker. As for file encryption, the ransomware uses OpenSSL’s AES\nalgorithm to encrypt either the file with specific extensions or all files at the given directory.\n\nIn this blog, we focused on analyzing the worm and supermicro_tr_third ransomware script. We found that the ransomware was\nobfuscated with an open-source tool called \"node-bash-obfuscate,\" which is a Node.js CLI tool and library to obfuscate bash scripts.\nHopefully, this can help with detection in case the attacker comes up with other ransomware variants using the same tool.\n\nTrend Micro has a multilayered cybersecurity platform that can help improve an organization’s detection and response against the latest\nransomware attacks and improve security teams’ visibility.
