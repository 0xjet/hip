    "plain_text": "# Cybercriminal greeners from Iran attack companies worldwide for financial gain\n\n**group-ib.com/media/iran-cybercriminals/**\n\nGroup-IB, a global threat hunting and intelligence company headquartered in Singapore, has\ndetected financially motivated attacks carried out by Iranian newbie threat actors in June.\nThe attackers used Dharma ransomware and a mix of publicly available tools to target\ncompanies in Russia, Japan, China, and India. All the affected organizations had hosts with\nInternet-facing RDP and weak credentials. The hackers typically demanded a ransom\nbetween 1-5 BTC. The newly discovered hacker group suggests that Iran, which has been\nknown as a cradle of state-sponsored APT groups for years, now also accommodates\nfinancially motivated cybercriminals.\n\nGroup-IB researchers have recently observed increased activities around Dharma\nransomware distribution. Dharma, also known as Crysis, has been distributed under\na ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model at least since 2016. Its source code popped up for\nsale in March 2020 making it available to a wider audience. During an incident response\nengagement for a company in Russia, Group-IB’s DFIR team established that Persianspeaking newbie hackers were behind a new wave of Dharma distribution. Even though the\nexact number of victims is unknown, the discovered forensic artifacts allowed to establish the\ngeography of their campaigns and the toolset, which is far behind the level of sophistication\nof big league Iranian APTs.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was revealed that the operators scanned ranges of IPs for hosts with Internet-facing RDP\nand weak credentials in Russia, Japan, China, and India. To do so, they used a popular\n[software called Masscan — the same technique was employed by Fxmsp, an infamous](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/fxmsp-report.html?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=media_news&utm_campaign=referral)\nseller of access to corporate networks. Once vulnerable hosts were identified, the attackers\ndeployed NLBrute to brute-force their way into the system and to check the validity\nof obtained credentials on other accessible hosts in the network. In some attacks, they\nattempted to elevate privileges using exploit for CVE-2017-0213.\n\nInterestingly, the threat actors likely didn’t have a clear plan on what to do with the\ncompromised networks. Once they established the RDP connection, they decide on which\ntools to deploy to move laterally. For instance, to disable built-in antivirus software, the\nattackers used Defender Control and Your Uninstaller. The latter was downloaded from\nIranian software sharing website — the Google search query in Persian language “داﻧﻠﻮد ﻧﺮم\nاﻓﺰار youre unistaller” was discovered in the Chrome artifacts. Other tools were downloaded\nby the attackers from Persian-language Telegram channels when they were already present\nin the network.\n\nTo scan for accessible hosts in the compromised network, threat actor used Advanced Port\nScanner — another publicly available tool. After the network reconnaissance activities were\ncompleted, the adversary used collected information to move laterally though the network\nusing the RDP protocol. The end goal of the attackers was to drop and execute a variant\nof Dharma ransomware: the adversary connected to the targeted hosts, dropped Dharma\nexecutable, and executed it manually. On average, the ransom demand was between 15 BTC.\n\nThe fact Dharma source code has been made widely available led to the increase in the\nnumber of operators deploying it. It’s surprising that Dharma landed in the hands of Iranian\nscript kiddies who used it for financial gain, as Iran has traditionally been a land of statesponsored attackers engaged in espionage and sabotage. Despite that these cybercriminals\nuse quite common tactics, techniques and procedures they have been quite effective.\nTherefore, we believe it’s important to provide some recommendations on how to protect\nagainst them and give a complete outline of the MITRE ATT&CK mapping.\n\n**Oleg Skulkin**\n\nSenior Digital Forensics Specialist\n\n\n-----\n\nThe pandemics exposed a great number of vulnerable hosts with many employees working\nfrom homes and the vector became increasingly popular among cybercriminals. Therefore,\nthe default RDP port 3389 should be edited by changing it to any other. As the attackers\nusually need several attempts to brute force passwords and gain access to the RDP,\nit is important to enable account lockout policies by limiting the number of failed login\nattempts per user. Threat intelligence solutions enable organizations to mitigate risks and\nfurther damage by quickly identifying stolen data and tracking down the source of the breach,\nwhile specialized threat detection systems allow to discover unwanted intrusions, traffic\nanomalies within the corporate network, and attempts to gain unauthorized access to any\ndata.\n\n\n-----",
