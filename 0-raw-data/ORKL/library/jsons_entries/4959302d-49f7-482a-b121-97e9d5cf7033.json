While most of the actors behind this](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/fireeye-approach-to-operational-technology-security)\nactivity likely do not differentiate between IT and OT or have a particular interest in OT assets,\nthey are driven by the goal of making money and have demonstrated the skills needed to\noperate in these networks. For example, the shift to post-compromise ransomware\ndeployment highlights the actors’ ability to adapt to more complex environments.\n\nIn this blog post we look further into this trend by examining two different process kill lists\ncontaining OT processes which we have observed deployed alongside a variety of\nransomware samples and families. We think it is likely that these lists were the result of\ncoincidental asset scanning in victim organizations and not specific targeting of OT. While this\njudgement may initially seem like good news to defenders, this activity still indicates that\nmultiple, very prolific, financially motivated threat actors are active inside organizations’ OT—\nbased on the contents of these process kill lists—with the intent of profiting from the ransom\nof stolen information and disrupted services.\n\n**Two Unique Process Kill Lists Deployed Alongside Seven Ransomware Families**\n**Include OT Processes**\n\nThreat actors often deploy process kill lists alongside or as part of ransomware to terminate\nanti-virus products, stop alternative detection mechanisms, and remove file locks to ensure\ncritical data is encrypted. As a result, the deployment of these lists increases the likelihood of\na successful attack (MITRE ATT&CK T1489). In post compromise ransomware attacks,\nattackers regularly tailor the lists to include processes that are relevant to the victim’s\nenvironment. By stopping these processes, the attacker makes sure to encrypt data from\ncritical systems, which may remain unaffected if the process is currently in use. As the\nlikelihood of crippling critical systems increases, the target is more likely to suffer impacts on\nits physical production.\n\n_First Process Kill List Has Been Leveraged By At Least Six Ransomware Families_\n\nMandiant identified samples of at least six ransomware families (DoppelPaymer, LockerGoga,\nMaze, MegaCortex, Nefilim and SNAKEHOSE)—all of which have been associated with highprofile incidents impacting industrial organizations over the past two years—that have\nleveraged a common process kill list containing 1,000+ processes. The list, which we briefly\n[discussed in an earlier blog post from February 2020, includes a couple dozen processes](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/ransomware-against-machine-learning-to-disrupt-industrial-production)\nrelated to OT executables—mainly from General Electric Proficy, a suite used for historians\nand human-machine interfaces (HMIs). We note, that while the inclusion of these processes\nin this kill list could result in limited loss of view of historical process data, it is not likely to\ndirectly impact the operator’s ability to control the physical process itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n1: Snippets from “kill.bat” deployed alongside LockerGoga (L) and MegaCortex process kill list\n(R)\nThe earliest iteration we identified of the shared kill list was a batch script deployed alongside\nLockerGoga (MD5: 34187a34d0a3c5d63016c26346371b54) in January 2019 (Figure 1).\nOther iterations of the list we have observed are also hardcoded directly into the ransomware\nbinaries. The different techniques used to deploy the process kill list, the use of different\nmalware families, and slight variations between each list iteration (mainly typos in the\nprocesses, e.g.: a2guard.exea2start.exe; nexe; proficyclient.exe) indicate that likely more than\none actor had access to the true source of the process kill list. This source could be for\nexample a post of processes shared on a dark web forum, or an independent actor sharing\nthe compiled list with other actors.\n\nWe think it is likely that the OT processes identified in this list simply represent the\ncoincidental output of automated process collection from victim environment(s) and not a\ntargeted effort to impact OT. This is supported by the relatively limited and specific selection of\nOT-related processes, rather than a broader selection of many vendors and OT-related\nprocesses that would have been suggestive of targeted external research. Regardless, this\ndoes not downplay the significance of the inclusion of OT processes in the list, as it suggests\nthat sophisticated financially motivated actors, such as FIN6, have had at least some visibility\ninto a victim’s OT network. As a result, the actors were able to tailor their malware to impact\nthose systems, without the explicit intent to target OT assets.\n\nMost types of ransomware attacks in OT environments will result in the disruption of services\nand a temporary loss of view into current and historical process data. However, OT\nenvironments impacted by a ransomware that leverages this kill list and happen to be running\none or more of the processes used by the initial victim(s)—and therefore are included on the\n\n\n-----\n\nlist—may face additional impacts. For example, historian databases would be more likely to\nbe encrypted, possibly resulting in loss of historical data. Other impacts could include gaps in\nthe collection of process data corresponding to the duration of the outage and temporary loss\nof access to licensing rights for critical services.\n\n_Second List Deployed Alongside CLOP Ransomware Sample Has a Higher Chance of_\n_Impacting OT Systems_\n\nMandiant analyzed a second, entirely unrelated sample of ransomware (MD5:\n3b980d2af222ec909b948b6bbdd46319) from the CLOP family with a hardcoded list for\nenumeration and termination of processes that includes a number of OT strings. The list\ncontains over 1,425 processes, from which at least 150 belong to OT-related software suites\n(Figure 2 and Appendix).\n\nBased on our analysis, the CLOP malware family’s process kill list has grown over time\npossibly as more processes are scanned during different compromises. While we do not\ncurrently hold enough information to describe the exact mechanism used by the actor to grow\nthe list, it appears to have resulted from actor reconnaissance across multiple victims. We\nhave observed the threat actor employing process discovery procedures, including running\nthe tasklist utility. This indicates that the actor scanned for processes in at least one victim’s\nOT network(s) before deploying the ransomware.\n\nFigure 2: Subset of processes in observed CLOP sample\nCLOP is also interesting as we have only observed a single unique and very prolific financially\nmotivated threat actor leveraging the malware family. The group, who has been active since\nat least 2016 and potentially as early as 2014, is known for operating large phishing\ncampaigns to distribute malware and typically monetizes intrusions through ransomware\ndeployment. As highlighted by their versatility and long history in financially motivated\nintrusions, the actor’s activity in OT networks is likely no more than an additional step in the\nprocess for monetization. However, the financial motivations of the actor again do not imply\n\n\n-----\n\nlow risk to OT. Instead, our analysis of the CLOP sample s kill list indicates that the included\nprocesses actually have greater potential to disrupt OT systems than those included in the\nshared list described above.\n\nUnlike the first kill list, the CLOP sample includes a list of processes that, if stopped, may\ndirectly impact the operator’s ability to both visualize and control production. This is especially\ntrue in the case of some included processes that support HMI and PLC supervision. Some of\nthe OT processes present in the CLOP sample are related to the following products:\n\n**Vendor** **Product** **Description**\n\n\nSiemens SIMATIC\nWinCC\n\n\nSCADA system, common for process control and\nautomation.\n\n\nBeckhoff TwinCAT Software for PC-based process control and\nautomation.\n\n\nNational\nInstruments\n\n\nData\nAcquisition\nSoftware\n(DAQ)\n\n\nSoftware used to acquire data from sensors and\nconditioning devices.\n\n\nKepware KEPServer EX Software platform that collects information from\nindustrial devices and sends the output to SCADA\napplications.\n\n\nOPC Unified\nArchitecture\n(OPC-UA)\n\n\nN/A Communication protocol for data acquisition and\nexchange between industrial equipment and enterprise\nsystems.\n\n\nTable 1: Examples of products related to OT processes included in identified CLOP kill list\n\nWhile it is likely the physical processes this software controls would continue to operate even\nif the software processes were terminated unexpectedly, stopping the software processes\nincluded in the CLOP sample’s kill list could result in the loss of view/control over those\nphysical processes due to the inability of operators to interact with the equipment. This can be\ncaused not only by the ransomware’s disruption of intermediary systems, but also by the loss\nof access to relevant files on HMIs/EWS required for the operation of process control and\nmonitoring software–for example configurations or project files. This could prolong the mean\ntime to recovery (MTTR) of impacted environments without offline backups. In the CLOP\nsample list, we also identified specialized processes for software application design and\ntesting that may also become corrupted at the time of encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Process Kill Lists Are Just An Observable Indicating Broader Financially Motivated**\n**Interest In OT**\n\nFinancially motivated threat actors leverage a large variety of tactics and techniques to obtain\ndata that they can later use to generate profits. While financial actors have historically posed\nlittle to no threat to OT systems, the recent uptick in ransomware and extortion incidents\nhighlights that industrial operations are increasingly at risk. Although we have not observed\nany financially motivated actors explicitly targeting OT systems, our research into process kill\nlists deployed with or alongside ransomware samples shows that at least two sophisticated\nfinancial actors have expanded their access into OT networks during their regular intrusions.\n\nThis increasing exposure of OT to financially motivated threat activity is no surprise, given that\nTTPs used by cybercriminals increasingly resemble those employed by sophisticated actors.\nWe have consistently conveyed this message since at least 2018, when we publicly\n[discussed the commodity and custom IT tools leveraged by the TRITON attacker while](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/triton-actor-ttp-profile-custom-attack-tools-detections)\ntraversing through its targets’ networks (Figure 3). The likelihood of financially motivated\nactors impacting OT while seeking to monetize intrusions will continue to rise for the following\nreasons:\n\nFigure\n\n3: TTPs seen across both IT and OT incidents\n\nFinancially-motivated threat actors moving to a post-compromise ransomware model will\ncontinue to evolve and find ways to reach the most critical systems of organizations as\npart of their mission of monetization. As these actors are mainly driven by profits, they\nare not likely to differentiate between IT and OT assets.\n\n\n-----\n\nOT organizations will continue to struggle to evolve at the same pace as cyber criminals.\nAs a result, small weaknesses such as misconfigurations, exposed vulnerabilities or\nimproper segmentation will be enough for financial actors to gain access to networks in\ntheir attempts to profit from intrusions.\nAs the market for OT solutions continues to incorporate IT services and features into\nbroadly adopted products, we expect the convergence of technologies to result in a\nbroader attack surface for financial threat actors to target.\nThe TTPs employed by both financial and sophisticated nation-state actors often rely on\nintermediary systems as stepping stones through intrusions. As a result, the skills of\nboth groups hold similar potential of reaching OT systems even when financial groups\nmay only do so coincidentally or as part of their monetization strategy.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nAs OT networks continue to become more accessible to threat actors of all motivations,\nsecurity threats that have historically impacted primarily IT are becoming more commonplace.\nThis normalization of OT as just another network from the threat actor perspective is\nproblematic for defenders for many of the reasons discussed above. This recent threat activity\nshould be taken as a wake-up call for two main reasons: the various security challenges\ncommonly faced by organizations to protect OT networks, and the significant consequences\nthat may arise from security compromises even when they are not explicitly designed to target\nproduction systems. Asset owners need to look at OT security with the mindset that it is not if\nyou will have a breach, but when. This shift in thinking will allow defenders to better prepare to\nrespond when an incident does happen, and can help reduce the impact of an incident by\norders of magnitude.\n\n**Appendix: Selection Of OT Processes From CLOP Kill List**\n\n**Process Name** **Vendor**\n\nACTLICENSESERVER.EXE Atlas Copco\n\nTCATSYSSRV.EXE Beckhoff\n\nTCEVENTLOGGER.EXE Beckhoff\n\nTCR.EXE Beckhoff\n\nALARMMANAGER.EXE GE\n\n\n-----\n\nS2.EXE Honeywell\n\nBR.ADI.DISPLAY.BRIGHTNESS.EXE B&R\n\nBR.ADI.SERVICE.EXE B&R\n\nBR.ADI.UPS.MANAGER.EXE B&R\n\nBR.ADI.UPS.SERVICE.EXE B&R\n\nBR.AS.UPGRADESERVICE.EXE B&R\n\nBRAUTHORIZATIONSVC.EXE B&R\n\nBRTOUCHSVC.EXE B&R\n\nOPCROUTER4SERVICE.EXE Inray\nIndustriesoftware\n\nOPCROUTERCONFIG.EXE Inray\nIndustriesoftware\n\nSERVER_EVENTLOG.EXE Kepware\n\nSERVER_RUNTIME.EXE Kepware\n\nNICELABELAUTOMATIONSERVICE2017.EXE NiceLabel\n\nNICELABELPROXY.EXE NiceLabel\n\nNICELABELPROXYSERVICE2017.EXE NiceLabel\n\nAPPLICATIONWEBSERVER.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nCWDSS.EXE National\nInstruments\n\n\n-----\n\nNIAUTH_DAEMON.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIDEVMON.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIDISCSVC.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIDMSRV.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIERSERVER.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNILXIDISCOVERY.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIMDNSRESPONDER.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIMXS.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIPXICMS.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIROCO.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNISDS.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNISVCLOC.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nNIWEBSERVICECONTAINER.EXE National\nInstruments\n\n\n-----\n\nSYSTEMWEBSERVER.EXE National\nInstruments\n\nOPC.UA.DISCOVERYSERVER.EXE OPC\n\nOPCUALDS.EXE OPC\n\nANAWIN.EXE AUTEM\n\nASM.EXE Possibly\nSiemens\n\nPARAMETRIC.EXE PTC\n\nQDAS_O-QIS.EXE Q-Das\n\nQDAS_PROCELLA.EXE Q-Das\n\nQDAS_QS-STAT.EXE Q-Das\n\nQDASIDI_SRV.EXE Q-Das\n\nSPCPROCESSLINK.EXE Q-Das\n\nTAGSRV.EXE Rockwell\nAutomation or\nNational\nInstruments\n\n_SIMPCMON.EXE Siemens\n\nALMPANELPLUGIN.EXE Siemens\n\nALMSRV64X.EXE Siemens\n\nALMSRVBUBBLE64X.EXE Siemens\n\n\n-----\n\nCC.TUNNELSERVICEHOST.EXE Siemens\n\nCCAEPROVIDER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCAGENT.EXE Siemens\n\nCCALGRTSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCARCHIVEMANAGER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCCAPHSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCCSIGRTSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCDBUTILS.EXE Siemens\n\nCCDELTALOADER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCDMRUNTIMEPERSISTENCE.EXE Siemens\n\nCCECLIENT_X64.EXE Siemens\n\nCCECLIENT.EXE Siemens\n\nCCESERVER_X64.EXE Siemens\n\nCCESERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCKEYBOARDHOOK.EXE Siemens\n\nCCLICENSESERVICE.EXE Siemens\n\nCCNSINFO2PROVIDER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCPACKAGEMGR.EXE Siemens\n\n\n-----\n\nCCPERFMON.EXE Siemens\n\nCCPROFILESERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCPROJECTMGR.EXE Siemens\n\nCCPTMRTSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCREDUNDANCYAGENT.EXE Siemens\n\nCCREMOTESERVICE.EXE Siemens\n\nCCRT2XML.EXE Siemens\n\nCCRTSLOADER_X64.EXE Siemens\n\nCCSSMRTSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCSYSTEMDIAGNOSTICSHOST.EXE Siemens\n\nCCTEXTSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCTLGSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCTMTIMESYNC.EXE Siemens\n\nCCTMTIMESYNCSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCUCSURROGATE.EXE Siemens\n\nCCWATCHOPC.EXE Siemens\n\nCCWRITEARCHIVESERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nDA2XML.EXE Siemens\n\n\n-----\n\nGSCRT.EXE Siemens\n\nHMIES.EXE Siemens\n\nHMIRTM.EXE Siemens\n\nHMISMARTSTART.EXE Siemens\n\nHMRT.EXE Siemens\n\nIPCSECCOM.EXE Siemens\n\nOPCUASERVERWINCC.EXE Siemens\n\nPASSDBRT.EXE Siemens\n\nPDLRT.EXE Siemens\n\nPMEXP.EXE Siemens\n\nPNIOMGR.EXE Siemens\n\nREDUNDANCYCONTROL.EXE Siemens\n\nREDUNDANCYSTATE.EXE Siemens\n\nS7ACMGRX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7AHHLPX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7ASYSVX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7EPASRV64X.EXE Siemens\n\nS7HSPSVX.EXE Siemens\n\n\n-----\n\nS7KAFAPX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7O.TUNNELSERVICEHOST.EXE Siemens\n\nS7OIEHSX64.EXE Siemens\n\nS7OPNDISCOVERYX64.EXE Siemens\n\nS7SYMAPX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7TGTOPX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7TRACESERVICE64X.EXE Siemens\n\nS7UBTOOX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7UBTSTX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7WNRMSX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7WNSMGX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7WNSMSX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7XUDIAX.EXE Siemens\n\nS7XUTAPX.EXE Siemens\n\nSCORECFG.EXE Siemens\n\nSCOREDP.EXE Siemens\n\nSCOREPNIO.EXE Siemens\n\nSCORES7.EXE Siemens\n\n\n-----\n\nSCORESR.EXE Siemens\n\nSCSDISTSERVICEX.EXE Siemens\n\nSCSFSX.EXE Siemens\n\nSCSMX.EXE Siemens\n\nSDIAGRT.EXE Siemens\n\nSIEMENS.INFORMATIONSERVER.DISCOVERSERVICEINSTALLER.EXE Siemens\n\nSIEMENS.INFORMATIONSERVER.ISREADY.PLUGINSERVICE.EXE Siemens\n\nSIEMENS.INFORMATIONSERVER.SCHEDULER.EXE Siemens\n\nSIM9SYNC.EXE Siemens\n\nSIMNETPNPMAN.EXE Siemens\n\nSMARTSERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nSSERVCFG.EXE Siemens\n\nTOUCHINPUTPC.EXE Siemens\n\nTRACECONCEPTX.EXE Siemens\n\nTRACESERVER.EXE Siemens\n\nUM.RIS.EXE Siemens\n\nUM.SSO.EXE Siemens\n\nWEBNAVIGATORRT.EXE Siemens\n\n\n-----\n\nWINCCEXPLORER.EXE Siemens\n\nCCDMRTCHANNELHOST.EXE Siemens\n\nANSYS.ACT.BROWSER.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYS.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYS192.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYSFWW.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYSLI_CLIENT.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYSLI_MONITOR.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYSLI_SERVER.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYSLMD.EXE Ansys\n\nANSYSWBU.EXE Ansys\n\nCONFIGSERVERI64.EXE Tani\n\nENGINELOGGERI64.EXE Tani\n\nPLCENGINEI64.EXE Tani\n\n\n-----",
