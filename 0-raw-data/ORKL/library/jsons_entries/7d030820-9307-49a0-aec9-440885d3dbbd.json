While we could not](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/03/unit42-shamoon-2-delivering-disttrack/)\n[identify the impacted organization from the malware, today Saipem disclosed they were attacked. In previous attacks, we were able to](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-shamoon/saipem-says-shamoon-variant-crippled-hundreds-of-computers-idUSKBN1OB2FA)\ndetermine the impacted organization based on the domain names and credentials used by the Disttrack tool to spread to other systems on the\nnetwork. However, that functionality was missing from this sample. Unlike past Shamoon attacks, this particular Disttrack wiper would not\noverwrite files with an image. Instead it would overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system with randomly generated data.\n\nAccording to a [press release, Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The](http://www.saipem.com/sites/SAIPEM_en_IT/con-side-dx/Press%20releases/2018/Cyber%20attack%20update.page)\n[attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out restoration activities. Saipem told Reuters that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-shamoon/saipem-says-shamoon-variant-crippled-hundreds-of-computers-idUSKBN1OB2FA)\n300 systems on their network were crippled by the malware related to the 2012 Shamoon attacks. While we cannot definitively confirm that\nSaipem was the impacted organization, the timing of this incident with the emergence of the Disttrack sample discussed in this blog is quite\ncoincidental.\n\nDropper\n\nThe sample submitted to VirusTotal is a Disttrack dropper, which is responsible for installing a communications and wiper module to the\nsystem. The dropper is also responsible for spreading to other systems on the same local network, which it accomplishes by attempting to log\ninto other systems on the network remotely using previously stolen usernames and passwords. Unfortunately, this particular sample does not\ncontain any domains, usernames, or passwords to perform this spreading functionality, so this sample would only run on the system in which it\nwas specifically executed.\n\nThe dropper has a hardcoded kill time of '12/7/17 23:51'; if the system date is after this date the dropper installs the wiper module and starts\nwiping files on the system. The dropper reads the '%WINDOWS%\\inf\\mdmnis5tQ1.pnf' file to obtain a custom kill date that it will use instead of\nthe hardcoded time. The communications module installed by the dropper writes to this file, which will be discussed in a later section. The\ndropper also decrypts a string '\\inf\\averbh_noav.pnf' that is the other file that the communications module uses to write system information to\nand if the wiper was able to successfully wipe the system, but the dropper does not appear to use this file.\n\nThe dropper has three resources, two of which contain embedded modules, specifically a communications module and a wiper module. The\nthird resource contains an x64 variant of the dropper, which it will use if the architecture of the system is determined to be x64. The resources\nhave a language set to ‘SUBLANG_ARABIC_YEMEN’ that was also found in the previous Disttrack samples used in Shamoon 2 attacks. The\nresource names are PIC, LNG, and MNU, which are slightly altered versions of the ICO, LANG, and MENU names found in previous samples.\n\nThe dropper extracts modules from these resources by seeking a specific offset and reading a specific number of bytes as the length of the\nciphertext. The dropper then decrypts the ciphertext by using an XOR cipher and a specific base64 encode string that is decoded and used as\nthe key. Before accessing the ciphertext, the dropper subtracts 14 from the specified offset, which is the same as previous Disttrack samples\ndelivered in Shamoon 2 attacks. Tables 1, 2, and 3 include the resources, the information used to extract them, and the resulting module.\n\n\n**Resource**\n**name**\n\n\nPIC\n\n\n**Description** x64 variant of Dropper\n\n\n**Base64**\n**Key**\n\n\n2q9BQGHGVktPVIMZ6Nx17Njp4B5mHgj51hbybNInRWsNIWniq6hOYvf5CksMXvPOyl/3dYKDn7ymSGlK0+l5KA8YC8dzkkAwmn0\n\n\n**Offset** 8786-14\n\n**Length** 983552\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256 of**\n**Cleartext**\n\n\n0975eb436fb4adb9077c8e99ea6d34746807bc83a228b17d321d14dfbbe80b03\n\n\n_Table 1 Resource containing the x64 variant of the Disttrack dropper_\n\n\n**Resource**\n**name**\n\n\nMNU\n\n\n**Description** Communications module\n\n\n**Base64**\n**Key**\n\n\nU3JGgjNUDzWJEpOxzuwHjOijgav56cZatHh98dLbazGIBe7UMOcvdyCvU5/8mH1n7jUcMSIPFmqr7M671h5jradiKMn9M1sBdAmK\n\n\n**Offset** 8601-14\n\n**Length** 266752\n\n\n**SHA256 of**\n**Cleartext**\n\n\n0694bdf9f08e4f4a09d13b7b5a68c0148ceb3fcc79442f4db2aa19dd23681afe\n\n\n_Table 2 Resource containing the communications module in the Disttrack dropper_\n\n\n**Resource**\n**name**\n\n\nLNG\n\n\n**Description** Wiper module\n\n\n**Base64**\n**Key**\n\n\ncb5F91PLTu1hN8oPgG2a6AQiJkphsXAmWFarsUoYEFo/BNgxF8Rj/hdzHxW/k/fLCZboSJRLnr9OH578IJyiSSdvz3uUaNA/vycy7ZJ\n\n\n**Offset** 7892-14\n\n**Length** 402432\n\n\n**SHA256 of**\n**Cleartext**\n\n\n391e7b90bf3f0bfeb2c2602cc65aa6be4dd1c01374b89c4a48425f2d22fe231c\n\n\n_Table 3 Resource containing the wiper module within the Disttrack dropper_\n\nThe dropper will install itself to the system (and remote systems if spreading was possible) by creating a service with the attributes listed in\nTable 4 below.\n\n\n**Service**\n**name**\n\n**Service**\n**display**\n**name**\n\n**Service**\n**description**\n\n**Binary**\n**path**\n\n\nMaintenaceSrv\n\nMaintenace Host Service\n\nThe Maintenace Host service is hosted in the LSA process.

The wiper carries out this wiping using a\nlegitimate hard disk driver called RawDisk by ElDos. The wiper contains the ElDos RawDisk driver in a resource named 'e' that it extracts by\nskipping to offset 1984 and reading 27792 bytes from that offset. It then decrypts the data using aa 247-byte key and saves it to\n‘%WINDOWS%\\system32\\hdv_725x.sys’. The wiper then creates a service named ‘hdv_725x’ for this driver using the following command line\ncommand and runs it with \"sc start hdv_725x\":\n\nsc create hdv_725x type= kernel start= demand binpath= %WINDOWS%\\system32\\hdv_725x.sys\n\nThis wiper was configured using the ‘R’ flag, which generates a buffer of random bytes that it will use to overwrite the MBR, partitions and files.\nThe sample supports two additional configuration flags as well, specifically ‘F’ and ‘E’ flags that will either overwrite files using a file or encrypt\nits contents.\n\nThe wiper could be configured to use a file to overwrite the files on the disk using the ‘F’ configuration flag, as we saw images used to\noverwrite files in previous Shamoon attacks. This file would be stored in a resource named ‘GRANT’, but this particular wiper is not configured\nto use a file for overwriting so the GRANT resource does not exist. If it were configured to use a file, this sample would extract the file using the\ninformation listed in Table 5.\n\n\n**Resource**\n**name**\n\n\nGRANT\n\n\n**Description** File to overwrite within Wiper module\n\n\n**Base64**\n**Key**\n\n\nheocXOK4rDmQg4LRfiURI9wSOuSMwe0e69NfEpZLmyNixiUGYdEtpx/ZG3rMRN7GZlJ1/crQTz5Bf6W0xgkyYCwzD247FolCGA0E\n\n\n-----\n\n**Offset** 71-14\n\n**Length** <unknown>\n\n\n**SHA256 of**\n**Cleartext**\n\n\n<unknown>\n\n\n_Table 5 Resource in wiper module that would contain file to use for overwriting data_\n\nThis sample is also capable of being configured to import an RSA key to encrypt the MBR, partitions, and files via configuration flag ‘E’. This\nsample was not configured to encrypt files, and the RSA key is empty in the wiper.\n\nAfter completing this wiping functionality, the sample will reboot the system using the following command line, which will render it unusable\nwhen the system reboots as the important system locations and files have been overwritten with random data:\n\nshutdown -r -f -t 2\n\nCommunications\n\nThe communications module (SHA256: 0694bdf9f08e4f4a09d13b7b5a68c0148ceb3fcc79442f4db2aa19dd23681afe) dropped by the Disttrack\ndropper will use the following two supporting files:\n\n%WINDOWS%\\inf\\mdmnis5tQ1.pnf - Used to set a wipe date for associated wiper module\n\n%WINDOWS%\\inf\\averbh_noav.pnf - Used to mark successful wiping\n\nThe communications module is responsible for reaching out to hardcoded URLs to communicate with the C2 server, but like previous Disttrack\nsamples, this communication module does not contain functional C2 domains to use in the URLs. If it did, it would create a URL with a\nparameter named 'selection' followed by system information and the contents of the 'averbh_noav.pnf' file, as seen here:\n\n[C2 URL, empty]?selection=[system info and contents of averbh_noav.pnf]\n\nWhen communicating with the C2 URL, the communications module would use a User Agent of 'Mozilla/13.0 (MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0)',\nwhich is the same as past Disttrack communication module samples. Table 6 below show the two commands the C2 could respond with that\nthe communications module could handle.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nE Reads base64 encoded file from the C2 server, runs 'del /f /a %TEMP%\\Temp\\reilopycb\\*.exe' to delete previously downloaded\nexecutables, runs 'mkdir %TEMP%\\Temp\\reilopycb] > nul 2>&1' to create a folder and saves the executbale to a file named\n'[tick count].exe'. The Trojan then runs the downloaded executable %TEMP%\\Temp\\reilopycb\\[tick count].exe'\n\nT Opens the '\\inf\\mdmnis5tQ1.pnf' file and writes a supplied date to the file. The '\\inf\\mdmnis5tQ1.pnf' file is used by another\nassociated module to this communications module that is responsible for wiping the system.\n\n_Table 6 Commands available within the communication module's command handler_\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Disttrack sample uploaded to VirusTotal is a variant of the samples used in the Shamoon 2 attacks in 2016 and 2017. The tool does not\nhave the capability to spread to other systems on the local network. Instead it would have to be loaded onto and executed on the system that\nthe actors intend to wipe. The wipe date of '12/7/2017' does not seem timely. However, this older date is still effective as the Disttrack dropper\nwill install and run the wiper module as long as the system date is after the wipe date. Unlike past Shamoon attacks, this particular Disttrack\nwiper would not overwrite files with an image. Instead, it would overwrite the MBR, partitions and files on the system with random data. While\nwe can’t confirm this sample was used in the Saipem attack, it is likely at least related to it.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat:\n\nWildFire detects all samples associated with this attack with malicious verdicts\n[AutoFocus customers can track this attack and previous Shamoon attacks using the Disttrack](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Disttrack)\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nc3ab58b3154e5f5101ba74fccfd27a9ab445e41262cdf47e8cc3be7416a5904f - Disttrack Dropper x86\n\n0975eb436fb4adb9077c8e99ea6d34746807bc83a228b17d321d14dfbbe80b03 - Disttrack Dropper x64\n\n0694bdf9f08e4f4a09d13b7b5a68c0148ceb3fcc79442f4db2aa19dd23681afe - Disttrack Comms module x86\n\n391e7b90bf3f0bfeb2c2602cc65aa6be4dd1c01374b89c4a48425f2d22fe231c - Disttrack Wiper module x86\n\n\n-----\n\n6985e 5809d0 89ee 6 3cd 3653 b8 8 d 8 3 09 a de b a6e c0e a8 9 os a s e 86\n\nccb1209122085bed5bded3f923835a65d3cc1071f7e4ad52bc5cf42057dd2150 - Disttrack Comms module x64\n\ndab3308ab60d0d8acb3611bf364e81b63cfb6b4c1783864ebc515297e2297589 - Disttrack Wiper module x64\n\nbc4513e1ea20e11d00cfc6ce899836e4f18e4b5f5beee52e0ea9942adb78fc70 - ElDos RawDisk Driver x64\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
