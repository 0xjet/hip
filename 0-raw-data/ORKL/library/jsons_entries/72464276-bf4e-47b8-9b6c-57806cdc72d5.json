While most RF jamming is benign and simply intended to provide extra privacy, first responder\noperations have also been specifically targeted by jamming and interference attacks. RF detection,\nspectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment can be used to detect, identify, and locate RF\ninterference sources that may be disrupting first responder communications systems.\n\nMany RF technologies are available for operational field usage, as opposed to laboratory usage. This\nallows for quick deployment, letting responders locate and mitigate radio interference. Some of\nthese products can be installed as a permanent fixed sensor or can be portable and deployed\ntemporarily as a fixed sensor. Other products are handheld and mobile, allowing responders to\nthoroughly search an area, which may be affected by RF interference.\n\nSome of these products have features such as built-in map and spectrum plot displays to provide\ndata visualization or internal storage drives that allow data to be recorded for future analysis. These\ntechnologies can detect RF interference sources at frequencies as low as 9 kHz and as high as\n18 GHz.\n\nThe purpose of this market survey report is to provide emergency responders with information on RF\ndetection, spectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment that are commercially available in\norder to guide purchasing and acquisition decision-making.\n\nIn June 2018, NUSTL through its System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders\n(SAVER) Program, conducted a market survey of RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction\nfinding equipment. The survey produced 14 products ranging in price from $15,000 to $270,000.\nThe results of the market survey are highlighted in this report. Performance of these products has\nnot been independently verified by NUSTL.\n\nEmergency response agencies that consider purchasing RF detection, spectrum analysis, and\ndirection finding equipment should carefully research the overall capabilities and limitations and\ntechnical specifications of each system in relation to their agency’s operational needs.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TABLE OF CONTENTS

equipment includes devices that can detect,\nidentify, and analyze RF signals transmitted by various sources. RF direction finding equipment\nincludes devices that measure and triangulate the direction from which an RF signal was\ntransmitted. These devices can be used to identify and locate transmissions from suspicious or\nthreatening sources, including RF interference that may be blocking first responder communications\nor damaging electronic devices. NUSTL, through its System Assessment and Validation for\nEmergency Responders (SAVER) Program, conducted a market survey to provide emergency\nresponders with information on RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment.\n\nThis market survey report is based on information gathered during June 2018 from vendor websites,\ninternet research, industry publications and a government-issued Request for Information (RFI) that\nwas posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. For inclusion in this report, products had\nto meet the following criteria:\n\n#### • Product must be commercially available\n\n • Product must be designed for usage in the field rather than in a laboratory environment\n\n • Product must be designed to detect RF signals intended to interfere with first responder\ncommunications systems.\n\nDue diligence was performed to develop a report that is representative of products in the\nmarketplace.\n\n#### 2.0 RF DETECTION, SPECTRUM ANALYSIS, AND DIRECTION FINDING EQUIPMENT OVERVIEW\n\nIn recent years RF jammers have become increasingly more accessible to the public. While most RF\njamming is simply intended to provide extra privacy, first responder operations have also been\nspecifically targeted by jamming and interference attacks.\n\nRadio interference works by targeting receivers. An RF jammer will transmit a signal on the same\nfrequency as the desired signal. The jamming signal may be received at the same power level or a\ngreater power level, thus preventing receivers from being able to distinguish the desired signal from\nthe jamming signal.\n\nWhile radio communications may be the most obvious target of RF jammers, these interference\nsources can also disrupt the operation of other devices that communicate wirelessly. An example of\nthis is the usage of a Global Positioning System (GPS) jammer by a truck driver to avoid paying\nhighway tolls and avoid being tracked by his or her employer. Alternatively, an example of an RF\njammer specifically targeting first responder operations is an interference source preventing a\ncontrol center from receiving video uploaded by traffic cameras.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2.1 CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES\n\nThe technologies listed in this report range from fixed site sensors with omnidirectional antennas\nfor spectrum monitoring to mobile handheld sensors with directional antennas for direction\nfinding. Most of the products in this report can operate as a standalone sensor. However, some\nproducts, especially fixed site sensors, can be networked for greater monitoring coverage. While\nsome of the technologies include a built-in display, many use an external laptop or tablet, which\nprovides a spectrum analyzer or a map display locating any detected RF jamming and interference\nsources.\n\n##### 2.2 APPLICATIONS\n\nAs mentioned above, RF jamming and interference can disrupt first responder communications\nduring emergency response operations. RF detection devices can be used to identify any RF\ninterference that might impact communications. Spectrum analysis devices can be used to\ndetermine the frequency and received strength of RF interference. Spectrum analysis devices can\nalso be used to identify frequencies that are free of interference should a responder use channel\nswitching as a RF jamming mitigation tactic. RF direction finders can assist in locating RF jamming\ndevices. If the interference source is located, responders can apply direct mitigation tactics to\novercome the impacts of RF jamming.\n\n#### 3.0 PRODUCT INFORMATION\n\nThis section provides information on 14 RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction finding\ndevices that range in price from $15,000 to $270,000.
