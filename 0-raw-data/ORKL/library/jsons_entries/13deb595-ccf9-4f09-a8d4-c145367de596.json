The group is notable not only for its longevity, but also\nits audacity as Sandworm is associated with multiple high-profile, disruptive incidents such\nas the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the group s association with destructive cyber events, such as the 2017 NotPetya\nincident, the [2015 TV5 Monde event, and the](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375) attempted protection attack against Ukrainian\nelectric operations in 2016, network defenders and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)\nprofessionals should be especially attentive to high-confidence disclosures of activity linked\nto Sandworm.\n\n## Sandworm and Centreon\n\n[In early 2021, the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI)](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/)\nreleased a report on Sandworm-linked activity targeting IT monitoring software produced by\n[Centreon from late 2017 through 2020. Operations included deployment of the publicly](https://www.centreon.com/en/)\n[available P.A.S. webshell (specifically version 3.1.4), as well as Linux malware referred to](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/p-a-s-web-shell/)\n[by researchers at ESET as “Exaramel” which has only previously been linked to Sandworm](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/)\nactivity. While the former tool is widely available (although also deployed in other operations\nlinked to Russian intelligence services), the latter is exclusively tied to Sandworm-related\noperations, and features extensive code and functionality overlap with other Sandwormlinked tools, as described in ESET’s analysis.\n\nAlthough the focus on IT monitoring software suggests superficial overlaps with the\n[SolarWinds-related intrusion activity (tentatively linked to Russian intelligence operations) in](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/continuous-eruption-further-analysis-of-the-solarwinds-supply-incident)\n[2019, no evidence exists of a similar supply chain vector. Instead,](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-centreon-russia-hack/) [subsequent reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-sandworm-hackers-only-hit-orgs-with-old-centreon-software/)\nindicated older versions of the open source version of Centreon’s software were victimized\n[as part of this campaign. A statement from Centreon specified that version 2.5.2 of the](https://www.centreon.com/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/centreon-provides-clarification-following-the-publication-of-the-anssi-report/)\nsoftware, deprecated in 2014 and unsupported since 2016, was the latest version impacted.\n\n**SolarWinds Incident** **Centreon Activity**\n\n\nLikely exploitation of a vulnerability\nin older versions of centreon open\nsource software\n\n\n**Access**\n**Vector**\n\n\nDevelopment environment\ncompromise enabling distribution of\nmodified software\n\n\nLimited number of organizations\nrunning older variants of centreon\nsoftware; centreon not impacted\n\n\n**Victimology**\n\n\nSolarwinds itself, followed by\nmultiple organizations running\nsolarwinds orion software\n\n\nTechnical and other links to\nsandworm entity, linked to Russian\nmilitary intelligence (GRU)\n\n\n**Responsible**\n**Entity**\n\n\nPossible links to Russian\nintelligence operations, specifically\nthe Foreign Intelligence Service\n(SVR)\n\n\nWhile DomainTools cannot make a definitive determination, based on these details it\n[appears that the intruder likely used a vulnerability such as CVE-2014-3828, a SQL](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-3828/)\ninjection vulnerability in Centreon patched in version 2.5.3, to write data to the vulnerable\nsystem (such as a webshell) which could facilitate follow-on code execution within the victim\nenvironment Given details published by ANSSI in terms of webshell file paths (located\n\n\n-----\n\nunder /usr/local/centron/www/ and /usr/share/centreon/www/ directories) and user context\n[(the “apache” user, which references the Apache web server software used in Centreon](https://httpd.apache.org/)\ndeployments) along with the published CVE referenced, the most-likely path to exploitation\nappears to be compromise of a vulnerability in Centreon software as opposed to\ncompromise of Centreon itself.\n\nIn providing analysis of the Centreon exploitation activity, ANSSI outlines technical and\nbehavioral details observed, but little in the way of technical indicators. Specifically, the\nreport identifies no network infrastructure associated with the activity aside from a general\ncomment noting the use of VPN services to connect to webshell instances and a separate\nset of Command and Control (C2) nodes to communicate with Exaramel deployments.\n\nWhile this may appear limiting at first for further research, analysts can look to concurrent\nactivity linked to Sandworm to gain greater insight into how this threat may have operated\nduring the approximately three year long Centreon campaign.\n\n## Examining the Exim Campaign\n\nIn May 2020, the US National Security Agency (NSA) issued a brief report: “Sandworm\nActors Exploiting Vulnerability in Exim Mail Transfer Agent”. The report is notable for two\nreasons: First, the report explicitly identifies Sandworm as “the GRU Main Center for\nSpecial Technologies (GTsST), field post number 74455.” Second, and related to the ANSSI\nreport, the NSA details a campaign which overlaps with the Centreon activity, taking place\nfrom August 2019 through May 2020.\n\n[The campaign described by NSA involves exploitation of the Exim Mail Transfer Agent](https://www.exim.org/)\n(MTA) software. Used for transferring email between servers via SMTP, MTA software is\nnetwork-accessible by design, with Exim being the default MTA for many variants of Linux.\nThe vulnerability linked to Sandworm activity, [CVE-2019-10149, can allow for Remote Code](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2019-10149-critical-remote-command-execution-vulnerability-discovered-in-exim)\nExecution (RCE) on the vulnerable host depending on Exim’s configuration and if it is\nremotely accessible. If accessible, the Exim exploit can facilitate both initial access to victim\nnetworks as well as lateral movement to other servers with listening, accessible Exim MTA\ninstances.\n\nExploitation of this RCE vulnerability is relatively trivial. In the following image included from\nNSA reporting, Sandworm operations leveraged the exploit to retrieve a shell script from a\nremote resource and then execute it:\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, while the script s functions are described at a relatively high level in the\nreport, it does not provide in-depth detail. Although some of the network infrastructure used\nto execute these attacks is noted, this consists of only two IP addresses and a domain:\n```\n95.216.13[.]196\n103.94.157[.]5\nhostapp[.]be\n\n```\nAlthough apparently circumscribed, with historical network data including hosting records\nand passive DNS (pDNS), CTI analysts can begin identifying characteristics and\nfundamental aspects of this infrastructure during its period of use (August 2019 through\nMay 2020). To start, we can examine the domain. Of note, since “.be” is a country-level Top\nLevel Domain (TLD) associated with Belgium, the complete WhoIs record cannot (for legal\nreasons) be retrieved and archived by services such as DomainTools. Looking at the\ncurrent WhoIs information through the Belgian WhoIs service shows that, since the NSA’s\nreport, the domain has been re-registered:\n\nHowever, examining limited data archived via DomainTools, we can at least get an\nunderstanding of when the domain was first registered for use in the Exim campaign as well\nas limited infrastructure details:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile WhoIs registration information is not captured, we can still observe two\ncharacteristics of this infrastructure:\n\nRegistration via Tucows.\nAuthoritative name servers provided by Njalla.\n\nWhile fairly general characteristics shared by a number of suspicious domains, we at least\nnow have a better understanding of how this adversary was registering infrastructure, as\nwell as when: 24 December 2018. Examination of hosting information and pDNS records is\nmore fruitful:\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral items emerge from the above pDNS data:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The data confirms one of the IP addresses listed by NSA (95.216.13[.]196) was used\n\nto host hostapp[.]be during the operational window.\n2. The other IP address noted by NSA, 103.94.157[.]5, is not associated with\n\nhostapp[.]be in available pDNS data.\n3. Several additional, not previously disclosed IP addresses are also associated with the\n\ndomain.\n\nThe first point is useful, but the other two provide avenues for further research. Looking at\nthe IP not associated with the domain but linked by NSA with Exim exploitation, no firm\ndomain links appear except to the following item from May 2020 (approximately the same\ntime as the NSA report’s release) through January 2021:\n```\nMonitor.sbp[.]hk\n\n```\nThis specific resource does not resolve, but sbp[.]hk appears to be a template page for web\ndesign with no clear, legitimate functionality. However, the name does link to the hosting\nprovider, SBP Corporation, located in India. Overall, nothing of value appears related to this\nindicator at present.\n\nMore interesting are the previously undisclosed items linked to hostapp[.]be:\n```\n185.44.76[.]193\n94.75.193[.]239\n85.158.77[.]2\n145.14.133[.]105\n176.10.104[.]219\n\n```\nOf these, 176.10.104[.]219 appears most significant and responsible for the majority of\nresponses for hostapp[.]be from November 2019 to the end of December 2019. These\nitems are explored in greater detail in the following section. Notably, records cease linking to\nthe domain after 26 December 2019 until 28 May 2020—the same day the NSA report was\nreleased—when the domain shifts to various GoDaddy parking IP addresses.\n\nWhile the above research identified new, previously unobserved indicators correlated with\nSandworm operations, additional work is required to both understand these and cement any\nlinks with the notorious group.\n\n## Pivoting to New Indicators and Infrastructure\n\nReviewing all IP addresses identified thus far returns the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n**HostingHosting**\n\n**IP AddressIP Address** **Hosting ProviderHosting Provider** **LocationLocation** **Likely PurposeLikely Purpose**\n\n95.216.13[.]196 Hezner Online FI Domain hosting, Exim\nexploit\n\n103.94.157[.]5 SBP Corporation IN Exim exploit\n\n\n185.44.76[.]193 Hydra\nCommunications\n\n\nGB Domain hosting\n\n\n94.75.193[.]239 LeaseWeb NL Domain Hosting\n\n85.158.77[.]2 SIA SkaTVis LV Domain Hosting\n\n\n145.14.133[.]105 DA International\nGroup\n\n\nUS Domain Hosting\n\n\n176.10.104[.]219 Datasource AG CH Domain hosting, Exim\nexploit\n\nWhile there are several outliers, at least for the items most closely associated with Exim\nexploitation and hosting hostapp.be, Sandworm appears to favor European hosting\nproviders correlated with privacy-focused legal regimes or companies. While all of the\nabove items were hosted with hostapp.be at some point, the majority were only linked to the\ndomain for a day or two in November 2019, and their precise functionality is indeterminate\nwithout additional data.\n\nYet one of the IP addresses associated with Sandworm activity from July 2019 to early\nNovember 2019, 95.216.13[.]196, shows a link to a BASH shell script with the following\ncharacteristics:\n```\nMD5: 92d078d05e89c55b7bb7187fd1c53bdd\nSHA256: dc074464e50502459038ac127b50b8c68ed52817a61c2f97f0add33447c8f730\n\n```\nReview of this object shows immediate items of concern:\n\n\n-----\n\nReviewing this portion of the script, the following takes place:\n\nA new authorized key is added to the SSH configuration.\nA new root-level user, “mysql_db”, is created with a hard-coded password, and added\nas an allowed SSH user.\nThe script performs a check for the SSH listening port on the victim machine, and\nsends this back to 205.204.66[.]196 as a parameter.\n\nOf note, the IP address referenced, hosted by Netelligent in Canada, is also used in a script\nwith similar functionality as that above:\n```\nMD5: d61d598106b04520a018dfa58e707ab2\nSHA256: 538d713cb47a6b5ec6a3416404e0fc1ebcbc219a127315529f519f936420c80e\n\n```\nYet the first script identified contains further functionality that merits exploration. For\nexample, the following Python code, encoded as a base64 object, is decoded and executed\nwith the script, then added to the system crontab for weekly execution:\n\n\n-----\n\nFunctionality is somewhat straightforward:\n\n[Check for a running process named “Little Snitch,” an application firewall and](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html)\nconnection monitoring tool associated with MacOS; if found, the script exits.\nAttempt to connect to IP 95.216.13[.]196 via HTTP on port 8080 with a hardcoded\nUser Agent string and cookie value.\nDecode the response with a hard-coded encryption key, and execute the result.\n\nUnfortunately, DomainTools was unable to recover a payload from the IP address. However,\ntwo items stand out from the above steps:\n\n1. The script is designed to silently exit in the presence of network monitoring tools\n\nassociated with MacOS. While MacOS supports Exim, this is not a default item as\nMacOS uses Postfix instead.\n2. The script utilizes a User Agent value that would be associated with a Windows\n\nsystem, when Exim is a Linux/Unix application creating a mismatch in traffic visibility\nand expectations if examined.\n\nIn addition to this item, an additional encoded Python program is also embedded in the\nscript that executes on initial load and is added to a weekly crontab:\n\nThis item is somewhat simpler than the first:\n\nAgain create a hard-coded User Agent string, representative of a Windows system.\n\n\n-----\n\nInitiate a connection to 95.216.13[.]196 via HTTP over TCP 53 (normally associated\nwith DNS zone transfers).\nExecute the returned payload.\n\nAgain, DomainTools was unable to recover the payload in this instance. Both items,\nespecially given their addition to weekly crontab entries, appear designed for persistence,\neither downloading and executing some follow-on payload or sequence of commands.\nNonetheless, at this stage we have significantly enriched the original findings of the NSA\nreport on Exim activity, as well as identifying potential infrastructure tendencies linked to\nSandworm from July 2019 through at least December 2019.\n\nUnfortunately, we have not yet identified anything linking this campaign or its technical\nindicators to the Centreon-based intrusions. However, the information yielded in the above\ninvestigation can be used to cast our investigative net wider in search of infrastructure or\nother artifacts which may link back to Sandworm operations.\n\n## Identifying a Possible Linked Credential Theft Campaign\n\nAt this stage of analysis, we possess multiple IP addresses but still only one domain, and\ntwo scripting objects that link back to already-known infrastructure. One possible\ninfrastructure hunting hypothesis would be to look for similar domains registered in\napproximately the same period (December 2018). Searching for domains beginning with\n“hostapp” created in December 2018 returns interesting results:\n\n\n**Name**\n**Server** **Primary IP** **Primary Hosting**\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created** **Registrar**\n\n\nhostapp[.]art 11 Dec\n2018\n\nhostapp[.]link 20 Dec\n2018\n\n\nTucows Njalla 91.197.145[.]114 LTD KuMIR\nTELECOM\n\nTucows Njalla 77.47.193[.]36 Association of users\nof Ukrainian Research\n& Academic Network\nURAN\n\n\nIn addition to matching the pattern of hostapp[.]be in hosting, these items also link to\ninteresting subdomains, such as the following:\n```\ni.ua.account-check.hostapp[.]link\nfacebook.com.webapp.hostapp[.]art\ntwitter.com.webapp.hostapp[.]art\n\n```\nFurthermore, the IP addresses represent new observables that reveal additional domains\nwith similar subdomains spoofing a variety of mail and social media services:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile investigating this new path, DomainTools researchers identified another name\ncluster” created in December 2018 similar to the hostapp domains:\n```\nSpdup[.]art\nSpdup[.]be\nSpdup[.]info\n\n```\nAll registered on 22 December 2018 via Tucows and Njalla name servers, they also link to\nadditional IP addresses and subdomains:\n```\ngoogle-settings.spdup[.]be\npassport.www.mail.yandex.ru.spdup[.]be\naccounts.google-account-settings.spdup[.]art\ngoogle-settingsapi.spdup[.]info\n\n```\nA complete list of primary domains and associated IP addresses at time of use is provided\nin Appendices A and B, respectively. The precise functions of these items (and related\ninfrastructure) is not completely clear in all cases. Examination of some items does reveal\nspoofed logon pages which could be leveraged for credential capture. For example, the\n“passport.www.mail.yandex[.]ru” subdomain above resolved to the following spoofed logon\npage for Yandex as late as November 2019:\n\n\n-----\n\nReviewing subdomains overall, the primary emphasis appears to be spoofing services tied\nto Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Russia, with a handful of items that appear to have a general\nEuropean Union (EU) theme. For this latter observation, the following items appear\ninterspersed with more specific references to Russia or Ukraine:\n```\nyanoo.com.userarea[.]eu\ndrive.google.com.filepreview.auth.userarea[.]click\n\n```\nReviewing items linked in the appendices, some were active long after release of NSA’s\nExim report and potentially into early 2021. Yet the majority appear to have been detected\naround May or June 2020, and have been “sinkholed” on Amazon Web Services (AWS) IP\n52.45.178[.]122 or related addresses since.\n\n## Implications for Understanding Sandworm\n\nWhile the previous section appears to identify a cluster of activity adjacent to publicly\ndocumented Sandworm operations, such links—although likely given the persistence in\nnaming themes and sharing of hosting infrastructure—cannot be proved with available\ninformation. Nonetheless, in the process of expanding our view into known elements of\n\n\n-----\n\nadversary activity, we as CTI analysts have greatly expanded our view into likely related,\nconcurrent operations by a disruptive threat actor. While we identified a number of\nadditional indicators, we more critically delineated adversary behaviors:\n\nUnderstanding of Linux-environment alterations used by Sandworm for system\nmodification and persistence within the Exim campaign.\nIdentification of infrastructure hosting and registration tendencies within the timeframe\ncovered by both NSA and ANSSI reporting.\nUncovering a likely concurrent credential harvesting campaign linked to Sandworm\ninfrastructure with specific items targeting several Eastern European countries.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not succeed in achieving the goal we set out to satisfy: identifying\ninfrastructure associated with the Centreon exploitation activity documented by ANSSI. Yet\nalthough we failed in identifying specific infrastructure linked to this campaign, we did reveal\ntendencies which held during the 2017-2020 timeframe in which this campaign was active\nthat could be used by defenders and analysts to disposition possible Sandworm-related\nintrusions. For example, the combination of registration, name server, hosting, and domain\nnaming tendencies documented above and shown in the following appendices reveal\nadversary tendencies during the period of operation.\n\nOverall, the investigation above reveals several aspects linked to Sandworm-related activity,\nif not directly associated with GRU Unit 74455 (based on NSA and other government\nattribution statements):\n\nWidespread infrastructure creation with an emphasis on European hosting providers.\nDomain name tendencies that either reflect plausible items directly in root domains, or\nmimicking legitimate services through long subdomains.\nSignificant operations targeting Linux environments across both the Exim and\nCentreon campaigns, including the use of both Linux-specific malware (Exaramel\ndeployment) and native system commands (Exim post-exploitation activity).\nContinuous credential capture activity targeting a variety of email and social media\nservices, with an emphasis on Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Russia, but with unknown\nintentions and purpose.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStarting with revelations concerning Sandworm-linked activity targeting French IT\nmonitoring software, we identified certain overall adversary tendencies and intrusion\npossibilities leading to a previously-documented campaign leveraging a vulnerability in the\nExim MTA. Based on further in-depth analysis of this campaign, we revealed additional\ninfrastructure and adversary tendencies that shed light on a widespread credential\nharvesting campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile we failed in our initial goal of attempting to identify concrete links between the\nCentreon and Exim campaigns given their temporal overlap, we nonetheless succeeded in\nlearning significantly more about a deeply concerning adversary. Armed with this\nknowledge, network defenders and CTI analysts can mine internal data repositories and\nexternal information sources for further links or to disposition prior intrusions now\nilluminated with these discoveries.\n\nBy applying the investigative and enrichment techniques detailed above with respect to\nSandworm to other threats of interest, we can gain greater insight into fundamental\nadversary tradecraft and tendencies. Equipped with this insight, defenders and CTI\nprofessionals can then more accurately or efficiently research and prosecute intrusions by\nhaving the background knowledge necessary to appropriately categorize and understand\nidentified intrusions and their related artifacts.\n\n## Appendix A: Linked Domains\n\n\n**Primary IP**\n**Address**\n\n\n**Domain** **Registrar**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created**\n\n\nappservice[.]site PublicDomainRegistry 10 Jan 2019 193.200.209[.]200\n\napse[.]xyz PublicDomainRegistry 28 Aug 2018 91.197.145[.]114\n\nbase64encode[.]ml Freenom 3 Sept 2018 74.119.219[.]82\n\nbg-abvmail[.]ga Freenom 26 Aug 2018 141.8.224[.]221\n\n\nbg-abvmail[.]pw EPAG\nDomainServices\n\n\n2 Oct 2018 78.130.144[.]40\n\n\ncacheappfb[.]cf Freenom 10 Aug 2018 91.205.6[.]143\n\nchecklogin[.]in Tucows 30 Aug 2018 78.130.144[.]40\n\nfbapp[.]info Tucows 24 Dec 2018 46.4.10[.]58\n\nfbapp[.]link Tucows 24 Dec 2018 68.235.34[.]235\n\nfbapp[.]top Tucows 24 Dec 2018 46.151.81[.]242\n\nfbsocialnet[.]ga Freenom 6 Nov 2018 91.205.6[.]143\n\ngreatbookbase[.]com PublicDomainRegistry 9 Jun 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\ngreatupdate[.]net PublicDomainRegistry 1 Jun 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\nhostapp[.]art Tucows 11 Dec 2018 91.197.145[.]114\n\n\n-----\n\n**Primary IP**\n**Address**\n\n\n**Domain** **Registrar**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created**\n\n\nHostapp[.]be Tucows 24 Dec 2018 176.10.104[.]219\n\nhostapp[.]link Tucows 20 Dec 2018 77.47.193[.]36\n\nkyev[.]net NameSilo 24 Dec 2018 185.226.67[.]190\n\nlogin[.]photography PublicDomainRegistry 18 Oct 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\nlogin-site[.]online NameSilo 18 Oct 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\nmalamsenin[.]xyz West263 25 Dec 2019 72.52.179[.]175\n\nmemcached[.]cc NameSilo 28 Aug 2018 193.106.29[.]250\n\nmemcached[.]in PublicDomainRegistry 21 Sep 2018 91.197.145[.]114\n\nnsoxt[.]com NameSilo 11 Dec 2018 193.200.209[.]200\n\nspdup[.]art Tucows 21 Dec 2018 89.108.72[.]196\n\nspdup[.]be Tucows 22 Dec 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\nspdup[.]info Tucows 22 Dec 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\nthehomeofbaseball[.]com PublicDomainRegistry 5 June 2018 77.47.193[.]36\n\nupdatenote[.]net NameSilo 4 June 2018 46.28.202[.]254\n\nupdatenote[.]tk Freenom 14 May 2017 78.130.144[.]40\n\nuserarea[.]click Tucows 18 Nov 2019 91.195.240[.]117\n\nuserarea[.]eu Tucows 13 Nov 2019 185.226.67[.]190\n\nuserarea[.]in Tucows 13 Nov 2019 5.255.90[.]243\n\nuserarea[.]top Tucows 14 Nov 2019 194.117.236[.]33\n\nwebcache[.]one Tucows 13 Nov 2019 195.211.197[.]25\n\nworkbench[.]run NameSilo 21 Sep 2018 91.197.145[.]114\n\n## Appendix B: Identified IP Addresses\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Location**\n\n\n**Start**\n**Activity**\n\n\n**End**\n**Activity**\n\n\n**IP Address**\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hosting**\n**Location**\n\n\n**Start**\n**Activity**\n\n\n**End**\n**Activity**\n\n\n**IP Address**\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider**\n\n\n103.94.157[.]5 SBP Corporation IN May 2020 Aug 2020\n\n119.252.189[.]49 ZoneNetworks AU Aug 2018 Aug 2018\n\n176.10.104[.]219 Datasource AG CH Dec 2019 Dec 2019\n\n176.31.225[.]204 OVH FR Jan 2018 Jun 2018\n\n185.226.67[.]190 Aweb GR Oct 2019 Oct 2020\n\n185.44.67[.]193 Hydra GB Jul 2019 Jul 2019\n\n193.200.209[.]200 Infium UA Jan 2019 Dec 2019\n\n194.117.236[.]33 MyserverMedia RO Mar 2020 Nov 2020\n\n195.211.197[.]25 Tomich RU Mar 2020 Nov 2020\n\n205.204.66[.]196 Netelligent CA Jul 2019 Dec 2019\n\n31.148.63[.]236 FlashInternet UA Oct 2019 Dec 2019\n\n46.151.81[.]242 BigNet UA Jun 2019 Dec 2019\n\n46.161.40[.]16 WS171 RU Oct 2019 Oct 2019\n\n46.28.202[.]254 Solarcom CH Nov 2018 Dec 2019\n\n46.4.10[.]58 Hetzner DE Jun 2019 May 2020\n\n5.255.90[.]243 Serverius NL Feb 2020 Jun 2020\n\n68.235.34[.]235 Tzulo US Jan 2019 Dec 2019\n\n77.47.193[.]36 NTUU UA Oct 2018 Dec 2019\n\n78.130.144[.]40 Cooolbox BG Oct 2018 Jun 2019\n\n78.25.21[.]3 Alkar UA Jun 2019 Jun 2019\n\n79.124.75[.]234 Telepoint BG Feb 2019 May 2019\n\n85.158.77[.]2 SIA \"SkaTVis\" LV Nov 2019 Nov 2019\n\n87.230.102[.]40 PlusServer DE Aug 2018 Apr 2019\n\n89.108.72[.]196 Agava3 RU Jan 2019 Dec 2019\n\n91.197.145[.]114 Kumir UA Nov 2018 Jun 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hosting**\n**Location**\n\n\n**Start**\n**Activity**\n\n\n**End**\n**Activity**\n\n\n**IP Address**\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider**\n\n\n91.205.6[.]143 Sunline UA Aug 2018 Oct 2018\n\n92.62.139[.]114 Baltneta LT Mar 2020 Oct 2020\n\n94.75.193[.]239 LeaseWeb NL Nov 2019 Nov 2019\n\n95.216.13[.]196 Hetzner FI Jul 2019 Nov 2019\n\n\n-----",
