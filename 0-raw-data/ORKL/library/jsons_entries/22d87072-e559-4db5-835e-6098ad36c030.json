The attack](https://www.fidelissecurity.com/TradeSecret)\nagainst the NFTC site has been dubbed ‘Operation TradeSecret’ by Fidelis and is seen as an\nattempt to gain insight into individuals closely associated with U.S trade policy activities.\n\nFidelis is attributing the Operation TradeSecret attack to a group that is also known in the\nsecurity research community as APT10 and Stone Panda. The same attack group has also\nbeen recently actively attacking government sites in the U.K and Japan in an attack that\nPWC UK and BAE Systems refers to as, [Operation CloudHopper.](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html)\n\nWith Operation TradeSecret, the attackers were able to infiltrate the NFTC site and embed\nmalware on several registration pages. The malware used is identified by Fidelis as being\nthe Scanbox reconnaissance framework. The Scanbox malware is used by attackers to gain\ninsight into victim’s activities and information. According to Fidelis, the attack ran from\nFebruary 27 to March 1 of this year. John Bambenek, Threat Systems Manager at Fidelis\nsaid that his company has informed the NFTC of the incident.\n\n“At a high-level, this method of attack is common and has been seen against the defense\nindustrial base and telecoms by APT10 for many years,” Bambenek told eWEEK.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom a detection perspective, Bambenek explained that Fidelis security tools are informed\nby the company’s threat intelligence team, a portion of which is dedicated to nation-state\nadversaries.\n\n“Those tools derive an immense amount of metadata about every session, so that we can\nfind distinct fingerprints that point to a specific actor,” Bambenek said. “We are also able to\napply intelligence retroactively, so as we discover new threats we can look backwards weeks\nand months to see if attacks have been successful in the past.”\n\nFrom an attribution perspective for the new Operation TradeSecret campaign, there are a\nnumber of attributes that clearly point the finger at Chinese nation-state attackers. Bambenek\ncommented that Scanbox is a tool exclusively seen previously being used by Chinese\nnation-state sponsored actors.\n\n“The specific obfuscation and other techniques in this instance have been used in the past\nonly by APT10,” Bambenek said. “It is possible that another actor somehow got their hands\non these tools and are mimicking the techniques, but it is not likely.”\n\nAt this point, it’s not entirely clear how the Operation TradeSecret attackers were actually\nable to infiltrate the NFTC site and embed the Scanbox malware. Bambenek commented\nthat Fidelis can only speculate as to how this happened to their website. That said he noted\nthat in general terms, there are a number of different things organizations can use to help\ndefend themselves.\n\nBambenek recommends that organizations use a strong web-application firewall (WAF) to\nprevent against attacks on their webserver and database layer and have integrity monitoring\non webpages to detect unauthorized changes. Additionally, he suggests that organizations\nwork with their peers in the industry to share threat data, so that soft targets around\ngovernment can collaboratively protect themselves against foreign intelligence services.\n\n\n-----",
