The\nsix domains are:\n\nmy-iri.org\n\nhudsonorg-my-sharepoint.com\n\nsenate.group\n\n\n-----\n\nadfs-senate.services\nadfs-senate.email\noffice365-onedrive.com\n\nThe first domain was registered to look like a domain for the International Republican\nInstitute, which promotes democratic principles. The second was registered to mimic the\nHudson Institute, an organization known for its discussions on election cybersecurity. The\nlast four were blatant attempts at mimicking domains part of the US Senate's IT\ninfrastructure. Microsoft said it notified all three organizations.\n\n## Microsoft has now taken over 84 APT28 domains\n\nBased on their format, the domains were most likely supposed to be used as part of spearphishing operations.\n\nMicrosoft says it managed to gain ownership of the domains before they were used in any\nattacks.\n\nThe OS maker said this was the twelfth time they used a court order to take control of\ndomains they believed to be associated with APT28's attack infrastructure. Smith said they\nhave now taken control of 84 APT28 domains in the last two years.\n\n\"Despite last week's steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and\nother sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks\n[across the political spectrum in the United States,\" Smith said. \"Taken together, this pattern](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/we-are-taking-new-steps-against-broadening-threats-to-democracy/)\nmirrors the type of activity we saw prior to the 2016 election in the United States and the\n2017 election in France.\"\n\nLast week, Reuters [reported that the FBI was investigating cyber-attacks on the](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-hacking-exclusive/exclusive-fbi-probing-cyber-attack-on-congressional-campaign-in-california-sources-idUSKBN1L22BZ)\ncongressional campaign of a Democratic candidate in California, albeit there's no evidence\nthat Microsoft's intervention is tied to that investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in mid-July, Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President for Customer\nSecurity and Trust, Microsoft, said Microsoft had blocked at the time the first cyber-attacks\non the US 2018 midterm elections.\n\n[In May this year, the FBI also intervened in a similar fashion to take control of domains that](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-takes-control-of-apt28s-vpnfilter-botnet/)\nthe APT28 group was using to control the VPNFilter IoT botnet.\n\n## Microsoft officially launches AccountGuard service\n\nWhile announcing Microsoft's intervention to take down the six APT28 domains, Smith also\n[announced the launch of the AccountGuard service designed to help US election and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/protecting-democracy-with-microsoft-accountguard/)\ncampaign entities secure their IT infrastructure against nation-state attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nBleeping Computer first broke the story about Microsoft s new AccountGuard service at the\n[start of the month —more details here.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-accountguard-service-offers-protection-for-political-and-election-orgs/)\n\nAfter Microsoft revealed its takeover of the six APT28 domains, Google also issued a\n[security advisory on its blog about the dangers of government-backed phishing operations.](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/08/a-reminder-about-government-backed.html)\nLast week, Google added support for controlling the behavior of \"Government backed\nattacks\" alerts inside the G Suite service.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft takes down APT28 domains used in attacks against Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-takes-down-apt28-domains-used-in-attacks-against-ukraine/)\n\n[Microsoft finds severe bugs in Android apps from large mobile providers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-finds-severe-bugs-in-android-apps-from-large-mobile-providers/)\n\n[Microsoft to force better security defaults for all Azure AD tenants](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-force-better-security-defaults-for-all-azure-ad-tenants/)\n\n[Microsoft: Windows 11 22H2 has reached RTM with build 22621](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-11-22h2-has-reached-rtm-with-build-22621/)\n\n[DuckDuckGo browser allows Microsoft trackers due to search agreement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-browser-allows-microsoft-trackers-due-to-search-agreement/)\n\n[APT28](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt28/)\n[Cyber-espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Government](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/government/)\n[Microsoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[Senate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/senate/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.

However, since the DNC never allowed any security agency to inspect their\nservers, there is no actual PROOF that the Russians had anything to do with the\nrelease of the Clinton and Podesta emails, and it is just as likely that the emails were\nleaked by a person working for the Clinton campaign.\n\n[dogood76 - 3 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1102603/dogood76/)\n\nCrowdStrike performed an analysis confirming DNC server infiltration\n(https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-nationalcommittee/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[herbman - 3 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/827130/herbman/)\n\nLisa Page testified under oath 3 weeks ago that the whole Russia narrative was\ncompletely made up, Russians were never involved in any hacking and claimed her\nFBI superiors made her cover up the fact that Russia was never involved.\n\nShe also testified that her superiors purposely altered top secret documents to make\nsure they covered their tracks .\n\nOf course the main stream media never reported it and will continue to not report it.\n\n[Warthog-Fan - 3 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/839020/warthog-fan/)\n\nYes. And now the MSM wants to protect us from \"Fake News\" by trying to suppress\nindependent creators on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. They call everyone else\n\"nazis\" but they seem to be using the same techniques that the Nazis used to control\nthe media and suppress dissent.\n\nPost a Comment [Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
