This is the latest tool developed by attackers behind operation\n[Shrouded Crossbow, which have produced other BIFROSE variants such as KIVARS and](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-targeted-attack-group-buys-bifrose-code-works-in-teams/)\nKIVARS x64. [UNIX-based operating systems are widely used in servers, workstations, and](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3028066/linux/half-a-dozen-ways-to-look-at-unix-processes.html)\neven mobile devices. With a lot of highly confidential data found in these servers and\ndevices, a UNIX version of BIFROSE can certainly be classified as a threat.\n\n**Capable Hands**\n\nBIFROSE has been updated by Shrouded Crossbow specifically for the campaigns they\npursue. Some of their victims have already been compromised by both Windows and UNIX\nversions of BIFROSE. Historically, Shrouded Crossbow has used BIFROSE to target\nprivatized government agencies, government offices, and government contractors, as well as\ncompanies in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financial industries.\n\nBIFROSE\nEvolution\nUnder\nShrouded\nCrossbow\n\n2004 [BIFROSE was developed by ksv as a trojan known to have infected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifrost_(Trojan_horse))\nWindows 95 through Windows 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n2010 Shrouded Crossbow developed KIVARS 2010 – Dropped by malware\ndetected as TROJ_FAKEWORD.A (SHA1\n218be0da023e7798d323e19e950174f53860da15) and only affects 32-bit\nsystems Only encrypts the “MZ” magic byte for the backdoor payload\n\n2013 Shrouded Crossbow developed KIVARS x64 Can work in 32-bit and 64-bit\nenvironments Payload is now encrypted using the modified RC4\n\n2014 Shrouded Crossbow developed UNIX BIFROSE\n\n**UNIX BIFROSE**\n\nUNIX BIFROSE was created after the Shrouded Crossbow rewrote BIFROSE and compiled\nit into an Executable and Link Format (ELF) which is a standard executable file for UNIX and\nUNIX-like systems. Its code is completely changed compared to the Windows version, but\nstill having almost the same protocol and command-and-control (C&C) commands. Both\nWindows and UNIX versions can communicate with the original Bifrost C&C server. One big\ndifference between the Windows and UNIX version is that UNIX BIFROSE has less backdoor\nfunctions compared to the original BIFROSE.\n\n**PHONE HOME PACKETS FOR UNIX AND WINDOWS**\n\nUNIX\n\n<victim IP>|unix|<hostname>|<username>|5.0.0.0|0|1|1|0|575|0|0|0|0|None|||||\n\nWindows\n\n<victim IP>|default_zz|<hostname>|\n<username>|2.0.0a||1|-1|0|2600|1|1|0|0|982bc1da|C:\\Documents and\nSettings\\Administrator\\Recent|C:\\Documents and\nSettings\\Administrator\\Desktop|C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\My\nDocuments|US|00000409|\n\nIn the phone home packet, BIFROSE will register with a default assigned name on C&C. The\ndefault name for the Windows version of BIFROSE is default_zz, whereas for UNIX, the\ndefault name is unix. The attacker can easily change these names at a later time. The initial\nmalware installed will be 2.0.0a for Windows, and 5.0.0.0. for UNIX. The Windows version,\nonce connected to the c&c server, will contain the disk serial number, locale, and keyboard\nlayout that identifies the victims and helps the attackers manage the tools needed for the\nattack. The However, the previously mentioned information will not be available for the UNIX\nversion.\n\nUNIX BIFROSE also provides a “create remote shell” which is perfect for skilled attackers\nwho are familiar with the UNIX system.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. “create remote shell” command for UNIX BIFROSE_\n\n**Malware Crossing Platforms**\n\nAfter testing the UNIX BIFROSE version, we figured out that it has no problem\ncommunicating with the BIFROSE server console used by the original BIFROSE (the\nWindows version). Our research indicates that a network can be infected by both Windows\nand UNIX versions of the malware. This ensures that regardless of OS used by the victim,\nthe threat actor is ready and able to capture and communicate with any server.\n\nWith BIFROSE used as a component for recent targeted attacks, we studied the new variant\nto see its strength in a sustained attack. UNIX BIFROSE can be used in the lateral\nmovement phase of a targeted attack. It can be deployed to control a Linux server in the\nvictim’s network. It can also find other vulnerable Linux units which it can infect to sustain the\nattack further.\n\nWhile half of the threat of UNIX BIFROSE falls on its capabilities, the other half falls on\nShrouded Crossbow’s capability to create tools such as updated versions of BIFROSE.\n\nAs far as which platform BIFROSE will move to next, it will not be a matter of time. Instead, it\nwill be a matter of need. If Shrouded Crossbow needs BIFROSE for iOS or Android, it is\npossible, even if they have to rewrite the code. And looking at how they were able to create\nUNIX BIFROSE, an OS X version may not be far off.\n\n**Implications on Enterprises**\n\nUpon the first signs of abnormal activities, such as those seen through network and mail\nlogs, IT admins must be prepared and quick to respond. As we’ve mentioned in our past\npost, [7 Places to Check for Signs of a Targeted Attack in Your Network, network activities](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/7-places-to-check-for-signs-of-a-targeted-attack-in-your-network/)\nsuch as logins and emails during “abnormal” times need to be checked.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen enterprises face targeted attacks, they have to apply the same attention and focus on\ntheir own network to detect intrusions and anomalies and respond appropriately. Network\n[defense platforms like Trend Micro Deep Discovery,](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/) [Deep Security, and](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/cloud-solutions/deep-security/)\n[ServerProtect enable IT admins to detect, analyze and respond to these kinds of threats.](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/cloud-solutions/server-protection/)\nThey can detect BIFROSE behaviors such as malicious behavior, command-and-control\ncommunications, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.\n\nHere are the hashes for ELF_BIFROSE.ZTDA and their C&C servers:\n\nSHA1 C&C\n\n3d3bb509f307db97630c297bdb985c83d8a40951 103.246.247.103 202.133.245.251\n\n5d8b228e3014b4eb579e380b3a1113dd8c0d999a 58.64.185.12\n\nMalware\n\nWe came across a variant of the BIFROSE malware rewritten for UNIX and UNIX-like\nsystems. This is the latest tool from the attackers behind operation Shrouded Crossbow,\nwhich have produced other BIFROSE variants such as KIVARS and KIVARS x64.\n\nBy: Razor Huang March 01, 2016 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----",
