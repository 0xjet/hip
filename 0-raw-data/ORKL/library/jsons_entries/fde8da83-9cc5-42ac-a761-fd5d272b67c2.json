In this monthly overview, I\nwill briefly describe the geopolitical tension between states and the reported cyber\ncampaigns by the alleged nation-states by sharing actionable indicators of compromise\n(IOC’s). In this month’s overview, IOC’s from nation-state threat actors were selected that\noriginate from Palestine, India, and Pakistan, by basically searching for the keywords “apt“\n\n\n-----\n\nand **_c2: over the collected Twitter data from May 2021. The reported IOC s have not been_**\nexamined yet and are therefore weakly anchored with evidence. But let’s explore the Twitter\nthreat intelligence a bit further.\n\n## Middle East\n\nFigure 1: Israel and its direct neighbors\nAt the beginning of May 2021, escalations between Israel and Palestine (Hamas) resulted in\nmore than 3,440 rockets were fired towards Israeli cities. The dispute resulted in multiple\n[casualties on both sides. The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) reported that it also disrupted](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/how-does-the-idf-use-cyber-defense-systems-against-hamas-threats-668677)\nHamas cyber capabilities. As every physical dispute also has its cyber counterpart, the\n[following campaign was observed by the alleged Palestinian threat actor dubbed APT-C-23](https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g=Desert%20Falcons)\nor Desert Viper by Kaspersky.\n```\n\"#APT #APT-C-23 #micropsia 2021_05_30 About the Palestine-Israel Conflict in May\nhash：d82e23359a756affdadc194b0a4271bf8a05c1a5755185567a4595bed6bd8106 \nfilename:The unity of the people, the cause and the land docx.exe \nC2:haleymartinez[.]me \nhttps://t.co/8FQwjt4UHw\"\n\n```\nSome other samples were also shared on Twitter:\n```\nfilename:Questions about the study of freedoms 78639846 docx.exe \nhash: 7833c0f413c1611f7281ac303bcef4b3 \nfilename:The Palestinian Charter of Honor the Palestinian labor sector - docx.exe \nhash: 6af6b474f627e8fff757060d3e39a2b6 \nfilename:Biden assures US allies he will reverse Trump docx.exe hash:\nb774dae8ebaa3b952dacaafa91871be3\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## India\n\nFigure 2: India and China clash at the border June 15, 2020 (graphic NYT)\n[Since last year the geopolitical border escalations between India and China resulted in high](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484)\ntensions with many trade issues and banning certain Chinese apps in India. As India is also\na growing power in the Asia-Pacific region, they have also matured their cyber operations in\nthe past years. The following nation-state cyber actor groups are alleged to be Indian and\nhave been detected by security researchers in May 2021.\n\n## Sidewinder APT group\n\nThe [Sidewinder APT group has been observed since 2012 and targets mainly military](https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g=SideWinder%2C%20Rattlesnake)\ntargets.\n```\n\"Today our researchers have found new rtf sample which belongs to #SideWinder #APT\ngroup \nITW:344b7370c6e61812eeb1cf1d737f27f3 \nTopic: Building Port Resilience Against Pandemics C2:pmaesa[.]bahariafoundation[.]org\nhttps://t.co/WUlmCTFGL7\"\n\n```\n[The lure document was taken from the following website.](https://tft.unctad.org/port-management/building-port-resilience/)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n Today our researchers have found old #SideWinder #APT group sample which target at\nChina ITW:9016ed3c0fef18cfef81f71953e77572 \nfilename:poly pending orders.doc \nC2:cdn-gov[.]net  \nhttps://t.co/WwYarEWWce\"\n\n## Bitter APT Group\n\n```\nThe [Bitter APT group leveraged a zero-day exploit this year and targeted China, Pakistan,](https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g=Bitter)\nand Saudi Arabia in different market sectors.\n```\n\"#APT #BITTER #Malwarename:rftg.msi md5:72ff5729200a86d7d0e83dbfca87721b \ndownload url:hxxp://sbss.com.pk/img/rftg.msi C2:http://helpdesk.autodefragapp[.]com \nC2 url:http://helpdesk.autodefragapp[.]com/dFFrt3856ByutTs/xnb/data1.php?\nid=WORK&amp;&amp;user=adminZxxZWindows7Professional\"\n\n## Pakistan\n\n```\n[Figure 3: Pakistan and its neighbors (graphic courtesy Publicintelligence)](https://publicintelligence.net/dia-new-great-game/)\nPakistan and India have many geopolitical issues together, many also originating from the\ndisputed region of Kashmir or the known Mumbai terrorist attack from 2008. From a cyber\nperspective, the alleged nation-state actor that belongs to Pakistan is dubbed Transparent\nTribe or APT36. The group has been observed in campaigns against Indian diplomatic and\n\n\n-----\n\n[military resources. Cisco s Talos threat intelligence unit also shared an in-depth analysis of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\nthe TransParentTribe group in May. They shared that the group leveraged a new malware\ncapability called ObligueRat, besides the already known CrimsonRat malware.\n\nFor example, in May 2021, the following campaigns were shared on Twitter.\n```\n\"Today our researchers have found sample which belongs to #TranSparentTribe #APT\ngroup ITW:cb27d0bd9a97e053f3fbfcf4bba8b8fc\nfilename:Ultimate-File.docm \nC2:134.119.181.142:6672  \nhttps://t.co/Ubnge6ThhR\"\n\"Today our reseachers have found #oblique implant which belongs to #TransparentTribe\n#APT group \nUpload:NL \nITW:e98510e1252e7dd99012b23a400bb00b \nfilename: program.exe \nC2:185.117.73.222:3344  \nhttps://t.co/xcraPu8HvQ\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\n```\nTwitter seems a valuable source leveraged by security researchers to share threat\nintelligence on ongoing nation-state operations. In May 2021, many potential campaigns\nfrom different nation-state actors were reported on Twitter by security researchers or threat\nhunters in areas with geopolitical tensions. A brief overview of some of these actors for May\nwas outlined. Further research needs to be conducted if these IOCs can indeed be anchored\nto these aforementioned nation-states and understand more about their operations and\nvictims. In the next article, I will further assess one or two potential interesting malware\nsamples covered in this article to determine if tracking for such an actor can be improved or\nto gain a better understanding of their operations. Until next time and sharing is caring!\n\n\n-----",
