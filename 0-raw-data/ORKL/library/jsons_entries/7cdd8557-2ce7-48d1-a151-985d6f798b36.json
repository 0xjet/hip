It is also known\nas Sofacy **Group (by Kaspersky) or STRONTIUM (by Microsoft) and it’s used to target**\nAereospace, Defence, Governmente Agencies, International Organizations and Media.\n\nToday I’d like to share some personal notes after few years of collected evidences and\nreadings on that topic.\n\n## Attack Timeline\n\nThe following timeline tracks APT28 back to 2008 and gives us a quick view on how big and\norganized is the threat group over the past decade.\n\nAPT28 Timeline\n[According to the many analyses made by Unit42 (available HERE), FireEye (HERE,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/?search_field=sofacy&pg=1) [HERE)](https://blog.cybersecuritylaw.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FireEye-Russias-Cyber-Espionage-Report.pdfhttps://blog.cybersecuritylaw.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FireEye-Russias-Cyber-Espionage-Report.pdf)\n[and TALOS (HERE,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/one-year-later-vpnfilter-catastrophe.html) [HERE ) we might agree that APT28 has been very active (or at least](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/10/cyber-conflict-decoy-document.html)\nvery “spotted”) during the time frame between 2012 to 2019. However most of the new\nattacks, qualitative speaking, happened during the time frame between 2018 to 2019. For\n\n\n-----\n\nthat reason it would be interesting to analyze how they ve evolved over such a time frame in\norder to understand their change and their principal characteristics. From what I’ve tracked\nand from what I’ve read over the past few years it looks like APT28 changed in many areas,\nbut today I’d like to focus mostly on the following three main areas: Weaponization,\n**Delivery, Installation. Let’s discuss one to one those areas.**\n\n## Weaponization\n\nWeaponization is a PRE-ATT&CK technique. It is classified as the operations needed to build\nand/or to prepare a complex attack. In other words all the infrastructures, the samples, the\ncommand and controls, the domains and IPs, the certificate, the libraries and, general\nspeaking, all the operations that come before the attack phase in term of environments.\nIntelligence, humanInt, information gathering, informal test and so on, are not included in\nWeaponization since coming directly into the ATT&CK framework.\n\nWeaponization Timeline\nObserving the weaponization timeline it turns out there are three main blocks with few\nshared characteristics. For example from 2017 to early 2018 APT28 used specific\n[techniques such as: T1251,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1251/) [T1329,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1329/) [T1336 and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1336/) [T1319. Those techniques are mainly focused](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1319/)\non external – outsourcing (except for T1319) skills-set. Indeed acquiring 3rd parties\ninfrastructures or Installing and configure hardware networks-systems and the usage of third\nparty obfuscation libraries would definitely highlight a human resource depletion or the clear\nintent of false flag. On the other hand during early 2018 to mid-2018 the weaponization chain\n[changed a lot moving to T1314,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1314/) [T1322 and to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1322/) [T1328. Those techniques enforced the idea](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1328/)\nthe group moved from external professional resources and from hardware localized\ntechniques to internal professional resources (indeed they started buy own domain for\npropagation and C2) . Finally from October 2018 to late march 2019 APT28 introduced a\n[totally different weaponization technique: the T1345. It is not a direct consequence to the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1345/)\nprevious observed techniques, actually we might think they improved or forked an internal\ndev team. Those self-developing capabilities (implemented by T1345) were not observed\nduring the past years and highlight a slightly significant change. We might think they enrolled\na dedicated dev-team or they forked the actual one by running on two different paths.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delivery\n\nDelivery is the way attackers deploy the initial content to the victim. In other words how the\nadversary reach his victim by starting the infection chain. On one hand the delivery vector is\noften the only (or the first) artifact (such as: a Malware, a Link or exploit kit usage) that the\ncybersecurity analyst could observe. Unfortunately very often analysts don’t have the\npossibility to track every single attack phase but they can just observe a small “portion” of it,\nand very often that “portion” is the “delivered artifact”. Tracking the changes on Delivery\nwould help cybersecurity analysts to build up the idea about threat actors by comparing\nlikeness and differences in coding, styling and techniques. Indeed the delivery phase is a\nspecial key point to distinguish threat actors which usually tend to specialize their crafting\ncapabilities over time rather than pivoting their capabilities on new delivery vectors. The\nfollowing timeline shows how the delivery changed over the analyzed time frames.\n\nDelivery Timeline\nWhile in the previous section (weaponization section), three were the main macro blocks, in\n[the delivery section everything looks like uniform and quite flat based on technique T1193:](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/)\nSpearphishing with a malicious attachment. But if we focus on the beginning of 2018 it looks\n[like APT28 was using a more consolidated intelligence technique (T1376) by focusing on](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1376/)\nHuman Intelligence in order to grab precious information used to deliver a well-crafted email\ncampaign (government institutions related to foreign affairs). The delivery phase, at such\ntime, was implementing a quite sophisticated dropper technology by exploiting vulnerabilities\nto “save and run” the payload in the desired place. The most exploited vulnerabilities by\nAPT28 have been tracked as follows:\n```\nCVE-2017-0144, CVE-2013-3897, CVE-2014-1776, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2015-5119,\nCVE-2013-3906, CVE-2015-7645, CVE-2015-2387, CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2015-1641,\nCVE-2013-1347, CVE-2015-3043, CVE-2015-1642, CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-1701,\nCVE-2015-4902, CVE-2017-0262, CVE-2017-0263\nCVE-2014-4076, CVE-2014-0515\n\n```\nThe most used tracked vulnerabilities are mainly focused on: “Windows”, “Adobe Flash” and\n“Oracle” Technologies. During the past few months (almost one year from time writing) it was\npossible to observe a quick increment over Microsoft Office Vulnerabilities in order to drop\nsecond stages of payloads. This perfectly fits the new trend and the current infection chains.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Installation\n\nWhile system persistence could be guaranteed in many different ways, for example by\nperiodically exploiting a RCE vulnerability, persistence in case of Malware attacks is typically\nnamed: “Installation”. Since the main findings that I had analyzed for this post are Malware\nbased, it makes sense to talk about Installation rather than talking about persistence.\nMoreover the installation procedure runs a key role into the infection chain. Observing the\ninstallation KPI would be meaningful to understand the developer team behind software,\nsince developer teams do not like to change installation procedures over time because they\nused to focus on new features and/or to improve existing modules rather than change\ninstallation frameworks. The following timeline shows how Installation procedures changed\nover time on APT28 folks.\n\nInstallation Timeline\nThe observed time frame is focused on the past year since where the most interesting\nchanges happened, at least in my personal opinion. Let’s start by observing that in early\n[2018 the most used techniques were: T1055,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/) [T1045,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045/) [T1064,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064/) [T1158 and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1158/) [T1037. Most of the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/)\nused techniques belong to the “Scripting” world. In other words the most influential\ncapabilities were based on Logon Scripts and JS/WB scripintg. From ~mid 2018 they group\n[moves mostly on PowerShell scripting language (T1086 and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/) [T1140) widely used over the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\npast two years (rif. [HERE) ending up in early 2019 to advanced development techniques](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/in/security/news/security-technology/risks-under-the-radar-understanding-fileless-threats)\nsuch as: [T1221,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/) [T1204,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) [T1045,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045/) [T1047,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/) [T1112, which underline a quite interesting new](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\ndevelpment skillset.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAs many groups are, APT28 is evolving over time. The group evolution is changing many\nTTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) but this time I decided to focus on: Installation,\n**Delivery and Weaponization. Most of the tracked evolution indexes happened during the**\nlast one/two years showing a quick skill-sets enhancement on development, obfuscation and\nevasion techniques.\n\n\n-----",
