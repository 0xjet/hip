Stop privilege escalation by fixing these key AD and group\npolicy misconfigurations.\n\nRansomware has struck every type of organization around the world. It's changed\ndramatically, too, entering the enterprise from nearly every angle, with attackers leveraging\nstolen data by posting it on the internet to force victims to pay. In most cases (see\nSolarWinds and XingLocker), Active Directory (AD) is targeted so the attacker can easily\ndistribute the ransomware after obtaining domain privileges. There are, however, ways to\nhelp secure Active Directory to prevent ransomware from succeeding.\n\nDistinct areas within Active Directory can be secured, which will increase the overall security\nof the enterprise and reduce the security risk at the same time. Specifically, the following\nsettings around AD objects can be secured. Here's how:\n\nMisconfigurations of user attributes need to be fixed\nMisconfigurations of groups need to be fixed\nPrivileged groups need to be cleaned up\nAD processes need to have correct configurations (e.g. SDProp)\nService principal names (SPNs) need to be secured (shown in Figure 1)\nTrust relationships need to be correct and secured\nSidHistory attribute needs to be cleaned up for users\n\n_Figure 1. User account with Service Principal Name (SPN)_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, AD itself and group policy can be secured to ensure the attacker can t leverage\nmisconfigurations and areas where privilege escalation can be achieved. Here's how:\n\nAD trusts need to be verified and secured (shown in Figure 2)\nAD delegations need to be cleaned up\nGroup policy delegations need to be cleaned up\nGroup policy structural components need to be secured\nSecurity settings deployed by group policy objects need to be enabled\n\n_Figure 2. Mergers and acquisitions can orphan trusts; in addition, required trusts need to be_\n_secured._\n\nFinally, attackers want to gain privileges. Once privileges are obtained, they want to create\nbackdoors. Being able to detect these types of AD attacks is essential. Below are some of\nthe actions AD admins and security pros can take to disrupt attack paths:\n\nEnsure privileged group membership is monitored\nDetect DCShadow and DCSync attacks\nGolden Ticket attacks (illustrated in Figure 3)\nDetect lateral movement attacks\nDetect dangerous SIDHistory and PrimaryGroupID settings\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Tenable.ad can detect advanced attacks on Active Directory, in real time, with no_\n_agent or privilege._\n\nTechnology is available to continuously and automatically analyze and detect AD security\nand attack paths.
