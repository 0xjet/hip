This group is\ncommonly tracked by the cybersecurity industry as Lazarus Group, APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima. For more information on\nNorth Korean state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, visit [https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea)\n\nThe U.S. government has observed North Korean cyber actors targeting a variety of organizations in the blockchain technology and\ncryptocurrency industry, including cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play-to-earn cryptocurrency video\ngames, cryptocurrency trading companies, venture capital funds investing in cryptocurrency, and individual holders of large amounts of\ncryptocurrency or valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The activity described in this advisory involves social engineering of victims\nusing a variety of communication platforms to encourage individuals to download trojanized cryptocurrency applications on Windows or\nmacOS operating systems. The cyber actors then use the applications to gain access to the victim’s computer, propagate malware\nacross the victim’s network environment, and steal private keys or exploit other security gaps. These activities enable additional followon activities that initiate fraudulent blockchain transactions.\n\nThe U.S. government previously published an advisory about North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors using AppleJeus malware to\nsteal cryptocurrency: [AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea’s Cryptocurrency Malware. The U.S. government has also previously](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a)\npublished advisories about North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors stealing money from banks using custom malware:\n\nThis advisory provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to stakeholders\nin the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry to help them identify and mitigate cyber threats against cryptocurrency.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-108A-TraderTraitor-North_Korea_APT_Targets_Blockchain_Companies.pdf)\n\n[Click here for STIX.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/A22-108A.stix.xml)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Threat Update**\n\nThe U.S. government has identified a group of North Korean state-sponsored malicious cyber actors using tactics similar to the\n[previously identified Lazarus Group (see AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea’s Cryptocurrency Malware). The Lazarus Group used](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a)\nAppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency applications targeting individuals and companies—including cryptocurrency exchanges and\nfinancial services companies—through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were modified to include malware\nthat facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. As of April 2022, North Korea’s Lazarus Group actors have targeted various firms, entities, and\nexchanges in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry using spearphishing campaigns and malware to steal cryptocurrency. These\nactors will likely continue exploiting vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency technology firms, gaming companies, and exchanges to generate\nand launder funds to support the North Korean regime.\n\n**Tactics, Techniques and Procedures**\n\nIntrusions begin with a large number of spearphishing messages sent to employees of cryptocurrency companies—often working in\nsystem administration or software development/IT operations (DevOps)—on a variety of communication platforms. The messages often\nmimic a recruitment effort and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency applications,\nwhich the U.S. government refers to as \"TraderTraitor.\"\n\nThe term TraderTraitor describes a series of malicious applications written using cross-platform JavaScript code with the Node.js\nruntime environment using the Electron framework. The malicious applications are derived from a variety of open-source projects and\npurport to be cryptocurrency trading or price prediction tools. TraderTraitor campaigns feature websites with modern design advertising\nthe alleged features of the applications (see figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Screenshot of CryptAIS website_**\n\nThe JavaScript code providing the core functions of the software is bundled with Webpack. Within the code is a function that purports to\nbe an “update,” with a name such as `UpdateCheckSync(), that downloads and executes a malicious payload (see figure 2).`\n\nThe update function makes an HTTP POST request to a PHP script hosted on the TraderTraitor project’s domain at either the endpoint\n```\n/update/ or /oath/checkupdate.php . In recent variants, the server’s response is parsed as a JSON document with a key-value\n\n```\npair, where the key is used as an AES 256 encryption key in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Counter (CTR) mode to decrypt the value.\nThe decrypted data is written as a file to the system’s temporary directory, as provided by the `os.tmpdir() method of Node.js, and`\nexecuted using the `child_process.exec() method of Node.js, which spawns a shell as a child process of the current Electron`\napplication. The text “Update Finished” is then logged to the shell for the user to see.\n\nObserved payloads include updated macOS and Windows variants of Manuscrypt, a custom remote access trojan (RAT), that collects\nsystem information and has the ability to execute arbitrary commands and download additional payloads (see North Korean Remote\nAccess Tool: COPPERHEDGE). Post-compromise activity is tailored specifically to the victim’s environment and at times has been\ncompleted within a week of the initial intrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Screenshot depicting the UpdateCheckSync() and supporting functions bundled within_**\n**_60b3cfe2ec3100caf4afde734cfd5147f78acf58ab17d4480196831db4aa5f18 associated with DAFOM_**\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**_DAFOM_**\n\nDAFOM purports to be a “cryptocurrency portfolio application.” A Mach-O binary packaged within the Electron application was signed by\nan Apple digital signature issued for the Apple Developer Team W58CYKFH67.

The U.S. government recommends implementing mitigations to\nprotect critical infrastructure organizations as well as financial sector organizations in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency\nindustry.\n\nApply defense-in-depth security strategy. Apply security principles—such as least access models and defense-in-depth—to user\nand application privileges to help prevent exploitation attempts from being successful. Use network segmentation to separate\nnetworks into zones based on roles and requirements. Separate network zones can help prevent lateral movement throughout the\norganization and limit the attack surface. See NSA’s [Top Ten Cybersecurity Mitigation Strategies for strategies enterprise](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jul/16/2002158046/-1/-1/0/CSI-NSAS-TOP10-CYBERSECURITY-MITIGATION-STRATEGIES.PDF)\norganizations should use to build a defense-in-depth security posture.\nImplement patch management. Initial and follow-on exploitation involves leveraging common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)\nto gain access to a networked environment. Organizations should have a timely vulnerability and patch management program in\nplace to mitigate exposure to critical CVEs. Prioritize patching of internet-facing devices and monitored accordingly for any\nmalicious logic attacks.\nEnforce credential requirements and multifactor authentication. North Korean malicious cyber actors continuously target user\ncredentials, email, social media, and private business accounts. Organizations should ensure users change passwords regularly\nto reduce the impact of password spraying and other brute force techniques. The U.S. government recommends organizations\nimplement and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of credential theft. Be aware of MFA interception\ntechniques for some MFA implementations and monitor for anomalous logins.\nEducate users on social engineering on social media and spearphishing. North Korean actors rely heavily on social engineering,\nleveraging email and social media platforms to build trust and send malicious documents to unsuspecting users. A cybersecurity\naware workforce is one of the best defenses against social engineering techniques like phishing. User training should include how\nto identify social engineering techniques and awareness to only open links and attachments from trusted senders.\nImplement email and domain mitigations. Maintain awareness of themed emails surrounding current events. Malicious cyber\nactors use current events as lure for potential victims as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizations should have a\nrobust domain security solution that includes leveraging reputation checks and closely monitoring or blocking newly registered\ndomains (NRDs) in enterprise traffic. NRDs are commonly established by threat actors prior to malicious engagement.\n\nHTML and email scanning. Organizations should disable HTML from being used in emails and scan email attachments.\nEmbedded scripts may be hard for an antivirus product to detect if they are fragmented. An additional malware scanning\ninterface product can be integrated to combine potentially malicious payloads and send the payload to the primary antivirus\nproduct. Hyperlinks in emails should also be scanned and opened with precautionary measures to reduce the likelihood of a\nuser clicking on a malicious link.\nEndpoint protection. Although network security is critical, devices mobility often means traveling and connecting to multiple\ndifferent networks that offer varying levels of security. To reduce the risk of introducing exposed hosts to critical networks,\norganizations should ensure mobile devices have installed security suites to detect and mitigate malware.\nEnforce application security. Application allowlisting enables the organization to monitor programs and only allow those on the\napproved allowlist to execute. Allowlisting helps to stop the initial attack, even if the user clicks a malicious link or opens a\nmalicious attachment. Implement baseline rule sets, such as NSA’s [Limiting Location Data Exposure guidance, to block execution](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/04/2002469874/-1/-/0/CSI_LIMITING_LOCATION_DATA_EXPOSURE_FINAL.PDF)\nof unauthorized or malicious programs.\n\nDisable macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing code through an attached office document.\nSome office products allow for the disabling of macros that originate from outside of the organization, providing a hybrid\napproach when the organization depends on the legitimate use of macros.\n\nWindows specific settings can be configured to block internet-originated macros from running. This can be done in the\nGroup Policy Administrative Templates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel and\nPowerPoint). Other productivity software, such as LibreOffice and OpenOffice, can be configured to set the Macro\nSecurity Level.\nBe aware of third-party downloads—especially cryptocurrency applications. North Korean actors have been increasingly active\nwith currency generation operations. Users should always verify file downloads and ensure the source is from a reputable or\nprimary (preferred) source and not from a third-party vendor. Malicious cyber actors have continuously demonstrated the ability to\ntrojanize applications and gain a foothold on host devices.\nCreate an incident response plan to respond to possible cyber intrusions. The plan should include reporting incidents to both the\nFBI and CISA—quick reporting can reduce the severity of incidents and provide valuable information to investigators. Contact\ninformation can be found below.\n\n## Contact\n\n\n-----\n\n[All organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282 0870](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:report@cisa.gov)\nand/or to the FBI via your [local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information in this advisory is provided \"as is\" for informational purposes only.
