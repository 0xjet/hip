Clop and LockBit also directed a\nconsiderable amount of their efforts toward the \"Technology\" sector.\n\nWhile these may be the most targeted sectors, it is important to note that ransomware\nattacks are usually not targeted but rather opportunistic.\n\nRegarding the location of last month's victims, almost half of all attacks (221) breached\nentities in North America, Europe followed with 126 episodes, and Asia came third with 59\nransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Location of ransomware victims** _(NCC Group)_\nThe recorded activity spike in March 2023 highlights the importance of applying security\nupdates as soon as possible, mitigating potentially unknown security gaps like zero days by\nimplementing additional measures and monitoring network traffic and logs for suspicious\nactivity.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[City of Dallas hit by Royal ransomware attack impacting IT services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/city-of-dallas-hit-by-royal-ransomware-attack-impacting-it-services/)\n\n[Brightline data breach impacts 783K pediatric mental health patients](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brightline-data-breach-impacts-783k-pediatric-mental-health-patients/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 28th 2023 - Clop at it again](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-28th-2023-clop-at-it-again/)\n\n[Microsoft: Clop and LockBit ransomware behind PaperCut server hacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-clop-and-lockbit-ransomware-behind-papercut-server-hacks/)\n\n[Fortra shares findings on GoAnywhere MFT zero-day attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortra-shares-findings-on-goanywhere-mft-zero-day-attacks/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
