This happened between July 2012 and September 2015, before Hutchins built a career as a talented security\nresearcher.\n\n### Controversial case\n\n[Hutchins' arrest was controversial, and for many reasons. He argued that he was detained and interrogated while sleep-deprived and](https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-hero-marcus-hutchinss-team-to-suppress-transcript-evidence-11374936)\nintoxicated, and that FBI agents misled him about the true intentions of the interrogation.\n\nFurther, his lawyers also argued that Hutchins' actions happened while he was still a minor, and outside the standard five-year statute of\nlimitations.\n\n[The prosecution responded by piling new charges --such as developing the UPAS-Kit trojan (he was initially only charged with developing the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/us-piles-new-charges-on-marcus-hutchins-aka-malwaretech/)\n[Kronos malware) and with lying to the FBI during his interrogation.

He is considered\none of today's most talented security researchers.\n\n**Data leaks: The most common sources**\n\n### Related malware and cybercrime coverage:\n\n\n-----",
