The ransomware started infecting servers back in mid-July but in\nthe last two weeks, the attacks have become more frequent.\n\nThe very first case of Lilocked ransomware came to light when a user uploaded a\nransomware note on ID Ransomware, a website used for identifying the name of\nransomware from the ransomware note or demand specified in the attack.\n\nIt targets servers and gains its root access. The mechanism behind how it gets access in\nunknown yet.\n\nAccording to a Russian forum, bad actors might be targeting Linux-based servers that are\nrunning defunct Exim software.\n\n## Demand – 0.03 Bitcoin\n\nAfter a server has been attacked, the files are locked with “.lilocked” file extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nZDNet\nThe note accompanied with the encrypted files reads: “I’ve encrypted all your sensitive\n_data!!! It’s a strong encryption, so don’t be naive to restore it;)”_\n\n**_Find your dream job_**\n\nZDNet\nUpon clicking the link in the note, users are redirected to a website on the dark web,\nprompting them to enter the key in the note. When the affected user enters the key, they are\nasked to deposit 0.03 bitcoin or $325 in the Electrum wallet to get their files decrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nZDNet\n\n## Linux Ransomware Does Not Affect System Files\n\nLilock ransomware does not affect system files but files with extensions including HTML,\nSHTML, JS, CSS, PHP, INI, and other image formats. Since system files are not affected,\nLinux systems are running normally.\n\nAs per Benkow, a French security researcher, Lilock ransomware has affected 6,700 servers\nto date. Most of these servers are cached in Google search results. However, the number of\ninfected servers could be much more as there are many infected Linux servers that are not\nindexed on Google.\n\nSince the mechanism behind the ransomware is not known yet, there isn’t a security\nadvisory. You might evade this attack by keeping strong passwords and updating the apps as\nand when security patches arrive.\n\nAlso Read: [Apple Hits Back Hard At Google And Defends iOS Security](https://fossbytes.com/apple-ios-hack-hits-back-google/)\n\n\n-----",
