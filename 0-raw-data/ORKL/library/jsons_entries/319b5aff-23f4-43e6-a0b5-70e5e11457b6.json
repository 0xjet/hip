Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing\ndocuments from the organizations it infiltrates.\n\nSymantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March\n2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in\nSoutheast Asia. We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the\nPacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its\nassociation with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect\nearlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least\nearly-2015 and may have been operating even earlier.\n\nTo date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America\nand Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru,\nBrunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets\nsimultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in\norder to maintain a low profile.\n\n[click_to_tweet:1]\n\n## Highly targeted intrusions\n\nSome clues about the motivation and interests of the attackers can be found in their\nactivities after compromising victims. For example, in a 2015 attack on one South American\nforeign ministry, the group appeared to be searching for very specific information.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first evidence of its intrusion dated from May 6, 2015 but activity appeared to have\nbegun in earnest on May 12. The attackers appeared to be interested in one division of the\nministry that is responsible for relations with the Asia-Pacific region. They attempted to\nextract all Word documents stored on a file server belonging to this division by bundling\nthem into a RAR archive by running the following command:\n\ncmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\rar.exe a -m5 -r -ta20150511000000 -v3072 c:\\recycler\\\n\n[REDACTED].rar \"\\\\[REDACTED]\\*.docx\" \\\\[REDACTED]\\*.doc.\n\nInterestingly, the command specified that only files modified from May 11, 2015 onwards\nshould be archived.\n\nThe attackers appear to have successfully extracted the archive because an hour later they\nreturned, this time attempting to extract all documents modified from May 7, 2015, an extra\nfour days’ worth of data. Presumably they either didn't find what they were looking for in the\ninitial incursion, or else noticed something in the documents they stole earlier that prompted\nthem to hunt for more information.\n\nThe attackers didn’t stop there. Their next move was to list any remote shared drives and\nthen attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were\ntargeting, again attempting to extract all Word documents. In this case, they searched for\nany documents modified from May 9 onwards. The attackers then seemed to broaden their\ninterest, listing the contents of various directories on remote shares, including one\nbelonging to another division of the South American foreign ministry, this one responsible\nfor relations with international organizations. They also deployed two unknown payloads to\nthe infected server. In total, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for\nfour months between May and September 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network traversal: Keeping a low profile\n\nSowbug frequently maintains a long-term presence on the networks of targeted\norganizations, sometimes remaining inside a victim environment for up to six months. One\nof the tactics it uses to avoid drawing attention to itself is impersonating commonly used\nsoftware packages such as Windows or Adobe Reader. It has never attempted to\ncompromise the software itself. Rather, it gives its tools file names similar to those used by\n\n\n-----\n\nthe software and places them in directory trees that could be mistaken for those used by the\nlegitimate software. This allows the attackers to hide in plain sight, as their appearance in\nprocess listings is unlikely to arouse suspicion.\n\nFor example, in September 2016, Sowbug infiltrated an organization in Asia, deploying the\nFelismus backdoor on one of its computers, Computer A, using the file name\nadobecms.exe in CSIDL_WINDOWS\\debug. From there, it installed additional components\nand tools to a directory named CSIDL_APPDATA\\microsoft\\security.\n\nThe attackers then began to perform reconnaissance activities on Computer A via cmd.exe,\ncollecting system-related information, such as the OS version, hardware configuration, and\nnetwork information. They then performed some further reconnaissance, attempting to\nidentify all installed applications on the computer. They returned four days later, creating a\nsub-directory called “common” in the Adobe directory of the Program Files folder, i.e.\nc:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\common, and installed another tool in this sub-directory, again\nnamed adobecms.exe. This was possibly an updated version of the backdoor.\n\nThe attackers’ network reconnaissance appeared to be successful because a second\ncomputer of interest in the organization was identified and compromised. The attackers\nthen returned to Computer A, installing another executable called fb.exe. This file appears\nto be used to copy Felismus across the network to other computers and there is evidence\nthat the attackers used it to attempt to infect at least two more computers.\n\nThe attackers took further measures to remain under the radar by carrying out their\noperations outside of standard office hours. In this case, the attackers maintained a\npresence on the target’s network for nearly six months between September 2016 and\nMarch 2017.\n\n## Infection vectors\n\nHow Sowbug performs its initial infiltration of a target’s network remains unknown. In some\ncases, there was no trace of how Felismus made its way onto compromised computers,\nmeaning it was likely deployed from other compromised computers on the network. In other\nattacks, there was evidence that Felismus was installed using a tool known as Starloader\n(detected by Symantec as Trojan.Starloader). This is a loader that installs and decrypts\ndata from a file called Stars.jpg. Additionally, Starloader was also observed deploying\nadditional tools used by the attackers, such as credential dumpers and keyloggers.\n\nIt is still unknown how Starloader is installed on the compromised computer. One possibility\nis that the attackers use fake software updates to install files. Symantec has found evidence\nof Starloader files being named AdobeUpdate.exe, AcrobatUpdate.exe, and\nINTELUPDATE.EXE among others. These were used to create versions of the Felismus\nbackdoor as well as other tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Global threat\n\nWhile cyber espionage attacks are often seen against targets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia,\nit is much less common to see South American countries targeted. However, the number of\nactive cyber espionage operations has increased steadily in recent years and the\nemergence of Sowbug is a reminder that no region is immune to this kind of threat.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec customers are protected against Sowbug and Symantec has also made efforts to\nnotify identified targets of its operations.\n\nCustomers with Intelligence Services or WebFilter-enabled products are protected against\nactivity associated with the Sowbug group.
