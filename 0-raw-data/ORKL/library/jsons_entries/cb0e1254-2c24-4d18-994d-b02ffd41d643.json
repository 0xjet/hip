These activities enable additional follow-on activities that initiate\nfraudulent blockchain transactions.\n\nThe U.S. government previously published an advisory about North Korean state-sponsored cyber\nactors using AppleJeus malware to steal cryptocurrency: AppleJeus: Analysis of North Korea’s\nCryptocurrency Malware. The U.S. government has also previously published advisories about North\nKorean state-sponsored cyber actors stealing money from banks using custom malware:\n\n     - HIDDEN COBRA – FASTCash Campaign\n\n     - FASTCash 2.0: North Korea’s BeagleBoyz Robbing Banks\n\nThis advisory provides information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) to stakeholders in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry to help\nthem identify and mitigate cyber threats against cryptocurrency.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n### Threat Update\n\nThe U.S. government has identified a group of North Korean state-sponsored malicious cyber actors\nusing tactics similar to the previously identified Lazarus Group (see AppleJeus: Analysis of North\nKorea’s Cryptocurrency Malware). The Lazarus Group used AppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency\napplications targeting individuals and companies—including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial\nservices companies—through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were\nmodified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. As of April 2022, North Korea’s\nLazarus Group actors have targeted various firms, entities, and exchanges in the blockchain and\ncryptocurrency industry using spearphishing campaigns and malware to steal cryptocurrency. These\nactors will likely continue exploiting vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency technology firms, gaming\ncompanies, and exchanges to generate and launder funds to support the North Korean regime.\n\n### Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\nIntrusions begin with a large number of spearphishing messages sent to employees of cryptocurrency\ncompanies—often working in system administration or software development/IT operations\n(DevOps)—on a variety of communication platforms. The messages often mimic a recruitment effort\nand offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency\napplications, which the U.S. government refers to as \"TraderTraitor.\"\n\nThe term TraderTraitor describes a series of malicious applications written using cross-platform\nJavaScript code with the Node.js runtime environment using the Electron framework. The malicious\napplications are derived from a variety of open-source projects and purport to be cryptocurrency\ntrading or price prediction tools. TraderTraitor campaigns feature websites with modern design\nadvertising the alleged features of the applications (see figure 1).\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury\n\n_Figure 1: Screenshot of CryptAIS website_\n\nThe JavaScript code providing the core functions of the software is bundled with Webpack. Within the\ncode is a function that purports to be an “update,” with a name such as UpdateCheckSync(), that\ndownloads and executes a malicious payload (see figure 2).\n\nThe update function makes an HTTP POST request to a PHP script hosted on the TraderTraitor\nproject’s domain at either the endpoint /update/ or /oath/checkupdate.php. In recent variants, the\nserver’s response is parsed as a JSON document with a key-value pair, where the key is used as an\nAES 256 encryption key in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Counter (CTR) mode to decrypt the value.\nThe decrypted data is written as a file to the system’s temporary directory, as provided by the\nos.tmpdir() method of Node.js, and executed using the child_process.exec() method of\nNode.js, which spawns a shell as a child process of the current Electron application. The text “Update\nFinished” is then logged to the shell for the user to see.\n\nObserved payloads include updated macOS and Windows variants of Manuscrypt, a custom remote\naccess trojan (RAT), that collects system information and has the ability to execute arbitrary\ncommands and download additional payloads (see North Korean Remote Access Tool:\nCOPPERHEDGE). Post-compromise activity is tailored specifically to the victim’s environment and at\ntimes has been completed within a week of the initial intrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury\n\n_Figure 2: Screenshot depicting the UpdateCheckSync() and supporting functions bundled within_\n_60b3cfe2ec3100caf4afde734cfd5147f78acf58ab17d4480196831db4aa5f18 associated with DAFOM_\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n#### DAFOM\nDAFOM purports to be a “cryptocurrency portfolio application.” A Mach-O binary packaged within the\nElectron application was signed by an Apple digital signature issued for the Apple Developer Team\nW58CYKFH67.

The U.S. government recommends implementing mitigations to protect critical\ninfrastructure organizations as well as financial sector organizations in the blockchain technology and\ncryptocurrency industry.\n\n    - **Apply defense-in-depth security strategy. Apply security principles—such as least access**\nmodels and defense-in-depth—to user and application privileges to help prevent exploitation\nattempts from being successful. Use network segmentation to separate networks into zones\nbased on roles and requirements. Separate network zones can help prevent lateral movement\nthroughout the organization and limit the attack surface. See NSA’s Top Ten Cybersecurity\nMitigation Strategies for strategies enterprise organizations should use to build a defense-in­\ndepth security posture.\n\n    - **Implement patch management. Initial and follow-on exploitation involves leveraging common**\nvulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) to gain access to a networked environment.\nOrganizations should have a timely vulnerability and patch management program in place to\nmitigate exposure to critical CVEs. Prioritize patching of internet-facing devices and monitored\naccordingly for any malicious logic attacks.\n\n    - **Enforce credential requirements and multifactor authentication. North Korean malicious**\ncyber actors continuously target user credentials, email, social media, and private business\naccounts. Organizations should ensure users change passwords regularly to reduce the\nimpact of password spraying and other brute force techniques. The U.S. government\nrecommends organizations implement and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) to reduce\nthe risk of credential theft. Be aware of MFA interception techniques for some MFA\nimplementations and monitor for anomalous logins.\n\n    - **Educate users on social engineering on social media and spearphishing. North Korean**\nactors rely heavily on social engineering, leveraging email and social media platforms to build\ntrust and send malicious documents to unsuspecting users. A cybersecurity aware workforce\nis one of the best defenses against social engineering techniques like phishing. User training\nshould include how to identify social engineering techniques and awareness to only open links\nand attachments from trusted senders.\n\n    - **Implement email and domain mitigations. Maintain awareness of themed emails**\nsurrounding current events. Malicious cyber actors use current events as lure for potential\nvictims as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizations should have a robust\ndomain security solution that includes leveraging reputation checks and closely monitoring or\nblocking newly registered domains (NRDs) in enterprise traffic. NRDs are commonly\nestablished by threat actors prior to malicious engagement.\n\no **HTML and email scanning. Organizations should disable HTML from being used in**\nemails and scan email attachments. Embedded scripts may be hard for an antivirus\nproduct to detect if they are fragmented. An additional malware scanning interface\nproduct can be integrated to combine potentially malicious payloads and send the\npayload to the primary antivirus product. Hyperlinks in emails should also be scanned\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury\n\nand opened with precautionary measures to reduce the likelihood of a user clicking on\na malicious link.\n\n    - **Endpoint protection. Although network security is critical, devices mobility often means**\ntraveling and connecting to multiple different networks that offer varying levels of security. To\nreduce the risk of introducing exposed hosts to critical networks, organizations should ensure\nmobile devices have installed security suites to detect and mitigate malware.\n\n    - **Enforce application security. Application allowlisting enables the organization to monitor**\nprograms and only allow those on the approved allowlist to execute. Allowlisting helps to stop\nthe initial attack, even if the user clicks a malicious link or opens a malicious attachment.\nImplement baseline rule sets, such as NSA’s Limiting Location Data Exposure guidance, to\nblock execution of unauthorized or malicious programs.\n\no **Disable macros in office products. Macros are a common method for executing**\ncode through an attached office document. Some office products allow for the\ndisabling of macros that originate from outside of the organization, providing a hybrid\napproach when the organization depends on the legitimate use of macros.\n\n          - Windows specific settings can be configured to block internet-originated\nmacros from running. This can be done in the Group Policy Administrative\nTemplates for each of the associated Office products (specifically Word, Excel\nand PowerPoint). Other productivity software, such as LibreOffice and\nOpenOffice, can be configured to set the Macro Security Level.\n\n    - **Be aware of third-party downloads—especially cryptocurrency applications. North Korean**\nactors have been increasingly active with currency generation operations. Users should\nalways verify file downloads and ensure the source is from a reputable or primary (preferred)\nsource and not from a third-party vendor. Malicious cyber actors have continuously\ndemonstrated the ability to trojanize applications and gain a foothold on host devices.\n\n    - **Create an incident response plan to respond to possible cyber intrusions. The plan should**\ninclude reporting incidents to both the FBI and CISA—quick reporting can reduce the severity\nof incidents and provide valuable information to investigators. Contact information can be\nfound below.\n\n## CONTACT \n\nAll organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations Center\n[at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7](mailto:report@cisa.gov)\n[CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.](mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov)\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nThe information in this advisory is provided \"as is\" for informational purposes only.
