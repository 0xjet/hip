Prior to the election, it was reported**\n**that the election was going to be the target of a series of attacks by Chinese threat actors.[1] Looking back on the**\n**malware observed from different groups over that period of time, we have been able to piece together evidence which**\n**suggests that several distinct threat actors launched attacks using the Taiwan presidential election as a spear phishing**\n**theme. This blog post provides an overview of the malware and the network infrastructure associated with the threat**\n**actors who have taken advantage of this event.**\n\n# EvilGrab\n\n**The first sample we came across using the Taiwan election theme was an Excel spreadsheet named** **2016年台[灣總統]**\n\n**選舉[觀戰團]** **⾏程20160105.xls (393dafa8bd5e30334d2cbf23677e1d2e). Once the spreadsheet is executed, a**\n\n**file called 6EC5.tmp is dropped in the** **%temp% folder. The file is in fact an executable binary which, once executed,**\n\n**spawns a ctfmon.exe process and clones itself in the %userprofile% directory as a file called** **IEChecker.exe**\n**(fb498e6a994d6d53b80c53a05fc2da36).**\n\n**Figure 1:** **ctfmon.exe process creates a set of registry keys and drops** **IEChecker.exe in %userprofile%.**\n\n**Figure 2: Registry values containing encoded modules used by the Evilgrab malware.**\n\n**A id** **f** **ti** **th** **li i** **l** **t** **t** **f** **i t** **k** **t th**\n\n\n### Email alerts\n\n**[Join today to receive email alerts when we](http://image.edistribution.pwc.com/lib/fe9d13707566057876/m/1/email-alerts-cyber.html)**\n**publish new articles**\n\n**Search the site**\n\n**Search our archive**\n\n**_Articles by category_**\n\n**_Articles by month_**\n\n### Are you ready for the new\n\n data privacy world?\n\n**Register for our live webcast on Wednesday**\n**2 March 2016**\n\n**Latest posts from Cyber security**\n**updates**\n\n**_Taiwan Presidential Election: A Case Study_**\n**_on Thematic Targeting_**\n\n**_Cyber security - Are you ready for the new_**\n**_data privacy world?_**\n\n**_[Amazing what you see over lunch…](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/02/amazing-what-you-see-over-lunch.html)_**\n\n**_What the recent JANET attack tells us_**\n**_about Social Media Risk_**\n\n**_[The concept of ‘cyber’ in a criminal world](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/01/the-concept-of-cyber-in-a-criminal-world.html)_**\n\n**_[ELISE: Security Through Obesity](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/12/elise-security-through-obesity.html)_**\n\n**_Why 2015 was the tipping point for_**\n**_cybersecurity_**\n\n**_#PrivateBizChat: Cybersecurity - 15_**\n**_December, 12.30pm - 1.30pm_**\n\n**_[We are not one, we are many](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/11/we-are-not-one-we-are-many.html)_**\n\n**_[Ingredients for Consumer Security](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/11/ingredients-for-consumer-security.html)_**\n\n### Cyber security\n\n**[Building confidence in your digital future](http://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/cyber-security.jhtml)**\n\n### Breach aid\n\n**[Are you suffering a cyber, privacy or data](http://www.pwc.co.uk/en_UK/uk/breach-aid/index.html)**\n**breach?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**CU\\So t a e\\ a \\e**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\rar\\s**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\rar\\data**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\rar\\ActiveSettings**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\VirtualStore\\MACHINE\\Software\\rar\\e**\n\n**The malware establishes persistence by setting an Autorun key called** **ctfmon to ensure** **IEChecker.exe is**\n\n**executed on startup.**\n\n**Figure 3: An AutoRun key is set by the ctfmon process to ensure IEChecker.exe is executed on startup.**\n\n**The malware also beacons to the command and control (C2) 192.225.226[.]98 on port 8080 by sending TCP**\n\n**SYN packets approximately every 30 seconds.**\n\n\n### 2015 Information security\n\n breaches survey\n\n**The results are in**\n\n\n# DynCalc/Numbered Panda/APT12\n\n**The second sample we came across was an executable named** **總統[辯論會後：⺠眾政黨⽀持趨勢變化]**\n\n\n**.exe**\n\n\n**(791931e779a1af6d2e1370e952451aea) which translates to “Post presidential debate: support for people’s**\n\n**political parties changes”. The sample was submitted to VirusTotal by a user in Taiwan on 11[th] January 2016, five days**\n**before the presidential election.**\n\n**Figure 4: Malware was submitted to Virustotal on 11** **[th] January 2016 by a user in Taiwan.**\n\n**The binary uses the standard Microsoft Word icon, shown below, to trick users into thinking the file is a legitimate**\n**Microsoft Word Document.**\n\n**Figure 5: The malicious binary with a Word icon.**\n\n**On execution, the binary creates a file called** **ka4281x3.log in the same directory as the original binary; this file**\n\n**contains encoded data. The naming convention of this file has been reported as distinctive to the IXESHE[3] and the**\n**related Etumbot[4] malware family, and it is based on the behavioral similarity with other Etumbot samples (e.g.**\n**2b3a8734a57604e98e6c996f94776086) that we believe this attack is associated with APT12.**\n\n**Aside from the .log file, a decoy document is also created and displayed to the victim as shown below. Research on**\n\n**the content of the decoy document shows that the content is likely to have been taken from a presentation with**\n\n**the same title, “總統[辯論會後：⺠眾政黨⽀持趨勢變化]”, originally written by TaiwanThinkTank.** **[5] The figure below**\n\n**shows the same content from the presentation being used in the decoy document. The lack of formatting in the decoy**\n**document suggests that the attacker simply copied and pasted the content from the PDF to create a new Word**\n**document. The similarity of the content is as shown below:**\n\n\n**Fi** **6 Th** **i i** **l** **t ti** **f** **th** **T i** **Thi kt** **k** **[6] titl d “** **總統[辯論會後：⺠眾政黨⽀持趨勢變化]**\n\n\n**”**\n\n\n-----\n\n**e** **a** **a e** **e** **d ops a b a y ca ed** **eco e.e e** **o % ppdata%\\ oa** **g\\ ocat o** **a d** **s a s a** **u o u**\n\n**key to ensure the dropped binary is executed on startup.**\n\n**Figure 7: An Autorun key is installed to ensure vecome.exe is executed on startup.**\n\n**Similar to other IXESHE/Etumbot samples, the malware drops six temporary files in the %temp% folder:**\n\n**Figure 8: Six temporary files created by the IXESHE/Etumbot sample.**\n\n**The malware communicates with the C2** **201.21.94[.]135 on port 443 over SSL. The SSL certificate used is**\n\n**associated with the email address exam@google.com[7] and has the serial** **00 8b be a3 a0 a9 1b 1c 78 .**\n\n**Figure 9: SSL certification is associated with the email address** **exam@google.com.**\n\n# SunOrcal and Surtr\n\n**The last sample we have identified using the Taiwan election theme was a malicious Microsoft Word document named**\n**2016總統[選舉⺠情中⼼預測值].doc (09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). The content of this file contains two**\n\n**blank squares (Figure 10) however, once a self-extracting archive (SFX) is dropped, a separate decoy document is**\n**displayed which contains one line of text that mentions the presidential election.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**However, the sentence is nonsensical and it reads as if the attacker simply concatenated a few unrelated lines**\n**together. Interestingly, a search for the sentences revealed that it had been used as the title of a spear phishing email**\n**sent to a number of politicians and activists in Hong Kong including James To[8], Tommy Cheung[9] and Joshua**\n\n**Wong.[10] Wong is a well-known student activist in Hong Kong and he publicly announced on Facebook on 6** **[th]**\n\n**January 2016 that he had received the spear phishing email but was not tricked into opening the .rar attachment**\n**(Figure 11), which shares the same filename as the document file referenced in Figure 10.**\n\n**Figure 11: A well-known student activist in Hong Kong claimed to have received a spear phishing email with**\n**an attachment named “2016總統[選舉⺠情中⼼預測值].rar”. The email title is identical to the line shown in the**\n**decoy document dropped by the analysed sample.**\n\n**Examining the EXIF data of the decoy document dropped by our sample shows that the document was created on the**\n**same day as the spear phishing email was sent.**\n\n**Figure 12: EXIF data of the decoy document highlight the similarity in timing of the attack.**\n\n**Given similarities in the theme and text used in the spear phish, as well as the timing of the campaign against the**\n**Hong Kong activist and the creation time of the decoy document, we believe both attacks are likely to be the same.**\n\n**Returning to the analysis of our sample, once the lure document is executed, a self-extracting archive is dropped and**\n**executed. The archive contains three files, a batch script, a copy of the wget binary and a further binary called**\n**iuso.exe.**\n\n**Figure 13: The dropped self-extracting archive.**\n\n**Once executed, the binaries are dropped in the** **%programdata% directory and the batch script is executed to**\n\n**download the second stage malware from a compromised host kcico[.]com.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**dates back to as early as 2013[11] and which appears to be a misspelling of Sun Oracle, we refer to this malware as**\n**SunOrcal.**\n\n**Below are the full nested paths:**\n\n**C:\\ProgramData\\Javame\\Java\\Jre\\helper\\113507**\n\n**C:\\ProgramData\\sun orcal\\java\\JavaUpdata**\n\n**C:\\ProgramData\\sun orcal\\java\\SunJavaUpdata**\n\n**Once wthk.exe is executed, it clones itself to** **\\sun orcal\\java\\SunJavaUpdata as a file called**\n\n**SunJavaUpdata.exe. In addition, a shortcut called** **SunJavaUpdataData.lnk is created in the Javame folder**\n\n**which points to the malware SunJavaUpdata.exe.**\n\n**The purpose of this shortcut became clear when we examined the changes made to the registry. The malware**\n**modifies the startup key at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User**\n\n**Shell Folder\\ to point to the** **\\Javame\\Java\\Jre\\helper\\113507 directory, causing Explorer to execute the**\n\n**shortcut when it first loads and which in effect ensures the malware is executed on startup.**\n\n**Figure 15: SunOrcal persistence mechanism.**\n\n**As shown in the batch script, once** **wthk.exe has finished executing,** **iuso.exe is then executed. Examining the**\n\n**code of this binary shows that the sole purpose of this binary is to sleep for one minute and then execute a binary in**\n**%programdata% called Keyainst.exe. Unfortunately, we were unable to retrieve this binary.**\n\n**Examining the network traffic generated by** **SunJavaUpdata.exe, we find that the malware communicates with the**\n\n**C2 domain safety.security-centers[.]com which resolved to the IP address** **210.61.12[.]153 at**\n\n**the time of writing. According to DomainTools [12], the domain** **security-centers[.]com is associated with two**\n\n**email addresses:**\n\n**Registrant email: an_ardyth@123mail.org**\n\n**Admin/tech email: janmiller-domain@googlemail.com**\n\n**Interestingly, the malware stores the C2 in the registry key at HKCU\\Software\\Google\\info:**\n\n**Figure 16: C2 information and campaign code stored in registry.**\n\n**The figure also shows what appears to be a campaign code “ wthkdoc0106” with “wthk” being the malware name,**\n\n**“doc” being the type of document used for malware delivery and “0106” denoting 6[th] January which is the date of the**\n**attack, as shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12.**\n\n**Aside from the campaign code, the malware also has a hardcoded mutex “ M&BX^DSF&DA@F”:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17: Hardcoded mutex** **M&BX^DSF&DA@F.**\n\n**Another interesting observable from the malware sample is a call to a DLL function,** **FunctionWork, which is**\n\n**hardcoded in the malware.**\n\n**Figure 18: SunOrcal malware calls a function called** **FunctionWork which is hardcoded in the malware.**\n\n**Although we were unable to find direct overlap in network infrastructure used by our SunOrcal sample and other threat**\n**actors, we were able to identify other SunOrcal samples which have shared network infrastructure with the Surtr**\n**malware, previously reported by Citizen Labs[13] back in 2013.**\n\n**In particular, by finding samples that create the same folder names “ javame” and “sun orcal”, we came across the**\n\n**following SunOrcal samples which shares the same mutex, folder structure, registry paths and calls the DLL function**\n**“FunctionWork”:**\n\n**6b3804bf4a75f77fec98aeb50ab24746 (C2: www.olinaodi[.]com)**\n\n**1fd33fe7c2800225bfc270f9ae053b65 (C2: www.eyesfeel256[.]com)**\n\n**397021af7c0284c28db65297a6711235 (C2: safetyssl.security-centers[.]com)**\n\n**415f5752bf5182b9d108d7478ba950f9 (C2: www.eyesfeel256[.]com)**\n\n**Looking at the WHOIS information of** **olinaodi[.]com and eyesfeel256[.]com show that they are registered**\n\n**with the same email address toucan6712@163.com. A reverse WHOIS lookup on the email address returned a total**\n\n**of fourteen domains, the majority of which follow related themes such as fly, dream, eyes and feel.**\n\n**Particularly interesting is flyoutside[.]com which was reported by Citizen Lab in 2013 as a C2 domain associated**\n\n**with the Surtr malware. The Surtr samples associated with this C2 are:**\n\n**7fbdd7cb8b46291e944fcecd5f97d135**\n\n**44758b9a7a6cafd1b8d1bd4c773a2577**\n\n**6da1abd5d7ed21a3328d9fdfaf061f24**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 19: List of domains registered using the email address toucan6712@163.com.**\n\n**Based on the use of the same registrant email address that is associated with only a small number of domains with**\n**related themes in addition to the targeting of Tibet and Hong Kong, both of which are autonomous regions that have**\n**been problematic to China’s internal security, we believe with high confidence that both SunOrcal and Surtr RATs are**\n**used by the same threat actor. Based on the creation date of some of the domains, we believe the threat actor has**\n**been active as early as 2010.**\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Spear phishing has long been one of the most common and effective ways in which an attacker can deliver malware**\n**on to victim machines to compromise target organisations. The success or failure of this technique relies on the ability**\n**of attackers to trick victims into opening the malicious attachment and this is why high-profile events and headlines are**\n**often used as lures.**\n\n**As with other high-profile events, the Taiwanese presidential election in January was no different. In this blog post, we**\n**have shown that three distinct espionage threat actors have used the election as theme to lure their victims into**\n**opening the malicious documents. This highlights the importance of security awareness training to ensure staff**\n**members, particularly those with access to sensitive information, remain vigilant in order to help defend against well-**\n**crafted spear-phishing attacks.**\n\n**Michael Yip | Cyber Threat Detection & Response**\n**+44 (0)20 78043900**\n\n### @michael_yip\n\n**[1] http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-20/taiwan-opposition-hacked-as-china-s-cyberspies-step-up-attacks-iif2vmh1**\n\n**[[2] See http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/evilgrab-malware-family-used-in-targeted-attacks-in-asia/ and, more](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/evilgrab-malware-family-used-in-targeted-attacks-in-asia/)**\n\n**recently, http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/evilgrab-delivered-by-watering-hole-attack-on-president-of-myanmars-**\n\n**website/**\n\n**[3] http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_ixeshe.pdf**\n\n**[4] http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2014-07-Illuminating-**\n\n**Etumbot-APT.pdf**\n\n**[5] www.taiwanthinktank.org/english/welcome**\n\n**[6] http://www.taiwanthinktank.org/chinese/page/5/71/3074/0**\n\n**[7] Note that it is possible to provide a fake address when creating a SSL certificate and so this does not necessarily mean that the attacker**\n\n**controls this email address.**\n\n**[8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_To**\n\n**[9] https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%B5%E7%A7%80%E8%B3%A2**\n\n**[10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Wong_(activist)**\n\n**[11] http://contagiodump.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/sandbox-miming-cve-2012-0158-in-mhtml.html**\n\n**[12] https://whois.domaintools.com/security-centers.com**\n\n**[13] https://citizenlab.org/2013/08/surtr-malware-family-targeting-the-tibetan-community/**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comments**\n\n**Post a comment**\n\n**Comments are moderated and will not appear until the author has approved them.**\n\n**[If you have a TypeKey or TypePad account, please Sign in](https://www.typekey.com/t/typekey/login?v=1.0&t=c93d5accba1ccdfd9f161f13841496ff59874128&lang=en_US&_return=http%3A%2F%2Fpwc.blogs.com%2Fcyber_security_updates%2F2016%2F03%2Ftaiwant-election-targetting.html&_portal=typepad)**\n\n**Name***\n\n**Email***\n\n\n**Website**\n\n\n**[© 2012-2016 PwC.
