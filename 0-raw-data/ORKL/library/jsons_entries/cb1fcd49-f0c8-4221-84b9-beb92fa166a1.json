We discovered a number of decoy dating sites used by fraudulent\nadvertisers on TrafficJunky, the advertising company for brands such as PornHub, RedTube\nand YouPorn owned by MindGeek.\n\nThe scammers created those fake identities to redirect traffic away from the adult platforms\nonto pages showing bogus alerts claiming users were infected with pornographic spyware.\nThis well-known scheme attempts to scare victims into calling so-called technicians for\nassistance but in fact defrauds them for hundreds of dollars.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe reported our findings to MindGeek and continue to track and share new incidents as they\narise. We believe this threat actor will keep on tricking new victims until fully exposed and\nindividuals apprehended by law enforcement.\n\n## Redirection chain\n\nWe were able to capture the malvertising redirection chain several times and the flow is\nalmost identical. We know from our telemetry that the malicious advertiser is targeting victims\nfrom the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nUser clicks to play a video\nA new browser window opens\nA request is sent to the TrafficJunky ad platform\nAn ad is served and makes a request to a decoy dating site\nA redirect immediately loads the browser locker\n\n\n-----\n\nThis sequence of events can be summarized in the traffic capture below:\n\nA key part of this malvertising chain is the use of many different fake dating portals that are\nhiding the redirection mechanism for the browser locker.\n\n## Beginnings\n\nThis browser locker campaign started well before showing up on PornHub[.]com and went\nundetected for a long time perhaps due to a clever typosquatting trick. In fact, we were\nfooled ourselves for a while before seeing what is obvious in hindsight.\n\nOn May 21 2020, the threat actor registered the domain name sassysenssations[.]com\nwhich contains a voluntary typo (two ‘s’) to mimic sassysensations[.]com which belongs to a\nlegitimate business.\n\nThe real domain was registered in 2014 and we even found a billboard advertisement for it\n[tweeted out on April 26 2019, long before the scammers had registered their copycat](https://twitter.com/SassySensations/status/1121875000963862530/photo/3)\ndomain.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat was clever is that the threat actor didn t seem to set up an actual site for that fake\ndomain, but instead redirected all traffic to the real one if the visitor did not match the\nparameters from their malvertising campaign.\n\nHowever, the malvertising chain shows that they leveraged that domain to perform\nconditional redirects, such as the one seen below:\n```\n(1) pornhub[.]com/_xa/ads?zone_id=[removed]\n (2) ads.trafficjunky[.]net/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsassysenssations[.]com%\n  (3) sassysenssations[.]com/track.php?CampaignID=[removed]&Sitename=Pornhub\n   (4) errorhelpline24x7msofficialsoftwareerrorcodex12[.]monster\n\n```\nLater on, it appears the threat actor started diversifying their scheme by creating a number of\nfake dating sites to use as redirects in addition to using the sassysenssations identity.\n\n## Fake dating sites\n\nThe malicious advertiser is using a model that has been tried before and consists of setting\nup fake identities in order to gain access to the ad platform. In this instance, we cataloged\ndating and romance sites. However, the majority of them did not look authentic or functional\nand even still had the ‘Lorem ipsum’ text filler.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you were to visit one those sites directly, you may not see anything else of interest, at least\nnothing malicious in nature. However, the fraudulent advertiser can easily redirect traffic\nbased on factors such as IP geolocation, referer and other artifacts.\n\nIn all, we detected close to 100 decoy domain names set up as “advertising landing pages”\nused to redirect victims to browser locker scams. Even though the templates are half\nfinished, the threat actor is spending time creating a large inventory they can cycle through in\ntheir redirects towards browser lockers.\n\n## Browser locker\n\n\n-----\n\nThe browser locker is using a common theme of a fake Microsoft Windows Defender\nscanner. There is some browser profiling to serve the right template based on whether the\nuser is on Windows or Mac.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile browsing one of the many decoy sites, we found the HTML source code in an exposed\ndirectory showing a few additional variations of the browser locker:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Fake advertising infrastructure\n\nBecause this is a long running campaign, the infrastructure is fairly large but tends to reuse\nthe same naming convention for domains. The graph below only shows the domains created\nto abuse the TrafficJunky ad platform. It does not include domains used for the browlock\nitself.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere was a domain (recipesonline365[.]com) whose naming convention differed from the\nother dating sites. In fact it is the only one with a non-adult theme.\n```\n(1) youporn[.]com/_xa/ads?zone_id=[removed]\n (2) ads.trafficjunky[.]net/deep_click?\nadtype=pop&url=https%3A%2F%2Frecipesonline365[.]com\n  (3) recipesonline365[.]com/?aclid=[removed]\n   (4) oopi3.azurewebsites[.]net/Winhelpxcode161616winHelpSecurity0nlineCH007\n\n```\n[Back in June 2019, we had identified an ad campaign targeting recipe keywords. The threat](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/tech-support-scams/2019/06/recipe-for-success-tech-support-scammers-zero-in-via-paid-search/)\nactor was using decoy recipe and food sites to lure victims via web searches. Those sites\nperformed the same redirect mechanism as the decoy dating sites, and most of the time lead\nto a browlock hosted on Azure as well.\n\nThere are a number of other parallels between that campaign and the adult one such as the\npredominant use of NameCheap hosting and a large volume of decoy sites. For this reason\nwe believe this is likely the same threat actor.\n\n## Protection\n\nBrowser lockers are not dangerous in and out of themselves. They are simply a fake warning\nwhich may be disrupting and annoying but one that does not indicate a computer problem.\n\nIn recent years they have become very common and affect all browsers, even mobile ones.\nIn the past, we have seen browser lockers that were effectively giving the impression the\nmachine was locked due to how they abused the user interface. As of know, most of them\ncan be closed normally without requiring the use of special commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Malwarebytes users were already protected against this campaign. Our Browser Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard/)\nextension can detect and stop browser lockers using heuristic techniques that do not require\nto use a blacklist of known domain names or IP addresses.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[The list of IOCs can be downloaded from our GitHub here.](https://github.com/MBThreatIntel/TSS/blob/master/adult_malvertising.txt)\n\n\n-----",
