Keep reading for an overview of the attack and what we know so far!\n\n\nAfter little more than a month of\nreprieve, the infosec community is, once\nagain, back into it. This time the target,\nthough, is even more prevalent than\nSolarWinds’ Orion. Now the target is\nMicrosoft’s Exchange, and the exploited\nvulnerability allows for remote code\nexecution (or RCE). We’ve distilled\ndown the facts of the HAFNIUM attack\nto answer the most important questions.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n\nHAFNIUM Infographic\n\n\n## What We Know So Far about HAFNIUM\n\n**Who Are They?**\n\n[On 2 March 2021, Microsoft released a blog article detailing a new threat actor it had dubbed](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/#scan-log)\n**HAFNIUM. Microsoft, the blog identified, has observed the actor exploiting several 0-day**\nvulnerabilities.\n\nMicrosoft also highlighted that the HAFNIUM group had previously targeted other\norganizations. The group, Microsoft identified, has focused on the exploitation of Internetfacing services in the past.\n\n[Later that same day, the company Volexity also released a blog article. In their article, they](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\nidentified that they observed the attacks beginning as early as 3 January 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nHot on the heels of the Microsoft and Volexity blogs, other vendors began to contribute\n[information. On 4 March 2021, FireEye’s Mandiant Intelligence release their own blog post.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\nIn it, FireEye identified that they tracked the activity under three separate activity clusters:\n\nUNC2639\nUNC2640\nUNC2643\n\nOne particularly important point in this blog article is that FireEye detected this activity all the\nway back in January 2021. The article also highlighted various TTPs and tools the actors\nused. This included:\n\nASPXSPY\nCovenant\nChina Chopper\nNishang\nPowerCat\nCobalt Strike\n\nThey also described the actors’ method of deploying webshells on compromised Exchange\nservers. These webshells were unique though. The webshells detected the presence of\nspecific security products and warn the actors. The security products it detected included\nFireEye, Carbon Black and Crowdstrike. They described the actors technique of dropping\nmore complex webshells over time. This appears to be to avoid detection.\n\n[In time, other vendors have also come forward, including Symantec. They identified that they](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/microsoft-exchange-server-protection)\ntrack HAFNIUM, under the name Ant.\n\n**Where is HAFNIUM From?**\n\n[Attribution can be a tricky topic in cyber threat intelligence. Despite this fact, several](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2021/03/04/microsoft-exchange-attacks-are-declared-an-emergency-by-homeland-security/) [sources,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/microsoft-attack-blamed-on-china-morphs-into-global-crisis/2021/03/06/48bffec4-7ee1-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html)\n[including Microsoft, have indicated that the HAFNIUM group is “… state-sponsored and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\noperating out of China …”\n\n**Who is Being Targeted?**\n\nAt this point, the targeting of HAFNIUM appears opportunistic. Indeed, since Microsoft\n[released their initial blog, the actors have “… stepped up attacks on any vulnerable,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/)\nunpatched Exchange servers (2013, 2016, and 2019) worldwide.” The HAFNIUM group,\nthough, has targeted organizations in the past.\n\nAs both Microsoft and FireEye mentioned, HAFNIUM is a group with a bit of track record.\nMicrosoft identified that they have targeted several industries in the past. These included\n\nInfectious disease research\n\n\n-----\n\nLaw firms\nUniversities\nDefense contractors\nThink tanks\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\n\nFireEye also mentioned that they had observed several industries affected by the new\nattack, including\n\nRetailers\nLocal Governments\nUniversities\nEngineering Firms\n\nThey also identified that there is possible related activity observed in Asia as well\n\nFederal governments\nTelecommunications providers\n\n**What Are The Actors Doing?**\n\nSince early January, the actors have been exploiting several 0-day vulnerabilities in\nExchange. The vulnerabilities, which affect on-premise versions of Microsoft Exchange only,\nare:\n\nCVE-2021-26855\nCVE-2021-26857\nCVE-2021-26858\nCVE-2021-27065\n\nOnce the actors establish a foothold in the environment, they will deploy one or more web\nshells. These are small bits of code that gives the actors control over the system. Once in the\nenvironment, the actors use a variety of techniques.\n\n**HAFNIUM MITRE ATT&CK Techniques**\n\nT1003.001 – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\nT1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\nT1114.001 – Email Collection: Local Email Collection\nT1136 – Create Account\nT1003.003 – OS Credential Dumping: NTDS\nT1021.002 – Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\nT1005 – Data from Local System\nT1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information\nT1046 – Network Service Scanning\n\n\n-----\n\nT1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter\nT1070 – Indicator Removal on Host\nT1071 – Application Layer Protocol\nT1074.002 – Data Staged: Remote Data Staging\nT1083 – File and Directory Discovery\nT1110 – Brute Force\nT1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application\nT1505 – Server Software Component\nT1560.001 – Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility\nT1589.002 – Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses\nT1590.002 – Gather Victim Network Information: DNS\n\n**When Did All This Happen?**\n\n[Reporting from both FireEye and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html) [Volexity state that the attacks were first observed in](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\nJanuary. It is unknown whether this was the start of the campaign.\n\nThe bulk of the campaign appears to have taken place over February and March 2021.\n\n**What Should I Do?**\n\nWhat you should do next will likely depend on a few factors.\n\n[Cyborg Security has released new advanced detection content through its Community](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/7924572/c4f6d0f6-bbce-4628-bc69-6e1f29ae348e)\nDefense Measures (CDM) project. This content will alert organization to malicious\nbehaviors related to the attacks.\nMicrosoft [has released a tool that will scan Exchange logs for suspicious and malicious](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security)\nmodifications.\n[Microsoft has also released security updates for Microsoft Exchange](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/)\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also released Alert\nAA21-062A. An important note about this is that CISA warns organizations: “… [if] your\norganization [sees] evidence of compromise, your incident response should begin with\nconducting forensic analysis to collect artifacts and perform triage ….”\n[The US’ Department of Homeland Security also issued Emergency Directive 21-02.](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-02/)\n\n**Detection Content**\n\n**To get Cyborg Security’s HAFNIUM Community Defense Measures, click the botton**\n**below.
