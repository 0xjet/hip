Evidence for this can be seen every day. Our analysts have\ntaken a look at Buran and Zeppelin, a particularly devastating exhibit of this evolution.\n\nRansomware made a strong comeback in 2019 after its hiatus in 2018. Many high-profile\nattacks were reported by the end of 2019[1]. According to Emsisoft, in U.S. alone, the victims\nof ransomware include at least 113 government agencies, 89 educational establishments\nand 764 healthcare providers. The total amount of ransom demands tallies over $7.5 billion .\n\n[2]. In a report by Coveware, the average cost of ransom payment increased by 104% from\n\nthird to fourth quarter of 2019[3]. It is therefore hardly surprising that cybercriminals are\nenticed once again into developing and creating new ransomware variants. Amongst the\nprevalent ransomware last year was the Buran ransomware that emerged early May 2019\nand continues to proliferate until now. In a matter of just 9 months, this ransomware released\nover 5 updates by changing its code and attack vectors in order to stay stealthy and cause\nmore damage. By the end of last year, a new variant of ransomware known as Zeppelin was\nreleased. Upon initial analysis of Zeppelin, certain behaviors and parts of its source code\nhave been found to have similarities with Buran. This led us to identify Zeppelin as a new\nvariant of Buran.\n\n\n-----\n\n**November 2019**\n\n\n**May 2019**\n\n\nre-write at the image base\n\n\nan entry in AutoRunregistry.\n\n8itself with “-agent 1” argumentCreates a new instance of 6itself with “-agent 0” argumentCreates a new instance of 7 Terminates blacklisted processes 8 [Executes dropped copy with “-start” argument from a new Creates a new instance of itself with “-agent 0”location](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/fileadmin/web/general/images/blog/2020/03_2020/1_Zeppelin_Overview.SVG) 6 9 Drops a clipboard bankerMonitors for cryptocurrency address in clipboard7 a Buran and Zeppelin ransomware Overview\n\n9 Encrypts files on every\n\ndirectory not included in its list\nof whitelisted files, folders and\n\nfiletypes. 10\n\n10 Drops a ransom note in\n\ntext file format 11\n\n11 Opens a ransomnoteusing\n\nnotepad.exe 12\n\n## Attack Vector\n\nZeppelin is reaching its target networks primarily through phishing emails. These emails\ncontain macro-enabled documents that will initiate the download and execution of the\nransomware file on the victim’s machine. Moreover, other Zeppelin samples were also\ndistributed through malicious advertisements (malvertising) that are designed to trick its\nvictims into clicking fake advertisements which will trigger the download of the malicious file.\nLastly, Zeppelin, like other ransomware, utilizes the use of public remote desktop software\nvia web interfaces to remotely control a victim’s machine and execute the ransomware.\n\n## Installation\n\nLike Buran, Zeppelin will allocate a space in memory. When executed, it will perform its\ndecryption routine. However, compared to Buran’s straight forward routine, Zeppelin has\nsome changes to its code. For instance, it now harvests application programming\ninterface(APIs) that it will use later by loading it in the stack. After decrypting, it will re-write\nthe decrypted code to the base address of the file and execute it. It uses this obfuscation\ntechnique to make the analysis and signature detection of the file difficult.\n\nHarvesting of API\n\n\n-----\n\nJump at the decrypted PE file code\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main similarities of Zeppelin with Buran are its several system checks. It will first attempt\nto connect to the internet to make a query to hxxp://geoiptool.com. This isa valid web service\nthat checks the geolocation of a system with the use of an IP address,to verify where the file\nis currently being executed. If found to be running in either Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan or\nRussian Federation, it won’t proceed with its infection and terminate instantly. The malware\nauthors did this to make sure that the ransomware won’t infect any user living at the\nmentioned countries. This could be a hint that the ransomware originated from any of these\ncountries.\n\n\n-----\n\nHarvesting of API\n\nCountry Protection Check\nZeppelin also creates a registry key that will be used to store data. In the early variants of\nZeppelin, it still creates a “Buran” registry key which was later changed to Zeppelin. This is\none of the links between Buran and Zeppelin. Compared to Buran, which just creates several\ninstances of itself, Zeppelin drops an executable file inside the %APPDATA% directory with a\nfilename randomly chosen from a list of possible names. To ensure its persistence, it adds an\nautorun key to the registry that points to the path of the dropped file.\n\nZeppelin Registry Entry\n\n\n-----\n\nCreation of a copy of itself in a different location\nCompared to Buran, which just creates several instances of itself, Zeppelin drops an\nexecutable file inside the %APPDATA% directory with a filename randomly chosen from a list\nof possible names. To ensure its persistence, it adds an autorun key to the registry that\npoints to the path of the dropped file. The dropped file is a copy of itself which will be\nexecuted by using the “Shell Execute” API with “-start” argument.\n\nExecution of its copy with “-start”\n\n## Second Instance\n\nDiscovery of victim’s IP address using iplogger.org\n\nUpon execution of the dropped copy, it will decrypt the contents of its ransom note, then\nstore it in an allocated memory space for later use. Meanwhile, it will connect once again to\nthe Internet and make a query to geoiptools.com to recheck where it was executed. After\nthat, it will initiate a connection to iplogger.org, once again a legitimate web service used to\n\n\n-----\n\ntrack IP addresses, with the user-agent field id set to ZEPPELIN and the referrer field\ncontaining the unique ID of the victim. The malware author can use the IPLogger service to\nview the list of victims Zeppelin ransomware has.\n\nThe processes running in the victim’s system will be checked against a list of applications\nassociated with monitoring system processes and services, database, backups and web\nservices. If the name of the process can be found in the list, Zeppelin will force terminate the\nsaid processes, to ensure that maximum number of important data files will be encrypted.\n\nagntsvc.exe msaccess.exe sql.exe\n\nagntsvc.exeagntsvc.exe msftesql.exe sqlagent.exe\n\nagntsvc.exeencsvc.exe mspub.exe sqlbrowser.exe\n\nagntsvc.exeisqlplussvc.exe mydesktopqos.exe sqlserver.exe\n\nanvir.exe mydesktopservice.exe sqlservr.exe\n\nanvir64.exe mysqld-nt.exe sqlwriter.exe\n\napache.exe mysqld-opt.exe synctime.exe\n\nbackup.exe mysqld.exe taskkill.exe\n\nccleaner.exe ncsvc.exe tasklist.exe\n\nccleaner64.exe ocautoupds.exe taskmgr.exe\n\ndbeng50.exe ocomm.exe tbirdconfig.exe\n\ndbsnmp.exe ocssd.exe tomcat.exe\n\nencsvc.exe oracle.exe tomcat6.exe\n\nfar.exe u8.exe firefoxconfig.exe\n\nprocexp.exe ufida.exe infopath.exe\n\nregedit.exe visio.exe isqlplussvc.exe\n\nsqbcoreservice.exe xfssvccon.exe kingdee.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nDrops clipboard banker\n\nMonitors clipboard for cryptocurrency address\nThe second instance of Zeppelin enables the malware author to drop a version of Clipbanker\nin the %appdata%\\local\\temp directory and execute it as “winupas.exe”. This clipbanker is\nresponsible for monitoring the system’s clipboard for any strings that matches a\ncryptocurrency address. If a match is identified, clipbanker will replace the string to that of\nthe malware author’s cryptocurrency address so that any amount of cryptocurrency to be\ntransferred will be redirected to the malware author’s address. After that, Zeppelin will create\nanother instance of itself with “-agent 0” argument.\n\n## Third instance\n\nListing of all available drives\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third instance of Zeppelin is mainly for file encryption. First it will check available drives\nin the system by iterating drives from Z:\\ to A:\\. It only looks for certain drive types which are:\nunknown, removable, fixed, remote and RAM disk drives.\n\nThen, all directories except Windows Operating System-related, Internet browsers and\namong other folders, will be traversed to encrypt all files in it. These whitelisted folders and\nits files are avoided to ensure the proper execution of the malware.\n\nWhitelisted File Paths\n\nOne of the evident changes in Zeppelin is that the infection coverage is wider as it infects\nmore filetypes than Buran. For instance, Zeppelin not only infects document files but also\nexecutable files with “.exe” extension. This makes Zeppelin more destructive than Buran as it\nrenders the victim’s machine pretty much unusable by encrypting all software installed,\nunless the installation path is included in the whitelisted file paths. Every Zeppelin encrypted\nfile can easily be distinguished by an infection marker “ZEPPELIN” that can be seen at the\nbeginning of the file’s content. This infection marker makes it distinct from Buran, but at the\nsame time an indication that they are from the same family as they both leave infection\nmarkers at the start of each file using the same encryption routine. After all files in the\ndirectory are encrypted, a ransom note in text file format will be dropped. Lastly, it will open a\nransom note using notepad.exe to inform the victim of the infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nZeppelin Encryption including .exe files\n\nBuran Encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nRansom Note displayed by Zeppelin\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this day where we create faster solutions and detections, malware authors also adapt to\nthis by creating and releasing more malware updates to make sure that it stays relevant. This\nis evident in ransomware campaigns as malware authors get an extra motivation by gaining\nhuge sums of money in exchange for file recovery. Normally, ransomware only infects\ndocument files which is also the case with Buran. However, Zeppelin takes things a step\nfurther by targeting not only document related files but also applications and tools installed in\nthe victim’s system . This extent of damage gives Zeppelin more leverage for the victim to\npay the ransom. With this, delivering more advanced detections and solutions that will\nwithstand fast-paced changes of ransomware is needed. Just like G Data’s DeepRay\ntechnology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to protect its user from such\nsophisticated tactics of criminal hackers.\n\n## Information for fellow researchers\n\n**G DATA Detections:**\n\nBuran: Win32.Trojan-Ransom.Buran.A\n\nZeppelin: Win32.Trojan-Ransom.Zeppelin.A\n\n**IOC**\n\nBuran:\n\n7f0dcd4b9d8881fd0c42a6d605f843c496b7ed1fc3ae3a29d0bd37e851eaadfb\n\n\n-----\n\nZeppelin:\n1cefe918ae56ebd3c2de309efbdd3a99808c823615a11a58bf144d3d6699f69b\n\n## References\n\n[1] hxxps://www.symantec.com/blogs/expert-perspectives/ransomware-activity-declinesremains-dangerous-threat\n\n[2] hxxps://blog.emsisoft.com/en/34822/the-state-of-ransomware-in-the-us-report-andstatistics-2019/\n\n[3] hxxps://www.coveware.com/blog/2020/1/22/ransomware-costs-double-in-q4-as-ryuksodinokibi-proliferate\n\n**G DATA Security Lab**\n\nVirus-Analyst Team\n\n\n-----",
