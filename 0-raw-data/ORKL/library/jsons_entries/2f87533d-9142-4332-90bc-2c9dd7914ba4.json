Zoë\n**van Dijk for NPR hide caption**\n\n**toggle caption**\nZoë van Dijk for NPR\n\nAn NPR investigation into the SolarWinds attack reveals a hack unlike any other, launched\nby a sophisticated adversary intent on exploiting the soft underbelly of our digital lives.\n\nZoë van Dijk for NPR\n_\"This release includes bug fixes, increased stability and performance improvements.\"_\n\nThe routine software update may be one of the most familiar and least understood parts of\nour digital lives. A pop-up window announces its arrival and all that is required of us is to plug\neverything in before bed. The next morning, rather like the shoemaker and the elves, our\nsoftware is magically transformed.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast spring, a Texas-based company called SolarWinds made one such software update\navailable to its customers. It was supposed to provide the regular fare — bug fixes,\nperformance enhancements — to the company's popular network management system, a\nsoftware program called Orion that keeps a watchful eye on all the various components in a\ncompany's network. Customers simply had to log into the company's software development\nwebsite, type a password and then wait for the update to land seamlessly onto their servers.\n\nThe routine update, it turns out, is no longer so routine.\n\nHackers believed to be directed by the Russian intelligence service, the SVR, used that\nroutine software update to slip malicious code into Orion's software and then used it as a\nvehicle for a massive cyberattack against America.\n\n\"Eighteen thousand [customers] was our best estimate of who may have downloaded the\ncode between March and June of 2020,\" Sudhakar Ramakrishna, SolarWinds president and\nCEO, told NPR. \"If you then take 18,000 and start sifting through it, the actual number of\nimpacted customers is far less. We don't know the exact numbers. We are still conducting\nthe investigation.\"\n\n[On Thursday, the Biden administration announced a roster of tough sanctions against Russia](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/15/987585796/u-s-slaps-new-sanctions-on-russia-over-cyber-attack-election-meddling)\nas part of what it characterized as the \"seen and unseen\" response to the SolarWinds\nbreach.\n\nNPR's months-long examination of that landmark attack — based on interviews with dozens\nof players from company officials to victims to cyber forensics experts who investigated, and\nintelligence officials who are in the process of calibrating the Biden administration's response\n— reveals a hack unlike any other, launched by a sophisticated adversary who took aim at a\nsoft underbelly of digital life: the routine software update.\n\nBy design, the hack appeared to work only under very specific circumstances. Its victims had\nto download the tainted update and then actually deploy it. That was the first condition. The\nsecond was that their compromised networks needed to be connected to the Internet, so the\nhackers could communicate with their servers.\n\nFor that reason, Ramakrishna figures the Russians successfully compromised about 100\ncompanies and about a dozen government agencies. The companies included Microsoft,\nIntel and Cisco; the list of federal agencies so far includes the Treasury, Justice and Energy\ndepartments and the Pentagon.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/13/gettyimages-1231345127-edit_custom-3947642a810c9a66e7564591c9fa76646b109424-s1200.jpg)\nSolarWinds CEO and President Sudhakar Ramakrishna inherited the attack. He was hired\nshortly before the breach was discovered and stepped into the job just as the full extent of\nthe hack became clear.

He was hired\nshortly before the breach was discovered and stepped into the job just as the full extent of\nthe hack became clear.\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\nThe hackers also found their way, rather embarrassingly, into the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency, or CISA — the office at the Department of Homeland Security\nwhose job it is to protect federal computer networks from cyberattacks.\n\nThe concern is that the same access that gives the Russians the ability to steal data could\nalso allow them to alter or destroy it. \"The speed with which an actor can move from\nespionage to degrading or disrupting a network is at the blink of an eye,\" one senior\nadministration said during a background briefing from the White House on Thursday. \"And a\ndefender cannot move at that speed. And given the history of Russia's malicious activity in\ncyberspace and their reckless behavior in cyberspace, that was a key concern.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**The tradecraft was phenomenal**\n\nNetwork monitoring software is a key part of the backroom operations we never see.\nPrograms like Orion allow information technology departments to look on one screen and\ncheck their whole network: servers or firewalls, or that printer on the fifth floor that keeps\ngoing offline. By its very nature, it touches everything — which is why hacking it was genius.\n\n\"It's really your worst nightmare,\" Tim Brown, vice president of security at SolarWinds, said\nrecently. \"You feel a kind of horror. This had the potential to affect thousands of customers;\nthis had the potential to do a great deal of harm.\"\n\nWhen cybersecurity experts talk about harm, they're thinking about something like what\nhappened in 2017, when the Russian military launched a ransomware attack known as\nNotPetya. It, too, began with tainted software, but in that case the hackers were bent on\ndestruction. They planted ransomware that paralyzed multinational companies and\npermanently locked people around the world out of tens of thousands of computers. Even\n[this much later, it is considered the most destructive and costly cyberattack in history.](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\n\nIntelligence officials worry that SolarWinds might presage something on that scale. Certainly,\nthe hackers had time to do damage. They roamed around American computer networks for\nnine months, and it is unclear whether they were just reading emails and doing the things\nspies typically do, or whether they were planting something more destructive for use in the\nfuture.\n\n\"When there's cyber-espionage conducted by nations, FireEye is on the target list,\" Kevin\nMandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, told NPR, but he believes there are other\nless obvious targets that now might need more protecting. \"I think utilities might be on that\nlist. I think health care might be on that list. And you don't necessarily want to be on the list of\nfair game for the most capable offense to target you.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/15/gettyimages-1231345249-14f45d671559f2fbba3e081052d53bb9120520ca-s1200.jpg)\nKevin Mandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the Russians didn't just attack\nSolarWinds, they took aim at trust. Demetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images hide caption\n\n**toggle caption**\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nKevin Mandia, CEO of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the Russians didn't just attack\nSolarWinds, they took aim at trust.\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\nThe SolarWinds attackers ran a master class in novel hacking techniques. They modified\nsealed software code, created a system that used domain names to select targets and\nmimicked the Orion software communication protocols so they could hide in plain sight. And\nthen, they did what any good operative would do: They cleaned the crime scene so\nthoroughly investigators can't prove definitively who was behind it. The White House has said\nunequivocally that Russian intelligence was behind the hack. Russia, for its part, has denied\nany involvement.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tradecraft was phenomenal, said Adam Meyers, who led the cyber forensics team that\npawed through that tainted update on behalf of SolarWinds, providing details for the first time\nabout what they found. The code was elegant and innovative, he said, and then added, \"This\nwas the craziest f***ing thing I'd ever seen.\"\n\n**Like razor blades in peanut butter cups**\n\nMeyers is the vice president for threat intelligence at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and\nhe's seen epic attacks up close. He worked on the 2014 Sony hack, when North Korea\ncracked into the company's servers and released emails and first-run movies. A year later,\nhe was on the front lines when a suspected Kremlin-backed hacking team known as \"Cozy\nBear\" stole, among other things, a trove of emails from the Democratic National Committee.\nWikiLeaks then released them in the runup to the 2016 election.\n\n\"We're involved in all kinds of incidents around the globe every day,\" Meyers said. Typically\nhe directs teams, he doesn't run them. But SolarWinds was different: \"When I started getting\nbriefed up, I realized [this] was actually quite a big deal.\"\n\nThe attack began with a tiny strip of code. Meyers traced it back to Sept. 12, 2019. \"This little\nsnippet of code doesn't do anything,\" Meyers said. \"It's literally just checking to see which\nprocessor is running on the computer, if it is a 32- or 64-bit processor and if it is one or the\nother, it returns either a zero or a one.\"\n\n### National Security\n\n U.S. Slaps New Sanctions On Russia Over Cyberattack, Election Meddling\n\n Investigations\n\n Why Russia May Have Stepped Up Its Hacking Game\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code fragment, it turns out, was a proof of concept — a little trial balloon to see if it was\npossible to modify SolarWinds' signed-and-sealed software code, get it published and then\nlater see it in a downloaded version. And they realized they could. \"So at this point, they\nknow that they can pull off a supply chain attack,\" Meyers said. \"They know that they have\nthat capability.\"\n\nAfter that initial success, the hackers disappeared for five months. When they returned in\nFebruary 2020, Meyers said, they came armed with an amazing new implant that delivered a\nbackdoor that went into the software itself before it was published.\n\nTo understand why that was remarkable, you need to know that finished software code has a\nkind of digital factory seal. If you break that seal, someone can see it and know that the code\nmight have been tampered with. Meyers said the hackers essentially found a way to get\nunder that factory seal.\n\nThey began by implanting code that told them any time someone on the SolarWinds\ndevelopment team was getting ready to build new software. They understood that the\nprocess of creating software or an update typically begins with something routine such as\nchecking a code out of a digital repository, sort of like checking a book out of the library.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, developers take the code out of the repository, make changes\nand then check it back in. Once they finish tinkering, they initiate something called the build\nprocess, which essentially translates the code a human can read to the code a computer\ndoes. At that point, the code is clean and tested. What the hackers did after that was the\ntrick.\n\nThey would create a temporary update file with the malicious code inside while the\nSolarWinds code was compiling. The hackers' malicious code told the machine to swap in\ntheir temporary file instead of the SolarWinds version. \"I think a lot of people probably\nassume that it is the source code that's been modified,\" Meyers said, but instead the hackers\nused a kind of bait-and-switch.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/15/180911_crowdstrike_adammeyers-81_pp_custom-7f5aafb3fb52e13f5b635860844176deef0b6299-s1400.jpg)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdam Meyers, vice president for threat intelligence at CrowdStrike, said when he became\nfamiliar with the SolarWinds attack, he knew it was a big deal. Oscar Zagal Studio hide\n**caption**\n\n**toggle caption**\nOscar Zagal Studio\n\nAdam Meyers, vice president for threat intelligence at CrowdStrike, said when he became\nfamiliar with the SolarWinds attack, he knew it was a big deal.\n\nOscar Zagal Studio\nBut this, Meyers said, was interesting, too. The hackers understood that companies such as\nSolarWinds typically audit code before they start building an update, just to make sure\neverything is as it should be. So they made sure that the switch to the temporary file\nhappened at the last possible second, when the updates went from source code (readable\nby people) to executable code (which the computer reads) to the software that goes out to\ncustomers.\n\nThe technique reminded Meyers of old fears around trick-or-treating. For decades, there had\nbeen an urban myth that kids couldn't eat any Halloween candy before checking the wrapper\nseal because bad people might have put razor blades inside. What the hackers did with the\ncode, Meyers said, was a little like that.\n\n\"Imagine those Reese's Peanut Butter Cups going into the package and just before the\nmachine comes down and seals the package, some other thing comes in and slides a razor\nblade into your Reese's Peanut Butter Cup,\" he said. Instead of a razor blade, the hackers\nswapped the files so \"the package gets sealed and it goes out the door to the store.\"\n\nThe update that went out to SolarWinds' customers was the dangerous peanut butter cup —\nthe malicious version of the software included code that would give the hackers unfettered,\nundetected access to any Orion user who downloaded and deployed the update and was\nconnected to the Internet.\n\nBut there was something else about that code that bothered Meyers: It wasn't just for\nSolarWinds. \"When we looked at [it], it could have been reconfigured for any number of\nsoftware products,\" Meyers said. In other words, any number of other software developers\nusing the same compiler may also be on the receiving end of a cyberattack, he said, and\nthey just don't know it yet.\n\n**Picking and choosing targets**\n\nMeyers said it's hard not to admire just how much thought the hackers put into this operation.\nConsider the way they identified targets. The downside of breaking into so many customer\nnetworks all at once is that it is hard to decide what to exploit first. So the hackers created a\n\n\n-----\n\npassive domain name server system that sent little messages with not just an IP address,\nwhich is just a series of numbers, but also with a thumbnail profile of a potential target.\n\n\"So they could then say, 'OK, we're going to go after this dot gov target or whatever,' \"\nMeyers said. \"I think later it became clear that there were a lot of government technology\ncompanies being targeted.\"\n\nThe hackers also reverse-engineered the way Orion communicated with servers and built\ntheir own coding instructions mimicking Orion's syntax and formats. What that did is allow the\nhackers to look like they were \"speaking\" Orion, so their message traffic looked like a natural\nextension of the software.\n\n\"So once they determined that a target was of interest, they could say, 'OK, let's go active,\nlet's manipulate files, let's change something,' \" Meyers said, and then they would slip in\nunnoticed through the backdoor they had created. \"And there is one other thing I should\nmention: This backdoor would wait up to two weeks before it actually went active on the host.\nThis was a very patient adversary.\"\n\nNone of the tripwires put in place by private companies or the government seems to have\nseen the attack coming. Christopher Krebs, who had been in charge of the office that\nprotected government networks at DHS during the Trump administration, told NPR that DHS'\ncurrent system, something known (without irony) as Einstein, only catches known threats.\nThe SolarWinds breach, he said, was just \"too novel.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/14/gettyimages-863050386-892c4234c7b3501d8178270167acff2aab616342-s1200.jpg)\nChristopher Krebs, who was in charge of protecting government networks during the Trump\nadministration, said the SolarWinds breach used techniques that were \"too novel\" for the\ncurrent system to catch. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\n**toggle caption**\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nChristopher Krebs, who was in charge of protecting government networks during the Trump\nadministration, said the SolarWinds breach used techniques that were \"too novel\" for the\ncurrent system to catch.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\"Upwards of 90[%] to 95% of threats are based on known techniques, known cyberactivity,\"\nKrebs explained. \"And that's not just criminal actors, that's state actors, too, including the\nRussian intelligence agencies and the Russian military. This was a previously unidentified\ntechnique.\"\n\nAnd there is something else that Einstein doesn't do: It doesn't scan software updates. So\neven if the hackers had used code that Einstein would have recognized as bad, the system\nmight not have seen it because it was delivered in one of those routine software updates.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe National Security Agency and the military s U.S. Cyber Command were also caught flatfooted. Broadly speaking, their cyber operators sit in foreign networks looking for signs of\ncyberattacks before they happen. They can see suspicious activity in much the same way a\nsatellite might see troops amassing on the border. Critics said they should have seen the\nhackers from the Russian intelligence service, the SVR, preparing this attack.\n\n\"The SVR has a pretty good understanding that the NSA is looking out,\" Krebs said. \"What\nthe SVR was able to do was make the transition from wherever they were operating from into\nthe U.S. networks. They move like ghosts. They are very hard to track.\"\n\nThe hackers didn't do anything fancy to give them the domestic footprint, officials confirmed.\nIn fact, they just rented servers from Amazon and GoDaddy.\n\n**Early warnings**\n\nThere were some indications, elsewhere, though, that something was wrong.\n\nIn early July, Steven Adair, the founder of a Washington, D.C.-based cybersecurity company\ncalled Volexity, saw some suspicious activity on a client's computers. \"We traced it back, and\nwe thought it might be related to a bad update with SolarWinds,\" Adair told NPR. \"We\naddressed the problem, made sure no one was in our customers' systems, and we left it at\nthat.\"\n\nAdair said he didn't feel he had enough detail to report the problem to SolarWinds or the U.S.\ngovernment. \"We thought we didn't have enough evidence to reach out,\" he said.\n\nThat was the first missed sign.\n\nThe second came three months later when a California-based cybersecurity company called\nPalo Alto Networks discovered a malicious backdoor that seemed to emanate from the Orion\nsoftware.\n\nThey move like ghosts. They are very hard to track.\n\nChristopher Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n\nIn that case, according to SolarWinds' Ramakrishna, the security teams at SolarWinds and\nPalo Alto worked together for three months to try to pick up the thread of the problem and\nwalk it back. \"None of us could pinpoint a supply chain attack at that point,\" Ramakrishna\ntold NPR. \"The ticket got closed as a result of that. If we had the benefit of hindsight, we\ncould have traced it back\" to the hack.\n\nPalo Alto Networks had agreed to speak to NPR about the incident last month and then\ncanceled the interview just an hour before it was supposed to take place. A spokesperson\n[declined to say why and sent a few blog posts and wrote: \"I'm afraid this is all we have to](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/12/solarwinds-statement-solarstorm/)\nhelp at this time.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Just 3,500 lines long**\n\nIt was the cybersecurity firm FireEye that finally discovered the intrusion. Mandia, the\ncompany's CEO, used to be in the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, so his\nspecialty was criminal cases and counterintelligence. In the intervening years, the kinds of\npatterns he learned to recognize in special investigations kept appearing in his cyber security\nwork.\n\nThe first indication that hackers had found their way into FireEye's networks came in an\ninnocuous way. Someone on the FireEye security team had noticed that an employee\nappeared to have two phones registered on his network, so she called him. \"And that phone\ncall is when we realized, hey, this isn't our employee registering that second phone, it was\nsomebody else,\" Mandia said.\n\nMandia had a security briefing a short time later and everything he heard reminded him of his\nprevious work in the military. \"There was a lot of pattern recognition from me,\" he told NPR. \"I\nspent from 1996 to 1998 responding to what I would equate to the Russian Foreign\nIntelligence Service, and there were some indicators in the first briefing that were consistent\nwith my experience in the Air Force.\"\n\nHe called a board meeting the same day. \"It just felt like the breach that I was always worried\nabout.\"\n\nWhat his team discovered over the course of several weeks was that not only was there an\nintruder in its network, but someone had stolen the arsenal of hacking tools FireEye uses to\ntest the security of its own clients' networks. FireEye called the FBI, put together a detailed\nreport, and once it had determined the Orion software was the source of the problem, it\ncalled SolarWinds.\n\nBrown, vice president of security at SolarWinds, took the Saturday morning phone call. \"He\nsaid, 'Essentially, we've decompiled your code. We found malicious code,' \" Brown said.\nFireEye was sure SolarWinds \"had shipped tainted code.\"\n\nThe tainted code had allowed hackers into FireEye's network, and there were bound to be\nothers who were compromised, too. \"We were hearing that different reporters had the scoop\nalready,\" Mandia said. \"My phone actually rang from a reporter and that person knew and I\nwent, OK, we're in a race.\"\n\nMandia thought they had about a day before the story would break.\n\nAfter that, events seemed to speed up. SolarWinds' chief security officer, Brown, called Ron\nPlesco, a lawyer at the firm DLA Piper, and told him what had happened. One of the first\nthings companies tend to do after cyberattacks is hire lawyers, and they put them in charge\nof the investigation. They do this for a specific reason — it means everything they find is\nprotected by attorney-client privilege and typically is not discoverable in court.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/13/solarwinds_ron-plesco_05_slide-02c85d564f03765766e6c7b4453a1616f797d4fc-s1200.jpg)\nRon Plesco, a lawyer with the firm DLA Piper, has made cybercrimes a specialty of his\npractice. \"I've been in situations where, while you're in there doing the investigation, [hackers\nare] watching your email, they're compromising your phone calls or your Zooms,\" he said.\n**Kriston Jae Bethel for NPR hide caption**\n\n**toggle caption**\nKriston Jae Bethel for NPR\n\nRon Plesco, a lawyer with the firm DLA Piper, has made cybercrimes a specialty of his\npractice. \"I've been in situations where, while you're in there doing the investigation, [hackers\nare] watching your email, they're compromising your phone calls or your Zooms,\" he said.\n\nKriston Jae Bethel for NPR\nPlesco, who has made cybercrimes a specialty of his practice, knew that once the story\nbroke it would be saying \"to the world that, ready, set, go, come after it,\" Plesco said. \"So\nthat puts you on an accelerated timeline on two fronts: Figure out what happened if you can\nand get a fix out as soon as possible.\"\n\n[The company worked with DHS to craft a statement that went out on Dec. 13.](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network)\n\nTo investigate a hack, you have to secure a digital crime scene. Just as detectives in the\nphysical world have to bag the evidence and dust for prints for the investigation later,\nSolarWinds had to pull together computer logs, make copies of files, ensure there was a\n\n\n-----\n\nrecorded chain of custody, all while trying to ensure the hackers weren t inside its system\nwatching everything they did.\n\n\"I've been in situations where, while you're in there doing the investigation, they're watching\nyour email, they're compromising your phone calls or your Zooms,\" Plesco said. \"So they're\nliterally listening in on how you're going to try to get rid of them.\"\n\nBy mid-January, Meyers and the CrowdStrike team had isolated what they thought was the\nattack's tiny beating heart. It was an elegant, encrypted little blob of code \"just 3,500 lines\nlong,\" he said. The best code is short and to the point, like a well-written sentence. This little\nencrypted strip, Meyers thought, might help them figure out who was behind the attack.\n\n**Little blobs of clues**\n\nThink of forensic cyber teams as digital detectives looking for patterns. Coding tics can\nsometimes help identify perpetrators or sometimes forensic teams find small cultural artifacts\n— such as Persian script, or Korean hangul. When an elite Russian hacking team took over\nthe electrical grid in Ukraine in 2015, it had more literary aspirations: It sprinkled its malicious\ncode with references to Frank Herbert's Dune novels. That's why CrowdStrike found that little\nblob of malicious code so intriguing.\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/13/solarwinds_ron-plesco_15_custom-294bf25f21fe68d998d057f16b9d38ab2a767e03-s1200.jpg)\nPlesco shows a timeline of the SolarWinds hack on his computer.

He shared his screen so\neveryone could all watch the encryption fall away in real time. He began walking the\nspectators through the code as it was revealed, like a play-by-play analysis of a game.\nMeyers kept watching for the big reveal. \"We're hoping it's going to have, you know, variable\nnames or maybe some comments in Cyrillic or Mandarin to give us some clue who wrote this\nthing,\" he said.\n\nBut as CrowdStrike's decryption program chewed its way through the zeroes and ones,\nMeyers' heart sank. The crime scene was a bust. It had been wiped down. \"They'd washed\nthe code,\" Meyers said. \"They'd cleaned it of any human artifact or tool mark. And that was\nkind of mind-blowing that [they] had the wherewithal to hide anything that a human might\nhave inadvertently left behind as a clue.\"\n\nHoly s***, he thought to himself, who does that?\n\n**Just type \"solarwinds123\"**\n\nAgainst such a sophisticated hack, it is easy to suggest this could have happened to just\nabout any software company. But there were some troubling signs at SolarWinds that may\nhave made it a target.\n\nConsider its online marketing website. It contained a list of clients, including specific\ncompanies and government agencies, that ran its Orion software. While a lot of companies\ndo that, the SolarWinds site was very specific. It was, two cybersecurity analysts told NPR,\nlike a shopping list for adversaries.\n\nRamakrishna pushed back on the criticism. \"Lots of companies do it. That is their badge of\nhonor, saying all these customers rely on my technology,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say that was\nthe reason for why we were targeted.\" Ramakrishna said the hackers were \"a lot more\nsophisticated\" than that. Shortly after the attack, though, that particular page on the\nmarketing website was taken down.\n\nThere was another unsettling report about passwords. A security researcher in Bangalore,\nIndia, named Vinoth Kumar told NPR that he had found the password to a server with\nSolarWinds apps and tools on a public message board and the password was:\n\"solarwinds123.\" Kumar said he sent a message to SolarWinds in November and got an\nautomated response back thanking him for his help and saying the problem had been fixed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen NPR asked SolarWinds vice president of security, Brown, about this, he said that the\npassword \"had nothing to do with this event at all, it was a password to a FTP site.\" An FTP\nsite is what you use to transfer files over the Internet. He said the password was shared by\nan intern and it was \"not an account that was linked to our active directory.\"\n\nRamakrishna said it was a password for a third-party site where some of SolarWinds' tools\nand apps were available for download. Ramakrishna admitted, though, that while the matter\nwas unconnected to the breach, it was a problem to have that kind of password on a site that\ncontained something someone might download thinking it was a SolarWinds product.\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/15/gettyimages-1230263664-edit_custom-bd798b9ef92ae319900992e1d349f30f6d5b30b3-s1200.jpg)\nThe SolarWinds attackers were masters in novel hacking techniques.

The White House has\nsaid Russian intelligence was behind the hack. Russia has denied any involvement.\n\nBronte Wittpenn/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\n-----\n\nWe used that as another opportunity to reeducate everybody on password policies, he said.\n\"I do not want to minimize it or be casual about it, but I want to highlight that it had nothing to\ndo\" with the attack on Orion.\n\nRamakrishna inherited this attack. He was hired as the SolarWinds CEO shortly before the\nbreach was discovered and stepped into the top job just as the full extent of the hack\nbecame clear. In a way, that has given him an incredible freedom. He can't be blamed for\nsomething that happened before he got there, and the changes he's making could be seen in\nthe context of a new man in charge instead of a response to the attack.\n\nShortly after he arrived, he published a long blog post providing what was essentially an 11point plan to improve company security. \"Armed with what we have learned of this attack, we\n[are also reflecting on our own security practices,\" he wrote in the blog post, adding that his](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/07/our-plan-for-a-safer-solarwinds-and-customer-community/)\ngoal was to put in place an \"immediate improvement of critical business and product\ndevelopment systems.\"\n\nRamakrishna said he planned to transform SolarWinds into a truly \"secure by design\"\norganization with more robust threat protection and detection tools across its network, with a\nparticular focus on where it developed and built software — the places that the SVR hackers\nused to break in.\n\nHe said he would establish privileged accounts and all accounts used by anybody who had\nanything to do with Orion and the company would enforce multifactor authentication, or MFA,\nacross the board.\n\n\"If I come up with an 11-point plan to improve my company's security, one interpretation of\nthat could be that we have learned a valuable lesson from what the hack was,\" said Ian\nThornton-Trump, chief information security officer at Cyjax, a threat intelligence company.\n\"The other interpretation could be, is that there were at least 11 material deficiencies in the\nactual security we had. I see that the 11-point plan is actually an admission that things were\nnot good in this security house.\"\n\nThornton-Trump used to work at SolarWinds and was on the security team. Thornton-Trump\nleft the company in 2017 because, by his own account, SolarWinds' management (Kevin\nThompson was CEO at the time. Ramakrishna wouldn't arrive for another three years.) didn't\nwant to spend enough on security.\n\n\n-----\n\nThornton-Trump concedes that the hackers who broke into the company were so\nsophisticated it would have been hard for anyone to defend against them. \"But if you're\ndriving drunk, rolling down the road, and it was raining and you smash up your car,\" he said,\n\"why are we focused so much on the damage to the car, instead of what actually led up to\nthe series of events that led to the great undoing?\"\n\nIn other words, does the overhaul of SolarWinds' security practices add up to an admission\nthat something was wrong, or is it simply a responsible upgrade?\n\nRamakrishna said it was both. \"Oftentimes what happens is people conduct investigations,\nidentify learnings and then implement something like this,\" he said. \"Can we do things\nbetter? Absolutely. And honestly, even after implementing these 11 things, I'll be looking for\nthe next 11 things to work on because the adversaries are becoming smarter and smarter\nevery single day.\"\n\nRamakrishna said he wonders why, of all the software companies it had to choose from, the\nRussian intelligence service ended up targeting SolarWinds.\n\n\"I've thought about this quite a bit as to why us, why not somebody else,\" he said. \"And that\ngoes on through any investigation. As you think about this, we are deployed in more than\n300,000 customers today. And so we are fairly broadly deployed software and where we\nenjoy administrative privileges in customer environments. So in a supply chain attack like\nthis, the goal will be to try to get a broad swath of deployment and then you pick and choose\nwhat you want to do from there.\"\n\nWhatever the reason SolarWinds ended up in the crosshairs, the attack revealed the U.S.\ncyber community's spectacular inability to connect the dots. Not just the early warnings from\nVolexity or the investigation with Palo Alto Networks, but a simple discovery from a lone\ncyber researcher in Bangalore suggests that something is not right in our digital world.\n\n**Bigger attacks**\n\n\"It's one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time,\" said Alex Stamos,\ndirector of the Internet Observatory at Stanford University and the former head of security at\nFacebook. \"In doing so, they demonstrated not just technical acumen, but the way they did\nthis demonstrated that they understand how tech companies operate, how software\ncompanies operate. ... This certainly is going to change the way that large enterprises think\nabout the software they install and think about how they handle updates.\"\n\nThe adversaries are becoming smarter and smarter every single day.\n\n\n-----\n\nSudhakar Ramakrishna, SolarWinds CEO and president\n\nIntelligence analysts, already years ahead of the rest of us, are paid to imagine the darkest\nof scenarios. What if the hackers planted the seeds of future attacks during that nine months\nthey explored SolarWinds' customer networks — did they hide code for backdoors that will\nallow them to come and go as they please at a time of their choosing? When hackers shut\ndown the Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and disabled a Saudi refinery with computer code a\nyear later, they showed it was possible to jump from a corporate network to system controls.\nWill we find out later that the SolarWinds hack set the stage for something more sinister?\n\nEven if this was just an espionage operation, FireEye's Mandia said, the attack on\nSolarWinds is an inflection point. \"We ... kind of mapped out the evolution of threats and\ncyber,\" he said. \"And we would have landed at this day sooner or later, that at some point in\ntime, software that many companies depend on is going to get targeted and it's going to lead\nto exactly what it led to,\" Mandia said. \"But to see it happen, that's where you have a little bit\nof shock and surprise. OK, it's here now, nations are targeting [the] private sector, there's no\nmagic wand you can shake. ... It's a real complex issue to solve.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is working on a second executive order — beyond the sanctions —\nthat is supposed to address some of the issues SolarWinds has put in stark relief.\n\nAnne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology in\ncharge of the SolarWinds attack response, is preparing an order that would, among other\nthings, require companies that work with the U.S. government to meet certain software\nstandards, and federal agencies would be required to adopt basic security practices such as\nencrypting data in their systems.\n\nIn addition, software companies such as SolarWinds could be required to have their socalled build systems — the place where they assemble their software — air-gapped, which\nmeans they would not be connected to the Internet. Those elements are all still under\ndiscussion as part of the executive order, NPR has learned.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/04/14/gettyimages-1231220797-070413fefc1632a2c56cc8d7cfb0fff00ce3dc2c-s1200.jpg)\nAnne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, is in\ncharge of the SolarWinds attack response.

She is preparing an order that would require\ncompanies that work with the U.S. to meet certain software standards, and federal agencies\nwould be required to adopt certain basic security practices.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\nAnother idea starting to gain traction is to create a kind of National Transportation Safety\nBoard, or NTSB, to investigate cyberattacks in a more formal way.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the Boeing 737 Maxes started crashing, there was a government agency whose\nentire job it was to gather up the facts of all those different crashes and then come up with a\ntheory of what needed to be fixed and then oversaw the fixes that went into that,\" Stamos\nsaid. \"We need the same kind of function in the U.S. government.\"\n\nThe FBI could do its investigation of the cybercrime and some sort of federal agency would\nlook at the root causes of a cyberattack and make the appropriate changes to the way we do\nthings. Mandia said something like that probably needs to exist.\n\n\"When you think about the conflict, you have air, land and sea and space and now cyber,\" he\nsaid. \"But in cyber, the private sector is front and center. Any conflict in cyberspace, whether\nmotivated by a criminal element or motivated by geopolitical conditions, it's going to involve\nboth the government and the private sector. And that response, because it impacts both, you\nalmost need a triage that both sides, both private and public sector, benefit from similar to\nthe NTSB.\"\n\nMandia envisions a review board for significant incidents where intelligence is gathered and\nthe nation finds a way to defend itself appropriately. Right now, the onus is on private\ncompanies to do all the investigations.\n\nA Biden administration official told reporters during a background briefing Thursday that one\nreason the White House responded so strongly to the SolarWinds attack is because these\nkinds of hacks put an undue burden on private companies.\n\nIt's one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time.\n\nAlex Stamos, director of the Internet Observatory at Stanford University and former head of\nsecurity at Facebook\n\nA federal review might help with one of the issues that has plagued cyberspace up to now:\nhow to ensure software and hardware vendors disclose hacks when they discover them.\nCould a review board take the sting out of the reputation damage of admitting publicly you've\nbeen hacked? Would it give companies such as Volexity and Palo Alto Networks somewhere\nto go when they see a problem?\n\nUltimately, the goal is to connect the dots and respond in a way that makes us safer. And the\nimpetus for all of this might be that tainted routine update. That's one of the key reasons\nSolarWinds decided to go public, Ramakrishna said.\n\n\"We went out and published the entire source code because what we wanted people to do,\nno matter the vendor, whether it could be a competitor of ours or not, is to check your\nsoftware, make sure you don't have a situation like this, and if there is, clean it up,\" he said.\n\"So while it was unfortunate that we were the subject of this attack, my hope is, by us\nlearning from it, we can also help the broader community.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nEven so, there are parts of this story that may sound familiar: missed opportunities, hints of a\nproblem that were ignored, the failure of U.S. intelligence officials to connect the dots. Who\nwould have thought a routine software update could launch a cyberattack of epic\nproportions?\n\n\"This was an intelligence collection operation meant to steal information, and it's not the last\ntime that's going to happen,\" CrowdStrike's Meyers warned. \"This is going to happen every\nday. ... And I think there's a lot that we all need to do to work together to stop this from\nhappening.\"\n\n_NPR's Monika Evstatieva contributed to this report._\n\n**Special Series**\n\n## Untangling Disinformation\n\n\n-----",
