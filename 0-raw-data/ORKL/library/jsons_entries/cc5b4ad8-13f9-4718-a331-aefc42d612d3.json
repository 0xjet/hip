CISA, FBI, and HHS are sharing this\ninformation to provide warning to healthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and\n[reasonable precautions to protect their networks from these threats,\" the advisory states.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a)\n\nIn the past two days, Sky Lakes Medical Center in Oregon and St. Lawrence Health System\nin New York were both hit in Ryuk ransomware attacks that impact the treatment of patients.\n[Last month, hospital operator Universal Health Services was hit by a corporate-wide Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/)\nattack, which impacted over 200 medical facilities nationwide.\n\n## UNC1878 hacking group behind threat\n\n\n-----\n\nCharles Carmakal, senior vice president and CTO of Mandiant, told BleepingComputer that\na hacking group known as UNC1878 is behind the Ryuk attacks on the healthcare industry.\n\n\"We are experiencing the most significant cyber security threat we’ve ever seen in the\nUnited States. UNC1878, an Eastern European financially motivated threat actor, is\ndeliberately targeting and disrupting U.S. hospitals, forcing them to divert patients to other\nhealthcare providers. Patients may experience prolonged wait time to receive critical care,\"\nCarmakal said in a statement to BleepingComputer.\n\nIn a conversation with Carmakal, BleepingComputer was told that this group is highly\nefficient, with ransomware being deployed in some cases within 45 minutes of a network\nbeing compromised.\n\nVictims are then left with 7-8 figure ransom demands to get a decryptor for their encrypted\nfiles.\n\nAt the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic, BleepingComputer reached out to different\nransomware operations to see if they would continue to attack healthcare and medical\norganizations.\n\nWhile most ransomware gangs said they would decrypt hospitals for free, Ryuk\nransomware did not respond to our queries.\n\n## From BazarLoader to Ryuk\n\nLately, Ryuk attacks usually start with a phishing campaign that installs the\n[BazarLoader/KegTap infection on a recipient's computer.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bazarbackdoor-trickbot-gang-s-new-stealthy-network-hacking-malware/)\n\nThe phishing emails are targeted at a particular organization and can include lures ranging\nfrom invoices to customer complaints, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**BazarLoader phishing email directed at BleepingComputer**\nThese emails include links to Google Docs that pretend to be PDFs that cannot be\npreviewed correctly. These docs prompt the user to click on a link to download the\ndocument.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Phishing email landing page**\nThe downloaded file is an executable that will install the BazarLoader infection onto a\nvictim's computer when executed.\n\nWhen installed, BazarLoader will eventually deploy Cobalt Strike, which allows threat actors\nto remotely access the victim's computer and use it to compromise the rest of the network.\n\n**BazarLoader attack flow**\n\nSource: [Advanced Intel](https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/front-door-into-bazarbackdoor-stealthy-cybercrime-weapon)\n\n\n-----\n\nTo quickly gain Windows domain admin credentials, Carmakal told BleepingComputer that\n[the group had been seen using the Windows ZeroLogon vulnerability. For this reason,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-hackers-using-zerologon-exploits-in-attacks-patch-now/)\nusers must install necessary patches on all Windows servers.\n\nAfter gaining access to a Windows domain controller, the attackers deploy the Ryuk\nransomware on the network to encrypt all of its devices, as illustrated in the diagram above.\n\nAdvanced Intel's Vitali Kremez told BleepingComputer that their Andariel threat prevention\nplatform has been tracking an increased amount of attacks against healthcare using\nBazarLoader.\n\n\"The crime group behind continues to target various industries including healthcare.\nCurrently, the healthcare and social services targeting comprises 13.36% of the total victim\nby industries,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\n[FireEye has also released a report today with TTPs that can be used to learn more about](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html)\nUNC1878 attack methods.\n\nCarmakal told BleepingComputer that these attack methods are constantly changing, so the\nlisted IOCs and TTPs would likely change in new attacks.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Healthcare](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/healthcare/)\n[Hospital](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hospital/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ryuk/)\n[UNC1878](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/unc1878/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
