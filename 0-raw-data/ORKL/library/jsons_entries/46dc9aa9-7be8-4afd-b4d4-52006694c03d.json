We continue to monitor this active attack and intend to post additional details as they become available.\nIn this blog, we highlight four tools representing a unique infection chain utilized by NOBELIUM: EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone,\nand VaporRage. These tools have been observed being used in the wild as early as February 2021 attempting to gain a foothold on a\nvariety of sensitive diplomatic and government entities.\n\nAs part of this blog, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) is releasing an appendix of indicators of compromise (IOCs) for the\ncommunity to better investigate and understand NOBELIUM’s most recent operations. The NOBELIUM IOCs associated with this\n[activity are available in CSV on the MSTIC GitHub. This sophisticated NOBELIUM attack requires a comprehensive incident response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mstic/master/Indicators/May21-NOBELIUM/May21NOBELIUMIoCs.csv)\n[to identify, investigate, and respond. Get the latest information and guidance from Microsoft at https://aka.ms/nobelium. We have also](https://aka.ms/nobelium)\noutlined related alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender, so that security teams can check to see if activity has been flagged for investigation.\n\nEach of the NOBELIUM tools discussed in this blog is designed for flexibility, enabling the actor to adapt to operational challenges over\ntime. While its technical specifics are not unprecedented, NOBELIUM’s operational security priorities have likely influenced the design\nof this toolset, which demonstrate preferable features for an actor operating in potentially high-risk and high-visibility environments.\nThese attacker security priorities are:\n\n**Use of trusted channels: BoomBox is a uniquely developed downloader used to obtain a later-stage payload from an actor-**\ncontrolled Dropbox account. All initial communications leverage the Dropbox API via HTTPS.\n**Opportunity for restraint: Consistent with other tools utilized by NOBELIUM, BoomBox, VaporRage, and some variants of**\nNativeZone conduct some level of profiling on an affected system’s environment. MSTIC is currently unaware if these tools benefit\nfrom any server-side component. It is plausible that this design may allow NOBELIUM to selectively choose its targets and gain a\nlevel of understanding of potential discovery should the implant be run in environments unfamiliar to the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ambiguity: VaporRage is a unique shellcode loader seen as the third-stage payload. VaporRage can download, decode, and**\nexecute an arbitrary payload fully in-memory. Such design and deployment patterns, which also include staging of payloads on a\ncompromised website, hamper traditional artifacts and forensic investigations, allowing for unique payloads to remain\nundiscovered.\n\nNOBELIUM is an actor that operates with rapid operational tempo, often leveraging temporary infrastructure, payloads, and methods to\nobfuscate their activities. We suspect that NOBELIUM can draw from significant operational resources that are often showcased in their\nperiodic campaigns. Since December, the security community has identified a growing collection of payloads attributed to the actor,\n[including the GoldMax, GoldFinder, and Sibot malware identified by Microsoft, as well as TEARDROP (FireEye), SUNSPOT](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\n[(CrowdStrike), Raindrop (Symantec) and, most recently, FLIPFLOP (Volexity).](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/)\n\nDespite growing community visibility since the exposure of the SolarWinds attack in late 2020, NOBELIUM has continued to target\ngovernment and diplomatic entities across the globe. We anticipate that as these operations progress, NOBELIUM will continue to\nmature their tools and tactics to target a global audience.\n\nWhile this post focuses on a single wave of the campaign comprised of the mentioned four malware families, it also highlights variations\nin the campaign wherein methodologies were altered per wave. The list of indicators in the appendix expands beyond this single wave.\n\n## EnvyScout: NV.html (malicious HTML file)\n\n_NV.html, tracked by Microsoft as EnvyScout, can be best described as a malicious dropper capable of de-obfuscating and writing a_\nmalicious ISO file to disk. EnvyScout is chiefly delivered to targets of NOBELIUM by way of an attachment to spear-phishing emails.\n\nThe HTML <body> section of NV.html contains four notable components:\n\n**Component #1: Tracking and credential-harvesting URLs**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn one variant of EnvyScout, the <body> section contains two URLs, as shown above.\n\nThe first, prefixed with a file:// protocol handler, is indicative of an attempt to coax the operating system to send sensitive NTLMv2\nmaterial to the specified actor-controlled IP address over port 445. It is likely that the attacker is running a credential capturing service,\nsuch as Responder, at the other end of these transactions. Later, brute-forcing of these credentials may result in their exposure.\n\nThe second URL, which resolves to the same IP address as the former at the time of analysis, remotely sources an image that is part of\nthe HTML lure. This technique, sometimes referred to as a “web bug”, serves as a read receipt of sorts to NOBELIUM, validating that the\nprospective target followed through with opening the malicious attachment.\n\n**Component #2: FileSaver JavaScript helper code**\n\n[The second portion of EnvyScout is a modified version of the open-source tool FileSaver, which is intended to assist in the writing of](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)\nfiles to disk via JavaScript. The code is borrowed directly from the publicly available variants with minor alterations, including\nwhitespace removal, conversion of hex parameters to decimal, and renamed variables. By combining this code with components #3 and\n[#4 detailed below, NOBELIUM effectively implements a methodology known as HTML smuggling. This methodology may circumvent](https://outflank.nl/blog/2018/08/14/html-smuggling-explained/)\nstatic analysis of known malicious file types by obscuring them within dynamically altered content upon execution. When combined\nwith dynamic analysis guardrails, this can be an effective way to subvert detections of both types.\n\n**Component #3: Obfuscated ISO file**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third section of EnvyScout contains a payload stored as an encoded blob. This payload is decoded by XOR’ng each character with a\nsingle-byte key, which then leads to a Base64 payload that is then decoded and written to disk via components #2 and #4.\n\n**Component #4: De-obfuscator and dropper script**\n\nThe final component of EnvyScout is a short code snippet responsible for decoding the ISO in the Base64 encoded/XOR’d blob, and\nsaving it to disk as NV.img with a mime type of “application/octet-stream”. At this stage of infection, the user is expected to open the\ndownloaded ISO, NV.img, by double clicking it.\n\nAs Microsoft has been tracking waves of this campaign for months, we have identified various modifications to the actor’s toolkit that\nwere not present in every instance of EnvyScount but are nonetheless notable for defenders:\n\n**EnvyScout variation #1:**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some iterations of the actor’s phishing campaigns, EnvyScout contained execution guardrails wherein window.location.pathname\nwas called, and its values were leveraged to ensure that the first two entries in the array of characters returned were “C” and “:”. If this\ncondition was not met—indicating the sample was not being executed from the C: drive—the embedded ISO was not written to disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the attacker had gathered qualities from detonations of previous entries in the campaign via the Firebase fingerprinting JavaScript\n[detailed in a prior blog post, this was assessed to be an execution guardrail to deter analysis and dynamic execution of the samples](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\nbearing these guardrails. Having witnessed both iterations of EnvyScout in the wild allows us to infer the intent of some of the\ninformation gathered from earlier instances.\n\n**EnvyScout variation #2:**\n\nIn at least one instance of EnvyScout delivery, we observed further enumeration of the executing browser’s environment, wherein the\nuser-agent was used to determine whether a Windows machine received an ISO payload. If the visitor arrived via iOS, they were\nredirected to external infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### NV.img (malicious ISO file)\n\nWhen a target user opens NV.img (dropped by EnvyScout) by double-clicking it, the default behavior on Windows 10 is to mount the\nISO image at the next available drive letter. Windows Explorer subsequently displays the contents of the mounted ISO in a window,\nsimilar to what users see when they open folders or compressed archives.\n\nAs shown above, the mounted ISO contains a single visible file, a shortcut file named NV. However, adjusting the file and folder settings\nin Windows to show hidden files and folders exposes a hidden folder named NV and a hidden executable named BOOM.exe:\n\nThe user is likely expected to interact with NV.lnk, but manual execution of the hidden file BOOM.exe also results in the infection of the\nsystem. The individual contents of each file are detailed below.\n\nThe use of ISO as a vessel for malicious payloads is further notable due to the lack of mark of the web propagation on the contents,\nwhich may impact both host-based detections and reduce friction to user interaction with the contents\n\n\n-----\n\n### NV.pdf (decoy document)\n\nThe hidden NV directory in the mounted ISO contains a decoy PDF file named NV.pdf which contains a decoy advisory:\n\nAs described later in this analysis, the contents of the NV directory are displayed to the user by BOOM.exe.\n\n### NV.lnk (malicious shortcut)\n\n_NV.lnk is a shortcut/launcher for the hidden file BOOM.exe. As shown below, the shortcut leverages a living-off-the-land binary_\n(LOLBin) and technique to proxy the execution of BOOM.exe using the following hardcoded shortcut target value:\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe c:\\windows\\system32\\advpack.dll,RegisterOCX BOOM.exe._\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that Microsoft also saw a variation of this LNK file containing the following shortcut target value: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\n_/c start BOOM.exe._\n\n\n-----\n\nNumerous other LNKs were identified and are referenced in the appendix linked in this post. Methodologies varied, as did metadata in\nthe LNKs themselves. For instance, the sample with the SHA-256:\n48b5fb3fa3ea67c2bc0086c41ec755c39d748a7100d71b81f618e82bf1c479f0 contained a target of “%windir%/system32/explorer.exe\n_Documents.dll,Open”, while the absolute path in the sample was “C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe”._\n\n[As referenced in Volexity’s blog post on the latest campaign, the LNK metadata was widely removed, and what remained varied between](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/)\nwaves. Icons were often folders, meant to trick targets into thinking they were opening a shortcut to a folder.\n\nMicrosoft also observed the following targets for known LNK files:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe IMGMountingService.dll MountImgHelper_\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe diassvcs.dll InitializeComponent_\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe MsDiskMountService.dll DiskDriveIni_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe data/mstu.dll,MicrosoftUpdateService_\n\n## BoomBox: BOOM.exe (malicious downloader)\n\n_BOOM.exe, tracked by Microsoft as “BoomBox”, can be best described as a malicious downloader. The downloader is responsible for_\ndownloading and executing the next-stage components of the infection. These components are downloaded from Dropbox (using a\nhardcoded Dropbox Bearer/Access token).\n\nWhen executed, BoomBox ensures that a directory named NV is present in its current working directory; otherwise it terminates. If the\ndirectory is present, BoomBox displays the contents of the NV directory in a new Windows Explorer window (leaving it up to the user to\nopen the PDF file).\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, BoomBox ensures that the following file is not present on the system (if so, it terminates):\n_%AppData%\\Microsoft\\NativeCache\\NativeCacheSvc.dll (this file is covered later in this analysis). BoomBox performs enumeration of_\nvarious victim host qualities, such as hostname, domain name, IP address, and username of the victim system to compile the following\nstring (using example values):\n\nNext, BoomBox AES-encrypts the host information string above using the hardcoded encryption key\n“123do3y4r378o5t34onf7t3o573tfo73” and initialization vector (IV) value “1233t04p7jn3n4rg”. To masquerade the data as contents of a\nPDF file, BoomBox prepends and appends the magic markers for PDF to the AES-encrypted host information string above:\n\n\n-----\n\nBoomBox proceeds to upload the data above (masquerading as a PDF file) to a dedicated-per-victim-system folder in Dropbox. For\ndemonstration purposes, an example HTTP(s) POST request used to upload the file/data to Dropbox is included below.\n\nTo ensure the file has been successfully uploaded to Dropbox, BoomBox utilizes a set of regular expression values to check the HTTP\nresponse from Dropbox. As shown below, the regular expressions are used to check the presence of the is_downloadable, path_lower,\n_content_hash, and size fields (not their values) in the HTTP response received from Dropbox. Notably, BoomBox disregards the_\noutcome of this check and proceeds, even if the upload operation is unsuccessful.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, BoomBox downloads an encrypted file from Dropbox. For demonstration purposes, an example HTTP(s) POST request used to\ndownload the encrypted file from Dropbox is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter successfully downloading the encrypted file from Dropbox, BoomBox discards the first 10 bytes from the header and 7 bytes from\nthe footer of the encrypted file, and then AES-decrypts the rest of the file using the hardcoded encryption key\n“123do3y4r378o5t34onf7t3o573tfo73” and IV value “1233t04p7jn3n4rg”. BoomBox writes the decrypted file to the file system at\n_%AppData%\\Microsoft\\NativeCache\\NativeCacheSvc.dll. It then establishes persistence for NativeCacheSvc.dll by creating a Run_\nregistry value named MicroNativeCacheSvc:\n\n_HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\MicroNativeCacheSvc_\n\nThe Run registry value is populated with the following command, which is used to execute NativeCacheSvc.dll using rundll32.exe and\nby calling its export function named “_configNativeCache”:\n\n_rundll32.exe %AppData%\\Microsoft\\NativeCache\\NativeCacheSvc.dll _configNativeCache_\n\nNext, BoomBox downloads a second encrypted file from the Dropbox path /tmp/readme.pdf, discards the first 10 bytes from the header\nand 7 bytes from the footer of the encrypted file, and then AES-decrypts the rest of the file (using the same AES IV and key as above). It\nwrites the decrypted file at %AppData%\\SystemCertificates\\CertPKIProvider.dll and proceeds to execute the previously dropped file\n_NativeCacheSvc.dll using the same rundll32.exe command as above._\n\nAs the final reconnaissance step, if the system is domain-joined, BoomBox executes an LDAP query to gather data such as distinguished\nname, SAM account name, email, and display name of all domain users via the filter (&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person)).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe enumerated data is AES-encrypted (using the same IV and key as before), encapsulated in a fake PDF file (as previously described),\nand uploaded to the Dropbox path /new/<Victim_ID>, where <Victim_ID> is the MD5 hash of the victim’s system name, for example:\n_/new/432B65EF29F84E6043A80C15EBA12FD2._\n\n## NativeZone: NativeCacheSvc.dll (malicious loader)\n\n\n-----\n\n_NativeCacheSvc.dll, tracked by Microsoft as “NativeZone” can best be described as a malicious loader responsible for utilizing_\n_rundll32.exe to load the malicious downloader component CertPKIProvider.dll._\n\nThe malicious functionality of NativeCacheSvc.dll is located inside a DLL export named configNativeCache.\n\nAs shown above, the export function executes rundll32.exe to load %AppData%\\SystemCertificates\\Lib\\CertPKIProvider.dll by calling\nits export function named eglGetConfigs.\n\n## VaporRage: CertPKIProvider.dll (malicious downloader)\n\n_CertPKIProvider.dll, tracked by Microsoft as “VaporRage” can best be described as a shellcode downloader. This version of VaporRage_\ncontains 11 export functions including eglGetConfigs, which houses the malicious functionality of the DLL.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, NativeZone utilizes rundll32.exe to execute the eglGetConfigs export function of\n_CertPKIProvider.dll. Upon execution, the export function first ensures the NativeZone DLL_\n_%AppData%\\Microsoft\\NativeCache\\NativeCacheSvc.dll is present on the system (else it terminates). Next, the export function issues_\nan HTTP(s) GET request to a legitimate but compromised WordPress site holescontracting[.]com. The GET request is comprised of the\ndynamically generated and hardcoded values, for example:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe purpose of the GET request is to first register the system as compromised and then to download an XOR-encoded shellcode blob\nfrom the WordPress site (only if the system is of interest to the actor). Once successfully downloaded, the export function XOR decodes\nthe shellcode blob (using a hardcoded multi-byte XOR key “346hrfyfsvvu235632542834”).\n\nIt then proceeds to execute the decoded shellcode in memory by jumping to the beginning of the shellcode blob in an executable\nmemory region. The download-decode-execute process is repeated indefinitely, approximately every hour, until the DLL is unloaded\nfrom memory. VaporRage can execute any compatible shellcode provided by its C2 server, including a Cobalt Strike stage shellcode.\n\n**Additional Custom Cobalt Strike loader from NOBELIUM**\n\n[As described in a previous blog, NOBELIUM has used multiple custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders (likely generated using custom](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/20/deep-dive-into-the-solorigate-second-stage-activation-from-sunburst-to-teardrop-and-raindrop/)\nArtifact Kit templates) to enable their malicious activities. These include TEARDROP, Raindrop, and other custom loaders.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince our last publication, we have identified additional variants of NOBELIUM’s custom Cobalt Strike loaders. Instead of assigning a\nname to each short-lived and disposable variant, Microsoft will be tracking NOBELIUM’s custom Cobalt Strike loaders and downloaders\nfor the loaders under the name NativeZone. As seen in previous custom NOBELIUM Cobalt Strike loaders, the new loader DLLs also\ncontain decoy export names and function, as well as code and strings borrowed from legitimate applications.\n\nThe new NativeZone loaders can be grouped into two variants:\n\nVariant #1: These loaders embed an encoded/encrypted Cobalt Strike Beacon stage shellcode\nVariant #2: These loaders load an encoded/encrypted Cobalt Strike Beacon stage shellcode from another accompanying file (e.g.,\nan RTF file).\n\nIn the succeeding sections, we discuss some of the new NativeZone Cobalt Strike Beacon variants we have observed in our investigation.\n\n**NativeZone variant #1**\n\nSimilar to the previous NOBELIUM custom Cobalt Strike loaders, such as TEARDROP and Raindrop, these NativeZone loaders are\nresponsible for decoding/decrypting an embedded Cobalt Strike Beacon stage shellcode and executing it in memory. Some of the\nNativeZone loaders feature anti-analysis guardrails to thwart analysis of the samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn these versions of NativeZone, the actor has used a variety of encoding and encryption methodologies to obfuscate the embedded\nshellcode. For example, in the example below, the NativeZone variant uses a simple byte-swap decoding algorithm to decode the\nembedded shellcode:\n\nAnother sample featuring a different decoding methodology to decode the embedded shellcode is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother sample, featuring a de-obfuscation methodology leveraging AES encryption algorithm to decrypt the embedded shellcode, is\nshown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nYet another NativeZone sample leveraging AES for decrypting an embedded Cobalt Strike shellcode blob is shown below (note the\nsyntax differences compared to the sample above):\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAnother sample featuring a different decoding methodology along with leveraging CreateThreadpoolWait() to execute the decoded\nshellcode blob is below:\n\nBelow is an example of anti-analysis technique showing the loader checking if the victim system is a Vmware or VirtualBox VM:\n\n\n-----\n\n**NativeZone variant #2**\n\nUnlike variant #1, the NativeZone variant #2 samples do not contain the encoded/encrypted Cobalt Strike Beacon stage shellcode.\nInstead, these samples read the shellcode from an accompanying file that is shipped with the sample. For example, one NativeZone\nvariant #2 sample was observed alongside an RTF file. The RTF file doubles as both a decoy document and a shellcode carrier file. The\nRTF file contains the proper RTF file structure and data followed by an encoded shellcode blob (starting at offset 0x658):\n\nWhen the NativeZone DLL is loaded/executed, it first displays the RTF document to the user.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned above, the same RTF also contains the encoded Cobalt Strike stage shellcode. As shown below, the NativeZone DLL\nproceeds to extract the shellcode from the RTF file (starting at file offset 0x658 as shown above), decode the shellcode and execute it on\nthe victim system:\n\n**Notes on new and old NOBELIUM PDB paths**\n\nThe following example PDB paths were observed in the samples analyzed in this blog:\n\n\n-----\n\nBoomBox: C:\\Users\\dev10vs\\Desktop\\Prog\\Obj\\BOOM\\BOOM\\BOOM\\obj\\Release\\BOOM.pdb\nNativeZone: c:\\users\\devuser\\documents\\visual studio 2013\\Projects\\DLL_stageless\\Release\\DLL_stageless.pdb\nNativeZone: C:\\Users\\DevUser\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\DLL_stageless\\Release\\DLL_stageless.pdb\nNativeZone: C:\\Users\\dev\\Desktop\\나타나게하다\\Dll6\\x64\\Release\\Dll6.pdb\n\nNote the presence of ‘dev’ user in the PDB paths above.
