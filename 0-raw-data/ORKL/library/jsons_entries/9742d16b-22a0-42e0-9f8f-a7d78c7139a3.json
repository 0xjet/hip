Our current focus is on more recent and upcoming\nactivity from this APT, which brings an interesting mix of old code, new code, and new\nspeculations as to where they will strike next and what they will shed.\n\n\n-----\n\nMuch of our 2018 research focused on Turla’s [KopiLuwak javascript backdoor, new variants](https://securelist.com/kopiluwak-a-new-javascript-payload-from-turla/77429/)\nof the Carbon framework and meterpreter delivery techniques. Also interesting was\nMosquito’s changing delivery techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell\nuse, and borrowed injector code. We tied some of this activity together with infrastructure\nand data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018.\n\nFor a first, our KopiLuwak research identified targets and delivery techniques, bringing more\naccuracy and reliability to the discussion. Also interesting is a review of Turla scripting\nartefacts leading to newer efforts like KopiLuwak, tracing from older scripting in development\nefforts in WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear. And, we find 2018 KopiLuwak delivery techniques that\nunexpectedly matched Zebrocy spearphishing techniques for a first time as well.\n\nAlso highly interesting and unusual was the MiTM techniques delivering Mosquito backdoors.\nIn all likelihood, Turla delivered a physical presence of some sort within Wifi range of targets.\nDownload sessions with Adobe’s website were intercepted and injected to deliver Mosquito\ntrojanized installers. This sort of hypothesis is supported by Mosquito installers’ consistent\n\n\n-----\n\nwifi credential theft. Meanwhile, injection and delivery techniques are undergoing changes in\n2018 with reflective loaders and code enhancements. We expect to see more Mosquito\nactivity into 2019.\n\nAnd finally, we discuss the Carbon framework, tying together the older, elegant, and\nfunctional codebase sometimes called “Snake lite” with ongoing efforts to selectively monitor\nhigh value targets. It appears that the backdoor is pushed with meterpreter now. And, as we\nsee code modifications and deployment in 2018, we predict more development work on this\nmatured codebase along with selective deployment to continue into 2019.\n\nEssentially, we are discussing ongoing activity revolving around several malware families:\n\nKopiLuwak and IcedCoffeer\nCarbon\nMosquito\nWhiteBear\n\n## Technical Rattle\n\n### Turla’s Shifting to Scripting\n\n**KopiLuwak and IcedCoffee, WhiteBear, and WhiteAtlas**\n\nSince at least 2015 Turla has leveraged Javascript, powershell, and wsh in a number of\nways, including in their malware dropper/installation operations as well as for implementing\ncomplete backdoors. The White Atlas framework often utilized a small Javascript script to\nexecute the malware dropper payload after it was decrypted by the VBA macro code, then to\ndelete the dropper afterwards. A much more advanced and highly obfuscated Javascript\nscript was utilized in White Atlas samples that dropped a Firefox extension backdoor\ndeveloped by Turla, but again the script was responsible for the simple tasks of writing out\nthe extension.json configuration file for the extension and deleting itself for cleanup\npurposes.\n\n**IcedCoffee**\n\nTurla’s first foray into full-fledged Javascript backdoors began with the usage of the\nIcedCoffee backdoor that we reported on in our private June 2016 “Ice Turla” report\n(available to customers of Kaspersky APT Intelligence Services), which led later to their\nmore fully functional and complex, recently deployed, KopiLuwak backdoor. IcedCoffee was\ninitially dropped by exploit-laden RTF documents, then later by macro-enabled Office\ndocuments. The macro code used to drop IcedCoffee was a slightly modified version of that\nfound in White Atlas, which is consistent with the code sharing present in many Turla tools. A\n\n\n-----\n\nnoteworthy change to the macro code was the addition of a simple web beacon that relayed\nbasic information to Turla controlled servers upon execution of the macro, which not only\nhelped profile the victim but also could be used to track the effectiveness of the attack.\n\nIcedCoffee is a fairly basic backdoor which uses WMI to collect a variety of system and user\ninformation from the system, which is then encoded with base64, encrypted with RC4 and\nsubmitted via HTTP POST to the C2 server. IcedCoffee has no built-in command capability,\ninstead it may receive javascript files from the C2 server, which are deobfuscated and\nexecuted in memory, leaving nothing behind on disk for forensic analysis. IcedCoffee was not\nwidely deployed, rather it was targeted at diplomats, including Ambassadors, of European\ngovernments.\n\n**KopiLuwak**\n\nIn November 2016, Kaspersky Lab observed a new round of weaponized macro documents\nthat dropped a new, heavily obfuscated Javascript payload that we named KopiLuwak (one\nof the rarest and most expensive types of coffee in the world). The targeting for this new\nmalware was consistent with earlier Turla operations, focusing on European governments,\nbut it was even more selectively deployed than IcedCoffee.\n\nThe KopiLuwak script is decoded by macro code very similar to that previously seen with\nIcedCoffee, but the resulting script is not the final step. This script is executed with a\nparameter used as a key to RC4 decrypt an additional layer of javascript that contains the\nsystem information collection and command and control beaconing functionality. KopiLuwak\nperforms a more comprehensive system and network reconnaissance collection, and like\nIcedCoffee leaves very little on disk for investigators to discover other than the base script.\n\nUnlike IcedCoffee, KopiLuwak contains a basic set of command functionality, including the\nability to run arbitrary system commands and uninstall itself. In mid-2017 a new version was\ndiscovered in which this command set had been further enhanced to include file download\nand data exfiltration capabilities.\n\nThe most recent evolution in the KopiLuwak life cycle was observed in mid-2018 when we\nobserved a very small set of systems in Syria and Afghanistan being targeted with a new\ndelivery vector. In this campaign the KopiLuwak backdoor was encoded and delivered in a\n\nWindows shortcut (.lnk) file. The lnk files were an especially interesting development\nbecause the powershell code they contain for decoding and dropping the payload is nearly\nidentical to that utilized by the Zebrocy threat actor a month earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Carbon – the long tail**\n\nCarbon continues to be deployed against government and foreign affairs related\norganizations in Central Asia. Carbon targeting in this region has shifted across a few\ncountries since 2014. Here, we find a new orchestrator v3.8.2 and a new injected transport\nlibrary v4.0.8 deployed to multiple systems. And while we cannot identify a concrete delivery\nevent for the dropper, its appearance coincides with the presence of meterpreter. This\nmeterpreter reliance also coincides with wider Turla use of open source tools that we\ndocumented towards the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018.\n\nThe Epic Turla operation reported in 2014 involved highly selective Carbon delivery and was\na long term global operation that affected hundreds of victims. Only a small portion of these\nsystems were upgraded to a malware set known as “the Carbon framework”, and even fewer\nreceived the Snake rootkit for “extreme persistence”. So, Carbon is known to be a\n\n\n-----\n\nsophisticated codebase with a long history and very selective delivery, and coincides with\nSnake rootkit development and deployment. In light of its age, it’s interesting that this\ncodebase is currently being modified, with additional variants deployed to targets in 2018.\n\nWe expect Carbon framework code modifications and predict selective deployment of this\nmatured codebase to continue into 2019 within Central Asia and related remote locations. A\ncomplex module like this one must require some effort and investment, and while\ncorresponding loader/injector and lateral movement malware moves to open source, this\nbackdoor package and its infrastructure is likely not going to be replaced altogether in the\nshort term.\n\n## .JS attachments deliver Skipper/WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear\n\nWe introduced WhiteBear actionable data to our private customers early 2017, and similar\nanalysis to that report was publicly shared eight months later. Again, it was a cluster of\nactivity that continued to grow past expectations. It is interesting because WhiteBear shared\nknown compromised infrastructure with KopiLuwak: soligro[.]com. WhiteBear scripted\nspearphish attachments also follows up on initial WhiteAtlas scripting development and\ndeployment efforts.\n\n## Mosquito’s Changing 2018 Delivery Techniques\n\nIn March 2018, our private report customers received actionable data on Mosquito’s\ninclusion of fileless and customized Posh-SecMod metasploit components. When discussion\nof the group’s metasploit use was made public, their tactics began to change.\n\nThe “DllForUserFileLessInstaller” injector module maintained a compilation date of\nNovember 22, 2017, and was starting to be used by Mosquito to inject ComRAT modules\ninto memory around January 2018. It is a small piece of metasploit injector code that\naccounts for issues with Wow64. Also, related open source powershell registry loader code\noddly was modified to avoid AES use, and opt for 3DES encryption instead. Here is the\nmodified Mosquito code:\n\nAnd here is the default Posh-SecMod code that they ripped from:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe expect to see more open-source based or inspired fileless components and memory\nloaders from Mosquito throughout 2018. Perhaps this malware enhancement indicates that\nthey are more interested in maintaining current access to victim organizations than\ndeveloping offensive technologies.\n\n## MiTM and Ducking the Mosquito Net\n\nWe delivered actionable data on Mosquito to our private intel customers in early 2017. Our\ninitial findings included data around an unusual and legitimate download URL for trojanized\ninstallers:\n\n```\nhxxp://admdownload.adobe[.]com/bin/live/flashplayer23ax_ra_install.exe\n\n```\n\nWhile we could not identify the MiTM techniques with accuracy at the time, it is possible\neither WiFi MiTM or router compromise was used in relation to these incidents. It is unlikely,\nbut possible, that ISP-level FinFisher MiTM was used, considering multiple remote locations\nacross the globe were targeted.\n\nBut there is more incident data that should be elaborated on. In some cases, two “.js” files\nwere written to disk and the infected system configured to run them at startup. Their naming\nprovides insight into the intention of this functionality, which is to keep the malware remotely\nupdated via google application, and maintain local settings updates by loading and running\n“1.txt” at every startup. In a way, this staged script loading technique seems to be shared\nwith the IcedCoffee javascript loading techniques observed in past Turla incidents focused\non European government organizations. Updates are provided from the server-side, leading\nto fewer malware set findings.\n\ngoogle_update_checker.js\nlocal_update_checker.js\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, we should consider the wifi data collection that Mosquito Turla performed during these\nupdates, as it hasn’t been documented publicly. One of the first steps that several Mosquito\ninstaller packages performed after writing and running this local_update js file was to export\nall local host’s WiFi profiles (settings and passwords) to %APPDATA%\\<profile>.xml with a\ncommand line call:\n\n```\ncmd.exe /c netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder=\"%APPDATA%\"\n\n```\n\nThey then gather more network information with a call to ipconfig and arp -a. Maintaining\nongoing host-based collection of wifi credentials for target networks makes it far easier to\npossess ongoing access to wifi networks for spoofing and MiTM, as brute-forcing or\notherwise cracking weakly secured WiFi networks becomes unnecessary. Perhaps this\nparticular method of location-dependent intrusion and access is on the decline for Mosquito\nTurla, as we haven’t identified new URLs delivering trojanized code.\n\n## The Next Strike\n\nIt’s very interesting to see ongoing targeting overlap, or the lack of overlap, with other APT\nactivity. Noting that Turla was absent from the milestone DNC hack event where Sofacy and\nCozyDuke were both present, but Turla was quietly active around the globe on other\nprojects, provides some insight as to ongoing motivations and ambitions of this group. It is\ninteresting that data related to these organizations has not been weaponized and found\nonline while this Turla activity quietly carries on.\n\nBoth Turla’s Mosquito and Carbon projects focus mainly on diplomatic and foreign affairs\ntargets. While WhiteAtlas and WhiteBear activity stretched across the globe to include\nforeign affairs related organizations, not all targeting consistently followed this profile.\nScientific and technical centers were also targeted, and organizations outside of the political\narena came under focus as well. Turla’s KopiLuwak activity does not necessarily focus on\ndiplomatic/foreign affairs, and also winds down a different path. Instead, 2018 activity\ntargeted government related scientific and energy research organizations, and a government\nrelated communications organization in Afghanistan. This highly selective but wider targeting\nset most likely will continue into 2019.\n\nFrom the targeting perspective, we see closer ties between the KopiLuwak and WhiteBear\nactivity, and closer alignments between Mosquito and Carbon activity.\n\nAnd WhiteBear and KopiLuwak shared infrastructure while deploying unusual .js scripting.\nPerhaps open source offensive malware will become much more present in Mosquito and\nCarbon attacks as we see more meterpreter and injector code, and more uniquely innovative\ncomplex malware will continue to be distributed with KopiLuwak and a possible return of\nWhiteBear. And as we see with borrowed techniques from the previous zebrocy\nspearphishing, techniques are sometimes passed around and duplicated.\n\n\n-----\n\n[KopiLuwak: A New JavaScript Payload from Turla](https://securelist.com/kopiluwak-a-new-javascript-payload-from-turla/77429/)\n[Introducing WhiteBear](https://securelist.com/introducing-whitebear/81638/)\n[Gazing at Gazer [pdf]](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer.pdf)\n[APT Trends report Q2 2017](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332/)\n[Diplomats in Eastern Europe bitten by a Turla mosquito [pdf]](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\n[The Epic Turla Operation](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/)\n[Peering into Turla’s second stage backdoor](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[JavaScript](https://securelist.com/tag/javascript/)\n[Macros](https://securelist.com/tag/macros/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[MITM](https://securelist.com/tag/mitm/)\n[Rootkits](https://securelist.com/tag/rootkits/)\n[Turla](https://securelist.com/tag/turla/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nShedding Skin – Turla’s Fresh Faces\n\nYour email address will not be published.
