VOLTZITE\nemploys living off the land (LOTL) techniques;\nthey use native tools available in compromised\nassets. This strategy, paired with slow and steady\nreconnaissance, enables VOLTZITE to avoid\ndetection for lengthy periods of time.\n\n\nI N T E L L I G E N C E B R I E F\n\n# VOLTZITE Espionage Operations Targeting U.S. Critical Systems\n\n\n###### Key Findings\n\n- Targeting the electric sector, satellite,\ntelecommunications, emergency management, and\ndefense industrial bases.\n\n- Targeting networks in the United States and Africa.\n\n- Conducts slow and steady reconnaissance against a\ntarget.\n\n- Employs mostly living off the land (LOTL) techniques and\nexhibits a high level of operational security practices.\n\n- Deploys various web shells and FRP, a fast reverse proxy\ntool, for command and control (C2) communications\n\n- C2 traffic frequently talks back to compromised SOHO\n\n(Small Office and Home Office) networking equipment\nor adversary leased VPS (Virtual Private Server)\ninfrastructure.\n\n- Uses open-source tooling and web shells.\n\n- Leverages credential theft to facilitate lateral movement.\n\n- Overlaps with multiple threat groups: Volt Typhoon\n(Microsoft), BRONZE SILHOUETTE (Secureworks),\nVanguard Panda (Crowdstrike), and UNC3236 (Mandiant).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Overview of VOLTZITE\n\nVOLTZITE is a threat group that targets the electric sector and other industrial sectors in the United\nStates and other parts of the world. VOLTZITE conducts offensive operations with a significant\nfocus on detection evasion and sophisticated operational security tradecraft. VOLTZITE frequently\n\n## Vz\n\nutilizes living off the land (LOTL) techniques and often tunnels command and control traffic through\ncompromised SOHO routers. VOLTZITE’s assessed intent is data exfiltration and long-term espionage.\n\nVOLTZITE has overlaps with Volt Typhoon (Microsoft), BRONZE SILHOUETTE (Secureworks), Vanguard Panda\n(Crowdstrike), and UNC3236 (Mandiant).\n\nThese groups have tracked activity clusters dating as far back as 2021. Dragos makes the assessment of overlap to these\ngroups based on the premise of strong correlating evidence on the victimology, infrastructure, and capabilities vertices\nof the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis.\n\n#### Activity Timeline\n\nDragos has observed VOLTZITE since early 2023, but they are assessed with low confidence to have been active as\nfar back as 2021, and have potential overlaps with KOSTOVITE, another Dragos-tracked threat group. The following\nprovides a high-level timeline of VOLTZITE-related incidents tracked by Dragos.\n\n\n##### 2023\n\n**EARLY**\n\nit-----@\n\n**JUN**\n\n**JUL**\n\n**NOV**\n\n**DEC**\n\nit-----@\n\n##### 2024\n\n### I\n\n\nUS Territory of Guam compromise.\n\n**VOLTZITE infiltrates United States emergency management organization.**\n\nDragos discovers VOLTZITE targeting African electric transmission and distribution providers.\n\nDragos collaborated with E-ISAC on analysis of VOLTZITE activity against multiple US-based\n\nelectric sector organizations.\n\nDragos discovered evidence that VOLTZITE has overlaps with UTA0178, a threat activity cluster tracked\n\nby Volexity, exploiting Ivanti ICS VPN zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nExtensive reconnaissance of a US telecommunication’s providers external network gateways.\n\nEvidence of compromise against a large US city’s emergency services GIS network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Investigating VOLTZITE Compromise of a US Water & Electric Utility\n\nIn the early part of 2023, the VOLTZITE threat group compromised a U.S. water and\nelectric utility and exfiltrated sensitive information. This data encompassed details\non operational processes, configurations of operational technology (OT) assets,\ngeographic information system (GIS) data, SCADA system configurations, and lists\nof critical customers.\n\nThe utility took steps to bolster its cybersecurity posture in late 2023. It **Vz**\nimplemented the Dragos Platform to monitor and secure IT-OT network traffic at\nPurdue Model Levels 3-4 and OT-OT communications at Level 2. Additionally, the\nutility engaged OT Watch, a team of industrial threat hunters at Dragos, to identify\nand neutralize persistent threats.\n\nOT Watch confirmed VOLTZITE’s actions were in close proximity to the utility’s\nOT. Specifically, the Dragos Platform identified server message block (SMB) traversal maneuvers, and remote desktop\nprotocol (RDP) lateral movement, illustrating VOLTZITE’s strategy to navigate and pivot within the network to access\nOT data. The investigation found that VOLTZITE was focused on accessing and exfiltrating sensitive documents and\ndata that are pivotal to critical operations of the electric utility.\n\nDragos Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that the initial compromise, rapid data exfiltration, and\nproximity to the OT network, followed by VOLTZITE’s return to the network months later, highlights an intent to\nmaintain long-term persistence in networks of interest for follow-on actions in the future.\n\nThe employment of living off the land (LOTL) techniques and credential reuse by VOLTZITE, along with slow and\nsteady reconnaissance, enables the group to avoid detection. VOLTZITE activity is unlikely to be picked up by\ntraditional detection methods. This strategy allows VOLZITE to stretch out their dwell time within a network. Dragos\nrecommends monitoring cross-zone communications between IT and OT networks and utilizing behavioral detections\nengineered to identify the latest VOLTZITE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise\n(IOCs).\n\nIn response to these events, Dragos OT Watch launched subsequent hunts across the fleet of subscribed customers,\nand Dragos Intelligence analyzed Neighborhood Keeper participant data for indications of VOLTZITE behaviors and\nanonymously alerted impacted parties. Additional behavioral detections were developed based on new TTPs identified\nduring the investigation and were deployed to the Dragos Platform to ensure detection capabilities across the\ncustomer base.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Capabilities\n\nVOLTZITE compromises external network perimeter applications and assets such as SOHO routers and virtual private\nnetwork gateways to gain access to targeted organization’s networks. Once within the victim’s network, they leverage\nLOTL techniques and stolen credentials to move through the network.\n\nExamples of exploited applications:\n\n\n\n- Fortinet FortiGate\n\n- PRTG Network Monitor appliances\n\n\n\n- ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus\n\n- FatPipe WARP\n\n\n\n- Ivanti Connect Secure VPN\n\n- Cisco ASA\n\n\n#### Lateral Movement Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nVOLTZITE has exhibited differing techniques for credential access and lateral movement once inside a network.\nThe first observed technique is the use of csvde.exe, which is a native Windows binary used for importing and\nexporting data from Active Directory Domain Services using the comma-separated values (csv) file format.\nObfuscation techniques are also employed.\n\nThe second observed technique to steal credentials for lateral movement is using Volume Shadow Copies and the\nextraction of the NTDS.dit Active Directory database from a domain controller. Volume Shadow Copies are cloned\nimages of the operating system that can be used as backups or restoration points for an administrator to roll back\na Windows machine if any issues arise with the operating system later. The NTDS.dit database, which is stored\non domain controllers, is effectively the database underpinning all the information in Active Directory about user\naccounts, groups, computers, and most importantly, the hashes of user passwords. Under normal circumstances,\nthe NTDS.dit file cannot be opened or copied as it is in use by Active Directory on the machine. To circumvent this\nprotection, adversaries commonly use the Volume Shadow Copy Service to create a cloned image of the operating\nsystem and save it to a disk. Then the adversary can exfiltrate the copy of NTDS.dit residing in the shadow copy with\nno issues, as that file version is not in use by any processes. Once the NTDS.dit database is back on an adversary’s\nmachine, they can perform hash cracking or come back to the victim machine and use “pass the hash” techniques to\nauthenticate as a user.\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\nVOLTZITE uses very minimal tooling and prefers to conduct their operations with as little a footprint as possible,\nhence their favoritism for LOTL techniques. However, VOLTZITE has been observed using the FRP reverse proxy tool\nand multiple web shells.\n\nFRP is a proxy that allows you to expose a machine behind a firewall or network that maps multiple private IP\naddresses to a public address through Network Address Translation (NAT). FRP can be used to channel data directly to a\ncommand-and-control server and not follow the usual egress points out of a network.\n\n\n-----\n\nVOLTZITE has compiled FRP binaries and utilized them as a command-and-control mechanism through some of\ntheir attacks. VOLTZITE has primarily utilized web shells based off the Awen web shell. VOLTZITE web shells result in\nprimarily LOTL techniques to be used as follow-up actions. Once VOLTZITE infiltrates a network via an initial access\npoint and then deploys a web shell, the most common subsequent action is the adversary familiarizing themselves\nwith the environment they are in by running Windows native tools such as ‘whoami’ or ‘tasklist’.\n\nVOLTZITE has also exhibited heavy use of LOTL techniques. The Windows tools that VOLTZITE uses include but are not\nlimited to the following:\n\n\n\n- Certutil\n\n- dnscmd\n\n- Ldifde\n\n- Makecab\n\n\n\n- net user/group/use\n\n- netsh\n\n- nltest\n\n- ntdsutil\n\n\n\n- PowerShell\n\n- reg query/save\n\n- systeminfo\n\n- tasklist\n\n\n\n- wevtutil\n\n- wmic\n\n- xcopy\n\n\n#### Impact to Industrial Control Systems (ICS)\n\nTo date, Dragos has only observed VOLTZITE operations achieving Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain. They have\nnot yet displayed actions or capabilities designed to disrupt, degrade, or destroy ICS/OT assets or operations.\nHowever, their persistent targeting of critical infrastructure entities and observed capabilities could result in aiding\nthe development of an ICS-capable disruption tool.\n\nVOLTZITE has shown continued interest in the electric and telecommunications sectors in the United States. This\nis evidenced by long-term slow and steady reconnaissance and enumeration of multiple electric entities. If VOLTZITE\ncan establish an initial foothold on the network perimeter of a target, they may then be able to pivot further into a\nvictim’s information technology (IT) network. Once access is established, VOLTZITE conducts espionage activities\nvia LOTL techniques to attempt detection evasion. If proper network segmentation between the IT and operational\ntechnology (OT) networks of a victim is not apparent, then VOLTZITE may laterally move into OT networks to perform\n\nenumeration and data exfiltration of critical OT operational data such as SCADA data, OT device configurations,\nhistorian data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data, amongst others.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nConsidering the risk and related threats, Dragos recommends organizations implement the 5 Critical Controls for\nWorld-Class OT Cybersecurity identified by the SANS Institute - which presents a framework for implementing a\ncybersecurity program to defend against adversary activity directed against OT networks, be it IP (Intellectual Property)\ntheft, ransomware, or targeted cyber-physical effects.\n\nA first step in implementing these controls is achieving executive alignment on the role and importance of OT\ncybersecurity and the specific risks an OT cybersecurity program is meant to defend against, if not well understood.\nOne potential way to achieve organizational alignment is to tie the effort back to real-world scenarios. The information\ndetailed above clearly outlines the capabilities developed for the adversary and their intended impacts. This detail can\n\n\n-----\n\nbe instrumental in understanding how the capabilities might impact a given network, the potential operational and\nbusiness implications, and the steps necessary to defend against and remediate the potential effects.\n\nTranslating cyber risks into the impact on an organization’s operations and functions can help executive stakeholders\nengage on the topic of OT cybersecurity. Once an organization can achieve executive and board-level alignment on\nthe importance of investing in OT cybersecurity, the foundation is in place for the implementation of the five critical\ncontrols for OT cybersecurity which are shown below:\n\n**1. ICS Incident Response**\nOperations-informed incident response (IR) plan with focused system integrity and recovery\ncapabilities during an attack—exercises designed to reinforce risk scenarios and use cases tailored to\nthe ICS environment.\n\n**2. Defensible Architecture**\nArchitectures that support visibility, log collection, asset identification, segmentation, industrial DMZs\n(Demilitarized Zones), and process-communication enforcement.\n\n**3. ICS NETWORK VISIBILITY MONITORING**\nContinuous network security monitoring of the ICS environment with protocol-aware toolsets and\nsystem of systems interaction analysis capabilities used to inform operations of potential risks\nto control.\n\n**4. SECURE REMOTE ACCESS**\nIdentification and inventory of all remote access points and allowed destination environments,\non-demand access, and multi-factor authentication (MFA), where possible, jump host environments\nto provide control and monitor points within the secure segment.\n\n**5. RISK-BASED VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT**\nUnderstanding the cyber digital controls in place and device operating conditions that aid in risk-based\nvulnerability management decisions to patch for the vulnerability, mitigate the impact or monitor for\npossible exploitation\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nVOLTZITE poses a credible threat to critical infrastructure operators in the United States and jurisdictions within the\nthreat group’s strategic interest. VOLTZITE heavily focuses on detection evasion and long-term persistent access with\nthe assessed intent of long-term espionage and data exfiltration. Dragos recommends that industrial organizations\nfamiliarize themselves with all potential detection mechanisms for LOTL techniques, with a focus on anomaly and\nbehavior-driven threat detection strategies.\n\n\n**About Dragos, Inc.**\n\nDragos, Inc. has a global mission to safeguard civilization from those trying to\n\ndisrupt the industrial infrastructure we depend on every day.
