    "plain_text": "# Ukraine CyberWar Overview\n\n**inquest.net/blog/2022/04/07/ukraine-cyberwar-overview**\n\n## Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the current state of the war against Ukraine has been on everyone's mind for several\nweeks by now, InQuest Labs has been following activity on the cyber-front proceeding as\nwell as moves made by APTs following the invasion of Ukraine. While the rest of the world is\nseeing the effects of this escalation with rising fuel prices and supply line hiccups, Ukrainian\nand Russian citizens alike are clinging onto their livelihoods due to the contempt of Russian\nleaders. As many within the research community have ties to and/or may be personally\naffected by this crisis, we felt it was necessary to share any information based on communal\nefforts that may save lives and contribute to bringing this conflict to a peaceful resolution.\nOur endeavor with this blog is to document and expose campaigns/associated TTPs as well\nas provide periodic updates as the situation continues to develop and actors pivot to different\ntactics. It is imperative that the global effort to contain and reduce the impact of Russian\nstate sponsored threats on the cyber-front does not waver, as further advances could mean\ninnocent lives lost given the current circumstances. Our hope is that the information provided\nis able to bring those currently engaged in research efforts up to speed along with sparking\ninterest for able minds to join the ranks. True to the message that inspired the name\n[attributed one of the groups that will be covered, video here for the uninitiated (Warning:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L17Bi7zBJHI)\nLanguage), we are committed to aiding any efforts to stuff as many invading pockets with\nsunflower seeds as needed to end this senseless war.\n\nInitially, we published a blog on a delivery mechanism we dubbed GlowSpark, which can be\n[found here.](https://inquest.net/blog/2022/02/10/380-glowspark)\n\n[Next we decided to share an image via tweet that included a high level visual of the threat](https://twitter.com/InQuest/status/1499842926108680196)\nlandscape in an easily digestible format.\n\n\n-----\n\nTweeted March 4th, 2022\nAs the situation on the ground unfolded, so did developments on the cyber-front. The\n[following tweet was shared to showcase the expanding landscape. Comparing the two](https://twitter.com/InQuest/status/1504890441698795527)\ngraphics, we can see an uptick in threat actor activity targeting Ukraine. As seen in previous\nRussian movements and occupations of sovereign territory, physical movements tend to\nfollow major pushes on the cyber-front, highlighting the value of threat actor support during\nmilitary operations. Usually in the form of disrupting lines of communication and/or\ndestabilizing regional infrastructure to \"soften\" the target for ground forces.\n\n\n-----\n\nTweeted March 18th, 2022\nThis last graphic is a condensed, \"easy to swallow\", form containing actors and threats\nobserved up to the point of publication. (2022-04-12) Below we briefly touch on the major\nplayers and their roles in this conflict.\n\n\n-----\n\n## APT - SunFlowerSeed (NEARMISS/UNC-3715)\n\nThreat activity produced by this actor leading to the physical invasion of Ukraine was the\ncatalyst for focusing on Russian state sponsored/supporting threats and acted as a call to\narms for the research community.\n\nHermetic Wiper (FoxBlade/Trojan.KillDisk)\n\nDestructive malware with anti-forensic measures\nHermetic Wizard - A worm that containing wiper characteristics\nHermetic Ransom - Ransomware connected to PartyTicket and SonicVote\n\n## Ghostwriter/UNC-1151/TA445/UAC-0051 (Belarus MoD)\n\nThe current regime under Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko has close relations to\nVladimir Putin and his administration, allowing for Belarusian state assets to be (allegedly)\ndeployed via their Ministry of Defense. The aim of this group is to operate disinformation\ncampaigns regarding NATO credibility; targeting primarily Russian, Ukrainian and Polish\nspeakers across different countries across Europe since 2017. Using spear-phishing tactics,\nGhostwriter targeted members of Ukraine’s armed forces to compromise their accounts and\nreach out to their contacts to cover and aid more destructive attacks conducted to further\nRussian state interests and the actions of associated APT groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicroBackdoor\n\nMicroBackdoor is an open source backdoor that is used for C2 communications.\nThis means anyone may use this tool for various purposes and not just for\nattacks against Ukraine. Though extra features have been implemented by UAC0051 not included in the open source version.\n\n## Asylum Ambuscade\n\nThis phishing campaign was observed operating within similar parameters as\nGhostwriter/UNC-1151/TA445 activities, suggesting that this may be their work or the\ncampaign may be connected through other means. At the time of publication, there were\nenough discrepancies to prevent conclusive attribution of this campaign to TA445. Primary\ntargets chosen by Asylum Ambuscade operators differ from TA445 attributed attacks where\nTA445 pursued military personnel and organizations while Asylum Ambuscade set their\nsights on European government entities whose responsibilities are tied to transportation and\nlogistics extending beyond military affairs such as refugee relief efforts.\n\n## APT28 (Fancy Bear)\n\nThis actor is attributed as the most prevalent and deeply connected of known Russian state\nsponsored actors. Their connection to GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency tasked\nwith intelligence gathering and espionage beyond Russian territory alongside its civilian\ncounterpart SVR, lends credibility to their activities and attacks being directly aligned with\nRussian state interests.\n\nSpear-phishing has been associated with APT28 activity using high volumes of\ncompromised accounts along with newly created actor controlled infrastructure.\n\nActivities directly related to the conflict in Syria, undermining Ukraine’s relations with\nNATO/member nations, and the 2016 U.S presidential election.\n\n## Sandworm/VoodooBear (GRU)\n\nThis group is also tied to GRU and handles matters related to targeting entities in the energy\nsector dating back to 2011. Along with espionage operations, Sandworm/VoodooBear is\nknown for destructive malware deployed against industrial control and SCADA systems such\nas the 2015 attack against Ukraine’s energy sector leading to widespread blackouts.\n\nCyclopsBlink - Malicious Elf (Linux) executable.\n\nCompiled for 32-bit PowerPC architecture\nLarge-scale botnet targeting Small Office/Home Office network devices (routers)\nEncrypted C2 communication\nPersistence via device firmware upgrade process\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: In early April 2022, the United States government secured a court order allowing\nfor the removal of the malware from infected devices.\n\n## UNC-2589 (UAC-0056/SaintBear/TA471/Lorec53)\n\nThis threat group has been connected to spearphishing attempts targeting both Georgian\nand Ukrainian government entities using various malware. This group often targets\ngovernment and critical infrastructure and tends to align with Russian state objectives, but is\nnot confirmed with absolute certainty to be state sponsored.\n\nSaint_v3 - Trojan\nSaintBot - Malware Loader\nOutSteel - Document Stealer\nElephant - Malware Framework\nGrimPlant - GO Backdoor\nGraphSteel - GO Backdoor\nCobalt Strike Beacon - Default malware payload for Cobalt Strike\n\n## AcidRain (Likely connected to Sandworm)\n\nThis threat is attributed to the ELF modem wiper malware that was observed in connection to\nViasat satellite attacks. Gaining access to Viasat’s KA-SAT management infrastructure,\nattackers were able to push AcidRain to residential modems across Europe, effectively\ndenying internet access to regions reliant on high-throughput satellite telecom service due to\nlack of traditional network infrastructure resources. As the various wipers seen prior to the\nphysical invasion shed light on cyber offensive efforts and capabilities against Ukraine,\nAcidRain’s impact reaches across Europe as far as disrupting remote communications to\nwind turbines in Germany. Along with surface level function similarities, AcidRain shares\nresemblance to VPNFilter malware at the code level, the predecessor to Cyclops Blink\nattributed to Sandworm. This suggests a deeper connection to Russian GRU assets rather\nthan state sponsored activity.\n\n[Update: 2022-04-18] Sandworm connection with medium confidence\n\n## UAC–0020/Vermin Group/SPECTR [Update: 2022-04-18]\n\nA hacker collective associated with the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), a breakaway\nfaction/self proclaimed state officially designated as a terrorist organization by Ukraine. The\nVermin group claims to represent \"a security agency for the LPR\" and has been linked to\ncybercrime activities aligned with Russian state goals prior to and leading into the invasion of\nUkraine. This group is known for developing and deploying SPECTR malware, composed of\nseveral components/modules; targeting Ukrainian state entities.\n\n\n-----\n\n## UAC-0026/Scarab (China)\n\nThis group has been operational since 2012, possibly earlier, and is connected to Chinese\nthreat actors that have used phishing emails with RAR attachments leading to HeaderTIP\nmalware. Prior to the invasion, this group was observed targeting individuals worldwide;\nafterwards, setting their sites on targets within Ukraine using phishing lures bearing the\nNational Police of Ukraine graphics and contact details claiming to be collecting video\nevidence of crimes committed by the Russian military.\n\nDeployed custom backdoor “Scieron”, believed to be an earlier iteration of HeaderTIP\nObserved to reuse C2 infrastructure from previous malware campaigns\nKnown to craft lures specific to an individual target’s locale\n\n## UAC-0035/InvisiMole/LoadEdge/TunnelMole [Update: 2022-04-18]\n\nThis group has been observed conducting spear phishing attacks targeting Ukraine state\norganizations in accordance with Russian state aligned goals since 2013. Collaborative\nefforts with Gamaredon have also been seen via campaign overlap and one of the groups\ndistributing payloads using distribution networks controlled by the other. InvisiMole is the\nname attributed to the spyware used to target their victims, which historically, have been\nRussian and Ukrainian military and diplomatic entities along with other organizations across\neastern Europe. LoadEdge is a backdoor written in C++, also used by the group with various\ncommand and control capabilities. TunnelMole is the name attributed to their DNS tunnel\nmalware used to externally retrieve additional data/payloads along with exfiltrating data\ncovertly.\n\n## WhisperGate/DEV-0586\n\nThere are multiple WhisperGate campaigns as a result of overlap in attribution which is\ncommon within the research community. The most commonly referenced campaign is that of\nthe destructive malware that corrupts an infected system’s master boot record and displays a\nfake ransomware note as the data is destroyed and cannot be recovered by paying the\nransom. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) saw systems in Ukraine becoming\ninfected on January 13, 2022; Likely done so in preparation for the ground invasion.\n\n## XakNet [Update: 2022-04-18]\n\nThis group is a hacker collective, composed of \"Russian patriots\" claiming to not hide behind\nthe \"mask of Anonymous\" and vowing to retaliate against attacks targeting Russia by\ninflicting similar attacks against Ukrainian targets. Their most high profile act to date was\nleaking documents from Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs \"exposing\" a request for foreign\naid in the form of equipment to protect from chemical exposure. Prior to the invasion of\n\n\n-----\n\nUkraine, this group openly advertised offering ethical hacking guidance and instruction;\nAfterwards stating that they are no longer teaching and defending, shifting to offensive\nefforts.\n\n## Gamaredon/PrimitiveBear/Armageddon/ACTINIUM/Shuckworm (FSB)\n\nThis actor has been actively targeting Ukrainian government entities since the “annex” of the\nCrimean peninsula by Russian forces in 2013. Observed in connection to Russian appointed\nFSB officers assigned to Crimea, the group gradually moved from deploying malware\nauthored by other developers to their own custom payloads. Campaigns attributed to the\nactor show use of a combination of compromised Russian and Ukraine domains and IPs with\nautonomous systems for related IPs being physically located in Russia. A notable technique\nseen across their distribution network allows them to restrict access and requests with timed\ngates set to expire when domains rotate to a new IP; signaling the end of a particular run and\nimpeding research efforts. Based on reports from the Security Service of Ukraine, the aim of\nthis group is to obtain intelligence information from Ukrainian security, defense and law\nenforcement bodies via targeted campaigns.\n\n## CyberCrime:\n\nIn addition, we want to highlight crimeware activity, as many of these groups are associated\nwith Russian threat actors. It is very interesting that some of the physical infrastructure\nutilized by cybercrime outfits are geographically located on U.S. soil and used against US\ncitizens (along with other civilian targets worldwide) to not only access, but also collect funds\nthat eventually end up back into the hands of Russian actors. Though previously the goal\nwas simply to profit from ill-gotten gains, priorities have presumably shifted towards providing\nresources for Russian state assets.\n\nSanctions that were enacted onto Russia included a number of hosting providers as well as\ngeneral internet access. This caused a heavy blow as it seemed to present issues with what\nsome refer to as “commodity threats” that hit their inboxes daily such as IcedID, Dridex,\nHancitor, Qbot, Trickbot, etc. This was initially easing the burden for community individuals to\nfocus on other threats and make connections to less popular named threats along with\nanalysts that have to track all of this activity. The break was short lived and now we are\nseeing these actors resume operations after some retooling on their infrastructure and/or\naccess to their boxes.\n\n## Parting Words:\n\nThough this is not an exhaustive list, the content provided reveals enough to highlight where\nour collective gaps lie and where efforts should be focused to undermine the efforts tied to\nthe Russian state. As previously mentioned, further developments will be added to this article\nas the situation continues to unfold. Our list of sources below may include actors and threats\n\n\n-----\n\nto be summarized later as we gather more information and form more concrete attributions.\nFeel free to reach out to us with suggestions for content and information to include or\nelaborate on. At the time of publication, Ukrainian morale stood high as Russian military\nforces seemed to present itself as a paper tiger, especially in the face of the smaller\nUkrainian force backed by military aid from allied nations across the globe. It is critical that\nglobal efforts on the cyber-front maintain the same unified stance if we hope to see this\nconflict come to a swift end and prevent any potential escalations.\n\n## Sources\n\nUNC-3715\n\n[https://www.mandiant.com/resources/russia-invasion-ukraine-retaliation](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/russia-invasion-ukraine-retaliation)\n\nAcidRain\n\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-oneurope/\n\nWhisperGate/DEV-0586\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ukraine-cyber-conflict-cve-2021-32648whispergate/\n\nTags\n\n## Get The InQuest Insider\n\n[Find us on Twitter for frequent updates, follow our Blog for bi-weekly technical write-ups, or](https://twitter.com/inquest)\nsubscribe here to receive our monthly newsletter, The InQuest Insider.
