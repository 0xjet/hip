    "plain_text": "# Burning Umbrella \n\n### An Intelligence Report on the Winnti Umbrella and Associated State-Sponsored Attackers.\n\n Tom Hegel\n\nMay 3, 2018\n\n\n-----\n\n### Table of Contents\n\nTable of Contents 2\n\nKey Judgements 3\n\nReport Summary 4\n\nBackground 4\n\nAnalysis of Attacks on Initial Targets 9\n\nInvestigative Findings 16\n\nConclusion 16\n\nAppendix A: Associated Indicators 17\n\nAbout 401TRG 45\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key Judgements\n\n  - We assess with high confidence that the Winnti umbrella is associated with\nthe Chinese state intelligence apparatus, with at least some elements located\nin the Xicheng District of Beijing.\n\n  - A number of Chinese state intelligence operations from 2009 to 2018 that\nwere previously unconnected publicly are in fact linked to the Winnti\numbrella.\n\n  - We assess with high confidence that multiple publicly reported threat actors\noperate with some shared goals and resources as part of the Chinese state\nintelligence apparatus.\n\n  - Initial attack targets are commonly software and gaming organizations in\nUnited States, Japan, South Korea, and China. Later stage high profile\ntargets tend to be politically motivated or high value technology\norganizations.\n\n  - The Winnti umbrella continues to operate highly successfully in 2018. Their\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) remain consistent, though they\nexperiment with new tooling and attack methodologies often.\n\n  - Operational security mistakes during attacks have allowed us to acquire\nmetrics on the success of some Winnti umbrella spear phishing campaigns\nand identify attacker location with high confidence.\n\n  - The theft of code signing certificates is a primary objective of the Winnti\numbrella’s initial attacks, with potential secondary objectives based around\nfinancial gain.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Report Summary\n\nThe purpose of this report is to make public previously unreported links that exist\nbetween a number of Chinese state intelligence operations. These operations and\nthe groups that perform them are all linked to the Winnti umbrella and operate\nunder the Chinese state intelligence apparatus. Contained in this report are details\nabout previously unknown attacks against organizations and how these attacks are\nlinked to the evolution of the Chinese intelligence apparatus over the past decade.\nBased on our findings, attacks against smaller organizations operate with the\nobjective of finding and exfiltrating code signing certificates to sign malware for use\nin attacks against higher value targets. Our primary telemetry consists of months to\nyears of full fidelity network traffic captures. This dataset allowed us to investigate\nactive compromises at multiple organizations and run detections against the\nhistorical dataset, allowing us to perform a large amount of external infrastructure\nanalysis.\n\n### Background\n\nThe Winnti umbrella and closely associated entities has been active since at least\n2009, with some reports of possible activity as early as 2007. The term \"umbrella\" is\nused in this report because current intelligence indicates that the overarching entity\nconsists of multiple teams/actors whose tactics, techniques, and procedures align,\nand whose infrastructure and operations overlap. We assess that the different\nstages of associated attacks are operated by separate teams/actors, however in\nthis report we will show that the lines between them are blurred and that they are\nall associated with the same greater entity. The Winnti and Axiom group names\nwere created by Kaspersky Lab and Symantec, respectively, for their 2013/2014\nreports on the original group. The name “Winnti” is now primarily used to refer to a\ncustom backdoor used by groups under the umbrella. Multiple sources of public and\nprivate threat intelligence have their own names for individual teams. For example,\nLEAD is a common alias for the group targeting online gaming, telecom, and high\ntech organizations. Other aliases for groups related include BARIUM, Wicked\nPanda, GREF, PassCV, and others. This report details how these groups are linked\ntogether and serve a broader attacker mission. The many names associated with\nactors in the greater intelligence mission are due to the fact that they are built on\ntelemetry of the intelligence provider which is typically unique and dependent on\ntheir specific dataset. This report focuses heavily on networking related telemetry.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess with high confidence that the attackers discussed here are associated\nwith the Chinese state intelligence apparatus. This assessment is based on attacker\nTTPs, observed attack infrastructure, and links to previously published intelligence.\nTheir operations against gaming and technology organizations are believed to be\neconomically motivated in nature. However, based on the findings shared in this\nreport we assess with high confidence that the actor’s primary long-term mission is\npolitically focused. It’s important to note that not all publicly reported operations\nrelated to Chinese intelligence are tracked or linked to this group of actors. However,\nTTPs, infrastructure, and tooling show some overlap with other Chinese-speaking\nthreat actors, suggesting that the Chinese intelligence community shares human\nand technological resources across organizations. We assess with medium to high\nconfidence that the various operations described in this report are the work of\nindividual teams, including contractors external to the Chinese government, with\nvarying levels of expertise, cooperating on a specific agenda.\n\nIn 2015 the People’s Liberation Army of China (PLA) began a major reorganization\nwhich included the creation of the Strategic Support Force (SSF / PLASSF). SSF is\nresponsible for space, cyber, and electronic warfare missions. Some of the overlap\nwe observed from groups could potentially be related to this reorganization.\nNotably, key incident details below include attacker mistakes that likely reveal the\ntrue location of some attackers as the Xicheng District of Beijing.\n\n**Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**\nThough the TTPs of the attacking teams vary depending on the operation, their use\nof overlapping resources presents a common actor profile. Key interests during\nattacks often include the theft of code signing certificates, source code, and internal\ntechnology documentation. They also may attempt to manipulate virtual economies\nfor financial gain. While unconfirmed, the financial secondary objective may be\nrelated to personal interests of the individuals behind the attacks.\n\nInitial attack methods include phishing to gain entry into target organization\nnetworks. The group then follows with custom malware or publicly available\noffensive tooling (Metasploit/Cobalt Strike), and may use a number of methods to\nminimize their risk of being detected. Such techniques include a particular focus on\n“living off the land” by using a victim's own software products, approved remote\naccess systems, or system administration tools for spreading and maintaining\nunauthorized access to the network.\n\nWe have observed incidents where the attacker used other victim organizations as\na proxy for unauthorized remote access. In these cases, organization 1 had been\ncompromised for a long period of time, and the attacker accessed victim\norganization 2 via the organization 1 network.\n\n\n-----\n\nDelivery and C2 domains routinely have subdomains which resemble target\norganizations. Additionally, their C2 domains are used across many targets, while\nsubdomains tend to be created and removed quickly and are unique to a particular\ntarget or campaign. Also noteworthy is that the actors set their domains to resolve\nto 127.0.0.1 when not in use, similar to what was originally reported on by\nKaspersky Lab (see below).\n\nThe actor often uses TLS encryption for varying aspects of C2 and malware delivery.\nAs noted in the “Infrastructure Analysis” section of this report, the actor primarily\nabuses Let’s Encrypt to sign SSL certificates. We also observed many cases in\nwhich self-signed certificates were used in attacks.\n\nOverall, the Winnti umbrella and linked groups are lacking when it comes to\noperational security. However, some activities linked to these groups follow better\noperational security and infrastructure management approaches. This may be a clue\nto the division of responsibilities by team and skill level within the broader\norganization.\n\n**Targets:**\nThe Winnti umbrella and linked groups’ initial targets are gaming studios and high\ntech businesses. They primarily seek code signing certificates and software\nmanipulation, with potential financially motivated secondary objectives. These\ntargets have been identified in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China.\n\nBased on the infrastructure, links to previous reporting, and recently observed\nattacks, the broader organization’s main targets are political. Historically this has\nincluded Tibetan and Chinese journalists, Uyghur and Tibetan activists, the\ngovernment of Thailand, and prominent international technology organizations.\n\nOne example of a politically focused lure by the Winnti umbrella and linked groups is\nan end of 2017 document titled “Resolution 2375 (2017) Strengthening Sanctions\non DPR of KOREA” which is a malicious file associated with the C2 infrastructure\ndescribed here - see MD5: 3b58e122d9e17121416b146daab4db9d.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Some Key Public Reports:**\n2013​:\nKaspersky Lab publicly reported [​on the original Winnti group​, technical details](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\n[around the ​Winnti samples​, and ​various honeypot analysis methods​. Most](https://securelist.com/winnti-1-0-technical-analysis/37002/)\nnoteworthy is the Winnti umbrella’s targeting of gaming organizations in search of\ncode signing certificates, virtual currencies, and updating mechanisms which could\npotentially be used to attack victims’ clients. Interestingly, this was the first\nidentified trojan for the 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating system with a valid\ndigital signature as noted by the author. The abuse of signed applications is a very\neffective attack approach that the entity continues to use.\n\n2014​:\n[Novetta released an ​outstanding report detailing “Operation SMN,”​ in which they](http://www.novetta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Executive_Summary-Final_1.pdf)\ncollaborated with a number of private organizations on a large scale malware\neradication operation which is linked to the original Winnti group by the malware\nbeing delivered. In the report, the actor is named Axiom. Novetta reported links to\npublications from as far back as 2009 that also link the group to the Chinese state\nintelligence apparatus with high confidence. Links exist to various known attacks\nand actor groups, such as “Operation Aurora,” Elderwood Group’s successful 2010\nattack against Google and many other organizations. Another link exists to the\nsuccessful compromise of the security organization [​Bit9 in 2013​, where their own](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/02/security-firm-bit9-hacked-used-to-spread-malware/)\nproduct was used to sign and spread malware to their customers. In addition,\n[FireEye’s “Operation DeputyDog​” detailed attacks on Japanese targets from the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/operation-deputydog-zero-day-cve-2013-3893-attack-against-japanese-targets.html)\nsame attack infrastructure. Many other incidents are detailed in the Operation SMN\nreport. Following all of these details back in time, we can see an overlap in TTPs and\n\n\n-----\n\ntargets from the [​APT1 report by Mandiant​, which serves as a great historical](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf)\nexample of Chinese intelligence cyber operations in their most basic form.\n\n2016​:\n[Cylance ​released a blog post​](https://blog.cylance.com/digitally-signed-malware-targeting-gaming-companies) reporting on digitally signed malware used in targeted\nattacks against gaming organizations in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Europe,\nRussia, and the United States. Cylance refers to the attacking entity as “PassCV” in\ntheir reporting. Cylance successfully identified a large quantity of malware binaries\nwhich were signed with valid certificates stolen from a number of gaming studios in\nEast Asia. In addition to detailing the individual certificates and signed malware,\nthey identified a significant amount of network infrastructure which contain various\ninteresting links to our own findings.\n\n2017 - March/April​:\n[Trend Micro reported ​on attacks that abused GitHub for use in malware command](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/winnti-abuses-github/)\nand control, which they attributed to the original Winnti group. Amusingly, Trend\nMicro later reported on an individual linked to the group and the attacks [​who](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group/)\n[happens to be a fan of pigs​.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group/)\n\n2017 - July 5th​:\n[Citizen Lab reported​ on attacks against journalists by an actor mimicking](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/07/insider-information-an-intrusion-campaign-targeting-chinese-language-news-sites/)\nChina-focused news organizations HK01, Epoch Times, Mingjing News, and Bowen\nPress. As Citizen Lab noted, these news organizations are blocked in China for their\npolitical views. The report notes that malware used in these attacks was linked to a\nstolen code signing certificate mentioned in the Cylance PassCV post. That overlap,\nin addition to infrastructure links from [​a Palo Alto Unit 42 blog post​, strongly links](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/attack-campaign-on-the-government-of-thailand-delivers-bookworm-trojan/)\nthis attack to the previously mentioned reports as well as to our own. As Unit 42\nreports, the attacks against entities in the government of Thailand used the\n“bookworm” trojan.\n\n2017 - July/October​:\n[ProtectWise 401TRG published our own findings​ and](https://401trg.pw/winnti-evolution-going-open-source/) [​an update​ on LEAD using](https://401trg.pw/an-update-on-winnti/)\nopen source and public tooling in attacks against Japanese gaming organizations.\nThese attacks are linked with high confidence to ongoing operations in the United\nStates and East Asia.\n\nOther Noteworthy Events​:\nIn 2017, multiple supply-chain attacks occurred which had some similarities to the\nWinnti umbrella and associated entities. For example, [​Kaspersky reported on](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\n[ShadowPad​, a large-scale compromise of NetSarang, which resembles the Winnti](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\n[and PlugX malware. In addition, ​Kaspersky​](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/910059453948579840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intezer.com%2Fevidence-aurora-operation-still-active-supply-chain-attack-through-ccleaner%2F&tfw_creator=IntezerLabs&tfw_site=IntezerLabs) [and ​Intezer​](http://www.intezer.com/evidence-aurora-operation-still-active-supply-chain-attack-through-ccleaner/) identified notable code\nsimilarities to the Winnti umbrella and APT17 in the compromise of Piriform, which\n\n\n-----\n\nallowed attackers to sign and spread altered versions of the CCleaner software to a\nlarge customer base.\n\n### Analysis of Attacks on Initial Targets\n\nThroughout 2017 and 2018, ProtectWise 401TRG was involved in a number of\ndetection and incident response engagements with our customers that linked back\nto the Winnti umbrella and other closely associated entities. Through the analysis of\npublic and private intelligence, we have successfully identified similar attacks, which\nallow us to assess with high confidence that the details below follow a global attack\ntrend as the Chinese intelligence operations have evolved over time.\n\n**2017 Operations:**\nOne of the most common tactics used by the Winnti umbrella and related entities is\nphishing users whose credentials may provide elevated access to a target network.\nWe have observed spear-phishing campaigns that target human resources and\nhiring managers, IT staff, and internal information security staff, which are generally\nvery effective.\n\nIn 2017 the entity focused most of its efforts around technical job applicant email\nsubmissions to software engineering, IT, and recruiting staff, which we originally\n[reported on at our ​401trg.pw​](https://401trg.pw/) blog. The phishing lures used multiple languages,\nincluding Japanese as in the below example:\n\nThe approximate translation is as follows:\n\n_I saw your job posting. My main languages are Object-C, JAVA, and Swift,_\n_and I have 7 years experience with Ruby and 6 years experience with PHP. I_\n_have 5 years experience developing iOS apps, as well as Android apps,_\n_AWS, Jenkins, Microsoft Azure, ZendFramework, and smartphone application_\n_payment processing. I also have 5 years experience with MSSQL, Mysql,_\n_Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Please see here: [malicious link]_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe process that followed a target clicking the malicious link evolved as the attacker\nprogressed through the campaigns. The links consistently sent the victim to a fake\nresume, but the exact format of that resume changed over time; we have observed\nresumes being delivered as DOC, XLS, PDF, and HTML files. Once opened, the fake\nresumes performed various actions in an effort to download malware onto the\nvictim host. During the same time period, we also observed the actor using the\nBrowser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) to compromise victim hosts and download\nCobalt Strike. In this campaign, the attackers experimented with publicly available\ntooling for attack operations. During this infection process, the actor was known to\ncheck the target operating system and deliver malware, signed by a previously\nstolen key, for the appropriate host environment. In some cases, valid Apple\ncertificates stolen from victims were used in this process, which linked the attack to\nadditional victim organizations.\n\nPost-compromise actions by the attacker followed a common pattern. First they\nattempted to spread laterally in the network using stolen credentials and various\nreconnaissance efforts, such as manually examining shares and local files. The\nprimary goal of these attacks was likely to find code-signing certificates for signing\nfuture malware. The secondary goals of the attackers depended on the type of\nvictim organization, but were often financial. For example, gaming organizations\ntended to fall victim to manipulation or theft of in-game virtual currencies.\nNon-gaming victims may have experienced theft of intellectual property such as\nuser or technology data.\n\n**2018 Operations:**\nMore recently, various attack campaigns from the Winnti umbrella and associated\ngroups have been very successful without the use of any exploits or malware.\nPhishing remains the initial infection vector but the campaign themes have matured.\nIn 2018, the campaigns have largely been focused on common services such as\nOffice 365 and Gmail.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that attackers likely have additional information on their\ntarget organizations' preferred email solutions based on previous incidents or open\nsource intelligence.\n\nIn more recent phishing campaigns conducted by the Winnti umbrella and\nassociated groups, URL shortening services have been used. For example, Google’s\nURL shortening service goo.gl was used over the past weeks, allowing us to gain\ninsight into the scale of this campaign using publicly available analytics.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see from the above screenshot, this particular phishing campaign ran\nfrom March 20th to March 28th, 2018. Notably, the link was created on February\n23rd, 2018, indicating roughly three weeks of preparation for the attacks. These\nmetrics allow us to gain insight into who clicked the link in a phishing email and was\ndirected to a phishing or malware delivery landing page. According to Google\nanalytics, there were a total of 56 clicks. 29 were from Japan, 15 from the United\nStates, 2 from India, and 1 from Russia. 33 of the clicks were from Google Chrome,\nand 23 were from Safari. 30 were from Windows OS hosts, and 26 were macOS\nhosts.\n\nIn general, the attackers phish for credentials to a user’s cloud storage, and would\nbe expected to later attempt malware delivery in the cases of a failed credential\nphish or valueless cloud storage.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn cases where the victim uses O365 and/or G-suite for enterprise file storage, the\nattackers manually review the contents for data of value. If code signing certificates\nare stored here, the primary mission has been accomplished, as they may be easily\ndownloaded. In other cases, the attackers attempt to use other files and\ndocumentation in the cloud storage to help them traverse or gain privileges on the\nnetwork. The targets in 2018 include IT staff, and commonly sought out files include\ninternal network documentation and tooling such as corporate remote access\nsoftware.\n\nOnce the attackers gain remote access to the network via malware or stolen remote\naccess tooling and credentials, the operation continues as we’ve seen, though their\npost-compromise actions have become more efficient and automated. Internal\nreconnaissance is performed by scanning the internal network for open ports 80,\n139, 445, 6379, 8080, 10022, and 30304. The choice of ports by the attacker\nindicates a strong interest in internal web and file storage services. An interesting\naddition is the use of 30304, which is the peer discovery port for Ethereum clients.\n\nIn the attackers’ ideal situation, all remote access occurs through their own C2\ninfrastructure, which acts as a proxy and obscures their true location. However, we\nhave observed a few cases of the attackers mistakenly accessing victim machines\nwithout a proxy, potentially identifying the true location of the individual running the\nsession. In all of these cases, the net block was 221.216.0.0/13, the China Unicom\nBeijing Network, Xicheng District.\n\n**Visualizing Attacker Infrastructure**\nBased on the various incidents we have been involved in, in addition to past public\nreporting and open-source intelligence, we can construct a map representing the\ninfrastructure most closely associated with the Winnti umbrella and closely related\nentities. For the sake of producing an accurate representation of the infrastructure,\nwe are excluding any shared infrastructure (such as hosting provider IPs used for\nmany unrelated domains) and low confidence indicators. Please note this is not an\nexhaustive list of all active infrastructure in use by the group.\n\nAs detailed below, this infrastructure spans at least eight years of activity by the\nWinnti umbrella and related groups. Please note, as this section heavily references\nthe “Some Key Public Reports” section, above, we recommend reading that first.\nIndicators are provided in Appendix A.\n\n1. The area of the map labeled #1 is the phishing, malware delivery, fake\nresume, and C2 infrastructure. This includes domains, IPs, malware hashes,\nSSL certificates, and WHOIS information. In this section of the infrastructure,\nwe primarily observe the network and file indicators which would be used\n\n\n-----\n\nagainst targets valued for code signing certificates, software manipulation,\nand potential financial manipulation. The indicators detailed in the 2017 &\n2018 Initial Target section of this report are located in #1. Infrastructure in\nthis area is currently in use and not entirely historical.\n\n2. This area is a network that we assess is associated with the umbrella with\nlow confidence. The most interesting findings here are the large number of\nLet’s Encrypt SSL certificates in use and the overlap with attacker exclusive\ninfrastructure. This proposed relationship is generated by infrastructure links\nalone, as no malicious activity has been confirmed to or from region #2.\nInfrastructure in this area is currently in use and not historical.\n\n3. Area #3 is linked to the initial attack infrastructure (#1) by domain WHOIS\ndetails, likely from operational security mistakes. We assess with high\nconfidence that these infrastructures are linked. Based on the lax structure\nand naming of this section, it is highly probable that it is used for attacker\nexperimenting and development. Some examples include domains such as\n“nobody.will.know.whoami[.]la”, “secret.whoami[.]la”, and\n“no.ip.detect.if.using.ipv6[.]la”. Infrastructure in this area is currently in use\nand not historical.\n\n4. This area has various links to #3 in which an individual software developer is\nidentified. We asses this connection with low to medium confidence and will\nrefrain from publicly sharing details in this report. This area contains many\npersonally operated domains and SSL certificates. Infrastructure in this area\nis currently in use and not historical.\n\n5. Area #5 of the map is part of what Novetta reported on as Operation SMN in\n2014. Infrastructure in this area is purely historical and based on Novetta’s\nreporting, which we can link to area #1 via known umbrella infrastructure.\n[The vast majority of indicators in this area are the ​many associated hashes​,](http://www.novetta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hashes.txt)\ncombined with their C2 destination domains and IPs.\n\n6. This area of the map is what Cylance reported on as PassCV in 2016. The\nvast majority of infrastructure and indicators here are stolen code signing\ncertificates, malware signed with the certificates, and C2 domains. This area\ncontains information on many victims of campaigns related to area #1.\nInfrastructure in this area is historical. We assess that this area is linked to\nthe Winnti umbrella with high confidence.\n\n7. This section represents infrastructure identified by Citizen Lab in their July 5th\n2017 reporting on attacks against journalists. As they originally identified,\none of the NetWire binaries was signed with a stolen certificate linked to #6,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Cylance PassCV report. We were able to further expand this section by\npivoting off of additional domain WHOIS information.\n\n8. Lastly is area #8, which links back with high confidence to #7 (Citizen Lab\nreporting) and #6 (PassCV). This area consists of domains, IPs, MD5 file\nhashes, and further WHOIS operational security mistakes. This area is similar\nin functionality to #1 and #3, serving as infrastructure for both high-value\npolitically focused attacks and developer personal use. This section links to\nthe online identities of an individual we asses to be associated with the\nWinnti umbrella or a closely related group at a medium to high confidence.\nInfrastructure in this area is currently in use and not historical. One example\nof malicious activity in this area was the document detailing the\nstrengthening of sanctions against North Korea, above. These activities are\nsimilar to the type of politically motivated targeted attacks Citizen Lab\nreported on. Some infrastructure in this area is currently in use and is not\ncompletely historical.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Investigative Findings\n\nBased on incident response engagements, research into the associated attacker\ninfrastructure, and previously reported research, we can summarize our findings as\nfollows:\n\n1. The Chinese intelligence apparatus has been reported on under many\nnames, including Winnti, PassCV, APT17, Axiom, LEAD, BARIUM, Wicked\nPanda, and GREF.\n\n2. The overlap of TTPs and infrastructure between the Winnti umbrella and\nother groups indicates the use of shared human and technology resources\nworking towards an overarching goal. Operational security mistakes allow\nthe linking of attacks on lower value targets to higher value campaigns.\nReuse of older attack infrastructure, links to personal networks, and observed\nTTPs play a role in this overlap.\n\n3. The attackers behind observed activity in 2018 operate from the Xicheng\nDistrict of Beijing via the net block 221.216.0.0/13.\n\n4. Initial attack targets are commonly software organizations in the United\nStates, Japan, South Korea, and China. Later stage high profile targets tend\nto be political organizations or high-value technology companies.\n\n5. The attackers grow and learn to evade detection when possible, but lack\noperational security when it comes to the reuse of some tooling. Living off the\nland and adaptability to individual target networks allow them to operate\nwith high rates of success.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe hope the information we’ve shared in this report will help potential targets and\nknown victims in addition to the greater information security community. Though\nthey have at times been sloppy, the Winnti umbrella and its associated entities\nremain an advanced and potent threat. We hope that the information contained\nwithin this report will help defenders thwart this group in the future.\n\nWe’d like to extend a special thank you to all the victims, targets, researchers, and\nsecurity vendors who have shared their own findings over the years.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A: Associated Indicators\n\nIf you are interested in automating the intake of public 401TRG
