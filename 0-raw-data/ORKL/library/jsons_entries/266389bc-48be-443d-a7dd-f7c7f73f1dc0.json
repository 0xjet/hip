It's affected many organizations, including federal agencies. Kevin Mandia\nis the CEO of FireEye, a cybersecurity company that protects clients against malicious\nsoftware and investigates hacks. His company was the first one to discover that this massive\nbreach happened. Good morning to you.\n\nFIREEYE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER KEVIN MANDIA: MARGARET, good morning to\nyou.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration has described this as an ongoing attack\nand poses grave risk to the federal government, to state governments, to private institutions,\ncritical infrastructure. It went undetected for nearly nine months. How should the public\nunderstand this? How significant is it?\n\n\n-----\n\nMANDIA: Right, well, there s a lot of ways to look at this intrusion, and first and foremost, it s\ndifferent than other ones that we commonly respond to. We respond to over a thousand\nbreaches a year. And what separates this is who did it, how they did it and what they did\nwhen they got in. And I'll get to the who probably last. But when you look at the how,\nMARGARET, that's what makes this totally unique. This was not a drive by shooting on the\ninformation highway. This was a sniper round from somebody a mile away from your house.\nThis was special operations. And it was going to take special operations to detect this\nbreach. So, the how they did it was in a way that was utterly clandestine, very difficult to tell.\nAnd quite frankly, it was a backdoor into the American supply chain that separates this from\nthousands of other cases that we've worked throughout our careers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does it go back further than March? How long have hackers been\ninside the system?\n\nMANDIA: Well, so right now, what we've observed with this latest campaign, first, I think this\nthreat actor wasn't a one and done. What I mean by that is I think these are folks that we've\nresponded to in the '90s, in the early 2000s. It's a continuing game in cyberspace. You know,\nthere's a time in our lives where the domains that we had espionage in or the domains that\nwe had combat in or differences in were land, sea, air, then space. And now we have cyber.\nThis is just one campaign in a long battle in cyberspace. But this campaign specifically has\nthe earliest evidences of being designed. In October of 2019 when code was changed in the\nSolarWinds Orion platform, but it was innocuous code. It was not a backdoor. Then\nsometime in March, the operators behind this attack did put malicious code into the supply\nchain, injected it in there and that is the- the backdoor that impacted everybody. I think,\nMARGARET, it's important to note everybody says this is potentially the biggest intrusion in\nour history. The reality is the blast radius for this, I kind of explain it with a funnel. It's true that\nover 300,000 companies use SolarWinds, but you come down from that total number down\nto about 18,000 or so companies that actually had-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMANDIA: --the backdoor or malicious code in a network. And then you come down to the\nnext part. It's probably only about 50 organizations or companies, somewhere in that zone-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMANDIA: --that's genuinely impacted by the threat actor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to that in a moment, but attribution. Secretary\nof state said it's Russia.\n\nMANDIA: Sure.\n\n\n-----\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A Republican senator who heads the Senate Intelligence\nCommittee said it's increasingly clear that this was Russian intelligence. Do you agree that\nthis was Russia? And what evidence do you base that on?\n\nMANDIA: Well, I think that is definitely a nation behind this. You just heard me say the attack\nstarted with a dry run in October of 2019. This wasn't a ransomware attack, not a drive by\nshooting where somebody breaks in-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMANDIA: --and it's kind of like a brick through your window. And it's pretty obvious, hey, they\nbroke in with a brick through the window and then they stole your jewels. This is more like a\ncase where somebody came in through a trapdoor in your basement that you never knew\nabout, put on an invisibility cloak and you just got the sense there in your networks, but you\nweren't even sure how. You were like, there's something different-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMANDIA: --right now. Something's been moved. And it took-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you know better than anyone-\nMANDIA: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRRENNAN: --that there are only a very few number of nation states capable\nof what you are describing in terms of skill. Russian intelligence-\nMANDIA: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --specifically the SVR, has repeatedly been pointed to by officials.\nIs that who you believe did this right?\n\nMANDIA: Right. I think this is an attack very consistent with that, I also believe this, we're\ngoing to get attribution right. The amount of resources inside the government, inside the\nprivate sector and the reach that we have, we can speculate it or we can do some more work\nand put a neon sign on the building of the folks that did this. And I'm very confident as we\ncontinue the investigation, as it gets broader, as more people learn the tools, tactics and\nprocedures of this attack, we're going to bring it back and we're going to get attribution.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMANDIA: Not 92% right, not consistent with, but 100%. Let's just get it right-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMANDIA: --so that we can proportionately respond, period.\n\n\n-----\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And- and it may take time to do that. But, I- I press you on\nattribution because obviously, if- if you want to stop it from happening again, you actually\nhave to identify who did it in the first place. And the president kind of muddied those-\nMANDIA: Right, absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --muddied those waters yesterday when he said it may be China,\nthe media's overplaying it, downplayed the idea it was Russia. I'm not asking you to weigh in\non politics, but how do you stop this from happening again and was it-\nMANDIA: Right. Well, clearly-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have to specifically target one country? How do you do\nthis?\n\nMANDIA: Well, I think you have doctrine. That's why we have doctrine for things like the use\nof chemical weapons. You saw what happened when somebody used chemical weapons in\nSyria. There was retaliation. Folks have to know the rules of the game. And the problem in\ncyber is we're not doing the work to come up with the doctrine. If you publish your doctrinewe're uniquely vulnerable in cyberspace. We're the ones in the glass house. These attacks\nwill continue to escalate, and get worse if we do nothing. So, you know, just as a\ncybersecurity professional, I recognize if you don't communicate the rules of the game,\nhere's the doctrine and here's the penalty when you violate it. We're going to see the borders\ncontinue to be pushed outward in cyber attacks to the point where, when do we finally do the\nwork-\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMANDIA: --when it's already intolerable, when it already got so bad that we have no choice\nbut to respond.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMANDIA: But like you said, it starts with doctrine. With doctrine, you have to get attribution\nright.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMANDIA: And with attribution, then you have to do a proportional response to whoever the\nactors were.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Kevin Mandia, thank you very much for your insight.
