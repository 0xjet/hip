We have also observed an actor commonly known as Cobalt Gang\n(or Group) using another new downloader that shares many of these characteristics since early 2018.\nGroup-IB named this malware “CobInt” and released a report on its use by Cobalt Gang in May [3].\nWhile we noticed that Cobalt Gang appeared to stop using CobInt as a first-stage downloader around\nthe time researchers at Group-IB published their findings, they have since returned to using the\ndownloader as of July. Arbor Networks also recently released a blog post detailing some of the\nrenewed CobInt activity [4]. In this post, we describe recent activity that we have observed and analyze\nthe multi-stage CobInt malware in detail.\n\n**Campaign Analysis**\n\nOn August 2, 2018, we observed messages with the subject “Подозрение на мошенничество”\n(Translated from Russian: “Suspicion of fraud”) purporting to be from “Interkassa” using a sender email\naddress with a lookalike domain “denis[@]inter-kassa[.]com”. The messages contained two URLs. The\nfirst linked to a macro document that ultimately installed the More_eggs downloader [5], while the\nsecond linked directly to the CobInt stage 1 executable. This campaign was also detailed in Arbor’s\nreport [4].\n\nOn August 14, 2018, we observed messages spoofing the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) with\nlookalike sender domains sepa-europa[.]com or sepa-europa[.]info and subjects such as “notification”,\n“letter”, “message”, and “notice”. The messages (Figure 1) contained:\n\n1. A Microsoft Word attachment (sepa rules.doc) -- a ThreadKit [6] exploit document that would\n\nexploit CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-11882, or CVE-2018-0802 -- to execute the embedded CobInt\nStage 1 payload.\n2. In some cases, URLs linking directly to the CobInt downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Example message from August 14_\n\nOn August 16, 2018, we observed messages purporting to be from Alfa Bank using a lookalike domain\naifabank[.]com and subjects such as “Fraud Control”, “Фрауд” (Translates to “Fraud”),\n“Предотвращение хищения” (Translates to “Prevention of theft“), and “Блокирование транзакций”\n(Translates to “Transaction Blocking”). The messages (Figure 2) contain URLs linking to a hosted\nThreadKit exploit document that would exploit CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-11882, or CVE-2018-0802,\nto execute the embedded CobInt Stage 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Example message from August 16, with stolen branding_\n\nOn September 4, 2018, we observed messages purporting to be from Raiffeisen Bank using lookalike\nsender domains ralffeisen[.]com and subjects such as “Fraudulent transaction”, “Wire Transfer Fraud”,\nand “Request for data”. The messages (Figure 3) contained a Microsoft Word attachment that used a\nrelationship object to download an external VBscript file containing an exploit for CVE-2018-8174\nleading to the execution of CobInt stage 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Example message from the September 4 campaign_\n\n**Malware Analysis**\n\nCobInt is a downloader malware written in C. Its name is based on the association of the malware with\nthe “Cobalt Group” threat actor and an internal DLL name of “int.dll” used in some of the samples. The\nmalware can be broken up into three stages: an initial downloader that downloads the main\ncomponent, the main component itself, and various additional modules.\n\nStage 1: Basic Downloader\n\nThe first stage is a basic downloader with the purpose of downloading the main CobInt component. As\nwith other downloaders we have examined recently, its functionality is disguised by the use of Windows\nAPI function hashing (an implementation of the hashing algorithm in Python is available on Github [7]).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command and control (C&C) host and URI are stored as encrypted strings. The encryption\nalgorithm is a basic XOR with a 4-byte key that changes from sample to sample (an IDA Pro Python\nscript that extracts and decrypts the strings from a memory dump is available on Github [8]). In the\nanalyzed sample (from August 14) the C&C host and URI were “rietumu[.]me” and “xaczkajeieypiarll”\nrespectively.\n\nThe next stage is downloaded via HTTPS and an example of request and response data is shown in\nFigures 4 and 5.\n\n_Figure 4: Stage 1 HTTPS request_\n\n_Figure 5: Stage 1 HTTPS response data_\n\nThe response data is encrypted using three layers (a Python script that decrypts the response is\navailable on Github [9]):\n\n1. A character-based substitution cipher\n2. Base64 encoding\n3. XOR using the same XOR key as used for string encryption\n\nThe decrypted data contains a DLL, which is CobInt’s main component. Stage 1 finishes by loading and\nexecuting the DLL.\n\nStage 2: Main Component\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main component downloads and executes various modules from its C&C. C&C hosts are stored in\na 64-byte chunk of encrypted data. They can be decrypted by XORing with a 64-byte XOR key (an IDA\nPro Python script that can extract and decrypt the hosts from a memory dump is available on Github\n\n[10]). C&C hosts are pipe delimited, but at the time of publication we have not seen more than one host\nspecified in the encrypted text. In the analyzed sample, the C&C host was the same as the stage 1\nC&C: rietumu[.]me.\n\nThe malware uses HTTPS to communicate with the C&C server. An example command poll request is\nshown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6: Stage 2 HTTPS command poll request_\n\nThe C&C URI is similar to the stage 1 URI, but instead of being hardcoded, the URI is generated for\neach request. The URI generation encodes information that is likely used as a “bot ID” to identify the\nvictim:\n\nA random 4- to 10-byte XOR key is generated\nThe following data is hashed with the algorithm shown in Figure 7 below:\n\nHash of the MAC Address (same algorithm as in Figure 7)\nCurrent process ID\nUnknown argument (hardcoded to 0x01)\nThe hashed data is XOR-encoded using the randomly generated XOR key\nThe following data is organized into a binary structure:\n\nRandom XOR key length\nRandom XOR key\nXOR-encoded hashed data\nThe entire structure is XOR-encoded with the 64-byte XOR key used in the C&C host obfuscation\nThe binary data is encoded into characters using an unknown encoding algorithm\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Hash function used in various parts of stage 2_\n\nAn example of response data is shown in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8: Stage 2 HTTPS response data_\n\nThe response is meant to look like an HTML file by including various HTML tags (a creative way to\npotentially make analysts and tools overlook it), but, in fact, contains encrypted data. It can be\ndecrypted using the following process (Python scripts that perform the decryption are available on\nGithub [11]):\n\nRemove HTML tags\nConvert all text to lowercase\nRemove all characters that are not “a-z”\nConvert the characters into binary data via an unknown decoding algorithm\nXOR decrypt the binary data with the embedded 64-byte XOR key used in C&C host decryption\nPerform a second round of XOR decryption using the following key:\n\nXOR key length is indicated by the last byte of data\nXOR key is the last “X” bytes of data (excluding length byte), where “X” is the length of the\nkey\n\nA decrypted response contains the following structure:\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand (BYTE)\nCommand ID (DWORD)\nCommand data\n\nWe have identified four commands that may be sent to the malware from the C&C:\n\n1. Load/execute module\n2. Stop polling C&C\n3. Execute function set by module (at the time of publication we have not seen how this functionality\n\nis used)\n4. Update C&C polling wait time\n\nStage 3: Modules\n\nCommand 1 above implements the main functionality of CobInt: to download and execute additional\nmodules. The data for this command is organized in the following binary structure:\n\nModule hash (see Figure 7 above) (DWORD)\nModule length (DWORD)\nModule\nEntry point (DWORD)\nUnknown DWORD passed to module\nUnknown remaining data passed to module\n\nModules are loaded as shellcode and begin executing at the indicated entry point. The code at the\nentry point XOR decrypts itself with a 4-byte XOR key that changes from module to module (see Figure\n8). Once decrypted, the module turns into a DLL.\n\n_Figure 9: Example of module decrypting itself into a DLL_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the module DLL is executed, an operations function is also passed to it from the main\ncomponent that defines two operations:\n\n1. Queue data in the main component to be sent to the C&C server\n2. Register a function to be executed by command 3 (at the time of publication we have not seen\n\nhow this functionality is used)\n\nModule responses and error messages are queued up and sent to the C&C server during the next\ncommand poll request. If there are any messages to be sent during the command poll, the HTTPS\nrequest is switched from GET to POST and the message is included as POST data. Message data is\nformatted in the following binary structure:\n\nModule hash\nResponse/error code\nData length\nData\nRandom 32- or 64-byte XOR key\n\nThe message is encrypted in 3 layers:\n\n1. First four components are XOR-encrypted using the randomly generated XOR key\n2. The entire structure is XOR-encrypted using the embedded 64-byte XOR key used in C&C host\n\nencryption\n3. The binary data is converted to characters using an unknown encoding algorithm\n\nAt the time of publication we have observed two modules being sent from a C&C server, whose\nfunction was to:\n\n1. Send a screenshot to the C&C\n2. Send a list of running process names to the C&C\n\nWe assume then that, following the reconnaissance actions above, threat actors would deploy\nadditional modules to infected systems of interest.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCobInt provides additional evidence that threat actors -- from newer players we featured in our\nAdvisorsBot blog to established actors like TA505 and Cobalt Group-- are increasingly looking to\nstealthy downloaders to initially infect systems and then only install additional malware on systems of\ninterest. As defenses improve across the board, threat actors must innovate to improve the returns on\ntheir investments in malware and infection vectors, making this approach consistent with the “follow the\nmoney” theme we have associated with a range of financially motivated campaigns over the years.\nThis appears to be the latest trend as threat actors look to increase their effectiveness and differentiate\nfinal payloads based on user profiles.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/new-modular-downloaders-fingerprint-systemsprepare-more-part-1-marap\n\n\n-----\n\n[2] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/new-modular-downloaders-fingerprint-systemspart-2-advisorsbot\n\n[3] [https://www.group-ib.com/blog/renaissance](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/renaissance)\n\n[4] [https://asert.arbornetworks.com/double-the-infection-double-the-fun/](https://asert.arbornetworks.com/double-the-infection-double-the-fun/)\n\n[5] https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/backdoor-carrying-emails-set-sights-onrussian-speaking-businesses/\n\n[6] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/unraveling-ThreadKit-new-document-exploitbuilder-distribute-The-Trick-Formbook-Loki-Bot-malware\n\n[7] [https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage1_func_hashes.py](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage1_func_hashes.py)\n\n[8] [https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage1_decrypt_str.py](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage1_decrypt_str.py)\n\n[9] [https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage1_decrypt_response.py](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage1_decrypt_response.py)\n\n[10] [https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage2_decrypt_str.py](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage2_decrypt_str.py)\n\n[11]\n[https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage2_decrypt_response.py](https://github.com/EmergingThreats/threatresearch/blob/master/cobint/stage2_decrypt_response.py)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nhxxps://download[.]outlook-368[.]com/Document00591674.doc URL Download\nURL to\nMacro\nDocument\n(August 2)\n\nhxxp://sepa-europa[.]eu/transactions/id02082018.jpg URL Download\nURL to\nCobInt\nStage 1\n(August 2)\n\nhxxp://sepa-europa[.]eu/document.scr URL Download\nURL to\nCobInt\nStage 1\n(August 2)\n\n6ca3fc2924214dbf14ba63dde2edb1e5045a405c3370a624c1bb785f1dc0e8ff SHA256 Macro\nDocument\n(August 2)\n\n\n-----\n\n5859a21be4ca9243f6adf70779e6986f518c3748d26c427a385efcd3529d8792 SHA256 CobInt\nStage 1\n(August 2)\n\nibfseed[.]com Host CobInt C&C\n(August 2)\n\n0367554ce285a3622eb5ca1991cfcb98b620d0609c07cf681d9546e2bf1761c4 SHA256 ThreadKit\nAttachment\n(August 14)\n\nhxxps://sepacloud[.]eu/file/Documents/document_78219.jpg URL CobInt\nStage 1\nDownload\nURL\n(August 14)\n\nhxxps://sepa-cloud[.]com/file/Documents/document_78219.jpg URL CobInt\nStage 1\nDownload\nURL\n(August 14)\n\nhxxps://sepa-cloud[.]com/file/Documents/document_78219.scr URL CobInt\nStage 1\nDownload\nURL\n(August 14)\n\ndad7b4bfe0a1adc5ca04cd572f4e6979e64201d51d26472539c0241a76a50f28 SHA256 CobInt\nStage 1\n(August 14)\n\nrietumu[.]me Host CobInt C&C\n(August 14)\n\n2f7b5219193541ae993f5cf87a1f6c07705aaa907354a6292bc5c8d8585e8bd1 SHA256 CobInt\nStage 2\n(August 14)\n\n1fc24f89f1d27addd422c99a163cedc97497b76b5240da3b5f58096025bbe383 SHA256 Decrypted\nScreenshot\nModule\n(August 14)\n\n\n-----\n\nab73ad1ef898e25052c500244a754aa9964dff7fd173b903d1230a9e8d91596f SHA256 Decrypted\nGet Process\nNames\nModule\n(September\n4)\n\nhxxps://aifa-bank[.]com/documents/2018/fraud/fraud_16082018.doc URL Download\nURL to\nThreadKit\nDocument\n(August 16)\n\neb9d34aba286471a147488ea82eec9902034f9f1cf75c4fa1c7dd40815a493d8 SHA256 ThreadKit\nDocument\n(August 16)\n\n8263e0db727be2660f66e2e692b671996c334400d83e94fc0355ec0949dce05c SHA256 CobInt\nStage 1\n(August 16)\n\nclick-alfa[.]com Host CobInt C&C\n(August 16)\n\n5d29b89e9ee14261c1b556bbc66650488b590f311173aef641e178ba735e6e0d SHA256 Exploit\nDocument\n(September\n4)\n\nhxxps://raifeisen[.]co/invoice/id/305674567 URL Download\nURL to\nCVE-20188174 VBS\n(September\n4)\n\n9c0ddfcfb8d1e64332fa7420f690e65a6c4ecbeef6395f4c7645da51098962cc SHA256 CVE-20188174 VBS\n(September\n4)\n\nactivrt[.]com Host CobInt C&C\n(September\n4)\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Signatures**\n\n2832437 || ETPRO TROJAN Observed Malicious SSL Cert (cobint Downloader)\n\n\n-----\n\n2832171 || ETPRO TROJAN Observed Malicious SSL Cert (cobint Module CnC)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
