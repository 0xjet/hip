We have\nconfirmed the key is effective at unlocking victims and will continue to provide support\nto Kaseya and its customers,\" Wosar told BleepingComputer.\n\nIt is unclear what caused the REvil ransomware operation to shut down and go into hiding,\nand multiple international law enforcement agencies have told BleepingComputer that they\nwere not involved in their disappearance.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the [attack on JBS and Kaseya, the White House s has pressured the Russian](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-revil-cybergang-behind-the-jbs-ransomware-attack/)\ngovernment to do something about the ransomware gangs believed to be operating within\nRussia.\n\nIt is believed that the Russian government told the REvil ransomware gang to shut down and\ndisappear to show that they were working with the USA.\n\nAs the decryptor was obtained after the REvil gang's disappearance, it is possible that\nRussia received it directly from the ransomware gang and shared it with US law enforcement\nas a gesture of goodwill.\n\nWhen we asked the FBI if they were involved in the procurement of the decryption key, we\nwere told that they do not comment on ongoing investigations.\n\n\"The DOJ and FBI have an ongoing criminal investigation into the criminal enterprise behind\nthe REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware variant and the actors responsible for the Kaseya\nransomware attack specifically,\" the FBI told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"Per DOJ policy, we cannot comment further on this ongoing investigation.\"\n\nREvil's disappearance is likely not the end of the gang's online activities.\n\nIn the past the [GandCrab ransomware operation shut down and rebranded as REvil, and it is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-shutting-down-after-claiming-to-earn-2-billion/)\nexpected that REvil will resurface again as a new ransomware operation.\n\n_Update 7/22/21 9:42 PM EST: Added Emsisoft and FBI statements._\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
