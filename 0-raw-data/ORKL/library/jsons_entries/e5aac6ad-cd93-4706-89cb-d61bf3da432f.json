These documents\nalso showed that Primitive Bear likely used unauthorized access or illicit purchase of\nprivate documents prior to their publication.\nThe final objective of this campaign remains unclear because the remote template\ndomains were down at the time of discovery.\n\n## Overview\n\nAnomali Threat Research identified malicious samples that align with the Russia-sponsored\ncyberespionage group Primitive Bear’s (Gamaredon, Winterflounder) tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs).[1] The group was distributing .docx files that attempted to download\n\n\n-----\n\n.dot files from remote templates. The final objective of this campaign remains unclear as the\nremote template domains were down at the time of discovery. We observed Primitive Bear\nactivity in late 2019, and again in April 2020, during which time they used similar TTPs and\nUkrainian government-themed decoys.[2] In those campaigns, Primitive Bear’s decoys\nloaded a remote template to drop a .dot file that would determine if the compromised\nmachine was worthy of a second-stage payload.[3]\n\nPrimitive Bear, known primarily to focus on Ukraine, has been very active in 2021. However,\nthe themes of the samples we found, as well as those shared by the security community,\ncould also be used to target multiple former Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR)\ncountries.\n\n## Details\n\nAnomali Threat Research found malicious .docx files being distributed by Primitive Bear,\nlikely through spearphishing, that attempted to download remote template .dot files through\ntemplate injection. Most of the .docx decoy files were written in Ukrainian, and a minority\nwritten in Russian, and contained content discussing multiple Ukrainian government\nagencies, institutions, and public entities, as well as Russian intelligence agencies in the\ncontext of occupied Crimea. Primitive Bear was using specific names of individuals and\nentities in their files, relevant to the January through mid-March 2021 timeframe, to make\ntheir malicious files appear more legitimate. This highlights the group’s use of authentic\nevents to craft likely phishing themes more likely to be effective.\n\n**_Figure 1 – Observed Infection Chain_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe .docx files distributed by Primitive Bear used template injection to add a remote domain\nthat contained a .dot (Word template) file. In Figure 2, the template injection can be seen\nwith the TargetMode set to “External,” indicating the file was reaching out to a remote\nlocation. If the connection was made, the .dot file was subsequently downloaded.\n\n**_Figure 2 – автореферат Тертична last 8.2.docx Remote Template Domain Information_**\n\nThe final objective of this campaign remains unclear because the remote template domains\nwere down at the time of discovery, and we encourage the security community to share if\ndiscovered.\n\n### Decoy Analysis\n\n**Analyzed File – автореферат Тертична last 8.2.docx**\n\n**Translated File Name – Tertychna Abstract last 8.2.docx**\n\n**SHA-256 – 9b6d89ad4e35ffca32c4f44b75c9cc5dd080fd4ce00a117999c9ad8e231d4418**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3 – автореферат Тертична last 8.2.docx (Translated from Ukrainian: Tertychna_**\n_Abstract last 8.2.docx)_\n\n**_Figure 4 – Tertychna Abstract last 8.2.docx (Translated from Ukrainian)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tertychna Abstract last 8.2.docx, shown above in Figures 3 and 4, is a 26 page abstract**\nof a Ukrainian dissertation discussing modern relations between Ukraine and Bulgaria. Most\nof the document is in Ukrainian, however, the last two and one-half pages have English\nsummaries. Tertychna Abstract last 8.2.docx appears to be a shortened version of\nanother Primitive Bear file called дисертація 8.02.21.docx (from Ukrainian: Dissertation\n8.02.21.docx), which was also mentioned by the security community, shown in Figures 5\nand 6 below.[[4]]\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5 – дисертація 8.02.21.docx (Translated from Ukrainian: Dissertation 8.02.21.docx)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6 – Dissertation 8.02.21.docx (Translated from Ukrainian, Page 1/282)_**\n\nThese two documents (автореферат Тертична last 8.2.docx and дисертація\n**8.02.21.docx) appear to be legitimate documents that were weaponized by Primitive Bear**\nfor template injection. The group likely procured them through illicit purchase or previous\ncompromise. We found the full document was published by its author, Anna, on the\nliterature repository site, chtyvo.org[.]ua.[5] The file was uploaded to the site on March 7,\n2021, but both of the analyzed file names suggested a date of February 8, 2021 (8.2.docx)\nor called it out explicitly. This indicates that Primitive Bear has used access to private\nUkrainian documents, weaponized them, and distributed them prior to the authorized\npublication of said documents.\n\n\nIn hindsight, the decision for Primitive Bear to use a Ukrainian and Bulgarian-themed\ndissertation comes at an interesting time for Russian and Bulgarian relations. This is due to\nthe Bulgarian government arresting six of its own members who were charged with spying\nfor the Russian government, on March 19, 2021, according to the Bulgarian prosecutors’\nstatement.[6] However, Russia is known for combining cyber and real-world operations, and\nhas been using this hybrid warfare to target Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since at least the\n2014 annexation of Crimea.[7] Therefore, it would not be unlikely to think that Primitive Bear\nwas using Bulgaria-themed decoys before the media knew of the events, thus making the\ninformation more relevant to Ukrainian officials who knew what was transpiring.\n\n**Analyzed File – ДОПОВІДНА ЗАПСКА.docx**\n**Translated File Name – REPORT NOTE.docx**\n**SHA-256 – 63da0b2abb744a5c92c3a1fff2c3e5940f5c969890f3f16fd8dca0a1363da494**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7 – ДОПОВІДНА ЗАПСКА.docx (from Ukrainian: REPORT NOTE.docx)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8 – REPORT NOTE.docx (Translated from Ukrainian) page 1/5_**\n\n**REPORT NOTE.docx, shown in Figures 7 and 8 above, purports to be an internal note by**\nthe Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine dated February 2021. The file includes pre-trial\ninvestigative rulesets regarding suspected terrorists. These fighters, from unrecognized\nregions of Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), have\nbeen accused of fighting against the Ukrainian government. Russia has been the de-facto\ncontroller of DPR and LPR since the regions simultaneously declared their independence\nfrom Ukraine in 2014, which makes the use of these regions ideal in decoy documents for\nPrimitive Bear.\n\nThe escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine in 2021 add incentive for mentioning\nDPR and LPR. On January 28, 2021, DPR and LPR groups presented a doctrine dubbed\n“Russian Donbass,” which stated the groups’ collective desire to rejoin Russia “in order to\nreturn to our historical roots.”[8] In the subsequent months, European monitors reported an\n\n\n-----\n\nincrease in Russian troop movement along the Ukraine-Russia border. Tensions boiled over\nin the DPR on March 30, 2021, with exchanging artillery and machine-gun fire between the\nfactions resulting in four Ukrainians killed and one wounded.[9] This was another strong\nexample of Primitive Bear samples themed around real-world conflicts before a significant\nevent occurred, a strong indication of potential hybrid warfare.\n\n**Analyzed File – incoming.docx**\n**SHA-256 – 82fe93b52ae5f12fad99fc533324cbf680f5777cc67b9f30dd2addeeee7527f8**\n\n**_Figure 9 – incoming.docx_**\n\n**_Figure 10 – incoming.docx (Translated from Russian)_**\n\nThe .docx file shown in Figures 9 and 10 above is a letter allegedly from Emil Variev, a\nneighbor of Rustem Seytmemetov, in occupied Crimea. He referenced how Russia’s\nFederal Security Service (FSB) arrested him in 2020 in relation to the Hizb ut-Tahrir\n(extremist aim to unite all Muslim countries) case. Rustem Seytmemetov is just one of three\nindividuals who were arrested in what Crimeans refer to as “the so-called third\nBakhchisaray Hizb ut-Tahrir case,” and they are expected to remain under arrest until April\n\n\n-----\n\n22, 2021.[ ] While the decoy did not state an intended recipient, the context appears\ndirected towards Ukrainian authorities. This is another example of Primitive Bear using\ndocuments to coincide with real-world events.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPrimitive Bear is motivated by cyberespionage (data theft, information gathering), and this\ncampaign demonstrates their specific targeting of regional foes with what often appears to\nbe private documents likely obtained by illicit means. We have observed Primitive Bear\nusing malicious .docx files to distribute .dot files for over a year, however, the remote\ntemplate domains used in this campaign were down at the time of discovery. Therefore, the\nfinal payload of this campaign remains unclear at the time of this writing.\n\n## MITRE TTPs\n\nMasquerading - T1036\nPhishing - T1566\nSpearphishing Attachment - T1566.001\nTemplate Injection - T1221\nUser Execution - T1204\nUser Execution: Malicious File - T1204.002\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1] Anomali Threat Research, “Gamaredon TTPs Target Ukraine,” Anomali White Papers,\n\naccessed April 5, 2021, published December 5, 2019, https://www.anomali.com/files/whitepapers/Anomali_Threat_Research-Gamaredon_TTPs_Target_Ukraine-WP.pdf, 1-2.\n\n\n\n[2] Ibid., 9-11; Gage Mele and Parthiban Rajendran, “Gamaredon Spearphishing Campaign,”\n\naccessed April 5 2021, published April 20, 2020,\nhttps://ui.threatstream.com/campaign/61380.\n\n[3] Anomali Threat Research, “Gamaredon TTPs Target Ukraine,” Anomali White Papers, 6.\n\n\n\n[4] “#Gamaredon #APT mal doc:,” @h2jazi,\n\nhttps://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1371445133560983552.\n\n[5] Anna Tertychna, “PUBLIC DIPLOMACY IN UKRAINIAN-BULGARIAN RELATIONS\n\n(1991-2018),” CHTIVO Electronic Library, accessed April 6, 2021, published March 7, 2021,\nhttps://shron1.chtyvo.org.ua/Tertychna_Anna/Publichna_dyplomatiia_v_ukrainskobolharskykh_vidnosynakh_19912018.pdf?.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ ] Bulgarian PM tells Russia to stop spying after intelligence ring charges, Reuters,\n\naccessed April 7, 2021, published March 20, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/article/usbulgaria-russia-espionage/bulgarian-pm-tells-russia-to-stop-spying-after-intelligence-ringcharges-idUSKBN2BC0MR; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-russiaespionage/bulgaria-charges-six-people-over-alleged-russian-spy-ring-idUSKBN2BB1V4.\n\n[7] Ibid; Dave Lee, “Russia and Ukraine in cyber ‘stand-off’,” BBC News, accessed April 7,\n\n2021, published March 5, 2014, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26447200; Laurens\nCerulus, “How Ukraine became a test bed for cyberweaponry,” Politico, accessed April 7,\npublished February 14, 2019, https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontlinerussia-malware-attacks/; Andy Greenberg, How an Entire Nation Became Russia’s Test Lab\nfor Cyberwar,” Wired, accessed April 7, 2021, published June 6, 2017,\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/; David J.
