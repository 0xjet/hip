(See full report here [PDF][[2]]).\n\nEquationDrug, which is still in use, dates back to 2003, although the more modern GrayFish platform is\nbeing pushed to new victims.\n\n_EquationDrug represents the main espionage platform from the #EquationAPT Group_\n\n_Tweet[[3]]_\n\nIt's important to note that EquationDrug is not just a Trojan, but a full espionage platform, which includes\na framework for conducting cyberespionage activities by deploying speci�c modules on the machines of\n\nselected victims. The concept of a cyberespionage platform is neither new nor unique. Other threat actors\n\nknown to use such sophisticated platforms include Regin[[4]] and Epic Turla[[5]].\n\nThe EquationDrug platform can be extended through plugins (or modules). It is pre-built with a default\n\nset of plugins supporting a number of basic cyberespionage functions. These include common features\nsuch as �le collection and the making of screenshots. Sophistication is added by storing stolen data inside\n\na custom-encrypted virtual �le system before it is sent to the command and control servers.\n\nThe name \"EquationDrug\" or \"Equestre\" was assigned to this framework by Kaspersky Lab researchers.\n\nThe only reference left by the framework developers was a short string \"UR\", as seen in several string\nartifacts left in the binaries.\n\n## Platform Architecture\n\nThe EquationDrug platform includes dozens of executables, con�gurations and protected storage\nlocations. Putting all the pieces of this puzzle together in the right order may take time for those who are\n\nnot familiar with the platform.\n\n_The platform includes executables, con�gurations and protected storage locations #EquationAPT_\n\n_Tweet[[6]]_\n\n\n1 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\nThe architecture of the whole framework resembles a mini-operating system with kernel-mode and\nuser-mode components carefully interacting with each other via a custom message-passing interface. The\n\nplatform includes a set of drivers, a platform core (orchestrator) and a number of plugins. Every plugin has\n\na unique ID and version number that de�nes a set of functions it can provide. Some of the plugins depend\n\non others and might not work unless dependencies are resolved.\n\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n\n2 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n3 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n4 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\nTo install: run with no arguments\nAttempting to drop\n\n**SFCriteria_Check failed!**\n\n**SFDriver**\n\nError detected!

Due to the limited number of such text strings\n\nit's hard to tell reliably if the developers were native English speakers.\n\n## Link Timestamp Analysis\n\nWe have gathered a reasonably large number of executable samples to which we have been able to apply\nlink timestamp analysis.\n\nA link timestamp is a 4-bytes value stored in an executable �le header. This value is automatically set by\n\ncompiler software when a developer builds a new executable. The value contains a detailed timestamp\nincluding minutes and even seconds of compilation time (think of it as the �le's moment of birth).\n\n[13]\n\nLink timestamp analysis require the collection of the timestamps of all available executables, grouping\n\nthem according to certain criteria, such as the hour or day of the week, and putting them on a chart. Below\nare some charts built using this approach.\n\n[14]\n\n\n5 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\nCan we trust this information? The answer is: not fully, because the link timestamp can be altered by the\n\ndeveloper in a way that's not always possible to spot. However, certain indicators such as matching the\nyear on the timestamp with the support of technology popular in that year leads us to believe that the\n\ntimestamps were, at the very least, not wholly replaced. Looking at this from the other side, the easiest\noption for the developer is to wipe the timestamp completely, replacing it with zeroes. This was not found\n\nin the case of EquationDrug. In fact, the timestamps look very realistic and match the working days and\n\nhours of a well-organized software developer from timezone UTC-3 or UTC-4, if you assume that they\n\ncome to work at 8 or 9 am.\n\n_The timestamps match the working days of software developer from timezone UTC-3 or UTC-4_\n_#EquationAPT_\n\n_Tweet[[17]]_\n\n\n6 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd �nally, in case you are wondering if the developers work on public holidays, you can check this for\nyourself against the full list of their working dates:\n\n2001.08.17 2007.12.11 2009.04.16 2011.10.20 2012.08.31 2013.06.11\n\n2001.08.23 2007.12.17 2009.06.05 2011.10.26 2012.09.28 2013.06.26\n\n2003.08.16 2008.01.01 2009.12.15 2012.03.06 2012.10.23 2013.08.09\n\n2003.08.17 2008.01.23 2010.01.22 2012.03.22 2012.11.02 2013.08.28\n\n2005.03.16 2008.01.24 2010.02.19 2012.04.03 2012.11.06 2013.10.16\n\n2005.09.08 2008.01.29 2010.02.22 2012.04.04 2013.01.08 2013.11.04\n\n2006.06.15 2008.01.30 2010.03.27 2012.04.05 2013.02.07 2013.11.26\n\n2006.09.18 2008.04.24 2010.06.15 2012.04.12 2013.02.21 2013.12.04\n\n2006.10.04 2008.05.07 2011.02.09 2012.07.02 2013.02.22 2013.12.05\n\n2006.10.16 2008.05.09 2011.02.23 2012.07.09 2013.02.27 2013.12.13\n\n2007.07.12 2008.06.17 2011.08.08 2012.07.17 2013.04.16\n\n2007.10.02 2008.09.17 2011.08.30 2012.08.02 2013.05.08\n\n2007.10.16 2008.09.24 2011.09.02 2012.08.03 2013.05.14\n\n2007.12.10 2008.12.05 2011.10.04 2012.08.14 2013.05.24\n\n## Conclusions\n\nEquationDrug represents the main espionage platform from the Equation Group. It's been in use for over\n10 years, replacing EquationLaser until it was replaced itself by the even more sophisticated GrayFish\n\nplatform.\n\n_The EquationDrug case demonstrates an interesting trend: a growth in code sophistication_\n_#EquationAPT_\n\n_Tweet[[18]]_\n\nThe EquationDrug case demonstrates an interesting trend that we have been seeing while analyzing\n\nsupposedly nation-state cyberattack tools: a growth in code sophistication. It is clear that nation-state\nattackers are looking for better stability, invisibility, reliability and universality in their cyberespionage\n\ntools. You can make a basic browser password-stealer or a sniffer within days. However, nation-states are\n\nfocused on creating frameworks for wrapping such code into something that can be customized on live\n\nsystems and provide a reliable way to store all components and data in encrypted form, inaccessible to\n\nnormal users. While traditional cybercriminals mass-distribute emails with malicious attachments or\ninfect websites on a large scale, nation-states create automatic systems infecting only selected users.\n\nWhile traditional cybercriminals typically reuse one malicious �le for all victims, nation-states prepare\n\nmalware unique to each victim and even implement restrictions preventing decryption and execution\n\n\n7 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\noutside of the target computer.\n\n_Nation-state attackers create automatic systems infecting only selected users #EquationAPT_\n\n_Tweet[[19]]_\n\nSophistication of the framework is what makes this type of actor different from traditional cybercriminals,\nwho prefer to focus on payload and malware capabilities such as implementing a long list of custom\n\nthird-party software credential database parsers.\n\nThe difference in tactics between cybercriminals and nation-state attackers appears to be due to relative\nresource availability. It's known that cybercriminals attempt to infect as many users as possible and that\n\nthey can sometimes compromise hundreds of thousands of systems. It would will take many years to\n\ncheck all those machines manually, analyzing who owns them, what data is stored on them, and what\n\ncustom software they run.\n\nCybercriminals probably don't even have enough disk space to collect all the potentially interesting data\n\nfrom the victims hit by their large scale infections. That is why cybercriminals prefer to extract tiny\nchunks of the most important data (credentials, credit card numbers, etc) on the machine of the victim\n\nand transfer only few kilobytes from each compromised host. Such data, when combined from all users,\nnormally takes up gigabytes of disk space.\n\nNation-state attackers have suf�cient resources to store as much data as they want. They have access to\n\nvirtually unlimited data storage. However, they don't need, and often try to avoid, infecting random users,\nfor the obvious reason of avoiding attention and remaining invisible. Implementing custom data format\n\nparsers in the malware not only doesn't help them �nd all the valuable data on the victim's machine, but\nmay also attract extra attention from security software running on the system. They mostly prefer to have\n\na generic remote system management tool that can copy any information they might need even if it\ncauses some redundancy. However, copying large volumes of information might slow down network\n\nconnection and attract attention, especially in some countries with poorly developed internet\ninfrastructure. To date, nation-state attackers have had to balance between these two poles: copying\n\nvictims' entire hard drives while stealing only tiny bits of passwords and keys.\n\n_Nation-state attackers use a remote system management tool that can copy any information they need_\n_#EquationAPT_\n\n_Tweet[[20]]_\n\nNow, if you wonder why EquationDrug, a powerful cyberespionage platform, doesn't provide all stealing\n\ncapability as standard in its malware core, the answer is that they prefer to customize the attack for each\n\none of their victims. Only if they have chosen to actively monitor you and the security products on your\nmachines have been disarmed, will you receive a plugin for the live tracking of your conversations or other\nspeci�c functions related to your activities. We believe modularity and customization will become a\n\nunique trademark of nation-state attackers in the future.\n\n\n8 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\nSome code paths in EquationDrug modules lead to OS version checks including a test for Windows 95,\nwhich is accepted as one of supported platforms. While some other checks will not pass on Windows 95,\n\nthe presence of this code means that this OS was supported in some earlier variants of the malware.\n\nConsidering this and the existence of components designed to run on Windows 9x (such as VXD-�les), as\n\nwell as compilation timestamps dating back to early 2000s, the hypothesis that these attackers have been\nactive since the 90s seems realistic. This makes the current attacker an outstanding actor operating longer\n\nthan any other in the �eld.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n Kernel mode stage 0 (Windows 9x) - mssvc32.vxd\n\n**MD5** 0a5e9b15014733ee7685d8c8be81fb0d\n\n**Size** 6 710 bytes\n\n**Format Linear Executable (LE)**\n\nThis VXD driver handles only two control messages: W32_DeviceIoControl and Dynamic_Init. The\n\nDeviceIoControl part is not completely implemented and the driver is only able to check for some known\ncontrol codes. However it does nothing. This handler looks more like a code stub rather than actual\n\npayload.\n\nOn the Dynamic_Init event, the driver retrieves the location of the user-mode loader executable from the\nfollowing registry value:\n\n_[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] Con�g_\n\nIf the value is not present in the registry, it uses the following fallback string hardcoded in the binary:\n\n**C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM\\SVCHOST32.EXE**\n\nNext, it installs a callback procedure using Windows function _SHELL_CallAtAppyTime. This procedure\n\nwill be called when CPU is running in ring-3 mode, so that a new executable (loader process) can be\n\nstarted via the traditional way. This is a standard trick that was used by developers in the 90s to initiate a\n\ncall to DLL export in ring-3 from ring-0 in Windows 9x OS family.\n\n## Kernel mode stage 0 and rootkit (Windows 2000 and above) - msndsrv.sys\n\n**MD5** c4f8671c1f00dab30f5f88d684af1927\n\n**Size** 105 392 bytes\n\n\n9 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n10 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n11 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n12 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n13 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\ncon�guration block. However, data from the next location can override all previous settings. This is a\nregistry value with special name.\n\nThe naming of the registry location is the same GUID-like SHA1 value as the one used in the loader\n\n(\"mscfg32.exe\"), and is produced from the source string \"Con�guration\":\n\n_[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] {42E14DD3-_\n\n_F07A-78F1-7659-26AE141569AC-E0B3EE89}_\n\nThe con�guration block stored in the registry value is encrypted using RC5 with the 1024-bit key. Both the\n\nloader and the orchestrator share the same key for encrypting and decrypting the registry values in the\n\n\"MemSubSys\" key.\n\nThe decrypted con�guration block consists of a series of tagged con�guration records in the following\n\nformat:\n\n**[RecordType:DWORD][RecordSize: DWORD][RecordValue: %RecordSize%]**\n\nWe retrieved a copy of a con�guration block and decrypted and partly interpreted it. We are including the\n\nresults for one of the con�guration blocks:\n\n**Time value: 1 year 0 months 1 days 22 hours 6 mins 52 secs.

According to the code, they are initialized with\nvalues of the Microsoft �letime format. So, we decided to interpret them as �letime values:\n\n20101C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 7 month(s) 21 day(s) 23 hour(s) 32 min(s) 1 sec(s)\n\n81E01C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 7 month(s) 8 day(s) 12 hour(s) 13 min(s) 5 sec(s)\nE0001C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 7 month(s) 21 day(s) 1 hour(s) 6 min(s) 15 sec(s)\n\n77101C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 5 month(s) 20 day(s) 19 hour(s) 15 min(s) 4 sec(s)\n\n30F01C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 8 month(s) 0 day(s) 6 hour(s) 10 min(s) 33 sec(s)\n\nC0901C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 8 month(s) 2 day(s) 6 hour(s) 29 min(s) 39 sec(s)\n66701C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 6 month(s) 9 day(s) 2 hour(s) 10 min(s) 23 sec(s)\n\nF6501C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 6 month(s) 6 day(s) 19 hour(s) 53 min(s) 22 sec(s)\n\n01401C04EC2C17B: 1 year(s) 6 month(s) 25 day(s) 23 hour(s) 34 min(s) 13 sec(s)\n\nAfter that, the module stores current time values in encrypted form in the registry value:\n\n_[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] {08DAB849-0E1E-_\n_A1F0-DCF1-457081E091DB-117DB663} (encoded SHA1 of \"StartTime\")_\n\nThe module contains an additional compressed Windows DLL �le in the resource section, which is\n\nextracted as \"unilay.dll\" (see below). This DLL exports a number of functions that are just wrappers of the\nsystem API used to work with �les and the registry, and also start processes and load additional DLL �les.\n\nThe orchestrator contains several built-in plugins that form the core of the platform. These are initialized\n\nin the �rst place, and then additional plugins are loaded. All the plugins are indexed in a single encrypted\nregistry value:\n\n_[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] 1_\n\nThis value has information about all the components of the current kit. It may include Unicode strings\n\nwith paths to extra DLLs which serve as plugins. Each DLL exports at least four functions which are\nimported by ordinal numbers from 1 to 4.\n\nThe structure of the registry value \"1\":\n\n**[Count:DWORD]{ [Plugin Id:WORD][Plugin Path Length:DWORD][Plugin Path String:VARIABLE] }**\n\nPlugins interact with each other and with the orchestrator by exchanging messages of pre-de�ned format.\n\nThe message transport is implemented as a global object that contains four communication streams.\nEvery stream contains a pair of kernel synchronization object handles (a semaphore with �xed maximum\n\nvalue defaulted to 1000 and a mutex) and a message queue as an array. A dedicated thread processes\n\nmessages that appear in the message queues.\n\nA message arrives in a parcel, represented as two DWORD values that contain the size of the message and\n\na pointer to the message data.

By\ndefault the driver starts in \"sniffer mode\".\n\n### Sniffer mode\n\nThe sniffer code is similar to the one used in the driver's \"tdip.sys\" and \"mstcp32.sys\" and uses NT4\nNDIS-4, XP NDIS-5 interfaces, targeting incoming traf�c on Ethernet and VPN (ndiswanip) interfaces. It\n\ncaptures only directed packets (containing a destination address equal to the station address of the NIC).\n\nPackers-�ltering engine rules may be set via DeviceIoControl messages. Filtered packets are stored\n\nin-memory until requested. Maximum packets storage list length is 128 items per �ltering rule.\n\n### Patcher mode\n\nAlmost broken, it does nothing interesting except, possibly, replace the thread's ServiceTable to an\n\nunchanged, clear copy taken from the on-disk image of \"ntoskrnl.exe\".\n\n**Sniffer only IOCTLs:**\n44038004 - add �ltering rule\n\n44038008 - clear stored packet in speci�ed �ltering rules list\n4403800C - enable speci�ed �ltering rule\n\n44038010 - disable speci�ed �ltering rule\n44038014 - get stored packet from speci�ed �ltering rules list\n\n44038018 - process packet like the one received from the wire (�lter and store)\n4403801C - set maximum rules list length\n\n44038020 - get maximum rules list length\n\n80000004 - enablePacketsFiltering\n\n80000008 - disablePacketsFiltering (PauseSniffer)\n\n800024B4 - send packet to the speci�ed network interface\n\n**Common IOCTLs:**\n\n80000028 - do nothing (broken/unused part)\n80000038 - set external object (broken/unused part)\n\n8000003C - get 4 dwords struct (broken/unused part)\n\n80000040 - copy 260 bytes from the request (broken/unused part)\n\n80000320 - set I/O port mapping (broken/unused part)\n\n80000324 - clear I/O port mapping (broken/unused part)\n80000328 - set external PnP Event (broken/unused part)\n\n80000640 - replace speci�ed thread's SDT (ETHREAD.ServiceTable �eld) to a given copy\n\n\n20 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n21 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n22 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\nAll incoming packets are �rst �ltered by BPF-like rules. The �ltering rules are located in [HKLM\\System\n_\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\%driver name%] Options registry value or passed via corresponding IOCTL._\n\nPackets that passed through the �lter are added in the end of processing queue.\n\nPackets from the queue must have valid checksum values. After checking that, the code XOR-decrypts\nadditional data from the end of the packet. The decrypted end of the packet contains another control\n\nstructure that de�nes which encryption algorithm is used to decipher packet body. Supported algorithms\n\ninclude RC5 and RSA. There is a 1024-bits RSA public key hardcoded inside the module body, while a\n\n96-bits RC5 key is generated dynamically.\n\nThe backdoor command may arrive in a single packet or be split into pieces and come with several\n\npackets. There is a procedure for re-assembling pieces together: a multi-packet command is added to a\n\nspecial packet collector which puts all the pieces together before passing it further.\n\n**Backdoor command is stored in the �rst byte of the decrypted request and can be one of the following**\n\nvalues:\n\n\n**Command**\n\n**Byte**\n\n\n**Short Name** **Description**\n\n\n0 StatusCheck Reply with encrypted DriverName, packet collector keys, \"Processes\"\nand \"Params\" registry values, names of processes for code injection\n\n(defaults are \"services.exe\" and \"winlogon.exe\"), list of unprocessed\ncommands from packet collector.\n\n1 Panic Disable packet �ltering, securely delete driver �le, clear related\nregistry keys, set ClearPageFileAtShutdown �ag, unbind adapters,\n\ndelete devices and prepare for unloading. However, the driver cannot\nunload itself and it remains in the memory until reboot, which means\n\nit can be detected via DRIVER_OBJECT structure.\n\n2 CodeInject Injects code implant received from packet body.\n\n3 CallWinExec Disable Windows Audit and start new process via standard code\n\ninjection in Winlogon.exe.\n\n4 ResetCollector Drop all packets with speci�c key from packet collector.\n\n5 Unused or disabled\n\n6 GenerateRC5Key Generates RC5 session key. 96-bits RC5 key is generated by taking a\nSHA1 hash of value from KeTickCount, XOR-encrypt with SHA1 hash\n\nof two PerformanceFrequency values, which is followed by nine more\n\nadditional SHA1 hashing.\n\n7 SetRegProcesses Sets new \"Processes\" registry value.\n\n8 DeleteRegProcesses Deletes current \"Processes\" registry value.\n\n9 SetRegParams Sets a universal \"Params\" registry value which is used for storing any\n\ninformation, i.e. could be a unique victim marker or exploitation stage\n\n\n23 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n24 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n25 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n26 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n27 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n28 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n**Description** This (80AA) plugin is a HDD �rmware �ashing tool which includes an API and the\n\nability to read/write arbitrary information into hidden sectors on the disk.\nThe plugin will be the subject of a separate blogpost.\n\n1. http://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/\n\n2. https://securelist.com/�les/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf\n\n\n3.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&\n\ntext=EquationDrug+represents+the+main+espionage+platform+from+the+%23EquationAPT+Group\n\n\n4. http://securelist.com/blog/research/67741/regin-nation-state-ownage-of-gsm-networks/\n\n5. http://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/\n\n\n6.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&\n\ntext=The+platform+includes+executables%2C+con�gurations+and+protected+storage+locations+%23EquationAPT\n\n\n7. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_1.jpg\n\n8. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_1.jpg\n\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&\n\ntext=The+hypothesis+that+these+attackers+have+been+active+since+the+90s+seems+realistic+%23EquationAPT\n\nhttps://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&text=86+modules+have+yet+to+be+discovered+%23EquationAPT\n\n\n11. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_2.jpg\n\n12. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_2.jpg\n\n13. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_3.jpg\n\n14. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_4.jpg\n\n15. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_4.jpg\n\n16. http://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2015/03/EquationDrug_5_1.jpg\n\n17. https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&\n\ntext=The+timestamps+match+the+working+days+of+software+developer+from+timezone+UTC-3+or+UTC\n4+%23EquationAPT\n\n\n18.\n\n19.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&\n\ntext=The+EquationDrug+case+demonstrates+an+interesting+trend%3A+a+growth+in+code+sophistication+%23EquationAPT\n\nhttps://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&text=Nation\nstate+attackers+create+automatic+systems+infecting+only+selected+users+%23EquationAPT\n\n\n20. https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F69203%2Finside\n\n29 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----\n\nthe-equationdrug-espionage-platform%2F&text=Nation\nstate+attackers+use+a+remote+system+management+tool+that+can+copy+any+information+they+need+%23EquationAPT\n\n21. http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/mstcp32-t1445152.html\n\n\n30 f 30 03/22/2015 10 21 PM\n\n\n-----",
