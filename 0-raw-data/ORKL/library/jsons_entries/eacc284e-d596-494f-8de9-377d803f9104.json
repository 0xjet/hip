The compromise\naffected governments and businesses worldwide, including in EU Member States. We share\nthe concerns of our partners about the increasing number of malicious cyber activities, and\nare in particular alarmed by the recent increase in activities affecting the security and\nintegrity of information and communication technology (ICT) products and services, which\nmight have systemic effects and cause significant harm to our society, security and economy.\n\nMalicious use of ICTs undermines the benefits that the Internet and the use of ICTs provide\nto society at large, and shows the readiness of some actors to effectively risk international\nsecurity and stability.\n\nAll actors must refrain from irresponsible and destabilising behaviour in cyberspace. We will\ncontinue to investigate malicious cyber activities with a view to sustained, joint and\ncoordinated action to prevent, discourage, deter and respond to such malicious behaviour in\ncyberspace, including by closely working with our international partners. We call upon all\nStates to facilitate and play a constructive role in ongoing investigations, and to take\nappropriate action to promote the security and integrity of ICT products and services and\ntheir supply chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe European Union and its Member States continue working towards the establishment of a\nProgramme of Action to Advance Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace within the\nUnited Nations, building on the work of the UN Groups of Governmental Experts in this field,\nand the recent endorsement of this framework by the Open-ended Working Group.\n\nThe European Union and its Member States remain strongly committed and determined in\ntheir solidarity with their international partners in promoting a global, open, stable and secure\ncyberspace respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values and\nprinciples and the rule of law, in order for everyone to safely live their lives online, as well as\noffline.\n\nThe Candidate Countries Turkey, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and\nAlbania and the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the1\nEuropean Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and Georgia align themselves with this\ndeclaration.\n\n\n1 The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the\n\nStabilisation and Association Process.\n\n## Press contacts\n\n**[Nabila Massrali](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#127c73707b7e733c7f73616160737e7b5277713c7767607d62733c7767)**\nSpokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\n\n+32 2 29 88093\n\n+32 460 79 52 44\n\nIf you are not a journalist, please [send your request to the public information service.](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/contact/general-enquiries/)\n\n\n-----",
