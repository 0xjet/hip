Its main payload is the widespread RedLine stealer. Discovered in\nMarch 2020, RedLine is currently one of the most common Trojans used to steal passwords\nand credentials from browsers, FTP clients and desktop messengers. It is openly available\non underground hacker forums for just a few hundred dollars, a relatively small price tag for\nmalware.\n\nThe stealer can pinch usernames, passwords, cookies, bank card details and autofill data\nfrom Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, data from cryptowallets, instant messengers\nand FTP/SSH/VPN clients, as well as files with particular extensions from devices. In\n\n\n-----\n\naddition, RedLine can download and run third-party programs, execute commands in\ncmd.exe and open links in the default browser. The stealer spreads in various ways,\nincluding through malicious spam e-mails and third-party loaders.\n\n## The bundle: what’s inside beside RedLine\n\nIn addition to the payload itself, the discovered bundle is of note for its self-propagation\nfunctionality. Several files are responsible for this, which receive videos, and post them to the\ninfected users’ YouTube channels along with the links to a password-protected archive with\nthe bundle in the description. The videos advertise cheats and cracks and provide\ninstructions on hacking popular games and software. Among the games mentioned are APB\nReloaded, CrossFire, DayZ, Dying Light 2, F1® 22, Farming Simulator, Farthest Frontier,\nFIFA 22, Final Fantasy XIV, Forza, Lego Star Wars, Osu!, Point Blank, Project Zomboid,\nRust, Sniper Elite, Spider-Man, Stray, Thymesia, VRChat and Walken. According to Google,\nthe hacked channels were quickly terminated for violation of the company’s Community\nGuidelines.\n\n**_Examples of videos spreading the bundle_**\n\nThe original bundle is a self-extracting RAR archive containing a number of malicious files,\nclean utilities and a script to automatically run the unpacked contents. Because of the\nexpletives used by the bundle’s creators, we had to hide some file names.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Contents of the self-extracting archive_**\n\nRight after unpacking, three executable files are run: cool.exe, ***.exe and AutoRun.exe. The\nfirst is the RedLine stealer mentioned above. The second is a miner, which makes sense,\nsince the main target audience, judging by the video, is gamers — who are likely to have\nvideo cards installed that can be used for mining. The third executable file copies itself to the\n_%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup directory, which ensures_\nautomatic startup and runs the first of the batch files.\n\nThe batch files, in turn, run three other malicious files: MakiseKurisu.exe, download.exe and\n_upload.exe. These are the files responsible for the bundle’s self-distribution. On top of that,_\none of the batch files runs the nir.exe utility, which lets malicious executable files run without\ndisplaying any windows or taskbar icons.\n\n**_Contents of the first and second batch files_**\n\nThe size of the download.exe file is an impressive 35 MB. However, it’s basically a regular\nloader whose purpose is to download videos for uploading to YouTube, as well as files with\nthe description text and links to the malicious archive. The executable file is large because it\nis a NodeJS interpreter glued together with the scripts and dependencies of the main\napplication. The malware takes the file download links from a GitHub repository. In the latest\nmodifications, a 7-Zip archive with videos and descriptions organized into directories is\ndownloaded. The archive is unpacked using the console version of 7-Zip, included in the\nbundle.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Contents of the 7-Zip archive_**\n\n_MakiseKurisu.exe is a password stealer written in C# and modified to suit the needs of the_\nbundle’s creators. The source code from GitHub was likely taken as the basis: the file\ncontains many standard stealer features that are not used in any way. These include\nchecking for a debugger and for a virtual environment, sending information about the\ninfected system to instant messengers, and stealing passwords.\n\nSo, what remains and what do the changes amount to? The only working function in\n_MakiseKurisu.exe is extracting cookies from browsers and storing them in a separate file_\nwithout sending the stolen data anywhere. It is precisely through cookies that the bundle\ngains access to the infected user’s YouTube account, where it uploads the video.\n\nThe last malicious file in the bundle is upload.exe, which uploads the video previously\ndownloaded using download.exe, to YouTube. This file is also written in NodeJS. It uses the\n_Puppeteer Node library, which provides a high-level API for managing Chrome and Microsoft_\nEdge using the DevTools protocol. When the video is successfully uploaded to YouTube,\n_upload.exe sends a message to Discord with a link to the uploaded video._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Code for video uploading_**\n\n**_Code for sending notification to Discord_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCybercriminals actively hunt for gaming accounts and gaming computer resources. As we\n[noted in our overview of gaming-related cyberthreats, stealer-type malware is often](https://securelist.com/gaming-related-cyberthreats-2021-2022/107346/)\ndistributed under the guise of game hacks, cheats and cracks. The self-spreading bundle\nwith RedLine is a prime example of this: cybercriminals lure victims with ads for cracks and\ncheats, as well as instructions on how to hack games. At the same time, the self-propagation\nfunctionality is implemented using relatively unsophisticated software, such as a customized\nopen-source stealer. All this is further proof, if any were needed, that illegal software should\nbe treated with extreme caution.\n\n## IoC\n\n**MD5 hashes**\n\n[32dd96906f3e0655768ea09d11ea6150](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/32dd96906f3e0655768ea09d11ea6150/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[1d59f656530b2d362f5d540122fb2d03](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/1d59f656530b2d362f5d540122fb2d03/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[6ebe294142d34c0f066e070560a335fb](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/6ebe294142d34c0f066e070560a335fb/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[64b4d93889661f2ff417462e95007fb4](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/64b4d93889661f2ff417462e95007fb4/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[b53ea3c1d42b72b9c2622488c5fa82ed](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/b53ea3c1d42b72b9c2622488c5fa82ed/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[ac56f398a5ad9fb662d8b04b61a1e4c5](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/ac56f398a5ad9fb662d8b04b61a1e4c5/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[f80abd7cfb638f6c69802e7ac4dcf631](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/f80abd7cfb638f6c69802e7ac4dcf631/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n[e59e63cdaec7957e68c85a754c69e109](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/e59e63cdaec7957e68c85a754c69e109/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[9194c2946e047b1e5cb4865a29d783f4](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/9194c2946e047b1e5cb4865a29d783f4/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[f9d443ad6937724fbd0ca507bb5d1076](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/f9d443ad6937724fbd0ca507bb5d1076/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[7cd4f824f61a3a05abb3aac40f8417d4](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/7cd4f824f61a3a05abb3aac40f8417d4/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Links to archives with the original bundle**\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/2022-July-07-27](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2F2022-July-07-27/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/DayZ-Eazy-Menu-06-24](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FDayZ-Eazy-Menu-06-24/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Cossfire-cheat-06-24](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FCossfire-cheat-06-24/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/APB-Reloaded-hack-05-29](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FAPB-Reloaded-hack-05-29/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Forza-Horizon-5-Hack-Menu-07-13](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FForza-Horizon-5-Hack-Menu-07-13/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Point-Blank-Cheat-05-29](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FPoint-Blank-Cheat-05-29/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Project-Zomboid-Private-Cheat-06-26](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FProject-Zomboid-Private-Cheat-06-26/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://telegra[.]ph/VRChat-Cheat-04-24](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Ftelegra.ph%2FVRChat-Cheat-04-24/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Links to GitHub**\n\n[hxxps://github[.]com/AbdulYaDada/fdgkjhfdguoerldifgj](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAbdulYaDada%2Ffdgkjhfdguoerldifgj/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[hxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/AbdulYaDada/fdgkjhfdguoerldifgj/](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAbdulYaDada%2Ffdgkjhfdguoerldifgj/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**RedLine C2**\n[45.150.108[.]67:80](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/45.150.108.67/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/malware/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Miner](https://securelist.com/tag/miner/)\n[Online Games](https://securelist.com/tag/online-games/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n[Trojan-stealer](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-stealer/)\n[YouTube](https://securelist.com/tag/youtube/)\n\nAuthors\n\nOleg Kupreev\n\nSelf-spreading stealer attacks gamers via YouTube\n\nYour email address will not be published.
