Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk](https://citizenlab.ca/)\nSchool of Global Affairs & Public Policy at the University of Toronto.\n\n## Summary\n\nAmnesty International and the Citizen Lab have uncovered a coordinated spyware campaign targeting at least nine human rights\ndefenders (HRDs) in India. Eight of the nine HRDs have been calling for the release of other prominent activists, popularly known as the\nBhima Koregaon 11, most of whom have been imprisoned in Maharashtra, India since 2018.\n\nBetween January and October 2019, the HRDs were targeted with emails containing malicious links. If these links were clicked, a form\nof commercially-manufactured Windows spyware would have been deployed, compromising the target’s Windows computers, in order\nto monitor their actions and communications. This is a violation of their rights to freedom of expression and privacy.\n\nAt least three of the nine HRDs were also targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware in 2019.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAmnesty International and the Citizen Lab have uncovered a coordinated spyware campaign targeting at least nine human rights defenders\n(HRDs) in India. These targets include activists, lawyers, academics, and journalists.\n\nBetween January and October 2019, each of the targets were sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links that, if opened, would\nhave installed NetWire, a commercially available spyware. A spearphishing attack is a targeted attempt to install a spyware (a malicious\nsoftware) on the victim’s computer or smartphone. Spearphishing is generally performed by sending very carefully crafted and personalized\nemails to the target, often impersonating colleagues or loved ones.\n\n[While NetWire is known to be used in cybercrime and](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-netwire-rat-variant-spread-by-phishing) [corporate](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html) [espionage, Amnesty International and the Citizen Lab believe that in this](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)\ncase it was used to target the HRDs because of their human rights work.\n\nSurveillance of people based solely on their human rights work amounts to an arbitrary and unlawful attack on their privacy and violates their\nright to freedom of expression and other rights that are enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is\na state party.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Context\n\nThe targeted HRDs have been openly speaking out about human rights violations in the country. Recently, eight called for the release of 11\nprominent activists arrested two years ago in relation to the protests and violence at Bhima Koregaon in Maharashtra, a state in south-west\nIndia. One of the targets is not directly linked to this case, but has been vocal in calling for the release of GN Saibaba, a disabled academic\njailed in Maharashtra.\n\n**The Bhima Koregaon Case**\n\nOn 31 December 2017, activists organized a public event in Bhima Koregaon, Maharashtra. The following day, violence erupted between\n[Dalits and Hindu nationalists. Police claim that activists at the event allegedly instigated the violence through inflammatory speeches.The](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/what-happened-at-bhima-koregaon-1326175-2018-08-29)\npolice allegedly found evidence of other criminal activities as well. In 2018, the Maharashtra Police arrested nine activists including Sudha\nBharadwaj, Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Arun Ferreira, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Vernon Gonsalves and Varavara\nRao. The subsequent charge sheets filed by the police accuse the HRDs of terror-related activities. In February 2020, the National\nInvestigation Agency (NIA) took over the case from the Maharashtra police after the newly-elected Maharashtra Government raised doubts\nabout the police investigation and signalled a probe against the officials. In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India denied anticipatory bail\napplications of two other activists, Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde, who were also charged in the same case. They were both\narrested on 14 April 2020. The case relies almost entirely on digital evidence obtained from the arrested activists’ devices. In a breach of\n[due process, some materials found on their devices were also released to the media in an effort to smear the activists.](https://www.firstpost.com/india/bhima-koregaon-arrests-police-releases-letters-linked-to-activists-claims-evidence-proves-maoist-connection-5089971.html)\n\nThe arrest of the eleven HRDs is an egregious example of how Indian authorities are clamping down on dissent and activism. These activists\nhave been charged under various penal provisions and the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law that\nviolates several international human rights standards and circumvents fair trial guarantees. It is also routinely used to intimidate HRDs,\njournalists, activists and students through arbitrary arrests and prolonged detention. These 11 activists are currently imprisoned and rights\n[groups, including Amnesty International India, have demanded their release.](https://amnesty.org.in/take-action/urgent-demand-the-release-of-the-bhima-koregaon-9-now/)\n\nThe attempts at unlawful surveillance outlined in this blog are not the first time that activists and HRDs have been targeted with malware in\nIndia. In October 2019, Facebook’s WhatsApp [revealed that NSO Group, a surveillance tool vendor, had exploited a zero-day vulnerability on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whatsapp-complaint-against-nso-group/abc0fb24-8090-447f-8493-1e05b2fc1156/)\ntheir platform to target 1400 individuals earlier in the year. A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw in software which is unknown to the\nvendor or developer. In collaboration with Citizen Lab, WhatsApp [revealed that more than 100 of those targeted were HRDs, activists,](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/)\n[journalists, across numerous countries and notified them of the breach. Subsequent reports revealed that at least 22 of the 100 were](https://scroll.in/latest/942218/nagpur-lawyer-notified-by-whatsapp-of-surveillance-says-bhima-koregaon-accused-were-also-targetted)\nactivists, lawyers, and scholars, including many HRDs who have been involved in advocating for the release of the 11 activists. NSO\nGroup says that it sells its products only to “government intelligence and law enforcement agencies”.\n\n## Targeted Campaign against HRDs demanding the release of the Bhima Koregaon 11\n\nThe spyware campaign revealed in this blog targeted lawyers and activists Nihalsing B Rathod, Degree Prasad Chouhan, Yug Mohit\n**Choudhary, and Ragini Ahuja; academics Partho Sarothi Ray and PK Vijayan, a journalist who prefers to stay anonymous, and a human**\nrights collective – Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group (JAGLAG), received malicious e-mails on the group’s official ID, which is accessed by all of\nits members, including lawyer Shalini Gera. Another JAGLAG member, Isha Khandelwal also received malicious emails on her personal\naccount. All the people mentioned consented to be named in this blog.\n\n**Nihalsing B Rathod is a human rights lawyer based in Maharashtra. He has worked closely with the imprisoned lawyer Surendra**\nGadling as a junior lawyer. Crucially, he is one of the leading lawyers representing one of the 11 imprisoned HRDs in their legal\nproceedings.\n**Isha Khandelwal is a lawyer associated with JAGLAG, a Chattisgarh-based lawyers collective which provides legal aid to the**\nAdivasi/indigenous and other marginalised communities. The group’s primary email, which was targeted, is also accessed by lawyer\n**Shalini Gera. They are also involved in the legal defense of the HRDs in the same case.**\n**Degree Prasad Chouhan is a Dalit HRD who has worked closely with Sudha Bharadwaj in the past. Degree has been documenting**\nand campaigning against land dispossession and forced evictions of indigenous communities in India, which have been carried out by\ncoal companies and governments.\n**Partho Sarothi Ray is a Kolkata-based activist and academic, who has been a vocal critic of rights violations in the country. He has**\nalso been a member of a collective called Persecuted Prisoners’ Solidarity Committee, and has spoken out openly against the\nimprisonment of these 11 activists.\n**Yug Mohit Chaudhry and Ragini Ahuja are criminal lawyers based in Mumbai. Their main area of work include litigating death penalty**\nand civil liberties cases. They represent two of the 11 imprisoned activists in the legal proceedings.\nA journalist based in Maharashtra, who wishes to remain anonymous was also targeted. The journalist has been closely reporting on\nthe Bhima Koregaon case.\nFinally, PK Vijayan is a Delhi-based academic. He is not directly linked to the campaign for the release of the 11 HRDs, but is known to\nhave campaigned for the release of GN Saibaba, a disabled academic who remains imprisoned in Maharashtra. Saibaba has been\nconvicted under the draconian UAPA.\n\nWhile the spyware campaign detailed in this blog has no known links to NSO Group, three of the nine HRDs targeted – Shalini Gera (from\n[JAGLAG), Nihal Singh Rathod, and Degree Prasad Chouhan- were targeted using NSO Group’s surveillance tools. Anand Teltumbde, who is](https://scroll.in/latest/942218/nagpur-lawyer-notified-by-whatsapp-of-surveillance-says-bhima-koregaon-accused-were-also-targetted)\n[one of the 11 charged and imprisoned in the Bhima Koregaon incident, was also targeted using NSO Group’s tools. That some of these](https://scroll.in/latest/942218/nagpur-lawyer-notified-by-whatsapp-of-surveillance-says-bhima-koregaon-accused-were-also-targetted)\n\n\n-----\n\nindividuals were targeted multiple times shows that there is a disturbing pattern of spyware attacks against HRDs involved in the Bhima\nKoregaon case.\n\n## A Campaign of Malicious Emails\n\nDuring this investigation, we identified 12 spearphishing emails sent between January and October 2019 targeting the nine activists.\n\nA spearphishing attack is an attempt to install spyware (a malicious software) on the victim’s computer or smartphone by sending very\ncarefully crafted and personalized emails to the target, often impersonating colleagues or loved ones. In a successful attack, computers or\nmobile devices may, in essence, become wiretaps, revealing confidential and intimate conversations and interactions but nullifying the\npossibility of privacy or confidentiality. Besides this direct effect, the secretive and ubiquitous nature of these attacks means that the victims\nnever know for certain if they are being targeted or have unwittingly downloaded some kind of spyware. The consequence is that they begin\n[to fear that every communication poses a threat, which can be highly disruptive to trust and collaboration.](https://targetedthreats.net/)\n\n## Spearphishing Emails\n\nOne of the spearphishing emails was sent from an email ID impersonating the name of an activist that may be known by the targets. Other\nspearphishing emails came from the e-mail IDs pretending to be journalists or masquerading as officials from local courts.\n\n_Email sent to JAGLAG by someone pretending to work for IBC24 in October 2019_\n\n[All these spearphishing emails included a malicious link to a file hosted on Firefox Send, a free and secure file sharing platform developed by](https://send.firefox.com/)\nMozilla. We suspect that this technique was used to avoid detection by e-mail spam and malware filters, as a malicious file sent in such a way\ncannot be analyzed by security solutions used by email providers.\n\n_Email sent to a Human Rights Defender in October 2019 masquerading as a court summons_\n\nA detailed list of emails is available in Appendix 1.\n\n## Commercial Off-the-Shelf Spyware: NetWire\n\n[NetWire is a commercially available spyware reportedly used for cyber-criminality and corporate espionage since at least 2014. It has been](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0198/)\n[analyzed in depth by several security companies including the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg and](http://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-23/) [Fortinet, who have](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-netwire-rat-variant-spread-by-phishing.html)\nshown that NetWire exhibits classic spyware features such as stealing credentials, audio recordings, logging keystrokes and more.\n\n_Screenshot of the website selling Netwire (Retrieved in December 2019)_\n\nThe spearphishing emails targeting these nine HRDs attempted to deliver NetWire by attaching what looked like a PDF document but which\nwas actually malicious Windows programs that, when opened, would install NetWire on the HRD’s device. The disguise of these supposed\nPDFs included opening a decoy, real PDF when clicked. This tactic was clearly intended to trick the targeted HRD into believing that no\ninfection had taken place. Additionally, this attack takes advantage of numerous other obfuscation techniques often abused by the\nsurveillance industry to make NetWire more challenging to find and analyze (see: Appendix 1 for more information).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA coordinated spyware campaign targeted prominent HRDs, most of whom were vocal against the arbitrary and prolonged imprisonment of\nthe Bhima Koregaon 11. The spearphishing emails and spyware suggest that this is not a cyber-crime attack, but a spyware campaign trying\nto compromise devices of HRDs. If successful it would have enabled the attackers, to monitor the HRDs actions and communications and is\ntherefore a violation of their rights to freedom of expression and privacy. This spyware campaign is very concerning in the context of an\nalready perilous situation for HRDs in India where surveillance is used along with threats, imprisonment and smear campaigns against\nactivists to shrink the space for civil society.\n\nOur investigation was not able to conclusively attribute the attack to a particular group with high confidence. However, it is not the first time\nthat activists and journalists in India have been targeted using malware intended to put them under surveillance. Three of the HRDs in this\nincident were targeted earlier in 2019 with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, a commercial product only sold to government entities. This new\ncampaign confirms that there is a pattern of digital attacks against HRDs supporting the imprisoned Bhima Koregaon activists. This pattern\nunderscores the necessity of India fulfilling its obligation to provide a remedy for these abuses by conducting a full, independent and impartial\ninvestigation into these attacks, including by determining whether there are links between this spyware campaign and specific government\nagencies.\n\nTargeting people solely for exercising their right to peaceful dissent amounts to an arbitrary or unlawful attack on their privacy and violates\ntheir right to freedom of expression. States have an obligation to protect human rights by ensuring that HRDs are protected from unlawful\nsurveillance.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n**To Indian Authorities:**\n\n\n-----\n\nConduct an independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the unlawful targeted surveillance of the nine human rights\ndefenders, including determining whether there are links between this spyware campaign and any specific government agencies\n\nEnsure that all surveillance meets the tests of legality, necessity, and proportionality as enshrined in international human rights\n[standards and affirmed in the Supreme Court of India’s landmark judgement of KS Puttaswamy v.

VBS script extracts RAR archive containing 2nd level NetWire droppers. Task Scheduler entries created for 3 2nd level NetWire\n\ndroppers. Launches decoy PDF.\n\nIn this variant, payloads are only launched by Task Scheduler.\n\n_Delivery of the first payload variant_\n\n### Variant 2\n\nThis second variant was modified to add an additional execution of the NetWire payload in parallel to those launched by task scheduler, and\nin order to add a layer in between with validly signed EXEs, likely to thwart antivirus detection heuristics.\n\n1. SFX archive extracts two payloads. A SFX archive and a NetWire dropper.\n\n1. Launch 1st NetWire dropper. Launch second SFX archive, which extracts AdvancedRun/VBS stage.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. AdvancedRun launches VBS script.\n\n1. VBS script extracts RAR archive containing additional NetWire droppers. Task Scheduler entries created for 3 new NetWire droppers.\n\nLaunches decoy PDF.\n\n_Delivery of the second payload variant_\n\nThe Stage 1 SFX archive contains random README files, GPL licenses and even RFCs. Launches both the payloads contained.\n\nThe 1st level and 2nd level NetWire droppers all launch the same payload, either by launching and hollowing dllhost.exe, or launching and\nhollowing rundll32.exe, or by launching and injecting a copy of themselves.\n\n### Bypassing Security Protections With Large Files\n\nIt is the first time we have observed large files being used as a trick to bypass security protections. As described earlier, the first dropper is a\nSelf-Extracting RAR archive that extracts several files, including either the dropper or another self-extracting RAR archive running the final\ndropper. In almost all cases analyzed here, the droppers were very large files, between 50MB and 300MB.\n\nThese files mostly contain the byte 00 that is efficiently compressed by the RAR format, making the initial file quite small. As many security\nsolutions include a file size limitation to avoid overloading the detection system with heavy files, it is likely that this trick would prevent some\nsolutions from detecting these files as malicious.\n\n### Digital Signatures\n\nWe identified five samples with valid digital signatures for three different UK-registered companies. We contacted the owner of one of these\ncompanies who told us that he was never involved in signing any software. Further investigation led us to question the involvement of the\ncompanies for which they were issued. It appears that this may be part of a pattern of identity theft of small companies in order to issue\n[signatures for malicious software. A recent study has shown that since 2017, this underground market for code-signing certificates has](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02931.pdf)\nsubstantially increased.\n\n### Final Payload: NetWire\n\nThe final payload launched in memory by these samples is a NetWire sample communicating with the dynamic DNS domain\nresearchplanet.zapto[.]org.\n\n[Netwire is a commercial malware known since 2012, that has been analyzed in depth severaltimes. It has been used mostly](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-release-decrypting-netwire-c2-traffic/) in cyber-criminal\n[activities, but has also been used several times in cyber-espionage operations for instance by the Iranian attributed group APT33 in 2017. It](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)\nis today sold online for $15 a month by a company called World Wired Labs.\n\n## III. Network Analysis\n\nNetwork traffic appears to be similar in structure to typical NetWire C&C communications:\n\nAll the samples identified communicate with the dynamic DNS domain researchplanet.zapto[.]org on port 1810.\n\n## IV. Infrastructure\n\nAll the samples identified in this attack used the domain researchplanet.zapto[.]org on port 1810 as Command & Control server. This domain\n[is a dynamic DNS domain managed by the company NoIP, and was first seen as used by RiskIQ in mid-December 2018. This domain has](https://www.noip.com/)\nused multiple IPs over this year according to several passive DNS databases, we have confirmed the utilisation of the IP addresses\n185.117.66[.]188 (Edelaraudtee Infrastruktuuri AS) and 185.82.202[.]155 (Host Sailors) as NetWire C2 servers receiving connections from\ncompromised systems.\n\nThe dynamic DNS domain socialstatistics.zapto[.]org is very likely linked to this campaign, as it was connected with several IPs also used by\nresearchplanet.zapto[.]org in the end of 2019. During the investigation, we confirmed that the IP address used with this domain in December\n2019, 185.45.193.14 (Host Sailor) was also running a NetWire server on ports 7778 and 50070, confirming the link with this campaign.\n\nFinally, we consider a third dynamic DNS domain, duniaenewsportal.ddns[.]net to be linked with this campaign, as it shared the same IP\n[address 185.45.193[.]14 (Host Sailor). This domain could have been created based on the name of Dunya News, an Urdu language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunya_News)\ntelevision channel from Pakistan.\n\n## Appendix 2: Indicators of Compromise\n\n[You can find the full list of indicators of compromise here https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations](https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations)\n\n**Following are the domain names associated with this campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\nresearchplanet.zapto[.]org\n\nsocialstatistics.zapto[.]org\n\nduniaenewsportal.ddns[.]net\n\n**The IP address hosting the malicious infrastructure is:**\n\n185.82.202[.]155\n\n185.117.66[.]188\n\n185.117.74[.]47\n\n185.117.74[.]28\n\n185.45.193[.]14\n\n**Following are the email addresses used in spearphishing emails:**\n\njagdish.meshraam[@]gmail.com\n\ndrsnehapatil64[@]gmail.com\n\nsinhamuskaan04[@]gmail.com\n\njennifergonzales789[@]gmail.com\n\npayalshastri79[@]gmail.com\n\n\n-----",
