In addition, the seizure documents describe how all\n92 domains were being used in violation of U.S. sanctions targeting both the Government of\nIran and the IRGC.\n\n“We will continue to use all of our tools to stop the Iranian Government from misusing U.S.\ncompanies and social media to spread propaganda covertly, to attempt to influence the\nAmerican public secretly and to sow discord ” said Assistant Attorney General for National\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity John C. Demers. Fake news organizations have become a new outlet for\ndisinformation spread by authoritarian countries as they continue to try to undermine our\ndemocracy. Today’s actions show that we can use a variety of laws to vindicate the value of\ntransparency.”\n\n“Today we are 92 domains closer to shutting down Iran’s worldwide disinformation\ncampaign,” said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California. “This\nimportant work will continue. Iran cannot be allowed to hide behind fake news sites. If Iran\nwants to be heard using U.S. facilities, it must reveal its true colors.”\n\n“Today, we successfully seized 92 domains involved in a disinformation campaign conducted\nby Iran-based actors to promote pro-Iranian propaganda. This investigation, initiated by\nintelligence we received from Google, was a collaborative effort between the FBI and social\nmedia companies Google, Facebook, and Twitter,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge\nBennett. “This case is a perfect example of why the FBI San Francisco Division prioritizes\nmaintaining an ongoing relationship with a variety of social media and technology\ncompanies. These relationships enable a quick exchange of information to better protect\nagainst threats to the nation’s security and our democratic processes. The FBI also urges the\npublic to remain vigilant about the information they find and share on social media. Every\ncitizen must do their part to use a critical eye and look for trusted sources of information. We\nall have a role to play in protecting the American democratic system from foreign\nadversaries.”\n\nPursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unauthorized\nexports of goods, technology or services to Iran, directly or indirectly from the United States\nor by a United States person are prohibited. Pursuant to the IEEPA, the Secretary of the\nTreasury promulgated the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR) that\nprohibit the provision of services to the Government of Iran without a license. The\nDepartment of Treasury may issue a license through its Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC). Further, the United States has found that the IRGC has provided material support\nto a number of terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban and, on April 15,\n2019, the IRGC was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States\nGovernment.\n\nIn this case, the United States seized 92 domain names on Oct. 7, 2020, pursuant to a\nseizure warrant. The seizure documents describe how the 92 seized domain names were\nbeing operated in violation of federal law.\n\nFour of the domain names, “newsstand7.com,” “usjournal.net,” “usjournal.us,” and\n“twtoday.net,” were seized pursuant to FARA. FARA establishes a registration, reporting,\nand disclosure regime for agents of foreign principals (which includes foreign nongovernment individuals and entities) so that the U.S. government and the people of the\nUnited States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons\nattempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and law. FARA requires, among other\n\n\n-----\n\nthings, that persons subject to its requirements submit periodic registration statements\ncontaining truthful information about their activities and the income earned from them.\nDisclosure of the required information allows the federal government and the American\npeople to evaluate the statements and activities of such persons in light of their function as\nforeign agents. Here, the four domains purported to be independent news outlets, but were\nactually operated by or on behalf of the IRGC to target the United States with pro-Iranian\npropaganda in an attempt to influence the American people to change United States foreign\nand domestic policy toward Iran and the Middle East. These domains targeted a United\nStates audience without proper registration pursuant to FARA and without notifying the\nAmerican public with a conspicuous notice that the content of the domains was being\npublished on behalf of the IRGC and the Government of Iran.\n\nIn addition, the remaining 88 domains targeted audiences in Western Europe, the Middle\nEast, and South East Asia and masqueraded as genuine news outlets while actually being\noperated by the IRGC to spread pro-Iranian disinformation around the globe to the benefit of\nthe Government of Iran. The Government of Iran and the IRGC utilized website and domain\nservices in the United States without a license from OFAC. All 92 domains are owned and\noperated by United States companies. Neither the IRGC nor the Government of Iran\nobtained a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control prior to utilizing the domain\nnames. A list of the 92 seized domain names is available here.\n\nVisitors to the sites received the following message:\n\nThis seizure was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Special Prosecutions Section and Asset Forfeiture Unit of the U.S. Attorney s Office for\nthe Northern District of California, and the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of\nthe Department of Justice’s National Security Division, are prosecuting the seizure.\n\n[Download List of Domain Names (PDF)](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/press-release/file/1325981/download)\n\nTopic(s):\n\nCounterintelligence and Export Control\n\nNational Security\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n20-1067\n\n\n-----",
