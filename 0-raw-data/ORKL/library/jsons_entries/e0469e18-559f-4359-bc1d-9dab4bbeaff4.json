    "plain_text": "# Cosmic Lynx Returns in 2021 with Updated Tricks\n\n**agari.com/email-security-blog/cosmic-lynx-returns-2021/**\n\nFebruary 11, 2021\n\n[Email Security Blog](https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/)\n\nShare\n\n[In July 2020, we published a report on a Russian-based BEC group we called Cosmic Lynx.](https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/cosmic-lynx-russian-bec/)\nIn that [report, we described the tactics used by the group, which included its targeting of](https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/acid-agari-cosmic-lynx.pdf)\nsenior executives at large companies with a global footprint and how it uses mergers and\nacquisitions (M&A) themes in its BEC email lures.\n\nShortly after we published the report, we saw a significant decrease in Cosmic Lynx activity\nfor more than three months. While we can’t conclusively say that our report caused Cosmic\nLynx to go on a hiatus, the timing was very notable. In mid-October 2020, though, we started\nto detect a resurgence in Cosmic Lynx activity, using the same tactics that we had previously\nobserved prior to their disappearance.\n\nIn late-December 2020, however, we observed a shift in Cosmic Lynx’s tactics. First, the\ngroup started including references to a COVID-19 vaccine in their initial emails. Cosmic Lynx\nhad previously used COVID themes in their communications earlier in 2020 as a way to build\nrapport with their targets, but the inclusion of vaccine references indicates the group is\ncontinuing to update their lures to reflect items of global interest. Examples of COVID\nvaccine references in recent Cosmic Lynx BEC campaigns have included lines like “The\nrecent developments in vaccines offer glimmers of hope for the global economy,” or “The\nworld economy is approaching a turning point amid hopes for a rapid recovery fueled by an\nearly vaccine.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cosmic Lynx email referencing COVID-19 vaccines._\n\nIn addition to referencing COVID vaccines, Cosmic Lynx has also continued using other\npandemic themes as a way to frame the rationale for the supposed acquisition. In some of\ntheir recent campaigns, the group writes that the pandemic “has created dislocations in\nseveral markets and we intend to seize the opportunity now” and “We must now position\nourselves for the coming economic upturn even as we maintain vigilance in this uncertain\nperiod.”\n\n_Cosmic Lynx email containing COVID-19 themes._\n\nSecond, Cosmic Lynx changed the construction of the email addresses they use to send\nBEC emails. Since mid-2019, the email addresses used by Cosmic Lynx were constructed to\nmimic secure email and network infrastructure and referenced celestial bodies, like planets\nand stars. In December 2020, the group started using email addresses that seem to be\ncreated to look like more generic email infrastructure, sometimes resembling Amazon Simple\nEmail Service (SES) naming conventions, such as eu-west-smtp-outbound[at]veritas-securegateway[.]cc or us-east-tls-smtp-gateway[at]trustnet-server[.]cc.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, instead of continuing communication over email, Cosmic Lynx immediately attempts\nto redirect a target to phone communication. At the end of their recent BEC emails, Cosmic\nLynx now includes a request like, “Can you please let me know when you are available and\nthe best number to reach you at?” While we do not yet have concrete details about how\nthese calls would proceed, it is likely that Cosmic Lynx will use technology to mask the voice\nof the actor.\n\n_Cosmic Lynx email requesting target’s phone number._\n\nSince the end of December 2020, Cosmic Lynx’s BEC activity has returned to the\nconsistently high volume we saw in early-2020. Since the beginning of 2021, we have\nobserved 43 distinct Cosmic Lynx BEC campaigns targeting executive employees in 19\ncountries. Since July 2019, we have identified Cosmix Lynx attacks against targets in a total\nof 53 different countries around the world.\n\nAs we noted in our initial Cosmic Lynx report, the entrance of a sophisticated Russian\ncybercriminal group into the BEC scene shows that actors are realizing that the return on\ninvestment for BEC attacks is better than other types of technically sophisticated cyber\nattacks. Cosmic Lynx has demonstrated the capability to develop much more complex and\ncreative attacks that sets them apart from other BEC groups. To protect against threats like\nCosmic Lynx, organizations need to make sure they have defenses in place that are\nequipped to defend against identity deception attacks that traditional inbound email filters are\nnot equipped to handle.\n\n**Recent Domains Associated with Cosmic Lynx BEC Attacks**\n\nemail-secure-server[.]cc\n\nemail-security-gateway[.]cc\n\ngateway-resolver[.]cc\n\nintranet-gateway[.]cc\n\nintranet-host[.]cc\n\nintranet-server[.]cc\n\nintranetgateway[.]net\n\nintranetserver[ ]net\n\n\n-----\n\nsecure-gateway-resolver[.]cc\nsecure-server-gateway[.]cc\ntrustnet-secure-server[.]cc\nveritas-secure-gateway[.]cc\nveritas-secure-host[.]cc\n\n**Recent IP Addresses Linked to Cosmic Lynx Mail Servers**\n\n107[.]175[.]38[.]100\n107[.]175[.]38[.]108\n194[.]5[.]249[.]162\n212[.]38[.]166[.]131\n212[.]38[.]166[.]35\n212[.]38[.]166[.]65\n212[.]38[.]166[.]68\n23[.]95[.]97[.]33\n23[.]95[.]97[.]42\n23[.]95[.]97[.]7\n23[.]95[.]97[.]8\n45[.]79[.]249[.]6\n46[.]249[.]59[.]110\n46[.]249[.]59[.]111\n46[.]249[.]59[.]67\n5[.]133[.]179[.]133\n5[.]133[.]179[.]65\n62[.]182[.]84[.]201\n62[.]182[.]84[.]202\n93[.]158[.]208[.]104\n93[.]158[.]208[.]108\n93[.]158[.]208[.]110\n94[.]242[.]206[.]17\n94[.]242[.]206[.]18\n94[.]242[.]206[.]210\n94[.]242[.]224[.]203\n\nTAGS\n\n[russian bec](https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog?tag=russian-bec)\n\n\n-----",
