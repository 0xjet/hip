The campaign uses a link to Google Docs from where the BazarLoader\nmalware executable is downloaded.\n\n## Background\n\nBazarLoader is a new malware loader attributed to a threat actor with a close relation to the\nTrickBot malware. The loader is also aptly named KEGTAP, as in device used to open a beer\nkeg,3 because it is used to “open” the network of victims for follow up malware in order to move\nlaterally on the network and eventually deploy ransomware.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nOn 2020-10-13 at exactly 13:00 UTC Hornetsecurity registered the first emails of the new\nBazarLoader campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe emails use a termination lure:\n\nThe URL in the email is a legitimate Google Doc URL:\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom their all links lead to the BazarLoader executable ( Report10-13.exe ).\n\nWhen executed, BazarLoader will use OpenNIC Public DNS Servers to resolve a `.bazar`\ndomain generated via domain generation algorithm (DGA). The `.bazar domain is not a regular`\nTLD but rather an alternative DNS TLD of the decentralized EmerDNS blockchain DNS system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the BazarLoader will download and install the BazarBackdoor .1 This backdoor will be used\nto move laterally in the victim’s network in order to take over the domain controller. Eventually the\nintrusion is monetized by deploying the Ryuk2 ransomware.\n\n## Conclusion and Countermeasure\n\nBecause the payload download is hosted on the legitimate Google Docs site victims are more\nlikely to click the link in the email then they would an obscure URL they are unfamiliar with.\nBazarLoader’s use of the EmerDNS blockchain DNS system makes it immune to current efforts\nby various security vendors to disrupt the operations of TrickBot.\n\nHornetsecurity’s [Spam Filter Service and Malware Protection, already detects and quarantines](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\nthe outlined threat emails.\n\n## References\n\n Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### Hashes\n\n**MD5** **Filename** **Description**\n\n`9cd1f319f58c3979399c1779d5a34bc2` `Report10-13.exe` BazarLoader\n\n### IPs\n\nOpenNIC Public Servers used by the analyzed BazarLoader version:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n   195.10.195.195 (53/udp)\n   192.71.245.208 (53/udp)\n   172.126.70.119 (53/udp)\n   151.80.222.79 (53/udp)\n   94.16.114.254 (53/udp)\n   193.183.98.66 (53/udp)\n   51.254.25.115 (53/udp)\n   95.174.65.241 (53/udp)\n\n### URLs\n   hxxps[:]//docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX   1vTVCHKzmdSD2wX03GTnyBToo4xvldfGqtFWZiz5bT5cTRozW4Xk5H6GER0GmscSPqnpyFtokphDl   _U/pub\n\n```\n\n-----",
