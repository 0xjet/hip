We then\nanalyzed the sample, making sense of it with various IoC findings. As a result, security\nproviders have named this example HermeticWiper.\n\nThe malware was detected on thousands of different devices in Ukraine and tagged as\nKillDisk.NCV. It is named HermeticWiper because of the digital certificate the malware holds.\nThe certificate, issued with Hermetica Digital Ltd, is valid from 2021.\n\nResearchers state they can obtain the certificate by using it on behalf of a front company or\nconfiscating a closed company. However, security researchers have noticed that malware\nsigned with this certificate is no longer seen.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
