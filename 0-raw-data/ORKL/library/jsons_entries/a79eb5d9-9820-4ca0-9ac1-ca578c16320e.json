The attack was initially targeted at several large\ncompanies, including Google. It is now public and is available on the web. The public\nrelease significantly increases the possibility of widespread attacks exploiting the\nvulnerability, putting Internet Explorer users at potentially serious risk.\n\nMicrosoft is aware of the targeted attacks and lists the following combinations as\nvulnerable: Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack\n4, and Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on supported\neditions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008,\nWindows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/979352.mspx\n\nBelow we have a summary of McAfee’s assessment of Internet Explorer and platform\nrisks:\n\n  - DEP\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nData Execution Prevention (DEP) is a set of hardware and software technologies that\nperform additional checks on memory to help prevent malicious code from running\non a system. In Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Microsoft\nWindows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, DEP is enforced by hardware and by software.\n\nThe primary benefit of DEP is to help prevent code execution from data pages.\nTypically, code is not executed from the default heap and the stack. Hardwareenforced DEP detects code that is running from these locations and raises an\nexception when execution occurs. Software-enforced DEP can help prevent malicious\ncode from taking advantage of exception-handling mechanisms in Windows.\n\n## McAfee detection names for Aurora\n\n### Exploit-Comele\n\nThis maliciously crafted script attempts to exploit the vulnerability when Internet\nExplorer handles certain DOM operations.\n\nAn attacker may exploit this issue to execute remote code.\n\nhttp://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_253210.htm\n\n### Roarur.dr\n\nThis Trojan drops further malicious files onto the victim’s computer.\n\nhttp://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_253415.htm\n\n### Roarur.dll\n\nThis Trojan is dropped by the roarur.dr Trojan.\n\nThe dll creates an additional service on the victim’s computer and checks for certain files\non the system.

In some cases, it\nmay also be necessary to run the on-demand scan in Safe Mode, as well as run a second\nscan after a reboot. It is critical that the on-demand scan be configured properly.\n\nThe proper configuration:\n\n  - Scan All Local Drives\n\n  - Memory for Rootkits\n\n  - Running Processes\n\n  - Registry\n\n  - First “Action” set to “Clean”\n\nThe full, recommended process:\n\n  - Launch a full on-demand scan with the prior-documented configuration\n\n  - Allow the scan to run to completion\n\n  - Reboot\n\n  - Launch a second on-demand scan and allow it to run to completion to verify that\nthe system has been cleaned\n\n## Common URLs accessed\n\nThe following domains need to be blocked at the firewall:\n```\n360.homeunix.com \n69.164.192.4\nalt1.homelinux.com\namt1.homelinux.com \naop1.homelinux.com\napp1.homelinux.com \nblogspot.blogsite.org \nfiloups.info\nftp2.homeunix.com \nftpaccess.cc \ngoogle.homeunix.com \nmembers.linode.com \nsl1.homelinux.org \nsl1.homelinux.org\ntyuqwer.dyndns.org \nupdate.ourhobby.com \nvoanews.ath.cx \nwebswan.33iqst.com:4000\nyahoo.8866.org \nymail.ath.cx \nyahooo.8866.org \nsl1.homelinux.org \n360.homeunix.com \nftp2.homeunix.com \nupdate.ourhobby.com\nconnectproxy.3322.org\ncsport.2288.org\n\n```\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n- This data is subject to change.\n\n- For the latest data, please visit McAfee Aurora site\nhttp://www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/operation_aurora.html\n\n## Appendix A: Useful URLs related to Aurora\n\nhttp://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/reports/how_can_u_tell.pdf\nhttp://www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/aurora_enterprise.html\nhttp://newsroom.mcafee.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=3613\nhttp://www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/operation_aurora.html\nhttp://www.avertlabs.com/research/blog/\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/979352.mspx\nhttp://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0249\nhttp://podcasts.mcafee.com/audioparasitics/AudioParasitics-Episode80-01-2010.mp3\nhttp://community.mcafee.com/groups/operation-aurora\n\n\n11\n\n\n-----",
