While some**\n**allegedly work for the government earning a normal salary, others are accused of**\n**making a fortune from ransomware attacks and online theft. If they left Russia they'd**\n**be arrested - but at home they appear to be given free rein.**\n\n\"We're wasting our time,\" I thought, as I watched a cat licking the carcass of a discarded\ntakeaway chicken.\n\nSurely there would no longer be any trace of an alleged multi-millionaire cyber-criminal on\nthis dilapidated estate in a run-down town 700km (400 miles) east of Moscow.\n\nBut I pressed on with an interpreter and cameraman, shooing the mangy cat away from the\nentrance to the block of flats.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we knocked at one of the doors, a young man answered and a curious elderly woman\npeered around the corner at us from the kitchen.\n\n\"Igor Turashev? No, I don't recognise the name,\" he said.\n\n\"His family is registered here, so who are you?\" we asked.\n\nAfter some friendly chat we explained we were reporters from the BBC, and the mood\nsuddenly changed.\n\n\"I'm not telling you where he is and you shouldn't try to find him. You shouldn't have come\nhere,\" the young man said angrily.\n\nI didn't sleep well that night, thinking of the conflicting advice I'd been given by people in the\nsecurity sector.\n\nSome said trying to track down wanted cyber-criminals on their home soil was risky. \"They'll\nhave armed guards,\" I was told. \"You'll end up in a ditch somewhere,\" another warned.\nOthers said it would be fine - \"They're just computer geeks.\"\n\nAll said we wouldn't get anywhere near them.\n\nImage source, US Department of Justice\n\nImage caption,\nMaksim Yakubets, Igor Turashev and seven others allegedly from Evil Corp were sanctioned,\nindicted or designated in December 2019\n\nIn a press conference two years ago, the FBI named nine members of the Russian hacking\ngroup, Evil Corp, accusing Igor Turashev and the gang's alleged leader, Maksim Yakubets, of\nstealing or extorting more than $100m in hacks affecting 40 different countries.\n\nThe victims range from small businesses to multinationals like Garmin, as well as charities\nand a school. They're just the ones we know about.\n\nWatch The Russian Hackers Wanted by the West on the iPlayer this weekend, and\nthe BBC News Channel - click here for timings\n[Viewers outside the UK can watch on BBC World News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00124hc)\n\nThe US Department of Justice says the men are \"cyber-enabled bank robbers\" staging\nransomware attacks, or hacking into accounts to steal money.\n\nThe announcement made Maksim Yakubets, then only 32, a poster boy for the playboy\nRussian hacker.\n\n[Footage of the gang obtained by the UK's National Crime Agency, showed the men driving](https://twitter.com/nca_uk/status/1202644233586393088)\ncustom Lamborghinis laughing with wads of cash and playing with a pet lion cub\n\n\n-----\n\nImage source, National Crime Agency\n\nImage caption,\nMaksim Yakubets drives a custom Lamborghini with the Russian word for \"thief\" on the\nlicence plate\n\nThe FBI's indictment of the two men was the result of years of work, including interviews with\nformer gang members and the use of cyber-forensics. Some information dated back as far\nas 2010, when Russian police were still prepared to collaborate with their US colleagues.\n\nThose days are long gone now. The Russian government routinely brushes off US hacking\naccusations against its citizens.\n\nIn fact, not only are the hackers allowed to carry on, they are recruited by the security\nservices too.\n\nOur investigation into Maksim Yakubets began in an unlikely place - a golf course about two\nhours outside Moscow.\n\nThis was the venue for his spectacular wedding in 2017, a video of which was spotted by\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and widely shared.\n\nTellingly, Yakubets' face is never shown in the footage, filmed by a wedding video production\ncompany, but he can be seen dancing to live music performed by a famous Russian singer\nunder a beautiful light show.\n\nImage source, National Crime Agency\n\nImage caption,\nMaksim Yakubets' wedding may have cost more than half a million dollars\n\nWedding planner Natalia wouldn't go into specifics about Yakubets' big day but showed us\naround some of the key locations, including a pillared building carved out of the hills near a\nlake.\n\n\"It's our exclusive room,\" she said. \"The newlyweds love to get inside for photo shoots and\nromance.\"\n\nAs we were driven around by golf cart I did some maths. With what we were being told, this\ngrand wedding would have cost considerably more than the estimates I'd heard previously of\naround $250,000. The price tag was potentially closer to half a million dollars, or even\n$600,000.\n\nWe don't know how the special day was paid for, but if Yakubets picked up the bill it's an\nindication of just how lavish his lifestyle is.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage source, US Department of Justice\n\nImage caption,\nIgor Turashev is accused of being a system administrator for Evil Corp\n\nNor is Igor Turashev, 40, keeping a low profile.\n\nUsing public records, my colleague Andrey Zakharov, BBC Russia's Cyber Reporter, found\nthree companies registered in his name.\n\nAll have offices in Moscow's prestigious Federation Tower, a shiny skyscraper in the financial\ndistrict that wouldn't look out of place in Manhattan or London's Canary Wharf.\n\nA puzzled receptionist looked for a phone number, and found that the offices didn't have one.\nShe did find a mobile phone under the firm's name though, and put us through.\n\nWe called it and waited. A Frank Sinatra song played for about five minutes, then finally\nsomeone picked up, sounding as though he was on a busy street - only to hang up when we\nsaid we were journalists.\n\nAs Andrey explained, Turashev is not wanted in Russia so no-one is stopping him renting\nthis expensive city-centre office space.\n\nIt may also be convenient for him to be located among financial companies, including some\nthat deal in the cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, that Evil Corp is alleged to have collected\nfrom victims in ransomware attacks - reportedly $10m-worth in one case.\n\n[A Bloomberg report using research from Bitcoin analysts Chainalysis claims that the](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/bitcoin-money-laundering-happening-in-moscow-s-vostok-tower-experts-say)\nFederation Tower houses numerous crypto firms that act like \"cash machines for cybercriminals\".\n\nWe tried two other addresses linked to Turashev and another key Evil Corp figure called\nDenis Gusev, and made numerous approaches by phone and email, but no-one answered.\n\nAndrey and I spent a long time trying to find a place of work for Maksim Yakubets.\n\nHe used to be a director of his mother's cattle feed company, but these days he appears to\nhave no registered business or employer.\n\nWhat we did find, though, were addresses where he might still live, so one night we went to\ngive them a knock.\n\nAt one, a man laughed over the intercom as we explained where we were from.\n\n\"Maksim Yakubets isn't here. He hasn't been here for probably 15 years. I'm his dad,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo our surprise Yakubets senior then came out into the hallway and gave us an impassioned\n20-minute interview on camera, angrily condemning the US authorities for indicting his son.\n\nMedia caption,\nMaksim Yakubets doesn't answer calls and emails, so Joe Tidy knocks on a door where he\nonce lived - and speaks to his father\n\nThe $5m US reward for information leading to his son's arrest - the highest ever bounty for a\nnamed cyber-criminal - had led the family to live in fear of attack, Mr Yakubets said,\ndemanding that we publish his words.\n\n\"The Americans created a problem for my family, for many people who know us, for our\nrelatives. What was the purpose? American justice has turned into Soviet justice. He was not\nquestioned, he was not interrogated, there were no procedures that would prove his guilt.\"\n\nHe denied that his son was a cyber-criminal. When I asked how he thought he had become\nso rich, he laughed, saying that I was exaggerating the price tag of the wedding and that the\nluxury cars were rented. Maksim's salary was higher than average, he said, because \"he\nworks, he gets paid, he has a job\".\n\n\"What does he do for work then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why should I tell you?\" he replied. \"What about our private lives?\"\n\nHe said he hadn't had any contact with his son since the indictment, so could not put us in\ntouch with him.\n\nYakubets and Turashev are part of the growing list of Russian citizens to be issued with\ncyber-sanctions as the West struggles to respond to cyber-attacks.\n\nMore Russian people and organisations have been sanctioned and indicted than those of\nany other nationality.\n\nIndictments prevent the hackers from travelling abroad, while the sanctions freeze any\nassets they have in the West, and ban them from doing business with Western firms.\n\nLast year the European Union started issuing cyber-sanctions, following in the US's\nfootsteps, and it's mainly Russians who have been named and shamed on this list too.\n\nThe vast majority of the individuals on these lists are said to have direct links to the Russian\nstate, hacking in order to spy, project power or exert pressure. While all nations hack each\nother, the US, EU and allies claim that some of the Russian attacks cross a line, in terms of\nwhat is acceptable.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Some of the men are accused of causing widespread blackouts in Ukraine by hacking power](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38573074)\ngrids. Others are wanted for trying to [hack into a chemical weapons testing facility in the](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45747472)\nwake of the Salisbury poisonings.\n\nThe Kremlin denies all accusations, routinely laughing them off as Western hysteria and\n\"Russophobia\".\n\nAs there are no clear rules for what is acceptable nation state hacking, we deliberately\nconcentrated our investigation on the individuals accused of being criminals, hacking for\nprofit.\n\nImage source, National Crime Agency\n\nImage caption,\nAn alleged member of Evil Corp holding wads of cash\n\nSo do cyber-sanctions against \"criminal\" hackers work?\n\nSpeaking to Yakubets' father it seems that they do have some impact - at the very least they\nmade him furious.\n\nHowever Evil Corp appears to have been unaffected.\n\nCyber-security researchers allege the crew are still carrying out lucrative cyber-attacks on\nmainly Western targets.\n\nThe \"golden rule\" of Russian hacking, according to researchers and former hackers, is that\nnon-state-employed criminal hackers can hack who they like, as long as the victims are not\nin Russian-speaking or former Soviet territories.\n\nThe rule appears to work, as cyber-security researchers have for many years noticed fewer\nattacks in those countries. They've also found that some malware is designed to avoid\ncomputers with Russian language systems.\n\nLilia Yapparova, an investigative reporter working at Meduza, one of few independent news\norganisations in the country, says the golden rule is helpful for the intelligence services,\nwhich can then exploit the skills hackers have developed while working for themselves.\n\n\"It's more valuable for the FSB to enlist hackers in Russia than to put them in jail. One of my\nsources, who is an ex-FSB officer, told me that he personally tried to enlist some of the guys\nfrom Evil Corp to do some work for him,\" she says.\n\nThe US claims that Maksim Yakubets and other wanted hackers - including Evgeniy\nBogachev, who has a $3m bounty out for his arrest - have worked directly for the intelligence\nservices.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt may not be a coincidence that Yakubets father-in-law, seen in the wedding video, is a\nformer high-level member of the FSB.\n\nWe asked the Russian government to comment on the fact that hackers seem to operate\nfreely in Russia, but received no reply.\n\nWhen Vladimir Putin was asked about this at the Geneva summit with Joe Biden this\nsummer, he [denied that high-profile attacks were originating in his country and even claimed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57504007)\nthat most cyber-attacks began in the US. But he said he would work with the US to \"bring\norder\".\n\n## The rise of Evil Corp\n\n2009: Evil Corp arrives on the scene, allegedly using malware called Cridex, Dridex,\nBugat or Zeus to steal banking logins and grab money from accounts\n2012: Members of Evil Corp are indicted by a court in Nebraska under their online\nmonikers, as their identities are unknown (Yakubets allegedly goes under the name\n\"Aqua\")\n2017: The crew is accused of starting a \"ransomware as a service\" (RaaS) operation it's claimed other hackers pay to use their ransomware, called BitPaymer\n2019: Yakubets, Turashev and seven others are indicted, sanctioned or designated in\nthe US - a $5m bounty is offered for information leading to Yakubets' arrest\nSince 2019, Evil Corp is alleged to have cycled through different brands and variants of\nransomware including DoppelPaymer, Grief, WastedLocker, Hades, Phoenix and\nMacaw\n\nIn the last six months the US and its allies have gone beyond cyber-sanctions, and started\nemploying a far more aggressive tactic.\n\nThey have begun hacking back against cyber-crime gangs and have successfully taken\nsome of them offline, at least temporarily. REvil and DarkSide have announced on forums\nthat they are no longer operating because of law enforcement action.\n\nOn two occasions US government hackers have even managed to retrieve millions of dollars\nof Bitcoin stolen from victims.\n\nAn international effort involving Europol and the US Department of Justice has also seen\nalleged hackers arrested in South Korea, Kuwait, Romania and Ukraine.\n\nHowever, cyber security researchers say more groups are surfacing, and attacks are\noccurring every week. The phenomenon will not go away, they say, as long as hackers can\nflourish in Russia.\n\n## You may also be interested in:\n\n\n-----\n\nImage source, Plinofficial Instagram\n\nRussian musician Plinofficial once dreamed of becoming the biggest rap artist on the planet.\nWhere did it go wrong?\n\n[How a rapper's social media posts got the FBI's attention](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52671381)\n\n\n-----",
