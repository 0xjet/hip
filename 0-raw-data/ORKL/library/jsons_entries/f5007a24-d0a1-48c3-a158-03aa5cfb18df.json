These campaigns were presumed to be carried out by the Kazakh and the Lebanese governments, as](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/dark-caracal-good-news-and-bad-news)\nuncovered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Lookout.\n\nDuring this past year, dozens of digitally signed variants of this once commodity malware started to reappear in the threat landscape, reigniting\ninterest in this old malware family.\n\nIn the latest wave of attacks, we once again identified an unusually large variety of targeted sectors and locations. This further reinforces a\nprevious hypothesis that the malware is not developed in-house and used by a single entity, but is part of an offensive infrastructure sold by a\nthird party to governments and threat actors worldwide, to facilitate offensive cyber operations.\n\nIn this publication, we showcase the latest evolution of the infection chain offered by this unknown third-party, compare the different Bandook\nvariants, and share the various techniques its creators use to hinder analysis and detection of all the components in the attack flow.\n\n## Infection Chain\n\nAs the infection chain is constantly evolving, we describe the one used by the attackers from as early as July, to the present day.\n\nThe full infection chain of the attack can be broken down into three main stages. The first stage starts, as in many other infection chains, with a\nmalicious Microsoft Word document delivered inside a ZIP file. Once the document is opened, malicious macros are downloaded using the\nexternal template feature. The macros’ code in turn drops and executes the second stage of the attack, a PowerShell script encrypted inside\nthe original Word document. Finally, the PowerShell script downloads and executes the last stage of the infection: the Bandook backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n💡 `e` `a es o` `t e` `a` `ous a t` `acts desc` `bed be o` `ay` `a y` `o` `o e` `ect o` `to t e` `e t`\n\nFigure 1: Full infection chain.\n\n## First Stage – Lure Documents\n\nThe first stage starts with a Microsoft Word document with embedded encrypted malicious script data and an external template that points to a\ndocument containing malicious VBA macros.\n\nThe external template is downloaded via a URL shortening web service like TinyURL or Bitly, which redirects to another domain controlled by\nthe attacker.\n\nThe external template document contains a VBA code that runs automatically, decrypts the embedded data from the original lure document,\nand drops the decoded data into two files in the local user folder: `fmx.ps1 (the next stage PowerShell) and` `sdmc.jpg (base64 encoded`\nPowerShell code).\n\nTo allow this behavior, the attackers use a combination of two techniques: encrypted data is embedded inside a shape object within the original\ndocument (hidden from view by a small font size and white foreground), and is accessed from the external template code by using the\nfollowing code:\n```\no4QQLW7zXjLbj = ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange.Text\n\n```\n\nFor proper analysis, both the original document and the external template must be located, which makes things a bit more difficult for\ninvestigators.\n\nWe observed and analyzed multiple pairs of documents and external templates. Different lure images were used, alongside different\nencryption keys.\n\n**Examples of lure documents:**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Lure documents used to convince the user to enable the macros.\n**Examples of external templates with macros:**\n\nFigure 3: External templates containing malicious macros.\nThe external templates are not visible to the victim. Their only purpose is to provide malicious macros.\n\nInterestingly, with each attack, after a certain amount of time, the attacker switched the malicious external template to a benign one, further\nmuddying our analysis of the infection chain.\n\nHere again, the external templates look like random benign documents:\n\nFigure 4: Benign external templates.\nThe themes of the documents are often of cloud-based services like Office365, OneDrive and Azure that contain images of other documents\nsupposedly available once the victim clicks “Enable Content.”\n\nFor example, one of the documents that specifically got our attention depicts an Office365 logo and a preview of a certificate issued by the\ngovernment of Dubai. JAFZA – Jebel Ali Free Zone, featured at the top of the document, is an industrial area surrounding the port of Jebel Ali\nin Dubai, where more than 7,000 global companies are based.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Lure document (left) and an example of a similar publicly available certificate (right).\nSample document file names:\n\nMalaysia Shipment.docx\nJakarta Shipment.docx\nmalta containers.docx\nCertified documents.docx\nNotarized Documents.docx\nbank statement.docx\npassport and documents.docx\nCase Draft.docx\ndocuments scan.docx\n\n## Second Stage – PowerShell Loader\n\nAfter the VBA code drops the two files ( fmx.ps1 and `sdmc.jpg ), it invokes` `fmx.ps1 .`\n```\nfmx.ps1 is a short PowerShell script that decodes and executes a base64 encoded PowerShell stored in the second dropped file\n\n```\n( sdmc.jpg ).\n\nFirst, the decoded PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing four files from a cloud service such as Dropbox, Bitbucket or an S3 bucket.\nThe zip file is stored in the user’s `Public folder, and the four files are locally extracted.`\n\nFigure 6: Malware components stored on Dropbox.com.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Malware components after being extracted on the\n\nvictim’s device.\nThree of the files, `a.png,` `b.png and` `untitled.png, are used by the PowerShell script to generate the malware payload in the same`\nfolder. `untitled.png, unlike the other two files, is in a valid image format. It contains a hidden RC4 function encoded in the RGB values of`\n[the pixels, created using a known tool named invoke-PSImage.](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-PSImage)\n\nThe final executable payload is concatenated from the following files:\n```\n   a.png – After it is decrypted using RC4 and stored as aps.png .\n   b.png – As is.\n\n```\nFinally, the PowerShell script executes the malware, opens `draft.docx, and deletes all previous artifacts from the` `Public folder.`\n```\ndraft.docx is a benign document whose sole purpose is to convince the victim that the document is no longer available, and that the overall\n\n```\nexecution was successful.\n\nFigure 8: Final document shown to the user post-infection.\n\n## Third Stage – The Bandook Loader\n\nThe final payload in this infection chain is a variant of an old full-featured RAT named Bandook. Written in both Delphi and C++, Bandook has a\nlong history, starting in 2007 as a commercially available RAT that was developed by a Lebanese individual nicknamed PrinceAli. Over time,\nseveral variants of the malware builder were leaked to the Web, and the malware became publicly available for download.\n\nFigure 9: Bandook’s history described on a\n\nhacking forum.\nBandook’s execution flow starts with a loader, written in Delphi, that uses the Process Hollowing technique to create a new instance of an\nInternet Explorer process and inject a malicious payload into it. The payload contacts the C&C sever, sends basic information about the\ninfected machine, and waits for additional commands from the server.\n\n\n-----\n\ne a a t o t e a doo a a e e obse ed t s attac as ot o e o t e a a ts ose bu de as p e ous y ea ed to t e eb\n(which supported a range of more than 100 commands).\n\nIn this attack, the threat actor utilized a custom, slimmed-down version of the malware with only 11 supported commands, including:\n\nFile operations\nTaking screenshots\nFile download\nFile upload\nFile execution\n\n💡 `For a full list of commands and their corresponding request codes, see Appendix A.`\n\nIn this version, the communication protocol with the C&C server was also upgraded to use AES encryption.\n\n## Bandook variants in the wild\n\nAfter comparing the Bandook variant we observed in the attack with the ones created by different leaked builders, we began hunting for\nvariants more similar to the ones we observed.\n\n[Our search led us to tweets by the MalwareHunterTeam (MHT) from 2019-2020 that mention various Bandook samples — all of them digitally](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nsigned with certificates that were issued by Certum.\n\nFigure 10: Signed Bandook samples discovered by MHT.\n\nIn the newer attack flows we observed, we once again found valid Certum certificates were used to sign the Bandook malware executable.\n\nFigure 11: Valid signature information of a newly discovered Bandook sample.\n\n\n-----\n\na y g a a doo sa p es oted by, e d sco e ed t at t e e y st o t e sa p es as co p ed a c 0 9 a d suppo ted\naround 120 commands. A sample compiled a few days later – a different signed Bandook variant (with only 11 commands) utilized the\n**very same C&C server. Since then, all signed samples use only 11 basic commands. The shared C&C provides clear evidence that both the**\nslimmed-down and the fully-fledged variants of the malware are operated by a single attacker.\n\nIn addition to the Bandook samples that were reported by MHT, we identified additional samples from the same time period (2019-2020) which\nwere not digitally signed and contained about 120 commands. These were the only ITW Bandook samples we were able to locate from this\ntime period.\n\nSeveral factors led us to believe that these signed and unsigned variants are specially crafted Bandook variants, used and developed by the\nsame entity.\n\nBoth use the same domain registration services for their C&C domains: Porkbun or NameSilo.\nThey share a similar method of communication, using the AES encryption algorithm in CFB mode, with a hardcoded IV:\n0123456789123456. This feature is not available in the public leaks of this malware.\nThey incorporated commands that we did not observe in any other public leak or report. Most notable are the commands to execute\n**Python and Java payloads.**\n\nFigure 12: Bandook subroutine to execute\n\na precompiled Python from a file named “dpx.pyc”.\n**At this point, we have three different variants of the malware, which we believe are operated and sold by a single entity, in**\n**accordance with their chronological appearance:**\n\n1. A full-fledged version with 120 commands (not signed).\n2. A full-fledged version (single sample) with 120 commands (signed).\n3. A slimmed-down version with 11 commands (signed).\n\nThe move to a slimmed-down version with only 11 commands for signed executables may indicate the operators’ desire to reduce the\nmalware’s footprint and maximize their chances for an undetectable campaign against high profile targets (and high paying customers), while\ncontinuing the use of the un-signed 120 commands variant for lower profile ones.\n\nFurthermore, such a minimized backdoor might indicate that the slimmed-down variant of Bandook is only utilized as a loader for an additional,\nmore full-featured malware to be downloaded next.\n\n## Targeting\n\nAs mentioned previously, in this campaign we observed an unusually large variety of targeted sectors and locations. This strengthens a\nhypothesis made by researchers – that the malware is not being developed and used by a single entity, but an offensive infrastructure is being\nsold by a third-party, to governments and threat actors worldwide, to facilitate offensive cyber operations.\n\n**The different targeted sectors include:**\n\nGovernment, financial, energy, food industry, healthcare, education, IT and legal institutions.\n\n**In the following countries:**\n\nSingapore, Cyprus, Chile, Italy, USA, Turkey, Switzerland, Indonesia and Germany.\n\n## Connection to Dark Caracal\n\n\n-----\n\ns ca pa g s t t e st sta ce o t e a doo a a e co po ated a ta geted attac s e t o ed, [a jo t epo t](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/Lookout_Dark-Caracal_srr_20180118_us_v.1.0.pdf) o oo out\nand the EFF, targeted attacks utilizing a Bandook variant, called “Dark Caracal”, were attributed to the Lebanese General Security Directorate.\n\nSome of this campaign’s characteristics and similarities to previous campaigns leads us to believe that the activity we describe in this report is\nindeed the continuation and evolution of the infrastructure used during the Dark Caracal operation:\n\nThe use of the same certificate provider (Certum) throughout the various campaigns.\nThe use of the Bandook Trojan, in what appears to be a unique evolving fork from the same source code (which is not known to be\npublicly available). Samples from the Dark Caracal campaign (2017) utilized around 100 commands, compared to the current 120\ncommand version we analyzed.\nThis wave of attacks shares the same anomalous characteristics for targeted attacks – an extreme variance in the selected targets, both\nin their industry and their geographic spread.\n\n[Finally, EFF researchers who first disclosed the Dark Caracal operation also believe that the same attacker “is back at it” again.](https://twitter.com/cooperq/status/1123114038211170305)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[All evidence points to our belief that the mysterious operators behind the malicious infrastructure of “Operation Manul” and “Dark Caracal” are](https://www.eff.org/wp/operation-manul)\nstill alive and operational, willing to assist in the offensive cyber operations to anyone who is willing to pay.\n\nAlthough not as capable, nor as practiced in operational security like some other offensive security companies, the group behind the\ninfrastructure in these attacks seems to improve over time, adding several layers of security, valid certificates and other techniques, to hinder\ndetection and analysis of its operations.\n\n[Check Point SandBlast
