Despite extensive analysis by security\nprofessionals, little has changed, and as of 2024, new insights continue to emerge about the\nKinsing operation, providing strategies for security teams to better mitigate associated risks.\n\nSince its initial appearance, Kinsing’s modus operandi has largely remained unchanged. It\ntypically exploits vulnerable or misconfigured applications, executes an infection script, runs\na cryptominer—often concealed by a rootkit—and maintains control over the server using the\nKinsing malware. However, it raises the question: What precisely is Kinsing? Is it the name of the\nmalware, the threat actor behind it, or both? Our research indicates that there is more to learn\nabout this significant threat.\n\nOrganizations that learn from past interactions and adapt to the ever-changing threat landscape\nare better equipped to counter the enduring threat posed by Kinsing and similar adversaries. This\nreport provides:\n\n- An acknowledgment that defenders have less time than anticipated to address vulnerabilities\nand must take further steps to protect their environments.\n\n- A detailed list of the applications and environments targeted by Kinsing.\n\n- An in-depth analysis of Kinsing’s techniques, tactics, and procedures.\n\n- An examination of changing attack trends, the evolution of attack patterns, and the rapid\nincorporation of new vulnerabilities upon their discovery.\n\nUnderstanding Kinsing’s history is fundamental for devising effective defense strategies. Although\nregular software updates, and vigilant monitoring are critical for mitigating risks and guarding\nagainst this persistent threat, these measures alone are insufficient. Implementing runtime\nbehavioral controls to enhance a defense-in-depth strategy is crucial. The historical data on the\nKinsing malware highlights the continuous need for alertness, resilience, and collaboration within\nthe cybersecurity community.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\nTo provide an accurate sense of the interest in Kinsing, a search for “kinsing” on Google yields\nover 180,000 results. Google Trends indicates that interest in Kinsing began in 2019, with\nthe most significant spike in January 2020, followed by notable peaks in October 2021 and\nSeptember 2023. These spikes correspond to various reports about specific applications\ntargeted by Kinsing, such as Openfire.\n\n###### What Exactly is Kinsing?\nIs it the moniker of the malware, the threat actor, or both, as some articles suggest? Despite\nnumerous reports, our research reveals that there is still significant information to be added to the\nbody of knowledge.\n\nThe most effective way to understand threat actors’ campaigns is to comprehensively review\navailable reports online. This was our initial step. Although we have been tracking Kinsing\ncampaigns since their inception in 2019, we aimed to assimilate all possible insights from the\ncybersecurity community. We carefully analyzed select publications from our colleagues in the\nindustry. Some of these works are exceptional pieces of research that illuminate various facets of\nKinsing’s activities. Nevertheless, we sensed that the full picture was not yet complete. Our review\nallowed us to consolidate our understanding of Kinsing.\n\nTrustedSec was the first to report on Kinsing, on January 15, 2020, detailing an attack that\nexploited CVE-2019-19781 against Citrix NetScaler for remote code execution. Until this report,\nthe connection between the Citrix attack and Kinsing had not been made. However, we managed\nto retrieve the ci.sh script from Kinsing’s current C2 server, maintaining access even as the\nthreat actor frequently changed download servers throughout our investigation. This script\nremained on the download server, unlike some (e.g., rv.sh) that were omitted from newer server\nversions. Alibaba Cloud’s security team, often credited as the initial reporters on Kinsing, followed\non January 16, 2020, referring to it as h2Miner.\n\n[Our team, Aqua Nautilus, was the first to name the malware “Kinsing” in a report in April 2020](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/threat-alert-kinsing-malware-container-vulnerability/)\n— a name that has since been widely adopted. The first known attack was actually against our\nmisconfigured Docker API on December 15, 2019. Other reports corroborate that December 2019\nmarked Kinsing’s emergence in its current campaign.\n\nIn November 2020, TrendMicro published a thorough report analyzing Kinsing’s rootkit. The\nresearchers provided an in-depth analysis of both the download script and the rootkit. Our\nanalysis confirmed their findings regarding the rootkit’s structure and functionality.\n\nIn September 2021, CyberArk published a detailed comparison between the NSPPS malware and\nKinsing malware, highlighting significant similarities in code structure, RC4 encryption keys, and\nfunction names, while also noting some differences. Their conclusion was that despite these\ndifferences, the similarities indicate that both malwares belong to the same family. NSPPS seems\nto be an earlier version with remote access Trojan (RAT) functionality, while Kinsing is a more\nrecent variant with added cryptomining features and other functionalities. These similarities aid\nresearchers in the analysis and detection process.\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout Kinsing’s active period (2019-23), many publications have detailed specific attacks\ntargeting a variety of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and environments. These include:\n\n      - [Liferay CVE-2020-796 (Redteam PL)](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/06/kinsing-malware-liferay.html)\n\n      - [Unauthenticated Redis servers (TrendMicro)](http://www.trendmicro.com)\n\n      - [Oracle WebLogic CVE-2020-14883 (Akamai)](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/Kinsing-evolves-adds-windows-to-attack-list)\n\n      - [Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 (Zscaler)](http://https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/threatlabz-analysis-log4shell-cve-2021-44228-exploit-attemptshttp://)\n\n      - [Confluence - CVE-2022-26134 (Lacework)](https://www.lacework.com/blog/kinsing-dark-iot-botnet-among-threats-targeting-cve-2022-26134/)\n\n      - [Citrix ADC - CVE-2019-19781 and SaltStack - CVE-2020-11651/2 (Red Canary)](https://redcanary.com/blog/kinsing-malware-citrix-saltstack/)\n\n      - [Kubernetes (Microsoft)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/initial-access-techniques-in-kubernetes-environments-used-by/ba-p/3697975)\n\n      - [Apache Nifi (Sans), and many others.](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Your+Business+Data+and+Machine+Learning+at+Risk+Attacks+Against+Apache+NiFi/29900http://)\n\n[In addition, comprehensive reports like the one from Cysiv have linked several vulnerabilities,](https://www.forescout.com/resources/kinsing-cloud-cryptojacker/)\nshowcasing the breadth and depth of Kinsing’s exploits.\n\nWhile we can’t cover every blog, this selection highlights the wealth of write-ups, knowledge,\nand interest in Kinsing. Its persistent presence across our various honeypots piqued our curiosity.\nWe started to probe deeper, asking questions like whether Kinsing is the work of a single threat\nactor or if its source code was leaked, leading to its widespread use. We inquired about Kinsing’s\noperations, target scope, primary objectives, infrastructure details, the possibility of it being a\nbotnet (as it appeared in some publications), and more. We didn’t find a singular answer.\n\nThe infrastructure choices that we observed when gathering information may suggest a\nconnection to Russian-speaking countries, which could imply Russian origins for the threat actor,\nwhile the frequent targeting of Chinese servers could suggest Chinese origins.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\nIn the Russian language, “Kinsing” doesn’t translate directly to anything meaningful. The name\nseems to be derived from English phonetics and is unrelated to any Russian words.\n\nIf we were to search for a phonetic similarity in Russian, we could dissect it: “Kin” has no\nstandalone meaning, but phonetically it could relate to “кин,” a root for Russian verbs associated\nwith throwing or motion, such as “кинуть” (to throw). “Sing” phonetically resembles “синг,” which\nis meaningless in Russian. However, “синий” translates to “blue.” Thus, “kinsing” could whimsically\ntranslate to “blue throw,” which is nonsensical.\n\nSimilarly, examining Mandarin for phonetic matches, “Kin” could resemble “金” (jīn), meaning\n“gold,” or “金星” (jīnxīng), meaning “Venus,” the planet. “Sing” doesn’t match directly with\nMandarin, but a similar sound, “星” (xīng), means “star.” Hence, “Kinsing” might whimsically be\ninterpreted as “golden star,” an interpretation we find more appealing. That said, if you know of a\nbetter significance for Kinsing, we encourage you to contact us.\n\nThis report represents our endeavor to explore and address the questions surrounding Kinsing.\nWith the help of the community, we aim to uncover answers and foster a deeper understanding of\nthe issue. In this paper, we detail the infrastructure and operations of Kinsing, analyze the targets,\nand present insights from forum discussions by those who have experienced the impact of Kinsing\nfirsthand. Our goal is to compile all pertinent information into this comprehensive report, serving\nas a valuable resource for anyone with an interest in Kinsing or those who have been affected by\nits activities.\n\n\nIf we were to search for a phonetic similarity in Russian, we could dissect it: “Kin” has no\nstandalone meaning, but phonetically it could relate to “кин,” a root for Russian verbs associated\nwith throwing or motion, such as “кинуть” (to throw). “Sing” phonetically resembles “синг,” which\nis meaningless in Russian.

Drawing on various\npublications, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how Kinsing has\noperated over the past four years.\n\nIn the second section, we delve into the artifacts associated with Kinsing. Here, we enumerate all\nthe scripts, binaries, and exploits detected in the wild, drawing on data from our honeypots, other\npublications, and an extensive investigation of the Kinsing infrastructure.\n\nThe third section presents our analysis of a Kinsing malware sample that we collected.\n\nIn the fourth section, we offer an analysis of a rootkit sample used in the Kinsing campaign, which\nwe also collected.\n\n##### Kinsing’s Architecture\n\nThe Kinsing campaign has been operational since 2019, and over this period, many publications\ndetailing its activities have surfaced. These include in-depth analyses of specific attacks or tools,\nas well as comprehensive reports linking multiple attacks. However, there’s a noticeable absence\nof a thorough write-up that encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, addresses all components,\nand provides a complete overview of Kinsing’s architecture. In this section, we aim to examine the\nattack infrastructure and operations of Kinsing, thereby elucidating its architecture.\n\nFigure 1: Kinsing’s Openfire Campaign\n\n**Victim server**\n\n**5.  Runs a cryptominer**\n**hidden by rootkit**\n\n**3.  Runs a memory** **4.  Encrypted**\n**resident malware** **communication**\n\n**Kinsing’s scan** **Vulnerable** **Kinsing’s C2**\n**server** **Openfire** **server**\n\n**Kinsing’s**\n**Download server**\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\nWe have identified three primary components in the Kinsing campaigns:\n\nScan and exploit servers: The initial server is responsible for scanning vulnerabilities and\nexploiting them. It boasts advanced scanning capabilities, likely employing tools such\n## 1\nas masscan, and possibly has access to server databases such as Zoomeye or Shodan.\nWhile the Kinsing malware includes masscan capabilities, there’s no definitive proof that\nthe threat actor actively uses this tool.\n\nDownload servers: These servers act as an intermediary for downloading binaries and\nscripts. For instance, the threat actor uses one IP address to download the main payload,\n## 2\na script that then fetches the Kinsing malware and, occasionally, a rootkit. From another\nserver, the Kinsing malware downloads a Monero cryptocurrency miner.\n\nCommand and control (C2) servers: The final element, the C2 server, manages\ncommunication with compromised servers. After deployment, the Kinsing malware\n## 3\nconnects with these servers. Historically, from April 2019 to August 2020, the threat actor\ncommunicated directly using an IP address. However, from August 2020 to October 2020,\nthe Kinsing operator started using the vocaltube.ru website for C2 interactions.\n\nFigure 2: the website under the domain vocaltube.ru (c2 server)\n\nThis site was registered in August 2020, with the first related VirusTotal event noted in October\n2020. This shift in architecture might be a strategy for defense evasion, or it could suggest that\nthe website was compromised. Although the precise purpose of its usage is unclear, DNS\nrequests for vocaltube.ru have been detected, along with IP-based communications between the\nC2 server and the victim’s machine.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n|Ukraine 20 %|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Netherlands 10 %|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Russia 68 %||\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|L|uxembourg 2 %|\n\n\nWe analyzed the communication with the C2 server. Over three years, we found very little change\nin the IP address of the C2 server. When 185.154.53.140 is resolved when vocaltube.ru is queried.\n\n# C2 IP Address Country ISP Usage in the attacks\n\n1 185.154.53.140 Russia EuroByte LLC 39.4%\n\n2 212.22.77.79 Russia Cloud Solutions LLC 38.2%\n\n3 185.221.154.208 Russia EuroByte LLC 22.3%\n\n4 93.189.46.81 Russia Limited Liability Company NTCOM 0.031%\n\n5 109.248.59.253 Russia Russia High Speed Online LLC 0.010%\n\n6 194.169.160.157 Russia Ztv Corp LLC 0.010%\n\n7 185.224.212.104 Russia 2Day Telecom LLP 0.003%\n\nThe group of IP addresses used to download the scripts and binaries was a bit bigger (41) and\ndistributed mostly among Eastern European countries:\n\nGraph 1: Geo-location distribution of ‘Download servers’\n\nUkraine 20%\n\nNetherlands 10%\n\nRussia 68%\n\nLuxembourg 2%\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n##### Kinsing’s Attack Tools\n\nWe conducted an extensive analysis of the Kinsing C2 artifacts’ download server over four weeks.\nDuring this time, we observed that Kinsing frequently replaced its download servers. To gain\na deeper understanding of the threat actor’s intentions and what they aimed to expose on the\ninternet as part of their campaign, we executed several queries.\n\nThe following are some key stats and insights we gathered during this period:\n\nThe campaign has been active since 2019 and\ncontinues to operate.\n## 1\n\nThe core components of the attack include the Kinsing malware and\na cryptocurrency miner.\n## 2\n\nThree distinct groups of artifacts\nare identified.\n## 3\n\nThe campaign targets\n75 different applications.\n## 4\n\nEach week there was a new script that exploited a new remote code\nexecution (RCE) vulnerability.\n## 5\n\nKinsing targets applications and infrastructure across the entire cloud software\ndevelopment life cycle (SDLC).\n## 6\n\nKinsing targets various operating systems with different tools. For instance, Kinsing\noften uses shell and Bash scripts to exploit Linux servers. We’ve also seen that Kinsing is\n## 7\ntargeting Openfire on Windows servers using a PowerShell script. When running on Unix,\nit’s usually looking to download a binary that runs on x86 or arm.\n\nMost targeted applications\n(91%) are open source.\n## 8\n\nWhile Kinsing mainly targets runtime applications (67%) it also targets various other\nareas in cloud native environments, such as CI/CD (Jenkins), APIs (Kubernetes, Docker\n## 9\ndaemon), and code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Sankey diagram of the campaign year OSS or not and targeted cloud environment.

They share common functions, such as downloading attack\ncomponents, eliminating competing malware, and evading detection.\n\nHowever, there are notable differences. Type I scripts resemble a lengthy grocery list, appearing\nas a patchwork of snippets that include competition elimination and defense evasion tactics\naccumulated over time. In contrast, Type II scripts are more succinct, comprising only 454 lines\ncompared with the 825 lines in Type I scripts, making them about half the size. As shown in Graph\n2, Type I scripts primarily focus on eliminating competition (76%) and dedicate less to defense\nevasion. Type II scripts, however, place greater emphasis on defense evasion, both in terms of the\npercentage of the script dedicated to this and the actual number of code lines, primarily through\ndeploying a rootkit.\n\nInitially, we hypothesized that the differences between these script types were due to their age,\npresuming that Type I scripts were older than Type II. As supporting evidence, we saw that most\nof the recently written scripts were affiliated with the Type II group. However, this wasn’t the case.\nWe also considered the nature of the targeted systems but found that both scripts target the\nsame applications, such as Laravel and Postgres. Therefore, the exact reason for the existence of\ntwo script types remains known only to the threat actor.\n\nType I scripts start with #!/bin/sh while Type II scripts start with #!/bin/bash. While these\nmight seem like minor textual differences, they actually represent a huge difference. When\ncomparing two servers, one using sh (the Bourne shell) and the other using bash (the Bourne\nAgain shell), there are several key differences to consider in terms of tools, features, and\nprivileges. Bash is an enhanced and extended version of 55 T sh, so it includes all the features\nof sh plus additional functionalities. For instance, Type II scripts, (designed to run on Bourne Again\nshell, bash) end with `history -c, which typically isn’t a built-in command in the Bourne shell`\n(sh).\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\nAnother point of interest is the 75% decrease in the volume of snippets aimed at eliminating\ncompetition between Type I and Type II scripts. This raises several questions: Is there less\ncompetition among attackers on certain applications, or has the overall competition in the cloud\ndiminished over time? Has Kinsing shifted its focus from battling for server control to enhancing\nits scan-detect-infect capabilities? Or has it become agnostic to competition, which might impede\nits main goal of mining operations and increase the risk of detection. It’s also possible that the\nthreat actor initially included an abundance of snippets to eliminate any competition, but over\ntime, they refined their approach, tailoring it to specific campaigns and cloud-native environments.\n\nGraph 2: Type I scripts composition of goal,\nbased on snippet analysis\n\n\n##### 4.2%\n\n\nKill Competition\nSupport Attack\nDefense Evasion\n\n##### 76.4%\n\n\n##### 19.4%\n\n\nGraph 3: Type II scripts composition of goal,\nbased on snippet analysis\n\n\n##### 53.3%\n\n\nKill Competition\nSupport Attack\nDefense Evasion\n\n##### 11%\n\n 35.7%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Binaries\n\nThese 12 binaries are dropped during different stages and types of attacks. Some (kinsing and\n```\nkdevtmpfsi) appear in almost all of the attacks, while others support specific needs in specific\n\n```\nservers.\n\nBinaries: b, curl-aarch64, curl-amd64, kinsing, kinsing_aarch64, kinsing2,\n```\nlibsystem.so, LifExp.class, xmrig.exe, and kdevtmpfsi\n\n```\nKinsing binaries: The binaries `kinsing, kinsing2, kinsing_aarch64 and b are all the`\nkinsing malware, as described below in the “Kinsing Malware” section.\n\nThe cryptominers: The binaries xmrig.exe, kdevtmpfsl, x, x2, x_arm and x2_arm are\nall an `xmrig miner, as described below in the “Kinsing’s Mining Campaign” section.`\n\nThe binary lifexp.class: This is an exploit of the Liferay RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-7961).\n\nFigure 4: the Liferay exploit\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n##### Attack Volume\n\nUpon analyzing the Kinsing campaigns against our honeypots, we discerned varying attack\ntrends. Some honeypots were assaulted dozens of times daily, while others experienced only\nseveral attacks. On average, honeypots were targeted by Kinsing eight times per day, with the\nnumber of attacks ranging from three to 50. For example, our misconfigured Docker API honeypot\nfaced an average of 50 attacks daily, fluctuating from hundreds to several daily. This pattern was\nconsistent with other honeypots. Our Jenkins honeypot underwent an average of 0.2 to 13 attacks\nper day, depending on the month, while PostgreSQL encountered between 0.8 and 60 daily\nattacks on average.\n\nThese attacks varied across specific software types, suggesting that the Kinsing threat actor\nis continually shifting targets, focusing on particular applications at different times. When new\nvulnerabilities are disclosed, they naturally become a priority, but they may also gain increased\nattention months later.\n\nOur Shodan search revealed 2.5 million instances of the various applications targeted, indicating\nthat Kinsing’s scanning operation is probing millions of instances.\n\nOur research indicates that the Kinsing threat actor incorporates new vulnerabilities upon their\nrelease. Over three months, we observed Kinsing targeting five new vulnerabilities as soon as\nthey were included in the attack scripts.\n\n##### Kinsing Malware\n\nIn September 2021, CyberArk published “Kinsing: The Malware with Two Faces,” a wonderful blog\nthat analyzes the binary of Kinsing while comparing it with another malware family: NSPPS. We\ntook this analysis as a baseline for our analysis and compared the differences.\n\nIn their blog, CyberArk found several samples of Kinsing. One of the samples\n(SHA256: d247687e9bdb8c4189ac54d10efd29aee12ca2af78b94a693113f382619a175b) was\nanalyzed thoroughly and considered as a baseline in the blog. CyberArk noted that the binary\nweighed 16.87 mb. Other samples were found to be smaller, weighing 5 to 6 mb. The researcher\nspeculated that the difference in size between the various samples in the wild may have stemmed\nfrom Kinsing testing various versions of the malware or researchers only published partial part of\nthe binaries they analyzed.\n\nIn our work we tested our database to understand how many samples of kinsing we had. We\nfound 1,550 distinct binaries that bear the name kinsing or kinsing%%%%% (when % is a\nrandom digit or letter).\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n\n### 62.70%\n###### of the attacks\n\nSHA256\n5d2530b809fd069f97b30a5938d471dd2145341b5793a70656aad6045445cf6d\n\n### 27.98%\n###### of the attacks\n\nSHA256\n787e2c94e6d9ce5ec01f5cbe9ee2518431eca8523155526d6dc85934c9c5787c\n\n### 0.23%\n###### of the attacks\n\nSHA256\n564739ea8fa5926d4fa5c9734fed462061960a22e6b8d5c06e94969d97891bf2\n\n### 0.09%\n###### of the attacks\n\nSHA256\n631d0eac8278f4c8090dcc89c905eebdac5ad03db6cf33be1f0a5a39ce6fff1a\n\n### 0.09%\n###### of the attacks\n\nSHA256\nd14b31a0e14615badab1ffcd6086c36f32c21a0cd40df93843efd42295e451bd\n\nAs seen above, the top five samples appeared in the various attacks covering more than 90% of\nall the attacks we’ve seen. That means that the most interesting samples are 5d253 and 787e2.\nWe focused on the first sample and compared it with the findings in CyberArk’s report to learn\nabout the changes in the kinsing binary over time.\n\nThe first distinguished difference is in terms of size. As mentioned above, sample d2476 was\n16.87 mb, while our sample 5d253 was 6.02 mb. When reviewing the differences between the two\nsamples, we see that the main functionality cited in the CyberArk report remained the same. One\nof the main differences was that the older version used pkger, which is a tool for embedding static\nfiles into Go binaries. These functions can’t be found in the newer versions.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\nWhen inspecting what is calling this function you can see that it’s called to use the file ‘x’.\n\nFigure 5: Downloading the cryptominer and renaming it to `kdevtmpfsi`\n\nNext, it’s written to /tmp under the name kdevtmpfsi, which is obviously the cryptominer, so in\nthe older version of kinsing the malware contained an embedded version of the cryptominer\nthat was used.\n\nWe now have a new hypothesis to raise to compete with or challenge the one raised by CyberArk\nresearchers. It could be that the threat actor was looking to or did test the use of a binary with the\ncryptominer embedded inside. It looks like it did catch – probably not then (because we know that\nkinsing MO is to download the cryptominer from a remote source) and definitely not now because\nwe see de facto that most of the binaries weight 5 to 6 mbs.\n\nWe found various functions that appear in both files. One of them is gopsutil. In the older\nkinsing, the version is v2.19.10, while in the newer it’s v3.21.11.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, we also inspected the kinsing dynamically. Using Tracee, an open source runtime\nsecurity tool, we collected network logs and monitored the communication. As seen in the table\nbelow, these are the C2 communication recorded:\n\n# URL Request Additional Goal Response\nType Input\n\n1 /i GET Set log OK\n\n2 /l POST Data Sends log data to C2 OK\nserver\n\n3 /r POST Sends results OK\n\n4 /o POST “{“Id”:802, Send Exec output OK\n\nData”:””}” to C2 server\n\n5 /s POST “{ “User”:”jFcypPQo”, Send new SOCKS5 OK\n\n“Pass”:”AcFAYwAE”, server’s user/pass/TCP\n“Port”:31119 }” port to C2 server\n\n6 /ms POST “{“Pid”:0}” Send miner’s process OK\nID\n\n7 /mg GET Checks if the cryptominer 301 or\nis running and provides The PID number example:\nthe PID of the miner “{“Pid”:0}”\n\n8 /ki POST Request kill process data Example:\n\n{“Exe”: [“app/Cli”, “.perf.c”,\n“perfctl”, “kthreaddi”,\n“kthreaddk”, “xmrig”,\n<<TRUNCATED>>\n“atlas.x86”, “dotsh”],\n“Files”: [], “Lol”: [“lol”]}\n\n9 /h2 GET Health/connectivity OK\ncheck\n\n10 /get GET Fetch the next “task” Example:\nfrom C2 server {“Id”:802,\n\n“Type”:”download_and_\nexec”,\n“Progress”:227960,\n“Total”:1254856, “Thread”:1,\n“Port”:1, “Timeout”:1,\n“Data”:\nhttp[:]//194[.]38.22.53/spre.\nsh\n}\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n##### Kinsing’s Mining Campaigns\n\nThe main goal of Kinsing is to mine Monero. It does this by running a version of XMRIG. Over the\nyears, we haven’t seen any significant changes in this binary.\n\nWe analyzed the miner processes and found that it used the wallet 44MtPEE…\n\n\nFigure 6: the cryptominer configuration\n\n\nFigure 7: the cryptominer mining blocks\n\n\nWe inspected the wallet over two months and estimated that its average annual revenue would\nbe 18 XMR, or 3,100 USD, which is quite modest for this kind of operation. It could be that we’ve\nfailed to understand the full scope of the mining operation.\n\nFigure 8: Kinsing’s wallet activity\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n##### Kinsing’s Rootkits\n\nIn the Type II scripts, a rootkit is downloaded and executed to conceal the presence of Kinsing’s\nattack components on the infected system.\n\nFigure 9: Altering LD_preload by Kinsing\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 9, the rootkit is installed into the /etc/libsystem.so directory. Then,\nthe /etc/ld.so.preload file is manipulated to ensure that the rootkit is loaded early in the\nprocess startup sequence, even before standard libraries like libc.so. This technique ensures that\nthe rootkit is deeply embedded and hard to detect.\n\n###### Technical Analysis of the Rootkit\n\nThe rootkit contains encrypted lists of what to hide and how to hide it, including specific files\nand network connections. It hooks into various system functions to control what’s visible and\nwhat isn’t. For example, it can hide its own process files and network connections from system\nmonitoring tools.\n\nThe rootkit specifically targets files and processes related to the Kinsing malware (like kinsing,\n```\nkdevtmpfsi, and lib_system.so) and makes them invisible to normal system inspection tools.\n\n```\nRootkits often hook into various system functions to manipulate the behavior of an operating\nsystem, often for malicious purposes like hiding their presence or the presence of other malware.\nHere’s an elaboration on what each of the listed functions typically does and how a rootkit might\nmanipulate them:\n```\n     access: Checks user’s permissions for a file. Kinsing’s rootkit hooks various files to\n\n## 1 return that these files (kinsing, kdevtmpfsi, etca) don’t exist.\n\n###### rmdir: Removes a directory. Kinsing’s rootkit could intercept commands aimed at\n```\ndeleting certain directories like those containing malware components.\n## 2\n\n###### open: Opens a file. Kinsing’s rootkits might hook this to hide the opening of certain\nfiles or to intercept and modify data being read from or written to a file.\n## 3\n\n###### readdir / readdir64: Reads directory entries. Kinsing’s rootkit can manipulate\nthese functions to hide specific directories or files from directory listings.\n## 4\n\n```\n         access: Checks user’s permissions for a file. Kinsing’s rootkit hooks various files to\n\n## 1 return that these files (kinsing, kdevtmpfsi, etca) don’t exist.\n\n###### rmdir: Removes a directory. Kinsing’s rootkit could intercept commands aimed at\n```\ndeleting certain directories like those containing malware components.\n## 2\n\n###### open: Opens a file. Kinsing’s rootkits might hook this to hide the opening of certain\nfiles or to intercept and modify data being read from or written to a file.\n## 3\n\n###### readdir / readdir64: Reads directory entries. Kinsing’s rootkit can manipulate\nthese functions to hide specific directories or files from directory listings.\n## 4\n\n\n-----\n\ng g q,,\n\n```\n         stat / stat64 and __xstat / __xstat64: Retrieves information about a file.\n\n```\nKinsing’s rootkit might alter the results to hide file modifications or the existence of\n## 5\ncertain files.\n\n###### lstat / lstat64 and __lxstat / __lxstat64: Similar to stat, but for symbolic\nlinks. Kinsing’s rootkit can manipulate these to hide or change information about links,\n## 6\nespecially those pointing to malicious files.\n\n###### fopen / fopen64: Opens a file and returns a file stream. Kinsing’s rootkit might hook\nthis to control access to specific files or to manipulate file contents.\n## 7\n\n###### link: Creates a new hard link to an existing file. Kinsing’s rootkit could use this to\ncreate unauthorized links to sensitive files or to protect malware files.\n## 8\n\n###### unlink: Deletes a name from the filesystem. If a name was the last link to a file and\nno processes have the file open, the file is deleted. Kinsing’s rootkit might intercept this\n## 9\nto prevent deletion of certain files.\n\n###### unlinkat: Similar to unlink, but can operate on a directory file descriptor. Kinsing’s\nrootkit might hook this to protect specific files or directories from being deleted.\n## 10\n\nBy hooking these functions, the kinsing rootkit can effectively control how the operating system\ninteracts with files, directories, and file information. This allows the rootkit to hide its presence\nand the presence of other malware, manipulate file operations, and maintain persistence on the\ninfected system. Such manipulations can be very challenging to detect and remove.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning [TrendMicro’s excellent analys is from 2020, and since it’s exactly the same](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/k/analysis-of-kinsing-malwares-use-of-rootkit.html)\nhash value:\n\n(SHA256=C38C21120D8C17688F9AEB2AF5BDAFB6B75E1D2673B025B720E50232F888808A)\nwe can conclude that the Kinsing threat actor is satisfied with this tool and thus invested no\nattention to improve the rootkit over these past three years.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\n\n### Kinsing’s Targets\n\nTargets can be categorized into two groups: the applications and environments that Kinsing\ntargets, and the personal accounts of the victims encountered in the wild. In this chapter, we\npresent an analysis of both aspects.\n\n##### Applications that Kinsing Targets (Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations)\n\nOver the past five years, we’ve identified at least 75 software applications that have been\ntargeted by Kinsing. Our observations indicate that Kinsing exploits both vulnerabilities and\nmisconfigurations. For example, there are instances of misconfigured Docker APIs without\nauthentication, allowing anyone to deploy a container. In such cases, an Alpine container is\ndeployed with a malicious command that downloads and executes the script d.sh. It appears\nthat the majority of the software targeted by Kinsing is targeted because of vulnerabilities.\nNotably, the recent vulnerabilities in Openfire and RocketMQ were exploited within one to two\nweeks after their disclosure.\n\nIn Appendix 3, we provide a comprehensive list of the applications and environments targeted, as\nper our analysis. Our analysis is not exhaustive. Even with the assistance of ChatGPT, we were\nunable to complete the list of targets, as some remain unclassified. We encourage you to share\nyour insights or hypotheses regarding the potential targeted applications or environments, which\ncould help us in presenting a more complete assessment of the threat landscape.\n\nFigure 10: Kinsing’s targeted applications\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\n\n##### Kinsing’s victims in the wild (OSINT)\n\nYou can see many questions in programmers’ forums such as Stack Overflow, ask ubuntu, GitHub,\n\nand forums for a specific application that Kinsing targeted, as well as a plethora of questions in\nChinese-speaking forums.\n\nFigure 11: Initial Postgres remote code execution comand\n\nIn most cases the programmers ask\nif they were infected by a malware,\nindicating that they observe high CPU\nby Kdevtmpfsi and sometimes mention\na process by the name Kinsing. Often,\nthey add the download script evidence\nand sometimes the targeted application,\nwhich all help to build a mosaic of\nKinsing’s history over time. For instance,\nhere you can find a question about\nan unwanted PostgreSQL query. As\nillustrated in Figure 11, a table is created\nand a record with a bash command is\ninserted.\n\nFigure 12: decoded postgress payload\n\nWhile decoding the base64 is fairly\neasy, without doing so, it’s very hard to\nunderstand what’s going on here. Once\nit’s decoded, as illustrated in Figure\n12, there are some basic commands of\nprocess kill, implementation of curl and\na command to download the primary\npayload pg2.sh.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Another example taken from the Laravel forum on Reddit, as the programmer is providing some](https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/lh6r5h/psa_laravel_842_has_vulnerability_cve20213129/?rdt=37510)\nevidence of infection and how this can be detected and fixed.\n\nThese examples illustrate the justified and understandable security knowledge and experience\ngaps that programmers, data engineers and other practitioners display when facing these\ntroubling indications. The abundance of such indications also illustrates Kinsing’s scope and the\nextent of its attacks.\n\nFigure 13: A forum post about Kinsing\n\n\n-----\n\npp g g p g\n\n### Mapping Kinsing’s Campaigns to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\nOur investigation showed that Kinsing has used some common techniques throughout the\ncampaigns (further details in Appendix 2):\n\n\n-----\n\ng\n\n### Detection and mitigation\n\nKinsing targets Linux and Windows systems, often by exploiting vulnerabilities in web\napplications or misconfigurations such as Docker API and Kubernetes to run cryptominers. To\ndetect Kinsing and similar malware, one can employ a combination of methods:\n\n###### Threat intelligence\n\n - Information: Keep up to date with the latest threat intelligence reports on tactics, techniques,\nand procedures used by Kinsing operators.\n\n - Known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): such as the ones included in this report.\n\n - Awareness: Train staff to recognize signs of a compromise, such as phishing attempts that\ncould introduce Kinsing into the network.\n\n###### Vulnerability management\n\n - Patch management: Regularly update and patch systems to close off vulnerabilities that\nKinsing could exploit.\n\n - Configuration audits: Regularly audit configurations, especially for exposed services like\nDocker, to ensure they’re not misconfigured.\n\n###### Container security\n\n - Docker daemon security: Ensure the Docker daemon isn’t exposed to the internet without\nproper authentication.\n\n - Container monitoring: Implement monitoring solutions specifically designed for containerized\nenvironments.\n\n###### Behavioral analysis\n\n - Anomaly detection: Employ ystems that can learn baseline behavior and detect anomalies.\n\n - CPU and memory usage monitoring: Continuous high usage can indicate cryptomining\nactivity.\n\n - System performance monitoring: A sudden drop in system performance might suggest\nmalicious processes are running.\n\n - Unusual processes: Look for processes that aren’t typically part of the system’s operations.\n\n - Process names: Kinsing may attempt to masquerade as a legitimate process but may be\ndetected by close inspection of process names and paths.\n\n - Unusual outbound traffic: Check for an increased volume of outbound traffic, especially to\nknown mining pools.\n\n - Network connections: Look for connections to suspicious IP addresses and ports typically\nused by miners.\n\n - Unexpected changes: Monitor for unexpected changes to system files and directories.\n\n - Rootkits: Look for signs of rootkit installation that can hide malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\ng y q\n\n### Enhancing Cloud Security with  Aqua CNAPP\n\nIn today’s landscape of escalating cyber threats, organizations need to establish a\ncomprehensive multi-layered security strategy to safeguard their digital transformation. The\nAqua Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) provides robust end-to-end\nprotection for your cloud native applications, mitigating risks across the full lifecycle and\nfortifying workloads against attacks in production.\n\nTo prevent potential threats like Kinsing, proactive measures such as hardening workloads\npre-deployment are crucial. Aqua CNAPP allows security teams to detect and mitigate known\nvulnerabilities in their container images, helping prioritize patching based on many factors such\nas active exploitation in the wild and the availability of PoC (proof-of-concept) exploits. This\nsignificantly reduces the attack surface and closes off potential entry points for attackers.\n\nFigure 14: The Aqua platform fails the build when a high rank vulnerability is detected\n\n\n-----\n\ng y q\n\nWhile vulnerability scanning and timely patching play a pivotal role in prevention, ensuring runtime\nprotection is equally essential. Aqua CNAPP addresses this need with intelligence-driven runtime\nprotection and quickly deploys granular controls layered throughout your environment. Drift\nprevention seamlessly enforces the container immutability to identify and block unauthorized\nprocesses in running containers with no downtime.\n\nBeyond traditional signature-based malware detection, Aqua CNAPP offers advanced protection\nagainst unknown and zero-day threats. Leveraging real-world threat intelligence from Aqua\nNautilus, eBPF-based behavioral detection enables security teams to identify and respond to\nbehavioral anomalies that may indicate a compromise, such as manual command executions and\nlateral movements associated with Kinsing attacks.\n\nFor example, here’s how Aqua detects the Kinsing attack exploiting the Openfire vulnerability:\n\nFigure 15: Openfire vulnerability CVE-2023-32315 details in the Aqua platform\n\n\n-----\n\ng y q\n\nFigure 16: The Kinsing attack timeline in the Aqua platform\n\nFigure 17: Drift detection in the Aqua platform: The file kdevtmpfsi (a Monero cryptominer) is\ndownloaded into the container\n\n\n-----\n\ng y q\n\nAqua CNAPP offers comprehensive protection for cloud native workloads everywhere they run\n– whether in the public cloud, on-premises, or across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. By\nleveraging Aqua CNAPP, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and mitigate threats\nin real time, thereby ensuring a robust security posture even against advanced and persistent\nthreats.\n\n\nAqua Nautilus is a security research team whose mission is to analyze the evolving cloud native threat landscape, uncovering new threats targeting\ncontainers, Kubernetes, serverless, applications’ software supply chains and cloud infrastructure. The team aims to help Aqua customers and the\ncommunity at large protect against the unknown, zero-day and emerging threats, turning insights from real-world attacks into powerful, intelligence-driven\n[protection within the Aqua Platform.

They are 97% similar; the only difference is in one snippet\nresponsible for creating a cron job to download the script from the attacker’s C2 server. The\ndifference is within the name of the script, as each script calls itself. We analyzed each row in the\nscript based on three major concepts: contributing to the attack flow, defense evasion items, and\nkilling competition.\n\nType l scripts: scg.sh, sup.sh, wpf.sh, an.sh, cp2.sh, do.sh, ex.sh, hb.sh,\n```\nkn.sh, ku.sh, lf.sh, lh2.sh, lr.sh, md.sh, mo.sh, ni.sh, pa.sh, pg.sh,\nph2.sh, sa.sh, sc.sh, sp.sh, st.sh, tf.sh, tm.sh, tr.sh, vb.sh, ws.sh,\na.sh, c.sh, d.sh, f.sh, j.sh, k.sh, m.sh, n.sh, o.sh, p.sh, r.sh, s.sh,\nt.sh, w.sh, spr.sh, unk.sh\n\n###### Contributing to the attack flow\n\n```\nThese snippets are designed to facilitate the attack of Kinsing:\n\n1. Setting the kinsing file according to the server’s architecture.\n\nFigure 18: Kinsing binaries download code\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n\n2. Setting up a backdoor, by creating a cron job to download the shell script (the current main\npayload) again. In Figure 19 below, you can see that the code is designed to look in crontab\nfor the IP address. If the IP isn’t found the code is designed to download the script `wpf.sh,`\ninto crontab.\n\nFigure 19: setting a `cronjob`\n\n###### Defense evasion items\n\nThese snippets are designed to evade detection of the malicious activities:\n\n1. Stopping and deleting security tools (selinux, aegis and apparmor).\n\nFigure 20: disabling and removing security applications\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n\n2. In Figure 21 below, you can see two commands that significantly alter the security posture of\nthe victim system by removing firewall protections. The command ufw disable turns off the\nUFW firewall and stops UFW from enforcing any of its configured rules. The second command\n```\n  iptables -F, is flushing iptables rules effectively removes all filtering and forwarding rules.\n\n```\nFigure 21: disabling firewall and flushing iptables\n\n###### Killing competition\n\nThese snippets are designed to stop competitors’ malicious activities:\n\n1. Stopping processes: The snippet, in Figure 22 below, targets specific processes for termination\nwhile iterating through all entries in the /proc directory.\n\nFigure 22: iterating over /proc directory\n\n2. Killing processes: In Figure 23 below, there are few examples of commands aimed at detecting\nspecific processes or IP addresses or text in files in order to kill the relevant processes, which\nare all part of competitors’ campaigns.\n\nFigure 23: terminating competing attacks\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n\n##### Type II Scripts – comprehensive analysis\n\nWe analyzed 27 type II scripts. Like the Type I scripts, these scripts bear 97% similarity. We\nanalyzed each row in the script based on 3 major concepts: contributing to the attack flow,\ndefense evasion items and killing competition.\n\nType II scripts: `lr2.sh, pg2.sh, tr2.sh, vml.sh, se.sh, ae.sh, ap.sh, bg.sh,`\n```\nce.sh, cf.sh, cp.sh, ge.sh, gi.sh, gl.sh, ki.sh, lh.sh, mi.sh, mt.sh,\nph.sh, py.sh, rm.sh, sm.sh, vm.sh, xx.sh, kos.sh, tc.sh, acb.sh\n\n```\nBelow we will cover only the differences from Type I scripts.\n\n###### Contributing to the attack flow\n\n1. Implementing a curl function in case curl, wget or other utilities aren’t installed on the\nserver.\n\nFigure 24: implementing a curl application\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n\n###### Defense evasion items\n\n1. Deploying a rootkit to hide the malicious processes. You can read more about it in the rootkit\n\nsection in the main section of the report.\n\nFigure 25: rootkit download and deployment code\n\n###### Killing competition\n\n1. Extended list of specific processes for termination while this snippet is iterating through all the\nentries in the /proc directory (compared with Type I scripts).\n\n2. The long list of process kills is now divided into functions, as can be seen in Figures 26 and 27\nbelow:\n\nFigure 26: cleaning cron from competing attacks Figure 27: eliminating competing attacks\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n\n##### Auxiliary scripts analysis\n\nThese 14 scripts are often dedicated to specific applications that are dropped and executed as\npart of the attack kill chain and set a specific purpose. In this section we review each of these\nscripts.\n\nAuxiliary scripts: cron.sh, al.sh, 1.ps1, ci.sh, du.sh, rv.sh, cpr.sh, cpu.sh,\n```\nuninstall.sh, wbw.xml, wb.xml, k.xml, kk.xml, ll.sh\ncron.sh\n\n```\nThis script contains 161 rows that are designed to kill the competition (see Type I or Type II scripts\nabove), a few lines of defense evasion, and persistence by creation of a cron job that downloads\nand runs the script unk.sh, which is a Type I script, possibly standing for “unified Kinsing.”\n```\nal.sh\n\n```\nThis script is designed to disable and remove specific security and monitoring components related\nto Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud services from a Linux system, as can be seen in Figure 20.\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\nThe PowerShell 1.ps1\n\n```\nThis PowerShell script appears to be involved in downloading, installing, and executing a\ncryptominer on the host system.\n\nThe script sets up a number of variables for URLs, file sizes, and names related to a\ncryptocurrency miner (xmrig.exe) and its configuration file (config.json)\n\nThe script checks if the miner executable and its configuration file exists at the specified paths. If\nthey do, it checks their sizes against the expected sizes and updates them if they don’t match. If\nthe files don’t exist, the script downloads them using the update function. Next, the PowerShell\nchecks if the miner process is running. If it’s not running, it starts the miner process in a hidden\nwindow.\n\nFigure 28: some snippets from the powershell\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\nci.sh\n\n```\nThis is actually not an auxiliary script. It’s a script that launches an attack on the Citrix NetScaler\napplication. As opposed to Type I and Type II scripts, there are three different cron jobs to ensure\npersistence on the Citrix server.\n\nFurthermore, in this case, Kinsing malware isn’t downloaded. This is the most distinct signature of\nthis threat actor yet, but in this case another binary is downloaded by the name of klli\n(MD5 568f7b1d6c2239e208ba97886acc0b1e). This, however, is found on the Kinsing download\nserver and thus we affiliate this attack with the Kinsing campaigns.\n\nFigure 29: From the ci.sh script\n```\ndu.sh\n\n```\nThe initial script is encoded (base64).\n\nFigure 30: the du.sh script\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n\nWhen decoded, the script seems to be designed to ensure that only one instance of a process\nnamed kinsing that is using the file /tmp/linux.lock is running. If there are multiple such\nprocesses, it kills all of them except the one using the file.\n\nFigure 31: The decoded script\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\nrv.sh\n\n```\n[This is an open-source reverse shell script that can be found on GitHub - here.](https://github.com/lukechilds/reverse-shell)\nAs illustrated in Figure 32 below, the Kinsing threat actor modified the script to open a reverse\nshell to a server under his control.\n\nFigure 32: the rv.sh script, a reverse shell script\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\ncpr.sh\n\n```\nThis script looks like it’s cleaning Kinsing from the server. Maybe it’s a revert script to clean\nKinsing from an infected system or a preparation script before cp, to prepare the server for\ninfection.\n\nFigure 33: the cpr.sh script\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\nuninstall.sh\n\n```\nThis script is very similar to the al.sh script which cleans the defense controls of Alibaba Cloud.\n\nFigure 34: the uninstall script\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\nwb.xml and wbw.xml\n\n```\nThese two xml files seem to have the same purpose. Both are designed to exploit the Oracle\n[WebLogic Server RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-14883. On Linux servers the wb.sh shell script is](https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2020/cve-2020-14883/)\ndropped and executed.\n\nFigure 35: Weblogic Linux exploiting script\n\nOn Windows machines, a PowerShell (1.ps1) is dropped and executed.\n\nFigure 36: Weblogic Windows exploiting script\n```\nk.xml and kk.xml\n\n```\nThe purpose of these payloads is to exploit XML parsers that are vulnerable to XML external\nentity attacks. If the attack is successful, the attacker can read the contents of the `/opt/`\n###### zimbra/conf/localconfig.xml or ../conf/localconfig.xml file by examining the value of\nthe wocaq entity. This can lead to information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data or\nconfigurations.\n\nFigure 37: k.xml exploit\n\nFigure 38: kk.xml exploit\n\n\n-----\n\npp p y p\n```\nll.sh\n\n```\nThis is an extended snippet that appears both in Type I and Type II scripts. It’s a list of specific\nprocesses for termination while this snippet is iterating through all the entries in the /proc\ndirectory. It could be that the Kinsing threat actor often updates this snippet and thus created an\nexternal script to support a frequent content update.\n\nFigure 39: iterating over /proc
