We believe this action will have a\nsignificant impact on Glupteba's operations. However, the operators of Glupteba are likely to\nattempt to regain control of the botnet using a backup command and control mechanism that\nuses data encoded on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nGlupteba is known to steal user credentials and cookies, mine cryptocurrencies on infected\nhosts, deploy and operate proxy components targeting Windows systems and IoT devices.\nTAG has observed the botnet targeting victims worldwide, including the US, India, Brazil and\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nThe Glupteba malware family is primarily distributed through pay per install (PPI) networks\nand via traffic purchased from traffic distribution systems (TDS). For a period of time, we\nobserved thousands of instances of malicious Glupteba downloads per day. The following\nimage shows a webpage mimicking a software crack download which delivers a variant of\nGlupteba to users instead of the promised software.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample cracked software download site distributing Glupteba\n\nWhile analyzing Glupteba binaries, our team identified a few containing a git repository URL:\n“git.voltronwork.com”. This finding sparked an investigation that led us to identify, with high\nconfidence, multiple online services offered by the individuals operating the Glupteba botnet.\nThese services include selling access to virtual machines loaded with stolen credentials\n\n\n-----\n\n(dont[.]farm), proxy access (awmproxy), and selling credit card numbers (extracard) to be\nused for other malicious activities such as serving malicious ads and payment fraud on\nGoogle Ads.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of a cryptocurrency scam uploaded to Google Ads by Glupteba services\n\nThis past year, TAG has been collaborating with Google’s CyberCrime Investigation Group to\ndisrupt Glupteba activity involving Google services. We’ve terminated around 63M Google\nDocs observed to have distributed Glupteba, 1,183 Google Accounts, 908 Cloud Projects,\nand 870 Google Ads accounts associated with their distribution. Furthermore, 3.5M users\nwere warned before downloading a malicious file through Google Safe Browsing warnings.\n\nIn the last few days, our team partnered with Internet infrastructure providers and hosting\nproviders, including Cloudflare, to disrupt Glupteba’s operation by taking down servers and\nplacing warning interstitial pages in front of the malicious domain names. During this time, an\nadditional 130 Google accounts associated with this operation were terminated.\n\nParallel to the analysis, tracking, and technical disruption of this botnet, Google has filed a\nlawsuit against two individuals believed to be located in Russia for operating the Glupteba\nBotnet and its various criminal schemes. Google is alleging violations under the Racketeer\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act, the Lanham Act, and tortious interference of\nbusiness relationships, and unjust enrichment.\n\nWhile these actions may not completely stop Glupteba, TAG estimates that combined efforts\nwill materially affect the actor’s ability to conduct future operations.\n\n## Glupteba’s C2 Backup Mechanism\n\nThe command and control (C2) communication for this botnet uses HTTPS to communicate\ncommands and binary updates between the control servers and infected systems. To add\nresilience to their infrastructure, the operators have also implemented a backup mechanism\nusing the Bitcoin blockchain. In the event that the main C2 servers do not respond, the\ninfected systems can retrieve backup domains encrypted in the latest transaction from the\nfollowing bitcoin wallet addresses:\n\n['1CgPCp3E9399ZFodMnTSSvaf5TpGiym2N1' [1]](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1CgPCp3E9399ZFodMnTSSvaf5TpGiym2N1)\n['15y7dskU5TqNHXRtu5wzBpXdY5mT4RZNC6’ [2]](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/15y7dskU5TqNHXRtu5wzBpXdY5mT4RZNC6)\n['1CUhaTe3AiP9Tdr4B6wedoe9vNsymLiD97' [3]](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1CUhaTe3AiP9Tdr4B6wedoe9vNsymLiD97)\n\nThe following 32 byte AES keys for decryption are hard coded in the binaries:\n\n'd8727a0e9da3e98b2e4e14ce5a6cf33ef26c6231562a3393ca465629d66503cf'\n\n\n-----\n\n1bd83f6ed9bb578502bfbb70dd150d286716e38f7eb293152a554460e9223536\n\nThe blockchain transaction’s OP_RETURN data can be decrypted using AES-256 GCM to\nprovide a backup command and control domain name. The first 12 bytes of the\nOP_RETURN contains the IV, the last 16 bytes the GCM tag, while the middle section is the\nAES-256 GCM encrypted domain. Full details of Glupteba’s network protocol can be found in\nthis [report from 2020, the following Python script illustrates how one can decrypt an](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/glupteba_final-1.pdf)\nencrypted domain name:\n\n## IOCs\n\nRecent domains used for command and control:\n\nnisdably[.]com\nrunmodes[.]com\nyturu[.]com\nretoti[.]com\ntrumops[.]com\nevocterm[.]com\niceanedy[.]com\nninhaine[.]com\nanuanage[.]info\n\nRecent sha256 hashes of malware samples:\n\ndf84d3e83b4105f9178e518ca69e1a2ec3116d3223003857d892b8a6f64b05ba\neae4968682064af4ae6caa7fff78954755537a348dce77998e52434ccf9258a2\na2fd759ee5c470da57d8348985dc34348ccaff3a8b1f5fa4a87e549970eeb406\nd8a54d4b9035c95b8178d25df0c8012cf0eedc118089001ac21b8803bb8311f4\nc3f257224049584bd80a37c5c22994e2f6facace7f7fb5c848a86be03b578ee8\n8632d2ac6e01b6e47f8168b8774a2c9b5fafaa2470d4e780f46b20422bc13047\n\n\n-----\n\n03d2771d83c50cc5cdcbf530f81cffc918b71111b1492ccfdcefb355fb62e025\ne673ce1112ee159960f1b7fed124c108b218d6e5aacbcb76f93d29d61bd820ed\n8ef882a44344497ef5b784965b36272a27f8eabbcbcea90274518870b13007a0\n79616f9be5b583cefc8a48142f11ae8caf737be07306e196a83bb0c3537ccb3e\ndb84d13d7dbba245736c9a74fc41a64e6bd66a16c1b44055bd0447d2ae30b614\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
