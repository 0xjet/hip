We discovered the Simps Botnet\nbinaries downloaded via shell script sample and Remote Code Execution vulnerability\nexploits by Gafgyt - [detailed in our earlier post.](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/mirai-code-re-use-in-gafgyt)\n\nBased on our analysis and threat intelligence, we have the following observations:\n\n[Simps Botnet binary uses Mirai and Gafgyt modules for DDOS functionality](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/mirai-code-re-use-in-gafgyt)\nThe Botnet might be in the early stages of development because of the presence of the\ninfected.log file after execution\nThe author behind this Botnet has a Youtube channel and Discord Server for the usage\nand demonstration of the Botnet\nThe Youtube channel and the historical data provided evidence that Simps Botnet is\nactive since April 2021\nThe Discord server discussions and threat intel data provided us evidence of the\n[possible association of Simps Botnet to Keksec group](https://www.lacework.com/the-kek-security-network/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis post will cover details on our discovery, threat intelligence data attributing relations to\nKeksec group, working of the binaries and the code similarity, and reuse modules of Simps\nBotnet.\n\n## Discovery of Simps Botnet\n\nDuring the first week of May 2021, the Uptycs’ threat research team detected a shell script\nand Gafgyt malware downloading Simps binaries from the same C2- 23.95.80[.]200.\n\n## Shell script downloading Simps binary\n\nThe shell script (hash:\n**c2d5e54544742b7a1b04cf45047859a10bb90c6945d340120872f575aa866e6d), ‘ur0a.sh’**\nwas downloaded from the C2 URL 23.95.80[.]200.\n\nThe script downloaded several next stage payloads for several *nix architectures from the\nopen directory named “Simps” in the same C2 URL from where the shell script was\ndownloaded (see Figure 1)\n\n**_Figure 1:_** _Malicious Shell script dropping payloads_\n\nThe script performs the following:\n\n1. Uses Wget to fetch the payloads from 23.95.80[.]200 in simps directory to tmp.\n2. Changes permission using chmod.\n3. Deletion of the payloads using the command rm.\n\nOn execution of the Simps binary, it drops a log file containing that the device has been\ninfected with malware by Simps Botnet (see Figure 2)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Dropped log file_**\n\nThe binary also connects to the C2 23.95.80[.]200 (see figure 3)\n\n**_Figure 3: C2 communication_**\n\n## Gafgyt downloading Simps binary\n\nDuring this same time, Gafgyt binary (hash:\n**e847dfbd831df6015519d03d42ada8241ce1174e9bd96f405452627617229c63) was also**\ndownloading Simps binary from the same C2 URL. The Simps payload was delivered by\nexploiting multiple Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities in vulnerable IOT devices. An\nexcerpt of Realtek and Linksys router exploits downloading the next stage payloads. (see\nFigure 4 and 5)\n\n**_Figure 4: Linksys router exploit_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Realtek router exploit_**\n\nBoth these exploits downloaded a Simps MIPS UPX packed binary (hash **6d18b433183fc68cd7b731fed198732d3460a21afba53163f059152bd410b55f), for MIPS**\narchitecture which also displays a message that the device has been infected by Simps\nBotnet (see Figure 6)\n\n_Figure 6: Simps ELF execution_\n\n## Simps Botnet - Youtube channel and Discord server\n\nWhile looking into the historical data of our threat intelligence systems and passive DNS\nrecords, we identified several malicious URLs (hash in IOCs section below) downloading a\nshell script named ur0a.sh and containing Simps next stage payloads. Another commonality\nwas the Simps Botnet infection log message. Searching for these common entries led us to a\nYouTube video titled “Simps Botnet😈, Slamming!!!”, created by a user named “itz UR0A''\ncreated on 24 April 2021 (see Figure 7)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Youtube video demo of Simps Botnet**\n\nThe Youtube link also contained a Discord server link of “UR0A”, which was also present in\nthe infection log. (see Figure 8)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: Simps Botnet Discord server**\n\n## Keksec attribution with Simps Botnet\n\nThe Discord server contained several discussions around DDOS activities and Botnets\ncarrying different names. One binary we identified in a chat conversation named gay.x86\n(hash: e258a284d5cad584a14df27f022c99515de1cec69ab3157640d1ce7584c50ecd).\nUpon execution, it displayed a message that the system is pawned by md5hashguy (see\nFigure 9)\n\n**_Figure 9: Discord message_**\n\n[We also came across another Gafgyt malware from a Joesandbox report, that contained the](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/397461/0/pdf)\nInfected By Simps Botnet ;) message. This malware dropped a file name\n“keksec.infected.you.log” that contained a message “youve been infected by urmommy,\nthanks for joining keksec..” (see Figure 10)\n\n**_Figure 10: keksec.infected.you.log file_**\n\nInterestingly, the same Discord server also contained an users named “urmommy” and\n“698a20e0da24bcebca57f09b7d695f8d#2881” who actively involved in DDOS activities and\nBotnet discussions. All this data gathered tied reactions Simps Botnet and the Discord server\n[users related to Keksec group. This group is also referred as Kek Security, which according](https://nsfocusglobal.com/freakout-analysis-report-1/)\nto NSFOCUS is a group which operates HybridMQ-keksec, a Botnet created with Trojan\nprograms. HybridMQ-keksec is a DDoS Trojan program obtained by combining and\nmodifying the source code of Mirai and Gafgyt.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: TCP flood module of Simps and Mirai**\n\n**Figure 12: UDP flood module of Simps and Mirai**\n\nSimilarly, Simps binaries also have the Valve source Engine and OVH modules which were\n[also seen in a variant of Gafgyt that targeted Huawei and Asus Routers and killed its rival IoT](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/gafgyt-targeting-huawei-and-asus-routers-and-killing-off-rival-iot-botnets)\nBotnets. The code similarity of the Valve source Engine module used by Simps was similar to\nGafgyt. (see Figure 13)\n\n**Figure 13: VSE attack module of Simps and Gafgyt**\n\n## Uptycs EDR Detections\n\n[Uptycs’ EDR capabilities, armed with YARA process scanning, detected Simps downloader](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/fast-consolidated-and-context-rich-detections-from-uptycs-will-keep-security-analysts-sane)\nshell-script activity (See Figure 13) and the Simps ELF binary with a threat score of 10/10\n(See Figure 14).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 14: Shell script detection**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 15: Simps binary detection**\n\nAdditionally, [Uptycs’ EDR also detects the outbound connection of the malware C2 URLs via](https://www.uptycs.com/solutions/endpoint-detection-and-response)\nour threat intelligence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur research initially started with the discovery and analysis of Simps Botnet binaries used\nfor DDOS activities. Using [Uptycs’ EDR, threat intelligence data and Open-source](https://www.uptycs.com/solutions/endpoint-detection-and-response)\nintelligence (OSINT) we were able to tie relations and attribute Simps Botnet to the Keksec\ngroup. The Uptycs threat research team has reported the associated Discord server, Youtube\nand Github links to the concerned entities. We will continue to monitor the developments of\nthis group and share updates.\n\nWe recommend the following measures for enterprise users and administrators to identify\nand protect against such attacks\n\n[Regularly monitor the suspicious processes, events, and network traffic spawned on](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/linux-commands-and-utilities-commonly-used-by-attackers)\nthe execution of any untrusted binary / scripts.\nAlways be cautious in executing shell-scripts from unknown or untrusted sources.\nKeep systems and firmware updated with the latest releases and patches.\n\n**For more on IOC's, URL's and YARA, see below after the break**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Want to learn more about how Uptycs EDR can improve security transparency in your hybrid cloud environment?
