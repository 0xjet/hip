The most notorious of these gangs have extorted huge sums of money from their](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/blackmatter-ransomware-analysis-the-dark-side-returns/)\nvictims, by charging for decryption of data or by holding the data itself to ransom against the threat of publication on their ‘leak’ websites.\n\n[With the income of such tactics sometimes running into the millions of dollars, such as with the Netwalker ransomware that generated 25](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/take-a-netwalk-on-the-wild-side/)\nmillion USD between 1 March and 27 July 2020, we speculate that much of those ill-gotten funds are subsequently used to build and maintain\narsenals of offensive cyber tools, allowing the most successful cybercriminals to stay one step ahead of the chasing pack\n\nFigure 1. Babuk group looking for a corporate VPN 0-Day\n\n**Figure 1. Babuk group looking for a corporate VPN 0-Day**\nAs seen in the image above, cybercriminals with access to underground forums and deep pockets have the means to pay top dollar for the\ntools they need to continually generate more income, with this particular Babuk operator offering up 50,000 USD for a 0-day targeting a\ncorporate virtual private network (VPN) which would allow easy access to a new victim.\n\n## The Lowly-Paid Don’t Necessarily Stay That Way\n\nFor smaller ransomware operators, who do not have affiliation with a large group, the technical skills to create their own devastating malware\nor the financial muscle to buy what they need, the landscape looks rather different.\n\nUnable to build equally effective attack chains, from initial access through to data exfiltration, their opportunities to make illegal profits are far\nslimmer in comparison to the behemoths of the ransomware market.\n\nAway from the gaze of researchers who typically focus on the larger ransomware groups, many individuals and smaller groups are toiling in\nthe background, attempting to evolve their own operations any way they can. One such method we have observed is through the use of leaks,\nsuch as the recent online posting of Babuk’s builder and source code.\n\nFigure 2. Babuk builder public leak on Twitter\n\n**Figure 2. Babuk builder public leak on Twitter**\n\nFigure 3. Babuk source code leak on underground forum\n\n**Figure 3. Babuk source code leak on underground forum**\nMcAfee Enterprise ATR has seen two distinct types of cybercriminal taking advantage of leaks such as this. The first group, which we presume\nto be less tech-savvy, has merely copied and pasted the builder, substituting the Bitcoin address in the ransom note with their own. The\nsecond group has gone further, using the source material to iterate their own versions of Babuk, complete with additional features and new\npackers.\n\nThus, even those operators at the bottom of the ransomware food chain have the opportunity to build on others’ work, to stake their claim on a\nproportion of the money to be made from data exfiltration and extortion.\n\n## ATR’s Theory of Evolution\n\n\n-----\n\na a u e ded cated to abu a so a e t gge ed a e sa p e up oaded o us ota, c b gs us to ou o y pa d a so a e\nactor.\n\nFrom a quick glance at the sample we can deduce that it is a copied and pasted binary output from Babuk’s builder, with an edited ransom\nnote naming the version “Delta Plus”, two recovery email addresses and a new Bitcoin address for payments:\n\nFigure 4. Strings content of “Delta Plus” named version of Babuk\n\n**Figure 4. Strings content of “Delta Plus” named version of Babuk**\nWe’ve seen the two email recovery addresses before – they have been used to deliver random ransomware in the past and, by using them to\npivot, we were able to delve into the actor’s resume:\n\nThe first email address, retrievedata300@gmail.com, has been used to drop a .NET ransomware mentioning “Delta Plus”:\n\nFigure 5. Strings content of .NET ransomware related to previous Delta ransomware activities\n\n**Figure 5.

Registry value modifications to disable Windows Defender\n\n**Figure 12. Registry value modifications to disable Windows Defender**\nOther domains where files are hosted contain different tools used during attack operations:\n\nWe’ve found two methods employed by the operator, which we assume to be used for initial access: First, a fake Flash Player installer\nand, secondly, a fake Anydesk remote tool installer used to drop the ransomware. Our theory about Flash Player initial access has been\nconfirmed by checking the IP that hosts most of the domains:\n\nFigure 13. Fake Flash website used to download fake Flash installer\n\n**Figure 13. Fake Flash website used to download fake Flash installer**\nWhen logging in, the website warns you that your Flash Player version is outdated and tries to download the Fake Flash Player installer:\n\nFigure 14. JavaScript variables used to drop fake Flash Installer\n\n**Figure 14. JavaScript variables used to drop fake Flash Installer**\nA secondary site appears to have also been utilized in propagating the fake Flash Player, though it is currently offline :\n\nFigure 15. JavaScript function to download the fake Flash Installer from another website\n\n**Figure 15. JavaScript function to download the fake Flash Installer from another website**\n\nPortable Executable (PE) files used to launch PowerShell command lines to delete shadow copies, exclude Windows Defender and\nimport registry keys from “Update.reg.rar” to disable Windows defender.\nA PE file used for several purposes: Exfiltrating files from the victim, keylogging, checking if the system has already been held to ransom,\ngetting system information, obtaining user information and to create and stop processes.\n\nFigure 16.\n\nFigure 17. Functions and C2 configuration from ransomware sample\n\n**Figure 17. Functions and C2 configuration from ransomware sample**\n(host used for extraction)\n\nIn addition to the above, we also found evidence that this actor tried to leverage another ransomware builder leak, Chaos ransomware.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe majority of domains used by this actor are hosted on the same IP: “24.152.38.205” (AS 270564 / MASTER DA WEB DATACENTER\nLTDA).\n\nBut as we saw by “analyzing” the extraction tool used by the actor, another IP is mentioned: “149.56147.236” (AS 16276 / OVH SAS). On this\nIP, some ports are open, such as FTP (probably used to store exfiltrated data), SSH, etc.\n\nBy looking at this IP with Shodan, we can get a dedicated hash for the SSH service, plus fingerprints to use on this IP, and then find other IPs\nused by the actor during their operations.\n\nBy using this hash, we were able to map the infrastructure by looking for other IPs sharing the same SSH key + fingerprintings.\n\nAt least 174 IPs are sharing the same SSH pattern (key, fingerprint, etc.); all findings are available in the IOCs section.\n\nSome IPs are hosting different file types, maybe related to previous campaigns:\n\nFigure 18. Open Directory website probably used by the same actor for previous campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n**gu e** **8 Ope** **ecto y** **ebs te p obab y used by t e sa** **e acto** **o p e** **ous ca** **pa g s**\n\n## Bitcoin Interests\n\nMost of the ransomware samples used by the actor mention different Bitcoin (BTC) addresses which we assume is an effort to obscure their\nactivity.\n\nBy looking for transactions between those BTC addresses with CipherTrace, we can observe that all the addresses we extracted (see the\ncircle highlighted with a yellow “1” below) from the samples we’ve found are related and eventually point to a single Bitcoin wallet, probably\nunder control of the same threat actor.\n\nFrom the three samples we researched, we were able to extract the following BTC addresses:\n\n3JG36KY6abZTnHBdQCon1hheC3Wa2bdyqs\n1Faiem4tYq7JQki1qeL1djjenSx3gCu1vk\nbc1q2n23xxx2u8hqsnvezl9rewh2t8myz4rqvmdzh2\n\nFigure 19. Follow the money with CipherTrace\n\n**Figure 19. Follow the money with CipherTrace**\n\n## Ransomware Isn’t Just About Survival of the Fittest\n\nAs we have seen above, our example threat actor has evolved over time, moving from simplistic ransomware and demands in the hundreds of\ndollars, to toying with at least two builder leaks and ransom amounts in the thousands of dollars range.\n\nWhile their activity to date suggests a low level of technical skill, the profits of their cybercrime may well prove large enough for them to make\nanother level jump in the future.\n\nEven if they stick with copy-pasting builders and crafting ‘stagers’, they will have the means at their disposal to create an efficient attack chain\nwith which to compromise a company, extort money and improve their income to the point of becoming a bigger fish in a small pond, just like\nthe larger RaaS crews.\n\nIn the meantime, such opportunitistic actors will continue to bait their hooks and catch any fish they can as, unlike affiliated ransomware\noperators, they do not have to follow any rules in return for support (pentest documentation, software, infrastructure, etc.) from the gang’s\noperators. Thus, they have a free hand to carry out their attacks and, if a victim wants to bite, they don’t care about ethics or who they target.\n\nThe good news for everyone else, however, is the fact that global law enforcement isn’t gonna need a bigger boat, as it already casts its nets\nfar and wide.\n\n## Mitre Att&ck\n\n|Technique ID|Technique Description|Observable|\n|---|---|---|\n|T1189|Drive By
