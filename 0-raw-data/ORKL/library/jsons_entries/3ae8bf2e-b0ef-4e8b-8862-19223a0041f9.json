Naver is a popular South Korean online platform comparable\nto Google, that offers a variety of services (e.g., email, news, and search, among many others). For this\nreason, a large cache of valid credentials for Naver is potentially very valuable: it can provide access to the\npersonal Naver accounts of a wide variety of victims while also providing access to several other enterprise\nlogins as a result of password reuse. Two intriguing facets of this investigation quickly became apparent to\nPACT’s analysts: the sheer volume and focus of malicious activity by a single entity, focused exclusively on\nharvesting Naver credentials (more than 500 domains), and substantiated overlaps with infrastructure\nhistorically associated with WIZARD SPIDER (a Russia-based, financially-motivated threat actor involved in\ninitial access and ransomware operations). This overlap is significant because it may indicate a current\ngeographic targeting preference by one of the most active cyber crime groups in existence and would provide\nvaluable insight into that group’s operational workflow. However, PACT’s analysis unearthed additional\ncircumstantial evidence supporting previous assessments that posit an emerging, top-tier “infrastructure as a\nservice for cybercriminals”. This potential service, if it exists, would explain the WIZARD SPIDER overlap as\nwell as PACT’s additional findings.\n\n**Update: 30 MAR 2022**\n\n[Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) published a report on 24 Mar 2022 titled, Countering threats from North Korea.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/)\nIn this report, TAG details the operations of North Korean state-backed threat actors engaged in active exploitation of a\nRCE vulnerability in Google Chrome. TAG lists several domains they assess are owned by the threat actors, one of\nwhich is “disneycareers[.]net”. This domain immediately caught PACT’s attention, as it was one of the anomalous\nfindings we documented in our initial report (below). To quickly summarize: PACT identified this (apparently unrelated)\ndomain hosted on dedicated infrastructure that was primarily being used to host extensive Naver-themed phishing\nactivity. Two weeks ago (see update to this blog on 18 Mar 2022), Google TAG published their assessment that an\nInitial Access Broker (IAB) with ties to the Conti ransomware gang was using this infrastructure as well. Prior to that,\nRiskIQ and Microsoft had identified at least three distinct clusters of activity (WIZARD SPIDER, zero-day exploitation\nused to deploy unique Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads, and initial access tooling like BazarLoader and Emotet). PACT\nconsiders it notable and highly unusual that multiple research teams have observed such a wide spectrum of activity\noccurring on this infrastructure: phishing, initial access operations, targeted ransomware, and state-backed espionage\nhave all been well documented.\n\nTAG’s disclosure of additional domains allowed PACT’s analysts to conduct additional pivots. Further overlaps were\nindeed observed, but generally amounted to additional “ancillary evidence” (to borrow a phrase from RiskIQ): 5 domains\npublished by TAG were linked to PACT’s previous findings via pDNS, but all these previous resolutions were part of\nshared hosting infrastructure that cannot be definitively tied to a single actor or customer. However, PACT found the\nlevel of overlap noteworthy: over 80 domains listed as part of the Cobalt Strike infrastructure documented by RiskIQ\nwere linked to the following 5 domains from TAG’s report: chainnews-star[.]com,  gbclabs[.]com,blockchainnews[.]vip,\ngiantblock[.]org, ziprecruiters[.]org. The pDNS overlaps formed by these domains is in addition to the current overlap\nseen with disneycareers[.]net, which TAG assesses is part of the recent North Korean-backed Chrome exploitation\nactivity and hosted on what multiple vendors have assessed to be non-public IP “172.93.201[.]253”. This same IP was\nthe first critical node identified in PACT’s investigation, as a large number of Naver-themed phishing pages with a\ncommon registrant resolved to this IP.\n\nAdditional feedback from the information security community (hat tip to Zetalytics) turned PACT onto what we assess to\nbe an additional node in this dedicated infrastructure: “23.82.19[.]179”. PACT identified 38 new*/previously-unknown\nNaver-themed phishing domains after identifying this IP address. 21 previously-known Naver-themed domains were\nseen resolving to both this IP as well as “23.81.246[.]131”, which formed the initial link between the Naver credential\nphishing activity and the reported WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure. Further strengthening PACT’s assessment that\n“23.82.19[.]179” is a part of this cluster of malicious infrastructure is the fact that registrant persona\n“gameproducters@outlook[.]com” registered all newly-identified domains; this same registrant was identified in PACT’s\noriginal reporting. Threat Actor TTP overlaps were also observed and provided added confidence: IP “23.82.19[.]179”\n[serves HTTP/302 redirects to Naver-themed phishing pages hosted on 000webhostapp.com, which was a technique](https://urlscan.io/result/816c5773-d7b3-4017-9056-60a283e19989/)\nPACT observed previously. Furthermore, this IP is part of Leaseweb, Inc.’s US-based dedicated hosting infrastructure,\nwhich PACT identified as the actor’s preferred vendor and geographic location.\n\n*note: PACT included these 38 newly-identified domains in the IOC annex of our report, below.\n\nIn summary, the publication of additional information surrounding this infrastructure has led to further uncertainty. The\nonly assessment of near certainty that can be made in light of recent research is that there is a definite nexus of\nmalicious use around this infrastructure. Recent reporting has not altered PACT’s initial assessment of moderate\nconfidence: an as-yet unreported criminal hosting service exists on this infrastructure. The wide variety of malicious\nactivity and distinct operational goals, initially observed by Microsoft and RiskIQ, deserve special attention and analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Update: 18 MAR 2022_**\n\nGoogle’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) published a blog on 17 Mar 2022 titled, _Exposing initial access broker with ties to_\n_Conti. In this report, TAG references the findings of both Microsoft’s MSTIC and RiskIQ’s Team Atlas that PACT also_\nreferences below, and builds on the hypotheses and findings of all firms involved in the tracking and analysis of the\ncriminal enterprise unfolding across the infrastructure that PACT details in our report. TAG identifies and names a\nThreat Actor (EXOTIC LILY) operating as an Initial Access Broker (IAB) on this infrastructure. They also corroborate\nmany previous findings: use of this infrastructure to deploy common tooling centered around a financially-motivated\nnexus and an association with WIZARD SPIDER. To quote TAG: “Initial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths\nof the security world, and it’s a full-time job.”\n\nPACT used the indicators that TAG published to identify additional overlaps in an effort to provide further value to the\nsecurity community. PACT analysts found circumstantial evidence and TTP overlaps that, taken together, serve to\nreinforce previous research and strengthen the common intelligence picture. Overlaps such as the threat actor’s\nhosting provider preference (Leaseweb USA, Inc): several IPs from this hosting provider’s network appeared as critical\nnodes in PACT’s investigation. There was also CDN hosting overlap seen via pDNS sources: TAG identified\n“modernmeadow[.]co” as one of the “recent domains used in email campaigns,” and PACT identified that it shared\n[resolutions with Akamai IPs along with “yeruje[.]com”. RiskIQ had previously identified this domain as a C2 for the](https://community.riskiq.com/article/c88cf7e6)\nunique Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 Profile that they fingerprinted and tracked as part of the activity cluster exploiting\nCVE-2021-40444. Additional TTP overlaps were seen in how the threat actor’s core infrastructure does not appear to be\ncommercial shared web hosting, as there are no historic resolutions; and in how they use self-signed certificates. The\nthreat actor’s predilection for avoiding WHOIS Privacy services, leaving unredacted registrant information available for\nresearchers, was also observed in some of the domains that TAG provided. These observable TTPs were noted by\nPACT in our initial publication.\n\nWhen overlaid with PACT’s pre-existing research, TAG’s findings reinforce our own: the operations of EXOTIC LILY\n“appear to be closely linked” with the deployment of Conti ransomware. The operational requirements of an IAB would\ncertainly explain the activity that PACT observed: the robust domain name buildup targeting Naver. An IAB would need\nto send many emails and design spear-phishing messages that seemed convincing and credible to potential victims;\nthey would also be required to maintain the level of resilience required to sustain operations in the face of domain\nattrition caused by phishing protection services. TAG’s assessment that EXOTIC LILY appears to operate as a distinct\nentity that utilizes shared infrastructure reinforces PACT’s assessment that “this infrastructure appears to support\nseparate, discrete campaigns; it also supports operational mechanisms along multiple links of the killchain.” PACT lacks\nthe visibility to confirm that EXOTIC LILY is the group operating the Naver-themed phishing on this infrastructure, but\nthe criminal nexus of the infrastructure itself is now well documented. This infrastructure, and its intended use, certainly\nmatch the needs of an initial access broker; when paired with the overlap to known WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure, it\nsupports the hypothesis that this may be the same threat actor.\n\n**Part I: Introduction & Context**\n\nIn September of 2021, [RiskIQ’s Team Atlas and Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) jointly](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/wizard-spider-windows-0day-exploit/)\npublished technical reports on a cluster of malicious activity that exploited CVE-2021-40444, a vulnerability in\nMSHTML that allows remote code execution on a victimized Windows system. The operational roots of this\nactivity reportedly began in February of 2021. Both RiskIQ and Microsoft observed significant overlap in the\nnetwork infrastructure used in this campaign with network infrastructure associated with WIZARD SPIDER.\nWIZARD SPIDER (aka UNC1878) is a large, Russia-based, criminal enterprise that has operated the Trickbot,\nBazar, and Anchor families of malicious Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and has been observed deploying the\nConti and Ryuk ransomware families in “Big-Game Hunting” campaigns that target large enterprises.(1,2,3) The\noverlaps that Microsoft and RiskIQ observed were related to supporting infrastructure, in the form of non-public\nIP addresses, used by WIZARD SPIDER as Command and Control (C2) nodes for Cobalt Strike, which the\ngroup used as a post-intrusion tool prior to the deployment of Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Additional overlap\nwas seen via domain registrant information (specifically the registrant email address) provided when\npurchasing the domains used to create TLS certificates (thus enabling TLS encryption for the Cobalt Strike C2\ntraffic between victim and attacker).\n\nRiskIQ’s Team Atlas provided an exhaustive list of IP addresses and TLS certificates (and their associated\ndomain names) that were attributed to WIZARD SPIDER’s C2 infrastructure [here.](https://community.riskiq.com/article/c88cf7e6)\n\nThis list provided PACT with the ability to cross reference and corroborate the Naver-themed phishing activity\nthat PACT observed with WIZARD SPIDER’s operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note, however, that both research teams observed anomalies during their investigations that\nindicate this overlap may not be indicative of an operation by WIZARD SPIDER, but may instead be indicative\nof multiple actors using the same network infrastructure. This overlap could be caused by multiple operators\nexploiting known compromised hosts, a “form of command-and-control infrastructure as a service for\ncybercriminals”, or some other shared resource not owned by a single threat actor .4\n\nFast forward 4 months: during the conduct of routine investigation and analysis of malicious web-based\n[infrastructure, PACT identified a domain of interest (mailmangecorp[.]us) via a tweet by](https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1484584370320994305) [Joe Slowik. With this](https://twitter.com/jfslowik)\ninitial finding, PACT analysts began methodically illuminating a network of targeted phishing infrastructure\ndesigned to harvest valid login credentials for Naver. The Naver Corporation operates a large, regional, and\npopular online platform that provides dozens of customer-facing services (e.g., email, search, social, payment)\nand can be compared to a South Korean Google. While investigating the hosting infrastructure being used to\nserve the Naver-themed phishing pages, PACT analysts identified overlaps with the WIZARD SPIDER\ninfrastructure, mentioned above, from RiskIQ’s and Microsoft’s joint reporting. This blog will detail PACT’s\nfindings and methodology, the noted overlaps with WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure, as well as key takeaways\nthat may shed new light on the alternate hypotheses put forward by both Microsoft and RiskIQ.\n\n**Part II: Findings**\n\n_IIa: Naver-themed Phishing Activity_\n\nBy the end of PACT’s investigation, 542 unique domains had been identified as part of this malicious cluster of\nweb infrastructure, 532 of which were assessed with high confidence to be part of the ongoing phishing\ncampaign targeting Naver logins; the oldest domain identified by PACT was registered in August of 2021, other\nregistrations are as recent as February of 2022. The remaining domains were of unknown provenance, part of\npreviously reported historic malicious infrastructure that PACT tracked as part of this cluster, or were otherwise\nanomalous but related via linkages in hosting or registration. The full list of 532 Naver-themed phishing\ndomains are included in the annex to this report.\n\nThe “critical nodes*” of PACT’s investigation turned out to be IP addresses and, when available, domain\nregistrant personas (identified and tracked by the registration email address used to register the domain). The\nfirst critical node identified was IP 172.93.201[.]253; it quickly became apparent to PACT’s analysis that a large\nnumber of Naver-themed phishing pages with a common registrant (mouraesse@gmail[.]com) resolved to this\nIP.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 1: Numerous domains registered by mouraesse@gmail[.]com resolved to 172.93.201[.]253_\n\n_*note: PACT defines “critical nodes” as entities on a graphical link analysis chart that were instrumental in_\n_identifying connections between several, otherwise distinct, clusters of entities and activity._\n\nThis IP also provided the first glimpse of a recurring TTP (tactic, technique, or procedure) that PACT identified\nas an indicator to strengthen confidence in clustering this activity together: HTTP/302 redirects to spoofed\nNaver login pages on Hostinger’s web hosting platform “000webhostapp[.]com”, as seen below –\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 2: Naver-themed domain hosted on IP 172.93.201[.]253 displaying an HTTP/302 redirect to a spoofed_\n_Naver login page on “000webhostapp[.]com”:_\n\nPivoting on the registrant email “mouraesse@gmail[.]com” allowed PACT to identify that several domains\nregistered with this email address were seen resolving to another IP address, 23.81.246[.]131. This IP address\nbecame a critical node in PACT’s investigation and formed the initial link between the Naver credential phishing\nactivity with the alleged WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure. However, before we detail our findings on these\nobserved overlaps, there are additional critical nodes that are wholly within the distinct cluster of Naver-themed\nphishing activity:\n\nRegistrant email addresses “peterstewart0326@gmail[.]com” and “kimkl0222@hotmail[.]com”, which\nappear to have been used jointly and by the same actor, registered over 100 Naver-themed phishing\ndomains.\nRegistrant email addresses “tree99111@hotmail[.]com” and “jhonsteven0001@hotmail[.]com”, which also\nappear to have been used jointly and by the same actor, registered 69 domains, some of which had\npreviously resolved to critical node 23.81.246[.]131.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 3: Persona behind email addresses “peterstewart0326@gmail[.]com” and “kimkl0222@hotmail[.]com”_\n_shown along with Naver-themed domain registrations and the associated resolutions._\n\nIP addresses:\n\n23.83.133[.]196:\n\nPart of ASN 19148 (LeaseWeb USA, Inc.), along with critical node 23.81.246[.]131\nLinked via pDNS resolutions to many domains registered by the “kimkl0222@hotmail[.]com /\npeterstewart0326@gmail[.]com” actor\n198.244.135[.]244:\n\nPart of ASN 16276 (OVH SAS), along with critical node “15.235.132[.]77”, seen below\nLinked via pDNS resolutions to many domains registered by the “kimkl0222@hotmail[.]com /\npeterstewart0326@gmail[.]com” actor\nDisplayed TTP overlap (IP seen serving HTTP/302 redirects to Naver phishing pages):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 4: critical node IP address 198.244.135[.]244 observed serving HTTP/302 redirects, a TTP overlap with_\n_the Naver-phishing actor_\n\n15.235.132[.]77\n\nPart of ASN 16276 (OVH Singapore PTE.

Additionally,\ndespite all 5 IP addresses having little information available in public scan data, they all appear to be Windows\nmachines running self-issued TLS certificates.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also important for the reader to note the common usage of the HTTP 302 Redirect in order to funnel\nvictims to the intended page. PACT observed HTTP 302 Redirects to both additional Naver-themed phishing\ndomains (seen in Image 4, above) and also to several Naver-themed phishing subdomains on Hostinger’s web\nhosting platform “000webhostapp[.]com”. An example appears below on critical node IP address\n23.81.246[.]131 (alongside an expired, self-signed TLS certificate):\n\n_Image 5: HTTP/302 redirect to 000webhostapp[.]com (a TTP overlap) identified on critical IP 23.81.246[.]131_\n\nThis screenshot of Shodan’s ‘host’ page for 23.81.246[.]131 (last seen date: 2022-02-15) provides insight into\nhow the phishing infrastructure can be set up, independent of the final phishing URL hosted on\n“000webhostapp[.]com”:\n\n1. Victim clicks or otherwise navigates to one of the 500+ Naver-themed domain names\n2. The DNS A-record for an arbitrary number of them is set to an IP address with a web server configured\n\nsimilar to the way that 23.81.246[.]131 is set up (with a generic, catchall HTTP 302 Redirect) to a\nsubdomain of “000webhostapp[.]com”\n3. Victim’s browser redirects them to the “000webhostapp[.]com” domain, where they are served a\n\nconvincing replica of the Naver login page.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Victim enters their credentials, which are captured and now compromised.\n\nThis setup is designed to withstand the domain attrition commonly suffered by widely-disseminated phishing\ncampaigns, which is generally caused by the phishing domains being identified, reported, and taken down or\nblocklisted. By disconnecting the final phishing URL from the initial victim-facing URL, the threat actor’s\ninfrastructure becomes more resilient. Additionally, this increases the odds that the final URLs hosting the\nphishkit will be “allowlisted” or not closely inspected (due to the fact that they’re being hosted on a legitimate\nhosting platform).\n\nPhishing for Naver credentials appears to be common, which may indicate the relative value of valid logins.\nAhnLab’s ASEC [reported on Naver phishing activity as well, but the cluster they observed appears distinct as](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/31301/)\nthe threat actor’s TTPs differed: they didn’t use tech-themed domains, they didn’t use HTTP 302 Redirects to\nfunnel victims to the final credential-gathering page, and the one-time-use number and QR code functionality\nweren’t configured. The Naver-themed phishing pages that PACT analyzed had working one-time-use number\nand QR code functionality, although we were unable to verify if users were successfully compromised using\nthese methods.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Images 6 & 7: the Naver phishing pages PACT analyzed supported one-time-password and QR code_\n_functionality_\n\nThe subdomains that PACT was able to identify on “000webhostapp[.]com” serving spoofed-Naver phishing\npages are included in the annex at the end of this report. Due to the ease with which the operator can create\nnew subdomains on this hosting platform, this list is likely outdated and/or incomplete.\n\n_IIb: Overlaps with Reported WIZARD SPIDER Infrastructure_\n\nIn section ‘IIa: Naver-themed Phishing Activity’, PACT stated that overlaps were observed between the network\ninfrastructure supporting the Naver phishing activity, and that of historic network infrastructure used by\nWIZARD SPIDER. This overlap was initially identified via IP 23.81.246[.]131 (seen in Image 5, above,\ndisplaying TTP overlap).\n\nThis IP address was initially discovered by PACT’s analysts during attempts to identify which of the 58 phishing\ndomains registered by “mouraesse@gmail[.]com” were currently resolving, if any. At the time of initial analysis,\nthe domain “navermailcorp[.]com” was resolving to “23.81.246[.]131”, which PACT further identified resulted in\nthe HTTP Redirect to a spoofed Naver login page on “*.000webhostapp[.]com”.\n\nAdditional investigation yielded two malware samples, as identified on VirusTotal, that were associated with IP\n23.81.246[.]131:\n\n_Image 8: Malicious files seen communicating with IP of interest 23.81.246[.]131_\n\n\n-----\n\nOpen source reporting identified and corroborated these malicious samples as Cobalt Strike: the extracted\n[Cobalt Strike Beacon (post-exploitation payload) configuration for one of the samples displays the same](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0b4b1f2af5257c0aa79fda9b75accef9f4d6181b6d80eea5a1740460ab8514ae/behavior/VirusTotal%20ZenBox)\n[watermark identified by a security researcher on Twitter who identified these samples as part of a cluster of](https://twitter.com/MichalKoczwara/status/1437483170077806598)\nactivity exploiting CVE-2021-40444. Additionally, the network [behavior displayed by the other sample shows](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3c3efb20dc6411dfea13dcdf9d6a4ce320cf98fb449c91948a102467a27e6cef/behavior/C2AE)\nHTTP connections to “hubojo[.]com” and “bideluw[.]com”. These two domains are important: they match the\nextracted Beacon configuration from the first sample, and they both also represent additional, discrete links to\n23.81.246[.]131:\n\n“bideluw[.]com” was observed resolving to this IP via pDNS\nRiskIQ [reported that this IP previously served the certificate for “hubojo[.]com”, tying it to a Cobalt Strike](https://community.riskiq.com/article/c88cf7e6)\nC2 server (validating the extracted Beacon configuration from VirusTotal).\n\nThese observations all serve to bolster the previous reports of an actor using this infrastructure to support a\ncampaign exploiting CVE-2021-40444 and to host Cobalt Strike.\n\nWith these historic findings in mind, PACT found it notable that more than 40 of the Naver-themed phishing\ndomains had resolved to IP 23.81.246[.]131. PACT identified numerous emergent resolutions during the\ncourse of the investigation, which suggests that this activity is ongoing and this infrastructure is currently in\nuse. PACT’s analysis continued throughout the pre-publication pipeline, identifying numerous domains\nregistered in March 2022. We will update this report as our investigation progresses and yields additional\nfindings.\n\nIn addition to the linkages provided by 23.81.246[.]131, another overlap was observed via IP 23.19.227[.]176.\nThis IP had previously been associated with “naverservice[.]host” (part of the Naver phishing cluster); however,\nit was also detailed in RiskIQ’s [report as part of the same Cobalt Strike C2 infrastructure used by the actor](https://community.riskiq.com/article/c88cf7e6)\nexploiting CVE-2021-40444. In this case, it was tied to “pawbug[.]com”, which PACT independently confirmed\nvia pDNS.\n\nIP 23.106.215[.]141 forms another link to the infrastructure detailed in RiskIQ’s report, via a link between\n“naverncorp[.]com” and “maloxob[.]com”. The domain “maloxob[.]com” was also identified as a Cobalt Strike\nC2 server. This IP address also led PACT’s analysts to another domain, cebuwu[.]com, which will be\nmentioned later in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 9: Critical overlaps between RiskIQ’s previous findings & the Naver-themed phishing activity._\n\nFurther overlaps were identified with two additional IP addresses that are likely to be shared resources**:\n\n1. 184.168.221[.]39: ties together “mailhelp[.]online” (part of the cluster targeting Naver) with\n\n“jumpbill[.]com” and “raills[.]com” (reported as Cobalt Strike C2s by RiskIQ).\n2. 195.186.208[.]193: ties together at least two of the domains seen in the Naver phishing activity\n\n(“navrcorp[.]site” & “navercorps[.]online”) and dozens of the Cobalt Strike domains reported by RiskIQ\n\n**Given the number of (apparently unrelated) resolutions recorded on these IPs, it is likely they are, or were,\nlegitimate shared hosting or another pooled resource being abused by a small number of malicious actors.\nNevertheless, the many links they formed helped increase PACT’s confidence in assessing this activity as\nrelated; therefore, PACT included them in this report.\n\n**Part III: Closing Thoughts & Key Takeaways**\n\n_IIIa. Analytic Gaps & Anomalous Findings_\n\nWhile analyzing and processing the information uncovered in this investigation, PACT identified a number of\noutliers and anomalies. They appear below in no particular order:\n\n1. The majority of the domains identified within the Naver-phishing cluster of activity were registered without\n\n_privacy protection; i.e., it was trivial for analysts to search for other domains registered with the same_\nregistrant information (e.g., email address). WHOIS Privacy and GDPR have made privacy a de facto\n[standard during the domain registration process. It is uncommon to find a cluster of activity, especially](https://www.prevailion.com/cert-safari-leveraging-tls-certificates-to-hunt-evil/)\none that is attributable to a named threat group like WIZARD SPIDER, wherein all the domain-based\ninfrastructure is unobscured by privacy protection services.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. RiskIQ s analysis provided insight into the domain generation algorithm and other TTPs of the Threat\n\nActor operating the Cobalt Strike infrastructure. This insight led PACT to make note of two domains that\naligned with RiskIQ’s assessment of the actor’s TTPs: cebuwu[.]com and lertwo[.]com. These two\ndomains overlapped with previous reporting in the following ways:\n\nThey are between six to eight alphabetic characters in length, which aligns with the Domain\nGeneration Algorithm (DGA) likely used by the threat actor(s).\nThey utilize the “.COM” top level domain (TLD).\nThe domain cebuwu[.]com used the legitimate Certificate Authority “Sectigo”.\nThe domain cebuwu[.]com was identified via 23.106.215[.]141, which also links another Cobalt\nStrike C2 domain reported by RiskIQ (maloxob[.]com) and the Naver-themed activity (via\nnaverncorp[.]com).\nLikewise, past resolutions link the domain lertwo[.]com to both the Cobalt Strike C2 activity\n(195.186.208[.]193, 195.186.210[.]241) as well as the naver activity (navrcorp[.]site,\nnavercorps[.]online, navertechp[.]online). It is likely that these resolutions are the result of shared\nhosting or a pooled resource with many customers but the overlap is notable nonetheless, as it may\nindicate an operator preference or behavioral TTP.\n3. Investigation of critical node IP 172.93.201[.]253 lead to the discovery of the domain disneycareers[.]net;\n\n[which appears to be a convincingly crafted mockup of Disney’s](https://urlscan.io/result/daafdb25-6083-47aa-9c5f-d278dd51cce4/#summary) [legitimate careers page:](https://urlscan.io/result/807f62c4-43a4-47f3-a488-c0d0d04422a4)\njobs.disneycareers[.]com. The mock site, in addition to being flagged as malicious by Google’s\nSafebrowsing service, is notably not served on Akamai’s network, nor is it registered with CSC\nCORPORATE DOMAINS, INC. (as Disney’s legitimate site is) but by Namecheap. During the course of\n[investigation the mock site’s appearance changed notably, possibly indicating active development.](https://urlscan.io/result/d0c09ef1-8e48-4960-a47c-bb9f434f1556/)\nAdditionally, the TLS certificate was issued by Sectigo, which matches the behavior noted above\nregarding the Certificate Authority of choice for the Cobalt Strike C2 domains. The purpose of this\nmockup domain is unknown, but the criminal nexus around the rest of the connected infrastructure\n_should be enough to warrant additional scrutiny and could perhaps indicate specific targeting._\n\n_IIIb. Takeaways_\n\nPACT concludes it is highly likely that the Naver-themed phishing activity is operationally linked to the Cobalt\nStrike infrastructure identified by RiskIQ (and mentioned by Microsoft). Additionally, PACT wishes to reiterate\nthat these findings may not necessarily mean that WIZARD SPIDER is conducting the discrete clusters of\nactivity that have been identified on this infrastructure. The fact that this infrastructure has been used to close\nseveral different links in the killchain across multiple campaigns (and perhaps by separate actors), coupled\nwith the observations detailed by RiskIQ and Microsoft, may lend additional credence to the hypotheses they\nput forth. It is worth quoting both firms at some length.\n\nRisk IQ states:\n\n“Despite the historical connections [between WIZARD SPIDER and the Cobalt Strike C2 infrastructure],\nwe cannot say with confidence that the threat actor behind the zero-day campaign is part of WIZARD\nSPIDER or its affiliates, or is even a criminal actor at all, though it is possible.”\n“The overlap with known ransomware infrastructure in this case could mean one of several things. First,\nthat the zero-day operators compromised the infrastructure of the ransomware operators. Second, that\nthe criminal operators are allowing the zero-day operators to piggyback on their existing infrastructure.\nThird, that the zero-day and ransomware operators are one and the same but engaging in espionage\ninstead of financial crime. Finally, it could mean that both entities could be utilizing the same third party\nproviding Bulletproof Hosting services. There is strong ancillary evidence that suggests this is the case.”\n(emphasis PACT’s)\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft states:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infrastructure we associate with DEV 0365 has several overlaps in behavior and unique identifying\ncharacteristics of Cobalt Strike infrastructure that suggest it was created or managed by a distinct set of\noperators. However, the follow-on activity from this infrastructure indicates multiple threat actors or\nclusters associated with human-operated ransomware attacks (including the deployment of Conti\nransomware). One explanation is that DEV-0365 is involved in a form of command- and-control\ninfrastructure as a service for cybercriminals.”\n\nPACT’s findings reinforce these assessments: this infrastructure appears to support separate, discrete\ncampaigns; it also supports operational mechanisms along multiple links of the killchain: it has hosted phishing\ndomains, initial exploitation tools, and C2 servers.\n\nPACT found the latter especially notable, as the Naver-themed phishing activity that was initially discovered\ndoes not appear to be the work of a ransomware group directly. In many cases, pre-ransomware activity (such\nas mass phishing and credential gathering activity) is handled by affiliates or brokers who provide access to\nthe ransomware operators, while post-compromise activities, ransomware development, and\ndeployment/encryption are executed by yet other groups. This separation of duties is not uncommon within the\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) criminal business model. Similar to what Microsoft and RiskIQ reported,\nPACT’s findings regarding the additional “uncertainty surrounding the nature of the shared qualities” of this\ninfrastructure and the “significant variation in malicious activity” strengthen the hypotheses that both firms put\nforward: multiple entities could be utilizing the same third party providing “bulletproof hosting” services to\nconduct their operations. PACT was unable to refute this hypothesis, and so assesses with moderate\nconfidence that an as-yet unreported criminal hosting service exists on this infrastructure. The only links that\nPACT was able to identify were hosting and DNS resolutions; no other operational mechanisms provided links\nto the reported WIZARD SPIDER activity (such as registrants, malicious samples, etc). Therefore, a novel and\nemerging “infrastructure as a service for cybercriminals” fits the available evidence.\n\nA third hypothesis, which PACT finds unlikely, is that multiple operators are leveraging a third party’s\ncompromised infrastructure to support their own discrete and unrelated campaigns. The relatively limited,\npublicly available information on the IP addresses that make up the core of the operational infrastructure\nseems to indicate an operator that adheres to strict operational security measures. Legitimate entities rarely\nhave so little publicly available or accessible information on their available services on a given IP address.\nThis fact, along with the historic overlaps in hosting combined with other observations, led PACT to find this\nfinal hypothesis improbable.\n\n**References:**\n\n**Annex: Detection Opportunities & Indicators of Compromise**\n\n_New Naver-themed phishing
