Hackers - both bad and good, government related or private groups\n\n - have their hands full every day as never before and compounding the situation is the\nRussia-Ukraine (UA) war which has sparked a cyber storm. This made us just more curious\nabout Internet attacks on the UA telecom infrastructure. One would expect our research to\nat least turn up a few attacks from Russia, but, surprisingly, that was not the case.\n\n## More honeypots!\n\nTo take a closer look at the situation, I rented a VPS server located in UA. The requirement\nfor this research was having an IP address originating from the UA pool. Unlike my previous\nstudy [A handshake with MySQL Bots, I didn't use original software (e.g. MariaDB server for](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/handshake-with-mysql-bots/)\nMySQL service) to gather information from the given service, but I decided to use opensource honeypot projects. There are good and bad sides of this approach, but was mainly\nfocused in taking a general overview of what, how and from where attacks are made, rather\nthan a detailed binary analysis, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe honeypot operated for three weeks, collecting information about authentication\nattempts on several services, mainly SSH, but also: HTTP, Telnet, VNC and SMTP - and a\nfew more:\n\n## SSH\n\nThe main idea of SSH sensor was monitoring and logging what is happening on one of the\n[most sensitive sites on the Internet. For this purpose, I used a project called Kippo, which](https://github.com/desaster/kippo)\nperfectly pretends to be an SSH service by mimicking an operating system. Kippo allowed\nme to not only to see how login strings and passwords are being brute-forced, but also what\nhappens after getting into - in this case fake - operating system.\n\nDuring the three weeks it operated, the honeypot counted over 50,000 authentication\nattempts. The honeypot was configured to simulate a successful login every other attempt.\nAnalyzing logs, among simple Linux commands, we mainly notice attempts to download\nand run droppers and miners. More info about these files on the bottom of page.\n\n\n-----\n\nPlease note the numbers 3378 and 749 at the top of each screenshot. These are the\nnumbers of the results of the same query, but without using the DISTINCT statement. This\ngives us some perspective on the real number of download attempts.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnly part of the addresses listed above were active. The samples that I initially analyzed\n[turned out to be mostly part of the well-known Mirai botnet.](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/trustwave-blog/what-businesses-can-learn-from-the-mirai-iot-ddos-attack-listen/)\n\nThe top 20 most encountered passwords and usernames used during a brute-force attack\nare listed below.\n\nAnd the number of connections made from single IP along with GeoIP information:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlbania and Vietnam top the list.\n\n[To monitor other services, I used the heralding project, which logs only login credentials and](https://github.com/johnnykv/heralding)\nconnection data. This honeypot collected information for two weeks. For the following\nservices, I focused mainly on GeoIP information.\n\nThe numbers of authentication attempts for each service:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Telnet\n\nTelnet, the archaic terminal connection is still quite popular - at least among attacking bots.\nLet's look at the collected data.\n\nTop 20 login names:\n\nThe number of connections made from a single IP along with GeoIP information:\n\n\n-----\n\nChina noticeably on the lead.\n\n## Virtual Network Computing (VNC)\n\nWe might think that Virtual Network Computing would not find many users today, but it turns\n[out that VNC still has many followers. According to Shodan, there are more than 320,000](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=product%3Avnc)\ndevices on the Internet with recognized VNC service, and more than 1 million devices with\nopen port 5900/TCP. These numbers alone justify the bots activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found only two active sources of attacks: Poland (7042 brute-force attempts) and\nKazakhstan (62 brute-force attempts).\n\n## SMTP\n\nAttacks on the mail transport protocol wasn't very heavy with just 14 unique addresses\ncounted.\n\nNetherlands and Lithuanian attack activity on the top.\n\n## HTTP\n\nThe honeypot wasn't able to collect any information about HTTPS activity, most likely\nbecause of self-signed certificate and the lack of related domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were so few authentication attempts that I limited the results to just 10 in order to\nillustrate the activity.\n\nAuthentication attempts on the other services were so few that we can easily leave them\nout of the conclusions.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Filename(s)** **Description** **MD5**\n\n1sh / 2sh Simple dropper script 36a5b9303d671f49e404791d53d1d96c\n\n\n8UsA.sh / 8UsA2.sh Simple dropper script\n(multi-architecture\ntargets)\n\nbins.sh Simple dropper script\n(multi-architecture\ntargets)\n\n\nf126deaee0a4958f2b8b5cacd5583617\n\n6030879d276d5add08b96dc923843fa8\n\n\n-----\n\ngo.sh Simple dropper script 025964a1bf4ae385de5c56835eca4033\n\n\nHeisenbergbins.sh Simple dropper script\n(multi-architecture\ntargets)\n\nmirai.sh Simple dropper script\n(multi-architecture\ntargets)\n\nPemex.sh Simple dropper script\n(multi-architecture\ntargets)\n\nCocknBallsbins.sh Simple dropper script\n(multi-architecture\ntargets)\n\n\nfaa93d8745cbdd0742d0db28e8108e2a\n\nebedac22d41286ffba78439b94f1d131\n\n199bf4a4cda2ed957a5efcfbfbf49af5\n\ne0c2acdffbb36d8c85abce52629dded4\n\n\n23s Backdoor b4ff3961cefcc5e151e319666bae6f5e\n\nx86_64 Backdoor 7e360e93a48e2bc25e412885d3aed601\n\nZeus.x86 Backdoor 1a19659c1918dcc8aacad48f4ea484cc\n\nstx.sh Crypto-miner dropper 814e7f7f32964cbf5ec91dbb56768da8\n\nsetup_c3pool_miner.sh Crypto-miner dropper c476816858ba11425bb9ce4c39e323b5\n\nsystemd Backdoor 2cee4f5e0252494ae3923c7f7b179cd5\n\n## Summary\n\nHave tough times come for the Ukrainian Honeypot? Well, on this particular one, not really.\n\nWe didn't notice any IP coming from Russia. In fact, much of the exploitation we saw could\nhave occurred regardless of the geography the honeypot was installed in.\n\nThere could be many reasons for this. Our first thought is elite hacking groups don't\nnecessarily pounce on a newly emerging server on the Internet. Instead, these groups have\nset targets on which they focus their time and energy. What our honeypot experiment did\n\n\n-----\n\nprove was that bots still function, in their usual fashion. Lazily attacking everything they can\nconnect to on the Internet. Additionally, we found that brute-force attacks are constantly a\nthreat to poorly managed infrastructures, servers, and IoT devices.\n\n\n-----",
