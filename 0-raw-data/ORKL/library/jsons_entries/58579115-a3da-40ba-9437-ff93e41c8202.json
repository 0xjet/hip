Many Russian government\ncyber assets have remained focused on Ukraine and related issues since the invasion\nbegan, while Russian APT activity outside of Ukraine largely remains the same. TAG\ncontinues to disrupt campaigns from multiple sets of Russian government-backed attackers,\n[some of which are detailed in our previous](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe/) [updates.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe/)\n\nSimilarly, Russian observed disinformation efforts are also focused on the war in Ukraine and\nTAG has disrupted coordinated influence operations from several actors including the\n[Internet Research Agency and a Russian consulting firm as detailed in the TAG Bulletin.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q2-2022/)\nMost of these coordinated influence operations are Russian language efforts aimed at\nensuring domestic support in Russia for the war.\n\nHere is a deeper look at some campaign activity TAG has observed since our last update:\n\n**Turla, a group publicly attributed to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), recently hosted**\n[Android apps on a domain spoofing the Ukrainian Azov Regiment. This is the first known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Regiment)\ninstance of Turla distributing Android-related malware. The apps were not distributed through\nthe Google Play Store, but hosted on a domain controlled by the actor and disseminated via\nlinks on third party messaging services. We believe there was no major impact on Android\nusers and that the number of installs was miniscule.\n\nThe app is distributed under the guise of performing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against\na set of Russian websites. However, the 'DoS' consists only of a single GET request to the\ntarget website, not enough to be effective. The list of target websites for the app can be seen\n[in the CyberChef recipe here.](https://t.co/h1ZsIEdD8e)\n\n\n-----\n\nTurla website disseminating fake DoS Android Apps.\n\nDuring our investigation into the Turla CyberAzov apps, we identified another Android app\nfirst seen in the wild in March 2022 that also claimed to conduct DoS attacks against Russian\n[websites. In this case, the Android app name was stopwar.apk (com.ddos.stopwar) and was](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/daf99a47519debd36739d315121bf965cb4aec5ed2a231656a7ce803b95c9375/detection)\ndistributed from the website stopwar.pro. This app is quite different from the Turla apps\ndescribed above and written by a different developer. It also downloads a list of targets from\nan external site, but unlike the Turla apps, it continually sends requests to the target websites\nuntil it is stopped by the user.\n\n\n-----\n\nPro-Ukrainian website used for disseminating StopWar.apk.\n\nBased on our analysis, we believe that the StopWar app was developed by pro-Ukrainian\ndevelopers and was the inspiration for what Turla actors based their fake CyberAzov DoS\napp off of.\n\nIndicators:\n\nhttps://cyberazov[.]com/apk/CyberAzov.apk\n[745e8c90a8e76f81021ff491cbc275bc134cdd7d23826b8dd23e58297fd0dd33](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/745e8c90a8e76f81021ff491cbc275bc134cdd7d23826b8dd23e58297fd0dd33/)\n[3c62b24594ec3cacc14bdca068a0277e855967210e92c2c17bcf7c7d0d6b782a](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3c62b24594ec3cacc14bdca068a0277e855967210e92c2c17bcf7c7d0d6b782a/)\n\n**The Follina vulnerability** [(CVE-2022-30190), first disclosed in late May, received significant](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30190)\nusage from both APT and cybercrime groups throughout June after it was patched by\nMicrosoft. Follina is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows\nSupport Diagnostic Tool (MSDT).\n\n[Consistent with CERT-UA reporting, TAG observed multiple Russian GRU actors - APT28](https://cert.gov.ua/article/341128)\nand Sandworm - conduct campaigns exploiting the Follina vulnerability. The Sandworm\ncampaign used compromised government accounts to send links to Microsoft Office\n\n\n-----\n\ndocuments hosted on compromised domains, primarily targeting media organizations in\nUkraine.\n\nTAG has also observed an increasing number of financially motivated actors targeting\n[Ukraine. One recent campaign from a group tracked by CERT-UA as UAC-0098 delivered](https://cert.gov.ua/article/339662)\nmalicious documents with the Follina exploit in password-protected archives, impersonating\nthe State Tax Service of Ukraine. We assess this actor is a former initial ransomware access\nbroker who previously worked with the Conti ransomware group distributing the IcedID\nbanking trojan based on overlaps in infrastructure, tools used in previous campaigns, and a\nunique cryptor.\n\n**Ghostwriter/UNC1151, a threat actor attributed to Belarus, has remained active targeting**\naccounts of webmail and social media networks of Polish users. They continue to use the\n'Browser in the Browser' phishing technique that TAG first [observed and described in March.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe/)\nAn example of this technique, used to target Facebook users, can be seen in the screenshot\nbelow.\n\nAn example of this technique used to target Facebook users\n\n\n-----\n\n**COLDRIVER, a Russian-based threat actor sometimes referred to as Callisto, continues to**\nsend credential phishing emails to targets including government and defense officials,\npoliticians, NGOs and think tanks, and journalists. In addition to including phishing links\ndirectly in the email, the attackers also link to PDFs and/or DOCs, hosted on Google Drive\nand Microsoft One Drive, that contain a link to an attacker-controlled phishing domain. In at\n[least one case, unrelated to Ukraine, they have leaked information from a compromised](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-russian-hackers-are-linked-new-brexit-leak-website-google-says-2022-05-25/)\naccount.\n\n[These phishing domains have been blocked through Google Safe Browsing – a service that](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\nidentifies unsafe websites across the web and notifies users and website owners of potential\nharm.\n\nExample of a recent COLDRIVER phishing lure\n\nRecently observed COLDRIVER indicators:\n\n\n-----\n\n[7b95747eeea196c1485d089fa47a06bacb07d06399603d3a4fa153c21ce0a9ba](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7b95747eeea196c1485d089fa47a06bacb07d06399603d3a4fa153c21ce0a9ba)\ncache-pdf[.]com\n\n[In another campaign tracked by CERT-UA as UAC-0056 we observed compromised email](https://cert.gov.ua/article/703548)\naddresses of a Regional Prosecutor’s office of Ukraine leveraged to send malicious Microsoft\nExcel documents with VBA macros delivering Cobalt Strike. In just two days, the volume\nobserved and categorized as spam by Gmail exceeded 4,500 emails. Email contents vary\nfrom COVID-19 vaccine policy to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n\n-----",
