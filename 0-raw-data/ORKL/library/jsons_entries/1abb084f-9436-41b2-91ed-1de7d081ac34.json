    "plain_text": "# Exposing TAG-53’s Credential Harvesting Infrastructure Used for Russia-Aligned Espionage Operations\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report profiles the infrastructure used by the threat activity group TAG-53, which overlaps with\npublic reporting on Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM. The activity was identified through a\ncombination of Network Intelligence and analysis derived from open-source reporting. The report will\nbe of most interest to network defenders and individuals engaged in strategic and operational\nintelligence relating to the activities of the Russian state in cyberspace.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nBeginning in July 2022, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed the recurring use of similar command\nand control (C2) infrastructure by the threat activity group TAG-53. This newly discovered\ninfrastructure likely overlaps with other infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\npreviously attributed to Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM, who have been linked to activity\naligning with Russian state interests.\n\nInsikt Group has observed the recurring use of common traits by TAG-53 when curating its\ninfrastructure, including the use of domain names employing a specific pattern construct along with\nLet’s Encrypt TLS certificates, the use of a specific cluster of hosting providers, and the use of a small\ncluster of autonomous systems.\n\nTAG-53 infrastructure was found to contain a spoofed Microsoft login page masquerading as a\nlegitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the United States, suggesting that some TAG-53\ninfrastructure has likely already been operationalized. Based on historical public reporting on\noverlapping TAG-53 campaigns, it is likely that this credential harvesting activity is enabled in part\nthrough phishing.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\n  - Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure used by TAG-53, a group likely linked to suspected\nRussian threat activity groups Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM.\n\n  - The identified TAG-53 infrastructure features common traits including the use of specific domain\nregistrars, the use of Let’s Encrypt TLS certificates, and a small cluster of autonomous systems.\nMost of TAG-53’s domains use a specific stylistic structure.\n\n  - TAG-53 has used domains masquerading as organizations across multiple industry verticals,\nwith a particular focus on government, intelligence, and military industries.\n\n## Background\n\nTAG-53 is consistent when setting up its infrastructure, which bears significant hallmarks and crossover\nwith infrastructure attributed to Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM. The group continues to\nuse particular stylistic structures when registering malicious domains alongside the use of specific\ndomain registrars with IP addresses that reside in a small cluster of autonomous systems.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n\n-----\n\nOn August 15, 2022, a Microsoft [report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/) published in collaboration with Google’s Threat Analysis Group\n(TAG) and Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team detailed SEABORGIUM’s phishing operations. In this\nresearch, Microsoft assesses that SEABORGIUM originates from Russia and has “objectives and\nvictimology that align closely with Russian state interests”. Microsoft denotes that SEABORGIUM shares\noverlaps with Callisto Group, TA446, and COLDRIVER and indicates that the threat actor has carried out\npersistent phishing and credential theft campaigns that have led to intrusions and data theft.\nSEABORGIUM primarily focuses its targeting on NATO countries, including a specific emphasis on the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom. The group also targeted Ukraine in the run-up to Russia’s\nfull-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.\n\n[Google’s TAG reported](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe/) [in March and updated in May 2022 that COLDRIVER has conducted credential](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe/)\nphishing campaigns using Gmail accounts targeting nongovernmental organizations and think tanks,\njournalists, and government and defense officials. TAG also suggests that COLDRIVER’s TTPs have\nevolved over time, moving towards incorporating PDF or DOC file links that are hosted on Google Drive\nand Microsoft OneDrive within its phishing emails.\n\n## Threat and Technical Analysis\n\n[Insikt Group used intelligence provided in open-source reporting (1,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/) [2,](https://blog.sekoia.io/calisto-continues-its-credential-harvesting-campaign/) [3,](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tracking-cyber-activity-eastern-europe/) [4) to profile TAG-53](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-on-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe/)\ninfrastructure that likely overlaps with Callisto Group, COLDRIVER, and SEABORGIUM infrastructure.\nTAG-53 infrastructure was uncovered by analyzing specific combinations of domain registrars,\nautonomous systems, domain name structures, and related TLS certificates. Based on this information,\nit is highly likely that this threat group is continuing its phishing and credential-harvesting operations.\nWhile monitoring TAG-53 infrastructure, Insikt Group observed a spoofed Microsoft login page\nmasquerading as a legitimate military weapons and hardware supplier in the US, suggesting that some\nTAG-53 infrastructure has likely already been operationalized.\n\n### Registrars\n\nUsing both current and passive Domain Name System (DNS) records, Insikt Group resolved IP\naddresses for 38 registered domains used by TAG-53 since January 2022. The identified TAG-53\ndomains, listed in Appendix A, have highlighted a trend towards the use of NameCheap, Porkbun,\nREG.RU, and regway for domain registration that has persisted since mid-2022, a breakdown of which\ncan be seen in Figure 1. The reason for the preference of these registrars is unknown, but it is a useful\nmetric when profiling candidate TAG-53 infrastructure.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Breakdown of domain registrars used by TAG-53 since January 2022 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n### Autonomous Systems\n\nAlongside the use of specific domain registrars is the use of particular autonomous systems, with all\ndomains collected under TAG-53 found to exist in 10 autonomous systems with a significant\nconcentration found located in 2 Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) linked to MIRhosting (AS52000)\nand Hostwinds (AS54290) shown in Table 1 below.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n\n-----\n\n|ASN|AS Name|TAG-53 Domain Count|\n|---|---|---|\n|AS52000|MIRhosting|11|\n|AS54290|HOSTWINDS|10|\n|AS44094|WEBHOST1-AS|4|\n|AS62240|Clouvider|4|\n|AS62005|BV-EU-AS|3|\n|AS44477|STARK-INDUSTRIES|2|\n|AS16276|OVH|1|\n|AS20278|NEXEON|1|\n|AS206446|CLOUDLEASE|1|\n|AS43624|STARK-INDUSTRIES-SOLUTIONS-AS|1|\n\n\n**Table 1: ASN detail breakdown for TAG-53 linked domains (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n### Domain Name Structure\n\nMost of the domains discovered via TAG-53 tracking use similarly structured domain names, primarily\nmade up of 2 terms separated by a hyphen, such as “cloud-safety[.]online”. Of the 38 domains\nidentified, 33 used the stylistic form “<word>-<word>.(com|online|ru)”. Of the remaining 5 domains, 4\nwere found to be similar, but consisted of 3 terms and 2 hyphens — “share-drive-ua[.]com”,\n“network-storage-ltd[.]com”, “land-of-service[.]com”, and “nonviolent-conflict-service[.]com” — and 1\ncontained no hyphens — “proxycrioisolation[.]com”. However, additional factors enabled Insikt Group to\nlink these domains to the rest of TAG-53’s infrastructure.\n\nA breakdown of the terms found in TAG-53 domains, shown in Figure 2, highlights the repeated use of\nspecific words within the domains, most of which are common, generic computing terms.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Breakdown of terms used in TAG-53 linked domains (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n### X.509 TLS Certificates\n\nAll identified TAG-53 domains were found to host corresponding X.509 TLS certificates provided by\nLet’s Encrypt, an example of which is shown in Figure 3. The prevalent use of Let’s Encrypt TLS\ncertificates allows for further correlations between TAG-53 domains and infrastructure, strengthening\nthe clustering of this activity.\n```\nData:\n   Version: 3 (0x2)\n   Serial Number:\n     03:05:f7:75:16:d1:98:1d:a0:bc:47:e8:89:20:94:fe:40:4a\n   Signature Algorithm: ecdsa-with-SHA384\n   Issuer: (CA ID: 183283)\n     commonName        = E1\n     organizationName     = Let's Encrypt\n     countryName        = US\n   Validity\n     Not Before: Oct 3 16:47:32 2022 GMT\n     Not After : Jan 1 16:47:31 2023 GMT\n\n```\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Figure 3: Partial X.509 TLS certificate for drive-globalordnance[.]com (Source: crt.sh)](https://crt.sh/?id=7672587577)**\n\n### Targeting and Victimology\n\nOf the 38 discovered domains, 9 contained references to potential target organizations or organizations\nthat TAG-53 may be attempting to masquerade as, shown in Table 2. The reason behind the use of\nthese themed domains is not fully understood beyond the likely attempt to emulate real entities in order\nto appear more legitimate to potential targets and victims.\n\n**TAG-53 Domain** **Suspected Target/Masquerade** **Industry Vertical**\n\numopl-drive[.]com UMO Poland Aerospace and Defense:\nHardware/Weaponry\n\ndrive-globalordnance[.]com Global Ordnance Aerospace and Defense:\nHardware/Weaponry\n\nsangrail-share[.]com Sangrail LTD Aerospace and Defense: Military\n& Civilian Intelligence\n\ndtgruelle-us[.]com DTGruelle Logistics\n\ndtgruelle-drive[.]com\n\ncija-docs[.]com The Commission for International NGO: Armed Conflict Crime\nJustice and Accountability (CIJA) Investigations\n\nblueskynetwork-shared[.]com Blue Sky Network Telecommunications: Satelite\n\ndns-mvd[.]ru The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Government: Russian Ministry of\nthe Russian Federation (MVD) Internal Affairs\n\nmvd-redir[.]ru\n\n**Table 2: Suspected targets/masquerades of TAG-53 linked domains (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n|TAG-53 Domain|Suspected Target/Masquerade|Industry Vertical|\n|---|---|---|\n|umopl-drive[.]com|UMO Poland|Aerospace and Defense: Hardware/Weaponry|\n|drive-globalordnance[.]com|Global Ordnance|Aerospace and Defense: Hardware/Weaponry|\n|sangrail-share[.]com|Sangrail LTD|Aerospace and Defense: Military & Civilian Intelligence|\n|dtgruelle-us[.]com|DTGruelle|Logistics|\n|dtgruelle-drive[.]com|||\n|cija-docs[.]com|The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA)|NGO: Armed Conflict Crime Investigations|\n|blueskynetwork-shared[.]com|Blue Sky Network|Telecommunications: Satelite|\n|dns-mvd[.]ru|The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation (MVD)|Government: Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|\n|mvd-redir[.]ru|||\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of the 9 domains reveals that 7 share a focus around industry verticals that would likely be of\ninterest to Russia-nexus threat groups, especially in light of the war in Ukraine. The 2 outlier domains\nare probably intended to masquerade as the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.\n(MVD)\n\n### Credential Harvesting\n\nThe TAG-53 domain “drive-globalordnance[.]com” includes a spoofed sign-in page for the legitimate\ncompany Global Ordnance, a military weapons and hardware supplier in the US. The spoofed sign-in\npage, shown in Figure 4, uses Global Ordnance branding and is suspected to be used for follow-on\ncredential harvesting after a target has been phished. It is unclear whether Global Ordnance is the\nintended target of this attempted credential harvesting operation or whether TAG-53 is using a Global\nOrdnance-styled domain and spoofed sign-in page to masquerade as a legitimate entity to target\nvictims.\n\n**[Figure 4: TAG-53 Global Ordnance spoofed sign-in page (Source: URLScan)](https://urlscan.io/result/c4f05136-5176-4365-be47-66534f51aeef)**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group. | CTA-RU-2022-1129\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\nUsers should conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate activity associated with TAG-53:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any\nnetwork defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking\nconnection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains listed in the\nappendix.\n\n  - Recorded Future proactively detects malicious server configurations and provides means to\nblock them in the Command and Control Security Control Feed.
