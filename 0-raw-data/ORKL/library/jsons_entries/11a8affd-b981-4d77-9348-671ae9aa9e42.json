Lodestone identified via open-source intelligence (OSINT) that White Rabbit was first\n[publicly disclosed on Twitter on the same date by security researcher Michael Gillespie](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1470823608725475334)\n(@demonslay355).\n\nBased on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in ongoing investigations and\nfurther research, Lodestone has determined that the White Rabbit group may be affiliated\nwith known threat actor group FIN8. FIN8 is a financially motivated group active since 2016\nthat has targeted retail, restaurant, and financial institutions using social engineering and\nspear-phishing attacks. Additionally, FIN8 has been linked to backdoor malware\nPUNCHBUGGY and BADHATCH, and the memory scraping malware PUNCHTRACK. The\nWhite Rabbit ransomware group appears to have leveraged a previously unseen version of\nBADHATCH which, based on characteristics of the malware sample acquired, Lodestone has\nnamed F5.\n\nLodestone has made preliminary observations of White Rabbit behavior that are described in\nthe text and screen captures below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**White Rabbit Ransom Note**\n\n**Evidence Uploaded to paste [.] pics and file [.] io (Redacted)**\n\n**TOR URL for Communication**\n\n**with White Rabbit (Redacted)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Login Page for**\n\n**White Rabbit Communication Channel**\nAt the time of writing, the earliest evidence of compromise Lodestone has observed in its\ninvestigations was a PowerShell script that executed on July 10, 2021. An analysis of\nPowerShell script artifacts revealed script blocks that matched those described in a July 27,\n[2021, Bitdefender article on FIN8. Additional White Rabbit activity Lodestone observed](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/deep-dive-into-a-fin8-attack-a-forensic-investigation)\noccurred on December 11, 2021; while the PowerShell artifacts from this most recent event\nwere similar to those associated with activity from August 30, 2021, these were not an exact\nmatch.\n\nLodestone’s analysis of a White Rabbit sample from August 30, 2021, suggested that it was\nan updated version of FIN8’s BADHATCH malware, [also known as SARDONIC, that](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/deep-dive-into-a-fin8-attack-a-forensic-investigation)\ncontains the following PDB path:\n\n“C:\\Users\\dev_win10_00\\\nDocuments\\Sardonic\\SardonicUtility\\LoaderAssembly\\obj\\x86\\Release\\MSDAC.pdb”.\n\nThe December 11, 2021, sample, however, contains the PDB path below:\n\n“C:\\Users\\dev_win10_00\\Documents\\f5\\F5Utility\\LoaderAssembly\\obj\\x86\\Release\\Default.pdb”.\n\n\n-----\n\nDLL\n\nDebug Information from August and December PowerShell Event Logs\nThe exact relationship between the White Rabbit group and FIN8 is currently unknown.\nHowever, Lodestone identified a number of TTPs suggesting that White Rabbit, if operating\nindependently of FIN8, has a close relationship with the more established threat group or is\nmimicking them.\n\nLodestone will continue to provide updates with additional findings on this emerging threat.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nIP Addresses\n\n170.130.55[.]120\n104.168.132[.]128\n\nDomains\n\n104-168.132[.]128.nip[.]io\n\nURLs\n\nhttps://104-168-132-128.nip[.]io /51b16c\nhttp://va5vkfdihi5forrzsnmins436z3cbvf3sqqkl4lf6l6kn3t5kc5efrad[.]onion\n\nFilenames\n\n“default.dll”\n\nHash Values\n\n655c3c304a2fe76d178f7878d6748439 (“default.dll”)\n\n\n-----\n\n6ffa106ac8d923ca32bc6162374f488b (Sardonic PowerShell script)\nfb3de0512d1ee5f615edee5ef3206a95 (Sardonic x86 DLL)\n4a03238e31e3e90b38870ffc0a3ceb3b (Sardonic x64 DLL)\nBeffdd959b1f7e11e1c2b31af2804a07 (F5 PowerShell script)\nd9f5a846726f11ae2f785f55842c630f (F5 x86 DLL)\n087f82581b65e3d4af6f74c8400be00e (F5 x64 DLL)\n\n**Additional Information and References**\n\nMichael Gillespie’s White Rabbit announcement on Twitter:\n\n🔒 [#Ransomware Hunt: \"White Rabbit\" with extension \".scrypt\", drops note for each](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nencrypted file with \"<filename>.scrypt.txt\" with victim-specific information:\n[https://t.co/ZjVay8A3Ch](https://t.co/ZjVay8A3Ch)\n\n\"Follow the White Rabbit…\" 🐰🤔 [pic.twitter.com/lhzHi5t1KK](https://t.co/lhzHi5t1KK)\n\n[— Michael Gillespie (@demonslay335) December 14, 2021](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1470823608725475334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[DOWNLOAD PDF](https://lodestone.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lodestone-Insight-White-Rabbit.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
