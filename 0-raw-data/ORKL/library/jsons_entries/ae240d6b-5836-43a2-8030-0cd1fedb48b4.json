By having a cookie-cutter, readymade format that can be purchased by anyone, the barrier to entry in creating convincing fake login portals\nis nearly eliminated. There have been several reports in recent months (TodayZoo\n\n[Franken-phish: TodayZoo built from other phishing kits. October 21, 2021. Accessible here.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/21/franken-phish-todayzoo-built-from-other-phishing-kits/)\n\n, most recently) that point out attacks leveraging phishing kits. This report investigates a kit that has stayed\nactive for more than four years. In just the last 18 months, thousands of users across more than a dozen\npublic and private sectors are known to have been affected, suggesting that this kit has had a tremendous\nimpact on organizations far and wide.\n\n## Uncovering the Activity\n\n_Author's Note_\n\n_I’d like to add a disclaimer here before continuing. This section starts with a bit of a marketing vibe to it, but_\n_this is really how it happened. Feel free to skip this part of the narrative._\nIn late October, I sat down to start creating useful content for a new platform my team and I are launching\n[called NetworkSage. One of the first technical blogs I wrote focuses on how various Sandbox technologies](https://networksage.seclarity.io/)\n-- while incredibly useful -- have some important gaps that are addressed by NetworkSage (if interested,\n[you can read that blog post here). While collecting data and finishing up one of the key points I was making](https://www.seclarity.io/resources/blog/how-networksage-compare-sandboxes)\n(Scenario 5: User Visits Known Phishing Site), I realized that I was actively staring at something that\n\n\n-----\n\nshared attack infrastructure with a number of other samples in our system:\n\nFigure 1: Suspicious Domain Appearing in Several Samples\n\nFurther still, I noticed that there was another domain showing up soon after the above activity. This\nappeared to be occurring in all of the samples where I entered credentials into the site, and almost always\nhad a C2-like channel associated with it:\n\nFigure 2: Suspicious Domain with C2-like Behavior\n\nThis discovery led me to the hypothesis that there was a widespread attack occurring that was flying under\nthe radar of most systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Previous Reporting\n\nBefore getting into the technical details, I want to note that about half-way into my investigation, I\ndiscovered that portions of this attack and group (dubbed PerSwaysion) had been found and reported on\npreviously. Interestingly, despite these reports, the activity has continued uninterrupted. In January of 2020,\nAvanan researchers briefly discussed one particular tactic used by clients of the phishing kit, namely the\ndelivery of exceptionally legitimate-looking emails that link to malicious content hosted on Microsoft’s Sway\nservice\n\nCybercriminals Use Microsoft Sway Scams to Phish Office 365 Security and Your Well-Trained Users.\n[January 9, 2020. Accessible here.](https://www.avanan.com/blog/microsoft-sway-phishing)\n\n. This provided a bit of context about how attackers use Microsoft Sway to bypass security filters and\nconvince users that their request is legitimate.\nIn April of 2020, Group-IB did a much deeper dive\n\nPerSwaysion Campaign: Playbook of Microsoft Document Sharing-Based Phishing Attack. April 30, 2020.\n[Accessible here.](https://blog.group-ib.com/perswaysion)\n\n. Their report laid out a narrative that:\n\ndubbed the group PerSwaysion\nlaid out the arc of events as they knew it (spanning from August 2019 through April 2020)\nidentified the likely nationality of the developers of the kit (Vietnamese)\ndescribed the kit’s global customer base\nestablished some aspects of the modularity of the kit\nprovided a detailed review of some aspects of the attacker infrastructure\ngave a walkthrough of a particular compromise\ndiscussed known victim locations and relevance\nidentified some artifacts that can be used to find these attacks\n\nThese are both great reports that I recommend reviewing. As such, I will not repeat content that they have\nalready covered. Instead, in this report I’ll spend time:\n\nestablishing the overall timeline of the group, which actually extends back to 2017\ndescribing activity since the last report, including the scope of victims\nelaborating on aspects of the kit not yet discussed\nidentifying Attack Vectors\nidentifying indicators userful for hunting and detection at various stages of the attack\nproviding a way to determine if you've been affected\n\nThroughout this report I will also describe how I found much of this information. I believe this is an\nimportant contribution for the benefit of the security community beyond just this report. What follows is the\ninvestigation and how it unfolded.\n\n## Understanding the Scope\n\n\n-----\n\n[The system we re releasing today is new and focuses on network traffic, which is absolutely critical for](https://www.seclarity.io/resources/blog/introducing-networksage/)\nunderstanding activity when it’s hard or impossible to reproduce. However, because this attack was\n[ongoing, I chose to investigate further by analyzing my samples and correlating them with Urlscan, a](https://urlscan.io/)\ncommunity platform focused on detonating URLs. This allowed me to dig deeper into what was actually\nhappening in each of these steps.I had many questions, but two were crucial to answer in order to\ndetermine the attack's scope.\n\n### Question 1: How Long has the Attack Existed?\n\nWhile trying to establish the timeline for this attack, I first needed to understand how many samples existed\nusing the domain that originally piqued my curiosity -- `wancdnapp[.]page . Using Urlscan’s search`\nfeature, I was able to quickly get an idea of how many samples contained it:\n\nFigure 3: Discovering How Many Samples had Suspicious Domain\n\nFrom there, I was able to review the samples and analyze the files requested from various submissions\nover time. I correlated this with manual analysis I was performing on live phishing portals, further\n\n\n-----\n\ncementing the similarity of activity across time:\n\nFigure 4: Comparing Data Between Fiddler and Urlscan\n\nThe next step involved analysis of several of the Javascript files referenced in the chain of requests that\nlead to a rendered phishing portal.\n\n**Javascript Analysis**\n\nIn all known cases, these Javascript files are found within a `themes directory (more on this later). By`\nanalyzing samples that have that structure and share other similarities, it was possible to discover that this\nactivity spanned far into the past. Interestingly, some samples' Javascript files are packed, while others are\nnot. However, once compared in unpacked form, the code reuse is quite significant. As an example, below\n\n\n-----\n\n[is an excerpt of the comparison of two samples from November 2019 and](https://urlscan.io/responses/22e67ac96d389037b6f846fe61a9fe47e5e3f2d915d6f80b37607e3013e4cf27/) [November 2021:](https://urlscan.io/responses/40b7da602555de2f2a3f7eea3ce9f6dbfc45989b7a511869b8ffaca91b8ccc35/)\n\nFigure 5: Code Comparison of Two Samples\n\n[However, not everything is identical. While analyzing scripts for one of the samples, I found a reference to](https://urlscan.io/responses/b7d7f79db54902e31fcc557addffefcb8400cc78cd3d414c4199425c9bc87a6f/)\na domain name that only exists in a comment:\n\nFigure 6: Domain Name in Code Comment\n\nSearching for this domain led me to discover that the same comment existed in a piece of code that was\nuploaded to a Javascript hosting platform in August of 2019:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Script Found on Javascript Hosting Platform\n\nBy refining the search to both topics, I was able to learn which user uploaded the file:\n\nFigure 8: User Associated with Script\n\nAt this time, I became aware of the Group-IB report (and consequently the Avanan report), namely\nbecause the researchers at Group-IB found this exact same link! However, this was the earliest activity that\nthey confidently identified as part of this phishing kit.Returning to my discovery of the `anytools[.]biz`\nreference, I noticed (via its WHOIS information) that it was registered nearly two years earlier than this\n\n\n-----\n\nestablished start of activity:\n\nFigure 9: WHOIS for anytools[.]biz\n\nWhile sophisticated adversaries certainly use the concept of domain aging\n\nDomain aging is the process of registering a domain much earlier than when it will be used in an attack.\nFor details, review page 18 of APWG's Global Phishing Survey: Trends and Domain Name Use in 2016,\n[which is available here.](https://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2015-2016.pdf)\n\n, I was highly suspicious that this domain lay dormant for so long.\n\n**A Pattern Emerges**\n\nAt this point, I spent several hours researching characteristics that identified other related activity.\nReviewing some samples with similar URL parameters, for example, led to additional domains I had not yet\n[discovered (such as this one), which associated domain perfectstuff[.]info to the attack). Others had PHP](https://urlscan.io/result/dec8c45e-aff8-4182-bf0f-c20a61fd39dd/#transactions)\nscript names that were relatively unique, such as `1.newsvpost_ads/loading.php . Searching the`\nInternet for that string led me to [this Pastebin paste identifying domain](https://pastebin.com/VXudQjd2) `sptech[.]org . Finally, after`\nreviewing the known Credential Collection site from the Group-IB report ( c3y5-tools[.]com ), I noticed\nthat a considerable number of the attack domains had similar registration dates clustered around late\n\n\n-----\n\nSeptember of 2017:\n\nFigure 10: Cluster of Domains with Similar Creation Date\n\nThis matched closely in time with the registration of `anytools[.]biz, which further strengthened my`\nsuspicion that mid 2019 was not the beginning of the attack.\n\n**A Breakthrough**\n\nOn the last day of intelligence gathering, I was able to definitively tie the activity all the way back to\nOctober 10, 2017. This was made possible by the community of Urlscan users who share links they’ve\nreceived in exchange for better knowledge about whether it is malicious. Without this community and this\nplatform, I likely never would have confirmed my suspicion.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Finding the Oldest Known Sample\n\nThe connection was made by first identifying something that all samples have in common (loading\n```\nmobile-detect.min.js, a benign and open-source library), iteratively searching for all submissions that\n\n```\ncontained that file, and then reviewing the sequence of events that occurred during that site’s loading.\nWhile this may not be the actual beginning of the attack, it serves as the earliest-known use of the TTPs I’ll\ndescribe later:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Transactions from First Known Sample\n\nAdditionally, it correlates strongly with the cluster of attack-related domains that were created just a couple\nof weeks earlier.\n\n### Question 2: How Widespread is this Attack?\n\nAfter reviewing Group-IB's report, many of my thoughts around this topic had at least partial answers. I\nwas, however, still unsure about what type of organizations were known to have been targeted in the last\n18 months. To partially answer\n\nThis is a partial answer because my analysis is necessarily subject to several biases, most specifically\n[Availability Bias.](https://catalogofbias.org/biases/availability-bias/)\n\nthis question, I focused on analyzing data from Urlscan to understand:\n\nhow many known phishing portals existed, and where they were hosted\nwhich email addresses were entered by potential victims\nwhich Attack Vectors were used to deliver phishing lures\n\nFrom this, I found that since May of 2020:\n\n**7403 total samples submitted**\n\n\n-----\n\n**444unique phishing portals**\n\nFigure 13: Distribution of Phishing Portals by Hosting Site\n\n**14 public or private sectors affected**\n\n**Known Sectors Affected**\n\nGovernment Financial Pharmaceutical\n\nEnergy University Insurance\n\nHealthcare Agriculture Engineering\n\nAerospace Public Relations Legal\n\nTechnology Marketing\n\nRealistically, because of the breadth and nature of this kit and the attacks, it’s likely that virtually any\nindustry could have been a target over time.\n\n## Kit Details\n\nWhile the Group-IB report does a great job of covering many aspects of the kit, there are several items I’d\nlike to elaborate on to help analysts understand when they have come across this activity in the wild.\n\n### Modular Infrastructure\n\nThis kit has two types of modularity. First, it makes deploying a phishing portal for many brands essentially\ndrag-and-drop:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Template Locations for Various Portals in English and Vietnamese\n\nThere are eight templates supported out of the box. Interestingly, the choice to target some of these brands\nitself highlights the age of this phishing kit.While all of these templates are available, most known samples\nfocus solely on Microsoft's Office365, with a small handful aiming to collect Outlook and other credentials.\nThe second modular aspect of this kit is how the attack infrastructure itself is set up. While the particular\ncustomer of the kit controls some implementation decisions, there are four aspects for each campaign:\n\n**1 Front End Phishing Portal (Short Lived)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThese sites are where the phishing portals load for a user. This is what a user would likely see in their\nbrowser when visiting a page. As an example:\n\nFigure 15: Example of a Front-End Phishing Portal\n\nBecause these are quickly detected and reported, they generally have a short shelf life.\n\n**2. Redirector Site (Long-Lived)**\n\nRedirector sites are lightweight, often Javascript-packed sites that are loaded by the phishing portal.\nAnalysis of the unpacked code clearly indicates that their main duty is to request the appropriate template\ninformation and resources. In some samples (especially older ones), this site may be the same as the\nTemplate Hosting site. A screenshot of this code (unpacked) is reproduced below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Example of a Redirector Site's Code\n\nBecause it is generally less clear that these sites are malicious (unless one looks at a system that can\ncorrelate many samples), these generally stay active for many months. To give a concrete example, when\nworking with the vendor where one of these sites was hosted, I was told that there was only one\n**unverifiable abuse report filed in the many months that the site was active!**\n\n**3. Template Hosting Site (Short-Lived)**\n\nThe Template Hosting site hosts all of the Javascript, CSS, and sometimes image files used to render the\nphishing portal for the user. In some instances this site is the same as the Redirector site. The content is\n\n\n-----\n\nalways found in a subdirectory named `themes :`\n\nFigure 17: Example of a Template Hosting Site Loading Assets\n\nBecause the Template Hosting sites are easy to pattern match against (which we’ll discuss later) and view\ntheir resources, their shelf life is also short.\n\n**4. Credential Collection Site (Long-Lived)**\n\nThe Credential Collection site is used to collect credentials that are entered by a user. These sites tend to\nstay up for extended periods of time (months or more) for a few reasons. First, they only appear when\ncredential information has been entered, which does not occur in most sandbox environments. Second, all\nof the information is encrypted, which makes understanding the activity more difficult for most analysts.\nThird, they employ basic anti-analysis techniques that we’ll describe in a moment.\n\n### Anti-Analysis Techniques\n\nOutside of those discussed by Group-IB, there are two additional anti-analysis techniques employed by\nthis phishing kit.\n\n**1. Code Packing**\n\nThe Javascript code itself is obfuscated, as it is packed. Therefore, unpacking is required in order to look\nfor any of the recognizable strings that exist within the code. Here is a before and after when using an\n\n\n-----\n\nunpacker:\n\nFigure 18: Before and After Code Unpacking\n\nWhile this isn’t something difficult to bypass, it does hinder the ability to look for exact string matches in the\ncontent.\n\n**2. Anti Chrome Dev Tools**\n\nSecond, this kit has anti-debugging set up to block analysis by Chrome’s Developer Tools. Any time\nDeveloper Tools is launched, the code triggers a `Pause function:`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: Anti-Debugging Found in Phishing Kit\n\nThis, combined with the fact that all communications are encoded and then encrypted, complicates\nanalysis further. Fortunately, this can easily be bypassed by using an off-the-shelf proxy:\n\nFigure 20: Decrypting and Decoding User-Submitted Payload in Fiddler and CyberChef\n\n## Attack Vectors\n\nConcrete discussion about which vectors were used to deliver some malicious content at the beginning of\nan attack is something that rarely appears in threat intelligence reports. At SeclarityIO we believe that this\nis an underserved area that can be used to help all analysts understand tactics used repeatedly by\nadversaries. As we analyze more data going forward, we intend to eliminate this major blind spot. While we\ndon't know everything that we'd like for this report, we do still know some things about which vectors were\nused to deliver the kit.At a high level, phishing is the #1 vector for delivery in this attack (as is true in a\nlarge majority of today’s attacks). However, we also know that those phishing emails employed various\ntechniques to hide their intent, and some amount of attacks originated outside of email. Since May 2020,\nthe techniques we observed are as follows:\n\n**1. URL Shorteners**\n\nThe use of URL shorteners can help to bypass some email protections, as well as add an air of legitimacy\nto a URL that disarms a suspicious user. The shorteners below were utilized.\n\n**URL Shorteners Observed**\n\nbit[.]do bit[.]ly rb[.]gy rebrand[.]ly\n\ntiny[.]cc tinyurl[.]com u[.]to cutt[.]ly\n\n\n-----\n\nTo see an example of what it looks like when a cutt[.]ly link is clicked and the user is redirected to a\nphishing portal, head to the How to Know If I’m Affected section.\n\n**2. Email Marketing Platforms**\n\nThere were many samples which used `sendgrid[.]net to bypass email filters and end up in users’`\ninboxes.\n\n**3. Compromised Sites**\n\nCompromising sites is additional work for the adversary, but doing so provides them with the ability to hide\nmore stealthily within an otherwise benign site. While we won’t mention the sites that were compromised,\nthere were several of them.\n\n**4. Malicious Domains**\n\nThere were many domains set up by attackers with the intention to bypass security platforms by being\nunknown. The full list of known malicious domains can be found in the indicators section of this report.\n\n**5. Content Preview and Hosting Sites**\n\nPlatforms that allow users to host arbitrary content on them are often used by attackers to quickly set up\ncontent and bypass security defenses. In addition to those platforms associated with the Phishing Portals,\nthe following were observed:\n\n**Sites Observed**\n\ngearhostpreview[.]com fcert[.]co googleusercontent[.]com\n\n**6. Advertisements**\n\nA few samples had redirects through Google’s advertising infrastructure, specifically\n\n```\ngoogleads.g.doubleclick[.]net\n\n```\n\n**7. Open Redirects**\n\nIt is possible to use certain sites in a malicious way without compromising them. One such example that\nappeared in the data set is `hangouts.google[.]com`\n\n[Open redirects ... and why Phishers love them. June 18, 2021. Accessible here.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Open+redirects+and+why+Phishers+love+them/27542/)\n\n.\n\n## Hunting and Detection\n\nSince this phishing kit has been affecting thousands of organizations across more than four years, it is\nclear that there is not enough concrete information about how to successfully identify this activity across\ndifferent layers of the security stack. In this section, I provide indicators that allow for security teams to not\nonly identify what exists today (“specific indicators”), but also to identify the activity more broadly.\n\n### Specific Indicators\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are a wealth of specific indicators visible at various layers. These will be useful for detecting\ncompromises that have already occurred, as well as those that do not adjust to the publishing of this\nreport.\nNote that as you review the indicators listed below, some of them have been sampled by analyzing one\nout of every 100 samples (across the total sample size of ~7400). This is because there is a massive\nnumber of sites and domains associated with this time period, and the value of many of these indicators\nhas already expired (as the attack infrastructure evolves).\n\n**Known Front-End Phishing Portals by Hosting Platform (05/01/2020-11/04/2021)**\n\nHosted on Microsoft’s

Recaptcha Key**\n\nInside the core phishing kit code that is repackaged and identical for the last 4+ years, there is a reference\nto the kit’s Google Recaptcha site key:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21: Recaptcha Key in Beautified Code\n\nChecking in with Google on this, I learned that this was in fact able to help identify a significant number of\nsites.\n\n**7. Strings and Regexes**\n\nIf you have the ability to inspect URLs and file contents, there are many useful things that can help to\nidentify this phishing kit. In all samples, the Javascript and CSS files used to set up and render the\nphishing portal can be found as such:\n```\n/\\/themes\\/(((js|css)\\/)|)[a-zA-Z0-9]45\\.(js|css)/\n\n```\nFigure 22: Regex in Action\n\nMoreover, the string `nbr is repeated constantly in the phishing kit’s files and in some of the URLs used to`\nrequest Javascript and CSS content (as seen above).\n\n### Broad Indicators\n\nBroad indicators allow this activity to continue to be detected while the underlying phishing kit remains the\nsame, even as the infrastructure itself evolves. Because this kit is used by many criminal groups and has\nremained static for over four years, it is likely that these indicators will remain useful long-term.\n\n**1. Open-Source Libraries Loading**\n\nIn every instance of this phishing kit’s use, there are a handful of libraries requested in order. This can be\nseen (after unpacking and beautifying) in the following code:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23: Block of Code Loading Open Source Libraries\n\nComparing the first-known sample with one from recent days, we see this behavior matching identically:\n\nFigure 24: Open Source Libraries Load Identically Over Time\n\nIf you have access to a decrypted version of the information you can match things exactly as seen above.\n[However, it’s also possible to identify this activity on the network! Below we see how an example of this](https://networksage.seclarity.io/public/samples/NzhmZjIxMWMtMjZjNi00OGZjLTgwM2UtYzNmZWM3MmNjOTU0I2hhc2gjOTRlZWI2ZWVjNzhiNDMyNDhlMThkNWJmMmJiYzMxZjg=)\nactivity appears in NetworkSage. Multiple requests to the same CDN are grouped together into one\n\n\n-----\n\nencrypted session, which provides a more succinct view:\n\nFigure 25: Network View of Open Source Libraries Loading\n\n**2. Content Loading from Cloud Hosting Platforms**\n\nThe second indicator for these (and for a wider range of) attacks is understanding how common some\ncloud hosting site is. Since these sites are acting as nearly one-use phishing portals in this activity, it’s\n[likely that you’ll see that they are incredibly uncommon across the global population:](https://networksage.seclarity.io/public/samples/NzhmZjIxMWMtMjZjNi00OGZjLTgwM2UtYzNmZWM3MmNjOTU0I2hhc2gjYjZhMzQ4MTk0NTU5NDFiNWE1MGYzMzM4Nzc5N2YwZDY=)\n\nFigure 26: Uncommon Cloud-Hosted Activity\n\n## Other Notes\n\n### How to Know if I'm Affected\n\n\n-----\n\nKnowing how far the phishing attack got -- as well as how it arrived for your users -- can be learned by\nanalyzing the network traffic around the activity. For example, if your users were targeted by an attack that\narrived via phishing through your Microsoft 365 instance, you’ll likely see activity like the following:\n\nFigure 27: User Clicked on Email Containing cutt[.]ly Link for Phishing Portal\n\nIn the case above, we also discover that the user very likely received an email where the malicious domain\nwas hidden behind a Cuttly URL shortening link, one of many URL shorteners that have been used to\ndeliver malicious links in this and various other phishing attacks. To learn if your users have entered\ncredentials, there are two things to look for. First, you should be on the lookout for recent known Credential\nCollection sites. These are automatically labeled and described for your convenience in NetworkSage:\n\nFigure 28: Labeled Credential Collection Site\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond, if the site is not yet recognized, be on the lookout for uncommonly-occurring activity that suggests\na C2-like channel is set up soon after other indicators of this attack:\n\nFigure 29: Site with C2-like Behavior Near Known PerSwaysion Indicators\n\nIf you [submit your samples to NetworkSage and don’t see any indication of the C2 activity above, it’s likely](https://networksage.seclarity.io/uploads)\nthat the user decided to leave the site before entering any information.\n\n## Loose Ends\n\nThere are several loose ends that I’ve come across in the investigation of this phishing kit that I’d like to\nshare with the community in hopes that it helps to continue crippling this infrastructure and the group\nbehind the kit.\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. How is this kit marketed?**\n\nI am far from an expert on Dark Web activity, but my searching on various forums turned up no meaningful\nleads. Moreover, none of the strings (outside of those that I’ve mentioned) in any of the files I’ve analyzed\nhave appeared anywhere on the Internet.\n\n**2. Who developed this kit?**\n\nGroup-IB’s report identified that the developers likely spoke Vietnamese natively, but no other ties to the\ndevelopers themselves were mentioned (there were references to users who bought the platform, but that\nisn’t what I’m interested in). Despite extensively searching a couple of possible leads associated with\nVietnamese developers, my search turned up nothing fruitful.\n\n**3. What was the anytools[.]biz site?**\n\nWhile I found references to anytools[.]biz app development in many samples that existed from 2019\nonward, I was unable to find any historical information (including via the Internet Archive) about this site or\nits contents.\n\n**4. Is this a view of an early UI?**\n\nWhile analyzing one site that served as a Credential Collection site in mid-2019 ( dtvd[.]biz ), I noticed\nthat one of the [samples that appeared in Urlscan had a page that referenced a Gmail Auto Login GUI:](https://urlscan.io/result/deb63276-2123-4503-819b-f9bea3698591/)\n\nFigure 30: UI Found on Credential Collection Site\n\nThis type of GUI would be useful for somebody who was trying to quickly validate whether the credentials\nentered were valid and valuable. It’s likely that this was a quick app spun up by an attacker for their own\ncampaign, but it was the only piece of control infrastructure for which I was able to find visual evidence.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tools Used\n\nThis analysis would not have been possible without the contributions of many creators inside and outside\nof the security community. As such, I wanted to specifically share the tools that I used as a thank you and\nas a reference for others.\n\n[Urlscan for significant plaintext site analysis and historical comparison](https://urlscan.io/)\n[NetworkSage for identifying shared infrastructure, finding an active C2 domain, and allowing users to](https://networksage.seclarity.io/)\nknow whether or not they were affected\n[Fiddler for decrypting and reviewing communications to phishing portals](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)\n[beautifier.io for making all Javascript samples more readable](https://beautifier.io/)\n[Unpacker for unpacking all obfuscated Javascript](https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html)\n[CyberChef for decoding Base64-encoded data](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)\n[Regexr for testing regular expressions](https://regexr.com/)\n[TextCompare for performing a diff between code samples](https://www.textcompare.org/)\n\n\n-----",
