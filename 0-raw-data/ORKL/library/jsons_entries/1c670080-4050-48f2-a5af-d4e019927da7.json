There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when\ninformation security isn't handled properly.\n\nRead now\nThe FBI has sent a security alert to the US private sector about an ongoing hacking campaign that's targeting supply chain software providers,\nZDNet has learned.\n\nThe FBI says hackers are attempting to infect companies with the Kwampirs malware, a remote access trojan (RAT).\n\n\"Software supply chain companies are believed to be targeted in order to gain access to the victim's strategic partners and/or customers,\nincluding entities supporting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) for global energy generation, transmission, and distribution,\" the FBI said in a\nprivate industry notification sent out last week.\n\nBesides attacks against supply chain software providers, the FBI said the same malware was also deployed in attacks against companies in\nthe healthcare, energy, and financial sectors.\n\nThe alert did not identify the targeted software providers, nor any other victims.\n\nInstead, the FBI shared IOCs (indicators of compromise) and YARA rules so organizations can scan internal networks for signs of the\nKwampirs RAT used in the recent attacks.\n\n### Kwampirs malware\n\n[The Kwampirs malware was first described in a report published by US cyber-security firm Symantec in April 2018.](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/orangeworm-targets-healthcare-us-europe-asia)\n\nAt the time, Symantec said a group codenamed Orangeworm had used the Kwampirs malware to similarly target supply chain companies that\nprovided software for the healthcare sector.\n\nSymantec said Orangeworm had been in operation since 2015 and was focused on the healthcare industry primarily.\n\n\"Orangeworm's secondary targets include Manufacturing, Information Technology, Agriculture, and Logistics,\" Symantec said at the time.\n\"While these industries may appear to be unrelated, we found them to have multiple links to healthcare, such as large manufacturers that\nproduce medical imaging devices sold directly into healthcare firms, IT organizations that provide support services to medical clinics, and\nlogistical organizations that deliver healthcare products.\"\n\nA [Lab52 report released a year later, in April 2019, confirmed the Symantec findings and the group's focus on the healthcare industry.](https://lab52.io/blog/orangeworm-group-kwampirs-analysis-update/)\n\n### New attacks appear to be targeting the ICS energy sector\n\nHowever, the FBI alert sent out last week specifically warns that attacks employing Kwampirs have now evolved to targeting companies in the\nICS (Industrial Control Systems) sector, and especially the energy sector.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, neither Symantec nor Lab52 made any attribution on the group's country of origin.\n\n[The FBI, however, claims that new evidence from code analysis suggests that Kwampirs contains \"numerous similarities\" with Shamoon, an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamoon)\n[infamous data-wiping malware developed by APT33, an Iranian-linked hacking group.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/shamoons-data-wiping-malware-believed-to-be-the-work-of-iranian-hackers/)\n\n\"While the Kwampirs RAT has not been observed incorporating a wiper component, comparative forensic analysis has revealed the Kwampirs\nRAT as having numerous similarities with the data destruction malware Disttrack (commonly known as Shamoon),\" the FBI said.\n\nThe Shamoon malware has been used in multiple data-wiping attacks against companies in the energy sector, and more specifically, in the oil\n[& gas fields [1,](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19293797) [2,](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19434920) [3].](https://www.zdnet.com/article/shamoon-malware-destroys-data-at-italian-oil-and-gas-company/)\n\nThe FBI urged companies to scan networks for any signs of Kwampirs and report any infections.\n\n\n-----",
