In light of this,\ntogether with [recent media coverage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/garmin-outage-caused-by-confirmed-wastedlocker-ransomware-attack/) [around large U.S. corporations being targeted by the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-blocked-from-deploying-ransomware-on-30-major-us-firms/)\nthreat, we have created this general assessment of the ransomware. Full visualization of\n[these techniques can be viewed in the Unit 42 Playbook Viewer.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=wastedlocker-ransomware)\n\n\n-----\n\n[WastedLocker is post-intrusion ransomware of the same ilk as Samsa,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/evolution-of-samsa-malware-suggests-new-ransomware-tactics-in-play/) [Maze,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-brief-maze-ransomware-activities/) [EKANS, Ryuk,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-assessment-ekans-ransomware/)\nBitPaymer and others. This type of ransomware differs from large-volume, victim-agnostic\nransomware variants like WannaCry by targeting an organization perceived as having a large\namount of assets, successfully breaching it, and then deploying specially crafted\nransomware to as many systems as possible within that organization in a short timeframe to\nmaximize impact and increase chances of receiving a much larger ransom payment.\n\nOn June 23, 2020, NCC Group published a report providing a detailed overview of the\nWastedLocker ransomware, including information on the group believed to be behind it, Evil\nCorp. In the past, this group has been responsible for the Dridex banking Trojan and other\nrelated threats and campaigns.\n\n[The Palo Alto Networks Threat Prevention subscription for the Next-Generation Firewall with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\n[WildFire and the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [Cortex XDR endpoint protection engine detects activity associated with this](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n[ransomware. Cortex XDR also contains an Anti-Ransomware Protection module, which](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/traps/4-2/traps-endpoint-security-manager-admin/malware-protection/manage-malware-protection-rules/configure-anti-ransomware-protection)\ntargets encryption-based activities associated with ransomware. Additionally, AutoFocus\ncustomers can review activity associated with this threat with the following tag:\n[WastedLocker.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.WastedLocker)\n\n## Targeting\n\nUsing our threat intelligence platform, AutoFocus, Unit 42 has identified some possible\ntargets for the actors behind WastedLocker. The majority of organizations are based in the\n[U.S., which ties in with activity reported by Symantec on June 26, 2020. The organizations](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us)\noperate in various sectors, including professional and legal services, utilities and energy,\nmanufacturing, wholesale and retail, high tech, engineering, pharma and life sciences, and\ntransportation and logistics (including one transportation and logistics organization from the\nUnited Kingdom that appears to have operations in the U.S).\n\n## WastedLocker Attack Technical Overview\n\n**Note: This is only a high-level overview of the pertinent technical aspects of WastedLocker**\nattacks. For a more in-depth technical analysis, including Indicators of Compromise (IoCs),\nsee SentinelOne’s blog, “WastedLocker Ransomware: Abusing ADS and NTFS File\nAttributes.”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. WastedLocker killchain\n\n**Initial Infection Vector**\n\nAccording to [previously reported WastedLocker activity by Symantec, the most commonly](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us)\nobserved initial infection mechanism for WastedLocker attacks are ZIP files (likely disguised\nas legitimate software updates) containing malicious SocGholish JavaScript framework\nloader components that profile the victim system and use PowerShell to ultimately deploy\nCobalt Strike payloads.\n\nWhile the full technical analysis of how the SocGholish framework operates is beyond the\nscope of this blog, an in-depth summary of its operation can be found in this post about fake\nbrowser update pages.\n\n**Lateral Movement**\n\nOnce the Cobalt Strike payload is installed on a victim’s machine, it is then used to move\nlaterally through the victim’s network and facilitate the identification of additional systems on\nwhich attackers can deploy their main payloads. (WastedLocker attackers have also been\nobserved using legitimate Windows utilities such as Windows Management Instrumentation\n\n[WMI] and PsExec to do this as well.) Of particularly high value to targeted ransomware\nattackers are systems that directly affect a victim’s customer-facing revenue-generating\nbusiness operations, internal systems of high visibility and high use, and systems that\ncontain (or facilitate the deployment of) system backups.\n\n**Final Payload**\n\nFinally, once sufficient reconnaissance of the victim’s network has been conducted, the\nattackers move to deploy the WastedLocker ransomware payload using one or more system\nmanagement utilities. (The exact mechanism is out of scope for this blog, but more details\n[are available in SentinelOne’s post.)](https://labs.sentinelone.com/wastedlocker-ransomware-abusing-ads-and-ntfs-file-attributes/)\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring execution on a target host, the ransomware will:\n\nAttempt to elevate execution privileges (if not already running as Administrator).\nAttempt to disable Windows Defender monitoring.\nDelete shadow copies/volume snapshots.\nInstall itself as a service.\n\nOnce installed, the delivery of the payload is complete and files are overwritten. The\nransomware mainly uses a `.<victim name>wasted extension, though files containing`\nransom note details are appended with a `.<victim_name>wasted_info extension.`\n\nThe *.wasted_info ransom note files we have analyzed thus far resemble the following\nexample where variable data is shown below between <> characters. The actor email\naddresses used can differ, and the domain names include the following (in most- to leastused order): PROTONMAIL.CH, AIRMAIL.CC, ECLIPSO.CH, TUTANOTA.COM and\nPROTONMAIL.COM\n\n<victim name>\n\nYOUR NETWORK IS ENCRYPTED NOW\n\nUSE <actor email 1> | <actor email 2> TO GET THE PRICE FOR YOUR DATA\n\nDO NOT GIVE THIS EMAIL TO 3RD PARTIES\n\nDO NOT RENAME OR MOVE THE FILE\n\nTHE FILE IS ENCRYPTED WITH THE FOLLOWING KEY:\n\n[begin_key]<base64 encoded public key>[end_key]\n\nKEEP IT\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe trend of targeted ransomware attacks is on the rise because they are comparatively\nmore effective and yield higher ransoms than more common forms of “spray-and-pray”\n[ransomware attacks similar to the ones observed by Unit 42 during the early stages of the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/covid-19-themed-cyber-attacks-target-government-and-medical-organizations/)\nCOVID-19 pandemic. WastedLocker is a prime example of a targeted ransomware attack.\nThe impact a group of determined cybercriminals can have against organizations can be\ndevastating, and the methodologies they utilize only serve to underscore the need for\nenterprises to employ both robust defensive technologies and capable cybersecurity\nexpertise into their environments.\n\nPalo Alto Networks detects/prevents WastedLocker in the following ways:\n\n\n-----\n\nWildFire: all known samples are identified as malware.\nCortex XDR Agent with:\n\nindicators for WastedLocker.\nAnti-Ransomware Module to detect WastedLocker encryption behaviors.\nLocal Analysis detection to detect WastedLocker binaries.\nBehavioral Threat Protection (BTP) triggers on Volume Shadow Copy being\ndeleted by WastedLocker.\nNext-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known command and control\n(C2) domains, which are also categorized as malware in PAN-DB.\n[AutoFocus: Tracking related activity using the WastedLocker tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.WastedLocker)\n\nOutside the protection offered by Palo Alto Networks products, Unit 42 strongly recommends\ncompanies and individuals combat the effects of ransomware by adopting a regular backup\nregimen of their critical systems paired with hardened (or, better still, offsite) storage of those\nbackups.\n\nMore information on ransomware can be found in the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat\nReport.\n\nReferences & Resources\n\n_[https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Fake+browser+update+pages+are+still+a+thing/25774/](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Fake+browser+update+pages+are+still+a+thing/25774/)_\n\n_[https://labs.sentinelone.com/wastedlocker-ransomware-abusing-ads-and-ntfs-file-attributes/](https://labs.sentinelone.com/wastedlocker-ransomware-abusing-ads-and-ntfs-file-attributes/)_\n\n_https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-_\n_ransomware-us_\n\n_https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-_\n_developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/_\n\n_[https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=wastedlocker-ransomware](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=wastedlocker-ransomware)_\n\n_[Best Practices from Palo Alto Networks](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices)_\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
