For several years, Levashov had been the subject of an\ninternational law enforcement operation led by the FBI, which sought to curtail his global\n[criminal activities powered by a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known as Kelihos. Levashov was](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/botnets/)\nthe primary threat actor behind Kelihos, and its predecessors Waledac and Storm.\n\nAt the time of Levashov’s arrest, the botnet had been operating globally, responsible for\nperpetrating a wide range of illegal activities including: delivering remote access tools to\nhijack computers in the Netherlands; distributing banking Trojans in North America,\nAustralia and Europe; engaging in pump-and-dump trading scams (designed to falsely\ninflate the price of a stock so it can be quickly dumped for profit); spamming victims with\nadvertisements for illegal pharmaceutical sites; delivering ransomware; and conducting\nmassive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nArresting Levashov was a critical first step in dismantling his incalculably destructive global\nenterprise – the next step was neutralizing the Kelihos botnet itself. The CrowdStrike Falcon\nIntelligence team, which had been tracking Levashov as the adversary called ZOMBIE\nSPIDER, was able to help law enforcement seize control of the Kelihos botnet so that it\ncould no longer be used by criminal actors. To understand that accomplishment, it’s\nimportant to learn more about Kelihos and how it operates.\n\n**The Kelihos Botnet**\n\nA botnet is a collection of victim computers infected with malware, connected through a\ncentralized command and control (C2) infrastructure maintained by the criminal hacker. A\nbotnet can be massive – many are comprised of tens of thousands of “zombie” machines –\nall being used for nefarious purposes. Kelihos was a botnet that employed peer-to-peer\n(P2P) communications using infected systems that acted as proxies, relaying information\nbetween each other and the Kelihos backend servers. This decentralized structure makes\nP2P botnets harder to disrupt than the more traditional variety. Levashov was able to\noperate the vast Kelihos network as a service, allowing other criminals to pay for delivering\ntheir own spam, banking trojans, ransomware, and even DDoS attacks. His criminal\nproficiency had even won him a spot on the top 10 list of the world’s worst spammers\n[maintained by the anti-spam group Spamhaus.](https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/spammers/)\n\nHere are some key facts about the Kelihos botnet, as compiled by Falcon Intelligence:\n\nKelihos is a multi-purpose P2P botnet that emerged in late 2010, shortly after its\npredecessor (known as Waledac) was dismantled.\nSince its inception, Kelihos has been subject to several takedown operations and\neach time the botnet has been rebuilt in a new, more robust manner.\nThe botnet is primarily used to deliver spam email, but it has a wide assortment of\nplugins that extend its functionality, including: credential and email address\nharvesting; launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; performing click\nfraud; and fast-flux DNS hosting.\nPrevious versions had the ability to mine Bitcoin.\nKelihos was deliberately designed to be difficult to reverse engineer – its network\nprotocol contains several layers of encryption including RSA, blowfish, and a custom\nobfuscation algorithm that the malware author refers to as “monkey” functions.\nThe fifth and current generation of the botnet has been around since the summer of\n2013, with an estimated size of 50,000 to 75,000 infected machines.\n\n**The CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence Team’s Role**\n\nIn order to seize control of the Kelihos botnet, a technique known as “peer list poisoning”\nwas used. The objective of peer list poisoning is to use the criminal’s own bot network, what\none might consider his strength, against him. The process involved propagating a carefully\ncrafted peer list that prevented the threat actor, in this case ZOMBIE SPIDER, from\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunicating with infected systems. As a result of the peer list poisoning, the P2P\nnetwork was transformed into a centralized network, with infected systems only allowed to\ncommunicate with a sinkhole established by law enforcement. In effect, this neutralized\nKelihos by redirecting communications from infected machines to the sinkhole, rather than\nthe intended C2 infrastructure. Since this technical operation began, Falcon Intelligence has\nobserved 50,541 unique infections communicating with the sinkhole server.\n\nWhile the arrest of Levashov, and the team’s related actions to dismantle Kelihos, are\nimportant milestones, we have not seen the last of this breed of criminal enterprises. That’s\nwhy organizations need to arm themselves with intelligence-driven endpoint security that\ncan address the increasingly sophisticated threats the future is sure to hold.\n\n_[Learn more about CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence and CrowdStrike’s](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/falcon-intelligence/)_ _cyber intelligence_\n_subscription offerings._\n\nRelated Content\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\n\n-----\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE 2021 22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
