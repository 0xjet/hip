The campaign seemed to be related to the MenuPass (a.k.a. APT10/Stone Panda/Red Apollo) threat actor,\nand utilized an open-source backdoor named QuasarRAT to achieve persistence within an organization. We identified several distinct\nloader variants tailored to specific targets by leveraging machine learning (ML) to analyse our malware corpus. We have not observed\nnew QuasarRAT samples in the wild since late 2018, roughly coinciding with when the FBI indicted several members of the MenuPass\ngroup.\n\nQuasarRAT is a lightweight remote administration tool written in C#. It can collect system information, download and execute\napplications, upload files, log keystrokes, grab screenshots/camera captures, retrieve system passwords and run shell commands. The\nremote access Trojan (RAT) is loaded by a bespoke loader (a.k.a. DILLWEED). The encrypted QuasarRAT payload is stored in the\nMicrosoft.NET directory, decrypted into memory, and instantiated using a CLR host application. In later variants an additional component\nis also used to install the RAT as a service (a.k.a DILLJUICE).\n\nThe following technical analysis focuses on the bespoke QuasarRAT loader developed by MenuPass and modifications made to the\nQuasarRAT backdoor.\n\n## Introducing the QuasarRAT Loader\n\n### Overview\n\nThe QuasarRAT loader typically arrives as a 64-bit service DLL. Its primary purpose is to decrypt, load and invoke an embedded .NET\nassembly in-memory using the CppHostCLR technique. This technique is based on code snippets from Microsoft DevCentre examples.\nThe assembly, obfuscated with ConfuserEx, is subsequently responsible for finding, decrypting, and executing a separate malicious\n.NET module. The encrypted module is stored in the %WINDOWS%\\Microsoft.NET directory.\n\nDuring our investigation we encountered several variants of the loader which indicated a development path lasting over a year; we were\nalso able to locate some (but not all) of the encrypted payload files belonging to these loader variants. After decryption, we discovered\n[that the payloads are backdoors based on the open-source code of QuasarRAT[1], version 2.0.0.0 and 1.3.0.0.](https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT)\n\n### Features\n\nSeveral layers of obfuscation\nPayload and its immediate loader are .NET assemblies\n[Initial loader uses the CppHostCLR[2] technique to inject and execute the .NET loader assembly](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/CppHostCLR-e6581ee0)\nPayload encrypted and stored under Microsoft.NET directory\nKnown to load QuasarRAT, but may work with any other .NET payload\n\n### Initial Loader and AntiLib\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial loader binary is a 64 bit PE DLL, intended to run as a service. The DllMain function is empty, while the malicious code is\ncontained in the ServiceMain export. Some variants include an additional randomly named export that creates the malicious service. In\nnewer versions this functionality was shifted to a standalone module.\n\nThe malware starts by deobfuscating an embedded next-stage executable. In the earliest variant, this is performed using simple XOR\nwith a hardcoded 8-byte key composed of random letters. Later variants use a slightly more advanced XOR based algorithm that\nrequires two single-byte keys. It’s possible that this approach was implemented to thwart XOR bruteforcing attempts:\n\n_Figure 1: Second stage decryption loop_\n\nStarting with variant 3, the .NET injection mechanism is implemented inside a second stage DLL, which according to debugging strings\nseems to be part of a project called “AntiLib”:\n\n_Figure 2: Debugging strings from variant 3_\n\nThis DLL is reflectively loaded into memory by an obfuscated shellcode-like routine and invoked by executing an export bearing the\nunambiguous name: “FuckYouAnti”. Older samples do not contain this second stage library, and the .NET loading functionality is\nimplemented directly in the initial loader:\n\n_Figure 3: FuckYouAnti string in the code and in 2nd stage DLL export table_\n\nOnce executed, the \"FuckYouAnti\" function will decrypt the .NET loader binary using the same XOR based algorithm with a different pair\nof hardcoded keys.\n\nTo load the assembly directly into memory, the malware makes use of a technique called \"CppHostCLR\" which is described in detail in\nMicrosoft DevCentre. The code looks like the example code provided by Microsoft. It invokes the loader entry point using hardcoded\nclass and method names, that are random and differ for each sample:\n\n_Figure 4: Use of CppHostCLR technique_\n\n_Figure 5: Invoking .NET assembly loader_\n\n## String Encryption\n\nHardcoded .NET version strings and several persistence related strings (in earlier variants) are encrypted using a custom algorithm. This\nalgorithm is based on a single unit T-box implementation of AES-256, combined with 16-byte XOR. Both keys are hardcoded and differ\nfor each sample, except for the oldest variant. The oldest variant set keys to “1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF” and\n“1234567890ABCDEF” respectively and did not change between samples:\n\n_Figure 6: Example AES and XOR decryption keys_\n\n_Figure 7: String decryption routine_\n\n## Digital Certificates\n\nSamples belonging to variant 3 of the loader present a valid digital signature from CONVENTION DIGITAL LTD (serial number 52 25 B8\nE2 2D 3B BC 97 3F DD 24 2F 2C 2E 70 0C) countersigned by Symantec:\n\n_Figure 8: Digital certificate from variant 3_\n\n## The .NET loader\n\nOnce executed, the malicious assembly will iterate through all files under %WINDOWS%\\Microsoft.NET and attempt to decrypt files\nmatching a specified size. It uses an implementation of RijndaelManaged algorithm in CBC mode:\n\n_Figure 9: Finding encrypted payload_\n\n_Figure 10: Final payload decryption_\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the decryption succeeds, the malware will attempt to load the decrypted assembly and invoke the specified method:\n\n_Figure 11. Invoking backdoor payload_\n\nThe final payload assembly is stored as an encrypted file somewhere under the Microsoft.NET Framework directory. The framework\nversion is hardcoded in the loader binary in an encrypted form, and in most samples set to “v4.0.30319”. The location is different per\nsample and the file name imitates one of other the legitimate files found in the same directory. Example paths:\n\n_%WINDOWS%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\WPF\\Fonts\\GlobalSerif.CompositeFont.rsp_\n_%WINDOWS%\\Microsoft.NET \\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Build.Engine.dll.uninstall_\n\nThe payload is decrypted and loaded in-memory as \"Client\". We have encountered two versions of the Client: 2.0.0.0 and 1.3.0.0. They\nare similar, both having a version string in their configuration section set to “2.0.0.0”:\n\n_Figure 12. Backdoor assembly in memory (version 2.0.0.0)_\n\n_Figure 13. Backdoor assembly in memory (version 1.3.0.0)_\n\n## QuasarRAT Backdoor\n\nQuasarRAT is an open-source project that proclaims to be designed for legitimate system administration and employee monitoring. Its\ncode, together with documentation, can be found on GitHub.\n\n### Features:\n\n_Figure 14. README.md from Quasar GitHub repository_\n\n## Behaviour\n\n[The .NET payload is a heavily obfuscated backdoor based on an open-source remote administration tool called QuasarRAT[3]. The](https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT)\nconfiguration is stored in a class called Settings, with sensitive string values encrypted with AES-128 in CBF mode and base64 encoded.\nThe string’s decryption key is derived from the ENCRYPTIONKEY value inside Settings and is the same for all strings:\n\n_Figure 15. Partially encrypted config (after deobfuscation)_\n\nThe threat actor modified the original backdoor, adding their own field in the configuration, and code for checking the Internet\nconnectivity. If a valid URL address is specified in the last value of config, the malware will try to download the content of that URL. It will\nproceed with connecting to the command and control (C2) server only once the download is successful:\n\n_Figure 16: Custom connectivity check_\n\nThe backdoor communicates with the C2 server whose IP address is provided in the HOSTS value of the configuration. All\ncommunication is encrypted with AES-128 in CBF mode using KEY and AUTHKEY values from configuration:\n\n_Figure 17. C2 IP address decrypted in memory_\n\nDecrypted configuration examples:\n\n## Additional Observations\n\n### Loader Variant Differences\n\n**_Features common for all variants:_**\n\nMost of the samples we collected seem to be compiled with VisualStudio 2010 RTM build 30319, with the exception of variant 4,\nwhich uses a different/unknown compiler signature\nSome strings are encrypted with an algorithm based on a custom implementation of AES256 combined with XOR\n\n\n-----\n\nThe .NET loader is always injected using the Microsoft CPPHostCLR method;
