These are part of the Vocabulary for Event\nRecording and Incident Sharing (VERIS), a framework designed to\nallow for a consistent, unequivocal collection of security incident\ndetails. Here are some select definitions followed by links with\nmore information on the framework and on the enumerations.\n\n**Threat actor:**\nWho is behind the event? This could be the external “bad guy”\nthat launches a phishing campaign, or an employee who leaves\nsensitive documents in their seat back pocket.\n\n**Threat action:**\nWhat tactics (actions) were used to affect an asset? VERIS uses\nseven primary categories of threat actions: Malware, Hacking,\nSocial, Misuse, Physical, Error, and Environmental. Examples at a\nhigh level are hacking a server, installing malware, and influencing\nhuman behavior.\n\n**Variety:**\nMore specific enumerations of higher level categories - e.g.,\nclassifying the external “bad guy” as an organized criminal group,\nor recording a hacking action as SQL injection or brute force.\n\n**Learn more here:**\n\n[• \u0007github.com/vz-risk/dbir/tree/gh-pages/2019 – DBIR figures and](https://github.com/vz-risk/dbir/tree/gh-pages/2019)\n\nfigure data.\n\n[• \u0007veriscommunity.net features information on the framework with](http://veriscommunity.net)\n\nexamples and enumeration listings.\n\n[• \u0007github.com/vz-risk/veris features the full VERIS schema.](https://github.com/vz-risk/veris)\n\n[• \u0007github.com/vz-risk/vcdb provides access to our database on](https://github.com/vz-risk/vcdb)\n\npublicly disclosed breaches, the VERIS Community Database.\n\n[• \u0007http://veriscommunity.net/veris_webapp_min.html](http://veriscommunity.net/veris_webapp_min.html)\n\nallows you to record your own incidents and breaches. Don’t fret,\nit saves any data locally and you only share what you want.\n\n**Incident vs. breaches**\n\nWe talk a lot about incidents and breaches and we use the\nfollowing definitions:\n\n**Incident:**\nA security event that compromises the integrity, confidentiality\nor availability of an information asset.\n\n**Breach:**\nAn incident that results in the confirmed disclosure—not just\npotential exposure—of data to an unauthorized party.\n\n\n**Industry labels**\n\nWe align with the North American Industry Classification\nSystem (NAICS) standard to categorize the victim organizations\nin our corpus. The standard uses 2 to 6 digit codes to classify\nbusinesses and organizations. Our analysis is typically done at\nthe 2-digit level and we will specify NAICS codes along with an\nindustry label. For example, a chart with a label of Financial (52)\nis not indicative of 52 as a value. 52 is the NAICS code for the\nFinance and Insurance sector. The overall label of “Financial” is\nused for brevity within the figures. Detailed information on the\ncodes and classification system is available here:\n\n[https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2017](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2017)\n\n**New chart, who dis?**\n\nYou may notice that the bar chart shown may not be as, well, barish as what you may be used to. Last year we talked a bit in the\nMethodology section about confidence. When we say a number is\nX, it’s really X +/- a small amount.\n\nServer (Just large organization breaches, n=335)\n\nServer (All breaches, n=1,881)\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 1. Top asset variety in breaches**\n\nThis year we’re putting it in the bar charts. The black dot is the\nvalue, but the slope gives you an idea of where the real value could\nbe between. In this sample figure we’ve added a few red bars to\nhighlight it, but in 19 bars out of 20 (95%),[1] the real number will\nbe between the two red lines on the bar chart. Notice that as the\nsample size (n) goes down, the bars get farther apart. If the lower\nbound of the range on the top bar overlaps with the higher bound of\nthe bar beneath it, they are treated as statistically similar and thus\nstatements that x is more than y will not be proclaimed.\n\n**Questions?

Pull up a chair with the 2019 Verizon\nData Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).\nThe statements you will read in the pages that follow\nare data-driven, either by the incident corpus that\nis the foundation of this publication, or by non-incident\ndata sets contributed by several security vendors.\n\nThis report is built upon analysis of 41,686 security\nincidents, of which 2,013 were confirmed data\nbreaches. We will take a look at how results are\nchanging (or not) over the years as well as digging\ninto the overall threat landscape and the actors,\nactions, and assets that are present in breaches.\nWindows into the most common pairs of threat\nactions and affected assets also are provided.\nThis affords the reader with yet another means to\nanalyze breaches and to find commonalities above\nand beyond the incident classification patterns that\nyou may already be acquainted with.\n\nFear not, however. The nine incident classification\npatterns are still around, and we continue to focus on\nhow they correlate to industry. In addition to the nine\nprimary patterns, we have created a subset of data to\npull out financially-motivated social engineering (FMSE)\nattacks that do not have a goal of malware installation.\nInstead, they are more focused on credential theft and\nduping people into transferring money into adversarycontrolled accounts. In addition to comparing industry\nthreat profiles to each other, individual industry\nsections are once again front and center.\n\nJoining forces with the ever-growing incident/breach\ncorpus, several areas of research using non-incident\ndata sets such as malware blocks, results of phishing\ntraining, and vulnerability scanning are also utilized.\nLeveraging, and sometimes combining, disparate data\nsources (like honeypots and internet scan research)\nallows for additional data-driven context.\n\n\nIt is our charge to present information on the common\ntactics used by attackers against organizations in\nyour industry. The purpose of this study is not to\nrub salt in the wounds of information security, but to\ncontribute to the “light” that raises awareness and\nprovides the ability to learn from the past. Use it as\nanother arrow in your quiver to win hearts, minds, and\nsecurity budget. We often hear that this is “required\nreading” and strive to deliver actionable information in\na manner that does not cause drowsiness, fatigue,\nor any other adverse side effects.\n\nWe continue to be encouraged and energized by\nthe coordinated data sharing by our 73 data sources,\n66 of which are organizations external to Verizon.\nThis community of data contributors represents an\ninternational group of public and private entities willing\nto support this annual publication. We again thank\nthem for their support, time, and, of course, DATA.\n\nWe all have wounds, none of us knows everything,\nlet’s learn from each other.\n\n\nExcelsior!2\n\n\n-----\n\n## Summary\n of findings\n\n**16% were breaches of Public sector entities**\n\n**15% were breaches involving Healthcare organizations**\n\n**10% were breaches of the Financial industry**\n\n**43% of breaches involved small business victims**\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 2.

What are other commonalities?**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Results and analysis\n\nThe results found in this and subsequent sections\nwithin the report are based on a data set collected\nfrom a variety of sources such as publicly-disclosed\nsecurity incidents, cases provided by the Verizon\nThreat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC)\ninvestigators, and by our external collaborators. The\nyear-to-year data set(s) will have new sources of\nincident and breach data as we strive to locate and\nengage with organizations that are willing to share\ninformation to improve the diversity and coverage\nof real-world events. This is a convenience sample,\nand changes in contributors, both additions and\nthose who were not able to participate this year, will\ninfluence the data set. Moreover, potential changes\nin their areas of focus can stir the pot o’ breaches\nwhen we trend over time. All of this means we are not\nalways researching and analyzing the same fish in\nthe same barrel. Still other potential factors that may\naffect these results are changes in how we subset\ndata and large-scale events that can sometimes\ninfluence metrics for a given year. These are all\ntaken into consideration, and acknowledged where\nnecessary, within the text to provide appropriate\ncontext to the reader.\n\n\nyear the trend continues. There are some subsets\nof data that are removed from the general corpus,\nnotably over 50,000 botnet related breaches. These\nwould have been attributed to external groups and,\nhad they been included, would have further increased\nthe gap between the External and Internal threat.\n\n80%\n\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Exte Inter Part|rnal nal ner|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n2011 2013 2015 2017\n\n\nWith those cards on the table, a year-to-year view of\nthe actors (and their motives),3 followed by changes\n\nin threat actions and affected assets over time is\nonce again provided. A deeper dive into the overall\nresults for this year’s data set with an old-school\nfocus on threat action categories follows. Within\nthe threat action results, relevant non-incident data\nis included to add more awareness regarding the\ntactics that are in the adversaries’ arsenal.\n\n**Defining the threats**\n\n\n50%\n\n25%\n\n\n75%\n\n\nThreat actor is the terminology used to describe\nwho was pulling the strings of the breach (or if an\nerror, tripping on them). Actors are broken out into\nthree high-level categories of External, Internal, and\nPartner. External actors have long been the primary\nculprits behind confirmed data breaches and this\n\n\n0%\n\n\n**Figure 6. Threat actors in breaches over time**\n\n**Financial**\n\n**Espionage**\n\n**Other**\n\n2011 2013 2015 2017\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Espio|Fina nage Oth|ncial er|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n**Figure 7.

Select threat actors in breaches over time**\n\nFinancial gain is still the most common motive behind\ndata breaches where a motive is known or applicable\n(errors are not categorized with any motive). This\ncontinued positioning of personal or financial gain at\nthe top is not unexpected. In addition to the botnet\nbreaches that were filtered out, there are other\nscalable breach types that allow for opportunistic\ncriminals to attack and compromise numerous\nvictims.4 Breaches with a strategic advantage as the\n\nend goal are well-represented, with one-quarter of\nthe breaches associated with espionage. The ebb\nand flow of the financial and espionage motives are\nindicative of changes in the data contributions and\nthe multi-victim sprees.\n\n\nenvironments and card skimming operations.\nSimilar percentage changes in organized criminal\ngroups and state-affiliated operations are shown in\nFigure 8 above. Another notable finding (since we\nare already walking down memory lane) is the bump\nin Activists, who were somewhat of a one-hit wonder\nin the 2012 DBIR with regard to confirmed data\nbreaches. We also don’t see much of Cashier (which\nalso encompasses food servers and bank tellers)\nanymore. System administrators are creeping up\nand while the rogue admin planting logic bombs and\nother mayhem makes for a good story, the presence\nof insiders is most often in the form of errors. These\nare either by misconfiguring servers to allow for\nunwanted access or publishing data to a server that\nshould not have been accessible by all site viewers.\nPlease, close those buckets!\n\n\nThis year there was a continued reduction in\ncard-present breaches involving point of sale\n\n\n-----\n\nDIFF\n\n-2\n\n+2\n\n+20\n\n-8\n\n-5\n\n+1\n\n\n2018 2013\n\n\nDIFF\n\n-3\n\n-1\n\n+18\n\n+5\n\n-2\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n\nServer\n\nUser Dev\n\nPerson\n\nMedia\n\nKiosk/Term\n\nNetwork\n\n\n2018 2013\n\n\nHacking\n\nMalware\n\nSocial\n\nError\n\nMisuse\n\nPhysical\n\nEnvironmental\n\n\n65%\n\n\n56%\n\n\n63%\n\n\n29\n\n17\n\n\n53%\n\n30\n\n35\n\n\n30\n\n39\n\n\n21\n\n16\n\n\n28\n\n19\n\n17\n\n\n1\n\n\n9\n\n7\n\n\n4\n\n\n17\n\n14\n\n10\n\n\n00\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 9. Threat actions in data breaches over time**\nn=2,501 (2013), n=1,638 (2018)\n\nFigures 9 and 10 show changes in threat actions and\naffected assets from 2013 to 2018.5,6 No, we don’t have\n\nsome odd affinity for seven-year time frames (as far\nas you know). Prior years were heavily influenced by\npayment card breaches featuring automated attacks\non POS devices with default credentials, so 2013\nwas a better representative starting point. The rise in\nsocial engineering is evident in both charts, with the\naction category Social and the related human asset\nboth increasing.\n\n**Threat action varieties**\n\nWhen we delve a bit deeper and examine threat actions\nat the variety level, the proverbial question of “What are\nthe bad guys doing?” starts to become clearer. Figure 11\nshows Denial of Service attacks are again at the top\n\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 10. Asset categories in data breaches over time**\nn=2,294 (2013), n=1,513 (2018)\n\nof action varieties associated with security incidents,\nbut it is still very rare for DoS to feature in a confirmed\ndata breach. Similarly, Loss, which is short for Lost or\nmisplaced assets, incidents are not labeled as a data\nbreach if the asset lost is a laptop or phone, as there\nis no feasible way to determine if data was accessed.\nWe allow ourselves to infer data disclosure if the asset\ninvolved was printed documents.\n\nSwitching over to breaches in Figure 12, phishing and\nthe hacking action variety of use of stolen credentials\nare prominent fixtures. The next group of three\ninvolves the installation and subsequent use of back­\ndoor or Command and Control (C2) malware. These\ntactics have historically been common facets of data\nbreaches and based on our data, there is still much\nsuccess to be had there.\n\n\n0 1\n\n\n5\u0007Credit where it’s due.

Utilizing valid credentials to pop web\napplications is not exactly avant garde.\n\nThe reason it becomes noteworthy is that 60%\nof the time, the compromised web application vector\nwas the front-end to cloud based email servers.\n\nUse of stolen creds\n\nUse of backdoor or C2\n\nExploit vuln\n\nBrute force\n\nBuffer overflow\n\nAbuse of functionality\n\nRFI\n\nSQLi\n\nOther\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 13.

Top hacking action vectors in breaches (n=862)**\n\nEven though stolen credentials are not directly\nassociated with patch currency, it is still a necessary\nand noble undertaking. At most, six percent of\nbreaches in our data set this year involved exploiting\nvulnerabilities. Remember that time your network\nwas scanned for vulnerabilities and there were zero\nfindings? You slept soundly that night only to be\njolted from your drowsy utopia by your alarm radio\nblaring “I Got You Babe.” Vulnerability scanning always\nyields findings (even benign informational ones) and\nit is up to the administrators to determine which are\naccepted, and which are addressed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 shows the patching behavior of hundreds\nof organizations from multiple vulnerability scanning\ncontributors. Based on scan history, we determine\nthat organizations will typically have a big push to\nremediate findings after they are initially discovered\nand after that there is a steady increase in percentage\nof findings fixed until it levels out. Not unlike the\namount of romance and mutual regard that occurs\nwhile dating vs. once married. You get the idea.\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) is how protected\nyou are while you are actively patching. Quick\nremediation will result in a higher AUC. The\npercentage completed-on-time (COT) is the amount\nof vulnerabilities patched at a pre-determined\ncut-off time; we used 90 days. Your COT metric\ncould be different, and it would make sense to have\ndifferent COTs for Internet-facing devices or browser\nvulnerabilities, and certainly for vulnerabilities with\nactive exploitation in the wild.\n\n\n**Malware**\n\nMalware can be leveraged in numerous ways to\nestablish or advance attacks. Command and Control\n(C2) and backdoors are found in both security\nincidents and breaches. Ransomware is still a major\nissue for organizations and is not forced to rely on\ndata theft in order to be lucrative.\n\n\nC2\n\nRansomware\n\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that there will always\nbe findings. The key is to prioritize the important\nones and have a plan for the remaining actionable\nvulnerabilities; and to be able to defend acceptance of\nunaddressed findings.\n\n100%\n\n\nAdminware\n\nAdware\n\n\nBackdoor\n\nSpyware/keylogger\n\n\n75%\n\n50%\n\n\n25%\n\n0%\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|AUC: 32.4% COT: 43.8%|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n7 30 60 90\n\n**Days taken to patch**\n\n**Figure 15.

This finding is supported in Figure 19,\nwhich presents data received from millions of\nmalware detonations, and illustrates that the median\ncompany received over 90% of their detected\nmalware by email. Direct install is indicative of a\ndevice that is already compromised and the malware\nis installed after access is established. It is possible\nfor malware to be introduced via email, and once the\nfoothold is gained, additional malware is downloaded,\nencoded to bypass detection and installed directly. Like\nmost enumerations, these are not mutually exclusive.\n\n**Social**\n\nWhile hacking and malicious code may be the words\nthat resonate most with people when the term “data\nbreach” is used, there are other threat action catego­\nries that have been around much longer and are still\nubiquitous. Social engineering, along with Misuse,\nError, and Physical, do not rely on the existence of\n“cyberstuff” and are definitely worth discussing. We\nwill talk about these “OGs” now, beginning with the\nmanipulation of human behavior.\n\nThere is some cause for hope in regard to phishing,\nas click rates from the combined results of multiple\nsecurity awareness vendors are going down.

For example, if a user is tricked into\nvisiting a phony site and he/she then enters credentials,\nthe human asset is recorded as well as the asset that\nthe credentials are used to access. To that end, those\nmoments when the users thoughts are adrift provide\nan excellent opportunity for criminals to phish via SMS\nor emails to mobile devices. This is supported by the\n18% of clicks from the sanctioned phishing data that\nwere attributed to mobile. Below is a window into\nmobile devices and how the way humans use them can\ncontribute to successful phishing attacks provided by\nresearcher Arun Vishwanath, Chief Technologist, Avant\nResearch Group, LLC.\n\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n**2.99%**\n0%\n\n2012 2014 2016 2018\n\n**Figure 21.

This is the case for\nemail-based spear phishing, spoofing attacks\nthat attempt to mimic legitimate webpages, as\nwell as attacks via social media.7, 8, 9\n\nThe reasons for this stem from the design\nof mobile and how users interact with these\ndevices. In hardware terms, mobile devices\nhave relatively limited screen sizes that restrict\nwhat can be accessed and viewed clearly.\nMost smartphones also limit the ability to\nview multiple pages side-by-side, and navi­\ngating pages and apps necessitates toggling\nbetween them—all of which make it tedious\nfor users to check the veracity of emails and\nrequests while on mobile.\n\n\nMobile OS and apps also restrict the\navailability of information often necessary\nfor verifying whether an email or webpage is\nfraudulent. For instance, many mobile browsers\nlimit users’ ability to assess the quality of a\nwebsite’s SSL certificate. Likewise, many\nmobile email apps also limit what aspects of\nthe email header are visible and whether the\nemail-source information is even accessible.\n\n\nMobile software also enhances the prominence\nof GUI elements that foster action—accept,\nreply, send, like, and such­—which make it easier\nfor users to respond to a request. Thus, on the\none hand, the hardware and software on mobile\ndevices restrict the quality of information that\nis available, while on the other they make it\neasier for users to make snap decisions.\n\nThe final nail is driven in by how people use\nmobile devices. Users often interact with\ntheir mobile devices while walking, talking,\ndriving, and doing all manner of other activities\nthat interfere with their ability to pay careful\nattention to incoming information. While\nalready cognitively constrained, on screen\nnotifications that allow users to respond to\nincoming requests, often without even having\nto navigate back to the application from which\nthe request emanates, further enhance the\nlikelihood of reactively responding to requests.\n\n\nThus, the confluence of design and how\nusers interact with mobile devices make it\neasier for users to make snap, often\nuninformed decisions—which significantly\nincreases their susceptibility to social\nattacks on mobile devices.\n\n\n7\u0007Vishwanath, A.

In the majority of\nphishing breaches, we are not privy to the exact\nrole of the influenced user and thus, Person Unknown would have been present. We can deduce\nthat phishing of Those Who Cannot Be Named\nleads to malware installed on desktops or tricking\nusers into providing their credentials.\n\nMost often, those compromised credentials were to\ncloud-based mail servers. There was an uptick\nin actors seeking these credentials to compromise a\nuser’s email account. It turns out there are\nseveral ways to leverage this newly found access.\nActors can launch large phishing campaigns from\n\n\nthe account, or if the account owner has a certain\ndegree of clout, send more targeted and elaborate\nemails to employees who are authorized to pay\nbogus invoices.\n\nThere were also numerous cases where an\norganization’s email accounts were compromised\nand the adversary inserted themselves into\nconversations that centered around payments. At\nthis point, the actors are appropriately positioned\nto add forwarding rules in order to shut out the\nreal account owner from the conversation. Then\nthey simply inform the other recipients that\nthey need to wire money to a different account on\nthis occasion because…reasons.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother trend in this year’s data set is a marked shift\naway from going after payment cards via ATM/gas\npump skimming or Point of Sale systems and towards\ne-commerce applications. The 83 breaches with\nthe association of web application and the action of\ntype capture application data is one indicator of this\nchange.

Obviously, we have no way\nof knowing how many resources were expended\nin activities such as intelligence gathering and\nother preparations.10 However, the time from the\n\nattacker’s first action in an event chain to the initial\ncompromise of an asset is typically measured in\nminutes. Conversely, the time to discovery is more\nlikely to be months. Discovery time is very dependent\non the type of attack in question. With payment card\ncompromises, for instance, discovery is usually based\nupon the fraudulent use of the stolen data (typically\nweeks or months), while a stolen laptop will usually be\n\n\ndiscovered much more quickly because it is relatively\nobvious when someone has broken the glass out of\nyour car door and taken your computer.\n\nFinally, it goes without saying that not being\ncompromised in the first place is the most desirable\nscenario in which to find oneself. Therefore, a focus\non understanding what data types you possess\nthat are likely to be targeted, along with the correct\napplication of controls to make that data more difficult\n(even with an initial device compromise) to access and\nexfiltrate is vital. Unfortunately, we do not have a lot\nof data around time to exfiltration, but improvements\nwithin your own organization in relation to both that\nmetric along with time to discovery can result in the\nprevention of a high-impact confirmed data breach.\n\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\nCompromise, (n=140)\n\nExfiltration, (n=87)\n\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\nDiscovery, (n=390)\n\nContainment, (n=127)\n\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\n\nSeconds Minutes Hours Days Weeks Months Years\n\n**Figure 28. Breach timelines**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Unbroken chains\n\n**While it is our belief that this section can be of interest and benefit to our readers, there are a couple**\n**of caveats that should be made clear from the beginning. First of all, we have only recently updated**\n**the VERIS schema to allow for collection of event chain data. Secondly, not all incident and breach**\n**records offer enough details to attempt to map out the path traveled by the threat actor.**\n\n\n**We collect an action, actor, asset, and attribute at each step. However, each may be “Unknown” or**\n**omitted completely if it did not occur in that particular step of the attack. To create a single path from**\n**these factors, we begin by placing the actor at the first step at the beginning of the path. It’s followed**\n**by the action and then attribute present in the step. For the remaining steps it proceeds from action**\n**to attribute to action of the next step, simply skipping over any omitted.**\n\n\n**This calls for the old Billy Baroo.**\n\nLast year we pointed out how a golfer navigating a golf\ncourse is a lot like an adversary attacking your network.11\n\nThe course creator builds sand traps and water\nhazards along the way to make life difficult. Additional\nsteps, such as the length of grass in the rough and\neven the pin placement on the green can raise the\nstroke average for a given hole. In our world, you’ve put\ndefenses and mitigations in place to deter, detect, and\ndefend. And just like on the golf course, the attackers\nreach into their bag, pull out their iron, in the form of\na threat action, and do everything they can to land on\nthe attribute they want in the soft grass of the fairway.\n\n\nabsolutely have to? Just place your ball right there on\nthe green and tap it in for a birdie or a double eagle,\nas the case may be. And while your normal genteel\ngolfer will abide (to a greater or lesser degree) by the\ncourse rules on the off chance that there is a Marshall\nwatching and start on hole 1, threat actors will invari­\nably take the shotgun start approach. They will begin\ntheir round on the hole they are shooting for, whether\nit’s confidentiality, integrity, or availability.\n\n300\n\n\nThe first thing to know is that unlike a golfer who\ngraciously paces all the way back to the tees to take\nhis or her first shot, your attackers won’t be anywhere\nnear as courteous. In Figure 29 we see that attack\npaths are much more likely to be short than long. And\nwhy not, if you’re not following the rules (and which\nattackers do?) why hit from the tees unless you\n\n##### “My golf security is so delicate, so\n tenuously wired together with silent\n inward prayers, exhortations and unstable\n visualizations, that the sheer pressure\n of an additional pair of eyes crumbles the\n whole rickety structure into rubble.” \n\n—John Updike, with the sympathy of some CISOs.\n\n\n200\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 5 10 15\n\n**Number of steps**\n\n\n**Figure 29. Number of steps per incident (n=1,285)**\nShort attack paths are much more common than long\nattack paths.\n\nFigure 30 provides a look at the three holes on our\nInfoSec golf course. It displays the number of events\nand threat actions in the attack chains, by last attri­\nbute affected. There is a lot to take in, and we do want\nto point a few things out.\n\n\n-----\n\nAvailability\nConfidentiality\nIntegrity\n\nAvailability\nConfidentiality\nIntegrity\n\n\nAvailability\nConfidentiality\nIntegrity\n\n\n14 12 10 8 6 4 2\n\n**Steps**\n\n\n0\n\n\n**Action** Error Malware Physical Unknown Hacking Misuse Social\n\n**Figure 30. Attack chain by final attribute compromised¹² (n=941)**\n\n\nFirst, starting with Confidentiality, take a look at just\nhow many short paths result from Misuse and Error,\nand to a lesser extent from Physical actions. On the\nother hand, we can see Hacking actions bounding\nback and forth between attributes for several steps.\nIn Integrity we see an especially long chain beginning\nwith Hacking and going to and fro between that and\n\n\nMalware as it compromises the Confidentiality and\nIntegrity of the target.\n\nObviously, there’s a lot going on in Figure 30. An\neasier way of looking at it is what actions start\n(Figure 31), continue (Figure 32), and end (Figure 33)\nincidents.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe see that the while Hacking\nis a little farther ahead, the\nfirst action in an incident could\nbe almost anything. The most\ninteresting part is that Malware\nis at the end of the chart, even\nbehind Physical, which requires\nthe attacker to be, well, physically\npresent during the attack.\nMalware is usually not the\ndriver you use to get off the tee;\nremember that most is delivered\nvia social or hacking actions.\n\nHacking\n\nError\n\nSocial\n\nMisuse\n\nPhysical\n\nMalware\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n**Incidents**\n\n**Figure 31.

It\nmay not be the opening shot, but\nit is the trusty 7-iron (or 3 wood,\npick your analogy according to\nyour skills), that is your go-to club\nfor those middle action shots.\nInterestingly, there are almost\nno Misuse and Physical middle\nactions and no Error in our data\nset. That’s primarily because\nthese are short attack paths\nand to be in the middle you have\nto have at least three events in\nthe chain.\n\nMalware\n\nHacking\n\nSocial\n\nMisuse\n\nPhysical\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Incidents**\n\n**Figure 32.

Figure 34 comes from breach\nsimulation data. It shows that in testing, defenders fail\nto stop short paths substantially more often than long\npaths. So, just in case you were looking on your systems\nand thinking “it’s the other guys that let the attackers\nstart on the putting green,” short attacks work.\n\n\n0 5 10 15\n\n**Number of steps**\n\n\n**Figure 34. Attack success by chain length in**\nsimulated incidents (n=87)\n\n\n**Attack Paths and Mitigations**\n\nOur friends at the Center for Internet Security\ncontributed some thoughts on mitigating\nattack paths:\n\n\nMuch of security has been founded on cat­\nalogues of controls, vague vendor promises,\nlaborious legislation, and tomes of things to\ndo to keep your organization safe. Within this\nsea of options, we also have to justify our\nbudgets, staff, and meet the business needs\nof the organization. Leveraging an attack path\nmodel is not only an important step towards\nformalizing our understanding of attacks, but\nalso a means to understanding our defense.\nPreviously, when looking at attack summary\ndata we were presented with a snapshot of an\nattacker’s process which requires us to infer\n\n\nthe preceding and proceeding events. Wheth­\ner we realize it or not, such interpretations\nimpact how we plan our defenses. Defending\nagainst malware takes a different approach if\nthe malware is dropped via social engineering,\na drive-by download, or brought in by an\ninsider via a USB device.\n\nIn addition, while being faced with what seems\nlike an endless list of potential attacks, limiting\nourselves to snapshots also hinders our ability\nto find commonalities between these attacks.\nSuch commonalities may be key dependencies\nin an attacker’s process which represent\nopportunities for us to disrupt. The more\nwe can understand the sequence of events\nhappening in an attack, the more we as a\ncommunity can make it harder for adversaries\nto reuse the same process.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Incident classification\n patterns and subsets\n\n\nBeginning with the 2014 report, we have utilized\nnine basic patterns to categorize security incidents\nand data breaches that share several similar\ncharacteristics. This was done in an effort to\ncommunicate that the majority of incidents/breaches,\neven targeted, sophisticated attacks, generally\nshare enough commonalities to categorize them, and\nstudy how often each pattern is found in a particular\nindustry’s data set. When we first identified the\n\nPrivilege Misuse\n\nDenial of Service\n\nCrimeware\n\nLost and Stolen Assets\n\nWeb Applications\n\nMiscellaneous Errors\n\nEverything Else\n\nCyber-Espionage\n\nPoint of Sale\n\nPayment Card Skimmers\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n\npatterns six years ago we reported that 92 percent\nof the incidents in our corpus going back 10 years\ncould be categorized into one of the nine patterns.\nFast-forwarding to today with over 375,000 incidents\nand over 17,000 data breaches, the numbers reveal\nthat 98.5% of security incidents and 88% of data\nbreaches continue to find a home within one of the\noriginal nine patterns. So, it would appear that, as with\nhumans, the “I can change” mantra is false here as well.\n\nWeb Applications\n\nMiscellaneous Errors\n\nPrivilege Misuse\n\nCyber-Espionage\n\nEverything Else\n\nCrimeware\n\nLost and Stolen Assets\n\nPoint of Sale\n\nPayment Card Skimmers\n\nDenial of Service\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n\n-----\n\nThe patterns will be referenced more in the\nindustry sections, but to get acquainted or rekindle\na relationship, they are defined below:\n\n**Crimeware:**\nAll instances involving malware that did not fit into a\nmore specific pattern. The majority of incidents that\ncomprise this pattern are opportunistic in nature and\nare financially motivated.\n\n_Notable findings: Command and control (C2) is_\n_the most common functionality (47%) in incidents,_\n_followed by Ransomware (28%)._\n\n**Cyber-Espionage:**\nIncidents in this pattern include unauthorized\nnetwork or system access linked to state-affiliated\nactors and/or exhibiting the motive of espionage.\n\n_Notable findings: Threat actors attributed to state-_\n_affiliated groups or nation-states combine to make up_\n_96% of breaches, with former employees, competitors,_\n_and organized criminal groups representing the rest._\n_Phishing was present in 78% of Cyber-Espionage_\n_incidents and the installation and use of backdoors_\n_and/or C2 malware was found in over 87% of incidents._\n_Breaches involving internal actors are categorized in_\n_the Insider and Privilege Misuse pattern._\n\n**Denial of Service:**\nAny attack intended to compromise the availability\nof networks and systems. This includes both network\nand application attacks designed to overwhelm\nsystems, resulting in performance degradation or\ninterruption of service.\n\n_Notable findings: This pattern is based on the specific_\n_hacking action variety of DoS. The victims in our data_\n_set are large organizations over 99 percent of the time._\n\n**Insider and Privilege Misuse:**\nAll incidents tagged with the action category\nof Misuse—any unapproved or malicious use of\norganizational resources—fall within this pattern.\n\n_Notable findings: This is mainly insider misuse, but_\n_former and collusive employees as well as partners_\n_are present in the data set._\n\n\n**Miscellaneous Errors:**\nIncidents in which unintentional actions directly\ncompromised a security attribute of an asset.\n\n_Notable findings: Misdelivery of sensitive data,_\n_publishing data to unintended audiences, and_\n_misconfigured servers account for 85% of this pattern._\n\n**Payment Card Skimmers:**\nAll incidents in which a skimming device was\nphysically implanted (tampering) on an asset that\nreads magnetic stripe data from a payment card.\n\n_Notable findings: Physical tampering of ATMs and_\n_gas pumps has decreased from last year. This may_\n_be attributable to EMV and disruption of card-present_\n_fraud capabilities._\n\n**Point of Sale Intrusions:**\nRemote attacks against the environments where\ncard-present retail transactions are conducted. POS\nterminals and POS controllers are the targeted assets.\nPhysical tampering of PIN entry device (PED) pads or\nswapping out devices is covered in the Payment Card\nSkimmers section.\n\n_Notable findings: The Accommodation industry is still_\n_the most common victim within this pattern, although_\n_breaches were less common this year._\n\n**Physical Theft and Loss:**\nAny incident where an information asset went missing,\nwhether through misplacement or malice.\n\n_Notable findings: The top two assets found in Physical_\n_Theft and Loss breaches are paper documents,_\n_and laptops. When recorded, the most common_\n_location of theft was at the victim work area, or from_\n_employee-owned vehicles._\n\n**Web Application Attacks:**\nAny incident in which a web application was the\nvector of attack. This includes exploits of code-level\nvulnerabilities in the application as well as thwarting\nauthentication mechanisms.\n\n_Notable findings: Over one-half of breaches in this_\n_pattern are associated with unauthorized access of_\n_cloud-based email servers._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Everything Else:**\nAny incident or breach that was not categorized into\none of the nine aforementioned patterns.\n\n_Notable findings: Of the 241 breaches that fell into_\n_the Everything Else pattern, 28% are part of the_\n_Financially-Motivated Social Engineering attacks_\n_subset discussed later in this section._\n\n**Patterns within patterns**\n\nThere are two subsets of incidents that will be called\nout when looking at industry breakouts. The increase\nin mail server (and email account) compromise and\nthe significant dollar losses from social attacks leading\nto fraudulent payments provided an opportunity to\ncreate a Financially-Motivated Social Engineering\n(FMSE) subset that Includes incidents and breaches\nthat would fall into Web Application Attacks or\nEverything Else. These incidents are included in the\nmain corpus, but we will look at them independently\nas well. The incidents that comprise the botnet\nsubset, are not part of the main data set, due\nto the sheer volume. These incidents could fall into\nCrimeware if modeled from the perspective of\nthe malware recipient, or Web applications if the\nbotnet steals credentials from one victim and is used\nagainst another organizations’ application. Our\ndata is from the latter, organizations whose systems\nare logged on via stolen user credentials.\n\n**Financially-Motivated Social Engineering Subset:**\nFinancially motivated incidents that resulted in either\na data breach or fraudulent transaction that featured\na Social action but did not involve malware installation\nor employee misuse. Financial pretexting and phishing\nattacks (e.g., Business Email Compromise, W-2\nphishing) are included in this subset.\n\n_Notable findings: 370 incidents, 248 of which are_\n_confirmed data breaches, populate this subset. The_\n_incidents are split almost evenly between parent_\n_patterns of Everything Else and Web applications._\n_The breaches are closer to a 3:1 Web Application to_\n_Everything Else ratio._\n\n\n_Analysis shows 6x fewer Human Resources personnel_\n_being impacted in breaches this year. This finding, as_\n_correlated with the W-2 scams, almost disappearing_\n_from our dataset. While this may be due to improved_\n_awareness within organizations, our data doesn’t offer_\n_any definitive answers as to what has caused the drop._\n\n**Botnet Subset:**\nComprised of over 50,000 instances of customers as\nvictims of banking Trojans or other credential-stealing\nmalware. These are generally low on details and\nanalyzed separately to avoid eclipsing the rest of the\nmain analysis data set.\n\n_Notable findings: 84% of the victims were in Finance_\n_and Insurance (52), 10% in Information (51), and 5% in_\n_Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (54)._\n_180 countries and territories are represented in these_\n_breaches. Botnets are truly a low-effort attack that_\n_knows no boundaries and brings attackers either direct_\n_revenue through financial account compromise or_\n_infrastructure to work from._\n\n**Secondary Subset:**\nComprised of 6,527 incidents of web applications\nused for secondary attacks such as DDoS sources or\nmalware hosting. These are legitimate incidents, but\nlow on details and analyzed separately from the main\nanalysis data set.\n\n_Notable findings: Many times, these are light on_\n_specifics, but we do know that 39% of the time they_\n_involved a malware action, with 70% of those_\n_being DDoS, and 30% exploiting a vulnerability and_\n_downloading additional malware. Attackers need_\n_infrastructure too and just like with the botnet subset,_\n_when an attacker takes over your web application,_\n_your infrastructure just got converted to multi-tenant._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Data breaches: extended version\n\n\nThere’s definitely a feeling in InfoSec that the attackers\nare outpacing us. They’ve got all the creds, the\nvulns, and the shells, not to mention the possibility\nof huge monetary incentives. We, on the other hand,\nhave a four-year project just to replace the servers\non end-of-life operating systems. However, when\ncontemplating this unfair advantage it’s sometimes\neasy for us to overlook the bigger picture. While it is\ntrue that attacks typically happen quickly (hours or\nless) when they are well aimed, and it also is true that\nwhen our organizations are successfully breached\nit often takes us months or more to learn of it, there\nis still room for optimism. In the paths section we\nexamined the route that attackers take to get from\npoint A to point B. In this section we take a look at\nthose events that take place prior to the attack, and\nthose required after the attack has ended in order for\nthe attacker to realize their profit.\n\n##### “Give me a place to stand and a lever long enough and I will move the world.”\n —Archimedes\n\nLike all good stories, attackers need somewhere to\nbegin, and whether this starting point is with a list of\nvulnerable servers, phished emails, or stolen creden­\ntials, if the proverbial lever is long enough they will\nbreach your perimeter. Therefore, it is wise to do all\nthat you can to reduce the number of starting points\nthat they are provided. After all, vulns can usually\nbe patched and creds can be better protected with\nmulti-factor authentication. Having said that, we do\nrealize that even the best security departments can\nonly do so much. Sixty-two percent of breaches not\ninvolving an Error, Misuse, or Physical action (in other\nwords, wounds that weren’t self-inflicted) involved\nthe use of stolen creds, brute force, or phishing.\nAnd all that malware doesn’t write itself. Admittedly,\nthere’s not a lot you can do about the development,\npreparation, targeting, distribution, and other\nshenanigans that take place on the part of the bad\nguy before the breach.13 However, what goes down\n\nafter the breach is another story altogether.\n\n\n**Just ask the axis**\n\nLet’s look at what’s being stolen. In Figure 37\nwe illustrate the analysis of the amount lost to\nattackers in two types of breaches: business email\ncompromises and computer data breaches. This\nloss impact data comes courtesy of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint\nCenter (FBI IC3) who have offered some helpful\nhints in the breakout at the end of this section.\nWhen looking at the visualized distribution, the first\nthing to notice is the spike at zero. Not all incidents\nand breaches result in a loss. The second piece of\ngood news is that the median loss for a business email\ncompromise is approximately the same as the average\ncost of a used car. The bad news is that the dollar\naxis isn’t linear. There are about as many breaches\nresulting in the loss of between zero and the median\nas there are between the median and $100 million. We\nare no longer talking about used-car money at this\npoint, unless you happen to be Jay Leno.\n\nAs mentioned above, there’s a great deal that has to\noccur even after the breach takes place to make it\nworth the criminal’s while. For example, business email\ncompromises normally involve the fraudulent transfer\nof funds into an attacker-owned bank account.\n\nComputer\nData Breach\nMedian = $7,611\n(n = 1,711)\n\nBusiness Email\nCompromise\nMedian = $24,439\n(n = 18,606)\n\n$0 $100 $100K $100M\n\n**Dollars**\n\n**Figure 37. Amount stolen by breach type**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 38. Term clusters in criminal forum and marketplace posts**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn this front, we have more glad tidings to impart.\nWhen the IC3 Recovery Asset Team acts upon\nBECs, and works with the destination bank, half of\nall US-based business email compromises had 99%\nof the money recovered or frozen; and only 9% had\nnothing recovered. Let that sink in. BECs do not pay\nout as well as it initially appears, and just because\nthe attacker won the first round doesn’t mean you\nshouldn’t keep fighting.\n\nOn the other hand, BECs are still advantageous for\nthe criminal element because they provide a quick\nway to cash out. Many other types of data breaches\nrequire a little more work on the adversaries’ part to\nconvert stolen data into accessible wealth. A common\nsolution is to sell what you stole, whether PII, email\naddresses, creds, credit card numbers, or access to\nresources you have compromised. Figure 38 provides\ninformation about the numerous things for sale in\nthe darker corners of the Internet (which surprisingly\nenough, resemble a 1990s video game message\nboard). In the center we see a large blue cluster.\nThis is comprised primarily of credit card related\nposts—the buying and selling of credit cards, to make\nmoney, to take money, and to cash out gains. It also\nincludes smaller nodes related to the attacks involved\nin actually stealing the cards. There’s an even smaller\ncluster in the upper right which is related to credential\ntheft. These may grant access to more lucrative\nthings such as bank accounts, but many times are for\nconsumer services including video games, streaming\nvideo, etc., that attackers use directly.\n\n\nThe alternative to posting this data for sale on the\ndark web is using the data to steal identities and\ncommitting direct fraud themselves. Herein lies the\nappeal of stealing tax and health-related information.\nFiling fraudulent tax returns or insurance claims is\na relatively straightforward way to put cash in one’s\npocket. The problem is that tax returns and insur­\nance claims don’t pay out in unmarked bills or wire\ntransfers to South America. This requires another\nstep in the post-breach to-do list: money laundering.\nNormally money laundering is an expensive and\nrisky task. If, for example, the money has to go\nthrough three separate set of hands on its way to\nits final destination, each person needs to take their\nrespective cut. If the third person in the succession\nsays they did not receive it, but the first person\ninsists they sent it, who does the actor believe?\n“There is no honor among thieves,” etc.\n\nThis is in large part why attackers often favor\ncryptocurrency, as is it can be laundered\nand transferred for relatively low cost and presents\nnegligible risk. However, a distinct drawback is\nthat this type of currency is a bit limited with regard\nto what one can purchase with it. Thus, at some\npoint it has to be exchanged. For these and other\nreasons, research into increasing both the risk\nand cost associated with cryptocurrency laundering\nand/or exchange for illicit purposes has a good\ndeal of potential as a means of increasing breach\noverhead and thereby decreasing the relative\nprofit associated with such crimes.\n\n\n**About the IC3**\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet\nCrime Complaint Center (IC3) provides the\npublic with a trustworthy and convenient report­\ning mechanism to submit information concerning\nsuspected internet-facilitated criminal activity.\n\nThe IC3 defines the Business Email\nCompromise (BEC) as a sophisticated scam\ntargeting both business and individuals per­\nforming wire transfer payments.\n\n\nThe Recovery Asset Team (RAT) is an IC3\ninitiative to assist in the identification\nand freezing of fraudulent funds related to\nBEC incidents.\n\nRegardless of dollar loss, victims are\nencouraged and often directed by law enforce­\nment to file a complaint online at www.ic3.gov.\nThe IC3 RAT may be able to assist in the\nrecovery efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Victim demographics\n and industry analysis\n\n**Incidents:** **Total** **Small** **Large** **Unknown** **Breaches: Total** **Small** **Large** **Unknown**\n\n**Accommodation (72)** 87 38 9 40 61 34 7 20\n\n**Administrative (56)** 90 13 23 54 17 6 6 5\n\n**Agriculture (11)** 4 2 0 2 2 2 0 0\n\n**Construction (23)** 31 11 13 7 11 7 3 1\n\n**Education (61)** 382 24 11 347 99 14 8 77\n\n**Entertainment (71)** 6,299 6 6 6,287 10 2 3 5\n\n**Finance (52)** 927 50 64 813 207 26 19 162\n\n**Healthcare (62)** 466 45 40 381 304 29 25 250\n\n**Information (51)** 1,094 30 37 1,027 155 20 18 117\n\n**Management (55)** 4 1 3 0 2 1 1 0\n\n**Manufacturing (31-33)** 352 27 220 105 87 10 22 55\n\n**Mining (21)** 28 3 6 19 15 2 5 8\n\n**Other Services (81)** 78 14 5 59 54 6 5 43\n\n**Professional (54)** 670 54 17 599 157 34 10 113\n\n**Public (92)** 23,399 30 22,930 439 330 17 83 230\n\n**Real Estate (53)** 22 9 5 8 14 6 3 5\n\n**Retail (44-45)** 234 58 31 145 139 46 19 74\n\n**Trade (42)** 34 5 16 13 16 4 8 4\n\n**Transportation (48-49)** 112 6 23 83 36 3 9 24\n\n**Utilities (22)** 23 3 7 13 8 2 0 6\n\n**Unknown** 7,350 0 3,558 3,792 289 0 109 180\n\n**Total** 41,686 429 27,024 14,233 2,013 271 363 1,379\n\n**Table 2**\nNumber of security incidents by victim industry and organization size\n\n\nThe data set for this report totals over 100,000\nincidents, 101,168 to be exact.

This\ndata was provided by several vendors in this space,\nand merged together for analysis. While we realize\nwe were relatively strict earlier about curtailing trash\ntalk on the above Table, feel free to use this for some\ngood-natured banter on an as-needed basis. Just be\nsure to keep it at an appropriate level. “Not looking\nso hot anymore for someone who works outside,\nConstruction” is approximately the correct amount of\nsnark (trust us, we are experts). On a positive note, all\nindustries are clocking in with percentages that are\nless than the overall percentage in this study 2 years\nago.

Click rate in phishing**\ntests by industry\nwe have aligned several non-incident data sources to\nindustry that are worth your while to peruse first.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Denial of Service**\n\nOver time DDoS attacks have been getting much\nmore tightly clumped with regard to size (similar to\nManufacturing in Figure 42). However, as other\nindustries illustrate, that is not always the case. Some\nindustries, Information for instance, experience\nattacks across a much wider range. Another important\ntakeaway is that the median DDoS doesn’t change\nmuch from industry to industry. The difference\nbetween the biggest and smallest industry median is\n800Mbps and 400Kpps.\n\n\n**What’s your vector, Victor?**\n\nFigure 43 takes a look at the median percentage of\nmalware vectors and file types per industry; in\nother words, it helps you know where to look for the\nmalware that’s coming in to your organization and\nwhat it will most likely look like. First of all, the majority\nof initial malware is delivered by email. Secondary\ninfections are downloaded by the initial malware, or\ndirectly installed and, as such, are more difficult\nfor network tools to spot. Secondly, though it varies\na bit by industry, Office documents and Windows\napplications are the most common vehicles for the\nmalware along with “Other” (archives, PDFs, DLLs,\nlinks, and Flash/iOS/Apple/Linux/Android apps).\n\n\n##### BPS PPS\n\n**0.69Gbps** **0.11Mpps**\n\n**1.47Gbps** **0.5Mpps**\n\n**1.27Gbps** **0.36Mpps**\n\n**0.65Gbps** **0.16Mpps**\n\n**0.93Gbps** **0.45Mpps**\n\n**0.7Gbps** **0.11Mpps**\n\n**1.1Gbps** **0.29Mpps**\n\n100 1K 10K 100K 1M 10M 100M 1B 10B 100B 100 1K 10K 100K 1M 10M 100M\n\n**Count**\n\n\nEducation (61)\nn=219\n\nFinance (52)\nn=565\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|0.|69G|bp|s|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|0.11M|pps|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|1.47|Gb|ps|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|0|.5Mpp|s|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nInformation (51)\nn=660\n\nManufacturing (31-33)\nn=161\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|1.27|Gbp|s|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|0.3|6Mpp|s|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|0.|65G|bp|s|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|0.16M|pps|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nProfessional (54)\nn=401\n\nPublic (92)\nn=792\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|0.|93|Gbp|s|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|0.4|5Mpp|s|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|0.7G|bp|s|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|0.11M|pps|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nRetail (44-45)\nn=52\n\n|Density|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|1.1|Gbp|s|Col9|Col10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|0.29|Mpps|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n**Figure 42.

When the infection vector is known,\nit is typically a direct installation after the actors\nuse stolen, guessable, or default credentials to gain\naccess into the POS environment.\n\n**A cause for optimism?**\n\nWhile attacks against POS environments make up the\nvast majority of incidents against Accommodation and\nFood Service organizations, the number has decreased\nfrom 307 in last year’s report to 40 in this report.\nSounds pretty dope so far, but we do not use number\nof breaches as a solid indicator of “better”\nor “worse” as there are not only changes in our\ncontributors, but also changes in the types of events\nour contributors may focus on year over year. Even\nwith such a drastic change, it isn’t unprecedented.\nFigure 44 shows the volatility of breach counts of this\nilk. POS breaches are often conducted by organized\ncriminal groups looking to breach numerous targets\nand there have been sprees of hundreds of victims\nassociated with the same hacking group. Back in 2011,\ndefault credentials were used with great success\nevidenced by over 400 breaches, and recent sprees\nhave been associated with POS vendors suffering\nbreaches leading to subsequent breaches\nof their customer base.\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n**Top 3 patterns**\n\n**Threat actors**\n\n**Actor motives**\n\n**Data compromised**\n\n\n87 incidents, 61 with\nconfirmed data disclosure\n\n\u0007Point of Sale intrusions,\nWeb applications\nand Crimeware patterns\nrepresent 93% of all\ndata breaches within\nAccommodation\n\nExternal (95%), Internal (5%)\n(breaches)\n\nFinancial (100%) (breaches)\n\n\u0007Payment (77%),\nCredentials (25%),\nInternal (19%) (breaches)\n\n\n**How can we be of service?**\n\nThe Accommodation industry prides itself on\nhospitality, and over the years it has been far too\nhospitable to criminals. Financially motivated actors\nare bringing home the bacon by compromising the\nPoint of Sale (POS) environments and collecting\ncustomers’ payment card data. Table 3 lists the 10\nmost common combinations of threat action varieties\nand assets. These are pairings that are found in the\nsame breach, but not necessarily the same event or\nstep in the breach.\n\nAs stated above, some of these combinations are\nindicative of a specific action taken against a specific\nasset (e.g., RAM Scraping malware infecting a\n\n\n-----\n\n**Action** **Asset** **Count**\n\nMalware - RAM scraper Server - POS controller 32\n\n\nMalware - RAM scraper User Dev - POS terminal 27\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds Server - Mail 8\n\n\nSocial - Phishing Server - Mail 8\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds Server - POS controller 7\n\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds User Dev - POS terminal 7\n\nMalware - Backdoor Server - POS controller 6\n\n\nMalware - Backdoor User Dev - POS terminal 6\n\nHacking - Brute force Server - POS controller 5\n\n\nHacking - Brute force User Dev - POS terminal 3\n\n**Table 3**\nTop threat action and asset pairings within Accommodation breaches (n= 61)\n\n\n400\n\n300\n\n\n200\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n\n\n**Figure 44. POS intrusions in Accommodation**\nbreaches over time\n\nThe absence of a large spree in this year’s data set\nis reflected in the drop, but (and it seems like there is\nalways a “but”) after our window for data closed and\nduring this writing there has already been a publicly\ndisclosed POS vendor breach affecting multiple food\nservice victims.14 So, let this be the first ever sneak\n\npeek into the 2020 DBIR – POS attacks are not quite\nan endangered species.\n\n\n**And speaking of delivering bad news**\n\nAccommodation data breach victims are informed\nof their plight the majority of the time via Common\nPoint of Purchase alerts as shown in Figure 45. In\nfact, 100 percent of POS intrusions in this industry\nwere discovered via external methods. This is a\nclear indicator that while there is work to be done\non preventative controls around POS compromise,\nthere is equal room for improvement in detecting\ncompromise. Being a realist and understanding that\nmany of these victims are “mom and pop” operations\nasking for sophisticated file integrity software or\nDLP is not a feasible plan of action for many of these\norganizations. Working with POS vendors to ensure\nthat someone knows when the environment is\naccessed via existing remote access methods is a\nstart. A pragmatic process to inform the business\nowners that legitimate work is being done by the\npartner would certainly be another simple step up\nfrom the current state of affairs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFraud detection\n\nCustomer\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nLog review\n\nBreak in discovered\n\nIT review\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 45. Discovery methods in Accommodation breaches (n=42)**\n\n\n**Cover your assets**\nThe data shows year-over-year that\nthere is a malware problem affecting\nPOS controllers and terminals. Implement\nanti-malware defenses across these\nenvironments and validate (and re–vali­\ndate) the breadth of implementation and\ncurrency of controls. Focus on detective\ncontrols as well, the external correlation\nof fraudulent usage of payment cards\nshould not be the sole means of finding\nout that malware has been introduced\ninto your POS environment. Restrict\nremote access to POS servers and\nbalance the business needs of intercon­\nnectivity between POS systems among\nyour locations with defending against\nthe potential spread of malware from\nthe initial location compromised.\n\n**Sleep with one eye open**\nSince you can’t build a perfectly secure\nsystem, security operations helps\nmonitor for those weird logins in the\nmiddle of the night. If you can justify it\nin your budget, a security operations\nteam is a must. Even if you can’t\nafford an in-house team, contracting it\nas a service or requiring it to be a part\nof your POS or IT contracts will\ncover you and allow you to benefit from\neconomies of scale.\n\n**Chips and Dip**\nWhen a chip-enabled card is dipped in a\nproperly configured EMV-enabled POS\nterminal, the static, reusable magnetic\nstrip information (PAN) is not exposed\nor stored. This is a good thing and along\nwith contactless payment methods,\ndisrupts the old way of stealing things\nfor the bad guys. The attacks against\nEMV technology are more theoretical\nand/or not conducive to real-world use.\nWe know that cyber-criminals are a\ncrafty bunch and nothing is bulletproof,\nbut continue to embrace and implement\nnew technologies that raise the bar to\nprotect against payment card fraud.\n\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n**No vacancy**\nThe numbers from annual breach totals\nare influenced by smaller food service\nbusinesses caught up in what we have\ndescribed as POS smash-and-grabs.\nWhether leveraging default credentials\nor stolen credentials, organized criminal\ngroups often go after numerous little\nfish – but not always. Several interna­\ntional hotel chains and restaurants have\nalso been hit. While the initial intrusion\nmethod may not have been as easy as\nscanning the Internet and issuing a de­\nfault password, there are some lessons\nto be learned. Static authentication is\ncircumvented using valid credentials\nand what follows is installation of RAM\nscraping malware and adminware such\nas psexec or PowerShell to facilitate\nthe spread of malware across multiple\nterminals in multiple locations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Educational\n Services\n\n**\u0007Education continues to be plagued by errors,**\n**social engineering and inadequately secured email**\n**credentials.

There\nwere three patterns in a statistical dead heat and like\nthe Netherlands’ women speed skaters in the 3000m,\nit was a dominant podium sweep. Miscellaneous\nErrors (35%) had a strong showing, because (spoiler\nalert) people still have their moments.

For exam­\nple, there are compromised mail servers, but it was\nundetermined if stolen web credentials were the point\nof entry. About half or more of these breaches could\nbe attributed to social engineering attacks via phishing.\n\nWhen known, the motivation is primarily financial, and\nis carried out mostly by organized criminal groups.\nThere was a smattering of state-affiliated or cyberespionage cases in this year’s data set, a reduction\nfrom the 2017 report as shown in Figure 49. This\nfinding should not convince our readers that attacks\nseeking research findings and other espionage-related\ngoals have gone the way of Home Economics in this\nvertical, but is instead more related to the number and\ntype of incidents provided by our partners.\n\n\nFinancial\n\nEspionage\n\nFun\n\nGrudge\n\nIdeology\n\n\n2016 2018\n\n\n79%\n\n\nDIFF\n\n+33\n\n-31\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n+2\n\n\n45%\n\n43\n\n\n12\n\n9\n\n\n0\n\n\n5\n\n22\n\n2\n\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 49. External motives in Education breaches over time**\nn=44 (2016), n=42 (2018) (Secondary motives excluded)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n**Clean out your lockers**\nMany of the breaches that are repre­\nsented in this industry are a result of\npoor security hygiene and a lack of\nattention to detail. Clean up human\nerror to the best extent possible – then\nestablish a baseline level of security\naround internet-facing assets like web\nservers. And in 2019, 2FA on those\nservers is baseline security.\n\n**Varsity or JV?**\nUniversities that partner with private\nSilicon Valley companies, run policy\ninstitutes or research centers are\nprobably more likely to be a target\nof cyber-espionage than secondary\nschool districts. Understand what\ndata you have and the type of\nadversary who historically seeks it.\nYour institution of learning may not be\nresearching bleeding-edge tech, but\nyou have PII on students and faculty at\nthe very least.\n\n**Security conformity**\nThere are threats that (no matter how\nindividualized one may feel) everyone\nstill has to contend with. Phishing and\ngeneral email security, Ransomware,\nand DoS are all potential issues\nthat should be threat modeled and\naddressed. These topics may not\nseem new, but we still have not\nlearned our lesson.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Financial and\n Insurance\n\n**Denial of Service and use of stolen credentials**\n**on banking applications remain common.**\n**Compromised email accounts become evident**\n**once those attacked are filtered. ATM Skimming**\n**continues to decline.**\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n**Top 3 patterns**\n\n**Threat actors**\n\n**Actor motives**\n\n**Data compromised**\n\n\n927 incidents, 207 with\nconfirmed data disclosure\n\nWeb Applications, Privilege\nMisuse, and Miscellaneous\nErrors represent 72% of\nbreaches\n\nExternal (72%), Internal\n(36%), Multiple parties (10%),\nPartner (2%) (breaches)\n\nFinancial (88%),\nEspionage (10%) (breaches)\n\nPersonal (43%),\nCredentials (38%),\nInternal (38%) (breaches)\n\n\n**Filters are not just for social media photos**\n\nWe use filters in data analysis to focus on particular\nindustries or threat actors and to pull out interesting\ntopics to discuss. We also exclude certain subsets of\ndata in order to reduce skew and avoid overlooking other\ntrends and findings. This is not to say that we ignore\nor deny their existence, but rather we analyze them\n\n\nindependently in other sections of this study. In this\nindustry, we acknowledge, but filter, customer\ncredential theft via banking Trojan botnets. Their\nnumbers in this year’s data set show that they are\nnot inconsequential matters, over 40,000 breaches\nassociated with botnets were separately analyzed\nfor the financial sector. We discuss both of these\nscenarios in more depth in the Results and Analysis\nsection, but there is not much to say that has not\nalready been said on the subjects. Below is what’s left\nand we will start with the common pairings of action\nand asset varieties.\n\nKeep in mind that breaches are often more than\none event, and sometimes more than one of the\ncombinations above are found in the same breach.\n\n**I’d rather be phishing**\n\nWhen we look at the two pairings that share mail\nservers as an affected asset in Table 4, we can see\na story developing. Adversaries are utilizing social\nengineering tactics on users and tricking them into\nproviding their web-based email credentials. That is\nfollowed by the use of those stolen creds to access\nthe mail account. There are also breaches where the\nmethod of mail server compromise was not known,\nbut the account was known to have been used to\nsend phishing emails to colleagues. So, while the\nspecific action of phishing is directed at a human (as,\nby definition, social attacks are), it often precedes or\nfollows a mail server compromise. And there is no law\nthat states that phishing cannot both precede and\nfollow the access into the mail account (there are laws\nagainst phishing, however). Phishing is also a great way\nto deliver malicious payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n**End of an era?**\n\nPhysical attacks against ATMs have seen a decline\nfrom their heyday of the early 2010s. We are hopeful\nthat the progress made in the implementation of EMV\nchips in debit cards, influenced by the liability shift\nto ATM owners, is one reason for this decline. ATM\njackpotting is certainly an interesting way to make a\nbuck, but is not a widespread phenomenon. Figure 50\nhighlights the drop in Payment card data compromise\nfrom last year’s report.\n\nWhile payment card breaches are declining, personal\ndata is showing the largest gain from the 2018\nreport. Focusing on financial breaches where personal\ndata was compromised, social attacks (Everything\nElse), misdelivery of data and misconfigurations\n(Miscellaneous Errors), Web Applications and\nPrivilege Misuse are behind over 85 percent.\n\n\nPersonal\n\nPayment\n\nBank\n\nCredentials\n\n\n2017 2018\n\n\nDIFF\n\n+7\n\n-20\n\n+7\n\n+27\n\n\n14\n\n14\n\n12\n\n\n43%\n\n\n36%\n\n33\n\n21\n\n38\n\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 50.

Use strong\nauthentication on your customerfacing applications, any remote\naccess, and any cloud-based email.\nContrarians will be quick to point out\nexamples of second authentication\nfactors being compromised,\nbut that does not excuse a lack of\nimplementation.\n\n**Squish the phish**\nThere is little that financial\norganizations can do to ensure that\ntheir customers are running up-todate malware defenses or make them\n“phish-proof,” but spreading a little\nsecurity awareness their way can’t hurt.\nAnd speaking of security awareness,\nleverage it to keep employees on their\ntoes when interacting with emails.\n\n**Inside job**\nThere were 45 confirmed breaches\nassociated with misuse of privileges.\nThe details were light on most of\nthese but tried and true controls are\nstill relevant. Monitor and log access\nto sensitive financial data (which we\nthink you are already), and make it\nquite clear to staff that it is being\ndone and just how good you are at\nrecognizing fraudulent transactions.\nIn other words, “Misuse doesn’t pay.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## Healthcare\n\n**Healthcare stands out due to the majority of**\n**breaches being associated with internal actors.**\n**Denial of Service attacks are infrequent, but**\n**availability issues arise in the form of ransomware.**\n\n\nWith internal actors, the main problem is that they\nhave already been granted access to your systems\nin order to do their jobs. One of the top pairings in\nTable 5 between actions and assets for Healthcare\nwas privilege abuse (by internal actors) against\ndatabases. Effectively monitoring and flagging\nunusual and/or inappropriate access to data that is\nnot necessary for valid business use or required\nfor patient care is a matter of real concern for this\nvertical. Across all industries, internal actor breaches\nhave been more difficult to detect, more often taking\nyears to detect than do those breaches involving\nexternal actors.\n\n**Mailing it in**\n\nThe Healthcare industry has a multifaceted problem\nwith mail, in both electronic and printed form. The\nindustry is not immune to the same illnesses we see\nin other verticals such as the very common scenario\nof phishing emails sent to dupe users into clicking and\nentering their email credentials on a phony site. The\nfreshly stolen login information is then used to access\nthe user’s cloud-based mail account, and any patient\ndata that is chilling in the Inbox, or Sent Items, or other\nfolder for that matter is considered compromised – and\nits disclosure time.\n\nMisdelivery, sending data to the wrong recipient, is\nanother common threat action variety that plagues\nthe Healthcare industry. It is the most common error\ntype that leads to data breaches as shown in Figure 51.\nAs seen in Table 5 on the next page, documents are\na commonly compromised asset. This could be due\nto errors in mailing paperwork to the patient’s home\naddress or by issuance of discharge papers or other\nmedical records to the wrong recipient.\n\n**Ransomware “breaches”**\n\nMost ransomware incidents are not defined as\nbreaches in this study due to their lack of the\nrequired confirmation of data loss. Unfortunately\nfor them, Healthcare organizations are required to\ndisclose ransomware attacks as though they\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n**Top 3 patterns**\n\n**Threat actors**\n\n**Actor motives**\n\n**Data compromised**\n\n\n466 incidents, 304 with\nconfirmed data disclosure\n\nMiscellaneous Errors,\nPrivilege Misuse and Web\nApplications represent 81% of\nincidents within Healthcare\n\nInternal (59%), External (42%),\nPartner (4%), and Multiple\nparties (3%) (breaches)\n\nFinancial (83%), Fun (6%),\nConvenience (3%), Grudge (3%),\nand Espionage (2%) (breaches)\n\nMedical (72%),\nPersonal (34%),\nCredentials (25%) (breaches)\n\n\n**The doctor can’t see you now**\n**(that you work for them)**\n\nMost people do not enjoy going to the hospital, but\nonce it becomes unavoidable we all need to believe\nfervently that the good women and men who are\nproviding us care are just this side of perfect. Spoiler\nalert: they are not. Healthcare is not only fast paced\nand stressful, it is also a heavily-regulated industry.\nThose who work in this vertical need to do things\nright, do things fast, and remain in compliance with\nlegislation such as HIPAA and HITECH (in the US).\nThat in itself is a pretty tall order, but when one\ncombines that with the fact that the most common\nthreat actors in this industry are internal to the\norganization, it can paint a rather challenging picture.\n\n\n-----\n\nwere confirmed breaches due to U.S. regulatory\nrequirements.

One might think that with so\nwide an array of victims, the attacks would be all\nover the place, but, in fact, it is our duty to inform\nyou that much of what we saw in this category\nfor the 2019 report mirrors last year’s results. As\nwas the case in 2018, most of the incidents in this\nindustry consists of DoS attacks (63%). In fact, it\nis perhaps fitting that this industry covers both TV\nand motion pictures, since it is in many ways a rerun\nof last year’s programming when viewed from an\nincident point of view.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Action** **Asset** **Count**\n\n\nError - Misconfiguration Server - Database 24\n\n\nSocial - Phishing Person - Unknown 22\n\n\nHacking - Unknown Server - Web application 19\n\n\nMalware - C2 User Dev - Desktop 16\n\n\nSocial - Phishing User Dev - Desktop 16\n\n\nMalware - Backdoor Person - Unknown 15\n\n\nMalware - Backdoor User Dev - Desktop 15\n\n\nMalware - C2 Person - Unknown 15\n\n\nError - Publishing error Server - Web application 14\n\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds Person - Unknown 14\n\n**Table 6**\nTop pairs of threat action varieties and asset varieties, (n= 155)\n\n\n**Faulty towers**\n\nNo one is perfect, but when you are a system administra­\ntor you are often provided with a better stage on which\nto showcase that imperfection. Figure 52 illustrates how\nerrors are put in the spotlight. Our data indicates that\nmisconfiguration (45%) and publishing errors (24%) are\ncommon miscues that allowed data disclosure to occur.\nWhen looking at the relationship between actions and\nassets in Table 6, 36% (24 of 67) of error-related breach­\nes involved misconfigurations on databases, often cloud\nstorage – not good. Obviously, those buckets of data\nare meant to store lots of information and if your bucket\nhas a (figurative) hole in it, then it may run completely\ndry before you make it back home from the well and\nnotice. Often these servers are brought online in haste\nand configured to be open to the public, while storing\nnon-public data. Publishing errors on web applications\noffer a similar exposure of data to a much wider than\nintended audience. Just for cmd shift and giggles, we\nwill mention that programming errors were committed\non web servers and a couple of databases.\n\n\n**It’s not only Charlotte’s Web (apps) you can read about**\n\nEven if your IT department doesn’t make big mistakes\nlike the poor unfortunate souls above, there is no need\nto worry. You still have more excellent chances to get\nyour data stolen. Criminals do love a tempting freshly\nbaked (or half-baked) web application to attack. The illicit\nuse (and reuse) of stolen creds is a common hacking\naction against web applications regardless of industry.\nThe malware action variety of capture app data is more\ncommonly associated with e-retailers, the application\ndata being captured is the user inputting payment\ninformation. While not as common, any internet portals\nor membership sites that sell content as opposed to a\nphysical product would fall into the Information sector.\nAnd payment cards used to purchase content are just as\ngood to steal as ones used to buy shoes online.\n\n\n-----\n\n**I spy with my little eye, something phished**\n\nThe third pattern in Information breaches we\nhighlight is Cyber-Espionage. An eye opening\n36 percent of external attackers were of the stateaffiliated variety, statistically even with organized\ncrime. As we have pointed out many times in the\npast, most Cyber-Espionage attacks begin with a\nsuccessful phishing campaign and that goes some\n\n\nway to explain why 84 percent of social attacks in\nthis industry featured phishing emails.\n\nSir Francis Bacon once famously stated “knowledge\nis power.” Perhaps a better definition for 2019 would\nbe “to gain and to control information is power.”\nTherefore, we should probably not be shocked\nthat the organizations that own and distribute that\ninformation are the target of such attacks.\n\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n**Asset assistance**\nWhether intentional web attacks or erroneous\nactions, both databases and web application\nservers are oft-compromised assets,\nespecially for this industry. Many will complain\nabout”‘checklist security” but a standard\nprotocol regarding bringing up cloud servers\nand publishing sensitive data on websites – if\nimplemented and followed – would go a long\nway to mitigate human error/carelessness.\n\n**Scrubbing packets**\nWhile breaches were at the forefront of this\nsection, DDoS protection is an essential control\nfor Information entities given the percentage\n\n\nof Denial of Service incidents. Guard against\nnon-malicious interruptions with continuous\nmonitoring and capacity planning for traffic\nspikes.\n\n**It bears repeating**\nKnowledge is power, and the increase in\nstate-affiliated attacks is a data point we will\nkeep an eye on. It could very well be a spike\nand not indicative of a trend, but Information\norganizations have desirable data and these\nmotivations would not be likely to disappear in\na year. Understand that these attacks are often\n“phishy” in nature and start with a compromised\nworkstation and escalate from there.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n**Manufacturing has been experiencing an**\n**increase in financially motivated breaches in the**\n**past couple of years, but espionage is still a**\n**strong motivator. Most breaches involve phishing**\n**and the use of stolen credentials.**\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n**Top 3 patterns**\n\n**Threat actors**\n\n**Actor motives**\n\n**Data compromised**\n\n\n352 incidents, 87 with\nconfirmed data disclosure\n\nWeb Applications, Privilege\nMisuse, and Cyber-Espionage\nrepresent 71% of breaches\n\nExternal (75%), Internal (30%),\nMultiple parties (6%), Partner\n(1%) (breaches)\n\nFinancial (68%),\nEspionage (27%), Grudge\n(3%), Fun (2%) (breaches)\n\nCredentials (49%),\nInternal (41%), Secrets (36%)\n(breaches)\n\n\nEthan Hunt15 have finally routed their respective\n\nnemeses for good? Are we free to buy the world\na Coke and teach it to sing in perfect harmony?\nProbably not. A more likely explanation is that some\nof our partners who typically provide data around\ncyber-espionage were either unable to participate\nthis year or simply happened to work other types of\ninvestigations. This may have contributed to a bias\non those results, meaning the real percentage of\ncyber-espionage cases was higher in the wild. If the\nrelative percentage of one type of case goes down,\nthe result is an apparent upswing in the other.\n\nWeb Applications\n\nPrivilege Misuse\n\nCyber-Espionage\n\nMiscellaneous Errors\n\nEverything Else\n\nCrimeware\n\nLost and Stolen Assets\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 53. Patterns in Manufacturing breaches (n=87)**\n\n\n**Uncle Owen, this R2 unit has a financial motivator**\n\nFor the second year in a row, financially motivated\nattacks outnumber cyber-espionage as the main\nreason for breaches in Manufacturing, and this year\nby a more significant percentage (40% difference).\nIf this were in most any other vertical, it would not\nbe worth mentioning as money is the reason for the\nvast majority of attacks. However, Manufacturing\nhas experienced a higher level of espionage-related\nbreaches than other verticals in the past few years.\nSo, shall we conclude that James Bond and\n\n\n-----\n\nSpeaking to the web application attacks, this industry\nshares the same burden of dealing with stolen web­\nmail credentials as other industries.

Hacking vectors in Manufacturing breaches (n=49)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Secrets and truths**\n\nThe Cyber-Espionage pattern, while not as prominent\nas in past reports, is still an attack type that we\nrecommend the Manufacturing industry defend\nagainst. The typical utilization of phishing attacks to\nconvince users to install remote access tools that\nestablish footholds and begin the journey towards\nstealing important competitive information from\nvictims remains the same.\n\nIn keeping with the aforementioned rise in financially\nmotivated attacks, the primary perpetrator when\nknown is organized crime. With regard to data variety,\nthere is a group of four data types that feature\nprominently in this industry. Credentials (49%) and\nInternal data (41%), stem from the webmail attacks – if\na more specific data type is not known, Internal is\nused for compromised organizational emails. Secrets\n(36%) drop from previous heights commensurate to\nthe reduction in espionage as a motive. The fourth\namigo is Personal information (25%), a data type\nthat includes employee’s W-2 information and other\nnuggets that can be used for identity theft.\n\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n**Multiple factors work better**\n**than one**\nIt is a good idea to deploy multiple\nfactor authentication throughout all\nsystems that support it, and discourage\npassword reuse. These actions\nwill definitely help mitigate the impact\nof stolen credentials across the\norganization.\n\n**Recycling also applies for security**\nRegardless of motivation, a large\nnumber of breaches in this sector\nstarted with phishing or pretexting\nattacks. Providing employees with\nfrequent security training opportunities\ncan help reduce the likelihood they will\nbe reeled in by one of those attacks.\n\n**Workers must use safety**\n**equipment at all times**\nUnless inconvenient to do so – due to\nthe prevalence of malware usage in the\nespionage breaches, it is advisable to\ndeploy and keep up-to-date solutions\nthat can help detect and stop those\nthreats.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Professional, Technical and Scientific Services\n\n\n**Phishing and credential theft associated with cloud-**\n**based mail accounts have risen as the prominent**\n**attack types.**\n\n\n2014 2018\n\n\n19%\n\n23\n\n**Breaches**\n\n\n46%\n\n50\n\n5454\n\n\nDIFF\n\n+27\n\n+28\n\n0\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n**Top 3 patterns**\n\n**Threat actors**\n\n**Actor motives**\n\n**Data compromised**\n\n\n670 incidents, 157 with\nconfirmed data disclosure\n\nWeb Applications, Everything\nElse, and Miscellaneous Errors\nrepresent 81% of breaches\nwithin Professional Services\n\nExternal (77%), Internal (21%),\nPartner (5%), Multiple parties\n(3%) (breaches)\n\nFinancial (88%), Espionage\n(14%), Convenience (2%)\n(breaches)\n\nCredentials (50%),\nInternal (50%), Personal (46%)\n(breaches)\n\n\nPersonal\n\nCredentials\n\nInternal\nor\nSecrets\n\n\n**Figure 56.

A lot of this comes from\nbreaches now compromising multiple data types at\nthe same time. Often, credentials are the key that\nopens the door for other actions. Figure 57 shows\nthat most of the time, it’s on the way to compromise\nInternal and/or Personal data. This is indicative of\ngaining access to a user’s inbox via webmail login\nusing stolen credentials.\n\n\n**Wide range of services, narrower range of threats**\n\nProfessional Services is a broad category even by\nNAICS standards, and the members of its ranks\ninclude law offices, advertising agencies, and\nengineering and design firms, to name only a few.\nStarting with a focus on the data lost in the 157\nProfessional Services breaches, Figure 56 gives us\nan idea of the types of data most commonly involved\nin these cases.\n\n\n-----\n\nInternal\n\nPersonal\n\nNo other variety\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 57.

Don’t forget to\naudit where all your doors are.

At least we know where it’s\ncoming from. Monitor email for links and\nexecutables (including macro-enabled Office\ndocs). Give your team a way to report potential\nphishing or pretexting.\n\n**To err is human**\nSet your staff up for success. Monitor what\nprocesses access personal data and add in\nredundant controls so that a single mistake\ndoesn’t result in a breach.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Public\n Administration\n\n**Cyber-Espionage is rampant in the Public sector, with**\n**State-affiliated actors accounting for 79 percent of all**\n**breaches involving external actors. Privilege Misuse and**\n**Error by insiders account for 30 percent of breaches.**\n\n\nThe most common pairings of threat actions and\nassets in Table 7 tells a story that is as easy to follow\nas “See Spot Send Malicious Attachments and Gain a\nFoothold.” We have a gang of five threat actions found\nin breaches that had a human asset16 and a workstation\n\nas affected assets. We are seeing the familiar phish >\nbackdoor/C2 > use of the newly acquired channel into\nthe network. Admittedly we do not have as much data\nas to what is happening beyond the deception and\ninitial device compromise. The inclusion of keylogging\nmalware is a good indicator that additional credential\ntheft and reuse is a likely next step.\n\n\n**Frequency**\n\n**Top 3 patterns**\n\n**Threat actors**\n\n**Actor motives**\n\n**Data compromised**\n\n\n23,399 incidents, 330 with\nconfirmed data disclosure\n\nCyber-Espionage,\nMiscellaneous Errors and\nPrivilege Misuse represent\n72% of breaches\n\nExternal (75%), Internal (30%),\nPartner (1%), Multiple parties\n(6%) (breaches)\n\nEspionage (66%), Financial\n(29%), Other (2%) (breaches)\n\nInternal (68%), Personal (22%),\nCredentials (12%) (breaches)\n\n\nCyber-Espionage\n\nEverything Else\n\nPrivilege Misuse\n\nWeb Applications\n\nMiscellaneous Errors\n\n\n2017 2018\n\n\nDIFF\n\n+17\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n+1\n\n\n12\n\n10\n\n16\n\n\n42%\n\n\n11\n\n\n25%\n\n17\n\n\nGiven the sheer number of incidents in this sector, you\nwould think that the government incident responders\nmust either be cape and tights wearing super heroes,\nor so stressed they’re barely hanging on by their\nfingernails. And while that may yet be the case, keep\nin mind that we do have very good visibility into this\nindustry, in part due to regulatory requirements that\nmembers (at least in the United States) must report\ntheir incidents to one of our data sharing partners (the\nUS-CERT). Arguably more interesting is the fact that\nwith similar breach numbers from last year’s report,\nthe makeup of the breaches has seen some change.\n\n**Master of whisperers**\n\nWhile the Cyber-Espionage pattern was also the most\nprominent in this industry in last year’s report, the\nnumber of breaches in the Cyber-Espionage pattern is\n168% of last year’s amount. Figure 60 shows how the\npercentages shifted from last year.\n\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 60.

Figure 61 shows how quickly employees in this\nsector are clicking or reporting on phishing emails.\nEarly on in the training similar percentages of users\nare clicking and reporting, but reporting drops off\nafter the first hour, where clicking is more active.\nNot optimal, but since this was sanctioned and not\nactually malicious, nothing was done after the initial\nreporting other than an “atta boy.” Having documented,\nunderstood, and tested incident response plans to\nthe real thing will allow the containment process to\nbegin during that first hour to limit the effectiveness\nand impact through quick identification.

Coming back to the present year’s\ndata set in Figure 63, the times they are a-changing.\n\n\nPoint of Sale\n\nEverything\nElse\n\nCrimeware\n\nPayment Card\nSkimmers\n\nWeb\nApplications\n\nPrivilege\nMisuse\n\nMiscellaneous\nErrors\n\nLost and\nStolen Assets\n\nDenial of\nService\n\nCyberEspionage\n\n\n**Breaches**\n\n**Figure 63. Patterns in Retail breaches over time**\nn=145 (2014), n=139 (2018)\n\n\n-----\n\nEssentially, Web application attacks have punched the\ntime clock and relieved POS Intrusion of their duties.\nThis is not just a retail-specific phenomenon – Figure\n64 comes courtesy of our friends at the National\nCyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) and\ntheir tracking of card-present versus card-not-present\nfraud independent of victim industry.\n\n75% **Card-present**\n\n50%\n\n25% **Card-not-present**\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n**Figure 64. Comparison of card-present vs.**\ncard-not-present fraud\n\n\nThe above shift certainly supports the reduction\nin POS breaches, and to a lesser extent, Payment\nCard Skimming. Pay at the pump terminals at gas\nstations would fall into the retail industry as well. We\nare cautiously optimistic that EMV has diminished\nthe value proposition of card-present fraud for the\ncyber-criminals in our midst. Alas, it will still not\nmake criminal elements eschew money and move to\nself-sustaining communes to lead simpler lives.\n\n**One door closes, kick in another one**\n\nAttacks against e-commerce web applications continue\ntheir renaissance. This is shown in Figure 64 on the left\nas well as Figure 26 back in the Results and Analysis\nsection. To find out more about what tactics are used\nin attacks against payment applications we will go\nback to pairings of threat actions and affected assets.\n\nThe general modus operandi can be gleaned from\nTable 8 below. Attacker compromises a web application\nand installs code into the payment application that\nwill capture customer payment card details as they\ncomplete their purchases. Some breaches had details\nthat specified a form-grabber which would be\ncategorized under Spyware/Keylogger as it is another\nmethod of user input capture. Other times limited\ninformation was provided other than a statement\n\n|Col1|Card-present Card-not-pres|ent|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n**Action** **Asset** **Count**\n\nMalware - Capture app data Server - Web application 49\n\n\nMalware - Spyware/Keylogger Server - Web application 39\n\nHacking - Exploit vuln Server - Web application 15\n\n\nHacking - RFI Server - Web application 11\n\nMalware - Ram scraper Server - POS controller 8\n\n\nMalware - Ram scraper User Dev - POS terminal 7\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds Server - Database 6\n\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds Server - Mail 6\n\nHacking - Use of stolen creds Server - Web application 6\n\n\nMisuse - Privilege abuse Server - Database 5\n\n**T bl** **8**\n\n\n-----\n\nsimilar to “malicious code that harvested payment\ncard data.” The more general functionality of\ncapture app data was used in those instances.\nIn reality there is likely little to no difference between\nthe two pairings. We are also a little short on\ninformation on how the web application was\ncompromised. If a specific method like RFI is noted,\nwe collect it. Often it may be a general notation\nthat a web vuln was exploited, hence the Exploit Vuln\nvariety (new to the latest version of VERIS!). Looking\nat what we do know and channeling our inner William\nof Ockham, this general chain of events is likely: scan\n\n\nfor specific web application vulnerabilities > exploit\nand gain access > drop malware > harvest payment\ncard data > profit. We have seen webshell backdoors\ninvolved in between the initial hack and introduction\nof malware in prior breaches. While that action was\nnot recorded in significant numbers in this data set,\nit is an additional breadcrumb to look for in detection\nefforts. In brief, vulnerable internet-facing e-commerce\napplications provide an avenue for efficient, auto­\nmated, and scalable attacks. And there are criminal\ngroups that specialize in these types of attacks that\nfeast on low-hanging fruit.\n\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n**Integrity is integral**\nThe web application compromises are no\nlonger attacks against data at rest. Code is\nbeing injected to capture customer data\nas they enter it into web forms. Widespread\nimplementation of file integrity software may\nnot be a feasible undertaking. Adding this\nto your malware defenses on payment sites\nshould be considered. This is, of course,\nin addition to patching OS, and payment\napplication code.\n\n\n**Brick and Mort(ar)y**\nContinue to embrace technologies that make it\nharder for criminals to turn your POS terminals\ninto machines of unspeakable doom. EMV, mobile\nwallets – any method that utilizes a one-time trans­\naction code as opposed to PAN is a good thing.\n\n**Not just PCI**\nPayment cards are not the only data variety that\nwould be useful to the criminally-minded community.\nRewards programs that can be leveraged for the\n“points” or for the personal information of your\ncustomer base are also potential targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Wrap up\n\nSo, this concludes our 12th installment of this annual report. If the DBIR were a bottle of\ndecent Scotch whiskey it would cost you around 100 bucks, instead of being free like this\ndocument. Likewise, the decisions you might make after finishing them would probably\ndiffer wildly as well.17 Nevertheless, we hope you gain a certain degree of enjoyment and\n\nenlightenment from both.\n\nOn behalf of the team that labored to produce this document, we sincerely thank you,\nour readers, for your continued support and encouragement of this effort. We believe it\nto be of value to Information Security professionals and to industry at large, and we are\ngrateful for the opportunity to bring it before you once again. As always, a tremendous\nthank you to our contributors who give of their time, effort, insight, and most importantly,\ntheir data. The task of creating this document is in no way trivial and we simply could\nnot do it without their generosity of resources. We look forward to bringing you our 14th\nreport (we are taking the high-rise hotel concept of enumeration here) next year, and in\nthe meantime, may your security budgets be large and your attack surface small. Until\nthen, feel free to reflect on the more noteworthy publicly disclosed security events in\n2018 from the VTRAC before jumping into the Appendices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Year in review\n\n\n**January**\n\nOn the second day of the\nyear, the Verizon Threat\nResearch Advisory Center\n(VTRAC) began to learn that\nresearchers had discovered\n“Meltdown” and “Spectre,”\nnew information disclosure\nvulnerabilities in most\nmodern microprocessors.\nThe vulnerabilities lie in\nfoundational CPU architec­\ntures. Patching continued\nthrough 2018. We collected\nno reports of successful\nMeltdown or Spectre attacks\nin 2018. The first week of\nthe month included the first\nreport of malware attacks\ntargeting the 2018 Winter\nOlympics in Pyeongchang,\nRepublic of Korea. Investi­\ngative journalists reported\nIndia’s national ID database,\n“Aadhaar,” suffered a data\nbreach affecting more than\n1.2 billion Indian citizens.\nWe began collecting reports\nof targeted attacks on Latin\nAmerican banks. Attackers\nused disk wiping malware,\nprobably to eliminate\nevidence of their actions\nand minimize the scale\nof the banks’ losses. On\nJanuary 26th, we collected\nthe first report of GandCrab\nransomware.\n\n\n**February**\n\nThe first “zero-day” in Adobe\nFlash kicked off February\nafter APT37 embedded\nan exploit in Excel spread­\nsheets.

March’s Drupal\nvulnerability did indeed\nattract cybercriminals. A\nvariant of the Mirai IoT\nbotnet began scanning for\nvulnerable Drupal servers\nand the subsequent\ncompromises to install\ncryptomining software\nbecame known as\nDrupalgeddon2. The\ncyber-heist of US$150,000\nin Ethereum from\nMyEtherWallet paled in\nsignificance to the BGP\nhijacking of the Internet’s\ninfrastructure to do it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**May**\n\nIntelligence about the\n“Double Kill” zero-day\nvulnerability in Internet\nExplorer was collected at\nthe end of April. In May, the\nVTRAC collected intelligence\nof a malicious PDF docu­\nment with two more zero-day\nvulnerabilities, one each in\nAdobe PDF Reader and in\nWindows.

These\nindividuals were responsible for some of the most significant and widely publicized\ndata breaches of public and private industry networks. Over this period, the Secret\nService’s Cyber Division has cultivated mutually beneficial partnerships with law\nenforcement agencies around the globe, which has extended the reach of the\nSecret Service’s investigative efforts far beyond its traditional limits. This network\nof collaborative partners has enabled the Secret Service to successfully extradite\ncriminal suspects located overseas and have them face prosecution in the United\nStates. The Secret Service continues to forge new international partnerships in\nfurtherance of its mission to pursue and apprehend cybercriminals regardless of\ntheir geography.\n\nAs part of its mandate to combat financially motivated cybercrime, the Secret Service\ncombines its investigative efforts with educational outreach programs. These are\naimed at strengthening the ability of private and public sector entities to protect\nthemselves against a range of cybercrimes. The Secret Service conducts in-depth\nanalyses of the activities, tools, and methodologies used by the cybercriminals during\nthe commission of their crimes to better assess the evolving threats that cybercrimi­\nnals pose to financial institutions and other potential targets. The Secret Service then\nshares the results of these reviews with its network of public and private partners\nthrough its outreach programs.\n\nThe Secret Service’s Cyber Division has learned that the most prescient information\nabout cybercrime trends often comes from the cybercriminals themselves. The\nSecret Service conducts extensive debriefings of arrested cybercriminals and uses\ntheir first-hand knowledge to understand more fully the spectrum of variables they\nused to identify and select a particular target for intrusion and exploitation. The\nSecret Service has recently completed such debriefings with a handful of highly\nskilled cybercriminals who were responsible for some of the most significant network\nintrusions in history, and has found that the ways in which these individuals select\ntheir targets and perpetrate their crimes share certain common features.\n\n\n-----\n\nCybercriminals prey upon human error, IT security complacency, and technical\ndeficiencies present in computer networks all over the world. Individually, each of\nthese tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) discussed below are not always\ninitially successful and may seem easily mitigated; it is when multiple TTPs are\nutilized in concert that cybercriminals are able to gain and maintain access to a\ncomputer network, no matter their motives. Once they are inside a network their\nprocess is almost always the same: establish continued access, escalate or obtain\nadministrator privileges, move slowly and quietly to map the entire network, look\nfor open ports, locate the “crown jewels,” and exfiltrate the data undetected for as\nlong as possible.\n\nThe selection of a target is a continual process. Cybercriminals do their research.\nAlmost always during these interviews, the hackers referred to gathering valuable\nintelligence from the same cybersecurity blogs, online IT security publications, and\nvulnerability reports that network administrators should be monitoring. They know\nthat once a vulnerability is revealed, they still have a limited amount of time to try to\nexploit that vulnerability at a potential victim organization. Every time a vulnerability\nis disclosed or a system update or patch is released, a hacker sees an opportunity.\nThey research the disclosure or update notes to learn if they can exploit the vulner­\nability and where, searching for their best opportunity to monetize the vulnerability.\nHackers also communicate vulnerability information and exploit techniques on\nhacking forums. Once a target is selected, the hacker conducts thorough research\ninto the victim organization and their network(s), often using free and commercially\navailable Internet scanning tools that reveal extremely useful information about the\nvictim company’s network.\n\nWebserver and/or webpage hacking has been a highly successful primary attack\nvector, as there are various potential avenues for exploitation. These include the\nmain website of an institution or a less protected linked website, which in turn can\nprovide access to the main network. The added use of Structured Query Language\n(SQL) database injections of malicious code has been a very effective attack vector\nbecause these types of intrusion techniques can be deployed at any access point\nof a website. There are additional webserver attack vectors such as overlooked or\nforgotten IP addresses, possibly from development or beta-testing and external\nwebservers or data servers that share the same or common domain. Unmanaged\nservers that still utilize Unicode can be exploited via encoding the URL with certain\ncharacters to bypass application filters.\n\nOther traditional and effective attack vectors should not be overlooked. These include\nspear phishing for login credentials or malware delivery and “Man in the Middle”\nattacks through poorly secured routers or web gateways. Botnets are a relatively\ninexpensive tool that have been used to degrade or brute force attack networks in\nconnection with parallel tactics. A very skilled hacker admitted to the Secret Service\nthat he ended up paying a collusive employee (insider threat) when all of his other\nhacking attempts to access a foreign bank’s network were unsuccessful.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce inside a network, cybercriminals continue to do their research and\nreconnaissance. Hackers often examine a webserver’s default error pages because\nthose pages expose a lot of the target network’s system information. Cybercriminals\ntake all of network information they can collect and utilize virtual machines (VMs)\nto build a mock system to emulate the network of the victim company. This is done\nboth for testing their methods of exploitation and for better understanding the types\nof network defenses present within the system.\n\nThe exploits used by cybercriminals inside a target network depend on the installed\nnetwork defenses. Undoubtedly, the hacker will try to install a web shell to ensure\naccess into the system. Another sustainment method is the use of cross-site scripting\n(XSS) for session hijacking (cookie stealing) of a valid user through malicious\ncode injections into a user’s JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, or other code bank. The use\nof malware delivered to the valid user via spear phishing is a key component of\nthis process.\n\nIn addition, hackers utilize directory transversal attacks (directory climbing, back­\ntracking, etc.) on web servers to attempt to reach otherwise restricted directories,\nsuch as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) private keys and password files. Hackers can even\nexecute commands on the server by accessing such directories. After administrator\nprivileges are obtained, it is common for the prized data to be exfiltrated by tunneling\nvia a remote access protocol. Cybercriminals will also scan for open ports and\nattempt to install software of their choosing on non-standard ports for a variety\nof malicious uses. If the targeted network has the potential to provide valuable\ndata continuously, diligent hackers will continuously clean up their “tracks” within\nthe exploited network to obfuscate their presence indefinitely. Another prominent\nhacker described having persistent access into a company’s networks for 10 years\nusing multiple “backdoors” (web shells) and continually cleaning up his “work” to go\nundetected. In reality, many of the hackers we debriefed often stated that they could\nsee traces of other hackers in the targeted network which sometimes made it harder\nto hide their hacking exploits.\n\nThese are just some of the tactics, techniques and procedures the Secret Service\nhas observed used by criminal groups to exploit victim networks. The threat is real\nand the adversary is constantly evolving, driven by diverse and varying motivations.\nTheir success is more often dependent on how well network administrators can\nadapt their defenses to potential vulnerabilities as they are revealed.\n\nThe Secret Service will continue to pursue, arrest, and prosecute cybercriminals no\nmatter where they are and we will continue to provide valuable attack methodology\nanalysis from our investigations to better improve the cybersecurity efforts of our\npartners in law enforcement, academia, and the public and private sectors alike.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B:\n Methodology\n\nOne of the things readers value most about this report is the level of rigor and\nintegrity we employ when collecting, analyzing, and presenting data. Knowing our\nreadership cares about such things and consumes this information with a keen eye\nhelps keep us honest. Detailing our methods is an important part of that honesty.\n\nOur overall methodology remains intact and largely unchanged from previous years.\nAll incidents included in this report were individually reviewed and converted\n(if necessary) into the VERIS framework to create a common, anonymous aggregate\ndata set. If you are unfamiliar with the VERIS framework, it is short for Vocabulary\nfor Event Recording and Incident Sharing, it is free to use, and links to VERIS\nresources are at the beginning of this report.\n\nThe collection method and conversion techniques differed between contributors. In\ngeneral, three basic methods (expounded below) were used to accomplish this:\n\n**1.** \u0007Direct recording of paid external forensic investigations and related intelligence\n\noperations conducted by Verizon using the VERIS Webapp.\n\n**2.** Direct recording by partners using VERIS.\n\n**3.** Converting partners existing schema into VERIS.\n\nAll contributors received instruction to omit any information that might identify\norganizations or individuals involved.\n\nReviewed spreadsheets and VERIS Webapp JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are\ningested by an automated workflow that converts the incidents and breaches within\ninto the VERIS JSON format as necessary, adds missing enumerations, and then\nvalidates the record against business logic and the VERIS schema. The automated\nworkflow subsets the data and analyzes the results. Based on the results of this\nexploratory analysis, the validation logs from the workflow, and discussions with the\npartners providing the data, the data is cleaned and re-analyzed. This process runs\nnightly for roughly three months as data is collected and analyzed.\n\n**Incident eligibility**\n\nFor a potential entry to be eligible for the incident/breach corpus, a couple of\nrequirements must be met. The entry must be a confirmed security incident, defined\nas a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. In addition to meeting the baseline\ndefinition of “security incident” the entry is assessed for quality. We create a subset\nof incidents (more on subsets later) that pass our quality filter. The details of what is\na “quality” incident are:\n\n\n-----\n\n**• \u0007The incident must have at least seven enumerations (e.g., threat actor variety,**\n\nthreat action category, variety of integrity loss, et al.) across 34 fields OR\nbe a DDoS attack. Exceptions are given to confirmed data breaches with less\nthan seven enumerations.\n\n**• \u0007The incident must have at least one known VERIS threat action category**\n\n(hacking, malware, etc.)\n\nIn addition to having the level of detail necessary to pass the quality filter, the incident\nmust be within the timeframe of analysis, (November 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018\nfor this report). The 2018 caseload is the primary analytical focus of the report, but\nthe entire range of data is referenced throughout, notably in trending graphs. We\nalso exclude incidents and breaches affecting individuals that cannot be tied to an\norganizational attribute loss. If your friend’s personal laptop was hit with CryptoLocker\nit would not be included in this report.\n\nLastly, for something to be eligible for inclusion into the DBIR, we have to know about\nit, which brings us to sample bias.\n\n**Acknowledgement of sample bias**\n\nWe would like to reiterate that we make no claim that the findings of this report are\nrepresentative of all data breaches in all organizations at all times. Even though\nthe combined records from all our contributors more closely reflect reality than any\nof them in isolation, it is still a sample. And although we believe many of the findings\npresented in this report to be appropriate for generalization (and our confidence\nin this grows as we gather more data and compare it to that of others), bias\nundoubtedly exists. Unfortunately, we cannot measure exactly how much bias exists\n(i.e., in order to give a precise margin of error). We have no way of knowing what\nproportion of all data breaches are represented because we have no way of knowing\nthe total number of data breaches across all organizations in 2018. Many breaches\ngo unreported (though our sample does contain many of those). Many more are as\nyet unknown by the victim (and thereby unknown to us).\n\nWhile we believe many of the findings presented in this report to be appropriate,\ngeneralization, bias, and methodological flaws undoubtedly exist. However, with 73\ncontributing organizations this year, we’re aggregating across the different collection\nmethods, priorities, and goals of our partners. We hope this aggregation will help\nminimize the influence of any individual shortcomings in each of the samples, and the\nwhole of this research will be greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n**Statistical analysis**\n\nWe strive for statistical correctness in the DBIR. In this year’s data sample, the confidence\ninterval is at least +/- 2% for breaches and +/- 0.5%18 for incidents. Smaller samples of\n\nthe data (such as breaches within the Espionage pattern) will be even wider as the size\nis smaller. We have tried to treat every statement within the DBIR as a hypothesis19 based\n\non exploratory analysis and ensure that each statement is accurate at a given confidence\nlevel (normally 95%). We’ve tried to express this confidence in the conditional probability\nbar charts explained in the “tidbits” that precede the Table of Contents.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur data is non-exclusively multinomial meaning a single feature, such as “Action,”\ncan have multiple values (i.e., “social,” “malware,” and “hacking”). This means that\npercentages do not necessarily add up to 100 percent. For example, if there are 5\nbotnet breaches, the sample size is 5. However, since each botnet used phishing,\ninstalled keyloggers, and used stolen credentials, there would be 5 social actions, 5\nhacking actions, and 5 malware actions, adding up to 300 percent. This is normal,\nexpected, and handled correctly in our analysis and tooling.\n\nAnother important point is that, when looking at the findings, “unknown” is equivalent\nto “unmeasured.” Which is to say that if a record (or collection of records) contain ele­\nments that have been marked as “unknown” (whether it is something as basic as the\nnumber of records involved in the incident, or as complex as what specific capabilities\na piece of malware contained) it means that we cannot make statements about that\nparticular element as it stands in the record—we cannot measure where we have too\nlittle information. Because they are “unmeasured,” they are not counted in sample\nsizes. The enumeration “Other” is, however, counted as it means the value was known\nbut not part of VERIS. Finally, “Not Applicable” (normally “NA”) may be counted or not\ncounted depending on the hypothesis.\n\n**Data Subsets**\n\nWe already mentioned the subset of incidents that passed our quality requirements,\nbut as part of our analysis there are other instances where we define subsets of\ndata. These subsets consist of legitimate incidents that would eclipse smaller trends\nif left in. These are removed and analyzed separately (as called out in the relevant\nsections). This year we have two subsets of legitimate incidents that are not analyzed\nas part of the overall corpus:\n\n**1. \u0007We separately analyzed a subset of web servers that were identified as secondary**\n\ntargets (such as taking over a website to spread malware).\n\n**2.** We separately analyze botnet-related incidents.\n\nBoth subsets were separately analyzed last year as well.\n\nFinally, we create some subsets to help further our analysis. In particular, a single\nsubset is used for all analysis within the DBIR unless otherwise stated. It includes only\nquality incidents as described above and the aforementioned two subsets.\n\n**Non-incident data**\n\nSince 2015, the DBIR includes data that requires the analysis that did not fit into our\nusual categories of “incident” or “breach.” Examples of non-incident data include\nmalware, patching, phishing, DDoS, and other types of data. The sample sizes for\nnon-incident data tend to be much larger than the incident data, but from fewer\nsources. We make every effort to normalize the data, (for example reporting on the\nmedian organization rather than the average of all data). We also attempt to combine\nmultiple contributors with similar data to conduct the analysis wherever possible.\nOnce analysis is complete, we try to discuss our findings with the relevant contributor\nor contributors so as to validate it against their knowledge of the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C:\n Watching the watchers\n\nLast year in the “Feeling vulnerable?” appendix, we discussed the services or\nweaknesses attackers look for in spray and pray internet scans, and how those aren’t\nnecessarily the same things they look for in targeted attacks. In this section, we again\nexamine what services are open to the internet and the adversary activity against\nthem. At the risk of stating the obvious, what the attacker looks for tells you a great\ndeal about what is of value to them.\n\n\n**Any port in a storm**\n\nPorts that offer at least some value to, and at the same time require the least amount\nof investment from the attacker garner a lot of attention. An economist might call\nthe amount invested by the actor per attack the marginal cost. The very best attacks\nfrom the criminal’s point of view would cost almost nothing per target. We will refer to\nthese as zero-marginal-cost attacks.\n\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\n20\n\n30\n\n\n40\n\n50\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||8080 445|23 22|80 53 123|\n|5060|8000||21 1|443 37 1900|\n||3389||161|389|\n||||11211||\n|||500|||\n||2|5|||\n\n\n50 40 30 20 10 1\n\n**Port rank in DDoS attacks**\n\n\n**Figure 65. Comparison of ports in DDoS and honeypot attacks**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 65 illustrates the ports that are in the top 50 for both honeypot activity\nand DDoS attacks (with “1” in the upper right being the most common and the rest\ndecreasing from that point). We can consider how often attackers look for a given port\nas an indicator for how valuable they are to the attacker. Ports below the red line, such\nas cLDAP (389), DNS (53), and NTP (123) are more valuable due to their DDoS ampli­\nfication potential. The ports above the red line are more valuable for their non-DDoS\nmalevolence including SSH (22), telnet (23), HTTP (8080), NetBIOS (445), and others.\n\n**Portémon Go**\n\n\nProbably the most effective way to judge perceived value for the attacker for a given\nport in zero-marginal-cost attacks is to examine their ranking in honeypot scans vs\ntheir general population ranking on the Internet. There are a myriad of organizations\nthat scan the internet regularly, and there are a few of those who are gracious\nenough to contribute to the DBIR. As a result, we can share this data in Figure 66.\n\ntelnet\n(23)\n\n\nDell Open\nManagement (1311)\n\nNetBIOS\n(445)\n\n\nVarious trojans\n(6969)\n\nNetis Routers\n(53413)\n\n\nMS SQL\nServer (1433)\n\nmemcached\n(11211)\n\nBuilding\nManagment\n(47808)\n\n\ncLDAP\n(389)\n\nVarious\n(8888)\n\n\n0x 5x 10x 15x\n\n\n**Ratio of honeypot events rank**\n**to internet scans rank**\n\n**Figure 66. Ports scanned for more often than they exist**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 66 lists the top 10 ports by ratio of honeypot activity to internet prevelance.20\n\nSome of these, for example, Telnet, NetBIOS, and SQL Server – legacy services with\nknown weaknesses that are old enough to vote – may not be as common as dirt, but\nthey still exist and when an attacker finds them you can almost hear the intro to Pink\nFloyd’s “Money” floating in the ether. If your organization has any of these services\nexposed to the internet, it’s probably a good idea to go and take care of that now.\nWe’ll wait here. Take your time. This report changes once a year, but those ports are\nbeing hammered daily.\n\n**Dime a dozen**\n\nThe above section begs the question, “If those ports are what attackers frequently\nsearch for but rarely find, which open ports are plentiful but rarely sought?” We are\nglad you asked. For the most part they are unassigned or ephemeral ports. Of more\ninterest are the ports that appear in vulnerability scans, but do not show up in honey­\npots. Figure 67 gives us some insight into that area. The main takeaway is that there\nare a lot of ports far down on the list from a honeypot perspective (the big cluster in\nthe lower left of the figure) that get reported often in vulnerability scans. Those are\nthe vulnerabilities that may be useful for attackers but either only for niche attacks or\ninternal pivoting, or are of absolutely no interest whatsoever to the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n10\n\n\n100\n\n1,000\n\n\n10,000\n\n100 10\n\n|23 8080 53|22 80 445 123|\n|---|---|\n|8000 21 1311 161 81 389 5061 500 9090 25 8081 110 8082 5353 623|443 1433 3389 8443|\n|5000 10000 995 143 7002 636 993 8089 8880 5556 9443 7004 587||\n|8444 1521 5480 3269 9043 5989 6701 8445 3071|2381 0|\n|||\n\n\n**Vulnerability scans port rank (log scale)**\n\n**Figure 67. Comparison of ports in vulnerability scans and honeypot events**\n\n\n**Take action**\n\nThere may only be seven seas, but there are 65,535 ports. While not all are found in\nthe figures above, a great many are. So now what? We suggest you take a look to\nascertain if you are vulnerable to any zero-marginal-cost attacks (easily identified by\ntheir honeypot to internet scan ratio). If so, you are operating below a critical security\nthreshold and you need to take action to get above it. Are you running a honeypot\nyourself? If not, why is that port open? Finally, take a cue from the Unbroken Chains\nsection and be smart about what else you mitigate.
