During the forensic**\n**analysis of artefacts left by the group in South-East Asian and European banks,**\n**Kaspersky Lab has reached a deep understanding of what malicious tools the group**\n**uses and how it operates while attacking financial institutions, casinos, software**\n**developers for investment companies and crypto-currency businesses around the**\n**world. This knowledge has helped to interrupt at least two other operations which had**\n**one goal - to steal a large amount of money from financial institutions.**\n\nIn February 2016, a group of hackers (unidentified at that time) attempted to steal $851\nmillion USD, and managed to transfer 81 million USD from the Central Bank of Bangladesh.\nThis is considered to be one of the largest, most successful cyber heists ever. Further\ninvestigation conducted by researchers from different IT security companies including\nKaspersky Lab revealed a high chance that the attacks were conducted by Lazarus – a\nnotorious cyber espionage and sabotage group responsible for a series of regular and\ndevastating attacks, and known for attacking manufacturing companies, media and financial\ninstitutions in at least 18 countries around the world since 2009.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough several months of silence followed the Bangladesh attack, the Lazarus group was\nstill active. They had been preparing for a new operation to steal money from other banks\nand, by the time they were ready, they already had their foot in a financial institution in South\nEast Asia. After being interrupted by Kaspersky Lab products and the following investigation,\nthey were set back for another few months, and later decided to change their operation by\nmoving to Europe. But here too, their attempts were interrupted by Kaspersky Lab’s security\nsoftware detections, as well as the quick incident response, forensic analysis, and reverse\nengineering with support from company’s top researchers.\n\n**Lazarus Formula**\n\nBased on the results of the forensic analysis of these attacks, Kaspersky Lab researchers\nwere able to reconstruct the modus operandi of the group.\n\n**Initial compromise: A single system inside a bank is breached either with remotely**\naccessible vulnerable code (i.e. on a webserver) or through a watering hole attack\nthrough an exploit planted on a benign website. Once such a site is visited, the victim’s\n(bank employee) computer gets malware, which brings additional components.\n**Foothold established: Then the group migrates to other bank hosts and deploys**\npersistent backdoors – the malware allows them to come and go whenever they want.\n**Internal reconnaissance: Subsequently the group spends days and weeks learning**\nthe network, and identifying valuable resources. One such resource may be a backup\nserver, where authentication information is stored, a mail server or the whole domain\ncontroller with keys to every “door” in the company, as well as servers storing or\nprocessing records of financial transactions.\n**Deliver and steal: Finally, they deploy special malware capable of bypassing the**\ninternal security features of financial software and issuing rogue transactions on behalf\nof the bank.\n\n**Geography and Attribution**\n\nThe attacks investigated by Kaspersky Lab researchers lasted for weeks. However, the\nattackers could operate under the radar for months. For example, during the analysis of the\nincident in South-East Asia, experts discovered that hackers were able to compromise the\nbank network no less than seven months prior to the day when the bank’s security team\nrequested incident response. In fact, the group had access to the network of that bank even\nbefore the day of the Bangladesh incident.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab records, from December 2015, malware samples relating to\nLazarus group activity appeared in financial institutions, casinos software developers for\ninvestment companies and crypto-currency businesses in Korea, Bangladesh, India,\nVietnam, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Poland, Iraq, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Uruguay,\nGabon, Thailand and several other countries. The latest samples known to Kaspersky Lab\nwere detected in March 2017, showing that attackers have no intention of stopping.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven though attackers were careful enough to wipe their traces, at least one server they\nbreached for another campaign contained a serious mistake with an important artefact being\nleft behind. In preparation for operation, the server was configured as the command & control\ncenter for the malware. The first connections made on the day of configuration were coming\nfrom a few VPN/proxy servers indicating a testing period for the C&C server. However, there\nwas one short connection on that day which was coming from a very rare IP address range\nin North Korea.\n\nAccording to researchers, that could mean several things:\n\nThe attackers connected from that IP address in North Korea\nIt was someone else’s carefully planned false flag operation\nSomeone in North Korea accidentally visited the command and control URL\n\nThe Lazarus group heavily invests in new variants of their malware. For months they were\ntrying to create a malicious toolset which would be invisible to security solutions, but every\ntime they did this, Kaspersky Lab’s specialists managed to identify unique features in how\nthey create their code, allowing Kaspersky Lab to keep tracking the new samples. Now, the\nattackers have gone relatively quiet, which probably means that they have paused to rework\ntheir arsenal.\n\n“We’re sure they’ll come back soon. In all, attacks like the ones conducted by Lazarus group\n_show that a minor misconfiguration may result in a major security breach, which can_\n_potentially cost a targeted business hundreds of millions of dollars in loss. We hope that chief_\n_executives from banks, casinos and investment companies around the world will become_\n_wary of the name Lazarus,” said Vitaly Kamluk, Head of Global Research and Analysis Team_\nAPAC at Kaspersky Lab.\n\nKaspersky Lab products successfully detect and block the malware used by the Lazarus\nthreat actor with the following specific detection names:\n\nHEUR:Trojan-Banker.Win32.Alreay*,\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.Agent*\n\nThe company is also releasing crucial Indicators of Compromise (IOC) and other data to help\norganizations search for traces of these attack groups in their corporate networks. For more\n[information go to Securelist.com](https://kas.pr/ix6C)\n\nWe urge all organizations to carefully scan their networks for the presence of Lazarus\nmalware samples and, if detected, to disinfect their systems and report the intrusion to law\nenforcement and incident response teams.\n\nTo learn more about financial attacks by Lazarus group, read the blog post available at\n[Securelist.com or](https://kas.pr/ix6C) [watch the video.](https://youtu.be/9Vh2n6nC0t4)\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus_Eng\n\nKaspersky\nKaspersky Lab has published the results of its more-than-year-long investigation into the\nactivity of Lazarus – a notorious hacking group allegedly responsible for the theft of 81\nmillion dollars from the Central Bank of Bangladesh in 2016.\n\n\n-----",
