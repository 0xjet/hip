Gartner estimates that worldwide expenditures on digital security will exceed](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-08-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-information-security-spending-to-exceed-124-billion-in-2019)\n$124 billion this year. But attackers rarely give up on a target even if their first attempts\n[are unsuccessful. According to FireEye statistics, 64 percent of companies attacked in](https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2019)\n2018 were attacked again in the following 19 months.\n\nA cyberattack against a company with well-organized protection system is time-consuming, expensive, and requires special knowledge and tools. Multistage, well-planned,\nand organized attacks targeting a specific industry or company are called advanced\npersistent threats (APTs). To conduct such attacks, hackers form criminal groups, known\nas APT groups.\n\nIt's extremely difficult to detect an APT attack when it is underway. After obtaining a\nfoothold in a company's infrastructure, criminals can stay there unnoticed for years.\n[For example, the cybersecurity team at German pharmaceutical giant Bayer observed](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/malware/pharma-firm-bayer-hit-with-winnti-malware/)\nmalware activity for over a year. The longest presence of attackers on a network, as\nmeasured by the PT Expert Security Center (PT ESC), was over eight years. However,\n[profit-driven cybercriminals prefer to act quickly. Cosmos Bank fell victim to a cyberat-](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/75703/apt/cosmos-bank-lazarus-apt.html)\ntack by the Lazarus Group, which stole $13.5 million in just three days. In other words,\ncriminals' behavior, techniques, and tools depend on their target.\n\nIn this research, we will try to assess the cost of tools used for APT attacks and how easily these tools can be obtained. We will also analyze how attackers choose their tools\nbased on their target. We hope that our study will assist security decision-makers to\nbetter protect their systems from industry-specific attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Executive summary\n\nIt is impossible to make an exact estimate of how much an APT attack\ncosts. One reason is the difficulty of putting a value on the unique\nsoftware used by criminal groups. All amounts stated in this report\nare approximate; actual APT expenses may be significantly higher.\n\n� Spear phishing is an effective way to penetrate a company's internal network and\nis used by 90 percent of APT groups. Tools for creating malicious attachments, not\nincluding the cost of exploits for zero-day vulnerabilities, cost around $2,000.\n\n� After penetrating the internal network, half of APT groups use legitimate administration tools and commercial penetration testing software costing from $8,000 to\n$40,000.\n\n� By our estimates, the cost of the tools needed for a banking attack would start at\n$55,000. A cyberespionage campaign would be much more expensive, running at\nleast $500,000 to start.\n\n##### About the research\n\nWe have analyzed the tools used by 29 APT groups conducting attacks worldwide\nwith activity during the last two years and threatening key sectors such as government,\nfinance, and industrial companies.\n\nData is based on our incident response expertise and retrospective analysis of security\nevents on corporate infrastructure, as well as on constant monitoring of active APT\ngroups by PT ESC. We have also drawn upon publicly available reports on APT groups\nfrom reputable security companies.\n\nWe identified two main categories of APT groups based on attack motive. The first category includes financially motivated groups, which attack banks and other organizations to steal money. Cyberespionage groups, by contrast, target valuable information\nand seek long-term control over infrastructure.\n\nTools used to obtain initial access to a company's local network are different from those\nused during the later stages of the attack. However, the two types of groups tend to\nuse similar tools when gaining a foothold in the system and performing lateral movement. Therefore, we have split APT tools into two categories:\n\n� Tools used to break into the organization's network (\"Initial access\")\n\n� Tools used to develop the attack on the internal network (\"Attack development\")\n\nWe analyzed postings on 190 darkweb sites and venues about purchase or sale of APT\ntools, as well as custom malware development. We focused on forums, specialized\nmarketplaces, and chats. On average, over 70 million people visit them each month.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 57%\n\nof regional companies were\nhit by phishing attacks\non employees in 2018\n\nSpear phishing is the\nmost common method\nused as an entry point\n\n### 90%\n\nof active APT groups use phishing\nat the initial access stage\n\n**Examples of groups:**\nCobalt, APT29, Lazarus\n\n### $300+\n\ncost of tool to create malicious files\n\n### $ 2,500\n\nmonthly subscription fee for a service\nto create documents with malicious\ncontent\n\n\n### APT tools\n\n##### Initial access\n\nExpenses at the initial compromise stage depend on how exactly attackers deliver malware to the company's infrastructure. The method depends on the attackers' motives\nand the victim's level of protection.\n\nSpear phishing is the main tool of financially motivated attackers. To conduct a phishing attack, a hacker prepares a document containing malware and a loader (dropper).\n\nDocuments containing malicious code can be created using special programs known\nas exploit builders. These programs generate a file with malicious code, which runs\nwhen the file is opened. This code downloads and runs the loader (a small program\nresponsible for downloading the main malware module). The loader is normally used\njust once: running the loader again, even if it is obfuscated, can be detected by antivirus software.\n\nFigure 1. Phishing: malware preparation\nand delivery to local network\n\nThe cost of tools used to create malicious documents depends heavily on whether\nthe malware has the ability to persist on the target system undetected by antivirus\nsoftware. Malware source code costs much higher than a ready-to-use utility. For\nexample, a ready-to-use loader costs only $25, but the source code costs at least $1,500,\nplus time and expenses for further modifications.\n\n\n-----\n\n### $1,500+\n\ncost of loader source code\n\n### $10,000\n\ncost of the exploit builder\nused by Cobalt\n\nFigure 2. Exploit builders\nfor sale\n\n### 14% \n\nof groups conduct watering hole\nattacks at the penetration stage\n\n**Cost: $10,000+**\n\n**Examples of groups: APT29, APT35,**\nTEMP.Periscope, DarkHydrus\n\n\n[Spear phishing is widely used by the Cobalt group. The group constantly refines its](https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/Cobalt-2017-eng.pdf)\ntechniques to exploit the latest vulnerabilities. In 2017, Cobalt obtained an exploit\n[builder for vulnerability CVE-2017-0199, which at the time was being sold for $10,000.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0199)\nToday, exploit builders for the vulnerability can be bought for just $400.\n\nFigure 3. Prices of exploits for vulnerabilities found in 2017\n\nThe financially motivated Silence group also uses spear phishing, exploiting vulnerabili[ties such as CVE-2018-0802 and CVE-2018-8174. Exploits for these vulnerabilities can be](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0802)\nbought on the darkweb for as little as $1,600.\n\nCash-hungry criminals are interested in quick gains (on average, just one week to one\nmonth passes between sending messages and cashing out). Therefore, they are willing\nto buy ready-made tools and send mass phishing emails.\n\nJust like financially motivated attacks, cyberespionage APT efforts usually start with\nphishing. But whereas ordinary criminals might take a scattershot approach targeting\nan entire industry, cyberspies act with precision and careful preparation. For example,\n[in one penetration attempt investigated by PT ESC, the SongXY group sent a docu-](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2018-q4/)\nment with a link to an image on an attacker-controlled server. The link triggered automatically when the document was opened. This allowed attackers to collect additional\ninformation about the server configuration, including the Microsoft Office version in\nuse, and choose a malicious document with the right exploit needed to compromise\nthe system.\n\nThe exploit builders and loaders used by cyberspies are not sold on the darkweb. Even\nroughly estimating the cost of such tools is nearly impossible. One can only compare\nthem with the prices for custom development. Darkweb criminals are ready to pay\n$20,000 or more for custom development of a single tool.\n\nCyberespionage APT groups may prepare malicious emails by hand. They are determined for their malicious code not to be detected by any security system, and focus\nabove all on bypassing the protection tools used by the target organization. Identifying\nthese protection tools is one of the key tasks at the attack reconnaissance stage. These\nattackers carefully choose the layout and text of their messages, making it likely that\nthe victim will open the attachment.\n\nTo further increase the odds of phishing success, cyberespionage APT groups may\neven hack partners and contractors of a target organization and impersonate them\n[in emails. In spring 2019, hackers penetrated the network of IT giant Wipro and sent](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/experts-breach-at-it-outsourcing-giant-wipro/)\nphishing messages to the company's clients.\n\n\n-----\n\n### More than $1,000,000\n\na single exploit for a zeroday vulnerability can cost\n\n### 48%\n\nof APT groups use penetration\ntesting tools\n\n\nAttackers sometimes conduct watering hole attacks. They select web pages regularly\nvisited by a target company's employees, such as partners' websites or industry-specific\nportals. Attackers then hack these websites and install malware on them. If targeted\nemployees subsequently visit the infected websites, the attackers may penetrate the\ncompany's internal network.\n\nCyberespionage groups do not scrimp on expensive exploits for zero-day vulnerabilities,\ncan develop their own tools, and conduct multistage attacks that leverage other\norganizations to get at the ultimate target.\n\nFigure 4. Prices attackers are ready to pay for zero-day vulnerabilities\n\n##### Attack development\n\nInside the infrastructure, an attack passes through several stages: intruders execute\ncode on hosts, escalate privileges, collect data, move among hosts, and create channels for command and control (C2). APT groups use similar tools for attack development\non internal networks. Both financially motivated and cyberspy groups prefer publicly\navailable legitimate software, using self-developed malware or buying utilities on the\ndarkweb only when necessary.\n\nCobalt Strike and Metasploit Pro are commercial frameworks used for penetration testing. However, they enjoy popularity among both security experts and black hats.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Cobalt Strike\n\n**Official price at the time**\n**of this study: $3,500 per year**\n\n**Black market prices:**\n$30,000–$40,000\n\n**Groups:**\nAPT10, APT29, APT32, APT40,\nCobalt, DarkHydrus, Winnti\n\n##### Metasploit Pro\n\n**Official price at the time**\n**of this study: $15,000 per year**\n\n**Modified version with**\n**year of technical support:**\n$8,000–$15,000\n\n**Groups:**\nAPT35, Carbanak, Patchwork,\nSilence, TreasureHunter\n\n##### TeamViewer\n\nLegitimate remote administration tool.\nA modified version is invisible to users\nand has several additional functions,\nincluding built-in keylogger\n\n**Price on the darkweb: $100**\n\n**Groups: Carbanak, Cobalt**\n\n##### Hidden VNC\n\nA modification of the legitimate VNC\nutility, allowing hackers to remotely\nconnect to a user's workstation\nand stay invisible while executing\ncommands\n\n**Price on the darkweb:**\n\n$1,000 per month\n\n**Used by the Carbanak group**\n\n\nThe developers of Cobalt\nStrike, aware of their product's potentially nefarious\nappeal, perform strict checks\non potential customers. As a\nresult, hackers periodically\nexpress interest on the darkweb in obtaining hacked or\nillegally obtained official versions of Cobalt Strike.\n\nMetasploit Pro is also sold\non the darkweb. Available\nversions include hacked\n(\"cracked\") originals as well\nas modified variants containing additional features.\n\nFigure 5. Demand for Cobalt Strike on the darkweb\n\nAfter penetrating a company's infrastructure, financially motivated criminals try to\nquickly identify hosts of interest, such as any computers responsible for outgoing financial transactions. This could be a bank workstation used for interbank transfers or\nthe computer of an accountant at a regular company. To identify these hosts, attackers\nuse free utilities, such as nmap or nbtscan, or more convenient commercial programs\n(for example, Cobalt used SoftPerfect Network Scanner, which has an official price of\n$3,000). The sprawling networks of major organizations are complex and have a large\nnumber of servers and workstations, which forces criminals to acquire special tools for\nhandling such networks.\n\nAfter reaching the hosts of interest, criminals are faced with yet another task—to understand the workings of specialized banking software and how to initiate and confirm\ntransactions. (Sometimes, of course, all of this is old news to the attackers.) Whereas\nbank workstations tend to work in predictable ways, non-financial companies may\nhave to use multiple bank clients on the same machine in order to work with different\nbanks. In these situations, hackers need special tools to observe the desktop of the\ninfected computer, monitor the user's actions in real time, and take videos and screenshots, all while remaining invisible to the employee. They can use hVNC and modified\nversions of TeamViewer, RMS, Ammyy Admin, and others.\n\nFigure 6. Hidden VNC for sale\n\n\n-----\n\n### $400+\n\ncost of a ready-made banking bot, base\nconfiguration (downloading\nand execution of arbitrary files)\n\n### $1,750\n\ncost of Smoke Bot banking malware\nwith full set of modules\n\n##### Sysinternals Suite\n\nLegitimate administration toolkit\n\n**Utilities most commonly used by**\n**attackers: PsExec, ProcDump, PsList,**\nSDelete\n\n**Examples of groups:**\n\nAPT29, Leafminer, OilRig\n\n### $10,000\n\ncost of exploit for escalating\nOS privileges\n\n\nFigure 7. Smoke Bot banking malware for sale\n\nJust like financially motivated criminals, cyberspies will try to entrench themselves in\nthe system and identify key hosts after successfully penetrating the internal network.\nThey are interested in workstations and servers that store and process valuable information, including trade secrets and intellectual property. They also target computers\nof top executives and other key persons, or perhaps servers that allow access to industrial control system (ICS) networks. Before collecting sensitive information, cyberspies\nstudy the business processes of the target company. In order not to attract attention\nor arouse suspicions, they prefer using legitimate administration tools. For example, 48\n[percent of studied APT groups use the free Sysinternals Suite from Microsoft.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)\n\nThe next important step is escalating OS privileges. On the darkweb, criminals can\npurchase exploits for escalating OS privileges by exploiting known or zero-day\nvulnerabilities.\n\nFigure 8. Privilege escalation exploits for sale\n\n\n-----\n\n### $130,000\n\ncost of exploit for a zero-day\nvulnerability in Adobe Acrobat\n\n### $1.6 million\n\ncost of the FinSpy\nspyware framework\n\n### $1,700\n\ncost of an extended validation (EV)\ncode signing certificate\n\n\nExploiting zero-day vulnerabilities is a tried-and-true technique used by cyberespio[nage groups. In one such case, TEMP.Reaper exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68718/cyber-warfare-2/north-korea-adobe-flash-0day.html)\n[Flash. The flaw, now catalogued under number CVE-2018-4878, has a publicly available](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-4878)\n[exploit. Another zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2018-15982) in Adobe Flash was exploited](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15982)\n[in a cyberspy APT attack against a state-run outpatient clinic in Russia. It is difficult to](http://blogs.360.cn/post/PoisonNeedles_CVE-2018-15982_EN.html)\nestimate the cost of an exploit for an unknown vulnerability. However, the cost of an\nexploit for a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat on the darkweb is rather high.\n\nFigure 9. Zero-day vulnerabilities for sale\n\nAttackers can use zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver spyware Trojans. For example, one\n[APT group used zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2017-11292) and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11292)\n[Microsoft .NET Framework (CVE-2017-8759) to deliver FinSpy malware. Also known as](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8759)\nFinFisher, the FinSpy framework is surveillance software able to spy on users through\nan infected computer's webcam and microphone, capture chat messages and emails,\n[and steal passwords and other sensitive data. This Trojan is used by the SandCat APT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/proof-of-concept-code-published-for-windows-7-zero-day/)\ngroup. Besides its considerable spying abilities, FinSpy employs a number of anti-analysis techniques, including code obfuscation and virtual machine detection. All this\nmakes the work of defenders more difficult and explains why the malware costs a\nwhopping €1.5 million.\n\nHackers use various techniques to bypass the protection mechanisms of network hosts.\nFor example, they may sign malicious code with certificates in order to pass it off as\nlegitimate. Ready-to-use certificates are also available on darkweb forums.\n\nFigure 10. Advertisement for signing of malware with legitimate certificates\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Silence \n\n### $288,000\naverage damage from\na successful attack\n\n### $55,000\ncost of toolkit\n\n##### Attack  on PIR Bank\n\n### $930,000\ndamage from attack\n\n### $66,000\n\ncost of toolkit\n\n\nWhen hackers need to access specially protected network segments, such as ICS net[works, they may prefer self-developed tools. In one such case, in the TRITON attack](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/triton-actor-ttp-profile-custom-attack-tools-detections.html)\nagainst industrial companies, malicious actors used custom tools such as SecHack (for\ncollecting credentials) and NetExec (for moving inside the network).\n\nTool sets for entrenchment and lateral movement may cost a financially motivated\ngroup from $30,000 to $35,000. These are, however, one-time expenses. Groups buy\nready-made tool sets and then use them in many future attacks, significantly reducing\nthe financial blow.\n\nAn exploit for a single zero-day vulnerability costs tens or even hundreds of thousands\nof dollars. High prices for exploits do not stop cyberspies. Besides buying exploits,\ncyberspies have the means to develop their own malware able to bypass antivirus\nsoftware and detect when it is being run in a sandbox. All this complicates attacker\ndetection and forces companies to use robust security tools and measures to protect\nsensitive information. Of course, protection will not be effective without around-theclock monitoring by a skilled security operations center (SOC).\n\n##### How much can an APT cost\n\nBesides the software costs discussed already, hackers incur numerous other operational expenses: renting servers, buying domain names, hosting websites, and paying for\n[VPN services, to name a few. Our estimate is that such expenses total approximately](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/darkweb-2018/)\n$1,000, which is well below the cost of attack tools. In this report, we will analyze the\nmain expenses of cybercriminals and illustrate them with data for several actual APT\nattacks. Our conclusions are based on the cost of similar services and software on the\ndarkweb.\n\nIn early 2019, we observed a resurgence of the financially motivated group Silence. Let's\ntry to figure out how much an attack by this group could cost to perform. As mentioned already, a monthly subscription to a service for creating malicious attachments\nwould typically cost $2,500. Silence uses the free Sysinternals Suite plus a number of\nself-developed tools, including the Silence framework, Atmosphere ATM theft toolkit,\n[and a number of others. Incidentally, our research on the criminal cyberservices market](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/darkweb-2018/)\nshowed that malware for ATMs is the most expensive class of ready-made malware on\nthe darkweb, with prices averaging around $5,000. After thorough analysis of cyberservices offered on the darkweb, we come up with a ballpark figure of $55,000 for the\nstarting price of a full set of tools for a financially motivated group like Silence.\n\n[In July 2018, hackers stole the equivalent of $930,000 from PIR Bank in Russia. How](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-russian-bank-and-steal-1-million-due-to-outdated-router/)\nmuch money did the criminals invest in their attack? At the penetration stage, they\nsent phishing messages. In addition to self-developed malware, they actively used\nMetasploit Pro and Sysinternals Suite for movement inside the network. To spy on the\n[bank's employees, they used their own tools and the legitimate NirCmd utility. We](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)\nwould put a price tag of at least $66,000 on this set of tools.\n\nFunds were stolen from PIR Bank via client cards at 22 banks; most of the stolen money\nwas cashed out on the night of the attack itself. To withdraw money and cash out,\ncriminals typically hire so-called money mules. The total cost of such services, including compensation to money mules and related expenses, is 15 to 50 percent of the\ntotal amount stolen. So in this case, the Silence organizers paid between $140,000 and\n$465,000 to obtain the stolen cash.\n\nIt is more difficult to evaluate the cost of a cyberespionage attack. Zero-day vulnerabilities may cost tens of thousands or even millions of dollars on the darkweb. What's\nmore, hackers sometimes use self-developed malware, which is unique to each group.\nWe do not know how such malware is developed in each particular case, nor how\nmuch time and effort it takes to create. Estimating the cost of development is therefore\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APT38\n\n### $41,000,000\naverage damage from\na successful attack\n\n### $500,000+\n\ncost of an attack\n\n\nextremely problematic. To put a lower bound on the cost, we took an advertisement\nfor the cheapest custom malware development we could find on the darkweb.\n\nFireEye experts investigated attacks conducted by APT38, another profit-driven group,\n[and found they were similar to cyberespionage campaigns. The group's tools were the](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38)\nsame as those used for cyberespionage by TEMP.Hermit. APT38 conducts watering\nhole attacks at the penetration stage and burrows into a victim network for an average\nof 155 days, which is atypically long for attacks aimed at stealing money. The group's arsenal contains 26 unique custom malware families. We estimate that the development\ncost of such tools exceeds $500,000.\n\n#### Conclusions and recommendations\n\nThe tools used by hackers in APT attacks vary considerably depending on motivation.\nWhile the cost of attack tools for a financially motivated group is measured in the tens\nof thousands of dollars, for APT cyberespionage groups the figure is higher by an order\nof magnitude. At the same time, victims' losses are many times greater than the costs\nof APT groups. Just a few successful attacks are enough for the \"investment\" in purchasing or developing tools to pay off.\n\nWe recommend that financial organizations actively share information on cyberattacks\nand indicators of compromise at the industry level. Resources such as FS-ISAC significantly reduce the success rates of cyberattacks on financial institutions. It is also vital to\nquickly identify attack traces in infrastructure and constantly monitor the network for\nabnormal activity. This awareness enables detecting and investigating new unknown\nattacks, as well as sharing the results with the rest of the industry.\n\nToday's cyberespionage groups tend to use self-developed malware and exploits for\nzero-day vulnerabilities. Such groups take the time to conduct reconnaissance and\nprepare unique tools to bypass the target's protection. They have particular targets in\nmind, and the smallest mistake may cause the entire operation to fail. In today's conditions, it is impossible to detect a cyberespionage attack at the stage of penetration\ninto a local network, and very difficult to identify when it gains a foothold and spreads\nin the infrastructure. Worse still, the target infrastructure itself is often not conducive\nto detecting attacks.\n\nOut-of-the-box protection solutions for individual servers or endpoints are hopelessly\noutclassed. Criminals long ago figured out how to bypass antivirus software, sandboxes, and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Companies need a sober understanding of\nthe protection systems in place to secure their key assets. Solutions must be comprehensive, limiting criminals' space for maneuver and ensuring maximum coverage of security events in the context of system logs, traffic, and network objects. Full awareness\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Positive Technologies\n\n\nof infrastructure events is a critical link in the threat hunting chain for detection of the\nactions of APT groups.\n\nDeep analysis of network traffic, retrospective analysis of security events, user behavior\nprofiling, and access to RAM, processes, and other forensic artifacts allow significantly\nreducing infrastructure dwell time, making it much harder for attackers to achieve their\ngoals.
