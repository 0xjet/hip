Do you use remote access\nfeatures to log into your control system network? Are you unsure of the security measures\nthat protect your remote access services? If your answer was yes to any or all these\nquestions, you are at increased risk of cyber attacks including scanning, probes, brute\nforce attempts and unauthorized access to your control environment.\n\nInternet facing devices have become a serious concern over the past few years with\nremote access demands giving way to insecure or vulnerable configurations. Tools,\nsuch as SHODAN, Google and other search engines, enable researchers and adversaries\nto easily discover and identify a variety of ICS devices that were not intended to be\nInternet facing. Adding to the threat landscape is the continued scanning and cataloguing\nof devices known to be susceptible to emerging vulnerabilities such as the OpenSSL\n[“Heartbleed.” In addition, the search terms needed to identify ICS devices are widely](http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-099-01E)\navailable because of an increasing public body of knowledge with detailed ICS-specific\nterminology. The availability of this information, coupled with the aforementioned\ntools, lowers the level of knowledge required to successfully locate Internet facing\ncontrol systems.\n\nIn many cases, these devices have not been configured with adequate authentication\nmechanisms, thereby further increasing the chances of both opportunistic and targeted\nattempts to directly access these components. As tools and adversary capabilities\nadvance, we expect that exposed systems will be more effectively discovered, and\ntargeted by adversaries. Clearly, it has become more important for asset owners and\noperators to audit their network configurations and properly install their ICS devices\nbehind patched VPNs or firewalls.\n\nMost recently, ICS-CERT received reports of three new cyber incidents that resulted from\nweak network configuration and/or lack of perimeter security. Two of those incidents\ninvolved intrusions by unauthorized parties, and the other was identified as vulnerable\nby a researcher. In the majority of these cases, the system owners are unaware of the\nnonsecure configurations or the associated risk.\n\n**Public Utility Compromised**\n\nA public utility was recently compromised when a sophisticated threat actor gained\nunauthorized access to its control system network. After notification of the incident,\nICS-CERT validated that the software used to administer the control system assets was\naccessible via Internet facing hosts. The systems were configured with a remote access\ncapability, utilizing a simple password mechanism; however, the authentication method\nwas susceptible to compromise via standard brute forcing techniques.\n\nICS-CERT provided analytical assistance, including host-based forensic analysis and\na comprehensive review of available network logs. It was determined that the systems\nwere likely exposed to numerous security threats and previous intrusion activity was\nalso identified. ICS-CERT conducted an onsite cybersecurity assessment in response to\n\n###### 1\n\n\n###### CONTENTS\n\n\n###### INCIDENT RESPONSE ACTIVITY\n\n SITUATIONAL AWARENESS\n\n ICS-CERT NEWS\n\n RECENT PRODUCT RELEASES\n\n OPEN SOURCE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS HIGHLIGHTS\n\n UPCOMING EVENTS\n\n COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE\n\n\n-----\n\n### INCIDENT RESPONSE ACTIVITY - Continued\n\n\nthis incident to assist the asset owners with evaluating the overall\nsecurity posture of their infrastructure. In addition, ICS-CERT\nmade practical recommendations for re-architecting and securing\nthe control network. This incident highlights the need to evaluate\nsecurity controls employed at the perimeter and ensure that\npotential intrusion vectors (ex: remote access) are configured\nwith appropriate security controls, monitoring, and\ndetection capabilities.\n\n**Control Systems Device Remotely Accessed by Threat Actor**\n\nThe second example involved an unprotected, Internet-connected,\ncontrol system operating a mechanical device. Upon investigation,\nICS-CERT determined that a sophisticated threat actor had\naccessed the control system server (connected via a cellular\nmodem) through a supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) protocol. The device was directly Internet accessible and\nwas not protected by a firewall or authentication access controls.\nAt the time of compromise, the control system was mechanically\ndisconnected from the device for scheduled maintenance.\nICS-CERT provided analytic assistance and determined that the\nactor had access to the system over an extended period of time and\nhad connected via both HTTP and the SCADA protocol. However,\nfurther analysis determined that no attempts were made by the\nthreat actor to manipulate the system or inject unauthorized control\nactions. After the incident was resolved, ICS-CERT conducted an\nonsite cybersecurity assessment of its larger control environment\nto evaluate its security posture and make recommendations for\nfurther securing its remote access to its control network. This\nincident highlights the need for perimeter security and monitoring\ncapabilities to prevent adversaries from discovering vulnerable\nICSs and using them as targets of opportunity.\n\n**Sochi Arena HVAC System Exposed to the Internet**\n\nBilly Rios, a researcher at Qualys, provided information to\nICS-CERT and various media outlets concerning an Internet facing\nHVAC and Energy Management System (EMS) associated with an\narena at the Sochi Olympics in Russia. This system was reported to\nlack authentication requirements to access the control system. The\nresearcher worked with the system integrator to reconfigure the\nsystem prior to the Olympics and opening ceremonies.\n\n**What Should You Do?**\n\nICS-CERT strongly encourages taking immediate defensive action\n[to secure ICSs by using defense-in-depth principles. Audit your](http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/Defense_in_Depth_Oct09.pdf)\nnetworks for Internet facing devices, weak authentication methods,\nand component vulnerabilities. Understand the usage of tools, such\nas SHODAN and Google, and leverage those platforms to enhance\nawareness of the Internet accessible devices that might exist within\nyour infrastructure.\n\n\nICS-CERT also recommends that users take defensive measures to\nminimize the risk of exploitation as follows:\n\n - Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. In\ngeneral, locate control system networks and devices behind\nfirewalls and isolate them from the business network.\n\n - When remote access is required, employ secure methods, such\nas Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs\nmay have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most\ncurrent version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as\nsecure as the connected devices.\n\n - Remove, disable or rename any default system accounts\nwherever possible.\n\n - Implement account lockout policies to reduce the risk from\nbrute forcing attempts.\n\n - Establish and implement policies requiring the use of\nstrong passwords.\n\n - Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by\nthird-party vendors.\n\n - Apply patches in the ICS environment, when possible, to\nmitigate known vulnerabilities.\n\nOrganizations that observe any suspected malicious activity\nshould follow their established internal procedures and report their\nfindings to ICS-CERT for incident response support and correlation\nwith other similar incidents. We urge critical infrastructure owners\nand operators to evaluate their systems and ensure that they are not\ndirectly accessible from the Internet.\n\nICS-CERT encourages organizations to reference the previously\n[released alerts, which detail the risks associated with Internet-](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/)\naccessible ICS devices. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to\nperform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking\ndefensive measures.\n\na.

Of those, 177 were determined to be true vulnerabilities that involved coordination, testing, and analysis across\n52 vendors. The majority of these or 87 percent were exploitable remotely while the other 13 percent required local access to exploit\nthe vulnerabilities. A fundamental recommendation for mitigating remotely exploitable vulnerabilities is to minimize network exposure\nand configure ICSs behind firewalls so they aren’t directly accessible and exploitable from the Internet. Equally important is patching\nand updating ICS devices as soon as practically possible, understanding that patches and upgrades must be properly tested by each asset\nowner/operator before being implemented in operational environments. The following chart depicts the different types of vulnerabilities\nreported and coordinated in 2013.\n\n\n##### Denial of Service, 25\n## 14%\n\n\n##### Buffer Overflow, 17\n## 10%\n##### Memory Corruption, 16\n## 9%\n##### Directory Traversal, 12\n## 7%\n\n##### Protocol Vulnerability, 12\n## 7%\n\n##### Privilege Escalation, 8\n## 4%\n\n\n##### Authentication, 58\n## 33%\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n##### Multiple, 6\n\n\n##### Use After Free, 1 SQL Integer Injection, 5 Heap Corruption, 1 Overflow, 3 3% Stack Overflow, 1 2%\n\n\n##### Cross Site Scripting, 7 Multiple, 6 4%\n## 3%\n##### Remote Code Execution, 5\n## 3%\n\n\nAuthentication flaws were the most abundant vulnerability type\ncoordinated in 2013, which includes vulnerabilities like factory\nhard-coded credentials, weak authentication keys, etc. These tend\nto be of highest concern because an attacker with minimal skill\nlevel could potentially gain administrator level access to devices\nthat are accessible remotely over the Internet.\n\nNew for 2013 was the inclusion of medical device vulnerabilities\nas some researchers began to shift their efforts toward these\ndevices. Instrumental in this shift was the relationship that\nICS-CERT formed with the US Department of Health and Human\nServices, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and\nmultiple medical device manufacturers. One noteworthy example\nof these efforts was a report from researchers Billy Rios and Terry\nMcCorkle who discovered a hard-coded password vulnerability\n\n\naffecting roughly 300 medical devices across approximately 40\nvendors. The affected devices are manufactured by a broad range\nof vendors and fall into a broad range of categories, including but\nnot limited to:\n\n - Surgical and anesthesia devices,\n\n - Ventilators,\n\n - Drug infusion pumps,\n\n - External defibrillators,\n\n - Patient monitors and\n\n - Laboratory and analysis equipment.\n\n###### 3\n\n\n-----\n\n### INCIDENT RESPONSE ACTIVITY - Continued\n\n\nICS-CERT continues to coordinate with multiple vendors, the FDA\nand the security researchers to identify specific mitigations across\n[all devices. The FDA has published recommendations and best](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm356423.htm)\n[practices to help prevent unauthorized access or modification to](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm356423.htm)\nmedical devices.\n\nNotable among many of the higher ranking vulnerabilities were\nthe DNP3 vulnerabilities discovered by Adam Crain and Chris\nSistrunk. These serious flaws affect certain implementations\nof the DNP3 protocol in various master-slave station products.\nThese vulnerabilities, if exploited, could cause a denial-of-service\n(DoS) condition against the DNP3 master over either TCP/IP or\nserial communication paths, impeding the DNP3 master from\ncommunicating to field devices until remediated.\n\nIn response, ICS-CERT has been working with the affected vendors\nto create patches or updates to mitigate risk to attacks leveraging\nthese vulnerabilities. To date, ICS-CERT has produced 18\nadvisories for various ICS devices. A comprehensive list of public\nDNP3 implementation vulnerabilities can be found in ICS-CERT\nAdvisory ICSA-13-291-01B - DNP3 Implementation Vulnerability\n[(Update B) (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-13-291-](http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-13-291-01B)\n[01B) and in subsequent updates that will be released in the future.](http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-13-291-01B)\n\n#### SCORING\n\nNearly 65 percent of the vulnerabilities that ICS-CERT coordinated\nin 2013 were scored and ranked as high priority vulnerabilities\nfor asset owners and operators to mitigate in their systems.\n[These vulnerabilities scored 7.0 or higher using the Common](http://www.first.org/cvss)\n[Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).](http://www.first.org/cvss)\n\nWhen calculating CVSS scores, ICS-CERT uses the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) NVD CVSS Version\n[2 concise score calculator found at: http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&adv&version=2)\n[cfm?calculator&adv&version=2. The base score is provided in](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&adv&version=2)\nthe form of a CVSS vector string, which tells readers the variables\nthat went into computing the score. An example of a vector string\nthat equates to a base score of 10.0 is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/\nI:C/A:C). All advisories provide a link back to the NIST CVSS\ncalculator that displays the base metrics (see Figure 2). Readers\ncan combine information from the CVSS score, description of the\nvulnerability and exploit availability and apply this information to\nthe best of their ability to their individual operating environment.\nICS-CERT provides CVSS base scores as a tool for affected asset\nowners to aid them in prioritizing their mitigation strategies.\nControl system owners/operators are encouraged to customize\nthe CVSS temporal and environmental metrics to calculate a total\nscore that applies to their individual deployment characteristics.\nMore information about CVSS scoring can be found at the FIRST\nCVSS web site.\n\nThe following chart shows the percentage of vulnerabilities in\neach of the severity ranges that ICS-CERT worked in 2013. Out\n\n\nof the 177 vulnerabilities, 93 have been documented and released\nin advisories and those 93 are represented below. The remaining\n84 vulnerabilities are currently in open tickets that ICS-CERT is\ncoordinating between researchers and vendors, and CVSS scores\nhave not been determined for each of them yet.\n\n#### CVSS Severity Ranges\n\nLow\n(0.1 - 3.9)\n\nMedium **0%** High\n(4.0 - 6.9) (7.0 - 10.0)\n###### 35% 65%\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe list of researchers in Table 1 coordinated with ICS-CERT\nand contributed to making ICSs more secure in 2013.

It is a simple way to increase the security of our home. In the same way, there\nare basic steps that should be taken to secure control systems. As part of the strategy to assist industry with securing critical control\nsystems, ICS-CERT offers, and has conducted numerous onsite consultations, at no cost to asset owners. These engagements provide\nan opportunity for security experts to examine an organization’s cybersecurity posture and report opportunities for the business to make\nimprovements.\n\nThe assessment approach helps asset owners and operators to select the level of ICS-CERT support needed to meet their operational\nrequirements. The assessment team has during the course of these assessments identified common vulnerabilities and weaknesses\n(see Table 2), from access controls to networking design, that critical infrastructure owners and operators must consider when assessing\ntheir infrastructure for potential threats and risks.\n\nTable 3. Vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified by the assessment team.\n\n##### Category Common Vulnerability\n\nPermissions, Privileges, and Access Controls Poor system access controls\n\nImproper Authentication Poor system identification/authentication controls\n\nCredentials Management Insufficiently protected credentials\n\nWeak passwords\n\nSecurity Configuration and Maintenance Weak testing environments\n\nPoor patch management-limited patch management abilities\n\nWeak backup and restore capabilities\n\nPlanning/Policy/Procedures Poor security documentation and maintenance\n\nLack of formal documentation\n\nInsufficient disaster recovery penetration\n\nNetwork Design Weaknesses Common ICS network design weaknesses\n\nNo security perimeter defined\n\nLack of network segmentation\n\nLack of functional DMZs\n\nFirewalls nonexistent or improperly configured\n\nNetwork devices not properly configured\n\nNetwork Component Configuration\n\nPort security not implemented on\n\n(Implementation) Vulnerabilities\n\nnetwork equipment\n\n###### 6\n\n|Category Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls|Common Vulnerability Poor system access controls|\n|---|---|\n|Improper Authentication|Poor system identification/authentication controls|\n|Credentials Management|Insufficiently protected credentials|\n||Weak passwords|\n|Security Configuration and Maintenance|Weak testing environments|\n||Poor patch management-limited patch management abilities|\n||Weak backup and restore capabilities|\n|Planning/Policy/Procedures|Poor security documentation and maintenance|\n||Lack of formal documentation|\n||Insufficient disaster recovery penetration|\n|Network Design Weaknesses|Common ICS network design weaknesses|\n||No security perimeter defined|\n||Lack of network segmentation|\n||Lack of functional DMZs|\n||Firewalls nonexistent or improperly configured|\n|Network Component Configuration (Implementation) Vulnerabilities|Network devices not properly configured Port security not implemented on network equipment|\n\n\n-----\n\n### SITUATIONAL AWARENESS - Continued\n\n\nA commonly observed challenge and one of the easiest to address is\na flat network topology. A risk associated with a flat network\nis the absence of logical segmentation, which serves to restrict\ncommunications originating from one portion of a network to\nanother portion of the same network, for example that of a standard\ncorporate/business network to the controls systems network. In\na flat or nonsegmented network topology, communications will\nbe uninhibited and able to traverse across all elements within the\nnetwork. Figure 3 illustrates how segmenting and implementing\na demilitarized zone (DMZ) adds security by limiting the\ncommunication paths on the network.\n\nA DMZ is a semi-trusted zone that acts as a buffer between\nnetwork segments. Business networks often place public facing\nsystems like web servers in a DMZ between their trusted business\nnetwork and the Internet. In control systems, a DMZ should exist\nbetween the business network and the control systems network. In\naddition, a DMZ should be established between the control system\nnetwork and any other network segments.\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe critical aspect of a DMZ is to control the flow of\ncommunications between each of the network segments for which\nthe DMZ provides segregation. This is typically done through\nspecially configured firewalls or routers, which enforce controlled\naccess to/from the DMZ, and can deny all other nonauthorized\ntraffic. The best rule set configurations do not allow the zones\nto bypass the DMZ; instead they force traffic to use the systems\nwithin the DMZ to push, pull or present data. The DMZ should\nrestrict communication flows to the most restrictive set of IPs, ports\nand protocols, thereby providing an additional boundary or layer or\n\n\ndefense from potential compromise.\n\nWhen configured correctly, networks segmented by DMZs are\nmuch harder to compromise. An attacker with the aim of accessing\na control system must first gain access through a business\nnetwork’s perimeter firewall, then find a system that is authorized\nto communicate with a host resident within the boundary\nDMZ. Where the DMZ is configured with the most restrictive\ncommunications paths, an attacker may be effectively thwarted at\nthis point as traffic rules enforced may not allow communication\nfrom a host within the boundary DMZ to the business network.\nEven if the business network becomes compromised, the DMZ\nisolating the control systems will provide another layer of defense\nin preventing access to your control system network.\n\nICS-CERT is continuously working closely with the control\nsystems community to increase awareness of defense-in-depth\nstrategies for cybersecurity. In the next Monitor, we will discuss\nother common vulnerabilities and provide further information on\nhow to mitigate them and strengthen your overall security posture.\n\n**REGISTER NOW FOR THE ICSJWG SPRING MEETING**\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG)\nwill be held at the Indiana Government Center South, 302 W.\nWashington St, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, from June 3−5, 2014.\nThe 2014 Spring ICSJWG Meeting will bring together asset\nowners and operators, government professionals, vendors, systems\nintegrators and academic professionals to discuss the latest\ninitiatives impacting security of ICSs and interact with colleagues\nand peers addressing the risk of threats and vulnerabilities to\ntheir systems.\n\n###### 7\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n-----\n\n### ICS-CERT NEWS\n\n\nThe goal of this meeting is to provide a venue where participants\ncan obtain current information, research findings and practical tools\nto enhance the security and resilience of industrial control systems.\nAt the June meeting, participants will prioritize strategies for\nestablishing, maintaining and expanding stakeholder collaboration\nand activities that facilitate communication among agencies and\nsectors, and strengthen the public-private partnerships the\nICS community.\n\nThe meeting will include 3 days of presentations and discussions\nabout ICS security.

These experts have\nknowledge about specific emerging cyber threats ways to counter\nthose threats, and guidance for mitigating cyber vulnerabilities\nfacing critical infrastructure.\n\nOne service DHS offers is the voluntary Enhanced Cybersecurity\nServices (ECS) program. This program helps critical infrastructure\nentities protect themselves against cyber threats to the systems\nupon which so many Americans rely. This program is a good\nexample of information sharing with confidentiality, privacy and\ncivil liberties protections built into its structure.\n\n**Building on the Foundation**\n\nThe Office of Cybersecurity & Communications (CS&C) has\nestablished a community of trust between the public and private\nsectors in order to improve the Nation’s overall computer network\ndefense posture. Through sharing cyber threat information with its\npartners, DHS enables the detection, prevention and mitigation of\nthreats. This builds a holistic understanding of cyber threat activity\n\n\noccurring across the 16 Critical Infrastructure sectors and the\nfederal government.\n\nThe ECS program is a significant component of CS&C’s\ninformation sharing strategy. It builds on existing partnerships by\nestablishing a voluntary information-sharing program that helps\ncritical infrastructure owners and operators improve protection\nof their systems from unauthorized access, exploitation, or data\nexfiltration.\n\nThe ECS program has established processes and security\nrequirements so that DHS can securely share sensitive and\nclassified cyber threat information to appropriately cleared private\nsector cybersecurity Commercial Service Providers (CSP). Access\nto this kind of information will enable CSPs to offer better security\nservices, which will augment the existing services they provide\ntheir customers.\n\nAs with other DHS information-sharing programs, participation in\nECS is voluntary and designed to protect government intelligence,\ncorporate information security and the privacy of participants while\nenhancing the security of critical infrastructure.\n\n**How does this work?**\n\nThe ECS program works with cybersecurity organizations from\nacross the U.S. Government to access a broad range of cyber\nthreat information. DHS analyzes information that is specific\nto identifying known or suspected cyber threats in the form of\n“indicators,” which are human-readable cyber data used to identify\nmalicious cyber activity.\n\nThe indicators range in classification from unclassified to Top\nSecret/SCI. Classification of identified indicators is dictated by its\nsource. CS&C identifies and validates the indicators that are critical\nfor protecting critical infrastructure and then shares the indicators\nwith participating Commercial Service Providers that will only\nuse them to provide approved ECS for their critical infrastructure\ncustomers. These can be used to create “signatures” that are\nmachine readable and able to detect patterns of network traffic that\nnegatively affect critical infrastructure systems. ECS are intended\nto augment, not replace, existing cybersecurity services operated by\nor available to critical infrastructure entities.\n\nCritical infrastructure customers do not receive threat information\ndirectly from the government, but through their pre-approved CSP,\nas shown in Figure 5.\n\n###### 8\n\n\n-----\n\n### ICS-CERT NEWS - Continued\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n**What about Privacy?**\n\nProtecting our citizens’ privacy and civil liberties is a top priority\nfor the administration and the department. In fact, the ECS\nprogram was built with these protections in mind.\n\nECS does not allow government monitoring of private\ncommunications. CSPs may voluntarily share limited statistical\ninformation, such as the timestamp of the cyber event,\nindicator that was involved, and the identification of the critical\ninfrastructure sector of which the affected company is a member.\nUnder the ECS program, ECS-related information is not directly\nshared between customers of the CSPs and the government.\n\nInformation, such as the company name or other identifiable\ninformation, is not shared. CS&C will share the statistical\ninformation it receives under ECS consistent with its existing\npolicies and procedures, including with other U.S. government\nentities with cybersecurity responsibilities.\n\n[Click here to read more about the ECS program Privacy](http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy/privacy_pia_nppd_ecs_jan2013.pdf)\nImpact Assessment.\n\n###### Program Participants\n\n**Commercial Service Providers (CSPs) /**\n**Operational Implementers (OIs)**\n\nIn order to participate in the ECS program and provide ECS,\nCSPs and OIs must meet the eligibility requirements set forth by\nthe ECS program and its partners. CSPs and OIs are responsible\nfor handling, using and maintaining all classified and sensitive\ngovernment furnished information in accordance with the defined\nsecurity requirements set forth by the ECS program. Once vetted,\nCSPs and OIs will enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)\nwith DHS, and then complete the security accreditation process\nin order to participate in the program and receive governmentfurnished threat indicators. CSPs may only deliver ECS to\n\n\nDHS-validated critical infrastructure entities.

ICS-CERT has begun distributing alerts,\nadvisories and bulletins in a STIX-compliant format, which\nincludes both informational and actionable indicators. STIX is a\nDHS-sponsored and community-driven effort to define and develop\na standardized language to represent cyber threat information. The\noverall goal of STIX is to make intelligence, indicators and cyber\ndata machine-readable in a standard format.\n\nAt the core, STIX provides architecture for integrating a diverse set\nof cyber threat information encompassing:\n\n - Cyber observables (network or host-based indicators\nand artifacts),\n\n - Indicators (observables correlated with additional\ncontextual information),\n\n - Incidents (instances of specific adversarial actions),\n\n - TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures – attack patterns,\nmalware, exploits, etc.),\n\n - Exploit targets (vulnerabilities, weaknesses or configurations),\n\n - Courses of action (best practices, defensive actions,\nremediation),\n\n - Cyberattack campaigns (collection of Incidents and/or TTPs\ndemonstrating a shared intent) and\n\n - Cyberthreat actor (characterization of the adversary).\n\n**So What Does This Mean?**\n\nAs ICS-CERT releases STIX-compliant XML artifacts to\naccompany our alerts and advisories, an organization can simply\ndownload the machine-readable XML files and parse or ingest\nthem into a third-party (or custom built) application that supports\nthe XML framework. This structure empowers organizations to\nreadily enhance their detection and protection capabilities by\nautomatically incorporating indicators and actionable information\nwithin the context of their existing security platforms\nand architecture.\n\n**Automation**\n\nAutomated ingestion of STIX-based artifacts allows asset owners\nand operators to reduce/eliminate the overhead of manually\nincorporating observables and indicators into their existing\ndetection toolsets, while increasing the amount of contextual\ninformation available to assist analysts in assessing the impact and\n\n\npriority of these indicators. Streamlining this process should reduce\nthe time from incident detection to containment with the ultimate\ngoal being detection and prevention. DHS has launched the initial\nphase of TAXII (Trusted Automation eXchange of Indicator\nInformation) data delivery services to enable an automated\nexchange of information represented using the STIX language.\n\nFor additional information pertaining to STIX and TAXII,\nplease contact ICS-CERT.\n\n#### WEB-BASED TRAINING IS NOW AVAILABLE\n\nICS-CERT is pleased to announce the launch of the web-based\ntraining Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems (210W).\nThis course is an online version of our 101 and 201 instructor-led\ncourses. The course contains modules covering many aspects of\ncybersecurity for industrial control systems.\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to the basics of industrial\ncontrol systems security. The instruction includes a comparative\nanalysis of IT and control system architecture, security\nvulnerabilities and mitigation strategies unique to the control\nsystem domain.\n\nStudents will receive technical instruction on the protection of\nindustrial control systems using offensive and defensive methods.\nAt the conclusion of the course students will understand how cyber\nattacks could be launched, why they work and mitigation strategies\nto increase the cybersecurity posture of their control system.\n\n[You may view this web-based training at: https://ics-cert-training.](https://ics-cert-training.inl.gov/)\n[inl.gov/.](https://ics-cert-training.inl.gov/)\n\n### DOCUMENT FAQ\n\n###### What is the publication schedule for this digest?\n\nICS-CERT publishes the ICS-CERT Monitor when an\nadequate amount of pertinent information has been collected.\n\nICS-CERT provides this newsletter as a service to personnel\nactively engaged in the protection of critical infrastructure\nassets.
