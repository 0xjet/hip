    "plain_text": "# Shamoon: Destructive Threat Re-Emerges with New Sting in its Tail\n\n**[symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat Hunter TeamSymantec\n\n## Organizations in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been hit in latest attacks that involve new wiper malware.\n\n[After a two-year absence, the destructive malware Shamoon (W32.Disttrack.B) re-emerged](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-112300-5555-99)\non December 10 in a new wave of attacks against targets in the Middle East. These latest\n[Shamoon attacks are doubly destructive, since they involve a new wiper (Trojan.Filerase)](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-121405-4612-99)\nthat deletes files from infected computers before the Shamoon malware wipes the master\nboot record.\n\nNews of the attacks first emerged on December 10 when Italian oil services firm Saipem said\nthat it had been [hit by a cyber attack against its servers in the Middle East. Two days later,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-cyber-saipem/saipem-servers-suffer-cyber-attack-in-middle-east-idUSKBN1O92B1)\n[the company said that Shamoon had been used in the attack, which affected between 300](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-shamoon/saipem-says-shamoon-variant-crippled-hundreds-of-computers-idUSKBN1OB2FA)\nand 400 servers and up to 100 personal computers.\n\nSymantec has found evidence of attacks against two other organizations during the same\nweek, in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both organizations are involved in the\noil and gas industry.\n\n### New wiper deployed\n\nUnlike previous Shamoon attacks, these latest attacks involve a new, second piece of wiping\n[malware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware will delete and overwrite files on the infected](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-121405-4612-99)\ncomputer. Shamoon itself will meanwhile erase the master boot record of the computer,\nrendering it unusable.\n\nThe addition of the Filerase wiper makes these attacks more destructive than use of the\nShamoon malware alone. While a computer infected by Shamoon could be unusable, files\non the hard disk may be forensically recoverable. However, if the files are first wiped by the\nFilerase malware, recovery becomes impossible.\n\nFilerase is spread across the victim’s network from one initial computer using a list of remote\ncomputers. This list is in the form of a text file and is unique to each victim, meaning the\nattackers likely gathered this information during an earlier reconnaissance phase of the\nintrusion. This list is first copied by a component called OCLC.exe and passed on to another\ntool called Spreader.exe. The Spreader component will then copy Filerase to all the\ncomputers listed. It will then simultaneously trigger the Filerase malware on all infected\nmachines\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is possible that the Shamoon malware itself was spread via these same tools, but this is\nunknown. In at least one instance, Shamoon was executed using PsExec, indicating that the\nattackers had access to credentials for the network.\n\n### Possible link to Elfin\n\nOne of the new Shamoon victims Symantec observed the organization in Saudi Arabia had\nrecently also been attacked by another group Symantec calls Elfin (aka APT33) and had\n[been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan.Stonedrill). There were additional attacks](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-030708-4403-99)\nagainst this organization in 2018 that may have been related to Elfin or could have been the\nwork of yet another group.\n\nThe proximity of the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization means it is\npossible that the two incidents are linked.\n\n### A history of destructive attacks\n\n[Shamoon (W32.Disttrack)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081608-0202-99) [first emerged in 2012 when it was used in a series of disruptive](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-attacks)\nattacks against the Saudi energy sector.\n\n[Activity then ceased until it made a surprise comeback in late 2016. A slightly modified](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-back-dead-and-destructive-ever)\n[version of the malware (W32.Disttrack.B) was used in attacks against a range of targets,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-112300-5555-99)\nagain in Saudi Arabia. The attacks appeared timed to cause maximum destruction. The\nmalware was configured to trigger at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17, 2016.\nThe Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped\nafter most staff had left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the\nattack was complete.\n\n### Recurring menace\n\nWhy Shamoon has suddenly been deployed again remains unknown. However, the fact that\nthe malware seems to be taken out of retirement every few years means that organizations\nneed to remain vigilant and ensure that all data is properly backed up and a robust security\nstrategy is in place.\n\n### Protection\n\nSymantec has the following protections in place against the Shamoon attacks:\n\n**File-based protections**\n\n[W32.Disttrack](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081608-0202-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen1](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081708-3504-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen4](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-090306-5105-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen6](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-090306-5953-99)\n\n\n-----\n\n[W32.Disttrack!gen7](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-091717-3231-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen8](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-091313-2116-99)\n[W32.Disttrack.B](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-112300-5555-99)\n[Trojan.Filerase](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-121405-4612-99)\n\n**Network-based protections (Intrusion Prevention System)**\n\n[System Infected: Disttrack Trojan Activity 2](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=25885)\n[System Infected: Disttrack Trojan Activity 3](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=25926)\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\nd9e52663715902e9ec51a7dd2fea5241c9714976e9541c02df66d1a42a3a7d2a Executes the Spreader.exe component\n35ceb84403efa728950d2cc8acb571c61d3a90decaf8b1f2979eaf13811c146b Spreader.exe, which spreads the Trojan.Filerase component across specified\ncomputers\n5203628a89e0a7d9f27757b347118250f5aa6d0685d156e375b6945c8c05eb8a Trojan.Filerase component\n0266be9130bdf20976fc5490f9191edaafdae09ebe45e74cd97792412454bf0d Trojan.Filerase component\nbd2097055380b96c62f39e1160d260122551fa50d1eccdc70390958af56ac003 W32.Disttrack.B\nc3ab58b3154e5f5101ba74fccfd27a9ab445e41262cdf47e8cc3be7416a5904f W32.Disttrack.B\n0975eb436fb4adb9077c8e99ea6d34746807bc83a228b17d321d14dfbbe80b03 W32.Disttrack.B\n0694bdf9f08e4f4a09d13b7b5a68c0148ceb3fcc79442f4db2aa19dd23681afe W32.Disttrack.B\n\n### Threat Intelligence\n\n[Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI)](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nservice have received reports on Shamoon which detail methods of detecting and thwarting\nactivities of this adversary..\n\n## About the Author\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n## Want to comment on this post?\n\n\n-----",
