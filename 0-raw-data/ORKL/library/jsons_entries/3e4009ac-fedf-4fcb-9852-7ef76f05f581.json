Over the years, we have seen social engineering emails attempt\nto take advantage of world events such as the Olympics, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural\ndisasters and more. So, it is not surprising that Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers are\ncoming across phishing emails that use the Russian-Ukrainian war as a lure.\n\nOver the first several weeks of the conflict, we uncovered several attack schemes. Some\nemails intend to spread malware, while others gather personally identifiable information\n(PII). In all cases, the phishing attempts try to take advantage of the empathy the world has\nfor the human suffering that is taking place in Ukraine.\n\n### Phishing in a Time of War\n\nThe invasion has caused a humanitarian disaster and displaced millions of Ukrainian\ncitizens from their homes. In response, people from around the world responded by\norganizing aid and donations. Scammers, unfortunately, have taken note of this activity and,\nin an attempt to take advantage of these good-hearted people, are sending fraudulent\nemails asking for donations via cryptocurrency.\n\nScammers are playing with people’s emotions and are using fake heart-wrenching cries for\nhelp in this example below:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis message appears to be sent by a Ukrainian who has fled to Poland. The sender details\nthe agonizing experience their family has suffered and falsely claims that Poland is charging\nrefugees an entry fee to enter the country. The email also states that Bitcoin is their only\nmeans of acquiring financial assistance. One indicator that this email is fraudulent is that\nthe sender address is from a free email service in Ukraine, but the reply-to field contains an\nentirely different email address. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the sender's IP\ncame from the United States.\n\nAnother scam attempts to take advantage of the refugees fleeing the war zone. In this case,\na social engineering scheme was designed to take advantage of the very real evacuations\nnow taking place throughout Ukraine by passing along fake evacuation information in an\n\n\n-----\n\nattempt to obtain personal information.\n\n**Evacuation plan from: SBU**\n\n**(Urgent) -28.02.2022**\n\n**original: 399029**\n\n**Security Service of Ukraine**\n\n**Good afternoon, you need to get acquainted with the electronic evacuation plan from**\n**March 1, 2022, provide data on the number of staff, fill out the document on the form**\n**198 \\ 00-22 SBU-98.**\n\n**To ensure the confidentiality of transmitted data, the password is set to the**\n**attachment: 2267903645**\n\nOne of the most common tactics threat actors use while conducting phishing campaigns is\nbrand impersonation. Here an email is used to impersonate a trusted entity. By disguising\nthe message as coming from a recognizable organization, attackers are more likely to trick\nthe users into divulging information or transferring money to a fraudulent account.\n\nIn the examples below, the message appears to be sent by the Ukrainian government.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sender appears to have a legitimate government email address, but a further\nexamination of the email header shows that the email originated from Lithuania. Another\nred flag is the fact that the domain “Ukraine.gov” is not officially listed under the ownership\nof the Ukrainian government.\n\n### Investment Scam\n\nAside from the crypto scam, attackers are sending fraudulent messages regarding\ninvestment schemes. These spam messages are basically a spin-off of the classic “Nigerian\nPrince” scam and offer the victim the false promise of investment or inheritance to trick\nthem into disclosing their bank information or remitting money directly to the scammers.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the surface, this message appears to be sent by a Ukrainian who fled the country for\nsafety. The person is asking for help to transfer a considerable amount of money to the\nrecipient's country for investment purposes.\n\nThe email contains several tells that it is fake, besides the story itself.\n\nThe email address in the \"from\" field belongs to a company that is not based in Ukraine.\nThe email also contains a separate email address, which is entirely different from the\nsender's address and instead belongs to a free mail service. This particular red flag is a\ncommon scammer tactic. The scammer spoofs the sender's address because people are\nmore likely to engage with the content of the email if the sender appears to be legitimate.\nThe attacker also created a false sense of urgency as the sender claims to be in danger.\n\n### Malware Attachments in Spam Emails\n\nAlong with scam emails, malware-related spam is also being sent out to users. A common\npretext being used in these messages is the cancellation or postponement of business\ntransactions due to the shutdown of many Ukrainian establishments.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email shown above uses an order shipment suspension to bait the user into opening\nthe attachment. The attached Excel file supposedly contains the details of the transaction\nthat they want to suspend.\n\nThe malicious Excel file exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office Equation editor called\nCVE-2017-11882. It downloads an executable from http://136[.]144[.]41[.]109/HRE[.]exe.\n[Finally, this executable file downloads the final payload, which is Remcos. Remcos is a](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/rats-wrapped-and-hidden-in-png/)\nremote access Trojan (RAT) that can give an attacker full control over its target’s system.\n\n### IOC\n\n\n-----\n\nSUCT220002.xlsx\n\n4907309437e12932d437f8c3ae03fbfde7d4e196b6f1dc7f2d98e3a388ce585c\n\nhttp://136[.]144[.]41[.]109/HRE[.]exe\n\nfaef8505886bc30e045f0eb3f1422528cdab1fedc8e02c601605b41bd205d348\n\n0a9babd846b1edf99e75f3c9de492c6341f9ca9a8e91851ad323bf8f325f9799\n\n### Log-In Attempt Phishing Emails\n\nAmidst the news of cyberattacks conducted by groups backing Russia, threat actors are\npushing out phishing emails disguised as a sign-in attempt notification.\n\nIn this sample, the sender, who claims to be from the victim’s email security team, says\nthere was a sign-in attempt originating from Russia. The victim is required to verify their\naccount and activate two-step verification. First, the attackers mimic the victim’s company\n\n\n-----\n\ndomain and forges the sender s address making it appears like a legitimate notification\nemail.\n\nThe embedded URL belongs to a web hosting platform and leads to a fake login site, also\nknown as a [Chameleon phishing page, that can mimic the logo of the company domain of](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/the-attack-of-the-chameleon-phishing-page/)\nthe victim’s email address. It even has a countdown timer to heighten the sense of urgency\nof the victim and make them divulge their credentials.\n\n### The Very Real Threat of Phishing Attacks\n\nOnce an employee clicks on a link in a phishing email, malicious activities can occur that\ncould affect an organization – malware, ransomware, credential theft and more.\n\nFor example, Trustwave has spotted attackers distributing malware, including AgentTesla,\nthrough phishing campaigns focused on Ukraine. AgentTesla has several features. A threat\nactor can use it as a keylogger, a downloader, a password-stealer, and a screen-capturing\nmalware. These abilities give it the power to record various data, including login credentials,\nor download and execute malware.\n\n[Trustwave MailMarshal Secure Email Gateway can block these types of phishing and scam](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/library/documents/trustwave-mailmarshal-secure-email-gateway/)\nemails.\n\n### The Trustwave SpiderLabs Email Security Team Continues to Stay Vigilant\n\nCertainly, these Ukrainian-related malicious mails won’t be the last that we’ll see.\nCybercriminals will always piggyback on the current global crisis to make their profits. As\nalways, we strongly advise users to never open emails, access links or click on attachments\nfrom unknown or unsolicited sources.\n\n\n-----",
