The\nPowerPoint package contained two embedded OLE objects, each with a remote path where\nthe resource is located. The two files were named slide1.gif and slides.inf.\n\nIt is a feature of Microsoft PowerPoint to load these files, but it turned out to be a dangerous\none, since the objects could be downloaded from an arbitrary untrustworthy network\n[location and executed with none of the warning pop-ups, addressed in the MS12-005 patch.](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2584146)\n\nSo what were the two downloaded files? The .gif file was not an image but, in fact, a\ncamouflaged BlackEnergy Lite dropper. [.INF files are executable and typically used to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INF_file)\ninstall device drivers.\n\nIn this particular instance, the .INF file’s job was to rename the BlackEnergy dropper from\nslide1.gif to slide1.gif.exe and execute it using a simple Windows Registry entry:\n\nFunctionally similar exploits have been known since at least 2012 but have not been widely\nabused. After seeing this one actively used by malware in-the-wild, ESET has reported it to\nMicrosoft on September 2nd, 2014.\n\nNow that the vulnerability has been recognized as CVE-2014-4114 and Microsoft created\n\n\n-----\n\na patch for it, we strongly encourage all users to close this infection vector by updating as\nsoon as possible.\n\n14 Oct 2014 - 03:29PM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
