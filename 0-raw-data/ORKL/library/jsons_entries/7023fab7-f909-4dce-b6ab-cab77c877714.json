New Conflict, New Information\n\nAmidst the turmoil of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, incident responders and ransomware\nresearchers observed several ransomware gangs publish statements on their dark web blog\nsites. Some actors asserted the apolitical nature of their operations, while others clearly\nfavored a side.\n\nMost notably, the Conti ransomware group posted a public statement in support of Russia\nwith a stern warning of retaliation on February 25, 2022. Shortly after this, cyber defenders\nquickly learned that Conti’s pro-Russian support was not representative of the group’s\n\n\n-----\n\nconstituents. In an ironic turn of events, after Conti exposed private data from extorted\ncompanies over the past year and a half, Conti’s own sensitive data has now been exposed.\n\nGoing by the handle “@ContiLeaks” on Twitter, individual(s) with access to internal Conti\ndata began publishing large archives of information, including Conti’s internal chats from\nJabber, details on infrastructure, internal documents, and even source code stating\nemphatically, “Glory to Ukraine.” While third-party leaks cannot be fully verified, many of their\ncontents correspond to Conti’s dark web posts and our direct experience with this threat\nactor. Our analysis can shed light on the nature of communications between the alleged\nindividuals operating within the Conti threat actor group.\n\n### Conti Victim Demographics\n\nFor background, Conti is one of the most prolific ransomware groups that we have tracked\nover the past 21 months, often ranking in the top 5 of ‘most posted victims’ on their dark web\nsite, where victims who don’t pay up, are exposed and shamed. From monitoring their dark\nweb posting activity to responding to ransomware attacks initiated against businesses in\nreal-time, we can use our own data to contextualize this latest leak.\n\n**Conti Dark Web Victims by Geographic Location**\n\nOverwhelmingly, Conti’s claimed ransomware victims are headquartered in the United\nStates.\n\n### Conti Dark Web Claimed Victims by Industry\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile victim organizations are varied, Conti’s dark web blog exposed manufacturing,\nconstruction, and technology firms most often. This is not to say that firms among these\nindustries are the most frequently targeted by the Conti group — exposure is a consequence\nof failed negotiations, while companies who quickly pay the ransom typically aren’t exposed.\nSpecific targeting of organizations is not the most lucrative tactic for most threat actors; their\nmost effective strategy finds victims through automatic scanning of any vulnerabilities on the\npublic internet that they know how to exploit, that ultimately lead to an internal network.\n\n### Conti Jabber Messages by Month\n\n_A potential pattern emerges between Conti’s dark web posting activity and internal chat logs_\n\n### Methodology\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter helping victims recover from Conti ransomware incidents and tracking the group s\nactivity for 21 months, we have become familiar with the group’s tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs). Backed by our previous observations of the group, we can now learn\nmore about the internal sociological makeup of the Conti gang through an analysis of the\nrevealed chat logs, allowing us to gain an even deeper understanding of how this adversary\nmodel operates.\n\nBy providing insight into the operations of Conti, we can form a clearer picture of the threat\nactors behind the ransomware. By identifying who the various members are talking to, the\nfrequency and cadence with which they communicate, and the organizational structure of the\norganization, we further our understanding of how to defend against one of the most prolific\nransomware groups in the market. In order to dig into these areas, our methodology\nincludes relevant chats for context and validation.\n\nAs an example of our methodology, take the following message from the leaked chat logs.\nOn September 24, 2020, an individual going by the cryptonym Mushroom sent a message to\nanother individual named Buza (cryptonyms have been italicized):\n\n“hello. At this point I made the bootloader for Target like he said, tested them, and I\ngave them to Bentley. Frog told him to give Bentley the stable version of his Bentley kit\nas well...”\n\nThere is considerable information in this single partial message. Focusing on the individuals\nand their interactions, we can think of these as a network, conceptualizing the individuals as\nvertices and impute edges given their reported interactions. Further, we can determine the\nsource and target of these interactions.[1]\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the message, Mushroom provides a report to Buza, creating a directed edge between the\ntwo. Within the chat, we learn that Mushroom was tasked by Target to provide a deliverable\nto Bentley. Target also receives a request from Frog to provide a deliverable to Bentley.\nBased even on this single message, we observe a structure begin to emerge.\n\nThe interactions contained in this single chat transcript can be derived from the body of the\nmessage, and these same structures are likewise captured in the individuals’ own messages\nto and from each other. To visualize these sender and receiver relationships, we analyzed\nthe leaked chat data and visualized a network that yielded 442 unique chat handles,\nrepresented here as nodes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Colored nodes indicate each detected subgroup within the Conti organization_\n\nWithin the 442 nodes of the chat network, there were roughly 8 clusters or “communities”\nbased on a community-detection algorithm. This is designed to cluster more dense\nconnections within a subgroup and draw a boundary. This graph reflects the entire leak, with\nmany weakly-connected nodes, so we filtered the Conti network further down to its primary\nmembers which yielded a smaller graph of roughly 44 nodes.\n\n\n-----\n\nStill denoted by the colors of their network “communities,” and labeled with their chat\nhandles, these individuals represent the core of the Conti network graph. From here, we can\nbegin to tease out the structure further by asking, “Who is important in this graph?”\n\nTo determine importance, we used a quantitative measure called “degree” which is simply\nthe number of connections to other nodes. In-degree refers to the number of inbound\nconnections (received) and out-degree refers to the outbound connections (sent). As a\nmeasure of importance, in-degree is larger for the individuals Stern, followed by Defender,\n_Bentley, Mango, and Buza._\n\n**Name** **In-Degree** **Authority** **Hub** **PageRank** **Betweenness Centrality**\n\nStern 157 0.235122 0.308495 0.077951 0.158787\n\nDefender 152 0.224893 0.337484 0.054485 0.286215\n\nBentley 118 0.214211 0.229546 0.065222 0.048557\n\nMango 110 0.178626 0.225409 0.0266974 0.060916\n\n\nBuza 100 0.18 0.227305 0.0162215 0.053068\n\n\n-----\n\nIn-degree measures the number of individuals that communicate with the named key\nplayers. Another measure of importance is called “authority.\" This algorithm measures not6\njust connectedness by frequency, but the weight of importance from those connections. This\ncan indicate a node’s authoritativeness in a network if other focal nodes point to another as a\nfinal word, destination, or “authority.”\n\nA hub score is assigned to nodes which more reliably point to others high in authority. Like\nthe guiding aim of authority, PageRank is a procedure designed to rank the importance of a\nnode based on the importance of the nodes which point to it.7\n\nThe final algorithm used in our analysis determines “betweenness centrality,” measuring\nwhich node falls along the shortest path between any given two nodes. Being high in\nbetweenness centrality is often a strategic position — someone who is likely a broker or\ngatekeeper. On this measure of betweenness, Defender is the most central, connecting\ndisparate ends of the network to greater extent than any other node in the network.\n\n### Findings\n\nBased on the analysis of the recently leaked Conti chats, it is clear that Conti’s internal\nstructure is anything but flat and egalitarian. On all measures of centrality aside from\nPageRank, the same five individuals remained the most important nodes. Certain individuals\nhold central roles within Conti’s ransomware business structure and the various metrics of\nnetwork centrality allow us to triangulate key players and positions:\n\n**Name** **Position** **Function**\n\n_Stern_ _Leader_ _Oversees the whole operation._\n\n\n_Defender_ _Technical_\n_Administrator_\n\n_Bentley_ _Developer/R&D_\n_Lead_\n\n_Mango_ _General Team_\n_Manager_\n\n\n_Manages internal infrastructure._\n\n_Oversees “cryptors” and tool obfuscation (testing against_\n_Anti-Virus solutions)._\n\n_Oversees personnel and manages projects, assists with_\n_payroll._\n\n\n_Buza_ _Coder Lead_ _Oversees teams of coders_\n\n_Stern appears to be the superior within the identified core group. It might seem puzzling, for_\ninstance, that Stern ranked highest in in-degree, authority, and PageRank, yet Defender\nholds advantage in betweenness centrality This is instructive as various metrics of\n\n\n-----\n\nimportance in the network capture qualitatively different things. In examining Defender s\nnetwork, it appears Defender’s position resembles something of a technical coordinator for\nthe network of Conti operatives, maintaining some of the Conti infrastructure, technical\noperations, and reminding new members to submit backup contacts.\n\n_Defender appears to report to Stern, who based on the quantitative findings, had the highest_\nin-degree, PageRank, and authority scores. These measures can also be corroborated with\nqualitative analysis of messages between Defender and Stern. Defender provides reports\nupon request and was even seen calling in sick to Stern.\n\n_Mango, also a central node, appears to have some authority over some personnel aspects of_\nthe organization, having some involvement with hiring and payroll. Writing to Stern about the\nshortcomings of a lower manager after a promotion, Mango states,\n\n“love slow down with the promotion, he's relaxed, he says he's doing a lot, but in fact\n_there are more words than deeds and then see for yourself... I told him off, let him_\n_sweat for another month, motivated him.”_\n\n_Stern, for his part instructs Mango to keep the other team members “in check.”_\n\n_Mango’s involvement in payroll is seen in reminding Stern repeatedly, “don’t forget about the_\n_paycheck bro, everyone’s looking forward to it.” Later, reminding his superior:_\n\n_“Pay the gang here bc1qkmyv5860pe24h9ytadkzgqltkjuuk9z9s027df_\n_sum total 85k_\n_99947 core team 62 people, I get 54 paychecks_\n_33847 - reverse team, 23 people_\n_8500 - new team of coders, 6 people, only 4 are getting salaries so far_\n_12500 Reverses, 6 people_\n_10000 OSINT department 4 people_\n_3000 for expenses (servers/protections/ test tasks for new people)_\n_164.8k total per month.”_\n\nIn addition to operating under a hierarchical structure, there is a division of labor within the\nConti network. The chat logs are replete with mentions of teams with different designations:\nteams of coders, core team, reverse team, and OSINT department. From the chat data, we\nknow that numerous individuals are mentioned occupying certain roles, such as a message\nfrom Stern to Mango in which Stern mentions “HR managers Salaman, Kagas, and Viper” or\nmany others naming individuals as “team leads.”\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis of the Conti chat network, we have explored the patterns of\ninteractions between nodes to reveal a hierarchy. Based on the data, there are several\nmembers that are the most connected. While there is still much to be discovered about Conti\n\n\n-----\n\nleadership, knowing the overall inner workings of communications, projects, and deliverables\nwithin ransomware structures offers new opportunities to disrupt their operations and avoid\nthem altogether.\n\nThis leak provides insight into the structure of ransomware groups and the non-technical\nelements driving the ransomware business. Analysis indicates that individuals within the\nConti threat actor group are still responsible for technical and financial responsibilities.\nRather than a one-off, lone wolf operation, our analysis reveals a possible core group of 44\nindividuals who run the Conti operation.\n\nConti is armed with a human team, hierarchy, and structure of responsibilities as outlined in\ntheir chats and as investigated first-hand by Tetra Defense, an Arctic Wolf company. Being a\nhuman-driven enterprise, ransomware provides periods of time between victim discovery,\ninitial access, reconnaissance, and attack deployment when an attack can be disrupted.\nWhile the future of the Conti group remains uncertain, this leak provides a case study on the\ninner workings of a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) structure — a common structure used\nby other threat actors we investigate daily.\n\nWith the Conti group still operational, the threat remains, as evidenced by the sprawling\nnetwork of members and affiliates. This deep analysis provides us a unique understanding in\nadversary operations, and informs how we build and enhance our detections to anticipate\nfuture TTPs and tradecraft. Arctic Wolf works side by side with customers, 24x7, to hunt for\nactivity and deploy new detections—always advancing security operations with threat\nintelligence and analysis to fuel into the Arctic Wolf Platform.®\n\n_This analysis was performed by Tetra Defense, an Arctic Wolf company, in collaboration with_\n_Arctic Wolf Threat Intelligence._\n\n\n1Edges in directed networks are often called arcs, however, for simplicity sake we will refer to\n\nthem as edges in this analysis.\n\n2Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Etienne Lefebvre, Fast\n\nunfolding of communities in large networks, in Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and\nExperiment 2008 (10), P1000\n\nR. Lambiotte, J.-C. Delvenne, M. Barahona Laplacian Dynamics and Multiscale Modular\nStructure in Networks 2009\n\n\n3This is the network’s K-Core.\n\n4We are using the unweighted degree to establish sending and receiving relationships and\n\nthus filter nodes for which a larger number of messages are exchanged in aggregate. While\nthe latter can be a useful measure, technical collaboration may require a higher volume of\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunication. For transparency, Bentley had the highest weighted in-degree, followed next\nby Stern. Yet, Bentley had the fewer total individuals from which these messages originated.\n\n5Mango and Buza were not among the top 5 on PageRank.\n\n\n6This is based on Jon M.
