However, while Emotet dominated\nmalicious message volumes in many regions worldwide, URLZone, which primarily appears\nin Japan, remains the top email threat by volume in the region.\n\nURLZone is currently loading the Ursnif banking Trojan configured with web injects for\nJapanese banks, making Ursnif a top payload in Japan as well. In the past, we have\nobserved the long-running URLZone banker [1] loading Vawtrak and other banking Trojans\nand continue to monitor the distribution of both URLZone and Emotet as the latter further\ncements its dominance in the global landscape. It is worth noting that, while Emotet appears\nto be in something of a hiatus since the end of May, URLZone/Ursnif campaigns have\ncontinued, paralleling Ursnif activity in other geographies.\n\n**Campaigns**\n\nSince the beginning of 2019, numerous threat actors tracked by Proofpoint researchers\nconducted dozens of high-volume campaigns involving hundreds of thousands of messages\nthat specifically geo-targeted Japan. These campaigns affected thousands of Japanese\norganizations, delivering banking Trojans, phishing attacks, impostor attacks, and spam at\nscale.\n\nIn particular, these campaigns included emails delivering the URLZone banking Trojan and\nengaging in LINE credential phishing. Many of these threats target Japan specifically;\nhowever, the region is also frequently included in global or multinational campaigns. These\ncampaigns are typically sent by financially motivated cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a brief overview of the malware payloads we frequently observe in campaigns\naffecting Japanese organizations.\n\n_URLZone and Ursnif_\n\nURLZone, also known as Bebloh or Shiotob, is a banking Trojan that first appeared in 2009.\nThis is a well-established banker that we continue to observe regularly in Japanese geotargeted campaigns a decade after its introduction. However, at this point, it appears that a\nsingle, high-volume actor remains the only distributor of URLZone.\n\nProofpoint researchers have observed email messages containing malicious Microsoft Excel\ndocuments with macros that, when enabled, install URLZone (Figure 1). In these campaigns,\nURLZone appears to be used as an initial payload, which then installs Ursnif.\n\n_Figure 1: Example Microsoft Excel spreadsheet emailed to a Japanese recipient containing_\n_macros that, once enabled, install URLZone_\n\nMany of these campaigns reference invoices or payments. One recent campaign appeared\nto come from multiple random sending addresses with subjects such as :\n\n\"FW: 請求書を送信致します。\" (\"We will send you an invoice\")\n\n\n-----\n\nRe: 請求書の送付 ( Send invoice )\n\"Re: 請求書送付のお願い\" (\"Request for billing\")\n\"契約書雛形のご送付\" (\"Sending the contract form\")\n\"ご案内[お支払い期限:06月18日]\" (\"Information [Payment Deadline: Jun. 18]\")\n\"請求書の件です。\" (\"Invoice\")\n\"請求書送付\" (\"Invoicing\")\n\nFigure 2 shows an example email from this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Sample email delivering URLZone/Ursnif on June 17, 2019_\n\nMost of these campaigns appear to originate with a single actor who operates primarily in\nJapan and Italy. The actor frequently employs steganography [2] - embedding malicious\ncode in the “least significant bits” of color data in image files - as part of their geo-targeting.\nThe macros also use multiple layers of obfuscation and various locale and language checks\nto ensure the victim machine is in Japan before downloading and decoding the initial\npayload. Examples of recent language and locale checks include:\n\nExcel: \"Application.International(xlCountrySetting)\" begins with \"8\" (international\nDialling Code for Japan is 81)\nPowerShell error for non-existent command contains \"用語 \" (\"The term\" in Japanese)\nPowerShell cmdlet: 'Get-date' (needs to contain \"年\" - \"Year\" in Japanese)\nPowerShell cmdlet: 'Get-Culture.\"LCID\"' needs to contain \"04\" (Japanese LCID is\n\"1041\")\n\nOnce URLZone determines the host environment is suitable, URLZone downloads Ursnif,\nwhich begins stealing information and operating as a more “typical” banker. [3]\n\nProofpoint researchers have tracked Ursnif in Japan-focused campaigns since at least\nMarch 2017. While the actor we refer to as TA544 is responsible for much of the recent\nUrsnif volume in Japan via initial URLZone infections, we have observed other actors\ndistributing Ursnif variants directly. At this point, Ursnif is the most common commodity\nbanker, both worldwide and in Japan.\n\n_Emotet_\n\nEmotet is a robust global botnet that loads third-party malware and its own modules used for\nspamming, credential stealing, network spreading, and email harvesting.\n\nOn April 12, 15, and 16, an actor tracked by Proofpoint threat researchers as TA542 [4]\nlaunched high-volume campaigns impacting Japan (among other countries) and targeting a\nwide range of industries. A large percentage of the messages in these campaigns were sent\nto organizations in Japan, which was noteworthy because Japan was not one of the core\ngeographies consistently targeted by Emotet. However, the actors behind Emotet are adept\nat localization and have been expanding their activities into new regions regularly. Since the\nend of May, Emotet campaigns have largely paused; we will continue to monitor for new\nactivity in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nFigure 3 shows a typical message with an attached malicious Microsoft Word document.\nThese documents contained macros that, when enabled, installed an instance of Emotet.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Example email sent to a Japanese recipient with an attached document with_\n_macros that, once enabled, install Emotet_\n\n_TA505 and FlawedAmmyy_\n\nIn February of 2019, Proofpoint researchers observed new Japan-focused campaigns from\nTA505 [5], a threat actor that recently has been focused on China, South Korea, Latin\nAmerica, and the Middle East, distributing the FlawedAmmyy Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n[6].\n\nFlawedAmmyy is based on the leaked source code for Version 3 of the Ammyy Admin\nremote desktop software, a shareware utility used for IT support purposes. As such,\nFlawedAmmyy contains the functionality of the leaked version, including:\n\nRemote Desktop control\nFile system manager\nProxy support\nAudio Chat\n\nFlawedAmmyy is distributed via emails with document attachments. These attachments are\neither Microsoft Excel (.xls) or Word (.doc) attachments with macros that, if enabled,\ndownload FlawedAmmyy (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: FlawedAmmy RAT being distributed using Microsoft Office Attachments._\n\nWhile the volume of these campaigns was only in the thousands of messages, TA505 has\nbeen particularly focused on Asia and the Middle East recently; it is noteworthy when this\nprolific actor begins targeting a new region.\n\n**Human Centric Threats**\n\nWhile a variety of emails distributing malware demonstrate examples of targeting and\npayloads unique to Japan, internationally ubiquitous phishing attacks, business email\ncompromise (BEC), and other forms of imposter attacks remain ongoing threats. In\nparticular, we regularly observe:\n\n_Credential Phishing_\n\nThis is the most common type of phishing observed by Proofpoint researchers. These emails\ntarget a victim’s login credentials such as usernames and passwords for a range of sites and\nservices. These campaigns are usually high-volume emails with linked or embedded spoofs\nof login pages for reputable entities including banks, universities, electronic signature\n\n\n-----\n\nservices, and social media and file sharing platforms. Figure 5 shows an example of a\nphishing landing page targeting banking customers in Japan, attempting to steal a variety of\npersonal data.\n\n_Figure 5: Credential Phishing for a Japan Post Bank customer (Source:_\n_[https://www.antiphishing.jp/news/alert/jpbank_japanpost_20190304.html)](https://www.antiphishing.jp/news/alert/jpbank_japanpost_20190304.html)_\n\nOne notable type of credential phishing we have observed targets users of the LINE service.\nLINE is one of the most popular messaging apps in Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan, with\napproximately 165 million users across those countries. LINE is similar to Whatsapp,\nFacebook Messenger, or WeChat in China and has roughly 78 million monthly active users in\nJapan.\n\nProofpoint researchers have been observing emails messages with LINE credential phishing\nlinks targeting organizations in Japan (Figure 6). For example, these messages used\nsubjects such as \"[LINE]安全認証\" which translates to \"[LINE] Safety certification\".\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 6. An example phishing lure on the LINE app in Japan. (Source: Cyamax.com)](https://www.cyamax.com/entry/2017/04/24/060000)_\n\nWhile this particular type of human factor compromise is fairly simple in its implementation a standard phishing-type of attack which uses the stolen branding of a recognizable\nlegitimate commercial entity - the pervasiveness of LINE in Japan makes this type of\nphishing notable. Moreover, because many users repeat credentials among services,\nstealing credentials from LINE can net threat actors credentials for many other apps and\nplatforms.\n\n_Impostor Threats_\n\nImpostor threats include malicious emails with the intent of attempting to impersonate a\nperson, commercial entity, or respected brand, such as a bank or an internet service\nprovider. This type of imposter activity could be used for financial fraud, including business\nemail compromise (BEC), in conjunction with other social engineering mechanisms to\nachieve their desired result, whether delivery of malware, credential phishing, or further\nnetwork compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\nI\n\n_Figure 7: An example of a threat actor engaging in business email compromise (BEC) with a_\n_Japanese target. BEC is a type of known imposter activity relying on social engineering_\n_without any links or attachments leading to malware or phishing kits. (Source:_\n_[https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/announce/201808-bec.html)](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/announce/201808-bec.html)_\n\nWhile BEC remains fairly rare in Japan when compared with other nations, due to the\nuniqueness and difficulty of interacting in the Japanese language for non-native speakers\nand thus presenting difficulty for constructing effective lures, this type of human factororiented attack is increasing in popularity worldwide.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn 2019, threats specific to Japanese organizations and business interests, whether abusing\nJapanese brands or geo-targeted malware and credential phishing campaigns, mean that\ndefenders at companies within Japan must be cognizant of highly targeted attacks as well as\nbroad-based international attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nUrsnif and the Emotet botnet are the most prevalent malware threats affecting Japan,\ncreating palpable risks for organizations and individuals by utilizing compelling lures and\nsophisticated social engineering mechanisms.\n\nWhile Japan-targeted threats are not new, URLZone in particular, with its unique application\nby a single prolific actor in the region, sets Japan apart from other geographies. The\nJapanese language also creates unique challenges for non-native speakers in crafting\neffective social engineering approaches, but high volumes of Ursnif and Emotet suggest that\nfinancially motivated actors may have “cracked the code,” creating emerging risks for\ndefenders, organizations, and consumers in the region. As always, a combination of layered\ndefenses and end user education is critical to protecting data, intellectual property, and\ncritical infrastructure in the face of increasing attacks targeting the region.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Vawtrak-UrlZone-Banking-TrojansTarget-Japan\n\n[2] https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cutwail-spam-campaign-uses-steganography-todistribute-urlzone/\n\n[3] https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-ursnif-variant-targets-japan-packed-with-newfeatures\n\n[4] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta542-bankermalware-distribution-service\n\n[5] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridexglobeimposter\n\n[6] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leaked-source-code-ammyy-adminturned-flawedammyy-rat\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
