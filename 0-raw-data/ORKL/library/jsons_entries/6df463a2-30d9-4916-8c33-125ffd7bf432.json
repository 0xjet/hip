A Rundown of the Emotet Malware\n\n**[infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/a-rundown-of-the-emotet-malware/](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/a-rundown-of-the-emotet-malware/)**\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\n**Vinugayathri** **Chinnasamy Content Writer**\n\nEmotet is a type of malware and a cybercrime operation that is believed to have originated in\nUkraine. The Emotet malware was first detected in 2014. After that, it was considered\nextremely dangerous and one of the most harmful threats of the decade because of how it\nevolved. What started as a malware strain grew into an entire cybercrime organization,\nselling system access acquired through the malware to other cybercrime gangs like the Ryuk\n[gang and ransomware operations.](https://www.indusface.com/blog/ransomware-prevention-why-web-security-is-important/?utm_source=Infosecurity-Magazine-article&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Infosecurity-Magazine-article-emotet-is-back)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage source:\n\nProofpoint\nThrough a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the US, the\nUK, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine, with international activity coordinated by\n[Europol and Eurojust, cyber law enforcement units disrupted Emotet operations, took control](http://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nof its botnet infrastructure and made arrests in Ukraine in January 2021.\n\nIn November 2021, however, new potential cases of Emotet cropped up. Luca Ebach, a\n[security researcher at G Data, posted a blog on November 15 2021, in which he stated, “We](https://cyber.wtf/2021/11/15/guess-whos-back/)\nobserved on several of our Trickbot trackers that the bot tried to download a DLL to the\nsystem. According to internal processing, these DLLs have been identified as Emotet.”\n\n[On December 08 2021, Intel 471 stated, “Last month, Intel 471 observed the emergence of](https://intel471.com/blog/emotet-returns-december-2021)\nEmotet, a notorious strain of malware that had been dormant for most of 2021 after law\nenforcement agencies forced it offline.”\n\nCybersecurity experts and researchers from multiple cybersecurity companies have warned\nthat Emotet has indeed returned. In addition, they are experiencing an increase in Trickbot\ninfections, a trojan malware that infects Microsoft Windows and other operating systems and\nextensively spreads using Emotet infected systems. New Emotet samples were also\ndiscovered in November 2021, which had a similar code to the malware taken down in\nJanuary.\n\n## How Did Emotet Operate?\n\nIn early 2014, when Emotet was first detected, it was a trojan malware targeted at banks and\nfinancial institutions with the purpose of hijacking hosts and stealing banking credentials.\n\nOver time, the malware strain evolved and was reconfigured to work as a ‘loader,’ a malware\nstrain that hijacks a system and gives the hijackers access to download additional payloads\nonto the host. These payloads can be any executable code, like ransomware code. The first\nstrains of the virus were spread through email attachments.\n\nEmails disguised as invoices, shipping details, COVID-19 information, etc., with infected\nWord files were sent to victims, and these emails appeared to come from known senders.\nThe Emotet group used this guise to lure unsuspecting victims into downloading and opening\n\n\n-----\n\nthese Word files.\n\nOnce opened, the Word file would prompt users to enable macros. Once enabled, the\nmalicious code inserted in the Word file would execute through the macros and install\nthe Emotet malware on the victim’s computer.\n\nImage source:\n\nTrend Micro\nThe Emotet operation then evolved into two streams of cybercrime:\n\n1. One was the delivery of malicious code to victims’ computers. The Emotet group would\n\ninject either their own malware or malicious code from other cybercrime gangs (like\nransomware code) onto computers infected with Emotet.\n2. The second was selling the access to infected systems to other cybercrime units,\n\nsimilar to an Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) model.\n\nThis later became known as malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and cybercrime-as-a-service\n(CaaS) in the cybersecurity community. It was discovered that the Emotet network was used\nto rent access to infected computers to the Ryuk gang for ransomware operations.\n\nThis made Emotet particularly dangerous. Potentially, any cybercrime agency could run their\noperations by ‘renting’ infected servers from Emotet or hiring the Emotet group to run their\nmalicious code.\n\nThe Emotet group created a botnet of infected computers by systematically infecting systems\nacross the globe. The malware later evolved and would automatically use the contacts on an\ninfected computer to send automated phishing emails, increasing the botnet’s size.\n\n## Events Leading to Emotet’s Destruction\n\nEmotet was known to have run three separate botnets as of September 2019, Epoch 1,\nEpoch 2 and Epoch 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nEmotet operations were detected globally in July 2020. The main malware being injected\nwas TrickBot and Qbot, both of which were used primarily to steal banking account\ncredentials and automate the spread of Emotet. Additionally, researchers had uncovered that\nthe malicious files being spread would install malware that would run a PowerShell script to\npull payloads from other malicious websites and infected systems.\n\nLater in November 2020, Emotet operations extended to using parked domains to distribute\npayloads to infected systems.\n\nIn January 2021, Europol and Eurojust teamed up with other cybercrime authorities\nworldwide and launched a massive attack against the Emotet group. By then, the Emotet\nbotnet was hundreds of servers wide and spread across the globe.\n\nThrough the joint efforts of international cybercrime units, law enforcement was able to gain\ncontrol of Emotet’s infrastructure and dismantle it from the inside. To cripple the group\ncompletely, a new approach was implemented. Infected machines were redirected to a law\nenforcement-controlled infrastructure to prevent any remote control by hackers.\n\n## Protecting Against Emotet\n\nMicrosoft Windows computers are particularly vulnerable. Systems running Windows\nshould be up-to-date with the latest patches for Windows.\nThe Emotet malware is still being circulated via email. Do not download or click any\nsuspicious file or link. Malicious emails appear to come from contacts, so beware of\nemails that seem legitimate as well.\nUse cybersecurity software to protect local files and browsing activity.\n[Use heuristic detection with the help of Indusface WAS or manual pen-testing](https://www.indusface.com/web-application-scanning.php?utm_source=Infosecurity-Magazine-article&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Infosecurity-Magazine-article-emotet-is-back)\n\n## Final Words\n\nThe return of Emotet is especially problematic for businesses because of its tie to\nransomware. However, businesses can protect their servers from being infected with proper\nprecautions. Educate employees and users within the organization network about best\npractices for emails to stay safe.\n\n\n-----",
