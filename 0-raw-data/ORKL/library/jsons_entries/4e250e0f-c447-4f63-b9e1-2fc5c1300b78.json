Their targets have also included the governments of members\nof the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern\ngovernments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian\nspeakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs.\n\nThe Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we\nidentify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke,\nHammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged\nin apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or\neven thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated\norganizations.\n\nThese campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible. If the\ncompromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the\ntoolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise\nand long-term intelligence gathering.\n\n##### ...the Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets [...], as well as in their ability to operate with impunity.\n\nIn addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently\nengage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing different toolsets. These\ntargeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of\nthese campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests\nof the Russian Federation at those times.\n\nThe Dukes rapidly react to research being published about their toolsets and\noperations. However, the group (or their sponsors) value their operations so highly\nthat though they will attempt to modify their tools to evade detection and regain\nstealth, they will not cease operations to do so, but will instead incrementally modify\ntheir tools while continuing apparently as previously planned.\n\nIn some of the most extreme cases, the Dukes have been known to engage in\ncampaigns with unaltered versions of tools that only days earlier have been brought\nto the public’s attention by security companies and actively mentioned in the\nmedia. In doing so, the Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue\nsuccessfully compromising their targets even when their tools have been publicly\nexposed, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4\n\n THE STORY OF THE DUKES\n\nThe story of the Dukes, as it is currently known, begins with a malware toolset that we call PinchDuke. This toolset\nconsists of multiple loaders and an information-stealer trojan. Importantly, PinchDuke trojan samples always contain\na notable text string, which we believe is used as a campaign identifier by the Dukes group to distinguish between\nmultiple attack campaigns that are run in parallel. These campaign identifiers, which frequently specify both the date\nand target of the campaign, provide us with a tantalizing view into the early days of the Dukes.\n\n###### 2008: Chechnya\n\n\nThe earliest activity we have been able to definitively\nattribute to the Dukes are two PinchDuke campaigns\nfrom November 2008. These campaigns use PinchDuke\nsamples that were, according to their compilation\ntimestamps, created on the 5[th] and 12[th] of November 2008.\nThe campaign identifiers found in these two samples\nare respectively, “alkavkaz.com20081105” and “cihaderi.\nnet20081112”.\n\nThe first campaign identifier, found in the sample\ncompiled on the 5[th], references alkavkaz.com, a domain\nassociated with a Turkish website proclaiming to be the\n“Chechan [sic] Informational Center” (image 1, page\n5). The second campaign identifier, from the sample\ncompiled on the 12[th], references cihaderi.net, another\nTurkish website that claims to provide “news from the\njihad world” and which dedicates a section of its site to\nChechnya.\n\nDue to a lack of other PinchDuke samples from 2008\nor earlier, we are unable to estimate when the Duke\noperation originally began. Based on our technical\nanalysis of the known PinchDuke samples from 2008\n\n\nhowever, we believe PinchDuke to have been under\ndevelopment by the summer of 2008.\n\nIn fact, we believe that by the autumn of 2008, the Dukes\nwere already developing not one but at least two distinct\nmalware toolsets. This assertion is based on the oldest\ncurrently known sample of another Duke-related toolset,\nGeminiDuke, which was compiled on the 26[th] of January\n2009. This sample, like the early PinchDuke samples,\nappears to already be a “fully-grown” sample, which is why\nwe believe GeminiDuke was under development by the\nautumn of 2008.\n\nThat the Dukes were already developing and operating\nat least two distinct malware toolsets by the second\nhalf of 2008 suggests to us that either the size of their\ncyberespionage operation was already large enough to\nwarrant such an arsenal of tools, or that they expected\ntheir operation to grow significantly enough in the\nforeseeable future to warrant the development of such an\narsenal. We examine each of the Duke toolsets in greater\ndetail later in the Tools and Techniques section (page 16).\n\n\n###### Etymology: a note on names\n\nThe origins of the Duke toolset names can be traced back to when\nresearchers at Kaspersky Labs coined the term “MiniDuke” to\nidentify the first Duke-related malware they found. As explained in\ntheir whitepaper[[7]], the researchers observed the surprisingly small\nMiniDuke backdoor being spread via the same exploit that was\nbeing used by a malware that they had already named ItaDuke; the\n“Duke” part of this malware’s name had in turn come about because\nit reminded the researchers of the notable Duqu threat. Despite the\nshared history of the name itself however, it is important to note that\nthere is no reason to believe that the Duke toolsets themselves are in\nany way related to the ItaDuke malware, or to Duqu for that matter.\n\nAs researchers continued discovering new toolsets that were created\nand used by the same group that had been operating MiniDuke, the\nnew toolsets were also given “Duke”-derived names, and thus the\nthreat actor operating the toolsets started to be commonly referred\nto as “the Dukes”. The only other publicly used name for the threat\nactor that we are aware of is “APT29”[[22]].\n\nSome exceptions to this naming convention do exist, and in the case\nof specific Duke toolsets, other commonly used names are listed in\nh l d h ( )\n\n\n“duke”\n\nDuqu\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2009: First known campaigns against the West\n\nBased on the campaign identifiers found in PinchDuke\nsamples discovered from 2009, the targets of the Dukes\ngroup during that year included organizations such as\nthe Ministry of Defense of Georgia and the ministries of\nforeign affairs of Turkey and Uganda. Campaign identifiers\nfrom 2009 also reveal that by that time, the Dukes were\nalready actively interested in political matters related\nto the United States (US) and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO), as they ran campaigns targeting\n(among other organizations) a US-based foreign policy\nthink tank, another set of campaigns related to a NATO\nexercise held in Europe, and a third set apparently\ntargeting what was then known as the Georgian\n“Information Centre on NATO”.\n\nOf these campaigns, two clusters in particular stand out.\nThe first is a set of campaigns from the 16[th] and 17[th] of April,\n2009, that targeted a US-based foreign policy think tank,\nas well as government institutions in Poland and the Czech\nRepublic (image 1, below). These campaigns utilized\nspecially-crafted malicious Microsoft Word documents\nand PDF files, which were sent as e-mail attachments to\nvarious personnel in an attempt to infiltrate the targeted\norganizations.\n\nWe believe this cluster of campaigns had a joint goal of\ngathering intelligence on the sentiments of the targeted\n\n\n###### 5\n\ncountries with respect to the plans being discussed at the\ntime for the US to locate their “European Interceptor Site”\nmissile defense base in Poland, with a related radar station\nthat was intended to be located in the Czech Republic.\nRegarding the timing of these campaigns, it is curious to\nnote that they began only 11 days after President Barack\nObama gave a speech on the 5[th] of April declaring his\nintention to proceed with the deployment of these missile\ndefenses [[1]].\n\nThe second notable cluster comprises of two campaigns\nthat were possibly aimed at gathering information on\nGeorgia-NATO relations. The first of these runs used\nthe campaign identifier “natoinfo_ge”, an apparent\nreference to the www.natoinfo.ge website belonging to\na Georgian political body that has since been renamed\n“Information Centre on NATO and EU”. Although the\ncampaign identifier itself doesn’t contain a date, we\nbelieve the campaign to have originated around the 7[th]\nof June 2009, which was when the PinchDuke sample\nin question was compiled. This belief is based on the\nobservation that in all of the other PinchDuke samples\nwe have analyzed, the date of the campaign identifier has\nbeen within a day of the compilation date. The second\ncampaign identifier, which we suspect may be related, is\n“mod_ge_2009_07_03” from a month later and apparently\ntargeting the Ministry of Defense of Georgia.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 6\n\n 2010: The emergence of CosmicDuke in the Caucasus\n\nThe spring of 2010 saw continued PinchDuke campaigns\nagainst Turkey and Georgia, but also numerous campaigns\nagainst other members of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\nAzerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Of these, the campaign with\nthe identifier “kaz_2010_07_30”, which possibly targeted\nKazakhstan, is of note because it is the last PinchDuke\ncampaign we have observed. We believe that during\nthe first half of 2010, the Dukes slowly migrated from\nPinchDuke and started using a new infostealer malware\ntoolset that we call CosmicDuke.\n\nThe first known sample of the CosmicDuke toolset\nwas compiled on the 16[th] of January 2010. Back then,\nCosmicDuke still lacked most of the credential-stealing\nfunctionality found in later samples. We believe that\nduring the spring of 2010, the credential and file\nstealing capabilities of PinchDuke were slowly ported to\nCosmicDuke, effectively making PinchDuke obsolete.\n\nDuring this period of transition, CosmicDuke would\noften embed PinchDuke so that, upon execution,\nCosmicDuke would write to disk and execute PinchDuke.\nBoth PinchDuke and CosmicDuke would then operate\nindependently on the same compromised host, including\nperforming separate information gathering, data\nexfiltration and communication with a command and\ncontrol (C&C) server - although both malware would often\nuse the same C&C server. We believe the purpose of this\nparallel use was to ‘fieldtest’ the new CosmicDuke tool,\nwhile at the same time ensuring operational success with\nthe tried-and-tested PinchDuke.\n\nDuring this period of CosmicDuke testing and\ndevelopment, the Duke authors also started\nexperimenting with the use of privilege escalation\nvulnerabilities. Specifically, on the 19[th] of January 2010\nsecurity researcher Tavis Ormandy disclosed a local\nprivilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2010-0232)\naffecting Microsoft Windows. As part of the disclosure,\nOrmandy also included the source code for a proof-ofconcept exploit for the vulnerability [[4]]. Just 7 days later,\non the 26[th] of January, a component for CosmicDuke was\ncompiled that exploited the vulnerability and allowed the\ntool to operate with higher privileges.\n\n\n###### One loader to load them all (almost)\n\nIn addition to all the other components being\nproduced by the Dukes group, in 2010 they were\nalso actively developing and testing a new loader\n\n- a component that wraps the core malware code\nand provides an additional layer of obfuscation.\n\nThe first sample of this loader was compiled\non the 26[th] of July 2010, making it a direct\npredecessor of what has since become known\nas the “MiniDuke loader”, as later versions\nwere extensively used by both MiniDuke and\nCosmicDuke.\n\nSome hints about the history of the “MiniDuke\nloader” were noted in the CosmicDuke\nwhitepaper we published [[5]] in 2014, where we\nobserved that the loader appeared to have\nbeen in use with CosmicDuke before it was\nused with MiniDuke. In fact, we now know that\nbefore being used with either, the “MiniDuke\nloader” was used to load PinchDuke. The first\nknown sample of the loader was used during the\nsummer of 2010, while the most recent samples\nwere seen during the spring of 2015.\n\nThis neatly ties together many of the tools\nused by the Dukes group, as versions of this\none loader have been used to load malware\nfrom three different Dukes-related toolsets –\nCosmicDuke, PinchDuke, and MiniDuke – over\nthe course of five years.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2011: John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria\n\nDuring 2011, the Dukes appear to have significantly\nexpanded both their arsenal of malware toolsets and\ntheir C&C infrastructure. While the Dukes employed both\nhacked websites and purposely rented servers for their\nC&C infrastructure, the group rarely registered their own\ndomain names, preferring instead to connect to their selfoperated servers via IP addresses.\n\nThe beginning of 2011 however saw a significant break\nfrom that routine, when a large grouping of domain\nnames was registered by the Dukes in two batches; the\nfirst batch was registered on the 29[th] of January and the\nsecond on the 13[th] of February. All the domains in both\nbatches were initially registered with the same alias: “John\nKasai of Klagenfurt, Austria” (image 2, above). These\ndomains were used by the Dukes in campaigns involving\nmany of their different malware toolsets all the way until\n2014. Like the “MiniDuke loader”, these “John Kasai”\ndomains also provide a common thread tying together\nmuch of the tools and infrastructure of the Dukes.\n\n###### 2011: Continuing expansion of the Dukes arsenal\n\nBy 2011, the Dukes had already developed at least\n3 distinct malware toolsets, including a plethora of\nsupporting components such as loaders and persistence\nmodules. In fact, as a sign of their arsenal’s breadth,\nthey had already decided to retire one of these malware\ntoolsets as obsolete after developing a replacement for it,\nseemingly from scratch.\n\nThe Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011\nwith the addition of two more toolsets: MiniDuke and\nCozyDuke. While all of the earlier toolsets – GeminiDuke,\nPinchDuke, and CosmicDuke – were designed around\na core infostealer component, MiniDuke is centered\non a simplistic backdoor component whose purpose is\nto enable the remote execution of commands on the\ncompromised system. The first observed samples of the\nMiniDuke backdoor component are from May 2011. This\nbackdoor component however is technically very closely\nrelated to GeminiDuke, to the extent that we believe\nthem to share parts of their source code. The origins\nof MiniDuke can thus be traced back to the origins of\n\n\n###### 7\n\nIMAGE 2: COMPARING WHOIS\nREGISTRATION DETAILS\n\nLeft - Original whois registration details\nfor natureinhome.com, one of the Duke\nC&C server domains registered on the\n29[th] of January, 2011 to “John Kasai”\n\nRight - Details for the domain were later\nchanged, providing a small glimpse of\nthe Dukes’ sense of humor\n\nGeminiDuke, of which the earliest observed sample was\ncompiled in January of 2009.\n\nUnlike the simplistic MiniDuke toolset, CozyDuke is a\nhighly versatile, modular, malware “platform” whose\nfunctionality lies not in a single core component but in an\narray of modules that it may be instructed to download\nfrom its C&C server. These modules are used to selectively\nprovide CozyDuke with just the functionality deemed\nnecessary for the mission at hand. CozyDuke’s modular\nplatform approach is a clear break from the designs of the\nprevious Duke toolsets.\n\nThe stylistic differences between CozyDuke and its older\nsiblings are further exemplified by the way it was coded.\nAll of the 4 previously mentioned toolsets were written\nin a minimalistic style commonly seen with malware;\nMiniDuke even goes as far as having many components\nwritten in Assembly language. CozyDuke however\nrepresents the complete opposite. Instead of being\nwritten in Assembly or C, it was written in C++, which\nprovides added layers of abstraction for the developer’s\nperusal, at the cost of added complexity.\n\nContrary to what might be expected from malware, early\nCozyDuke versions also lacked any attempt at obfuscating\nor hiding their true nature. In fact, they were extremely\nopen and verbose about their functionality - for example,\nearly samples contained a plethora of logging messages\nin unencrypted form. In comparison, even the earliest\nknown GeminiDuke samples encrypted any strings that\nmight have given away the malware’s true nature.\n\nFinally, early CozyDuke versions also featured other\nelements that one would associate more with a traditional\nsoftware development project than with malware. For\ninstance, the earliest known CozyDuke version utilized\na feature of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler known as\nrun-time error checking. This feature added automatic\nerror checking to critical parts of the program’s execution\nat the cost, from a malware perspective, of providing\nadditional hints that make the malware’s functionality\neasier for reverse engineers to understand.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 8\n\nIMAGE 3: MINIDUKE DECOY\n\nOne of the Ukraine-themed decoy\ndocuments used during a MiniDuke\ncampaign in February 2013\n\nBased on these and other similar stylistic differences\nobserved between CozyDuke and its older siblings, we\nspeculate that while the older Duke families appear to\nbe the work of someone with a background in malware\nwriting (or at the least in hacking), CozyDuke’s author or\nauthors more likely came from a software development\nbackground.\n\n###### 2012: Hiding in the shadows\n\nWe still know surprisingly few specifics about the Dukes\ngroup’s activities during 2012. Based on samples of\nDuke malware from 2012, the Dukes do appear to have\ncontinued actively using and developing all of their\ntools. Of these, CosmicDuke and MiniDuke appear to\nhave been in more active use, while receiving only minor\nupdates. GeminiDuke and CozyDuke on the other hand\nappear to have been less used in actual operations, but\ndid undergo much more significant development.\n\n###### 2013: MiniDuke flies too close to the sun\n\nOn the 12[th] of February 2013, FireEye published a\nblogpost[[6] ]alerting readers to a combination of new\nAdobe Reader 0-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2013-0640\nand CVE-2013-0641, that were being actively exploited\nin the wild. 8 days after FireEye’s initial alert, Kaspersky\nspotted the same exploit being used to spread an entirely\ndifferent malware family from the one mentioned in the\noriginal report. On 27[th] February, Kaspersky[ [7]] and CrySyS[[8]]\nLab published research on this previously unidentified\nmalware family, dubbing it MiniDuke.\n\nAs we now know, by February 2013 the Dukes group\nhad been operating MiniDuke and other toolsets for at\nleast 4 and a half years. Their malware had not stayed\nundetected for those 4 and a half years. In fact, in 2009 a\nPinchDuke sample had been included in the malware set\nused by the AV-Test security product testing organization\nto perform anti-virus product comparison reviews. Until\n2013 however, earlier Duke toolsets had not been put in a\nproper context. That finally started to change in 2013.\n\n\nThe MiniDuke samples that were spread using these\nexploits were compiled on the 20[th] of February, after the\nexploit was already publicly known. One might argue\nthat since this took place after the exploits were publicly\nmentioned, the Dukes simply copied them. We however\ndo not believe so. As mentioned by Kaspersky, even\nthough the exploits used for these MiniDuke campaigns\nwere near-identical to those described by FireEye, there\nwere nevertheless small differences. Of these, the crucial\none is the presence of PDB strings in the MiniDuke\nexploits. These strings, which are generated by the\ncompiler when using specific compilation settings, means\nthat the components of the exploits used with MiniDuke\nhad to have been compiled independently from those\ndescribed by FireEye.\n\nWe do not know whether the Dukes compiled the\ncomponents themselves or whether someone else\ncompiled the components before handing them to the\ngroup. This does however still rule out the possibility that\nthe Dukes simply obtained copies of the exploit binaries\ndescribed by FireEye and repurposed them.\n\nIn our opinion, this insistence on using exploits that are\nalready under heightened scrutiny suggests the existence\nof at least one of three circumstances. Firstly, the Dukes\nmay have been confident enough in their own abilities\n(and in the slowness of their opponents to react to\nnew threats) that they did not care if their targets may\nalready be on the lookout for anyone exploiting these\nvulnerabilities. Secondly, the value the Dukes intended\nto gain from these MiniDuke campaigns may have been\nso great that they deemed it worth the risk of getting\nnoticed. Or thirdly, the Dukes may have invested so much\ninto these campaigns that by the time FireEye published\ntheir alert, the Dukes felt they could not afford to halt the\ncampaigns.\n\nWe believe all three circumstances to have coexisted\nat least to some extent. As will become evident in this\nreport, this was not a one-off case but a recurring theme\nwith the Dukes, in that they would rather continue with\ntheir operations as planned than retreat from operating\nunder the spotlight.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs originally detailed in Kaspersky’s whitepaper, the\nMiniDuke campaigns from February 2013 employed\nspear-phishing emails with malicious PDF file attachments.\nThese PDFs would attempt to silently infect the recipient\nwith MiniDuke, while distracting them by displaying a\ndecoy document. The headings of these documents\nincluded “Ukraine’s NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP)\nDebates”, “The Informal Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)\nSeminar on Human Rights”, and “Ukraine’s Search for a\nRegional Foreign Policy” (image 3, page 8). The targets of\nthese campaigns, according to Kaspersky, were located\nvariously in Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain[ [7]].\n\nKaspersky goes on to state that by obtaining log files\nfrom the MiniDuke command and control servers, they\nwere able to identify high-profile victims from Ukraine,\nBelgium, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland,\nthe United States and Hungary[ [7]].\n\n###### 2013: The curious case of OnionDuke\n\nAfter the February campaigns, MiniDuke activity\nappeared to quiet down, although it did not fully stop,\nfor the rest of 2013. The Dukes group as a whole however\nshowed no sign of slowing down. In fact, we saw yet\nanother Duke malware toolset, OnionDuke, appear first\nin 2013. Like CozyDuke, OnionDuke appears to have been\ndesigned with versatility in mind, and takes a similarly\nmodular platform approach. The OnionDuke toolset\nincludes various modules for purposes such as password\nstealing, information gathering, denial of service (DoS)\nattacks, and even posting spam to the Russian social\nmedia network, VKontakte. The OnionDuke toolset also\nincludes a dropper, an information stealer variant and\nmultiple distinct versions of the core component that is\nresponsible for interacting with the various modules.\n\nWhat makes OnionDuke especially curious is an infection\nvector it began using during the summer of 2013. To\nspread the toolset, the Dukes used a wrapper to combine\nOnionDuke with legitimate applications, created torrent\nfiles containing these trojanized applications, then\nuploaded them to websites hosting torrent files (image\n4, above). Victims who used the torrent files to download\nthe applications would end up getting infected with\nOnionDuke.\n\n\n###### 9\n\nIMAGE 4: ONIONDUKE-TROJANIZED\nTORRENT FILE\n\nExample of a torrent file containing\nan executable trojanized with the\nOnionDuke toolset\n\nFor most of the OnionDuke components we observed,\nthe first versions that we are aware of were compiled\nduring the summer of 2013, suggesting that this was\na period of active development around this toolset.\nCritically however, the first sample of the OnionDuke\ndropper, which we have observed being used only with\ncomponents of this toolset, was compiled on the 17[th]\nof February 2013. This is significant because it suggests\nthat OnionDuke was under development before any\npart of the Duke operation became public. OnionDuke’s\ndevelopment therefore could not have been simply a\nresponse to the outing of one of the other Duke malware,\nbut was instead intended for use alongside the other\ntoolsets. This indication that the Dukes planned to use\nan arsenal of 5 malware toolsets in parallel suggests that\nthey were operating with both significant resources and\ncapacity.\n\n###### 2013: The Dukes and Ukraine\n\nIn 2013, many of the decoy documents employed by\nthe Dukes in their campaigns were related to Ukraine;\nexamples include a letter undersigned by the First\nDeputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, a letter\nfrom the embassy of the Netherlands in Ukraine to the\nUkrainian Ministry of Foreign affairs and a document titled\n“Ukraine’s Search for a Regional Foreign Policy”.

It is therefore\nimportant to note that, contrary to what might be\nassumed, we have actually observed a drop instead of an\nincrease in Ukraine-related campaigns from the Dukes\nfollowing the country’s political crisis.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to some other suspected Russian\nthreat actors (such as Operation Pawn Storm[ [10]]) who\nappear to have increased their targeting of Ukraine\nfollowing the crisis. This supports our analysis that\nthe overarching theme in the Dukes’ targeting is the\ncollection of intelligence to support diplomatic efforts.\nThe Dukes actively targeted Ukraine before the crisis, at a\ntime when Russia was still weighing her options, but once\nRussia moved from diplomacy to direct action, Ukraine\nwas no longer relevant to the Dukes in the same way.\n\n\nAs originally detailed in Kaspersky’s whitepaper, the For most of the\nMiniDuke campaigns from February 2013 employed\nspear-phishing emails with malicious PDF file attachments.\nThese PDFs would attempt to silently infect the recipient\nwith MiniDuke, while distracting them by displaying a Critically however, the first sample of the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 10\n\nIMAGE 5: COSMICDUKE DECOY\n\nScreenshot of a decoy document\nappearing to be an order for growth\nhormones, which was used in a\nCosmicDuke campaign in September 2013\n\n###### 2013: CosmicDuke’s war on drugs\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, in September 2013 a\nCosmicDuke campaign was observed targeting Russian\nspeakers involved in the trade of illegal and controlled\nsubstances (image 5, above).\n\nKaspersky Labs, who sometimes refer to CosmicDuke as\n‘Bot Gen Studio’, speculated that “one possibility is that\n‘Bot Gen Studio’ is a malware platform also available as\na so-called ‘legal spyware’ tool”; therefore, those using\nCosmicDuke to target drug dealers and those targeting\ngovernments are two separate entities[ [11]]. We however\nfeel it is unlikely that the CosmicDuke operators targeting\ndrug dealers and those targeting governments could\nbe two entirely independent entities. A shared supplier\nof malware would explain the overlap in tools, but it\nwould not explain the significant overlap we have also\nobserved in operational techniques related to command\nand control infrastructure. Instead, we feel the targeting\nof drug dealers was a new task for a subset of the Dukes\ngroup, possibly due to the drug trade’s relevance to\nsecurity policy issues. We also believe the tasking to have\nbeen temporary, because we have not observed any\nfurther similar targeting from the Dukes after the spring\nof 2014.\n\n###### 2014: MiniDuke’s rise from the ashes\n\nWhile MiniDuke activity decreased significantly during\nthe rest of 2013 following the attention it garnered from\nresearchers, the beginning of 2014 saw the toolset back\nin full force. All MiniDuke components, from the loader\nand downloader to the backdoor, had been slightly\nupdated and modified during the downtime. Interestingly,\nthe nature of these modifications suggests that their\nprimary purpose was to regain the element of stealth and\nundetectability that had been lost almost a year earlier.\n\nOf these modifications, arguably the most important were\nthe ones done to the loader. These resulted in a loader\nversion that would later become known as the “Nemesis\nGemina loader” due to PDB strings found in many of the\nsamples. It is however still only an iteration on earlier\nversions of the MiniDuke loader.\n\n\nThe first observed samples of the Nemesis Gemina loader\n(compiled on 14[th ]December 2013) were used to load the\nupdated MiniDuke backdoor, but by the spring of 2014\nthe Nemesis Gemina loader was also observed in use with\nCosmicDuke.\n\n###### 2014: CosmicDuke’s moment of fame and the scramble that ensued\n\nFollowing the MiniDuke expose, CosmicDuke in turn\ngot its moment of fame when F-Secure published a\nwhitepaper about it on 2[nd] July 2014 [[5]]. The next day,\nKaspersky also published their own research on the\nmalware[ [11]]. It should be noted that until this point,\neven though CosmicDuke had been in active use for\nover 4 years, and had undergone minor modifications\nand updates during that time, even the most recent\nCosmicDuke samples would often embed persistence\ncomponents that date back to 2012. These samples would\nalso contain artefacts of functionality from the earliest\nCosmicDuke samples from 2010.\n\nIt is therefore valuable to observe how the Dukes reacted\nto CosmicDuke’s outing at the beginning of July. By the\nend of that month, CosmicDuke samples we found that\nhad been compiled on the 30[th ]of July had shed unused\nparts of their code that had essentially just been relics of\nthe past. Similarly, some of the hardcoded values that had\nremained unaltered in CosmicDuke samples for many\nyears had been changed. We believe these edits were an\nattempt at evading detection by modifying or removing\nparts of the toolset that the authors believed might be\nhelpful in identifying and detecting it.\n\nConcurrently with the alterations to CosmicDuke, the\nDukes were also hard at work modifying their trusted\nloader. Much like the CosmicDuke toolset, the loader\nused by both MiniDuke and CosmicDuke had previously\nonly undergone one major update (the Nemesis Gemina\nupgrade) since the first known samples from 2010. Again,\nmuch of the modification work focused on removing\nredundant code in an attempt to appear different from\nearlier versions of the loader. Interestingly however,\nanother apparent evasion trick was also attempted forging of the loaders’ compilation timestamps.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first CosmicDuke sample we observed after the initial\nresearch on CosmicDuke was a sample compiled on the\n30[th ]of July 2014. The loader used by the sample purported\nto have been compiled on the 25[th] of March 2010. Due\nto artefacts left in the loader during compilation time\nhowever, we know that it used a specific version of the\nBoost library, 1.54.0, that was only published on the 1[st]\nof July 2013[ [12]]. The compilation timestamp therefore\nhad to have been faked. F-Secure’s whitepaper[[5] ]on\nCosmicDuke includes a timeline of the loader’s usage,\nbased on compilation timestamps. Perhaps the Dukes\ngroup thought that by faking a timestamp from before the\nearliest one cited in the whitepaper, they might be able to\nconfuse researchers.\n\nDuring the rest of 2014 and the spring of 2015, the Dukes\ncontinued making similar evasion-focused modifications\nto CosmicDuke, as well as experimenting with ways to\nobfuscate the loader. In the latter case however, the\ngroup appear to have also simultaneously developed an\nentirely new loader, which we first observed being used in\nconjunction with CosmicDuke during the spring of 2015.\n\nWhile it is not surprising that the Dukes reacted to\nmultiple companies publishing extensive reports on one\nof their key toolsets, it is valuable to note the manner in\nwhich they responded. Much like the MiniDuke expose\nin February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize\ncontinuing operations over staying hidden. They could\nhave ceased all use of CosmicDuke (at least until they had\ndeveloped a new loader) or retired it entirely, since they\nstill had other toolsets available. Instead, they opted for\nminimal downtime and attempted to continue operations,\nwith only minor modifications to the toolset.\n\n###### 2014: CozyDuke and monkey videos\n\nWhile we now know that CozyDuke had been under\ndevelopment since at least the end of 2011, it was not\nuntil the early days of July 2014 that the first large-scale\nCozyDuke campaign that we are aware of took place.\nThis campaign, like later CozyDuke campaigns, began\nwith spear-phishing emails that tried to impersonate\ncommonly seen spam emails. These spear-phishing emails\nwould contain links that eventually lead the victim to\nbecoming infected with CozyDuke.\n\n\n###### 11\n\nIMAGE 6: COZYDUKE DECOYS\n\nLeft - US letter fax test decoy used\nin CozyDuke campaigns\n\nRight - Screenshot of the monkey\nvideo decoy also used by CozyDuke\n\nSome of the CozyDuke spear-phishing emails from\nearly July posed as e-fax arrival notifications, a popular\ntheme for spam emails, and used the same “US letter\nfax test page” decoy document that was used a year\nlater by CloudDuke. In at least one case however, the\nemail instead contained a link to a zip-archive file named\n“Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip”, which was hosted on the\nDropBox cloud storage service. What made this particular\ncase interesting was that instead of the usual dull PDF\nfile, the decoy was a Flash video file, more specifically a\nSuper Bowl advertisement from 2007 purporting to show\nmonkeys at an office (image 6, above).\n\n###### 2014: OnionDuke gets caught using a malicious Tor node\n\nOn the 23[rd ]of October 2014, Leviathan Security Group\npublished a blog post describing a malicious Tor exit node\nthey had found. They noted that this node appeared\nto be maliciously modifying any executables that\nwere downloaded through it over a HTTP connection.\nExecuting the modified applications obtained this way\nwould result in the victim being infected with unidentified\nmalware. On the 14[th] of November, F-Secure published\na blog post naming the malware OnionDuke and\nassociating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke, the other\nDuke toolsets known at the time [[13]].\n\nBased on our investigations into OnionDuke, we believe\nthat for about 7 months, from April 2014 to when\nLeviathan published their blog post in October 2014, the\nTor exit node identified by the researchers was being used\nto wrap executables on-the-fly with OnionDuke (image\n7, page 13). This is similar to the way in which the toolset\nwas being spread via trojanized applications in torrent files\nduring the summer of 2013.\n\nWhile investigating the OnionDuke variant being spread\nby the malicious Tor node, we also identified another\nOnionDuke variant that appeared to have successfully\ncompromised multiple victims in the ministry of foreign\naffairs of an Eastern European country during the spring\nof 2014. This variant differed significantly in functionality\nfrom the one being spread via the Tor node, further\nsuggesting that different OnionDuke variants are\nintended for different kinds of victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 12\n\nWe believe that, unusually, the purpose of the OnionDuke\nvariant spread via the Tor node was not to pursue targeted\nattacks but instead to form a small botnet for later use.\nThis OnionDuke variant is related to the one seen during\nthe summer of 2013 being spread via torrent files. Both\nof these infection vectors are highly indiscriminate and\nuntargeted when compared to spear-phishing, the usual\ninfection vector of choice for the Dukes.\n\nFurther, the functionality of the OnionDuke variant is\nderived from a number of modules. While one of these\nmodules gathers system information and another\nattempts to steal the victim’s usernames and passwords,\nas one would expect from a malware used for a targeted\nattack, the other two known OnionDuke modules are\nquite the opposite; one is designed for use in DoS attacks\nand the other for posting predetermined messages to\nthe Russian VKontakte social media site. This sort of\nfunctionality is more common in criminality-oriented\nbotnets, not state-sponsored targeted attacks.\n\nWe have since been able to identify at least two separate\nOnionDuke botnets. We believe the formation of the\nfirst of these botnets began in January 2014, using both\nunidentified infection vectors and the known malicious\nTor node, and continued until our blogpost was published\nin November. We believe the formation of the second\nbotnet began in August 2014 and continued until January\n2015. We have been unable to identify the infection\nvectors used for this second botnet, but the C&C servers\nit used had open directory listings, allowing us to retrieve\nfiles containing listings of victim IP addresses. The\ngeographic distribution of these IP addresses (image 8,\npage 13) further supports our theory that the purpose of\nthis OnionDuke variant was not targeted attacks against\nhigh-profile targets.\n\nOne theory is that the botnets were a criminal side\nbusiness for the Dukes group. The size of the botnet\nhowever (about 1400 bots) is very small if its intended\nuse is for commercial DoS attacks or spam-sending.\nAlternatively, OnionDuke also steals user credentials from\nits victims, providing another potential revenue source.\nThe counter to that argument however is that the value\nof stolen credentials from users in the countries with the\nhighest percentage of OnionDuke bots (Mongolia and\nIndia) are among the lowest on underground markets.\n\n###### 2015: The Dukes up the ante\n\nThe end of January 2015 saw the start of the most highvolume Duke campaign seen thus far, with thousands\nof recipients being sent spear-phishing emails that\ncontained links to compromised websites hosting\nCozyDuke. Curiously, the spear-phishing emails were\nstrikingly similar to the e-fax themed spam usually seen\nspreading ransomware and other common crimeware.\nDue to the sheer number of recipients, it may not have\nbeen possible to customize the emails in the same way as\nwas possible with lower volume campaigns\n\n\nThe similarity to common spam may however also serve\na more devious purpose. It is easy to imagine a security\nanalyst, burdened by the amount of attacks against their\nnetwork, dismissing such common-looking spam as “just\nanother crimeware spam run”, allowing the campaign to,\nin essence, hide in the masses[ [14]].\n\nThe CozyDuke activity continues one of the long-running\ntrends of the Dukes operations, the use of multiple\nmalware toolsets against a single target. In this case, the\nDukes first attempted to infect large numbers of potential\ntargets with CozyDuke (and in a more obvious manner\nthan previously seen). They would then use the toolset to\ngather initial information on the victims, before deciding\nwhich ones to pursue further. For the victims deemed\ninteresting enough, the Dukes would then deploy a\ndifferent toolset.\n\nWe believe the primary purpose of this tactic is an attempt\nat evading detection in the targeted network. Even if the\nnoisy initial CozyDuke campaign is noticed by the victim\norganization, or by someone else who then makes it\npublicly known, defenders will begin by first looking for\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the CozyDuke\ntoolset. If however by that time the Dukes are already\noperating within the victim’s network, using an another\ntoolset with different IOCs, then it is reasonable to assume\nthat it will take much longer for the victim organization to\nnotice the infiltration.\n\nIn previous cases, the group used their malware toolsets\ninterchangeably, as either the initial or a later-stage\ntoolset in a campaign. For these CozyDuke campaigns\nhowever, the Dukes appear to have employed\ntwo particular later-stage toolsets, SeaDuke and\nHammerDuke, that were purposely designed to leave\na persistent backdoor on the compromised network.\nHammerDuke is a set of backdoors that was first seen\nin the wild in February 2015, while SeaDuke is a crossplatform backdoor that was, according to Symantec, first\nspotted in the wild in October 2014 [[15]]. Both toolsets were\noriginally spotted being deployed by CozyDuke to its\nvictims.\n\nWhat makes SeaDuke special is that it was written in\nPython and designed to work on both Windows and Linux\nsystems; it is the first cross-platform tool we have seen\nfrom the Dukes. One plausible reason for developing\nsuch a flexible malware might be that the group were\nincreasingly encountering victim environments where\nusers were using Linux as their desktop operating system.\n\nMeanwhile, HammerDuke is a Windows-only malware\n(written in .NET) and comes in two variants. The simpler\none will connect to a hardcoded C&C server over HTTP\nor HTTPS to download commands to execute. The more\nadvanced variant, on the other hand, will use an algorithm\nto generate a periodically-changing Twitter account\nname and will then attempt to find tweets from that\n# 7931\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 13\n\n\n###### IMAGE 7: FLOWCHART OF HOW ONIONDUKE USES MALICIOUS TOR NODE TO INFECT VICTIMS\n\n VICTIM Request\n\nMALICIOUS Original\nTOR EXIT binary\nNODE\n\n###### Wrapped Response binary\n Executes\n\n Drops\n Original Original binary binary\n\n ONIONDUKE  ONIONDUKE \n Drops Drops\n DROPPER DROPPER ONIONDUKE \n\nCORE COMPONENT\n\nONIONDUKE ONIONDUKE\nCORE COMPONENT CORE COMPONENT\n\n###### IMAGE 8: GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ONIONDUKE BOTNET\n\n\n###### 3% EACH\n\n 2% EACH\n\n\n###### TURKEY, 38\n\n INDONESIA, 34\n\n\n###### MONGOLIA 326 INDIA 23% 260 19%\n\n OTHER 235 17%\n\n\n###### TOTAL: 1389\n\n 284 21%\n\n\n###### EGYPT, 43\n\n USA, 39\n\n\n###### SAUDI ARABIA, 25\n\n BRAZIL, 22\n\n\n1% EACH\n\n\nUNKNOWN\n###### 100 7%\n\n\nPHILIPPINES, 16\nSRI LANKA, 15\nBANGLADESH, 14\nNEPAL, 13\nCAMBODIA, 13\nCHINA, 12\n\n\nPAKISTAN\n###### 64\n\n\nALGERIA\n###### 58 4%\n\nMOROCCO\n62\n###### 4%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 14\n\nIMAGE 9: ONIONDUKE C&C TWEET\n\nScreenshot of a tweet intended for\nOnionDuke, with a link pointing\nto an image file that embeds an\nupdated version of OnionDuke\n\naccount containing links to the actual download location\nof the commands to execute. In this way, the advanced\nHammerDuke variant attempts to hide its network\ntraffic in more legitimate use of Twitter. This method is\nnot unique to HammerDuke, as MiniDuke, OnionDuke,\nand CozyDuke all support similar use of Twitter (image\n9, above) to retrieve links to additional payloads or\ncommands.\n\n###### 2015: CloudDuke\n\nIn the beginning of July 2015, the Dukes embarked on\nyet another large-scale phishing campaign. The malware\ntoolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen\nCloudDuke and we believe that the July campaign marks\nthe first time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes,\nother than possible small-scale testing.\n\nThe CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader,\na downloader, and two backdoor variants. Both\nbackdoors (internally referred to by their authors as\n“BastionSolution” and “OneDriveSolution”) essentially\nallow the operator to remotely execute commands on the\ncompromised machine. The way in which each backdoor\ndoes so however is significantly different. While the\nBastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from\na hard-coded C&C server controlled by the Dukes, the\nOneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud\nstorage service for communicating with its masters,\nmaking it significantly harder for defenders to notice the\ntraffic and block the communication channel. What is\nmost significant about the July 2015 CloudDuke campaign\nis the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two\ndistinct waves of spear-phishing, one during the first days\nof July and the other starting from the 20[th] of the month.\nDetails of the first wave, including a thorough technical\nanalysis of CloudDuke, was published by Palo Alto\nNetworks on 14[th] July [[16]]. This was followed by additional\ndetails from Kaspersky in a blog post published on 16[th ]July\n\n[17].\n\nBoth publications happened before the second wave\ntook place and received notable publicity. Despite the\nattention and public exposure of the toolset’s technical\ndetails (including IOCs) to defenders, the Dukes still\ncontinued with their second wave of spear-phishing,\nincluding the continued use of CloudDuke. The group did\nchange the contents of the spear phishing emails they\n\n\nsent, but they didn’t switch to a new email format; instead,\nthey reverted to the same efax-themed format that they\nhad previously employed, even to the point of reusing the\nexact same decoy document that they had used in the\nCozyDuke campaign a year earlier (July 2014).\n\nThis once more highlights two crucial behavioral elements\nof the Dukes group. Firstly, as with the MiniDuke\ncampaigns of February 2013 and CosmicDuke campaigns\nin the summer of 2014, again the group clearly prioritized\nthe continuation of their operations over maintaining\nstealth. Secondly, it underlines their boldness, arrogance\nand self-confidence; they are clearly confident in both\ntheir ability to compromise their targets even when their\ntools and techniques are already publicly known, and\ncritically, they appear to be extremely confident in their\nability to act with impunity.\n\n###### 2015: Continuing surgical strikes with CosmicDuke\n\nIn addition to the notably overt and large-scale campaigns\nwith CozyDuke and CloudDuke, the Dukes also continued\nto engage in more covert, surgical campaigns using\nCosmicDuke. The latest of these campaigns that we are\naware of occurred during the spring and early summer\nof 2015. As their infection vectors, these campaigns\nused malicious documents exploiting recently fixed\nvulnerabilities.\n\nTwo of these campaigns were detailed in separate blog\nposts by the Polish security company Prevenity, who said\nthat both campaigns targeted Polish entities with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments with\nrelevant Polish language names [[18] [19]]. A third, similar,\nCosmicDuke campaign was observed presumably\ntargeting Georgian entities since it used an attachment\nwith a Georgian-language name that translates to “NATO\nconsolidates control of the Black Sea.docx”.\n\nBased on this, we do not believe that the Dukes are\nreplacing their covert and targeted campaigns with\nthe overt and opportunistic CozyDuke and CloudDuke\nstyle of campaigns. Instead, we believe that they are\nsimply expanding their activities by adding new tools and\ntechniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 15\n\n\n###### IMAGE 10: TIMELINE OF KNOWN ACTIVITY FOR  THE VARIOUS DUKE TOOLKITS\n\nLoader\n\nCloudDuke\n\n###### 2015\n\nHammerDuke\n\nBackdoor\n\nSeaDuke\n\n###### 2014\n\n 2013\n\nOnionDuke\n\n###### 2012\n\nCozyDuke\n\n###### YEAR\n\n 2011\n\nMiniDuke\n\n###### 2010\n\nCosmicDuke\n\n###### LEGEND\n\nMost recent\nknown activity\n\n###### 2009\n\nFirst known activity\n\n###### 2008\n\n 2007 TOOLKITS\n\n|Loader CloudDuke|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||Backdoor||||HammerDuke SeaDuke|\n|||||||||\n|||||||OnionDuke||\n||||||CozyDuke|||\n|||MiniDuke||||||\n||CosmicDuke LEGEND Most recent known activity|||||||\n|GeminiDuke First known activity PinchDuke||||||||\n|||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 16\n\n TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE DUKES\n\n|PINCHDUKE|First known activity: November 2008 Most recent known activity: Summer 2010 Other names: N/A C&C communication methods: HTTP (S) Known toolset components: ◊ Multiple loaders ◊ Information stealer|\n|---|---|\n\n\nThe PinchDuke toolset consists of multiple loaders and\na core information stealer trojan. The loaders associated\nwith the PinchDuke toolset have also been observed\nbeing used with CosmicDuke.\n\nThe PinchDuke information stealer gathers system\nconfiguration information, steals user credentials,\nand collects user files from the compromised host\ntransferring these via HTTP(S) to a C&C server. We\nbelieve PinchDuke’s credential stealing functionality\nis based on the source code of the Pinch credential\nstealing malware (also known as LdPinch) that was\ndeveloped in the early 2000s and has later been openly\ndistributed on underground forums.\n\nCredentials targeted by PinchDuke include ones\nassociated with the following software or services:\n\n - The Bat!\n\n - Yahoo!\n\n - Mail.ru\n\n - Passport.Net\n\n - Google Talk\n\n - Netscape Navigator\n\n - Mozilla Firefox\n\n - Mozilla Thunderbird\n\n - Internet Explorer\n\n - Microsoft Outlook\n\n - WinInet Credential Cache\n\n - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)\n\nPinchDuke will also search for files that have been\ncreated within a predefined timeframe and whose file\nextension is present in a predefined list.\n\n\nAs a curiosity, most PinchDuke samples contain a\nRussian language error message:\n\n“Ошибка названия модуля! Название секции\nданных должно быть 4 байта!”\n\nWhich roughly translates to:\n\n“There is an error in the module’s name! The length of\nthe data section name must be 4 bytes!”\n\n\n-----\n\n|GEMINIDUKE|First known activity: January 2009 Most recent known activity: December 2012 Other names: N/A C&C communication methods: HTTP (S) Known toolset components: ◊ Loader ◊ Information stealer ◊ Multiple persistence components|\n|---|---|\n\n\nThe GeminiDuke toolset consists of a core information\nstealer, a loader and multiple persistence-related\ncomponents. Unlike CosmicDuke and PinchDuke,\nGeminiDuke primarily collects information on the victim\ncomputer’s configuration. The collected details include:\n\n - Local user accounts\n\n - Network settings\n\n - Internet proxy settings\n\n - Installed drivers\n\n - Running processes\n\n - Programs previously executed by users\n\n - Programs and services configured to\nautomatically run at startup\n\n - Values of environment variables\n\n - Files and folders present in any users home folder\n\n - Files and folders present in any users My\nDocuments\n\n - Programs installed to the Program Files folder\n\n - Recently accessed files, folders and programs\n\nAs is common for malware, the GeminiDuke infostealer\nuses a mutex to ensure that only one instance of itself\nis running at a time. What is less common is that the\nname used for the mutex is often a timestamp. We\nbelieve these timestamps to be generated during the\ncompilation of GeminiDuke from the local time of the\ncomputer being used.\n\nComparing the GeminiDuke compilation timestamps,\nwhich always reference the time in the UTC+0 timezone,\nwith the local time timestamps used as mutex names,\nand adjusting for the presumed timezone difference, we\nnote that all of the mutex names reference a time and\ndate that is within seconds of the respective sample’s\ncompilation timestamp. Additionally, the apparent\ntimezone of the timestamps in all of the GeminiDuke\nsamples compiled during the winter is UTC+3, while for\nsamples compiled during the summer, it is UTC+4.\n\nThe observed timezones correspond to the pre-2011\ndefinition of Moscow Standard Time (MSK)[ [20]], which\nwas UTC+3 during the winter and UTC+4 during the\nsummer. In 2011 MSK stopped following Daylight Saving\nTime (DST) and was set to UTC+4 year-round, then reset\n\n\n###### 17\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nDecember 2012\n\nN/A\n\nHTTP (S)\n\n   - Loader\n\n   - Information stealer\n\n   - Multiple persistence components\n\nto UTC +3 year-round in 2014.

While computers\nusing Microsoft Windows automatically adjust for DST,\nchanges in timezone definitions require that an update\nto Windows be installed. We therefore believe that the\nDukes group simply failed to update the computer they\nwere using to compile GeminiDuke samples, so that the\ntimestamps seen in later samples still appear to follow\nthe old definition of Moscow Standard Time.\n\nThe GeminiDuke infostealer has occasionally been\nwrapped with a loader that appears to be unique to\nGeminiDuke and has never been observed being used\nwith any of the other Duke toolsets. GeminiDuke\nalso occasionally embeds additional executables that\nattempt to achieve persistence on the victim computer.\nThese persistence components appear to be uniquely\ncustomized for use with GeminiDuke, but they use many\nof the same techniques as CosmicDuke persistence\ncomponents.\n\n\nMoscow\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 18\n\n COSMICDUKE First known activity:\n\n**Most recent known activity:**\n\n**Other names:**\n\n**C&C communication methods:**\n\n**Known toolset components:**\n\nThe CosmicDuke toolset is designed around a main\ninformation stealer component. This information stealer\nis augmented by a variety of components that the\ntoolset operators may selectively include with the main\ncomponent to provide additional functionalities, such\nas multiple methods of establishing persistence, as well\nas modules that attempt to exploit privilege escalation\nvulnerabilities in order to execute CosmicDuke with\nhigher privileges. CosmicDuke’s information stealing\nfunctionality includes:\n\n - Keylogging\n\n - Taking screenshots\n\n - Stealing clipboard contents\n\n - Stealing user files with file extensions that match a\npredefined list\n\n - Exporting the users cryptographic certificates\nincluding private keys\n\n - Collecting user credentials, including passwords,\nfor a variety of popular chat and email programs\nas well as from web browsers\n\nCosmicDuke may use HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or WebDav to\nexfiltrate the collected data to a hardcoded C&C server.\n\nWhile we believe CosmicDuke to be an entirely customwritten toolset with no direct sharing of code with other\nDuke toolsets, the high-level ways in which many of its\nfeatures have been implemented appear to be shared\nwith other members of the Duke arsenal.\n\nSpecifically, the techniques CosmicDuke uses to extract\nuser credentials from targeted software and to detect\nthe presence of analysis tools appear to be based on\nthe techniques used by PinchDuke. Likewise, many of\nCosmicDuke’s persistence components use techniques\nalso used by components associated with GeminiDuke\nand CozyDuke. In all of these cases, the techniques are\nthe same, but the code itself has been altered to work\nwith the toolset in question, leading to small differences\nin the final implementation.\n\nA few of the CosmicDuke samples we discovered also\nincluded components that attempt to exploit either\nof the publicly known CVE-2010-0232 or CVE-20104398 privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

It should be noted that CosmicDuke\ndoes not interoperate with the second, embedded\nmalware in any way other than by writing the malware\nto disk and executing it. After that, CosmicDuke and\nthe second malware operate entirely independently of\neach other, including separately contacting their C&C\nservers. Sometimes, both malware have used the same\nC&C server, but in other cases, even the servers have\nbeen different.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that while most of the\ncompilation timestamps for CosmicDuke samples\nappear to be authentic, we are aware of a few cases\nof them being forged. One such case was detailed\non page 10 as an apparent evasion attempt. Another\nis a loader variant seen during the spring of 2010 in\nconjunction with both CosmicDuke and PinchDuke.\nThese loader samples all had compilation timestamps\npurporting to be from the 24[th] or the 25[th] of September,\n2001. However, many of these loader samples embed\nCosmicDuke variants that exploit the CVE-20100232 privilege escalation vulnerability thus making\nit impossible for the compilation timestamps to be\nauthentic.\n\n###### Further reading\n1.

Additionally, a specific loader\nis often associated with the MiniDuke toolset and is\nreferred to as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nWhile the loader has often been used together with\nother MiniDuke components, it has also commonly\nbeen used in conjunction with CosmicDuke and\nPinchDuke. In fact, the oldest samples of the loader\nthat we have found were used with PinchDuke. To\navoid confusion however, we have decided to continue\nreferring to the loader as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nTwo details about MiniDuke components are worth\nnoting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke components were\nwritten in Assembly language. While many malware\nwere written in Assembly during the ‘old days‘ of\ncuriosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a\nrarity. Secondly, some of the MiniDuke components\ndo not contain a hardcoded C&C server address, but\ninstead obtain the address of a current C&C server via\nTwitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the\naddress of a C&C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded\nprimary C&C server responds) is a feature also found in\nOnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke.\n\n\n###### Further reading\n1.

Specifically,\nthe only known infection vector for HammerDuke is\nto be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto\na victim that has already been compromised by that\ntoolset. This, together with HammerDuke’s simplistic\nbackdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used\nby the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on\nCozyDuke victims after CozyDuke performed the initial\ninfection and stole any readily available information\nfrom them.\n\nHammerDuke is however interesting because it is\nwritten in .NET, and even more so because of its\noccasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication\nchannel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a\nhardcoded C&C server address from which they will\nretrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants\nwill first use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter\naccount name based on the current date. If the account\nexists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from\nthat account with links to image files that contain\nembedded commands for the toolset to execute.\n\nHammerDuke’s use of Twitter and crafted image files\nis reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both OnionDuke\nand MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to\ngenerate Twitter account names and then searched for\nany tweets from those accounts that linked to image\nfiles. In contrast however, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke\nthe linked image files contain embedded malware to be\ndownloaded and executed, rather than instructions.\n\nSimilarly, GeminiDuke may also download image\nfiles, but these would contain embedded additional\nconfiguration information for the toolset itself. Unlike\nHammerDuke however, the URLs for the images\ndownloaded by GeminiDuke are hardcoded in its initial\nconfiguration, rather than retrieved from Twitter.\n\n\n###### 23\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nSummer 2015\n\nHAMMERTOSS, Netduke\n\nHTTP (S), Twitter\n\n   - Backdoor\n\n###### Further reading\n1.

These\nspear-phishing emails range from ones purposely\ndesigned to look like spam messages used to spread\ncommon crimeware and addressed to large numbers of\npeople, to highly targeted emails addressed to only a few\nrecipients (or even just one person) and with content\nthat is highly relevant for the intended recipient(s). In\nsome cases, the Dukes appear to have used previously\ncompromised victims to send new spear-phishing emails\nto other targets.\n\nThe spear-phishing emails used by the Dukes may contain\neither specially-crafted malicious attachments or links to\nURLs hosting the malware. When malicious attachments\nare used, they may either be designed to exploit a\nvulnerability in a popular software assumed to be installed\non the victim’s machine, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe\nReader, or the attachment itself may have its icon and\nfilename obfuscated in such a way that the file does not\nappear to be an executable.\n\nThe only instances which we are aware of where the\nDukes did not use spear-phishing as the initial infection\nvector is with certain OnionDuke variants. These were\ninstead spread using either a malicious Tor node that\nwould trojanize legitimate applications on-the-fly with\nthe OnionDuke toolset, or via torrent files containing\npreviously trojanized versions of legitimate applications.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the Dukes are known to\nsometimes re-infect a victim of one of their malware\ntools with another one of their tools. Examples\ninclude CozyDuke infecting its victims with SeaDuke,\nHammerDuke,or OnionDuke; and CosmicDuke infecting\nits victims with PinchDuke,GeminiDuke or MiniDuke.\n\n\n###### DECOYS\n\nThe Dukes commonly employ decoys with their infection\nvectors. These decoys may be image files, document\nfiles, Adobe Flash videos or similar that are presented to\nthe victim during the infection process in an attempt to\ndistract them from the malicious activity. The contents\nof these decoys range from non-targeted material such\nas videos of television commercials showing monkeys\nat an office, to highly targeted documents with content\ndirectly relevant to the intended recipient such as reports,\ninvitations, or lists of participants to an event.\n\nUsually, the contents of the decoys appear to be taken\nfrom public sources, either by copying publicly accessible\nmaterial such as a news report or by simply repurposing\na legitimate file that has been openly distributed. In\nsome cases however, highly targeted decoys have\nbeen observed using content that does not appear to\nbe publicly available, suggesting that these contents\nmay have been stolen from other victims that had been\ninfected by Duke toolsets.\n\n###### EXPLOITATION OF VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe Dukes have employed exploits both in their infection\nvectors as well as in their malware. We are however only\naware of one instance - the exploitation of CVE-2013-0640\nto deploy MiniDuke - where we believe the exploited\nvulnerability was a zero-day at the time that the group\nacquired the exploit. In all known cases where exploits\nwere employed, we believe the Dukes did not themselves\ndiscover the vulnerabilities or design the original\nexploits; for the exploited zero-day, we believe the Dukes\npurchased the exploit. In all other cases, we believe the\ngroup simply repurposed publicly available exploits or\nproofs of concept.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 26\n\nMap of timezones in Russia; © Eric Muller[ [23]]\nPink: MSK (UTC +3) ; Orange: UTC +4\n\n\n###### ATTRIBUTION AND STATE-SPONSORSHIP\n\n\nAttribution is always a difficult question, but attempting\nto answer it is important in understanding these types of\nthreats and how to defend against them. This paper has\nalready stated that we believe the Dukes to be a Russian\nstate-sponsored cyberespionage operation. To reach\nthis conclusion, we began by analyzing the apparent\nobjectives and motivations of the group.\n\nBased on what we currently know about the targets\nchosen by the Dukes over the past 7 years, they appear to\nhave consistently targeted entities that deal with foreign\npolicy and security policy matters. These targets have\nincluded organizations such as ministries of foreign affairs,\nembassies, senates, parliaments, ministries of defense,\ndefense contractors, and think tanks.\n\nIn one of their more intriguing cases, the Dukes have\nappeared to also target entities involved in the trafficking\nof illegal drugs. Even such targets however appear to be\nconsistent with the overarching theme, given the drug\ntrade’s relevance to security policy. Based on this, we\nare confident in our conclusion that the Dukes’ primary\nmission is the collection of intelligence to support foreign\nand security policy decision-making.\n\nThis naturally leads to the question of state-sponsorship.\nBased on our establishment of the group’s primary\nmission, we believe the main benefactor (or benefactors)\nof their work is a government. But are the Dukes a team\nor a department inside a government agency? An external\ncontractor? A criminal gang selling to the highest bidder?\nA group of tech-savvy patriots? We don’t know.\n\nBased on the length of the Dukes’ activity, our estimate of\nthe amount of resources invested in the operation and the\nfact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we\nbelieve the group to have significant and most critically,\nstable financial backing. The Dukes have consistently\noperated large-scale campaigns against high-profile\ntargets while concurrently engaging in smaller, more\ntargeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no\nevidence of unintentional overlap or operational clashes.\nWe therefore believe the Dukes to be a single, large,\nwell-coordinated organization with clear separation of\nresponsibilities and targets.\n\n\nThe Dukes appear to prioritize the continuation of\ntheir operations over stealth. Their 2015 CozyDuke\nand CloudDuke campaigns take this to the extreme by\napparently opting for speed and quantity over stealth and\nquality. In the most extreme case, the Dukes continued\nwith their July 2015 CloudDuke campaign even after their\nactivity had been outed by multiple security vendors.\nWe therefore believe the Dukes’ primary mission to be\nso valuable to their benefactors that its continuation\noutweighs everything else.\n\nThis apparent disregard for publicity suggests, in our\nopinion, that the benefactors of the Dukes is so powerful\nand so tightly connected to the group that the Dukes are\nable to operate with no apparent fear of repercussions\non getting caught. We believe the only benefactor with\nthe power to offer such comprehensive protection would\nbe the government of the nation from which the group\noperates. We therefore believe the Dukes to work either\nwithin or directly for a government, thus ruling out the\npossibility of a criminal gang or another third party.\n\nThis leaves us with the final question: which country?\nWe are unable to conclusively prove responsibility of\nany specific country for the Dukes. All of the available\nevidence however does in our opinion suggest that the\ngroup operates on behalf of the Russian Federation.\nFurther, we are currently unaware of any evidence\ndisproving this theory.\n\nKaspersky Labs has previously noted the presence of\nRussian-language artefacts in some of the Duke malware\nsamples[ [9]]. We have also found a Russian-language\nerror message in many PinchDuke samples: “Ошибка\nназвания модуля! Название секции данных должно\nбыть 4 байта!” This roughly translates as, “There is an\nerror in the module’s name! The length of the data section\nname must be 4 bytes!”\n\nAdditionally, Kaspersky noted that based on the\ncompilation timestamps, the authors of the Duke malware\nappear to primarily work from Monday to Friday between\nthe times of 6am and 4pm UTC+0 [[11]]. This corresponds\nto working hours between 9am and 7pm in the UTC+3\ntime zone, also known as Moscow Standard Time, which\ncovers, among others, much of western Russia, including\nMoscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 27\n\n\nThe Kaspersky Labs analysis of the Duke malware authors’\nworking times is supported by our own analysis, as well\nas that performed by FireEye [[22]]. This assertion of time\nzone is also supported by timestamps found in many\nGeminiDuke samples, which similarly suggest the group\nwork in the Moscow Standard Time timezone, as further\ndetailed in the section on the technical analysis of\nGeminiDuke (page 17).\n\nFinally, the known targets of the Dukes - Eastern European\nforeign ministries, western think tanks and governmental\norganizations, even Russian-speaking drug dealers conform to publicly-known Russian foreign policy and\nsecurity policy interests. Even though the Dukes appear\nto have targeted governments all over the world, we are\nunaware of them ever targeting the Russian government.\nWhile absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, it is\nan interesting detail to note.\n\nBased on the presented evidence and analysis, we believe,\nwith a high level of confidence, that the Duke toolsets are\nthe product of a single, large, well-resourced organization\n(which we identify as the Dukes) that provides the Russian\ngovernment with intelligence on foreign and security\npolicy matters in exchange for support and protection.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 28\n\n BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n1.
