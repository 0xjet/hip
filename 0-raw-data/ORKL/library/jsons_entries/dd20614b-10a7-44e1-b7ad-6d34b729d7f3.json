Throughout the\nevolution and spread of ransomware, events have shifted from focused targeting, to\nnear indiscriminate wormable propagation, to “big game hunting” of large enterprises\nthrough widespread compromise. Underneath these trends, a space has developed\nwhere state-sponsored, as opposed to criminal, elements can weaponize ransomware (or ransomware-like) functionality.\n\nBeginning with a clumsy monetization effort by North Korea through WannaCry,\nransomware-as-disruptor seemed to establish itself with the NotPetya event taking\nplace only a few months later in 2017. Yet this event, while significantly disruptive\nand harmful, showed immaturity by being too obviously related to disruptive intentions as opposed to financial gain.\n\nA new version of the LockerGoga ransomware impacted Norsk Hydro later. While\nsuperficially similar to other industrial-targeted ransomware events around the\nsame time, the Hydro event incorporated unique disruptive characteristics calling\ninto question whether the attackers ever intended to decrypt systems after infection.\n\nNevertheless, insufficient data exists to adequately disposition Hydro as a state-sponsored disruption event instead of a financially motivated criminal exercise. Given\npoor public-private information sharing due to mistrust and similar friction, combined with perverse financial incentives from lawsuits through denied insurance\nclaims, victims have little reason to come forward with necessary data to disposition\ndisruptive events between criminal ransomware and likely state-sponsored disruption. Only by resolving these issues and providing political and financial security to\nvictims will governments be able to muster not only the cooperation, but even the\ninformation necessary to identify such threats – let alone combat them.\n\n\n## EXECUTIVE\n\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA RANSOMWARE SEVERELY IMPACTED THE NORWE-\n\n\n###### ANTS FOR DISRUPTIVE PURPOSES.\n\n\n-----\n\n# CONTENT\n\n**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** 2\n\n**INTRODUCTION** 4\n\n**REVIEW OF LOCKERGOGA** 6\n\n**THE NORSK HYDRO INCIDENT** 9\n\nEVENT CHARACTERISTICS AND ATTACK PATH\b 10\n\nLOCKERGOGA FUNCTIONALITY DIFFERENCES IN NORSK HYDRO 12\n\nPOSSIBLE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS AND WIDER EVENT TARGETING\b 14\n\nNORSK HYDRO, LOCKERGOGA, AND FIN6 16\n\nLOCKERGOGA SINCE NORSK HYDRO 17\n\nLOCKERGOGA AND MEGACORTEX 19\n\n**RANDOMWARE AS DISRUPTIVE CAPABILITY** 21\n\nNOTPETYA AS RANSOMWARE-LIKE DESTRUCTIVE ATTACK 22\n\nNOTPETYA LESSONS LEARNED AND ATTACKER EVOLUTION 23\n\n**INFORMATION OPERATIONS AND DISRUPTIVE IMPLICATIONS OF**\n**REPURPOSED RANSOMWARE** 26\n\nDENIABLE OPERATIONS BY MIMICKING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY 27\n\nVICTIM REPORTING CONCERNS WITH POSSIBLE STATE-SPONSORED\nINVOLVEMENT 28\n\n**CONCLUSIONS** 30\n\n**APPENDICES** 32\n\nAPPENDIX A: LOCKERGOGA SAMPLES 32\n\nAPPENDIX B: APPROXIMATE RANSOMWARE TIMELINE\b 34\n\n\n-----\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\n###### Ransomware has a surprisingly long history in information security, with the first publicly known instance being a floppy disk-distributed worm provided to AIDS researchers at a World Health Organization conference in 1989.[1]\n\nAfter a lull with some periods of identified activity, like the GPCode virus,[2] ransomware\nreturned to focus with the emergence of CryptoLocker in 2013.[3] In the years since,\nransomware has rapidly proliferated, with over 20 distinct families emerging between\n2013 and 2016.[4] In that time, ransomware grew into one of the most disruptive and\nfinancially-damaging types of computer security events, resulting in not only increas-\ning financial costs but also availability impacts often lasting weeks or months during\nrecovery operations.[5]\n\nA turning point in ransomware arrived in 2017 with the WannaCry outbreak.[6] While\nunprecedented for the sheer speed with which it spread around the globe on release,\nWannaCry is also interesting as it subsequently proved the ransomware was not the\nwork of ordinary criminal, extortion-minded entities. Instead, WannaCry’s origins lay\nwith state-sponsored cyber activity, specifically entities working on behalf of the Dem-\nocratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).[7] Although featuring several functionality\nissues in terms of recovery following a ransom payment,[8] WannaCry at least appeared\nto be designed as a vast monetization scheme in support of DPRK interests – a “first”\ngiven available information.\n\nRansomware moved from a primarily criminal problem to one suddenly involving\nstate-sponsored activity. Such shifts became even more apparent a few months later\nwhen what initially appeared to be a variant of Petya ransomware swept across the\nglobe with even greater disruption than WannaCry.[9] Subsequent investigation, includ-\ning government-sponsored reporting, identified the malware, now known as NotPetya,\nas a wiper masquerading as ransomware with the intention of causing massive, unre-\ncoverable disruption on victim IT systems.[10]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nSince the WannaCry and NotPetya events of 2017, ransomware has continued to rage globally, impacting entities including government agencies, schools, hospitals, and large corporations.\nHowever, the events of 2017 should not be lost even as an ever-greater number of ransomware\nvariants emerge to hold networks hostage for payment. While continued ransomware events indicate monetary success for criminal entities, the two largest outbreaks recorded demonstrate a\nplaybook for non-criminal actors. Ransomware’s disruptive capacity combined with its ubiquity\nmay provide state-sponsored or -controlled entities with a unique, deniable tool to achieve largescale network disruption.\n\nNotPetya’s functionality, as described by multiple researchers, made it apparent the malware ultimately served as a “wiper”, functionally destroying infected machines rather than a true ransomware\nvariant where decryption and recovery is (presumably) possible. NotPetya’s indiscriminate spread,\nbeginning with a supply chain compromise at an accounting software company serving Ukraine\nthen encompassing entities worldwide,[11] resulted in impacts likely far beyond the responsible entity’s desires – including significant impacts in Russia, believed by multiple government and private\nentities to be the likely source of the malware. An adversary paying attention to these events, as\nwell as following the evolution of “typical” ransomware since 2017, could therefore design a less\nvirulent infection method enabling greater control over propagation while avoiding the obviously\ndestructive aspects of NotPetya to embrace legitimate encryption operations. An entity with no\nintention of ever providing or revealing a key can achieve the same functional goal of rendering\nvictim machines unusable and data unrecoverable.\n\nG I V E N T H E C O N T I N U E D W I D E S P R E A D, D I S R U P T I V E N A T U R E O F\nC R I M I N A L R A N S O M W A R E A T T H E T I M E O F T H I S W R I T I N G, A C C U R A T E L Y A N D C O N F I D E N T L Y D E T E C T I N G S U C H A W E A P O N I Z A T I O N\nO F R A N S O M W A R E W O U L D P R O V E D I F F I C U L T I F I T O C C U R R E D, I F\nN O T O U T R I G H T I M P O S S I B L E .\n\n\n###### A NOTE ON METHODOLOGY\n\nThe following analysis relies almost entirely on publicly available reporting and analysis,\nwith only a few exceptions that were sourced from multiple entities. As a result, some\nentities may disagree with analysis or details as a result of having additional, non-pub-\nlic and undisclosed information on events below. Organizations or entities possessing\ndata that can significantly alter or dispute the below analysis are strongly encouraged\nto make available any relevant data to ensure greater accuracy. Since initial coverage\nof LockerGoga in general and the Norsk Hydro event in particular, few parties have\nmade any substantial new information available beyond scattered media interviews and\nhigh-level conference talks, which are all included below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n###### REVIEW OF\n\n# LOCKERGOGA\n\n###### LockerGoga first emerged in January 2019 with a ransomware event at French engineering company Altran Technologies.[12]\n\n\nSubsequent reporting from the French government confirmed that LockerGoga was responsible for the event, while ensuing CERT-FR reporting added additional details.[13] Unlike many other\nransomware variants that possessed some built-in mechanism for self-spreading, LockerGoga\ncontained no such propagation features whatsoever.\n\n\nTable 1: Probable Altran-Related LockerGoga Samples\n\n\nPOSFILE\nSIGNED SIGNER SIBLE\nNAME\nEVENT\n\n\nCOMPILE\nSHA256 SIZE\nTIME\n\n\nFIRST\nOBSERVED\nCOUNTRY\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n\n\n14E8A8095426245633CD6C3440AFC5B29D0C8CD4ACEFD10E16F82EB3295077CA\n\n6E69548B1AE61D951452B65DB15716A5EE2F9373BE05011E897C61118C239A77\n\nBDF36127817413F625D2625D3133760AF724D6AD2410BEA7297DDC116ABC268F\n\n8CFBD38855D2D6033847142FDFA74710B796DAF465AB94216FBBBE85971AEE29\n\n5B0B972713CD8611B04E4673676CDFF70345AC7301B2C23173CDFEAFF564225C\n\n\n1/28/2019 WORK- MIKL COMODO ENCRYPT\n1.21 MB ES ALTRAN\n18:13 ER32 LIMITED RSA ONLY\n\n1/25/2019 WORK- MIKL COMODO ENCRYPT\n1.21 MB NL ALTRAN\n16:30 ER32 LIMITED RSA ONLY\n\n1/23/2019 WORK- MIKL COMODO ENCRYPT\n1.21 MB RO ALTRAN\n22:42 ER32 LIMITED RSA ONLY\n\n1/16/2019 WORK- MIKL COMODO ENCRYPT\n1.22 MB NL ALTRAN\n19:27 ER32 LIMITED RSA ONLY\n\n1/16/2019 WORK- MIKL COMODO ENCRYPT\n1.22 MB RO ALTRAN\n1:23 ER32 LIMITED RSA ONLY\n\n\n-----\n\nInstead of introducing a self-propagating file\ninto the network, the Altran incident involved\nan extensive, interactive breach by an unknown\nentity leveraging publicly and commercially\navailable tools, such as Metasploit, PowerShell\nEmpire, Cobalt Strike, and PSExec, to move\nlaterally through the network. As stated in\nCERT-FR reporting, “Cette exécution est réalisée plusieurs semaines (voire plusieurs mois)\naprès la compromission effective de la cible”\n– essentially, the attackers were in the network weeks or months prior to the execution\nof LockerGoga to prepare for and enable the\nransomware event. While a precise mechanism\nfor distribution was not identified, a combination of scripts and interactive logons appeared\nto disable security tools and prepare for the\nransomware execution within the environment.\n\nThis first sample of LockerGoga associated\nwith a publicly known incident is interesting for\nseveral reasons. First, it is signed with a likely\nfraudulent code signing certificate issued by\nCOMODO (now Sectigo).[14] Although not unique\n\n\nfor malware, signed binaries can assist in\nevading security products or operating system\ncontrols for execution. Second, LockerGoga\nuses the Boost C++ libraries for multiple purposes, including for file renaming, parent-child\nprocess communication, and file deletion routines.[15] Third, actual encryption routines rely\non another publicly-available C++ library called\nCrypto++ instead of native Windows libraries or\ncoded encryption routines.[16] Fourth, after initial\nexecution on a victim host, multiple “worker”\ninstances of the malware are launched which\nthen encrypt files on the host machine. This\nis a cumbersome and high-overhead process,\nbut also one where failure to stop or kill the\n“root” process means defensive software or\ninteractive use will likely fail to halt the encryption routine. Of note given likely spreading\nand installation methodology, the parent-child\nencryption process, which takes more time\nthan other mechanisms, is ideally suited to\nan infection pushed or scheduled after typical\nworking hours like a malicious group policy\nchange or widely-scripted execution event.\n\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nInstead of introducing a self-propagating file for malware, signed binaries can assist in\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nBased on binary strings, encryption appears to target a standard list of document and related file\ntypes ranging from Microsoft Office Word documents to PDF files. However, in practice, LockerGoga encrypts all files outside Program Files and operating system directories. The ransomware\nnote that provides contact instructions to negotiate payment is written last. An overview of LockerGoga’s behavior and execution sequence can be found in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: LockerGoga process flow\n\nWrites ransom note with\n\nRemoves tself from disk, Encrypts files, binaries, communication\n\nLockerGoga launches child etc. outside of instructions after\nExecutes processes %System% encryption\n\ndirectory complete\n\nThe network decryption and negotiation approach represents a slight shift in ransomware, also\nobserved in Ryuk and later ransomware variants. Attackers can work to hold an entire network\nhostage, negotiating for decryption of the entire victim space, rather than providing per-host\ndecryption instructions through a set price and reference to a Bitcoin or related cryptocurrency wallet. LockerGoga (along with the contemporaneous ransomware variant Ryuk) appeared to\ninaugurate an enterprise-targeting shift within ransomware. Items such as payment instructions\nor a wallet ID for cryptocurrency are unnecessary because victims negotiate to unlock their entire\nnetwork with the attackers.\n\n\nRemoves tself from disk,\n\nLockerGoga launches child\nExecutes processes\n\n\nFigure 1: LockerGoga process flow\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THE NORSK\n# HYDRO INCIDENT\n\n###### Following events at Altran, there were no recorded or public sightings of LockerGoga until 19 March 2019 when Norwegian power and aluminum company, Norsk Hydro, faced a crippling cyber attack.[17]\n\nBased on public reporting and continued company updates,\nHydro was able to resume reduced operations by placing\nimpacted industrial and production systems in manual\noperations mode. Hydro reporting did not provide any technical observations or if the attack constituted a ransomware\nevent. Subsequent analysis of publicly available information and sample correlation to company statements later\nindicated the event was the work of LockerGoga, but was a\nvariant that featured additional functionality not observed\nin previous versions.\n\n\n# HYDRO\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n###### EVENT CHARACTERISTICS AND ATTACK PATH\n\nT H E F I R S T D E T A I L E D R E P O R T I N G O N T H E H Y D R O E V E N T C A M E\nV I A I N D E P E N D E N T S E C U R I T Y R E S E A R C H E R S, M O S T N O T A B L Y A\nL E N G T H Y O V E R V I E W F R O M K E V I N B E A U M O N T . [1 8]\n\nFollow-on reporting from the Norwegian CERT indicated LockerGoga spread and execution was\nenabled by a widespread compromise of Hydro’s Windows Active Directory (AD) instance.[19] With\nthis level of compromise, attackers have access and control over the victim’s Windows environment, enabling a host of options including the placement and timing of malware execution\nthroughout the enterprise. Examples of this timing are provided in Figure 2.\n\n\nV I A I N D E P E N D E N T S E C U R I T Y R E S E A R C H E R S, M O S T N O T A B L Y A\n\n\nL E N G T H Y O V E R V I E W F R O M K E V I N B E A U M O N T .\n\n\nAD compromise enables attacker\nto dump all passwords in the\nenvironment.\n\nAttacker is able to facilitate\nunlimited pivoting as a legitimate\nuser.\n\n\nT H E F I R S T D E T A I L E D R E P O R T I N G O N T H E H Y D R O E V E N T C A M E\n\n\nPSExec plus NET commands can\nbe used to move and execute\nmalware via script.\n\nThis works in conjunction with,\nand is enabled by, credential\ncapture.\n\n\nFigure 2: Active Directory Compromise Options\n\n\nThis creates a malicious binary\nor script for deployment via\nGroup Policy Object (GPO).\n\nGPO can be pushed manually or\nscheduled for a specfiic time.\n\n\nPrecisely how the unknown attackers managed\nthis level of penetration was unclear until follow-on reporting in the summer of 2019 from\nmultiple media outlets. It was then revealed\nthat Hydro was initially breached via phishing.\nUnknown entities managed to spoof legitimate\ncommunication with a Hydro customer and\nused this to deliver a malicious attachment\nmatching expected communication with Hydro\nitself.[20] Although superficially similar to techniques such as Business Email Compromise\n\n\n(BEC), the additional inclusion of what is\ndescribed as a forged or modified legitimate\ndocument matching expected communication\nappears different from known BEC activity.\nAdequately dispositioning and evaluating the\nphishing vector is not possible due to a lack\nof technical details and further information.\nSubsequent actions resulted not in the attacker attempting to prompt a wire transfer, but to\nworm their way into Hydro’s network to gain\ncomplete control of the AD environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nAlthough an official time-estimate of how far in advance Hydro was breached before the LockerGoga incident is unknown, estimates range from weeks to months.[21] Previous LockerGoga incidents\nare alleged to have involved extensive use of tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike for lateral\nmovement,[22] but no public evidence emerged from the Hydro event to support this claim. Some\nstatements and conference discussions indicated possible use of Cobalt Strike, but no additional\ntechnical details were provided or are available. Later discussions with several sources indicated\nthe attacker may have used a then-zero day, CVE-2019-0859, as a privilege escalation mechanism\nto enable penetration of the Hydro environment.[23] The attackers were able to widely distribute\nLockerGoga on Windows terminals throughout Hydro for coordinated execution, potentially via a\nmalicious Group Policy Object push, to copy and execute the malware on 19 March 2019.\n\n\nFigure 3: Norsk Hydro LockerGoga Variant Ransom Note\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA FUNCTIONALITY DIFFERENCES IN NORSK HYDRO\n\nWhile the above is superficially similar to how Altran was likely breached and matches subsequent\nreporting on other ransomware families distributed via interactive compromise of a victim’s AD\ninfrastructure,[24] other elements of the Hydro event were different than seen before. Initially noted by researchers at Cisco Talos, the LockerGoga variant most-likely associated with events at\nHydro features additional functionality not found in previous variants,[25] either those identified at\npublicly known incidents or additional samples retrieved from commercial databases of malware\nsamples.[26]\n\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA FUNCTIONALITY\n\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA FUNCTIONALITY\n\n\nPOSFILE\nSIGNED SIGNER SIBLE FUNCTIONALITY\nNAME\nEVENT\n\n\n###### DIFFERENCES IN NORSK HYDRO\n\n\nCOMPILE\nSHA256 SIZE\nTIME\n\n\nTable 2: Probable Norsk Hydro Related LockerGoga Samples\n\n\nFIRST\nOBSERVED\nCOUNTRY\n\n\n65D5DD067E5550867B- 3/18.2019 NORSK\n1.21 MB NO TGYTUTRC ALISA SECTIGO\n532F4E52AF47B320BD31B- 9:07 HYDRO\n\n\n88D149F3E47DC337695D76DA52B25660E3A454768AF0D7E59C913995AF496A0F\n\n\n3/18.2019 NORSK\n1.21 MB NO TGYTUTRC ALISA SECTIGO\n9:07 HYDRO\n\n\nENCRYPT, CHANGE\nACCOUNT PASSWORDS, DISABLE NETWORK\nADAPTER\n\nENCRYPT, CHANGE\nACCOUNT PASSWORDS, DISABLE NETWORK\nADAPTER\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nLockerGoga samples outside of those associated with Hydro followed the same functionality as the\nsamples associated with the Altran event described earlier, focusing on file encryption using multiple processes. The samples associated with Hydro add significant new and disruptive functionality\ndescribed below:\n\n\nLocal user account passwords were\nchanged to a hard-coded value.\n\nLocal administrator account passwords were\nchanged to the same hard-coded value.\n\n\nThe system network card was\ndisabled.\n\nAll logged-in users to a machine\nwere forcibly logged off.\n\n\nAs noted by researchers at Talos, the above adds not only significantly more disruptive aspects to the\nevent but appears also to work at cross-purposes to monetize the infection. The above chain of events\nmeans that systems were not only encrypted, but become inaccessible given changed local passwords\nand lack of network connectivity for remote and domain logons. In this scenario, even viewing the\nransom note associated with the event would require additional work, such as forensically imaging the\nmachine to recover the note from disk or analyzing the malware. This is especially true given that the\nransom note was written at the end of the encryption process, just before local and remote access to\nthe host was removed. While viewing ransom information is certainly possible, such items seem curious and counterproductive for efficient monetization.\n\nFigure 4: LockerGoga Execution Sequence, Norsk Hydro Variant\n\nWrites ransom note with\n\nEncrypts files, binaries,\n\nRemoves tself from disk, communication\n\netc. outside of\n\nLockerGoga launches child instructions after\n\n%System%\n\nExecutes processes encryption\n\ndirectory\n\ncomplete\n\nChanges local user and\n\nLogs off all logged-in Disables system network\n\nadministrator\n\nusers card\n\npasswords\n\nOne possibility based on reporting and available information is that multiple samples of LockerGoga\nwere present in the Hydro environment. Multiple media reports and Hydro press releases included copies of the ransom note dropped by the more disruptive samples indicating these had to be recovered\nsomehow. Multiple versions of LockerGoga may have been active in the Hydro environment simultaneously, including variants similar to the previous types performing encrypt-only operations.\n\nIrrespective of the above multiple variant possibility, reporting on Hydro recovery efforts included a quote\nfrom company personnel about the desire to detect rapid password changes in the environment using an\nunspecified artificial intelligence solution after the LockerGoga event.[27] Based on this observation, a reasonable\nconclusion is that at minimum the more-disruptive LockerGoga variant was definitely active in Hydro’s network.\n\n\nWrites ransom note with\n\nEncrypts files, binaries,\n\ncommunication\n\netc. outside of\n\ninstructions after\n\n%System%\n\nencryption\n\ndirectory\n\ncomplete\n\n\nLogs off all logged-in Disables system network\nusers card\n\n\nWrites ransom note with\n\nRemoves tself from disk, communication\nlaunches child instructions after\nprocesses encryption\n\ncomplete\n\n\nFigure 4: LockerGoga Execution Sequence, Norsk Hydro Variant\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n\n###### POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS AND WIDER EVENT TARGETING\n\nA D D I T I O N A L D E T A I L S E M E R G E D O V E R T H E\nC O U R S E O F 2 0 1 9 C O N C E R N I N G T H E H Y D R O\nE V E N T T H A T C A S T F U R T H E R U N C E R T A I N T Y\nO N E V E N T S .\n\n\nE V E N T T H A T C A S T F U R T H E R U N C E R T A I N T Y\n\n\nA D D I T I O N A L D E T A I L S E M E R G E D O V E R T H E\n\n\nFirst and immediately obvious,\nthe attack itself took place the\nday after Hydro announced\nits existing CEO was stepping\ndown to be replaced by an\ninternal candidate.[28] Although\na review of the announcement indicates the change in\nleadership would be effective\nseveral months later, the timing is nonetheless suspicious.\nOne possibility is an attacker\ncould view the announcement\nas indicating a shakeup of\ninternal leadership (oblivious\nto the future change-over date)\nand thus an attack coinciding\nwith the announcement could\ntake advantage of perceived\nunsettled communications\nand unclear leadership to maximize disruption.\n\nReporting in the summer of\n2019 revealed additional institutions were also targeted by\nthe same entity responsible\nfor the Hydro incident.[29] As\n\n\nC O U R S E O F 2 0 1 9 C O N C E R N I N G T H E H Y D R O\n\n\none would expect a criminal\ngang intent on monetizing\nits ransomware capability to\ncontinue activity, subsequent\ndetails on timing and possible\ngeographic focus made circumstances appear different.\nNorwegian reporting indicated\nthat multiple Norwegian companies were targeted by the\nsame entity responsible for\nthe Hydro event, and that these\nentities were able to thwart the\nattackers based on quick information sharing from Hydro\nwith Norwegian authorities.[30]\nPress reporting is unclear as\nto whether entities outside\nNorway were also targeted\n\n\nwith the disruptive LockerGoga\nvariant. Specific timing of any\nfollow-on attacks and questions surrounding subsequent\nactivities planned together or\nseparate from events at Hydro\nare also lacking.\n\nThe fact that ransomware\ninfections are on the rise and\nincreasingly disruptive is no\nsurprise. Subsequent media\nreporting indicates multiple\nefforts in the European Union to\nidentify and prosecute entities\nresponsible for recent ransomware events against multiple\nindustrial institutions.[31] The\npossibility the disruptive variant of LockerGoga was used\nspecifically against multiple Norwegian businesses\nroughly simultaneously with\nthe Hydro event is concerning. First, such intrusions are\nrelatively labor-intensive and\nrequire entities to compromise\nentire networks to achieve full\nAD compromise for malware\ndistribution. This indicates a\nwell-resourced team able to\nexecute multiple compromises simultaneously.\n\n\nNorway were also targeted es simultaneously.\n\n[29] As\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nSecond, if all the entities involved were targeted by a group utilizing the same version of LockerGoga, the potential for economic disruption within Norway (or any similarly-sized economy) would\nbe quite significant.\n\nBased on this information, the LockerGoga variant deployed at Norsk Hydro, and potentially also\ndeployed against other companies in Norway, looks very suspicious. The capability to render victim networks functionally unusable means the possibility for cascading economic shock is high.\nExecuted in multiple commercial environments, industrial or otherwise, such a ransomware incident could grind an economy to a halt provided it impacted a sufficient number of organizations.\nIn the case of Norway specifically, where a large part of economic activity (especially in the form\nof exports) is tied to extractive and manufacturing industries represented by a relatively small\nnumber of firms,[32] disruption at only a few of these entities could result in profound economic\nconsequences.\n\nThe Norsk Hydro-associated LockerGoga variant, if also targeting additional entities in the Norwegian economy, evolves from a critical concern for a single company to an item of near-existential\nrisk for an entire country. Absent firm details on additional, potential victims of the disruptive\nLockerGoga variant make a definitive assessment impossible. Yet the possibility of essentially\ncrippling a country through perceived criminal tools while avoiding collateral and unintended damage, as with NotPetya, represents a profound learning opportunity for malicious actors.\n\nTwo U.S. chemical companies also were identified as LockerGoga victims just prior to the events\nat Hydro: Hexion and Momentive.[33] The intrusions at these chemical companies appeared to identify a theme in LockerGoga events, with a focus on various industrial enterprises. While public\ndisclosure of events at Hexion and Momentive occurred after the Hydro incident became known,\nall evidence and reporting indicate the two chemical companies were affected prior to Hydro\nbetween 9 and 12 May 2019. Furthermore, the malware samples most likely associated with these\ncompanies feature the same characteristics as the earlier Altran event, and do not include the\nadditional disruptive features identified at Hydro. As a result, these events appear to be noticeably\ndifferent from the Hydro incident.\n\n\nTable 3: LockerGoga Samples Possibly Associated with U.S. Chemical Company Events\n\n\nCOMPILE\nSHA256 SIZE\nTIME\n\n\nFIRST\nOBSERVED\nCOUNTRY\n\n\nFILE POSSIBLE\nSIGNED SIGNER\nNAME EVENT\n\n\n7BCD69B3085126F7E97406889F78AB74E87230C11812B79406D723A80C08DD26\n\nBA15C27F26265F4B063B65654E9D7C248D0D651919FAFB68CB4765D1E057F93F\n\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n\nENCRYPT\nONLY\n\nENCRYPT\nONLY\n\n\n3/9/2019 SECTI1.19 MB NL ZZBDRIMP ALISA\n17:50 GO\n\n3/9/2019 IMTVKN- SECTI1.19 MB CA ALISA\n17:48 QQ GO\n\n\nHEXION OR\nMOMENTIVE\n\nHEXION OR\nMOMENTIVE\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n###### NORSK HYDRO, LOCKERGOGA, AND FIN6\n\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA, AND FIN6\n\n\nA P P R O X I M A T E L Y O N E M O N T H\nA F T E R T H E H Y D R O E V E N T,\nI N D I C A T I O N S E M E R G E D T H A T\nL O C K E R G O G A I N T R U S I O N S\nM I G H T B E T I E D T O A S I N G L E\nE N T I T Y, F I R E E Y E - D E S I G N A T E D F I N 6, A L S O R E S P O N S I B L E\nF O R S O M E R Y U K R A N S O M W A R E\nE V E N T S .

The ransomware family\nemerged in January 2019 with the Altran event then largely disappeared after the Norsk Hydro\nevent in March 2019. Additional samples of LockerGoga have appeared in various repositories, but\nin all cases seem to be researcher modifications to existing samples and do not appear linked to\nany publicly known ransomware incident. While ransomware families are quite fluid, their function\nas monetizing instruments mean they typically persist for longer than a few months. Looking\nat LockerGoga specifically, there is an easily-observable development lifecycle and versioning\nreflected in the binaries from pre-Altran through Norsk Hydro, shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Observed LockerGoga Versions\n\nLOCKERGOGA VERSION NUMBER FIRST OBSERVED COMPILATION TIME FUNCTION\n\n0.9.9.0 05 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.0.1.0 16 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.0.2.0 16 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.1.0.0 23 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.1.1.0 25 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.2.0.0 03 FEBRUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.3.2.0 02 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.4.4.0 09 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.4.4.1 10 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\nENCRYPT, CHANGE PASSWORDS, DISABLE\n1.5.1.0 18 MARCH 2019\nNETWORK ADAPTERS, LOGOFF USERS\n\nLockerGoga featured a very active development period from January through March 2019.

The dramatic\nchange in functionality from the 1.4 versions to the 1.5 variant at Hydro indicated a significant shift\nin intention and capability after several months of the malware focusing exclusively on encryption\noperations.\n\nFrom an economic and resource-focused view, a criminal or related entity investing development\nresources into designing and deploying a new type of ransomware would presumably desire to\ndraw as much value from that malware as possible. This is observed in the long lifecycles in\nalmost every major ransomware variant, as described in Appendix B of this document.\n\n\nreflected in the binaries from pre-Altran through Norsk Hydro, shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Observed LockerGoga Versions\n\nLOCKERGOGA VERSION NUMBER FIRST OBSERVED COMPILATION TIME FUNCTION\n\n0.9.9.0 05 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.0.1.0 16 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.0.2.0 16 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.1.0.0 23 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.1.1.0 25 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.2.0.0 03 FEBRUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.3.2.0 02 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.4.4.0 09 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.4.4.1 10 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\nENCRYPT, CHANGE PASSWORDS, DISABLE\n1.5.1.0 18 MARCH 2019\nNETWORK ADAPTERS, LOGOFF USERS\n\nLockerGoga featured a very active development period from January through March 2019.

In this respect, LockerGoga would appear to have a poor success rate in\ngenerating funds, and since it disappeared so suddenly appears inefficient from a monetization\nperspective. Given all this information, and the sudden shift from versions performing fairly nondescript network encryption operations to the more disruptive malware involved at Hydro, the\nevolution of available LockerGoga samples indicates a tool that was potentially modified for onetime, spectacular disruptive purposes before being retired.\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA AND MEGACORTEX\n\nO N E P O S S I B I L I T Y B E H I N D L O C K E R G O G A ’ S S U D D E N R I S E A N D\nE Q U A L L Y S U D D E N D I S A P P E A R A N C E I S T H A T T H E E N T I T Y B E H I N D\nT H E M A L W A R E S I M P L Y E V O L V E D O R M O D I F I E D C A P A B I L I T I E S,\nE S P E C I A L L Y A F T E R A V E R Y H I G H - P R O F I L E E V E N T S U C H A S N O R S K\nH Y D R O .\n\n\n###### LOCKERGOGA AND MEGACORTEX\n\n\nT H E M A L W A R E S I M P L Y E V O L V E D O R M O D I F I E D C A P A B I L I T I E S,\n\n\nO N E P O S S I B I L I T Y B E H I N D L O C K E R G O G A ’ S S U D D E N R I S E A N D\n\n\nH Y D R O .\n\n\nThis theory is supported by media reporting in\nMay 2019 that identified unusual links between\nLockerGoga and a newly-emerged ransomware\nfamily called MegaCortex.[39] Links between the\ntwo focus on support items, specifically similar batch files for security process and related\nprocess kill actions, and a shared IP address\nidentified in compromises. As noted in the\npublic technical report by researchers from\nSophos, the IP address in question is associated with multiple, unspecified malware activity\nand is not a definitive indicator of links given\nwidespread use.[40] Other observables, such as\nboth malware families using Boost libraries\n(although MegaCortex appears to only use\nBoost for inter-process communication, while\nLockerGoga relies on Boost for additional file\n\n\nE Q U A L L Y S U D D E N D I S A P P E A R A N C E I S T H A T T H E E N T I T Y B E H I N D\n\n\nmodification purposes) and parent-child process behavior can be seen as coincidences,\nand are noted as such by Sophos.\n\nWhile there are superficial similarities between\nthe malware families, and they have been referenced together in public alerts on ransomware\nactivity,[41] available evidence supports only a\ntangential connection at best between the two.\nGiven “core” LockerGoga functionality emerged\nin January 2019 while MegaCortex first came\nto light in May 2019, it is very possible that\nMegaCortex’s design is based off review and\nanalysis of LockerGoga functionality following\nthe Altran event. Additionally, MegaCortex has\nnot displayed the disruptive capabilities associated with the LockerGoga variant involved in\nthe Hydro incident.\n\n\nE S P E C I A L L Y A F T E R A V E R Y H I G H - P R O F I L E E V E N T S U C H A S N O R S K\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nOne final consideration on this topic concerns\na new variant of MegaCortex from summer\n2019,[42] and a further variant of this malware\ncalled “EKANS” from December 2019.[43] In both\ncases, observed malware featured an extensive list of processes to terminate as part of\nthe encryption process. While most of the\nprocesses identified in the MegaCortex variant were security products, a subset related to\nindustrial control system (ICS) software existed within the binary. This subset was ported\ntogether with the later EKANS variant. While\nsome reporting around EKANS highlighted this\nevent as a possible state-sponsored disruptive\nevent,[44] all available evidence and malware\nfunctionality strongly suggest otherwise.[45]\n\nWhile the two malware variants target processes for termination, the most likely explanation\nfor doing so is to free files “locked” by them\nto further spread encryption of vital resources.\nThe targeted processes focus on data storage,\nanalysis platforms, and licensing servers, and\nappear to support this conclusion. While the\nransomware encrypts significant portions of\nthe victim machine, it does not perform disruptive actions like password changes and network\ncard disabling associated with LockerGoga, or\nthe filesystem encryption activity from NotPetya (discussed in detail below). These items\nappear to represent an evolution in likely criminal ransomware development, as opposed to\na potential disruptive capability masquerading\nas such.\n\n\nIn both\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RANSOMWARE AS\n\n# DISRUPTIVE CAPABILITY\n\n###### Typically, IT-focused destructive activity centers on wiper malware. One of the most obvious examples of such malware is the Shamoon incident impacting the IT network of Saudi Aramco in 2012.[46]\n\n\nMultiple rounds of disruptive malware have\nfollowed,[47] from follow-on Shamoon variants\nto the use of KillDisk in the 2015 Ukraine power event.[48] Yet in all these cases, the intention\nof the malware involved is clear based on\ntechnical analysis: to irrevocably wipe and\nrender IT systems unusable within the victim\nenvironment. These events can be clearly dispositioned as the actions of an entity motivated\nby reasons other than financial gain, whether\nstate-sponsored geopolitical activity or potentially, although never proven in actual events,\na politically motivated independent actor (e.g.,\n“hacktivist”). The fingerprints for a wiper make\nassessing adversary intent, and given other\nobservables, adversary identity somewhat\nclear.\n\nMore discrete tools and capabilities exist to\ndeliver an equivalent impact while keeping\n\n\noverall matters of intent, attribution, and perceived purpose murky. A ransomware event\nthat encrypts an entire network and disables\nkey functionality, provided the encryption\nschema is sound and not vulnerable to brute\nforce or other attacks, delivers essentially\nthe same impact as a network-wide wiper, in\nthat systems are unusable and near impossible to recover. Such an event blends into an\nincreasingly murky market of multiple actors\ndeploying ransomware variants for perceived\ncriminal gain. Even if the encryption mechanism proves faulty (in terms of file recovery),\nan actor attempting to “hide” a disruptive attack\nthrough ransomware can still blend in with similarly botched encryption implementations to\nmake their irrecoverable file encryption appear\na mistake as opposed to a deliberate action at\nmaking systems inaccessible.[49]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nFigure 7: Ransomware-as-Disruptor Possible Attack Sequence\n\nUtilize or modify Add additional disruptive Deploy in targeted fashion Intention of never disclosing\nransomware variant impacts to inhibit to avoid over-spread, key or responding to\nwith strong recovery, maximize collateral damage ransom negotiations\nencryption dislocation perpetuates\nmechanism disruption\n\n###### NOTPETYA AS RANSOMWARE-LIKE DESTRUCTIVE ATTACK\n\nNotPetya emerged as an especially virulent, widespread\nsystem encryption event months after WannaCry. Closer\nexamination of NotPetya – from its initial delivery mechanism through its specific actions on victim systems\n– revealed a murkier picture indicating the malware was\ndesigned not as a tool for monetization, but rather a mechanism to render victim systems unusable.\n\nThe disruptive NotPetya worm has its origins in a ransomware variant that emerged in 2016 called Petya. Unlike\nother ransomware variants, Petya overwrites the victim\nmachine’s Master Boot Record (MBR) and encrypts the\nMaster File Table (MFT), making the system functionally\nunusable without decryption.[50] While a concerning development in ransomware, actual implementation was faulty\nand led researchers to successfully identify ways to recover impacted systems without paying the ransom.[51]\n\n\nUtilize or modify Add additional disruptive\nransomware variant impacts to inhibit\nwith strong recovery, maximize\nencryption dislocation\nmechanism\n\n\n###### DESTRUCTIVE ATTACK\n\n\n###### NOTPETYA AS\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n\nA new strain of Petya, subsequently referred\nto as “NotPetya” given dramatically different\nintentions, emerged on 27 June 2017 and rapidly spread worldwide.[52] As noted previously,\nNotPetya appeared to start as a targeted attack\non Ukrainian organizations given initial infection via a malicious update to Ukraine-specific\naccounting software. Using a combination of\nboth the MS17-010 vulnerability (and accompanying EternalBlue exploit) and dynamic\ncredential capture and re-use,[53] it spread globally quickly beyond its likely intended area of\noperations. As a result, NotPetya impacted\nentities likely beyond adversary intent – including significant impacts on Russian enterprises\nsuch as Rosneft, Evraz, and Sberbank.[54] Given\nsubsequent attribution by multiple entities that\nthe NotPetya attack originated with Russian\nstate interests,[55] it would appear the malware\nspread almost too effectively resulting in\ndomestic damage for its perpetrators.\n\n\nYet this last point underscores several interesting observations about NotPetya’s alterations\nfrom its predecessor. In addition to incorporating virulent self-propagating mechanisms,\nNotPetya’s encryption routine simply does not\nallow for recovery. As noted by researchers at\nKaspersky and Matt Suiche of Comae, NotPetya generates the infection victim identifier\n– critical for determining the right decryption\nkey – by creating random data.[56] Attackers\nwould never be able to derive or recover the\ndecryption key to unlock an infected system (or\nnetwork), even if payment is made. NotPetya\neffectively “wipes” systems due to the combination of MBR/MFT attack (rendering the\nsystem inaccessible) and is intended to be a\none-way encryption routine with no recovery.\n\n###### ATTACKERS ESSENTIALLY LOCKED SYSTEMS, THEN THREW AWAY THE KEY.\n\n\n###### SYSTEMS, THEN THREW AWAY THE\n\n\n###### KEY.\n\n\n###### NOTPETYA LESSONS LEARNED AND ATTACKER EVOLUTION\n\nDeploying ransomware (or ransomware-like functionality) without ever intending victim recovery\npresents a case where attackers can muddy reporting and potentially deflect blame while still executing devastating attacks. As noted by Matt Suiche, “The fact of pretending to be a ransomware\nwhile being in fact a nation state attack — especially since WannaCry proved that widely spread\nransomware are [not] financially profitable — is in our opinion a very subtle way from the attacker\nto control the narrative of the attack.”[57]\n\nAt least initially, and especially emerging relatively soon after the global WannaCry outbreak, the\ndesired narrative of highly virulent criminal ransomware seemed to hold. Technical analysis such\nas that mentioned above began to poke holes in this initial understanding with ultimate public\nattribution by several governments that NotPetya was a Russian destructive attack focused on\nUkraine, ultimately settling nearly all reasonable debate.\n\n\n###### NOTPETYA LESSONS LEARNED\n\n\n###### ATTACKERS ESSENTIALLY LOCKED\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nYet there were several problems with how NotPetya worked, especially since the desired story\nfailed to hold over time. What appeared to be a Ukraine-centric event given the focus on the\nMEDoc accounting software as initial infection vector quickly became a globally disruptive phenomenon.[58] That the malware spread to key Russian companies was probably the least significant\nconcern for a Russian-sponsored disruptive event, as cascading disruptions in Europe and the\nU.S. could have led to some degree of retaliation – a possibility since echoed in public comments\nby NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.[59]\n\nNotPetya appeared to have the following failings:\n\n1. The encryption routine and related processes destroyed any plausibility that the event\ncould be construed as criminally motivated ransomware.\n2. The attack was too effective in spreading, resulting in significant impacts outside the\nintended target (Ukraine), but hitting domestic (Russian) organizations and entities that\nmight retaliate (U.S., Europe) as well.\n\nThe idea presented by NotPetya would be quite enticing to an adversary; the ability to execute\na potentially crippling disruptive attack against an entity while severely undermining any ability\nto publicly identify the true responsible party. With adjustments in disabling methodology and\nspreading mechanisms, a more effective and controlled attack could be possible.\n\nThe evolution of ransomware after the NotPetya event provided many of the elements\nnecessary to meet these goals. From a propagation standpoint, ransomware authors and\nthose deploying such malware in many cases\nshifted network compromise from the use of\nself-spreading tools to more deliberate, interactive compromise of victim environments.\nThis trend is observed in the “big game\nhunting” type of intrusions associated with\nRyuk, LockerGoga, and MegaCortex (among\nothers), where attackers compromise the\nnetwork then use the resulting access to\nseed ransomware for future coordinated\nexecution.[60] The shift from per-host victim\nencryption to per-network encryption schemas where entire organizations are impacted\nprovides a means to achieve widespread disruption without having to “fake” the existence\nof a decryption mechanism.\n\n\nspreading mechanisms, a more effective and controlled attack could be possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n\nAn attacker wishing to replicate the idea of\nNotPetya, but more effectively with greater\ncontrol, could therefore breach the networks\nof organizations of interest in advance, seed\nthese networks with ransomware that is somewhat more disruptive than normal (but not\nexceptionally so), and then simply “throw away\nthe key” after execution. If cryptographically\nsound methods are used to deliver the attack,\nthe possibility of recovery outside of complete\nsystem rebuild is very small. Given previous\nanalysis and cited research above, the scenario\nof a more controlled, better implemented NotPetya begins to look close to something like\nthe Norsk Hydro event and its unique variant of\nLockerGoga ransomware.\n\n\nAlthough impossible to prove, an evaluation\nof publicly available data and related malware\nsamples shows Norsk Hydro to be uniquely suited to follow a targeted and effective\nNotPetya model. When combined with other\nobservations, such as potentially more widespread targeting of Norwegian companies, the\nsituation becomes a part of a reasonably contained but locally widespread disruptive event.\nAvailable evidence cannot effectively disposition events toward either criminal activity or\nstate-sponsored disruption, but given observations and the analysis above, the Hydro event\nat minimum provides an interesting and worryingly effective blueprint to state-sponsored\nentities on how to leverage seemingly criminal\nactivity for disruptive purposes.\n\n\nFigure 8: NotPetya Failures and Limitations\n```\n                                  ENCRYPTION BEHAVIOR\n\n```\nNotPetya easily identified as a non-functioning ransomware sample\n\nNo plausible deniability due to no monetization capacity\n```\n                                  MALWARE PROPAGATION\n\n```\nNotPetya almost certainly spread too far:\n\n                                                        - Impacted Russian entities\n\n                                                     - Spread to U.S., NATO members\n\nGreater control and direction needed to avoid collateral, unintended damage\n```\n                                  MESSAGING\n\n```\nIntention ambiguity between criminal or wiper failed due to encryption implementation\n\nSpread beyond Ukraine, limited focus as a Ukraine-specific event\n\nAn attacker wishing to replicate the idea of Although impossible to prove, an evaluation\nNotPetya, but more effectively with greater of publicly available data and related malware\ncontrol, could therefore breach the networks samples shows Norsk Hydro to be unique-\nof organizations of interest in advance, seed ly suited to follow a targeted and effective\nthese networks with ransomware that is some- NotPetya model. When combined with other\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INFORMATION OPERATIONS AND DISRUPTIVE IMPLICATIONS OF\n\n# REPURPOSED RANSOMWARE\n\n###### While NotPetya was certainly disruptive, it also represented a very blunt tool.\n\n\nWidely targeted and quickly revealed as something other than criminal malware, it caused\ngreat damage but failed to take advantage\nof potential misdirection and misinformation\nitems tied to its masquerade as ransomware.\nWith some modifications, which coincidentally\nadhere closely to the evolution of the overall\ncriminal ransomware environment, this activity can rapidly shift into a targeted, effective\ndisruption mechanism. We typically examine\ncyber weapons through the lens of very complex, highly targeted examples such as Stuxnet.\nMalware is a tool to obtain an objective, and\nwhen combined with concerns over attribution (and potential retaliation), an attack that is\nminimally complex while avoiding assignment\nof blame can be quite effective in achieving an\nattacker’s goals.\n\n\nRepurposed ransomware offers an avenue to\nmeet these objectives. The degree of alterations\ncan be relatively minimal, requiring alterations\nto encrypt or disable systems (such as NotPetya’s MBR/MFT capability, or the Hydro\nLockerGoga variant’s forced after disabling\nnetwork connectivity and changing credentials)\nto achieve disruptive goals. Another key point\nis access to software, especially source code,\nto facilitate modification while adhering closely\nto the profile of known, existing ransomware\nfamilies. The relationships between criminal\nelements and state-sponsored cyber entities\nare close in many environments,[61] facilitating\nknowledge and capability transfer from criminal spaces for repurposing by state interests.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n###### DENIABLE OPERATIONS BY MIMICKING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY\n\nThe field of cyberwarfare remains immature with still-fluid norms. As campaigns become more\nharmful and more brazen, governments are increasingly willing to publicly condemn attackers and\nimpose a degree of cost on entities. Most consequences focus on legal remedies such as indictments or sanctions.[62] While legal approaches seldom result in actual arrests, although there are\nexceptions, the increasing willingness to issue significant punishments in terms of commercial\nrestrictions or access to markets through sanctions has noticeable costs. Except entities completely divorced from the international system, like DPRK, sanctions have meaning. Avoiding them\nis preferential to having to deal with their consequences.\n\nFor disruptive operations outside of established or recognized conflict zones (such as Ukraine\nor the Gulf region), there is significant value in being able to generate enough uncertainty to\navoid legalistic attribution. Repurposing already-disruptive criminal malware for disruptive means\nprovides a simple and cheap avenue for doing so. Combined with institutional and cultural considerations around reporting and identification (discussed below), a state-sponsored or directed\nentity could launch an attack as effective as any of the Shamoon events while hiding behind the\nfaçade of possible criminal ransomware activity.\n\nFigure 9: Ransomware-as-Wiper Requirements Aside from avoiding obvious international\ncriticism for the use of cyberattacks to disrupt civilian or commercial infrastructure,\nthis approach also broadens the scope of\n\nEncryption\nmechanism must areas where attacks can be used with relabe sound, plausible tive impunity. For example, the various rounds\n\nof Russian-linked disruptive cyber activity in\n\nImplementation Ukraine, from two electric sector events to\nmeans decryption and\nrecovery is theoretically multiple additional campaigns, has resulted\npossible, even if in no noticeable consequence to Russia.[63]\nunintended\n\nAlthough better resourced and arguably more\nstrategically valuable, the same can be said for\n\nRansomwareas-Wiper multiple rounds of wiper malware impacting\n\nIncorporate\n\nRequirement additional disruptive the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, likely from Iranian\n\ncapabilities (account entities, since the original Shamoon event.

Several items enter consideration at this\nstage, including continuing tension between private or commercial sector network defense and\ngovernment interest in having access to incident data for investigation. Organizations may publicly\ndeclare willingness to work with governmental partners, but when such cooperation comes with\npotential risks of leaks, disclosures, or impacts to reputation (or to perception in potentially important markets, such as those of the likely perpetrators of intrusion activity), the cooperation may be\nvery shallow or effectively non-existent.\n\nIn a disruptive cyber event, additional perverse incentives exist that provide further room for\nmalicious actors to hide their activities. A disruptive event by its very nature entails widespread\ndislocation of everyday business practices. Recovery operations take primary importance as\nimpacted firms lose thousands (or millions) of dollars for each hour systems are unavailable. Given\nthe trend toward network-wide, simultaneous encryption events in the criminal market, mirrored\nactivity by state-sponsored entities mean similar challenges in attempting to perform meticulous,\ndetailed forensic analysis and evidence recovery when the primary goal of the business is service\nrestoration. Malicious behaviors and potential subtle differences between known criminal entities\nand other parties, can become masked or destroyed as systems are wiped, rebuilt, and restored\nas quickly as possible.\n\n\n###### VICTIM REPORTING CONCERNS\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\n\nThis is a common tension in computer network\ndefense operations and is not unique. The implications of having, acknowledging, or admitting\nto a disruptive event emerging from state-directed or related activity can be turbulent.\nOne especially interesting legal development\nin the aftermath of NotPetya concerned cyber\ninsurance claims. While recovering from this\ndisruptive event, pharmaceutical giant Merck,\nfood products manufacturer Mondelez, and\nother entities attempted to recoup losses via\ninsurance policies which included coverage for\ncyber events. All claims were denied due to “act\nof war” provisions in the policies exempting\nsuch actions from coverage.[64]\n\nIn NotPetya-related cases, information enabled\ninsurance companies to invoke war exemptions in policies derived from government\nreporting and condemnation of the event as a\nRussia-directed effort. As explained previously, the NotPetya attack was almost certainly\nmore widespread and damaging than intended,\nthus producing conditions prompting a firm,\nunequivocal response from impacted governments (even if only of the “name and shame”\nvariety). More targeted events, such as a theoretical Norsk Hydro scenario where a company\nis impacted by a more deliberate event that\nalso appears to be actual ransomware, avoids\nthe massive impacts prompting government\nresponse. Given the limited scope of the event,\nany emerging information sharing would have\nto come from the impacted party itself or\nthose responding to events on their behalf (all\nof whom are likely under strict nondisclosure\nagreements). In this environment, if a company\nhas even the slightest thought that circumstances were brought about by a possible\nstate-sponsored attack, financial incentives\nwould argue for sharing as little technical and\n\n\nrelated information as possible that could be\nused to make such a case of state-sponsored\nattribution publicly. In observed NotPetya\ninsurance claims, the potential costs to victims\nranged from the hundreds of millions to billions\nof dollars.\n\nWhile available reporting from LockerGoga\nand other ransomware events in Europe stress\nsignificant law enforcement involvement in\nattempting to identify perpetrators behind incidents, an ecosystem with financial incentives\neffectively penalizing companies for sharing\ninformation about their disruptions will lead to\nsuboptimal results. When taken into consideration with existing concerns, such as the threat\nof lawsuits for negligence, failure to protect\nshareholder value, or damages from impacted customers or clients,[65] organizations are\nstrongly incentivized to share as little information as possible.\n\nWithin this landscape, the necessary information to identify what appears at first glance\nto be another ransomware event is denied to\nthose able to make such judgments. This set of\nperverse incentives due to financial penalties\nor losses means a potential state-sponsored\nor directed actor has significant space to operate directly in view of government authorities\n(or commercial security vendors) charged\nwith safeguarding entities under their control\nor protection. Without significant changes in\nregulation, legal risk, and insurance language,\nprivate sector entities (who also control large\namounts of critical infrastructure, to say nothing\nof overwhelming economic footprints) facing a\ntargeted “wiper-as-ransomware” will have little\nreason to be cooperative or forthcoming with\nanything other than superficially useful data.\nThe result is a poorer, less secure landscape\nfor all organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CONCLUSIONS\n\nT H E N O R S K H Y D R O R A N S O M W A R E E V E N T\nA P P E A R S A T O N C E B O T H S T R A I G H T F O R W A R D A N D I N C R E D I B L Y C U R I O U S .\n\n\nimplemented encryption functionality and over-zealous\npropagation made this event\nrelatively easy to attribute to\nits state-based roots.\n\nAs ransomware has evolved\nfrom wildly propagating\nhost-specific infections to more\ndeliberate network compromise, malicious state-directed\nentities now have a new and\nvaluable option for future\ndisruptive operations. The\ncombination of efficacy\n(when properly implemented),\ndeniability (due to continued\nwidespread criminal activity),\nand specificity (as self-propagation gives way to precise\nnetwork compromise) enables\nselective and controlled\ntargeting of entities for disruption and effective IT-based\ndestruction.\n\n\nimplemented encryption func\n\nT H E N O R S K H Y D R O R A N S O M W A R E E V E N T\n\n\nW A R D A N D I N C R E D I B L Y C U R I O U S .\n\n\nWhile insufficient evidence\nexists to definitively determine\nthat the Hydro event was truly a disruptive attack instead\nof another (if spectacular)\nransomware event, details\nshowcase items that forecast\npotential developments in the\nfield of cyberwarfare.\n\nThe combination of a modification of existing ransomware,\nincreased disruptive impacts\nfrom such malware, and targeting and timing specification\nprovide a blueprint for how a\n\n\n##### CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nstate-directed adversary could\nutilize criminal tooling to execute deniable, but effective,\ndisruptive operations.\n\nWhile ransomware rages on\nthrough new families and an\nincreasing array of victims, the\nsheer volume of such activity provides ample space for\nentities not focused on monetary gain to operate with more\nnefarious intentions. NotPetya\nmay have served as an initial example of such activity,\nbut a combination of poorly\n\n\nA P P E A R S A T O N C E B O T H S T R A I G H T F O R -\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED**\n\nWhile examples beyond NotPetya remain speculative,\ncases such as Norsk Hydro provide possibilities that\nadversaries can (and will) learn from, meaning defenders\nand policymakers must similarly pay close attention to\nsuch events. Current frameworks for responding to disruptive intrusion events that appear to be merely “criminal”\npush most responsibility to victims (and their incident\nresponse retainer vendors). Subsequent investigation\nunder a law enforcement aegis means state-sponsored\nand directed elements have significant space, both technically and bureaucratically, to operate unimpeded given\nslow timelines, inadequate evidence collection, and disincentives towards unrestricted sharing of vital data.\n\nTo counter the risk of adversaries becoming savvier and\nthe possibilities of masquerading as criminal entities for\ndestructive purposes, a rethink is required in how network defense, information sharing, and cost sharing are\nconducted. First, defenders must move from a position\nwhere criminal and state-directed intrusion activity are\nbifurcated and instead recognize a continuum of behaviors and actions where the two can blend together for\nambiguous results. Second, based on this recognition\nof indeterminate boundaries between criminal and state\nactivity, organizations should be incentivized to share\nwithin trusted parties and relationships as much information about incidents and intrusions as possible, so as to\nfacilitate the identification of trends and patterns indicative of coordinated operations associated with widespread\ndisruptive campaigns. Lastly, current economic models\ndo not accurately capture risk or correctly reward behaviors necessary for responding to an environment where\ncriminal and state entities can blend together in action\nand immediate impact. Reforming such systems, providing alternative means of support for companies suffering\nfrom widespread network intrusion ransomware events,\nand using these changes to build more robust defense\nand detection will repel both criminal and state-nexus\nentities and produce a more robust security ecosystem\nfor all involved stakeholders.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA
