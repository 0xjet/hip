This ransom\nnote contains a link to the TOR payment site and a unique victim ID used to login to the\nsite.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avaddon Ransom Note**\n\n**(Click to enlarge)**\nThis TOR payment site includes the ransom amount, which in our cause was $900, and\ninstructions on how to pay for a decryptor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avaddon TOR payment site**\nOther sections of the TOR site include a support chat, free test decryption, and a help page\nillustrated by Harry Potter characters.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avaddon TOR help page**\n[Unfortunately, ID-Ransomware creator Michael Gillespie has analyzed the ransomware and](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nstated that it is secure and cannot be decrypted for free.\n\n## More to come\n\nIn advertisements posted to Russian-speaking hacker forums at the beginning of the month,\nAvaddon has stated that they are a new Ransomware-as-an-Affiliate (RaaS) program.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avaddon advertisement on dark web**\nA RaaS program is when the ransomware creator is responsible for the development of the\nmalware and the operation of the TOR payment site.\n\nAffiliates who join the program are responsible for distributing the ransomware via spam,\ncompromising networks, and exploit kits.\n\nAs part of this arrangement, Avaddon is paying affiliates 65% of any ransom payments they\nbring in, and the Avaddon operators will receive 35%. Larger affiliates are commonly able to\nnegotiate a higher revenue share depending on the size of their attacks.\n\nAs is typical with RaaS programs, Avaddon has a series of rules that affiliates must follow\nwhen distributing the ransomware. The most common rule is that they cannot target victims\nin the [Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States)\n\nIt is forbidden to work in the CIS countries (AZ, AM, BY, KZ, KG, MD, RU, TJ, UZ, UA, GE,\nTM)\n\nIt is forbidden to indicate or pass on to third parties the address of the admin panel on the\n\n\n-----\n\n.onion network.\nIt is forbidden to upload .exe to unverified scanners that merge AV labs.\n\nNow that the Avaddon creators have started accepting applications, we should expect to\nsee distribution increase and more advanced attacks to occur.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\nAttachment: 94faa76502bb4342ed7cc3207b3158027807a01575436e2b683d4816842ed65d\nAvaddon: 05af0cf40590aef24b28fa04c6b4998b7ab3b7f26e60c507adb84f3d837778f2\n\n Associated files:\nIMG123101.jpg.js.zip\nIMG123101.jpg.js\n%temp%\\97459754.exe\n%temp%\\646246465.exe\n[id]-readme.html\n\n Ransom note text:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nYour network has been infected by Avaddon\nAll your documents, photos, databases and other important files have been encrypted\nand you are not able to decrypt it by yourself.
