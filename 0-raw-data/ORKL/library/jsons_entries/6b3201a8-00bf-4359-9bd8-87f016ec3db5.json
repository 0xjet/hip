These attacks will often\nsee criminals using chains of activity or connections spanning multiple business and\ngeographical locations in the victim environment.\n\nThe Avivore group, which has not been identified or tracked before, seems to have targeted\nassets related to a number of verticals besides aerospace and defence, including\nautomotive, energy, and space and satellite technology.\n\n“Previous reporting into recent incidents affecting aerospace and defence have linked this\nactivity to [APT10 and JSSD (Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security). Though the nature](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/podcast/Risk-Repeat-What-APT10-means-for-managed-service-providers)\nof the activity makes attribution challenging, our experience of the campaign suggests a new\ngroup that we have codenamed Avivore,” said Oliver Fay, principal threat intelligence analyst\nat Context.\n\nThe group appears to operate in the UTC +8 timezone and exploits the PlugX remote access\nTrojan, which has been used extensively by APT10.\n\nHowever, its tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), infrastructure and other tooling is\nsignificantly different to known Chinese-state actors. It is this that has led Context to the\nconclusion that Avivore is a previously untracked nation state-level adversary.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Context, the group is a highly capable actor, skilled at living-off-the-land and\nobfuscating its activity in the day-to-day business activities of its victims’ employees. It also\nappears to have a high degree of operational security awareness – for example, it clears\nforensic artefacts as it progresses to make detection harder.\n\n“The capability of the threat actor makes detecting these incidents challenging, however the\ncomplex nature of the supplier relationship makes investigation, co-operation and\nremediation a significant issue,” said James Allman-Talbot, head of cyber incident response\nat Context.\n\n“When the organisation that has enabled the intrusion forms a critical part of your value\nchain, the operational business risk increases dramatically and difficult decisions need to be\nmade in a short space of time.”\n\nContext set out a number of recommendations for enterprises to consider adopting whether\nthey are likely to be a target of a supply chain attack or not.\n\nThese include imposing access limitations on supplier and partner connections using VPNs,\nsuch as preventing use outside business hours, agreeing specific locations and IP addresses\nfor access, and imposing restrictions on access to data and other assets.\n\nOther useful steps could include introducing multifactor authentication and enhancing\nauditing and logging at hosts and services into which suppliers connect.\n\nSteps should also be taken to ensure that remote access services implement appropriate log\nretention; to ensure that credentials for remote services are stored securely and their use\nmonitored; and where possible, to make applications, documents and technical information\nrelating to enterprise networks and remote access services available only to engineers and\nIT support staff.\n\n**Read more about VPNs**\n\nWhen it comes to comparing SD-WAN vs. VPN services, enterprises choosing between\nthe technologies should consider factors like cost, cloud usage and application\nawareness.\nWith help from artificial intelligence and automation, client VPN technologies could\n[innovate the way they handle data flows in hybrid cloud environments.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/How-client-VPN-technologies-will-evolve-with-AI-and-automation)\nVPN company NordVPN has introduced NordLynx technology built around the\nWireGuard protocol.\n\n**Read more on Hackers and cybercrime prevention**\n\n\n-----\n\ntier 1 vendor\n\nBy: Katie Terrell Hanna\n\nHow to use two VPN connections at the same time\n\nBy: Paul Kirvan\n\n\n-----\n\nAE Aerospace claims 5G landmark in transforming manufacturing productivity\n\nBy: Joe O’Halloran\n\nHow nation-state cyberattacks affect the future of infosec\n\nBy: Johna Johnson\n\nLatest News\n\n[Broadband Forum launches app-enabled services network gateway](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252520775/Broadband-Forum-launches-app-enabled-services-network-gateway)\n[NatWest replacing multiple customer service systems](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252520758/NatWest-replacing-multiple-customer-service-systems)\n[Amazon shareholders vote down audit of warehouse work conditions](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252520759/Amazon-shareholders-vote-down-audit-of-warehouse-work-conditions)\n[View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload Computer Weekly\n\nIn The Current Issue:\n\nGartner: It’s time to ‘unleash innovation’\nPrepare for a smart robot revolution\nDigitising customer engagement\n[Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/Computer-Weekly/Set-innovation-free-and-make-great-ideas-a-reality)\n\nLatest Blog Posts\n\n[Why a solid sustainability strategy needs good data as its foundation – Green Tech](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Green-Tech/Why-a-solid-sustainability-strategy-needs-good-data-as-its-foundation)\n[The challenges of trying to win business through G-Cloud – Ahead in the Clouds](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Ahead-in-the-Clouds/The-challenges-of-trying-to-win-business-through-G-Cloud)\n[View All Blogs](https://www.computerweekly.com/blogs)\n\n\n-----",
