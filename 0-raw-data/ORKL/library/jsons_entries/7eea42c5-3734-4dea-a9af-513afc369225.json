Most recently, this has culminated in the release of MAR](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/four-distinct-families-of-lazarus-malware-target-apples-macos-platform/)\n[(Malware Analysis Report) AR20-232A, which covers activities associated with the](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a)\n[BLINDINGCAN RAT. This tool is the latest in a very long line of tools which allow attackers to](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ciso-essentials-how-remote-access-trojans-affect-the-enterprise/)\nmaintain access to target environments as well as establish ongoing control of infected\nhosts. In this post, we give an overview of this campaign in context of other related\ncampaigns, describing its infection vector, execution and high-level behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection Vector\n\nAs we know, email [phishing attacks are still the dominant method of delivering malware](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/phishing-revealing-vulnerable-targets/)\nwhen it comes to these types of attacks. The BLINDINGCAN campaigns are no different, but\ntheir phishing lure comes with an interesting twist: malicious documents utilized in the\ncampaign masquerade as job offers and postings from high-value defense contractors such\nas [Boeing.](https://www.boeing.com/)\n\nThis isn’t the first time such a lure has been used. Sophisticated attackers have sought to\nmimic entities in the defense, military, and government space in the past. This is especially\ntrue, historically, with campaigns tied to North Korea. Even early on in 2020, Operation North\nStar followed a very similar modus operandi, and by some accounts these campaigns may\nbe [related.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/north-korea-aerospace-defense-mcafee-job-offers/)\n\n[CISA maintains a running repository of North Korean / Hidden Cobra related advisories and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea)\ndetails. Their alerts cover campaigns from 2017 to present, including (but not limited to):\n\n[WannaCry – Massively destructive “ransomware” with SMB spreading capabilities.](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/are-we-done-with-wannacry/)\nDelta Charlie – Backdoor and Denial-of-Service tool set\nVolgmer – Backdoor\nFALLCHILL – Full-function RAT\nBANKSHOT – RAT and proxy/tunneling tool set\nHARDRAIN – RAT and proxy tool set w/ Android support\nSHARPKNOT – MBR Wiper\nTYPEFRAME – RAT and proxy/tunneling tool set\nKEYMARBLE – Full-function RAT\nFASTCash – RAT and proxy/tunneling tool set (Financial attacks)\n\n\n-----\n\nBADCALL – RAT and proxy tool set w/ Android support\nELECTRICFISH – proxy/tunneling tool set\nHOPLIGHT – proxy/tunneling tool set with pseudo-SSL spoofing\nARTFULPIE – Downloader and launcher tool set\nCROWDEDFLOUNDER – Full-function RAT\n[TAINTEDSCRIBE – Downloader and launcher with LFSR (LInear Feedback Shift](http://www.quadibloc.com/crypto/co040801.htm)\nRegister) support\nCOPPERHEDGE – Full-function RAT, cryptocurrency and crypto-exchange focused.\n\nIn short, the DPRK has a long history of these types of campaigns and it does not appear to\nbe letting up in frequency or aggressiveness. Moreover, North Korea is no stranger to playing\nthe ‘long-game’. Reflecting back on earlier attacks from the region (e.g., Operation Troy, Ten\nDays of Rain, Dark Seoul, and the Sony attack) we see similar tactics and aggressiveness.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BLINDINGCAN campaign has been specifically focused on defense and aerospace\n[targets, primarily based in Europe and the United States. According to AR20-232a: “The FBI](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a)\nhas high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction\nwith proxy servers” along with “compromised infrastructure from multiple countries to host its\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure”.\n\nThe objective of these attacks is to gain intelligence and to understand the key technologies\nthat fall under the umbrella of the targeted entity, as well as those adjacent to them\n(contactors, partners, etc.)\n\n## BLINDINGCAN RAT: Execution and Behavior\n\n[The malicious documents themselves, upon launch, attempt to exploit CVE-2017-0199. This](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0199)\nparticular flaw allows for remote code execution via maliciously crafted documents. More\nspecifically, CVE-2017-0199 is a result of the flawed processing of RTF files and elements by\n[way of a potent combination of object links and HTA payloads.](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41934)\n\nThis vulnerability is a common vector of attack for malicious actors, and despite the flaw\nbeing patched long ago, attackers bet on the fact (often successfully) that at least some of\ntheir targets will still be exposed to the flaw, allowing them to achieve their foothold.\n\nYou can see this behavior immediately upon launching one of the malicious documents.\n\nThe samples we analyzed reach out to a remote server (C2) for additional components.\nOnce established, a keylogging and clipboard monitoring component is dropped, and\nadditional information is extracted from the targeted hosts. WMI commands are utilized to\ngleen basic system details:\n```\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - select * from win32_computersystemproduct\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe RAT component (e.g.,\n```\n58027c80c6502327863ddca28c31d352e5707f5903340b9e6ccc0997fcb9631d ) can be\n\n```\nfound in both 32 and 64 bit varieties. The executable payloads employ multiple levels of\nobfuscation.\n\nConfiguration data for the RAT is embedded in the payloads and is both encrypted and\nencoded. Embedded configuration artifacts are AES-encrypted with a hard-coded key. Upon\ndecrypting, the resulting data is then decoded via XOR. Strings in the malware are RC4\nencrypted.\n\nThe RAT module will initially pull basic system data. The aforementioned WMI command is\npart of this system reconnaissance process. In this stage, the malware will pull local network\ndata, system name, OS version details, processor/platform details and MAC address details,\nand then push this data to the C2.\n\nThe core RAT feature set boils down to the following:\n\nGather and transmit defined set of System features\nCreate, terminate and manipulate processes\nCreate, terminate and manipulate files\nSelf-updating / self-deletion (cleaning of malicious code from the system when\nnecessary)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the malware and implants discussed here are specific to operations attributed to North\n[Korea, the delivery and weaponization states are common to most other APT groups and](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/what-are-advanced-targeted-attacks/)\n[non-nation-state backed campaigns.](https://www.sentinelone.com/resources/threat-actor-basics-understanding-the-5-main-threat-types/)\n\nThe key takeaways here are 1) it is important to keep abreast of the evolution of malicious\nattacks generated from this region, but also 2) we can apply what we have learned from\nother past attacks to improve our posture and reduce overall exposure, along with the\npotential negative repercussions of suffering from such an attack. Prevention, as always, is\nkey. The [SentinelOne Singularity Platform is fully capable of detecting and preventing](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\nmalicious activity associated with HIDDEN COBRA and BLINDINGCAN.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA256**\n6a3446b8a47f0ab4f536015218b22653fff8b18c595fbc5b0c09d857eba7c7a1\n8b53b519623b56ab746fdaf14d3eb402e6fa515cde2113a07f5a3b4050e98050\n58027c80c6502327863ddca28c31d352e5707f5903340b9e6ccc0997fcb9631d\n7933716892e0d6053057f5f2df0ccadf5b06dc739fea79ee533dd0cec98ca971\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA1**\n0ecc687d741c7b009c648ef0de0a5d47213f37ff\n3f6ef29b86bf1687013ae7638f66502bcf883bfd\n9feef1eed2a8a5cbfe1c6478f2740d8fe63305e2\nC70edfaf2c33647d531f7df76cd4e5bb4e79ea2e\n\n**Domains**\nagarwalpropertyconsultants[.]com\ncuriofirenze[.]com\nautomercado.co[.]cr\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n[Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)\n[Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell [T1059]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)\n[Exploitation for Client Execution [T1203]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/)\n[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder [T1547]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n[Process Injection [T1055]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\n[Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information [T1140]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\n[System Time Discovery [T1124]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1124/)\n[Account Discovery [T1087]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/)\n[Query Registry [T1012]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n[Process Discovery [T1424]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1424/)\n[System Owner/User Discovery [T1033]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/)\n[Automated Collection [T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\n[Data from Local System [T1533]]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1533/)\n[Remote File Copy [T1544](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1544/)\n[Automated Exfiltration [T1020]]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/)\n[Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [T1041]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\n\n-----",
