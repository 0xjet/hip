    "plain_text": "# Against Ongoing Pro-Russia Hacktivist Activity\n\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Actions to take today:\nBureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA),\n\n                                    - Immediately change all default\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE),\n\npasswords of OT devices\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Drug\n\n(including PLCs and HMIs), and\n\nAdministration (FDA), Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center\n\nuse strong, unique passwords.\n\n(MS-ISAC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and United\n\n                                    - Limit exposure of OT systems to\n\nKingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)—hereafter referred\n\nthe internet.\n\nto as “the authoring organizations”—are disseminating this fact sheet to\n\n                                    - Implement multifactor\n\nhighlight and safeguard against the continued malicious cyber activity\n\nauthentication for all access to\n\nconducted by pro-Russia hacktivists against operational technology (OT)\n\nthe OT network.\n\ndevices in North America and Europe.\n\n\nThe authoring organizations are aware of pro-Russia hacktivists targeting and compromising small-scale OT systems in\nNorth American and European Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS), Dams, Energy, and Food and Agriculture Sectors.\nThese hacktivists seek to compromise modular, internet-exposed industrial control systems (ICS) through their software\ncomponents, such as human machine interfaces (HMIs), by exploiting virtual network computing (VNC) remote access\nsoftware and default passwords.\n\nThe authoring organizations are releasing this fact sheet to share information and mitigations associated with this\nmalicious activity, which has been observed since 2022 and as recently as April 2024. The authoring organizations\nencourage OT operators in critical infrastructure sectors—including WWS, Dams, Energy, and Food and Agriculture—to\napply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this fact sheet to defend against this activity.\n\n## Overview of Threat Actor Activity\n\nPro-Russia hacktivist activity against these sectors appears mostly limited to unsophisticated techniques that manipulate\nICS equipment to create nuisance effects. However, investigations have identified that these actors are capable of\ntechniques that pose physical threats against insecure and misconfigured OT environments. Pro-Russia hacktivists have\nbeen observed gaining remote access via a combination of exploiting publicly exposed internet-facing connections and\noutdated VNC software, as well as using the HMIs’ factory default passwords and weak passwords without multifactor\nauthentication.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistorically, these hacktivists have been known to exaggerate their capabilities and impacts to targets. Since 2022, they\nhave claimed on social media to have conducted cyber operations (such as distributed denial of service, data leaks, and\ndata wiping) against a variety of North American and international organizations. Based on victim incident reporting, this\nactivity has caused limited disruption to operations.\n\n### 2024 Year-to-Date Activity\n\nIn early 2024, the authoring organizations observed pro-Russia hacktivists targeting vulnerable industrial control systems\nin North America and Europe. CISA and the FBI have responded to several U.S.-based WWS victims who experienced\nlimited physical disruptions from an unauthorized user remotely manipulating HMIs. Specifically, pro-Russia hacktivists\nmanipulated HMIs, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters. In each\ncase, the hacktivists maxed out set points, altered other settings, turned off alarm mechanisms, and changed\nadministrative passwords to lock out the WWS operators. Some victims experienced minor tank overflow events; however,\nmost victims reverted to manual controls in the immediate aftermath and quickly restored operations.\n\n### Remote Access to HMIs\n\nThe authoring organizations have observed pro-Russia hacktivists using a variety of techniques to gain remote access to\nHMIs and make changes to the underlying OT. These techniques include:\n\n  - Using the VNC Protocol to access HMIs and make changes to the underlying OT. VNC is used for remote access to\ngraphical user interfaces, including HMIs that control OT systems.\n\n  - Leveraging the VNC Remote Frame Buffer Protocol to log into HMIs to control OT systems.\n\n  - Leveraging VNC over Port 5900 to access HMIs by using default credentials and weak passwords on accounts\nnot protected by multifactor authentication.\n\nNote: Several HMIs compromised by these hacktivists were unsupported legacy, foreign-manufactured devices rebranded\nas U.S. devices.\n\n## MITIGATIONS\n\nThe authoring organizations recommend critical infrastructure organizations implement the following mitigations to\ndefend against this activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\ndeveloped by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of\npractices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on\nexisting cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics,\n[techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the](https://www.cisa.gov/cpg)\nCPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n\n### Network Defenders\n\nPro-Russia hacktivists have exploited cybersecurity weaknesses, including poor password security and exposure to the\ninternet. To safeguard against this threat, the authoring organizations urge organizations to:\n\n#### Harden HMI Remote Access\n\n  - Disconnect all HMIs, such as the touchscreens used to monitor or make changes to the system, or\nprogrammable logic controllers (PLCs), from the public-facing internet. If remote access is necessary, implement\na firewall and/or virtual private network (VPN) with a strong password and multifactor authentication to control\n[device access [CPG 2.W] [CPG 2.X].](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NoExploitableServicesontheInternet2W)\n\n  - Implement multifactor authentication for all access to the OT network. For additional information, see CISA’s\n[More than a Password [CPG 2.H].](https://www.cisa.gov/MFA)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Immediately change all default and weak passwords on HMIs and use a strong, unique password. Ensure the\nfactory default password is not in use. Open the remote settings panel to confirm the old password is no longer\n[shown [CPG 2.A] [CPG 2.B].](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#ChangingDefaultPasswords2A)\n\n  - Keep VNC updated with the latest version available and ensure all systems and software are up to date with\npatches and necessary security updates.\n\n  - Establish an allowlist that permits only authorized device IP addresses. The allowlist can be refined to specific\ntimes of the day to further obstruct malicious threat actor activity; organizations are encouraged to establish\nalerting for monitoring access attempts.\n`o` Note: An allowlist is not a complete security solution by itself but may increase the level of effort necessary\nfor a threat actor to compromise a device.\n\n  - [Log remote logins to HMIs, taking note of any failed attempts and unusual times [CPG 2.T].](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#LogCollection2T)\n\n#### Strengthen Security Posture\n\n  - Integrate cybersecurity considerations into the conception, design, development, and operation of OT systems.\nFor additional information, see the DOE Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response\n[(CESER)’s publication on Cyber-Informed Engineering.](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/cyber-informed-engineering)\n\n  - [Practice and maintain the ability to operate systems manually [CPG 5.A].](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#IncidentPlanningandPreparedness5A)\n\n  - Create backups of the engineering logic, configurations, and firmware of HMIs to enable fast recovery. Familiarize\n[your organization with factory resets and backup deployment [CPG 2.R].](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SystemBackups2R)\n\n  - Check the integrity of PLC ladder logic or other PLC programming languages and diagrams and check for any\nunauthorized modifications to ensure correct operation. Adversaries may try to maintain persistence or stealthily\noperate the device in an unsafe way by changing the configurations and ladder logic.\n\n  - [Update and safeguard network diagrams to reflect both the IT and OT networks [CPG 2.P]. Operators should](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DocumentNetworkTopology2P)\napply the principles of least privilege and need to know for individuals’ access to network diagrams. Maintain\nawareness of internal and external solicitation efforts (both malicious and benign) to obtain network\narchitectures and restrict mapping to trusted personnel. Consider using encryption, authentication, and\nauthorization techniques to secure network diagram files and implement access control and audit logs to monitor\nand restrict who can view or modify your network diagrams.\n\n  - Be aware of cyber/physical-enabled threats. Adversaries may attempt to obtain network credentials by various\nphysical means, including official visits, tradeshow and conference conversations, and through social media\nplatforms.\n\n  - [Take inventory and determine the end-of-life status of all HMIs [CPG 1.A]. Replace end-of-life HMIs as soon as](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#AssetInventory1A)\nfeasible.\n\n  - Implement software and hardware limits to the manipulation of physical processes, limiting the impact of a\nsuccessful compromise. This can be completed through using operational interlocks, cyber-physical safety\nsystems, and cyber-informed engineering.\n\n#### Limit Adversarial Use of Common Vulnerabilities\n\n  - Reduce risk exposure. U.S. organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including scanning and\n[testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to threats by mitigating attack vectors. CISA Cyber Hygiene](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/cyber-hygiene-services)\nservices can help provide additional review of internet-accessible assets and provide regular reports on steps to\n[take to mitigate vulnerabilities. Email vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov with the subject line, “Requesting Cyber Hygiene](mailto:vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov)\n[Services,” to get started. UK organizations can use NCSC’s free Early Warning](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/early-warning-service) service.\n\n  - Assess your security posture. CISA’s regional Cybersecurity Advisors provide CPG assessments to help\n[organizations understand their current security posture. Reach out to your regional CISA office to schedule an](https://www.cisa.gov/about/regions)\nassessment.\n\n\n-----\n\n### OT Device Manufacturers\n\nAlthough critical infrastructure organizations can take steps to mitigate risks, it is ultimately the responsibility of the OT\ndevice manufacturer to build products that are secure by design and default. The authoring organizations urge device\n[manufacturers to take ownership of the security outcomes of their customers in line with the joint guide Shifting the](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design)\n[Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software and CISA’s Secure by Design](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design)\nwebpage.\n\n  - Eliminate default and require strong passwords. The use of default credentials is a top weakness that threat\nactors exploit to gain access to systems. Manufacturers can eliminate this problem at scale through any of the\n[approaches recommended in CISA’s Secure by Design Alert](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-how-manufacturers-can-protect-customers-eliminating-default-passwords) on this topic.\n\n  - Mandate multifactor authentication for privileged users. Changes to engineering logic or configurations are\nsafety-impacting events in critical infrastructure. Any changes should require multifactor authentication.\n\n  - Include logging at no additional charge. Change and access control logs allow operators to track safety-impacting\nevents in their critical infrastructure. These logs should be free and use open standard logging formats.\n\n  - Publish Software Bills of Materials (SBOM). Vulnerabilities in underlying software libraries can affect wide\nswathes of devices. Without an SBOM, it is nearly impossible for a critical infrastructure system owner to\nmeasure and mitigate the impact a vulnerability has on their existing systems.\n\n[Additionally, see CISA’s Secure by Design Alert](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-how-software-manufacturers-can-shield-web-management-interfaces-malicious-cyber) on how software manufacturers can shield web management interfaces\nfrom malicious cyber activity. By using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines\nsecure “out of the box” without requiring customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes,\npurchasing tiered security software and logs, monitoring, and making routine updates.\n\n## RESOURCES\n\nEntities requiring additional support for implementing any of the mitigations in this advisory should contact their regional\n[CISA Cybersecurity Advisor](https://www.cisa.gov/about/regions) [and/or EPA for assistance.
