Not sure how or if it could happen again, the prison warden\n\nrequested security experts to investigate. Many prisons and jails use SCADA systems\n\nwith PLCs to open and close doors. As a result of Stuxnet academic research, we have\n\ndiscovered significant vulnerabilities in PLCs used in correctional facilities by being able\n\nto remotely flip the switches to “open” or “locked closed” on cell doors and gates. Using\n\noriginal and publically available exploits along with evaluating vulnerabilities in\n\nelectronic and physical security designs, we will analyze SCADA systems and PLC\n\nvulnerabilities in correctional and government secured facilities while making\n\nrecommendations for improved security measures.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\n###### Biographies\n\n**John J.

While it was not the first malicious software to\ntarget automation systems, it was unique in that it exploited four zero-days and was the\nfirst to contain root kits specifically targeted for particular Siemens SCADA (Supervisory\nControl and Data Acquisition) systems. The attack on Iran’s centrifuges was based on\nexploiting Siemens PLCs (programmable logic controllers). In particular, the attacks\nwere on STEP 7, software for the controlling computer, used for programming the\nPLCs. Microsoft states that patches MS08-067, MS10-046, and MS10-061 for Windows\nmay have fixed the vulnerabilities that allowed STEP 7 to be attacked.[ii]\n\nAlthough PLCs have been around for more than 40 years, until Stuxnet, few\nsecurity research projects were focused on them. PLCs were originally developed in\nthe 1960s to facilitate industrial automation. Many PLCs in use today utilize a simple\nprogramming language called Ladder Logic to make it easier to program them.\nFortunately, or unfortunately—depending upon one’s perspective—the simple and basic\nnature of PLCs makes them exceptionally vulnerable to being exploited.\n\nThe ease with which programming PLCs can be done is one of the reasons why\nmany in the computer security research community have now shifted their focus upon\nwhere and how PLCs are used. So far, the focus has primarily been on large SCADA\nsystems and the use of PLCs in critical infrastructure such as in manufacturing plants,\npower grid, pipelines, water systems, and so forth.\n\nOur research analyzes PLC usage and vulnerabilities that has escaped attention\nbecause most people know very little about PLCs in correctional facilities.[iii]\nUnderstanding the electronic, physical and computer security designs in correctional\nfacilities will outlines why PLCs were implemented in many jails and prisons and\nelucidates their requisite vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Design\n\nOne of the reasons PLCs are used in correctional facilities is because it greatly\nreduces the amount of wiring that needs to be done amongst a multitude of points. A\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nlarge jail or prison has many hundreds of doors to control as well as numerous systems\nto manage and integrate such as intercoms, video systems, door and lock alarms,\nlighting controls, and others. These systems are massive and involve many\nthousands—or tens of thousands—of points and contact closures to monitor. Because\nPLCs consolidate connections (depending how many I/Os each PLC has), they also can\nreduce wiring and conduit costs. Consequently, correctional facilities are ideally suited\nfor PLC technology.\n\nWhat does a PLC look like? The illustration below (Figure 1) shows the typical\nparts of a PLC just for door control. Bear in mind, a prison security electronic system\nhas many parts beyond door control such as intercoms, lighting control, video\nsurveillance, water and shower control, and so forth. Access to any part, such as a\nremote intercom station, might provide access to all parts.\n\n_Figure 1_\n\n### Block Diagram of PLC\n\n###### [Programmable Logic Controller]\n\nData\nMemory\n###### DRAM Communications\n\n**Panel switch** **Relay**\n**Lock sensor** **Lock motor**\n\n###### Input Output\n\n**Door sensor** CPU **Lock solenoid**\n**Limit switch** **Interlock**\n\nNon‐Volatile\n\nMemory\n\n(+) Power supply\n\nProgramming device\n\n### Door Control\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nThe illustration below (Figure 2) is of a pneumatic prison sliding door and\ndramatizes the fact that, depending upon the sophistication of the door control system,\nthis single door can have as many as 34 points to monitor.\n\n_Figure 2_\n\nThere are a few basic aspects to PLCs:\n\n  - The communications port is typically 9-pin RS-232 or EIA-485;\n\n  - The communications protocols are usually Modbus, BACnet, or DF1.\n\n  - The most common programming language, especially in older systems, is\n\n“Ladder Logic,” which, because it is intended to be simple, is very vulnerable to\nbeing exploited. Other programming languages are far less common:\n\no FBD (function block diagram)\no SFC (sequential function chart)\no ST (structured text; viz. Pascal)\no IL (instruction list)\no BASIC\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\no C++\n\nThere are from 40 to 50 manufacturers. The PLCs most commonly used in corrections\nare the following:\n\n› Allen-Bradley\n› GE Fanuc\n\n› Hitachi\n› Mitsubishi\n\n› Panasonic\n› Rockwell Automation\n\n› Samsung\n› Siemens\n\n› Square-D\n\n###### Prisons, Penitentiary and Jails Design\n\nWhile many prison and penitentiaries use PLCs, smaller correctional facilities\nsuch as local jails may not. Prisons and penitentiaries are correctional facilities that are\nintended for confinements of at least a year (or life) and are owned and operated by the\nfederal government or by states. A number of them, about 160, are operated by private\ncompanies. Jails, on the other hand, are intended for incarcerations of a year or less\nand are owned and managed by city, county or town governments.\n\nJails are typically much smaller than prisons, albeit there are some very large\njails. Orange County Jail in California, for example, has more than 2500 inmates.\nMoreover, there has been a trend toward regional jails that serve multiple jurisdictions\nand can also be very large. One might be tempted to ignore jails in this vulnerability\nanalysis, but they are also where people are held for trial—meaning that a jail prisoner\ncould be a petty thief or could be a terrorist.\n\nIn broad numbers, the United States has about 117 federal correctional facilities,\nroughly 1,700 prisons, and more than 3,000 jails. All but the smallest facilities use\nPLCs to control doors and manage their security systems. The trend in new correctional\nfacilities has been toward star cluster designs for large facilities (Figure 3). A central\ncontrol center is the hub and serves as the “brain” for the facility. They typically have\nthe capability of controlling anything.\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nDay-to-day operations of the cell areas, however, are managed by a local\nhousing control station, sometimes termed “pod” control. Similarly, perimeter gates\n(sally ports) are usually operated directly by a control station near the gate. However,\nbecause most correctional facilities are typically short-staffed, it is not uncommon for the\ncontrol of housing areas and even gate operations to be transferred to central control\nwhen activities are at a lull, such as during the “graveyard” hours. This creates a\nvulnerability that can be exploited.\n\n_Figure 3_\n\n**Housing (Pod)**\n**Control**\n\n**Also, may have:**\n\n**Food Service**\n**Prison Industries**\n**Laundry**\n**Library**\n**Visitation**\n**Health Services**\n\n**Central** **And other**\n**Control**\n\n**Equipment**\n**Room**\n\n###### TYPICAL PRISON DESIGN\n\n Exploiting Prison Systems: Possible Scenarios\n\nLet’s assume that one introduced an exploit into a prison system. What could be\ndone? In addition to the obvious scenario in which a prisoner may escape if doors and\ngates are opened, the purpose could also be to either cause chaos for a murder or bring\nan item into the prison. Granted, the probability of success may be low due to a high\nconcentration of law enforcement usually present, but it is conceivable. By contrast, in\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nthe past 30 years there have been about 8 times that helicopters have been used for a\nprison escape, of which 6 were initially successful.\n\nOn the other hand, one could prevent doors from being opened for a short time.\nThis scenario has sinister assassination possibilities if one understands the unique\nnature of how fire evacuations are conducted in prisons and the technology of “slamlock” doors and something called the “remote latch holdback.” Someone with malicious\nintentions could wreak widespread pandemonium by severely damaging door systems\nand shutting down security, communications, and video systems.\n\nAs one example, a very large prison cannot instantly and simultaneously open or\nclose all doors. The power in-rush would be massive, destroying the electronics and\npossibly physically damaging door components. The doors are gradually cascaded,\ngroup-by-group. If we controlled the PLCs, we could override the cascade program.\n\n###### Network Security and Information Technology within Correctional\n Facilities\n\nThe question arises, therefore, how likely is it that we could take control of PLCs?\nIf you query anyone from the corrections industry, the answer is inevitably the same:\nThey say it cannot be done because there are no outside network connections. But, is\nthat true?\n\nA location our team surveyed, indeed, had connections to the Internet from in the\nControl Room. During our survey, a Control Room guard was accessing Gmail and\ncommenting that there are problems with viruses and worm from guards accessing\nonline images and movies. Additionally, many federal prisons use a “security through\nobscurity” method by obscuring a data port under the legs of the control panel console.\n\nHaving no connectivity to the Internet for updates for industrial control systems\n\n(ICS) is not practical. There are a few principles to consider when ICSs are in secure\n\nfacilities. The term CIA, in some realms, stands for the Culinary Institute of America, but\n\nwith IT and ICS, it stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Securing ICSs like\n\na typical IT (information technology) center is not a fix for these vulnerabilities.[iv] The CIA\n\nprinciples are crucial for an IT system. When exchanging information between IT\n\nsystems and users, the priority for an IT network is 1) Confidentiality of the exchange; 2)\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nIntegrity of the data being exchanged; and 3) Accessibility of the data and network.\n\nAdditionally, IT networks are often shut down for regular maintenance. This is not\n\npractical for an ICS network.\n\nIn contrast, ICSs have a different priority of AIC.[v] Availability is of the utmost\n\npriority because ICSs cannot be shut down for regular maintenance if they are in\n\ncontinuous use; shutting them down for updates must be coordinated. Since availability\n\nis of the utmost importance, it creates another security complication: reduced usage of\n\nIntrusion Prevention Systems. Since intrusion prevention can impede availability, IPSs\n\nare less commonly deployed. In many prisons and jails, the PLCs also control video\n\nmonitoring, alarm systems and communications in addition to door controls. For these\n\nreasons, integrity and confidentiality are lesser priorities than availability.\n\nIn turn, simply cutting prisons off from the Internet is not a practical solution to\n\nmitigating the risks associated with PLCs and control computers. The “availability”\n\nrequirement is also important because correctional facilities must send and receive\n\ninformation to and from federal, state, and/or local data bases such as criminal records\n\ndatabases.\n\nOther communication requirements to outside the facility include operations, such as\n\nfood services, which have online connections to vendors and suppliers. We have found\n\nsome points where prison Commissaries connect to network segments on which the\n\nPLCs are located. Some correctional facilities also provide Internet access for inmates.\n\nGranted, they are not connected to prison control and monitoring systems, but they are\n\na point at which a vulnerability can be exploited, albeit difficult.\n\n###### Unauthorized Access to Networks\n\nPerimeter patrol vehicles sometimes have wireless connections to the facility\n\nperimeter intrusion detection system and central control. However, there have been\n\ncases in which patrol cars’ video is uploaded to the correctional facility via 802.11 g and\n\nn, and as a result of the connection not being encrypted, a neighbor uploaded the video\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nto YouTube. Hacks on patrol vehicles have also been reported in the media as have\n\npeople being able to access video on law enforcement videos by accessing the DVR in\n\nthe vehicle.[vi]\n\nIn relation to security of networks in correctional facilities, access to jail networks are\n\nnecessary for patrol cars to upload data, but isolating networks used by law\n\nenforcement from that used by prisoners is crucial. There is one example of a maximum\n\nsecurity correctional facility in Colorado where the prisoners have access to computers\n\nfrom within their cells. One news article states that the system is hardened and very\n\nsecure.[vii] However, a follow-up article published on the same day states how the prison\n\nhas instated a “successful program” in which they are patching the security holes\n\nprisoners are finding; prisoners caused buffer overflows.[viii] From the information given, it\n\nis not possible to tell if the systems were vulnerable; however, they do use software with\n\nknown vulnerabilities. It is also unknown if it was possible to connect to the same\n\nsystems on which the prison PLCs may be connected, but if not patched, there may be\n\nan attack vector. [ix]\n\nConsidering PLC and SCADA vulnerability research that has been made public\n\nsince Stuxnet was discovered, there are some correctional facility design vulnerabilities\n\nthat should be evaluated in conjunction with the wired network and Internet connectivity\n\nboth within and to outside them.\n\n###### Attack Vectors\n\nWhile this research began with academic Stuxnet code review, some of the attack\n\nvectors used by Stuxnet are similar to what we produced in our “lab” By accessing the\n\nloaded libraries of the software that control, monitor, or program the PLCs, we believe\n\nwe have found an attack vector that is not vendor-specific. Once compromised, it is\n\npossible to manipulate the physical state of anything connected to the PLC -- such as\n\nthe lock state of doors -- and it is also possible to suppress any notifications or alarms\n\nthat are delivered or derived from the PLC. “Open Door” notifications are one such\n\nexample.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nCustom exploits are not hard to create for PLCs due to the ease of programming\n\nthem by simplistic programming languages like Ladder Logic. For example, everyone on\n\nthis research team was able to put together a PLC exploit in only a few hours. While we\n\ncreated the exploits for research purposes, there are many exploits that are publicly\n\navailable and can be found online such as on Exploit-DB.com.\n\nThere are multiple attack vectors that could lead to a compromise of the PLCs. If the\n\nmachine controlling, monitoring, or programming is misused by personnel and\n\nconnected to the internet, then the usual client side attack vectors are in scope. When it\n\nis connected to the Internet, it is also subject to conventional attacks such as, man-in\nthe-middle, network based attacks exploits, and forced updates – perhaps some with\n\nimproper SSL certificates as was the case with Stuxnet.\n\nIn addition to remote attack vectors, Stuxnet showed that physical access to a facility\n\nis just as great of a risk. It is theorized that Stuxnet was introduced to computers in an\n\nIranian nuclear facility by an infected USB drive. Likewise, we learned from our\n\nevaluation of a correctional facility that the same could be done with techniques such as\n\nsocial engineering or any method that would gain a malicious attacker physical access.\n\nWhile we were viewing the Control Room, we were invited to follow the IT repair\n\ntechnicians into the Equipment Room where they had been working alone.\n\n###### Research Workshop and Expenses\n\nThe research we performed cost\n\napproximately $2500 and it was done in a\n\nbasement workshop. It should be noted that\n\nthis is the cost to acquire the hardware as\n\nwell as legitimate licenses for the software. If\n\nsomeone only desired to acquire the\n\nhardware, the cost would be closer to $500.\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\nThe relatively low expenses involved in this research shows that this does not require a\n\nlarge laboratory environment, or an advanced persistent threat.\n\n###### Recommendations\n\nOur recommendations for improving security in locations with PLCs and SCADA in\n\nwhich the U.S. keeps its greatest assets (banks, government research facilities, etc)\n\nand in which it keeps its worst liabilities, such as in correctional facilities, include a\n\ncombination of re-evaluation of prison physical designs and electronic security, network\n\nsecurity and greater enforcement of computer usage policies in these facilities.\n\nOur recommendations for correctional facilitates:\n\n Prison design re-evaluation: many modern prisons/jails were designed 10 years\n\nago before these attack vectors were known;\n Improved communication/interaction between IT and physical security;\n Enforcing and updating procedures and policies regarding acceptable use of\n\nfacility computers;\n Patch PLC and controlling computer’s software;\n When PLCs are in use in secured areas, use heightened security procedures\n Proper network segmentation;\n Use a device for its intended purpose;\n Restrict physical media.\n\n###### Summary\n\nA logical conclusion to this research is that our findings do not only pertain to PLC\n\nand SCADA vulnerabilities in correctional facilities, but in any high-security location that\n\nuses these technologies as well as in manufacturing plants, transportation and just\n\nabout anywhere that multiplexing is used.\n\nWhen securing the country’s most dangerous liabilities, we encourage that more\n\nattention be paid to access control, network security/segmentation and personnel\n\npolicies. And as was the case with Stuxnet, proper adherence to secure operating\n\nprocedures will greatly reduce the chances of infection of PLCs and control computers\n\nfrom the inside and outside of a secure facility.\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\nNewman, Rad, Strauchs\n\n###### Endnotes\n\ni Gross, M.
