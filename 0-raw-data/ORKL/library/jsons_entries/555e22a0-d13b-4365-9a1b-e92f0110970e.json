The group's\ncampaigns are still active at the time of writing.\n\n[Microsoft's Threat Intelligence team first documented the group's malicious activities in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-blocks-polonium-hackers-from-using-onedrive-in-attacks/)\nJune 2022, linking POLONIUM threat actors in Lebanon with ties to Iran's Ministry of\nIntelligence and Security (MOIS).\n\n\n-----\n\n## The POLONIUM toolset\n\n[ESET reports that POLONIUM is solely interested in cyberespionage and does not deploy](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/10/11/polonium-targets-israel-creepy-malware/)\ndata wipers, ransomware, or other file-damaging tools.\n\nSince September 2021, the hackers have used at least seven variants of custom\nbackdoors, including four new undocumented backdoors known as 'TechnoCreep',\n'FlipCreep', 'MegaCreep',, and 'PapaCreep.'\n\n**The seven backdoors deployed by POLONIUM since September 2021** _(ESET)_\nSome backdoors abuse legitimate cloud services, such as OneDrive, Dropbox, and Mega,\nto act as command and control (C2) servers. Other backdoors utilize standard TCP\nconnections to remote C2 servers or get commands to execute from files hosted on FTP\nservers.\n\nWhile not all backdoors have the same features, their malicious activity includes the ability\nto log keystrokes, take screenshots of the desktop, take photos with the webcam, exfiltrate\nfiles from the host, install additional malware, and execute commands on the infected\ndevice.\n\nThe most recent backdoor, PapaCreep, spotted in September 2022, is the first one in C++,\nwhereas the hackers wrote older versions either in PowerShell or C#.\n\nPapaCreep is also modular, breaking its command execution, C2 communication, file\nupload, and file download functions into small components.\n\nThe advantage is that the components can run independently, persist via separate\nscheduled tasks in the breached system, and make the backdoor harder to detect.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PapaCreep's encrypted request to C2** _(ESET)_\nBesides the ‘Creepy’ variants, POLONIUM also uses various open source tools, either\ncustom or off-the-shelf, for reverse proxying, screenshot taking, keylogging, and webcam\nsnapping, so there’s a level of redundancy in the operations.\n\n## An elusive hacking group\n\nESET couldn't discover POLONIUM's tactics used to initially compromise a network, but\nMicrosoft previously reported that the group was using known VPN product flaws to breach\nnetworks.\n\nThe threat actor's private network infrastructure is hidden behind virtual private servers\n(VPS) and legitimate compromised websites, so mapping the group's activities remains\nmurky.\n\n\n-----\n\nPOLONIUM is a sophisticated and highly targeted threat whose crosshairs are fixed at\nIsrael right now, but this could change any moment if the priorities or interests change.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Iranian hackers encrypt Windows systems using BitLocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-iranian-hackers-encrypt-windows-systems-using-bitlocker/)\n\n[New Iranian hacking group APT42 deploys custom Android spyware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-iranian-hacking-group-apt42-deploys-custom-android-spyware/)\n\n[Hacking group updates Furball Android spyware to evade detection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacking-group-updates-furball-android-spyware-to-evade-detection/)\n\n[Hackers target Asian casinos in lengthy cyberespionage campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-asian-casinos-in-lengthy-cyberespionage-campaign/)\n\n[Signal calls on users to run proxies for bypassing Iran blocks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/signal-calls-on-users-to-run-proxies-for-bypassing-iran-blocks/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Hacking Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hacking-group/)\n[Iran](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/iran/)\n[Israel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/israel/)\n[Lebanon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/lebanon/)\n[Polonium](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/polonium/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
