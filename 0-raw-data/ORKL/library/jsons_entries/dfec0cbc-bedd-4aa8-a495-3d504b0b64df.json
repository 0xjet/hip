Even worse, a ransomware feature is being developed for the malware.\n\nThreat actors abusing Discord for malicious activity is nothing new\n\n\n-----\n\n[In the past, we have reported on how threat actors use Discord as a stolen data drop or](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-abused-to-spread-malware-and-harvest-stolen-data/)\n[have created malware that modifies the Discord client to have it](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-turned-into-an-info-stealing-backdoor-by-new-malware/) steal credentials and other\ninformation.\n\n## RAT uses Discord as a full C2 server\n\n[A new 'Abaddon' remote access trojan (RAT) discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, though,](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1319236824070500353)\ncould be the first malware that uses Discord as a full-fledge command and control server.\n\nA command and control server (C2) is a remote host that malware receives commands to\nexecute on an infected computer.\n\nWhen started, Abaddon will automatically steal the following data from an infected PC:\n\nChrome cookies, saved credit cards, and credentials.\n\n**Code showing the stealing of Chrome data**\n\n\n-----\n\nSteam credentials and list of installed games\n\n**Code showing Steam data theft**\nDiscord tokens and MFA information.\nFile listings\nSystem information such as country, IP address, and hardware information.\n\nAbaddon will then connect to the Discord command and control server to check for new\ncommands to execute, as shown by the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Receive a task from the Discord server**\nThese commands will tell the malware to perform one of the following tasks:\n\nSteal a file or entire directories from the computer\nGet a list of drives\nOpen a reverse shell that allows the attacker to execute commands on the infected\nPC.\nLaunch in-development ransomware (more later on this).\nSend back any collected information and clear the existing collection of data.\n\nThe malware will connect to the C2 every ten seconds for new tasks to execute.\n\nUsing a Discord C2 server, the threat actor can continually monitor their collection of\ninfected PCs for new data and execute further commands or malware on the computer.\n\n## Developing a basic ransomware\n\nOne of the tasks that can be executed by the malware is to encrypt the computer with basic\nransomware and decrypt files after a ransom is paid.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis feature is currently in development as its ransom note template contains filler as the\ndeveloper works on this feature.\n\n**In-development ransomware component**\nWith ransomware being extremely lucrative, it would not be surprising to see this feature\ncompleted in the future.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n[New NetDooka malware spreads via poisoned search results](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-netdooka-malware-spreads-via-poisoned-search-results/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Ukraine supporters in Germany targeted with PowerShell RAT malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/)\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[Command and Control](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/command-and-control/)\n[Discord](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/discord/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[RAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rat/)\n[Remote Access Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-access-trojan/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
