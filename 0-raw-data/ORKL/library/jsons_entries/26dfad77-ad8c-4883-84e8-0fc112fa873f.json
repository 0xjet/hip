Following our preliminary analysis, we assessed with high confidence\nthat the sample was used to target a previously unreported German chemical company. As part of our\nresponsible disclosure, we alerted the affected entity, the local Law Enforcements, and our clients.\nIn the following weeks after our internal reporting, the German news media source Tagesschau\n[reported our initial detection and analysis of the sample, and confirmed the chemical company’s](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr/hackerangriff-chemieunternehmen-101.html)\nawareness of the attack in the second half of 2019.\nThe Winnti sample we analysed was highly likely developed in 2015, and likely used around this year\nfor the first time, it is unclear how long the compromise existed in the compromised environment.\nAlthough the malware was likely used years ago, further analysis revealed a previously unreported C2\ntechnique never attributed to any Winnti Group’s toolkits.\nThe technique relies on a DNS Tunneling communication channel through a custom implementation of\nthe [iodine source code, an open-source software that enables the tunneling of IPv4 data through a](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine)\nDNS server.\nAdditionally, we uncovered a previously unknown stolen digital certificate being used to digitally sign\nWinnti-related attack components, and the targeting of a previously-unreported South Korean video\ngame company.\nThe sophistication of the techniques we uncovered confirms that the Winnti Group is a highly\nsophisticated, and highly committed Advanced Persistent Group targeting a plethora of different\nindustry sectors in Europe and South Asia.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Winnti Group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly) is an alleged Chinese state-sponsored\numbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared goals and attack\nresources. The suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government pinpoints that it likely has an incentive to\ncontinue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s highlighted as priority for China’s economic\ndevelopment.\n\nOn Friday, 13 January, QuoIntelligence (QuoINT) detected a new Winnti sample uploaded to a public virus\nscanner from a German location. Following our preliminary analysis, we assessed with high confidence that\nthe sample was used to target a previously unreported German chemical company. Additionally, during our\nanalysis we uncovered a previously unknown stolen digital certificate being used to digitally sign Winnti\nrelated drivers, and a potential campaign against an already known South Korean video game company.\n\nIn the last year, researchers and journalists have publicly disclosed that the Winnti group targeted and\neventually compromised Henkel (2014), BASF (2015), Bayer (2018) and Roche (2019). This most\nrecent previously unreported German chemical company is yet another German chemical company targeted\nby Winnti since 2015. Prior to our analysis this attack activity was not publicly reported.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Timeline of attacks located in Germany and attributed to Winnti_\n[In December 2019, Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) released a report](https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/broschuere-2019-12-bfv-cyber-brief-2019-01.pdf)\nrelated to the alleged Chinese state sponsored umbrella organization known as the Winnti Group. Through\nour internal malware analysis, we are confident that the sample we discovered is highly similar to the Winnti\nsample described in the BfV report. The sample also matches known characteristics of Winnti’s arsenal\n[shared through intelligence reports produced by ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Winnti.pdf)\n\nFurther, we have informed the affected company, law enforcement agencies, and sent a Warning to our\ncustomers upon detection.\n\n### The Winnti Group\n\nThe Winnti Group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly) is an alleged Chinese state-sponsored\numbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared goals and attack\nresources. Notably, various operations attributed to other China-linked threat actor groups, such as APT17\nand Ke3chang, have also leveraged its backdoor malware. Active since at least 2010, initial attacks\nattributed to the group heavily targeted the gaming industry. However, as researchers have continued to\nfollow and dissect the group and its activity, the group’s target focus has expanded to other industries,\nincluding chemical, pharmaceutical, technology, and software. Further, the group’s evolution involves the\nenhancement, development, and inclusion of new tools and tactics.\n\nThe suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government, pinpoints that it likely has an incentive to continue\ntargeting a variety of industries, especially one’s highlighted as priority for China’s economic development. In\n[the latest Winnti Group public report, FireEye researchers reported of a new widespread campaign attributed](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html)\nto APT41 which involves exploitation attempts of recently disclosed and patched vulnerabilities for products\nof Cisco, Citrix, and Zoho. The campaign waves apparently take a more targeted approach to selecting\npotential victims across various sectors including financials, government, and information technology.\nAccording to the researchers, identified victim systems demonstrated the threat actor leveraged\ncommercially available post exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter, which are essentially\nfull featured backdoors.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Sample Targeting German Chemical Company\n\nThe main artifact uploaded to VirusTotal is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file, with a compilation timestamp\nsuggesting the sample was built in August 2015. Although the compilation time might be legitimate, it is not\npossible to determine when and how long the attackers used this malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**HASHES** **Compilation**\n\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n**Filename**\n\nTmPfwRVS.dll\n\n\n**MD5: c893a12ff72698f09f89f778e4c9cd2b**\n**SHA1: 06256946a69409cd18859bfa429184a282374d76**\n**SHA256:**\ndf6af36626d375c5e8aff45c64bfc1975d753b109e126a6cb30ee0523550329c\n\n_Table 1 – Winnti sample_\n\n### Binary Analysis\n\n\n2015-08-06\n01:52:51\n\n\nSimilar to other Winnti samples, the configuration section contains a string referring to the name of the\ncampaign.

By running dsefix.exe, the malware can bypass driver verification and\ninstall its own drivers. We identified the following two drivers which were embedded in the earlier described\nmain artifact. To note that this technique does not work on moden Windows (e.g. Windows 10) – yet another\npiece of evidence that this malware was designed and used multiple years ago.\n\n**Analysis of vboxdriver**\n\nThis is the vulnerable, correctly signed with a digital certificate, VirtualBox driver that is used for exploitation.\nIt is used regularly by various threat actors, and by the previously highlighted dsefix.exe. The driver can also\n[be used to perform the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) exploitation technique, a similar technique as DSEFix.](https://github.com/hfiref0x/TDL)\n\n**Analysis of driver1.sys**\n\n[In late 2019, ExaTrack released their analysis of a signed Winnti rootkit previously observed in the wild,](https://exatrack.com/public/winnti_EN.pdf)\nwhich we confirm is essentially the same rootkit driver. The sample is capable of injecting raw packets into\nthe network and receiving special formatted packets. In comparison, our variant has the same exact number\nof bytes, and there are large parts exactly matching.\n\n**Analysis of driver2.sys**\n\nThis rootkit driver seems to be largely the same as driver1.sys with the same characteristics including\nstructure, I/O control, and device strings. However, this driver supports different versions of Windows. It\nchecks for ranges of Windows New Technology (NT) build numbers and returns early.\n\n### C2 DNS Tunneling\n\nBy analyzing the malware, it is possible to find two network indicators within its code:\n\n_Figure 3 – observed network IoCs in Winnti sample_\n\nThe hardcoded 208.67.222.222 is a legitimate OpenDNS DNS server (resolver1.opendns.com). This IP is\npushed into a list that is generated by the malware at runtime. Likely, the initiation routine also populates the\nlist with the system’s DNS, and the OpenDNS server is only used as fallback case to ensure the C2 domain\ngets resolved.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dick[.]mooo[.]com FQDN name is offered by [FreeDNS, which is a free dynamic DNS service. Notably, in](https://freedns.afraid.org/)\nthe last years, multiple researchers have reported Winnti/PlugX C2 hostnames hosted in the mooo[.]com\nzone. In the code we observed that a dot (.) is enforced before the FQDN. Additional analysis revealed that\nthe malware generates subdomains with base128 encoding, and append them to FQDN.\n\n_Code 1 – Hostname length restriction_\n\nFurther, dots are added into it every 57 characters potentially as a hostname length restriction, suggesting\nthe expectation of long hostnames. We confirm the buffer can support FQDN’s up to 2000 characters.\n\n[Upon further investigation we found out that the malware includes the open source iodine source code –](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine)\nsoftware that enables the tunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server. Interestingly, we are not aware of any\nearlier documentation highlighting Winnti specifically leveraging iodine for DNS tunneling. However,\n[researchers at the Ruhr University Bochum, while hunting for DNS tunnels, observed APT32 and Wekby](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/assets/documents/A_Study_of_Newly_Observed_Hostnames_and_DNS_Tunneling_in_the_Wild.pdf)\nAPT groups using NULL and TXT records as a C2 communication channel, as well as mentioning the\nmooo[.]com top level domain in their findings.\n\nThe implementation of iodine used in the Winnti sample is integrated and uses some custom wrapper, as\nevidence by the matching functions we discuss in further detail in the following section.\n\n**Use of Iodine for C2 DNS Tunneling**\n\nThe iodine DNS tunneling solution is embedded in the DLL that is initially loaded and executed in memory,\nand includes at least the following 15 matching functions:\n\n_Table 3 – Malware DLL Functions_\n\nFor instance, the 64bit executable contains the build_hostname function (Code 2), which corresponds with\nthe older 32bit version (compiled with debug symbols) of iodine 0.6.0 (Code 3):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Code 2- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostname_\n\n_Code 3- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostname_\n\nBased on the presence of the functions base128_blksize_enc and base128_blksize_raw, we determined the\nversion used, while not exactly known, is from before May 2017 when a patch removed those functions.\nFurther, comparative analysis indicates that for the implementation of iodine in this Winnti attack operation,\nthere is no perfect match for the two versions having 64bit pre-compiled binaries. This indicates iodine was\ncompiled from source, and it is reasonable it is being used as a library, and not in its normal distribution\nformat of a standalone executable.\n\nThe DNS Tunneling technique adopted by the malware through the use of iodine is detailed in the figure\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – C2 channel over DNS_\n\n1. The malware generates a hostname and appends it to the embedded C2 dick[.]mooo[.]com, and makes\n\na NULL query to the resulted FQDN (e.g. abcde is appended to .dick[.]mooo[.]com). Notably, NULL and\nTXT DNS request types are iodine’s preferred channels since they are “expected to provide the largest\n_downstream bandwidth”. It is hence not a coincidence that researchers at Ruhr University Bochum also_\nobserved an extensive use of NULL request types for DNS Tunneling purposes in their research.\n2. The infected host sends the DNS query to one of the DNS servers included in the list populated at\n\nruntime, eventually to the OpenDNS fallback server. At this point the DNS server executes a recursive\nDNS query by contacting the Name Servers (NS) of each zone, until the Authoritative NS of\ndick[.]mooo[.]com is obtained. To note, FreeDNS does provide users the capability to delegate the\nauthority of their subdomains to external NS. In the described scenario, attackers delegated the NS of\ntheir subdomain to use their NS as a de-facto C2 server.\n3. The DNS server returns the authoritative answer by forwarding the content of the NULL record type to\n\nthe infected host. Notably, the legit DNS server acts as a proxy between the infected host and the\nmalicious server, by making impossible for defenders the application of any filtering at the Network (L3)\nlevel.\n\n**The NULL DNS record type**\n\nThe implementation of NULL type tunneling can be observed in the following excerpt taken while reversing\nthe malware:\n\nThe third argument when calling dns_encode shall be of the type “struct query”\n\nfrom Iodine’s [dns.c](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/blob/27e5d6fadd997ff167c70a431d41adae26428d41/src/dns.c#L232)\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to [common.h, “struct query” is defined as:](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/blob/27e5d6fadd997ff167c70a431d41adae26428d41/src/common.h#L86)\n\nSince QUERY_NAME_SIZE equals to 512 (4 *128 – integers are 4 bytes) the query[128] call obtained from\nthe reversing activity is indeed the DNS query type.\n\nAs noted, reversing activity detailed the query[128] value to be 0xa. From Iodine’s [windows.h T_NULL is](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/blob/27e5d6fadd997ff167c70a431d41adae26428d41/src/windows.h#L39)\nDNS_TYPE_NULL\n\n[Finally, from Windows’s documentation, DNS_TYPE_NULL is actually a Windows constant equal to 0xa](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dns/dns-constants)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Winnti Signed Code With Digital Certificate from IQ Technology\n\nDuring our analysis of the Winnti sample configured to target the German chemical company, our\ncomparative analysis of other Winnti related drivers revealed a digital certificate issued to IQ Technology, a\nTaiwanese company producing Natural language processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) software.\nThe rootkit driver aligns with the already known driver1.sys. While it is a known TTP that Winnti attributed\nattacks have involved stolen digital certificates for code signing its malware components, the use of this\ncertificate is not publicly discussed, except for a brief report from a security researcher apparently associated\n[with a Vietnamese security company. Although the report is no longer online, the discussed sample contains](https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/a5d6139921576c3aedfc64e2b37ae1a64f3160bd1bb70d4fc7fce956029e7d55?environmentId=2&lang=en)\na compilation timestamp of August 2015, which is the earliest one observed in the wild that we identified\nusing this digital certificate. At the time of analysis, the digital certificate was already revoked.\n\nThe sample’s structure, debug symbols, and explanatory debug messages included within suggests it is\nhighly likely be a development version. Additionally, the compilation timestamp indicates the sample was\ncreated 20 minutes prior to the driver1.sys. Both samples are highly related, and its contents combined with\nthe date of analysis and reporting essentially solidify that it existed in 2015; however, this does not\nnecessarily corroborate to an attack timeframe.\n\n### Sample Targeting South Korean Gaming Company\n\n**HASHES** **Compilation**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n**MD5: 00961922e22e6a5d30b1d6fbd667d3c4**\n\n**SHA1: 0fd54c26b593bd9e9218492d50d8873521c0ec0d**\n\n**SHA256:**\n4209b457f3b42dd2e1e119f2c9dd5b5fb1d063a77b49c7acbae89bbe4e284fb9\n\n_Table 3 – observed network IoCs in Winnti sample_\n\n\n2016-03-07 09:44:01\n\n\nOn 21 February, we detected the new submission of a 64-bit Winnti executable to a public online malware\nscanning service. As multiple researchers have reported, Winnti operators embed the name of their target\ndirectly into the malware, but in an obfuscated manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Binary Analysis**\n\nThe sample resembles the Winnti Dropper Install.exe described by ESET, since it is a command line\nexecutable used to drop and load additional encrypted payload:\n\nUnfortunately we were not able to find the payload meant to be decrypted by this dropper.\n\nHowever, we were able to extract the malware’s configuration file and identify the intended target. In this\ncase, the following string was included within the extracted configuration:\n\nBased on previous knowledge and targeting of the Winnti Group, we assess that this sample was likely used\nto target Gravity Co., Ltd., a South Korean video game company. The company is known for its Massive\n[Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Ragnarok Online, which is also offered as a mobile](http://www.gravity.co.kr/en/games/)\napplication. As we have also reported in the past, the video game industry is one of the preferred targets of\nthe Winnti Group, especially for those companies operating in South Korea and Taiwan. Interestingly, ESET\nresearchers, while reporting on multiple Winnti Group campaigns targeting the video game industry, listed in\ntheir report a C2 server having a Campaign ID GRA KR 0629.\n\n_Excerpt from ESET Research White paper “CONNECTING THE DOTS Exposing the arsenal and methods of_\n_the Winnti Group”_\n\nAt this time, we do not have any further evidence supporting a potential link between the sample we\nanalysed and the C2 detailed by ESET, but the coincidence between the C2 Campaign ID/Location with the\nCampaign ID we extracted from the Winnti dropper is worth noting.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Winnti Group has exhibited their ability to breach different organizations and conduct sophisticated\nattack operations, typically motivated by espionage and financial gain, with various TTPs and malware\ntoolkits. While attribution is not concrete due to the complexity of the group, there are links that can be drawn\nbetween operations which suggest the threat actors purporting the attacks are likely operating within the\nWinnti Group, or at least sharing resources.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe detection of this unreported Winnti variant uploaded to VirusTotal and targeting a German chemical\n[company aligns with our prior observations and research from previous intelligence reporting highlighting](https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/index.html)\nWinnti Group’s interest in German DAX companies. As a result, organizations of all sizes, but especially\nsmall to medium sized companies, including Germany’s hidden champions, should prepare against such\nthreats as they are vital to the economic ecosystem and continuous development of niche markets.\nGovernment oversight (local, regional, and across the EU) should ensure susceptible organizations such as\nthese are following regulation and implementing security best practices to protect against future attacks.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n4209b457f3b42dd2e1e119f2c9dd5b5fb1d063a77b49c7acbae89bbe4e284fb9\n\ncf3a7d4285d65bf8688215407bce1b51d7c6b22497f09021f0fce31cbeb78986\n\n1865013aaca0f12679e35f06c4dad4e00d6372415ee8390b17b4f910fee1f7a2\n\n8ddc6dd9fc3640cd786dfbc72212cd001d9369817aa69e0a2fa25e29560badcf\n\nbfa8948f72061eded548ef683830de068e438a6eaf2da44e0398a37ac3e26860\n\ndf6af36626d375c5e8aff45c64bfc1975d753b109e126a6cb30ee0523550329c\n\n4209b457f3b42dd2e1e119f2c9dd5b5fb1d063a77b49c7acbae89bbe4e284fb9\n\ncf3a7d4285d65bf8688215407bce1b51d7c6b22497f09021f0fce31cbeb78986\n\n1865013aaca0f12679e35f06c4dad4e00d6372415ee8390b17b4f910fee1f7a2\n\n8ddc6dd9fc3640cd786dfbc72212cd001d9369817aa69e0a2fa25e29560badcf\n\nbfa8948f72061eded548ef683830de068e438a6eaf2da44e0398a37ac3e26860\n\ndf6af36626d375c5e8aff45c64bfc1975d753b109e126a6cb30ee0523550329c\n\n*.dick[.]mooo[.]com\n\n208[.]67[.]222[.]222\n\n45[.]248[.]85[.]200\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Recommended Course of Action**\n\n\n-----\n\nPersistence /\nPrivilege\nEscalation\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1215 Kernel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1215/)\nModules and\nExtensions\n\n[T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/)\nExploitation for\nPrivilege\nEscalation\n\n[T1009 Binary](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1009/)\nPadding\n\n[T1014 Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014/)\n\n[T1116 Code](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116/)\nSigning\n\n\nExfiltration [T1022 Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1022/)\nEncrypted\n\n[T1048 Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/)\nOver Alternative\nProtocol\n\n## Join Our Newsletter!\n\n\nAnti-Virus software and Advanced End-Point solution can drastically\nreduce the risk of both techniques.\n\nMany of the samples analysed were signed with expired / revoked\ncertificate.
