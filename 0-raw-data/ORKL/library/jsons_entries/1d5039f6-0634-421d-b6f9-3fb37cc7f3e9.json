    "plain_text": "## CYBER ATTACK TARGETING INDIAN NAVY’S SUBMARINE AND WARSHIP MANUFACTURER\n\n**[3 WEEKS AGO • ARTICLES •](https://cysinfo.com/cyber-attack-targeting-indian-navys-submarine-warship-manufacturer/)**  21\n\n[In my previous blog posts I described attack campaigns targeting Indian government organizations, and Indian Embassies and](https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/)\n\nMinistry of External a�airs. In this blog post I describe a new attack campaign where cyber espionage group targeted the users of\n\n**[Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (also called as ship builder to the nation). Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) is a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazagon_Dock_Limited)**\n\nPublic Sector Undertaking of Government of India (Ministry of Defence) and it specializes in manufacturing warships and submarines\n\nfor the Indian Navy.\n\nIn order to infect the users associated with Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), the attackers distributed spear-phishing\n\nemails containing malicious excel �le which when opened drops a malware capable of spying on infected systems. The email\n\npurported to have been sent from legitimate email ids. The attackers spoofed the email id associated with a Spain based equipment\n\n[manufacturing company Hidrofersa which specializes in designing, manufacturing naval, industrial and mining machinery.](http://hidrofersa.com/?lang=en)\n\n**Overview of the Malicious Emails**\n\n[On 26th January, 2017 Indian Navy displayed its state-of-the-art stealth guided missile destroyer INS Chennai and the indigenously-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Chennai_(D65))\n\n[made Kalvari class Scorpene submarines at the Republic Day parade showcasing India’s military strength and achievements. INS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvari-class_submarine)\n\nChennai and Kalvari class submarines were manufactured by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL).\n\nOn 25th January (day before the Republic day) attackers spoofed an email id associated with Hidrofersa a Spain based company\n\nwhich specializes in designing, manufacturing naval, industrial and mining machinery and the email was sent to the users of\n\nMazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL). The email attachment contained two malicious excel �les (both excel �les turned out to\n\nbe same but used di�erent names). The email was made to look like it was sent by a General service manager of Hidrofersa\n\nenquiring about the product delivery schedule.\n\nBelow screen shot shows the recipients associated with Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), this information was determined\n\nfrom the Email header.\n\nMazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) is listed as one of clients of Hidrofersa (mentioned in Hidrofersa website) and as per their\n\nwebsite Hidrofersa has shipped equipments to Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) in the past as shown in the below screen\n\nshots. This is probably the reason attackers spoofed the email id of Hidrofersa as it is less likely to trigger any suspicion and there is\n\n\n-----\n\nattackers carefully researched (or they already knew about) the trust relationship between these two companies.\n\n\nFrom the email it looks like the goal of the attackers was to infect, take control of the systems of users associated with Mazagon\n\nDock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) and to steal sensitive information (like Product design documents, blueprints, manufacturing\n\nprocesses etc) related to warships and submarines.\n\n**Analysis of Malicious Excel File**\n\nWhen the recipient of the email opens the attached excel �le it prompts the user to enable macro content and the excel also\n\ncontains instruction on how to enable the macros.\n\nOnce the the macro content is enabled, it calls an auto execute function Workbook_Open() which in turn downloads the malware\n\nsample and executes on the system. The malicious macro code was reverse engineered to understand its capabilities. The macro\n\ncode was heavily obfuscated (used obscure variable/function names to make analysis harder) as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nthis technique to delay, divert and confuse the manual analysis.\n\n\nThe macro then decodes a string which runs PowerShell script to download malware from a popular university site located in\n\nIndonesia as shown below. The attackers probably compromised the university website to host the malware. The technique of\n\nhosting malicious code in a university site (legitimate site) has advantages and it is unlikely to trigger any suspicion in security\n\nmonitoring and also can bypass reputation based devices.\n\nThe PowerShell script (shown below) drops the downloaded executable in the %TEMP% directory as “doc6.exe“. It then adds a\n\nregistry entry for the dropped executable and invokes eventvwr.exe, this is an interesting registry hijack technique which allows the\n\ndoc6.exe to be executed by eventvwr.exe with high integrity level and also this technique silently bypasses the UAC (user account\n\n[control). This technique of UAC bypass is mentioned in the blog “Fileless” UAC Bypass Using eventvwr.exe and Registry Hijacking](https://enigma0x3.net/2016/08/15/fileless-uac-bypass-using-eventvwr-exe-and-registry-hijacking/)\n\nNormally when eventvwr.exe process (which is running as high integrity process) is invoked, it starts mmc.exe which opens\n\neventvwr.msc causing the Event Viewer to be displayed. To start mmc.exe, eventvwr.exe searches this registry key\n\n“HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\msc�le\\shell\\open\\command” looking for mmc.exe before looking at HKCR\\msc�le\\shell\\open\\command.\n\nIn this case since this registry “HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\msc�le\\shell\\open\\command” was hijacked to contain the entry for\n\n“doc6.exe”, this will cause the eventvwr.exe process to invoke doc6.exe with high integrity level.\n\nBelow screen shot shows doc6.exe running from the %TEMP% directory\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dropped �le (doc6.exe) was determined as KeyBase malware. This malware can steal and send sensitive information to the\n\nattackers like keystrokes, opened applications, web browsing history, usernames/passwords, upload Desktop screen shots etc. The\n\nfeature of uploading the Desktop screen shot is notable because if the infected user opens a design or design document related to\n\nsubmarines or warships the screen shot of that can be sent to the attacker.\n\nThe attackers also hosted multiple samples of KeyBase malware in the compromised university website. Below screen shot shows\n\nhashes of 25 samples hosted on the university site.\n\n**Analysis of the Dropped Executable (doc6.exe)**\n\nThe dropped �le was analyzed in an isolated environment (without actually allowing it to connect to the c2 server). This section\n\ncontains the behavioral analysis of the dropped executable\n\nOnce the dropped �le (doc6.exe) is executed the malware copies itself into %AllUsersPro�le% directory as “Important.exe”, In\n\naddition to that it also drops two �les “Mails.txt” and “Browsers.txt” into the same directory as shown below.\n\nThe malware then creates a registry value for the the dropped �le (Important.exe), this ensures that malware is executed every time\n\nthe system restarts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware after execution keeps track of the user activity (like applications opened, �les opened etc) but does not immediately\n\ngenerate any network tra�c, this is to make sure that no network activity is generated during automated/sandbox analysis. After\n\nsleeping for a long time malware makes an http connection to the C2 server (command & control server) and sends the tracked user\n\nactivity to the attacker. The below screen shot shows the communication to the C2 server on port 80.\n\n**C2 Communication Pattern**\n\nOnce malware makes an http connection after sleeping for a long time, it sends the system information and the tracked activity to\n\nthe C2 server as http parameters. Below screen shot shows the network communication pattern where the hostname and the\n\nmachine time is sent to C2 server.\n\nBelow screen shot shows a network communication pattern where the opened window title was sent to the C2 server, this pattern\n\nbelow indicates that “test.txt” �le was opened with notepad on the infected system.\n\nBelow screen shot shows a network communication pattern indicating a document named “secret.docx” was opened with Microsoft\n\nWord.\n\nBelow screen shot shows a network communication pattern indicating Internet Explorer was launched on the infected system.\n\nEvery activity on the infected system is sent to the attacker, this allows the attacker to take further action and also since the open\n\nwindow title is sent to attacker, this lets the attacker know about the documents opened and the tools running on the system or if\n\nany analysis tools are used to inspect the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section contains the details of the C2 domain (tripleshop[.]id). All the 25 samples hosted on compromised university site was\n\nanalyzed and it was determined that all these samples also communicated to the C2 domain tripleshop[.]id\n\nThe C2 domain was associated with only one IP address . This IP address is associated with hosting provider in Indonesia as shown\n\nin the screen shots below\n\nBelow screen shot shows the timeline when the IP address was active. The IP was �rst seen to be active on 18th Jan, 2017 (one week\n\nbefore the spear-phishing mail was sent to the victims).\n\n**Threat Intelligence**\n\nEven though attackers tried to make it look like the spear phishing email was sent by an email id associated with Hidrofersa but\n\ninspecting the email headers revealed some interesting information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFreight (PVT) Limited” (combinedfreight[.]com)\n\n\nCombined Freight (PVT) Limited is freight forwarding company which is into ocean & air freight business headquartered in Karachi,\n\nPakistan (as per their website). This company has 4 other o�ces in Pakistan (Lahore, Islamabad, Sialkot, Faisalabad). Below is the\n\nscreen shot taken from their website.\n\nBased on the information mentioned above, It looks like the spoofed email was sent by a user associated with a Pakistan based\n\ncompany Combined Freight (PVT) Limited.\n\n**Indicators Of Compromise**\n\nIn this case the cyber espionage group targeted Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) but it is possible that other defense\n\nequipment manufacturers could also be targeted as part of this attack campaign. The indicators associated with this attack are\n\nprovided so that the organizations (Government, Public, Private organizations, Defense and Defense equipment manufacturers) can\n\nuse these indicators to detect, remediate and investigate this attack campaign.

The following factors in this cyber attack suggests the possible involvement of Pakistan state\n\nsponsored cyber espionage group to steal the intellectual property such as design/blueprints and manufacturing data related to\n\nsubmarines and warships.\n\nVictims/targets chosen (Submarine & Warship manufacturer for Indian Navy)\n\nUse of Email theme related to the targets\n\nTiming of the spear phishing emails sent to the victims (The day before the Republic Day)\n\nEmail header information indicating the possible Pakistan connection\n\nUse of malware that is capable of spying and uploading screen shots\n\n[Use of TTP’s (tactics, techniques & procedures) similar to the previous campaign](https://cysinfo.com/uri-terror-attack-spear-phishing-emails-targeting-indian-embassies-and-indian-mea/)\n\nThe following factors reveal the attackers intention to remain stealthy and the attempt to evade sandbox analysis, manual analysis\n\nand security monitoring at both the desktop and network levels.\n\nUse of obfuscated malicious macro code\n\nUse of junk code (to divert the manual analysis)\n\nUse of compromised university site to host malicious code (to bypass security monitoring)\n\nUse of Silent UAC (user account control) bypass technique\n\nUse of Malware that sleeps for long time without generating any network activity (to evade sandbox analysis)\n\nUse of hosting provider to host C2 infrastructure\n\nCyber espionage groups will continue targeting defense sectors and defense equipment manufacturers for the following reasons:\n\nTo steal defense related information and proprietary product information that can provide their sponsoring governments with\n\nmilitary and economic advantages.\n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the defense technologies to gain advantage over adversary’s military capabilities\n\nTo reduce their research and development costs and produce and sell similar products at lower prices\n\n**References**\n\n[http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/keybase-keylogger-malware-family-exposed/](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/keybase-keylogger-malware-family-exposed/)\n\n[http://www.brycampbell.co.uk/new-blog/2015/7/14/keybase-malware](http://www.brycampbell.co.uk/new-blog/2015/7/14/keybase-malware)\n\nhttp://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/keybase-threat-grows-despite-public-takedown-a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand\nwords/\n\n[https://www.�reeye.com/current-threats/reports-by-industry/aerospace-threat-intelligence.html](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/reports-by-industry/aerospace-threat-intelligence.html)\n\n[Follow us on Twitter: @monnappa22](https://twitter.com/monnappa22) [@cysinfo22](https://twitter.com/cysinfo22)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### MONNAPPA K A\n\n[](https://twitter.com/monnappa22)\n\n\n#### 8 COMMENTS\n\n**RAJESH A**\n\n**February 10, 2017 at 5:46 pm**\n\nThank you Monnappa.\n\nNice articulation.\n\nCyber war is really strong.
