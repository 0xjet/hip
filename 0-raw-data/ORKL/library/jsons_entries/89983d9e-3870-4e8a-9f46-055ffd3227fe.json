To keep things\nsimple, there are three things to know about Zebrocy\n\nZebrocy is an active sub-group of victim profiling and access specialists\nZebrocy maintains a lineage back through 2013, sharing malware artefacts and\nsimilarities with BlackEnergy\nThe past five years of Zebrocy infrastructure, malware set, and targeting have\nsimilarities and overlaps with both the Sofacy and [BlackEnergy APTs, yet](https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/)\nthroughout that time it has remained different from both of those groups\n\nWe originally described a rare “Zebrocy Delphi payload” in late 2015 private reports.\nThat malware set, activity, and infrastructure has greatly expanded. Its malware set has\nbeen coded in a half dozen languages or so. Related activity has gone on for years,\nspearphished hundreds of government, foreign affairs related, and military related\ntargets, and initially was regarded as a Sofacy subset.\n\nEssentially, in our SAS2019 presentation “Zebrocy’s Multilanguage Malware Salad”, we\npublicly provided for the first time original insights on Zebrocy and its characteristics,\nbased on five years of research and private reports on this group:\n\nGame is on – a small new Zebrocy spearphish wave with a new Golang\ndownloader variant was sent out the week before SAS2019\nConsistent profiling and process enumeration reporting behavior has been\nredeveloped and redeployed in Zebrocy backdoors across five+ years\nMultiple bespoke second stage implants perform credential harvesting based on\nstage one process enumeration\nCopy-and-paste coding tendencies\nComplex overlaps with Sofacy and BlackEnergy/GreyEnergy over five years,\nsuggesting a supportive role as a sub-group\nInitial malware development and deployment lineage with BlackEnergy stretches\nback to 2013\n\nWhile Zebrocy has never presented 0day exploits, this group’s lineage comes from notso-humble BlackEnergy and Sofacy beginnings. The group presents an agile and\ncapable malware set, it spearphishing and intrusion activity surged in volume in 2018,\nand their efficacy requires network defenders’ attention.\n\n\n-----\n\nZebrocy shares data points and crosses lines with other clusters of activity in unique and\nunexpected ways. Zebrocy initially shared limited infrastructure, targets, and interests\nwith Sofacy. Zebrocy also shared malware code with past BlackEnergy/Sandworm; and\ntargeting, and later very limited infrastructure with more recent BlackEnergy/GreyEnergy.\nOddly, Turla deployed spearphish macros almost identical to previous, non-public\nZebrocy code in 2018.\n\nIt’s fantastic to see some of these same points being repeated publicly by other research\nteams. A previous claim that Zebrocy distributed Sofacy’s XAgent as a second stage\nimplant remains unsubstantiated but now is replaced with findings identical to these\nfollowing the SAS2019 presentation, so it seems we are all slowly getting on the same\npage.\n\n## A first course with new additions\n\nWhen we originally documented a Zebrocy malware incident in late 2015, we noted an\nOct 2015 AutoIT downloader and a Delphi backdoor payload. Since then, we have noted\na virtual salad of Zebrocy code tossed together, built with a handful of languages, often\nripped from various code sharing sites. Zebrocy activity initiates with spearphishing\noperations delivering various target profilers and downloaders without the use of any\n0day exploits. Browser credential theft, keylogging, and Windows credential theft, along\nwith some incidents of file and communications theft, are all on the list of Zebrocy\nsecond stage implant specials.\n\nThis Zebrocy dish is served before the main course – gaining and maintaining access is\nnot an easy job. And, because the group seems to maintain lineage in both the 0day\ncapable and destructive BlackEnergy/Sandworm APT and the prolific and 0day capable\nSofacy APT, this course is very interesting. Let’s take a more intelligent perspective on\nthe Zebrocy malware set and activity and its lineage, based on reporting provided to our\n[private report customers covering the past five years.](https://usa.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/apt-intelligence-reporting)\n\nIt’s important to note that Zebrocy-related spearphishing activity continued into April\n2019, in the week prior to SAS2019. Recent changes to its [Go downloader variant make](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\nit clear that the Zebrocy malware set is still under active development. And observed\n\n\n-----\n\nactivity continued into late May 2019. This activity is likely to continue throughout 2019.\n\nSince the SAS2019 presentation, we have identified a new Zebrocy backdoor family,\ndeployed with a new downloader. So Zebrocy continues to expand its malware set.\nThere appears to be both a return to C coding for the group, and also an expansion with\nthe [Nim language in its arsenal. We will post a more thorough analysis and reference](https://nim-lang.org/)\nindicators to Securelist in the near future about this downloader, but we expect other\nvendors to see it as well. Zebrocy spearphished a fairly long list of targets throughout the\nworld with a new Nim downloader, and here is a partial list of detection geolocations:\n\nKazakhstan\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nGermany\nKyrgyzstan\nUnited Kingdom\nMyanmar\nSyrian Arab Republic\nUkraine\nAfghanistan\nTanzania\nIran\n\n## Setting a Zebrocy place\n\nA relevant confluence of factors over the past five years is notable in regards to the\ngroup’s lineage. The Zebrocy Delphi payload arrived at the abrupt end of the two year\nDelphocy Delphi based campaign. And it’s important to note that this Delphocy Delphi\nbackdoor was delivered alongside bootkit kernel loader components that maintained the\nsame unique code as the BlackEnergy malware kernel loader. And overall, the malware\nset is innovative when compared to Sofacy, and maintains ongoing unexpected malware\nartefact similarities with BlackEnergy.\n\n\n-----\n\nA set of Zebrocy related events best characterize years of the activity and help to carve\nout the group’s own profile, its lineage, malware set, infrastructure, and modus operandi.\n\nZebrocy lineage – early Sofacy infrastructure overlap (late 2015/early 2016) for the\nZebrocy Delphi backdoor\nZebrocy lineage – Delphocy Delphi deployment and abrupt conclusion (2013 –\nlate 2015), and start of Zebrocy Delphi timeline (late 2015)\nZebrocy lineage – shared, unique kernel code between BlackEnergy and\nDelphocy bootkit (2013 – 2015)\nZebrocy unique malware set – vintage Delphi programming coupled with unusual\nand agile development capabilities with new managed languages like Python, C#,\nand Go all perform screengrab anchor, volume serial number id, systeminfo and\nprocess list collection\nZebrocy ongoing targeting and infrastructure overlap – fairly recent\n[BlackEnergy/GreyEnergy](https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/)\nZebrocy matching spearphish macro artefact overlap – recent Turla\n\nWhen we first reported on the Zebrocy package in early October 2015, this activity was\nnot quite Sofacy and not quite BlackEnergy. Zebrocy spearphished diplomatic targets\nwith a compiled AutoIT script that downloaded a new Delphi payload. This payload was\nunusual, as only the Delphocy backdoors and Madi backdoors from 2012 were well\nknown APT related Delphi malware – Delphi programming itself is an unusually older\nskill. These malware artefacts, and campaign events suggested ties in the malware to\nBlackEnergy, while overlap in infrastructure suggested ties to Sofacy.\n\n## SAS2018 Claims and Predictions\n\n[Last year’s SAS2018 “Masha and these Bears” presentation focused on SPLM/XAgent](https://youtu.be/-7RM_jqSf9I)\nSofacy activity, but included mention of [Zebrocy due to targeting overlap and shared](https://securelist.com/a-slice-of-2017-sofacy-activity/83930/)\ninterests. It was first to record and predict several items:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe full 2018 decline of SPLM/XAgent for the more traditional “Sofacy” activity\nA coincidental new increase in Zebrocy activity\nShared build-id format with BlackEnergy modules\nAn expansion in Zebrocy spearphishing\nAn expansion in the managed languages the Zebrocy malware set is built on\n\nThese predictions later turned into global events, as lighter targeting turned into a\nmassive global surge of Zebrocy activity, sometimes sharing targets between both\nSofacy and Zebrocy. Also later that year, the Zebrocy malware set expanded with C#,\nPython, and Go. This wouldn’t be the first or last time we reported on this group’s\ninnovative malware set.\n\n## Zebrocy Delphi backdoor shared artefacts rooted in Delphocy and BlackEnergy\n\n\n-----\n\nThe limited set of 2013-2015 Delphocy intrusions in Ukraine and Poland deployed a\nDelphi backdoor both with and without a bootkit loader. This bootkit loader included a\nroutine that shares the same compiled code with only the BlackEnergy kernel loaders,\nhelping to tie Zebrocy malware to the BlackEnergy malware set.\n\nThis unique encryption implementation was shared between BlackEnergy’s kernel\nloader, and Delphocy’s bootkit kernel loader code. The appearance of this code overlap\ncoincides with several project events:\n\nEnd of Delphocy/BlackEnergy overlapped code use, while BlackEnergy moved\nforward with other code\nEnd of Delphocy’s user-mode Delphi payload (October 2015)\nStart of Zebrocy’s Delphi payload (October 2015)\n\nA particular chunk of kernel mode code for a custom encryption routine was shared\nacross the older Delphocy bookit and the BlackEnergy malware platform in 2013. While\nDelphocy replaced this bootkit with a simplified user-mode persistence technique,\nBlackEnergy malware continued using this code until late 2015. Then, these APTs\ndiscontinued both the Delphi-based Delphocy project and the use of this mysterious\nchunk of code within BlackEnergy malware. Almost immediately, Delphi-based Zebrocy\nbackdoors began to be deployed. Several months later, a Zebrocy backdoor connected\nback to a domain that was registered by a particular email address. This address had\nbeen used to register another Sofacy domain hosted on a well-known Sofacy IP at the\ntime (rammatica[.]com/raveston[.]com).\n\nNote that both Delphocy’s and BlackEnergy’s kernel mode code appropriated unique\ncontent in 2013 from the Carberp codebase – hashing, injection, bootkit functionality.\nSurprisingly, this same unique encryption cipher was seen pasted again into 2018\nVPNFilter code as well. Clearly it happens with other malware, but Zebrocy’s consistent\ncopy/paste tendency is something not frequently seen in other APT malware with a “best\nuse” date spanning five years or more. Portions of its AutoIT code were copied from\ncode sharing forums and pasted into their own code. This is different from Sofacy’s\ndisappeared and exhaustive SPLM/XAgent codebase. It was used for at least six years\nand was entirely custom-built.\n\n## Zebrocy’s mix\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Zebrocy malware set is tossed together from a wide set of languages and\ntechnologies, including both legitimate and malicious code shared on online forums and\nsites like Github and Pastebin. This repeated “copy/paste” practice is not frequently seen\nin Russian speaking APT malware sets, although open source and penetration\ntesting/red teaming malware are frequently used by other groups, like Empire,\nResponder, BeEF, and Mimikatz. Also unusual, this Zebrocy malware assortment is\nfrequently rebuilt on multiple languages, along with new malware components added to\nthe mix.\n\nAutoIT\nDelphi\nC#\nPowerShell\nGo\nPython\nNim\n\n### AutoIT component\n\nThe group emailed zipped AutoIT attachments to at least a dozen targets in the first\nwave of Zebrocy spearphishing in early October 2015. The group is fairly successful in\nconvincing recipients to open the attachments; generally around half of recipients\nattempted to open them. The AutoIT code is a target profiling component and\ndownloader. It appears to have been developed with copy and paste coding talent from\nAutoIT scripting forums, Github, etc, tossed together from multiple sources. Here are a\nfew:\n\n[AutoIT scripting forums](https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/133224-_filesearch-_foldersearch/)\n[Github](https://github.com/jesobreira/HTTP.au3/blob/master/HTTP.au3)\n[Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/AbzMyg1x)\n\nThe AutoIT executable contains over 60 functions listed in the script, with 10 of the most\ninteresting functions listed here. The same initial profiling functionality is maintained\nalmost four years later in various newer Go and C# downloader variants, with\nscreengrabs, system info and running process collection built into the startup routine of\neach one. Unique victim ID’s, for example, are based on target systems’ volume serial\nnumber and collected and reported to its C2 in its initial connectback for ongoing\ntracking.\n\n\n-----\n\n### C# Zebrocy backdoor\n\nZebrocy pushed a C# backdoor that maintains much the same functionality as its other\nassortment of backdoor implementations.\n\nMost interesting in this implementation is its consistent collection of screengrab and\nsystem information, and a list of running processes. Again, with this first stage backdoor,\nit is profiling its targets and looking for unexpected sources of credential collection to\ndevelop bespoke second stage credential harvesters against. Additionally, Zebrocy\nwheeled out a [Cannon backdoor built on C# throughout 2018.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-continues-global-attacks-wheels-new-cannon-trojan/)\n\n### Delphi backdoor\n\nThe Zebrocy Delphi backdoor has been publicly documented fairly well, but its artefacts\nmay have a more interesting part in the Zebrocy story. Because of the unusual ongoing\npresence of Delphi backdoors in its malware set, early Zebrocy roots appear to be\n\n\n-----\n\nplanted in Delphocy malware deployed to Ukraine and Poland targets from early 2013 to\nlate 2015. Also interesting is the unique encryption cipher implemented in both the 2013\nDelphocy bootkit kernel mode loader and the BlackEnergy kernel modules, along with\nsimple API hashing functions that both shared with Carberp. While Delphocy was\ndeployed for a second version without the bootkit in 2015, the BlackEnergy platform\ncontinued to deploy with the shared kernel loader code until late 2015.\n\nIt does not seem to be merely coincidental that the very last of the BlackEnergy kernel\nmode components sharing this code with the Delphocy-related kernel loaders wilted at\nthe very end of 2015 along with the Delphocy campaigns altogether. This came after the\nDelphocy project delivered a second round of Delphi variants without the bootkit loader.\nMeanwhile, Zebrocy Delphi variants grew from the initial row of Zebrocy Delphi implants\nin October 2015. While it is a loose connection, it seems more than just coincidental to\nobserve unusual Delphi coding end with one activity set and begin with another activity\nset.\n\n### Go\n\nThe group’s Go backdoors continued to be modified and deployed into late March 2019.\nThese backdoors also include a large amount of code included from external sources.\nThey also include the screengrab and system information collection, along with running\nprocess enumeration in order to profile targets and further inform their second stage\ncredential harvesting efforts. Zebrocy Go backdoors have been sent out in waves over\nthe past year, maintaining a variety of project strings seen below. Vitaly Kremez often\nhas concise, [interesting tweets highlighting some of the changes in this Go downloader](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1076044067350429696)\ncode, and [deeper analysis on related Zebrocy malware.](https://www.vkremez.com/2018/12/lets-learn-reviewing-sofacys-zebrocy-c.html)\n\n## A second stage\n\nThese findings were particularly interesting in the light of past claims about\nSPLM/XAgent being the second stage of choice for Zebrocy, for which there was a lot of\nmonitoring on our part, but never any data support. Some guesses were made about\n\n\n-----\n\nwhy that was, perhaps Zebrocy downloaders were all mitigated prior to attempting to\ndownload further stages? But never any answers.\n\nInstead, we arrived at the answers ourselves. In order to account for unexpected\nsoftware installations at victim systems, no matter which language, each first stage\nbackdoor implementation collects a “system information” listing, screengrab, and\nenumerates running processes. This malware behavior was included in Zebrocy\nbackdoors from the very first backdoor that we reported on, and continued into 2019 with\nthe latest rounds of Go backdoors. After collected information is POSTed to the C2, a\nlong delay ensues. Eventually, target systems may receive a custom built second stage\nimplant to retrieve credentials from those unexpected software sources. More unusual\nsoftware packages included little-known customized Chromium builds like CentBrowser\nand 7Star from Asian studios. In some cases, malware password stealers are deployed\nto address more common software.\n\nIn addition, Zebrocy file content stealers and keyloggers coded in C# were detected at\ntargets in 2017 and 2018. Some of this code and their build id value format was\nreviewed in the SAS2018 “Masha and these Bears” presentation.\n\n## Served cold\n\nZebrocy version 2.2 called back to a domain sharing Whois and hosting resources with\nSofacy in early 2016, and later versions used naming and URL constructs very similar to\nBlackEnergy resources. And since then, just like BlackEnergy, mostly all of the Zebrocy\nC2 used no domain registrations. Communications directly to the host over IPv4 with no\ndomain resolution are common behavior for the group’s malware. However, every now\nand then, Zebrocy malware calls back to servers located by hardcoded domain names.\n\nIts ongoing activity demonstrates a long game commitment to gaining access to targeted\nnetworks. And as we predicted at SAS2018 and SAS2019, this latest new Nim coding\nadds to the growing list of languages for this malware set. We will see more from\nZebrocy into 2019 on government and military related organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
