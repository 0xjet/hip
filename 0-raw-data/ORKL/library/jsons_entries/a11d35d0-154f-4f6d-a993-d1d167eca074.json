These tasks include screen taps, gestures, text writing,\nclipboard modification, data pasting, and scrolling up and down.\n\n**On-Device Fraud allows complete takeover of the compromised device**\n\n_Source: ThreatFabric_\nApart from the remote access system, Octo also features a powerful keylogger that can\nmonitor and capture all victims' actions on infected Android devices.\n\nThis includes entered PINs, opened websites, clicks and elements clicked, focus-changing\nevents, and text-changing events.\n\nFinally, Octo supports an extensive list of commands, with the most important being:\n\nBlock push notifications from specified applications\nEnable SMS interception\nDisable sound and temporarily lock the device's screen\n\n\n-----\n\nLaunch a specified application\nStart/stop remote access session\nUpdate list of C2s\nOpen specified URL\nSend SMS with specified text to a specified phone number\n\n## Campaigns and attribution\n\nOcto is sold on forums, such as the Russian-speaking XSS hacking forum, by a threat actor\nusing the alias \"Architect\" or \"goodluck.\"\n\nOf particular note, while most posts on XSS are in Russian, almost all posts between Octo\nand potential subscribers have been written in English.\n\nDue to the extensive similarities with ExoCompact, including Google Play publication\nsuccess, Google Protect disabling function, and the reverse engineering protection system,\nThreatFabric believes there's a good chance that 'Architect' is either the same author or a\nnew owner of ExoCompact's source code.\n\nExoCompact also features a remote access module, albeit a simpler one, also provides\ncommand execution delay options and has a similar admin panel to Octo's.\n\n**Octo's panel**\n\n_Source: ThreatFabric_\n\"Thus, having these facts in mind, we conclude that ExobotCompact was rebranded to Octo\nAndroid banking Trojan and is rented by its owner \"Architect\", also known as \"goodluck\".\nThreatFabric tracks this variant as ExobotCompact.D,\" concludes Threat Fabric in their\nreport.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecent Google Play apps that infected devices with Octo include an app named Fast\nCleaner,\" which had 50,000 installs until February 2022, when it was discovered and\nremoved.\n\n**Fast Cleaner app delivering Octo to victims**\n\n_Source: ThreatFabric_\nOther Octo campaigns relied on sites using fake browser update notices or bogus Play\nStore app update warnings.\n\n**Fake browser update notice pushing Octo installers**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: ThreatFabric_\nSome Octo operators managed to infiltrate the Play Store again after the Fast Cleaner\noperation was over, using an app named \"Pocket Screencaster.\"\n\nThe full list of known Android apps containing the Octo malware is listed below:\n\nPocket Screencaster (com.moh.screen)\nFast Cleaner 2021 (vizeeva.fast.cleaner)\nPlay Store (com.restthe71)\nPostbank Security (com.carbuildz)\nPocket Screencaster (com.cutthousandjs)\nBAWAG PSK Security (com.frontwonder2), and\nPlay Store app install (com.theseeye5)\n\n## A dangerous new breed\n\n[Trojans featuring remote access modules are becoming more common, rendering robust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-malware-escobar-steals-your-google-authenticator-mfa-codes/)\naccount protection steps such as two-factor codes obsolete as the threat actor completely\ncontrols the device and its logged-in accounts.\n\nAnything the user sees on their device's screen becomes within the access of these\nmalware variants, so after infection, no information is safe, and no protection measure is\neffective.\n\nThat said, users need to remain vigilant, keep the number of apps installed on their\nsmartphones at a minimum, and regularly check to ensure Play Protect is enabled.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Top 10 Android banking trojans target apps with 1 billion
