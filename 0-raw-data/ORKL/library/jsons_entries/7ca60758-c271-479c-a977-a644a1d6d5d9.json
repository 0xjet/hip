Abstract\n\nIn December 2017 it was reported that a Middle Eastern oil and gas petrochemical facility [1] had undergone a\nsafety system shutdown as the result of a malware attack. The malware, named TRITON (also known as TRISIS\nor HatMan), went beyond other industrial cyber attacks by directly interacting with a Safety Instrumented System\n(SIS). SIS are the last line of automated safety defense for industrial facilities, designed to prevent equipment\nfailure and catastrophic incidents such as explosions or fire.\n\nBased on the significance of this industrial cyber attack, it warranted an in-depth analysis. We were determined\nto understand the TRITON malware itself, as well as the resources it took to create it. We also sought to gain\ninsights that would help industrial operators defend their control systems from such attacks in the future.\n\nOur challenge was to learn how to turn an undocumented device – the Triconex controller from Schneider\nElectric, which was the target of the attack – into malicious code. To do so we first focused on obtaining the\nTRITON engineering toolset. We combined Internet sleuthing with asking the right people the right questions, to\nobtain the information we needed.\n\nOur next hurdle was obtaining the Triconex controller. Employing a variety of global ecommerce websites, we\npurchased the components needed and assembled them into a working environment. We were unable to find\none key component – the marshalling cables, but we overcame that problem by using brute force to directly\nconnect two panels.\n\nNow that we had a working system, we proceeded to reverse engineer the TriStation suite of software used on\nthe engineering workstation that communicates with the SIS controller. That activity, combined with malware\nanalysis, allowed us to deeply dissect the TriStation proprietary communication protocol used by the Triconex\ncontroller.\n\nOur findings allowed us to develop two new tools [2] to help the ICS community secure Triconex SIS. The first\ntool, the TriStation Protocol Plug-in for Wireshark, allows an engineer to visually see and comprehend\nTriStation communications. It also identifies hardware connected to the safety controller and passively detects\nTRITON activity in network communications.\n\nThe second tool, the Triconex Honeypot Tool, can be used by defense teams to simulate SIS controllers on\nthe network, using them like a honeypot [12] to detect reconnaissance scans and capture malicious payloads.\n\nWhile the TRITON malware attack failed to deliver a malicious OT payload, we successfully used its capabilities\nto implement new programs in the Triconex controller and to execute a malicious payload.\n\nOur research shows that the effort, skills and financial resources needed to create the TRITON malware are not\nthat high – certainly not at the level where nation state-sponsored resources are required. Knowing this, industrial\nasset owners should act immediately to monitor their SIS and secure them against external attacks. We also\nurge SIS equipment makers to provide more robust built-in security for these vitally important systems.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2. Introducing SIS and the TRITON cyber attack\n\n#### 2.1. SIS (Safety Instrumented Systems)\n\n_Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), also known as_ _Industrial Safety Systems, are designed to prevent_\nindustrial incidents, such as equipment or operational failures, from causing damage, injury, loss of life, or\nserious environmental harm. Examples of extreme consequences would be explosions, fires, oil spills, floods\nor even nuclear system meltdowns.\n\nThe equipment used in SIS are a special type of PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) designed with\npredictability and reliability in mind. They include multiple main processors, built-in diagnostics, redundancy\nmanagement systems, and failure detection for inputs and outputs [3]. Best practices for securing SIS include\nrunning them on isolated networks and carefully restricting access rights.\n\nIf out-of-range operating conditions occur, SIS perform control functions that shut the process down in a safe,\npredictable way. Also, while designed to never fail, should an SIS failure actually occur, it will do so in a\npredictable manner. Thus, the worst-case scenario is known and planned for ahead of time.\n\nSIS are the last line of automated defense for industrial facilities, though it should be noted that mechanical\nfail-safes also exist.\n\n#### 2.2. The TRITON cyber attack and why it is important\n\nIn December 2017, FireEye reported [4] that it had recently worked with an industrial operator whose facility was\nattacked by a new type of ICS malware, which they named TRITON (other organizations have named it TRISIS\nor HatMan). [5]\n\nThe attack reprogrammed the facility’s SIS controllers, causing them to enter a failed state, and resulting in an\nautomatic shutdown of the industrial process. The investigation following the shutdown led to the detection of\nthe hacking attempt.\n\nThe targeted facility was subsequently identified as a Saudi Arabian petrochemical processing plant [5], while the\nSIS that was attacked was a Triconex Safety Instrumented System from Schneider Electric. This type of SIS is\ncommissioned in a consistent way across many industries and is widely used. [6]\n\nTRITON is one of only a handful of malware with the ability to impact the physical process of an industrial control\nsystem. Previous examples include _Stuxnet_ [7] (Iran, uranium enrichment centrifuges, 2010) and\n_Industroyer/Crash Override [8] (Ukraine, power grids, 2015 and 2016)._\n\nTRITON goes well beyond earlier attacks and is considered a milestone industrial cyber attack because it directly\ninteracts with, and controls, SIS. It raises the possibility of a cyber attack leading to unpredictable and dangerous\nplant outcomes, without the protection of a last line of safety defense.\n\nBased on the significance of this industrial cyber attack, the Nozomi Networks security research group decided\nto do an in-depth analysis of it. We were determined to understand TRITON and the resources needed to create\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nit. We also sought to gain insights that would help industrial operators defend their control systems from such\nattacks in the future.\n\n#### 2.3. The key components of the attack\n\nThe attack began with penetration of the IT network using well-documented [9], easily-detected attack methods.\nThe attackers moved to the OT (Operational Technology) network through systems that were accessible to both\nenvironments.\n\nOnce on the OT network, the threat actors were able to infect the engineering workstation for the SIS system,\nusually situated in an isolated network segment. The infection probably used a social engineering technique\nwhereby the engineer received or downloaded a file with a legitimate file name, in this case “trilog.exe”. The\nname suggests that the dropper file is a clean executable dealing with something related to Triconex and its\n\nlogging capabilities (TRIconex LOGging filename).\n\nThe main purpose of the dropper file was to deliver the malicious payload into the target, in this case the SIS\ncontroller. Soon after the execution, the dropper connected to the targeted Triconex, injecting the real malware\npayload inside its memory.\n\nThe malware payload was contained in two separate binary files called _inject.bin and_ _imain.bin. One of the_\nactions taken by the dropper was to read, inject and execute these files into the memory of the Triconex.\n\n - **inject.bin contained the code which exploits a specific 0-day in order to execute the content of the file**\n\n\"imain.bin\".\n\n - **imain.bin contained the final code that allows a remote user to gain full control of the SIS device.**\n\nFollowing is reported information about the malicious files involved in the infection phase:\n\n**Filename** **MD5** **Component**\n\n**trilog.exe** 6c39c3f4a08d3d78f2eb973a94bd7718 Dropper\n\n**inject.bin** 0544d425c7555dc4e9d76b571f31f500 Backdoor injector\n\n**imain.bin** 437f135ba179959a580412e564d3107f Backdoor code\n\nThe dropper was developed in Python and compiled inside the trilog.exe executable. It contains the\nimplementation of the TriStation protocol reverse-engineered by the threat actors and used to interact with the\ntargeted device.\n\nThe first action performed by the researchers who got the TRITON sample was to decompile the executable,\nextract the Python code, and use it as the starting point for the further analysis.\n\n3\n\n|Filename|MD5|Component|\n|---|---|---|\n|trilog.exe|6c39c3f4a08d3d78f2eb973a94bd7718|Dropper|\n|inject.bin|0544d425c7555dc4e9d76b571f31f500|Backdoor injector|\n|imain.bin|437f135ba179959a580412e564d3107f|Backdoor code|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 - A schematic view of the dropper phase of TRITON_\n\n### 3. Understanding TRITON through Reverse Engineering\n\n#### 3.1. Turning an ‘Undocumented Device’ into malicious code\n\nDespite the routine techniques employed to gain access to the victim’s OT environment, the threat actors behind\nthe TRITON malware attack had to go through a significant learning curve. They had to learn about the Triconex\nSIS controller itself and TriStation, the proprietary network communication protocol it uses.\n\nObtaining both the Triconex hardware and software related to it was essential for recreating the full working\nenvironment needed for experimenting and writing malicious code. With a working system, the threat actors\nwere able to intercept and analyze traffic transmitted on the wire. They were also able to reverse engineer the\nTriStation software.\n\nBoth methods were needed to dissect the proprietary protocol, extracting information from it and re-implementing\nit inside TRITON.\n\nTo study TRITON ourselves, we needed to recreate the targeted SIS in our lab environment and obtain as much\n\ndocumented information as possible about its functioning and communications. The following sections describe\nhow we went about this.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.2. Obtaining the TRITON engineering toolset\n\nWe used multiple channels to procure the necessary components, as follows:\n\n - Vendor website – the Schneider Electric website contains useful information\n\n - Consultation with key experts – sometimes asking the right person, nicely, is effective\n\n - Asset owners – operations and security staff are our friends – and the best sources of information!\n\n - Internet searches – there is a lot of freely available information, such as:\n\n   - Installation CDs sold on e-commerce sites\n   - Loose executables & archives on forum sites\n   - Open directories, FTP servers, etc.\n\nIn short, a combination of Internet sleuthing and asking the right people the right questions allowed us to obtain\n\na great deal of the information required.\n\n#### 3.3. Obtaining the Triconex controller\n\nOf course, the key item we needed was a Triconex controller. This is where “free” ended and we had to spend\n\nsome money. A budget of $5-10K is required – the reality is that most ICS equipment is expensive.\n\nAnother thing we took into consideration was getting multiple copies of the controller for teardown purposes –\nand in case we bricked (damaged) one, and it no longer worked.\n\nHere are some of the sources we considered for acquiring the SIS controller:\n\n   - From the vendor – it’s possible to buy new equipment directly from Schneider Electric, but it is not the\n\nleast expensive way.\n\n   - From online e-commerce sites such as eBay or Alibaba – we found components and used devices on\n\nthese sites. In some cases, new ones were listed for sale, including full-warranties.\n\nWe needed to keep in mind that the systems had to be compatible for everything to work together, and we\nneeded the same model that was used in the TRITON attack. The TRITON vulnerable SIS controllers are:\n\n  - Triconex MP3008 main processor modules running firmware versions 10.0–10.4 [3]\n\nNote that these models of the Triconex use a _MPC860 PowerPC processor. Newer models use a different_\nprocessor (ARM) and are thus not vulnerable to the version of TRITON we studied.\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nThe equipment used for our research is described below.\n\nMain Low-Density Chassis:\n\n  - 1.02 3008/N Tricon Enhanced Main Processor v10.3 - Firmware Meta Number: ETSX6236\n\n  - 1.05 4329/N/G NCM (Network Communications Module)\n\n  - 1.09 3503/E/EN Discrete Input, 24 V, 32 points\n\n  - 1.10 Marshalling Connector 2652 -310 DO\n\n  - 1.12 3604/E/EN Discrete Output, 24 VDC, 16 points\n\n  - Terminator Panel 2652-1\n\nWe also tested the injection phase and did some analysis with the 3008/N Tricon Enhanced Main Processor\n\nv9.10 BUILD 66.\n\nOne item needed was the marshalling cables, which are used to connect the terminal panel to the connector\nmodule. This allows communication with field devices through the digital output module.\n\n  - We wanted to get this communication to work so that we could test variations of TRITON that would\nsucceed in delivering commands that disrupt the safety process, as described in Section 5.\n\nIt turned out to be the only equipment challenge we had – it seems marshalling cables are very hard to find.\n\n_Figure 2 - Marshalling cables were impossible to locate_\n\nSince we were unable to locate the cables, the only solution was to manually, using brute force, connect the\n\nterminal panel directly to the connector module. Fortunately, it worked!\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 - Lacking the marshalling cables, these two boards were directly connected._\n\n#### 3.4. Reverse engineering the TriStation suite\n\nThe software installed on the engineering workstation is a gold mine for threat actors because it contains all the\ninformation needed to interact with the controller, including how to recognize different statuses and attached\nmodules. TriStation 1131 v4.9.0 (build 117) is able to connect with the hardware version targeted by the malware,\nand all of our analysis has been performed on that version.\n\nThe Schneider Development Team has kindly included useful information about their files – which unfortunately\ncan also be used by an attacker to better understand the software architecture and its general structure.\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nStarting with a detailed description of every file installed by the software, it is quite simple to understand where\nto look for different components.\n\n_Figure 4 - The TriStation suite files are nicely identified_\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.5. Undocumented power users\n\nThe TriStation software also stores project files containing key information about the Triconex program,\n\nconfiguration and behavior inside a password-protected file with .PT2 extension. The assumption is that only\nauthorized engineers can access the project files containing the proprietary code executed inside the SIS\ndevices.\n\nHowever, the TriStation software v4.9.0 (and prior versions), also contain two undocumented power users able\n\nto open any project file regardless of the robustness of its password. These users are likely used by the product\nsupport team to help customers with technical issues. While having operational value, these users can also be\nabused by threat actors to access password-protected project documents without the proper credentials.\n\nThe two undocumented users are:\n_T****FD_\n\n_T****BD_\n\nFor user _T****FD, the login requires a password that is available through reverse engineering and additional_\nauthentication in the form of a support ticket number. This confirms that the role of the user is for customer\nsupport purposes.\n\n\n_Figure 5 – Undocumented user T****FD requires the extra step of a support ticket number to login_\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nUser T****BD however, has the capability to access a project file just by inserting the hard-coded credentials\nextracted from the TriStation software.\n\n_Figure 6 – Undocumented user T****BD accessing a password protected project file with its static password_\n\nOnce user T****BD is logged in, a hidden menu is enabled that is not available to other users.\n\n_Figure 7 – A hidden menu is enabled after logging-in as user T****BD_\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom an attacker’s prospective, this scenario could be useful. The hidden menu provides access to a great\nnumber of extra features not available to a normal user.\n\nMoreover, when logged as _T****BD, the TriStation software exposes internal information about the_\nlinking/compilation phases of the system logic. This additional data has a high value for threat actors because it\ndescribes in detail the commands involved during program compilation.\n\n_Figure 7 – The difference between the information available to a normal user (left)_\n\n_and the undocumented power user T****BD (right)_\n\nThe level of information available to this undocumented power user makes it significantly easier for threat actors\nto create malicious OT payloads. However, our research found no connection between the TRITON malware\nand this hidden menu, and the malware did not leverage these undocumented users.\n\nIt should be noted that these undocumented users exist for _TriStation 1131 v4.9.0_ and earlier versions only,\naccording to Schneider Electric.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.6. Understanding the TriStation protocol\n\nIn accordance with the file descriptions, the code delegated to manage the network communication is located\n\ninside the DLL “tr1com.dll”. By analyzing this file, we extracted a wealth of information about the protocol’s\ndefinition that documents its behavior.\n\n_Figure 8 - Decompiled code showing low-level packet management_\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.7. Parsing the Triconex hardware definition\n\nThe Low-Density and High-Density chassis used by the Triconex hardware supports several different modules\n\nwhich are described inside a proprietary file called “TR1HWDEF.HWD”. The malware does not contain any\ninformation related to the hardware definition, probably because the threat actors did not invest time to reverse\nengineer that part.\n\nHowever, the definition file contains useful information for network traffic analysis that identifies which modules\n\nare attached to the remote Triconex hardware.\n\nWe invested time in reverse engineering, and successfully parsed the hardware information. The details are\ngiven in Appendix A – Triconex Hardware Definition List.\n\n_Figure 9 - Automatic parsing of the file that describes Triconex hardware information_\n\nWe also added this parsing capability to our Wireshark dissector (see section 4.1), which thus provides\ninformation about deployed Triconex hardware modules.\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.8. TriStation protocol stack implementation\n\nTriStation is not only the software suite used inside the engineering workstation. There is also a proprietary\n\nnetwork protocol called “TriStation Protocol” operating on UDP/IP over port 1502.\n\nThe malware files related to TriStation implementation are found inside these files:\n\n**Filename** **MD5** **Compilation time**\n\nTsBase.pyc 288166952f934146be172f6353e9a1f5 2017-08-03 16:52:33\n\nTsHi.pyc 27c69aa39024d21ea109cc9c9d944a04 2017-08-04 08:04:01\n\nTsLow.pyc f6b3a73c8c87506acda430671360ce15 2017-08-03 16:46:51\n\nTS_cnames.pyc e98f4f3505f05bf90e17554fbc97bba9 2017-08-03 12:26:36\n\nAll the protocol definitions are contained inside the Python-compiled file “TS_cnames.pyc” and can be easily\ndecompiled and extracted as shown in the image below. The code contained in the file is a great explanation of\nthe function codes implemented by the TriStation protocol, showing how deep the threat actors went during\nreverse engineering.\n\n_Figure 10 - Part of TRITON’s Python code, showing TriStation protocol states_\n\n14\n\n|Filename|MD5|Compilation time|\n|---|---|---|\n|TsBase.pyc|288166952f934146be172f6353e9a1f5|2017-08-03 16:52:33|\n|TsHi.pyc|27c69aa39024d21ea109cc9c9d944a04|2017-08-04 08:04:01|\n|TsLow.pyc|f6b3a73c8c87506acda430671360ce15|2017-08-03 16:46:51|\n|TS_cnames.pyc|e98f4f3505f05bf90e17554fbc97bba9|2017-08-03 12:26:36|\n\n\n-----\n\nCombining the malware analysis with reverse engineering activity performed with the workstation software, we\nwere able to deeply dissect the TriStation protocol. It allows for communications between engineering\nworkstations (consumer) and Triconex controllers (producer), equipped with specific network modules (NCM).\n\nThrough our reverse engineering of the Triconex we were able to develop tools for helping industrial\norganizations and researchers understand SIS communications (section 3.6), and create and demonstrate a\nmalicious TRITON payload (section 5).\n\n### 4. Defending against TRITON: new tools to help \n\n#### 4.1. Wireshark dissector (LUA script) for TriStation protocol\n\nDuring our analysis, we developed an extended Wireshark dissector using Lua script, called the **_TriStation_**\n\n**_Protocol Plug-in for Wireshark._** [2]\n\nIt offers several useful features for engineers working with the TriStation protocol:\n\n - Indication of the direction of communication\n\n - Function codes translated as descriptive text\n\n - Extraction of transmitted PLC programs\n\n - Identification of connected hardware\n\n - Detection of the TRITON malware in network communications\n\n - […]\n\n_Figure 11 - The TriStation protocol plug-in for Wireshark detects a sample of TRITON during the injection phase_\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nOur Wireshark dissector allows an ICS engineer to see useful information during a network packet inspection.\nThis includes the direction of the packet and the name associated with the function code (also known as a\n“command”). It also easily parses the packets, extracting the PLC programs/functions downloaded to the\nTriconex devices, and presenting them in the Wireshark GUI.\n\nFurthermore, the dissector automatically detects TRITON malware using specific indicators obtained during\nmalware analysis performed in the laboratory. This feature was developed **only with the purpose of**\ndemonstrating that it’s possible to identify ICS malware on the network using passive techniques.\n\nWe strongly recommend that organizations do not depend on Wireshark for intrusion detection. If the threat\nactors change just one byte of the malware, it will not be detected. Instead, applications specifically designed\nfor detecting ICS malware intrusion, which use multiple techniques for identifying irregularities, should be\nemployed.\n\n#### 4.2. Triconex Honeypot Tool: simulating a real Triconex Controller\n\nThe extensive knowledge we gained during our analysis allowed us to develop a tool [2] that simulates a Triconex\ncontroller. This tool was created to help us during the deep inspection of specific packets related to how the\n\nhardware modules and the modules’ LEDs information are encoded inside the packets.\n\nThe main goal was to create a script that simulates a Triconex controller and responds to the TriStation\ndiagnostic software developed by Schneider Electric. This diagnostic tool can be used by an OT engineer to\nquery a specific controller deployed in the field and obtain its information.\n\nUsing our script, we simulated the controller’s behavior, convincing the diagnostic tool that we are a real\ncontroller sending its status, including:\n\n  - Controller version\n\n  - Controller status\n\n  - Controller memory\n\n  - Chassis type\n\n  - Connected modules\n\n  - Status LEDs\n\n  - LED type and color\n\n  - Hardware key position (RUN/STOP/PROGRAM)\n\n  - Project name\n\n  - Modules configuration match/mismatch (project  chassis)\n\nAlthough the script is currently only a proof-of-concept, it can be expanded to support an extensive number of\n\nfunctions. Its realism can be increased to the point where it is indistinguishable from a real controller. In addition,\n\nthe script can be executed by a regular, inexpensive computer attached to the network.\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Triconex Honeypot Tool can be used by defense teams to simulate SIS controllers with particular system\nconfigurations, using them like a honeypot [12] to detect reconnaissance scans and capture malicious payloads.\nIt can therefore play a useful role in detecting unknown traffic targeting a SIS network.\n\n### 5. Demonstrating a working malicious TRITON payload\n\n#### 5.1. TRITON’s malicious payload was missing\n\nTRITON gave the threat actor the ability to read, write and execute code directly inside the controller’s memory.\nThe main advantage of this architecture was its modularity, providing the attackers the means to dynamically\nsend a specific payload inside the memory and execute it.\n\nBut this approach also assists the security analyst or researcher, as the malware itself exposes the basic\n\ncapabilities for low-level interaction with the OT device.\n\nIn the case of TRITON, the final stage of the attack is missing [10]. Soon after the targeted Triconex was\nimplanted with the malware, one of the main processors triggered a redundancy alarm. This forced all three\nmain processors to start the safety shutdown process. It is unclear whether the issue was triggered by the\ndropper injecting the malware in memory, or by an unexpected fault generated while executing the OT payload.\n\nThe targeted version of the Triconex hardware is running a CPU based on the PowerPC architecture. During\nprogram updates, the code is sent directly in machine code. The malware author followed this technique,\ndeveloping the ability to write and execute directly in the memory itself.\n\nOne of the more likely assumptions is that the attacker injected a specific OT payload containing an invalid\nmemory access which resulted in a crash.\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5.2. Demonstrating a working TRITON malicious payload\n\n_Figure 3 – Working Triconex infrastructure used to demonstrate successful TRITON OT infection_\n\nDuring our research we recreated a fully working Triconex infrastructure, including connecting a field device to\n\nthe controller. We attached a compressor and a balloon, similar to the set-up first used to demonstrate the\nStuxnet ICS malware. [11]\n\nThe program run by the controller supervises the compressor executing an inflating and deflating process in a\nspecific, synchronized and ongoing way. Then we used the TRITON capabilities to inject a command that\n\nmodified the behavior of the security supervisor, causing the balloon to overinflate and finally generate an\n\nexplosion.\n\nThis achieved the final goal of our research, showing how we were able to use the knowledge we obtained\nthrough reverse engineering TRITON to compromise the safe functioning of the Triconex controller.\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\n### 6. What TRITON means for securing Industrial Control Systems\n\nOver the last twenty years it has become easier and easier for threat actors to launch ICS cyber attacks. More\nand more tools and examples are readily available, lowering the bar for the knowledge and skills needed by\nintruders.\n\n_Figure 14 - Developing malware for ICS requires less skills today than it did in the past._\n\nFor example, before Stuxnet (2010), there were no example ICS malware frameworks available over the\n\nInternet. Now, there are many, including TRITON. Other things that have changed include:\n\n   - Global ecommerce platforms that make it easy to buy the documentation and equipment needed to\nrecreate a SIS environment\n\n   - A rapid increase in the number of disclosed ICS vulnerabilities\n\n   - Shodan and similar search engines which make it easy to find Internet-connected ICS devices\n\n   - Increased connectivity with IT and Internet-based systems has greatly increased the attack surface\n\nWhen we began our research, we were determined to understand TRITON and the resources it took to create\nit. This paper shows that the effort, skills and financial resources needed to create the TRITON malware\n\nframework, while not insignificant, are not that high – certainly not at the level where nation state-sponsored\nresources are required. While the level of difficulty of executing a cyber attack varies according to the cyber\nsecurity defenses, networking architecture and equipment of each facility, the development of the malware itself\ndoes not require high levels of resources.\n\nKnowing this, industrial asset owners should act immediately to monitor their SIS and secure them against\nexternal attacks. We also urge SIS equipment makers to provide more robust built-in security for these vitally\nimportant systems.\n\n19\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A – Triconex Hardware Definition List\n\n1 3501/E/T/TN
