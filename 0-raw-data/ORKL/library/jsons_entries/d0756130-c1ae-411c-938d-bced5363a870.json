hackers\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mimecast-links-security-breach-to-solarwinds-hackers/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mimecast-links-security-breach-to-solarwinds-hackers/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJanuary 26, 2021\n10:01 AM\n0\n\nEmail security company Mimecast has confirmed today that the threat actor behind the\nSolarWinds supply-chain attack is behind the security breach it disclosed earlier this month.\n\n\"Our investigation has now confirmed that this incident is related to the SolarWinds Orion\nsoftware compromise and was perpetrated by the same sophisticated threat actor,\"\nMimecast [said.](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-security-update/)\n\n\"Our investigation also showed that the threat actor accessed, and potentially exfiltrated,\ncertain encrypted service account credentials created by customers hosted in the United\nStates and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"These credentials establish connections from Mimecast tenants to on-premise and cloud\nservices, which include LDAP, Azure Active Directory, Exchange Web Services, POP3\njournaling, and SMTP-authenticated delivery routes.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe company added that there is no evidence that any of the encrypted\ncredentials accessed during the breach were decrypted or misused.\n\nHowever, United States and United Kingdom Mimecast customers are advised to reset\ncredentials to prevent potential attacks from abusing them.\n\nThe threat actor that coordinated the SolarWinds supply-chain attacks is tracked as\n[StellarParticle (CrowdStrike), UNC2452 (FireEye),](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-sunspot-malware-found-while-investigating-solarwinds-hack/) [SolarStorm (Palo Alto Unit 42), and Dark](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/)\nHalo (Volexity).\n\nWhile its identity remains unknown, a joint statement issued by the FBI, CISA, ODNI, and\nthe NSA says that it is [likely a Russian-backed Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-says-russian-state-hackers-likely-behind-solarwinds-hack/)\n\nKaspersky also made a connection between the Russian Turla hacking group and the\n[SolarWinds hackers after finding feature overlaps between the Sunburst backdoor and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fireeye-microsoft-create-kill-switch-for-solarwinds-backdoor/)\nKazuar backdoor linked to Turla in the past.\n\n## Attack discovered following a Microsoft notification\n\n[The company was alerted by Microsoft that some of its self-issued certificates customers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mimecast-discloses-microsoft-365-ssl-certificate-compromise/)\nuse to authenticate to a subset of Mimecast’s products were compromised.\n\nWhile the exact number of affected customers using the stolen certificates to secure the\nconnection to the Microsoft 365 cloud was not disclosed, Mimecast said that roughly 10\npercent of their customers \"use this connection.\"\n\nMimecast's products are currently used by more than 36,000 customers, with 10% of them\namounting to roughly 3,600 impacted customers.\n\nThe company found evidence that \"a low single-digit number of our customers' M365\ntenants were targeted\" by the SolarWinds hackers.\n\nMimecast reached out to these customers to remediate and address this issue and,\naccording to today's update, \"[t]he vast majority of these customers have taken this action,\nand Microsoft has now disabled use of the former connection keys for all affected Mimecast\ncustomers.\"\n\n[One week ago, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes also confirmed that the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malwarebytes-says-solarwinds-hackers-accessed-its-internal-emails/)\nSolarWinds hackers were able to gain access to some internal company emails.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[T-Mobile confirms Lapsus$ hackers breached internal
