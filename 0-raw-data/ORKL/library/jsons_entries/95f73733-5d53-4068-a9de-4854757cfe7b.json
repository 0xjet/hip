    "plain_text": "# Weekly TrickBot Analysis - End of w/c 22-Jan-2018 to 1000119\n\n**[escinsecurity.blogspot.de/2018/01/weekly-trickbot-analysis-end-of-wc-22.html](https://escinsecurity.blogspot.de/2018/01/weekly-trickbot-analysis-end-of-wc-22.html)**\n\nHere are the results of my analysis of TrickBot Banking Trojan mcconfs shared up to the end\nof the week commencing 22nd January 2018. This analysis covers 1,302 unique C2 IP\n**addresses used in 255 mcconfs across 118 versions, with a highest version of 1000119.**\n\nThe following graph shows the rate of discovery of TrickBot versions in the wild, based on\nshared mcconfs. (Note: The flatter the line, the more frequently versions are discovered.)\n\nSeven versions were discovered in the week commencing 22th January 2018 (A-1000116,\nA-1000117, A-1000118, A-1000119, B-1000027, B-1000028, and B-1000029), two the week\nbefore, and four the week before that. Four of the discovered versions extend the original\niteration of version numbers (which I refer to as iteration A), taking this to 1000119. Three\nshared versions extend the six repeats from the last two months, where low (1000021 to\n1000026) version numbers are reused. (I track these as part of a new, distinct iteration,\niteration B, of the version numbers.)\n\nThe following graph shows the number of server entries using ports:\n\n443 (HTTPS);\n445 (IBM AS Server Mapper) -- INACTIVE;\n449 (Cray Network Semaphore Server); and\n451 (SMB) -- INACTIVE.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis week s iteration A configs increased the count of C2 server entries back to a level last\nseen at the start of January. The iteration B configs seen continue the low C2 server count\nwhich has typified iteration B.\n\nThe following table shows the top 25 servers (of 1,302 unique) used within the 118 versions.\nThis table changes for the first time in five weeks with the introduction of\n94[.]127[.]111[.]14[:]449 into the top 25 due to its use between versions 1000109 and\n1000116.\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of detected TrickBot campaign 'gtag' (group tags)\nvalues used in the 255 mcconfs analysed.\n\n\n-----\n\n97 C2 servers were used in the mcconfs from this week, of which 84 (87%) were new. The\nBGP prefix registrations for the C2 server IP addresses continue to be heavily biased to ASN\nrouted through RU (and so the graph below's Y-axis is cut short to allow clearer viewing of\nother country counts). The new servers' IP addresses are associated with ASN routed to:\n64xRU, 10xNL, 3xIN, 3xLU, 2xPL, 1xCH, and 1xUS.\n\nThe following map shows the geographical location of 85 (scanned by Shodan) of the 97 IP\naddresses used in the analysed configs.\n\nFive of these servers are MikroTik devices (historically a favourite of TrickBot), one is an\n**ER-X and one is a NanoStation Loco M5.**\n\n49 are running OpenSSH, 25 are running nginx, 16 are running Apache, eight are\nrunning Exim, eight are running Postfix, four are running MySQL, four are running\n**ProFTPD, one is running ARK, one is running Dropbear SSH, one is running IIS, one is**\nrunning Squid Proxy -- with some servers running as many as four of these products.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following table shows the BGP allocations of C2 servers' IP addresses to country by\nTrickBot version.\n\nFinally, the following table shows the top 25 BGP prefixes used by TrickBot for C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThanks\nto [@mpvillafranca94,](https://twitter.com/mpvillafranca94/) [@JR0driguezB,](https://twitter.com/JR0driguezB/) [@0bscureC0de,](https://twitter.com/0bscureC0de/) [@virsoz,](https://twitter.com/virsoz/) [@spalomaresg,](https://twitter.com/spalomaresg/) [@VK_Intel,](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/)\n[@K_N1kolenko,](https://twitter.com/K_N1kolenko/) [@hasherezade,](https://twitter.com/hasherezade/) [@botNET___,](https://twitter.com/botNET___/) [@ArnaudDlms,](https://twitter.com/ArnaudDlms/) [@StackGazer,@voidm4p,](https://twitter.com/StackGazer/)\n[@James_inthe_box,](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/) [@MakFLwana,](https://twitter.com/MakFLwana/) [@_ddoxer,](https://twitter.com/_ddoxer/) [@moutonplacide,](https://twitter.com/moutonplacide/) [@JasonMilletary,@Ring0](https://twitter.com/JasonMilletary/)\nx0, [@precisionsec,](https://twitter.com/precisionsec/) [@Techhelplistcom,](https://twitter.com/Techhelplistcom/) [@pollo290987,](https://twitter.com/pollo290987/) [@MalHunters,](https://twitter.com/MalHunters/) [@coldshell,](https://twitter.com/coldshell/) [@0x7fff9 and](https://twitter.com/0x7fff9/)\n[@MalwareSecrets for sharing the mcconfs.](https://twitter.com/MalwareSecrets/)\n\n\n-----",
