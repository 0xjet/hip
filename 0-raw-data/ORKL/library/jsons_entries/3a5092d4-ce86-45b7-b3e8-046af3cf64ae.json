When you hear terms like Ebury, CDorked, Calfbot and others, they\nare all related to each other.\n\nOver the last few years, our team has been handling and fixing compromised servers and we\ncan attest to how complex the clean up for this infection can be. We’ve seen that the servers\nwe’ve fixed have been misused for distribution of malware, SPAM and, in some cases, to\nsteal credit cards on compromised web servers used for e-commerce.\n\nWindigo Timeline\n\nThe timeline released by ESET matches what we have been seeing and it goes back to 2011\nwhen Linux/eBury was first seen. It goes through many evolutions, including our joint\nanalysis of [CDORKED on 2013 and the SSH backdoors:](https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/apache-binary-backdoors-on-cpanel-based-servers.html)\n\nWindigo Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\nIf you run a Linux server and you are worried it might be infected, they provide a few\ntechniques (indicators of compromise) to check if the server is hacked.\n\n**For Linux/Ebury. Run the ssh -g command. If it returns an error about missing**\nargument, you know you are compromised.\n**For Linux/CDorked. Run curl to favicon.iso and see if you get redirected to**\nGoogle.com. If you do, you know you are compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese apply to the latest versions of the malware. Old versions have different indicators and\nwe explain them on our previous blog posts. Note that with the release of this document, the\nmalware authors will likely change operations and the behavior of the code. So do not expect\nit to last long.\n\nWe recommend reading the whole PDF here: http://www.welivesecurity.com/wpcontent/uploads/2014/03/operation_windigo.pdf\n\n**If you need help cleaning up a compromised Linux server,** **[let us know.](http://sucuri.net/signup)**\n\n\n-----",
