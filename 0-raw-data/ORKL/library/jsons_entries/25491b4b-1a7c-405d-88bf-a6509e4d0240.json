The legal victory also highlights a Chinese Internet service\nthat experts say has long been associated with targeted, espionage attacks against U.S. and\nEuropean corporations.\n\nMailing List\n\n[Subscribe here](https://krebsonsecurity.com/subscribe/)\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\nSpam Nation\n\n\n-----\n\nA New York Times Bestseller!\n\nThinking of a Cybersecurity Career?\n\nRead this\n\n\n-----\n\nAll About Skimmers\n\nClick image for my skimmer series.\n\nStory Categories\n\n[A Little Sunshine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sunshine/)\n[All About Skimmers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/all-about-skimmers/)\n[Ashley Madison breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ashley-madison-breach/)\n[Breadcrumbs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/breadcrumbs/)\n[Data Breaches](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/data-breaches/)\n[DDoS-for-Hire](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ddos-for-hire/)\n[Employment Fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/employment-fraud/)\n[How to Break Into Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/how-to-break-into-security/)\n[Latest Warnings](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/latest-warnings/)\n[Ne'er-Do-Well News](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/neer-do-well-news/)\n[Other](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/other/)\n[Pharma Wars](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/pharma-wars/)\n[Ransomware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ransomware/)\n[Russia's War on Ukraine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/russias-war-on-ukraine/)\n[Security Tools](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/security-tools/)\n[SIM Swapping](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sim-swapping/)\n[Spam Nation](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/spam-nation/)\n[Target: Small Businesses](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/)\n[Tax Refund Fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/tax-refund-fraud/)\n[The Coming Storm](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/comingstorm/)\n[Time to Patch](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/patches/)\n[Web Fraud 2.0](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/web-fraud-2-0/)\n\nThe Value of a Hacked PC\n\n\n-----\n\nBadguy uses for your PC\n\nBadguy Uses for Your Email\n\nYour email account may be worth far more than you imagine.\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nCategory: Web Fraud 2.0\n\nInnovations from the Underground\n\n\n-----\n\nID Protection Services Examined\n\nIs Antivirus Dead?\n\nThe reasons for its decline\n\nThe Growing Tax Fraud Menace\n\nFile 'em Before the Bad Guys Can\n\nInside a Carding Shop\n\n\n-----\n\nA crash course in carding.\n\nBeware Social Security Fraud\n\nSign up, or Be Signed Up!\n\nHow Was Your Card Stolen?\n\n\n-----\n\nFinding out is not so easy.\n\nKrebs’s 3 Rules…\n\n...For Online Safety.\n\n\n-----",
