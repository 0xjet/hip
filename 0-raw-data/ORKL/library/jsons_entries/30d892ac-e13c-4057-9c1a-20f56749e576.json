INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the last decade, significant advancements have been made in how industrial control systems (ICSs) monitor,\ncontrol, and manage an organization’s infrastructure. Implementation of substation-hardened Ethernet local-area\nnetworks (LANs) has paved the way for more precise and sophisticated tools for retrieving and analyzing critical\nreal-time system information. The advanced capabilities of today’s modern digital measurement and control\nintelligent electronic devices (IEDs), coupled with the implementation of Ethernet access directly from the device,\nhas opened the door for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) services to access an\nunprecedented amount of data from these devices.\nIEC 61850 provides high-speed peer-to-peer communications between IEDs, enabling faster and more accurate\ncontrol and restoration in the event of network disturbances. IEEE C37.118 synchrophasors and IEC 61850-9-2\nSampled Values provide high-speed sampling of real-time data directly from the secondary source with\nmillisecond accuracy.\nWhile this information has traditionally been firmly in the domain of the operational technology (OT) network,\na wider audience has seen the need to bridge the gap between OT and information technology (IT) networks.\nWhile IEC 61850 and other Ethernet-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) protocols operate\nat the machine-to-machine (M2M) level, a large portion of network activity now involves person-to-machine\n(P2M) interconnectivity [1].\nThe demand for access to these data is skyrocketing as more organizational departments use an array of services\nfor a variety of purposes, such as for analyzing post-event disturbance records, accessing metering data, and\ngaining secure access directly to a device for diagnostics and troubleshooting to ensure that the highest possible\nservice availability is maintained. This, of course, inevitably raises the specter of cybersecurity and how the\ntraditional Ethernet network deals with securing critical infrastructure information. The fifth version of the North\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) reliability standards\n(known as CIP Version 5) outlines a set of requirements for securing the traditional LAN from unwanted intrusions\nand attacks. The impact of such attacks has been well documented in the past.\nRecent research has shown that software-defined networking (SDN) can provide far better packet delivery\nperformance, greater cybersecurity, and greater centralized seamless control than can a traditional Ethernet LAN.\nSDN has revolutionized the way IT system managers program their networks to keep up with a vastly diverse\nrange of users and applications. This paper introduces SDN and how it can be implemented into an OT network\nto provide a greater level of security and performance.\n\nII. WHAT IS SDN?\n\nEthernet technology is segregated into two distinct service planes: the control plane and the data plane. The\ncontrol plane is responsible for determining which network path a packet should use to reach its destination. The\ndata plane is responsible for carrying out the control plane requirements by determining the packet contents and\ninforming the individual switches of how to forward the packet around the network [2].\n\n\n-----\n\nThe key difference that SDN introduces is the separation of the control plane and data plane. In a traditional\nnetwork as shown in Fig. 1(a), a managed network switch uses Spanning Tree Algorithms (STAs) via the Rapid\nSpanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) to determine a single path connection between two Layer 2 switches or\nmiddleboxes. This switch is also responsible for reconverging the network after a fault is detected. A\npredetermined root bridge periodically sends special data frames called Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to\ndetermine the state of the network paths and the appropriate action to take in the event of a change in the network.\nEmbedded in the Ethernet frame to manage throughput reliability are other network control parameters, such as\nIEEE 802.1Q virtual LAN (VLAN) tags and IEEE 802.1p Class of Service tags. Each middlebox must be able to\ninternally manage the control plane logic and then execute the necessary data-forwarding requirements in the data\nplane logic.\n\nTraditional Network – Control Plane Software-Defined\nControl Plane / Data Plane Controller Network\n\n\nOpenFlow Data Plane\n\n|SDN Switch|SDN Switch|\n|---|---|\n\n|SDN Switch|SDN Switch|\n|---|---|\n\n\nFig. 1. Traditional LAN Architecture (a) and SDN Architecture (b)\n\nSDN, on the other hand, implements a logical separation of the control plane and data plane, as shown in\nFig. 1(b). It does this by removing the control plane logic from the switch and introducing a network controller,\nwhich determines the data flow criteria and defines a set of control plane flow rules that are sent to the SDN\nswitch. The SDN switch then simply executes the flow rule as predetermined by the controller [3]. SDN gives\nsystem administrators much greater control over how specific data are forwarded around the network and allows\nnetwork configuration to be designed to suit the data exchange needs of the application. An SDN network,\ntherefore, does not need to rely on STAs and RSTP to determine a best-path connection between two devices or\nwait for an RSTP reconvergence decision after a failure in the network before re-establishing a new data\nconnection. This means that SDN can program more than one active connection to an IED at the same time and\ncreate redundant data paths in the same network.\nSDN uses the OpenFlow protocol as the interface between the network action required for data packets (in the\ncontrol plane) and the hardware that carries out that action (in the data plane). OpenFlow passes flow rules from\nan OpenFlow controller to OpenFlow-enabled SDN hardware. The traditional network switch must make its own\ndecision on how data flows based on network conditions. Because flow rules have been predetermined in the data\nplane OpenFlow-enabled hardware, there is no need for the data plane hardware to make these decisions. The\nnetwork simply follows its flow table match rules to decide what to do next.\n\nIII. IT SDN VS. OT SDN\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy recently sponsored two research projects to determine what advantages SDN\ncould offer OT networks. It is important to note that while the SDN technology applied to OT networks has been\naltered to fit industry-specific standards and requirements, the underlying SDN standards applied to the IT SDN\nnetwork did not have to change, paving the way for rapid development. The research project results far exceeded\nthe expected performance and security criteria set by the research participants and helped set the benchmark for\nOT SDN deployment. Table I summarizes the differences between how SDN is applied to an OT network versus\nan IT network.\n\n\n-----\n\nTABLE I\nOT SDN VS. IT SDN [3]\n\n**Key Attribute** **OT SDN** **IT SDN**\n\nNetwork state Persistent Dynamic\n\nNetwork control Purpose-engineered Traffic reactive\n\nController purpose after\nMonitor Control\nswitch deployment\n\nSecurity Deny-by-default Plug-and-play\n\nFault healing speed Link detect Flow setup time\n\nNetwork management Traffic reactive Fault reactive\n\nPurpose-engineered network control has significant advantages over IT traffic reactive control. Generally, an\nIT middlebox will be plug-and-play, which is great for ease of installation because the system manager does not\nhave to configure many parameters. However, it makes network changes more complex because the ultimate\ndecision about which path a packet will take is determined by the STA and RTSP. Plug-and-play networks always\nattempt to deliver a packet to its intended destination. In many cases, such as when using Address Resolution\nProtocol (ARP), the networks also attempt to resolve the packet query by broadcasting to all hosts in the subnet.\nThis practice has obvious security ramifications.\nPurpose engineering gives the system engineer complete control over the desired path a packet should take\nduring normal and abnormal network conditions. While some argue that purpose engineering is inherently more\ndifficult to configure because of the deny-by-default nature of the network, it is the only way we can be sure the\ncritical data in networks can be delivered to the intended destinations no matter what state the network is in.\n\nIV. CYBERSECURITY BEST PRACTICES\n\nThe following list provides best practices for effective cybersecurity (this section previously appeared in [4]):\n\n  - Know the system (NERC CIP-002).\n\n  - Baseline approved systems (NERC CIP-010).\n\n  - Practice need-to-know policies (NERC CIP-004).\n\n  - Train staff (NERC CIP-004).\n\n  - Establish a defense-in-depth architecture (NERC CIP-005 and 007).\n\n  - Protect the data (NERC CIP-011).\n\n  - Log and monitor the system (throughout NERC CIP).\n\n  - Have redundant communication paths (throughout NERC-CIP).\n\n  - Maintain peak performance of the system (throughout NERC CIP).\n\n  - Establish access controls (NERC CIP-005).\n\n  - Plan and practice for incidents and responses (NERC CIP-008 and CIP-009).\n\n  - Practice physical security (NERC CIP-006 and CIP-014).\nWhether designing an IT or OT network using traditional Ethernet or SDN, network designers need to know\nand understand what they are trying to achieve in any cybersecurity effort. The bottom line is that we want to\npreserve the integrity of the system we are protecting so that it can operate in a safe, reliable, and economical\nmanner.\nFirst, we must get to know the system we are tasked with protecting. Second, we need to baseline the approved\nsystems. We should also practice need-to-know policies and only share information about the security systems\nwith those whose jobs require that information. The principle of least privilege allows authorized people to gain\njust enough access to the system to accomplish their jobs. Cybersecurity success hinges on people performing\ntheir jobs in a secure way, and the only way people will know how to do this is if they are trained.\nNext, we need to engineer a defense-in-depth architecture with multiple layers of complementary defensive\ntechnology that block or slow down attackers so that there is time for an operator to be alerted and respond to the\nattack. Data protection should apply to both data in transport and at rest. This usually means that cryptographic\nsolutions should be used, including encryption, digital signatures, and authentication. Another solution to data\nprotection is offline storage with removed and turned-off memory.\n\n|Key Attribute|OT SDN|IT SDN|\n|---|---|---|\n|Network state|Persistent|Dynamic|\n|Network control|Purpose-engineered|Traffic reactive|\n|Controller purpose after switch deployment|Monitor|Control|\n|Security|Deny-by-default|Plug-and-play|\n|Fault healing speed|Link detect|Flow setup time|\n|Network management|Traffic reactive|Fault reactive|\n\n\n-----\n\nWe need to continually monitor what is happening on the system so we can respond as quickly as possible.\nRedundant communications paths are key to doing this. When one path is under attack or rendered unavailable,\nredundant paths allow the logs and alerts to get out and an incident response team to get in. We must also maintain\npeak performance of the system; maintenance of the devices and technology that make up the system includes\nhardware tests, software patch management, and configuration validations. Additionally, we must ensure that we\nhave appropriate access control in place, limiting logical access to only those people who are authorized to gain\naccess and making sure we have proven who they are before access is granted. This is authentication.\nCybersecurity incidents will happen, so we must plan for them, practice appropriate responses through proven\npolicies and procedures, and provide physical security measures.\n\nV. TRADITIONAL IT VS. OT NETWORK CYBERSECURITY\n\nIT cybersecurity has clearly established security procedures, tools, and applications. OT products are not\ntypically tested with antivirus solutions because their virus databases need constant updates. It is rare for an OT\nnetwork to include security logging, incident response plans, or forensic analysis. Once an OT computer is\ninstalled and put into service, there are typically very few updates or changes. Enterprise computers are generally\nreplaced every 2 to 3 years, but it is normal for an OT computer to be in operation for 10 to 20 years. Because of\nthis, it is likely that new vulnerabilities on an OT network will remain unpatched until the control system is\nreplaced.\nBlacklisting and whitelisting are common techniques used to identify communications or actions on a network\nand either restrict them or allow them to occur. A blacklist contains everything that should be denied, and allows\nanything that is not specifically denied. Blacklisting is commonly used in enterprise networks to block access to\nknown “bad” elements, such as infected websites or compromised IP addresses. In contrast, a whitelist contains a\ncomplete set of allowable actions. Whitelists, which block anything except what has been approved, are common\nin ICS applications. An ICS has a much smaller set of possible communications or actions, which is unlikely to\nchange. It is possible to create a list of exactly what communications or actions should be taking place and to deny\neverything else in an ICS, but this would be nearly impossible in an enterprise network.\nTable II highlights some of the key differences in implementing cybersecurity measures in an IT network\nversus an OT network.\n\nTABLE II\nCYBERSECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED IN IT VS.

OT SDN CYBERSECURITY\n\nCybersecurity is critical to the reliable operation of ICS networks. The same aspects found in the cybersecurity\nbest practices apply to SDN with organizational policies, both with the procedures to be followed by people\ninteracting with ICS network devices and with the implementation of the devices themselves. SDN technology\nleverages the core goal criteria to provide business benefits, situational awareness, and incident response planning\nwhile maintaining an architecture that is simple to implement. Applying the components of the cybersecurity best\npractices to SDN produces a robust and reliable ICS network capable of maintaining the highest levels of security\nand able to respond to varying threat levels through proactive network engineering.\n\n_A._ _Know the System_\nA solid understanding of network architecture is developed from the onset when SDN network design is\nconsidered up front. Any network changes can be undertaken by following strict change control management\npolicies and allowing the deployment of powerful whitelisting security techniques.\nAn ICS network typically has known embedded devices that perform specific tasks for an extended period of\ntime. This simplifies the application of security controls, ensures that unknown devices or applications are\ndropped, and ensures that appropriate measures are taken. This means that the SDN deny-by-default strategy of\nenabling authorized traffic rather than trying to find unauthorized traffic eliminates the need to constantly manage\npatches, system updates, and device security rules and policies for deep packet inspection (DPI) devices and\nintrusion detection systems (IDSs).\n\n_B._ _Baseline Approved Systems_\nNetwork designers are continuously striving to find streamlined methods to confirm that the network is\noperating at the approved baseline. Documenting this, as required by NERC CIP, and ensuring that the network\nadheres to baseline performance criteria can be difficult in a traditional network. Because these networks rely on\nmany protocols (such as Link Layer Discovery Protocol [LLDP] and Syslog) to collect information and determine\nthe near real-time network state through a variety of dynamically changing broadcast and multicast mechanisms,\nit is difficult to verify with any certainty that the actual data flow matches the expected baseline.\nGuaranteeing the contents of a packet beyond Layer 2 requires additional hardware for DPI. SDN control plane\nseparation has this facility already available. OpenFlow provides an array of counters that can be configured for\nreporting packet and byte counts for all types of flow entries and can be configured to monitor for bursts of\nactivity. This gives SDN a distinct advantage in its ability to record and maintain a baseline through continuous\nmonitoring in real time.\n\n_C._ _Practice Need-to-Know Policies_\nSDN deny-by-default access makes it simple to implement need-to-know policies. User access to devicespecific activities can be closely monitored. When coupled with SDN management platforms, authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting (AAA) proxy criteria can be strictly enforced.\n\n_D._ _Train Staff_\nWith SDN flow table capabilities, switches can be configured for training scenario modes through path\nduplication of ICS data without compromising operational integrity. This gives greater access to baseline data and\neases the execution of security control measures.\n\n\n-----\n\n_E._ _Establish a Defense-in-Depth Architecture_\nFor an STA network, a defense-in-depth architecture recommends the implementation of six levels, each with\nits own security and monitoring requirements. As detailed in Fig. 2, each level is assessed on its need for\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Level 1 and 2 devices should be separated from the rest of the\nsystem as much as possible to reduce their attack surfaces. SDN traffic engineering ensures a greater level of\nsecurity through direct device-to-device path engineering.\n\nEnterprise\n\nNetwork\n\nIT\n\nOT\n\nM   H   H LEVEL 5 Firewall/VPN\n\n**Perimeter**\n\nSwitch\n\nLEVEL 4\n\nH   H   L\n\n**SCADA** HMI PC\n\nConfiguration Directory Service\n\nH2MH2M\nM2MM2M\n\nLEVEL 3\n\nH   M   L **Access** Firewall\n\nTDM\n\nTDM Device Spans\n\nLEVEL 2 Levels 1–4\n\nL   H   M **Automation** Switch\n\nSwitch Spans\n\nRelay Levels 2–3 Comm Proc\n\nLEVEL 1 Port Server Serial Radio\n\nNA   L   H **Protection**\n\nMeter\nRelay\n\nDIGITAL\n\nANALOG\n\nLEVEL 0\n**Physical**\n\nNA  NA   H 52\n\nFig. 2. Defense-in-Depth Architecture\n\nCyber attackers are always looking to exploit vulnerabilities in an STA network. Media access control (MAC)\ntable flooding attacks can be used to force a switch to refresh its MAC table, which causes a significant portion\nof the incoming frames to be flooded out all ports, thus creating an opportunity to capture data that reveals\nlegitimate MAC addresses. ARP spoofing (in which attackers attempt to redirect traffic to their IP address by\nsending ARP messages to the network) or BPDU spoofing (in which unauthorized BPDU frames are sent into a\nnetwork to alter how packets are forwarded through the network) are both common techniques of intercepting\npackets for the launching of denial-of-service (DOS) or man-in-the-middle attacks [3].\nIn the case of the MAC table flooding attack, mitigation is achieved by MAC-locked port technology. ARP\nspoofing can be mitigated with static ARP tables so that hosts do not need to reply to ARP requests. However, in\nboth instances, maintaining a network that periodically requires new or replacement hardware requires additional\nresources and funds to unlock and relock MAC addresses and manually update ARP tables. BPDU spoofing\nrequires port monitoring and disabling and BPDU filtering so that any BPDU packets arriving at the port are\ndropped.\n\n|to reduce their attack surfaces.

This is required for every individual switch in a network, resulting in more\nadministrative overhead to continually monitor, patch, and maintain the highest level of security.\nThe deny-by-default architecture of SDN technology ensures any unauthorized packets are dropped and only\npackets that match proactive traffic-engineered flows are forwarded. MAC table flooding and BPDU spoofing\nwill not work in SDN because SDN switches do not have MAC tables or use BPDU packets. ARP spoofing is\novercome by engineering ARP requests and responses between devices.\nThe same concept of security levels can be implemented in SDN in a much simpler fashion. Fig. 3 shows the\nimplementation of security zones based on the collection of devices required to interact within that zone. This\nkeeps each zone or region isolated with trust established between all the devices within that zone. SDN flow rules\nto apply simple techniques (such as MAC and IP address masking for traffic external to the security zone and\nblocking of all multicast and broadcast traffic outside the security zone) provide a powerful tool to manage the\nsecurity needs of an ICS network.\n\nSecurity Zone 1 Security Zone 2\n\nSCADA\n\nHMI RTU Master\n\nZone Zone\nIngress Ingress\n\nSDN Switch SDN Switch\n\nSDN Switch SDN Switch\n\nEncrypted Tunnel\n\nSDN Switch SDN Switch\n\nIED IED\n\nHistorian\n\nSource Destination\n\nFig. 3. SDN Security Zones [2]\n\nWith available OT SDN cybersecurity software, the security state of the network can be managed through\npolicy implementations that can be changed as the security state of the network changes. This provides security\norchestration for the flow controller through complete network visibility, programmable security zones, situational\nawareness, and security policy management through whitelisting all devices on the network. Fig. 4 details the\narchitecture of third-party applications that are being developed to provide SDN-based cybersecurity policies and\nmeasures at the enterprise level.\n\nDevice Management\n\nSecurity Zone Management\n\nSecurity Policy Management\n\nThreat State Management\n\nICS SDN Network\nManagement Platform\n\nOpenFlow Controller\n\nSecurity Zone Security Zone\n\nSDN Switch SDN Switch\n\nSDN Switch SDN Switch\n\nSDN Switch SDN Switch\n\nFig. 4.

This is a dramatic shift from reactive network\nanalysis, detection, and action to one of proactive, preplanned security controls.\nThe threat state model can be divided into six levels of trust as determined by the defense-in-depth model and\ncan be configured to decide whether human intervention is required for a request to transition levels or whether it\ncan be done automatically. Each level can be assigned a predetermined security policy and security zone, resulting\nin a threat-based approach to security controls for the system.\n\n_F._ _Protect the Data_\nData protection is paramount in critical infrastructure operation. Archiving OT SDN data is conducted with\nthe same devices used by an OT STA network with the added benefit that SDN flow tables provide greater\nflexibility in determining which data are archived. This leads to more efficient bandwidth use across the network.\n\n_G._ _Log and Monitor the System_\nControl plane communications in an STA network are not protected through encryption or authentication.\nHowever, OpenFlow communications between the control plane and the data plane are mutually authenticated\nusing X.509 certificate verification and are encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS), making configuration\ncommunications on the centralized control plane a very small attack surface.\nDPI, IDSs, and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) in an STA network are typically difficult to deploy in an\nICS because of the frequent need to update certificates, signatures, and keys, and because of the associated\nhardware necessary to enforce them. IDS hardware is generally required to inspect all packets and therefore\nrequires a dedicated port for packet forwarding and inspection. This can be a significant amount of traffic that\nrequires hardware not rated for industrial or substation use. Whitelisting is the preferred method for antivirus\nmitigation in the OT STA network, but this tends to be firmware-embedded and not easily updated.\nThe proactive traffic-engineered solution of SDN provides the ability to inspect every packet at every hop and\nat multiple layers. MAC, VLAN, and ARP addresses; traffic types; source IP addresses; destination IP addresses,\nand associated port numbers can all be inspected and whitelisted as they traverse the network. With this level of\nmultilayer packet inspection though SDN flow matching, only packets that do not meet the flow and match criteria\nneed to be sent to an IDS. Any packet that does not meet an authorized flow entry is sent for DPI. The ability of\nSDN to inspect packets in this manner greatly reduces the traffic inspection required by a traditional IDS, thus\nreducing instances of false positives and eliminating the need for specialized hardware, which allows the\ndeployment of industrial-rated hardware.\nBecause only packets that have not been engineered to be on the network are sent to the IDS, traffic-engineered\nnetworks protect against insider threats and mistakes. Either a detected packet should be on the network and a\nflow should be added to authorize that packet, or the packet is unauthorized and we can determine its origin and\nhow to deal with it.\n\n_H._ _Have Redundant Communications Paths_\nRedundant communications paths are essential for the reliable operation of an OT network and to provide\nalternative paths in the event of a failure or attack. An STA network allows only one active path between devices,\nand in the event of one of these scenarios, it relies on RTSP to reroute packets according to its algorithms via the\nnext least costly path. The network healing time with this technology can be on the order of 50 to 100 milliseconds.\nSDN allows the use of more than one active connection on an IED. A typical IEC 61850 scheme on an STA\nnetwork, for instance, would require the IED to detect a link failure before failing over. SDN allows the\nengineering of simultaneous active paths, providing the IED the ability to send Generic Object-Oriented\nSubstation Event (GOOSE) messages via two separate paths within the same network. A proactive pre-engineered\nnetwork can then react to network failures much faster because it only requires the switch to read its flow tables\nevery processing cycle to determine the next course of action to take. Therefore, network healing time is\nsignificantly reduced to approximately 100 microseconds or less.\nOpenFlow also provides priority-based port grouping as another method for path redundancy. An SDN switch\nuses the highest priority port to send packets, and if this port is unavailable, the switch uses the next available\nport. This eliminates the need to resend packets. Even if the port is not part of a group, a packet can be sent back\nout the ingress port and redirected out of an alternative port. Such options are impossible to achieve in an STA\nnetwork.\nOf course, the most reliable method for redundancy is to provide two separate networks physically isolated\nfrom each other in a dual primary redundant network. Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) and High-Availability\nSeamless Redundancy (HSR) are two such duplication methods. SDN traffic engineering can emulate the benefits\nof these technologies, although the number of flow rules required may be a limiting factor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_I._ _Maintain Peak Performance of the System_\nSDN whitelisting ensures that the network performs at peak levels of efficiency and reliability, as no unplanned\nor unauthorized devices or applications can consume network resources. Baseline statistics and known traffic\nvolumes that do not change dynamically without preprogramed engineering make SDN peak performance\nadherence and monitoring easier to quantify than they are on an STA network.\n\n_J._ _Establish Access Controls_\nAccess controls form part of security policies and security zone plan management. Because SDN is an\ninteroperable Ethernet technology, network hosts that provide user authentication services, such as Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol (LDAP), can still provide AAA proxy services to users crossing from the IT network\nto the OT network.\n\n_K._ _Plan and Practice for Incident Responses_\nICS networks have well-defined incident response plans to ensure preservation of life and equipment as well\nas cybersecurity threats. SDN complements this approach through its proactively engineered network plan that\nallows quick changes to the operational state of the network in microseconds, irrespective of the network size or\ntopology.\n\n_L._ _Practice Physical Security_\nAs with an STA network, SDN can be integrated with physical access control systems.\n\nVII. IMPLEMENTING PACKET SNIFFING IN AN SDN NETWORK\n\nDPI, IDSs, and port mirroring, or “packet sniffing” as it is more commonly known, are packet-analysis\ntechniques used to inspect packet contents or sometimes entire data streams of information flowing across the\nnetwork so that unwanted or malicious content can be detected. In the example cyber attack timeline in Fig. 5, an\nattacker may have malware sitting undetected on a network for many months. SDN offers significant\nimprovements in packet-sniffing capabilities, allowing detection of intruder activity at the reconnaissance phase.\n\n**Prior to Active System Hack** **After Active System Hack**\n\nReconnaissance\n(network mapping;\n\nOS fingerprinting) Deliver Control Maintain\n\nWeaponize Exploit Execute\n\nAdversary is on network for 12 months on average\n\nCurrent security control focus\n\n(detection and protection)\n\nFig. 5. Cyber Attack Timeline [2]\n\nWith SDN flow matches and conditions, we can be more selective with the packets needing further inspection\nin a switch and redirect them to the appropriate analysis device. A DPI application requires all packets to be\nrerouted to the DPI analysis device and then possibly return to the originating switch. The application may only\nbe interested in HTTP traffic, for instance, and lets all other traffic traverse the network without additional\nscrutiny. SDN allows packet identifier tags to be added so that the packet can be traced back to the switch where\nit originally entered the network, which is valuable to know when the packet is rerouted to the DPI device and is\nrequired if the DPI return route is needed.\nSDN switches that allow the network engineer to add or remove VLAN IDs determine the switch by which a\npacket first entered the network. When packets already have a VLAN ID, bit masking can be used in the VLAN\nfield to identify the packets that have been previously marked for inspection and need to be routed to the analysis\ndevice. This combination of bit masking and VLAN ID assigning ensures that any packets that were previously\nsniffed and tagged in a downstream switch are forwarded, will remain isolated from other traffic, and will be\nensured a unique VLAN ID as they enter each switch [5]. This also ensures that if the packet is not dropped by\nthe DPI analysis device, it can be forwarded to the original destination if required.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn SDN system assumes that all packets have a pre-engineered match in a flow table and therefore any packet\nthat causes a table miss is either not required or may be an intruder attempting to access the network. For an IDS\nand port-mirroring analysis, the packet is simply duplicated and sent to its original destination and to a predefined\nswitch port for forwarding to the DPI analysis device.\nWhen SDN packet sniffing is used in conjunction with analytical tools that can respond to the detection of an\nattacker (who is attempting to map the network through ARP scanning or to identify the operating system (OS)\nof a network through OS fingerprinting techniques), it becomes very difficult for the attacker to move to the\nweaponize and deliver phase. These responses could be in the form of false IP addresses in ARP replies or OS\ninformation preventing the attacker from mapping a network or identifying the OS.\n\nVIII. CONCLUSION\n\nThrough control plane abstraction, SDN technology removes the restrictions of STA, both in physical network\ndesign and operational performance. ICS purpose-engineered networks are redefining the criteria for the creation\nof new best-known methods of delivering information between services and applications. They are doing this\nwhile still improving system performance in technical, policy, and procedural ways without breaking the existing\ninteroperability with Ethernet.\nSDN allows network engineers to support even the most demanding applications used to control, operate, and\nmonitor critical infrastructure in an ICS network. Centralized monitoring and change control services reduce the\nrisk of network disruption. The traditional extended wait times for an STA network to converge have become a\nthing of the past since SDN switches are preprogramed to forward packets in such events.\nAlthough not a completely lossless technology, as packets could still be lost in transit if they are on a link or\nin a switch that fails or if a port buffer is overrun, OT SDN is effectively a next ingress packet-healing technology.\nSDN clearly provides significant advantages in cybersecurity over STA, with its core architecture complementing\nthe ICS core attributes and predictable whitelisting technologies. NERC CIP compliance can be achieved with\nnear real-time centralized reporting and monitoring of port activity, traffic volumes, and application status without\nthe need to manually deploy engineers to gather and analyze these data.\nSDN challenges the best-known practices for STA network architectures, router design, combined control\nplane and data plane switch design, and the services they use. The proactive engineering design of SDN provides\nDPI and an IDS at every switch while simultaneously eliminating the services that increase the attack surface in\nthe STA network. MAC tables and BPDU packets are not used in SDN, and ARP spoofing through broadcast and\nmulticast blocking can be eliminated. In fact, the whole concept of what a subnet is and how IP addresses are\ngrouped can be challenged with flow rules that manage packet flow based on any layer of packet contents.\nThe exposure to attack and the recovery from a detected threat or intrusion is vastly reduced with the evolution\nof third-party OT-focused SDN management platforms. Coupled with SDN multilayer capabilities, management\nplatforms that provide corporate-level threat models, security zones, and policies allow network operators to have\npreplanned contingencies for mitigation of a threat detection. As the future possibilities for OT SDN development\nand design continue to evolve and a greater understanding of the performance and security aspects of SDN are\nfurther understood by asset owners, SDN will become the go-to architecture for making exciting changes in ICS\nnetworks.\n\nIX.
