    "plain_text": "# The footprints of Raccoon: a story about operators of JS- sniffer FakeSecurity distributing Raccoon stealer\n\n**group-ib.com/blog/fakesecurity_raccoon**\n\n07.12.2020\n\nNikita Rostovcev\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat Intelligence & Attribution analyst at Group-IB\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Group-IB specialists discovered a malware distribution campaign\nexploiting Telegram's legitimate features. Analysis showed that the attackers used the\ntechnique to distribute Raccoon stealer, i.e. malware spread through the Malware-as-aService model on one of darknet forums. They, in particular, used Telegram channels in order\nto bypass blocking of active C&C servers.\n\nRaccoon Stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form\ndetails from browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc.). What's more, Raccoon\nStealer scans the infected device for information about valid crypto wallets. If successful, it\ngains access to configuration files.\n\nAd of Raccoon stealer on one of underground forums (translation is provided below)\n\nTranslation:\n\n**Raccoon Stealer. We steal, You deal!**\n\nOur team proudly presents the result of many months of work.\n\nStealing logs has never been so easy and straightforward and sorting them as never been so\nfast and comfortable. We deal with all the frustrating, time-consuming, and tedious issues so\nthat you can focus on what's important: increasing your revenue.\n\nForget about routing and maintaining servers, assembling builds, and other problems. We've\ngone automatic — all you need is a few clicks.\n\nOur specialists work in three areas: software, front-end, and back-end. It helps us focus on\nspecific goals and release a complete product.\n\nNew software:\n\nExclusive code. Unique build\n\n\n-----\n\nC/C++ stealer with enhanced performance\nExcellent signal for each entry; only some antivirus software detects Raccoon during\ndynamic testing\nRaccoon collects passwords, cookies, autofill data from all popular browsers (including\nFireFox x64), CC data, system information, and almost all types of desktop crypto\nwallets\nEmbedded downloader\nCompatible with x32 and x64 operating systems regardless of .NET\nYou get an easy-to-encrypt Native x86 executable file\nPrivate key, gate address, and other string values are heavily encrypted\n\nDuring research, Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution experts established links with\nother elements of the threat actors' infrastructure and recreated the malicious campaign\ntimeline. The campaign was divided into four stages based on the tools used (type of\nmalware, registrars for creating infrastructure, etc.):\n\n- First wave: February 19 to March 5 2020\n\n- Second wave: March 13 to May 22, 2020\n\n- Third wave: June 29 to July 2, 2020\n\n- Fourth wave: August 24 to September 12, 2020\n\nMost domains related to the investigated campaign were registered with two registrars:\n**Cloud2m and Host Africa. Cloud2m was used in earlier attacks. In mid-July 2020, some of**\nthese domains moved to Host Africa.\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeline of FakeSecurity s malicious campaign from February to September 2020\n\nGroup-IB experts concluded that the purpose of the campaign in question was to steal\npayment and user data. The attackers used several attack vectors and tools to deliver the\nmalware.\n\nIt was also discovered that in early 2020, before distributing the Raccoon stealer, the\nattackers had distributed samples of another stealer called Vidar. To do so, they used\nattachments with malicious macros and phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus\nphishing kit.\n\nInfection pattern in the malicious campaigns of hacker group FakeSecurity\n\nThis malware distribution technique reminded Group-IB experts of the pattern used by\n[FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators during the campaign described in November 2019. Apart](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/fakesecurity)\nfrom having similar toolkits, both series of attacks targeted e-commerce. In May 2020,\nGroup-IB identified online stores that had been infected with a modified JS-sniffer of the\nFakeSecurity family. The JS-sniffer was obfuscated using the aaencode algorithm, while the\ndomains used to store the code and collect stolen bank card data were registered during the\nsecond wave with the same registrars as the domains that we discovered while investigating\nthe malicious campaign. As such, it can be assumed that FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators\nwere behind the stealer distribution campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain infrastructure of FakeSecurity's malicious campaigns\n\n**First wave**\n\nThe first wave of domain registrations began in the co.za zone on February 19, 2020. The\nsuspicious domains contained the following keywords: cloud, document, and Microsoft.\nExamples of domains registered during the first wave are presented below:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs part of the campaign s first wave, the initial compromise vector used: (i) mailings with\nattachments containing malicious macros and (ii) phishing pages leading to malware\ndownloading.\n\n**Documents with macros**\n\nOn February 28, nine days after the first domain was registered, the file \"Bank001.xlsm\"\n(SHA1: b1799345152f0f11a0a573b91093a1867d64e119) was uploaded to VirusTotal via a\nUS web interface.\n\nSHA1: b1799345152f0f11a0a\n\n573b91093a1867d64e119 lure document. Alert says: \"SECURITY WARNING. Macros have\nbeen disabled. \"Enable content.\"\"\n\nThe file is a lure document with malicious macros. When activated, it downloads a payload\nfrom http://cloudupdate.co[.]za/documents/msofficeupdate.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious macros contained in lure document and partially obfuscated in Base64\n\nAs a result, the file \"msofficeupdate.exe\" (SHA1:\nf3498ba783b9c8c84d754af8a687d2ff189615d9) is executed. The C&C server in this case is\nbadlandsparks[.]com. This domain was registered on February 27, 2020 and is associated\nwith the IP address 185.244.149[.]100. More than 30 files connect to this domain alone.\n\nInfrastructure relating to the domain badlandsparks[.]com established with the help of\nGroup-IB Graph Network Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nThese files include 13b7afe8ee87977ae34734812482ca7efd62b9b6 and\n\"596a3cb4d82e6ab4d7223be640f614b0f7bd14af\". They create a network connection to\ngineuter[.]info, fastandprettycleaner[.]hk and badlandsparks[.]com. Judging by the requests\nthey make to download libraries and open source data, the file \"msofficeupdate.exe\" and\nothers like it are samples of the Vidar stealer. Criminals use the stealer to collect data from\nbrowsers (including web browsing history and account data), bank card data, crypto wallet\nfiles, messages, and more.\n\nVidar stealer admin panel\n\nSHA1: 596a3cb4d82e6ab4d\n\n7223be640f614b0f7bd14af file network communication built with the help of Group-IB Graph\nNetwork Analysis\n\n[A list of Vidar-specific HTTP requests and a detailed overview are available here:](https://fumik0.com/2018/12/24/lets-dig-into-vidar-an-arkei-copycat-forked-stealer-in-depth-analysis/)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n/ (i.e 162)  < Config\nip-api.com/line/  <- Get Network Info\n/msvcp140.dll    <- Required DLL\n/nss3.dll      <- Required DLL\n/softokn3.dll    <- Required DLL\n/vcruntime140.dll  <- Required DLL\n/          <- Pushing Victim Archive to C2 \n\n```\nThe file \"BankStatement1.xlsm\" (SHA1: c2f8d217877b1a28e4951286d3375212f8dc2335) is\nanother lure document with malicious macros.

According to Group-IB's Graph Network Analysis, documents-cloudserver[.]co.za contained the Mephistophilus phishing kit.\n\nLinks between domains under review established with the help of Group-IB Graph Network\nAnalysis\n\nFrom the start, Mephistophilus has been presented as a system for targeted phishing\nattacks. This phishing kit contains several fake web page templates for delivering payload,\nincluding:\n\n- Microsoft Office 365, Word, and Excel online viewers\n\n- PDF online viewer\n\n- YouTube phishing page\n\n\n-----\n\nMephistophilus admin panel\n\n\n-----\n\nFake Adobe Reader update window\n\nThe documents-cloud-server[.]co.za domain contains a web fake imitating an Adobe Reader\nplugin update page. To continue viewing the document, the user is asked to download a\nplugin.

The domains were\nregistered in two stages: the first batch on March 13, 2020 and the second one on May 22,\n2020. Examples of second-wave domains:\n\nThese domains were created to distribute the Raccoon stealer. It is possible to establish the\nconnection between these domain batches by looking at SHA1:\nb326f9a6d6087f10ef3a9f554a874243f000549d and SHA1:\nF2B2F74F4572BF8BD2D948B34147FFE303F92A0F files. When executed, these files\nestablish a network connection to:\n\n- cloudupdates[.]co.za\n\n- cloud-server-updater2[.]co.za\n\n- cloud-server-updater19.co.za\n\n\n-----\n\nb326f9a6d6087f10ef3\n\na9f554a874243f000549d file network communication established with the help of Group-IB\nGraph Network Analysis\n\nAbout 50 malicious files from public sources are related to the domain cloudupdates[.]co.za.\nTheir first uploads date back to April 30, 2020 and the domain is similar to the previously\ndiscovered cloudupdate.co[.]za. Besides having a similar domain name, it was registered\nthrough the cloud2m registrar and ns1.host-ww.net, ns2.host-ww.net as well as\nmsupdater[.]co.za and cloudupdate[.]co.za\n\nWHOIS records data from three domains\n\nAbout 300 files from public sandboxes are associated with all the second-wave domains. All\nthese files are lure documents containing malicious macros named\n\"MyBankStatement_2436.xlsm\", MyBankStatement_3269.xlsm,\n\"MyBankStatement_5763.xlsm\", etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n6685955C5F006C2D\n\n83A92952EB5EB3FB\n\n9598C783 lure document sample\n\nOne of these files is \"MyBank_5710.xlsm (SHA1:\n685955C5F006C2D83A92952EB5EB3FB9598C783). After activating the macros in this\ndocument, a file was downloaded from http://cloud-serverupdater22[.]co.za/doc/officebuilder. This file with SHA1:\n3657CF5F2142C7E30F72E231E87518B82710DC1C is a Raccoon stealer. It connects to the\nC&C server (35.228.95[.]80) to exfiltrate the collected information, using Google's\ninfrastructure to legitimize requests. In turn, Raccoon makes a network connection to\nhttp://cloud-server-updater1[.]co.za/doc/officeupdate.exe and downloads RAT AveMaria\n(SHA1: a10925364347bde843a1d4105dddf4a4eb88c746), with the C&C server located at\nthe IP address 102.130.118[.]152.\n\nAveMaria is a RAT, which was discovered by cybersecurity researchers in late 2018, when it\nwas used to attack an Italian oil and gas company. The RAT is capable of:\n\nPrivilege escalation\nEnsuring persistence in the infected system\nInjecting code\nKeylogging\nGaining access to web camera\nManaging processes\nManaging files (creation, download, exfiltration, deletion)\nRDP using rdpwrap\n\n\n-----\n\nInfo-stealer support:\n\n- Google Chrome\n\n- Firefox\n\n- Internet Explorer\n\n- Outlook\n\n- Thunderbird\n\n- Foxmail\n\n6685955C5F006C2D\n\n83A92952EB5EB3FB\n\n9598C783 execution sequence\n\nWhen running, Raccoon makes the following network requests:\n\n3657CF5F2142C7E30\n\nF72E231E87518B827\n\n10DC1C network requests\n\nAmong these network requests, there is a connection to the blintick Telegram channel.\nTelegram was used by Raccoon's creators to bypass blocking of the C&C servers. To this\nend, the stealer makes a request to the Telegram channel and receives the encrypted\n\n\n-----\n\naddress of the new C&C server from the description. The first samples using this technique\nbegan appearing on VirusTotal in late May 2020.\n\nMessages from the designers of the Raccoon stealer\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe gate system has been updated. We have completely changed the traditional scheme.\nDetection decreases, keepalives increase. Build has been updated. The screenshot format\nhas been changed to jpeg. Thanks for your feedback and support!\n\n\n-----\n\n**blintick Telegram channel and its description**\n\nAlthough the Raccoon stealer is distributed according to the MaaS model, all files distributed\nduring the second wave accessed the same Telegram channel. This suggests that\ndocuments with malicious macros downloading Raccoon were distributed by the same\ngroup.\n\n**Third wave**\n\nThe third wave of domain registration began on June 29, 2020:\n\n- microsoft-cloud1[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud6[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud7[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud8[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud9[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud10[.]co.za\n\n\n-----\n\n- microsoft-cloud11[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud12[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud13[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud14[.]co.za\n\n- microsoft-cloud15[.]co.za\n\nAll registered domains pointed to the IP address 102.130.112[.]195. The first malicious files\nassociated with this wave began to appear in public sandboxes as early as July 2, 2020. The\nnames of these decoys are almost the same as the names of the files sent in the past:\nBankStatement0109_13169.xlsm, My_Statement_4211.xlsm, and so on. There are about 30\nfiles associated with the domains and cloud-server-updater1[.]co.za.\n\nNetwork infrastructure. File connections with domains involved in two waves established with\nthe help of Group-IB Graph Network Analysis\n\nThe lure documents used as part of this wave look identical to the previous ones. Judging by\ntheir behavior after macros are activated, they were created by the same builder. Such\nbuilders make it possible to create office documents with malicious macros based on\ntemplates, which helps attackers distribute malicious files much faster and more efficiently.\n\n\n-----\n\n618C894C06633E3D7\n\nADD228531F6E775A1\n\n80A7F7 lure document sample\n\nUpon activating macros, the file \"My_Statement_1953.xlsm\" (SHA1:\n618C894C06633E3D7ADD228531F6E775A180A7F7) sends a request to download the\nstealer file http://microsoft-cloud13[.]co.za/msofficeupdate.exe. The Raccoon stealer file\n(SHA1: 6639081791A8909F042E4A4197DF7051382B04E5) makes a series of requests to\nits C&C server (35.198.88[.]195) and tries to download the file http://cloud-serverupdater1[.]co.za/doc/officeupdate.exe, but receives an \"error 302\" and is redirected to\nhttp://cloud-server-updater1[.]co.za/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi because the original domain\nis blocked. It seems that the sample was trying to download RAT AveMaria as before. In\naddition, all files related to this campaign made various network requests, including those to\nthe Telegram channel https://telete.in/blintick.\n\n\n-----\n\n6639081791A8909F0\n\n42E4A4197DF70513\n\n82B04E5 Raccoon stealer network communication\n\n\n-----\n\n**Using loaders**\n\nDuring this campaign, the attackers also experimented with various loaders. While analyzing\nthe infrastructure, we discovered the Buer and Smoke loaders.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, an xls document (SHA1: 6c6680659b09d18ccab0f933daf5bf1910168b1a)\nwas uploaded to VirusTotal. When the malicious code is executed, it downloads the payload\nfrom http://cloud-server-updater2.co[.]za/doc/buer.exe.\n\nSHA1:6c6680659b09\n\nd18ccab0f933daf5bf1\n\n910168b1a file network communication established with the help of Group-IB Graph Network\nAnalysis\n\nApart from that, the files were uploaded to a public resource: bazaar.abuse[.]ch.\n\n[The file names and the tags attached refer to the Buer loader.](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/bc96c38e3f85c43923a37f57c096eb5b3913b516dbcb11b46cb9cfd0c1d167ce/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA1:7b1a5d9bb21d8\n\n[52a6dbf3146fabb1cd1](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/522a42c27449aba54fa539f28082f1ddc2e8e6ea4f3dd29141f702a5ad82e29f/)\n\nca276ed9 file network communication\nWhile monitoring the adversary infrastructure, we identified a batch of domains registered by\nthe attackers between August 24 and September 12, 2020. Examples of such domains are\npresented below:\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar WHOIS domain records\n\nThe WHOIS records for these domains match the WHOIS records for those discovered\npreviously in this campaign. On August 26, 2020, malicious files related to the domains\ncode-cloud[1-6][.]co.za and google-document[.]co.za began appearing on public resources.\nOne of these files is \"BankStatement_1390868739.doc\" (SHA1:\ned5c20371bae393df0a713be72220b055e5cbdad).\n\nSHA1: ed5c20371bae393df0\n\na713be72220b055e5cbdad file network communication established with the help of GroupIB Graph Network Analysis\n\n[When the malicious code is executed, the file downloads the payload from http://google-](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/441030/)\ndocument[.]co.za/doc/loader.exe. Signature analysis showed that the downloaded file is a\nSmoke loader sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"loader.exe\" file analysis and Smoke loader tag\n\nThe fact that the cybercriminals additionally use loaders in their campaigns could indicate\nthat they are still searching for the most effective tools.\n\n**Fourth wave**\n\nSome of the domains registered in early September 2020 mimicked Adobe in their names.\nFrom September 14, 2020, Group-IB experts found Mephistophilus with an identical pattern\non these hosts, just like during the first wave.\n\n\n-----\n\nConnection between the Mephistophilus infrastructure and the 2019 and 2020 campaigns\nestablished with the help of Group-IB Graph Network Analysis\n\nScreenshot of a Mephistophilus decoy page\n\n\n-----\n\nClicking on the Download plugin button downloads the Raccoon stealer file SHA1:\nbcfb45e5451435530156f1f02ddbb9cadf6338e9 from\nhttps://updateforadobenew[.]co.za/file_d/adobe-reader-v13.11.1.3.exe.\n\nData from Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework Polygon\n\nMITRE ATT&CK matrix of the file analyzed\n\nNote: Around mid-July 2020, the attackers deleted their Telegram channel. It was restored on\nSeptember 14, 2020 and the description contained the encrypted address of the active C&C\nserver. At the time of writing, the channel is inactive again.\n\n\n-----\n\n**blintick Telegram channel content**\n\nThis malicious campaign bears a striking resemblance to a series of FakeSecurity JS-sniffer\nattacks described by Group-IB in November 2019. Past attacks targeted owners of online\n[stores powered by Magento CMS. In the campaign described previously, the attackers also](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/fakesecurit)\nused such tools as the Vidar stealer and the Mephistophilus phishing kit, with an identical\ntemplate for Adobe updates. In addition, the attackers used the same hosting service to\nregister domains in both campaigns.\n\nIn the 2020 campaign, the same attack vector was used and involved subsequent\ndistribution of the Raccoon stealer. In addition, the investigation revealed messages sent to\nseveral online stores from bezco.quise1988@wp.pl and outtia.lene1985@wp.pl.\n\nA detailed analysis of the first-wave malware distribution via Mephistophilus phishing pages\nrevealed a link between the domains involved in this campaign (in particular documentscloud-server*[.]co.za) and the FakeSecurity campaign. During the 2020 campaign, phishing\npages were available at the following URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nList of domains with an identical structure\n\nAccording to urlscan[.]io, more than 20 sites with a similar structure were discovered, but the\none that stands out is alloaypparel[.]com. It was used in the FakeSecurity campaign.\n\nSince March 2020, Group-IB specialists have started detecting online store infections with a\nJS sniffer obfuscated by the aaencode algorithm (https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html). The\nmalware was loaded from get-js[.]com. WHOIS records similar to those used previously by\nthis group were located at get-js[.]com:\n\n- fiswedbesign[.]com\n\n- alloaypparel[.]com\n\n- firstofbanks[.]com\n\n- magento-security[.]org\n\n- mage-security[.]org\n\n\n-----\n\nConnection between FakeSecutiry infrastructure during the 2019 campaign and the domain\nget-js[.]com built with the help of Group-IB Graph Network Analysis\n\nPart of JS-sniffer code obfuscated with aaencode\n\nAfter deobfuscating it, Group-IB established that the malware used for infections was a\nmodified version of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer. Its distribution was analyzed in November\n2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nDeobfuscated code of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer modified version\n\nIn May 2020, Group-IB discovered new infected online stores. Once again, the attackers\nused a modified FakeSecurity JS-sniffer obfuscated with aaencode. The malware was\ninjected either by a link using a script tag or by modifying existing JavaScript files on the site.\nThe JS-sniffer was used to compromise over 20 online stores between May and September\n2020. The following domains were used to store the code and collect stolen bank card data\nduring the new campaign:\n\n- cloud-js[.]co.za\n\n- host-js[.]co.za\n\n- magento-cloud[.]co.za\n\n- magento-js[.]co.za\n\n- magento-security[.]co.za\n\n- marketplace-magento[.]co.za\n\n- marketplacemagento[.]co.za\n\n- node-js[.]co.za\n\n- node-js[.]co.za\n\n\n-----\n\n- payment-js[.]co.za\n\n- security-js[.]co.za\n\n- web-js[.]co.za\n\nCreated on April 24, 2020 (during the second wave), these domains were registered with the\nsame registrars as those used to distribute the Vidar and Raccoon stealers and the Buer and\nSmoke loaders.\n\nThe format of the links to the JS-sniffer files combined with the malware family type suggest\nthat FakeSecurity JS-sniffer operators are behind the campaign to infect online stores.\n\nIn addition, some domains involved in the campaign under investigation hosted a parked\npage labeled \"test page\", like the one hosted on FakeSecurity domains:\n\n- https://urlscan.io/result/0299b3e5-cbba-40be-adce-7ba437e4cb39/ microsoftcloud10[.]co.za\n\n- https://urlscan.io/result/8f244d1b-2186-4db5-9c52-6122584dafa9/ - documents-cloudserver[.]co.za\n\nExamples of similar parked pages on JS-sniffer FakeSecurity's gate and domains in co.za\nzone\n\n\n-----\n\nThe evidence found indicates that the operators of the FakeSecurity JS-sniffer family are\nlikely to be behind the multi-stage malicious campaign described above. According to our\ninformation, even though the group gains initial access using non-self-developed tools sold\nor rented on darknet forums, it continues to operate its exclusive JS-sniffer.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBelow you can see attackers' TTPs and relevant mitigation and defense techniques in\naccordance with MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE Shield that we recommend to use to protect\nagainst and prevent cyberattacks.\n\nAll the mitigation and defense techniques are implemented in Group-IB's products intended\nfor the protection against cyberattacks at early stages.
