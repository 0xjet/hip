theft\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-chemical-distributor-shares-info-on-darkside-ransomware-data-theft/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-chemical-distributor-shares-info-on-darkside-ransomware-data-theft/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJuly 3, 2021\n10:00 AM\n0\n\nWorld-leading chemical distribution company Brenntag has shared additional info on what\ndata was stolen from its network by DarkSide ransomware operators during an attack from\nlate April 2021 that targeted its North America division.\n\nBrenntag is the second largest in sales for North America, according to the ICIS report on the\nTop 100 Chemical Distributors worldwide.\n\nThe chemical distribution company is headquartered in Germany and has more than 17,000\nemployees worldwide at over 670 sites.\n\n## Stolen info includes SSNs, medical info, more\n\n\n-----\n\nBrenntag confirmed the ransomware attack in an email statement sent to BleepingComputer\non May 13, saying that it disconnected all impacted systems from the network after the\nincident was discovered to contain the threat.\n\n[However, as revealed in data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals during](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20982903-brenntag-north-america-inc-bc-individual-notice-letter)\nlate June, the chemical distribution firm became aware of the attack on April 28, two days\nafter the DarkSide operators breached its network.\n\n\"Our investigation confirmed that Brenntag systems were accessed without authorization\nstarting on April 26, 2021, and/or that some information was taken from our system,\" the\ncompany said.\n\nThe data exfiltrated by the DarkSide attackers includes \"social security number, date of\nbirth, driver's license number, and select medical information.\"\n\nLuckily, as Brenntag further explained, third-party cybersecurity forensic experts hired to\ninvestigate the incident found no evidence that the stolen information was misused for\nfraudulent purposes.\n\nThe company also asked the impacted individuals (more than 6700 according to info\nprovided to Maine's Attorney General) to review their account statements and keep an eye\non their free credit reports to detect any attempts of identity theft and fraud.\n\n\"If you find any transactions you do not recognize, contact the business or institution issuing\nthe statement,\" Brenntag added.\n\n## $4.4 million ransom paid to DarkSide\n\nAs BleepingComputer reported in May, the chemical distributor company paid a $4.4 million\nransom to DarkSide for a decryptor and to prevent the ransomware gang from leaking the\nstolen data.\n\nThe ransom was negotiated down from 133.65 bitcoins (roughly $7.5 million at the time), with\nBrenntag having sent the $4.4 million to the attackers on May 11, as BleepingComputer was\nable to confirm.\n\nAfter the attack, the DarkSide ransomware group claimed to have exfiltrated150GB of data\nwhile they had access to Brenntag's systems.\n\nAs proof of their claims, the threat actors also created a private data leak page with a\ndescription of the types of stolen data and screenshots of some of the files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Private data leak page sent to Brenntag_\nThe DarkSide affiliate who breached Brenntag's systems claimed to have gotten access to\nthe network using stolen credentials bought from an unknown source.\n\nThis aligns with similar tactics employed by other ransomware gangs who regularly purchase\nstolen credentials (including Remote Desktop credentials) from dark web marketplace.\n\nBleepingComputer reported in April that threat actors used UAS, one of the largest RDP\n[marketplaces, to sell more than 1.3 million stolen credentials since the end of 2018.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/logins-for-13-million-windows-rdp-servers-collected-from-hacker-market/)\n\nThe [Darkside ransomware gang has been active since August 2020 with a focus on](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/)\ncorporate networks and asking millions of dollars for decryptors and the promise not to\nrelease stolen data.\n\nThe ransomware group landed in the crosshairs of the US government and law enforcement\nafter [hitting Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the

suddenly shut\ndown in May out of fear of being arrested.\n\n[DarkSide hit other organizations in the past, including Discount Car and Truck Rentals,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-canadian-rental-car-company-hit-by-darkside-ransomware/)\n[Brookfield Residential, and
