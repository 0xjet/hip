The site appears to have been designed to\ntarget users in Hong Kong based on the content of the landing page. Since the initial activity,\nwe released two private reports exhaustively detailing spread, exploits, infrastructure and\nLightSpy implants.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Landing page of watering hole site_\n\nWe are temporarily calling this APT group “TwoSail Junk”. Currently, we have hints from\nknown backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous\nactivity. And we are working with colleagues to tie LightSpy with prior activity from a long\n[running Chinese-speaking APT group, previously reported on as](https://securelist.com/the-spring-dragon-apt/70726/) [Spring Dragon/Lotus](https://securelist.com/spring-dragon-updated-activity/79067/)\nBlossom/Billbug(Thrip), known for their Lotus Elise and Evora backdoor malware.\nConsidering that this LightSpy activity has been disclosed publicly by our colleagues from\n[TrendMicro, we would like to further contribute missing information to the story without](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Operation-Poisoned-News-Hong-Kong-Users-Targeted-with-Mobile-Malware-via-Local-News-Links.pdf)\nduplicating content. And, in our quest to secure technologies for a better future, we reported\nthe malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis supplemental information can be difficult to organize to make for easy reading. In light of\nthis, this document is broken down into several sections.\n\n1. Deployment timeline – additional information clarifying LightSpy deployment milestone\n\nevents, including both exploit releases and individual LightSpy iOS implant component\nupdates.\n2. Spreading – supplemental technical details on various techniques used to deliver\n\nmalicious links to targets\n3. Infrastructure – supplemental description of a TwoSail Junk RDP server, the LightSpy\n\nadmin panel, and some related server-side javascript\n4. Android implant and a pivot into evora – additional information on an Android implant\n\nand related infrastructure. After pivoting from the infrastructure in the previous section,\nwe find related implants and backdoor malware, helping to connect this activity to\npreviously known SpringDragon APT with low confidence.\n\nMore information about LightSpy is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence\n[Reporting. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Deployment timeline\n\nDuring our investigation, we observed the actor modifying some components involved in the\nexploit chain on February 7, 2020 with major changes, and on March 5, 2020 with minor\nones.\n\n_Figure 1. Brief LightSpy event timeline_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first observed version of the WebKit exploit dated January 10, 2020 closely resembled a\nproof of concept (PoC), containing elements such as buttons, alert messages, and many log\nstatements throughout. The second version commented out or removed many of the log\nstatements, changed alert() to print() statements, and also introduced some language errors\nsuch as “your device is not support…” and “stab not find…”.\n\nBy analyzing the changes in the first stage WebKit exploit, we discovered the list of\nsupported devices was also significantly extended:\n_Table 1. iOS version exploit support expansion_\n\n**Device** **iOS version** **Supported as of Jan 10** **Supported as of Feb 7**\n\niPhone 6 11.03 + –\n\niPhone 6S 12.01 + commented\n\n12.2 – +\n\niPhone 7 12.1 – +\n\n12.11 + +\n\n12.12 + +\n\n12.14 – +\n\n12.2 – +\n\niPhone 7+ 12.2 – +\n\niPhone 8 12.2 – +\n\niPhone 8+ 12.2 – +\n\niPhone X 12.2 – +\n\nAs seen above, the actor was actively changing implant components, which is why we are\nproviding a full list of historical hashes in the IoC section at the end of this report. There were\nmany minor changes that did not directly affect the functionality of each component, but\nthere were also some exceptions to this that will be expanded on below. Based on our\nobservations of these changes over a relatively short time frame, we can assess that the\nactor implemented a fairly agile development process, with time seemingly more important\nthan stealthiness or quality.\n\nOne interesting observation involved the “EnvironmentalRecording” plugin (MD5:\nae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391), which was a dynamically linked shared library\nresponsible for recording surrounding audio and phone calls. On February 7, 2020, we\nnoticed a new binary (MD5: f70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5) with the same name with\n\n\n-----\n\nno similarities to the earlier one. This new file did not contain any environment paths, version\nstamps, or any other traces from the parent plugin pattern. Its sole purpose was to clean up\nthe implant components by erasing all files located in “/var/iolight/”, “/bin/light/”, and\n“/bin/irc_loader/”. We are currently unsure whether the actor intended to replace the original\nplugin with an uninstall package or if this was a result of carelessness or confusion from the\nrapid development process.\n\nAnother example of a possible mistake involved the “Screenaaa” plugin. The first version\n(MD5: 35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945) that was deployed on January 10, 2020 did\nwhat we expected: it was a small plugin designed to capture a screenshot, create a directory,\nand save the captured file in JPEG format. However, the plugin (MD5:\n7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c) with the same name that was packaged on February\n7 had a completely different functionality. This binary was actually a LAN scanner based on\n[MMLanScan, an open source project for iOS that helps scan a network to show available](https://github.com/mavris/MMLanScan)\ndevices along with their MAC addresses, hostname, and manufacturer. Most likely, this\nplugin was mistakenly bundled up in the February 7 payload with the same name as the\nscreenshot plugin.\n\n_Figure 2. LightSpy iOS implant component layout and communications_\n\n## Spreading\n\n\n-----\n\nWe cannot say definitively that we have visibility into all of their spreading mechanisms. We\ndo know that in past campaigns, precise targeting of individuals was performed over various\nsocial network platforms with direct messaging. And, both ours and previous reporting from\nothers have documented TwoSail Junk’s less precise and broad use of forum posts and\nreplies. These forum posts direct individuals frequenting these sites to pages hosting iframes\nserved from their exploit servers. We add Telegram channels and Instagram posts to the list\nof communication channels abused by these attackers.\n\nThese sites and communication media are known to be frequented by some activist groups.\n\n_Figure 3. LightSpy iPhone infection steps_\n\nThe initial watering hole site (hxxps://appledaily.googlephoto[.]vip/news[.]html) on January\n10, 2020 was designed to mimic a well-known Hong Kong based newspaper “Apple Daily” by\ncopy-pasting HTML content from the original:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Source of html page mimicking newspaper “Apple Daily”_\n\nHowever, at that time, we had not observed any indications of the site being purposely\ndistributed in the wild. Based on our KSN detection statistics, we began seeing a massive\ndistribution campaign beginning on February 18, 2020.\n\n_Table 2. LightSpy related iframe domains, urls, and first seen timestamps_\n\nStarting on February 18, the actors began utilizing a series of invisible iframes to redirect\npotential victims to the exploit site as well as the intended legitimate news site from the lure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Source of html page with lure and exploit_\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n### RDP Clues\n\nThe domain used for the initial watering hole page (googlephoto[.]vip) was registered through\nGoDaddy on September 24, 2019. No unmasked registration information was able to be\nobtained for this domain. The subdomain (appledaily.googlephoto[.]vip) began resolving to a\nnon-parked IP address (103.19.9[.]185) on January 10, 2020 and has not moved since. The\nserver is located in Singapore and is hosted by Beyotta Network, LLP.\n\nAt the time of our initial investigation, the server was listening on ports 80 (HTTP) and 3389\n(RDP with SSL/TLS enabled). The certificate for the server was self-signed and created on\nDecember 16, 2019. Based on Shodan data as early as December 21, 2019, there was a\ncurrently logged in user detected whose name was “SeinandColt”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Screenshot of RDP login page for the server 103.19.9[.]185_\n\n### Admin Panel\n\nThe C2 server for the iOS payload (45.134.1[.]180) also appeared to have an admin panel\non TCP port 50001.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe admin panel seems to be a Vue.js application bundled with Webpack. It contains two\nlanguage packs: English and Chinese. A cursory analysis provides us the impression of\nactual scale of the framework:\n\nIf we take a closer look at the index.js file for the panel, some interesting configurations are\nvisible, to include a user config, an application list, log list, and other interesting settings.\n\nThe “userConfig” variable indicates other possible platforms that may have been targeted by\nthe same actors, such as linux, windows, and routers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting setting includes the “app_list” variable which is commented out. This lists\ntwo common applications used for streaming and chat mostly in China (QQ and Miapoi).\nLooking further, we can also see that the default map coordinates in the config point directly\nto the Tian’anmen Gate in Beijing, however, most likely this is just a common and symbolic\nmapping application default for the center of Beijing.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Android implants and a pivot into evora\n\nDuring analysis of the infrastructure related to iOS implant distribution we also found a link\ndirecting to Android malware – hxxp://app.hkrevolution[.]club/HKcalander[.]apk (MD5:\n77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d).\n\nAccording to artefacts found in google cache, this link was distributed through Telegram\nchannels “winuxhk” and “brothersisterfacebookclub”, and Instagram posts in late November\n2019 with a message lure in Chinese translated as “The Hong Kong People Calendar APP is\nonline ~~~ Follow the latest Hong Kong Democracy and Freedom Movement. Click to\ndownload and support the frontline. Currently only Android version is available.”\n\nFurther technical analysis of the packed APK reveals the timestamp of its actual build –\n2019-11-04 18:12:33. Also it uses the subdomain, sharing an iOS implant distribution\ndomain, as its c2 server – hxxp://svr.hkrevolution[.]club:8002.\n\nIts code contains a link to another related domain:\n\nChecking this server, we found it hosted another related APK:\n\n**MD5** fadff5b601f6fca588007660934129eb\n\n**URL** hxxp://movie.poorgoddaay[.]com/MovieCal[.]apk\n\n**C2** hxxp://app.poorgoddaay[.]com:8002\n\n**Build timestamp** 2019-07-25 21:57:47\n\nThe distribution vector remains the same – Telegram channels:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe latest observed APK sample is hosted on a server that is unusual for the campaign\ncontext – xxinc-media[.]oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com. We assume that the actors are\ntaking steps to split the iOS and Android activities between different infrastructure pieces.\n\n**MD5** 5d2b65790b305c186ef7590e5a1f2d6b\n\n**URL** hxxps://xxinc-media.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com/calendar-release1.0.1.apk\n\n**C2** hxxp://45.134.0[.]123:8002\n\n\n**Build**\n**timestamp**\n\n\n2020-01-14 18:30:30\n\n\nWe had not observed any indications of this URL being distributed in the wild yet.\n\nIf we take a look closer at the domain poorgoddaay[.]com that not only hosted the malicious\nAPK but also was a C2 for them, we can note that there are two subzones of particular\ninterest to us:\n\nzg.poorgoddaay[.]com\nns1.poorgoddaay[.]com\n\nWe were able to work with partners to pivot into a handful of “evora” samples that use the\nabove two subzones as their C2. Taking that a step further, using our Kaspersky Threat\nAttribution Engine (KTAE), we can see that the partner samples using those subzones are\n99% similar to previous backdoors deployed by SpringDragon.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are aware of other related and recent evora malware samples calling back to these\nsame subnets while targeting organizations in Hong Kong as well. These additional factors\nhelp lend at least low confidence to clustering this activity with\nSpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis particular framework and infrastructure is an interesting example of an agile approach to\ndeveloping and deploying surveillance framework in Southeast Asia. This innovative\napproach is something we have seen before from SpringDragon, and LightSpy targeting\ngeolocation at least falls within previous regional targeting of\nSpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug APT, as does infrastructure and “evora” backdoor use.\n\n_Source:_ _[wikimedia.org](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KITLV_-_65860_-_Chinese_junks_at_Macau_-_presumably_1900-1902.tiff)_\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### File hashes\n\n\n-----\n\n**payload.dylib**\n9b248d91d2e1d1b9cd45eb28d8adff71 (Jan 10, 2020)\n4fe3ca4a2526088721c5bdf96ae636f4 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ircbin.plist**\ne48c1c6fb1aa6c3ff6720e336c62b278 (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**irc_loader**\n53acd56ca69a04e13e32f7787a021bb5 (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**light**\n184fbbdb8111d76d3b1377b2768599c9 (Jan 10, 2020)\nbfa6bc2cf28065cfea711154a3204483 (Feb 7, 2020)\nff0f66b7089e06702ffaae6025b227f0 (Mar 5, 2020)\n\n**baseinfoaaa.dylib**\na981a42fb740d05346d1b32ce3d2fd53 (Jan 10, 2020)\n5c69082bd522f91955a6274ba0cf10b2 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**browser**\n7b263f1649dd56994a3da03799611950 (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**EnvironmentalRecording**\nae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391 (Jan 10, 2020)\nf70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**FileManage**\nf1c899e7dd1f721265cc3e3b172c7e90 (Jan 10, 2020)\nea9295d8409ea0f1d894d99fe302070e (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ios_qq**\nc450e53a122c899ba451838ee5250ea5 (Jan 10, 2020)\nf761560ace765913695ffc04dfb36ca7 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ios_telegram**\n1e12e9756b344293352c112ba84533ea (Jan 10, 2020)\n5e295307e4429353e78e70c9a0529d7d (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ios_wechat**\n187a4c343ff4eebd8a3382317cfe5a95 (Jan 10, 2020)\n66d2379318ce8f74cfbd0fb26afc2084 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**KeyChain**\ndb202531c6439012c681328c3f8df60c (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n**locationaaa.dylib**\n3e7094eec0e99b17c5c531d16450cfda (Jan 10, 2020)\n06ff47c8108f7557bb8f195d7b910882 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**Screenaaa**\n35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945 (Jan 10, 2020)\n7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ShellCommandaaa**\na8b0c99f20a303ee410e460730959d4e (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**SoftInfoaaa**\n8cdf29e9c6cca6bf8f02690d8c733c7b (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**WifiList**\nc400d41dd1d3aaca651734d4d565997c (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**Android malware**\n77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d\nfadff5b601f6fca588007660934129eb\n5d2b65790b305c186ef7590e5a1f2d6b\n\n**Past similar SpringDragon evora**\n1126f8af2249406820c78626a64d12bb\n33782e5ba9067b38d42f7ecb8f2acdc8\n\n### Domains and IPs\n\n**Implant c2**\n\n45.134.1[.]180 (iOS)\n\n45.134.0[.]123 (Android)\n\napp.poorgoddaay[.]com (Android)\n\nsvr[.]hkrevolution[.]club (Android)\n\n**WebKit exploit landing**\n\n45.83.237[.]13\n\nmessager[.]cloud\n\n**Spreading**\n\nappledaily.googlephoto[.]vip\n\nwww[.]googlephoto[.]vip\n\nnews2.hkrevolution[.]club\n\nnews.hkrevolution[.]club\n\nwww[.]facebooktoday[.]cc\n\nwww[.]hkrevolt[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nnews.hkrevolt[.]com\nmovie.poorgoddaay[.]com\nxxinc-media[.]oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com\n\n**Related subdomains**\napp.hkrevolution[.]club\nnews.poorgoddaay[.]com\nzg.poorgoddaay[.]com\nns1.poorgoddaay[.]com\n\n### Full Mobile Device Command List\n\nchange_config\n\nexe_cmd\n\nstop_cmd\n\nget_phoneinfo\n\nget_contacts\n\nget_call_history\n\nget_sms\n\ndelete_sms\n\nsend_sms\n\nget_wechat_account\n\nget_wechat_contacts\n\nget_wechat_group\n\nget_wechat_msg\n\nget_wechat_file\n\nget_location\n\nget_location_coninuing\n\nget_browser_history\n\nget_dir\n\nupload_file\n\ndownload_file\n\ndelete_file\n\nget_picture\n\nget_video\n\nget_audio\n\ncreate_dir\n\nrename_file\n\nmove_file\n\ncopy_file\n\nget_app\n\nget_process\n\nget_wifi_history\n\n\n-----\n\nget_wifi_nearby\ncall_record\ncall_photo\nget_qq_account\nget_qq_contacts\nget_qq_group\nget_qq_msg\nget_qq_file\nget_keychain\nscreenshot\n\n[Apple iOS](https://securelist.com/tag/apple-ios/)\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Google Android](https://securelist.com/tag/google-android/)\n[Instant Messengers](https://securelist.com/tag/instant-messengers/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/phishing/)\n[RDP](https://securelist.com/tag/rdp/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Watering hole attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/watering-hole-attacks/)\n[Website Hacks](https://securelist.com/tag/website-hacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nAlexey Firsh\n\n[Kurt Baumgartner](https://securelist.com/author/kurtb/)\n\n[Brian Bartholomew](https://securelist.com/author/brian_bartholomew/)\n\niOS exploit chain deploys LightSpy feature-rich malware\n\nYour email address will not be published.
