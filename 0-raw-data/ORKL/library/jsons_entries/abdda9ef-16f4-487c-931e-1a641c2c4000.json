These attackers aggressively pursue and compromise chosen targets in order to steal sensitive information. These are not conducted through separate attacks; rather, they comprise of a series of attempts over time to get deeper and deeper into a target’s network. Each attempt may either succeed or fail, but the overall goal is to penetrate the target’s network and acquire information. Malware is typically used as an attack vector, but the real threat involves human operators who adapt, adjust, and improve their methods based on the victim’s defenses.\n\n Enterprises should consider targeted attacks a high-priority threat because of the considerable damage they incur. The human and systemic weaknesses that allow an attacker to compromise an organization can be minimized and mitigated with correct practices and solutions. However, these same weaknesses can never be fully resolved.\n\n Trend Micro monitors the targeted attack landscape in order to identify ongoing campaigns and provide additional threat intelligence useful for identifying the existence of these campaigns in an enterprise network. This quarterly report presents the targeted attack campaigns observed and mitigated by Trend Micro based on reported customer cases, as well as our own independently gathered data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaigns Observed in 2Q\n\n### Targeted Attack Campaigns Profiling\n\n#### We encountered a variety of targeted campaigns in the second quarter of the year. These include the following:\n\n • IXESHE. The IXESHE campaign is known for targeting East Asian\n governments, electronics manufacturers, and telecommunications firms. We released a white paper discussing this campaign.[1] IXESHE has been active since 2012.\n\n • ELISE. This recently discovered campaign also targets government agencies\n in the Asia Pacific region. It is called ELISE after certain strings found in its unpacked code. (We detect the malware used by this campaign as\n BKDR_ELISE.)\n\n • ZEGOST. This family of backdoors (aka HTTP Tunnel) is Chinese in origin\n and was used in attacks against Asian government organizations.\n\n • BEEBUS/MUTTER. This is a targeted campaign believed to be associated\n with the Comment Crew attacker group because of the use of encrypted/ obfuscated HTML comments to hide their C&C transactions.\n\n • TravNet. This campaign made use of a malware family identified as NetTraveler\n based on the strings found in the malware code. The malware is detected as\n BKDR_TRAVLAR.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Affected Industry Sectors\n\n#### Our data indicates that the majority of targeted attack victims are various government agencies. Targeted firms from the technology sector include telecommunication firms, Internet service providers, and software companies. The financial services sector and the aerospace industry were also targeted this quarter.\n\nTargeted attacks discovered by industry\n\n### Affected Regions\n\n#### The targeted attacks that we analyzed were heavily concentrated in Asia, particularly Taiwan and Japan.\n\nTargeted attacks discovered by region\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attachments Used In Targeted Attacks\n\n#### Based on our findings, the most common type of email attachment type used in targeted attacks were file archives of various forms. When uncompressed, these archives typically contain the malicious payload itself, which the user may then run directly. Alternately, they may also contain a .DOC file that contains exploit code. RTF files made up the second most common file type.\n\nFile types used in targeted attacks\n\n#### Frequently, the .EXE files we see are made to appear as ordinary documents or folders using appropriately chosen icons. In addition, we also saw an increased use of files that make use of right-to-left override (RTLO) in Unicode.\n\n### C&C Statistics\n\n#### We were also able to monitor the activity of various C&C servers related to targeted attacks. By volume of C&C server activity, the following countries ranked as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Feature: EvilGrab Campaign Targets Diplomatic Agencies\n\n#### In this report, we will provide a detailed analysis of the EvilGrab campaign. This campaign was first found targeting certain Asian and European governments. Its name is derived from its behavior of grabbing audio, video, and screenshots from affected machines.\n\n Currently, the malware used by EvilGrab belongs to one of three malware families:\n\n • BKDR_HGDER\n\n • BKDR_EVILOGE\n\n • BKDR_NVICM\n\n### Targets\n\n#### Our research indicates that EvilGrab activity is most prevalent in China and Japan, although it is also present in other parts of the world. Government organizations were, by far, the most affected by EvilGrab. This geolocation is based on the IP addresses of the victims. Therefore, foreign institutions within China would be identified as coming from China; the same would hold true for all countries. EvilGrab was also found in the United States, Canada, France, Spain, and Australia, among others.\n\n1 China 36%\n\n2 Japan 18% 5\n\n3 South Africa 3%\n\n1 2\n\n4 Thailand 2%\n\n4\n\n5 Canada 2%\n\nOthers 39%\n\n3\n\nMap of top affected countries by targeted attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attack Vectors\n\n#### Research indicates that EvilGrab is primarily distributed through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments that exploit various vulnerabilities to run malicious code. Among the attachment types are:\n\n • Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheets (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2012-2543)\n\n • PDFs (CVE-2013-0640)\n\n • Microsoft® Word® documents (CVE-2012-0158)\n\n A .RAR file with a folder named thumbs.db was also seen containing malicious code. By using this name, the intention was to disguise itself as the Windows thumbnail cache. A shortcut file (.LNK) was also seen in the .RAR file, which used a folder icon to make users believe it was another folder. In reality, running the .LNK file executes the malware. In addition, the .RAR file contains a desktop.ini file in order to change the thumbs.db folder icon into the icon of the Windows thumbnail cache.\n\n### Exploits, Payloads, and Decoy Documents\n\n#### The EvilGrab campaign’s use of exploits, payloads, and decoy documents is similar to the Taidoor campaign in 2012.[2] The primary difference is that EvilGrab variants have multiple layers of shellcode. In addition, some variants copy the file name and use it as the decoy document file name. Other variants overwrite the exploit document with the contents of the decoy document.\n\n As noted above, some variants also use disguised folders and shortcuts and do not use exploits to run their code.\n\n### DLL Preloading Using the Windows Shell and Fax Server\n\n#### DLL preloading is a vulnerability that has been documented for over three years.[3] The EvilGrab campaign makes use of this vulnerability for its AutoRun routine.\n\n Whenever it is run, the Windows shell (explorer.exe) loads a component of the fax server in Windows, fxsst.dll. This is normally located in the System32 folder. Whenever an instance of explorer.exe is launched (i.e., at every system startup), the system searches for the said .DLL file and loads it.\n\n EvilGrab drops one of its .DLL components in the Windows folder, where explorer. exe is also located. The malicious .DLL (also named fxsst.dll) is loaded instead of the legitimate copy. It also serves as the loader of the main backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### While DLL preloading has been used by other malware in the past, it is less common to see it specifically target explorer.exe. Other malware families that use this vulnerability typically target executable files outside of Windows; EvilGrab targets a part of Windows itself.\n\n### Other Autorun Behaviors\n\n#### In addition to the above behavior, EvilGrab also creates the following registry entry to enable its automatic execution at every system startup:\n\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nUKey = “%Application Data%\\360\\Live360.exe”\n\n```\n\n#### The file %Application Data%\\360\\Live360.exe is a copy of one of the malware components. It also creates a shortcut under the Startup folder in the Start menu:\n\n • IEChecker.lnk\n\n • Target: “%UserProfile%\\IEChecker.exe” –L\n\n • Icon: %Full path of Iexplorer.exe% (This uses the Internet Explorer icon\n and disguise itself as part of Internet Explorer.)\n\n The above file is also a copy of one of the malicious components.\n\n### Stealth Operation\n\n#### EvilGrab has three primary components: one .EXE file and two .DLL files. The .EXE file acts as the installer for all of the EvilGrab components. One of the .DLL files serves as a loader for the other .DLL file, which is the main backdoor component. Some variants of EvilGrab delete the .EXE file after installation to cover its tracks more effectively. As noted earlier, the loader file is named fxsst.dll. However, examination of its header states that its actual file name is supposed to be svchost.dll.\n\n These components are also encrypted and saved in the registry. To add stealth to its backdoor routines, it uses a legitimate process context’s memory space to inject the main backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### By default, this backdoor injects itself into the svchost.exe or winlogon.exe process. It also checks if certain processes related to certain security products are running on the affected system. The specific processes targeted are:\n\n • avp.exe\n\n • klwtblfs.exe\n\n • starter.exe\n\n • wmifw.exe\n\n Other variants of this malware also check if other security products are present. It is not clear why EvilGrab specifically targets these products. However, it is possible that the attackers determined that targets for this campaign are likely running these products.\n\n### Registry Storage\n\n#### EvilGrab stores its components in the following registry entries:\n\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\rar and/or HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\rar\ndata = {Encrypted copy of the main backdoor DLL}\ns = {Encrypted copy of the loader DLL}\ne = {Encrypted string which points to the full path of\n\n the installer EXE}\n\n```\n\n### Media Grabbing\n\n#### To capture video, EvilGrab creates a capture window with the class name of ESET. It uses the Sample Grabber filter (part of the DirectShow technology in Windows) to directly perform grabbing.[4] It also uses Wave APIs to capture audio.[5]\n\n### User Credential Theft\n\n#### EvilGrab steals user credentials related to the following applications and/or protocols:\n\n • HTTP\n\n • HTTPMail\n\n • IMAP\n\n • Internet Explorer (IE)\n\n • Microsoft Outlook\n\n\n-----\n\n#### • MSN\n\n • POP3\n\n • Protected Storage\n\n • SMTP\n\n • Windows Messaging\n\n EvilGrab steals these credentials by parsing the following registry keys:\n\n```\n• HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\\n\n```\nWindows Messaging Subsystem\\Profiles\n\n- HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Messaging Subsystem\\Profiles\n```\n• HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Account Manager\\Accounts\n\n```\n- HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Outlook\\\n```\n OMI Account Manager\\Accounts\n\n```\n\n#### It queries the above keys for related values that correspond to the applications and protocols listed earlier. The values are then decrypted using the system library pstorec.dll.\n\n It also steals login credential from IE autocomplete entries. It does this by first parsing the index.dat files in the IE History folder. It then collects autocomplete entries from the following registry key:\n\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\IntelliForms\\Storage2\n\n```\n\n#### It then initiates a brute force attack on encrypted credentials using the CryptUnprotectData API. However, it will only try to steal passwords from IE’s password-protected sites and MSN Explorer Signup if kav.exe (related to a security product) is not running in the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Tencent QQ Memory Reading\n\n#### If the active window is Tencent QQ (specifically, QQ2009 through QQ2012), EvilGrab will attempt to steal information by directly reading the process’s memory and checking if the class name of the focused window is not named “EDIT.”\n\n The contents of the process’s memory are then saved onto the system’s hard drive as %UserProfile%\\users.bin. It is then sent back to the backdoor’s C&C server. The file on the hard drive is encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.\n\n### Key Logging\n\n#### EvilGrab also possesses keylogging capabilities. The logged keystrokes are then sent back to the C&C and saved to %User Profile%\\users.bin. The file on the hard drive is encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Command & Control Servers\n\n#### Each backdoor has one to three C&C servers in its code. Some of C&C servers that we have seen from our accumulated data are as follows:\n\n • 112.121.182.150\n\n • 113.10.246.46\n\n • 113.10.190.55\n\n • 202.130.112.231\n\n • micoosofts.com\n\n • qtds1979 .3322. org\n\n • qtds1979.gicp.net\n\n • server1. micoosofts. com\n\n • sxl1979. gicp. net\n\n • webmonder. gicp. net\n\n • webposter. gicp. net\n\n • www . yahooip . net\n\n • www . yahooprotect . com\n\n • www . yahooprotect . net\n\n • yacooll . com\n\n • yahooip . net\n\n • yahooprotect . com\n\n\n-----\n\n### Backdoor Activity\n\n#### To start its connection to its C&C server, the backdoor component will first send 5-bytes (\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x33). The C&C will reply if it accepts the connection. The backdoor then replies with a beacon message, the contents of which are as follows:\n\n|Description|Sample value (referring to sample packet illustrated below)|\n|---|---|\n|Size of internal buffer|<%d> =xFFC (4092)|\n|Hardcoded 0xA0|<%c> = xA0|\n|Backdoor identifier 1|<%s> = \"RB0318\"|\n|Host IP|<%s> = \"111.222.123.132\"|\n|Host port|<%d> = 432 (1074.)|\n|OS version|<%s> = \"OSVERSION\"|\n|Hostname|<%s> = \"HOSTNAME\"|\n|User name|<%s> = \"USERNAME\"|\n|Camera device detected|<%s> = \"No\"|\n|Date time|<%s> = \"0Ìì0Ð¡Ê±0•Ö0Ãë\"|\n|Presence of removable drive|<%s> = \"No\"|\n|Backdoor identifier 2|<%s> = \"V2010-v24\"|\n|Process ID of the process where the backdoor is injected|<%d> = 21C (540.)|\n|Hardcoded 0x00|<%d> = 0|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Either backdoor identifier 1 or backdoor identifier 2 acts as the campaign code or marker for EvilGrab campaigns, which is recognizable by the C&C server and/or attacker. Some of the identifiers we saw in backdoor identifier 1 are:\n\n • 006\n\n • 007\n\n • 0401\n\n • 072002\n\n • 3k-Ja-0606\n\n • 3k-jp01\n\n • 4k-lyt25\n\n • 88j\n\n • e-0924\n\n • LJ0626\n\n • RB0318\n\n Some of the identifiers seen in our accumulated data in backdoor identifier 2 are as follows:\n\n • V2010-v16\n\n • V2010-v24\n\n We noted a correlation between the MZ/PE headers of variants and the strings in backdoor identifier 2. Variants with a V2010-v24 identifier have a proper MZ/PE header; variants with a V2010-v16 header have portions of their header overwritten with JPEG strings. These variants require a loader component to load them into memory in order to be executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Below is a sample packet sent at the beginning of the connection:\n\nCode snapshot\n\n#### EvilGrab variants possess a wide variety of possible backdoor commands. The table below lists its possible commands:\n\n|Command code|Description|\n|---|---|\n|x82|Enumerate drives and their drive types|\n|x83|File listing with file's last modification date, file attribute and file size|\n|x85|Execute downloaded file|\n|x86|Set file pointer of specific file|\n|x87|Close file handles|\n|x88|Load .DLL|\n|x89|Create directory|\n|x8A|Delete file|\n|x8B|Delete directory tree|\n|x8C|Get file time stamps of a specific file|\n|x8E|Either runs an executable, loads a DLL or open a file|\n|x8F|Move/Rename a file|\n|x90|Steal login credentials|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command code|Description|\n|---|---|\n|x92|Create remote shell|\n|x93|Write to file|\n|x94|Close thread that created remote shell|\n|x99|Send message to a certain window|\n|x9A - x9B|Related to change a specific window's show state|\n|x9C|Change window text of certain window|\n|x9D, x9F|Synthesize key strokes (i.e. right menu, shift)|\n|xB0|Triggers sending of accumulated stolen information|\n|xB1|Modify registry entry value|\n|xB2|Delete a value from registry|\n|xB4|Modify registry|\n|xB5|Create registry entry|\n|xB7|Delete registry key|\n|xB9|Get service listing info (service name, service type, service status, service setting)|\n|xBA|Change service status|\n|xBB|Change optional parameters of certain services|\n|xBC|Create service|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command code|Description|\n|---|---|\n|xBD|Get TCP & UDP network connections|\n|xBE|Get process listing|\n|xBF|Terminate process|\n|xC0|Get CPU info, Windows and System32 folder, hostname, user name, clipboard contents|\n|xC1|Delete its files and registries from the system (uninstall itself)|\n|xE2- xE3|Related to stealing desktop screenshots|\n|xE5|Get desktop screenshot|\n|xE6|Get file listing|\n|xE9|Connect to other network|\n|xEB|Set mouse event|\n|xEC|Start capture window for media grabbing|\n|xEE|Media capture related|\n|xF0|Start audio recording|\n|xF2|Search for certain files and steal file content|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### This captured packet shows sample backdoor commands and replies:\n\nBackdoor command xC0: Get CPU info, Windows and System32\n\nfolder, hostname, user name and clipboard content\n\nBackdoor command x82: Get drive listings and types\n\n#### These capabilities can be used for both lateral movement within a compromised organization and to steal information. EvilGrab steals internal user names and passwords as well as logs keystrokes. Credentials stolen this way can be used to move within the confines of the organization’s network.\n\n EvilGrab possesses a wide variety of information theft capabilities. It can grab audio and video files directly from devices attached on the system (i.e. microphone and camera). In addition, EvilGrab can upload files from the affected system to remote servers. EvilGrab possesses a full range of capabilities that is expected in malware used in targeted attacks against organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Trend Micro Recommendations\n\n#### Targeted attacks pose a challenge to traditional signature-based security solutions. To deal with these type of threats, employ solutions that include network monitoring to detect and analyze incoming threats, as well as any outgoing communication with attacking parties.\n\n Products like Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ are capable of mitigating the risks from these threats. One component of Deep Discovery, the Deep Discovery Inspector, provides network threat detection, custom sandboxing, and real-time analysis and reporting.\n\n The second component, Deep Discovery Advisor, provides sandbox analysis of known and unknown threats that augments the capabilities of existing products like endpoint solution and email/web gateways. It also provides visibility to network-wide security events.\n\n The capabilities provided by solutions like Deep Discovery are necessary to provide a unified, comprehensive view of the threats an organization faces. This information can then be used by an organization to create appropriate and proportional responses to properly protect an organization’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\n1 Sancho, David; Dela Torre, Jessa; Bakuei, Matsukawa; Villeneuve, Nart; and McArdle, Robert.
