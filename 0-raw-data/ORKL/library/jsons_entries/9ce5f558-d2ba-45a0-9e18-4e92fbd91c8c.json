    "plain_text": "# Destructive Data Wiper Malware Targeting high-profile Ukrainian Organizations\n\n**[cybersecuritynews.com/destructive-data-wiper-malware/](https://cybersecuritynews.com/destructive-data-wiper-malware/)**\n\nGuru March 16, 2022\n\nA destructive data wiper was discovered recently by the ESET researchers that were used in\nattacks against Ukrainian organizations. It is the third strain of wiper malware that was\ndiscovered since the Russian invasion started to affect computers in Ukraine.\n\n[ESET researchers named this malware, CaddyWiper, and as soon as a compromised](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/15/caddywiper-new-wiper-malware-discovered-ukraine/)\nsystem is infected by this malware, it erases all the data and partition information.\n\nESET products detect this malware as Win32/KillDisk[.]NCX and there have been multiple\nreports of the wiper being installed on systems in a limited number of organizations.\n\nWhile apart from this, neither HermeticWiper nor IsaacWiper (Two other strains of wiper\nmalware targeting computers in Ukraine) shares any close code similarities with\nCaddyWiper. The CaddyWiper malware may have been launched after the threat actors\nhacked into the target network.\n\n[#BREAKING](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#ESETresearch warns about the discovery of a 3rd destructive wiper](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESETresearch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[deployed in Ukraine %. We first observed this new malware we call #CaddyWiper](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaddyWiper?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[today around 9h38 UTC. 1/7 pic.twitter.com/gVzzlT6AzN](https://t.co/gVzzlT6AzN)\n\n— ESET research (@ESETresearch) [March 14, 2022](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436420886712321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, till now it has been detected that only one organization has been targeted by the\nCaddyWiper, in short, the number of cases in the wild is small.\n\nIn the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, ESET’s telemetry discovered HermeticWiper on\nthe networks of several high-profile organizations in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, HermeticWiper was propagated inside local networks with HermeticWizard, as\nwell as HermeticRansom, which served as decoy ransomware.\n\nHere the malware is primarily designed with the sole intention of attacking the target rather\nthan extracting any financial data, information, and reward from the victim.\n\nIn January of this year, a similar data wiper called WhisperGate struck multiple organizations\nin Ukraine. In the last eight years, high-profile targets in the country have been targeted in a\nseries of malicious campaigns like this.\n\nIn this ongoing cyberwarfare, some of the hackers supporting Ukraine have used malware\nagainst pro-Russian cybercriminals, who use malware to degrade and destroy data on\nUkrainian computer systems.\n\nWhile on the other hand, other hackers have targeted Russian companies and government\nagencies to leak their confidential information. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has so far not\nresulted in a large-scale cyberattack, but larger attacks could still occur.\n\n\n-----",
