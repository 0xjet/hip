We believe the groups moved to use CVE-2018-0798 instead of\nthe other Microsoft Equation Editor Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities\nbecause the former is more reliable as it works on all known versions of Equation Editor.\n\nThe analyzed RTF files share the same object dimension (objw2180\\objh300) used to\ntrack the RTF weaponizer in [our previous report, however, the sample was not exploiting](https://www.anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain)\nCVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802. After further analysis, it was discovered that the\nRTF files were exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Microsoft’s Equation Editor\n(EQNEDT32). CVE-2018-0798 does not appear to be a commonly exploited In The Wild\n(ITW) even though it is more reliable compared to other well-known EE RCE\ncounterparts,this is mainly because C|VE2018-0798 works with all EE versions while the\ncounterparts are limited to specific versions. CVE-2017-11882 is only exploitable on an\nunpatched version prior to its fix, and CVE-2018-0802 is only exploitable on the version\nreleased to fix CVE-2017-11882. In contrast, a threat actor utilizing CVE-2018-0798 has\na higher chance of success because it is not limited by version.\n\nAnomali Researchers were able to identify multiple samples of malicious RTF\ndocuments ITW using the same exploit for CVE-2018-0798. Some of the analyzed\nsamples have a creation date of November 19, 2017 (five days after a patch was\nreleased for CVE-2017-11882), however, that date appears to be incorrect because the\ndropped payloads had a recent compilation timestamps in 2019. The earliest use of the\n\n\n-----\n\nexploit ITW we were able to identify and confirm is a sample\n(e228045ef57fb8cc1226b62ada7eee9b) dating back to October 2018 (VirusTotal\nsubmission of 2018-10-29) with the RTF creation time 2018-10-23.\n\nMultiple samples analyzed by Anomali researchers that we associate with CVE-20180798 were also mentioned in previous instances by other researchers in the security\ncommunity. We believe that some of these were misattributed to CVE-2017-11882 or\nCVE-2018-0802 when they actually appear to be CVE-2018-0798.\n\n## Vulnerability and Exploit Analysis\n\nCVE-2018-0798 is an RCE vulnerability, a stack buffer overflow that can be exploited by\na threat actor to perform stack corruption. The vulnerable subroutine is located at the\nrelative virtual address 0x43f6c (sub_443f6c), shown in Figure 1 below. This routine is\ncalled by EQNEDT32 when parsing [Matrix type records. To note, CVE-2017-11882 and](http://rtf2latex2e.sourceforge.net/MTEF3.html#MATRIX_record)\nCVE-2018-0802 are vulnerabilities that take place when parsing Font type records. Part\nof the Matrix record object is copied to a stack buffer without proper bound checks. This\nallows the threat actor to overflow the stack buffer, change the stored return address,\nand take control of the instruction pointer. Due to the age of this binary, it was compiled\nand linked in the early 2000s, it does not use any modern protections against stack\noverflows that would have made exploitation much harder.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 - The vulnerable function before the exploit. The saved return address marked_\n_in red is manipulated. Instruction at 0x1283faa copies a byte from the equation object to_\n_a stack buffer and return from the call._\n\nThe write primitive is used to fill the stack with padding 0x60s and 0x61s until the\nlocation of the stored return address on the stack. The lower two bytes of the stored\nreturn address are changed to 0x0bfb, as depicted in Figure 2. Changing those bytes\nallows hijackig the control flow when the return address is popped off the stack and into\nthe instruction pointer (EIP). The instruction pointer is then redirected to the return\ninstruction of a function to pop the next value off the stack, located at 0x20ed94 in Figure\n2, and into the EIP. This forces the original function argument to be taken as a return\naddress. The argument points to the heap where the equation object has been stored.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 - The vulnerable function after stack corruption showing calling function return_\n_address last two bytes overwritten with x0bfb._\n\nEIP lands on a Null sled until it reaches to the shellcode shown below. The shellcode\npops the next value on the stack using this value the location of the final shellcode is\ncomputed.\n\ndebug017:0051C24D pop   eax\ndebug017:0051C24E jmp   short loc_51C256\n----------------------------------------------------------------------debug017:0051C256 add   eax, offset byte_1BD3C\ndebug017:0051C25B mov   eax, [eax]\ndebug017:0051C25D mov   eax, [eax+14h]\ndebug017:0051C260 add   eax, 6Dh\ndebug017:0051C263 jmp   eax\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final shellcode in sample (264cee1c1854698ef0eb3a141912db40) is shown below.\nIt resolves the address of WinExec and executes the PowerShell command:\n**powershell.exe Copy-Item \"c:\\target\\Flag.dat\" -Destination \"C:\\pwn”**\n\ndebug017:0052320D jmp   short sub_523276\n----------------------------------------------------------------------debug017:00523276 push  'Acor'\ndebug017:0052327B push  'PteG'\ndebug017:00523280 call  Sub_getprocaddr\ndebug017:00523285 push  eax\ndebug017:00523286 push  'cex'\ndebug017:0052328B push  'EniW'\ndebug017:00523290 call  Sub_getprocaddr\ndebug017:00523295 push  0\ndebug017:00523297 xor   edx, edx\ndebug017:00523299 push  offset unk_226E77\ndebug017:0052329E push  'p\\:C'\ndebug017:005232A3 push  '\" no'\ndebug017:005232A8 push  'itan'\ndebug017:005232AD push  'itse'\ndebug017:005232B2 push  'D- \"'\ndebug017:005232B7 push  'tad.'\ndebug017:005232BC push  'galF'\ndebug017:005232C1 push  '\\teg'\ndebug017:005232C6 push  'rat\\'\ndebug017:005232CB push  ':c\" '\ndebug017:005232D0 push  'metI'\ndebug017:005232D5 push  '-ypo'\ndebug017:005232DA push  'C ex'\ndebug017:005232DF push  'e.ll'\ndebug017:005232E4 push  'ehsr'\ndebug017:005232E9 push  'ewop'\ndebug017:005232EE mov   ecx, esp\ndebug017:005232F0 push  edx\ndebug017:005232F1 push  ecx\ndebug017:005232F2 call  eax “winexec”\ndebug017:005232F4 pop   edi\ndebug017:005232F5 pop   esi\ndebug017:005232F6 pop   ebx\ndebug017:005232F7 add   esp, 40h\ndebug017:005232FA cmp   ebp, esp\ndebug017:005232FC call  near ptr unk_5233D5\ndebug017:00523301 mov   esp, ebp\ndebug017:00523303 pop   ebp\ndebug017:00523304 retn\n\nAs previously mentioned this exploit works on all known versions of Microsoft Equation\nEditor.\n\n\n-----\n\nrule RTF_Equation_Editor_CVE_2018_0798\n\n{\nMeta:\n\nauthor    = \"Anomali\"\ntlp      = \"GREEN\"\nversion    = \"1.0\"\ndate     = \"2019-05-10\"\nhash     = \"264cee1c1854698ef0eb3a141912db40\"\ndescription  = \"Detects Malicious RTFs exploiting CVE-2018-0798\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$S1= \"4460606060606060606061616161616161616161616161616161fb0b\"\n$RTF= \"{\\\\rt\"\n\ncondition:\n\n$RTF at 0 and $S1\n}\n\n_Figure 3 -Yara rule to detect Malicious RTF exploiting CVE-2018-0798_\n\n## Threat Actors and Exploit Usage\n\nMost of the collected Samples were attributed to the following Chinese Cyber Espionage\nthreat actor:\n\nConimes\nKeyBoy\nEmissary Panda\nRancor\nTemp.Trident\n\nHowever,Beginning on 25 June 2019, we started observing multiple commodity\ncampaigns (Mostly dropping AsyncRAT) using the updated RTF weaponizer with the\nsame exploit (CVE-2018-0798). As observed previously with CVE-2017-11882 and CVE2018-0802, the weaponizer was used exclusively by Chinese cyber espionage actors for\napproximately one year (December 2017 through December 2018), after which\ncybercrime actors began to incorporate it in their malicious activity. This indicates that\nthe weaponizer author is now selling to a wider group of actors.\n\nExamples of social engineering lures and malicious document content used with CVE2018-0798 in cyberespionage attacks are shown in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1 - Documents exploiting CVE-2018-0798_\n\n\n019debaee6fdf9a9f872277563f0d9ee A Mongolian language-lure\nthemed around government\npolicy.\n\n\nAPP.doc\n\n\n-----\n\n21d0f19abd15d65aa755e89e55157ae7 Labeled “Ministry of Defence”\nfor Mongolia.

Some of the observed techniques identified being used\nto exploit the vulnerability are as follows:\n\n### OLE package objects and DLL Sideloading\n\n**Sample MD5: fc47442f175ff7e312a4aa4f5c8745b8 (Goblin Panda)**\n\nThe malicious RTF document contains OLE Package objects. On execution (user\nopening the attachment) the document drops OLE package as “8.t” in the %TEMP%\ndirectory. The 8.t file is a dropper and it is encrypted using XOR cipher with encryption\nkey “0xFC”. Upon decrypting and executing, it drops two additional files “wsc_proxy.exe”\n(legitimate Avast executable) and a malicious DLL “wsc.dll” in the %TEMP% folder. The\ndropper then creates a scheduled task to run the executable “wsc_proxy.exe” for every\nfive minutes as a persistence mechanism.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Payloads dropped at %tmp% after the execution of dropper (8.t)_\n\nSchedule task command:\n“schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn \"Avast Antivirus\" /tr\n\"C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\wsc_proxy.exe\" /mo 5 /f”\n\nThe benign executable “wsc_proxy.exe” gets executed by the scheduled task \"Avast\nAntivirus,\" and using DLL sideloading the malicious payload “wsc.dll” gets started. The\nmalware attempts to communicate via HTTP to the C2 at vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net\nover port 2113/TCP.\n\nPayload MD5: 9AD1DBA92734A53489180788A6B21856\nC2: vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net\nIP: 185.216.35[.]11 (known Goblin panda C&C)\nURL: vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net/image/logo.png\nOLE package objects and VBScript Execution\n\n**Sample MD5: b3f8abe274cb6a5926bd5c3fc2168997 (Rancor Group)**\n\nThe malicious RTF drops embedded OLE package to “8.t” into the %TEMP% directory\nafter the malicious document is opened. The file 8.t is a malicious executable dropper\nand encrypted via XOR cipher using the key “0xFC”. On execution it drops two files\n“ChromeApp.ps1” and “ChromeApp.vbs” in the directory “C:\\Windows\\tracing\\”. It then\ncreates a scheduled task named “ChromeApp” to execute the Visual Basic Script\n(VBScript). The VBScript calls the PowerShell script and it beacons out to C2\n“185.234.73[.]4” using HTTP to send the victim User ID and receiving further instructions\nto execute.\n\n_Figure 8: Scheduled task creation to start the malicious payload_\n\n_Figure 9: Malicious payloads dropped after the execution of dropper (8.t)_\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 IP: 185.234.73.4\nURL: : http:185.234.73[.]4/CApp.php?\nname=NzI4QTRENTYtMEY0Ny0yQzY3LTY3QzEtQjg0MzNBOUU1Rjgw:VUk=\n\n### Dropping ‘.wll’ file in Microsoft Word ‘startup’ folder\n\n**Sample MD5: 019debaee6fdf9a9f872277563f0d9ee**\n\nThe RTF document drops embedded OLE package as “8.t” in the %TEMP% directory\nwhe the file is opened. The shellcode decrypt “8.t” and save it as\n“%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\cclerr.wll”. The next time user opens Microsoft\nWord, the dropped file “cclerr.wll” will be loaded and executed in Word’s process\nmemory.\n\nDuring the next run of Microsoft Word, the below activities were observed,\n\n1. The cclerr.wll gets copied into “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Intel\\Intel(R) Processor\n\nGraphics” as “RasTls.dll”\n2. The legitimate executable IntelGraphicsController.exe is used to load the\n\nmalicious “RasTls.dll” via DLL search-order hijacking technique.\n3. The below list of commands are executed by word.exe (hijacked process)\n\n_Figure 10: command executions by rogue word.exe process_\n4. Sets the registry key for persistence at\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\IntelGraphicsController\n\n_Figure 11: Windows Autorun key set for persistence._\n5. Drops two batch files in the %TEMP% folder named as UnIB490.bat &\n\n_UnIB4A0.bat_\n6. The batch files are used to clean up the word document and “.wll” file.\n\n_Figure 12: Batch script for clearing traces of malicious activities._\n\nPayload MD5: B72448AF5F58E70C225AB6525126CF8B\nC2: 217.69.8[.]255\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample MD5: 6930bd66a11e30dee1ef4f57287b1318 (Emissary Panda)**\n\nOn opening the RTF document drops embedded OLE package as “s.bin” in the\n%TEMP% directory. The equation editor loads the bin file directly into its memory space\nas code and jumps to it. The code in “s.bin” file extracts and load a DLL. It then creates a\ndirectory “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\pcawhere” and writes a file named “config.ini” with a\nunique identifier for the victim. After successful execution of malicious code, it tries to\nsend the unique identifier of the victim machine to the C2 138.68.133.211 via POST\nrequest over HTTPS.\n\n_Figure 13: C2 network communication with victim GUID_\n\nThe OLE object had an interesting source path “C:\\\\Users\\\\Iran\\\\Desktop\\\\s.bin”\n\n_Figure 14: OLE object shows the originating user name as ‘Iran’._\n\nC2: 138.68.133.211\nURL: 138.68.133.211:443/ajax\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnalysis of the Royal Road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that multiple\nChinese threat groups started utilizing CVE-2018-0798 in their RTF weaponizer. This\nfinding confirms that the groups, as mentioned in our previous report, are sharing the\nsame exploit supply chain. The groups appear to have been using the Microsoft\nvulnerability exploit exclusively for approximately six months before it began appearing in\ncommodity-malware campaigns. This may indicate that the Chinese groups sold the\nexploit after using it in their malicious campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese findings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit developing\ncapabilities because CVE-2018-0798 is not widely reported on and it is typically not\nincorporated into publicly available weaponizers.\n\nThreatstream enterprise users can [read a more detailed analysis here.](https://ui.threatstream.com/tip/349898?__hstc=41179005.68af7262836b841334e1ec629948fc4b.1562224016253.1562224016253.1562224016253.1&__hssc=41179005.1.1562224016253&__hsfp=942437107)\n\n### IOCs\n\n**File Hashes (MD5):**\ne228045ef57fb8cc1226b62ada7eee9b\n019debaee6fdf9a9f872277563f0d9ee\n0764ecc46463fb10952d54515c73e6fc\n0827f48e883f5a59f1c4bf70c98dc42a\n0e8d3ae263fae7775ccc744a5c0c4dc1\n10348b56b0e3466f9f9fa62bda081c98\n109d51899c832287d7ce1f70b5bd885d\n1690766e844034b3c2ab4f853bd59df7\n21d0f19abd15d65aa755e89e55157ae7\n264cee1c1854698ef0eb3a141912db40\n2868447eebdf897bdd6b7ce2a18f4609\n29027a6d2a38a9a954c1e1315439baf9\n2ef069d0e3bb636d2d969d3e6a4d5039\n31283ad09bc7cf618c32a1c893163891\n36796fabb76eb946d211a2fcf5820929\n40cfeb699d239652dd4a79c18b1c7366\n4642e8712c8ada8d56bd36416abb4808\n47353a86ea58df3714870e5755056d97\n4eb14eb23d50b4c7ee768038172f9794\n51c35cb62a0ad294979b0645e5aa4376\n5271a5ddf476af87c6f833638375c72f\n595e30b0c794f47fd768b24ae9caf210\n5982ba16356ee8118e4cdbe54d182b11\n600e14e4b0035c6f0c6a344d87b6c27f\n6614a8776692c982ad766d23b2a5ea29\n67682e25939dce4406f55b6c0c741c0e\n6930bd66a11e30dee1ef4f57287b1318\n6bdc73a2fc8506d9e842fc7b7a4123db\n6d2e6a61eede06fa9d633ce151208831\n7b9d386280da1b840f1b32b85ce74278\n827c7048c269645ce36546c01c01f93f\n8408641cfbcdb53e1e6802f07ea32f11\n84fca27bc75f40194c95534b07838d6c\n853136f00e87a1ab3e2fc3acb309573e\n8621ff472360600ec2a6f7d61a66eeb8\n8f1ab1f96b8322c9e02d87a431a98823\n923d60f3e63c95021f9e99f943fcfbbc\na02712c6cefb532e7928a781fe8d8592\na37df9b230c9d05210613b3c2916328f\n\n\n-----\n\na497426d0f65877947e92a14b8a086af\na5a4046989fa0f99c2076aec3ea0ab2a\na94db3001c0c3fa3cf40bc7fdf9d21b7\na99efd6b4b69c55774a16ae157cd20b9\nac0eac22ce12eac9ee15ca03646ed70c\naf7f59b2b197d454ab8c8a7b0bc371a2\nb2bce665c9bcdf0d3d04dc7ce5e30f79\nb3f8abe274cb6a5926bd5c3fc2168997\nb72448af5f58e70c225ab6525126cf8b\nb82e0ac46f6b812c83a3954038814cce\nbb7aba40c6fc76291fd1cf2c4c558e9f\nbcbea5b25356d768fd826e0376268ff5\nc65b73dde66184bae6ead97afd1b4c4b\nd648c374439cf5fe9df8dc59eb472067\ne004daf8e09b56940d6ca6e51974498b\ne137b95f6149a8639f6d18e286a0a55f\nf0424ed16b435f0c7c802f3a17cbd9de\nf1824bd902251314a4fd5506caced48b\nf1dcf1b2376360c9f0c23f1fb9f4355a\nf333194c19730d6f82ab858210327051\nf34514118eb4689560cd6c0c654f26d9\nfc47442f175ff7e312a4aa4f5c8745b8\n\n**Network IOCs:**\n185.234.73[.]4\n138.68.133[.]211\nVvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net\nloge.otzo[.]com\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### Anomali Labs\n\nCopyright 2019 ANOMALI.\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n\n-----",
