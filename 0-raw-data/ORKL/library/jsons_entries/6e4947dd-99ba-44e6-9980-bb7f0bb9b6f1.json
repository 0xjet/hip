Volt Typhoon’s choice of targets and\npattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering\noperations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors\nare pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt\nfunctions. The U.S. authoring agencies are concerned about the potential for these actors to use their\nnetwork access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military\nconflicts. CCCS assesses that the direct threat to Canada’s critical infrastructure from PRC statesponsored actors is likely lower than that to U.S. infrastructure, but should U.S. infrastructure be\ndisrupted, Canada would likely be affected as well, due to cross-border integration. ASD’s ACSC and\nNCSC-NZ assess Australian and New Zealand critical infrastructure, respectively, could be vulnerable\nto similar activity from PRC state-sponsored actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n[As the authoring agencies have previously highlighted, the use of living off the land (LOTL)](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a)\ntechniques is a hallmark of Volt Typhoon actors’ malicious cyber activity when targeting critical\ninfrastructure. The group also relies on valid accounts and leverage strong operational security, which\ncombined, allows for long-term undiscovered persistence. In fact, the U.S. authoring agencies have\nrecently observed indications of Volt Typhoon actors maintaining access and footholds within some\nvictim IT environments for at least five years. Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-exploitation\nreconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment; tailor their tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the victim’s environment; and dedicate ongoing resources to\nmaintaining persistence and understanding the target environment over time, even after initial\ncompromise.\n\nThe authoring agencies urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the mitigations in this\nadvisory and to hunt for similar malicious activity using the guidance herein provided, along with the\n[recommendations found in joint guide Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques.](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques)\nThese mitigations are primarily intended for IT and OT administrators in critical infrastructure\norganizations. Following the mitigations for prevention of or in response to an incident will help disrupt\nVolt Typhoon’s accesses and reduce the threat to critical infrastructure entities.\n\nIf activity is identified, the authoring agencies strongly recommend that critical infrastructure\norganizations apply the incident response recommendations in this advisory and report the incident to\nthe relevant agency (see Contact Information section).\n\n[For additional information, see joint advisory People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a)\n[Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a)\n[U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical)\n[Infrastructure.

DETAILS\n\n**[Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 14. See Appendix C:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/matrices/enterprise/)**\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables of the Volt Typhoon cyber threat actors’\nactivity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK[®] tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious\n[cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping)\n[MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping) [and CISA’s Decider Tool.](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/)\n\n### Overview of Activity\n\nIn May 2023, the authoring agencies—working with industry partners—disclosed information about\n[activity attributed to Volt Typhoon (see joint advisory People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a)\n[Cyber Actor Living off the Land to Evade Detection). Since then, CISA, NSA, and FBI have](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a)\ndetermined that this activity is part of a broader campaign in which Volt Typhoon actors have\nsuccessfully infiltrated the networks of critical infrastructure organizations in the continental and noncontinental United States and its territories, including Guam.\n\nThe U.S. authoring agencies have primarily observed compromises linked to Volt Typhoon in\n[Communications, Energy,](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/communications-sector) [Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems sector](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/transportation-systems-sector)\norganizations’ IT networks. Some victims are smaller organizations with limited cybersecurity\ncapabilities that provide critical services to larger organizations or key geographic locations.\n\nVolt Typhoon actors tailor their TTPs to the victim environment; however, the U.S. authoring agencies\nhave observed the actors typically following the same pattern of behavior across identified intrusions.\nTheir choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or\nintelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that\nVolt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable the disruption of OT\nfunctions across multiple critical infrastructure sectors (see Figure 1).\n\n**1. Volt Typhoon conducts extensive pre-compromise reconnaissance to learn about the**\n**target organization’s network architecture and operational protocols. This**\nreconnaissance includes identifying network topologies, security measures, typical user\nbehaviors, and key network and IT staff. The intelligence gathered by Volt Typhoon actors is\nlikely leveraged to enhance their operational security. For example, in some instances, Volt\nTyphoon actors may have abstained from using compromised credentials outside of normal\nworking hours to avoid triggering security alerts on abnormal account activities.\n**2. Volt Typhoon typically gains initial access to the IT network by exploiting known or**\n**zero-day vulnerabilities in public-facing network appliances (e.g., routers, virtual private**\nnetworks [VPNs], and firewalls) and then connects to the victim’s network via VPN for followon activities.\n3. **Volt Typhoon aims to obtain administrator credentials within the network, often by**\n**exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the operating system or network**\n**services. In some cases, Volt Typhoon has obtained credentials insecurely stored on a**\npublic-facing network appliance.\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n4. **Volt Typhoon uses valid administrator credentials to move laterally to the domain**\n**controller (DC) and other devices via remote access services such as Remote Desktop**\nProtocol (RDP).\n5. **Volt Typhoon conducts discovery in the victim’s network, leveraging LOTL binaries for**\n**stealth. A key tactic includes using PowerShell to perform targeted queries on Windows event**\nlogs, focusing on specific users and periods. These queries facilitate the discreet extraction of\nsecurity event logs into .dat files, allowing Volt Typhoon actors to gather critical information\nwhile minimizing detection. This strategy, blending in-depth pre-compromise reconnaissance\nwith meticulous post-exploitation intelligence collection, underscores their sophisticated and\nstrategic approach to cyber operations.\n6. **Volt Typhoon achieves full domain compromise by extracting the Active Directory**\n\n**database (NTDS.dit) from the DC. Volt Typhoon frequently employs the Volume Shadow**\nCopy Service (VSS) using command-line utilities such as vssadmin to access NTDS.dit. The\n```\n      NTDS.dit file is a centralized repository that contains critical Active Directory data, including\n\n```\nuser accounts, passwords (in hashed form), and other sensitive data, which can be leveraged\nfor further exploitation. This method entails the creation of a shadow copy—a point-in-time\nsnapshot—of the volume hosting the NTDS.dit file. By leveraging this snapshot, Volt Typhoon\nactors effectively bypass the file locking mechanisms inherent in a live Windows environment,\nwhich typically prevent direct access to the NTDS.dit file while the domain controller is\noperational.\n7. **Volt Typhoon likely uses offline password cracking techniques to decipher these**\n\n**hashes. This process involves extracting the hashes from the NTDS.dit file and then applying**\nvarious password cracking methods, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or more\nsophisticated techniques like rainbow tables to uncover the plaintext passwords. The\nsuccessful decryption of these passwords allows Volt Typhoon actors to obtain elevated\naccess and further infiltrate and manipulate the network.\n8. **Volt Typhoon uses elevated credentials for strategic network infiltration and additional**\n**discovery, often focusing on gaining capabilities to access OT assets. Volt Typhoon**\nactors have been observed testing access to domain-joint OT assets using default OT vendor\ncredentials, and in certain instances, they have possessed the capability to access OT\nsystems whose credentials were compromised via NTDS.dit theft. This access enables\npotential disruptions, such as manipulating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)\nsystems in server rooms or disrupting critical energy and water controls, leading to significant\ninfrastructure failures (in some cases, Volt Typhoon actors had the capability to access\ncamera surveillance systems at critical infrastructure facilities). In one confirmed compromise,\nVolt Typhoon actors moved laterally to a control system and were positioned to move to a\nsecond control system.\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n_Figure 1: Typical Volt Typhoon Activity_\n\nAfter successfully gaining access to legitimate accounts, Volt Typhoon actors exhibit minimal activity\nwithin the compromised environment (except discovery as noted above), suggesting their objective is\nto maintain persistence rather than immediate exploitation. This assessment is supported by\nobserved patterns where Volt Typhoon methodically re-targets the same organizations over extended\nperiods, often spanning several years, to continuously validate and potentially enhance their\nunauthorized accesses. Evidence of their meticulous approach is seen in instances where they\nrepeatedly exfiltrate domain credentials, ensuring access to current and valid accounts. For example,\nin one compromise, Volt Typhoon likely extracted NTDS.dit from three domain controllers in a fouryear period. In another compromise, Volt Typhoon actors extracted NTDS.dit two times from a victim\nin a nine-month period.\n\nIndustry reporting—identifying that Volt Typhoon actors are silent on the network following credential\ndumping and perform discovery to learn about the environment, but do not exfiltrate data—is\nconsistent with the U.S. authoring agencies’ observations. This indicates their aim is to achieve and\nmaintain persistence on the network. In one confirmed compromise, an industry partner observed Volt\nTyphoon actors dumping credentials at regular intervals.\n\nIn addition to leveraging stolen account credentials, the actors use LOTL techniques and avoid\nleaving malware artifacts on systems that would cause alerts. Their strong focus on stealth and\noperational security allows them to maintain long-term, undiscovered persistence. Further, Volt\nTyphoon’s operational security is enhanced by targeted log deletion to conceal their actions within the\ncompromised environment.\n\nSee the below sections for Volt Typhoon TTPs observed by the U.S. authoring agencies from multiple\nconfirmed Volt Typhoon compromises.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n### Observed TTPs\n\n#### Reconnaissance\n\n[Volt Typhoon actors conduct extensive pre-compromise reconnaissance [TA0043] to learn about the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0043/)\n[target organization [T1591], its network [T1590], and its staff [T1589]. This includes web searches](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1591/)\n\n[[T1593]—including victim-owned sites [T1594]—for victim host [T1592], identity, and network](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1593/)\ninformation, especially for information on key network and IT administrators. According to industry\n[reporting, Volt Typhoon actors use FOFA[1], Shodan, and Censys for querying or searching for](https://fofa.info/)\nexposed infrastructure. In some instances, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon\n[actors targeting the personal emails of key network and IT staff [T1589.002] post compromise.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1589/002/)\n\n#### Resource Development\n\nHistorically, Volt Typhoon actors use multi-hop proxies for command and control (C2) infrastructure\n\n[[T1090.003]. The proxy is typically composed of virtual private servers (VPSs) [T1583.003] or small](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1090/003/)\noffice/home office (SOHO) routers. Recently, Volt Typhoon actors used Cisco and NETGEAR end-of[life SOHO routers implanted with KV Botnet malware to support their operations [T1584.005]. (See](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1584/005/)\n[DOJ press release U.S. Government Disrupts Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical)\n[Hacking of Critical Infrastructure for more information).](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical)\n\n#### Initial Access\n\n[To obtain initial access [TA0001], Volt Typhoon actors commonly exploit vulnerabilities in networking](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0001/)\nappliances such as those from Fortinet, Ivanti Connect Secure (formerly Pulse Secure), NETGEAR,\n[Citrix, and Cisco [T1190]. They often use publicly available exploit code for known vulnerabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1190/)\n\n[[T1588.005] but are also adept at discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities [T1587.004].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1588/005/)\n\n     - In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon actors likely obtained initial access by exploiting\n[CVE-2022-42475](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42475) in a network perimeter FortiGate 300D firewall that was not patched. There\nis evidence of a buffer overflow attack identified within the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)-VPN\ncrash logs.\n\nOnce initial access is achieved, Volt Typhoon actors typically shift to establishing persistent access\n\n[[TA0003]. They often use VPN sessions to securely connect to victim environments [T1133], enabling](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0003/)\ndiscreet follow-on intrusion activities. This tactic not only provides a stable foothold in the network but\nalso allows them to blend in with regular traffic, significantly reducing their chances of detection.\n\n#### Execution\n\nVolt Typhoon actors rarely use malware for post-compromise execution. Instead, once Volt Typhoon\nactors gain access to target environments, they use hands-on-keyboard activity via the command-line\n\n[[T1059] and other native tools and processes on systems [T1218] (often referred to as “LOLBins”),](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/)\nknown as LOTL, to maintain and expand access to the victim networks. According to industry\nreporting, some “commands appear to be exploratory or experimental, as the operators [i.e.,\n[malicious actors] adjust and repeat them multiple times.”[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/)\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFor more details on LOTL activity, see the Credential Access and Discovery sections and Appendix\nA: Volt Typhoon LOTL Activity.\n\nSimilar to LOTL, Volt Typhoon actors also use legitimate but outdated versions of network admin\n[tools. For example, in one confirmed compromise, actors downloaded [T1105] an outdated version of](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1105/)\n```\n   comsvcs.dll on the DC in a non-standard folder. comsvcs.dll is a legitimate Microsoft Dynamic\n\n```\nLink Library (DLL) file normally found in the System32 folder. The actors used this DLL with MiniDump\nand the process ID of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to dump the LSASS\n[process memory [T1003.001] and obtain credentials (LSASS process memory space contains hashes](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/001/)\nfor the current user’s operating system (OS) credentials).\n\nThe actors also use legitimate non-native network admin and forensic tools. For example, Volt\nTyphoon actors have been observed using Magnet RAM Capture (MRC) version 1.20 on domain\ncontrollers. MRC is a free imaging tool that captures the physical memory of a computer, and Volt\nTyphoon actors likely used it to analyze in-memory data for sensitive information (such as credentials)\nand in-transit data not typically accessible on disk. Volt Typhoon actors have also been observed\n[implanting Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control.[3] (See the Command and Control](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\nsection).\n\n#### Persistence\n\n[Volt Typhoon primarily relies on valid credentials for persistence [T1078].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/)\n\n#### Defense Evasion\n\nVolt Typhoon has strong operational security. Their actors primarily use LOTL for defense evasion\n\n[[TA0005], which allows them to camouflage their malicious activity with typical system and network](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0005/)\nbehavior, potentially circumventing simplistic endpoint security capabilities. For more information, see\n[joint guide Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques.](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques)\n\nVolt Typhoon actors also obfuscate their malware. In one confirmed compromise, Volt Typhoon\nobfuscated FRP client files (BrightmetricAgent.exe and SMSvcService.exe) and the commandline port scanning utility ScanLine by packing the files with Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX)\n\n[[T1027.002]. FRP client applications support encryption, compression, and easy token authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1027/002/)\nand work across multiple protocols—including transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram\nprotocol (UDP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS).\nThe FRP client applications use the Kuai connection protocol (KCP) for error-checked and\nanonymous data stream delivery over UDP, with packet-level encryption support. See Appendix C\n[and CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR)-10448362-1.v1](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar24-038a) for more information.\n\nIn addition to LOTL and obfuscation techniques, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed selectively\n[clearing Windows Event Logs [T1070.001], system logs, and other technical artifacts to remove](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/001/)\n[evidence [T1070.009] of their intrusion activity and masquerading file names [T1036.005].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1070/009/)\n\n#### Credential Access\n\nVolt Typhoon actors first obtain credentials from public-facing appliances after gaining initial access\n[by exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities [T1068] in the operating system or network services.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1068/)\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n[In some cases, they have obtained credentials insecurely stored on the appliance [T1552]. In one](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1552/)\ninstance, where Volt Typhoon likely exploited CVE-2022-42475 in an unpatched Fortinet device, Volt\nTyphoon actors compromised a domain admin account stored inappropriately on the device.\n\nVolt Typhoon also consistently obtains valid credentials by extracting the Active Directory database\n[file (NTDS.dit)—in some cases multiple times from the same victim over long periods [T1003.003].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1003/003/)\n```\n   NTDS.dit contains usernames, hashed passwords, and group memberships for all domain accounts,\n\n```\nessentially allowing for full domain compromise if the hashes can be cracked offline.\n\nTo obtain NTDS.dit, the U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon:\n\n[1. Move laterally [TA0008] to the domain controller via an interactive RDP session using a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0008/)\n\n[compromised account with domain administrator privileges [T1021.001];](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/001/)\n[2.

Each volume shadow copy created on a DC includes its NTDS.dit and the\n```\n      SYSTEM registry hive, which provides keys to decrypt the NTDS.dit file.\n\n```\nVolt Typhoon actors have also been observed interacting with a PuTTY application by enumerating\n[existing stored sessions [T1012]. Given this interaction and the exposure of cleartext-stored proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1012/)\npasswords used in remote administration, Volt Typhoon actors potentially had access to PuTTY\nprofiles that allow access to critical systems (see the Lateral Movement section).\n\nAccording to industry reporting, Volt Typhoon actors attempted to dump credentials through LSASS\n[(see Appendix B for commands used).[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/)\n\n[The U.S. authoring agencies have observed Volt Typhoon actors leveraging Mimikatz to harvest](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/software/S0002/)\ncredentials, and industry partners have observed Volt Typhoon leveraging [Impacket.[2]](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0357/)\n\n     - Mimikatz is a credential dumping tool and Volt Typhoon actors use it to obtain credentials. In\none confirmed compromise, the Volt Typhoon used RDP to connect to a server and run\nMimikatz after leveraging a compromised administrator account to deploy it.\n\n     - Impacket is an open source Python toolkit for programmatically constructing and manipulating\nnetwork protocols. It contains tools for Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping,\npacket sniffing, and relay attacks—as well as remote service execution.\n\n#### Discovery\n\nVolt Typhoon actors have been observed using commercial tools, LOTL utilities, and appliances\n[already present on the system for system information [T1082], network service [T1046], group](http://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[[T1069] and user [T1033] discovery.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1069/)\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nVolt Typhoon uses at least the following LOTL tools and commands for system information, network\nservice, group, and user discovery techniques:\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n\n- cmd\n\n- certutil\n\n- dnscmd\n\n- ldifde\n\n- makecab\n\n- net user/group/use\n\n- netsh\n\n\n\n- nltest\n\n- netstat\n\n- ntdsutil\n\n- ping\n\n- PowerShell\n\n- quser\n\n- reg query/reg save\n\n\n\n- systeminfo\n\n- tasklist\n\n- wevtutil\n\n- whoami\n\n- wmic\n\n- xcopy\n\n\nSome observed specific examples of discovery include:\n\n  - [Capturing successful logon events [T1654].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1654/)\n```\n   o Specifically, in one incident, analysis of the PowerShell console history of a domain\n\n```\ncontroller indicated that security event logs were directed to a file named user.dat, as\nevidenced by the executed command Get-EventLog security -instanceid 4624 ```\n     after [year-month-date] | fl * | Out-File\n     'C:\\users\\public\\documents\\user.dat'. This indicates the group's specific interest in\n\n```\ncapturing successful logon events (event ID 4624) to analyze user authentication patterns\nwithin the network. Additionally, file system analysis, specifically of the Master File Table\n(MFT), uncovered evidence of a separate file, systeminfo.dat, which was created in\n```\n     C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents but subsequently deleted [T1070.004]. The presence of\n\n```\nthese activities suggests a methodical approach by Volt Typhoon actors in collecting and\nthen possibly removing traces of sensitive log information from the compromised system.\n\n  - [Executing tasklist /v to gather a detailed process listing [T1057], followed by executing](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1057/)\n```\n   taskkill /f /im rdpservice.exe (the function of this executable is not known).\n\n```\n  - [Executing net user and quser for user account information [T1087.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1087/001/)\n\n  - Creating and accessing a file named rult3uil.log on a domain controller in\n```\n   C:\\Windows\\System32\\.

To obtain the history file, Volt Typhoon actors first\nexecuted an RDP session to the user’s workstation where they initially attempted, and failed,\nto obtain the C$ File Name:\n```\n      users\\{redacted}\\appdata\\local\\Google\\Chrome\\UserData\\default\\History file, as\n\n```\nevidenced by the accompanying 1016 (reopen failed) SMB error listed in the application event\nlog. The threat actors then disconnected the RDP session to the workstation and accessed\nthe file C:\\Users\\{redacted}\\Downloads\\History.zip. This file presumably contained\ndata from the User Data directory of the user’s Chrome browser, which the actors likely\n[saved in the Downloads directory for exfiltration [T1074]. Shortly after accessing the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1074/)\n```\n      history.zip file, the actors terminated RDP sessions.\n\n```\n     - About four months later, Volt Typhoon actors accessed the same user’s Chrome data C$\n```\n      File Name: Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Local\n      State and $ File Name: Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User\n      Data\\Default\\Login Data via SMB.

Directory interaction was observed over the network to paths\nsuch as C:\\Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\ and\n```\n   C:\\Users\\{redacted}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\. They also enumerated\n\n```\nseveral directories, including directories containing vulnerability testing and cyber related content and\n[facilities data, such as construction drawings [T1083].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1083/)\n\n#### Lateral Movement\n\nFor lateral movement, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed predominantly employing RDP with\ncompromised valid administrator credentials. Note: With a full on-premises Microsoft Active Directory\nidentity compromise (see the Credential Access section), the group may be capable of using other\n[methods such as Pass the Hash or Pass the Ticket for lateral movement [T1550].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1550/)\n\nIn one confirmed compromise of a Water and Wastewater Systems Sector entity, after obtaining initial\naccess, Volt Typhoon actors connected to the network via a VPN with administrator credentials they\nobtained and opened an RDP session with the same credentials to move laterally. Over a nine-month\nperiod, they moved laterally to a file server, a domain controller, an Oracle Management Server\n(OMS), and a VMware vCenter server. The actors obtained domain credentials from the domain\ncontroller and performed discovery, collection, and exfiltration on the file server (see the Discovery\nand Collection and Exfiltration sections).\n\nVolt Typhoon’s movement to the vCenter server was likely strategic for pre-positioning to OT assets.\nThe vCenter server was adjacent to OT assets, and Volt Typhoon actors were observed interacting\nwith the PuTTY application on the server by enumerating existing stored sessions. With this\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\ninformation, Volt Typhoon potentially had access to a range of critical PuTTY profiles, including those\nfor water treatment plants, water wells, an electrical substation, OT systems, and network security\n[devices. This would enable them to access these critical systems [T1563]. See Figure 2.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1563/)\n\n_Figure 2: Volt Typhoon Lateral Movement Path File Server, DC, and OT-Adjacent Assets_\n\nAdditionally, Volt Typhoon actors have been observed using PSExec to execute remote processes,\nincluding the automated acceptance of the end-user license agreement (EULA) through an\nadministrative account, signified by the accepteula command flag.\n\nVolt Typhoon actors may have attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment in one victim’s\nnetwork but direct attribution to the Volt Typhoon group was inconclusive. During the period of the\n[their known network presence, there were anomalous login attempts to an Azure tenant [T1021.007]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1021/007/)\n[potentially using credentials [T1078.004] previously compromised from theft of NTDS.dit. These](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1078/004/)\nattempts, coupled with misconfigured virtual machines with open RDP ports, suggested a potential for\ncloud-based lateral movement. However, subsequent investigations, including password changes and\nmultifactor authentication (MFA) implementations, revealed authentication failures from nonassociated IP addresses, with no definitive link to Volt Typhoon.\n\n#### Collection and Exfiltration\n\nThe U.S. authoring agencies assess Volt Typhoon primarily collects information that would facilitate\nfollow-on actions with physical impacts. For example, in one confirmed compromise, they collected\n\n[[TA0009] sensitive information obtained from a file server in multiple zipped files [T1560] and likely](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0009/)\n[exfiltrated [TA0010] the files via Server Message Block (SMB) [T1048] (see Figure 3). Collected](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/tactics/TA0010/)\ninformation included diagrams and documentation related to OT equipment, including supervisory\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, relays, and switchgear. This data is crucial for\nunderstanding and potentially impacting critical infrastructure systems, indicating a focus on gathering\nintelligence that could be leveraged in actions targeting physical assets and systems.\n\n_Figure 3: Volt Typhoon Attack Path for Exfiltration of Data from File Server_\n\nIn another compromise, Volt Typhoon actors leveraged WMIC to create and use temporary\ndirectories (C:\\Users\\Public\\pro, C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp, C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp\\Active\n```\n   Directory and C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmp\\registry) to stage the extracted ntds.dit and SYSTEM\n\n```\nregistry hives from ntdsutil execution volume shadow copies (see the Credential Access section)\nobtained from two DCs. They then compressed and archived the extracted ntds.dit and\naccompanying registry files by executing ronf.exe, which was likely a renamed version of the\n[archive utility rar.exe) [T1560.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1560/001/)\n\n### Command and Control\n\nVolt Typhoon actors have been observed leveraging compromised SOHO routers and virtual private\n[servers (VPS) to proxy C2 traffic. For more information, see DOJ press release U.S. Government](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical)\n[Disrupts Botnet People’s Republic of China Used to Conceal Hacking of Critical Infrastructure).](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-disrupts-botnet-peoples-republic-china-used-conceal-hacking-critical)\n\n[They have also been observed setting up FRP clients [T1090] on a victim’s corporate infrastructure to](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1090/)\n[establish covert communications channels [T1573] for command and control. In one instance, Volt](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1573/)\nTyphoon actors implanted the FRP client with filename SMSvcService.exe on a Shortel Enterprise\nContact Center (ECC) server and a second FRP client with filename Brightmetricagent.exe on\n[another server. These clients, when executed via PowerShell [T1059.001], open reverse proxies](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/001/)\nbetween the compromised system and Volt Typhoon C2 servers. Brightmetricagent.exe has\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nadditional capabilities. The FRP client can locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured\n[through Network Address Translation (NAT) [T1016]. It also contains multiplexer libraries that can bi-](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1016/)\ndirectionally stream data over NAT networks and contains a command-line interface (CLI) library that\ncan leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI),\n[and Z Shell (zsh) [T1059.004]. See Appendix C and MAR-10448362-1.v1](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1059/004) for more information.\n\nIn the same compromise, Volt Typhoon actors exploited a Paessler Router Traffic Grapher (PRTG)\nserver as an intermediary for their FRP operations. To facilitate this, they used the netsh command,\n[a legitimate Windows command, to create a PortProxy registry modification [T1112] on the PRTG](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1112)\n[server [T1090.001]. This key alteration redirected specific port traffic to Volt Typhoon’s proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001/)\n[infrastructure, effectively converting the PRTG’s server into a proxy for their C2 traffic [T1584.004]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1584/004/)\n(see Appendix B for details).\n\n## DETECTION/HUNT RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### Apply Living off the Land Detection Best Practices\n\n**Apply the prioritized detection and hardening best practice recommendations provided in joint**\n**guide** **[Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques. Many organizations lack](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques)**\nsecurity and network management best practices (such as established baselines) that support\ndetection of malicious LOTL activity—this makes it difficult for network defenders to discern legitimate\nbehavior from malicious behavior and conduct behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive\nhunting. Conventional IOCs associated with the malicious activity are generally lacking, complicating\nnetwork defenders’ efforts to identify, track, and categorize this sort of malicious behavior. This\nadvisory provides guidance for a multifaceted cybersecurity strategy that enables behavior analytics,\nanomaly detection, and proactive hunting, which are part of a comprehensive approach to mitigating\ncyber threats that employ LOTL techniques.\n\n### Review Application, Security, and System Event Logs\n\n**Routinely review application, security, and system event logs, focusing on Windows**\n**Extensible Storage Engine Technology (ESENT) Application Logs. Due to Volt Typhoon’s ability**\nfor long-term undetected persistence, network defenders should assume significant dwell time and\nreview specific application event log IDs, which remain on endpoints for longer periods compared to\nsecurity event logs and other ephemeral artifacts. Focus on Windows ESENT logs because certain\nESENT Application Log event IDs (216, 325, 326, and 327) may indicate actors copying NTDS.dit.\n\nSee Table 1 for examples of ESENT and other key log indicators that should be investigated.

Developed by Sandia National Labs, gait is a](https://github.com/sandialabs/gait)**\n[publicly available Zeek[5] extension. The gait extension can help enrich Zeek’s network connection](https://zeek.org/)\nmonitoring and SSL logs by including additional metadata in the logs. Specifically, gait captures\nunique TCP options and timing data such as a TCP, transport layer security (TLS), and Secure Shell\n(SSH) layer inferred round trip times (RTT), aiding in the identification of the software used by both\nendpoints and intermediaries.\n\nWhile the gait extension for Zeek is an effective tool for enriching network monitoring logs with\ndetailed metadata, it is not specifically designed to detect Volt Typhoon actor activities. The\nextension’s capabilities extend to general anomaly detection in network traffic, including—but not\nlimited to—proxying activities. Therefore, while gait can be helpful in identifying tactics similar to those\nused by Volt Typhoon, such as proxy networks and FRP clients for C2 communication, not all\nproxying activities detected by using this additional metadata are necessarily indicative of Volt\nTyphoon presence. It serves as a valuable augmentation to current security stacks for a broader\nspectrum of threat detection.\n\n[For more information, see Sandia National Lab’s gait GitHub page sandialabs/gait: Zeek Extension to](https://github.com/sandialabs/gait)\n[Collect Metadata for Profiling of Endpoints and Proxies.](https://github.com/sandialabs/gait)\n\n### Review Logins for Impossible Travel\n\n**Examine VPN or other account logon times, frequency, duration, and locations. Logons from**\ntwo geographically distant locations within a short timeframe from a single user may indicate an\naccount is being used maliciously. Logons of unusual frequency or duration may indicate a threat\nactor attempting to access a system repeatedly or maintain prolonged sessions for the purpose of\ndata extraction.\n\n### Review Standard Directories for Unusual Files\n\n**Review directories, such as C:\\windows\\temp\\ and** `C:\\users\\public\\, for unexpected or`\n**unusual files. Monitor these temporary file storage directories for files typically located in standard**\nsystem paths, such as the System32 directory. For example, Volt Typhoon has been observed\ndownloading comsvcs.dll to a non-standard folder (this file is normally found in the System32\nfolder).\n\n## INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\nIf compromise, or potential compromise, is detected, organizations should assume full domain\n**compromise because of Volt Typhoon’s known behavioral pattern of extracting the NTDS.dit from**\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nthe DCs.
