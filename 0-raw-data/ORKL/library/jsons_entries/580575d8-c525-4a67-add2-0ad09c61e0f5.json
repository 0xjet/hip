Ransomware actors are constantly upping their TTPs and finding new ways to\nmake profits. A new [report by Chainalysis states that ransomware victims spent almost](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/)\n$700 million in ransom in 2020.\n\n### What else does the report say?\n\nThe total ransom paid in 2020 amounted to $692 million and for 2021, the value was\n$602 million.\nHowever, the first half of 2021 amassed more ransom than the first half of 2020,\nsignifying that last year was a bigger year for ransomware.\nWhat’s shocking is that Conti gained the highest ransom, amounting to $180 million,\nfollowed by Evil Corp at $85 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast year witnessed a huge number of individual ransom variants with at least 140 of\nthem receiving ransom payments. The number was 119 and 79 for 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nThe average ransom payment increased from $88,000 in 2020 to $118,000 in 2021.\n\n### More on Conti\n\nChainalysis identified the Conti ransomware group as the only ransomware that\nstayed active throughout the entire year.\nThe gang has been on the radar of the U.S. government for months. In mid-2021, the\nFBI and CISA identified more than 400 attacks related to Conti.\n[Not very long ago, the group attacked KP Snacks and sabotaged its IT systems,](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/conti-ransomware-attack-on-uks-kp-snacks-to-cause-major-supply-chain-problems-for-popular-treats/)\nwhich led to supply chain problems. Due to this devastating attack, the company\nwould not be able to deliver placed orders until at least March-end.\n[In January, Conti allegedly compromised Taiwan-based Delta Electronics. However,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/taiwanese-apple-and-tesla-contractor-hit-by-conti-ransomware/?&web_view=true)\nthe firm claimed that only non-critical processes were interrupted and operations were\nnot majorly impacted.\n\n### The bottom line\n\nConti is a closed RaaS operation and hence, skews toward highly sophisticated attacks.\nWhile law enforcement agencies are increasingly taking down ransomware groups and\nseizing stolen funds, ransomware attacks show no signs of slowing down. Not only Conti,\nbut almost every ransomware group is moving toward larger or varied targets and getting\nbetter at extorting huge amounts of cryptocurrency.\n\nRansomware Attack Trends CONTI Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nPublisher\n\n## Cyware\n\n\n-----",
