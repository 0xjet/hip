    "plain_text": "# Data exfiltration in Latin America\n\n**darktrace.com/en/blog/data-exfiltration-in-latin-america/**\n\nMax Heinemeyer, Director of Threat Hunting | Tuesday July 20, 2021\n\nData exfiltration is a popular enterprise for cyber-criminals. All organizations – from\ngovernment agencies to small businesses – have sensitive data which can be stolen for\nextortion, competitive advantage, or further inroads in a company’s system. It is now the\n[preferred technique of ransomware actors. Some Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups](http://10.10.0.46/blog/double-extortion-ransomware)\nhave even pioneered a new type of ‘extortionware’, which focuses solely on data theft\nwithout encryption.\n\n## Easy money\n\nAt a pharmaceutical manufacturing institute in Latin America, Darktrace recently detected the\nexfiltration of critical files from the company, as this blog will explore.\n\nThe organization was an enticing target for two reasons. Firstly, pharmaceutical companies\nhold a wealth of valuable IP and patient data, which have come under sustained fire this last\n[year as threat actors and nation states infiltrate vaccine research and distribution.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-allies-expose-russian-attacks-on-coronavirus-vaccine-development)\n\n#1\nmost affected industry for data breaches: pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecondly, Latin America is a treasure trove for cyber-criminals, thanks to huge economic\ngrowth in recent years, the digitization of major industries, alongside sub-standard cyber\ninsurance policies and virtually nonexistent regulations.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil and Mexico were in Europol’s top ten affected\ncountries. Since then, cases have skyrocketed – and many companies remain\nunderprepared, facing limited support and pressure from government bodies. Strikingly, even\nthough it has suffered estimated losses of almost $8 billion, Brazil still has no data protection\nlaw in place.\n\nOn top of financial crimes, the LATAM region has been targeted by state-sponsored groups\nlinked to Russia, China, and Iran. Cyber-espionage is used as a method to gain the upper\nhand in negotiations and advance foreign interests in investment and trade.\n\nFurthermore, as supply chains in the criminal world are hit by the effects of the pandemic,\norganized crime may begin to leverage the digital world – particularly fraud and phishing – as\na possible source of income. La Familia Michoacana, a notorious drug cartel in Mexico, has\nreportedly begun enlisting Dark Web hackers.\n\nDespite the number of threats facing Latin America, organizations have been slow to adopt\ndefensive technology. So when the attacker in the case below chose a small organization in\nthe LATAM region, they probably expected to face only signature-based, legacy security\ntools. Sensing that this would be easy prey – with little resistance and large profit to be made\n– the actor launched their first steps.\n\n## How the intrusion played out\n\nDuring a Proof of Value trial with the company, Darktrace detected unusual activity from a\nserver, following external remote connectivity.\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of the attack.\n\nThe attack began when an internal server received an unusual connection over RDP from an\nexternal IP. The connection lasted five hours. The external IP then established a new SMB\nsession to the same server using administrative credentials. The external IP leveraged SMB\nto access a file, which appeared to contain unencrypted passwords.\n\n65%\nof the Colombian population now use the Internet, compared to only 3% in 2000.\n\nFrom there, the external IP downloaded over 18,000 files over SMB. Based on the file\nnames, it appears that the data was highly sensitive. In total, the external IP downloaded\naround 150 MB of data from the internal server.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Unusual activity post remote connections\n\nSelf-Learning AI detected that the IP address was 100% rare for the organization and server.\nThe data transfer was also detected as unusual for the device’s ‘pattern of life’.\nUnfortunately, as [Antigena was being trialled in passive mode, Darktrace could not intervene](http://10.10.0.46/network)\nand disrupt the attack.\n\nNevertheless, Darktrace fired a number of high-confidence alerts to warn the security team.\nThe figure below shows five-day activity from an example device in the same situation, with a\nhigh volume of clustered alerts. These reflect the unusual increase in volume transferred\nexternally from a breach device.\n\nFigure 2: A similar device received an incoming remote desktop connection, highlighted by\nthe first model breach (orange dot). Shortly after, the external device accessed an\nunencrypted password file. At the same time, the device transferred an unusual volume of\ndata to a rare external source IP.\n\n## Data exfiltration methods: RDP and password file access\n\nThe threat actor managed to bypass all the other existing security products in the company.\nThey did this with legitimate administrative credentials, which were used to establish the\n[RDP and SMB connections. RDP credentials are easily bought off the Dark Web and have](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/rdp-ports-prove-hot-commodities-on-the-dark-web/d/d-id/1332830)\nproved a popular form of initial access, especially this year as employees continue to work\nremotely.\n\nIn addition, improper password management can unlock an organization’s digital kingdom.\nOne of the accessed files was a password file, enabling the actor to quickly escalate\nprivileges. After this point, only an AI-powered defensive tool could keep up with the speed of\nthe intrusion.\n\nLeveraging common protocols such as SMB to exfiltrate data is a common tactic. Internetexposed servers are still a major risk to organizations as attackers exploit open and unused\nports.\n\nMoreover, the files transferred during the activity were saved as receipts with the names of\npartners and customers. This is extremely dangerous and could have put the company’s\nreputation at serious risk. Luckily, Self-Learning AI detected the malicious actions and\nwarned the security team immediately, allowing them to stop further exfiltration and any\nfollow-up activity.\n\n## Protecting sensitive data\n\n\n-----\n\nThe example above demonstrates that even the smallest of companies can fall victim to an\nattack. Small and medium-sized enterprises are targeted because they own important data\nand IP, yet often lack robust security and resources. This makes them simple catches\ncompared to large establishments or governments.\n\nDarktrace’s AI has the ability to detect malicious data exfiltration from subtle changes in\nbehavior. In this case, the targeted server regularly transfers data in and out of the\norganization, yet Darktrace scored the incoming external IP with the highest rarity. In other\nwords, Darktrace considered the data transfer activity highly unusual and outside of the\nserver’s normal ‘pattern of life’.\n\nThis enabled the security team to respond to the threat and take the server offline for further\n[investigation. If Darktrace Antigena had been active in the environment, it would have](http://10.10.0.46/network)\nresponded seconds after the initial compromise, stopping the threat at machine speed.\n\nThanks to Darktrace analyst Kendra Gonzalez Duran for her insights on the above threat\nfind.\n\n[Learn how to defend your company from data exfiltration and malicious insiders](http://10.10.0.46/resources/ds-insider-threats.pdf)\n\n**Darktrace model detections:**\n\nCompliance / Incoming Remote Desktop\nCompliance / Possible Unencrypted Password File On Server\nAnomalous Connection/ Data Sent to Rare Domain\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed:**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\nCredential\naccess\n\n\nT1078 – Valid Accounts\n\nT1552.001 – Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files\n\n\nExfiltration T1048.003 – Exfiltrate Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over\nUnencrypted/Obfuscated Non-C2 Protocol\n\n## Max Heinemeyer\n\nMax is a cyber security expert with over a decade of experience in the field, specializing in a\nwide range of areas such as Penetration Testing, Red-Teaming, SIEM and SOC consulting\nand hunting Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.
