    "plain_text": "# BRONZE VINEWOOD Targets Supply Chains\n\n**[secureworks.com/research/bronze-vinewood-targets-supply-chains](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-vinewood-targets-supply-chains)**\n\nThe following analysis was compiled and published to Threat Intelligence clients in April\n2019. The Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team is publicly sharing\n[insights about BRONZE VINEWOOD and its use of the HanaLoader malware and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronz-vinewood-uses-hanaloader-to-target-government-supply-chain)\n[DropboxAES RAT to increase visibility of the threat group’s activities.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/dropboxaes-remote-access-trojan)\n\n## Summary\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD (also known as APT31 and ZIRCONIUM) is a targeted threat\ngroup that has been active since at least June 2016. There has been limited public\n[information about the group, other than a February 2019 report describing attacks](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0206.pdf)\nagainst Norwegian software provider Visma and multiple U.S. companies. However, that\nreport misattributes the activity to BRONZE RIVERSIDE (also known as APT10).\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers assess that the group is likely\nbased in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The threat actors have used a range of\ntools and techniques to target organizations that provide legal, consulting, and software\ndevelopment services. CTU™ analysis suggests that organizations that are part of\ngovernment or defense supply chains or that provide services to organizations in those\nverticals may be of interest to BRONZE VINEWOOD.\n\n[CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections:](https://www.gartner.com/doc/2487216/definition-threat-intelligence)\nstrategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to\ndetermine how to reduce risk to their organization’s mission and critical assets. Computer\nnetwork defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response\ninvestigations and research to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to\nthe threat group’s activities.\n\n## Key points\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD is a PRC-based threat group that has targeted data across a\nwide range of organizations. The breadth of this targeting suggests that the group\ncollects intelligence against a diverse set of requirements.\nAttacks on software providers and other supply chain organizations were likely\nintended to access customers’ data or networks. Other China-based threat groups\nsuch as BRONZE ATLAS (also known as BARIUM) and BRONZE RIVERSIDE (also\nknown as APT 10) also compromise supply chains to reach their intended targets.\nBRONZE VINEWOOD employs a variety of tools and techniques to gain access to\ntarget environments. Its use of public code or file-sharing websites for its command\nand control (C2) domains can complicate network-based detection because the C2\ntraffic is interspersed amid legitimate web browsing activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Strategic threat intelligence\n\nAnalysis of a threat group’s targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which\norganizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic\ndefensive decisions regarding this threat.\n\n### Intent\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD compromises organizations that might have information of value\nto the PRC. The threat group’s intelligence gathering requirements appear to include\nintellectual property, information that provides a commercial advantage, and details\nabout government and defense targets. The BRONZE VINEWOOD activity observed by\nCTU researchers has affected organizations in the U.S. and Europe.\n\n### Attribution\n\nThe attribution of BRONZE VINEWOOD to the PRC is based on an aggregation of\nmultiple factors:\n\nThe information and organizations targeted by BRONZE VINEWOOD, particularly\nthe emphasis on organizations that provide services to defense or government\norganizations, align with Chinese government interests.\nThe threat actors use techniques that are most commonly associated with Chinese\n[espionage groups such as BRONZE RIVERSIDE, BRONZE UNION, and BRONZE](https://www.secureworks.com/research/a-peek-into-bronze-unions-toolbox)\nHUNTLEY (also known as Tonto Team).\n\n### Capability\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD has deployed a variety of tools across different incidents, and\n[reported use of a zero-day exploit for the CVE-2017-0005 privilege escalation](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/03/27/detecting-and-mitigating-elevation-of-privilege-exploit-for-cve-2017-0005/)\nvulnerability demonstrates technical proficiency. CTU researchers assess that the threat\ngroup’s use of available or modified open-source tools is to avoid attribution or avoid\nwasting development resources. The decision to use open-source tools is an increasingly\ncommon trend among sophisticated threat actors and is often not driven by technical or\nresource limitations. The threat actors also leverage popular code and file-sharing sites\nfor their C2 domains. This relatively uncommon technique makes detection within a busy\ncorporate environment challenging and suggests technical proficiency and an awareness\nof operational security and tradecraft.\n\n## Tactical threat intelligence\n\nIncident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the threat\ngroup’s tools and tactics.\n\n### Tools\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders have observed BRONZE\nVINEWOOD using the following tools:\n\n[Mimikatz — This ubiquitous credential-theft tool is used by a wide range of threat](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nactors and security testers.\n\n[HanaLoader (also known as FANNYPACK) — This downloader is executed using](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronz-vinewood-uses-hanaloader-to-target-government-supply-chain)\n[DLL search order hijacking and attempts to retrieve and run a payload over HTTPS.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1038/)\nCTU analysis suggests that HanaLoader is used to launch a small number of\npayloads, including a remote access trojan (RAT) that was named HanaGift based\non a string in the file’s application manifest. HanaGift may also be referred to as\nHanaRAT.\n\n[Meterpreter — This extensible payload is part of the publicly available and widely](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/about-meterpreter/)\n[used Metasploit Framework.](https://www.metasploit.com/)\n\n[Trochilus — This RAT was first identified in 2015 and has been implicated in](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/trochilus)\n[various attacks against organizations in Myanmar and Thailand. The source code is](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/trochilus-rat-targets-government-myanmar/article/1477758)\navailable from public code-sharing sites and was the basis for the RedLeaves RAT\nused by BRONZE RIVERSIDE. BRONZE VINEWOOD uses a modified version of\n[Trochilus that supplements the default RC4 encryption with Salsa20 encryption and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20)\nis launched via DLL search order hijacking.\n\n[DropboxAES RAT — This simple RAT uses Dropbox for command and control,](https://www.secureworks.com/research/dropboxaes-remote-access-trojan)\nrelies on ChaCha20 to encrypt communications data, and is launched using DLL\nsearch order hijacking.\n\nPowerShell-Github-Shell — This reverse shell is available from GitHub and was\nused against U.S. legal organizations in mid-2017. When executed, it contacts a\n[GitHub gist account using a hard-coded authentication token and then retrieves](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists)\ncommands and posts data via the gist’s comment section.\n\nNative operating system and Sysinternals tools — BRONZE VINEWOOD has used\n[PowerShell for code execution, curl to send and retrieve data, and ProcDump to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)\ndump running processes. Attackers commonly use ProcDump rather than a more\nsuspicious tool such as Mimikatz to obtain hashed passwords from memory.\n\nVariations on Sysinternals tools — CTU analysis suggests that BRONZE\n[VINEWOOD has used command-line tools such as NetSess to enumerate NetBIOS](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/netsess/index.htm)\n[sessions on a specified local or remote computer and LG.exe to manage domain](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/lg/index.htm)\ngroups.\n\n### Reconnaissance and initial access\n\n\n-----\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD tailors attacks to its intended victims. For example, the names of\ndomains used for command and control during network intrusions have mimicked\nproduct names used by the target.\n\nIn one 2017 campaign, the threat actors targeted U.S. legal organizations via SQL\ninjection attacks against a third-party software application predominantly used by\ncompanies in that sector. The SQL injection string attempted to launch PowerShell via the\n[xp_cmdshell stored procedure. If successful, this command downloaded and executed in](https://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3372131/Using-xpcmdshell.htm)\nmemory the PowerShell-Github-Shell script hosted as a seemingly innocuous file on a\nGitHub repository (see Figure 1). The profile attached to the GitHub repository was\ncreated shortly before the campaign commenced. This script can be used to enumerate\nsystem information, download files, and run commands using PowerShell or the\nWindows command prompt.\n\n_Figure 1. Injected SQL string used to download PowerShell malware from GitHub._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn other cases, the threat actors likely leveraged stolen credentials to gain initial access,\nsometimes through redundant remote access points that might have less monitoring than\nlive access points. CTU researchers suspect that the initial attack phases are preceded by\ncareful reconnaissance of potential targets.\n\n### Maintaining access and credential theft\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD attempts to steal credentials and use legitimate remote access\nsolutions and protocols, including tunneling RDP over HTTP, to access the environment.\nSecureworks incident responders observed the threat actors conducting credential dumps\nroughly once every four weeks using Mimikatz installed on compromised domain\ncontrollers. CTU researchers also observed this behavior from the BRONZE UNION\nthreat group and suspect it is a conscious effort to extract credentials within the likely\nrolling window of an organization’s password reset policy. In some cases, BRONZE\nVINEWOOD leveraged ProcDump to dump the memory space for the lsass.exe process\nand used another offline tool to extract the passwords.\n\nPersistence mechanisms observed by CTU researchers include the use of Task Scheduler\nand Windows services to launch malware (see Figure 2) or to directly initiate outbound\nTCP connections (see Figure 3). The threat group tends to use the same name (e.g.,\nsystemsvc) for all malicious services within a compromised environment, which can be a\nuseful detection mechanism.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Task Scheduler launching legitimate Microsoft executable to side load_\n_Trochilus. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n_Figure 3. Service used to launch an outbound TCP request. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Discovery and lateral movement\n\nLike other targeted threats, BRONZE VINEWOOD uses a variety of native operating\nsystem and publicly available tools for network discovery and lateral movement. For\nexample, CTU researchers have observed the threat actors using NetSess and LG.exe for\n[network discovery and the invoke-SMBExec PowerShell script for lateral movement. In](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash/blob/master/Invoke-SMBExec.ps1)\none incident, BRONZE VINEWOOD unsuccessfully used a compromised Kerberos ticketgranting account to cut Kerberos tickets to authenticate to network resources. This\nbehavior highlights the importance of double-resetting Kerberos accounts during\n[evictions to clear old passwords.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/ad-forest-recovery-resetting-the-krbtgt-password)\n\n### Command and control\n\nThe threat group is notable for its use of file and code-sharing sites, such as Dropbox and\nGitHub, for command and control of its malware. For example, the DropboxAES RAT\n[used content . dropboxapi . com, the hostname for the deprecated Dropbox API version 1,](https://www.dropbox.com/developers-v1)\nfor its C2 server. Similar to other China-based threat groups, BRONZE VINEWOOD often\n“parks” its C2 domains on 127.0.0.1 when not in use.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Collection and exfiltration\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD focuses on stealing data from target networks. The threat actors\ncollate data of interest on a central host, package the data using a compression tool such\nas WinRAR, and then exfiltrate the data by using the curl utility or by copying it during\nsessions established with stolen credentials. CTU researchers have observed the threat\nactors using simple passwords such as ‘123456’ (see Figure 4) as well as more complex\npasswords.\n\n_Figure 4. Compressed archive of exfiltrated data protected with a simple password._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBRONZE VINEWOOD remains an active threat as of this publication. Its targeting of a\nrange of organizations suggest that the threat actors focus on data of interest rather than\non specific verticals. Organizations that provide software or other services to defense and\ngovernment agencies, or organizations such as legal firms that aggregate defense and\ngovernment data, are likely to be at increased risk from BRONZE VINEWOOD. The use of\nfairly unsophisticated tools and techniques is likely a conscious choice. Evidence gleaned\nfrom network intrusions demonstrates that the threat group can successfully leverage\npublicly available tools and use popular file and code-sharing websites to blend C2 traffic\nwith legitimate network traffic.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 1 are associated with BRONZE VINEWOOD activity.
