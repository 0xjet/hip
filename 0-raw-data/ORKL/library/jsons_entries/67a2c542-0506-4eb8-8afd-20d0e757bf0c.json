According to an**\nupdate provided by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Research Associate for Defence and\nMilitary Analysis, Henry Boyd, their current assessment is as follows: “excluding the Naval Infantry battalion in the\nCrimea which was effectively captured wholesale, the Ukrainian Armed Forces lost between 15% and 20% of their\npre-war D–30 inventory in combat operations.”\n\n[In June CrowdStrike identified and attributed a series of targeted intrusions at the Democratic National Committee](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/)\n(DNC), and other political organizations that utilized a well known implant commonly called X-Agent. X-Agent is a\ncross platform remote access toolkit, variants have been identified for various Windows operating systems, Apple’s\niOS, and likely the MacOS. Also known as Sofacy, X-Agent has been tracked by the security community for almost a\n[decade, CrowdStrike associates the use of X-Agent with an actor we call FANCY BEAR. This actor to date is the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/)\nexclusive operator of the malware, and has continuously developed the platform for ongoing operations which\nCrowdStrike assesses is likely tied to Russian Military Intelligence (GRU). The source code to this malware has not\nbeen observed in the public domain and appears to have been developed uniquely by FANCY BEAR.\n\n\n-----\n\nlanguage artifacts that were military in nature. Initial research identified that the filename suggested a relationship to\nthe D-30 122mm towed howitzer, an artillery weapon first manufactured in the Soviet Union in the 1960s but still in\nuse today. In-depth reverse engineering revealed the APK contained an Android variant of X-Agent, the command\nand control protocol was closely linked to observed Windows variants of X-Agent, and utilized a cryptographic\nalgorithm called RC4 with a very similar 50 byte base key.\n\nThe filename ‘Попр-Д30.apk’ was linked to a legitimate application which was initially developed domestically within\nUkraine by an officer of the 55th Artillery Brigade named Yaroslav Sherstuk. In media interviews Mr. Sherstuk claims\nthat the application, which had some 9000 users, reduced the time to fire the D-30 from minutes to seconds. No\nevidence of the application has been observed on the Android app store, making it unlikely that the app was\ndistributed via that platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n_D-30 Howitzer in service with Ukrainian military personnel_\n\nToday CrowdStrike is releasing publicly an [intelligence report which was circulated to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/idc-vendor-profile-crowdstrike-2/) CrowdStrike Falcon\nIntelligence customers detailing the use of the trojanized ‘Попр-Д30.apk’ application by the Ukrainian military and\nthe deadly repercussions inflicted on that platform by Russian forces. The key points of this report are:\n\nFrom late 2014 and through 2016, FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant was covertly distributed on Ukrainian\nmilitary forums within a legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery officer Yaroslav\nSherstuk.\n\nThe original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30\nHowitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to under 15 seconds.\nAccording to Sherstuk’s interviews with the press, over 9000 artillery personnel have been using the\napplication in Ukrainian military.\n\nSuccessful deployment of the FANCY BEAR malware within this application may have facilitated\nreconnaissance against Ukrainian troops. The ability of this malware to retrieve communications and gross\nlocational data from an infected device makes it an attractive way to identify the general location of Ukrainian\nartillery forces and engage them.\n\nOpen source reporting indicates that Ukrainian artillery forces have lost over 50% of their weapons in the 2\nyears of conflict and over 80% of D-30 howitzers, the highest percentage of loss of any other artillery pieces\nin Ukraine’s arsenal.\n\nThis previously unseen variant of X-Agent represents FANCY BEAR’s expansion in mobile malware\ndevelopment from iOS-capable implants to Android devices, and reveals one more component of the broad\nspectrum approach to cyber operations taken by Russia-based actors in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe collection of such tactical artillery force positioning intelligence by FANCY BEAR further supports\nC dSt ik ’ i t th t FANCY BEAR i lik l ffili t d ith th R i ilit\n\n\n-----\n\nregions in Russia.\n\nThe following Snort rule matches on the X-Agent-Android C2 beacon request:\n\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (\\\nmsg: “CrowdStrike FANCY BEAR X-Agent Android C2 Request”; \\\nflow: established,to_server; \\\ncontent: “lm=”; http_uri; \\\npcre: “/^\\/(watch|search|find|results|open|close)\\/\\?/U”; \\\npcre: “/[\\?\\&](text|from|ags|oe|aq|btnG|oprnd)=/U”; \\\nclasstype: trojan-activity; metadata: service http; \\\nsid: XXXX; rev: 20160815;)\n\nJoin Dmitri Alperovitch and me live on January 4, 2017 at 2pm EST for Bear Hunting: History and Attribution of\n[Russian Intelligence Operations to learn more about FANCY BEAR and linkages to the GRU.
