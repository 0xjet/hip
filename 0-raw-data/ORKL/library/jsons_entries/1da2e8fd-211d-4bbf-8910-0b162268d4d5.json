    "plain_text": "# Desorden Group claims to have stolen 200 GB of data from ABX Express\n\n**[databreaches.net/desorden-group-claims-to-have-stolen-200-gb-of-data-from-abx-express/](https://www.databreaches.net/desorden-group-claims-to-have-stolen-200-gb-of-data-from-abx-express/)**\n\nDataBreaches.net has been contacted by a threat actor or group calling themselves\n[“Desorden Group” (“Desorden”). The group claims to have hacked ABX Express Enterprise](http://www.abxexpress.com.my/)\nservers in Malaysia on September 23.\n\nWe have stolen more than 200 gigabytes of files and databases, tens of millions of\ncustomers personal data from their servers, wiped their drives and left a note about the\ndata breach on their servers.\n\n[ABX] took down their services entirely, informing their customers that they were\nperforming system maintenance, instead of announcing the data breach.\n\nBy the time DataBreaches.net checked ABX’s web site today, there was no evidence of any\nmaintenance notice.\n\nAs proof of their claims, Desorden uploaded two files to a file-sharing service for journalists\nto download. One showed directories of folders and files on drives C, D, and E. There was\nalso a file with a report that dealt with shipping orders.\n\nABX Express is a subsidiary of Kerry Logistics. Desorden claims the breach involves millions\nof Malaysian customers’ personal data, with the airway bill database containing more than 15\nmillion records that each contain information on both sender and receiver. Other databases\nreportedly include financial information, customer, and corporate records.\n\nDue to the fact that ecommerce platforms share their shopper personal data with\nlogistic companies for delivery, this data breach also involved customer personal data\nfrom their partners (Lazada, Shopee, etc.). Their source code files of apps and\nindividual web services have also been stolen by us.\n\nWhen DataBreaches.net’s email to ABX bounced back as rejected due to possible spam,\nand their web site contact form did not work, DataBreaches.net sent a contact form inquiry to\nKerry Logistics to ask them about the claimed breach. An acknowledgement was received\nbut no response has been received as of the time of this publication.\n\nIn addition to contacting journalists, Desorden Group also created a listing on a popular\nforum for buying, trading, or selling data. In that listing, they also offered 100,000 airway bills,\nand said they would be uploading more data.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Forum listing. Redacted by DataBreaches.net\nWhen asked how they were able to gain access to ABX, Desorden answered:\n\nWe breached their intranet servers through their front-facing server and maintained\nAPT on servers. They recovered most of their source codes with backups, and are still\nrecovering databases.\n\nThe threat actors also told DataBreaches.net that their victim did not respond at all to their\nnotes.\n\n## Who is Desorden Group?\n\nIn follow-up communications with DataBreaches.net, Desorden described themselves as\nformer associates of Chaos. They:\n\nReformed ourselves as Desorden Group which stands for Chaos & Disorder. You might\npreviously know us as ChaosCC but today we no longer have associations with\nChaosCC.\n\nAs they describe themselves, their targets are supply chain networks and public services,\n“the name chaos & disorder.”\n\nDesorden attacks on supply chains create higher level of disorder & chaos affecting\nmany parties rather than the victim itself. If victim fails to pay, Desorden sells the data\non black market in a few days. We have another automotive supply chain victim in\nItaly under negotiation. We will update if it fails.\n\nThis post will be updated if a reply is received from Kerry Logistics or more information\nbecomes available.\n\n## Related Posts:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Another Malaysia carrier allegedly hacked and data…](https://www.databreaches.net/another-malaysia-carrier-allegedly-hacked-and-data-exfiltrated-skynet/)\n[Desorden Group expands attack on Central Group after deal to…](https://www.databreaches.net/desorden-group-expands-attack-on-central-group-after-deal-to-pay-them-allegedly-fell-through/)\n[Acer under fire: Now hackers claim to have hit Acer Taiwan,…](https://www.databreaches.net/acer-under-fire-now-hackers-claim-to-have-hit-acer-taiwan-too/)\n[Acer India hacked -- again?](https://www.databreaches.net/acer-india-hacked-again/)\n[Central Restaurants Group in Thailand hit by Desorden](https://www.databreaches.net/central-restaurants-group-in-thailand-hit-by-desorden/)\n\n\n-----",
