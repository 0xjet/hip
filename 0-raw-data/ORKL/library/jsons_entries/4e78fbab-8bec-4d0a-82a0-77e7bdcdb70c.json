Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component\nof APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to\nopen documents or click on links in unsolicited emails. Watering hole attacks offer a much\nbetter chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and\ninstalling malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular\nwebsites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to\nwhich the actors want to gain access.\n\nThe attacks discussed in this blog are related to an APT campaign commonly referred to as\n“th3bug”, named for the password the actors often use with their Poison Ivy malware. Of\nnote, only the older of the samples we cover in this blog used that password. We don’t know\nthe reason the actors changed this, but it could possibly be in reaction to information widely\npublished on the Internet about their activities, which use that password as a key component\nto tie the activity together. [FireEye in particular published a paper describing several APT](http://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-poison-ivy-report.pdf)\ncampaigns whose activity they correlate using Poison Ivy passwords.\n\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to\ngain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors\nare likely to frequent. Over the summer they compromised several sites, including a wellknown Uyghur website written in that native language.\n\nWhile we were unable to recover the initial vulnerability used, it is possibly the same CVE\n[2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit first reported by Cisco TRAC in late July. We cannot confirm](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/far-east-targeted-by-drive-by/)\nthe initial compromised sites, but we noted traffic to several known re-direct sites and the\nmalware was configured to use the same command and control (C2) server.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the download dates of many of our files pre-date those noted by Cisco by only a\nfew days. All of the malware were variants of the Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool\n(RAT) and were properly identified as such by our WildFire platform. The targets of the\nattack were:\n\nUyghur sympathizers\nAn East Asian office for a major US based computer manufacturer\nA major US university\nAn international wholesale and retail telecom provider\n\nWe saw the first sample on July 14, 2014. This sample had an interesting PDB string - C:\n\\Users\\sophie\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\init\\Release\\init.pdb with a time date\nstring that exactly matched the PE timestamp of 11 July, 2014.\n\n## Table 1\n\n**SHA256** ba509a1d752f3165dc2821e0b1c6543c15988fd7abd4e56c6155de09d1640ce9\n\n**MD5** 18ad696f3459bf47f97734f2f14506e3\n\n**File Name** diff.exe\n\n**File Size** 97280\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-14 13:55:36\n\n\n**Download**\n**URL**\n\n\nwww.npec.com .tw/flash/diff.exe\n\n\n**Resolution** 203.69.42.22\n\n\n**C2**\n**Domain**\n\n\ndiff.qohub.info\n\n\n**Resolution** 115.23.172.151\n\nThe next day we collected several copies of the same malware intended for the same\nindustry. They were downloaded from one of the download URLs in the below table, but all\nhad the same MD5 and C2 domain.\n\n## Table 2\n\n**SHA256** 9d149baceaaff2a67161fec9b8978abc22f0a73a1c8ce87edf6e2fb673ac7374\n\n**MD5** 1ea41812a0114e5c6ae76330e7b4af69\n\n**File Name** diff.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n**File Size** 126976\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-15 18:22:25\n\n\n**Download**\n**URLs**\n\n\nwww.aanon.com .tw/flash/diff.exewww.npec.com\n.tw/flash/diff.exeuyghurweb .net/player/gmuweb.exe\n\n\n**Resolution** 203.69.42.22\n\n**C2 Domain** diff.qohub.info\n\n**Resolution** 115.23.172.151\n\nOn July 16 WildFire picked up a malicious executable hosted on uyghurweb.net, a legitimate\nUyghur website that was compromised to infect users. The file was named “PYvBte.jar” but\nwas actually a Windows executable. The file has the characteristics listed in Table 3, and\nappears to be a stand-alone executable version of the Metasploit Meterpreter shell. When\nthis file runs, it downloads a payload from uyghurweb.net/player/gmuweb.exe and executes\nit. This file is the same Poison Ivy RAT described in Table 2.\n\nThe Meterpreter payload masquerades as a copy of the ApacheBench tool made by the\nApache Software Foundation.\n\n## Table 3\n\n**SHA256** ccfe61a28f35161c19340541dfd839075e31cd3b661f0936a4c667d805a65136\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** 7b0cb4d14d3d8b6ccc7453f7ddb33997\n\n**File Name** PYvBte.jar\n\n**File Size** 73802\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-16 01:42:24\n\n\n**Download**\n**URL**\n\n\nuyghurweb .net/player/PYvBte.jar\n\n\nOn 21 July, we detected another sample that was noted in the Cisco TRAC blog. The initial\ndownload URL and IP resolution were different than the previous samples, but the C2\ndomain and resolution matched. This file is also a Poison Ivy variant.\n\n## Table 4\n\n**SHA256** 7f39e5b9d46386dd8142ef40ae526343274bdd5f27e38c07b457d290a277e807\n\n**MD5** efad656db0f9cc92b1e15dc9c540e407\n\n**File Name** setup.exe\n\n**File Size** 126976\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-21 05:09:56\n\n\n**Download**\n**URL**\n\n\nwww.ep66.com .tw/setup.exe\n\n\n**Resolution** 203.69.42.23\n\n\n**C2**\n**Domain**\n\n\napp.qohub.info\n\n\n**Resolution** 115.23.172.151\n\nBased on historical IP resolution overlaps between the above C2 domains and other\ndomains that have also resolved to the same IPs, we found an additional sample from the\nbeginning of this year.\n\nInterestingly, the first sample was not logged in VirusTotal prior to our submission, despite\nthe sample having been in use in the wild for at least seven months. In addition, it is the only\nsample tied to this activity we found that used the Poison Ivy password “th3bug”. AVAST\nwrote a [blog related to the activity we describe here and tied a file with the same name, but](https://blog.avast.com/2013/01/22/reporters-without-borders-website-misused-in-wateringhole-attack/)\nthe sample we found doesn’t match any other details of the file they documented.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso of note, the IP resolution for this C2 domain was changed to match the IP resolution of\nthe C2 domains used in the July activity only a few days after these samples were seen.\nAdditionally, the files PE timestamp was January 21, the day before we detected the sample.\nTargeted industries for this series are listed below.\n\nAnother international wholesale and retail telecom provider\nA major visual computing company headquartered in the US\nA state-owned East Asian financial services company\n\n## Table 5\n\n**SHA256** e3d02e5f69d3c2092657d64c39aa0aea2a16ce804a47f3b5cf44774cde3166fe\n\n**MD5** 0cabd6aec2555e64bdf39320f338e027\n\n**File Name** AppletLow.jar\n\n**File Size** 53248\n\n**First Seen** 2014-01-22 18:47:03\n\n\n**Download**\n**URL**\n\n**C2**\n**Domain**\n\n\n140.112.158 .132/phpmyadmin/test/AppletLow.jar\n\n2014year.qpoe .com\n\n\n**Resolution** 192.168.1.3\n\nWatering hole attacks will continue to be popular with APT campaigns, as they are much\nharder to defend against then spear phishing attacks. There is no way for people browsing to\nthese websites to know in advance the normally trusted website has been compromised and\nwill serve them malware when they visit it.\n\nEnsuring web browsers and operating system software is fully patched and up-to-date is the\nbest way to defend against this type of threat. However, to increase success rates APT\ncampaigns can use zero-day exploits, so even a properly patched system would be\ncompromised. Palo Alto Networks users should use our firewall’s ability to block executable\ndownloads unless the user specifically authorizes it. If you want to allow executables through\nbut prefer that they be analyzed for malicious activity, use our WildFire platform, which\ncorrectly identified all of the files listed in this blog as malware and provides users with a full\nreport on the samples host and network-based activities.\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\n\n-----\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
