Its name stems from the heavy usage of XOR encryption in both\nmalware and network communication to the C&Cs. It is built for multiple Linux architectures\nlike ARM, x86 and x64. Noteworthy about XOR DDoS is the ability to hide itself with an\nembedded rootkit component which is obtained by multiple installation steps. [1] It was\n[discovered in September 2014 by MalwareMustDie, a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MalwareMustDie) [white hat malware research group. [2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security))\n\n\n\n[3][4] From November 2014 it was involved in massive brute force campaign that lasted at\n\nleast for three months. [5]\n\nIn order to gain access it launches a brute force attack in order to discover the password to\nSecure Shell services on Linux.[6] Once Secure Shell credentials are acquired and login is\nsuccessful, it uses root privileges to run a script that downloads and installs XOR DDoS.[7] It\nis believed to be of Asian origin based on its targets, which tend to be located in Asia.
