Although not well described by the global\ncybersecurity industry, the actors in charge of generating non-legitimate traffic play a key\n**role in the distribution of threats, as well as the underground economy.**\n\nCommonly referred to as traffers (from the Russian word “Траффер”, also referred to as\n“worker” in the underground community), these actors are responsible for redirecting user’s\ntraffic to malicious content (malware, fraud, phishing, scam, etc.) operated by others. They\n**monetise the traffic to these botnet operators who intend to compromise users either widely,**\nor specifically to a region, or an operating system. The main challenge facing traffer is\ntherefore to generate high-quality traffic without bots, undetected or analysed by security\nvendors, and eventually filtered by traffic type. In other words, traffers’ activity is a form of\n**lead generation.**\n\nTo generate traffic, traffers lure users from legitimate or compromised websites to redirect them\nto a server, a website, or malicious content operated by the botnet owner. Some sophisticated\ntraffers make use of the Traffic Distribution System (TDS) to operate and redirect traffic. This\ntool allows traffers to filter traffic based on its characteristics, such as location, operating\nsystem, and HTTP headers, enabling them to sell high-quality traffic to threat actors with\nspecific targets. Other traffers focus on generating traffic to a very large audience over a short\nperiod of time while avoiding detection.\n\nAs part of a growing trend, numerous traffers join a team to distribute information-stealing\n**malware on behalf of the team administrator(s). In these teams, traffers can both be highly**\nskilled threat actors and newcomers in the threat landscape, as they usually get training\nsessions when hired by a team. These groups are therefore a gateway into the cybercrime\necosystem for newcomers. Administrator(s) of the traffers team gather the user’s logs (stolen\ninformation including cookies, passwords, crypto wallets, documents, etc.) to exploit or sell\nthem.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the first half of 2022, SEKOIA identified an increase in the use of information-stealing\nmalware as the preferred commodity malware for cybercriminals. We observed this trend\nthrough our Darkweb monitoring routine, our information stealers related indicators of\ncompromise trackers, and our insights of the threat landscape. These observations led us to\nanalyse the main methods of distribution of this threat, as well as the organisation of traffers\ndelivering stealers.\n\nTraffers teams dealing with stealers are mostly found on Russian-speaking cybercrime forums,\nespecially for recruitment purposes. SEKOIA observed hundreds of advertisements aiming at\nrecruiting traffers to distribute information stealers. Further investigation led us to identify a\n\n\n-----\n\n**structure and a common modus operandi to most traffers teams distributing stealers.**\nWe also share information on the main infection chain used by traffers dealing with\ninformation stealers and their arsenal.\n\nThis report is based on data collected from the Lolz Guru and BHF cybercrime forums between\nJanuary and mid-August 2022. We focused our analysis on traffers’ activity related to\n**information stealer distribution.**\n\n## Traffers distributing stealers: an immersion in the world of highly proliferating cybercriminals\n\n### Traffers teams as part of the cybercrime ecosystem\n\nSimilarly to other threat actors in the continuously professionalising cybercrime landscape,\ntraffers are either operating on their own, or join a team, called “traffers team”.\n\nTraffers teams operating on cybercrime forums display different focuses, some scamming NFT\n(Non-Fungible Token) or crypto currency owners, others targeting online casino users. Several\nof them deliver malware, such as RAT (Remote Access Trojan), miner or information-stealing\nmalware. SEKOIA observed that more than 90% of traffers teams operate information stealers,\neither commercial or developed within the team ones. Some even operate two or three\nstealers.\n\nMost of the traffers teams SEKOIA monitored operate on Russian-speaking cybercrime\nforums, e.g. Lolz Guru and BHF forums, commonly referred to as “social engineering forums”\nin the underground community. These forums are used to advertise products and services, to\nannounce the emergence of new teams, and to collect reviews to gain visibility. In parallel, the\nTelegram instant messaging service is leveraged to organise teams’ activities. The majority of\ninvestigated traffers are native Russian speakers.\n\nFrom our observations, a team can grow to hundreds, even thousands of members (e.g.\nTigerTeams had over 200 members and 340 bot subscriptions in April 2022 and BandanaTeam\ndeclared more than 5000 team members in July 2022).\n\nTo better understand the evolution of the traffers-related threat, we monitored the emerging\ntraffers teams on the Lolz Guru underground forum since early 2022.\n\nWe registered 125 traffers teams created since January 2022 on the Lolz Guru forum’s\n“Traffers” section. At least half of them were still active during the last month.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Number of newly launched traffers teams by month in 2022 (Source: Lolz Guru_\n_forum, Traffers section)_\n\nThe longevity of a traffers team is complex to assess. As the resources involved remain fairly\naccessible, teams demonstrated flexibility in reorganising themselves, by merging with other\nteams or simply restarting from scratch. According to a declaration of the Dead Team’s\nadministrator in June 2022, it cost him $3,000 to build a team of 600 traffers before selling it.\nAnother example, the entire infrastructure of TigersTeam (between 200 and 340 traffers) was\nput on sale for $300 in April 2022, and the Moon Team (1000 traffers) was priced at $2, 300 in\nMay 2022. Based on several publications collected on the Lolz Guru forum, this represents an\n“investment” that can break even in less than a month.\n\n### A spotlight on a typical traffers team organisation\n\nA traffers team is an organised, centrally managed structure headed by one or several team\nadministrators. Here is an overview of a typical traffers team and its interactions within the\ncybercrime ecosystem:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Overview of a typical traffers team structure and its interactions_\n\n**Team administrators’ role**\n\nTeam administrators hire traffers in charge of generating traffic to distribute stealer builds.\n\nA team administrator is responsible for the management of all tasks complementary to traffic\ngeneration. This notably includes getting a stealer licence and sharing builds ready for\ndistribution to the team members, checking the received logs for validity, and exploiting them\nquickly.\n\nTherefore, team administrators provide their team members a kit containing the following\nresources:\n\nBuilds automatically generated and pushed to traffers by a Telegram bot;\nA crypter service to encrypt or obfuscate malware builds to evade detection solutions;\nA “traffer’s manual” which includes guidelines for team members and full technical\nsupport. Team administrators can draft a handbook by themselves or they can use the\nservices of an independent third party writing a traffer’s manual as-a-service;\n\n\n-----\n\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) services to improve the visibility of videos uploaded\non YouTube using the 911 scheme (the 911 scheme is detailed later in the report and the\nAnnex 2 illustrates the infection chain);\nA YouTube uploader software or a YouTube uploading service (by hiring a dedicated\nteam member responsible for uploading on YouTube on behalf of traffers);\nA Telegram channel for communication and support within the team;\nA Telegram bot for automating tasks, such as sharing new malware builds, statistics,\nmoney earned by the traffer;\nA dedicated service for parsing, processing, exploiting and selling logs. The team\nadministrators coordinate the process of log qualification and analysis, extraction of logs\nof interest, and exploitation.\n\nTeam administrators prompt recruited members to distribute the builds widely, to generate a\nlarge volume of logs via stealer infections, and reward them based on a formula in which both\nquantity and quality of the collected information are taken into account.\n\nTeam administrators regularly organise competitions in which traffers are challenged to collect\na maximum of logs, i.e. distribute a maximum number of builds. Winners are awarded with\ncash prizes, and upgraded to a Pro version of the membership. The Pro version unlocks\naccess to a second stealer, traffers are invited to a private Telegram channel, they get better\nservices (like SEO and else) and bonuses.\n\nTraffers team’s primary interest lies in crypto wallets logs.The generated revenue through\nexploitation is shared with the traffer who submitted the logs (who gets from 60% to 90% of the\nrevenue). A team might also extract and resell video games, e-commerce and social network\naccounts. The remaining logs are transferred back to the traffers to be reused.\n\nLogs selling price within the underground community varies widely depending on their validity\nand the information they contain. Generally, the more recent a log is, the highest the probability\nof containing active cookies, the more it is wanted.\n\n**Traffers’ role within a team**\n\nOnce a traffer joined a team, it is able to make requests to a Telegram bot for builds to receive\na malware sample. A traffer can make multiple requests to this bot, the number of builds it can\ngenerate being limited to a daily quota, as defined by team administrator(s).\n\nWhen joining teams, traffers often have to abide by a number of requirements at the risk of\nbeing expelled. Requirements include:\n\nThey can not use their own malware or glue a malware to the one delivered by the team,\ndistributing ransomware is also forbidden;\nThey can not share the received build with third parties;\nThey can not check the build on online services such as VirusTotal;\nThey can not be inactive for more than two weeks in a row.\n\n\n-----\n\nSEKOIA assess that this serves to frame the traffers activity to avoid abusive behaviour that\ncould lead to burning the C2 server. This is also a way to avoid an improper mass distribution\nof builds on channels easily detectable by security vendors.\n\nOnce a traffer gets a build, it is responsible for spreading the malware using the team’s\ndelivery methods, or its own infection chain.\n\nTraffers can also distribute their own information stealer, and monetize the collected logs by\nthemselves by selling them on underground marketplaces. They can as well steal\ncryptocurrency from crypto wallets without integrating an organised team. Nevertheless, from\nour observations, joining a team is largely preferred by traffers, as it comes along with a\nnumber of advantages, to name a few:\n\nExperience is not mandatory – newcomers are welcomed and trained;\nNecessary tools are accessible and ready to use – traffers have no extra costs related to\nthe stealer, crypter and other software;\nTraffers capitalise on the different services provided by their team administrator(s);\nTechnical support is guaranteed;\nTraffers team operators monetize collected logs immediately, as fresh and bulk logs are\nmore valuable.\n\nAt the same time, the interest of traffers teams representatives in hiring a large number of\ntraffers lies in having access to large volumes of fresh data when cumulating all the\nsubmissions.\n\n## Modus Operandi observed in traffers teams dealing with stealers\n\nTraffers working with information-stealing malware are free to generate traffic and distribute the\nprovided builds using their own methods, as long as they comply with the team requirements.\nEach traffer therefore sets up and operates its own delivery chain.\n\nHowever, the majority of traffers teams SEKOIA observed provide tools and services to assist\ntheir members in generating traffic from YouTube videos. Most of them therefore use the tools\nmade available to set up their delivery chain. This infection chain, that consists in luring users\nfrom the legitimate YouTube website to redirect them to the malicious content, is called 911 in\nthe cybercrime ecosystem.\n\nIn the next part, we share more details on the common spreading methods used by traffers, as\nwell as the malware arsenal observed in most teams.\n\n### 911 infection chain\n\nKnown on the Russian-speaking cybercrime forums as “911”, this infection chain consists in\ndelivering the final payload using stolen YouTube accounts to distribute a download link. For\nthis purpose, the traffer or a dedicated member of the traffers team uploads a video on\n\n\n-----\n\nYouTube enticing the user to download an archive, disable Windows Defender and execute its\ncontent. In most observed cases, the uploaded video is a tutorial for installing a cracked\nsoftware, a product licence key generator or even a cheat software for video games. The\ntraffer abuses legitimate file transfer services, such as Mega, Mediafire, OneDrive, Discord or\nGitHub, to store the payload. The downloaded file is often a password-protected archive\nmaking it undetectable, containing an executable file which turns out to be the informationstealing malware.\n\n_Figure 3. Typical 911 Infection chain_\n\nUploading this content on YouTube requires bypassing YouTube’s anti-fraud system. For that\npurpose, the “911” method makes use of proxies to fake the IP address of the YouTube\nchannel owner. Given the amount of stolen data passing through the logs, SEKOIA assess that\ntraffers teams likely use valid YouTube credentials and the associated IP address in follow-up\nactivities.\n\nWhile we observed this delivery method is widely leveraged by traffers, it is used to target\nindividuals rather than companies. Some traffers teams (e.g. Bebra Team) don’t use the “911”\nmethod.\n\nSeveral hypotheses can be made about the choice not to use the 911 infection chain:\n\nSelling logs from stealers distributed via YouTube traffic may not be as profitable as the\ndistribution via other legitimate service or websites, or company emails. Lured users on\nYouTube are more likely to be young people owning small accounts. Related credentials\nand wallets (crypto, Paypal, or others) linked to these accounts are likely of lesser value,\nthey are less likely to raise traffers teams’ primary interest.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, YouTube offers a wide audience and a high volume of traffic. It is\nalmost certain that the 911 infection chain is a choice oriented on the quantity of traffic,\nrather than on the quality.\nSpreading payloads over an open channel, like YouTube, is likely to reduce the lifespan\nof the malware build, or the C2 server. Every step of the 911 is publicly available. It is\ntherefore obvious to quickly burn the malware builds and the information-stealer C2\nservers.\n\nDistributing stealers using the 911 infection chain possibly results in a low infection rate.\nConvincing users to download and install cracked software from an unofficial site after\ndisabling their antivirus would only be effective on less sensibilized targets.\n\n### Other common infection chains\n\nOther common delivery methods include websites masquerading as blogs or software\ninstallation pages to deliver password-protected archives. Some traffers teams display good\nknowledge of Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Reddit Ads, or other advertising platforms to\npromote their websites and reach a larger audience through indexing on search engines. Such\ncampaigns are often put in the spotlight as they affect many victims.\n\nLastly, phishing emails remain one of the most common intrusion vectors used by the traffers.\nAs done earlier by Initial Access Brokers to improve malware delivery performance, traffers\nadapted their infection chain, moving from Office VBA macros, which are now deactivated by\ndefault, to the use of LNK files.\n\n### Malware arsenal of traffers teams\n\nBased on data collected from the traffer section (Трафферы) on Lolz Guru, SEKOIA\nestablished the list of the most used information-stealing malware by traffers teams. For that\npurpose, we collected the publications of new traffers teams entering into the information\nstealer business between January and mid-August 2022. The results are as follows:\n\nRedline 54\n\nMeta 8\n\nRaccoon 6\n\nVidar 5\n\nPrivate Stealer 4\n\nHere is a timeline of the newly created traffers teams since early 2022:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Newly created traffers teams and their associated information stealer, by month in_\n_2022 (Source: Lolz Guru forum, “Traffers” section)_\n\n**Redline**\n\nThe majority of traffers teams SEKOIA observed on forums distribute the Redline information\nstealer, including Bandana Team, Tigers Team, Cosmo Team, Sky Team, White Logs, Hydra\n_Family, Heartless Team. Considered by experienced threat actors as the best stealer on the_\nmarket, Redline offers wide download and execution capabilities, as well as stealing\ncapabilities targeting web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, data from local system, and\nseveral applications (VPN, video games, messenger and others).\n\nIts logs (stolen data) are sold on multiple marketplaces, and custom tools to extract information\nof interest are also developed and sold on underground forums. Redline’s reputation is even\nused as an asset by the team to recruit new traffers.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, the Redline builder, which is the software used to compile a\nnew sample of the malware, easily allows traffers team operators to associate a Redline build\nwith a traffer, making it easier to track stolen data by each of the members. This association is\npossible because a unique botnet name is included in the sample distributed by a traffer. This\nfeature enables SEKOIA to track traffers whose Telegram profile is used for the botnet name,\nand associate malware builds with Telegram profiles.\n\n**Meta**\n\n\n-----\n\nCompared to other stealers mentioned above, Meta Stealer is a newcomer in the Stealer-as-aService world. Launched in March 2022, Meta is advertised as an updated version of Redline,\nwith the same main capabilities. It is now the preferred stealer of a few traffers teams,\nincluding EverMoon Team, Gezzie Team, Lucky Team, TraffProject Team.\n\n**Raccoon**\n\n[Raccoon Stealer 2.0 returns after a few months’ break. As shared in our analysis of this threat,](https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-2-in-depth-analysis/)\nRaccoon targets web browsers, desktop applications and extensions for cryptocurrency wallets\nand data from local systems. It also allows the attacker to download and execute another\npayload.\n\n**Vidar**\n\nAlthough not widely used in traffers teams monitored by SEKOIA, Vidar Stealer is used by\n_Bebra Team, the team with the most active community observed on the Lolz Guru forum._\nSimilarly to the previous three, Vidar collects sensitive information from web browsers,\ncryptocurrency applications and extensions, as well as files from local systems whose\nextension matches those listed in the configuration. The malware also behaves as a loader by\ndownloading and executing payloads.\n\nAlthough the 911 infection chain is not highly advanced, traffers using it target a substantial\n**audience using the YouTube platform, ranked in the top 5 most visited websites worldwide.**\nTraffic generated via this method therefore leads to numerous compromises by the Redline,\n**Meta, Raccoon and Vidar stealers. Victims may be impacted by theft of money, sensitive**\n**data, corporate and private accounts, identity theft, or other cascading consequences.**\n\nLater in the report, SEKOIA shares general guidelines to prevent being infected by an\ninformation stealer, or to mitigate the threat.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTraffers are threat actors playing a key role in the augmentation of the threat surface, and\nmore generally in non-legitimate traffic generation. While the concept of traffers is not new, it is\nlikely their leveraging of information-stealing malware will continue in the short term.\nAdditionally, as this model offers low entry barriers and quick investment return, more traffers\nteams will highly likely emerge in the near future.\n\nTraffers teams dealing with stealers are organised and centrally managed structures in\nwhich resources and services are made available to members by the team administrators. This\nallows traffers to focus on distributing team’s malware builds, using in most cases the 911\n**infection chain, and thus earn money directly from the logs generated from successful**\ncompromises.\n\n\n-----\n\nSEKOIA analysts will continue to monitor the traffers threat and share the latest trends with\nour customers. Additionally, we monitor emerging or well established stealers to produce\nactionable intelligence to our customers, including indicators of compromise for multiple\nfamilies of information-stealing malware.\n\n## How to mitigate the threat?\n\nUnderstanding how information stealers are distributed and how they work is the first step\ntowards protecting a company’s or an individual’s information system from this threat.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to prevent being infected by an information stealer:\n\nLimit software execution to trusted repositories: traffers abuse fake cracked software to\nspread information stealers. Apply a strict software execution policy to prevent users\nfrom downloading malware disguised as fake software installers.\nUse endpoint protection software to automatically quarantine malicious executable files.\nTrain users to be aware of phishing threats and avoid clicking on attached files or links in\ncase of any doubt.\nBlock outbound traffic on non-standard ports.\nHunt or block stealer-related indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nIf prevention was not enough, a successful compromise often leads to the collection and\nexfiltration of sensitive information from the infected host. In this case, our recommendations of\nmitigation are:\n\nIsolate the infected machine and remove the threat.\nPerform anti-malware scan on the infected host to ensure that neither a persistence\nmechanism was established on the infected machine, nor that another payload was\ndropped.\n\nReset passwords and session cookies, block credit cards. If passwords are stored in web\nbrowsers, it is absolutely necessary to renew them, same goes for session cookies. If\ncredit card data is saved into the web browsers, contact the bank to block the affected\ncredit cards.\nTake appropriate measures to limit the consequences of a leak of sensitive documents\nlocated on the infected host.\n\n## Annex\n\n### Annex 1 – Basic concepts used by traffers dealing with stealers\n\nList of some basic concepts routinely used by traffers in their daily activities:\n\n\n-----\n\nBuild ( билд in Russian) – a stealer s sample linked to the traffer s Telegram account, to\ngather all collected logs on its Telegram bot;\nCrypter (“крипт” in Russian) – a software used for encryption of a malicious file for antivirus evasion;\nInstalls (“инсталлы” in Russian) – a method to get logs by inciting the user to download a\nmalicious file. Installs are usually developed within a traffers team and shared amongst\nthe team members;\nLogs parsing (from the Russian “чек логов”) – the process of verifying logs to identify\nand sort logs of interest based on a given query. This can be done manually or\nautomatically, with open source, paid or custom-made software;\nLogs processing (from the Russian “отработка логов”) – the process of analysing logs,\nalso used to refer to log exploitation;\nKnock time (from the Russian “отстук”) – a term used by traffers and team administrators\nto qualify the rapidity with which a log is received by a traffer after a build is distributed.\nThis term is used to stress a malware’s successful execution rate;\n911 – a term used to designate an infection chain consisting of taking over a YouTube\nchannel.\n\n### Annex 2 – Presentation of the Reimann Team’s organisation and evolution\n\nThis case illustrates the evolution of the highly active traffers team Reimann Team and its\ninternal organisation.\n\nReimann Team has been advertised on the Lolz Guru forum since May 2022. Its\nrepresentative on the forum stated that the group was active since at least early 2021 and it is\nalmost certain it still is.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Advertisement aiming at recruiting traffers in Reimann Team (Source: Lolz Guru_\n_forum)_\n\nReimann Team is currently recruiting new traffers and offers their team members the following\nkit of resources:\n\nTelegram bot for log collection\nTelegram bot for log parsing\nA dozen of Telegram chats and groups for technical support\nYouTube Uploader\nSEO services\nAutomated crypts and builds\nA traffer’s manual\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Example of a user interaction with the Reimann Team’s Telegram bot. The number of_\n_logs collected by each of the traffers and by the entire traffers team is displayed, as well as the_\n_revenue generated by every team member at a given time. (Source: Lolz Guru forum)_\n\nReimann Team has two different approaches to pay its members:\n\nTraffers can submit all the collected logs to its team administrator and then be paid by\nnumber of logs;\nTraffers can choose to keep a part of the collected logs to exploit them by themselves;\nTraffers can get 70% of the revenue after the team has exploited its logs.\n\nTo encourage a high level of activity, its administrator organises quests and challenges and\nallocates bonuses.\n\n_Figure 7. A Reidmann Team traffer’s review on the Lolz Guru forum: “I am working now for a_\n_few months, and during this time I already received about 100,000 roubles” (the equivalent of_\n_1,350 euros at the date of publication) (Source: Lolz Guru forum)_\n\nTo monetize received logs, the team representatives are selling them via a marketplace called\n“Reimann Logs”. So they gather the logs obtained by traffers and sell them within 7 days. Logs\nfrom Steam, Minecraft and Roblox are particularly mentioned.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Annex 3 – 911 infection chain example\n\nTo illustrate the 911 infection chain described in the report, here is a campaign distributing the\nRedline information stealer using this method, as performed on 18 August 2022.\n\n**Step 1**\n\nUser searches for a tutorial to download Photoshop for free on YouTube. To reproduce this, we\nentered “photoshop free download” in the search bar.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Results for the search photoshop free download on YouTube as of August 18, 2022_\n\n```\nhxxps://www.youtube[.]com/results?search_query=photoshop+free+download\n\n```\n\nFirst results are very recent as the videos were published a few hours or days earlier. They\nwere all uploaded on stolen YouTube accounts and they all contain a download link and a\npassword in the description.\n\n**Step 2**\n\nThe content of the first video describes how to install the allegedly free Photoshop version\nthrough the following steps:\n\nDownloading the archive;\nDisabling the “Real-time protection” of the Windows for Microsoft Defender Antivirus;\nExtracting files from the password-protected archive using the password “5105”;\nRunning as administrator the executable file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Tutorial to install the allegedly free Photoshop version_\n\n```\nhxxps://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=7A-yeYc63NY\n\n```\n\nThe description of the YouTube video contains a link to a telegra[.]ph webpage and a\npassword.\n\n**Step 3**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe video was uploaded on the stolen YouTube account _DJ STYLE Tv with more than_\n400,000 subscribers. The legitimate owner of the account was still using this account two\nweeks earlier to share music mixes.\n\n_Figure 10. 400k YouTube account on which the tutorial was uploaded_\n\n```\nhxxps://www.youtube[.]com/channel/UCSdTq3mF_zRDyJCR1jxAANw\n\n```\n\n**Step 4**\n\nThe user is redirected on a telegra[.]ph web page after clicking the link in the description. The\nwebpage contains a MediaFire link and again the password “5105”.\n\n_Figure 11. Telegra[.]ph webpage mentioned in the YouTube video description_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nhxxps://telegra[.]ph/Photoshop 08 17 3\n\n```\n\n**Step 5**\n\nThe user is now redirected to the MediaFire website, on a download page of a RAR archive\nnamed “photoshop.rar”.\n\n_Figure 12.
