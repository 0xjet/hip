2022\n\nImage: Steve Johnson\nThe operators of the TrickBot malware botnet have shut down their server infrastructure\ntoday after months of inactivity, bringing to an end one of the most dangerous and persistent\nmalware operations seen in recent years.\n\nPrior to today’s voluntary shutdown, the TrickBot gang hadn’t set up new servers or tried to\n[carry out email spam campaigns since mid-December 2021.](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/trickbot/)\n\nBut today’s shutdown comes as no surprise, Vitali Kremez, CEO of security firm AdvIntel,\ntold The Record in a phone call earlier today.\n\nIt comes after the group’s malware has become “highly detectable” by security products,\nwhich appears to have damaged the group’s ability to infect and then sell access to Windows\n[systems to its criminal clientele, security firms AdvIntel and](https://www.advintel.io/post/the-trickbot-saga-s-finale-has-aired-but-a-spinoff-is-already-in-the-works) [Intel471 wrote in separate](https://intel471.com/blog/trickbot-2022-emotet-bazar-loader)\nreports analyzing the malware’s recent slump.\n\n“Trickbot, after all, is relatively old malware that hasn’t been updated in a major way.\nDetection rates are high, and the network traffic from bot communication is easily\nrecognized,” Intel471 said earlier today before Kremez confirmed that TrickBot had decided\nto call it quits.\n\n\n-----\n\nTrickBot is gone…It is official now as of Thursday, February 24, 2022\nSee you soon … or not 😉 [pic.twitter.com/zWCCpngUI7](https://t.co/zWCCpngUI7)\n\n[— Vitali Kremez (@VK_Intel) February 24, 2022](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1496944228135493638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nKremez also cited recent recruitment from the Conti ransomware gang as a primary factor in\nTrickBot’s recent demise.\n\nAfter [resurrecting and integrating the Emotet botnet into its “cybercrime cartel” towards the](https://www.advintel.io/post/corporate-loader-emotet-history-of-x-project-return-for-ransomware)\nend of 2021, Kremez said that the Conti gang has now also recruited several top members of\nthe TrickBot gang as well.\n\nUnder its new leadership, the old TrickBot malware codebase and infrastructure appears to\nhave been abandoned, and Kremez said that the Conti gang is working with the former\nTrickBot devs to further develop and deploy BazaarBackdoor, one of TrickBot’s former\nmodules, as a replacement for TrickBot itself.\n\n## TrickBot goes out on its own terms\n\nThe TrickBot gang fading its old malware and morphing into a new operation cames after\nboth [US authorities

command and](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-other-tech-companies-orchestrate-takedown-of-trickbot-botnet/)\ncontrol server infrastructure in October 2020.\n\n[Despite losing roughly 94% of its servers, the botnet survived and returned with new servers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/trickbot-botnet-survives-takedown-attempt-but-microsoft-sets-new-legal-precedent/)\ndays later and with new attacks after a few weeks.\n\nBut the failed takedown attempt didn’t dissuade US authorities and they responded in 2021\n[by charging and detaining two of TrickBot’s programmers, Alla Witte and](https://therecord.media/us-arrests-latvian-woman-who-worked-on-trickbot-malware-source-code/) [Vladimir Dunaev.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-extradited-united-states-face-charges-alleged-role-cybercriminal)\n\nHowever, the arrests didn’t touch the group’s leadership, which remained intact, and\ncontinued to operate the botnet throughout 2021 before entering their recent Conti\ncollaboration and moving on to a new malware codebase.\n\nIn December 2021, just days before TrickBot ceased operations, Check Point reported\n[seeing the malware on more than 140,000 systems throughout the year (2021).](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/when-old-friends-meet-again-why-emotet-chose-trickbot-for-rebirth/)\n\nIn a [Wired feature on TrickBot, security firm Hold Security said saw the TrickBot gang](https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/)\ninvested more than $20 million in its infrastructure last year, which shows the scale of its\noperation, which dwarfs many legitimate software firms today.\n\nTags\n\n[AdvIntel](https://therecord.media/tag/advintel/)\n[BazaarBackdoor](https://therecord.media/tag/bazaarbackdoor/)\n[botnet](https://therecord.media/tag/botnet/)\n[Conti](https://therecord.media/tag/conti/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Intel471](https://therecord.media/tag/intel471/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[Trickbot](https://therecord.media/tag/trickbot/)\n\nCatalin
