    "plain_text": "# ESET unmasks ‘GREYENERGY’ cyber-espionage group\n\n**eset.com/int/greyenergy-exposed/**\n\n## Sophisticated threat actor, linked to previous ‘BlackEnergy’ cyberattacks, targets high-value organizations\n\n GreyEnergy finally exposed\n\n[ESET researchers just unmasked the shadowy cyber-espionage group dubbed](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/17/greyenergy-updated-arsenal-dangerous-threat-actors/)\nGreyEnergy. It’s the successor to the BlackEnergy APT group which went ‘underground‘ a\nfew years ago after terrorizing Ukraine until 2015. It’s also closely related to TeleBots,\nresponsible for NotPetya, perhaps the most damaging cyberattack experienced.\n\nOur researchers have demonstrated beyond doubt that GreyEnergy’s malware toolkit both\n**mirrors and improves on already-sophisticated techniques used in the devastating**\nNotPetya attacks and Ukraine power grid outages.\n\nESET’s exposure of GreyEnergy is important for a successful defense against this\nparticular threat actor as well as for better understanding the tactics, tools and\nprocedures of the most advanced APT groups.\n\nAnton Cherepanov, ESET Senior Malware Researcher\n\n\n-----\n\n## Links between BlackEnergy, Industroyer and GreyEnergy\n\n Organizations at risk\n\nThe consequences for organizations of all sizes can be devastating. Compared to\nBlackEnergy, GreyEnergy is a more modern toolkit with an even greater focus on stealth.\nESET researchers have demonstrated that GreyEnergy has the capacity to take full\n**control of entire company networks.**\n\nOne basic stealth technique is to push only selected modules to selected targets, and only\nwhen needed. In addition, some GreyEnergy modules are partially encrypted and some\nremain fileless – running only in memory – with the intention of hindering analysis and\ndetection.\n\nTo cover their tracks, typically, GreyEnergy’s operators securely wipe the malware\ncomponents from the victims’ hard drives.\n\nThe modules described in ESET’s analysis were used for espionage and reconnaissance\npurposes and include: backdoor, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password\nand credential stealing.\n\n## How ESET protects you\n\nThe good news is ESET can fully protect your organization. Our multilayered\ntechnologycombining machine learning, human expertise and global threat intelligence,\n**combats exactly this type of new, previously unseen threat.**\n\n**ESET Enterprise Inspector**\n\nIs the most flexible and custom-fit EDR solution on the market. It enables granular visibility\nand identification of anomalous behavior and breaches, risk assessment, incident response,\ninvestigation and effective remediation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ESET Dynamic Threat Defense**\n\nIs a cloud-based sandboxing solution. It evaluates behavior of all submitted samples with\nthreat intelligence feeds, ESET’s multiple internal tools for static and dynamic analysis and\nreputation data to detect zero-day threats.\n\n**ESET Mail Security**\n\nESET Mail Security award-winning solutions provide powerful server malware protection,\nspam filtering, anti-phishing and thorough email scanning against all email-borne threats. It\nis compatible with all major email platforms.\n\n[Stay safe with ESET](https://www.eset.com/int/business/enterprise/)\nStay safe with ESET\n\n**ESET fully protects your organization from GreyEnergy**\n\n[Stay safe with ESET](https://www.eset.com/int/business/enterprise/)\n\n\n-----",
