Today, we are releasing the **[full whitepaper on the Potao malware with additional findings, the cyberespionage campaigns where it](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Operation-Potao-Express_final_v2.pdf)**\nwas employed, and its connection to a backdoor in the form of a modified version of the TrueCrypt encryption software.\n\nLike **[BlackEnergy, the malware used by the so-called Sandworm APT group (also known as Quedagh), Potao is an example of targeted](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/14/cve-2014-4114-details-august-blackenergy-powerpoint-campaigns/)**\nespionage malware directed mostly at targets in Ukraine and a number of other post-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and Belarus.\n\n|Type your keyword...

The attackers are,\nhowever, still very active, with the most recent infiltration attempts detected by ESET in July 2015.\n\nThe timeline below lists a selection of Potao attack campaigns and other related events.\n\n\nFigure 2 – Timeline of selected Patao campaigns\n\n\nAmong the victims identified, the most notable high-value targets include Ukrainian government and military entities and one of the major\nUkrainian news agencies. The malware was also used to spy on members of **[MMM, a Ponzi scheme popular in Russia and Ukraine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMM_%28Ponzi_scheme_company%29)**\n\n**Malware Techniques**\n\nWhen the criminals shifted their focus from attacking targets in Russia to others in Ukraine, they began sending personalized SMS messages to\ntheir potential victims to lure them to landing pages hosting the malware, disguised as postal tracking sites.\n\nWe haven’t noticed Win32/Potao employing any exploits and the malware isn’t particularly technically advanced. (Shouldn’t call it an APT then,\nright?) Yet it does contain a few other interesting techniques that ‘get the job done’, like the mechanism for spreading via USB drives and\ndisguising executables as Word and Excel documents, as in the following examples:\n\n\nFigure 3 – Potao droppers with MS Word icons and file names used in attacks against high-value Ukrainian targets to capture the\n\ninterest of recipients\n\n\n**Trojanized TrueCrypt**\n\nAn (A)PT malware family that has gone relatively unnoticed for five years and that has also been used to spy on Ukrainian governmental and\nmilitary targets is certainly interesting in and of itself. However, perhaps the most attention-grabbing discovery related to this case was when we\nobserved a connection to the popular open-source encryption software, TrueCrypt.\n\nWe found out that the website truecryptrussia.ru has been serving modified versions of the encryption software that included a backdoor to\nselected targets. Clean versions of the application are served to normal visitors to the website, i.e. people who aren’t of interest to the attackers.\nESET detects the trojanized TrueCrypt as **[Win32/FakeTC. TrueCrypt Russia’s domain was also used as a C&C server for the malware.](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_FakeTC/detail)**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – TrueCrypt Russia’s Website\n\n\nThe connection to Win32/Potao, which is a different malware family from Win32/FakeTC, is that FakeTC has been used to deliver Potao to victims’\nsystems in a number of cases.\n\nFakeTC is not, however, merely an infection vector for Potao (and possibly other malware) but a fully functional and dangerous backdoor designed\nto exfiltrate files from the espionage victims’ encrypted drives.\n\n\nFigure 5 – Interface of the trojanized Russian TrueCrypt\n\n\nIn addition to the selective targeting (deciding to whom to serve the trojanized version instead of the clean one), the backdoor code also contained\ntriggers that would only activate the malicious data-stealing functionality for active, long-term TrueCrypt users. These were surely contributing\nfactors to the malware’s going unnoticed for such a long time.\n\nFurther details on both Win32/Potao and Win32/FakeTC, including a technical analysis of the malware, description of plugins, infection vectors,\nC&C communication protocol and other spreading campaigns not mentioned in this blog post are included in our comprehensive whitepaper.\n\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOC) that can be used to identify an infection can be found in the whitepaper or on github:\n## Follow ushttps://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/potao\n\n\n-----\n\nThe latest security news direct to your inbox\n\nEmail...\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n-----",
