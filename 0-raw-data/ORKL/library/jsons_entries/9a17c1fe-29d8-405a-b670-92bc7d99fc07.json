This rapid iteration of fixes has left software developers and\norganizations worldwide scrambling to assess and mitigate their exposure with nearly dailychanging guidance. In the meantime, we’ve seen attempts to detect or exploit the\nvulnerability continue non-stop.\n\nAs we pass the first week since the exposure of the first vulnerability, SophosLabs has\ncontinued to track attempts against our customers’ networks to exploit Log4Shell. The traffic\nwe’ve observed includes benign scans by security researchers and penetration testers as\nwell as malicious activity, and it does not directly reflect the state of criminal and state actor\nattempts to exploit the vulnerability. But from portions of the data, we can see enough about\nthe requests to gain some insight into the infrastructure involved in these attempts, and in\nsome cases the intent behind them.\n\nWhat is certain is that we have not seen a significant reduction in exploit attempts since they\npeaked on December 15, and that these probes and exploits are coming from a globally\ndistributed infrastructure. In some cases, a request comes from an IP address in one\n\n\n-----\n\ngeographic region, with embedded URLs for Log4j that connect to servers elsewhere—\nsometimes multiple different servers. We have seen millions of incoming attempts to exploit\nLog4j in customer telemetry.\n\n## Who’s doing this?\n\nWhile we cannot distinguish the intent of every request, the segment of our telemetry that\nprovided traffic details provides a snapshot of the infrastructure involved in Log4j abuse.\nLooking at the source of attempted abusive packets thus far, the vast majority come from IP\naddresses in Russia and China. This does not include traffic that conceals its source by use\nof virtual private networks; a statistically significant amount of traffic was routed through\nNordVPN’s exit point in Panama, for example.\n\nOf the traffic we could identify a source for, 11% came from a single IP address in\nRussia: 195[.]54[.]160[.]149. This IP address has been associated with the Kinsing\ncryptocoin-mining botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause of the way Log4j exploits work—by prompting “lookups” to remote servers via\nLDAP, DNS, and other Java Name and Directory Interface (JNDI) supported protocols—the\nlookup requests can be directed to a different location than the source of the exploit. For\nexample, a request routed through NordVPN’s Panama exit point (94[.]140[.]9[.]194) used a\nrequest URL that redirected to a URL in Kenya (41[.]169[.]130[.]19:8443/api/login).\n\nNearly two-thirds of these requests had URLs for infrastructure in India. And over 40% had\nURLs directed to infrastructure in the US. Over seven percent of exploit requests were\n[directed to the Interactsh tool’s domain—18% of all the traffic to US infrastructure. The](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh)\nnumbers in the chart below add up to more than 100% because some exploit attempts used\nmultiple URLs with different destinations.\n\nNote: Percentages add up to more than 100%, as multiple URLs are included in some exploit\nattempts.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause Interactsh has been used by both researchers and malicious actors, it s difficult to\nseparate the benign from the bad—just as it is with much of the other traffic we’re currently\ndetecting and blocking. But it is clear that malicious exploit attempts remain a majority of this\ntraffic.\n\n## Mitigation and protection\n\nWhen the first patch for Log4j was released, the Apache team offered a number of workarounds to prevent exploitation. But all of these fixes turned out to be moot as additional\nvulnerability paths were discovered. The only sure way to protect against exploitation—either\nto gain remote code execution or to cause denial of service—is to update software to use the\ncurrent “safe” versions of Log4j (2.17.0 for Java 8, 2.12.3 for Java 7). A list of vulnerable\ncommercial products is being maintained by multiple government computer security\nagencies, including the US’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration\n(CISA). Organizations should assess their software’s vulnerability as soon as possible and\ndeploy updates where possible.\n\nWhere fixes are not yet available, network filtering definitions will protect against a large\npercentage of existing exploit traffic—but do not guarantee protection against emerging\nthreats and highly targeted attacks.\n\nSophos continues to identify new methods of obfuscation for exploiting traffic, and new\npayloads that are being deployed via Log4j exploits.
