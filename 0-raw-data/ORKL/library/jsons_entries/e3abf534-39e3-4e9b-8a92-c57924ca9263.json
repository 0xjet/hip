Just a few months after the wellpublicized indictment of three high-ranking members in August, Morphisec has identified a\nnew FIN7 campaign that appears to be targeting the restaurant industry.\n\n[FIN7, also known as Carbanak, is one of the major threat groups tracked by Morphisec and](https://blog.morphisec.com/fileless-attack-framework-discovery)\nnumerous other security entities, and among the top three criminal computer intrusion cases\nthat the FBI is currently working. FIN7 is composed of a very sophisticated network of\n[developers and hackers and brings in an estimated $50 million a month. They target very](https://www.wired.com/story/fin7-carbanak-hacking-group-behind-a-string-of-big-breaches/)\nspecific industries, hospitality – hotels and restaurants – being one of them, and are behind a\nstring of high-profile breaches including Red Robin, Chili’s, Arby’s, Burgerville, Omni Hotels\nand Saks Fifth Avenue, among many others.\n\nFIN7 is known for its stealth techniques and ability to continuously evade security systems.\nIn the case of Burgerville, malware sat on the company’s network collecting payment data for\nnearly a year before it was discovered. And that was only due to an FBI investigation.\n\nIn this blog post, we present our findings on two campaigns, which occurred in the first and\nsecond weeks of November. These campaigns follow patterns similar to those presented by\n[FireEye in August but with just enough variations to bypass many security vendors.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/fin7-pursuing-an-enigmatic-and-evasive-global-criminal-operation.html)\n\n## Technical Description\n\nThe initial document was probably sent within the Baltic region (or tested there). It was\nsubmitted to VirusTotal from Latvia. The name of the document translated from Russian is\n_“new questioner”. It is password-protected with the password: “goodmorning”._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Oprosnik_new.doc_\n_6e1230088a34678726102353c622445e1f8b8b8c9ce1f025d11bfffd5017ca82)_\n\nIt uses social engineering to convince the recipient to enable macros through the use of the\nimages, logo and tagline of a newly launched, legitimate VPN tool InvinciBull by\ncybersecurity company Finjan.\n\nIf the “enable macro” button is activated, the following obfuscated Macro runs and the next\nstage obfuscated JavaScript is extracted from the form caption, similar to the last several\nFIN7 campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamining the metadata of the document, it clearly shows that the document was created on\nthe 11.02.2018:\n\nFollowing deobfuscation of the macro, we notice known FIN7 patterns of executing\nJavaScript from VBScript with the slight modification of copying the wscript.exe file and\nrenaming it to mses.exe. This may allow it to bypass some EDR solutions that are tracing\nWScript by name.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the obfuscated JavaScript that is written to the temp directory as error.txt file. The\nobfuscation pattern is similar to previously seen FIN7 patterns and most probably is a\nderivation of the same obfuscation toolkit.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Deobfuscated JavaScript\n\nThe deobfuscated JavaScript is actually a backdoor component that directly communicates\nto the C2 server (in this case hxxps://bing-cdn[.]com). It executes the response which is yet\nanother JavaScript command, which can be evaluated by eval. Although there have been\nslight modifications in the Macro delivery in the last couple of campaigns, the JavaScript\nbackdoor stays the same, including its communication protocol.\n\nDuring the first request, the MAC address and the computer domain are also delivered to the\ntarget C2. We believe that the next stage is only delivered to specific targets based on\ndomains as the data that is delivered in the first request is very limited.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Yara Rules\n\nSome additional observations that can be used to create Yara-rules for this campaign are the\nlocations of the loaded VBControl files that are written in clear text as part of the document\nfiles:\n\n### Additional Samples\n\nAfter this search, we identified more samples that were created just a couple of days ago\nand point to a known C2 registered to the same entity (hxxps://googleapi-cdn[.]com)\n\nBelow is a summary of information for one of those documents:\n\nThe document was submitted from Ukraine (yet another former soviet union country) with the\nname “dinners.doc”\n(f5f8ab9863dc12d04731b1932fc3609742de68252c706952f31894fc21746bb8).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document again uses the social engineering technique of spoofing a known and trusted\nentity to convince the victim to enable macros.\n\nBased on the submission date and creation time, the document is sent to the target within 23 days.\n\nThe macro is nearly identical to that described above except that wscript->script, errors>settings, has multiple captions instead of a single one.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe JavaScript backdoor is decrypted into a similar backdoor:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLike the Hydra, cutting off one, or even three, heads of FIN7 barely slows it down. With the\nholiday rush nearly upon us, we expect the threat group to step up its activities to take\nadvantage of increased email traffic flow and seasonal staff that may be less security\nconscious. Workers in any industry should stay vigilant against social engineering methods –\nalthough with today’s highly targeted campaigns this can sometimes be tough to spot. And\nnever enable macros unless you are 100 percent certain that the file is safe.\n\n[Contact SalesInquire via Azure](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:sales@morphisec.com)\n\n\n-----",
