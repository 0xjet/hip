We discovered these domains by monitoring suspicious traffic in our Zscaler cloud. The spoofed sites were\ncreated to distribute malicious ISO files which lead to a Vidar infostealer infection on the endpoint. These variants of Vidar malware fetch the\nC2 configuration from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and Mastodon network.\n\nThreatLabz believes that the same threat actor is actively leveraging social engineering to impersonate popular legitimate software applications\nto distribute Vidar malware, as we have also identified an attacker-controlled GitHub repository which hosts several backdoored versions of\nAdobe Photoshop. These binaries hosted on GitHub, distribute Vidar malware using similar tactics of abusing social media channels for\nC2 communication.\n\nIn this blog, ThreatLabz analyzes the Vidar distribution vector, threat actor correlation, and technical analysis of the binaries involved in this\ncampaign.\n\n## Key points\n\nThreatLabz discovered several newly registered domains spoofing the official Microsoft Windows 11 OS download portal\nThe spoofed domains were distributing malicious ISO files containing samples of the Vidar infostealer malware\nThe actual C2s used by the malware samples are obtained from attacker-controlled social media channels hosted on Telegram and\nMastodon network\nUsing data obtained from this campaign, ThreatLabz was also able to identify another similar one using backdoored versions of Adobe\nPhotoshop\n\n## Distribution Vector - Windows 11 Theme\n\nThe threat actor registered several domains beginning 20th April 2022 that host web pages that masquerade as the official Microsoft Windows\n11 download page, which is the latest version of the operating system. ThreatLabz found several other domains registered by this threat actor\nsimilar to the one shown below in Figure 1. All of these domains were used to spread malicious ISO files spoofed as a Windows 11 download.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Vidar attacker-controlled domain serving malicious ISO file_\n\nThe complete list of domains linked to this threat actor that were used in this campaign are mentioned in the Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\nsection.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### ISO file\n\nThe binary inside the ISO file is a PE32 binary. The size of the ISO file is very large (more than 300 MB), which helps the attackers evade\nnetwork security products where there is a file size limitation in place. Example MD5 hashes for this campaign are shown below:\n\nISO file MD5 hash: 52c47fdda399b011b163812c46ea94a6\n\nPE32 file MD5 hash: 6352540cf679dfec21aff6bd9dee3770\n\nThe binary inside the ISO file is digitally signed with a certificate by AVAST. However, this certificate is expired and hence invalid.\n\nFigure 2 shows the details of the certificate and the corresponding serial number.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Details of the certificate used to sign the malicious Vidar binary_\n\nAll of the binaries in this campaign were signed by a certificate with the same serial number. By pivoting on this serial number, we were able to\ndiscover several other malicious binaries from multiple different campaigns and actors, which likely indicates that this is a stolen certificate\ncoming from the AVAST compromise back in 2019.\n\n### Vidar Samples\n\nThe Vidar samples in these campaigns are all packed with Themida (except for the MD5 hash 6ae17cb76cdf097d4dc4fcccfb5abd8a) and over\n330MB in size. However, the sample contains a PE file that is only around 3.3MB. Figure 3 shows that the rest of the file content is just\nartificially filled up with 0x10 bytes to increase the file’s size. The Vidar strings extracted from these samples is provided in the Appendix\nsection at the end of the blog.\n\n_Figure 3: Padding of bytes to inflate the Vidar binary size from 3.3MB to 330MB_\n\nAll of the binaries below are related to the same Windows 11 theme campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5: 6352540cf679dfec21aff6bd9dee3770**\n\nThe Vidar static configuration below contains the embedded parameters needed by the sample to communicate with its C2 and information\nincluding the malware version:\n\n**Profile: 670**\n**Profile ID: 739**\n**Version: 51.9**\n**URL marker: hello**\n**URL1: https://t.me/btc20220425**\n**Real C2: 195.201.250.209 (Carved out from URL1)**\n**URL2: https://ieji.de/@ronxik213**\n**Real C2: 107.189.11.124 (Carved out from URL2)**\n\nThe botnet can be identified by its profile ID. Both of the hardcoded URLs are from social media sites. However, they are used as a dead drop\nresolver as a first stage. The URL marker instructs Vidar to parse the second stage URL from the social media profiles located at the dead drop\nresolver.\n\nThe following is an example Vidar stealer configuration downloaded from the C2:\n1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,250,Default;%DESKTOP%\\;*.txt:*.dat:*wallet*.*:*2fa*.*:*backup*.*:*code*.*:*password*.*:*auth*.*:*google*.*:*utc*.*:*UTC*.*:*c\n\nThis configuration is the default with every stealing function enabled (passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, two-factor authentication, etc)\n\nThe following libraries are downloaded from the C2:\n\nupdate.zip (66cf4ebdceedecd9214caab7ca87908d), which contains the following DLL libraries:\nfreebl3.dll (ef2834ac4ee7d6724f255beaf527e635)\nmozglue.dll (8f73c08a9660691143661bf7332c3c27)\nmsvcp140.dll (109f0f02fd37c84bfc7508d4227d7ed5)\nnss3.dll (bfac4e3c5908856ba17d41edcd455a51)\nsoftokn3.dll (a2ee53de9167bf0d6c019303b7ca84e5)\nsqlite3.dll (e477a96c8f2b18d6b5c27bde49c990bf)\nvcruntime140.dll (7587bf9cb4147022cd5681b015183046)\n\nAll of these libraries are legitimate that Vidar leverages in order to extract credentials and other data from different applications and browsers.\n\n**MD5: da82d43043c101f25633c258f527c9d5**\n**MD5: e9a3562f3851dd2dba27f90b5b2d15c0**\n\nVidar static configuration:\n\n**Profile: 1281**\n**Profile ID: 755**\n**Version: 51.9**\n**URL marker: hello**\n**URL1: 5.252.178.50**\n**URL2: https://koyu.space/@ronxik123**\n**Real C2: 107.189.11.124 (Carved out from URL2)**\n\nFor these samples, the URL1 field in the static configuration is a real C2, and a social media profile is used as a backup URL.\n\nThe Vidar stealer configuration downloaded from this C2 was the following:\n1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,250,none;\n\nThis configuration is customized to extract social media passwords with all of the other Vidar features disabled.\n\nThe libraries downloaded from the C2 are the same as the previous sample with the same update.zip (66cf4ebdceedecd9214caab7ca87908d).\n\n## Distribution Vector - Adobe Photoshop Theme\n\nThreatLabz also identified an attacker-controlled GitHub repository which hosts backdoored versions of the application Adobe Photoshop\nCreative Cloud, which we attribute to the same threat actor. Figure 4 shows the GitHub repository (https://github.com/AdobeInstal) used by\nthe attacker to host a backdoored version of Adobe Photoshop.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Vidar attacker-controlled GitHub repository_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe sample with the MD5 hash below belongs to this Adobe Photoshop theme campaign.\n\n**MD5 6ae17cb76cdf097d4dc4fcccfb5abd8a**\n\nVidar static configuration:\n\n**Profile: 1199**\n**Profile ID: 0**\n**Version: 51.8**\n**URL marker: hello**\n**URL1: https://t.me/mm20220428**\n**Real C2: 195.201.250.209 (Carved out from URL1)**\n**URL2: https://koyu.space/@ronxik123**\n**Real C2: 107.189.11.124 (Carved out from URL2)**\n\nThe Vidar stealer configuration downloaded from the C2 was the following:\n1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,250,Default;%DESKTOP%\\;*.txt:*.dat:*wallet*.*:*2fa*.*:*backup*.*:*code*.*:*password*.*:*auth*.*:*google*.*:*utc*.*:*UTC*.*:*c\n\nThe libraries downloaded from the C2 are the same as the previous sample with the same update.zip (66cf4ebdceedecd9214caab7ca87908d).\n\n## Social media abuse for C2 communication\n\nAll the binaries involved in this campaign fetch the IP addresses of the C2 servers from attacker-registered social media accounts on the\nTelegram and Mastodon networks. In the past, the threat actors distributing Vidar have abused other social media networks such as Mastodon.\nHowever, the abuse of Telegram is a new tactic that they added to their arsenal.\n\n## Telegram abuse\n\nIn these campaigns, the threat actor created several Telegram channels with the C2 IP address in the channel description. The format used to\nstore the C2 IP address on social media profiles is the following for this campaign:\n\n<C2_Url_Marker> <C2_IP_address>|\n\nThe C2_Url_Marker field in these campaigns was hello. The naming convention for the Telegram channels includes a date that corresponds to\nthe date when these channels were created. As an example, the channel with the handle btc20220425 corresponds to a channel created on\nApril 25, 2022, using btc_stacking as the name as shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Vidar attacker-controlled Telegram channel with the C2 IP address included in the channel description_\n\n## Mastodon network abuse\n\nThe Mastodon network is a decentralized social network which allows anyone to deploy their own instance of a self-hosted online community.\nThere are several instances of such online communities on the Internet, which are built using Mastodon. Two such instances are ieji[.]de and\nkoyu[.]space. The threat actor created a profile on both of these communities and stored the C2 IP address in the profile section using a format\nsimilar to the one used for Telegram channels. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the profiles created by the threat actor on ieji[.]de and koyu[.]space,\nrespectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n_igu e 6: Vida attacke_ _cont olled p ofile on the_ _astodon community ieji[.]de with the C_ _add ess included in the channel desc iption_\n\n_Figure 7: Vidar attacker-controlled profile on Mastodon community koyu[.]space with the C2 IP address included in the channel description_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe threat actors distributing Vidar malware have demonstrated their ability to social engineer victims into installing Vidar stealer using\nthemes related to the latest popular software applications. As always, users should be cautious when downloading software applications from\nthe Internet and download software only from the official vendor websites. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor this\ncampaign, as well as others, to help keep our customers safe.\n\n## Zscaler cloud sandbox detection\n\n\n-----\n\n_igu e 8:_ _scale cloud
