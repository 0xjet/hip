Secureworks® incident response (IR)\nengagements in the first quarter of 2021 provided Secureworks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU)\nresearchers with unique insight into the group’s use of distinctive tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe financially motivated threat group operating the Hades ransomware is known as GOLD\n[WINTER. Some third-party reporting attributes Hades to the HAFNIUM threat group, but](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\nCTU™ research does not support that attribution. Other reporting attributes Hades to the\n[financially motivated GOLD DRAKE threat group based on similarities to that group’s](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-drake)\nWastedLocker ransomware. Despite use of similar application programming interface (API)\ncalls, the CryptOne crypter, and some of the same commands, CTU researchers attribute\nHades and WastedLocker to two distinct groups as of this publication.\n\nRansomware groups are typically opportunistic: they target any organization that could be\nsusceptible to extortion and will likely pay the ransom. However, GOLD WINTER’s attacks on\nlarge North America-based manufacturers indicates that the group is a “big game hunter”\nthat specifically seeks high-value targets.\n\n## Unique TTPs\n\nAnalysis of these IR engagements revealed TTPs not associated with other ransomware\nfamilies. Some of the tactics and tools may be similar to those used by other threat groups,\nbut GOLD WINTER added some unusual aspects.\n\n### ‘Tox’-ic conversations\n\nHades’ absence on underground forums and marketplaces suggests that it is operated as\nprivate ransomware rather than ransomware as a service (RaaS). GOLD WINTER “names\nand shames” victims after stealing their data but does not use a centralized leak site to\nexpose the exfiltrated data. Instead, Tor-based Hades websites appear to be customized for\n[each victim (see Figure 1). Each website includes a victim-specific Tox chat ID for](https://tox.chat/)\ncommunications (see Figure 1). Using Tox instant messaging for communications is a novel\ntechnique that CTU researchers have not observed with other ransomware families.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Hades ransomware victim site. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\n\nGOLD WINTER has a propensity for copying ransom notes from other high-profile\nransomware families. The Hades ransom note samples observed by CTU researchers\nduplicated REvil or Conti ransom notes. The REvil look-alike ransom note (HOW-TODECRYPT-<victim ID>.txt) featured a unique victim identifier that was hard-coded in the\nransomware executable (see Figure 2). This ransom note referred each victim to a\npersonalized Tor victim site, whose URL is hard-coded in the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. REvil look-alike ransom note used by GOLD WINTER. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn early April, CTU researchers observed the threat actors dropping a Conti look-alike\nransom note (CONTACT-TO-DECRYPT.txt). It included contact email addresses instead of a\nwebsite, indicating a potential change in TTPs. GOLD WINTER may use look-alike ransom\nnotes to confuse researchers or perhaps to pay homage to admired ransomware families.\n\n### Name game\n\nCTU researchers also observed the threat actors shifting from using a randomly generated\nfive-character string for the victim ID and encrypted file extension to using words. A March IR\n[engagement revealed use of a single word: “cypherpunk”. Based on the definition of this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk)\nterm, perhaps the threat actors view their ransomware activity as a way to prompt\norganizations to improve their security.\n\n### Two IAVs are better than one\n\nCTU researchers identified two distinct initial access vectors (IAVs) across the analyzed\nenvironments. In some intrusions, the threat actors used stolen or guessed credentials to log\nin via a virtual private network (VPN) that did not implement multi-factor authentication. The\nsecond IAV was SocGholish malware delivered via fake browser updates. SocGholish is\ncommonly associated with the GOLD DRAKE threat group.\n\n### Threat actor toolbox\n\n[GOLD WINTER’s tools include Cobalt Strike Malleable C2,](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2) [Mimikatz,](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki) Advanced Port\nScanner, [PsExec,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) [Metasploit, and](https://www.metasploit.com/) [MSBuild. Most of these tools are commonly observed in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild?view=vs-2019)\ncompromised environments. But in one uncommon implementation used in a Hades\nintrusion, MSBuild executed a file containing a Metasploit payload (see Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. MSBuild used to execute malicious file. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers also observed two scripts that repeatedly stopped services (see Figure 4)\nand cleared event logs (see Figure 5). Both scripts featured a distinctive 60-second ‘sleep’\nloop.\n\n_Figure 4. Batch script to stop services. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n_Figure 5. Batch script to clear event logs. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe threat actors disguised the Cobalt Strike executable as a Corel Draw graphics\napplication (see Figure 6) to obfuscate the true nature of the file. While spoofing legitimate\napplications is not unusual, the use of Corel Draw is unique.\n\n_Figure 6. EXIF data associated with Cobalt Strike disguised as Corel Draw. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nGOLD WINTER has used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and reverse SOCKS proxies\n[(see Figure 7) to maintain access to victims’ environments. The MEGAsync cloud storage](https://mega.io/)\nplatform was used for data exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Reverse SOCKS proxy invocation. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Ransomware analysis\n\nSome Hades samples analyzed by CTU researchers use the “ClassicStartMenu.exe”\nfilename and have December 2020 creation dates, which coincides with the first reports of\nthe ransomware. The Hades ransomware executable copies itself into a random\n%AppData% folder and then executes via the “/go” argument. It checks the compromised\nenvironment for virtualization and debugging tools. Like many other ransomware families,\nHades deletes volume shadow copies using the “vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet”\ncommand. It also uses a distinctive self-delete command with an unusual inclusion of a\nwaitfor command: cmd /c waitfor /t 10 pause /d y & del \"<ransomware file path>\" & rd \"\n<ransomware folder>\".\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nCTU researchers observed commonalities across IP addresses and domains used by GOLD\nWINTER. The threat actors leveraged IP provider Selectel (see Figure 8), and the IP\n[addresses fall under AS49505.](https://db-ip.com/as49505-ooo-network-of-data-centers-selectel)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. IP addresses used by GOLD WINTER. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe domains associated with GOLD WINTER infrastructure were issued by Russian registrar\nREG.RU (see Figure 9). Most of these domains were created in June 2020; the exception is\nbingoshow . xyz, which was registered in January 2021. Registration data for this domain\nshows the state as Indiana but a country code for Finland and a New Jersey phone number,\nlikely indicating that the threat actors deliberately provided misinformation. All the identified\ndomains have links to the identified Selectel IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Domains used by GOLD WINTER. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCTU researchers track threats and behaviors identified during IR engagements to\nunderstand the nature and evolution of various threats. Through countermeasure\ndevelopment, periodic trend analysis, and ad-hoc tactical reporting on activity observed\nduring these engagements, CTU researchers continuously provide protection, insight, and\nguidance derived from real-world incidents to Secureworks customers. In many ways, the\nGOLD WINTER threat group is a typical post-intrusion ransomware threat group that\npursues high-value targets to maximize how much money it can extort from its victims.\nHowever, GOLD WINTER’s operations have quirks that distinguish it from other groups.\n\nIt is crucial for organizations to diligently respond to early signs of threat actor activity before\nencryption occurs. Staying one step ahead of the threat actors is increasingly difficult as they\nevolve their TTPs. Organizations do not have the luxury of time when it comes to\ninvestigating pre-infection activity.\n\n[Learn more about Secureworks proactive and reactive IR services, including process](https://www.secureworks.com/services/incident-response)\nevaluations, training exercises, emergency response, and IR retainers.\n\n## Threat Indicators\n\n\n-----\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this threat, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and possibly restrict access using the indicators in Table 1.
