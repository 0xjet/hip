These countries certainly have not been targeted previously in the same way as the UK,\nUnited States, and others. Instead, it appears that the new campaigns in Japan (and Spain) are\n[continuations of the trend first observed with Shifu in October 2015. The key takeaways are:](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/dridex-shifu-give-spam-bots-day-off)\n\nThe UrlZone banking Trojan is spreading via email spam and targeting Japanese and Spanish\nbanks\nThe Vawtrak Trojan is spreading using Angler Exploit Kit and targeting Japanese banks\nBoth Trojans are using the same dynamic injects system that allows them to manipulate a\nfinancial institution’s website content (likely sharing resources or renting from the same third\nparty)\nThe injects system appears to be written by a Russian author\n\n**UrlZone Banking Trojan Campaigns**\n\nOn January 21st of this year, Proofpoint researchers observed a large spam campaign consisting of\ntens of thousands of emails targeting Japanese email accounts. Other researchers have also\n[observed an uptick in UrlZone activity](https://securityintelligence.com/organized-cybercrime-big-in-japan-urlzone-now-on-the-scene) [in Japan but there are additional details behind this emerging](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/01/urlzone_zones_inon.html)\nthreat that are worth pointing out.\n\nEmails with the subject “copy 3” from multiple Gmail accounts contained a zipped executables and\nan empty email body. Proofpoint observation of actors such as those spreading Dridex over the past\nyear shows increasing use of very simple lure techniques like this throughout 2015. The simplicity\nand lack of apparent ruse does not appear to hinder this technique: it is simple to create, requires no\nimagination on the part of the actor, needs no localization, and may be sufficient to entice the user to\nclick.\n\n_[Figure 1: Email lure]_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The attachment utilized in this campaign is Andromeda. Andromeda is multi-purpose bot, but in this](https://blog.fortinet.com/post/a-good-look-at-the-andromeda-botnet)\ncase it is primarily used to download UrlZone. However, as is often the case in malware\necosystems, Andromeda was also observed loading a plethora of additional malware.\n\n_[UrlZone: a man-in-the-browser banking Trojan that has been around for several years](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/an-update-on-the-UrlZone-banker/)_\n_Pushdo Downloader: aside from_ [adding the infected computer to a spam botnet, the loader](https://www.virusbtn.com/virusbulletin/archive/2013/04/vb201304-Pushdo)\nalso downloaded a Neutrino Bot\n_[Neutrino Bot: a multi-purpose bot capable of stealing passwords, DDoS, loading additional](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2014/06/neutrino-bot-aka-kasidet.html)_\npayloads, etc. In this instance, it downloaded Pony for additional stealing.\n_[Pony: primarily used for loading additional malware and stealing passwords and Bitcoin](https://www.damballa.com/pony-loader-2-0-steals-credentials-bitcoin-wallets-source-code-sale/)_\nwallets. This instance was used for its stealing capabilities.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Proofpoint observed a related large related Cryptowall campaign on\nJanuary 27, 2016. The Cryptowall downloaded the same Neutrino Bot that was present in the\nUrlZone campaign. Also, on December 11, 2015, we observed an email campaign delivering the\nsame Andromeda botnet found in the UrlZone campaign, but in the December campaign,\nAndromeda only downloaded Pushdo. The observations suggest that these campaigns are likely\nconnected by shared affiliates and/or spamming partners.\n\n_Figure 2: UrlZone and related campaigns_\n\nThe table below shows the banks (and customers) targeted in the UrlZone campaign.\n\n**Bank** **County** **Targeted Domains**\n\nBankiter Spain empresas.bankinter.com\n\nBanco Sabadell Spain www.bancsabadell.com\n\nww1.sabadellcam.com\n\nww1.sabadellurquijo.com\n\nBanca Multicanal Spain www.ruralvia.com\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Japan directd?.smbc.co.jp\n\nThe Musashino Bank Japan ib1.musashinobank.co.jp\n\nThe Yamagata Bank Japan ib1.yamagatabank.co.jp\n\nJuroku Bank Japan bk.juroku.co.jp\n\n\n-----\n\nChugoku Bank Japan direct.chugin.co.jp\n\nBank of The Ryukyus Japan direct.ryugin.co.jp\n\nHachijuni Bank Japan direct1.82bank.co.jp\n\nThe Daishi Bank Japan ib.daishi-bank.co.jp\n\nHokkoku Bank Japan ib.hokkokubank.co.jp\n\nShinkin Bank Japan www11.ib.shinkin-ib.jp\n\nThe Norinchukin Bank Japan *direct.jabank.jp\n\nThe Tajima Bank Japan *parasol.anser.ne.jp\n\nResona Bank Japan *ib.resonabank.co.jp\n\nThe Japan Net Bank Japan *login.japannetbank.co.jp\n\nTsukuba Bank Japan ib.tsukubabank.co.jp\n\nThe Awa Bank Japan ib1.awabank.co.jp\n\nMIYAZAKIBANK Japan mib.miyagin.co.jp\n\nThe Hiroshima Bank Japan direct.ib.hirogin.co.jp\n\n_Figure 3: Japanese and Spanish banking sites targeted by this instance of UrlZone_\n\n**Vawtrak Banking Trojan Campaigns**\n\n[While our colleagues at Sophos and](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical%20papers/sophos-vawtrak-international-crimeware-as-a-service-tpna.pdf) [Trend previously wrote about Vawtrak targeting Japan in 2014](http://www.trendmicro.com.au/vinfo/au/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/3141/vawtrak-plagues-users-in-japan)\n[and earlier, there are so far no documented campaigns of the updated Vawtrak Trojan targeting](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/In-The-Shadows)\nJapan in 2015 or 2016. On February 2, 2016, however, we observed Angler EK delivering Vawtrak\nID 28 to Japanese users.\n\n_[Figure 4: Angler EK delivering Vawtrak payload with Japanese targeting]_\n\nThe table below shows the banks specifically targeted by Vawtrak in the recent campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Bank** **County** **Targeted Domains**\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Japan directd?.smbc.co.jp\n\nThe Musashino Bank Japan ib1.musashinobank.co.jp\n\nThe Yamagata Bank Japan ib1.yamagatabank.co.jp\n\nJuroku Bank Japan bk.juroku.co.jp\n\nChugoku Bank Japan direct.chugin.co.jp\n\nBank of The Ryukyus Japan direct.ryugin.co.jp\n\nThe Daishi Bank Japan ib.daishi-bank.co.jp\n\nHokkoku Bank Japan ib.hokkokubank.co.jp\n\nHachijuni Bank Japan direct1.82bank.co.jp\n\nTsukuba Bank Japan ib.tsukubabank.co.jp\n\nThe Awa Bank Japan ib1.awabank.co.jp\n\nMIYAZAKIBANK Japan ib.miyagin.co.jp\n\nThe Hiroshima Bank Japan direct.ib.hirogin.co.jp\n\nShinkin Bank Japan www11.ib.shinkin-ib.jp\n\nThe Norinchukin Bank Japan direct.jabank.jp\n\nResona Bank Japan ib.resonabank.co.jp\n\nThe Japan Net Bank Japan login.japannetbank.co.jp\n\nThe Tajima Bank Japan parasol.anser.ne.jp\n\n\n-----\n\nSBI Sumishin Net Bank Japan netbk.co.jp\n\n_Figure 5: Japanese banking sites targeted by Vawtrak ID 28_\n\n**Dynamic Injects Shared by Vawtrak and UrlZone**\n\nAfter extracting the injects code from both Trojans we observed that there is an overlap in the\ntargeted banks. Both banking Trojans are using the same dynamic injects system that allows them\nto manipulate a financial institution’s website content. This means that the two banking Trojans use\nthe same JavaScript code for stealing login credentials, PINs, one-time-passwords, etc. This could\nalso mean that the responsible actors are sharing resources or renting from the same third party.\nAdditionally, the injects JavaScript code appears to be written by a Russian developer, as observed\nby code comments such as “Startuem nash interval na proverku statusa”, which translates to “Begin\nour interval for checking the status”.\n\n_[Figure 6: Screenshot of part of the inject code]_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs others have noted, the emergence of banking Trojans in Japan and Spain presents some\nparticular challenges. While organizations in other countries like the UK and the United States have\nbeen targets for massive Dridex, Dyre, Vawtrak (and other banking Trojans) campaigns and\nbusinesses there have implemented a number of protections, countries with less experience\ncombatting these threats may find themselves vulnerable to considerable losses. Unfortunately, as\nthreat actors saturate targets in many geographies, it's only a matter of time until new geographies\nbegin experiencing the same sorts of volumes and persistence that characterize recent campaigns\nwith Dridex and other malware.\n\n**Appendix A : IOCs from campaigns containing UrlZone**\n\n**Value** **Type**\n\n1a86cf4fb4dcb0e4e3aad41bc039d8302e0fd6f9fabe203efc77e3aec35e2f66 Andromeda\nhash\n\n606708C9479E1DF26545D469D3D54A0E268F01AD8AA061F6504968C3B1594A0C UrlZone\nhash\n\n757F2C62637765CBC8C7B9F5F63ED4AB00F34485F516A66B2A81B4EDFB731920 Pushdo\nhash\n\nCE08A35831F6F5777DB6E8FEA9BAC40808917FEC019338BA00285082737611FB Neutrino Bot\nhash\n\n\n-----\n\nE90050D963D376C1F75416EBF9BC6FFA2299046F8ADD1DDE6D67752443587411 Pony hash\n\n1d6d7ea0eeec99da1add9e83f672533eeee900dc817018ee6edbf635bb08cf0a UrlZone\nhash\n\nf3b9815ea4a6c603eafadb26efebec21565deec315ee007d59e92f0f656a90bb UrlZone\nhash\n\n15896a44319d18f8486561b078146c30a0ce1cd7e6038f6d614324a39dfc6c28 UrlZone\nhash\n\n[hxxp://huremoke[.]net/get.php] Andromeda\nC2\n\n[hxxp://votehad[.]su/paris.php] Andromeda\nC2\n\n[hxxp://shardsound[.]net/images.php] Andromeda\nC2\n\n[hxxp://kernsmee[.]ru/news.php] Andromeda\nC2\n\n[hxxp://masabodhi[.]com/andoluse.php] Andromeda\nC2\n\n[hxxps://hwnbv5woeedjffn[.]com] UrlZone C2\n\n[hxxp://5.45.179[.]179/ajax.php] Neutrino Bot\nC2\n\n[hxxp://5.45.179[.]179/p/ajax.php] Pony C2\n\n[hxxp://www.fondazionelanza[.]it/eng/v3.exe] Andromeda\ndownloading\nUrlZone\n\n[hxxp://www.fondazionelanza[.]it/eng/akeyb.exe] Andromeda\ndownloading\nPushdo\nloader\n\n\n-----\n\n[hxxp://www.tajjquartet[.]com/ff/serif/payload.exe] Pushdo\nloader\ndownloading\nNeutrino Bot\n\n[hxxp://www.tajjquartet[.]com/ff/serif/ponik.exe] Neutrino Bot\ndownloading\nPony\n\n[hxxps://ifree-online[.]com] UrlZone\nInjects C2\n\n**Appendix B: IOCs from campaigns containing Vawtrak**\n\n**Value** **Type**\n\n9f1de72234dcf77ddf25b69df98058a7f9e633f803ddc2720209bb315ef3a04c Vawtrak hash\n\n[hxxp://begiekee[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://searalihid[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://zofienie[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://deehiesei[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://keanees[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://peazor[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://xeaberal[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://dietoog[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://mafoovoo[.]com/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n[hxxp://geeseazei[.]net/rss/feed/stream] Vawtrak C2\n\n91.242.163[.]74:8080 Vawtrak C2\n\n\n-----\n\n[hxxp://5.187.2[.]19/module/272a5ad4a1b97a2ac874d6d3e5fff01d] Vawtrak\ndownloading\nmodule\n\n[hxxp://5.187.2[.]19/module/2f6421d9a99d75c5d153edda3f1fe5e3] Vawtrak\ndownloading\nmodule\n\n[hxxp://5.187.2[.]19/module/9079dae8e107342d8f3747fa74ab8a57] Vawtrak\ndownloading\nmodule\n\n[hxxp://5.187.2[.]19/module/7afb9776a27d97b2f43f8de256448072] Vawtrak\ndownloading\nmodule\n\n[hxxp://5.187.2[.]19/upd/28] Vawtrak\ndownloading\nupdate\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
