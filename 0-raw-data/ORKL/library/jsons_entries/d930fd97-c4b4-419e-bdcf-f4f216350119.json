However, lately this ransomware payload has been observed in campaigns against\nuniversities and other institutions in the education vertical. Most recently, Clop Ransomware has been\n[used in a cyberattack that demanded one of the highest ransom amounts in recorded history ($20](https://blogs.infoblox.com/security/clop-ransomware-demands-20-million-ransom/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[million), and one of the particular items associated with the actors behind the Clop Ransomware is](https://blogs.infoblox.com/security/clop-ransomware-demands-20-million-ransom/)\nblackmailing their victims through threatening to publish sensitive information exfiltrated from victims’\n[networks. Within this past month in April, we saw that Clop Ransomware-related threats were](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-group-targets-universities-of-maryland-california-in-new-data-leaks/)\npersistent throughout the distinct variants used by several groups of organized criminals and decided\nto focus our research efforts on Clop Ransomware detections. We hope that these detections will help\norganizations detect abnormal behavior faster before it becomes detrimental. Watch this video to learn\nmore.\n\n## Detection Searches for Clop Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n[As we state in our blog, \"Detecting Clop Ransomware,\" the actors behind this crimeware send the](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detecting-clop-ransomware.html)\nmalicious payloads via different methods, such as phishing emails, then proceed to spread\nransomware payload post-exploitation by pivoting to exposed or related vulnerable systems. Although\nthe actual developers of this crimeware have not been identified yet, they have been tied to several\n[financially-driven threat actors. They are also known for leveraging public available vulnerabilities as](https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware-fin11/164150/)\n[entry and post-exploitation vectors.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion.html)\n\nThe most common method behind this crimeware is as follows: once they have infiltrated their targets,\nthey then present instructions on how to pay ransom and communicate further threats of exposure by\npublishing the sensitive information they obtained on a publicly accessible website.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Source *](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/security-informationen-en/leakware-ransomware-hybrid-attacks/)_\n\nAlthough this may appear as a new modality, in reality ransomware is usually the cherry on top of the\ncake, as malicious actors usually dwell, exfiltrate and qualify exfiltrated data, which eventually lands on\ndark web public forums, dark markets or private crime intelligence brokers where qualified financial,\nbusiness and kompromat information is then priced and sold to the highest bidder.\n\nWe used our [attack range tool to demonstrate and research how this malware payload infects and](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range_local)\nspreads once executed.

We also provide information about a Splunk Phantom playbook that](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/playbook-series-ransomware-detect-block-contain-and-remediate.html)\ncan be used to defend against this threat.\n\n## Why Should You Care?\n\n[Having the paid ransom amounts in recorded history ($20 million) and the fact that the Clop](https://blogs.infoblox.com/security/clop-ransomware-demands-20-million-ransom/)\nRansomware actors are extremely opportunistic makes this a specially worrisome actor. The actors\nbehind this crimeware are constantly looking for vulnerable targets, and once they are able to infiltrate\nvictims, they are driven by obtaining sensitive information which most likely will end up sold in a dark\nmarket.\n\nRansomware campaigns involving this payload will continue, as this group continuously targets\ndifferent verticals it is important to prepare and understand the workings of these malicious payloads\nand prepare your environment in order to defend and be resilient against a ransomware attack. You\ncan use our pre-packaged detections to help your organization stay safe against these types of\nattacks.\n\n[For a full list of security content, check out the release notes on Splunk Docs:](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ESSOC)\n\n[3.18.0 (Clop Story)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ESSOC/3.18.0/RN/Enhancements)\n[3.19.0](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ESSOC/3.19.0/RN/Enhancements)\n\n## Learn More\n\n[You can find the latest content about security analytic stories on GitHub and in Splunkbase.
