    "plain_text": "-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n17 October 2017\n\n# WikiLeaks Task Force\n\n## Final Report\n\n\n-----\n\n17 October 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n/\n\n\n#### Critical Context\n\n**CCI: The WikiLeaks breach occurred at CCI, whose mission is to transform intelligence**\nthrough cyber operations. It would be unfair to lay the blame for the breach with the\ncurrent management, as the breach occurred before most joined CCI. Equally, CCI correctly\nnotes that the mission system in question complied with all Agency requirements at the time of\nthe breach. However, in a press to meet growing and critical mission needs, CCI had prioritized\nbuilding cyber weapons at the expense of securing their own systems. Day-to-day security\npractices had become woefully lax. The Development Network (DevLAN) on which CCI’s work\nproduct resided had been certified and accredited, but CCI had not worked with CIMC to\ndevelop or deploy user activity monitoring or robust server audit capability. Most of our sensitive\ncyber weapons were not compartmented, users shared systems administrator-level passwords,\nthere were no effective removable media controls, and historical data was available to users\nindefinitely. Furthermore, CCI focused on building cyber weapons and neglected to also prepare\nmitigation packages if those tools were exposed. These shortcomings were emblematic of a\nculture that evolved over years that too often prioritized creativity and collaboration at the\nexpense of security.\n\n**Mission Systems: CIA has moved too slowly to put in place the safeguards that we**\nknew were necessary given successive breaches to other US Government agencies. For nearly\na decade WikiLeaks has exploited the digital realm to profoundly reshape opportunities for\nindividuals sworn to protect our nation’s secrets to leak classified or sensitive information. While\nCIA was an early leader in securing our enterprise information technology (IT) system, we failed\nto correct acute vulnerabilities to our mission IT systems. Because the stolen data resided on a\nmission system that lacked user activity monitoring and a robust server audit capability, we did\nnot realize the loss had occurred until a year later, when WikiLeaks publicly announced it in\nMarch 2017. Had the data been stolen for the benefit of a state adversary and not published, we\nmight still be unaware of the loss—as would be true for the vast majority of data on Agency\nmission systems.\n\n— The Agency for years has developed and operated IT mission systems outside the\npurview and governance of enterprise IT, citing the need for mission functionality and\nspeed. While often fulfilling a valid purpose, this “shadow IT” exemplifies a broader cultural\nissue that separates enterprise IT from mission IT, has allowed mission system owners to\ndetermine how or if they will police themselves, and has placed the Agency at\nunacceptable risk.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis wake-up call presents us\nwith an opportunity to right longstanding imbalances and lapses, to reorient how we view risk,\n. We must recognize when we are taking smart risks and\nwhen operational shortcuts or waivers create unwarranted risk to our work and to the Agency.\nWe must care as much about securing our systems as we care about running them if we are to\nmake the necessary revolutionary change.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nThe WikiLeaks Vault 7 disclosures have brought to light multiple ongoing CIA failures that\nour recommendations are designed to address:\n\n— We failed to equip the mission system in question with user activity monitoring and\nrobust server audit capability, which could have deterred, detected, and possibly prevented\nthe theft.\n\n— We failed to empower any single officer with the ability to ensure that all Agency\ninformation systems are built secure and remain so throughout their life cycle. Because no\none had that ability, no one was accountable—and the mission system in question, like\n\n### many others, lacked appropriate security.\n\n— We failed to ensure that our ability to secure our information systems against\nemerging threats kept pace with the growth of such systems across the Agency.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n— We failed to recognize or act in a coordinated fashion on warning signs that a person\nor persons with access to CIA classified information posed an unacceptable risk to national\nsecurity. (See recommendations B1, B2, B3, B4, B6, B7, B8, B9, and C8.)\n\nbA “ d ” l it i ft d i d t l it i l k t h d t l bilit\n\n\n-----\n\n**Recommendation A5:**\n\n**_Enhance information technology security guidelines and classified information_**\n**_handling restrictions for zero-day exploits and offensive cyber tools, consistent with_**\n**_Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information. We judge the vulnerability_**\nof and threat to this information is exceptional and warrants additional security protections, to\ninclude requiring segmentation of knowledge, tools, and people through physical and logical\ninfrastructure, policy and procedural controls, and enforcing strict need-to-know access to the\ntools and exploits.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe WikiLeaks disclosures revealed resource-driven gaps and weaknesses in CIA’s\ninsider threat program. There have been seams in communication between components such\nas the Office of Medical Services, Human Resources, Security, Counterintelligence Mission\nCenter, and line management that have sometimes prevented us from connecting the dots to\ncorporately detect and address insider threats.\n\n— We have been slow—due to resource choices and cultural resistance—to extend\nstate-of-the-art audit and user activity monitoring technology to mission systems not\nconnected to the main enterprise network.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nFrequent personnel security reviews and\ntraining have focused on enterprise “privileged users,” defined as individuals designated and\nentrusted by managers to perform elevated functions on a network, system, or application. This\ndoes not include privileged users on mission systems or those with extraordinary access or\ncapabilities, such as EDG developers.\n\n\n-----\n\nData in Confluence, a collaboration and communication platform, and some\ndata in Stash, a source code repository, have been released by WikiLeaks; we assess\nWikiLeaks possesses all of the Confluence and Stash data.[51] However, we now assess with\nmoderate confidence that WikiLeaks does not possess the Gold folder of final versions of all\ndeveloped tools and source code that resided on the Development Network (DevLAN), even\nthough WikiLeaks claims it has released only a small slice of the archive it possesses. The Gold\nfolder was better protected; WikiLeaks so far has released data in Stash despite the availability\nof newer, easier to exploit versions of tools in Gold; and Gold’s size, several terabytes, made it\nharder to export.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe WikiLeaks disclosures revealed gaps and weaknesses in CIA’s Insider Threat\nprogram, which has traditionally relied on close coordination between the Office of Security and\nCIMC. Among the gaps are the seams in communication between components such as the\nOffice of General Counsel, Medical Services, Human Resources, security, counterintelligence,\nand line management that have sometimes prevented us from connecting the dots to\ncorporately detect and address Insider Threat issues.\n\n\n-----",
