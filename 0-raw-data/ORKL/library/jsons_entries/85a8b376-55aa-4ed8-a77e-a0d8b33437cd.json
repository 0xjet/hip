Periodic review of past collection can often identify new details. Recent findings\nindicate Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev is associated with the cyber threat actor commonly\nreferred to as Sandworm (a.k.a. Voodoo Bear, Telebots, Iron Viking), and he could have links\n\n\n-----\n\nto Russia s Federal Protective Service (FSO). An account using the name and picture of\nArtem Andreyevich Malyshev, an officer in Unit 26165 (a.k.a. Fancy Bear, APT28), appears\non a Russian freelancing website advertising computer services, such as system\nadministrator and programming.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Unit 74455**\n\n[On October 15, 2020, the US Department of Justice indicted six Russian General Staff Main](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nIntelligence Directorate (GRU/GR) officers from Unit 74455 (a.k.a. Sandworm, Voodoo Bear,\nTelebots, Iron Viking) for their alleged roles in computer network operations. The alleged\nintrusions included the following targets:\n\nCritical infrastructure in Ukraine (a.k.a. Black Energy, KillDisk, Industroyer);\n\nA political campaign in France;\n\nThe country of Georgia;\n\nInternational victims of the “NotPetya” malware attacks;\n\n2018 Winter Olympic Games (a.k.a. Olympic Destroyer); and\n\nInvestigations of nerve agent attacks that have been publicly attributed to the Russian\ngovernment.\n\nIn February 2020, the US State Department [reported that GRU's Main Center for Special](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-condemns-russian-cyber-attack-against-the-country-of-georgia/)\nTechnologies (GTsST), in particular Unit 74455 and 'Sandworm' carried out a disruptive\ncyber attack against the country of Georgia. Approximately five months later, the European\nUnion (EU) sanctioned several cyber threat actors, including Unit 74455. The EU further\nelaborated on their designation of Unit 74455 by saying it aligns with the threat actor\nSandworm. Prior to these details it was not publicly reported that Unit 74455 corresponded to\nthe Sandworm threat actor, and all the intrusions described in the October 2020 indictment\nwere perpetrated by Unit 74455.\n\nThe [Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election,](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)\ncommonly referred to as the Mueller Report, provide new details on the role Unit 74455\nplayed in interference of the 2016 US Presidential Elections. According to the report, Unit\n74455 assisted with the release of documents stolen by Unit 26165, the promotion of those\nrelease documents, and the publication of anti-Clinton content on social media. Furthermore,\nofficers from Unit 74455 separately targeted state boards of elections, secretaries of state,\nand U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the\n\n\n-----\n\nadministration of U.S. elections. One of the individuals previously reported on, Anatoliy\nSergeyevich Kovalev is an officer in Unit 74455. Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev (Ковалев\nАнатолий Сергеевич)\n\nSince last identifying information related to Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, hereinafter Mr.\nKovlev, one of the VK accounts linked to Mr. Kovalev has been deleted. It is unclear why\nonly one of the two previously linked accounts is deleted, but the account used the alias\nNikita Abramov. The deletion of the account inspired further analysis on the other active\naccount.\n\nFigure 1 - Deleted VK account linked to Mr. Kovalev\n\nOne of the pictures on the active account is the same picture that was observed on the now\ndeleted Nikita Abramov account, as seen in figure 2. The picture shows Mr. Kovalev in a race\nbib sporting number 155. At the time, the number on the bib was used to cross refence both\naccounts and confirm their relation to Mr. Kovalev. A newly discovered facial recognition tool\nidentifies if two faces are the same person with some level of certainty. That race bib picture\ncompared to the FBI picture of Mr. Kovalev produced a match with 88% certainty. An\noverlooked emblem on the race bib also provides new insights into Mr. Kovalev's career.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 - Face match of Mr. Kovalev\n\nThe emblem on the top right of the race bib is actually the insignia for Russia's Federal\nProtective Service (FSO). The FSO is a Russian government agency focused on protecting\nhigh-ranking state officials, including the Russian President. The picture was posted on the\nVK account sometime in or around 2013, which would put Mr. Kovalev at 21 or 22 years old\nin the picture (using the date of birth provided by the FBI). There is even chance that in or\naround 2013 Mr. Kovalev either joined or attempted to join the FSO, but by at least 2016 had\nbecame a part of Sandworm. Mr. Kovalev appears to have a full career working for the\nRussian government. However, Mr. Kovalev's colleague, Artem Andreyevich Malyshev\nappears to be venturing into the private sector.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 - FSO logo on Mr. Kovalev's clothing\n\n**Artem Andreyevich Malyshev (Артём Андреевич Малышев)**\n\nArtem Andreyevich Malyshev, hereinafter Mr. Malyshev, has risen through the ranks from a\n[likely military cook to an officer in Unit 26165. One of the pictures of Mr. Malyshev that was](https://www.riskint.blog/post/fancy-bear-s-new-faces)\npreviously identified on multiple online accounts, possesses a 84% certainty match with the\nFBI picture of Mr. Malyshev. This same picture has been recently identified on a Russian\nfreelancing website.\n\nFigure 4 - Face match of Mr. Malyshev\n\n\n-----\n\nA reverse image search of the picture seen in Figure 4 produced an account on a Russian\nfreelancing website. The account is linked to a \"Malyshev Artem Andreyevich\", which is the\nsame name as Mr. Malyshev, but with his surname before his given name. The account\nshows services offered include System Administrator, Programming, IT outsourcing, Web\nDesign, Typing and Printing. The prices for these services are unavailable and need to be\nrequested. Each freelancer account has a rating that uses a scale from one to five, with one\nbeing poor and five being great. The account with Mr. Malyshev's photo is only rated a 4.1\nout 5. There are many other freelancers who have a higher rating, including many with a 5\nout of 5.\n\nFigure 5 - Freelancer account with Mr. Malyshev\n\nThere is not date on the account to assess if it is owned and controlled by Mr. Malyshev. The\npicture is publicly available and could be used by anyone to create the account. However, I\nlike to think Mr. Malyshev went from hacking the Democratic National Convention, United\nStates Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to\nbecoming a run-of-the-mill system admin for you average mom and pop shop. If Mr.\nMalyshev was driving Uber he would be suspended with that weak 4.1 rating.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRevisiting previous analysis can be quite useful for anyone in an analytical profession. In this\ncase, newly released details on Sandworm allow for better attribution of Mr. Kovalev and Unit\n74455. Overlooked details in a picture of Mr. Kovalev help understand his career path and\npossible affiliations with other Russian government organizations. It remains unconfirmed if\nMr. Malyshev has or is currently moonlighting as a freelancer, but periodic checks on past\ncollection could be beneficial for identifying new and critical details.\n\n\n-----",
