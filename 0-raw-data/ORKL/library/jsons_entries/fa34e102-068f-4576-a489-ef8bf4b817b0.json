Recently, we discovered\nthe Tropic Trooper group targeting Taiwanese and the Philippine military’s physically isolated\nenvironment using a USBferry attack (the name derived from a sample found in a related research).\nUSBferry has variants that perform different commands depending on specific targets; it can also\ncombine capabilities, improve its stealth in infected environments, and steal critical information through\nUSB storage. Based on our telemetry, this kind of attack has been active since December 2014 and has\nbeen solely targeting military or government users located in Asia. We started tracking this particular\ncampaign in 2018, and our analysis shows that this campaign uses a fake executable decoy and USB\ntrojan strategy to steal targets’ information.\n\nFigure 1. A sample scenario of the USBferry attack\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detailing Tropic Trooper’s campaign\n\n### The discovery of the USBferry attack\n\n[We first discovered the malware from a PwC report, which mentioned](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/research/the-keyboys-are-back-in-town.html) a sample related to Tropic Trooper\nbut did not include a detailed analysis. Based on this clue and our data, Tropic Trooper has been using\nthe USBferry attack to deliver its payload to victims as early as December 2014.\n\nWe also observed many malware versions and PDB (program database) strings. This should be noted\nbecause, based on this pattern, we can map out an evolution list of the USBferry malware and attacks.\nTheir hardcoded malware version number pattern is similar to our previous report on Tropic Trooper.\nFurthermore, the malware version number implies that the USBferry malware was modified from trojan\n[TROJ_YAHOYAH, as published in our report. From the PDB strings, we also found two interesting](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\ndetails: The USBferry malware has at least three versions (Find the full list in the indicators of\ncompromise [IoCs] section of this document), and it has different variants and components.\n\nThe PDB strings in USBferry malware also provided us with insights into the campaign, including the\nmalware versions:\n\n  - E:\\Work\\VS Project\\USBFerry_For_PH\\Bin\\Install_EXE.pdb\n\n  - E:\\Work\\VS Project\\USBFerry_For_PH\\Print\\Install_EXE.pdb\n\n  - E:\\Work\\VS Project\\USBFerry_CopyFile_20150331\\Bin\\Install_EXE.pdb\n\n  - D:\\work\\vs\\UsbFerry_v2\\bin\\UsbFerry.pdb\n\n  - D:\\work\\vs\\UsbFerry_v2\\Release\\AddAutoRun_x32.pdb\n\n  - D:\\work\\vs\\UsbFerry_v3\\bin\\UFLoader.pdb\n\n  - D:\\work\\vs\\UsbFerry_v3\\bin\\UsbFerry.pdb\n\n### A USB malware called USBferry\n\nWe initially decided to name this malware TROJ_YAHOYAH and thought it was an old malware that has\ndifferent variants. Its malware network protocol makes it similar to the trojan TROJ_YAHOYAH. However,\nwe found that the beacon information was a bit different from the oldest one — the hardcode VR strings\nfrom PH changes to UF.\n\nFigure 2. USBferry malware with HTTP GET request sample\n\nOur analysis found that USBferry malware has three versions:\n\n  - The first one is a small component with TROJ_YAHOYAH; it will try to check if the target\ncomputer has a USB plugin and copy the USBferry malware installer into USB storage. In this\nversion, TROJ_YAHOYAH differs from the oldest one. We also found that a few\nTROJ_YAHOYAH samples changed slightly in specific target environments. For instance, some\nexecute Windows commands, source the victim file or folder list and list the victim’s network\n\n\n-----\n\ntopology, and copy files from a physically isolated host to a compromised host that has a USB\ndisk.\n\n  - The second one has all the capabilities of the first one, but this version combines two malware\nvariants into one executable.\n\n  - The third one also has all the capabilities of the above version; however, this version is designed\nto be more stealthy in the target's environment. It will reside in the rundll32.exe memory.\n\nFigure 3. USBferry malware’s first version with trojan TROJ_YAHOYAH, where the EXE file is the USBferry malware,\n\nand the DLL file is the trojan TROJ_YAHOYAH\n\nFigure 4. USBferry malware’s second version combined into one executable\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. USBferry malware’s third version becomes resident in memory\n\n### The evolution of USBferry’s infection\n\nTo paint a bigger picture of Tropic Trooper’s attacks, we correlated the tools and tactics they used against\ntheir targets. We list the notable changes found in Tropic Trooper’s latest campaign below.\n\nVersion PH5.0 20141217’s attack chain:\n\n  - Uses a fake installer file, sent via spam email to lure a potential victim into clicking it\n\n  - The fake installer will check the OS version first and drop three USBferry malware components,\nencrypted C&C configuration file, USB malware, and trojan downloader\n\n  - It will create the autorun function in the victim's host, located in \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Local\nSettings\\Microsoft\\UsbKey\" folder\n\n  - The trojan downloader will try to download an image file from the C&C website and use\nsteganography to decrypt the encrypted payload inside the image\n\n  - The final payload will run resident in the victim's host memory and connect to the C&C server\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. USBferry attack scenario, version PH5.0 20141217\n\nFigure 7. Three USBferry malware components\n\nFigure 8. USBferry malware autorun function in the target host\n\nTropic Trooper uses the old way of achieving infection: by ferrying the installer into an air-gapped host\nmachine via USB. They employ the USB worm infection strategy using the USB device to carry the\nmalware into the target's computer and facilitate a breach into the secure network environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. USBferry malware using USB worm infection strategy\n\nFigure 10. Malware version PH5.0 20141217 with HTTP GET request sample\n\nVersion PH5.0 20150211, PH5.0 20150213, and PH5.0 20150323 attack chains:\n\nThese three malware versions have all the capabilities of the version above, plus other functions\ndepending on the purpose. It will also copy an installer into the USB recovery folder to keep the USBferry\nmalware under the radar. Recovery folder location examples are the following:\n\n  - E:\\Vessels\\OSS\\STI (marked) \\fromvessel\\STI (marked) up 27 Nov 2019\\Recovery\\file001.chk\n\n  - G:\\Recovery\\file001.chk\n\nFigure 11. USBferry malware hides the installer in the USB recovery folder\n\n\n-----\n\nSpecific functions will be embedded in the trojan downloader to adopt the target environment. Our indepth analysis found that when Tropic Trooper first penetrates the victim's environment, they will use\nbasic sourcing scripts to collect the host network’s topology, connection capability, and volume\ninformation. The second function uses USB storage to copy highly classified documents from the\nphysically isolated environment. Moreover, this function copies certain files into the USB %RECYCLER%\nfolder, monitors files’ modified time, and updates the newest one to the USB device. The last function will\ninfiltrate the target’s internal machine with a customized Windows command and reverse backdoor\nmalware. The summary of the attack is detailed below.\n\nFigure 12. USBferry attack scenario for version PH5.0 20150211, PH5.0 20150213, and PH5.0 20150323\n\nTropic Trooper modifies the sourcing command to achieve its goal on different targets. Based on some\nscripts, we can identify their main target industry or the type of document formats they were trying to find.\nThe following figures will show the scripts we found embedded in the different malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Sourcing script inside the USBferry malware\n\nWith the sourcing commands found in the malware, Tropic Trooper intends to learn the network topology\nof a target environment. By using \"tracert\" and \"ping\" commands, the group discovers the target’s network\narchitecture. For example, \"tracert -h 8 8.8.8.8\" collects the route (path) and measures transit delays of\npackets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The pings, meanwhile, are used to test the target\nnetwork’s connectivity; the actors want to know if the machine has access to the internal network and the\ntarget mail portal. Tropic Trooper can then use the gathered information to plan and prepare the next\nstage of the attack.\n\nAn analysis of the copy function reveals that Tropic Trooper tries to use the USB storage to exfiltrate\nimportant data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Copy algorithm inside the USBferry malware\n\nFigure 15. Monitoring the target files’ modified times and updating the files on the USB with the ones to send out\n\nThe last strategy uses a command to set the target's host machine. The command indicates that Tropic\nTrooper already knows the target’s administrator account password and its internal network topology.\nThis way, Tropic Trooper can easily use a tool to execute the backdoor directly. On the other hand, these\nscripts also show how they use a loader to execute the backdoor, and the following command also\nindicates the malware components’ location. From those locations, we can also identify that this payload\nbelongs to the BKDR_YAHAMAM family. The command inside the malware is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Attacking the internal machine with known account username/password and tools to execute the\n\nbackdoor directly\n\nVersion UF0.4 20160202’s attack chain:\n\nIn this version, Tropic Trooper decided to name this special target attack as UF, which is an abbreviation\nof USBferry. We also learned that this version is the USBferry malware version 2, based on these PDB\nstrings:\n\n  - D:\\work\\vs\\UsbFerry_v2\\bin\\UsbFerry.pdb\n\n  - D:\\work\\vs\\UsbFerry_v2\\Release\\AddAutoRun_x32.pdb\n\nTropic Trooper no longer uses two components to achieve the USBferry attack in this version; they\ninstead combined two malware versions and changed the name of the new malware to a less suspicioussounding one. They also changed the malware location from C:\\Users\\Public\\Local\nSettings\\Microsoft\\UsbKey to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Flash\\, and hid the files’ attributes to evade\ndetection.\n\nFigure 17. USBferry attack scenario, version UF0.4 20160202\n\n\n-----\n\nThis latest version of the USBferry malware has an auto-start component embedded in its resource\nsection. This component is executed by rundll32.exe and terminates the flash_en.exe installer. Afterward,\nit writes the autorun to the registry and executes the USBferry malware with the -I command, which can\nexecute the process without showing any windows on the user desktop.\n\n  - Registered value → KEY: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell]; DATA:\n\n[explorer.exe,%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Flash\\flash_en.exe I]; TYPE: [REG_SZ]\n\n  - Executed command → cmd /c \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Flash\\flash_en.exe\" -I\n\nFigure 18. Auto-start component embedded in the resource section\n\nFigure 19. USBferry malware hidden in the Flash folder\n\nFigure 20. Malware version UF0.4 20160202 with HTTP GET request sample\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion UF1.0 20160226’s attack chain:\n\nThe latest USBferry malware uses DLL injection in the target's host machine. Here’s a summary of the\nUSBferry malware’s attack chain:\n\n1. The decoy file will drop a flash_en.inf DLL file, which is a USBferry loader, and it will try to load\n\nthe encrypted USBferry malware\n2. Encrypt the USBferry malware embedded in the loader resource section, and the loader will drop\n\nit in the C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Flash folder and name it \"flash.dat\"\n3. After loading the encrypted payload, the loader will inject a malicious DLL into rundll32.exe while\n\nthe USBferry malware will load C&C configuration file and flash_en.dat, which is also located in\nthe \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Flash\"\n4. The USBferry malware will try to connect to the download site and use Windows command to\n\ncollect/copy target host data\n\nFigure 21. USBferry attack scenario, version UF1.0 20160226\n\nFigure 22. USBFerry Loader, C&C configuration file, and encrypted USBFerry malware hidden in the Flash folder\n\nThis version will check the network capability first if the network is unavailable, then it will try to collect the\ntarget information and copy the collected data into USB storage. This allows the USB device to carry the\ngathered information out to send to the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. Exfiltrate target machine information through USB storage\n\nFigure 24. Collecting target machine information and writing it into the files with a timestamp\n\n### Backdoor information and versions\n\nIn a recent incident, we discovered four different backdoors Tropic Trooper has used. Some backdoors\nuse injection to execute its routines, while others execute directly and run themselves constantly.\nIncidentally, we also have Tropic Trooper's backdoor controller and tools. One of their known backdoors,\n\n[BKDR_YAHAMAM, was mentioned in our previous whitepaper](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf) on the group. Tropic Trooper also uses\nthe steganography technique to mask their backdoor routines and evade anti-malware and network\nperimeter detection.\n\nTo find the full list of the backdoor hashes we encountered and their respective malware version\nnumbers, check the IoCs listed at the end of this document.\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion WelCome To Svchost 3.2 20110818’s backdoor:\n\nAfter a full analysis of this backdoor, we noted a few interesting details. First, this backdoor has the same\nfunctionality as HL3.7x86_20140711, which is a backdoor payload discussed in the aforementioned\nTrend Micro whitepaper. Second, from this malware version number, we can confirm this backdoor\nvariant’s first version was developed in or before 2011, which means that Tropic Trooper’s activities have\nbeen ongoing for at least ten years now. Third, this backdoor version also tells us that this malware runs\nunder svchost.exe, hence the name \"WelCome To Svchost.\"\n\nFigure 25. Backdoor version name, registered service name, and malware components’ filenames\n\nVersion Welcome To IDShell 1.0 20150310’s backdoor:\n\nWe believe this backdoor’s purpose is to recon the target machine because it has fewer functions\ncompared to previous versions. We listed its backdoor capabilities below.\n\n? or Help -->Help Memu\nPut [RecvIP] [Port] [FileName] -->Send File To FileClient\nReSetPut -->Reset Put Func\nGetFile [IP] [Port] [FileName] -->Get File From FileServer\nGet [http://IP/A[.]exe] [File.exe] -->Download File\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------SysInfo -->1 View System Infor\nSoftInfo -->3 View Installed SoftWare\nPslist -->7 List Process\nPskill [PID] -->Kill Process\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shell [cmd.exe] -->4 Get A Shell\nShellA -->Get Shell As LogonUser\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ver -->Show Version\nExit -->Exit Control\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------List Help Completed\n\nWe were able to get two types of this backdoor. This backdoor has a DLL file version and is directly\nexecuted by rundll32.exe. It also has another steganography jpg version, which needs a downloader to\ndownload and decrypt it. Then, it can execute successfully in the target machine. This kind of backdoor,\nincluding all previous versions, uses DNS protocol to communicate with the backdoor controller. Tropic\n\n\n-----\n\nTrooper also encrypted the traffic to prevent network detection products from blocking it. The traffic is\nshown below.\n\nFigure 26. Backdoor’s communication traffic\n\nWe were also able to source Tropic Trooper's remote controller tool. The tool provides a user interface\n(UI) that allows the group to send instructions to and monitor any compromised endpoint host. This tool\ncan remotely control all the samples developed before 2015-03-10.\n\nFigure 27. Backdoor’s help list and version number. The backdoor remote controller tool also needs a password to\n\nget the backdoor control permission\n\nDuring our analysis, we found more tools the Tropic Trooper group has used. The tools include port relay\ntools, a command-line remote controller tool, and backdoor payload/steganography payload execution\n\n\n-----\n\nloaders. The group also used port scanning tools during their attack. We provide a snapshot of the attack\nbelow.\n\n1. Remote control listener/port relay tool\n\nTropic Trooper developed several tools to adapt to different situations and versions of the\nbackdoors/downloaders.\n\nFigure 28. The lightweight version of the remote control listener\n\nFigure 29. The professional version of the remote control listener uses a more interactive strategy for communicating\n\nwith the backdoor\n\nFigure 30. The SSL version of the remote control listener, which can use the SSL protocol to communicate with the\n\nbackdoor\n\n2. Backdoor payload/steganography payload execution loaders\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload loader has two versions. This loader was also seen in the attack scripts shown in Figure 16.\nTropic Trooper can use this loader to successfully load the encrypted payload and execute the backdoor\nloader to run the delete command that deletes itself and the encrypted payload. As seen below, the threat\nactor needs to type the correct password to execute these loaders.\n\nFigure 31. Payload execution loaders’ 2.0 version\n\nFigure 32. Payload execution loaders’ 2.1 version, which is the latest version and is more stabilized\n\nThe screenshot below shows how we used this payload loader to load the steganography payload in our\ntest machine. The loader will check the process handle first, then check if the loader executed with\nAdministrator permissions. After that, the loader will try to run svchost.exe, which is the backdoor carrier.\nIt finally injects the backdoor BKDR_YAHAMAM and set up the backdoor components. The components’\n\n[setting path and filename are all discussed in our previous Tropic Trooper whitepaper.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\n\nFigure 33. Loaders execute the payload with debug strings\n\n3. Port scanning tools\n\nTropic Trooper also used this port scan tool in their attack operation; this tool is available for download\nonline.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 34. TCP port scanner tool\n\nVersion Hey! Welcome Server 1.0/1.5/2.0’s backdoor:\n\nThis kind of backdoor is different from the previous ones, as it does not use a reverse connection to\nconnect to any C&C servers. This backdoor will start a web service in the target host and wait for Tropic\nTrooper to control the machine. Our analysis found that this backdoor is more like an invisible web shell\nand has a few powerful features to evade network security products, even the system/web server cannot\nlog the connection or behavior for this invisible web shell.\n\nThis invisible web shell has three notable features: First, it will run the process as a service to make\nincident response more difficult. Second, this web shell utilizes the ring 0 port-reuse technique to hide the\nbackdoor communication, allowing malicious traffic to hide in normal traffic communication. This web shell\nalso developed a customized protocol and path to forbidden and unknown connections or any\nunauthorized connections.\n\nFigure 35. Customized TCP protocol and waits for Tropic Trooper connection\n\nVersion Hey! Welcome Server 1.0 backdoor:\n\nHow this web shell is invisible is very interesting. We found that this web shell uses three uncommon\nWindows APIs — HttpInitialize, HttpCreateHttpHandle, and HttpAddUrl — to achieve its goal. With the\nAPIs, the malware can easily create an HTTP listener to wait for Tropic Trooper to access the page by\nusing gethostbyname to get the host machine’s IP address and combining it with \"http://\" or \"https://\" to\nachieve the web service URL. In this version, the web shell also hardcodes the path and encrypts it in the\n.rtext section.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 36. Encrypted URL path\n\nFigure 37. Using the gethostbyname API to get the host machine IP address\n\nFigure 38. HTTP URL combination algorithm using HttpAddUrl API\n\nAfter setting up the web shell connection URL, Tropic Trooper can input the correct format to connect the\nweb shell and remotely control the target host. For instance:\n\n  - Connection URL: \"https://{victim host IP}::443/Pages/about.aspx\"\n\n  - Correct cookie format: <cookie_name>=<password>;<encoded_cmd>\n\n  - Cookie_name: 1YV610vNfl+5Ftolm0qMzQ++\n\n  - Password: awdsxz\n\n  - Encoded_cmd: [Modify base64 strings]\n\nIf the input cookie format is incorrect, then the web shell will return \"HTTP Error 404.0 - File Not Found.\"\nand acts as if it were a real web service.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command|Command description|\n|---|---|\n|.#|Shows current directory information|\n|.sysinfo|Shows target machine information, which includes Product Name, Processor Name, System Name, host disk information, current directory information, and MAC address|\n|.cd|Change directory|\n|.download|Downloads files from the target host|\n|.upload|Uploads files to the target host|\n|.ul|Co-works command with .upload; this command is to appoint Tropic Trooper’s host files|\n\n\nTable 1. Web shell’s commands and capabilities\n\nFigure 39. Hardcode cookie name\n\nFigure 40. Wrong cookie format input will return \"HTTP Error 404.0 - File Not Found.\"\n\nVersion Hey! Welcome Server 1.5’s backdoor:\n\nVersion 1.5 has all the capabilities of the first one, plus the ability to set up a connection port and path in\nthe web shell URL. Moreover, in this version, Tropic Trooper changes it from a dynamic-link library (DLL)\nversion to an executable version. This change could help the actor more easily restart the web shell\nservice and change the connection port and path. This version also improves the exception debug\nstrings; if the web shell receives an unknown HTTP GET request, it will respond with \"Not Implemented\"\nmessages and print out debug strings on the server site.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 41. A tool used to emulate Tropic Trooper communication with a 64-bit version of the invisible web shell\n\nFigure 42. Exception debug strings when the web shell receives an unknown HTTP GET request\n\nVersion Hey! Welcome Server 2.0’s backdoor:\n\nThe invisible web shell 2.0 version has made more progress. This version has not only improved hidden\ntechnical aspects to go around detection, but also added more exceptions to handle wrong input\ncommands or unauthorized access. We found Tropic Trooper has several ways to execute the web shell.\nFirst, it is the same as the 1.0 version that uses DLL hijacking and runs on svchost.exe. Second, like the\n2.0 version, Tropic Trooper compiles the web shell as an executable file and directly runs it in the target\nhost. Third, it uses a web shell loader to load the encrypted web shell and uses process hollowing to\ninject into dllhost.exe. Moreover, the web shell in the 2.0 version is available in 64-bit and 32-bit versions.\n\nFigure 43. The executable version will install and name it as a Windows service, change registry to disable error\n\ndisplay, and launch the service\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 44. The loader will try to search *.dat file, which is an encrypted payload\n\nFigure 45. The loader will use XOR with key 0x90 to decrypt the encrypted payload and inject into dllhost.exe\n\nFor handling wrong inputs and displaying fake webpages to trick users and security analysts, Tropic\nTrooper checks every input argument. If any arguments are missing or incorrect, the web shell will\nrespond with \"404 File Not Found.\" The error is not a simple text on the web page; Tropic Trooper adds\nthe HTML code inside to make the fake 404 page more realistic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 46. The web shell checks each input argument; it responds with \"404 File Not Found.\" if it finds any missing or\n\nincorrect argument\n\nFigure 47. The HTML code is inside to make the fake 404 page more realistic\n\nThis version uses a different web shell request format; this version of the web shell still uses a cookie as\nthe authorization password. However, Tropic Trooper needs to type two values in the cookie column.\nBoth cookie names could be random strings, but the first cookie should match the cookie value, which is\nin the hardcoded web shell, and the second cookie could be any of the backdoor commands (e.g., .#,\n.sysinfo, .cd, .download, .upload, or .ul). In version 2.0, the web shell embeds three URL paths to allow\nTropic Trooper to connect. The group also used their web shell backdoor URL path to fake the Trend\n\n\n-----\n\nMicro’s OfficeScan console URL. This technique is an attempt to bypass network detection in a target\nmachine. Lastly, Tropic Trooper shifts their command response from plain text to a png format — each\nresponse will be a png file that encrypts the web shell command results.\n\nSHA-256 : 83eca76156075cda86d931e4048170876c30264e42eabdf2098d303942061b9d\n\n**URL filters registered to HttpAddUrl API**\n```\nhttps=443/officescan/console/html/help/webhelp/_wh/user/resources/trend.png\nhttps=443/officescan/console/html/help/webhelp/_wh/user/resources/hpball.png\nhttps=443/officescan/console/html/help/webhelp/_wh/user/resources/asia.png\n\n```\nSHA-256 : 34449fe014c30ca50357a7993f237ae07427eee49b354c9d53188fb2a803a074\n\n**URL filters registered to HttpAddUrl API**\n```\nhttps=443/UIWeb/images/falcon.png\nhttps=443/UIWeb/images/icon.png\nhttps=443/UIWeb/images/tipc.png\n\n```\nFigure 48.

Use base64 to decode\n4. XOR the rest bytes with 0xBC\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 50. The png file response with bytes version\n\nHere we’re going to discuss the relationship between the backdoors. The first three backdoors can\nconnect to the same controller, and the help commands are almost the same. Connecting to those\nbackdoors with invisible web shells further helped us attribute them to Tropic Trooper threat actors: First,\nwe found the latest TROJ_YAHOYAH and invisible web shell in the same target network environment.\nSecond, the function of showing the target’s disk volume information is almost the same — not only for\nthe API call but the display information as well.\n\nFigure 51. How the backdoors (Welcome To IDShell, Hey! Welcome Server, and Welcome To Svchost) get disk\n\ninformation and display format\n\n\n-----\n\n## Potential targets and targeted information\n\nTropic Trooper seems to have been targeting air-gapped environments over the past six years;\nin particular, the group prefers to target military hospitals and national banks as initial footholds. It could\nbe difficult for some military and government offices to have sufficient security controls; protections can be\nchallenged and thus make incident response trickier.\n\nTropic Trooper is aware that main military or government agencies may have protection strategies in\nplace in physically isolated environments, such as the use of biometrics, secure USB for data transfers, or\nplugging the USB device into a quarantined machine before using it in a physically isolated environment.\nTherefore, Tropic Trooper chooses to target related organizations and use them as initial footholds. In this\ncase, we observed how Tropic Trooper actors successfully moved from a military hospital to the military’s\nphysically isolated network.\n\nWe observed Tropic Trooper’s targets to be the following:\n\n  - Military/Navy agencies\n\n  - Government institutions\n\n  - Military hospital\n\n  - National bank\n\nBased on data from the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ security infrastructure, we found that\nTropic Trooper tried to steal defense-related, ocean-related, and ship-related documents from the target\nnetworks. We believe that the group is interested in defense confidential information or technology and\nmarine-related confidential information or intelligence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n###### Tropic Trooper is an active cyberespionage group that has been operating since 2011. The latest\ndevelopments indicated that they are well-prepared to target Taiwanese government institutions and\nPhilippine military agencies in order to steal information related to defense- and marine-related\nintelligence. The group has also taken its time to monitor their targets and study their network\nenvironments in order to steal intelligence from physically isolated networks. We already observed the\ngroup targeting Taiwanese government institutions and Philippine military agencies. Furthermore, we also\nfound that the group tries to target other industries or companies that are related to military agencies or\nnational institutions as jump-off points for eventually infiltrating physically isolated networks. Related\norganizations, especially those with weak security measures in place, could serve as entry points for\notherwise strong network security measures of government institutions and military agencies.\n\nThis targeted attack operation can be broken down into four important points. First, putting critical data\nin physically isolated networks is not an overarching solution for preventing cyberespionage activities.\nSecond, their preferred technique of steganography isn’t just used to deliver payloads, but also for\nsending information back to the C&C server. Third, several hacking tools and components can be used to\nfulfill attacks in different target networks and environments. These tools and components also have a selfdelete command to make it tricky to trace the attack chain and all the related factors. Lastly, using an\ninvisible web shell hides their C&C server location and makes detecting malicious traffic more difficult for\nnetwork protection products.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis research underscores that facilitating a robust monitoring and command/order system is\nimportant. We often saw targets had difficulties taking sufficient control over their related\norganizations, which made the overall monitoring system weak and incident response difficult. We hope\nwe were able to shed light on the latest Tropic Trooper activities to help organizations take sufficient\nmeasures against this cyberespionage campaign.\n\n#### MITRE ATT&CK Matrix\n\nTactic Technique ID Description\n\n|Tactic|Technique|ID|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Initial Access|Replication Through Removable Media|T1091|Copies malware to removable media and infects other machines|\n||Trusted Relationship|T1199|Breaches the organizations who have access to intended victims|\n||Valid Accounts|T1078|Actor hardcodes victim username/password to infect internal computer|\n|Execution|Rundll32|T1085|Uses rundll32.exe for execution|\n||Scripting|T1064|Uses batch scripting to automate execution of commands|\n||User Execution|T1204|Lures victims to double-click on decoy files|\n|Persistence|Hidden Files and Directories|T1158|Sets its own executable file's attributes to hidden|\n||Registry Run Keys /|T1060|Adds itself to the Registry as a startup program|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Startup Folder|Col3|to establish persistence|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||Web Shell|T1100|Uses web shells to maintain access to victim network|\n|Privilege Escalation|Process Injection|T1055|Injects its DLL component into svchost.exe|\n||Web Shell|T1100|Uses web shells to maintain access to victim network|\n||Valid Accounts|T1078|Uses compromised credentials to log on to other systems|\n|Defense Evasion|Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information|T1140|Uses XOR and RC4 to perform decryption on C2 or encrypted files|\n||File Deletion|T1107|Loader after execution will delete itself|\n||Hidden Files and Directories|T1158|Sets its own executable file's attributes to hidden|\n||Process Hollowing|T1093|Decrypts the payload into memory, creates a new suspended process of itself, then injects a decrypted payload to the new process and resumes new process execution|\n||Scripting|T1064|Uses batch scripting to automate execution of commands|\n||Valid Accounts|T1078|Actor hardcodes victim username/password to infect internal computer|\n|Discovery|File and Directory Discovery|T1083|Uses “dir” to search for C:, D:, E: and F:|\n||Process Discovery|T1057|Gathers a list of running processes on the system using “tasklist”|\n||Permission Groups Discovery|T1069|Listed groups are “net view /domain” and “net view”|\n||System Information Discovery|T1082|Sends an OS version identifier in its beacons|\n||System Network Configuration Discovery|T1016|Uses the “ipconfig /all” command to gather network configuration information|\n||System Owner/User|T1033|Collects the username from the victim’s|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Discovery|Col3|machine|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Lateral Movement|Internal Spearphishing|T1534|Uses USB legitimate file name as internal spearphishing|\n||Remote File Copy|T1105|Downloads additional files and programs from its C2 server|\n||Windows Admin Shares|T1077|Connects to network shares using “net use”|\n||Replication Through Removable Media|T1091|Copies malware to removable media and infects other machines|\n|Collection|Automated Collection|T1119|Uses a batch script to perform a series of discovery techniques|\n||Data from Local System|T1005|Collects files from a local victim|\n||Data from Removable Media|T1025|Copies files with certain extensions from USB devices|\n||Data Staged|T1074|Stores files and logs in a folder on the local drive|\n|Command and Control|Commonly Used Port|T1043|Uses port 80/443/53 for C2 communications|\n||Communication Through Removable Media|T1092|Captures information from air-gapped computers via an infected USB|\n||Custom Command and Control Protocol|T1094|Communicates to the C2 server using a custom protocol|\n||Custom Cryptographic Protocol|T1024|Uses a custom encryption algorithm on data sent back to the C2 server|\n||Data Obfuscation|T1001|Uses steganography to hide malicious code downloaded to the victim|\n||Fallback Channels|T1008|Has three hard-coded IP/domains for C2 servers;
