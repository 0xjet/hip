Usually, the group’s attacks are not isolated\nincidents, and we can often relate them to earlier attacks by\ncarefully looking at both technical indicators and motives.\n\n\nJanuary 12, 2018\n\n\nPawn Storm has been attacking political organizations in\nFrance, Germany, Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, and the\nUnited States since 2015. We saw attacks against political\norganizations again in the second half of 2017. These\nattacks don’t show much technical innovation over time, but\nthey are well prepared, persistent, and often hard to defend against. Pawn Storm has a large\ntoolset full of social engineering tricks, malware and exploits, and therefore doesn’t need much\ninnovation apart from occasionally using their own zero-days and quickly abusing software\nvulnerabilities shortly after a security patch is released.\n\nIn summer and fall of 2017, we observed Pawn Storm targeting several organizations with\ncredential phishing and spear phishing attacks. Pawn Storm’s modus operandi is quite\nconsistent over the years, with some of their technical tricks being used repeatedly. For\n[example, tabnabbing was used against Yahoo! users in August and September 2017 in US](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-pawn-storm-putting-outlook-web-access-users-at-risk/)\npolitically themed email. The method, which we first discussed in 2014, involves changing a\nbrowser tab to point to a phishing site after distracting the target.\n\nWe can often closely relate current and old Pawn Storm campaigns using data that spans\nmore than four years, possibly because the actors in the group follow a script when setting up\nan attack. This makes sense, as the sheer volume of their attacks requires careful\nadministration, planning, and organization to succeed. The screenshots below show two\ntypical credential phishing emails that targeted specific organizations in October and November\n2017. One type of email is supposedly a message from the target’s Microsoft Exchange server\nabout an expired password. The other says there is a new file on the company’s OneDrive\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. A sample of a credential phishing email Pawn Storm sent in October and November_\n\n_2017_\n\n_Figure 2. Second type of credential phishing email that was sent by Pawn Storm in November_\n_2017. The logo of the target organization has been removed from the screenshot and the color_\n\n_was changed as not to reveal the source._\n\n\n-----\n\nis often the starting point of further attacks that include stealing sensitive data from email\ninboxes. We have worked with one of the targets, an NGO in the Netherlands targeted twice,\nin late October and early November 2017. We successfully prevented both attacks from\ncausing any harm. In one case we were able to warn the target within two hours after a\ndedicated credential phishing site was set up. In an earlier attack, we were able to warn the\norganization 24 hours before the actual phishing emails were sent.\n\n**_Olympic Wintersports Federations_**\n\nWe have seen several International Olympic Wintersport Federations, such as the European\nIce Hockey Federation, the International Ski Federation, the International Biathlon Union, the\nInternational Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation, among\nthe group’s targets in the second half of 2017. This is noteworthy due to the timing correlation\nbetween several Russian Olympic players being banned for life in fall, 2017. In 2016, Pawn\nStorm had some success in compromising WADA (the World Anti-Doping Agency) and TASCAS (the Court of Arbitration for Sport). At that time, Pawn Storm sought active contact with\nmainstream media either directly or via proxies and had influence on what some of them\npublished.\n\n**_Political targets_**\n\nIn the week of the 2017 presidential elections in Iran, Pawn Storm set up a phishing site\ntargeting chmail.ir webmail users. We were able to collect evidence that credential phishing\nemails were sent to chmail.ir users on May 18, 2017, just one day before the presidential\nelections in Iran. We have previously reported similar targeted activity against political\norganizations in France, Germany, Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States.\n\nBeginning in June 2017, phishing sites were set up mimicking the ADFS (Active Directory\nFederation Services) of the U.S. Senate. By looking at the digital fingerprints of these phishing\nsites and comparing them with a large data set that spans almost five years, we can uniquely\nrelate them to a couple of Pawn Storm incidents in 2016 and 2017. The real ADFS server of\nthe U.S. Senate is not reachable on the open internet, however phishing of users’ credentials\non an ADFS server that is behind a firewall still makes sense. In case an actor already has a\nfoothold in an organization after compromising one user account, credential phishing could\nhelp him get closer to high profile users of interest.\n\n**_The future of politically motivated campaigns_**\n\nRogue political influence campaigns are not likely to go away in the near future. Political\norganizations have to be able to communicate openly with their voters, the press and the\ngeneral public. This makes them vulnerable to hacking and spear phishing. On top of that, it’s\nalso relatively easy to influence public opinion via social media. Social media platforms\ncontinue to form a substantial part of users’ online experience, and they let advertisers reach\nconsumers with their message.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublishing stolen data together with spreading fake news and rumors on social media gives\nmalicious actors powerful tools. While a successful influence campaign might seem relatively\neasy to do, it needs a lot of planning, persistence, and resources to be successful. Some of\nthe basic tools and services, like ones used to spread fake news on social media, are already\nbeing offered as a service in the underground economy.\n\n[As we have mentioned in our overview paper on Pawn Storm, other actors may also start their](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/espionage-cyber-propaganda-two-years-of-pawn-storm)\nown campaigns that aim to influence politics and issues of interest domestically and abroad.\nActors from developing countries will learn and probably adapt similar methods quickly in the\n[near future. In 2016, we published a report on C Major, an espionage group that primarily](http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/Indian-military-personnel-targeted-by-information-theft-campaign-cmajor.pdf)\ntargets the Indian military. By digging deeper into C Major’s activities, we found that this actor\ngroup not only attacks the Indian military, but also has dedicated botnets for compromised\ntargets in Iranian universities, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Recently, we have witnessed C\nMajor also showing some interest in compromising military and diplomatic targets in the West.\nIt is only a matter of time before actors like C Major begin attempting to influence public\nopinion in foreign countries, as well.\n\nWith the Olympics and several significant global elections taking place in 2018, we can be sure\nPawn Storm’s activities will continue. We at Trend Micro will keep monitoring their targeted\nactivities, as well as activities of similar actors, as cyberpropaganda and digital extortion\nremain in use.\n\n**_Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):_**\n\nadfs[.]senate[.]group\nadfs-senate[.]email\nadfs-senate[.]services\nadfs.senate[.]qov[.]info\nchmail.ir[.]udelivered[.]tk\nwebmail-ibsf[.]org\nfil-luge[.]com\nbiathlovvorld[.]com\nmail-ibu[.]eu\nfisski[.]ca\niihf[.]eu\n\n\n-----",
