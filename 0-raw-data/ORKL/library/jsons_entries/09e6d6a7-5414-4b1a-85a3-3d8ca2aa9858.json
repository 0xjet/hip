[Blog](https://securityscorecard.com/blog)\n\n## TTPs Associated With a New Version of the BlackCat Ransomware\n\nVlad Pasca, Senior Malware & Threat Analyst\n\nPosted on September 6th, 2022\n\n## Executive summary\n\nThe BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware is a complex threat written in Rust that appeared in\nNovember 2021. In this post, we describe a real engagement that we recently handled by\ngiving details about the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat actor.\nFirstly, the attacker targeted an unpatched Microsoft Exchange server and successfully\ndropped webshells on the machine. After getting initial access, the ransomware installed the\nMobaXterm software and then started to dump the credentials using Mimikatz or by creating\nan LSASS dump file with Process Hacker. The SoftPerfect Network scanner was used to\nperform network discovery. Before running the ransomware executable, the TA compressed\nthe targeted files using WinRAR or 7zip and then exfiltrated them using rclone and\nMEGAsync.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) team was engaged in investigating a\nransomware infection. We were able to determine that the ransomware involved is a new\nversion of the BlackCat ransomware, based on the fact that the malware added new\ncommand line parameters that were not documented before.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the ransomware added a parameter called “--safeboot” that is used to\nreboot in Safe Mode. Whether the malware is running with the “--sleep-restart” parameter,\nthe process sleeps for a specified number of seconds and then restarts the machine.\n\n_Figure 1_\n\n[A complete analysis of the BlackCat ransomware can be found here.](https://securityscorecard.com/research/deep-dive-into-alphv-blackcat-ransomware)\n\nBy accessing the onion link specified in the ransom note called “RECOVER-<extension>FILES.txt”, the victim is presented with multiple tabs that contain information such as the\nransom amount in Bitcoin and Monero, the threat actor’s wallets addresses, a live chat, and\na trial decrypt that can be used to decrypt a few files for free (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2_\n\n## Initial access\n\nAccording to our analysis, the entry point in the organization was an Exchange server that\nwas vulnerable to Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. Multiple webshells have been identified\non the impacted server.\n\n## Remote access tools\n\nAfter gaining access to the internal network, the ransomware installed the legitimate tools\nMobaXterm and mottynew.exe (MobaXterm terminal).\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\nAs we already know from the malware analysis of the ransomware, BlackCat steals\ncredentials from the victim’s environment and incorporates them into its configuration\n(“credentials” field). Mimikatz was utilized to dump the credentials, and then the malware\npivots from one machine to another via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).\n\n\n-----\n\nAn old version of the SoftPerfect Network scanner was used to perform network scanning in\norder to discover additional targets in the local network. Figure 3 reveals the interface of the\nnetwork scanner:\n\n_Figure 3_\n\n## Data exfiltration\n\nOnce the threat actor decided which files to exfiltrate, the malware compressed them using\nWinRAR or 7zip. The ransomware installed a tool called rclone that is utilized to upload data\nto cloud storage providers. A second tool called MEGAsync is also installed by the process,\nwhich can upload data to the MEGA Cloud Storage.\n\nWe’ve also observed the ransomware installing tools such as FileZilla and WinSCP that\ncould be used to perform data exfiltration.\n\n## Other tools installed\n\nWe’ve investigated and found out that the ransomware installed the cURL tool to download\nadditional files. Process Hacker was also installed by the malware and could be used to\ndump the memory of the LSASS process. In the same directory with Process Hacker, the\nBlackCat ransomware dropped a copy of the PEView tool, which is a viewer for Portable\nExecutable (PE) files.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBlackCat ransomware remains a serious threat because it targets Windows hosts, Linux\nhosts, and VMWare ESXi. The access token that the malware is running with makes the\nautomated analysis impossible and increases the difficulty of the dynamic malware analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe usage of legitimate tools to perform malicious activities increases the chance of not\nbeing detected by endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software.\n\n## About SecurityScorecard\n\nSecurityScorecard offers a 360-degree approach to security prevention and response.
