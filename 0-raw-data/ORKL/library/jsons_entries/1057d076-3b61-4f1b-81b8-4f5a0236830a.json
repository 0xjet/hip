It comprises a diverse range of\ninstitutions, from elementary schools through to research organizations, and spans both the\npublic and private sectors. The industry has two critically important roles. The first is\nproviding education as a service, and in this role, the sector needs to be vigilant in the face\nof the ever-growing threat of eCrime. The second is in driving research and development,\nand the cultivation of new ideas — and in this role, the education industry has the potential to\nshape national economies and policy priorities, and ultimately support the power of the state.\nThis positions the academic industry as a priority target for state-sponsored — and to a\nlesser extent, hacktivist — threat actors.\n\nThe primary motivations for threat adversaries to target each of the sub-sectors of academia\nare outlined in the table below.\n\n**Nation-State** **eCrime** **Hacktivist**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Primary &**\n**Secondary**\n**Education**\n\n**Vocational**\n**& Higher-**\n**Level**\n**Education**\n\n**Research**\n**Entities**\n\n\n**X**\n\n**X** **X** **X**\n\n**X** **X** **X**\n\n\n**Motivations** **Espionage. Academic**\ninstitutions hold valuable\nintellectual property, making\nthem a target for nation-state\nespionage operations supporting\nnational research and\ndevelopment\nobjectives. Academic institutions\nalso play a pivotal role in policy\ndevelopment, and count many\ninfluential people among their\nstaff and alumni. This makes\nthem valuable sources\nfor intelligence collection\nobjectives.\n**Network Access. Nation-state**\nadversaries have leveraged\ncompromised academic networks\nfor operational infrastructure, and\nfor gaining additional access to\nassociated parties and networks,\ndue to the culture of open\nconnectivity often observed\nwithin academic environments.\n\n\n**Financial. The**\nacademic attack\nsurface is broad\nand complex, due\nto the nature of its\nusers and\noperations.\nCriminals exploit\nthe sector’s\nreliance on\ninformation\nsystems, using\nransomware and\ndata extortion to\nextract payments.\n\n\n**Ideology.**\nHacktivists may\nconduct\nDistributed Denial\nof Service (DDoS)\ncampaigns, data\nleaks, or web\ndefacements, or\nmay compromise\nsocial media\naccounts to\ndisrupt academic\nservices and/or\npublicly\nembarrass an\nentity.\n\n\n## What Did the Threat to Academia Look Like in 2020?\n\n\n-----\n\nActivity observed by CrowdStrike throughout 2020 reinforces that the academic industry\nfaces a serious and present threat from criminal and nation-state adversaries. Falcon\nOverWatch™ observed a more than fourfold increase in intrusions against the academic and\neducation industries compared to 2019. This increase is driven in large part by eCrime\nactivity, which has accounted for 82% of activity uncovered by Falcon OverWatch in the\neducation and academic industries this year.\n\nSince mid-August 2020, there has been a notable increase in adversaries targeting\nacademia, primarily pursuing big game hunting (BGH) operations against these institutions.\n[BGH adversaries are deploying enterprise-wide ransomware, using both data encryption and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/what-is-ransomware/)\nextortion to coerce victims into paying large ransoms. A similar period of ransomware activity\ntargeting academic entities was witnessed a year earlier in September 2019. The timing of\nthe new operations coincided with the start of the new academic year for many education\ninstitutions in the U.S. and U.K. This year, the threat of disruptions looms larger, as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to move lessons online. With eLearning\nbecoming the new normal, disruptions could have a significant impact on the ability to\nprovide learning, making the opportunity that much more tantalizing for eCrime adversaries.\n\nThrough 2020, both CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon OverWatch also observed nationstate activity targeting schools and universities. Nation-state actors are often highly skilled,\nwell-resourced and have the luxury of time to conduct exhaustive reconnaissance against\ntheir intended victims. This allows the adversary to collect sensitive information about their\nvictim to help craft more genuine social engineering campaigns with a greater chance of\neliciting a victim response.\n\nA particularly pertinent example of nation-state activity against the academic industry has\nbeen the ongoing targeting of universities and research institutions involved in COVID-19\nresearch. Since April 2020, intrusion activity targeting coronavirus research has been\nreported against U.S., U.K, Spanish, South Korean, Japanese and Australian laboratories;\nthis activity was conducted on the part of Russian, Iranian, Chinese and North Korean\nactors.\n\nIn one such example from the second half of 2020, Falcon OverWatch uncovered a targeted\nintrusion against an academic institution known to be involved in the development of COVID19 testing capabilities. The malicious activity in question was attributed to a China-nexus\nactor, which gained initial access by way of a successful SQL injection attack against a\nvulnerable web server. Once inside the victim environment, the actor compiled and launched\na web shell that was used to perform various malicious activities largely focused on\ninformation gathering and collection. Notably, the actor’s activities included the enumeration\nof a particular directory housing health-related files and data, suggesting the actor likely\nknew what they were looking for. With the extensive research and development that\ncontinues to surround the COVID-19 pandemic, Falcon OverWatch continues to observe\nstate-sponsored actors displaying a keen interest in academic institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, even when academia is not the ultimate target for nation-state actors, it can still\nbe a valuable intermediate target to support broader intelligence objectives — including\npolitical, national security and economic espionage. For reasons explored next, nation-state\nadversaries may view the academic sector as a soft target for initial access for future\noperations against other associated sectors.\n\nAlthough large-scale hacktivism efforts have decreased over the past couple of years,\nhacktivist groups are assessed to present a low to moderate threat to the academic sector. A\nhistoric look at hacktivism targeting academia suggests these actors are opportunistically\nand intermittently targeting educational institutions in line with certain nationalist and\nideological dogmas.\n\n### The Who’s Who of the Academia Threat Landscape\n\nAs of this writing, CrowdStrike is tracking 150 threat actors across nation-state, eCrime and\nhacktivist motivations, 40 of which have a history of attacking academic institutions.\n\n25 of these adversaries are nation-state threat actors\n11 are sophisticated criminal syndicates\n4 are hacktivists\n\nCriminal activity accounts for the vast majority of intrusion activity, with groups such as\nDOPPEL SPIDER, RIDDLE SPIDER, CIRCUS SPIDER, TWISTED SPIDER, PINCHY\nSPIDER, WIZARD SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER being most active. Criminal activity across\nthe globe is up 330% in 2020 compared to 2019, while nation-state attacks remain steady.\nAdversaries such as VELVET CHOLLIMA, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, BERSERK BEAR,\nSTATIC KITTEN, WICKED PANDA and KRYPTONITE PANDA account for multiple\noperations throughout the year.\n\n## What Are the Risks for the Academic Industry?\n\n### 1. The Tyranny of Many Endpoints\n\nMany academic institutions have a wide attack surface relative to other organizations. In the\nearly days of the internet, academic-sector networks were specifically designed to foster\ncollaboration between globally separated research teams. This focus on accessibility means\nthat many organizations still feature “bring your own device” (BYOD) policies to cater to\nstudents and independently operated enclaves. An example of this could be a research lab\nmaintaining their own servers outside the administration of an IT department for the sake of\nsensitive analysis. BYOD setups have also been a key feature of eLearning for schools and\nuniversities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n-----\n\nDefenders should be aware that Falcon OverWatch regularly observes adversaries\nleveraging malware-free or fileless techniques. Accordingly, academic institutions are in the\nprecarious position of having to defend against ever-increasing threats deliberately hidden\namongst the benign. State-sponsored and criminal actors continue to live off the land, using\ncompromised credentials in conjunction with trusted utilities often natively available on the\nhost operating system to conduct their actions on objectives. A deterioration in basic security\nhygiene practices including unpatched external resources and exposed services is often the\ncatalyst for actors gaining initial access, and in many cases a malicious payload or the\nabsence of obvious malware proves challenging for those institutions reliant on traditional AV\nor technology-based controls. The continued proliferation of malicious activity that blends in\nas legitimate administrative behavior warrants institutions to adopt a mix of technology and\nhuman-led hunting services to counter the ever-increasing threat.\n\n### 2. Higher-risk Users Present Challenges\n\nAcademic institutions are more likely than organizations in any other industry to have a broad\ncross-section of users accessing their networks. With staff and students accessing academic\nnetworks, there is a wide range of ages, skills levels and online behavior to contend with.\nFurther, rolling out regular security awareness training, and ensuring compliance across such\na wide user base, is uniquely challenging. Adversaries are well aware that users can be the\nweak point in an academic institution’s defenses, making them an attractive target for both\ncriminal and state-sponsored intrusions.\n\n### 3. Dispersed Networks Constrain Effective Oversight\n\nDue to nature in which academic institutions share information, there is a general culture of\nopen connectivity with few security controls deployed at these interconnection points. The\nacademic sector operates as a nexus of information and access for numerous additional\nsectors, creating a tantalizing prospect for threat adversaries. If a compromise occurs, it may\ncause ripple effects across multiple other verticals within a targeted region or country.\n\nAfter finding their way into academic networks, actors turn their attention to discovery, often\nconducting extensive reconnaissance to identify additional resources within their reach. It is\nalso common to see adversaries leveraging collections of compromised credentials in\nconjunction with RDP, various native and readily available file retrieval and transfer utilities,\nand network shares to move laterally between hosts in search of valuable information to\nsupport their objectives.\n\nThe aforementioned credentials are also combined with the use of various common\ncommand-line remote access tools including SSH and telnet to establish persistent access.\nIn recent activity, Falcon OverWatch has also noted the use of alternate methods for\npreserving remote access such as the deployment and subsequent use of VPN clients, as\nwell as legitimate remote administration utilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4. Widely Available Open Source Information Feeds Social Engineering Campaigns\n\nStudents, research fellows and professors eager to share their own research may also have\ntheir own websites outside of university networks. Although they may not be directly linked\nwith the university, the association still exists. Often, these sites are mined for details\nsupporting threat actor reconnaissance, later used for social engineering and phishing\ncampaigns.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nAlthough these threat adversaries are often highly sophisticated and can leverage complex\ntooling in their operations, defending against these attacks is not a lost cause. There are\nmany security and intelligence solutions available to assist organizations in better\nunderstanding the threat adversaries, their TTPs and the tradecraft they regularly employ. In\nmany cases, it is more important to have visibility as opposed to assuming security\ntechnologies alone will be capable of preventing attacks. Here is a list of some high-level\nrecommendations:\n\n**Sensor Coverage. You can’t stop what you don’t see. Organizations should deploy**\ncapabilities that provide their defenders with full visibility across their environment, to\navoid blind spots that can become a safe haven for adversaries.\n**Technical Intelligence. Leverage technical intelligence, such as indicators of**\ncompromise (IOCs), and consume them into a security information and event manager\n(SIEM) for data enrichment purposes. This allows for added intelligence when\nconducting event correlation, potentially highlighting events on the network that may\nhave otherwise gone undetected. Implementing high-fidelity IOCs across multiple\nsecurity technologies increases much-needed situational awareness.\n**Threat Intelligence. Consuming narrative threat intelligence reports is a sure-fire**\nmethod for painting a very vivid picture of threat actor behavior, the tools they leverage\nand the tradecraft they employ. [Threat intelligence assists with threat actor profiling,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/threat-intelligence/)\ncampaign tracking and malware family tracking. These days, it is more important to\nunderstand the context of an attack rather than just knowing an attack itself happened,\nand this is where threat intelligence plays a vital role.\n**Threat Hunting. Understanding technology will only get organizations so far is more**\nimportant now than ever before. Security technologies are not 100%, and\nunderstanding technology is not infallible is the first step in coming to grips with the\n[need for 24/7, managed, human-based threat hunting.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/threat-hunting/)\n**Service Provider. Partnering with a best-of-breed service provider is a necessity.**\nShould the unthinkable happen, organizations may require assistance responding to\nsophisticated threats.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdopting even just one of these recommendations will go a long way in assisting\norganizations in strengthening the security strategy. The combination of all — or at least\nmany — of these recommendations greatly enhances an organization’s ability to defend and\ndetect these threats with the goal of stopping a breach from occurring.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDue to the current environment, specifically as it relates to COVID-19, there is no\nexpectation of threat activity slowing down in the nearterm. COVID-19 has introduced\nadditional complexity into academia with remote schooling. The various vaccine research\nand development projects underway at academic institutions across the globe also make for\nattractive targeting. Criminals will continue to leverage ransomware as a means to disrupt\nacademic networks, pressuring schools and universities into paying in order to restore\noperations as soon as possible. Additionally, nation-state actors will continue to target\nacademia as a means of supplementing various intelligence-collection objectives primarily\ncentered around political and economic espionage.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Learn about recent intrusion trends, adversary tactics and highlights of notable_\n_intrusions identified by the CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch team in our_ _2020 Threat_\n_Hunting Report._\n_Read more about threat hunting in this blog, “Successful Threat Hunting Starts with a_\n_SEARCH.”_\n_Read this analysis about a recent supply chain attack, “SUNSPOT: An Implant in the_\n_Build Process.”_\n_To learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security_\n_strategy, visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself:_ _[Start your free trial of Falcon Prevent.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n\n\n-----",
