The email contained a malicious Microsoft Excel document\nwhich drops a malicious Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) providing the actor with CMD reverse shell over\nHTTP. The DLL shares code similarities to exile-RAT, a tool associated with Pirate Panda. Pirate Panda\nis an APT backed by China and known for targeting government and political organisations.\n\nPirate Panda has reportedly focused primarily on issues surrounding territorial conflicts in the South\nChina Sea [1]. As Da Nang lies on the Coast of Vietnam, opposite the Paracel Islands (an area of\nterritorial dispute), this may provide some understanding of why Pirate Panda would consider targeting\nthis municipality. [2]\n\n\nThe phishing email and lure document observed suggest that the employees targeted likely work within\na government-run data center. Such attacks are consistent with other regional APT campaigns [3]. If\nPirate Panda were to compromise a government-run data center, it would have access to vast amounts\nof sensitive information.\n\n## Targeted Phishing\n\nIn the screenshot below, the phishing email shown was sent by a government employee to another\ngovernment employee. The intended victim had a “danang.gov.vn” appended to the email address, as\nseen in the email headers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1, Phishing email_\n\nThe subject header is “Cập nhật lịch trực lễ 30/4 và ⅕,” which Google translates as “Updated live\nschedule 30_4 and 1_5.eml.” The live schedule appeared to be for the dates of April 30 and May 1,\nwhich may indicate that the lure theme was related to events on those days. As both 30 April and 1 May\nare Vietnamese national holidays, it is plausible the theme related to those events, although we cannot\nconfirm that hypothesis based on available data.\n\n30 April is “Reunification Day,” marking the unification between North and South Vietnam in 1975\nMay is Vietnam’s national “Labour Day” holiday, which has political associations with communism\nand the working class\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2, Email header for phishing sample_\n\nWe assess that the phishing email likely came from a genuine internal mailbox, as Microsoft Exchange\ncategorised it as “Internal” and the IP address in the email header 10.196.132.154 was from an internal\nprivate network. If the originating email account was associated with a real employee, that employee\nwas likely compromised previously, or they are conducting internal pentesting.\n\nAn open-source search of both email addresses only located information about the victim email address\nin an online spreadsheet titled “Công viên phần mềm Đà Nẵng,” which Google translates to “Da Nang\nSoftware Park.” We were unable to determine what if any link exists between the government employees\nlisted and the park. The spreadsheet contained email addresses, telephone numbers and possible job\ntitles for Da Nang government employees, with the victim’s job title translating to “Expert”. The\n\n\n-----\n\nspreadsheet was hosted on dsp.vn, a government-owned site that described the Da Nang IT\nInfrastructure Development Center as having been established under the People's Committee of Da\nNang City, a non-business unit under the Department of Information and Danang media. [4]\n\n_Figure 3, location of Da Nang_\n\nDa Nang lies on the coast across from the Paracel Islands, an area of territorial dispute [5]. in March\n2020, the USS Theodore Roosevelt visited the port of Da Nang to commemorate the relationship\nbetween Vietnam and the United States [6]. According to press reporting, ”Washington has placed a high\npriority on improving its defense ties with Vietnam recently as part of President Donald Trump’s National\nDefense Strategy, which prioritizes strategic competition with China and countering its growing military\ncapabilities in Asia.” [7]\n\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in naval activity in the South China Sea,\nincluding the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and US Navy ships patrolling the area; indications of\nongoing regional tensions.\n\n## Malicious Excel Document\n\nThe phishing email contains an attachment called “lich truc li,” which translates as “office schedule.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4, Screenshot of the malicious excel document_\n\nThe spreadsheet contained a table with three titles “bảng phân công trực trung tâm dữ liệu,” which\ntranslates as “Data Center assignment table,” “TRUNG TÂM PHÁT TRIỂN HẠ TẦNG ĐA NĂNG,” which\ntranslates as “Multi-infrastructure development center,” and “phòng hệ thống,” which translates as\n“system room.” This may support a hypothesis that the government employees work in a data center in\nthe Da Nang Software Park. This spreadsheet is likely an employee schedule. Column B appears to hold\nemployee names, whilst C & D correspond with shift patterns laid out in rows 19-24. An open-source\nsearch suggests that the acronyms \"“TC1,” “TC2,” and “TC3” may refer to technology centers.\n\nWhen the Excel document is opened, two executables (utilman.exe and mpsvc.dll) will be dropped at\nfolder %AppData%MicrosoftCorporation. Utilman.exe is Windows Defender executable MsMpeng.exe.\nThe attacker is employing a DLL Side-Loading technique using a legitimate security product to load a\nmalicious dll [8]. This is a common technique for a variety of threat actors and groups. A shortcut for\nutilman.exe is then created at the startup folder so that the dropped files execute during the next reboot\nof the machine and communicate with a command and control (C2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5, process graph_\n\nMpsvc.dll initially makes a number of DNS requests to “dns.google” (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) which is\nGoogle’s public DNS service. The domain name resolved as skypechatvideo[.]online.\n\n_Figure 6, pcap file for mpsvc.dll_\n\nAfter communicating to Google DNS, the victim machine communicates with the C2\nskypechatvideo[.]online and sends the following GET request:\n\nhttp://skypechatvideo[.]online/wwwlib/title.php?\nID=NzhERjJFQjgtNDk5RC03ODQ0LTlCNzctM0U2QUVBREYyNEU4:U1Q=\n\nThe C2 was hosted on an Apache server running PHP, and communicated with the victim machine over\nport 49927. The domain skypechatvideo[.]online, which was registered at IP address 185.244.150[.]4 on\nApril 20, 2020 with Registrar NameSilo, was using a privacy service that obfuscated the registrant\ninformation. Additionally, according to RiskIQ, only one other domain hosted on the IP address\n185.244.150[.]4: onlinedocumentviewer[.]us which was first seen in July 2018. The small number of\ndomains suggests the infrastructure is owned rather than shared, and the long period between the\ndomains makes the relationship between them questionable.\n\nThe dropped executable mpsvc.dll, although containing a large quantity of unique code, was genetically\nsimilar to exile-RAT and keyboy; both are RATs Pirate Panda deploys. It is likely that the threat actors\nmodified and developed the code since it was last used. The dll has a compilation date of 22 April 2020,\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich is two days after the c2 domain was registered, and the phishing email was sent on 27 April 2020.\nexile-RAT has been observed using the same DLL Sideloading technique, using a legitimate security\nproduct to load a malicious dll. In this instance, Windows Defender is being used.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe phishing email and the lure document suggest that the attack was crafted to target government\nemployees working at a data centre, which is consistent with previous data center targeting by other\ncampaigns attributed to APTs [9]. If the phishing email was sent by a real employee, it is possible that\nmembers of the Da Nang government have already been compromised, but were not the targets of\ninterest or didn't have the required access to desired information. It is possible that the national holidays\nare being used as a lure, because the threat actors may have an imminent desire for lateral movement\nand access to data. While Anomali has not been able to figure out what information the threat actors are\nattempting to obtain, if an attacker were to compromise a government-run data center, it would have\naccess to vast amounts of sensitive information.
