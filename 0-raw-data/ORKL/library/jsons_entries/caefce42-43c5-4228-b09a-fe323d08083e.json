The malware\nwas seen on a few dozen systems in a limited number of organizations.\n\n[\"CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarity with #HermeticWiper,](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HermeticWiper?src=hashtag_click)\n[#IsaacWiper, or any other malware known to us,\" ESET said in a tweet.](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IsaacWiper?src=hashtag_click)\n\ntwitter\n\nESET said the attackers had prior control of the target's network beforehand.\n\n\"Interestingly, CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers. This is probably a\nway for the attackers to keep their access inside the organization while still disturbing\noperations,\" the company said.\n\n## Disk-wiping malware\n\n[Security researchers at Symantec and](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia) [ESET first observed the wiper malware in February.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/)\nAccording to a blog post by Symantec, attackers deployed a disk-wiping malware\n(Trojan Killdisk) shortly before Russian forces crossed the Ukrainian border\n\n\n-----\n\nThe wiper contains driver files that eventually damage the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the\ninfected computer, rendering it inoperable.\n\nAccording to [Crowdstrike, the attackers misused legitimate EaseUS Partition Master drivers](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-crowdstrike-falcon-protects-against-wiper-malware-used-in-ukraine-attacks/)\nto gain raw disk access and manipulate the disk to make the system inoperable.\n\nThe wiper was dubbed HermeticWiper since the malware's certificate was issued to\nHermetica Digital Ltd., a legitimate Cyprus-based company. Other researchers named the\nnovel malware 'DriveSlayer.'\n\n[CISA released an advisory on the malware that targeted organizations in Ukraine, with](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-057a)\nrecommendations and strategies to prepare for and respond to the threat.\n\n## More from Cybernews:\n\n[Open database leaves major Chinese ports exposed to shipping chaos](https://cybernews.com/security/open-database-leaves-major-chinese-ports-exposed-to-shipping-chaos/)\n\n[The Iron Curtain: which IT-related services got blocked or left the Russian market?](https://cybernews.com/editorial/the-iron-curtain-which-it-related-services-got-blocked-or-left-the-russian-market/)\n\n[Underworld trends: criminals adopt DDoS attacks for extortion - report](https://cybernews.com/news/underworld-trends-criminals-adopt-ddos-attacks-for-extortion-report/)\n\n[89% of global cyberattacks are aimed at Russia or Ukraine](https://cybernews.com/cyber-war/89-of-global-cyberattacks-are-aimed-at-russia-or-ukraine/)\n\n[Subscribe to our newsletter](https://cybernews.com/newsletter/)\n\n\n-----",
