No spearphishing,\n[either: The cybercriminal group tied to numerous payment card breaches including Goodwill](http://www.darkreading.com/backoff-not-to-blame-for-goodwill-breach/d/d-id/1306963)\nand best known by its so-called \"RawPOS\" malware employed legitimate user credentials to\naccess its targets' networks.\n\nResearchers at FireEye here today shared their recent findings on this prolific and long[running cybercrime gang that has been the subject of multiple Visa security alerts to](http://monerisusa.com/support/~/media/pdf/Alert-RawPOS-032015.ashx)\nmerchants. The RawPOS memory scraper malware has been infecting the lodging industry\nin epidemic proportions over the past year, and is considered one of the first memory\nscrapers to target point-of-sale systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye has dubbed the cybercrime gang FIN5. One of the most unique things about FIN5\nis that in every intrusion we responded to where FIN5 has been active, legitimate access\nwas identified. They had valid user credentials to remotely log into the network,\" said Barry\nVengerik, principal threat analyst at FireEye. \"No sexy zero-days, no remote exploits -- not\neven spearphishing. They had credentials from somewhere.\"\n\nFIN5, which earlier this year was profiled by researchers at Trend Micro and has been in\naction since at least 2008, uses real credentials from the victim organization's virtual private\nnetwork, Remote Desktop Protocol, Citrix, or VNC. Vengerik says the attackers got those\ncredentials via third parties associated with the victims' POS systems.\n\n\"Most of the maintenance and administration of POS systems are done by a third party -- the\nmaintenance, patching, troubleshooting\" is done remotely via those credentials, he said.\n\n\"FIN5 maintained access to two or more payment processor networks primarily for the goal\nof logging into and accessing their customers' environments,\" he said. \"It's a textbook case of\na lateral compromise between companies based on trust.\"\n\nFireEye last year investigated a massive breach at a casino hotel with 1,200 endpoints that\nsuffered losses to more than 150,000 payment cards. Vengerik declined to name the hotel.\n\nThe casino attackers used a stolen VPN account to gain access, said Emmanuel JeanGeorges, senior consultant with FireEye's Mandiant.\n\nFIN5 uses a tool called GET2 Penetrator, a brute force scanning tool that looks for remote\nlogin and hard-coded credentials, as well as a free tool called EssentialNet that scans the\nvictim's network to give the attackers \"the lay of the land,\" Vengerik said.\n\nRawPOS pulls information from a POS system's memory. The malware includes several\ncomponents, FireEye found: Duebrew, which ensures the malware remains on the infected\nWindows machine, even when it gets rebooted; Fiendcry, a memory scraper that grabs the\npayment card data; Driftwood, which encodes the stolen payment card information to hide it\nfrom analysis tools.\n\nAnother unusual feature of FIN5's operation is that the malware code is \"well-commented,\"\nVengerik said. \"That's incredibly rare in malware, the author taking time to comment on the\ncode and to show what section of code is doing what,\" he said. It's like a secure\ndevelopment lifecycle approach, he noted.\n\nThe release notes for the Driftwood code are written in an older Russian language character\nset, the researchers showed.\n\nWhy would the malware author actively comment on the code? \"It points to a possible\necosystem -- for advertising or support\" of the malware as a product, Vengerik told Dark\n_Reading._\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye says the attackers first target the Active Directory to get to the card data, and use\ntools such as Windows Credentials Editor in their quest for legit credentials. They also\ncreated several custom tools for covering their tracks and cleaning up any traces of the\nmalware, as well as proxy tools for accessing segregated network segments.\n\n\"They also encoded hard kill-times into most of their malware for a hard end date\" of the\nattack, he said.\n\nTrend Micro earlier this year noted how RawPOS was able to evolve to target various types\nof POS software. \"Aside from being multi-component, RawPOS is notable for its support for\nmultiple PoS software. Since business establishments would have different PoS software,\nattackers have modified RawPOS’ code to support multiple PoS software over time,\" Trend\n[Micro researchers wrote in a blog post in late April.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rawpos-checking-in-at-a-hotel-near-you/)\n\nMeanwhile, FireEye today also announced that is has partnered with Visa Inc. to power a\nnew threat intelligence service for merchants and card issuers. The so-called Visa Threat\nIntelligence service is the first product under a newly forged partnership between Visa and\nFireEye.\n\n\"We want to offer faster, actionable intelligence to our constituents,\" said Mark Nelson, senior\nvice president of risk products at Visa.\n\n[Vulnerabilities/ThreatsThreat Intelligence](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats)\n\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly-discovered vulnerabilities, data breach\ninformation, and emerging trends.
