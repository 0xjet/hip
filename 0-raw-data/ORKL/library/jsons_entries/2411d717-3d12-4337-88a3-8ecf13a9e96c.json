Insikt Group**\nThe group has used LNK files and MSC **traffic to threat actor-controlled** identified ten IP addresses in Henan\nfiles as the first-stage components **C2 servers. This enables RedDelta** province used by RedDelta to\nand ultimately loaded PlugX via search to blend in with legitimate traffic and administer its PlugX C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was December 6, 2024._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nBetween July 2023 and December 2024, Insikt Group observed the Chinese state-sponsored threat\nactivity group RedDelta primarily targeting Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with1\n\nan adapted infection chain to distribute their customized PlugX backdoor. The group used lure\ndocuments themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou (郭台銘), the\nVietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. Insikt Group observed evidence that the\nMongolian Ministry of Defense was likely compromised in August 2024 and that the Communist Party\nof Vietnam was compromised in November 2024. RedDelta conducted spearphishing targeting the\nVietnamese Ministry of Public Security; however, there were no indications of a successful\ncompromise. Additionally, from September to December 2024, Insikt Group identified likely victims in\nMalaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.\n\nIn the latter half of 2023, RedDelta evolved the initial part of its infection chain to leverage a Windows\nshortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing, which downloaded and installed a remotely hosted\nWindows Installer (MSI) file. This MSI file then dropped a search order hijacking triad that loaded PlugX,\nas seen in previous RedDelta activity. In 2024, Insikt Group observed the group shift from using LNK\nfiles to Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files as the first stage component. Most\nrecently, the group shifted to using a spearphishing link to get the victim to load an HTML file remotely\nhosted on Microsoft Azure, which started the remainder of the infection chain.\n\nSince July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content delivery network (CDN) service\nto proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic to threat actor-controlled C2 servers. This enables the\ngroup to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification for security\n[researchers. Recently, Insikt Group has observed multiple state-sponsored groups leveraging](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/bluealpha-abuses-cloudflare-tunneling-service)\nCloudflare to evade detection, including the Russian state-sponsored group BlueAlpha.\n\nRedDelta continues to operate in line with Chinese strategic priorities. The group has historically\ntargeted governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The\nAsia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the group’s historical focus after\n[targeting European organizations in 2022 following the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. RedDelta’s](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant)\ntargeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the group’s past [targeting of groups seen as](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf?)\nthreatening to the Chinese Communist Party’s power, including Mongolian non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs), the Vatican, and Catholic organizations in Hong Kong.\n\n1 RedDelta closely overlaps with public reporting under the aliases BRONZE PRESIDENT, Mustang Panda, Stately Taurus, Earth Preta, Red Lich,\nTA416, HoneyMyte, Twill Typhoon, Vertigo Panda, and Dark Peony.\n\n1 CTA-CN-2025-0109 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nInsikt Group followed responsible disclosure in advance of this publication per Recorded Future's\nprenotification policy.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - Since July 2023, RedDelta targeted Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with its\ncustomized backdoor PlugX.\n\n  - RedDelta has evolved its infection chain multiple times since mid-2023. The group has used LNK\nfiles and MSC files as the first-stage components. In both cases, a PowerShell command\ndownloaded and installed a remotely hosted Windows Installer (MSI) file. This MSI file dropped a\nmalicious dynamic-link library (DLL) loader written in the Nim programming language, a\nlegitimate binary vulnerable to search order hijacking, and an encrypted payload that ultimately\nloads PlugX.\n\n  - The group has consistently registered new domains that use the Cloudflare content delivery\nnetwork (CDN) to proxy C2 traffic to the group’s backend threat actor-controlled virtual private\nservers (VPSs).\n\n  - Insikt Group identified IP addresses in Henan province used by RedDelta to administer its PlugX\nC2 servers, pointing to a potential threat actor operating location.\n\n## Background\n\n[RedDelta has been active since](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-attacks-se-asian-government/) [at least 2012 and has focused on Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos)\ngroup has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. For instance,\n[RedDelta targeted](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf) [the Vatican and other](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations) Catholic organizations with PlugX in the lead-up to 2021 talks\n[between China and the Vatican. The group has also compromised law enforcement and government](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations)\nentities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong\nKong, and Australia.\n\n[In 2022, the group shifted toward increased targeting](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant) of European government and diplomatic entities\nfollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an\narchive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), likely via spearphishing that contained a Windows shortcut (LNK) file\ndisguised using a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. The archive file also\n##### featured a series of nested hidden folders containing three files used to complete DLL search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that iwas ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the shortcut file led to the execution of the legitimate binary\nvulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, Insikt Group observed an evolution in\ntactics, in which RedDelta staged the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.\n\nIn March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that\nstarted with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order\nhijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. The campaign used a decoy document\n\n2 CTA-CN-2025-0109 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nmasquerading as an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document purporting to be\na BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted the following groups\nand individuals:\n\n  - Members of multiple Mongolian NGOs, including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO\nfocused on the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in China\n\n  - Multiple Mongolian Buddhist activists based in Mongolia and Japan\n\n  - Academic professionals in Mongolia and Japan\n\n  - The developers of two separate Mongolian mobile applications\n\n## Threat and Technical Analysis\n\n**_Figure 1: Timeline of RedDelta activity from 2023 and 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n#### Cloudflare CDN Used to Proxy Command-and-Control Traffic\n\nBeginning in July 2023, Insikt Group observed a shift across RedDelta command-and-control (C2)\ninfrastructure characterized by the addition of [Cloudflare Origin CA transport layer security (TLS)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/)\n[certificates on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 443. This shift is indicative of the group’s use](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/)\nof the Cloudflare CDN service to proxy C2 traffic to these backend threat actor-controlled servers in an\nattempt to blend in among benign CDN traffic. In all cases, the domain configured to use the Cloudflare\nCDN service is visible via the subject alternative names (SANs) field on the accompanying TLS\ncertificate on these backend C2s. By analyzing Cloudflare Origin CA certificates served by known\nRedDelta C2 servers, Insikt Group identified over 100 threat actor-controlled domains (see Appendix\n**A). Almost all domains are likely formerly legitimate domains re-registered via Namecheap or NameSilo**\nby the threat actor after expiry, likely to evade domain age and trust heuristics. In May 2024, Insikt\nGroup identified RedDelta using Cloudflare's geofencing capabilities for the first time to restrict the\ndownloading of the latter stages of the group’s infection chain to IP addresses geolocating to Myanmar.\n\n3 CTA-CN-2025-0109 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nRedDelta continues leveraging these capabilities, including geofencing a malicious MSC file to Vietnam\nin August 2024.\n\n#### New Infection Chain Leveraging Windows Shortcut (LNK) and Windows Installer (MSI) Files Used to Continue Targeting Mongolia (July 2023)\n\nIn July 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia with a new infection chain to load the\ngroup’s customized PlugX backdoor. In this campaign, the group shifted tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) by adopting a new infection chain and using the Cloudflare CDN service to proxy C2\ntraffic to threat actor-controlled C2 servers. In this case, the group used a Windows LNK file to run a\nPowerShell command, which downloaded and installed a remotely hosted Windows installer (MSI) file.\nThis MSI file then dropped a legitimate executable, a malicious loader DLL written in the Nim\nprogramming language, and an encrypted payload that ultimately loaded the group’s customized PlugX\nbackdoor via DLL search order hijacking (see Figure 2).\n\n**_Figure 2: RedDelta infection chain observed in Mongolia targeting from July 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n4 CTA-CN-2025-0109 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nInsikt Group identified three files observed communicating with RedDelta servers at the time (Table 1).\n\n**SHA256** **Filename(s)** **Contacted IP Address or Domain**\n\na0a3eeb6973f12fe61e6e90fe5fe8e406 Үер усны estmongolia[.]com\na8e00b31b1511a0dfe9a88109d0d129 сэрэмжлүүлэг.lnk\n\n471e61015ff18349f4bf357447597a545 Үер усны mongolianshipregistrar[.]com\n79839336188d98d299b14cff458d132 сэрэмжлүүлэг.msi\n\n7c741c8bcd19990140f3fa4aa95bb1959 AdobePlugin.msi 103.107.104[.]37\n29c9429fc47f95cf4ab9fad03040f7b\n\n**_Table 1: Observed files communicating with RedDelta servers in July 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThe LNK file Үер усны сэрэмжлүүлэг.lnk (translation from Mongolian: Flood warning.lnk)\nshown in Table 1 ran a PowerShell command shown in Figure 3 to retrieve a remotely hosted MSI file\nfrom the RedDelta domain estmongolia[.]com and install it using the install.InstallProduct\nmethod.\n\n**_Figure 3: PowerShell command run by shortcut file Үер усны сэрэмжлүүлэг.lnk (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThe retrieved file is Үер усны сэрэмжлүүлэг.msi in Table 1, which dropped three files following\ninstallation into the newly created folder C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\GkyOpucv:\n\n  - A legitimate executable: ONENOTEM.exe (sha256:\nb9836265c6bfa17cd5e0265f32cedb1ced3b98e85990d000dc8e1298d5d25f93)\n\n  - A malicious loader DLL: msi.dll (sha256:\n67c23db357588489031700ea8c7dc502a6081d7d1a620c03b82a8f281aa6bde6)\n\n  - An encrypted payload: NoteLogger.dat\n(sha256: 0df7e56610adad2ed5adfdfab07faedc08a61d9f944a5448aa62e071cffc28c4)\n\nThe ONENOTEM.exe file executed the msi.dll via DLL search order hijacking, which then decrypted\n```\nNoteLogger.dat to load the group’s customized PlugX variant into memory.

The group used decoy documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential\nelection and a residential renovation project in Taiwan’s capital, Taipei.\n\n##### Taiwanese Presidential Election-Themed Sample\n\nThe first sample was an MSI file (sha256:\nc7ec098093eb08d2b36d1c37b928d716d8da021f93319a093808a7ceb3b35dc1), which dropped three\nfiles following execution:\n\n  - A legitimate executable: ONENOTEM.exe (sha256:\nb9836265c6bfa17cd5e0265f32cedb1ced3b98e85990d000dc8e1298d5d25f93)\n\n  - A malicious loader DLL: msi.dll (sha256:\n651c096cf7043a01d939dff9ba58e4d69f15b2244c71b43bedb4ada8c37e8859)\n\n  - An encrypted payload: NoteLogger.dat\n(sha256: 908ff3a80ef065ab4be1942e0d41583903f6aac02d97df6b4a92a07a633397a8)\n\nThe malicious loader DLL msi.dll was loaded via DLL search order hijacking by OnesNotem.exe and\nultimately decrypted the NoteLogger.dat file containing the PlugX payload. For persistence,\n```\nOnesNotem.exe and msi.dll were placed into the folder\nC:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\MUxPOTy\\, and NoteLogger.dat was placed into the\nC:\\ProgramData\\.vscodes\\ folder. The legitimate executable OnesNotem.exe was executed upon\n\n```\nstart-up via the Run registry key using the key name OneNote Update in an identical manner observed\nin the previous Mongolia-focused targeting. The infection chain ultimately loaded the PlugX backdoor\ninto memory, which then communicated to two RedDelta C2 domains, ivibers[.]com and\n_meetviberapi[.]com, which were proxied via Cloudflare to the backend threat actor-controlled C2 IP_\naddresses 207.148.119[.]237 and 209.250.241[.]108.\n\nThe user is also shown a Taiwan-themed decoy document regarding the Taiwanese presidential\ncampaign of Terry Gou (郭台銘) with the filename 郭台銘選擇賴佩霞為總統副手深層考量.pdf\n(translation: Terry Gou carefully considers choosing Lai Peixia as presidential\n```\ndeputy.pdf), as shown in Figure 6.\n\n```\n7 CTA-CN-2025-0109 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Taiwan presidential campaign-themed decoy document displayed to user following PlugX infection chain_**\n\n_(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### Taipei Residential Renovation-Themed Sample\n\nThe second identified sample, 6460c7.msi (sha256:\n364f38b48565814b576f482c1e0eb4c8d58effcd033fd45136ee00640a2b5321), used an identical\ninfection chain. In this case, the PlugX payload communicates to the RedDelta C2 domain\n_electrictulsa[.]com, proxied via Cloudflare to the backend threat actor-controlled C2 IP address_\n_64.176.50[.]176.

This RedDelta activity involved an adapted initial infection chain, now incorporating\nMicrosoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files as the first stage component instead of the\nWindows LNK files seen in previous RedDelta activity. Upon execution, the MSC file was configured to\n\n9 CTA-CN-2025-0109 Recorded Future[®] [| www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nrun a PowerShell command that downloaded and installed a remotely hosted MSI file, with the\nremainder of the infection chain closely resembling the RedDelta activity described above.\n\n**_Figure 8: Updated RedDelta infection chain observed in May 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nInsikt Group identified the group using Cloudflare's geofencing capabilities for the first time to restrict\ndownloading the latter stages of the group’s infection chain to target countries — in this case, Myanmar.\n\n##### Initial Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (.msc) Files\n\nRedDelta domains were used to stage files fetched via initial MSC samples likely distributed via\nspearphishing (see Table 2).

In particular, look at which\ndata anyone with access to an employee account or device would have access to (for example,\nthrough device or account takeover via phishing).\n\n  - Strongly consider instituting role-based access, limiting company-wide data access, and\nrestricting access to sensitive data.\n\n  - Employ host-based controls; one of the best defenses and warning signals to thwart attacks is to\nconduct client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities.\n\n  - Disable basic and legacy authentication where possible, as these can allow attackers to bypass\nin-place security measures.\n\n  - Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and controls, such as network\nIDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection\nsources.\n\n  - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information,\nsuch as multifactor authentication and extremely restricted access and storage on systems only\naccessible via an internal network.\n\n  - [Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/) users can monitor real-time output to identify\nsuspected targeted intrusion activity involving key vendors and partners within physical,\nnetwork, and software supply chains.\n\n  - By monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future customers can alert on and\nproactively monitor infrastructure that may be involved in notable communication to known\nRedDelta command-and-control (C2) IP addresses.\n\n  - [Install the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Browser Extension](https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/browser-extension) to get instant access to threat\nintelligence from any web-based resource. This extension enables users to process alerts faster\nwithin their security information and event management (SIEM) and prioritize vulnerabilities for\npatching.\n\n  - Review public guidance on mitigating common TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups\n[(1,](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a) [2,](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a) [3,](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/07/2002191601/-1/-1/0/Mitigating%20Recent%20VPN%20Vulnerabilities%20-%20Copy.pdf) [4).
