Recently, we detected Carbanak campaigns\nattempting to:\n\n- Target high level executives in financial companies or in financial/decision-making roles in the Middle East, U.S. and Europe\n\n- Spear-phishing emails delivering URLs, macro documents, exploit documents\n\n- \u0007Use of Spy.Sekur (Carbanak malware) and commodity remote access Trojans (RATs) such as jRAT, Netwire, Cybergate and others\nused in support of operations.\n\n## 1.1 Campaign Targeting Middle East (URLs leading to Exploit Docs)\n\nOn March 1st 2016, Proofpoint detected a targeted email sent to hand-picked individuals working for banks, financial organizations,\nand several professional service companies and companies selling enterprise software. These targets are high level executives and\ndecision makers such as directors, senior managers, regional/country managers, operations managers. The majority of targets work\nin the Middle East region in countries such as UAE, Lebanon, Kuwait, Yemen and others.\n\nFigure 1: Email sent to executives working in the Middle East\n\nThe email contained a URL to a Microsoft Word document hosted on a compromised site churchmanarts[.]com. The document,\nWRONG_AMOUN-01032016.doc (SHA256: ac63520803ce7f1343d4fa31588c1fef6abb0783980ad0ba613be749815c5900), exploits\nCVE-2015-2545 when opened to drop and execute a downloader from the client’s temporary folder. This document drops essentially\nthe same payload every time, but slightly modified, possibly so that every execution results in a dropped file with a different hash.\n\nFigure 2: CVE-2015-2545 document dropping the\nmalware downloader\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\n## Malware: Downloader and Sky.Sekur\n\nAfter exploiting the vulnerability, the document drops the payload into %TMP%\\1B9D.tmp (SHA256:\n73259c6eacf212e22adb095647b6ae345d42552911ac93cdf81a3e2005763e74). This payload is a downloader (MSIL/JScript), a MSIL\npacked executable (PE) that utilizes the Microsoft JScript library to retrieve the hardcoded HTTP location (Figure 4) and then executes\nthe downloaded payload using WScript.Shell. In this case it retrieved the second-stage payload Spy.Sekur from hxxp://78.128.92[.]49/\nblesx.exe (SHA256: 04e86912d195d9189e64d1ce80374bed3073b0fcb731f3f403822a510e76ebaa).\n\nFigure 3: MSIL JScript downloader\nretrieving payload\n\nFigure 4: Decompiled MSIL showing\nhardcoded payload HTTP target\n\nBlesx.exe is a NSIS self-extracting installer.

Additional WinAPIs needed by stole.dll are decoded from the file FervencyPoseuseChitchat (Table 1). Next, the file “cyan\nbl 4.ADO” is decoded using the key GurnardScapularyHydrograph provided by the NSIS script, resulting in a Carbanak/Spy.Sekur\npayload (SHA256: 2a087005db13302e90156829ce2b03c01063e364da3e3db153e4f47d61038757). The decoding algorithm is almost\nidentical to Malwarebytes research[3], however the prev_j value is instead initialized to “key[0] % keylen”.\n\nFigure 7: Spy.Sekur HTTP GET\ncommand-and-control (C&C) beacon\n\nFigure 8: Spy.Sekur TCP C&C beacon\n\n|SHA256 Hash|Filename|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|9280fa54ee5ac4bb7ca781d2e1e617ad 407615ec8c4c4098aba88092611cbd72|cyan bl 4.ADO|Encoded Spy.Sekur|\n|25e41d2a708cd2ff0f8af0e1e5112a0ef 5220f67d66f8c71ee56a66ae2ce0c15|FervencyPoseuseChitchat|Encoded WinAPIs|\n|7d680d2b30601fb28bac4d71ef4f602bffc 867ccec44899989e26ed68d75d0fa|stole.dll|Decodes and executes Spy.Sekur|\n|44e5dfd551b38e886214bd6b9c8ee913c 4c4d1f085a6575d97c3e892b925da82|System.dll|NSIS System Plug-in, used to execute stole.dll|\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\n## Malware: Java-based RAT, jRAT\n\nAt the same time they were spreading Spy.Sekur, the attackers also sent emails (with some target overlap) containing\nURLs linking to jRAT. The email contained a URL to a Java JAR file hosted on a compromised site damianroz[.]\ncom. The malware file, captioned_transactionutrno_fftt16044002829-dtd02032016imagejpg.jar (SHA256:\n04281900f08d55a3adc80182419609faf4c49d260d18496ecb3d3b90caca0612) communicates to C&C address 185.29.9[.]16.\n\nFigure 9: Excerpts from\ndecompiled jRAT code\n\nThis RAT gives the attacker the functionality to chat with the victim, manage files (copy, create, delete, download, get dride listing,\nmove, rename, run), keylogger, manage processes (kill, create), monitor clipboard, monitor webcam by taking images and capture,\nrecord sound, reboot, shutdown, logoff, modify registry (read, delete, write keys), read hosts file, get the victim’s geographic location,\nand other capabilities.\n\nThe following evidence enabled us to connect this RAT to same group distributing Spy.Sekur:\n\n- \u0007Similarity in payload URLs. For example, the malicious URL in the email leading to Spy.Sekur is shown first and the malicious URL\nleading to jRAT is shown below it:\nhxxp://churchmanarts[.]com/googlesqlz/22t/download.php?file=[base64 string]\nhxxp://damianroz[.]com/22t/download.php?file=[base64 string]\n\n- Overlap in sender email addresses\n\n- \u0007The jRAT C&C IP address, 185.29.9[.]16 was observed as the first one to download the malicious document from churchmanarts[.]\ncom. We believe that 185.29.9[.]16 was under the control of the attacker and used as a proxy and C&C address.\n\n## 1.2. Campaign Targeting U.S. and Europe (Macro Document Attachments)\n\nOn March 4th 2016, Proofpoint detected more targeted emails sent to individuals (as well as support and operational aliases) working\nfor financial industry, mass media, and other seemingly unrelated targets in fire, safety, air conditioning and heating. These individuals\nall worked in financial and helpdesk roles such as account manager, credit controller, and IT support. Unlike the previously described\ncampaign, majority of targets work in U.S.- and Europe-based companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\nFigure 10: Example email sent in March 4th\ncampaign with subject “Balance Confirmation as\non March 05 2016”\n\nUnlike the March 1st campaign, which contained links to exploit documents, this campaign employed documents attached to email\nmessages. The two observed documents “remitter request_2016-03-05-122839.doc” and “Reverse debit posted in Error 040316.doc”\nuse macros to download the final Spy.Sekur payload from hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe.\n\nFigure 11: Attachment “remitter\nrequest_2016-03-05-122839.doc”\n\nFigure 12: Attachment “Reverse debit posted\nin Error 040316.doc”\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\n## Malware: Spy.Sekur\n\nOnce the user enables the malicious macros embedded in the document attachment, each document downloads Spy.Sekur payload\nfrom hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe (SHA256: 9758aa737004fc3fc6bc7d535e604324b6e42c7c19459f575083a411a4774b18). Unlike\nthe March 1st campaign, there is no separate downloader. As before, however, the payload is a NSIS-self extracting installer signed\nwith the same Time Doctor LLC and Tragon Corporation certificates.\n\nOnce installed and running, Spy.Sekur beacons to the same C&C server www[.]carenty44[.]net and IP address 78.128.92[.]29.\nSimilarly, in the custom TCP C&C beacon, the string “ArabLab0” can be observed; this is a hardcoded value possibly used as the\ncampaign identifier for these attacks.\n\n## Malware: Netwire\n\nWhile we did not observe any emails attempting to infect\ntargets with Netwire in this campaign, we discovered\nit hosted on hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/vex.exe (SHA256:\n33808e7f7837323686c10c5da1e60812\nafe041f28004ee667a5683a53532206c), which was also hosting\nSpy.Sekur. We believe the Netwire may have been spread as a\npart of the same campaign.\n\nThe following evidence enabled us to connect this Netwire\nmalware to the same group distributing Spy.Sekur:\n\nFigure 13: Extracted Netwire configuration\n\n- \u0007The payload IP address that hosted Spy.Sekur and Netwire at the same time\n\n- hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/vex.exe (Netwire)\n\n- hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe (Spy.Sekur)\n\n- \u0007The Netwire C&C IP address, 185.29.9[.]16, is once again the same IP that was used as C&C for the previously described jRAT and\nobserved downloading the malicious document from churchmanarts[.]com.\n\nFigure 14: Maltego graph illustrating Spy.Sekur connections to other RATs\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\n## 1.3 Regional Targeting Statistics\n\nAnalyzing a combination of logs (specifically, IP addresses downloading malicious documents, with our best effort to filter out security\nresearchers) and statistics on recipients of the malicious emails, we created a chart showing the targeted countries (Figure 15).\nTargets in the U.S. heavily outweigh other countries due to the preponderance of financial organizations based. Organizations in\nMiddle Eastern countries such as Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and others were the next most-targeted.\n\nFigure 15: Campaign targeting by country\n\n## 2. Additional Carbanak Campaigns and Payloads\n\nWhile searching for additional occurrences of the MSIL/JScript downloader, we uncovered an additional payload URL that was\nrotated several times producing different payloads. As shown in the Maltego graph in Figure 14, several MSIL/JScript downloaders\nwere pointed at the URL: hxxp://172.98.202[.]171/famzy/final.exe. MorphineRAT, DarkComet, and most notably Spy.Sekur have been\nobserved being hosted at the URL (Table 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\n**SHA256** **Payload family** **C&C**\n\n86c20c0e0417e73b51241a769164ddb Spy.Sekur Encoded Spy.Sekur\n33429a255f40e6bd1c86bed537b2eec1d\n\ndd92174f158778849f81f6971b7bc9bbda MorphineRAT Encoded WinAPIs\n7d737b6911f50c19212fb0e728bebf\n\n344b79f93d99317087403e7422b56387 MorphineRAT Decodes and executes Spy.Sekur\n05066d4fa6abf69d861cad0537fe1a10\n\n35eff02140b6c8ed8d34cfc40c50325258 DarkComet [NSIS System Plug-in, used to execute stole.dll](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Calling_an_external_DLL_using_the_System.dll_plugin)\n88632a964ea9c8180c0912e69b32a1\n\na066943aef22d6dde725b0334e69cba4 DarkComet Decodes and executes Spy.Sekur\n436e38af991f79fab037c3e63d4f463c\n\n155f9a071a3bf46b99c8423de4822651 DarkComet [NSIS System Plug-in, used to execute stole.dll](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Calling_an_external_DLL_using_the_System.dll_plugin)\n91a124c15668300d7258a6d56eababbd\n\n9d1fda93fdc08d28f1ec109cf187bd6b56 DarkComet\nb011e73f12722c0f79652e290c059b\n\nTable 2: Rotated /famzy/final.exe payloads\n\n## 2.1. The “TUBOR0” Campaign\n\nThe Spy.Sekur (SHA256: 86c20c0e0417e73b51241a769164ddb33429a255f40e6bd1c86bed537b2eec1d) payload\ncontained the hardcoded identifier “TUBOR0”. We have observed additional samples using the same identifier,\nincluding one (SHA256: 18f29f44d40846850a10f4eb5d217685e5853acababd08c7fdf4e3106452d33c) signed with\nthe same Time Doctor LLC certificate previously mentioned as well as a SHA256 digest MicroHealth certificate,\nserial number 00:8F:3A:01:E1:C3:EE:AF:CC:BB:E6:22:95:50:7A:4E:20. An additional “TUBOR0” sample (SHA256:\n390cffc97ad6982a3f7c7a1bbbc65bf2abf797267b134a58581b644cb5595f26) was found being dropped by a PowerPoint document\n(SHA256: e8023e1362ee9240658565eabd18405e2694906a521377222984b82fdbb22714), likely exploiting CVE-204-6352. This sample\nwas not signed; however, it was configured to use the same C&C (www[.]googlesswe[.]com and 149.202.29[.]77) as the MicroHealth\nsigned Spy.Sekur. Furthermore, an “ArabLab0” sample was found hosted at hxxp://87[.]120[.]37[.]90/fend.png configured with the\nsame C&C as other “ArabLab0” samples, however neither a downloader or an email campaign has been discovered utilizing the fend.\npng URL. The overlaps in the Spy.Sekur campaigns as well as the DarkComet and MorphineRAT activity are illustrated in the Maltego\ngraph in Figure 16.\n\nFigure 16: Maltego graph of TUBOR0. ArabLab0 Spy.Sekur overlap and additional RATs\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East\n\n## 2.2. MorphineRAT / DarkComet Connections\n\nFinally, we researchers observed an email campaign utilizing a CVE-2015-2545 attachment (SHA256:a400ef9313199f5795de45cbe6e\n31c4001c973e1c7fe9676bd5d301c977f8dac) whose payload was a MSIL/JScript Downloader (SHA256:cb6f847bcb8f585bc635157b5\n906e2da423c04b862a5ee8036fb5dd2e1ce71a4) configured to download a final payload from hxxp://172.98.202[.]171/famzy/final.exe.\nWhile the targeting for this campaign is not consistent with previous email campaigns that we have attributed to Carbanak, definite\nsimilarities and overlap exist, including:\n\n- CVE-2015-2545 exploit attachments with same metadata\n\n- Exploit attachments delivering MSIL/JScript Downloader\n\n- MSIL/JScript Downloader targets in both instances at some point were Spy.Sekur\n\nAlthough none has been proven definitively at this time, we have several possible explanations for a connection between the\nDarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actors:\n\n- DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actor(s) are employing the same payload delivery service.\n\n- DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actor(s) work closely together to achieve their goals (partnership, hired help, etc.).\n\n- \u0007DarkComet/MorphineRAT activity is conducted by Carbanak actor(s) however the responsible operators are potentially functioning\nwith different goals in mind as illustrated by the wide range of targeted vertical industries.\n\n## 2.3. Usage of Signed Payloads\n\nAs discussed above, numerous Spy.Sekur payloads have been signed using stolen or fraudulent certificates. In addition to Spy.Sekur,\nthese certificates have been used to sign many other samples belonging to different families, including various crypto ransomware\nvariants (Locky, TeslaCrypt, CryptoWall, Raas, Critroni), Neurevt, and Luminosity Link RAT. It is possible that the Carbanak actor(s) are\nusing signing certificates that are also made available to other groups and actors, therefore observing these certificates is not a strong\nenough indicator for Carbanak activity.\n\n## 2.4. An Even Older Campaign Delivering Toshliph & CyberGate\n\nWhile this RAT was involved in a much older campaign than described in this document, we have previously observed\nToshliph (another malware in Carbanak arsenal) downloading Cybergate as a secondary payload. We include this information\nhere for completeness. On August 26, 2015, a document “Application form USD duplicate payment.doc” (SHA256:\na56c14acef1e0e2e262b5670e539c0008fdb785edf3e96ef285017894b598596) was sent as an email attachment to a list of individuals\nworking at U.S.-based financial organizations. It exploited CVE-2015-1770 and CVE-2015-1641 to drop Toshliph (SHA256:\nbf4d24021fa5210eece4dffb7d1c53450c8401b319597669680d69617fa874ba). Toshliph (C2: 78.128.92[.]117) in turn downloaded\nCyberGate (C2: 93.115.38[.]202). It should be noted that the C&C for this old Aug 2015 Toshliph campaign is in the same netblock as\nthe March 2016 Spy.Sekur campaigns.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Carbanak group has been behind a number of attacks since 2013, most characterized by APT-style campaigns targeting multiple\ngroups with a variety of malware. In this case, we saw the group use new exploits, macro documents, and RATs to target new groups\noutside their usual Russian domains. The group used attachment campaigns, URLs linking to exploit documents, and sophisticated\nmalware to go after targets in the US and Middle East. The group also expanded its targeting from financial institutions to seemingly\nunrelated targets in fire, safety, and HVAC. However, as we learned from the Target data breach, among others, vendors and suppliers\ncan give attackers a point of entry into their real target.\n\nReferences\n\n[[1]
