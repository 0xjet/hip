Bahamut was shown to be resourceful, not only maintaining their own Android\nmalware but running propaganda sites, although the quality of these activities varied\nnoticeably.\n\nOur publication on the campaign coincided with a series of defacements and leaked emails\nrelated to Qatar and its neighbors, the same types of targets that arose in our research.\nWhile we have found no evidence to link the group to these incidents, Bahamut provided a\nuseful window into the activities rampant in the Gulf at a time when hacking has contributed\nto a regional diplomatic crisis. The incident further demonstrated the blurred lines in\ncybersecurity between attacks against human rights communities and espionage against\ndiplomats, as well as the potential role of non-state actors in state-aligned cyber operations.\n\nAfter publication, the identified operations and malware domains were taken down. For three\nmonths there was no apparent further activity from the actor. However, in the same week of\nSeptember a series of spearphishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise\nunrelated individuals, employing the same tactics as before. Bahamut remains active, and its\noperations are more extensive than first disclosed. Our primary contribution in this update is\nto implicate Bahamut in what are likely counterterrorism-motivated surveillance operations,\nand to further affirm our belief that the group is a hacker-for-hire operation. Toward this we\ndocument a previously unnoticed link with a campaign targeting South Asia that was\npublished last year. This post extends the previous publication with recent activity and lends\nmore evidence to our past hypotheses about the political nature of its operations.\n\n## Overlap with Previous Campaigns\n\nOur initial observation of the Bahamut group originated from in-the-wild attempts to deceive\ntargets into providing account passwords through impersonation of platform providers. After\nunpacking the larger targeting of the attacks, the credential theft operations were found to\ncover a broad range of interests in the Middle East, such as Turkish diplomats and Iranian\npolitical figures in the lead up to the recent presidential election. As we noted then, these\n\n\n-----\n\nincidents stood out because they exceeded the level of care and preparation seen in the\n[everyday cybercrime. In our report, we also noted a similarity to the “Operation Kingphish”](http://medium.com/amnesty-insights/operation-kingphish-uncovering-a-campaign-of-cyber-attacks-against-civil-society-in-qatar-and-aa40c9e08852)\ncampaign published by Amnesty International earlier this year. As we wrote then, compared\nto Kingphish, Bahamut “operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms of\nprofessionalism and ambition.”\n\nA more recent credential theft attempt provided the most credible link between the two\ncampaigns thus far, and bolsters our hypothesis that the operations are related. Among a\nflurry of spearphishing attempts associated with Bahamut in recent weeks, one fake Google\nmessage directed its target to a unique domain (string2port[.]com) to steal login credentials.\nThe string2port domain (registered in May 2016) strongly reflects the ping2port[.]info domain\n(registered in September 2016) that was used in Kingphish against Qatar-focused labor\nrights advocates. The ping2port domain is now pending deletion – abandoned due to\ndiscovery – but the previously unnoticed and related string2port has been reused. Given the\nsimilarities in tactics, administration of infrastructure, domains, and other factors, it appears\nincreasingly clear both campaigns against Middle Eastern diplomats and those directed\nagainst human rights advocates are connected.\n\nThe similarities to other research is not limited to Kingphish, and includes a prolific campaign\nin South Asia. In our original post we noted that an expansive operation was evident from a\nsearch of potential domains based on common pattern in domain registration and hosting\nbehavior (an Anglo-European name sometimes followed by a number at mail.ru, often also\nfound in the DNS ‘Start of Authority’ record). Here too, we find multiple other candidate\ndomains based on simple search patterns, although other email providers such as Pobox.sk\nare now more common. While we published a number of domain names that were clearly\nmalicious and similar to Bahamut, we did not post the full list out of a concern of false\npositives. Included in these results was a domain i3mode[.]com, which used a Mail.ru contact\nemail and was hosted on a network found in other Bahamut spearphishing attempts.\n\nWhois (i3mode[.]com):\n\nRegistrant Name: KEDRICK BROWN\nRegistrant Phone: +503.503226605642\nRegistrant Email: KEDRICK.BROWN.84@MAIL.RU\n\n[This domain appears in Kaspersky’s blog post “InPage zero-day exploit used to attack](https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-used-to-attack-financial-institutions-in-asia/76717/)\nfinancial institutions in Asia” from November 2016. That campaign targeted financial\ninstitutions with malware that took advantage of a vulnerability in text processing software\npopular with Urdu and Arabic speaking users. The domains in the InPage campaign match\nthe same pattern of registration and hosting within Bahamut. The Urdu connection recalls our\nidentification of Android malware posing as a Urdu Quranic reference. This thematic overlap\nalso includes a relevant sample “Analysis Report on Kashmir.exe,” which would be of interest\nto a South Asian audience. Additionally, another sample connecting to the i3mode domain\n\n\n-----\n\n( E-Challan.zip ) appears to be a reference to receipt for payment or delivery specific to India\nand Pakistan. The staging domain for that malware also has another subdomain that\nappeared to reference an Indian business newspaper (“mint-news-portal.hymnfork.com”).\n\nThis faint connection in domains and similar interests provides a first hint that Bahamut is\nmore active than we were previously aware and bolsters our hypothesis that the group is a\nhackers-for-hire operation.\n\n## Malware Campaigns in South Asia\n\nIn the Bahamut report, we discussed two domains found within our search that were linked\nwith a custom Android malware agent. This connection between the malware and credential\ntheft was reinforced by some similarities in how the agent reported back to the attacker’s\nservers, and thus we felt moderately confident about a link between the credential theft and\nthe malware. After the publication of the original report, these sites were taken offline despite\nthe fact that one agent was even updated a six days prior to our post (the “Khuai”\napplication). Additionally, antivirus engines began to detect copies of this malware based on\ncommon patterns in development, including apps that we were not aware of. Based on a\nsearch of public sources, we find three more malicious applications focused mostly on South\nAsia, including samples uploaded from India.\n\n\n-----\n\nIncluded in the newly detected apps was one named “Devoted to Humanity,” which has been\ntaken down from the Play Store (devoted.to.humanity). Based on the name and domains\nused in the communications (“devotedtohumanity-fif[.]info”, which was registered in March\n2016), it appears that the application impersonates the “Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation” (FIF)\nthat ostensibly operates as a religious charity primarily in Pakistan. FIF is notable for its links\nto the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist organization, which has committed mass-casualty\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks in India in support of establishing Pakistani control over the disputed Jammu and\nKashmir border region. As a result of its connections to LeT and international pressure to\ncrack down on Kashmiri jihadists, Pakistan placed FIF under on a terrorism watch list in\nJanuary 2017. The development of a malware agent relevant to Indian and Pakistani security\ninterests, timed with increased international scrutiny on FIF, suggests a counterterrorism and\nintelligence motive for Bahamut’s espionage.\n\nThe “Devoted to Humanity” app also references an image hosted on domain\n[voguextra[.]com, which appears to have been used to stage decoy documents.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/url/a65bcd077ea0c098ae0bc88414a38f2cf4333cae40d704eb88dfa043819f70d7/details)\n\nThe Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation app is not the only Kashmir-related campaign associated\nwith Bahamut. Pivoting off the unique contact information used to register the FIF domain,\n[“adgnad dangda” and “adgnad@mail.ru”, we also find two more (“Android-Cloud.net” and](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:adgnad@mail.ru)\n“Kashmir-Weather-Info.com”) that were cohosted on the same server as the FIF site. The\nKashmir Weather domain corresponds with a now-removed Android application with the\nsimilar set of permissions and tactics found in the previous malware (com.weather.kashmir).\nThe purpose of the “Android-Cloud.net” domain is not currently known.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that the domains had lapsed and were re-registered since they were\nfirst used. So while they appear to be malicious, the current custody is unclear. The domains\nnow purport to be for a platform “Donkey Service” (“DoDoDonkey”), which provides a less\nthan credible pitch:\n\n_Donkey Service has incredibly large network and infrastructure to stop really large_\n_attacks on the Mobile system._\n\n_We just get clean requests and never have to deal with malicious traffic or attacks on_\n_the Mobile infrastructure. We are the perfect partner for our business!_\n\nMuch of this text is copied from a [customer quote about Cloudflare.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171025013327/https:/www.cloudflare.com/gimlet/)\n\nAs with the “Khuai” Chinese-English translator malware in the previous post, other identified\nagents have unclear targets, such as the “MXI Player” that was last updated August 2017\n(mxiplayer[.]com). MXI Player appears to be a version of the Bahamut agent, designed to\nrecord the phone calls and collect other information about the user (com.mxi.videoplay).\nAfter having been kicked off Play Store several times, it appears that Bahamut is now\nhosting its agent on the APKPure alternative app store. However, the malware retains certain\ndesign choices seen in previous attacks, for example around encryption and communications\nwith the attacker server. As a result, it is already flagged as Bahamut by antivirus engines.\n\nMore interestingly, the MXI Player site also includes a Windows version of the application,\nwhich is a rebranded media player that also installs a malware agent posing as a software\nupdater (mxiupdate.exe). A full write up of the Windows malware is not in scope of this article\nfor the sake of brevity and our intended contribution. A hash for the malware agent is\n\n\n-----\n\nprovided in the appendix for those interested. A cursory inspection of debugging artifacts and\nother details, such as an embedded filesystem path referring to a template code project\n(“EmbeddedAssembly_1.3”), suggests that the agent is both rudimentary and custom\ndesigned.\n\nOne important trait worth noting is that the Windows malware’s communications strongly\nresembles the malware connected to the domains disclosed by Kaspersky. These similarities\ninclude same approach of communication beacons to a randomly-named path on the\nattacker’s server, with the same URL parameters that contain similar types of values\n(probably AES encrypted strings represented in base64, like the Android applications):\n\nBahamut’s Mixi Player malware (mxiplayer[.]com):\n\n/hdhfdhffjvfjd/gfdhghfdjhvbdfhj.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=N/A&s=[string]&t=[string]\n\nInPageCampaign malware (encrypzi[.]com):\n\n/fdjgwsdjgbfv/dbzkfgdkgbvfb.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=0&s=[string]\n\nThese repeated parallels further indicate a relationship between the Android malware\noperations and the InPage-related espionage. In review, these connections include:\n\nOverlap between the extended network of domains relevant to Bahamut’s credential\ntheft infrastructure and malware domains in Kaspersky’s report;\nSimilarity in the format of beacons between Bahamut’s Windows agent and malware\nassociated with the InPage domains, and to a lesser extent even in the Android agent;\nand,\nCommonalities in targeted interests, namely the contested Kashmir region.\n\nOne curious trait of Bahamut is that it develops fully-functional applications in support of its\nespionage activities, rather than push nonfunctional fake apps or bundle malware with\nlegitimate software. These include translation and weather applications that involved\nrequests to third-party APIs and other user interactions. While much of the code appears to\nbe copied and these applications are simple, Bahamut must spend a fair amount of time on\noperations that target a small number of individuals. The content and app market\ndescriptions of the three Android applications also recalls our previous observation that the\nBahamut actor appears to be fluent in English, albeit constrained either due to not being\nnative speakers or lack of professionalism.\n\n## Credential Theft in the Middle East\n\nBahamut has taken a more concerted effort to reduce exposure of their operations,\npreventing the research techniques that led to our cataloguing of their infrastructure and\noperations in the first post. Once again, the attempts all originate from less reputable hosting\ncompanies and networks (AS44901, BelCloud Hosting Corporation). Spearphishing pages\n\n\n-----\n\nare now more resistant to enumeration attempts and appear to use a dedicated subdomain\nfor one specific victim. The unique subdomain appears to be automatically disabled after the\n“successful” phishing attempt in order to cover the trail of the attack (redirecting the user\nelsewhere or appearing to be a Google error page). These pages have also increased their\nuse of unicode replacements for letters and other font tricks as a way to evade network filters\nor to deceive users (e.g. using r and n, “rn”, to appear like the letter “m”). Altogether an\nalready stealthy actor has improved their operational profile.\n\nCuriously, Bahamut appears to track password attempts in response to failed phishing\nattempts or to provoke the target to provide more passwords. These passwords are\nhardcoded in the phishing page so that the login form will immediately return a “bad\n\n\n-----\n\npassword message if entered. This could be designed to trick the user into providing older\npasswords or alternative passwords used on other platforms to provide a foothold into other\nservices. The result is that Bahamut spearphishing pages include over two hundred possible\nreal world passwords that appear to cover at least a couple of dozen likely victims.\n\nThe theme of the passwords provide indication of the types of targets and victims of\nBahamut since our last encounter. Most of the domains clearly reflect a Middle Eastern\naudience, including referring to individuals’ names (e.g. “al Khalifa”) and Emirati phone\nnumbers. Some of these passwords are cryptic – such as one referencing a supermarket in\nBeirut. Others reference a “national bloc,” Gaza, the Dubai Expo in 2020, and a Saudi media\nentity. More generally, these targets appear to include people or entities in the United Arab\nEmirates, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, and Bahrain, among other Arab countries. Further\ndemonstrating its focus on the Middle East, the phishing page specifically (and exclusively)\nchecks if the visitor’s browser is set to the Arabic language and redirects them to a translated\npage. Where targets are personally identifiable, these campaigns reflect an intimate\nunderstanding of the relationships and members of the policy and international relations\nsectors of certain Gulf states – information that would not be readily accessible to a\nbystander, and targets that would not be of interest outside of political motivations.\n\nThe recent incidents also involved a social engineering tactic well documented in the\nKingphish report: fictitious social media profiles. In Kingphish, a profile active on LinkedIn,\nTwitter, and Facebook (purporting to be an IT and business professional) approached labor\nrights advocates requesting help on research about human trafficking.\n\nSimilarly, a [fictitious LinkedIn profile named “Sophie Foster” attempted to simultaneously](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-foster-65920b147/)\napproach multiple targets of Bahamut’s phishing messages. The Foster profile appears\ncrafted for a professional Middle East related demographic, claiming to have experience in\npublic relations and international trade. Among connections to SOAS and LSE students,\nwhich appear to be cover related to her claimed educational background, the profile has a\nclear theme in targets: journalists and public relations professionals in the Middle East,\nincluding individuals at Sky News Arabia and Al-Masry Al-Youm, and others in Egypt,\nLebanon, Saudi, UAE, and Turkey. A [two-year old Facebook profile exists for the persona,](https://www.facebook.com/people/Sophie-Foster/100019404465464)\nwhich has liked pages for Lebanese politicians and has a Mail.ru account linked to it.\n\n\n-----\n\nBahamut spearphishing attempts have also been accompanied with SMS messages\npurporting to be from Google about security issues on their account, including a class 0\nmessage or “flash text.” These text messages did not include links but are intended to build\ncredibility around the fake service notifications later sent to the target’s email address. The\nuse of fake sender identifiers – especially combined with the unusual flash text approach –\ncould be effective, but once again Bahamut is betrayed by its unusual English.\n\nBahamut also appears to be more aggressive in reconnaissance against targets. As it\nharvested potential addresses associated with targets, it would sended tailored or salacious\nmessages with image-based trackers to check if the message was opened. These provide a\n\n\n-----\n\nmetric as to whether the target is ignoring attacks, or whether the email address is not\nmonitored or active. The messages were crafted to a Middle East focused audience,\nprimarily posing as news stories or media outlets (e.g. Al Monitor) relevant to the region.\n\n## Conclusion and Implications\n\nGiven our increased confidence that Bahamut was responsible for targeting of Qatari labor\nrights advocates and its focus on the foreign policy institutions other Gulf states, Bahamut’s\ninterests are seemingly too expansive to be limited one sponsor or customer. However, those\ntargets fall within coherent themes. It is unclear which single client could be interested in\nboth a Kashmiri organization on a terrorism watchlist and Egyptian journalists. Thus far,\nBahamut’s campaigns have appeared to be primarily espionage or information operations –\nnot destructive attacks or fraud. The targets and themes of Bahamut’s campaigns have\nconsistently fallen within two regions – South Asia (primarily Pakistan, specifically Kashmir)\nand the Middle East (from Morocco to Iran). The targeting of organizations scrutinized ties to\nterrorism raises the stakes for the operation, and differentiate it from usual cybercrime.\nTargets outside of the Middle East tend to still have associations to Middle Eastern issues,\nsuch as a European investment firm active in a Gulf country and a foreign policy experts in\nthe West. We have not found evidence of Bahamut engaging in crime or operating outside its\nlimited geographic domains, although this narrow perspective could be accounted for by its\ncompartmentalization of operations.\n\nThere remains ample questions and research opportunities to be explored. While Bahamut\nhas leveraged resources in Urdu and Arabic, it appears to be most comfortable in the\nEnglish language despite its uncommon grammar. While we note malicious domains that\nmaintain a similar profile to Bahamut that impersonate Qatari government email services, we\nhave not found a direct connection to those campaigns, and there has been little indication of\nthe targeting of Qatar within our monitoring. We have not fully explored the extent of\nBahamut’s operations, such as its Windows malware agent or possible other Android\nmalware. Moreover, the networks and tactics used within Bahamut’s operations turn up\nsuspicious sites that resemble the Times of Arab operation disclosed previously – often\nMiddle East focused news published in English that recirculate content on technology and\npolitics with no clear attribution or purpose. These suspicious sites and those we can\n\n\n-----\n\naccount for as Bahamut repeatedly turn up a nexus with India, more so than the Middle East,\ndespite attempts by the attackers to stay anonymous. Once again, our investigation only\nseems to be a limited window into a strange operation.\n\nThe proposition that a non-state hacker-for-hire operation could be used in pursuit of regional\nstate interests is not unusual. At this point most Middle Eastern governments have at least\nonce procured cyber espionage capabilities from abroad, such as from the government\nmalware vendors FinFisher, NSO and Hacking Team. By one account, Qatar even sought to\noutsource an offensive cyber program to American companies – a deal that was quashed by\nthe U.S. government. This reliance on contractors could indicate that such countries have\nbeen unable to develop their own in-house capacity, which would align with their general\nreliance on foreign military firms. It is also worth noting that while some government agencies\nmay have acquired tools already, other entities such as local police might still desire their\nown capabilities leading to overlaps. On the vendor side, in recent years companies such as\n[the Indian-firm Aglaya have been implicated in selling full hacking as a service, rather than](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ywvx/leaked-catalog-weaponized-information-twitter-aglaya)\nsimply providing tools for government use. This parallels the unclear lines between\ncybercrime and espionage seen elsewhere, and hints that mercenary cyber operations are\nmore common than currently understood. Thus Bahamut warrants attention as an\nemblematic case of the interest in cyber espionage in places such as the Middle East and\nthe range of vendors willing to meet that demand.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nWe appreciate the help from Tom Lancaster, who noticed the overlap with Kaspersky’s\nInPage report and an additional Android malware agent.
