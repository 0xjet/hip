As part of their investigations, they found evidence of a threat actor hosting malicious\npayloads on what appears to be an `Australian VOIP telecommunications provider with a presence in the` `South`\n```\nPacific nation of Palau .\n\n```\nFurther analysis indicated that targets in `Palau were sent malicious documents that, when opened, exploited this`\nvulnerability, causing victim computers to contact the provider’s website, download and execute the malware, and\nsubsequently become infected.\n\n## Key Observations\n\nThis threat was a complex multi-stage operation utilizing `LOLBAS (Living off the Land Binaries And Scripts), which allowed`\nthe attacker to initialize the attack using the `CVE-2022-30190 vulnerability within the` `Microsoft Support Diagnostic`\n```\nTool . This vulnerability enables threat actors to run malicious code without the user downloading an executable to their\n\n```\nmachine which might be detected by endpoint detection.\n\nMultiple stages of this malware were signed with a legitimate company certificate to add additional legitimacy and minimize\nthe chance of detection.\n\n## First stage\n\nThe compromised website, as pictured in the screenshot below, was used to host `robots.txt which is an executable`\nwhich was disguised as “robots.txt”. We believe the name was used to conceal itself from detection if found in network logs.\nUsing the Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard ( msdt.exe ), this file “robots.txt” was downloaded and saved as the file\n( Sihost.exe ) and then executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Second Stage, Sihost.exe\n\nWhen the renamed “robots.txt” – “Sihost.exe” – was executed by msdt.exe it downloaded the second stage of the attack\nwhich was a loader with the hash `b63fbf80351b3480c62a6a5158334ec8e91fecd057f6c19e4b4dd3febaa9d447 . This`\nexecutable was then used to download and decrypt the third stage of the attack, an encrypted file stored as\n‘ favicon.svg ’ on the same web server.\n\n## Third stage, favicon.svg\n\nAfter this file has been decrypted, it is used to download the fourth stage of the attack from\n```\npalau.voipstelecom.com[.]au. These files are named Sevntx64.exe and Sevntx.lnk, which are then executed\n\n```\non the victims’ machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Fourth Stage, Sevntx64.exe and Sevntx64.lnk\n\nWhen the file is executed, it loads a `66kb shellcode from the` `AsyncRat malware family;` `Sevntx64.exe is signed with`\nthe same compromised certificate as seen previously in “robots.txt”.\n\nThe screenshot below shows the executable loading the shellcode.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Final Stage, AsyncRat\n\nWhen the executable is loaded, the machine has been fully compromised with AsyncRat; the trojan is configured to\ncommunicate with the server `palau[.]voipstelecom[.]com[.]au on port` `443 .`\n\nAsyncRat SHA256:\n\n```\naba9b566dc23169414cb6927ab5368b590529202df41bfd5dded9f7e62b91479\n\n```\n\nScreenshot below with AsyncRat configuration:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe highly recommend Avast Software to protect against the latest threats, and Microsoft patches to protect your Windows\nsystems from the latest `CVE-2022-30190 vulnerability.`\n\n## IOCs:\n\nitem sha256\n\n\n-----\n\nmain webpage `0af202af06aef4d36ea151c5a304414a67aee18c3675286275bd01d11a760c04`\n\nrobots.txt `b63fbf80351b3480c62a6a5158334ec8e91fecd057f6c19e4b4dd3febaa9d447`\n\nfavicon.svg `ed4091700374e007ae478c048734c4bc0b7fe0f41e6d5c611351bf301659eee0`\n\ndecrypted favicon.svg `9651e604f972e36333b14a4095d1758b50decda893e8ff8ab52c95ea89bb9f74`\n\nSevntx64.exe `f3ccf22db2c1060251096fe99464002318baccf598b626f8dbdd5e7fd71fd23f`\n\nSevntx64.lnk `33297dc67c12c7876b8052a5f490cc6a4c50a22712ccf36f4f92962463eb744d`\n\nshellcode from Sevntx64.exe (66814 `7d6d317616d237ba8301707230abbbae64b2f8adb48b878c528a5e42f419133a`\nbytes)\n\nasyncrat `aba9b566dc23169414cb6927ab5368b590529202df41bfd5dded9f7e62b91479`\n\n## Bonus\n\nWe managed to find an earlier version of this malware.\n\nfile hash first seen country\n\n\nGrievance\nAgainst Lawyers,\nJudge or\nJustice.doc.exe\n(signed)\n\nGrievance\nAgainst Lawyers,\nJudge or Justice\n(1).zip\\Grievance\nAgainst Lawyers,\nJudge or\nJustice.doc.exe\n\n\n`87BD2DDFF6A90601F67499384290533701F5A5E6CB43DE185A8EA858A0604974` 26.05.2022 NL,\nproxy\n\n`0477CAC3443BB6E46DE9B904CBA478B778A5C9F82EA411D44A29961F5CC5C842` 18.05.2022 Palau,\nprevious\nvictim\n\n\n## Forensic information from the lnk file:\n\nfield value\n\nApplication Sevntx64.exe\n\nAccessed time 2022-05-19 09:34:26\n\n\nBirth droid MAC\naddress\n\n\n00:0C:29:59:3C:CC\n\n\nBirth droid file ID 0e711e902ecfec11954f000c29593ccc\n\nBirth droid volume ID b097e82425d6c944b33e40f61c831eaf\n\nCreation time 2022-05-19 10:29:34\n\nDrive serial number 0xd4e21f4f\n\nDrive type DRIVE_FIXED\n\nDroid file ID 0e711e902ecfec11954f000c29593ccc\n\nDroid volume ID b097e82425d6c944b33e40f61c831eaf\n\nFile flags FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY\n\nKnown folder ID af2448ede4dca84581e2fc7965083634\n\n\n-----\n\nLink flags EnableTargetMetadata, HasLinkInfo, HasRelativePath, HasTargetIDList, HasWorkingDir,\nIsUnicodeLocal\n\nbase path C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Sevntx64.exe\n\nLocation Local\n\nMAC address 00:0C:29:59:3C:CC\n\nMachine identifier desktop-eev1hc3\n\nModified time 2020-08-19 04:13:44\n\nRelative path .\\Sevntx64.exe\n\nSize 1543\n\nTarget file size 376368\n\nWorking directory C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\n\n[Tagged asanalysis,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/analysis/) [follina,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/follina/) [malware,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/malware/) [rat,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/rat/) [vulnerability](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/vulnerability/)\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n-----",
