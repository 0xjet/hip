With most browsers, you don’t need a Facebook account to watch the video, and if**\nyou do have an account you don’t need to be logged in. If you can’t hear the sound, try\nclicking on the speaker icon in the bottom right corner of the video player to unmute.\n\n**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM THE VIDEO**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Q. Is WannaMine like WannaCry? Is it ransomware that scrambles my disk?**\n\n**A. The name “WannaMine” is a portmanteau word that refers to a malware family that uses**\nthe network spreading capabilities of WannaCry to deliver cryptomining malware rather than\nransomware.\n\n**Q. What is cryptomining malware? Is it as dangerous as ransomware?**\n\n**A. Cryptomining is when crooks secretly get your computer to do the calculations needed to**\ngenerate cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Monero or Ethereum; the crooks keep any\ncryptocoin proceeds for themselves.\n\nTo make money with cryptomining, you need a lot of electricity to deliver a lot processing\npower on a lot of computers.\n\nBy illegally installing cryptominers inside your network, the crooks therefore steal your\nresources to do their work.\n\n**Q. Can cryptomining damage my computer?**\n\n**A. We’ve seen stories of mobile phone batteries bulging due to overheating when the device**\nwas deliberately forced to do mining calculations for hours on end.\n\nHowever, WannaMine doesn’t run on mobile phones – it attacks Windows computers.\n\nNevertheless, even if no permanent damage is done, you’ll probably find your laptop\nbatteries draining much faster than usual, your fans running flat out, and your laptop being\nnoticeably hotter than usual.\n\nAlso, if malware like WannaMine can penetrate your network, you are at serious risk of other\nmalware at the same time, including ransomware.\n\nWe frequently see evidence of cryptomining left behind on computers that were zapped by\nransomware, so don’t ignore WannaMine infections if they show up – where one crooks\ngoes, others will surely follow.\n\n**Q. If I don’t own any cryptocoins and I’m not part of the cryptocurrency scene, am I**\n**still at risk?**\n\n**A. Yes.**\n\nWannaMine malware attacks aren’t trying to locate your digital cryptocurrency stash and\nsteal it.\n\nThey want free use of your computer for cryptomining calculations of their own, whether\nyou’re interested in cryptocurrency or not.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Q. Can security software prevent WannaMine attacks?**\n\n**A. Yes.**\n\n[Exploit prevention software (e.g. Sophos Intercept X) can block the ETERNALBLUE attack](https://sophos.com/interceptx?cmp=26103)\nto prevent malware like this from entering your network in the first place.\n\n[Anti-virus and host intrusion prevention software (e.g. Sophos Endpoint Protection) can](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/endpoint-antivirus.aspx?cmp=26103)\nstop the malicious processes that allow the WannaMine attack to proceed, even if the exploit\ntriggers at te start.\n\nNetwork security software (e.g. **[Sophos XG Firewall) can block the network activity required](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/next-gen-firewall.aspx?cmp=26103)**\nfor malware like WannaMine to work.\n\n**Q. What else can I do?**\n\n**A. Patch promptly, and** [pick proper passwords.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/10/01/how-to-pick-a-proper-password/)\n\nWannaMine malware typically includes the same ETERNALBLUE exploit that was abused by\nWannaCry and allowed it to spread.\n\nThis exploit was patched last year in Microsoft update MS17-010, so a properly patched\nnetwork wouldn’t be open to the exploit in the first place.\n\nIf the ETERNALBLUE hole is already closed, WannaMine can try to spread using password\ncracking tools to find weak passwords on your network.\n\nIt only takes one user with poor password hygiene to put your whole network at risk.\n\n\n-----",
