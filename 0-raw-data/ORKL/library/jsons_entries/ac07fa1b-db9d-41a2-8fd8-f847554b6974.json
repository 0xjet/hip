The intelligence community has not reached a consensus or made a formal\ndetermination. However, officials have told lawmakers that they have intensified their\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigation in recent weeks to include all 18 federal intelligence agencies, and that it is\nfocused on the GRU’s potential involvement, according to a congressional official briefed on\nthe matter.\n\nA White House spokesperson, who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue,\nemphasized that investigators do not yet know the cause of these incidents or whether they\nconstitute an attack by foreign actors. However, the spokesperson said, these are areas of\n“active inquiry,” and the National Security Council is working with other agencies to address\nthe “unexplained health incidents.”\n\n“The health and well-being of American public servants is a paramount priority to the\nAdministration and we take extremely seriously reports by our personnel of anomalous\nhealth incidents,” the spokesperson said.\n\nVictims of the suspected attacks report symptoms consistent with the “Havana syndrome”\nincidents of 2016, in which a number of American spies and diplomats experienced residual\nheadaches, loss of balance and hearing, ringing and pressure in the ears, and sometimes\nlong-term brain damage.\n\n2021-06-07 Directed-energy attacks: The invisible threat Congress wants answers on\n(264711)The GRU’s inclusion as a suspect in the investigation, which has not been\npreviously reported, comes as Biden administration officials are working to reassure\noutraged lawmakers that they are committed to getting to the bottom of the issue and holding\nthose responsible to account. Officials have already sounded the alarm to members of\n[Congress about what they see as an increasing threat of directed-energy attacks on](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/22/troops-directed-energy-attacks-484246)\nAmerican personnel, POLITICO first reported.\n\nCIA Director William Burns is deepening his involvement in the effort and is now receiving\ndaily briefings on the status of the investigation, according to two people familiar with the\nmatter. Burns has also appointed a senior officer reporting directly to him about those efforts.\n\nThe GRU is well-known for its involvement in Russia’s covert operations around the world,\nincluding Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and numerous cyberattacks across the West. The\nU.S. has already found the GRU to be responsible for interfering in the 2016 and 2018\nelections through the use of cyberattacks and other means.\n\nThe group has a known footprint in each of the locations where the suspected incidents\n[occurred, including in the U.S., and is the only agency within the Russian government that](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/29/directed-energy-attack-probe-485086)\nhas the technology to pull off such attacks, the people said.\n\n“It looks, smells and feels like the GRU,” said one former national security official involved in\nthe investigation. “When you are looking at the landscape, there are very few people who are\nwilling, capable and have the technology. It’s pretty simple forensics.”\n\n\n-----\n\nA current official briefed on the probe said GRU agents are the only ones [we] know have\nthe capability to attack our people like that on our soil.”\n\nIsrael and China may also have the technology, but neither country operates in all of the\nlocations where the incidents were reported, or has shown the desire to attack Americans in\nthis way, another former national security official said.\n\nWhen reached for comment about Burns’ involvement, a CIA spokesperson referred\nPOLITICO to the director’s comments before the House Intelligence Committee last month,\nduring which he said it would be a “very high priority to ensure that my colleagues get the\ncare that they deserve and that we get to the bottom of what caused these incidents and who\nwas responsible.”\n\nIn a statement last month, the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee\ncredited Burns — who has been on the job only since March — with a “renewed focus” on\ndirected-energy attacks.\n\nAfter initially declining to comment, a spokesperson for Director of National Intelligence Avril\nHaines issued a statement to POLITICO noting that the intelligence community (IC) has “no\ndefinitive information about the cause of these incidents” and has not concluded whether a\nforeign actor is responsible.\n\n“Since the beginning of the Biden administration, the IC has intensified efforts to identify the\ncause of these incidents, determine attribution, increase collection efforts, and prevent\nadditional [anomalous health incidents],” said Amanda Schoch, the assistant director of\nnational intelligence for strategic communications.\n\nThe Pentagon launched an investigation into the incidents late last year after then-acting\nDefense Secretary Chris Miller spoke to a combat veteran who suspected he had been\nattacked and was seeking medical attention, POLITICO previously reported.\n\n[Miller told POLITICO last week that the suspected attacks amount to “an act of war.”](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/03/acting-pentagon-chief-miller-attacks-485236)\n\nThe incidents have allegedly occurred all over the world, including in Europe, Miami,\nnorthern Virginia and near the White House, POLITICO reported.\n\nRussian study of this type of technology dates back to the latter part of the 20th century,\nwhen the former Soviet Union opted to pursue “irregular warfare,” where it could counter the\nUnited States in “the seams and the gaps,” rather than in the conventional space, the first\nformer official said. Microwave pulse weapons, which use a form of electromagnetic radiation\nto damage targets, are “the perfect gray zone” weapons because attribution is so difficult, the\nperson said.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile investigators have not determined definitively that these incidents are caused by a\nspecific weapon, some believe any such device would be primarily transported by vehicle,\naccording to the former official and a congressional official. Some could be small enough to\nfit into a large backpack, and an individual can be targeted from 500 to 1,000 yards away.\n\n_Betsy Woodruff Swan and Erin Banco contributed to this report._\n\n_This article has been updated to include comment from ODNI._\n\n\n-----",
