Phishing emails, RDP\nexploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top three initial infection\nvectors for ransomware incidents in 2021. Once a ransomware threat actor has gained code\nexecution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. Note: these infection\nvectors likely remain popular because of the increased use of remote work and schooling\nstarting in 2020 and continuing through 2021. This increase expanded the remote attack\nsurface and left network defenders struggling to keep pace with routine software patching.\nUsing cybercriminal services-for-hire. The market for ransomware became increasingly\n“professional” in 2021, and the criminal business model of ransomware is now well\nestablished. In addition to their increased use of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS),\nransomware threat actors employed independent services to negotiate payments, assist\nvictims with making payments, and arbitrate payment disputes between themselves and other\ncyber criminals. NCSC-UK observed that some ransomware threat actors offered their victims\nthe services of a 24/7 help center to expedite ransom payment and restoration of encrypted\nsystems or data.\nNote: cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom assess\nthat if the ransomware criminal business model continues to yield financial returns for\nransomware actors, ransomware incidents will become more frequent. Every time a ransom is\npaid, it confirms the viability and financial attractiveness of the ransomware criminal business\nmodel. Additionally, cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United\nKingdom note that the criminal business model often complicates attribution because there\nare complex networks of developers, affiliates, and freelancers; it is often difficult to identify\nconclusively the actors behind a ransomware incident.\n\n•\n\nSharing victim information. Eurasian ransomware groups have shared victim information\nwith each other, diversifying the threat to targeted organizations. For example, after\nannouncing its shutdown, the BlackMatter ransomware group transferred its existing victims to\ninfrastructure owned by another group, known as Lockbit 2.0. In October 2021, Conti\n\nPage 2 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n•\n\n•\n\n|\n\nransomware actors began selling access to victims’ networks, enabling follow-on attacks by\nother cyber threat actors.\nShifting away from “big-game” hunting in the United States.\no In the first half of 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and Australia\nobserved ransomware threat actors targeting “big game” organizations—i.e., perceived\nhigh-value organizations and/or those that provide critical services—in several highprofile incidents. These victims included Colonial Pipeline Company, JBS Foods, and\nKaseya Limited. However, ransomware groups suffered disruptions from U.S.\nauthorities in mid-2021. Subsequently, the FBI observed some ransomware threat\nactors redirecting ransomware efforts away from “big-game” and toward mid-sized\nvictims to reduce scrutiny.\no The ACSC observed ransomware continuing to target Australian organizations of all\nsizes, including critical services and “big game,” throughout 2021.\no NCSC-UK observed targeting of UK organizations of all sizes throughout the year, with\nsome “big game” victims. Overall victims included businesses, charities, the legal\nprofession, and public services in the Education, Local Government, and Health\nSectors.\nDiversifying approaches to extorting money. After encrypting victim networks, ransomware\nthreat actors increasingly used “triple extortion” by threatening to (1) publicly release stolen\nsensitive information, (2) disrupt the victim’s internet access, and/or (3) inform the victim’s\npartners, shareholders, or suppliers about the incident. The ACSC continued to observe\n“double extortion” incidents in which a threat actor uses a combination of encryption and data\ntheft to pressure victims to pay ransom demands.\n\nRansomware groups have increased their impact by:\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nTargeting the cloud. Ransomware developers targeted cloud infrastructures to exploit known\nvulnerabilities in cloud applications, virtual machine software, and virtual machine\norchestration software. Ransomware threat actors also targeted cloud accounts, cloud\napplication programming interfaces (APIs), and data backup and storage systems to deny\naccess to cloud resources and encrypt data. In addition to exploiting weaknesses to gain\ndirect access, threat actors sometimes reach cloud storage systems by compromising local\n(on-premises) devices and moving laterally to the cloud systems. Ransomware threat actors\nhave also targeted cloud service providers to encrypt large amounts of customer data.\nTargeting managed service providers. Ransomware threat actors have targeted managed\nservice providers (MSPs). MSPs have widespread and trusted accesses into client\norganizations. By compromising an MSP, a ransomware threat actor could access multiple\nvictims through one initial compromise. Cybersecurity authorities in the United States,\nAustralia, and the United Kingdom assess there will be an increase in ransomware incidents\nwhere threat actors target MSPs to reach their clients.\nAttacking industrial processes. Although most ransomware incidents against critical\ninfrastructure affect business information and technology systems, the FBI observed that\n\nPage 3 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n•\n\n•\n\n|\n\nseveral ransomware groups have developed code designed to stop critical infrastructure or\nindustrial processes.\nAttacking the software supply chain. Globally, in 2021, ransomware threat actors targeted\nsoftware supply chain entities to subsequently compromise and extort their customers.\nTargeting software supply chains allows ransomware threat actors to increase the scale of\ntheir attacks by accessing multiple victims through a single initial compromise.\nTargeting organizations on holidays and weekends. The FBI and CISA observed\ncybercriminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on holidays and\nweekends throughout 2021. Ransomware threat actors may view holidays and weekends—\nwhen offices are normally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network\ndefenders and IT support personnel at victim organizations. For more information, see joint\nFBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory, Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends.\n\nMITIGATIONS\nCybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend\nnetwork defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware\nincidents:\n•\n\n•\n\nKeep all operating systems and software up to date. Timely patching is one of the most\nefficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to\ncybersecurity threats. Regularly check for software updates and end of life (EOL) notifications,\nand prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities. In cloud environments, ensure that\nvirtual machines, serverless applications, and third-party libraries are also patched regularly,\nas doing so is usually the customer’s responsibility. Automate software security scanning and\ntesting when possible. Consider upgrading hardware and software, as necessary, to take\nadvantage of vendor-provided virtualization and security capabilities.\nIf you use RDP or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them closely.\no Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and\nusing virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed\noperationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate\ncredential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private\nnetwork (VPN), virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and\nsecure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor\nremote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of\nattempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused\nremote access/RDP ports.\no Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable\nports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP\nTransmission Control Protocol Port 3389).\no Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access\nservers that are necessary, and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e.,\nSMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.\n\nPage 4 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n|\n\no\no\no\n•\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your\norganization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software\nor hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\nImplement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems\nto execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.\nOpen document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content\nfrom running.\n\nImplement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among\nusers about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening\nsuspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and\nspearphishing emails.\nRequire MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that\naccess critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and\ndomain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be\nreused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have\naccess. Note: devices with local admin accounts should implement a password policy,\npossibly using a password management solution (e.g., Local Administrator Password Solution\n[LAPS]), that requires strong, unique passwords for each admin account.\nIf using Linux, use a Linux security module (such as SELinux, AppArmor, or SecComp)\nfor defense in depth. The security modules may prevent the operating system from making\narbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against ransomware, as well as\nagainst remote code execution (RCE).\nProtect cloud storage by backing up to multiple locations, requiring MFA for access,\nand encrypting data in the cloud. If using cloud-based key management for encryption,\nensure that storage and key administration roles are separated.\n\nMalicious cyber actors use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility\nand mapping. To limit an adversary’s ability to learn an organization’s enterprise environment and to\nmove laterally, take the following actions:\n•\n\n•\n\nSegment networks. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by\ncontrolling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting\nadversary lateral movement. Organizations with an international footprint should be aware that\nconnectivity between their overseas arms can expand their threat surface; these organizations\nshould implement network segmentation between international divisions where appropriate.\nFor example, the ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which\nAustralian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents\naffecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions (outside their control).\nImplement end-to-end encryption. Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) can\nprevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat actors\nfrom gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack.\n\nPage 5 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n|\n\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the\nindicated ransomware with a network-monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the\nransomware, leverage a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral\nmovement on a network. Endpoint detection and response tools are particularly useful for\ndetecting lateral connections as they have insight into unusual network connections for each\nhost. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are also\nable to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with early stages of\nransomware deployment.\nDocument external remote connections. Organizations should document approved\nsolutions for remote management and maintenance. If an unapproved solution is installed on\na workstation, the organization should investigate it immediately. These solutions have\nlegitimate purposes, so they will not be flagged by antivirus vendors.\nImplement time-based access for privileged accounts. For example, the just-in-time\naccess method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of\nthe principle of least privilege (as well as the zero trust model) by setting network-wide policy\nto automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level. As needed, individual\nusers can submit requests through an automated process that enables access to a system for\na set timeframe. In cloud environments, just-in-time elevation is also appropriate and may be\nimplemented using per-session federated claims or privileged access management tools.\nEnforce principle of least privilege through authorization policies. Minimize unnecessary\nprivileges for identities. Consider privileges assigned to human identities as well as nonperson (e.g., software) identities. In cloud environments, non-person identities (service\naccounts or roles) with excessive privileges are a key vector for lateral movement and data\naccess. Account privileges should be clearly defined, narrowly scoped, and regularly audited\nagainst usage patterns.\nReduce credential exposure. Accounts and their credentials present on hosts can enable\nfurther compromise of a network. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting where\naccounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential protection\nfeatures—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for lateral movement\nand privilege escalation.\nDisable unneeded command-line utilities; constrain scripting activities and\npermissions, and monitor their usage. Privilege escalation and lateral movement often\ndepend on software utilities that run from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run\nthese tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. Organizations\nshould also disable macros sent from external sources via Group Policy.\nMaintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test\nbackup and restoration. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of\noperations or at least minimize potential downtime from an attack as well as protect against\ndata losses. In cloud environments, consider leveraging native cloud service provider backup\nand restoration capabilities. To further secure cloud backups, consider separation of account\nroles to prevent an account that manages the backups from being used to deny or degrade\nthe backups should the account become compromised.\n\nPage 6 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n\n•\n\n|\n\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and\ncovers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Consider storing encryption keys outside\nthe cloud. Cloud backups that are encrypted using a cloud key management service (KMS)\ncould be affected should the cloud environment become compromised.\nCollect telemetry from cloud environments. Ensure that telemetry from cloud\nenvironments—including network telemetry (e.g., virtual private cloud [VPC] flow logs), identity\ntelemetry (e.g., account sign-on, token usage, federation configuration changes), and\napplication telemetry (e.g., file downloads, cross-organization sharing)—is retained and visible\nto the security team.\n\nNote: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology\nnetworks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices\nfor Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more recommendations, including\nmitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity fall\nvictim to ransomware.\n\nRESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, cybersecurity authorities in the United States,\nAustralia, and the United Kingdom recommend organizations:\n•\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nFollow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information\nSharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nScan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free\nof malware. This should be performed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing\nbackups to potential compromise.\nReport incidents to respective cybersecurity authorities:\no U.S. organizations should report incidents immediately to the FBI at a local FBI Field\nOffice, CISA at us-cert.cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service at a U.S. Secret\nService Field Office.\no Australian organizations should report incidents to the ASD’s ACSC via cyber.gov.au\nor call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1).\no UK organizations should report incidents to NCSC-UK via report.ncsc.gov.uk and/or\nAction Fraud, the United Kingdom’s fraud and cyber reporting centre, via\nactionfraud.police.uk.\nApply incident response best practices found in the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Technical\nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the\ncybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nNote: cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom strongly\ndiscourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Criminal activity is motivated by financial gain, so\npaying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations (or re-target the same\norganization) or encourage cyber criminals to engage in the distribution of ransomware. Paying the\n\nPage 7 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n|\n\nransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. Additionally, reducing the\nfinancial gain of ransomware threat actors will help disrupt the ransomware criminal business model.\nAdditionally, NCSC-UK reminds UK organizations that paying criminals is not condoned by the UK\nGovernment. In instances where a ransom paid, victim organizations often cease engagement with\nauthorities, who then lose visibility of the payments made. While it continues to prove challenging, the\nNCSC-UK has supported UK Government efforts by identifying needed policy changes—including\nmeasures about the cyber insurance industry and ransom payments—that could reduce the threat of\nransomware.\n\nRESOURCES\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nFor more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware,\nrefer to StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, U.S. whole-of-government webpage providing\nransomware resources and alerts.\nCISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered\nset of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and\nrecover from a ransomware incident.\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure\norganizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By\nrequesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and\nmitigate attack vectors.\nThe U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program offers a reward of up to\n$10 million for reports of foreign government malicious activity against U.S. critical\ninfrastructure. See the RFJ website for more information and how to report information\nsecurely.\nThe ACSC recommends organizations implement eight essential mitigation strategies from the\nACSC’s Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents as a cybersecurity baseline. These\nstrategies, known as the “Essential Eight,” make it much harder for adversaries to compromise\nsystems.\nRefer to the ACSC’s practical guides on how to protect yourself against ransomware attacks\nand what to do if you are held to ransom at cyber.gov.au.\nRefer to NCSC-UK’s guides on how to protect yourself against ransomware attacks and how\nto respond to and recover from them at ncsc.gov.uk/ransomware/home.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] United States Federal Bureau of Investigation\n[2] United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n[3] United States National Security Agency\n[4] Australian Cyber Security Centre\n[5] United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre\n\nPage 8 of 9 | Product ID: AA22-040A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK\n|\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
