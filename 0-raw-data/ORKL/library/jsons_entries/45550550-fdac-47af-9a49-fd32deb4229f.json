    "plain_text": "# Bamital Botnet Takedown Is Successful; Cleanup Underway\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2013/02/22/bamital-botnet-takedown-is-successful-cleanup-underway/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2013/02/22/bamital-botnet-takedown-is-successful-cleanup-underway/)**\n\nFebruary 22, 2013\n\n_The following is a post by Richard Domingues Boscovich, Assistant General Counsel,_\n_[Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/presskits/dcu/)_\n\n[Two weeks after Microsoft and Symantec’s collaborative takedown of the Bamital botnet, I’m](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/02/06/microsoft-and-symantec-take-down-bamital-botnet-that-hijacks-online-searches.aspx)\npleased to report that the Bamital botnet remains offline. Additionally, since Microsoft was\nable to receive all of the computer traffic that had been connecting to the Bamital botnet, we\nare also seeing very positive cleanup results firsthand. For instance, our preliminary data\nshows that as of February 18, approximately 32 percent of the infected computers we hadth\nobserved since the February 6 takedown are no longer part of the Bamital botnet. Thisth\npromising reduction rate is largely due to the takedown of the botnet and victims taking\naction in response to the proactive notification process and available cleanup tools. We\nexpect that the number of victim notifications and cleaned computers will improve as we finetune our process over the course of the next several weeks.\n\n\nI also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the cooperation of the Indian Computer\nEmergency Response Team (CERT-In). Bamital’s command and control structure was using\nseveral “.In” top level domains to control infected computers around the world. CERT-In\nplayed an integral role by implementing a crucial component of the notification process that\nallowed us to contact and offer cleanup tools to victims affected by Bamital. CERT-In’s\nsupport is the reason why this cleanup effort has been effective. Additionally, we will soon be\nworking with Internet service providers and Computer Emergency Response Teams around\nthe world, as we have in the past, to help rescue those remaining computers infected with\nthis malware.\n\nMeanwhile, we also have positive news to share on the legal side. Early last week we\nentered into a confidential settlement agreement in the case with defendant John Doe 12.\nWe believe the agreement is in the best interest of the case. Finally, at a preliminary\ninjunction hearing on February 13, the Federal Court for the Eastern District of Virginiath\ngranted Microsoft’s motion and entered an order granting the preliminary injunction. The\ngranting of this motion helps to keep the domains that the bot-herders used to operate the\nbotnet offline, and allows Microsoft to continue pointing all of the malicious IP addresses to\nMicrosoft’s domain name system (DNS).\n\nHelping protect people is at the forefront of Microsoft’s proactive fight against botnets and\nother forms of cybercrime. We do this by applying a three-pronged approach which includes\nhelping advance security in our products and services, taking proactive, disruptive measures\n\n\n-----\n\nto help protect people, and educating people about the dangers of cybercrime and how they\ncan protect themselves from online threats. As DCU recently held its fourth annual Digital\nCrimes Consortium (DCC) in Barcelona, Spain, a week-long conference that provides a rare\nopportunity for law enforcement and members of the technology security community from\naround the world to discuss the latest cybercrime issues and challenges, I want to stress that\ncybercrime cannot be fought alone. However, with continued successes in cooperation\namong all players – industry, academic researchers, law enforcement agencies and\ngovernments worldwide – the global community has the power to turn the tide in the fight\nagainst cybercrime. I look forward to continuing to work with partners like Symantec and\nCERT-In to shut down cybercriminal networks and protect innocent people around the world.\n\nTags: [botnets,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/tag/botnets/) [Digital Crimes Unit](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/tag/digital-crimes-unit/)\n\n\n-----",
