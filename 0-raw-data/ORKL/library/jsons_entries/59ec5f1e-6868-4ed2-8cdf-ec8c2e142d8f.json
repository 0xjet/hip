The ransomware gang members do not believe that the arrest may\nlead to any significant changes\n\nOverall, criminals conclude that this arrest was a publicity operation aimed at a formal\npublic demonstration of Russia's political intent to cooperate with the West on\ncombating ransomware, by targeting low-tier members of an already defunct group. As\nsuch, this is a single operation and not a defined policy that can affect the cybercrime\ndomain.\n\nThe timing of this arrest is coincidental with the recent U.S.-Russia security talks and\ncan be directly related to the political discussions within the geopolitical relationships\nbetween the countries.\n\nThe arrests are related to the hacking group charged only so far for the \"illicit money\ncontrol/laundering\" and not hacking. This may be defined by the domestic policies\nwhich Russian applies to de-criminalize hacking and criminalize cryptocurrency\nanonymity. Such policies aim at bringing a stronger state control over the ransomware\nmarket.\n\n\n-----\n\n_(The official announcement by the FSB clearly state that the arrest has been conducted on_\n_the grounds of the request from the U.S. security officials)_\n\nVideo of the purported arrest:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=P_0j2k9aqDo&feature=emb_logo\n\n**Adversarial Perspective: Underground Insights**\n\nToday AdvIntel has extensively tracked any underground chatter and most importantly, the\nreaction of other ransomware groups in order to identify if this arrest can significantly shift the\nransomware ecosystem. Our preliminary findings identify a clear consensus within the\nransomware community that the arrest itself is not yet significant since it is a part of a longterm process initiated by Russian law enforcement since Spring 2021. A process associated\nwith high-profile ransomware attacks against the U.S. critical infrastructure and inherently\nrelated to the broader geopolitical context of US-Russia relationships.\n\nIndeed, previously AdvIntel has identified private statements by ransomware top-affiliates\nand leaders in the groups including Avaddon, Darkside, HIVE, and BlackMatter, who\nclaimed that since Spring 2021, the Russian security apparatus has been applying gradual\npressure on ransomware. For instance, high-profile actors directly affiliated with the\n**Avaddon gang claimed that it was a direct pressure by the FSB that forced the group to**\nrelease security keys. Similar statements were made on underground forums regarding\n**Darkside and REvil when the groups released attack-related information. Even Conti**\nransomware, which is known for its resilience, has expressed concerns over potential\npressure from Russian law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs such, the ransomware community remains skeptical of the arrest. AdvIntel s sensitive\nsource intelligence confirmed that Russian-speaking criminal actors agree that the\nindividuals who were arrested today are most likely low-tier affiliates who have directly linked\nto the REvil auxiliary operations such as money transfers, money laundering, and other\nsupport activities that follow ransomware attacks. In other words, threat actors are confident\nthat neither developers nor skillful pentesters of REvil have been arrested based on the\nAdvIntel insights into the actual affiliate ecosystem.\n\nThe broader non-ransomware underground chatter is characterized by generic comments\nand moderate support of REvil's arrest. This support is due to the group's poor reputation\nacross the Russian-speaking cybercrime. Some cheer since Revil was known across the\nunderground as a group scamming their affiliates, in this sense, the forum actors believe that\nthe arrest indeed serves some sort of justice.\n\nThe underground community agrees that REvil has been continuously making strategic\nmistakes by focusing on political publicity, committing political attacks, and attracting media\nand public attention. Actors conclude that if a certain group remains within a traditional\ncybercrime pass, i.e. being strictly non-public and for-profit, such a group can sustain\npeacefully and continue to operate.\n\n_(The moderator of the XSS and Exploit forums who is responsible for audit and review of all_\n_ransomware and malware partnerships on these two major forums has been one of the most_\n_consistent critics of REvil)_\n\nActors from the older generation of cybercrime recall their traditional comment that\nransomware is a form of intellectual primitivism, as it does not require sophistication. (read\nmore in AdvIntel’s research: [DarkWeb Insights] The Digital \"Thief War\" : How COVID-19\nPandemic Triggered a Generational Conflict). They add that due to this primitivism it was not\nsurprising that ransomware operators were caught so easily.\n\nOverall, criminals conclude that this arrest was a publicity operation aimed at a formal public\ndemonstration of Russia's political intent to cooperate with the West on combating\nransomware, by targeting low-tier members of an already defunct group. As such, this is a\nsingle operation and not a defined policy that can affect the cybercrime domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_AdvIntel s analysis: Geopolitics and cryptocurrencies; is Russia a Safe Haven for_**\n**_hackers?_**\n\n**_De-Escalation Rollercoaster_**\n\nThe timing of this arrest is coincidental with the recent US-Russia security talks and can be\ndirectly related to the political discussions within the geopolitical relationships between the\ncountries.\n\n_(The United States and Russia meet for highest level security talks on January 10, 2022, in_\n_Geneva; image source: Associated Press)_\n\n[AdvIntel previously noted on this connection between geopolitics and cybercrime in the](https://www.advintel.io/post/the-rise-demise-of-multi-million-ransomware-business-empire)\ncontext of the Avaddon group security key release. Since May 2021, we observe a clear\nintervention of politics into the cybercrime domain, including multiple statements made by the\nRussian government, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by President Putin\npersonally about establishing an international Russian-American initiative to establish a joint\ncybersecurity landscape. The Russian officials likely see this as a tool of de-escalating the\nUS-Russian relationships.\n\nToday’s situation mimics the May 2021 case, when troops were also concentrated on the\n[Ukrainian border (cyberattacks against Ukrainian government entities occurred on the day of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/multiple-ukrainian-government-websites-hacked-and-defaced/)\nREvil arrest), and Russia was facing threats of domestic turbulence. Indeed, the Russian\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment traditionally goes through rounds of escalation and de-escalation with the West.\nJust like in Spring 2021, the Kremlin may now be aiming to create a framework of stability in\nthe international arena and cybersecurity - a controversial space or the Russia-U.S.\nrelationship is once again on the frontlines of this de-escalation agenda.\n\n_(The REvil arrest happened on the same day as a massive attack on Ukrainian the websites_\n_of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies that are_\n_temporarily down. The attack happened during another round of escalation of tensions on_\n_Ukraine-Russia border)_\n\n**_REvil & the War on Crypto_**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is even more interesting is the domestic context. AdvIntel s CEO Vitali Kremez noted\nthat the arrests are related to the hacking group charged only so far for the \"illicit money\ncontrol/laundering\" and not hacking.\n\n_(https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1482008331136942081)_\n\nThis may be a consequence of deliberate legal modeling which Russia has been using since\nthe 2000th.\n\nIndeed, the Russian Criminal Code’s Articles 272, 273, and further, which define punishment\nfor hacking only presume minimum sentences of 1 year for “Illegal access to computer\ninformation protected by law, if this act has caused the destruction, blocking, modification or\ncopying of computer information”. The sentence can reach 2-3 years if the crime was\ncommitted by a group of people and for-profit and 4 years if the accused has performed\ninsider crime by using their position in an entity.\n\nThis way, the specific development of the Russian criminal code in regards to hacking,\nmakes long-term sentences of hackers unlikely. (Note: the Russian criminal code also limits\nthe accumulation of sentence years based on different charges, in other words, the lengths\nof the sentence is defined by the strongest charge and not by the combination of different\ncharges which do not sum up)\n\nThis can explain why REvil members were charged with the illicit funds' charge that has a\nmaximum sentence of seven years, and this may not be a simple judicial compilation but a\nconsequence of Russian domestic policies.\n\n\n-----\n\nPreviously, AdvIntel has investigated a major change in Russian legislation regarding\ncryptocurrencies: New Russian Crypto Law - A Government Tool to Take Control Over the\nDarkWeb Market? We predicted that by introducing the January 1, 2021, law regulating\ncryptocurrencies, the Russian government aims to seek control over the ransomware sector\nof the illicit economy that became extremely prolific over the past two years. We assessed\nthat by establishing this crypto law, the Russian government built a legal foundation to take\nover ransomware “businesses”. Tightened on cryptocurrency flows and obligated to report\ntheir balances, hackers will no longer be able to “legally” stay in the shade. The criminal\nenterprise might be easily taken down completely or more likely to be obligated to cooperate\nwith the government for its financial and national good.\n\nInterestingly enough, on January 13, 2022, the day before the REvil arrest, Alexander\nBastrykin, the Chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee and one of the top\ngovernment officials [demanded mandatory deanonymization of all cryptocurrency holders in](https://rg.ru/2022/01/13/bastrykin-prizyvaet-vvesti-obiazatelnuiu-identifikaciiu-polzovatelej-kriptovaliut.html)\nRussia. He specifically stated that the anonymity associated with cryptocurrency manifests in\nmajor risks for public safety.\n\nAll these are signs that domestically Russia is aiming to keep its hacking-related legislation\nmild and ambiguously defined, while significantly cracking down on cryptocurrencies. This\nway, loyal hackers can still operate freely, while those who are chosen as a target of the state\ncan be charged with illicit funds law within the broader context of criminalization of\ncryptocurrency use. REvil’s arrest may be defined by these dynamics.\n\n**Disrupt ransomware attacks & prevent data stealing with AdvIntel’s threat disruption**\n**solutions.
