Some of them are\nbelow (source: Wikipedia):\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: ShinuHunters Group linked data breaches. Source –\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShinyHunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShinyHunters)\n\nFigure 4: ShinuHunters Group linked data breaches. Source –\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShinyHunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShinyHunters)\nIt should be noted that the group is being investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies\nworldwide, including the FBI.\n\n## Failed Extortion Attempt?\n\nThe research community has seen a change in its tactics in the last few months. The\nShinyHuntes group extorts their victims and often shares their RaidForum profile and media\npress on the credibility of their claims. If a victim refuses to pay the extortion, the group puts\nthem for sale on cybercrime forums.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: ShinyHunters Profile on RaidForums Website\n\n## Conclusion \n\nThe ShinyHunters group is a known and credible threat actor. The claims made by the group\ncan not be discounted, given their history. On this issue, whether they were able to breach\nAT&T’s infrastructure, found a misconfigured databases on the internet, or compromised the\nthird party with AT&T information, time will tell us.\n\n**Update: “Based on our investigation today, the information that appeared in an**\n**internet chat room does not appear to have come from our systems.” AT&T**\n**commented on the issue.**\n\n**If the claims are genuine, this might be one of the most sensitive data breaches of**\n**2021.**\n\nAt the time of writing this blog, there are no known reports or disclosure by AT&T on this\nalleged data breach.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control\nagainst attackers We recommend that our readers follow the suggestions given below:\n\n\n-----\n\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other\nconnected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected\ndevices.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their\nauthenticity.\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate\nnetwork.\n\n## About Us\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves](https://cyble.com/)\nfrom cybercrimes and exposure in the Darkweb.
