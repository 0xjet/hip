Attacks from organized criminals, foreign countries, political\nhacktivists, and others not only erode public trust in targeted government\nentities, but can also seriously impact government operations and the\nability to deliver critical functions—not to mention the financial cost and\nrisk to sensitive information and vital infrastructure. This all means that\ncyber security is a large and growing concern for governments worldwide.\n\nIncreasingly, federal, state, and local governments are targets as threat\nactors attempt to steal or manipulate sensitive data or disrupt operations.\nThis was highlighted in December 2020 when news emerged of the\n[SolarWinds supply chain attack in which multiple parts of the U.S. Federal](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds)\nGovernment, NATO, the UK government, and the European Parliament were\nimpacted. The incident, which also impacted thousands of organizations in\nthe private sector, was reported to be among the worst cyber-espionage\nincidents ever suffered by the U.S.\n\n\n-----\n\nDifferent types of groups or individuals can initiate attacks against the government sector, and their motivations\nvary widely. Foreign nations may seek to obtain sensitive information about government operations; criminals\nmay steal government employee data to hold for ransom or to sell and commit fraud; and hacktivists motivated\nby ideology rather than profit may seek to disrupt or gather information to further their agenda. In addition, types\nof attack can also vary widely, ranging from ransomware, to email-based social engineering attacks, to zero-day\nexploits, and supply chain attacks.\n\nWhat is the Government Sector?\n\nAs the government sector is vast and incorporates a wide range of entities, for this paper we chose to use\nthe Public Administration sector as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\n[Sector 92: Public Administration is defined as consisting of establishments of federal, state, and local government](https://www.naics.com/six-digit-naics/?code=92)\nagencies that administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority\nover other institutions within a given area.\n\nSome of the key areas covered in this paper include the following:\n\n   - Examples of Attacks: Some recent examples of attacks against government entities broken up into common\nattack types/motivations.\n\n   - Who is Attacking? A look at some prominent advanced persistent threat (APT) groups with a focus on\ntargeting the government sector.\n\n   - Malicious Activity Trends: Key trends taken from Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO),\nmetrics.\n\n   - Case Studies: A detailed look at two cases worked on by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team.\n\n   - How to Protect Your Network: Protection and mitigation information that can be used by organizations in the\ngovernment sector to protect their networks.\n\n### Examples of Attacks\n\nWhile cyber attacks against the government sector are far too numerous to list, in recent times there have been\na number of notable incidents that highlight the range of attacks this sector is subject to, as well as the various\ntactics employed.\n\n##### Ransomware\n\nArgentinian Border Crossing Shut Down\n\n[In August 2020, Argentina’s immigration agency (Dirección Nacional de Migraciones) suffered a ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-hits-argentinian-government-demands-4-million/)\nthat forced it to close the country’s border crossing. The Netwalker ransomware (Ransom.Netwalker), also known\nas Mailto, infected a number of servers at the immigration agency, which led to it deciding to completely shut down\nnetworks used by immigration offices and control posts. This meant that border crossings were suspended for\nseveral hours. The malware operators initially demanded a $2 million ransom, however, this increased to $4 million\nafter the Argentinian government refused to negotiate with the criminals.\n\nIreland’s National Health Service\n\n[On May 14, 2021, Ireland’s national health service, the Health Service Executive (HSE), was hit with a ransomware](https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/HSE_Conti_140521_UPDATE.pdf)\n[attack that led to it having to shut down its IT systems. The attack impacted all its national and local services.](https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/HSE_Conti_140521_UPDATE.pdf)\n\nThe attack was committed by a suspected Russian cyber crime group using the Conti ransomware (Ransom.Conti).\nThe threat actors claimed they had access to the HSE network for two weeks, stole 700 GB of unencrypted files,\nand demanded a $20 million ransom. The Irish government said it would not be paying any ransom. Shortly after\n[this announcement, the Conti attackers provided a free decryptor but warned they would still publish stolen patient](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-gives-hse-ireland-free-decryptor-still-selling-data/)\ndata online unless a ransom was paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ireland’s Department of Health (the parent department of the HSE) was also targeted by the Conti gang. The](https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2021/0516/1221933-dept-of-health/)\ndepartment shut down its systems following the incident but Ireland’s Minister for Communications said that the\nattack “wasn’t as extensive” as the HSE attack and was intercepted earlier.\n\n##### Espionage\n\nSolarWinds Supply Chain Attack\n\nIn mid-December 2020, news broke of the SolarWinds supply chain attack. In this particular case, rather than\nattacking the targets directly, the hackers compromised a third-party software provider (SolarWinds), accessing its\nbuild system and sneaking malicious code into updates to popular software Orion.\n\nBy compromising the update mechanism for SolarWinds’ Orion software, the attackers were able to deliver a\nbackdoor Trojan known as Sunburst (Backdoor.Sunburst). While thousands of organizations downloaded the\nTrojanized software update, the attackers were only interested in a relatively small selection. The nature of supply\nchain attacks mean they are indiscriminate, with any user of the compromised software at risk of infection. The\nattackers then get to pick and choose from the infected organizations, focusing on high-value targets for, in this\ncase, the purpose of espionage.\n\nA number of key U.S. federal agencies downloaded the malicious update, including the Department of Commerce,\nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department. The Justice\n[Department later revealed that around 3% of its Office 365 mailboxes had been accessed by the attackers behind](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-statement-solarwinds-update)\n[the attack. NATO, the UK government, and the European Parliament were also impacted by the SolarWinds attack.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-statement-solarwinds-update)\n\nIn April 2021, three months after news first broke of the attack, the U.S. government said that SVR, the Russian\n[Foreign Intelligence Service (aka Fritillary, APT 29, Cozy Bear) was responsible for the SolarWinds attack. The U.S.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)\nimposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia as a response.\n\nSymantec carried out extensive research into the SolarWinds attack, including detailed analysis of additional\n[malware (Teardrop and Raindrop) used by the attackers and insights into the command and control process used.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sunburst-supply-chain-attack-solarwinds)\n[All this research, along with protection information, can be found on our dedicated blog page.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds)\n\nDragonfly Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities\n\nIn October 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of\n[Investigation (FBI) released a joint statement revealing attacks carried out by a Russian state-sponsored hacking](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a)\n[group against U.S. government networks. The hacking group was Dragonfly (aka Energetic Bear, Berserk Bear,](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks)\nCrouching Yeti, Koala).\n\nThe attackers had been targeting dozens of state and local government networks since at least February 2020. The\ngroup successfully compromised network infrastructure and exfiltrated data from at least two victim servers by\ncombining exploits for known VPN appliances and Windows vulnerabilities. The hackers used the vulnerabilities to\nbreach networking gear, pivot to internal networks, elevate privileges, and steal sensitive data.\n\n[Targeted devices included Citrix access gateways (CVE-2019-19781), Microsoft Exchange email servers](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\n[(CVE-2020-0688), Exim mail agents (CVE 2019-10149), and Fortinet SSL VPNs (CVE-2018-13379). To move laterally](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-0688)\nacross compromised networks, the attackers used the Zerologon elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in Windows\n[Servers (CVE-2020-1472) to access and steal Windows Active Directory (AD) credentials.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472)\n\n##### Denial of Service\n\nBelgian Government Knocked Offline by DDoS Attack\n\n[In May 2021, Belgium’s government was hit with a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that knocked](https://therecord.media/belgiums-government-network-goes-down-after-massive-ddos-attack/)\nmost of its network offline, including public-facing websites and internal systems. The attack targeted Belnet, a\nstate-owned ISP that provides connectivity and infrastructure for the country’s government and public sector\norganizations. At least 200 public organizations were affected by the attack, including the country’s tax portal,\nremote learning systems used by schools and its COVID vaccine registration portal\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the attack has yet to be attributed to anyone, several Belgian politicians and political observers suggested\nthat the incident may have been politically motivated.\n\n### Who is Attacking?\n\nAs well as ransomware actors out for financial gain and hacktivists with a goal of making political statements,\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) groups are one of the biggest threats to the government sector. These highly\nskilled and typically state-sponsored threat actors are well resourced and use sophisticated hacking techniques to\ngain access to target networks. Because of the level of effort needed to carry out these attacks, APTs are usually\nleveled at high-value targets, such as those in the government sector.\n\nThe following selection of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been known to target the government\nsector. Each APT group is listed under the nation state it is believed to receive direction and support from.\n\n##### Iran\n\nCrambus\n\nBelieved to have been active since at least 2014, Crambus (aka APT34, Oilrig, Twisted Kitten) is known to have\ntargeted government agencies, financial institutions, and technology companies in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United\nArab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the U.S., and Turkey.\n\nThe group delivers a custom backdoor known as Heherminth via spear-phishing attacks, targeting individuals\nwithin organizations of interest using malicious Office documents with embedded macros to install a backdoor. The\ngroup may also send emails containing links to websites registered by the attackers and employ social-engineering\ntactics to trick victims into downloading and installing the backdoor.\n\nThe goal of the group is cyber espionage, focusing on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state\ninterests.\n\n##### China\n\nCicada\n\nThe Chinese government-linked group known as Cicada (aka APT10, Stone Panda, Cloud Hopper) has been active\nsince at least 2009 and is believed to be involved in espionage-type operations. Cicada traditionally customizes\npublicly available malware in concert with dual-use tools during operations. The group leverages a number of\ntechniques during the initial stages of attack, such as targeted email, strategic website compromise, and supply\nchain attacks.\n\nCicada is known to target numerous sectors, including government, aerospace, energy, engineering, financial,\nhealthcare, IT, manufacturing, media, and research. The group is known to target the following regions: Australia,\nChina, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, the UK, and the U.S. However, since 2016, Cicada appears to have mainly\nfocused on targeting organizations in Japan across numerous sectors, including government, media, research, and\n[transport. In November 2020, Symantec uncovered evidence that Cicada was behind a large-scale attack campaign](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)\n[targeting multiple Japanese companies, including subsidiaries located in as many as 17 regions around the globe in](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)\na likely intelligence-gathering operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nCicada is known to use a combination of generally available malware and tools during operations, including the\nfollowing:\n\n  - Backdoor.Darkmoon (Specific configurations)\n\n  - Backdoor.ChChes (Exclusively used)\n\n  - Backdoor.Korplug (Specific configurations)\n\n  - Trojan.Redleavy (Exclusively used)\n\n  - Trojan.Wimhop (A modified version of wmiexec.vbs available on GitHub)\n\n  - Backdoor.Hartip\n\n  - Tcping (Publically available tool to check connectivity)\n\n  - Csvde (Microsoft tool for Active Directory)\n\n  - PsExec (Microsoft tool for executing commands/files on a remote host)\n\n  - Netsess (Publically available tool to enumerate NetBIOS sessions)\n\n  - Trojan.Agentemis (aka Cobalt Strike)\n\nBudworm\n\nBudworm (aka APT27, Lucky Mouse, Emissary Panda) has been active since at least July 2013.\n\nThe Chinese government-linked group uses the malware families Backdoor.Korplug, Trojan.Browrat, and Hyperbro\nin its attacks. Budworm has been known to leverage strategic website compromises and spear-phishing attacks to\ntarget victims in the aerospace, defense, government, and technology industries.\n\n[According to ESET, in early 2021 Budworm began exploiting several Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ESET_Industry_Report_Government.pdf)\n[vulnerabilities. The group targeted multiple government networks in the Middle East and wider organizations in](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/microsoft-exchange-server-protection)\nCentral Asia for the purpose of cyber espionage. The group used the email server access, and the compromise\nof Microsoft SharePoint, to deploy a newly updated modular toolkit known as SysUpdate, which is designed to\nprovide on-demand malicious capabilities.\n\n##### Russia\n\nSwallowtail\n\nSwallowtail (aka APT28, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Tsar Team, Sednit) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group\nthat has been active since at least January 2007. The group was initially known for traditional, information-stealing\nespionage campaigns, targeting governments in the U.S. and Europe. It became involved in more overt, disruptive\noperations in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe group has been known to employ a variety of methods to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks.\nThese include spear-phishing emails, watering hole websites, infected storage devices, and exploitation of software\nvulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT28 used spear-phishing emails that tricked recipients\ninto supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. The group then used these stolen\ncredentials to gain access to email accounts and steal the contents. This information was later leaked.\n\nSymantec has seen APT28 use a number of custom malware tools, including:\n\n  - Infostealer.Sofacy\n\n  - OSX.Sofacy\n\n  - Trojan.Sofacy\n\n  - Trojan.Modruner\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December 2020, the Norwegian police secret service (PST) stated that it believed Swallowtail was likely\n[responsible for hacking the email accounts of the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget). In the attack, which took](https://www.zdnet.com/article/norway-says-russian-hacking-group-apt28-is-behind-august-2020-parliament-hack/)\nplace in August 2020, the hackers gained access to the Parliament’s email system and accessed inboxes for\nStortinget employees and elected officials.\n\nFritillary\n\nFritillary (aka APT29, Cozy Bear, the Dukes) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group and has been active\nsince at least January 2010. Like APT28, it initially confined itself to spying campaigns, focusing on governments,\nthe military, and think tanks in the U.S. and Europe. It later became involved in more subversive operations and was\nimplicated (along with APT28) in disruptive attacks prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAPT29 usually relies on spear-phishing emails to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. During the\n2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT29 sent spear-phishing emails to more than 1,000 targeted individuals,\nincluding some U.S. government personnel. These emails contained malicious links which, if clicked, would lead to\nmalware being installed on the target’s computer. This allowed APT29 to compromise a political party’s systems\nand steal emails from several accounts on the network.\n\nSymantec has seen APT29 use a number of custom malware tools, including:\n\n  - Trojan.Cozer\n\n  - Trojan.Seaduke\n\n  - Trojan.Dionisduke\n\n  - Backdoor.Netduke\n\n  - Trojan.Powerduke\n\n  - Backdoor.Miniduke\n\nMore recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and\n[the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of continued attacks coordinated by the](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/26/fbi-dhs-cisa-joint-advisory-russian-foreign-intelligence-service)\n[Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) (aka Fritillary) against U.S. and foreign organizations. The agencies said](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/26/fbi-dhs-cisa-joint-advisory-russian-foreign-intelligence-service)\nthis activity, which included the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise (see Examples of Attacks), primarily\ntargets government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information technology companies\nand seeks to gather intelligence information.\n\n[For more information on the Swallowtail and Fritillary groups, read our blog Subverting Democracy: How Cyber](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/election-security/election-hacking-faq)\n[Attackers Try to Hack the Vote.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/election-security/election-hacking-faq)\n\n##### North Korea\n\nSpringtail\n\nSpringtail (aka Kimsuky, Thallium, Nickle Foxcroft) has been active since at least 2012. The group is believed to be\n[operating on behalf of the North Korean government.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-301a)\n\nSpringtail uses the malware families Trojan.Destfallen, Trojan.Kisuky, and Bloodhound.hwp.5 in its attacks. The group\nis known to use social engineering tactics, spear-phishing emails, and watering hole attacks to compromise its\nvictims in order to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the North Korean government.\n\nSpringtail targets individuals and organizations in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. Springtail specifically targets\nindividuals identified as experts in various fields, think tanks, and South Korean government entities. The group\nfocuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean\npeninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.\n\n[In September 2020 it was reported that Springtail attempted to hack 11 officials of the United Nations Security](https://www.zdnet.com/article/north-korea-has-tried-to-hack-11-officials-of-the-un-security-council/)\n[Council.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/north-korea-has-tried-to-hack-11-officials-of-the-un-security-council/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn November 2020, Cybereason identified a new modular spyware suite dubbed KGH_SPY and a new malware\n[strain dubbed CSPY Downloader being employed in attacks by Springtail. The group was observed targeting a](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/back-to-the-future-inside-the-kimsuky-kgh-spyware-suite)\nwide array of victim organizations in the U.S., Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. The target organizations\nincluded pharmaceutical and research companies working on COVID-19 therapies, government and defense\norganizations, journalists, and various human rights groups.\n\n### Malicious Activity Trends\n\nIn order to assess general levels of malicious activity, we examined telemetry from 1,100 government customers\nover the past 15 months, namely all of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFigure 1: Malware Detections by Month, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n30,000\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar\n2020 2021\n\nMalware detections in these organizations trended downwards in this time period. While the trend is welcome\nnews, it shouldn’t be cause for complacency since the decline was relatively small. Secondly, the biggest sources of\nrisk to government organizations—espionage and ransomware—tend to be low prevalence but high impact threats.\n\n##### Ransomware\n\nWhile the number of ransomware detections is showing a downward trend, this can be misleading as the number\nof victims is still considerable and, due to changing tactics from ransomware operators, the impact from successful\nattacks can be devastating.\n\nIt should also be noted that the data shown in Figure 1 is only a representative sample of the overall number of\nattacks involving ransomware. Most targeted ransomware operators, for example, recompile their ransomware for\nevery new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack may be blocked by a generic or\nmachine learning-generated detection signature rather than a detection linked to that ransomware family.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Ransomware Detections for Govenment Sector, January 2020 to March 2021\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar\n2020 2021\n\nWhile in the past attackers were content with encrypting a victim organization’s files, now most of the leading\nransomware operators are stealing data prior to encryption and using it to increase the pressure on victims to pay\nup. The threat actors threaten to release the stolen data or sell it to the highest bidder if the victim doesn’t pay a\nransom.\n\nSome ransomware gangs that have carried out ransomware attacks employing these tactics include the following:\n\nMaze\n\nThe now-defunct Maze ransomware gang was the first ransomware gang to adopt the tactic of exfiltrating data\nfrom victim organizations prior to encryption and threatening to release this data unless the ransom is paid. Maze\nalso operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), providing the malware to affiliates and sharing a portion of\nprofits made from successful attacks.\n\n[In September 2020, Maze targeted Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). The school was just one of the U.S. public](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fairfax-county-schools-hit-by-maze-ransomware-student-data-leaked/)\nsector organizations hit by Maze since it first appeared in May 2019. Maze published 100 MB of data in an effort\nto pressure FCPS into paying a ransom. The ransomware gang said that the data represented just 2% of the total\namount stolen during the attack.\n\nMaze shut down operation shortly after the FCPS attack, with many of its affiliates at the time moving to the newly\nemerging Egregor RaaS.\n\nBabuk\n\n[In April 2021, the Babuk ransomware gang targeted Washington DC’s Police Department and posted screenshots](https://www.databreachtoday.com/dc-metropolitan-police-hit-cyberattack-a-16474)\nof some of the 250 GB of data it allegedly stole. The screenshots published by Babuk appeared to contain folders\nrelating to police operations, DC gangs, and police disciplinary records. Babuk even claimed to have files relating to\narrests following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building on January 6.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Just two weeks later, Babuk released what it claimed was another 22 GB of data belonging to the police](https://www.databreachtoday.com/babuk-ransomware-gang-posts-more-dc-metro-police-data-a-16575)\ndepartment following the breakdown of ransom negotiations. The gang published the data on its dedicated data\nleak website. According to reports, the Babuk operators were initially seeking a $4 million ransom. According\nto the screenshots posted by Babuk, the police department offered $100,000, but this wasn’t acceptable to the\nransomware gang. The additional leaked data allegedly included arrest files, financial files, case files, disciplinary\nfiles, and more.\n\nA relatively new arrival to the ransomware scene, Babuk first appeared in January 2021. The ransomware gang\ntargets victims in human-operated attacks. While Babuk initially used the strong Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman\nalgorithm to encrypt files, the ransomware gang has since claimed that it will no longer be encrypting victims’ data\n[and will instead solely focus on data theft and extortion.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/)\n\nRyuk and Conti\n\n[In October 2020, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning about an](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-emotet-increasing-attacks-on-us-state-local-governments/)\nincrease in Emotet attacks against state and local government organizations. The Emotet Trojan was originally\ndesigned to steal banking credentials from an infected computer and also add it to a botnet. However, Emotet\ndeveloped into a major distribution channel for other malware families, including targeted ransomware threats such\nas Ryuk and Conti.\n\nRyuk and Conti, along with the GoGalocker and MegaCortex ransomware families, are controlled by a single\nadversary that Symantec calls Miner. The ransomware threats operate on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nbusiness model, with the creators sharing the ransomware with affiliated attackers in exchange for a cut of the\nransom.\n\nIn all of Miner’s ransomware operations, the threat actors use Cobalt Strike, which runs in the memory of infected\ncomputers, making detection difficult. Cobalt Strike is used by Miner to download additional tools and to create a\nreverse shell providing the attackers with additional access.\n\nMiner was likely leasing access to Emotet from the botnet’s operators and using that access to target its victims\nwith Ryuk. Ryuk was previously distributed by the Trickbot botnet.\n\n[However, in early 2021, law enforcement agencies announced they had taken control of the Emotet botnet’s](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-disrupted-after-global-takedown-operation/)\n[infrastructure, which they used to deliver an update that removed the malware from infected computers.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-disrupted-after-global-takedown-operation/)\n\n[This did not spell the end for Miner, though, which also relies on malicious spam campaigns, and compromising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-operation-updates-hacking-techniques/)\n[exposed RDP connections to gain access to victim networks, mounting brute force and password spraying attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-operation-updates-hacking-techniques/)\nagainst RDP.\n\nIn August 2020, Conti joined the list of targeted ransomware families to create a public data leak website in order\nto increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom. Conti is believed to have strong links to Ryuk. While Ryuk was\nbeing distributed via the Trickbot botnet, in July 2020, the botnet stopped delivering Ryuk and begun delivering\nConti instead.\n\n[The Conti ransomware recently made headlines when it infected Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE), the](https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2021/0516/1221933-dept-of-health/)\ncountry’s national health service, demanding a $20 million ransom for the return of stolen data.\n\n##### Network-Based Activity\n\nMalware detections form only one part of the picture, and more information can be gleaned from attacks blocked\non the network by our Intrusion Prevention (IPS) technologies. Malicious network-based activity reveals more\ninformation about the extent of malicious activity on organizations’ networks by blocking activity at the application\nlayer. If a machine on a network becomes infected, the malware is likely to attempt to contact a command and\ncontrol (C&C) server, which can also trigger these detections. Looking at the number of network detections\nattempting to contact a C&C server can give us a more realistic idea about how many infected machines are on a\nnetwork and a truer picture of the extent of malicious activity in a sector.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: IPS Detections, January 2020 to March 2021\n\n500,000\n\n400,000\n\n300,000\n\n200,000\n\n100,000\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar\n2020 2021\n\nIPS detections have trended upwards in the same time period, suggesting that while the number of confirmed\nmalware infections fell slightly, the number of infection attempts has risen.\n\nFigure 4: Top 10 Regions with a Government Sector Targeted by Malware in 2020\n\n**Spain 3%**\n\n**Thailand 4%**\n\n**South Africa 4%**\n\n**Australia 4%**\n\n**Qatar 6%**\n\n**U.S.**\n\n**New Zealand 6%** 25%\n\n**Italy**\n7%\n**Brazil**\n24%\n\n**Mexico**\n17%\n\nWhen looking at the countries where the government sector is most frequently targeted by malware, the U.S. is the\nmost represented, accounting for nearly a quarter of all malware detections. This is unsurprising, since the U.S. is a\npopulous country, with multiple layers of government at both federal and state level.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen it comes to countries targeted by malware the most, in addition to the U.S. we often see China, the UK, and\nFrance in the top 10, countries that didn’t make the list here. The fact that Brazil and Mexico take second and third\nplace here indicates that the government sector in these countries is of significant interest to attackers.\n\nWith regard to the other countries in the top 10, there are few surprises, many being large states with federal\ngovernment structures.\n\n##### Attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\n[The MITRE ATT&CK® matrix classifies attack techniques and tactics. It divides attack tactics into the following 12](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)\nmain categories, which map to the typical attack chain between vector and payload execution:\n\n   - Initial Access\n\n   - Execution\n\n   - Persistence\n\n   - Privilege Escalation\n\n   - Defense Evasion\n\n   - Credential Access\n\n   - Discovery\n\n   - Lateral Movement\n\n   - Collection\n\n   - Command and Control\n\n   - Exfiltration\n\n   - Impact\n\nWithin these categories, there are 245 distinct attack techniques. Some may be employed at multiple stages of\nan attack chain, meaning they can apply to more than one of the above 12 categories. Symantec Cloud Analytics\nclassifies all incidents with a MITRE technique name. With millions of incidents logged each year, it is possible to\nform a picture of the most frequently used techniques. Cloud Analytics draws on intelligence gathered from analyst\ninvestigations and leverages advanced machine learning to identify and block patterns of suspicious activity.\nBecause it is designed to identify malicious activity, more so than malicious tools, the vast majority of incidents\ncreated relate to living-off-the-land tactics.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Top MITRE Techniques Used in Attacks Against the Government Sector in 2020\n\n**Masquerading 2%**\n\n**Mshta 2%**\n\n**Service Execution 2%**\n\n**Windows Management Instrumentation 4%**\n\n**Modify Registry 5%**\n\n**Credential Dumping 6%**\n\n**Powershell**\n37%\n\n**Regsvr32**\n10%\n\n**Remote**\n**File Copy** **Obfuscated**\n\n**Files**\n\n11%\n\n**or Information**\n\n21%\n\nThe following are some of the most common Mitre ATT&CK techniques used by threat actors targeting the\ngovernment sector in 2020:\n\n   - PowerShell: PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included\nin the Windows operating system. It can be abused to perform a number of actions, including discovery of\ninformation and execution of code.\n\n   - Obfuscated Files or Information: Attempting to make a malicious file difficult to discover by encoding it or\notherwise obfuscating its contents.\n\n   - Remote File Copy: Transferring tools or files from external sources onto a compromised network, either via\ndownload from a command and control (C&C) server or through other methods such as FTP.\n\n   - Regsvr32: Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and\nembedding controls. Attackers may abuse Regsvr32.exe for proxy execution of malicious code.\n\n   - Credential Dumping: Obtaining credentials, either hashed or in clear text, usually through a dump of the\ncomputer’s memory. A range of freely available tools such as Mimikatz or LaZagne can be used to perform\nthis task.\n\n   - Modify Registry: Modifying the registry to hide configuration information within registry keys, or deleting\ninformation in order to remove evidence of intrusions.\n\n   - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): Microsoft command-line tool, which can be used to execute\ncommands on remote computers.\n\n   - Service Execution: The Windows service control manager (services.exe) is an interface to manage and\nmanipulate services. It can be used to execute malicious commands or payloads.\n\n   - Mshta: Mshta.exe is a Microsoft utility that executes HTML Application (HTA) files. Attackers may abuse\nmshta.exe for proxy execution of malicious .hta files and JavaScript or VBScript through a trusted Windows\nutility.\n\n   - Masquerading: Manipulating files and tools in order to make them appear to be legitimate or benign in order\nto evade detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Case Studies\n\nThe following two case studies are examples of some of the more recent investigations carried out by the\nSymantec Threat Hunter Team. The incidents, which both impacted organizations in the government sector, offer a\nsnapshot into what these organizations are targeted by and highlight a small selection of the methods used by the\nattackers.\n\n##### Case Study 1 - Legitimate Executables Abused to Side-load Malicious DLLs\n\n\n## Case Study 1 - Legitimate Executables Abused to Side-load Malicious DLLs\n\nIn April 2021, Symantec technology identified a number of suspicious files on multiple computers on the\nnetworks of two government agencies, one in a Southeast Asian country and another in a country in South\nAsia. The investigation found that the attackers were abusing legitimate executables for side-loading\nmalicious DLLs in order to execute a backdoor threat (RDoorBackdoor) on victim computers.\n\nThe motive for the attacks appears to have been information gathering. In one case, the attackers appeared\nto be targeting information related to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nRDoorBackdoor has been in use since at least 2018. It appears to be used in targeted attacks only but it is\nunclear if the backdoor is a shared tool or exclusive to one attack group. The attack activity discussed in this\ncase occurred between June 2020 and April 2021.\n\nWhile the initial infection vector is unknown, the lead up to the final payload begins with RDoorDropper, a\nself-extracting (SFX) RAR file. RDoorDropper contains three files:\n\n  - A legitimate and signed PE vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking\n\n  - A malicious loader (RDoorLoader)\n\n  - An encrypted .pak file containing the final payload (RDoorBackdoor)\n\nWe observed RDoorDropper variants abusing PEs for four different legitimate applications and a\n[discontinued plug-in for Internet Explorer:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_Frame)\n\nTable 1: Legitimate PEs Abused by the Attackers\n\nEncrypted payload\nLegitimate binary Loader (RDoorLoader)\n(RDoorBackdoor)\n\nSiteAdv.exe (McAfee SiteAdvisor) SiteAdv.dll SiteAdv.pak\n\nssr32.exe (Sophos SafeStore Restore) safestore32.dll safestore.pak\n\nwsc_proxy.exe (Avast wsc_proxy) wsc.dll proxycfg.pak\n\ncoInst.exe (Norton Identity Safe) msvcr100.dll coinstcfg.dat\n\nchrome_frame_helper.exe\nchrome_frame_helper.dll chrome_frame_helper.pak\n(Google Chrome Frame)\n\nWhen opened, RDoorDropper extracts the embedded files and executes the legitimate PE in order to load\nRDoorLoader, which is side-loaded via search order hijacking by the legitimate PE.\n\n|Legitimate binary|Loader (RDoorLoader)|Encrypted payload (RDoorBackdoor)|\n|---|---|---|\n|SiteAdv.exe (McAfee SiteAdvisor)|SiteAdv.dll|SiteAdv.pak|\n|ssr32.exe (Sophos SafeStore Restore)|safestore32.dll|safestore.pak|\n|wsc_proxy.exe (Avast wsc_proxy)|wsc.dll|proxycfg.pak|\n|coInst.exe (Norton Identity Safe)|msvcr100.dll|coinstcfg.dat|\n|chrome_frame_helper.exe (Google Chrome Frame)|chrome_frame_helper.dll|chrome_frame_helper.pak|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is DLL search order hijacking?\n\nDynamic link library (DLL) side-loading via search order hijacking is a cyber attack method that takes\nadvantage of how Microsoft Windows programs handle DLL files. In DLL search order hijacking attacks,\nmalware places a spoofed malicious DLL file in a specific Windows directory so that the operating system\nloads it instead of the legitimate file.\n\nWindows allows programs to load DLLs at runtime and programs can specify the location of DLLs to load\nby specifying a full path, using DLL redirection, or by using a manifest. If none of these methods are used,\nWindows tries to locate the DLL by searching a list of directories in a set order.\n\nAttackers abuse this search feature by placing a malicious DLL in one of those directories. Often this is the\ncurrent working directory of the program. Then Windows finds and loads the malicious DLL before the\nlegitimate version.\n\nIt is also possible to execute code within the context of a legitimate portable executable (PE) by abusing\ninsecure library references. If a developer allows LoadLibrary to resolve the path of a library dynamically\nthen that PE will also look in the current directory for the library DLL.\n\nA threat actor can copy a legitimate PE to a directory where the attacker has write access. If the attacker\ncreates a custom payload DLL, the program will load that DLL and execute the malicious code. This can be\nbeneficial for the attacker as the PE may be signed and appear trustworthy to some security solutions, and\nit may also bypass application white listing (AWL).\n\n##### Post compromise\n\nRDoorBackdoor\n\nRDoorBackdoor is a fully featured backdoor with the ability to install itself as a service, log keystrokes,\ncommunicate with its command and control server (C&C) using HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, UDP, or TCP, and listen\non a local port for commands.\n\nInstances of RDoorBackdoor are usually identical with the exception of embedded and encrypted\nconfiguration which determines:\n\n  - C&C communication method\n\n  - Service details\n\n  - Installation directory\n\nThe attackers using RDoorBackdoor used a number of non-malware techniques for credential theft:\n\n  - PowerShell was used to launch rundll32.exe in order to dump the memory of a process using the\nMiniDump function of comsvcs.dll (this is a technique used often to dump LSASS memory)\n\n  - Reg.exe was used to dump the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives\n\n  - A legitimate Avast tool was used by the attackers to dump LSASS memory\n\nOther post-compromise tools used by the attackers included:\n\nLSASS dumping tool\n\n  - The only credential theft tool found to be uses by the attackers\n\n  - Similar to how PowerShell is used, this tool can dump LSASS process memory using the legitimate\ncomsvcs.dll file\n\nBrowsingHistoryView\n\n  - A utility that reads the history data of different web browsers\n\n\n-----\n\nChrome secrets stealer\n\n  - A Chrome secrets and history stealer based on https://github.com/LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief/tree/\nmaster/Stealer/Stealer\n\nNirCmd\n\n  - Small command-line utility for carrying out various tasks without a user interface\n\nSuspected NirCMD\n\n  - Found disguised with a similar name to other suspicious files\n\nCommand-line downloader\n\n  - This downloader can be passed proxy information and a remote host and will attempt to download\nand execute a DLL file\n\nForfiles\n\n  - Dual-use tool that searches files according to the specified search mask and runs a specified\ncommand on each item found\n\n  - Used by the attackers to search for a specific file name\n\nMultiple machines where RDoorBackdoor was observed also had additional malware and tools present,\nincluding the following:\n\n   - GupdataLoader: A simple loader that reads and executes shellcode from a separate file named favico.\nico.\n\n   - [ChromeDecryptor: Chrome secrets and history stealer based on the LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief](https://github.com/LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief/tree/master/Stealer/Stealer)\nstealer.\n\n   - [NightScoutBackdoor and NightScoutDropper: Malware previously described by ESET (Malicious](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)\nUpdate variant 1).\n\n   - PrcLoader: A loader for the aPLib compressed executable stored in the Windows Registry (HKEY_\nCLASSES_ROOT\\.prc\\Shell).\n\n   - GrouperLoader: A service-based loader for shellcode stored in the Windows Registry. Shellcode is\nencrypted using the computer name as a key.\n\n   - UpdateRootkitDropper: A dropper for embedded rootkit drivers (32-bit & 64-bit) and backdoor\npayloads stored in a separate file (res.dat). The dropper contains code consistent with previously\nseen instances of ZXShell that also included rootkit capabilities. Extracted rootkit drivers are tagged\nas UpdateRootkit. Several instances of droppers for UpdateRootkitDropper were also observed\n(UpdateRootkitDropperDropper). Final payloads stored in a separate file (res.dat) are likely instances\nof ZXShell.\n\n   - [DosEmulator and FastProxy: Tools previously described by Trend Micro that are part of the Korplug/](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2015/2015.09.17.Operation_Iron_Tiger/wp-operation-iron-tiger.pdf)\nPlugX build and control toolset.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Case Study 2 Early Access to Unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile cyber security is a challenge for every sector, those in the government sector are being targeted by a range\nof threat actors whose capabilities and persistence continue to grow. The government sector forms the backbone\nof civil service and, as such, a cyber attack against it can have dire consequences. This threat should not be\noverlooked and organizations must take the necessary steps and precautions to bolster their defensive capabilities\nto prevent them from falling prey to a cyber attack or data breach, and the people they serve from losing out on\nkey services.\n\n### Protection: How Symantec Solutions Can Help\n\nThe Symantec Enterprise Business provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to address today’s\nsecurity challenges and protect data and digital infrastructure from multifaceted threats.

Only allow RDP from specific known IP addresses and ensure you are using\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n  - Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time\ncredentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.\n\n  - Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally\nundetected through a network.\n\n  - Use application allow lists where applicable.\n\n  - Locking down PowerShell can increase security, for example with the constrained language mode.\n\n  - Make credential dumping more difficult, for example by enabling credential guard in Windows 10 or disabling\nSeDebugPrivilege.\n\n  - MFA can help limit the usefulness of compromised credentials.\n\nEmail:\n\n  - Enable MFA to prevent the compromise of credentials during phishing attacks.\n\n  - Harden security architecture around email systems to minimize the amount of spam that reaches end-user\ninboxes and ensure you are following best practices for your email system, including the use of SPF and other\ndefensive measures against phishing attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nCase Study 1 -

Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore\nsystems for DLL hijacking weaknesses.\n\nUse the program sxstrace.exe that is included with Windows along with manual inspection to check manifest files\nfor side-by-side problems in software.\n\n[M1038 Execution Prevention](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038)\n\nAdversaries may use new DLLs to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software\nexecuted through search order hijacking by using application control solutions capable of blocking DLLs loaded by\nlegitimate software.\n\n[M1044 Restrict Library Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1044)\n\nDisallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is available by patch for\nXP+ and Server 2003+.\n\nEnable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions (e.g.\n%SYSTEMROOT%)to be used before local directory DLLs (e.g. a user’s home directory).\n\nThe Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration > [Policies] >\nAdministrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode. The\nassociated Windows Registry key for this is located at HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session\nManager\\SafeDLLSearchMode\n\n##### Detection\n\nMonitor file systems for moving, renaming, replacing, or modifying DLLs. Changes in the set of DLLs that are\nloaded by a process (compared with past behavior) that do not correlate with known software, patches, etc., are\nsuspicious. Monitor DLLs loaded into a process and detect DLLs that have the same file name but abnormal paths.\nModifications to or creation of .manifest and .local redirection files that do not correlate with software updates are\nsuspicious.\n\n**[For product information and a complete list of distributors, visit our website at: broadcom.com](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security)**\n\nCopyright © 2021 Broadcom.
