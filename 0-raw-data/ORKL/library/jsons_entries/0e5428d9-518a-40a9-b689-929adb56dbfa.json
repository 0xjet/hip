Malicious cyber actors are actively\nscanning networks to potentially exploit Log4Shell, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021-45105 in\nvulnerable systems. According to public reporting, Log4Shell and CVE-2021-45046 are being actively\nexploited.\nCISA, in collaboration with industry members of CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC),\npreviously published guidance on Log4Shell for vendors and affected organizations in which CISA\nrecommended that affected organizations immediately apply appropriate patches (or apply\nworkarounds if unable to upgrade), conduct a security review, and report compromises to CISA or the\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact\nthe FBI via their victim referral page for Log4j, fbi.gov/log4j.

CISA also issued an Emergency Directive directing U.S. federal civilian executive branch (FCEB)\nagencies to immediately mitigate Log4j vulnerabilities in solution stacks that accept data from the\ninternet. This joint CSA expands on the previously published guidance by detailing steps that vendors\nand organizations with IT and/or cloud assets should take reduce the risk posed by these\nvulnerabilities.\nThese steps include:\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying assets affected by Log4Shell and other Log4j-related vulnerabilities,\nUpgrading Log4j assets and affected products to the latest version as soon as patches are\navailable and remaining alert to vendor software updates, and\nInitiating hunt and incident response procedures to detect possible Log4Shell exploitation.\n\nThis CSA also provides guidance for affected organizations with operational technology\n(OT)/industrial control systems (ICS) assets.\nLog4j is a Java-based logging library used in a variety of consumer and enterprise services, websites,\napplications, and OT products. These vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, are severe—Apache has\nrated Log4Shell and CVE-2021-45046 as critical and CVE-2021-45105 as high on the Common\nVulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). These vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited over an\nextended period. CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK strongly\nurge all organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations section.\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK encourage leaders of\norganizations to review NCSC-UK’s blog post, Log4j vulnerability: what should boards be asking?, for\ninformation on Log4Shell’s possible impact on their organization as well as response\nrecommendations.\nNote: this is an evolving situation, and new vulnerabilities are being discovered. CISA, the FBI, NSA,\nACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK will update this CSA as we learn more about this\nexploitation and have further guidance to impart.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only. CISA, the FBI,\nNSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK do not endorse any commercial product or\nservice, including any subjects of analysis.

The vulnerability exists in the action the Java\n\nPage 2 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\nNaming and Directory Interface (JNDI) takes to resolve variables. Affected versions of Log4j contain\nJNDI features—such as message lookup substitution—that do not protect against adversarycontrolled Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Domain Name System (DNS), and other\nJNDI related endpoints.\nAn adversary can exploit Log4Shell by submitting a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system\nthat causes that system to execute arbitrary code. The request allows the adversary to take full\ncontrol over the system. The adversary can then steal information, launch ransomware, or conduct\nother malicious activity.\n\nCVE-2021-45046\nCVE-2021-45046, disclosed on December 13, 2021, enables a remote attacker to cause RCE, a\ndenial-of-service (DoS) condition, or other effects in certain non-default configurations. This\nvulnerability affects all versions of Log4j from 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0. In\nresponse, Apache released Log4j version 2.16.0 (Java 8).\n\nCVE-2021- 45105\nCVE-2021-45105, disclosed on December 16, 2021, enables a remote attacker to cause a DoS\ncondition or other effects in certain non-default configurations. According to Apache, when the logging\nconfiguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,\n$${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft\nmalicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will\nterminate the process. In response, Apache released Log4j version 2.17.0 (Java 8).\n\nImpact\nLog4Shell and CVE-2021-45046—rated as critical vulnerabilities by Apache—are severe because\nJava is used extensively across IT and OT platforms, they are easy to exploit, and applying\nmitigations is resource intensive. Log4Shell is especially critical because it allows malicious actors to\nremotely run code on vulnerable networks and take full control of systems.\nAccording to public reporting, exploitation of Log4Shell began on or around December 1, 2021, and a\nproof-of-concept exploit is publicly available for this vulnerability. The FBI has observed attempted\nexploitation and widespread scanning of the Log4j vulnerability to gain access to networks to deploy\ncryptomining and botnet malware. The FBI assesses this vulnerability may be exploited by\nsophisticated cyber threat actors and incorporated into existing cyber criminal schemes that are\nlooking to adopt increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques. According to public reporting,\nCVE-2021-45046 is being actively exploited as well.\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK assess that exploitation of\nthese vulnerabilities, especially Log4Shell, is likely to increase and continue over an extended period.\nGiven the severity of the vulnerabilities and likely increased exploitation, CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC,\nCCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK strongly urge all organizations to apply the\nrecommendations in the Mitigations section to identify, mitigate, and update affected assets.\nFor more information on these vulnerabilities, see the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities webpage.\n\nPage 3 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nMITIGATIONS\nVendors\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK encourage vendors to:\n1. Immediately identify, mitigate, and update affected products that use Log4j to the latest\npatched version.\na. For environments using Java 8 or later, upgrade to Log4j version 2.17.0 (released\nDecember 17, 2021) or newer.\nb. For environments using Java 7, upgrade to Log4j version 2.12.3 (released December\n21, 2021). Note: Java 7 is currently end of life and organizations should upgrade to\nJava 8.\n2. Inform your end users of products that contain these vulnerabilities and strongly urge\nthem to prioritize software updates. CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC,\nand NCSC-UK strongly recommend vendors take steps to ensure messaging on software\nupdates reaches the widest possible audience (for example, avoid placing relevant information\nbehind paywalls). Note: CISA is actively maintaining a GitHub page and repository with patch\ninformation for products known to be affected by Log4Shell. CISA has also notified ICS\nvendors that may be affected and has asked them to confirm any assets affected by\nLog4Shell and to apply available mitigations.\n\nAffected Organizations with IT and Cloud Assets\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK recommend that affected\norganizations take the following steps to patch these vulnerabilities in their IT and cloud assets and\ninitiate threat hunting to detect possible compromise. Organizations with OT/ICS environments should\nreview the Organizations with OT/ICS Assets section for additional guidance. Note: this guidance\nincludes resources that may or may not be possible for all organizations. CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC,\nCCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK recommend that organizations apply the mitigations\nlisted in this advisory to the extent allowed by their environments.\n1. Identify vulnerable assets in your environment.\nKnowing where Log4j and other affected products exist in your environment is key for protecting your\nnetworks.\nA. Inventory all assets that make use of the Log4j Java library. According to public reporting,\nadversaries are patching and mitigating assets they compromise to retain control of assets. To\navoid missing such defense evasion, organizations should carefully track assets under\ninvestigation.\n(1) Assume all versions of Java and Log4j are vulnerable and include them in the\ninventory.\n(2) Ensure the inventory includes all assets, including cloud assets, regardless of function,\noperating system, or make. Ensure the inventory includes the following information\nabout each asset:\n(a)\nSoftware versions\n\nPage 4 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n(b)\nTimestamps of when last updated and by whom\n(c)\nUser accounts on the asset with their privilege level\n(d)\nLocation of asset in your enterprise topology\nB. Identify the inventoried assets that are likely vulnerable.\n(1) Use CISA's GitHub repository and CERT/CC's CVE-2021-44228_scanner to identify\nassets vulnerable to Log4Shell.\nAdditional resources for detecting vulnerable instances of Log4j are identified below.\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK will update\nthe sources for detection rules as we obtain them. Note: due to the urgency to share\nthis information, CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSCUK have not yet validated this content.\n\n\n\nTo identify server applications that may be affected by Log4Shell and CVE2021-45046, see TrendMicro: Log4J Vulnerability Tester.\nFor a list of hashes to help determine if a Java application is running a\nvulnerable version of Log4j, see:\no Rob Fuller's GitHub page: CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes, and\no The NCC Group’s GitHub page: Cyber-Defence/Intelligence/CVE-202144228/.\n\n\n\nFor PowerShell to detect vulnerable instances, see:\no Nathan Kula’s GitHub page: PowerShellSnippets/InvokeLog4ShellScan.ps1, and\no Will Dormann’s GitHub page: checkjndi.ps1.\n\n\n\n\nFor guidance on using Canary Token to test for callback, see Thinkst Canary’s\nTwitter thread on using Canary Tokens.\nFor guidance on using Burpsuite Pro to scan, see:\no\no\n\n\n\n\nSilent Signal’s GitHub page: burp-log4shell, and\nPortSwigger’s GitHub page: active-scan-plus-plus.\n\nFor guidance on using NetMap’s Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), see Divertor’s\nGitHub page: nse-log4shell.\nSee Florian Roth's GitHub page, Fenrir 0.9.0 - Log4Shell Release, for guidance\non using Roth’s Fenrir tool to detect vulnerable instances.\n\n2. Mitigate known and suspected vulnerable assets in your environment.\nA. Treat known and suspected vulnerable assets as compromised. These assets should be\nisolated until they are mitigated and verified (step 2.D). The method of isolation that you\nshould use depends on the criticality of the asset. Possible isolation methods include:\n Physically removing the asset from the network (e.g., unplug the network cable);\n Moving the asset to a “jail VLAN” with heightened monitoring and security;\n\nPage 5 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\n\nBlocking at the network layer (a switch or some other device);\nImplementing a firewall (including web application firewall) with strict port control and\nlogging; or\nRestricting the asset’s communication, especially to the internet and the rest of the\nenterprise network.\n\nB. Patch Log4j and other affected products to the latest version.\n See the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities webpage (as of December 22, 2021, the\nlatest Log4j version is 2.17.0 for Java 8 and 2.12.3 for Java 7). Note: patching or\nupdating Java is not enough, you must upgrade the Log4j library itself.\n For other affected products, see CISA’s GitHub page.\nNote: if your organization is unable to immediately identify and patch vulnerable instances of\nLog4j, apply appropriate workarounds. CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ\nNCSC, and NCSC-UK recommend using vendor-provided mitigations when available. Due to\nthe rapidly evolving situation, these workarounds should not be considered permanent fixes,\nand organizations should apply the appropriate patch as soon as it is made available.\nAdditional mitigations are identified below; however, organizations should use these\nmitigations at their own risk as they may be incomplete, temporary, or cause harmful effects,\nsuch as application instability, a DoS condition, or log evasion.\n Remove the Jndilookup.class from the class path.[1]\n Delete or rename Jndilookup.class. Note: removal of the JndiManager will cause\nthe JndiContextSelector and JMSAppender to no longer function.[2]\n Apply a hot patch.\no\no\n\nNCC Group: log4j-jndi-be-gone: A simple mitigation for CVE-2021-44228\nAmazon AWS:\n GitHub page: hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2\n Blog: Hotpatch for Apache Log4j\n\nC. Keep an inventory of known and suspected vulnerable assets and what is done with\nthem throughout this process. It is important to track patching because malicious cyber\nactors may compromise an asset and then patch it to protect their operations. Organizations\nshould keep a meticulous record of vulnerable assets they have patched to identify whether a\nthreat actor may have patched an asset.\nD. Verify the mitigation has worked, if possible.\n(1) Scan the patched/mitigated asset with the tools and methods listed in step 1.B. Use\nmore than one method to verify the mitigation was successfully applied.\n(2) Monitor the asset closely.\n(3) Remain alert to changes from vendors for the software on the asset. Additionally, see\nCISA's GitHub page for known affected products and patch information. CISA will\ncontinually update the repository as vendors release patches.\n3. Initiate hunt and incident response procedures. Given the widespread exploitation of this\nvulnerability, CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK encourage all\n\nPage 6 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\norganizations to assume their assets that use Log4j may have been compromised and initiate hunt\nprocedures.\nA. Hunt for signs of exploitation and compromise.\n(1) Treat assets that use Log4j as suspect and conduct vigorous forensic investigation of\nthose assets.\n(2) Inspect and monitor accounts across your enterprise that exist on or connect to assets\nthat use Log4j.\n(3) Inspect changes to configurations made since December 1, 2021, and verify they were\nintended, especially on assets that use Log4j.\n(4) Use CISA’s GitHub page to detect possible exploitation or compromise.\nAdditional resources to detect possible exploitation or compromise are identified\nbelow. Note: due to the urgency to share this information, CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC,\nCCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK have not yet validated this content.\n Cisco Talos blog: Threat Advisory: Critical Apache Log4j vulnerability being\nexploited in the wild\n Curated Intelligence GitHub page: Log4Shell-IOCs (Note: Curated Intelligence\nnotes that the “IOCs shared by these feeds are low-to-medium confidence we\n[Curated Intelligence] strongly recommend not adding them to a blocklist.”)\n EmergingThreat.net: signatures to assist with detection of CVE-2021-44228\nactivity\n Florian Roth’s GitHub pages:\no\no\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog4j RCE Exploitation Detection\nsignature-base/yara/expl_log4j_cve_2021_44228.yar\nlog4shell-detector\n\nHuntress blog: Critical RCE Vulnerability: log4j - CVE-2021-44228\nMandiant blog: Now You Serial, Now You Don’t – Systematically Hunting for\nDeserialization Exploits\nMicrosoft Azure GitHub page: AzureSentinel/Detections/MultipleDataSources/Log4J_IPIOC_Dec112021.yaml\nNCC Group: Log4Shell: Reconnaissance and post exploitation network\ndetection\nSigma GitHub pages:\no\no\n\nsigma/rules/web/web_cve_2021_44228_log4j.yml\nsigma/rules/web/web_cve_2021_44228_log4j_fields.yml\n\nB. If compromise is detected, organizations should:\n(1) Initiate incident response procedures. See the joint advisory from ACSC, CCCS, NZ\nNCSC, CERT NZ, NCSC-UK, and CISA on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and\nRemediating Malicious Activity for guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and\nfor common mistakes in incident handling. CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT\nNZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK encourage organizations to see CISA’s Federal\n\nPage 7 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\nGovernment Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although\ntailored to U.S. FCEB agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for\nplanning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities\nand detail each step for both incident and vulnerability response.\n(2) Consider reporting compromises immediately to applicable cybersecurity authorities.\nOrganizations are encouraged to be as thorough as possible by including information\nsuch as IP addresses/domains used to exploit your infrastructure, exploited\napplications/servers, administrators contact information, and the start and end dates of\nthe attack.\n U.S. organizations should report compromises to CISA and the FBI.\n Australian organizations can visit cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300\nCYBER 1) to report cybersecurity incidents.\n Canadian organizations can report incidents by emailing CCCS at\ncontact@cyber.gc.ca.\n New Zealand organizations can visit NCSC.govt.nz to report incidents.\n UK organizations can report a significant cyber security incident at\nncsc.gov.uk/report-an-incident (monitored 24 hrs) or, for urgent assistance, call\n03000 200 973.\n4. Evaluate and apply other mitigations.\nA. Remain alert to changes from vendors for the software on the asset, and immediately\napply updates to assets when notified by a vendor that their product has a patch for this\nvulnerability. Additionally, see CISA's GitHub repository for known affected products and patch\ninformation. CISA will continually update the repository as vendors release patches.\nB. Continue to monitor Log4J assets closely. Continually use signatures and indicators of\ncompromise that may indicate exploitation.\n(1) See the exploitation and detection resources listed in step 3.A.(4).\n(2) Be aware that there are many ways to obfuscate the exploit string. Do not depend on\none detection method to work all the time.\nC. Continue to monitor the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities webpage for new\nupdates. Note: as this is an evolving situation and new vulnerabilities in Log4J are being\ndiscovered, organizations should ensure their Apache Log4j is up to date. Identify the software\nyour enterprise uses and stay on top of updates as these may be superseded by other\nupdates and fixes.\nD. Block specific outbound Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) network traffic.\n(1) Outbound LDAP: for most networks, LDAP is used internally, but it is rare for LDAP\nrequests to be routed outside a network. Organizations should block outbound LDAP\nor use an allowlist for outbound LDAP to known good destinations. Note: this may be\ndifficult to detect on certain ports without a firewall that does application layer filtering.\n\nPage 8 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\n(2) Remote Method Invocation (RMI): for most networks, RMI is either unused or used\nfor internal sources. Organizations should block outbound RMI or use an allowlist for\noutbound RMI to known good destinations\n(3) Outbound DNS: organizations using enterprise DNS resolution can block outbound\nDNS from sources other than identified DNS resolvers. At a minimum, blocking direct\noutbound DNS from web application servers configured to use enterprise DNS\nresolution will mitigate the risks to those systems.\nNote: blocking attacker internet IP addresses during this event is difficult due to the high volume of\nscanning from non-malicious researchers and vendors. The false positives on IP addresses are high.\nOrganizations should focus on looking for signs of successful exploitation and not scans.\n\nAffected Organizations with OT/ICS Assets\nDue to the pervasiveness of the Apache Log4j software library—and the integration of the library in\noperational products—CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK\nstrongly recommend that OT asset owners and operators review their operational architecture and\nenumerate the vulnerability status against current product alerts and advisories. If a product does not\nhave a security advisory specifically addressing the status of the vulnerability, treat it with additional\nprotections. CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK urge patching\nor deployment of mitigations to reduce the risk of the threat of these vulnerabilities.\nNote: CISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK recommend\nprioritizing patching IT devices, especially those with internet connectivity. Affected internet-facing\ndevices as well as laptops, desktops, and tablets are especially susceptible to exploitation of these\nvulnerabilities. OT/ICS devices—if segmented appropriately from the IT environment—do not face the\ninternet and, as such, have a smaller attack surface to this vulnerability. Exploitation of IT devices\nmay affect OT/ICS devices if there is insufficient network segmentation that prevents lateral\nmovement.\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK recommend that OT/ICS\nasset owner/operators take the following guidance into consideration:\n1. Review operational architecture and enumerate the vulnerability against current product\nalerts and advisories. If products do not have a security advisory specifically addressing their\nstatus of the vulnerability, it is recommended to treat these devices with additional protections.\n2. Implement the steps listed in the previous section to identify and isolate vulnerable\nassets in the OT/ICS environment. Understand what type of products in the OT environment\nwould be affected. Many OT/ICS-specific products incorporate vulnerable versions of the Log4j\nlibrary.\n3. Use a risk-informed decision-making process to apply the latest version of hotfixes or\npatches to affected devices as soon as is operationally feasible. If patches cannot be applied,\nmitigations provided by the product’s manufacturer or reseller should be deployed. Note: CISA,\nthe FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK recommend, as quality\n\nPage 9 of 11 | Product ID: AA21-356A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | ACSC | CCCS | CERT NZ | NZ NCSC | NCSC-UK\n\nTLP:WHITE\nassurance, that users test the update in a test development environment that reflects their\nproduction environment prior to installation.\n4. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure\nthey are not accessible from the internet.\n5. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them\nfrom the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods such as virtual private networks (VPNs),\nrecognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version\navailable. Also recognize that a VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.\nCISA, the FBI, NSA, ACSC, CCCS, CERT NZ, NZ NCSC, and NCSC-UK also remind organizations\nto perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.\nCISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS\nwebpage on cisa.gov. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download,\nincluding Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\nAdditional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS\nwebpage on cisa.gov in the Technical Information Paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber\nIntrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.\nOrganizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal\nprocedures and consider reporting compromises immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. organizations should report compromises to CISA and the FBI.\nAustralian organizations can visit cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1) to report\ncybersecurity incidents.\nCanadian organizations can report incidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca.\nNew Zealand organizations can visit NCSC.govt.nz to report incidents.\nUK organizations can report a significant cyber security incident at ncsc.gov.uk/report-anincident (monitored 24 hrs) or, for urgent assistance, call 03000 200 973.\n\nRESOURCES\nFor more information, resources, and general guidance, including resources and mitigation guidance\nfrom industry members of JCDC, see CISA’s webpage Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance. Note:\ndue to the prominent and ever evolving nature of this vulnerability, there are multiple unverified\npublished guidance documents that are geared towards Log4j vulnerabilities.
