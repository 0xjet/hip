We had nothing to do with this horrible murder,” Shalev Hulio, the\nchief executive of the Israeli surveillance firm, told the US TV news programme 60 Minutes in\nMarch 2019. It was six months after Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was killed in\n[Turkey by assassins dispatched by Saudi Arabia, a client of NSO.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia)\n\nNow a joint investigation by the Guardian and other media, based on leaked data and\nforensic analysis of phones, has uncovered new evidence that the company’s spyware was\nused to try and monitor people close to Khashoggi both before and after his death.\n\nWhat is Pegasus spyware and how does it hack phones?\n\nRead more\n\nIn one case, a person in Khashoggi’s inner circle was hacked four days after his murder,\naccording to peer-reviewed forensic analysis of her device.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe investigation points to an apparent attempt by Saudi Arabia and its close ally the United\nArab Emirates to leverage NSO’s spy technology after Khashoggi’s death to monitor his\nassociates and the Turkish murder investigation, even going so far as to selectthe phone of\nIstanbul’s chief prosecutor for potentialsurveillance.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n**What is in the Pegasus project data?**\n\nShow\n**What is in the data leak?**\n\nThe data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to\nhave been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group,\nwhich sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers\nwere selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit\njournalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared\naccess with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have\nworked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security\nLab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses.\n\n**What does the leak indicate?**\n\nThe consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients\nidentified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the\npresence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the\nphone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether\nany attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and\nUS numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals\nsome targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with\nPegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers\non the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the\nstart of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds.\n\n**What did forensic analysis reveal?**\n\nAmnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were\nsuccessfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30,\nthe tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced.\nFifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful\ninfection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of\ninformation required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of\ntargeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmnesty shared backup copies of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the\nUniversity of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed\nsigns of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic\nmethods, and found them to be sound.\n\n**Which NSO clients were selecting numbers?**\n\nWhile the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say\nwhich NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its\ntools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the\npattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to\nidentify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan,\nBahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the\nUnited Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO.\n\n**What does NSO Group say?**\n\nYou can read NSO Group’s [full statement here. The company has always said it does not](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments)\nhave access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the\nconsortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s\ntechnology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list\nof numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to\nbelieve the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments\nusing Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been\nused by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that\nanyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the\nconsortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from\naccessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no\nbearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still\ndo not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group\ntechnologies”. Following publication, they explained that they considered a \"target\" to be a\nphone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus,\nand reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent \"targets\" of\nPegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative\nof whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus.\n\n**What is HLR lookup data?**\n\nThe term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating\nmobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and\ntheir general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in\nrouting calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be\nused in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to\nconnect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an\n\n\n-----\n\ninterface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether\nPegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use\nits software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to\nPegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.\n\n[Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/21/death-of-dissident-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman)\nWhile the investigation mostly points to Khashoggi’s close associates being targeted in the\nmonths after the murder, it also identified evidence suggesting that an NSO client targeted\nthe phone of his wife, Hanan Elatr, several months before his death, between November\n2017 and April 2018.\n\nThe client appears to have used NSO’s spyware, Pegasus, which can transform a phone into\na surveillance device, with microphones and cameras activated without a user knowing.\n\nPegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video\nA forensic examination of Elatr’s Android phone found that she was sent four text messages\nthat contained malicious links connected to Pegasus. The analysis indicated the targeting\ncame from the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally. However, the examination did not confirm\nwhether the device had been successfully infected.\n\n“Jamal warned me before that this might happen,” Elatr said. “It makes me believe they are\naware of everything that happened to Jamal through me.” She added that she was\nconcerned his conversations with fellow dissidents might have been monitored through her\nphone. “I kept my phone on the tea table [in their Virginia home] while Jamal was talking to a\nSaudi guy twice a week.”\n\nElatr’s number was also contained in a leak of numbers that were selected by clients of NSO\nas candidates for possible surveillance. Access to the leak was shared with the Guardian\nand other media by Forbidden Stories, a nonprofit organisation, as part of a collaborative\ninvestigation called the Pegasus project. Examination of phones was done by Amnesty\nInternational’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the Pegasus project.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have already concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed\nbin Salman, was responsible for ordering the murder of Khashoggi, a former Saudi\ngovernment insider whose criticism of the kingdom’s regime in the pages of the Washington\nPost was seen as a threat to the Saudi heir.\n\nA team of Saudi agents killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul during his\n[visit there to pick up documents he needed to get married to his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/khashoggi-fiancee-saudi-arabia-can-get-away-with-doing-whatever-it-wants)\nlater became an outspoken advocate for accountability over his murder.\n\n\n-----\n\nJamal Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\nForensic analysis revealed that Cengiz’s phone was first infected with Pegasus just four days\nafter his murder, on 6 October 2018. Her phone was also hacked on two other days in\nOctober 2018. Further attempts to hack her phone followed in June 2019, although they did\nnot appear to be successful.Data analysis suggested that Saudi Arabia was behind her\nhacking. Cengiz said she was not surprised she had been hacked: “I was thinking this after\nthe murder. But what can you do?”\n\nA close friend of Khashoggi, Wadah Khanfar, the former director general of the Al Jazeera\ntelevision network, was also hacked using Pegasus, with analysis showing that his phone\nwas infected as recently July 2021.\n\nThe phone analysis discoveries and leaked phone records suggest that Saudi Arabia and its\nallies used NSO’s spyware in the aftermath of the murder to monitor the campaign for justice\nled by friends and associates of Khashoggi, while also showing an intent to spy on the official\nTurkish inquiry into his murder.\n\nKhashoggi associates who were targeted for possible surveillance after his death, according\nto the leak, include Abdullah Khashoggi, the journalist’s son; Azzam Tamimi, a PalestinianBritish activist and friend, and Madawi Al-Rasheed, a London-based scholar who co-created\nan opposition party of expatriate Saudis in the wake of the murder.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who US intelligence agencies have\nconcluded was responsible for ordering the murder of Khashoggi. Photograph: Anadolu\nAgency/Getty Images\nAnalysis of Rasheed’s phone found evidence of an attempted hack in April 2019, but there\nwas no evidence the spyware was successfully installed.\n\nOther Khashoggi-connected names linked to in the data were Yahya Assiri, a UK-based\nSaudi activist who documents human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and was in close\ncontact with Khashoggi before his death, and Yasin Aktay, a friend of Khashoggi and a top\naide to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. No forensics were able to be carried\nout on their phones.\n\nQ&A\n\n**What is the Pegasus project?**\n\nShow\nThe Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its\nclients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship\nproduct is Pegasus, spying software – or spyware – that targets iPhones and Android\ndevices. Once a phone is infected, a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats, photos,\nemails and location data, or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing.\n\nForbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty\nInternational had access to a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected as targets\nby clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16\n\n\n-----\n\nother news organisations, including the Washington Post, Le Monde, Die Zeit and\nSüddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several\nmonths on the investigation, which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories.\n\nIn an interview, Aktay said he had already been alerted by Turkish intelligence officials that\nhis phone had been hacked after Khashoggi’s death because the Saudis were still trying to\ncreate a “map” of the journalist’s connections. “It was needless,” Aktay said of the\nsurveillance. “I was just a friend of his.”\n\n\n-----\n\nİrfan Fidan, the Turkish prosecutor who charged 20 Saudis over the Khashoggi killing.\nPhotograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\nThe phone number of İrfan Fidan, the Istanbul chief prosecutor who later formally charged 20\nSaudi nationals over the killing, also appeared in the list of numbers of possible candidates\nfor surveillance by NSO Group clients.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithout forensic examination of their phones, it is not possible to know whether these targets\nwere infiltrated or successfully hacked using Pegasus.\n\nIn a [statement, NSO said: “Our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments)\nmurder of Jamal Khashoggi. We can confirm that our technology was not used to listen,\nmonitor, track, or collect information regarding him or his family members mentioned in your\ninquiry.”\n\nAgnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, which is a partner in the\nPegasus project, said new discoveries about Khashoggi-related targets indicated an attempt\nby Saudi Arabia and others to gather intelligence on the fallout from the killing.\n\n“The targeting indicates a clear intention to know what the prosecutor and a few other high\npolitical actors were doing,” she said. “They saw Turkey as the heart of what they needed to\ncontrol.”\n\n_On Tuesday 27 July, at 8pm BST, a panel including Agnès Callamard, secretary general of_\n_Amnesty International, will discuss the global implications of the Pegasus project.
