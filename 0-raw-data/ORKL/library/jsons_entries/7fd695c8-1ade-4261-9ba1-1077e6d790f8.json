    "plain_text": "# TinyTurla - Turla deploys new malware to keep a secret backdoor on victim machines\n\n**blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/tinyturla.html**\n\n## News summary\n\nCisco Talos recently discovered a new backdoor used by the Russian Turla APT group.\nWe have seen infections in the U.S., Germany and, more recently, in Afghanistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is likely used as a stealth second-chance backdoor to keep access to infected\ndevices\nIt can be used to download, upload and/or execute files.\n\nThe backdoor code is quite simple but is efficient enough that it will usually fly under\nthe radar.\n\n## What's new?\n\nCisco Talos found a previously undiscovered backdoor from the Turla APT that we are\nseeing in the wild. This simple backdoor is likely used as a second-chance backdoor to\nmaintain access to the system, even if the primary malware is removed. It could also be used\nas a second-stage dropper to infect the system with additional malware.\n\n## How did it work?\n\nThe adversaries installed the backdoor as a service on the infected machine. They\nattempted to operate under the radar by naming the service \"Windows Time Service\", like\nthe existing Windows service. The backdoor can upload and execute files or exfiltrate files\nfrom the infected system. In our review of this malware, the backdoor contacted the\ncommand and control (C2) server via an HTTPS encrypted channel every five seconds to\ncheck if there were new commands from the operator.\n\n## So what?\n\nDue to this backdoor's limited functionality and simple coding style, it is not easy for antimalware systems to detect it as malware. We found evidence in our telemetry that this\nsoftware has been used by adversaries since at least 2020.\n\nThis malware specifically caught our eye when it targeted Afghanistan prior to the Taliban’s\n[recent takeover of the government there and the pullout of Western-backed military forces.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57659927)\nBased on forensic evidence, Cisco Talos assesses with moderate confidence that this was\nused to target the previous Afghan government.This is a good example of how easy\nmalicious services can be overlooked on today's systems that are clouded by the myriad of\nlegit services running in the background at all times. It's often difficult for an administrator to\nverify that all running services are legitimate. It is important to have software and/or\nautomated systems detecting unknown running services and a team of skilled professionals\nwho can perform a proper forensic analysis on potentially infected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malware contacts the C2 every five seconds. A good defense system would detect this\nanomaly in the network traffic and raise an alarm, showing a great example of how important\nit is to incorporate network behavior-based detection into your security approach. Turla is\nwell-known and closely monitored by the security industry. Nevertheless, they managed to\nuse this backdoor for almost two years. This clearly shows that there is room for\nimprovement on the defensive side.\n\n## Who is Turla\n\n[Turla has many names in the information security industry — it is also known as Snake,](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/)\nVenomous Bear, Uroburos and WhiteBear. It is a [notorious Russian-based and espionage-](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/turla_group)\nfocused Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that’s been active since at least 2004.\n\nOver the years, they developed and maintained a huge set of offensive tools to attack victims\nall over the world, from different European government entities, to targets in the U.S.,\nUkraine or Arabic countries.\n\nTurla likes to use compromised web servers and hijacked satellite connections for their\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure. In some operations, they also do not directly\ncommunicate to the C2 server. Instead, they use a compromised system inside the targeted\nnetwork as a proxy, which forwards the traffic to the real C2 server.\n\n[Well-known malware like Crutch or](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/) [Kazuar are attributed to Turla. Lately, we have also seen](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\n[research that has shown potential links between the Sunburst backdoor and Turla. Not every](https://securelist.com/sunburst-backdoor-kazuar/99981/)\ncampaign run by Turla can clearly be attributed to them. However, over the years, the\nsecurity industry has closely monitored the different Russian actors and technical evidence\ncombined with tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). By tracking these plus political\ninterests, it’s often possible to attribute certain campaigns and toolsets to this actor.\n\n## Technical details\n\nWe found the backdoor via our telemetry, but we didn't know the exact way the malware was\ninstalled on the victim system. We still knew the adversaries used a .bat file, similar to the\none shown later on, to install the backdoor. The backdoor comes in the form of a service DLL\ncalled w64time.dll. The description and filename makes it look like a valid Microsoft DLL.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is a real Microsoft w32time.dll on non-infected Windows systems in the\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32 directory, but it doesn't have a w64time.dll brother. The\nmalicious w64time.dll and the original w32time.dll are 64-bit PE files on a 64-bit Microsoft\nWindows system. Windows contains many applications that come in 32- and 64-bit versions,\nso it’s not easy to immediately recognize this malicious software by name.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe adversaries used a .bat file similar to the one below to install the backdoor as a\nharmless-looking fake Microsoft Windows Time service. The .bat file is also setting the\nconfiguration parameters in the registry the backdoor is using. We have removed the original\nC2 IP addresses due to ongoing investigations.\n\nThis means the malware is running as a service, hidden in the svchost.exe process. The\nDLL's ServiceMain startup function is doing not much more than executing the function we\ncalled \"main_malware,\" which includes the backdoor code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, the backdoor reads its configuration from the registry and saves it in the \"result\"\nstructure, which is later on assigned to the \"sConfig\" structure.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe whole DLL is pretty simple. It mainly consists of a few functions and two while loops,\nwhich include the whole malware logic.\n\nAfter the beginning of the first while loop, the backdoor registers itself at the C2 server. Then,\nthe reply is parsed and the backdoor is ready to receive commands. It is going through the\nlist of C2 servers stored in its registry configuration parameter until it finds one responding.\nThe hosts are stored in the aforementioned \"Hosts\" registry key in the format <IP Address\nHost1> <TcpPort> <IP Address Host2> <TcpPort> <IP Address Host3> <TcpPort>, etc. the\ndelimiter is a blank.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf none of the C2 servers respond and the end of the configured hosts list is reached, the\nmodulo operation returns zero, thus host_index is equal to zero and the backdoor waits for\nthe number of milliseconds stored in the <TimeLong> registry key. In our case, this was set\nto one minute. Then, it starts again and tries to reach the configured C2 servers, again hostby-host, until one response.\n\nIf a connection to one of the configured C2 servers was set up successfully, the backdoor\nstays in the inner while loop (C2 control loop) and checks for commands every <TimeShort>\nnumber of milliseconds.\n\nC2_GetCommand_ComHandler handles the communication with the C2 server. It leverages\nthe Windows WinHttp API similar to this [Microsoft example and receives the C2 command](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winhttp/nf-winhttp-winhttpconnect&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1630398401124000&usg=AOvVaw29t0G0W2qDR70ZKU6mkB1F)\nalong with its parameters. The adversaries use SSL/TLS to encrypt the C2 traffic.\n\nEven if the traffic is TLS encrypted, the backdoor doesn't check the certificate.\n\nThe only authentication they use is the password stored in the \"Security\" Registry key, which\nis checked at the beginning of the C2_ProcessCommand function.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the name says, the C2_ProcessCommand function handles the received C2 command. It\nis using a switch statement to execute the related backdoor function. The code below shows\nthe beginning of the switch statement.\n\n\n-----\n\nTalos has gathered the following C2_command_codes for the different backdoor functions:\n\n0x00:'Authentication'\n0x01:'Execute process'\n0x02:'Execute with output collection'\n0x03:'Download file'\n0x04:'Upload file'\n0x05:'Create Subprocess'\n0x06:'Close Subprocess '\n0x07:'Subprocess pipe in/out'\n0x08:'Set TimeLong'\n0x09:'Set TimeShort'\n0x0A:'Set new 'Security' password'\n0x0B:'Set Host(s)'\n\nAnother interesting indicator is that they are using the \"Title\" string in their HTTP headers set\nto the victim machine's GUID. The format in the HTTP header is \"Title: 01234567-12341234-1234-123456789abc\".\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTurla has been around for many years as a state-sponsored actor and will likely not go away\nsoon. Adversaries like Turla often use sophisticated malware, but they also often use what is\ngood enough to fly under the radar. Nevertheless, they are making mistakes like everyone\nelse. Talos has monitored many noisy Turla operations, for example. During their campaigns,\nthey are often using and re-using compromised servers for their operations, which they\naccess via SSH, often protected by TOR. One public reason why we attributed this backdoor\nto Turla is the fact that they used the same infrastructure as they used for other attacks that\nhave been clearly attributed to their Penguin Turla Infrastructure.\n\nWe will continue to monitor Turla and the other state-sponsored actors to protect our\ncustomers against these attacks. The majority of malware is constantly improving its\ninfection techniques. The adversaries combine clever techniques to make detection harder.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s more important now than ever to have a multi-layered security architecture in place to\ndetect these kinds of attacks. It isn't unlikely that the adversaries will manage to bypass one\nor the other security measures, but it is much harder for them to bypass all of them. These\ncampaigns and the refinement of the TTPs being used will likely continue for the foreseeable\nfuture.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1630398401127000&usg=AOvVaw01G9ufNDZEHP2Lwq3kE11V)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
