Operation Black Atlas infection chain_**\n\n**The cybercriminals will then create a test plan based on the initial probe, and then use a second set of**\n**tools to execute the said plan. In the case of the healthcare organization, the Black Atlas operators**\n\n**utilized remote access tools to steal more information and move laterally within the network. The use of**\n\n**remote access tools at this stage depends on how the target environment is configured, with the**\n\n**method of gaining remote access also varying based on the target.**\n\n**Once inside, cybercriminals then familiarize themselves with the environment. What follows is the**\n**introduction of PoS threats, which the cybercriminals source from the operation’s broad Swiss army**\n\n**knife toolbox.The favored way to introduce other tools and threats is via the built-in command-line FTP**\n\n**since antimalware solutions had already blocked the initial site we had reported last September that**\n\n**[hosted Katrina and CenterPoS.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/two-new-pos-malware-affecting-us-smbs/)**\n\n**Black Atlas operators used the modular botnet Gorynych or Diamond Fox in some installations.**\n**Gorynich was used to download a repurposed BlackPOS malware with RAM scraping functionality and**\n\n**upload all the dumped credit card numbers in memory.

We will also provide**\n\n**technical details, best practices, and recommendations to help IT managers and business owners**\n\n**evade or resolve this PoS threat.**\n\n**_With additional analysis by Erika Mendoza_**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n**[Operation Black Atlas, Part 2: Tools and Malware Used and How to Detect Them](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-black-atlas-part-2-tools-and-malware-used-and-how-to-detect-them/)**\n\n**[One-Man PoS Malware Operation Captures 22,000 Credit Card Details in Brazil](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fighterpos-fighting-a-new-pos-malware-family/)**\n\n**[Two New PoS Malware Affecting US SMBs](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/two-new-pos-malware-affecting-us-smbs/)**\n\n**[Credit Card-Scraping Kasidet Builder Leads to Spike in Detections](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/credit-card-scraping-kasidet-builder-leads-to-spike-in-detections/)**\n\n**Tags:** **[Botnets](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/botnets/)** **[SMB](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/smb/)** **[healthcare](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/healthcare/)**\n\n**[POS](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/pos/)** **[point-of-sale](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/point-of-sale/)**\n\n**Comments for this thread are now closed.**\n\n#### 0 Comments TrendLabs 1 Login\n\n**Recommend** **Share** **Sort by Best**\n\n**ALSO ON TRENDLABS**\n\n#### Trend Micro, NCA Partnership Leads to Targeted Attacks versus APTs: What’s Arrests and Shutdown of Refud.me … The Difference?�\n\n**16 comments •** **a month ago** **3 comments •** **3 months ago**\n\n**LegitBytes — This is a bunch of Bullshit,** **TrendLabs — Whether or not the Sony**\n**worry about Zeus, Betabot and other** **attack was an APT is still up for debate.
