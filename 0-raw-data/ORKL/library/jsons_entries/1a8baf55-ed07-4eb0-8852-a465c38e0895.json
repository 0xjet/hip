The main objective of nearly all credential theft malware is to gather as much\nconfidential and sensitive information, like user credentials and financial information, as\npossible.\n\nThe Oski stealer is a malicious information stealer, which was first introduced in November\n2019. As the name implies, the Oski stealer steals personal and sensitive information from\nits target. “Oski” is derived from an old Nordic word meaning Viking warrior, which is quite\nfitting considering this popular info-stealer is extremely effective at pillaging privileged\ninformation from its victims.\n\nIn this blog, we provide an in-depth analysis of an Oski stealer sample.\n\n## Background\n\nAs noted above, the Oski stealer is a classic information stealer that is being sold on Russian\nunderground hacking forums at a low price of $70-$100.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Forum thread for selling Oski Stealer_\n\nThe stealer is written in C++ and has all the typical features of credential theft malware. Oski\ntargets sensitive information including:\n\nLogin credentials from different applications\nBrowser information (cookies, autofill data and credit cards)\nCrypto wallets\nSystem information\nScreenshots\nDifferent user files\n\nBeyond these, the stealer can function as a Downloader to download a second-stage\n**malware.**\n\nEvery infection involving three parties:\n\n1. Malware authors\n2. Malware customers\n3. Malware victims\n\nThe “customers,” also known as the attackers, contact Oski authors on underground forums\nto purchase the malware and, once purchased, they configure it and distribute it to their\nvictims.\n\nOski has a very strong reputation within the underground community, with many of its\n“customers” regularly providing positive feedback and reviews about the functionality of the\nmalware.\n\nAnd, even we have to admit that Oski’s functionality works pretty well. From setting up and\nchecking the environment to stealing information by application type, Oski’s code is written\nwith purpose and care. The code is neat and clean, without any presence of useless code\nlines, however it does lack sophisticated anti-analysis tricks like anti-debugging and dynamic\nanti-analysis tricks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Malware Flow_\n\n## In-depth Analysis\n\nThe sample of Oski stealer analyzed in this blog post is:\n_aa33731aa48e2ea6d1eaab7c425f9001182c0e73e0226eb01145d6b78d7cb9eb._\n\n\n-----\n\nAs soon as we opened the Oski stealer sample in IDA, we noticed that it was packed. In our\ncase, the packer used a self-injection technique to pack Oski’s payload. It then unpacks the\npayload and writes it to a new memory region – making it easy to notice the new memory\nregion and dump it from memory.\n\nLooking at the TimeDataStamp from the file header of the unpacked PE reveals the\ncompilation time – 0x5EDFAA70 (compiled on 9 Jun 2020). The latest version for Oski\nstealer v9.1 was released on 19 June 2020, and version v9 was released on 3 Jun 2020,\nwhich means that our sample of Oski is Oski stealer v9.\n\nBefore diving into the stealer’s capabilities, it’s important to note that the malware uses two\nobfuscation techniques:\n\n**Strings encryption**\n**Dynamic loading of DLLs and functions**\n\nTo be able to start reverse-engineering the sample statically, we have to decrypt the strings\nand resolve the loaded functions and DLLs.\n\n## Strings Setup\n\nThe first function Oski calls from Main is stringsSetup – the function responsible for\ndecrypting all the strings for the malware and saving them in memory. The function holds\nseveral Base64 strings and a decryption key.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: stringSetup function_\n\nThe function decryptB64 (figure 3) gets the decryption key (which in our case is\n**_110151472500104935) and the base64 string._**\n\ndecryptB64 decodes the base64 string and decrypts the decoded information by using RC4.\nFinally, the function returns the decrypted string to the string’s setup function, which saved\nthe decrypted string within memory (Figure 3).\n\n**TIP: RC4 is a pretty common cipher that’s used by malware developers. When trying to**\nfigure out which decryption/encryption routine is used in malware, the standard process we\ntend to follow is to first start by finding any constant (“magic”) values to help reveal the\n\n\n-----\n\ndecryption/encryption routine. For RC4, there are no constant values – in fact, it s the most\npopular algorithm that doesn’t use constant values.\n\n## Function Setup\n\nThe second function Oski calls for after setting up all the strings in memory is procsSetup,\nwhich is responsible for loading different DLLs, resolving function addresses and saving the\naddresses within memory.\n\nThe names of the functions and DLLs are encrypted, therefore we must first decrypt the\nstrings and then we will be able to determine which functions and DLLs are loaded.\n\nOski gets the address for the functions LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress from memory.\nThis part of the code is written as a Position-Independent code (PIC).\n\nThere are two operations Oski performs in order to get the functions from memory:\n\nFind the base address of dll from the PEB structure of the process\nResolve the address of the functions from the export table of kernel32.dll by parsing\nthe PE within memory\n\nThe next part describes these methods and how Oski stealer implemented them.\n\nIf you are already familiar with these techniques, you can skip ahead to Back to Functions\nSetup>.\n\n### Find kernel32.dll\n\n[In x86 programs, the FS segment register holds the Thread Information Block (_TEB struct)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block)\nfor the current thread.\n\nThe _TEB structure holds a pointer within offset 0x30 to the [Process Environment Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Environment_Block)\n(_PEB), which contains information about the running process in the form of several data\nstructures and many different fields.\n\nOne of those structures is a pointer to _PEB_LDR_DATA within offset 0x0c from the start of\nthe PEB.\n\nThe _PEB_LDR_DATA struct provides information about the DLLs that are loaded into the\nprocess.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: _PEB_LDR_DATA structure_\n\nThe _PEB_LDR_DATA holds 3 pointers to 3 doubly linked lists – InLoadOrderModuleList,\nInMemoryOrderModuleList and InInitializationOrderModuleList. All provide information about\nthe loaded DLLs in the process, however the second and the third lists are good for finding\nthe desired DLL.\n\nThe list InMemoryOrderModuleList holds the DLLs loaded by the process sorted by their\n**order in memory, and the list InInitializationOrderModuleList holds the DLLs by their order**\n**of initialization.**\nThe entry within all three lists is LDR module (_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY) for the current\nDLL in the list.\n\n_Figure 5: _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY contains information about the loaded DLL. From offset\n**_0x18 from the address of _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, we can obtain the DllBase, which is_**\na pointer to the DLL base address in memory.\n\nAfter explaining the theory for getting the modules base address independently, we will\ncheck how Oski implements this technique.\n\n_Figure 6: Oski function for getting kernel32.dll base address_\n\nOski gets the base address of **_kernel32.dll from memory, which is the third entry within the_**\nLIST_ENTRY in InLoadOrderModuleList (The first entry is a pointer for the executable and\nthe second is for ntdll.dll).\n\nOski’s next steps are to get the address of LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress; both\nfunctions are exported by kernel32.dll.\n\n### Find Exported Functions\n\nOnce Oski gets the base address of kernel32.dll, it parses the PE file and loops over the\nexported functions of the DLL to get the address of the desired functions.\n\nTo do so, it needs to traverse serval headers of the DLL.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: how to get the EXPORT_DIRECTORY_\n\nAfter getting the Export Table, Oski must find the desired function by looking for the function\nname. The process is as follows:\n\nThe AddressOfNames is a pointer to an array of the exported functions names, so\nOski loops through the array and compares each function name to the desired function,\nwhile counting the position of the string in the array.\nOski gets the ordinal number for the function from the Ordinal Table. Each entry in the\ntable is 2 bytes, therefore, it must multiply the position of the function name by 2.\nFinally, Oski calculates the address for the function from the Address Table. Each entry\nin the table is 4 bytes, therefore, it must multiply the ordinal number by 4.\n\n### Back to Functions Setup\n\nOski uses a function that implements this technique for getting the function’s address from\nmemory. The function GetProcAddrPIC (figure 8) gets a pointer to the DLL base address and\na name for an exported function.\n\n_Figure 8: Oski get the address for LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress_\n\nFinally, after getting the address of those APIs, Oski can start loading DLLs and resolving\nfunction addresses. As we mentioned earlier, all the strings are encrypted, so we have to\ndecrypt them first to be able to understand statically which functions and DLLs Oski uses.\n\nGetProcAddress and LoadLibraryA are being called many times in order to load different\nDLLs and resolve functions.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo make our analysis easier, we made an IDA Python script that automates Oski setup\nstages and deobfuscates the code.\n\n## Oski Deobfuscator: An IDA Python Script\n\nThe script automates all the analysis of the setup stages for Oski stealer (v9+) and defeats\nits obfuscation to make the static analysis easier and more convenient.\n\n**Strings Setup**\n\nFind the decryption key\nDecrypt all the strings (B64, RC4)\nGive meaningful names (IDA)\nAdd comments with the full decrypted string\n\n**Functions Setup**\n\nFind LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress\nResolve the loaded DLLs and functions\nGive meaningful names to functions and DLLs (IDA)\n\n_Figure 9: Before and after using oski_ida.py_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script decrypted 380 strings, resolved 107 functions, and 11 DLLs.\nIn addition, the script dumps the addresses and the full decrypted strings to a JSON file.\n\nYou can find the script oski_ida.py on our [repo](https://github.com/cyberark/malware-research/blob/master/OskiStealer/Oski_deobfuscator/oski_ida.py)\n\nFinally, after setting up the names for the strings and functions, we can move to analyzing\nthe sample statically.\n\n## Environment Checks\n\n**CIS Check**\n\nOski checks the user language to determine if it’s part of the Commonwealth of\n**Independent States (CIS) countries. This behavior is popular, especially within crimeware**\ntools that are sold on Russian underground forums.\n\n_Figure 10: cisDetection function_\n\nOski gets the user language ID by using GetUserDefaultLangID and it compares the user\nlanguage ID to:\n\n0x423\n\n**Language ID** **Language-tag** **Location**\n\n0x43F kk-KZ Kazakhstan\n\n0x443 Us-Latb-US Uzbekistan\n\n0x82C Az-Cyrl-AZ Azerbaijan\n\n0x419 Ru-RU Russia\n\n|Language ID|Language-tag|Location|\n|---|---|---|\n|0x43F|kk-KZ|Kazakhstan|\n|0x443|Us-Latb-US|Uzbekistan|\n|0x82C|Az-Cyrl-AZ|Azerbaijan|\n\n\n-----\n\n0x422 uk-UA Ukraine\n\nBe-BY Belarus\n\nIf the user language ID matches one of the IDs above, the stealer will exit.\n\n**Anti-Emulation Check**\n\nThe second check is an anti-emulation check for Windows Defender Antivirus. The malware\ncalls to GetComputerNameA and compares the computer name to HAL9TH. In addition, it\nchecks if the username is JohnDoe by calling to GetUserNameA. Those two parameters are\nbeing used by the Windows Defender emulator.\n\n## The Stealer’s Main Functionality\n\nOski steals confidential and sensitive data from ~60 different applications, including\nbrowsers, email clients, and crypto wallets. Among its stealing features, it can also function\nas a Grabber and Loader.\n\nBefore stealing credentials from different applications, Oski sets up its “working\nenvironment.” However, in order to steal data by different methods from different\napplications, Oski has to download serval DLLs.\n\nOski downloads 7 DLLs from the C&C server and saves them in the ProgramData folder.\n\nsqlite3.dll\nfreebl3.dll\nmozglue.dll\nmsvcp140.dll\nnss3.dll\nsoftokn3.dll\nvcruntime140.dll\n\n|Be-BY|Belarus|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Oski downloads dependencies (7 DLLs)_\n\nEach DLL has its own URL address. In the Oski version we sampled, the URL for the DLL is\nthe DLL’s name – evil.cc/sqlite3.dll.\n\nIn some other versions, Oski makes the requests to evil.cc/1.jpeg, evil.cc/2.jpeg and so on,\nto download the DLLs.\n\n(1.jpeg = sqlite3.dll, 2.jpeg = freebl3.dll, 3.jpeg = mozglue.dll, 4.jpeg = msvcp140.dll, 5.jpeg =\nnss3.dll, 6.jpeg = softokn3.dll, 7.jpeg = vcruntime140.dll)\n\nBecause Oski makes those seven requests to the C&C server to download its\ndependencies, it is not very stealthy.\n\nOski creates its working folder which is named with a 15 digits randomly generated string\nwithin ProgramData like C:\\ProgramData\\234378117851778, for example. This folder will\ncontain all the stolen logs and data. In addition, it creates four folders inside the working\nfolder:\n\n\n-----\n\nautofill – autofill data from browsers\ncc – credit card data\ncookies – browsers cookies\ncrypto – cryptocurrency wallets\n\n### Browsers and Email Clients\n\nOski steals login credentials, cookies, credit card and autofill information from 30+\ndifferent browsers using well-known and familiar stealing methods.\n\nIt has four different methods to steal data from different types of browses, like Mozilla based\napplications, Opera, Internet Explorer and Chromium-based browsers.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Oski updated its stealing technique regarding Chromium-based\nbrowsers and now supports the new method (v80+) by Chromium for encrypting credentials\nand cookies with a global AES key that is stored within\n_%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Local State and encrypted by using DPAPI._\nPrior to version 80 of Chromium, the credentials and cookies were simply encrypted by\nDPAPI instead that AES key.\n\nFurthermore, Oski collects information about the connected Outlook accounts from the\nregistry like passwords and confidential data about the IMAP and SMTP servers and it\ndumps all the data to file named outlook.txt.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: stealing data from Outlook registry profiles_\n\nWe won’t cover Oski’s stealing techniques as they aren’t terribly innovative and have been\nreviewed many times, but you can find an explanation about most of these techniques in this\n[whitepaper on the Raccoon stealer.](https://lp.cyberark.com/rs/316-CZP-275/images/CyberArk-Labs-Racoon-Malware-wp.pdf)\n\n### Cryptocurrency Wallets\n\n\n-----\n\nOski also steals wallets and confidential files that are related to crypto wallet applications. It\ntargets 28 crypto wallet applications, which store sensitive data in files. An example is the\nmost known file- wallet.dat _which contains the confidential data about the wallet including_\n**private keys, public keys, etc.**\n\nThe stealer checks for the default wallet file location in AppData and copies it to the working\nfolder.\n\n_Figure 13: Oski stealing from crypto wallets apps_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration for this module:\n\n|App Name|App Folder|Regex (sensitive file)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Anoncoin|\\Anoncoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|BBQCoin|\\BBQCoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Bitcoin|\\Bitcoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|DashCore|\\DashCore\\|*wal*.dat|\n|devcoin|\\devcoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|digitalcoin|\\digitalcoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|ElectronCash|\\ElectronCash\\wallets\\|default_wallet|\n|Electrum|\\Electrum\\wallets\\|default_wallet|\n|Electrum-LTC|\\Electrum- LTC\\wallets\\|default_wallet|\n|Ethereum|\\Ethereum\\|keystore|\n|Exodus|\\Exodus\\|exodus.conf.json window- state.json|\n|Exodus|\\Exodus\\exodus.wallet\\|passphrase.json seed.seco info.seco|\n|Florincoin|\\Florincoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Franko|\\Franko\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Freicoin|\\Freicoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|GoldCoinGLD|\\GoldCoin (GLD)\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Infinitecoin|\\Infinitecoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|IOCoin|\\IOCoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Ixcoin|\\Ixcoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|jaxx|\\com.liberty.jaxx\\IndexedDB\\file__0.indexeddb.leveldb\\|*|\n|Litecoin|\\Litecoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Megacoin|\\Megacoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|---|---|---|\n|Mincoin|\\Mincoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|MultiDoge|\\MultiDoge\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Namecoin|\\Namecoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Primecoin|\\Primecoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Terracoin|\\Terracoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|YACoin|\\YACoin\\|*wal*.dat|\n|Zcash|\\Zcash\\|*wal*.dat|\n\n\n## Collect System Information\n\nSimilar to other classic stealers, Oski gathers information about the system and takes a\nscreenshot of the user’s desktop. It then writes the information to system.txt and saves the\nscreenshot to screenshot.jpg.\n\n**System**\n\nWindows version, computer architecture, username, computer name, system\nlanguage, Machine ID, GUID, domain name and Workgroup name.\n**Hardware**\n\nProcessor type, number of processors, video card type, display resolution, RAM size,\nand checks if the computer is a laptop or desktop. Oski checks if the computer is a\nlaptop by calling to GetSystemPowerStatus – the function retrieves information about\n[the power status of the system. The returned struct contains a one-byte flag named](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/ns-winbase-system_power_status)\nbatteryFlag, which can indicate if the system has a battery or not.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: checkLaptop function_\n\n**Local time**\n**Network**\n\nOski has hardcoded values for this section, so the log will always contain unknown\nvalues – IP: IP? and Country: Country?\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: Oski writes the useless values_\n\n**Installed Software**\nGet the installed applications on the machine and its version. Oski has a typo in this\nsection, the title is Installed Softwrare, instead of “Software,” so this typo is unique for\nOski logs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Oski system log_\n\n**Screenshot**\n\n## Grabber Module\n\nOski also has a recursive grabber that collects particular files from the victim’s computer.\n\nThe module is configurable, allowing the attacker to decide whether to enable this module\nand if so, which files to collect from the user.\n\nOski creates a POST request to main.php in the C&C. In our case, the URL is\nhttp://sl9XA73g7u3EO07WT42n7f4vIn5fZH[.]biz/main.php. The response from the C&C\ncontains the configuration for the grabber.\n\nThe first part of the Grabber function is parsing the response data. The parsing function uses\nstrtok function while passing the delimiter “;” and the response data from the C&C.\n\nIt extracts the first three tokens from the configuration and passes them to the “main\nfunction” of the grabber. After the first three tokens, the parsing function takes the next three\ntokens, and so on.\n\nIn this way, we can figure out that the structure of the configuration has three parts\n(parameters) and that the configuration can hold several tasks.\n\nLet’s focus on mainGrabber function. This function gets three arguments, which are the three\ntokens from the configuration, each call to mainGrabber is called “task.”\n\nThe task structure has three fields (parameters):\n\n1. A name for the zip file – will contain all the stolen files that related to the current task.\n\nOski concatenates to this name an underscore at the beginning, so the name for the\nzip will be _%name%.zip.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. An environment variable name and folder name – a starting point for the\n\n_recursiveGrabber._\n3. A regex list – contains multiply parameters that are separated by “,” each one of them\n\nis a regex that represents a file type.\n\nThe recursiveGrabber gets those three “task” parameters.\n\n_Figure 17: calling to recursiveGrabber and loop of the regex list_\n\nWhile doing this research, we extracted several configurations from other C&Cs, so the\ngrabber configuration looks like:\n\nDocuments;USERPROFILE\\Documents;*.jpg,*.img,*.json,*.txt;\n\ndesktop;USERPROFILE\\Desktop;*.jpg,*.img,*.json,*.txt;\n\nFor this C&C, the attacker created two tasks to collect jpg, img, json and txt files from the\nuser Desktop and Documents. Oski will save those files in 2 separate zip files named\n__Documents.zip and _deksop.zip._\n\nFrom reviewing the extracted configurations from other C&C servers, we understand that\nother attackers have intents to collect different files, like 2fa files, wallet files from different\nlocations or even personal documents.\n\n[The extracted configuration for other C&C servers can be found in our IoCs page: IoCs.pdf](https://github.com/cyberark/malware-research/blob/master/OskiStealer/IoCs.pdf)\n\n## Downloader\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter stealing the sensitive data from the user and grabbing the files, Oski adds the stolen\nfiles to a new zip file whose name of the contains the 10 characters from the working folder\nname and an underscore at the beginning.\n\n_Figure 18: zip file content_\n\nAfter sending the zip file, the C&C server should send within the response the domain for\nthe downloader. The response might be empty if the feature isn’t enabled.\n\nOski downloads the next malware from the given domain and executes it.\n\nThe stealer creates a random file name with a .exe extension and sets the stream\nZone.Identifier of the file to [ZoneTransfer] ZoneId=2, which indicates that the file has been\ndownloaded from a trusted site.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19: Loader function_\n\n## Self-Removal\n\nOski removes its traces from the machine and deletes all the files, logs, DLLs, etc. from the\ndisk.\n\nIn addition, it creates a new process of cmd.exe while the parameters for cmd.exe are /c\n/taskkill /pid <pid> & erase <path> & RD /S /Q <working_folder>\\* & exit to kill the malware\nprocess and delete other files.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough Oski stealer doesn’t target as many types of software as other stealers, it is still\neffective, continues to be updated and improved and maintains a strong reputation in the\nunderground community.\n\nThe unique characteristic of credential theft malware is that they don’t require any special\npermissions. Because of this, they are a popular resource for attacks and ultimately can\ncause significant damage – especially as attackers continue to seek out privileged\ncredentials and look for opportunities to escalate their privileges for massive data theft or\nbusiness disruption.\n\nTo combat against credential theft malware like Oski, we recommend the following:\n\n**Be aware – avoiding clicking suspicious URLs, opening unknown attachments, or**\ndownloading and running unfamiliar applications.\n**Deploy MFA – using multi-factor authentication where applicable.**\n**Use strong and unique passwords – don’t use the same passwords for all the**\nservices and replace them on a regular cadence.\n**Leverage credential protection solutions – A credential protection solution can**\ndefend against the fundamental nature of credential stealers and protect credentials\nfrom getting harvested by attackers.\n\n## Appendix\n\n YARA Rule\n\n[Oski_Stealer.yara](https://github.com/cyberark/malware-research/blob/master/OskiStealer/Oski_Stealer.yara)\n\n## Targeted Applications\n\n**Browsers**\n\nInternet Explorer\n\nGoogle Chrome, Chromium, Kometa, Amigo, Torch, Orbitum, Comodo Dragon, Nichrome,\nMaxthon, Sputnik, Epic Privacy Browser, Vivaldi, CocCoc Browser, Uran Browser, QIP Surf,\nCent, Elements Browser, TorBro, Microsoft Edge, CryptoTab, Brave\n\nOpera\n\nMozilla Firefox, Pale Moon, Waterfox, Cyberfox, BlackHawk, IceCat, KMeleon\n\n**Email Clients**\n\nThunderbird\n\nOutlook\n\n\n-----\n\n**Crypto Wallets**\nAnoncoin, BBQCoin, Bitcoin, DashCore, ElectronCash, Electrum, Electrum-LTC, Ethereum,\nExodus, Florincoin, Franko, Freicoin, GoldCoinGLD, IOCoin, Infinitecoin, Ixcoin, Litecoin,\nMegacoin, Mincoin, MultiDoge, Namecoin, Primecoin, Terracoin, YACoin, Zcash, devcoin,\ndigitalcoin, jaxx\n\n## IoCs\n\n[IoCs.pdf](https://github.com/cyberark/malware-research/blob/master/OskiStealer/IoCs.pdf)\n\n[[1] Basics of Windows shellcode writing](https://idafchev.github.io/exploit/2017/09/26/writing_windows_shellcode.html)\n\n\n-----",
