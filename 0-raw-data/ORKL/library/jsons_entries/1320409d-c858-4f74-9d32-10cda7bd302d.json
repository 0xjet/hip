According to the\nresearchers, Conti and Diavol had striking similarities including:\n\n“The two ransomware families’… use of asynchronous I/O operations for file encryption\nqueuing to using virtually identical command-line parameters for the same functionality (i.e.,\nlogging, drives and network shares encryption, network scanning).”\n\nDespite the similarities, there is no direct connection that the Trickbot gang developed\nDiavol like Conti and Ryuk. Because Trickbot is used for access as a service for ransomware\ngangs it is affiliated with, the connection between Diavol and the Trickbot gang cannot be\nassumed, but from a practical defense perspective, organizations should continue to focus\nefforts on detecting Trickbot, Cobalt Strike, and domain profiling reconnaissance methods\nused prior to ransomware deployment.\n\n\n-----",
