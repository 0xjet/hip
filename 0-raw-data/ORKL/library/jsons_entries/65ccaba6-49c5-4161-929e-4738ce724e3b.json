Recently it has changed it’s usual payload and we\nhave seen Quant Loader, Coin Miner and KINS.\n\nThis time it is back and dropped a payload which I have struggled to ID. It has all the\ncharacteristics of an infostealer (gathering data then sending to C2). I’ve been unable to\ndecipher what data it is ending and why. The C2 domains also did not trigger any ET/Snort\nrules.\n\nIt’s interesting for sure and I’d be interested to know more about it so keep an eye on Twitter.\n\n## Background Information:\n\nA few articles on Rig exploit kit and it’s evolution:\n\n[https://www.uperesia.com/analyzing-rig-exploit-kit](https://www.uperesia.com/analyzing-rig-exploit-kit)\n\n[http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2016/10/rig-evolves-neutrino-waves-goodbye.html](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2016/10/rig-evolves-neutrino-waves-goodbye.html)\n\n[http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55354/cyber-crime/rig-exploit-kit-cerber.html](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55354/cyber-crime/rig-exploit-kit-cerber.html)\n\n## Downloads\n\n(in password protected zip)\n\n[21-September-2018-Rig-Infostealer-PCAP-> Pcap of traffic](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/21-september-2018-rig-infostealer-pcap.zip)\n[21-September-2017-Rig-Infostealer-CSV-> CSV of traffic for IOC’s](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/21-september-2017-rig-infostealer-csv.zip)\n[21-September-2017-Infostealer-> Infostealer –](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=01836829626557774852)\n3f9fd83a014de13794d4a701883e029de802533bac37f8c4489e7e00053054bb\n\nUnfortunately having a few issues with WordPress so the payload is on tinyupload for now.\nLet me know if it goes down.\n\n## Details of infection chain:\n\n(click to enlarge!)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Full Details:\n\nRulan has been providing various payloads over the past week or so. A coin miner and even\n[KINS was spotted earlier this week by @nao_sec. It is still using a JS redirector and a HTTP](https://twitter.com/nao_sec)\nrefresh to redirect the victim to Rig EK.\n\n\n-----\n\nRig itself continues to change up it’s parameters this time using “opas“, “hopas” and “shops“.\n\nThe RC4 key is now “marydcetoz“. You can use this to decrypt the payload from the pcap.\n\nThe payload appeared to be an infostealer by nature. I was unable to identify it though\nsought the aid of [@James_inthe_box who digged further but could not identify it.](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box)\n\n**SHA-256** 3f9fd83a014de13794d4a701883e029de802533bac37f8c4489e7e00053054bb\n\n\n-----\n\n**File**\n**name**\n\n\n[eb11bac9e73f7f6fed3506e28a13dacbfa3fbdc0](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3f9fd83a014de13794d4a701883e029de802533bac37f8c4489e7e00053054bb/detection)\n\n\n**File size** 288 KB\n\nThe payload copied itself into a folder called “ZSysRaw” and the binary was named\n“sysraw.exe“. It then began to collect information and store it in a folder called “data“.\n\nThe malware began with a POST request ending with “load.php“. It looks like Base64 but I\ncould not decode it into anything meaningful.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext it began to POST data from the text files it created. Again I could not decode this data.\nEach text file it created it then sent to the C2 with each file reaching a size of around 3kb~.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload did not trigger any signatures (ET/Snort) though it s behaviour is indicative of an\ninformation stealer. Keep checking Twitter, it’s likely some more info will come!\n\n\n-----",
