    "plain_text": "# HELO Winnti: Attack or Scan?\n\n**lastline.com/labsblog/helo-winnti-attack-scan/**\n\nSeptember 30, 2019\n\nPosted by [Jason Zhang and](https://www.lastline.com/author/jzhang/) [Stefano Ortolani ON SEP 30, 2019](https://www.lastline.com/author/stefano/)\nSince its first attack was discovered nearly a decade ago, Winnti has evolved into an advanced\nand sophisticated toolkit leveraged by several actors such as APT17, Axiom, Barium, and\nPassCV, just to name a few. All these actors have been sharing core tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs), leading to highly persistent implants targeting organizations from the online\ngaming industry to high-tech companies around the globe. It comes as no surprise that both\nsecurity vendors and researchers are still scrutinizing and tracking this specific threat.\n\nWhile no new campaign has been publicly reported after the one targeting German\nPharmaceutical companies in April 2019 [1], since July 2019 we have been seeing a dramatic\nincrease of network activity related to Winnti. Figure 1 displays all daily alerts from more than two\nmonths of telemetry data since mid-June 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Winnti daily alerts timeline.\n\nAs it turned out, this telemetered traffic was due to external Winnti check-ins or “Winnti HELO”\nmessages sent out by non-malicious Winnti scanners looking for hosts infected by the Winnti\nimplant. Thanks to the massive increase of investigation-oriented traffic, the actual signal from\nreal attacks is buried in the noise generated by scan traffic. Such extremely low signal-to-noise\nratio poses huge challenges for both investigators and customers looking to identify real attacks.\n\nIn this report, we investigate the magnitude of this phenomenon, attempt to mitigate these\nchallenges, and propose an effective triage process benefiting the whole security community. We\nstart by providing a brief overview of the Winnti toolkit implants lifecycle. Then, we discuss the\nlast two months of internal telemetry data showing the dramatic increase of Winnti traffic from\nvarious sources, and explain why this is a challenging problem for both researchers and network\nadministrators. Finally, we provide a deep dive on the issue, share our findings, and propose an\neffective triage process tailored to both researchers and security professionals.\n\n## What is Winnti?\n\nWinnti represents a malware family with Remote Access Trojan (RAT) functionalities. The\nmemory-resident malware is highly persistent: once it is successfully installed on a victim’s host, it\ngives the criminals the capability to control the infected computer without the victim’s knowledge.\nHistorically, the targets attacked vary from online gaming companies to pharmaceutical industry\n(more details are discussed in a later section).\n\nThe actors behind Winnti have been active at least since 2009, and, throughout the decade since\nits initial attack, Winnit has been evolving into a more advanced and sophisticated toolkit. The\ntoolkit comprises four main components, all taking part in the execution cycle (as thoroughly\nexplained by Novetta in their Winnti Analysis [3]):\n\n_Dropper: a module responsible for dropping the Winnti malware on a victim’s machine_\n_Worker: a module responsible for communication (such as parsing HELO messages) and_\nplugin management\n_Service: a module whose primary function is to activate the engine component_\n_Engine: a module that only exists in memory once activated by the Service component; its_\nmain function is to fulfill the malware installation process after the Service component\npasses control to the Install function in the engine component\n\n\n-----\n\nExtensive investigations on the malware have been published by Kaspersky [2], Novetta [3], and\nThyssenkrupp’s CERT [4], with a more recent case study by Chronicle [5] about a Linux variant.\nOnce the highly persistent memory-resident implant is successfully installed on a victim’s host,\nthe malware operators can initiate a check-in connection directly to an infected host without\nrelying on a C2 server (though it does call out to a C2 server to receive commands in some\ncases). Figure 2 shows the main timeline of the malware development since the first reported\nattack and the possible threat groups behind the attacks according to various reports [2-3, 6].\n\nFigure 2: Winnti evolution timeline.\n\n## Winnti 1.0/2.0\n\nKasperksy initially reported on attacks relying on Winnti 1.0 and 2.0 in 2013, including evidence of\nactivity dating back to 2009 [2]. Winnti 1.0 was capable of stealing certificates from its targets,\nand is believed to be the very first identified malware with a valid (stolen) certificate targeting the\nWindows 64-bit operating systems. Certificates have been becoming increasingly important as\nrecent operating systems have been starting to limit execution to digitally signed executables. As\na consequence, the abuse of digitally signed malware became a very effective and sustainable\napproach in Winnti-related attacks. The APT17, Barium, Lead, and PassCV groups are thought to\nhave strong connections with these attacks [6].\n\n## Winnti 3.0\n\nWinnti 3.0 was first made public in the article published by Novetta in 2015 [3]. The report notes\nthat the malware was actually compiled in mid-to-late 2014. According to the Novetta’s findings,\nWinnti 3.0 is very similar to its predecessors, but the dropper component evolved to incorporate\nsome anti-analysis mechanisms, making the malware investigation more difficult. The criminal\nactivity exploiting Winnti 3.0 exhibits TTPs that are very similar to attacks operated by the Axiom\ngroup, which is known to carry out cyber-espionage attacks against a whole range of industries.\n\n## Targeted Industries: From Games to Pills\n\n\n-----\n\nWinnti-based attacks initially targeted online gaming companies. The motivation for these attacks\nwas twofold. Once gained control of the game servers, criminals could monetize the attack by\nconverting virtual funds into real money and/or deploying stolen source code from the\ncompromised servers into their own pirate servers. The second objective was to steal codesigning certificates, which could then be used to sign malicious applications when attacking\nhigher-value organizations.\n\nSuch exclusive targeting (only game organizations) changed by the end of 2014, marking the\nexpansion of the target focus to other industries, German chemical and pharmaceutical\nconglomerates in particular [2-3]. The latest victims of this wave were reported in April 2019 [1].\nNote that the list of targets does not stop here, as political activists and news portals had also\nbeen targeted [2,6]. Figure 3 summarizes which entities have been targeted over time, based on\nthe information we collected at the time of the investigation.\n\nFigure 3: Winnti targeted entities over time.\n\n## Tracking Winnti\n\nAs we mentioned before, once the implant is installed on an infected host, the attack operators\ncan directly communicate with the host [5]. To be more specific, a rootkit deployed together with\nthe worker component allows Winnti to intercept and redirect specifically crafted TCP connections\nfrom ports already used by legitimate applications: if the first part of the payload of the TCP flow\nis 16 bytes long, and follows a specific format, the rootkit redirects the rest of the connection\ntowards its worker module (see [3,5] for more details).\n\nThis specific communication approach between the threat actor and the infected host provides a\ngreat way for investigators to track Winnti activity and subsequently detect the malware. This was\nsuccessfully demonstrated by ThyssenKrupp’s CERT, as they recently released a set of opensource tools able to detect and mimic “Winnti HELO” messages [4]. The underlying logic is quite\nstraightforward: the tool starts by sending a 16-byte long message to a candidate host (any\ndestination port already open would work), and checks the replied message to determine whether\nthe implant is installed. This allowed security companies and professionals to develop and deploy\nmass-scan agents scouting the Internet, hoping to find hosts infected by the Winnti implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore, determining whether a host is infected is equivalent to finding out how the host\nresponds to a “Winnit HELO” message (first packet of the Winnti check-in). This leads to two\ndifferent scenarios (see Figure 4):\n\nIf a host is not infected by Winnti, it will just reply with an error message depending on the\nparticular application listening on the port receiving the “Winnti HELO” packet.\nIf instead the host is infected, the Winnti rootkit will hijack the “Winnti HELO” message, and\nredirect it to the worker module of the malware. Once the HELO message is validated, the\n_worker component checks if the 3rd DWORD value in the operation request message_\n(second packet of the Winnti check-in) is \\0xABC18CBA, the magic number [5]. If verified\nsuccessfully, it will execute the request and provide the host’s system information.\n\nIt is worth noting that the “Winnti HELO” message (the first packet of a Winnti check-in as shown\nin Figure 4) comprises 4 DWORDs generated by a pseudo-random integer number generator [45]. We will detail how the HELO messages are generated in a later section.\n\nFigure 4: Winnti check-ins and responses from hosts with/out infection.\n\n## New challenges\n\nThe idea of using mimicked “Winnti HELO” messages does indeed ease the challenge of finding\ninfected hosts, but it also introduces a new problem: noise. Since all publicly available signatures\n(like the Suricata IDS rule released as part of the aforementioned open-source tools) flag a\npossible Winnti attack whenever a “Winnti HELO” message is detected, each external scan now\nautomatically translates to a new alert.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result, the superimposed network traffic with dominant noisy scan signals poses huge\nchallenges for both researchers and SOC analysts. In particular:\n\nIt greatly impairs the threat hunters’ ability to monitor the threat actors’ activity. Although\nemulating the “Winnti HELO” message does help to disclose the number of implants that\nare present in a network, the process of differentiating real attacks from benign scans\nbecomes much more complicated. Before researchers started scanning the whole Internet,\nevery rogue HELO message would have been correlated to an actual attack. Now, it is no\nlonger the case.\nIt also significantly slows down the triage of a network event in a SOC, which is already\nchallenged by a non-negligible number of cyber alerts and attacks from other vectors. The\ndramatic increase of alerts caused by non-malicious Winnti scanners requires more\nresources and effort for investigation, making the analysts’ work even more challenging and\nless efficient.\n\nAs it is often the case, the situation can be eased by deploying more complex but expensive\nsolutions, able to deep-inspect the Winnti protocol. This approach might not however be practical\nfor many organizations, small companies in particular, which are left with several challenges to\neffectively triage Winnti alerts. In the following sections, we will briefly review the most common\nexamples, and we will conclude with an effective and easy-to-implement method that can\nconsiderably mitigate all these challenges.\n\n## Rely on source IP addresses? No\n\nOne might suggest to use the source IP address to determine whether the check-in is a scan or\nan attack. Figure 5 illustrates what a Winnti check-in traffic looks like, where the host 192.168.2.6,\npart of the protected network, receives check-in messages from both the 218.211.168.178 and\n_155.94.254.143 IP addresses. Is there an attack within the traffic?_\n\nFigure 5: Is it an attack or a scan?\n\nThere is no easy answer to this question, because the scans are generated from several source\nIP addresses, many changing every week, making whitelisting a non-scalable work-around.\nFigure 6 shows the source IP address distribution based on two months of internal telemetry data\nsince June 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Check-in source IP address distribution between June – August 2019.\n\nAs we can see, the IP addresses are from a wide range of sources. Interestingly, some are wellknown scanners (which can be easily whitelisted), but many IP addresses are unknown, or\nbelong to random cloud VMs (possibly provisioned/deployed by researchers inspired by recent\nnews). Examples of well-known scanners are:\n\n- 155.94.254.143: scanner03.project25499.com\n\n- 172.104.242.173: winnti-scanner-victims-will-be-notified.threatsinkhole.com\n\n- 176.58.124.134: tequilaboomboom.club\n\n- 98.143.148.135: scanner05.project25499.com\n\nThe two IP addresses dominating the chart above are from this last set. For instance, one has a\nsingle self-explanatory page with the following message:\n\nFigure 7: A landing page from a cloud VM-based scanner.\n\nIt is worth noting that we also found some evidence of scans originating from private IP\naddresses, indicating that some of the check-ins were coming from within the local network.\nWhile we acknowledge that proactive security teams might be actively looking for infected\nendpoints, the most probable explanation is that such internal hosts might also be acting as a\nrouter, SNATing connections originating from outside (this normally happens when the traffic is\nnot monitored from the perimeter but from inside the network), as depicted in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: A Winnti scans appearing to originate from a private IP address; the most likely explanation being an\n\nexternal host contacting a service hosted on 10.2.138.7, whose port was forwarded to the DMZ by the router\n\nrunning on 172.31.2.6.\n\nAdmittedly, this can be very confusing for SOC analysts: the mere presence of a check-in\noriginating from inside the perimeter is an obvious cause of concern. It is clear how the\ninvestigation into the causes can take a significant amount of time and effort. This demonstrates\nthat simply whitelisting private IP addresses without proper investigation may lead to security\nrisks.\n\n## Rely on destination ports? No\n\nAlso destination ports are not reliable, simply because they are meaningless for Winnti, as it can\nbasically use any open port. The chart below shows the distribution of scan destination ports in\nour internal telemetry data.\n\nFigure 9: Scan destination port distribution (percentage) between June – August 2019.\n\nAs Figure 9 shows, the scans are distributed over a number of ports. The reason why we see\nmore check-ins on 80 and 443 (HTTP/HTTPs) ports is because those are normally available to all\nconnections, internal and external alike (unlike, say, SSH).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigation\n\nA successful three-way handshake is the first requirement for a check-in to be successful\n(regardless of the fact that it was a scan or a real attack). If the connection is not successful then\nwe know there is no infection. The only case where further analysis is required is when there is\nan established connection, and in such case we need to inspect the response by taking into\naccount the specific application-layer protocol used by the server to reply.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, if the first message of the TCP flow is 16 bytes long (and it follows a\nspecific format), the rootkit will redirect the rest of the connection towards its worker module. This\nconnection hijacking capability allows us to effectively identify whether a host is infected or not. In\nother words, if the application-layer protocol returns a standard message upon a “Winnti HELO”\ncheck-in, it implies that the host is not infected (the check-in did not result in a hijacked\nconnection). More details are discussed in the following typical cases.\n\n## HTTP\n\nWhen the attackers send the Winnti HELO message using a connection established on port 80,\nthe most likely service listening, if any, is a web server. This means that if the request can not be\nparsed by the userspace process (the web server), the most likely answer is a web page detailing\nthat the parsing failed. As the screenshot below shows, the HTTP server returns a 400 status\npage upon the incoming “Winnti HELO” check-in. This indicates that the server is not infected by\nWinnti.\n\nFigure 10: An HTTP server returns a parsing error in response to a “Winnti HELO” check-in.\n\n## SMTP\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly, if an SMTP server being scanned returns an error message after receiving a Winnti\ncheck-in on port 25 (most likely), it is clear that the connection reached the user space\napplication. This implies that there was no Winnti implant on the host. The figure below illustrates\nthe inbound and outbound messages on an SMTP server. The server received two incoming\npackets from a Winnti connection. The first one is a 16-byte long “Winnti HELO” message,\nfollowed by an encrypted message. As the SMTP server is not infected, it responded with an\nerror message, indicating that it was not able to parse the request from the first packet.\n\nFigure 11: An SMTP server replies with a server message upon “Winnti HELO” check-in.\n\nIt is worth noting that all communications using other protocols such as Telnet or FTP (clear-text\nprotocols) can be triaged by inspecting the protocols. Most of the time it is easy to understand\nwhether the response is legitimate, albeit the process can be time-consuming\n\n## HTTPS\n\nChecking TLS-encrypted connections is much more challenging, because the data received from\nan endpoint does not clearly show whether the response is generated by a Winnti implant or just\nby the associated server.\n\nFigure 12: An HTTPS server replies a short message upon “Winnti HELO” check-in.\n\nIn these cases, we need to rely on other clues, for example the intrinsic characteristics of a valid\nresponse to a Winnti check-in. The Winnti underlying protocol relies on responses that are 16\nbytes long. This is because the initial handshake needs at least 16 bytes to encode details of the\nkey exchange mechanism. This means that if the encrypted response to a Winnti HELO packet is\nshorter than that amount, then we can infer that the host is not infected. Coincidentally, the TLS\nrecord sent when the request can not be parsed is smaller (as shown in Figure 12, more details\n\n\n-----\n\non TLS handshake protocol can be found in [8]). Our statistics show that over 50% of all checkins are on port 443 (HTTPs). All of them are less than 16 bytes. Hence more than half of all the\nreceived check-ins can be ruled out deterministically without requiring manual inspection.\n\n## HELO values distribution\n\nWhile analyzing the traffic, we also turned our attention to the DWORDs (HELO values from now\non) used to assemble the first packet of the Winnti check-in and found some anomalies about the\nvalue distribution. Interestingly, we identified some artifacts in a popular scanner [4] that would\noften lead to the generation of identical HELO values, devoid of any randomization required to\nkeep the generated traffic indistinguishable from malicious HELO messages. Case in point, we\nfound the following HELO message to be one of the most prevalent:\n\n```\n9\\xcd\\xc3V\\x8c&\\x12Dz/\\xb7\\xc0t\\x96C\\xe2\n\n```\n\nBased on our telemetry data, these specific HELO values had been used 6,429 times out of all\n14,962 check-ins we collected, which is about 43% of all the records.\n\nAnother interesting anomaly is related to the message detailing the operation requested (the byte\nsequence immediately following the HELO values): 32.4% of the time, for unknown reasons (but\nwe speculate that this might be caused by some errors in the scanner logic), it lacked encryption\n(you can in fact notice the magic values \\0xABC18CBA highlighted below should be encrypted in\nthe operation request, as often documented in other articles [4-5]).\n```\n\\x00F\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xba\\x8c\\xc1\\xab\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x04F\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03\n\\x08\\xbb=)\\xb2\\x17\\xc4$\\xed\\xaa\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00++\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00(\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n```\nWe also identified an additional very frequent HELO message:\n\n```\n\\xae\\xd0\\xab,>\\xf9JB2.r\\xc2\\xd9\\xee\\x9c\\xfe\n\n```\n\nThis specific instance appeared 3,591 times (or 24% of 14,962), and 99.999% of the time was\nfollowed by the same encrypted operation request sequence.\n\nBased on our research the underlying reason why we see so many anomalies generated by the\nNmap-based scanner for Winnti, is because the core of the Nmap Scripting Engine is an\nembeddable Lua interpreter (a lightweight language designed for extensibility). There is a known\nissue with Lua’s internal pseudo-random integer number generator, i.e., `math.random(), in`\nMacOS and FreeBSD [7]: the difference of the seeds generated when executing the engine on\nthose operating systems is very small, and it gets lost during the random number generation [7].\nThis explains why the seed remains the same each time `math.random() is called, resulting in`\nthe generated numbers to follow the same exact distribution. More interestingly, this behavior is\neven more pronounced after the last code commit [4] (see Figure 13).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Last code change from the GitHub repository [4].\nAs we can see, `os.time() was replaced by` `math.random(1, 0xffffffff) . While,`\nbefore the merge, one of the HELO DWORDs, albeit not random, was still following a monotonic\ndistribution ( os.time() returns the system time in seconds), after the commit all generated\nnumbers were susceptible to the seed issue we just described, leading to a portion of the HELO\nmessage being often constant. This is exactly what we noticed while analyzing Winnti check-ins,\nconfirming our suspicion that such HELO messages were after all generated by benign scanners,\nnot real attacks. It is important to notice that this flaw can also be abused by Winnti actors to\nselectively discard scan HELO messages. To eliminate this concern, the fix is to add\n```\nmath.randomseed(os.time() ) (to have a real random seed each time) before calling\nmath.random() to get better pseudo-random numbers (see Figure 14).\n\n```\nFigure 14: Add math.randomseed(os.time()) to generate pseudo-random numbers.\n\nNote that once the generation of random numbers is fixed as outlined, it is not possible anymore\nto whitelist specific Winnti check-in packets known to originate from benign scanners.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOver the last decade Winnti has evolved into an advanced and sophisticated toolkit. Nowadays,\nmany organizations of different size still suffer from such attacks. In the meantime, emulated\n“Winnti HELO” check-ins hoping to identify infected hosts have led to a dramatic increase in\nnetwork activity, posing new challenges to security professionals whose job is the triaging of\nnetwork-based attacks. In this report, we carried out a comprehensive investigation of all Winnti\nalerts collected over two months of internal telemetry data, including:\n\nOverview of the Winnti toolkit implants life cycle\nThe cause behind the dramatic increase of Winnti activity\n\n\n-----\n\nNew challenges tracking Winnti activity and how they affect SOC s triage processes\n\nThen, we demonstrated how we can considerably mitigate the challenges in differentiating real\nattacks from benign scans. More specifically,\n\nIf a host is not infected by Winnti, it is not able to parse an incoming “Winnti HELO”\nmessage; if there is an application listening on that specific port it will also respond with an\napplication-layer error message.\nIf a host is infected by Winnti, the Winnti rootkit hijacks the check-in message and redirects\nthe rest of the connection towards its worker module.\n\nIn addition, we also investigated the distribution of HELO values and identified a few flaws (e.g.,\nconstant values), leading us to believe that such HELO messages were probably generated by\nbenign scanners, not real attacks. Note that a motivated attacker can always modify the current\nWinnti implant to selectively ignore such “anomalous” check-ins, as a covert attempt to fly under\nthe radar. The fix we propose in this article generates pseudo-random numbers even across\ndifferent scanner’s executions, thus removing this glitch which leads to semi-predictable behavior.\n\n## References\n\n1. “Bayer contains cyber attack it says bore Chinese hallmarks”,\nhttps://in.reuters.com/article/bayer-cyber/bayer-says-has-detected-contained-cyber-attackidINKCN1RG0NF, accessed: 09/2019\n\n2. “ ‘Winnti’ More than just a game”, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wpcontent/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20134508/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf, accessed:\n09/2019\n\n3. “WINNTI ANALYSIS”, https://www.novetta.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/04/novetta_winntianalysis.pdf, accessed: 09/2019\n\n4. “Nmap Script to scan for Winnti infections”, [https://github.com/TKCERT/winnti-nmap-script,](https://github.com/TKCERT/winnti-nmap-script)\naccessed: 09/2019\n\n5. “Winnti: More than just Windows and Gates”, https://medium.com/chronicle-blog/winnti-morethan-just-windows-and-gates-e4f03436031a, accessed: 09/2019\n\n6. “Burning Umbrella: An Intelligence Report on the Winnti Umbrella and Associated StateSponsored Attackers”, [https://401trg.com/burning-umbrella/, accessed: 09/2019](https://401trg.com/burning-umbrella/)\n\n7. “Math Library Tutorial”, [http://lua-users.org/wiki/MathLibraryTutorial, accessed: 09/2019](http://lua-users.org/wiki/MathLibraryTutorial)\n\n8. “The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3”, https://www.rfceditor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc8446.txt.pdf, accessed: 09/2019\n\nAbout\nLatest Posts\n\n## Jason Zhang\n\n\n-----\n\nJason Zhang is a senior threat researcher at Lastline.
