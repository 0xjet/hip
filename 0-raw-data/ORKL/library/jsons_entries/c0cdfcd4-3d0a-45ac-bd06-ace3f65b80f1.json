Black Basta\nwill slowly leak data for each victim to try and pressure them into paying a ransom.\n\n**Black Basta data leak site**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe Black Basta data leak site currently contains data leak pages for ten companies they\nbreached. However, BleepingComputer knows of other victims not currently listed on the\ndata leak site.\n\nTheir most recent listed victim is Deutsche Windtechnik, who suffered a cyberattack on April\n11th but had not disclosed it was a ransomware attack.\n\nYesterday, the data leak site also began leaking the data for the American Dental\nAssociation, which suffered an attack on April 22nd, but that page has since been removed.\nThe removal of their page indicates that the company is negotiating with the threat actors.\n\n## A deeper dive into Black Basta\n\nBleepingComputer performed a brief analysis of the Black Basta ransomware from online\nsamples.\n\nWhen executed, the Black Basta encryptor needs to be run with administrative privileges, or\nit will not encrypt files. Once launched, the encryptor will delete Volume Shadow Copies\nusing the following command:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\SysNative\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all\n/quiet\n\n```\nIt will then hijack an existing Windows service and uses it to launch the ransomware\nencryptor executable. In our tests, the Windows Service that was hijacked was the 'Fax'\nservice, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hijacked Fax Windows**\n\n**service used to launch Black Basta**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe ransomware will also change the wallpaper to display a message stating, \"Your\nnetwork is encrypted by the Black Basta group. Instructions in the file readme.txt.\"\n\n**Wallpaper added by the Black Basta encryptor**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware will now reboot the computer into Safe Mode with Networking, where the\nhijacked Windows service will start and automatically begin to encrypt the files on the\ndevice.\n\n[Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie, who analyzed Black Basta's encryption process, told](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nBleepingComputer that it utilizes the ChaCha20 algorithm to encrypt files. The ChaCha20\nencryption key is then encrypted with a public RSA-4096 key included in the executable.\n\nWhile encrypting files, the ransomware will append the .basta extension to the encrypted\nfile's name. So, for example, test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed to test.jpg.basta.\n\n**Black Basta encrypted files**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nTo display the custom icon associated with the .basta extension, the ransomware will create\na custom extension in the Windows Registry and associate the icon with a randomly named\nICO file in the %Temp% folder. This custom icon is very similar to one used by the icy.tools\napp.\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.basta]\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.basta\\DefaultIcon]\n\n@=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\TEMP\\\\fkdjsadasd.ico\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIn each folder on the encrypted device, the ransomware will create a readme.txt file that\ncontains information about the attack and a link and unique ID required to log in to their\nnegotiation chat session.\n\n**Black Basta Ransom Note**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe Tor negotiation site is titled 'Chat Black Basta' and only includes a login screen and a\nweb chat that can be used to negotiation with the threat actors.\n\nThe threat actors use this screen to issue a welcome message that contains a ransom\ndemand, a threat that data will be leaked if payment is not made in seven days, and the\npromise of a security report after a ransom is paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Black Basta Tor negotiation site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nUnfortunately, Gillespie says that the encryption algorithm is secure and that there is no way\nto recover files for free.\n\n## A likely rebrand\n\nBased on how quickly Black Basta amassed victims and the style of their negotiations, this\nis very likely a rebrand of an experienced operation.\n\nOne theory discussed between security researcher MalwareHunterTeam and this author is\nthat Black Basta is possibly an upcoming rebrand of the Conti ransomware operation.\n\nConti has been under heavy scrutiny over the past two months after a Ukrainian researcher\nleaked a treasure trove of private conversations and the ransomware's source code.\n\nDue to this, it has been speculated that Conti would rebrand their operation to evade law\nenforcement and start over under a different name.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the Black Basta encryptor is very different from Conti s, [MalwareHunterTeam believes](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/)\nthat there are numerous similarities in their negotiation style and website design.\n\nFurthermore, Black Basta released the data for a brand new victim after a screenshot of the\nnegotiation was leaked.\n\nThis \"punishment\" is the same that Conti introduced to stem the tide of negotiations being\nleaked on Twitter.\n\nWhile these connections are tenuous, the Black Basta gang needs to be closely monitored\nas they have only just begun their operation.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 13th 2022 - A National Emergency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-13th-2022-a-national-emergency/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 29th 2022 - New operations emerge](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-29th-2022-new-operations-emerge/)\n\n[Black Basta](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/black-basta/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Safe Mode](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/safe-mode/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
