Every day more and more\ninformation will be uploaded.\n\nSSN + DOB + other information about people - will be sold in DarkWeb to people who will\nuse them for their probably “dark deals”.\n\nAfter revealing people’s personal data, they will be informed who is guilty in publications.\n\nThere is also other interesting information. Your financial reports are very interesting and\n“dirty” - these secrets will be revealed a little later to certain people.\"\n\nThese new extortion attempts further illustrate how victims need to treat ransomware\nattacks very seriously.\n\nIt is no longer only about getting your data back, but also the risk of very private and\npersonal data being exposed and sold to other attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis not only puts the company s who were attacked at risk but also their employees whose\ndata is disclosed.\n\nWhile companies should not pay a ransom if it could be avoided, even if data is published,\nthey should disclose these attacks as data breaches so employees can protect themselves.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted the company for a public statement but has not heard\nback as of yet.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Karakurt revealed as data extortion arm of Conti cybercrime syndicate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/karakurt-revealed-as-data-extortion-arm-of-conti-cybercrime-syndicate/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
