researcher\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-source-code-leaked-by-ukrainian-researcher/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-source-code-leaked-by-ukrainian-researcher/)**\n\nLawrence Abrams\n\nBy\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nMarch 1, 2022\n05:24 PM\n0\n\nA Ukrainian researcher continues to deal devastating blows to the Conti ransomware\noperation, leaking further internal conversations, as well as the source for their ransomware,\nadministrative panels, and more.\n\n[It has been quite a damaging week for Conti after they sided with Russia on the invasion of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomwares-internal-chats-leaked-after-siding-with-russia/)\nUkraine and upset Ukrainian adverts (affiliates) and a researcher who has been secretly\nsnooping on their operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conti siding with Russia on the invasion of Ukraine**\n[On Sunday, a Ukrainian researcher using the Twitter handle @ContiLeaks leaked 393 JSON](https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks)\n[files containing over 60,000 internal messages taken from the Conti and Ryuk ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomwares-internal-chats-leaked-after-siding-with-russia/)\ngang's private XMPP chat server.\n\nThese conversations were from January 21st, 2021, through February 27th, 2022, providing\na treasure trove of information on the cybercrime organization, such as bitcoin addresses,\nhow the gang is organized as a business, evading law enforcement, how they conduct their\nattacks, and much more.\n\nOn Monday, the researcher kept leaking more damaging Conti data, including an additional\n148 JSON files containing 107,000 internal messages since June 2020, which is around\nwhen the [Conti ransomware operation was first launched.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-successor-conti-ransomware-releases-data-leak-site/)\n\n**Further leaked internal conversations**\nContiLeaks began releasing more data throughout the night, including the source code for\nthe gang's administrative panel, the BazarBackdoor API, screenshots of storage servers, and\nmore.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, a part of the leak that got people excited was a password-protected archive\ncontaining the source code for the Conti ransomware encryptor, decryptor, and builder.\n\nWhile the leaker did not share the password publicly, another researcher soon cracked it,\nallowing everyone access to the source code for the Conti ransomware malware files.\n\n**Conti source code for encrypting a file**\nIf you are a reverse engineer, the source code may not provide additional information.\nHowever, the source code provides enormous insight into how the malware works for those\nwho can program in C, but not necessarily reverse engineer.\n\nWhile this is good for security research, the public availability of this code does have its\ndrawbacks.\n\n[As we saw when the HiddenTear (for \"educational reasons\") and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hiddentear/) Babuk ransomware source\n[code was released, threat actors quickly coopt the code to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leaked-babuk-locker-ransomware-builder-used-in-new-attacks/) [launch their own operations.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rook-ransomware-is-yet-another-spawn-of-the-leaked-babuk-code/)\n\nWith code as tight and clean as the Conti ransomware operation, we should expect other\nthreat actors to attempt to launch their own criminal operations using the leaked source\ncode.\n\nWhat may be more helpful, though, is the BazarBackdoor APIs and TrickBot command and\ncontrol server source code that was released, as there is no way to access that info without\nhaving access to the threat actor's infrastructure.\n\nAs for Conti, we will have to wait and see if this \"data breach\" has much of an impact on their\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis has been a significant reputational blow for the group that may cause affiliates to move\nto another ransomware operation.\n\nBut, just like all businesses, and there is no denying Conti is run like a business, data\nbreaches happen all the time.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down
