The share of hacking as an attack method on organizations continues to\n\nincrease, from 30 percent in Q3 to 36 percent in Q4. In incidents affecting\n\nindividuals, on the contrary, experts recorded a surge in the use of social engi\nneering: 67 percent in Q3 versus 85 percent in Q4.\n\n� Throughout the year, we saw steady growth in ransomware attacks, and Q4\n\nwas no exception. Ransomware accounted for 56 percent of all malware at\ntacks (compared to 51% in Q3). Among victims in our dataset, Ryuk ransom\nware was the primary culprit.\n\n� For two years, industrial companies have been one of the three most tempting\n\ntargets for attackers. Such attacks tend to be the handiwork of ransomware\n\noperators and APT groups. The RTM group has been particularly active: the\n\n[PT Expert Security Center recorded 61 phishing attacks, with industrial compa-](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/)\n\nnies among the targets.\n\n� Clients of software vendor SolarWinds were affected by a high-profile supply\n\nchain attack. The incident affected over 40 organizations that had installed a\n\ncompromised update of the SolarWinds Orion infrastructure monitoring plat\nform. The hackers managed to steal penetration testing tools from security\n\nfirm FireEye. These tools will likely resurface in future attacks for years to come.\n\n� There was a spike in attacks on retailers and commerce. The number of attacks\n\nincreased by 56 percent compared to Q3. Such a sharp increase is the work of\n\nransomware operators and web skimmers placed by attackers on hacked store\n\nwebsites.\n\n� In the late 2019, we shared our forecasts about how the threat landscape would\n\nchange in 2020. We expected high-profile cyberattacks in the lead-up to the\n\nU.S. presidential elections. Our forecasts came true. Attackers hacked elec\ntion support systems, stole money from parties' accounts, and sent numerous\n\nphishing emails on election-related topics. During the most recent election cy\ncle, the Wisconsin Democratic Party caught over 800 phishing attempts.\n\n� 40 percent of phishing campaigns leveraged interest in COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe popularity of COVID-19 as a topic for social engineering remains un\nchanged from Q3 (4.6%). Despite the huge amount of news and other content\n\non COVID-19, attackers still manage to strike the right note as they trick victims\n\ninto entering credentials on fake websites, opening malicious attachments, or\n\nrevealing their payment card data to send money to \"people in need\" or \"pay\n\nfor the vaccine.\"\n\n[To protect from cyberattacks, we recommend following our recommendations for](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-companies-can-do-to-stay-safe/)\n\npersonal and corporate cybersecurity. In light of recent attacks aimed at exploiting\n\nvulnerabilities in IT infrastructure, we urge companies to install patches without\n\ndelay. To make it easier to identify and eliminate security flaws, companies should\n\nadopt an automated vulnerability management process. Companies should also\n\ndeploy modern security tools, including web application firewall, network traffic\n\nanalysis, and SIEM. To prevent attacks related to delivery of malware by email, we\n\nrecommend checking attachments in a sandbox, a special virtual environment de\nsigned for analyzing file behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Statistics\n\nHacking as an attack method against organizations was already increasing in Q3\n\nand continued climbing in Q4. From October to December 2020, the increase was\n\n6 percentage points. Eight out of ten attacks were targeted. There was a surge in\n\nsocial engineering in attacks on individuals, from 67 percent to 85 percent.\n\nThe most common motive behind cyberattacks in Q4 2020 was data theft. Personal\n\ndata and trade secrets are still of great demand in attacks on organizations. In at\ntacks against individuals, hackers most often target credentials and personal data.\n\nCompared to the previous quarter, the number of incidents rose by 3.1 percent;\n\ncompared to the same quarter last year, it was 41.2 percent larger.\n\n260\n\n\n###### 3.1% more cyber- attacks than  in Q3 2020\n\n\n240\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n\n223\n\n213\n\n206\n\n202\n\n194 192\n\n178\n\n167\n\n160 159\n\n152\n\n143\n141 136 132 132 135 141\n\n113 112 111\n\n104\n\n91\n\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12\n\n2019 2020 © Positive Technologies\n\n_Figure 1.

In Q4 2020,\n\nwe saw a slowdown in the explosive growth in ransomware attacks from Q3. The\n\nshare of ransomware attacks increased by 5 percentage points versus the previous\n\nquarter, to 56 percent. During the year we also saw the active use of spyware in\n\nattacks against individuals.\n\n56%\nRansomware\n8%\n\n21%\nBanking trojans\n\n24%\n\n\n17%\nRATs\n\n13%\nLoaders\n\n8%\nSpyware\n\n6%\nMiners\n3%\n\n\n24%\n\n24%\n\n\n45%\n\n\nAdware\n\n1%\nOther\n\n\n5%\n\n\n18%\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nOrganizations Individuals\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n_Figure 7.

Methods used for malware distribution_\n\n\nOfficial app stores\n\nChat and SMS messages\n\nOther\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\n-----\n\nIn attacks on organizations, the most frequent method used to spread malware (in\n\n30% of cases) was exploitation of vulnerabilities in IT infrastructure and protection\n\nflaws. For example, during Q4 hackers actively exploited an Oracle WebLogic serv\ner vulnerability (CVE-2020-14882) that allowed remote code execution, though\n\n[a patch was released in early October. One hacker attack was aimed at deploy-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-bug-actively-used-to-deploy-cobalt-strike-on-oracle-servers/)\n\ning Cobalt Strike Beacons, which allow persistent remote access to compromised\n\nhosts. This access later allowed attackers to collect data and deploy second-stage\n\n[malware. Another wave of attacks involved the distribution of DarkIRC malware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-oracle-weblogic-flaw-actively-exploited-by-darkirc-malware/)\n\nDarkIRC comes with a multitude of capabilities, including remote access, keylog\nging, DDoS attacks, and bitcoin clipping, and can be spread on networks by brute\nforcing credentials to Microsoft SQL Server and RDP, as well as over SMB or via\n\nUSB devices. An interesting thing about DarkIRC is that before unpacking, it first\n\nchecks if the host is running in a VMware, VirtualBox, VBox, QEMU, or Xen virtual\n\nmachine and then stops the infection process if it detects a sandbox environment.\n\n_Figure 9. DarkIRC for sale on the darkweb_\n\nSocial engineering remains an ever-present hazard. In 65 percent of attacks on\n\norganizations, the first stage relied on the human factor. Many such attacks in\n[volved the Emotet trojan. After a lull, the trojan re-emerged in full force in mid-](https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2020/july-2020s-most-wanted-malware-emotet-strikes-again-after-five-month-absence/)\n\n[2020. In Lithuania, for example, hackers used the trojan in attacks against several](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-hits-lithuanias-national-public-health-center/)\n\nmunicipalities and the National Center for Public Health (NVSC). In other attacks\n\n[targeting a broader audience, hackers sent phishing emails that pretended to be](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/watch-out-for-emotet-malwares-new-windows-update-attachment/)\n\nmessages from Windows Update, shipping information, resumes, COVID-19 infor\n[mation, and even invitations to a Halloween party. As usual, the emails contained](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-wants-to-invite-you-to-a-halloween-party/)\n\nmalicious Microsoft Word (.doc) attachments that, once opened, try to trick the\n\nuser into enabling macros. The main distinguishing feature of this campaign is that\n\nonce macros are enabled, the user gets a fake error message about Word having\n\nexperienced an error trying to open the file. This put users off their guard, and the\n\nmalware can start executing its payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nJust as interesting and as dangerous, the BazarLoader trojan made a splash in Q4.\n\nThe trojan is used to obtain remote access to a victim's computer and deploy Ryuk\n\n[ransomware. In early October, researchers at cybersecurity firm ProofPoint spotted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-emails-lure-victims-with-inside-info-on-trumps-health/)\n\n[a new phishing campaign that capitalized on interest in the health of Donald Trump.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-emails-lure-victims-with-inside-info-on-trumps-health/)\n\nThe malicious emails asked victims to download a Google document by clicking an\n\nembedded link. Clicking the link downloaded the BazarLoader executable to the\n\n[victim's computer. Mid-October saw a new wave of phishing emails that distributed](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-now-abuse-basecamp-for-free-malware-hosting/)\n\n[BazarLoader using public links to the Basecamp web-based project management](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-now-abuse-basecamp-for-free-malware-hosting/)\n\nplatform. Basecamp allows users to upload all types of files to a project, including\n\nexecutables, which is convenient for attackers. Cybersecurity firm Cyjax reported\n\n[that in addition to malware distribution, hackers can also use Basecamp in phishing](https://www.cyjax.com/2020/10/16/office-365-credential-harvesting-campaign-leveraging-basecamp/)\n\n[attacks to steal login credentials.](https://www.cyjax.com/2020/10/16/office-365-credential-harvesting-campaign-leveraging-basecamp/)\n\n### New ransomware boom\n\nMedical and government institutions, as well as industrial companies, bore the\n\nbrunt of ransomware attacks.\n\n28% 1% 20%\n\n\nIT\n\nRetail\n\nOther\n\nMultiple industries\n\n\n6% 7% 8% 11% 19%\n\n\nHealthcare\n\nGovernment\n\nManufacturing and industry\n\nScience and education\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n_Figure 10.

More than 10 GB of data was published as a result\n\nof the attack.\n\nIn one Ryuk ransomware incident investigated by DFIR experts, the attackers man\naged to compromise an entire corporate network with the ransomware in just two\n\nhours. The attackers exploited vulnerability CVE-2020-1472 for the initial attack\n\n[vector.

They could, for example, increase the water pressure in the reservoir\n\n(causing it to burst) or increase the temperature to critical levels. Lack of authenti\ncation and direct connection of ICS devices to the Internet made the hack possible.\n\nAfter attackers published a video of the breach, authentication was turned on but\n\nthe system remained Internet-accessible, meaning that hackers could strike again.\n\n### Supply chain attacks\n\n[Software vendors were another \"trendy target\" in Q4.

In a supply chain attack, attackers penetrated the SolarWinds\n\nnetwork and added a malicious backdoor into updates for the company's Orion\n\nplatform. Around 18,000 clients installed the tainted update on their systems. Of\n\nnote, the attackers managed to steal penetration testing tools from cybersecurity\n\nfirm FireEye.

During this\n\ntime, they exfiltrated credit card data with the help of POS malware. The company\n\nlearned of the data breach only after the ransomware attack. As a result, E-Land\n\nwas forced to shut down 23 stores. Attackers failed to capture CVCs and CVVs, but\n\nthe amount of stolen data is enough to create fake cards.\n\n\n-----\n\nMagecart attacks accounted for 23 percent of incidents. The most interesting\n\nthing about these attacks is how they are made stealthy. For example, researchers\n\n[at cybersecurity company Sansec discovered web skimmers inside CSS code on](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credit-card-stealer-hides-in-css-files-of-hacked-online-stores/)\n\nthe sites of three different online stores. This tactic is useful for evading detection,\n\nsince CSS code is not commonly checked by security scanners and will most likely\n\nescape attention during manual audits. The skimmer script launched only when\n\ncustomers of compromised sites started to enter payment or personal information.\n\n[Sansec discovered another sophisticated stealth method, involving hiding a mali-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credit-card-stealing-malware-hides-in-social-media-sharing-icons/)\n\n[cious payload in social media SVG sharing icons. The code of the skimmer script](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credit-card-stealing-malware-hides-in-social-media-sharing-icons/)\n\nis loaded as an HTML element. A separate decoder can be deliberately deployed\n\nsomewhere else because if only one of the malware components is found, an infos\nec expert may conclude that the malware is inactive.\n\n[Malefactors did not pass up Black Friday: a self-healing skimmer was discovered](https://sansec.io/research/magento-2-persistent-parasite)\n\non over 50 online stores. On the compromised sites, the skimmer script showed\n\na fake payment form and then sent all of the intercepted data to the real check\nout page. The transaction process was virtually indistinguishable from the real\n\nthing, so security systems did not raise any flags. For robust persistence, attackers\n\nplaced four payload components on the hacked websites:\n\n1) Backdoor loader, to install the skimmer\n\n2) Backdoor watchdog, to restore the backdoor in the event of detection and\n\ndeletion\n\n3) Web skimmer\n\n4) Infostealer, to steal administrator credentials\n\nTherefore, even if the entire infection and healing chain were to be discovered, the\n\ninfostealer would still provide continuous access to servers, allowing the attack\ners to deploy all the payload components a second time. The infection became\n\npossible in the first place only because all the compromised stores were running\n\nMagento versions 2.2.3–2.2.7, despite being urged to upgrade to a more recent\n\nversion.\n\nEven when criminals do not manage to hack online stores, customers may still not\n\nreceive products due to attacks on other links in the supply chain, such as deliv\n[ery. One such incident struck Russian delivery service PickPoint on December 4.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-opens-2732-pickpoint-package-lockers-across-moscow/)\n\n[Attackers hacked the company's network of package lockers, remotely opening](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-opens-2732-pickpoint-package-lockers-across-moscow/)\n\n2,732 lockers in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

They expected many cyberattacks in the run-up to the\n\nU.S. presidential elections, including against the sites of political parties and candi\ndates. This is, indeed, what happened.\n\n[In late October, hackers stole $2.3 million from the account of the Wisconsin](https://www.securityweek.com/wisconsin-republican-party-says-hackers-stole-23-million)\n\nRepublican Party. Criminals manipulated invoices from four of the party's direct\n\nmail and merchandise vendors.

The emails claimed to be looking for volunteers, with an at\ntachment promising further information. But in reality, opening the attachment\n\ntriggered a message that the file was created on an iOS device and prompted us\ners to \"enable content\" in order to view the file.

Despite the abundance of materials available online\n\nabout COVID-19, attackers still manage to lure victims into opening phishing emails\n\nwith the promise of valuable information. In one such attack, a phishing email dis\n[guised as an automatic message from SharePoint linked to a document supposed-](https://www.armorblox.com/blog/covid-email-scams-are-not-going-away/)\n\nly informing of pandemic-related requirements.

All users had to do to receive this\n\nbounty was to reply with their private email address and provide additional infor\nmation if requested. The goal was to collect as much user information as possible.\n\nThe attack was masked to evade detection: the message did not contain any links,\n\nthe \"reply-to\" address differed from the sender address, and the message was\n\nmade to look like part of an email thread.\n\n[In December, fraudsters impersonated the New York Department of Labor to of-](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/covid-19-department-of-labor-phishing/)\n\nfer $600 in pandemic relief.
