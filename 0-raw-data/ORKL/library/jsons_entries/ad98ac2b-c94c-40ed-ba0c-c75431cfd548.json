The threat actor is\ninterested in acquiring credentials from US and European government officials and organisations\nlinked to national security matters. In 2017 it was reported that the threat actor targeted the UK\nforeign office, 3 and we have also observed its interest in UK and US universities in 2020 and\n2022. 4 Since the Russo-Ukraine war began in 2022, we have observed Blue Callisto taking an\nincreased interest in Ukraine, targeting at least one private Ukrainian company related to logistics.\nWe assess Blue Callisto is highly likely still primarily focused on governmental organisations based\nin Europe and the US.\n\n\nIn this blog post we detail 2022 phishing activity the PwC threat intelligence team attributes to Blue\nCallisto and list indicators for defenders to query. The activity ranges from February 2022 to\nOctober 2022. Some of the domains resolve to IPs which we assess are likely operated by Blue\nCallisto to service fake webpages and gather credentials as of 24th October 2022.\n\n## Fingerprinting activity\n\nIn February 2022, we observed a domain we attribute likely to Blue Callisto redirecting to a different\ndomain, which we also assess is likely Blue Callisto due to the similarities in technologies, network\nproviders and infrastructure setup.5 When visiting the domain cache-dns-forwarding[.]com a user is\nredirected to accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com due to a remote script shown in Figure 1. The remote\nscript was located on hypertextteches[.]com.\n\nFigure 1 – Javascript code link observed on cache-dns-forwarding[.]com\n\n\nThe web response from the remote script was obfuscated JavaScript code created by a popular\nJavaScript obfuscator,6 which uses a combination of the following characters: ![ ]() as shown in\n**Figure 2.**\n\nFigure 2 – Obfuscated JavaScript code\n\nThe deobfuscated code contains multiple client side checks, shown in Figure 3, to determine\nwhether the request should be redirected or not. We assess it is likely the threat actor is using this\ncode to identify automated scanners and antivirus technologies, and block them from the final\nphishing URL. The code queries several browser constants, such as:\n\nwindow.webdriver;\nwindow.domAutomation; and,\nwindow.spawn.\n\nIf the code does not identify any problems with the request the script will redirect to the following\nURL:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps[:]//hypertextteches[.]com/patrified.php\n\nFigure 3 – Deobfuscated code\n\nMicrosoft referenced Blue Callisto fingerprinting browser behaviour in one of its public blogs .7 We\nassess the fingerprinting Javascript methods and code is likely similar to the deobfuscated code we\nhave observed. The JavaScript code redirect has several further redirections before reaching its\nfinal URL: a Google themed phishing page shown in Figure 4. An example redirection chain is\nlisted below:\n\n\nhxxps[:]//hypertextteches[.]com/patrified.php;\nhxxps[:]//accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com/oOzMeNTe?\nFtC=DLOJmne17BQw5JRQ74YDgmHxR52d0Ng\nhxxps[:]//accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com/signin/v2/identifier?\npassive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com%2F&followup=https%3A\n%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com%2F&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin\nhxxps[:]//accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com/ServiceLogin?\n\ncontinue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com%2F&flowEntry=ServiceLogin&flowName=\nGlifWebSignIn&followup=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com%2F&passive=1209600\n\nFigure 4 – Google themed phishing page\n\nThe phishing page contains an email address that we assess is likely used by Blue Callisto for\ntesting. The page statically sets the email address value to tr333lopex as shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5 – Statically set email observed in code\n\n## US National Labs interest\n\nBlue Callisto often inputs emails of interest statically into form input fields. In one of these instances,\nwe observed phishing activity spoofing US National Laboratories in July 2022. Specifically, on 12th\nJune 2022 we observed the domain registration goo-ink[.]online, which resolved to\n89.147.108[.]182 from 25th July 2022 (which we assess is phishing infrastructure used by Blue\nCallisto). The goo-ink[.]online domain contained a Brookhaven National Laboratory phishing page,\nstatically setting a Brookhaven Lab email in the input form field as shown in Figure 6. The email\naddress of interest observed on the phishing page is linked to non-proliferation and accountability\ninitiatives for nuclear materials in Russia and elsewhere. During this phishing activity we also\nobserved interest by Blue Callisto in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory based on URLs we\nobserved on goo-ink[.]online.\n\nFigure 6 – Brookhaven National Laboratory phishing page\n\nIn August 2022, Microsoft reported on Blue Callisto infrastructure that they had taken action\nagainst, 8 including the domain goo-link[.]online. This domain was registered on 21st April 2022 and\nstarted to resolve to the IP address 93.95.227[.]41 on 22nd April 2022, and which was used for\nphishing activity. A list of attributes with some comparison of server features and headers is shown\nin Table 1. We assess both domains are likely Blue Callisto activity.\n\ngoo-link[.]online goo-ink[.]online\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrar Hostinger Hostinger\n\nServer Technology Apache 2.4.37 Apache 2.4.37\n\nServer Technology OpenSSL 1.1.1k OpenSSL 1.1.1k\n\nIP resolution 93.95.227[.]41 89.147.108[.]182\n\nIPs ASN 1984-Ehf (AS44925) 1984-Ehf (AS44925)\n\nObservations Phishing Phishing\n\nTable 1 - Domain attributes and links\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite limited observations of broad activity, Blue Callisto is highly likely to remain active. In\nOctober 2022, we observed the threat actor is interested in an organisation which investigates war\ncrimes; motives that would broadly align with a Russia-based threat group’s collection objectives.\nThe threat actor’s tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) contained slight shifts during 2022,\nsuch as network provider preferences and use of phishing technologies such as Evilginx. However,\nthe threat actor continues to use some TTPs observed as far back as 2019 and continues to enjoy\nsuccess from its phishing activity using legacy tradecraft.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicator** **Type**\n\ncache-dns-forwarding[.]com Domain\n\naccounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com Domain\n\nhypertextteches[.]com Domain\n\ngoo-link[.]online Domain\n\ngoo-ink[.]online Domain\n\nhxxps[:]//hypertextteches[.]com/patrified.php URL\n\n\nhxxps[:]//accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com/oOzMeNTe?\nFtC=DLOJmne17BQw5JRQ74YDgmHxR52d0Ng\n\n\nURL\n\n\nhxxps[:]//accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com/signin/v2/identifier?\npassive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com\n\n%2F&followup=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com%2F&flowNa\n\nme=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin\n\n\nURL\n\n\nhxxps[:]//accounts[.]hypertexttech[.]com/ServiceLogin?\ncontinue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts[.]google[.]com%2F&flowEntry=Ser\n\nviceLogin&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&followup=https%3A%2F%2Facco\n\nunts[.]google[.]com%2F&passive=1209600 URL\n\n\nURL\n\n\n-----\n\n93.95.227[.]41 IPv4\nAddress\n\n89.147.108[.]182 IPv4\nAddress\n\n92.38.169[.]241 IPv4\nAddress\n\n138.124.187[.]128 IPv4\nAddress\n\n185.164.172[.]128 IPv4\nAddress\n\n37.9.35[.]62 IPv4\nAddress\n\n92.38.176[.]66 IPv4\nAddress\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing Link - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/Command and\n\nScripting Interpreter: JavaScript - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007/\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode Files or Information - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/\n\nSystem Information Discovery - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[[1] 'Disrupting SEABORGIUM’s ongoing phishing operations', Microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/ (15th August 2022)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\n\n[[2] Callisto Group, F-Secure, https://www.f-secure.com/content/dam/f-secure/en/labs/whitepapers/Callisto_Group.pdf (n.d)](https://www.f-secure.com/content/dam/f-secure/en/labs/whitepapers/Callisto_Group.pdf)\n\n[3] 'Callisto Group hackers targeted Foreign Office data', BBC News,2017) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39588703 (13th April](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39588703)\n\n[4] CTO-TIB-20200820-01A - Callisto targets UK Government and Universities\n\n[5] CTO-TIB-20220511-01A - Tracking Callisto infrastructure\n\n[6] JSFuck, JSFuck, http://www.jsfuck.com/\n\n[[8] 'Disrupting SEABORGIUM’s ongoing phishing operations', Microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/ (15th August 2022)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\n\n[[9] 'Disrupting SEABORGIUM’s ongoing phishing operations', Microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/ (15th August 2022)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\n\n## We welcome your comments\n\nYour request / feedback has been routed to the appropriate person.
