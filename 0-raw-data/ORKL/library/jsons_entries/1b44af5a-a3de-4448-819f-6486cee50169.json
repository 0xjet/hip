The summaries\nare based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what\nwe have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports. They are\ndesigned to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware\nof.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q1 2021.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\n[information on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December, SolarWinds, a well-known IT managed services provider, fell victim to a\nsophisticated supply-chain attack. The company’s Orion IT, a solution for monitoring and\nmanaging customers’ IT infrastructure, was compromised. This resulted in the deployment of\na custom backdoor, named Sunburst, on the networks of more than 18,000 SolarWinds\ncustomers, including many large corporations and government bodies, in North America,\n[Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In our initial report on Sunburst, we examined the method](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\nused by the malware to communicate with its C2 (command-and-control) server and the\nprotocol used to upgrade victims for further exploitation. Further investigation of the Sunburst\nbackdoor revealed several features that overlap with a previously identified backdoor known\nas Kazuar, a .NET backdoor first reported in 2017 and tentatively linked to the Turla APT\ngroup. The shared features between Sunburst and Kazuar include the victim UID generation\nalgorithm, code similarities in the initial sleep algorithm and the extensive usage of the\nFNV1a hash to obfuscate string comparisons. There are several possibilities: Sunburst may\nhave been developed by the same group as Kazuar; the developers of Sunburst may have\nadopted some ideas or code from Kazuar; both groups obtained their malware from the\nsame source; some Kazuar developers moved to another team, taking knowledge and tools\nwith them; or the developers of Sunburst introduced these links as a form of false flag.\nHopefully, further analysis will make things clearer.\n\nOn March 2, Microsoft reported a new APT actor named HAFNIUM, exploiting four zero-days\nin Exchange Server in what they called “limited and targeted attacks”. At the time, Microsoft\nclaimed that, in addition to HAFNIUM, several other actors were exploiting them as well. In\nparallel, Volexity also reported the same Exchange zero-days being in use in early 2021.\nAccording to Volexity’s telemetry, some of the exploits in use are shared across several\nactors, besides the one Microsoft designates as HAFNIUM. Kaspersky telemetry revealed a\nspike in exploitation attempts for these vulnerabilities following the public disclosure and\npatch from Microsoft. During the first week of March, we identified approximately 1,400\nunique servers that had been targeted, in which one or more of these vulnerabilities were\nused to obtain initial access. Prior to the posts, on February 28, we identified related\nexploitation on less than a dozen Exchange systems; we also found more than a dozen\nExchange artefacts indicating exploitation uploaded to multi-scanner services. According to\nour telemetry, most exploitation attempts were observed for servers in Europe and the United\nStates. Some of the servers were targeted multiple times by what appear to be different\nthreat actors (based on the command execution patterns), suggesting the exploits are now\navailable to multiple groups.\n\nWe have also discovered a campaign active since mid-March targeting governmental entities\nin the Russian Federation, using the aforementioned Exchange zero-day exploits. This\ncampaign made use of a previously unknown malware family we dubbed FourteenHi. Further\ninvestigation revealed traces of activity involving variants of this malware dating back a year.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found some overlaps in these sets of activities with HAFNIUM in terms of\ninfrastructure and TTPs as well as the use of ShadowPad malware during the same\ntimeframe.\n\n## Europe\n\nDuring routine monitoring of detections for FinFisher spyware tools, we discovered traces\nthat point to recent FinFly Web deployments. In particular, we discovered two servers with\nweb applications that we suspect, with high confidence, were generated using FinFly Web.\nFinFly Web is, in essence, a suite of tools and packages that implement a web-based\nexploitation server. It was first publicly documented in 2014, in the aftermath of the Gamma\nGroup hacking incident. One of the suspected FinFly Web servers was active for more than a\nyear between October 2019 and December 2020. This server was disabled a day after our\ndiscovery last December. Nevertheless, we were able to capture a copy of its landing page,\nwhich included JavaScript used to profile victims using what appears to be previously\nunknown code. In the second case, the server hosting FinFly Web was already offline at the\nmoment of discovery, so we drew our conclusions using available historical data. As it turned\nout, it was active for a very short time around September 2020 on a host that appears to\nhave been impersonating the popular Mail.ru service. Surprisingly, this server began\nanswering queries again on January 12. So far, we haven’t seen any related payloads being\ndropped by these web pages.\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nKazuar is a .NET backdoor usually associated with the Turla threat actor (aka Snake and\nUroboros). Recently, Kazuar received renewed interest due to its similarities with the\nSunburst backdoor. Although the capabilities of Kazuar have already been exposed in public\nresearch, many interesting facts about this backdoor were not made public. Our latest\nreports focus on the changes the threat actor made to the September and November\nversions of its backdoor.\n\nOn February 24, the National Security Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC) publicly warned\nthat a threat actor had exploited a national documents circulation system (SEI EB) to\ndistribute malicious documents to Ukrainian public authorities. The alert contained a few\nrelated network IoCs, and specified that the documents used malicious macros in order to\ndrop an implant onto targeted systems. Thanks to the shared IoCs, we were able to attribute\nthis attack, with high confidence, to the Gamaredon threat actor. The malicious server IP\nmentioned by the NSDC has been known to Kaspersky since February as Gamaredon\ninfrastructure.\n\nOn January 27, the French national cybersecurity agency (ANSSI) published a report\ndescribing an attack campaign that targeted publicly exposed and obsolete Centreon\nsystems between 2017 and 2020, in order to deploy Fobushell (aka P.A.S.) webshells and\n\n\n-----\n\nExaramel implants. ANSSI associated the campaign with the Sandworm intrusion-set, which\nwe refer to as Hades. Although we specifically looked for additional compromised Centreon\nsystems, Exaramel implant samples or associated infrastructure, we were unable to retrieve\nany useful artifacts from which we could initiate a comprehensive investigation. However, we\ndid identify three Centreon servers where a Fobushell webshell had been deployed. One of\nthose Fobushell samples was identical to another we previously identified on a Zebrocy C2\nserver.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nWe discovered a set of malicious activities, which we named EdwardsPheasant, targeting\nmainly government organizations in Vietnam since June 2020. The attackers leverage\npreviously unknown and obfuscated backdoors and loaders. The activities peaked in\nNovember 2020, but are still ongoing. The associated threat actor continues to leverage its\ntools and tactics (described in our private report) to compromise targets or maintain access\nin their networks. While we could identify similarities with the tools and tactics associated\nwith Cycldek (aka Goblin Panda) and Lucky Mouse (aka Emissary Panda), we have been\nunable to attribute this set of activities to either of them conclusively.\n\nWe investigated a long-running espionage campaign, dubbed A41APT, targeting multiple\nindustries, including the Japanese manufacturing industry and its overseas bases, which has\nbeen active since March 2019. The attackers used vulnerabilities in an SSL-VPN product to\ndeploy a multi-layered loader we dubbed Ecipekac (aka DESLoader, SigLoader and\nHEAVYHAND). We attribute this activity to APT10 with high confidence. Most of the\ndiscovered payloads deployed by this loader are fileless and have not been seen before. We\nobserved SodaMaster (aka DelfsCake, dfls and DARKTOWN), P8RAT (aka GreetCake and\nHEAVYPOT), and FYAnti (aka DILLJUICE Stage 2) which in turn loads QuasarRAT. In\nNovember and December 2020, two public blog posts were published about this campaign.\nOne month later, we observed new activities from the actor with an updated version of some\nof their implants designed to evade security products and make analysis harder for\n[researchers. You can read more in our public report.](https://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/)\n\n## Middle East\n\nWe recently came across previously unknown malicious artifacts that we attributed to the\nLyceum/Hexane threat group, showing that the attackers behind it are still active and have\nbeen developing their toolset during the last year. Although Lyceum still prefers taking\nadvantage of DNS tunneling, it appears to have replaced the previously documented .NET\npayload with a new C++ backdoor and a PowerShell script that serve the same purpose. Our\ntelemetry revealed that the threat group’s latest endeavors are focused on going after\nentities within one country – Tunisia. The victims we observed were all high-profile Tunisian\norganizations, such as telecommunications or aviation companies. Based on the targeted\nindustries, we assume that the attackers may have been interested in compromising these\n\n\n-----\n\nentities to track the movements and communications of individuals that are of interest to\nthem. This could mean that the latest Lyceum cluster has an operational focus on targeting\nTunisia, or that it is a subset of broader activity that is yet to be discovered.\n\nOn November 19, 2020, Shadow Chaser Group tweeted about a suspected MuddyWater\nAPT malicious document potentially targeting a university in the United Arab Emirates.\nBased on our analysis since then, we suspect this intrusion is part of a campaign that started\nat least in early October 2020 and was last seen active in late December 2020. The threat\nactor relied on VBS-based malware to infect organizations from government, NGO and\neducation sectors. Our telemetry, however, indicates that no further tools were deployed and\nwe do not believe that data theft took place either. This indicates to us that the attackers are\ncurrently in the reconnaissance phase of their operation, and we expect subsequent waves\nof attacks to follow in the near future. In our private report, we provide an in-depth analysis of\nthe malicious documents used by this threat actor and study their similarities to known\nMuddyWater tooling. The infrastructure setup and communications scheme are also similar\nto past incidents attributed to this group. The actor maintains a small set of first-stage C2\nservers to connect back from the VBS implant for initial communications. Initial\nreconnaissance is performed by the actor and communication with the implant is handed off\nto a second-stage C2 for additional downloads. Finally, we present similarities with known\nTTPs of the MuddyWater group and attribute this campaign to them with medium confidence.\n\nDomestic Kitten is a threat group mainly known for its mobile backdoors. The group’s\noperations were exposed in 2018, showing that it was conducting surveillance attacks\nagainst individuals in the Middle East. The threat group targeted Android users by sending\nthem popular and well-known applications that were backdoored and contained malicious\ncode. Many of the applications had religious or political themes and were intended for Farsi,\nArabic and Kurdish speakers, possibly alluding to this attack’s main targets. We have\ndiscovered new evidence showing that Domestic Kitten has been using PE executables to\ntarget victims using Windows since at least 2013, with some evidence that it goes back to\n2011. The Windows version, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been described in\nthe past, was delivered in several versions, with the more recent one used for at least three\nand a half years to target individuals in parallel to the group’s mobile campaigns. The implant\nfunctionality and infrastructure in that version have remained the same all along, and have\nbeen used in the group’s activity witnessed this year.\n\nFerocious Kitten is an APT group that has been active against Persian-speaking individuals\nsince 2015 and appears to be based in Iran. Although it has been active over a large\ntimespan, the group has mostly operated under the radar and, to the best of our knowledge,\nhas not been covered by security researchers. It only recently attracted attention when a lure\ndocument was uploaded to VirusTotal and was brought to public knowledge by researchers\non Twitter. Subsequently, one of its implants was analyzed by a Chinese intelligence firm. We\nhave been able to expand some of the findings on the group and provide insights on\nadditional variants. The malware dropped from the aforementioned document is dubbed\n\n\n-----\n\nMarkiRAT and is used to record keystrokes and clipboard content, provide file download and\nupload capabilities as well as the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the victim’s\nmachine. We were able to trace the implant back to at least 2015, along with variants\nintended to hijack the execution of the Telegram and Chrome applications as a persistence\nmethod. Interestingly, some of the TTPs used by this threat actor are reminiscent of other\ngroups operating in the domain of dissident surveillance. For example, it used the same C2\ndomains across its implants for years, which was witnessed in the activity of Domestic Kitten.\nIn the same vein, the Telegram execution hijacking technique observed in this campaign by\nFerocious Kitten was also observed being used by Rampant Kitten, as covered by Check\nPoint. In our private report, we expand the details on these findings as well as provide\nanalysis and mechanics of the MarkiRAT malware.\n\nKarkadann is a threat actor that has been targeting government bodies and news outlets in\nthe Middle East since at least October 2020. The threat actor leverages tailor-made\nmalicious documents with embedded macros that trigger an infection chain, opening a URL\nin Internet Explorer. The minimal functionality present in the macros and the browser\nspecification suggest that the threat actor might be exploiting a privilege-escalation\nvulnerability in Internet Explorer. Despite the small amount of evidence available for analysis\nin the Karkadann case, we were able to find several similarities to the Piwiks case, a\nwatering-hole attack we discovered that targeted multiple prominent websites in the Middle\nEast. Our private report presents the recent Karkadann campaigns and the similarities\nbetween this campaign and the Piwiks case. The report concludes with some infrastructure\noverlaps with unattributed clusters that we have seen since last year that are potentially\nlinked to the same threat actor.\n\n## Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nWe discovered that the Kimsuky group adopted a new method to deliver its malware in its\nlatest campaign on a South Korean stock trading application. In this campaign, beginning in\nDecember 2020, the group compromised a website belonging to the vendor of stock trading\nsoftware, replacing the hosted installation package with a malicious one. Kimsuky also\ndelivered its malware by utilizing a malicious Hangul (HWP) document containing COVID-19related bait that discusses a government relief fund. Both infection vectors ultimately deliver\nthe Quasar RAT. Compared to Kimsuky’s last reported infection chain, composed of various\nscripts, the new scheme adds complications and introduces less popular file types, involving\nVBS scripts, XML and Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files with embedded C# code\nin order to fetch and execute stagers and payloads. Based on the lure document and\ncharacteristics of the compromised installation package, we conclude that this attack is\nfinancially motivated, which, as we have previously reported, is one of Kimsuky’s main focus\nareas.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn January 25, the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) announced that a North Koreanrelated threat actor had targeted security researchers. According to Google TAG’s blog, this\nactor used highly sophisticated social engineering, approached security researchers through\nsocial media, and delivered a compromised Visual Studio project file or lured them to their\nblog and installed a Chrome exploit. On March 31, Google TAG released an update on this\nactivity showing another wave of fake social media profiles and a company the actor set up\nmid-March. We can confirm that several infrastructures on the blog overlap with our\npreviously published reporting about Lazarus group’s ThreatNeedle cluster. Moreover, the\nmalware mentioned by Google matched ThreatNeedle – malware that we have been tracking\nsince 2018. While investigating associated information, a fellow external researcher\nconfirmed that he was also compromised by this attack, sharing information for us to\ninvestigate. We discovered additional C2 servers after decrypting configuration data from the\ncompromised host. The servers were still in use during our investigation, and we were able\nto get additional data, analyzing logs and files present on the servers. We assess that the\npublished infrastructure was used not only to target security researchers but also in other\nLazarus attacks. We found a relatively large number of hosts communicating with the C2s at\n[the time of our research. You can read our public report here.](https://securelist.com/lazarus-threatneedle/100803/)\n\nFollowing up our previous investigation into Lazarus attacks on the defense industry using\nThreatNeedle, we discovered another malware cluster named CookieTime used in a\ncampaign mainly focused on the defense industry. We detected activity in September and\nNovember 2020, with samples dating back to April 2020. Compared to the already known\nmalware clusters of the Lazarus group, CookieTime shows a different structure and\nfunctionality. This malware communicates with the C2 server using the HTTP protocol. In\norder to deliver the request type to the C2 server, it uses encoded cookie values and fetches\ncommand files from the C2 server. The C2 communication takes advantage of\nsteganography techniques, delivered in files exchanged between infected clients and the C2\nserver. The contents are disguised as GIF image files, but contain encrypted commands\nfrom the C2 server and command execution results. We had a chance to look into the\ncommand and control script as a result of working closely with a local CERT to take down the\nthreat actor’s infrastructure. The malware control servers are configured in a multi-stage\nfashion and only deliver the command file to valuable hosts.\n\nWhile investigating the artifacts of a supply-chain attack on the Vietnam Government\nCertification Authority’s (VGCA) website, we discovered that the first Trojanized package\ndates to June 2020. Unravelling that thread, we identified a number of post-compromise\ntools in the form of plugins deployed using PhantomNet malware, which was delivered using\nTrojanized packages. Our analysis of these plugins revealed similarities with the previously\nanalyzed CoughingDown malware. In our private report, we offer a detailed description for\neach post-compromise tool used in the attack, as well as other tools belonging to the actor’s\narsenal. Finally, we also explore CoughingDown attribution in the light of recent discoveries.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn February 10, DBAPPSecurity published details about a zero-day exploit they discovered\nlast December. Aside from the details of the exploit itself, researchers also mentioned it\nbeing used in the wild by BitterAPT. While no such subsequent information was given in the\ninitial report to explain the attribution claims, our investigation into this activity confirms the\nexploit was in fact being used exclusively by this actor. We assigned the name TurtlePower\nto the campaign that makes use of this exploit, along with the other tools used to target\ngovernmental and telecom entities in Pakistan and China. We have also confidently linked\nthe origin of this exploit to a broker we refer to as Moses. Moses has been responsible for\nthe development of at least five exploits patched in the last two years. We have also been\nable to tie the usage of some of these exploits to at least two different actors thus far –\nBitterAPT and DarkHotel. At this time, it is unclear how these threat actors are obtaining\nexploits from Moses, whether it is through direct purchase or another third-party provider.\nDuring the TurtlePower campaign, BitterAPT used a wide array of tools on its victims to\ninclude a stage one payload named ArtraDownloader, a stage two payload named Splinter, a\nkeylogger named SourLogger, an infostealer named SourFilling, as well as variations of\nMimikatz to gather specific files and maintain its access. This particular campaign also\nappears to be narrowly focused on targets within Pakistan and China (based on the initial\nreport referenced). While we can verify specific targeting within Pakistan using our own data,\nwe have not been able to do the same regarding China. Use of CVE-2021-1732 peaked\nbetween June and July 2020, but the overall campaign is still ongoing.\n\nIn 2020, we observed new waves of attacks related to Dropping Elephant (aka Patchwork,\nChinastrats), focusing on targets in China and Pakistan. We also noted a few targets outside\nof the group’s traditional area of operations, namely in the Middle East, and a growing\ninterest in the African continent. The attacks followed the group’s well-established TTPs,\nwhich include the use of malicious documents crafted to exploit a remote code execution\nvulnerability in Microsoft Office, and the signature JakyllHyde (aka BadNews) Trojan in the\nlater infection stages. Dropping Elephant introduced a new loader for JakyllHyde, a tool we\nnamed Crypta. It contains mechanisms to hinder detection and appears to be a core\ncomponent of this APT actor’s recent toolset. Crypta and its variants have been observed in\nmultiple scenarios loading a wide range of subsequent payloads, such as Bozok RAT,\nQuasar RAT and LokiBot. An additional Trojan discovered during our research was\nPubFantacy. To our knowledge, this tool has never been publicly described and has been\nused to target Windows servers since at least 2018.\n\nWe recently discovered a previously publicly unknown Android implant used in 2018-2019 by\nthe SideWinder threat group, which we dubbed BroStealer. The main purpose of the\nBroStealer implant is to collect sensitive information from a victim’s device, such as photos,\nSMS messages, call recordings and files from various messaging applications. Although\nSideWinder has numerous campaigns against victims using the Windows platform, recent\nreports have shown that this threat group also goes after its targets via the mobile platform.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\n\n-----\n\nIn February 2019, multiple antivirus companies received a collection of malware samples,\nmost of them associated with various known APT groups. Some of the samples cannot be\nassociated with any known activity. Some, in particular, attracted our attention due to their\nsophistication. The samples were compiled in 2014 and, accordingly, were likely deployed in\n2014 and possibly as late as 2015. Although we have not found any shared code with any\nother known malware, the samples have intersections of coding patterns, style and\n[techniques that have been seen in various Lambert families. We therefore named this](https://securelist.com/unraveling-the-lamberts-toolkit/77990/)\nmalware Purple Lambert. Purple Lambert is composed of several modules, with its network\nmodule passively listening for a magic packet. It is capable of providing an attacker with\nbasic information about the infected system and executing a received payload. Its\nfunctionality reminds us of Gray Lambert, another user-mode passive listener. Gray Lambert\nturned out to be a replacement of the kernel-mode passive-listener White Lambert implant in\nmultiple incidents. In addition, Purple Lambert implements functionality similar to, but in\ndifferent ways, both Gray Lambert and White Lambert. Our report, available to subscribers of\nour APT threat reports, includes discussion of both the passive-listener payload and the\nloader functionality included in the main module.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nWhile the TTPs of some threat actors remain consistent over time, relying heavily on social\nengineering as a means of gaining a foothold in a target organization or compromising an\nindividual’s device, others refresh their toolsets and extend the scope of their activities. Our\nregular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight the key developments of APT groups.\n\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q1 2021:\n\nPerhaps the most predominant attack we researched in this quarter was the\nSolarWinds attack. SolarWinds showed once again how successful a supply-chain\nattack can be, especially where attackers go the extra mile to remain hidden and\nmaintain persistence in a target network. The scope of this attack is still being\ninvestigated as more zero-day flaws are discovered in SolarWinds products.\nAnother critical wave of attacks was the exploitation of Microsoft Exchange zero-day\nvulnerabilities by multiple threat actors. We recently discovered another campaign\nusing these exploits with different targeting, possibly related to the same cluster of\nactivities already reported.\nLazarus group’s bold campaign targeting security researchers worldwide also utilized\nzero-day vulnerabilities in browsers to compromise their targets. Their campaigns used\nthemes centered on the use of zero-days to lure relevant researchers, possibly in an\nattempt to steal vulnerability research.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,\nthere is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1RS5KQcVTlc\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Chinese-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/chinese-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Microsoft](https://securelist.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[MuddyWater](https://securelist.com/tag/muddywater/)\n[Russian-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/russian-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Spyware](https://securelist.com/tag/spyware/)\n[Sunburst](https://securelist.com/tag/sunburst/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Turla](https://securelist.com/tag/turla/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Zero-day vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nAPT trends report Q1 2021\n\nYour email address will not be published Required fields are marked *\n\n\n-----",
