    "plain_text": "# INCONTROLLER: New State-Sponsored Cyber Attack Tools Target Multiple Industrial Control Systems\n\n**mandiant.com/resources/incontroller-state-sponsored-ics-tool**\n\nIn early 2022, Mandiant, in partnership with Schneider Electric, analyzed a set of novel industrial control system (ICS)oriented attack tools—which we call INCONTROLLER (aka PIPEDREAM)—built to target machine automation devices. The\ntools can interact with specific industrial equipment embedded in different types of machinery leveraged across multiple\nindustries. While the targeting of any operational environments using this toolset is unclear, the malware poses a critical risk\nto organizations leveraging the targeted equipment. INCONTROLLER is very likely state sponsored and contains capabilities\nrelated to disruption, sabotage, and potentially physical destruction.\n\nINCONTROLLER represents an exceptionally rare and dangerous cyber attack capability. It is comparable to [TRITON, which](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/triton-actor-ttp-profile-custom-attack-tools-detections)\nattempted to disable an industrial safety system in 2017; INDUSTROYER, which caused a power outage in Ukraine in 2016;\nand STUXNET, which sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program around 2010. To help asset owners find and defend against\nINCONTROLLER, we have included a range of mitigations and discovery methods throughout this report. As future\nmodifications to these tools are likely, we believe behavior-based hunting and detection methods will be most effective.\n\n_If you need support responding to related activity, please contact_ _[Mandiant Consulting. Further analysis of related threats is](https://www.mandiant.com/services/incident-response)_\n_[available as part of Mandiant Advantage Threat Intelligence.](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)_\n\n_This report is related to information shared in CISA_ _[Alert (AA22-103A).For more information from Schneider Electric, please](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-103a)_\n_see_ _[their bulletin. For more information from CODESYS, please see their advisory.](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SESB-2022-01)_\n\nINCONTROLLER is comprised of three main components:\n\nTable 1: Description of tools\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tool** **Description**\n\nTAGRUN A tool that scans for OPC servers, enumerates OPC structure/tags, brute forces credentials, and\nreads/writes OPC tag values.\n\nCODECALL A framework that communicates using Modbus—one of the most common industrial protocols—and\nCodesys. CODECALL contains modules to interact with, scan, and attack at least three Schneider\nElectric programmable logic controllers (PLCs).\n\nOMSHELL A framework with capabilities to interact with and scan some types of Omron PLCs via HTTP, Telnet, and\nOmron FINS protocol. The tool can also interact with Omron's servo drives, which use feedback control to\ndeliver energy to motors for precision motion control.\n\n## INCONTROLLER Was Built to Manipulate and Disrupt Industrial Processes\n\nIndustrial automation networks rely on a variety of equipment that enable operators to translate information and instructions\ninto chains of physical actions. Given the diversity of assets present in industrial networks, industrial automation equipment\ntypically speaks different languages across different portions of the network, which is possible using standardized industrial\ncommunication protocols.\n\nINCONTROLLER includes three tools that enable the attacker to send instructions to ICS devices using industrial network\nprotocols, such as OPC UA; Modbus; Codesys, which is used by EcoStruxure Machine Expert and SoMachine; and Omron\nFINS. While the tool's capabilities could enable the actor to communicate with a variety of products from different original\nequipment manufacturers (OEMs), the actor developed modules for specific controllers from Schneider Electric and Omron.\nThe targeted equipment consists of machine automation solutions whose use cases span from supporting simple, repetitive\nmachines to complex modular machines in distributed architectures:\n\nOPC servers\nSchneider Electric Modicon M251, Modicon M258, and Modicon M221 Nano PLCs\n\nOther devices leveraging Modbus and Codesys may also be affected\nOmron NX1P2 and NJ501 PLCs and R88D-1SN10F-ECT servo drive\n\nOther devices from NJ and NX PLC series may also be affected\n\nWe highly doubt that the threat actor would target these devices at random. It is more likely they were chosen because of\nreconnaissance into specific target environment(s). We note that this would be consistent with previous ICS malware, such as\nTRITON, which targeted a critical safety system that was almost certainly identified prior to compromising the target's\nindustrial environment.\n\n## INCONTROLLER: Tooling Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: INCONTROLLER tooling\n\noverview\n\n### TAGRUN\n\nTAGRUN's capabilities, such as the ability to scan for and enumerate OPC UA servers, suggests a reconnaissance role. OPC\nacts as a central communications protocol to collect and store data from ICS assets in industrial environments. Access to this\ndata can provide attackers with a detailed overview of production systems and control processes. The tool was likely\ndeveloped for reconnaissance, but it can also write and change tag values, which could be used to modify data to either\nsupport an attack or mask process changes. TAGRUN also verifies whether the target environment is running a Windows\noperating system and provides different ping commands depending on this check's return value. This suggests that the actor\nmay use non-Windows devices to execute TAGRUN.\n\nTAGRUN’s capabilities include:\n\nScanning for OPC UA servers on a network\nReading the structure of OPC UA servers\nReading/writing tag values for data on an OPC UA server\nBrute forcing credentials\nOutputting log files\n\n### CODECALL\n\nCODECALL communicates with ICS devices using the Modbus protocol, which potentially gives it the ability to interact with\ndevices from different manufacturers. However, the tool contains a specific module to interact with, scan, and attack\nSchneider Electric's Modicon M251 (TM251MESE) PLC using Codesys, which is used by the company's proprietary\nEcoStruxure Machine Expert protocol. We have reason to believe the tool also targets Schneider Electric's Modicon M221\nNano PLC and the Modicon M258 PLC, and it potentially affects additional devices leveraging these protocols.\n\nCODECALL’s general capabilities include:\n\n\n-----\n\nIdentifying Schneider Electric and Modbus enabled devices on a network\nConnecting to specific devices over Modbus or Codesys\nReading/writing device registers over Modbus\nRequesting device ID from a session over Modbus\nDefining, dumping, or loading command macro file(s)\nExecuting device specific commands over Codesys, such as:\n\nAttempting to login using a username/password and by brute forcing credentials with a provided dictionary file\nDownloading/uploading files to the PLC device\nRetrieving file/directory listings\nDeleting files\nDisconnecting sessions from the PLC device\nAttempting a DDoS attack\nCrashing the device with a specifically crafted packet\nAdding a route if the device gateway IP exists on a different interface\nSending custom raw packets\n\n### OMSHELL\n\nOMSHELL is designed to obtain shell access to Omron PLCs, including Omron NX1P2, NJ501, R88D-1SN10F-ECT servo\ndrive, and possibly other similar devices from the NJ/NX product lines. The tool primarily operates using the HTTP protocol,\nhowever it also utilizes Omron's proprietary FINS over UDP protocol for scanning and device identification. The framework is\nmodular, which means the attacker can develop and deploy additional capabilities into the tool.\n\nOMSHELL’s capabilities include:\n\nScanning for and identifying Omron devices on the network\nWiping the device’s program memory and resetting the device\nLoading backup configuration and backup data from or restoring data to the device\nActivating the telnet daemon on the device\nConnecting to the device via the telnet daemon, uploading and optionally executing an arbitrary payload or command\nConnecting to a backdoor present on a device and providing arbitrary command execution\nPerforming a network traffic capture\nKilling arbitrary processes running on the device\nTransferring files to the device\nConnecting and communicating with attached servo drives\n\nWe have reason to believe that indicator-based detections would not be effective at detecting INCONTROLLER in victim\nenvironments, in part because the attacker would almost certainly modify or customize the tool prior to using it in a specific\nvictim environment. Instead, defenders should focus their efforts on behavior-based hunting and detection methods for these\ntools.\n\n### Potential Supporting Windows Tooling\n\nWe are also tracking two additional tools affecting Windows-based systems that may be related to this threat activity. It is\npossible that these tools could be used to support the overall attack lifecycle in an INCONTROLLER attack by exploiting\nWindows-based systems in IT or operational technology (OT) environments.\n\nOne of the tools exploits [CVE-2020-15368 in the AsrDrv103.sys driver, which would result in installation and exploitation](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15368)\nof a vulnerable driver. ASRock motherboards may be leveraged in some human-machine interfaces (HMIs) and\nengineering workstations in OT environments.\nThe other tool, which we track as ICECORE, is a backdoor providing reconnaissance and command and control\nfunctionality.\n\n## Attack Scenarios\n\nIt is feasible that each tool could be used independently, or the actor may use the three tools to attack a single environment.\nWe highlight that the devices targeted by INCONTROLLER are often integrated in automation machinery (e.g., a milling\nmachine or press) and could plausibly be present in a variety of industrial sectors and processes even without the user's\nexplicit knowledge\n\n\n-----\n\nWe developed three cyber physical attack scenarios that highlight a range of possible outcomes from an attack using\nINCONTROLLER. In each of the three cases, TAGRUN could have been used at earlier stages to enumerate the victim\nenvironment, identify its targets, and learn about the physical process.\n\nFigure 2: INCONTROLLER attack\n\nscenarios\nThe impact of these scenarios would depend on the nature of the victim facility and the extent of the attacker's understanding\nof and interaction with the controlled physical process. We note that our current understanding of INCONTROLLER is still\nlimited given that it leverages an extensible structure that can support new features implemented by the author.\n\n## INCONTROLLER Is Very Likely State-Sponsored Malware\n\nWe believe INCONTROLLER is very likely linked to a state-sponsored group given the complexity of the malware, the\nexpertise and resources that would be required to build it, and its limited utility in financially motivated operations. We are\nunable to associate INCONTROLLER with any previously tracked group at this stage of our analysis, but we note the activity\nis consistent with Russia's historical interest in ICS. While our evidence connecting INCONTROLLER to Russia is largely\ncircumstantial, we note it given Russia's history of destructive cyber attacks, its current invasion of Ukraine, and related\nthreats against Europe and North America.\n\nSince at least 2014, Russia-nexus threat actors have targeted ICS assets and data with multiple ICS-tailored malware\nfamilies (PEACEPIPE, BlackEnergy2, INDUSTROYER, TRITON, and VPNFILTER).\n\nFigure 3: Historical Russia-nexus\n\nactivity impacting ICS\n\nINCONTROLLER's functionality is consistent with the malware used in Russia's prior cyber physical attacks. For\nexample, the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian blackouts both involved physical process manipulations combined with\ndisruptive attacks against embedded devices. INCONTROLLER similarly allows the malware operator to manipulate\nphysical processes, while also containing denial-of-service (DoS) capabilities to disrupt the availability of PLCs.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recommendations\n\nWhile the nature of any potential intended victims remains uncertain, INCONTROLLER poses a critical risk to organizations\nwith compatible devices. The targeted devices are embedded in multiple types of machinery and could plausibly be present in\nmany different industrial sectors. Given the consistencies with prior Russia-nexus threat activity, we suggest that\nINCONTROLLER poses the greatest threat to Ukraine, NATO member states, and other states actively responding to\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. Organizations should take immediate action to determine if the targeted ICS devices are\npresent in their environments and begin applying vendor-specific countermeasures.\n\nWe also recommend that at-risk organizations conduct threat hunts to detect this activity in their networks.

Omron's guidance for unpatched vulnerabilities, as noted in their security brief, indicates](http://www.omron-cxone.com/security/2019-12-06_PLC_EN.pdf)\nthat external firewall filtering of identified FIN ports can be used as a mitigation. Mandiant believes that the recommended\nmethodology may be a viable mitigation, though this mechanism has not been tested with INCONTROLLER. Additional\n[guidance related to Omron's previous recommendations can be found in the related ICS Advisory for that older vulnerability.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-19-346-02)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Discovery Methods\n\n### TAGRUN\n\nSearch for and investigate irregular connections to OPC UA endpoints and enable robust audit logging for OPC UA\napplications. Aggregate OPC UA logs and audit records to a central location where applicable.\nReview OPC UA audit records for evidence of credential bruteforcing, nefarious certificate usage, irregular connection\nattempts, configuration changes, and changes to OPC tags.\nSearch for and investigate TAGRUN ping command execution.\nReview OT network traffic for evidence of pingsweep activity.\n\n### CODECALL\n\nEnable robust logging for Schneider Electric PLC devices and aggregate logs to a central location where applicable.\nReview Schneider Electric device logs for evidence of the following
