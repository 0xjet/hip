Previous versions of this malware attacked a number of European countries, but\nRomania wasn’t among them and is rarely a top target. Our analysis reveals that Tinba v3’s\ndevelopers have expanded the capabilities and reach of the malware by updating its\nwebinjections to match the new banks targeted in the Eastern European country.\n\n## The Tinba Bunch\n\nThe [Tinba Trojan (also known as TinyBanker or Zusy) was first discovered in the wild in mid-](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/tinba/)\n2012. It was dubbed “tiny” due to its slim 20 KB file size, which included its configuration and\nwebinjection kit. This malware initially acted like a classic banking Trojan, dedicated to\ngrabbing user credentials and network traffic. The first Tinba release sported a form grabber\nto steal usernames and passwords and a webinjection mechanism for man-in-the-browser\n(MitB) attacks.\n\nAlthough it started out as a tool used exclusively by its developers and their gang, its source\ncode was leaked in mid-2014, and the project then began evolving in other directions. That\ncode leak gave immediate rise to two more Tinba variations, which were taken up by\ndifferent gangs, spawning Tinba v2 and Tinba v3. Each is a fully independent Trojan\nvariation, clearly developed and updated by different individuals.\n\nThe most recent addition to the Tinba bunch is a fourth variation. Again, a new gang took the\nsource code and revamped it to create a unique banking Trojan. In late June 2015, this gang\n[lured in victims via a malvertising campaign, which led users to an exclusive exploit kit called](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2015/06/elusive-hanjuan-ek-caught-in-new-malvertising-campaign/)\nHanJuan. HanJuan then dropped Tinba 4, the actual banking malware.\n\nOf all the Tinba variations, v3 appears to be the most active and possibly commercially\navailable. It is more prolific and appears to be used by more than one group.\n\n[Learn more about Staying ahead of threats with global threat intelligence](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=mrs-form-5398&S_PKG=ov37298)\n\n## Tinba v3 Extending Its Reach\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration that targets Romanian banks at this time is linked with Tinba v3. Right from\nits first release, this variation showed that the developer behind it put some work into new\nfeatures designed to enhance the Trojan’s evasion techniques, bypass automated security\ncontrols and “phone home,” even when the original command-and-control (C&C) server is\ndown.\n\nBotmasters typically strive to protect their botnets from potential hijacking and takedowns,\nand Tinba v3’s developer took extra care to ensure that its fallback mechanisms would\nsecure the illicit business continuity.\n\n[In terms of its modus operandi, Tinba v3 relies on four principal fraud capabilities:](https://securityintelligence.com/spotlight-cpf-fraud-in-brazil/)\n\nA persistent user-mode rootkit;\n\nThe ability to steal any set of credentials with a generic form grabber;\n\nMitB capabilities;\n\nDynamic webinjection mechanisms.\n\nTinba v3 uses a few browser injection approaches. For example, the Trojan works with an\nautomated transfer system (ATS) panel. ATS is fraudster lingo for a remote platform that\nTrojans access on the fly. The ATS contains transaction automation scripts, preprogrammed\nparameters and thresholds and mule account numbers that the malware relies on to\ncomplete illicit online transactions.\n\nATS was much more popular before two-factor authentication schemes came into the\nequation, but it is still effective in this case. The panels used by Tinba include dynamic social\nengineering designed to ask for the victim’s one-time password and then plug it into the\nbank’s page to complete the transaction.\n\nAnother common webinjection approach Tinba v3 uses in its configurations is called FIGrabber, short for full information grabber. This is lingo for an injection that asks the victim to\nkey in a large amount of personally identifiable information (PII) and other private details\nabout the account. These grabbers are accessed on a remote server and automatically\nmatch the most relevant injection to the bank the victim is browsing.\n\nFI-Grabbers are actually a paid cybercrime service that promises effective injections leading\nto a successful transfer. This all happens in real time and without exposing the Trojan’s\nactual injections inside the configuration file. Reaching out to an FI-Grabber is considered to\nbe a more advanced means of manipulating Web sessions while still keeping the Trojan’s\nsecrets under wraps.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware s fraud scenario is similar to other Trojans of this grade: collect victims\ncredentials, grab PII and use social engineering to steal two-factor authentication codes.\nActual illicit transactions generated from Tinba-infected users typically come from the victim’s\nown device, which is indicative of the use of automation after the victim keys in the one-time\npassword. Tinba-enabled illegitimate online banking operations take place via a remote\ntransaction orchestration panel.\n\n## Threat Status\n\nIn terms of Tinba’s proliferation this year, IBM Security data shows that this malware is\nranked sixth in popularity. It is right behind [Gozi, which is considered commercial malware.](https://securityintelligence.com/gozi-financial-malware-puts-the-boots-on)\n\n[Tinba v3 attacks online banking customers all over Europe, mainly targeting Poland, Italy,](https://securityintelligence.com/tinba-worlds-smallest-malware-has-big-bag-of-nasty-tricks)\nGermany and the Netherlands. Per IBM Security X-Force data, this is the very first time we\nidentified any of the Tinba variations attacking in Romania.\n\n## What’s Next for Romania?\n\nBased on other Tinba v3 campaigns that IBM Security is familiar with, we expect to see more\nTinba attacks in Romania going forward. The country may only be starting to face Tinba, but\nit is already plagued by the Dridex Trojan, Dyre, Neverquest and Zeus v2 variants. IBM\nSecurity data shows that, since the beginning of 2015, the most active Trojan in Romania is\nDridex, but that could stand to change if Tinba accelerates its activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince Tinba v3 webinjections are designed to harvest large amounts of personal information\nas well as two-factor authentication codes during the Web session, IBM Security\nrecommends that banks alert their customers of the threat and refresh the online banking\nsecurity education sections of their websites.\n\nRomanian banks should ask customers to report suspicious emails. These financial\n[institutions should also work closely with their antifraud provider to lower and contain risks as](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/category/advanced-fraud-protection)\nmuch as possible.\n\n[Read the white paper: Staying ahead of threats with global threat intelligence](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=mrs-form-5398&S_PKG=ov37298)\n\n[Limor Kessem](https://securityintelligence.com/author/limor-kessem/)\nExecutive Security Advisor, IBM\n\nLimor Kessem is an Executive Security Advisor at IBM Security.
