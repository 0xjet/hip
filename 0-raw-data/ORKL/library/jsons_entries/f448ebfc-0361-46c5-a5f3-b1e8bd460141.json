The BlackBerry_\n_Research & Intelligence Team has developed an automated system to help locate this type_\n_of threat – before it causes harm._\n\nBlackBerry today announced a new book: Finding Beacons in the Dark: A Guide to Cyber\n_Threat Intelligence, detailing the evolution and prevalence of one of the most pervasive_\ntools used by attackers – Cobalt Strike Beacon. This book guides the reader through a\nvariety of techniques they can use to identify Cobalt Strike Team Servers, giving them the\nintelligence needed to protect themselves and their organizations against malicious Cobalt\nStrike payloads. It outlines how a robust Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) lifecycle and an\nextended detection and response (XDR) solution can provide defenders with the context\nneeded to fully understand this type of threat, and be proactive in defending against it.\n\n### What is Cobalt Strike?\n\n\n-----\n\nInitially developed as an adversary simulation tool with threat emulation capabilities, Cobalt\nStrike has since evolved into one of the most persistent attack methods utilized by threat\nactors. Threat researchers [recently reported an incredible 161% year-over-year uptick in](https://threatpost.com/cobalt-strike-cybercrooks/167368/)\nthe use of Cobalt Strike by cybercriminals, making it effectively a mainstream tool in the\ncybercrime world. It has become a perennial problem for security practitioners, requiring\nrobust solutions that can aid in providing defensive capabilities and enhanced threat\nintelligence.\n\nPart of Cobalt Strike’s attraction is its flexibility and accessibility. For these reasons, it is\nwidely used by red teams but has become heavily abused by cybercriminals, who often use\ncracked or leaked copies. Threat actors can arm themselves with advanced adversarial\ntooling with ease, making what was once a complex affair nearly effortless. The software\nallows for the facilitation of many attack methods and has remained a favorite of numerous\nstate-sponsored actors.\n\nCobalt Strike’s primary payload, Beacon, provides a wealth of features for attackers,\nincluding keylogging, remote screenshots, data exfiltration, credential harvesting, privilege\nescalation, and many more. The software has played a significant role in the escalation of\nransomware-based attacks over the past 18 months. The new BlackBerry® book highlights\nthe current threats facing organizations, provides a comprehensive defense framework, and\nuncovers links between cyberattacks previously thought to be unrelated.\n\nThough Cobalt Strike is sold legitimately to red-teamers, for cybercriminals, obtaining\nexisting malware and related tools via underground forums can be significantly cheaper\nthan developing in-house technology, making their use of Cobalt Strike ideal as it presents\nsignificant attribution challenges to law enforcement. This challenge can be further\ncomplicated when cyber-mercenary groups are working at the behest of larger actors, even\nup to the scale of nation-states.\n\n“Cobalt Strike presents an almost perfect software for cybercriminals, while highlighting a\ncentral conundrum of the security sector – that well-built tools can both aid and increase\ncybercrime,” says Eric Milam, Vice President of Research and Intelligence, BlackBerry.\n“Cobalt Strike is feature-rich, well supported and actively maintained by its developers. Its\npayload provides a wealth of features for attackers. This makes it an attractive option for\nAPT groups and cybercrime novices alike.”\n\n### What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?\n\nIn the new book, the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team presents a robust system for\nhunting the Internet for instances of Cobalt Strike Team Server, which is the command-andcontrol (C2) server for Cobalt Strike Beacon. In addition, they present their CTI lifecycle,\nwhich outlines a multi-phase approach to building intelligence-led protection for products\nand services underpinning most XDR products and services.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy following the CTI lifecycle to hunt for Team Servers, and extracting configurations from\nthe Beacon payloads they serve, the book demonstrates how to leverage the resulting\ndataset to provide powerful intelligence insights. These insights can help to reveal clusters\nof servers associated with known threat groups and campaigns, as well as links between\nthem that were previously unseen, empowering defenders to expose correlations between\nseemingly disparate network infrastructure.\n\n### BlackBerry’s Goal: Turning the Hunted into the Hunter\n\nWhile the increasing proliferation of Cobalt Strike use within the criminal underground\npresents a significant concern, so does its continued (ab)use by sophisticated APT groups.\n[As recently as October 2021, APT41 was witnessed using the software in phishing emails](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/10/drawing-a-dragon-connecting-the-dots-to-find-apt41)\ntargeting Indian citizens, while Dridex operators have used Cobalt Strike heavily to\n[underpin their recent phishing and malspam campaigns.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/08/threat-thursday-ta575-dridex)\n\n“The aim of this book is to aid the security community by sharing our knowledge, presenting\nthe steps we’ve taken to create an automated system to hunt for Cobalt Strike, and most\nimportantly, demonstrating how to derive meaningful threat intelligence from the resulting\ndataset,” says Billy Ho, Executive Vice President of Product Engineering, BlackBerry. “This\ninformation can then be used to provide insights, trends and intelligence on threat groups\nand campaigns.”\n\nThe resulting intelligence can also be leveraged to provide actionable Indicators of\nCompromise (IOCs) to all XDR stakeholders, including defenders, hunters, analysts, and\ninvestigators alike. These will help readers to:\n\nDefend their organizations\nProduce in-depth CTI reports\nBetter understand the threat landscape\nStay ahead of the curve and give better advice to C-level executives and security\nteams seeking to make well informed security decisions\n\nThe new BlackBerry book Finding Beacons in the Dark: A Guide to Cyber Threat\n_Intelligence will be available in November 2021._\n\n[You can pre-order the book here.](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/forms/enterprise/ebook-beacons-in-the-dark)\n\nWatch the video trailer below:\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fAYNuBGaJng\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats,\nproviding intelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
