The use of weaponized legitimate](https://www.forcepoint.com/sites/default/files/resources/files/forcepoint-security-labs-monsoon-analysis-report.pdf)\ndocuments is a longstanding operational standard of this group.\n\nThe malicious documents seen in recent activity refer to a number of topics, including recent military\npromotions within the Pakistan Army, information related to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission,\nas well as Pakistan’s Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe BADNEWS malware payload, which these malicious documents ultimately deliver, has been\n[updated since the last public report in December 2017. BADNEWS acts as a backdoor for the](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/tech-brief-untangling-the-patchwork-cyberespionage-group.pdf)\nattackers, providing them with full control over the victim machine. It has historically leveraged\nlegitimate third-party websites to host the malware’s command and control (C2) information, acting as\n“dead drops”. After the C2 information has been collected, BADNEWS leverages HTTP for\n\ni i i h h\n\n\n#### Get updates: Unit 42\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber\nthreat intelligence and research from\nUnit42\n\n\nBusiness Email\n\n\n-----\n\nahead of the security community.\n\nIn this posting, we detail our findings and document these changes.\n\n### Delivery\n\nThe malicious documents that Unit 42 examined contained legitimate decoy lures as well as malicious\n[embedded EPS files targeting the CVE-2015-2545 and CVE-2017-0261 vulnerabilities. These](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2015-2545)\n[vulnerabilities are well covered in previous public works, which can be found from PWC and FireEye.](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/05/exploring-cve-2015-2545-and-its-users.html)\nOlder documents used by Patchwork focused on the CVE-2017-0261 vulnerability, however in late\nJanuary 2018 when, paradoxically, newer documents abandoned this vulnerability to attack the older\nCVE-2015-2545 vulnerability.\n\nThe lures are primarily documents of interest to Pakistani nuclear organizations and the Pakistani\nmilitary as can be seen in the images below:\n\n\nreCAPTC\n\nPlease upgrade to aSUBMIT supported browser\nto get a reCAPTCHA challenge.\n\nAlternatively if you think you are getting\nthis page in error, please check your\n\nTRENDING ARTICLESinternet connection and reload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Lure extracted from_\n_07d5509988b1aa6f8d5203bc4b75e6d7be6acf5055831cc961a51d3e921f96bd_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Lure extracted from_\n_b8abf94017b159f8c1f0746dca24b4eeaf7e27d2ffa83ca053a87deb7560a571_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload from each of the malicious documents is an updated version of the BADNEWS malware\nfamily. When the shellcode embedded within the malicious EPS is executed, the following three files\nare dropped:\n\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\VMwareCplLauncher.exe\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\vmtools.dll\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\MSBuild.exe\n\nIn the list of dropped files, VMwareCplLauncher.exe is a legitimate, signed VMware executable that\nserves to ultimately deliver the BADNEWS payload. The vmtools.dll file is a modified DLL that both\nensures persistence and loads MSBuild.exe, which is the BADNEWS malware renamed to spoof a\nlegitimate Microsoft Visual Studio tool.\n\nAfter the files are dropped, the VMwareCplLauncher.exe executable is run, which in turn loads the\nvmtools.dll DLL file. This DLL file creates a scheduled task named BaiduUpdateTask1, which attempts\nto run the malicious, spoofed MSBuild.exe every subsequent minute.\n\nThe technique of having a signed, legitimate, executable load a malicious library is commonly referred\n[to as side-loading, and has been witnessed in a number of campaigns and malware families in the past.](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1073)\n\nThe flow of execution from the time the victim opens the malicious Microsoft Word document, to the\nexecution of BADNEWS, may be seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Side-loading technique employed to deliver BADNEWS_\n\nThe following image demonstrates the scheduled task created by the modified vmtools.dll to ensure\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Scheduled task created to load BADNEWS_\n\n### BADNEWS\n\n[Much of BADNEWS has remained consistent from when it was originally discussed by Forcepoint in](https://www.forcepoint.com/sites/default/files/resources/files/forcepoint-security-labs-monsoon-analysis-report.pdf)\n[August 2016. Additionally, recent analysis by Trend Micro notes some minor changes during 2017. To](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/untangling-the-patchwork-cyberespionage-group/)\nbriefly recap, the BADNEWS malware family acts as a backdoor, with communication occurring over\nHTTP. A number of commands are provided to the attackers, including the ability to download and\nexecute additional information, upload documents of interest, and take screenshots of the desktop.\n\n[The malware collects C2 information when it is originally executed via “Dead Drop Resolvers”. Dead](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/APT17_Report.pdf)\ndrop resolvers have been used by multiple threat actor groups using various malware families and\nthose behind Patchwork are well versed with this tactic. This tactic uses public web services to host\ncontent that contains encoded commands that are decoded by the malware.\n\nFor the remainder of the analysis in this research blog, we are discussing the following file:\n\nSHA256 290ac98de80154705794e96d0c6d657c948b7dff7abf25ea817585e4c923adb2\n\nMD5 79ad2084b057847ce2ec2e48fda64073\n\nCompile 2017-12-22 11:54:03 UTC\n\n|SHA256|290ac98de80154705794e96d0c6d657c948b7dff7abf25ea817585e4c923adb2|\n|---|---|\n|MD5|79ad2084b057847ce2ec2e48fda64073|\n\n\n-----\n\nused the new mutex ‘com_mycompany_apps_appname_new’.\n\nThis variant of BADNEWS uses different filenames compared to previous versions. The following\nfilenames are used by BADNEWS throughout its execution. All of these files reside in the victim’s\n%TEMP% directory:\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\n9PT568.dat Contains victim unique identifier\n\nTPX498.dat Keystroke logs\n\nedg499.dat List of interesting files\n\nTPX499.dat Temporarily holds screenshot when given\ncommand by C2\n\nup Temporarily contains downloaded file to be\nexecuted when given command by C2\n\nOther changes we noticed in this variant include how the malware obfuscates C2 information stored\nvia dead drop resolvers. Previous variants of BADNEWS looked for data between ‘{{‘ and ‘}}’, and used\na simple cipher to decode this data. This new variant now looks for data between ‘[[‘ and ‘]]’ in a\nnumber of hardcoded URLs. This can be seen in the following images taken from hxxp://\nfeeds.rapidfeeds[.]com/88604/, which is one of the dead drop resolvers we encountered in this\nsample:\n\n|Filename|Description|\n|---|---|\n|9PT568.dat|Contains victim unique identifier|\n|TPX498.dat|Keystroke logs|\n|edg499.dat|List of interesting files|\n|TPX499.dat|Temporarily holds screenshot when given command by C2|\n|up|Temporarily contains downloaded file to be executed when given command by C2|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Dead drop resolver used by BADNEWS_\n\nIn order to decrypt this data, the authors have included additional steps from previous versions. To\ndecode this information, BADNEWS takes the following steps:\n\n1. Base64-decode the string\n2. Perform the decoding cipher used in previous versions\n3. Base64-decode the result\n4. Decrypt the result using the Blowfish algorithm and a static key\n\nA script, which is included in the Appendix, will decrypt data from these dead drop resolvers. In the\nexample shown above, we are presented with a result of 185.203.118[.]115 after all four steps are\ntaken.\n\nBADNEWS performs many of the expected functions associated with previous versions including\nkeylogging and identifying files of interest. Unlike a previously reported variant, this version of\nBADNEWS no longer looks at USB drives for interesting files. Instead, it looks at fixed drives only. It\ncontinues to seek out files with the following extensions:\n\n.xls\n.xlsx\n.doc\n.docx\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to prepare for C2 communication, BADNEWS will aggregate various victim information,\nwhich is appended to two strings. These strings have the following format:\n\n\n1 uuid=[Victim ID]#un=[Username]#cn=[Hostname]#on=[OS Version]#lan=[IP Address]#nop=#ver=1.0\n\n\n1 uuid=[Victim ID]#un=[Username]#\n\n\nAn example of the first string may be seen below:\n\n1 uuid=e29ac6c0-7037-11de-816d-806e6f6e696351c5#un=Josh Grunzweig#cn=WIN-LJLV2NKIOKP#on=mav6miv1#lan=1\n\nIt should be noted that the variables used for this string are different from previous versions. For\nexample, in the previous variant of BADNEWS, the victim’s unique identifier was stored under a\nvariable named ‘uid’, the username was stored in a variable named ‘u’, etc. Additionally, the hardcoded\nversion string of ‘1.0’ is different from previous samples.\n\nC2 communication is also updated from prior versions, with the following commands now supported\nby BADNEWS:\n\nCommand Description\n\n0 Kill BADNEWS.\n\n4 Upload edg499.dat, which includes the list of\ninteresting files. Spawn a new instance of BADNEWS\nafter.\n\n5 Upload the file specified by the C2.\n\n8 Upload the TPX498.dat file, which contains the list of\ncollected keystrokes.\n\n13 Copy file to adbFle.tmp, and upload it to the C2.\n\n23 Take screenshot, temporarily store it as TPX499.dat,\nand upload it to the C2.\n\n33 Download specified file to %TEMP%\\up and execute it\nin a new process\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|0|Kill BADNEWS.|\n|4|Upload edg499.dat, which includes the list of interesting files.

An example request in a sandboxed environment\nmay be seen below:\n\n_Figure 8 Example request made by BADNEWS_\n\nTo decrypt the data provided in the POST request, a number of steps are required. First, the attackers\ninclude a series of extra ‘=’ and ‘&’ characters within the data stream. Once these are removed, the\ndata is decoded with base64. Finally, the result is decrypted using AES-128 and the following static\nkey (hex-encoded):\n\nDD1876848203D9E10ABCEEC07282FF37\n\n### Conclusion\n\nh h k i l i i l d i hi h di b i h h h\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Ministry of the Interior.\n\nOne of the malware families tied to this group, BADNEWS, continues to be updated both in how it\nuses dead drop resolvers, as well as how it communicates with a remote C2 server.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in a number of ways:\n\nTraps blocks the exploit documents witnessed during this campaign\nWildFire accurately identifies the samples mentioned in this blog as malicious\n[The Patchwork and BADNEWS tags in AutoFocus may be used for continued monitoring and](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Patchwork)\ntracking of this threat.\n\nAdditionally, the providers being used for dead drops have been notified.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Malicious Word Document SHA256 Hashes**\n\na67220bcf289af6a99a9760c05d197d09502c2119f62762f78523aa7cbc96ef1\n\n07d5509988b1aa6f8d5203bc4b75e6d7be6acf5055831cc961a51d3e921f96bd\n\nfd8394b2ff9cd00380dc2b5a870e15183f1dc3bd82ca6ee58f055b44074c7fd4\n\nb8abf94017b159f8c1f0746dca24b4eeaf7e27d2ffa83ca053a87deb7560a571\n\nd486ed118a425d902044fb7a84267e92b49169c24051ee9de41327ee5e6ac7c2\n\n**BADNEWS SHA256 Hashes**\n\nab4f86a3144642346a3a40e500ace71badc06a962758522ca13801b40e9e7f4a\n\n290ac98de80154705794e96d0c6d657c948b7dff7abf25ea817585e4c923adb2\n\n\n-----\n\n94.156.35[.]204\n\n**Dead Drop Resolvers**\n\nhxxp://feed43[.]com/8166706728852850.xml\n\nhxxp://feed43[.]com/3210021137734622.xml\n\nhxxp://www.webrss[.]com/createfeed.php?feedid=49966\n\nhxxp://feeds.rapidfeeds[.]com/88604/\n\n**Script to Decrypt Dead Drop Resolvers**\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\nimport requests\nimport base64\nimport binascii\nimport re\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish\nfrom struct import pack\n\nrol = lambda val, r_bits, max_bits: (val << r_bits%max_bits) & (2**max_bits-1) | ((val & (2**max_bi\n\nror = lambda val, r_bits, max_bits: ((val & (2**max_bits-1)) >> r_bits%max_bits) | (val << (max_bit\n\ndef unhexData(d):\nif len(d) % 2:\nd = d.zfill(len(d)+1)\nreturn ord(binascii.unhexlify(d))\n\ndef decodeDecrypt(data):\ndecdata = ''\nfor x in range(len(data)):\nx = x*2\nif x < len(data):\n\nc unhexData(data[x])\n\n\n-----\n\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n\n\ndecdata += chr(c)\ndata2 = base64.b64decode(decdata)\nkey = binascii.unhexlify(\"F0E1D2C3B4A5968778695A4B3C2D1E0F0011223344556677\")\ncipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)\ndec = cipher.decrypt(data2)\nreturn dec\n\nurls = [\n\"http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/88604\"\n]\n\nfor d in urls:\nr = requests.get(d)\nbody = r.text\nr = re.search(\"\\[+\\s*([a-zA-Z0-9\\=]+)\\]+\", body)\nif r:\ndata = base64.b64decode(r.group(0))\nprint(\"[{}] Decrypted C2: {}\".format(d, decodeDecrypt(data).split(\"\\x00\")[0]))\n\n###### Got something to say?\n\n\nLeave a comment...\n\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-mail**\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail (required)\n\nWebsite\n\nSUBMIT\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTERS COMPANY\n\n[Company](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\nEmail SUBSCRIBE\n\n[Careers](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)\n\n[Sitemap](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)\n\n[Report a Vulnerability](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security-disclosure)\n\n© 2016 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
