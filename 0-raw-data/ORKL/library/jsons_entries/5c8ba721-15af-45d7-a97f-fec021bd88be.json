Mindware and SFile Ransomware Technical Breakdown\n\n**[sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-another-rebrand-mindware-and-sfile-ransomware-technical-breakdown/](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-another-rebrand-mindware-and-sfile-ransomware-technical-breakdown/)**\n\nJune 6, 2022\n\nResearchers have recently noted the emergence of a new ransomware operator calling itself\n‘Mindware’. The gang is thought to be responsible for a number of attacks beginning around\nMarch to April 2022, with suggestions that the malware was used to attack a not-for-profit\nmental health provider. Aside from targeting organizations in the Healthcare sector,\nMindware has posted data on its leaks site belonging to organizations in sectors such as\nFinance, Engineering and Manufacturing. Mindware has a number of overlaps with an earlier\nransomware strain known as SFile (aka SFile2, Escal). In this post, we review how Mindware\ndiffers from other ransomware families, note its similarities to SFile, and provide technical\nindicators to aid threat hunters and detection teams.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\n[According to one source, the Mindware gang first became active in March 2022. By April, the](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/05/ransomware-april-2022-review/)\ngroup was practicing double extortion and operating its own leaks site. Mindware received\nfurther attention in April when it was noted by a different [researcher to have attacked a](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1519733027655626754?s=20&t=zmml0XkOra0Z_Z6U7ck37w)\nmental health provider.\n\nMindware samples use a distinctive Reflective DLL injection technique. This, along with other\nindicators described below, show strong overlaps with SFile ransomware samples. Although\nwe do not yet have specifics as to how Mindware attacks are initiated, SFile is known to use\nRDP bruteforce as an entry vector into an organization.\n\nEach Mindware payload is configured for a specific target. Upon infection and successful\nexecution, the payload drops a hardcoded ransomware note containing a combination of\ninstructions and threats.\n\n\n-----\n\nMindware ransom note\n[In common with a move made by other ransomware groups recently, Mindware attempts to](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/negotiation-is-a-hostile-act-ransomware-gangs-turn-up-the-heat-on-victims/)\ndiscourage victims from contacting ‘recovery companies’, negotiators or authorities,\nthreatening to immediately leak data should they do so. Victims are provided with a .onion\nURL as a means to make contact with the attackers and to decrypt two “random files” as\nproof that the operators possess a decryption key. Victims that refuse to pay are listed on the\nMindware ransomware public leaks site.\n\n\n-----\n\nMindware public leaks site\n\n## Mindware Technical Analysis\n\nAs noted above, Mindware uses Reflective DLL Injection, a technique in which the shellcode\ndynamically retrieves handles to key API functions like LoadLibraryA() and GetProcAddress()\nby locating function addresses through the Export Address Table loaded by the host process.\n\nThis allows the shellcode to be position-independent by building its own import table and\nparsing through when executed in memory. This means a PE file could be loaded in the form\nof shellcode or a DLL entirely from memory.\n\nThe technique, which has also been noted in other ransomware families such as\nBlackMatter, avoids searching for module names directly and instead checks for hashes\nprecalculated with a ROT13 algorithm.\n\nMindware and SFile samples require kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll. The APIs are searched for\nusing a combination of the PEB (Process Environment Block) of the module and the EAT\n(Export Address Table) and enumerating all function names.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nROT13 Algorithm\nAs noted, the same technique is characteristic of SFile ransomware samples, first seen in\n2020 and active through 2021. Interestingly, SFile attacks seem to have been on hiatus over\nthe last 9 months or so, and the emergence of Mindware samples with strong overlaps is\nindicative, as other researchers have noted, of a possible rebrand.\n\nBoth SFile and Mindware ransomware payloads accept the following parameters:\n```\n  --enable-shares -> encrypt network shares\n  --kill-susp -> Triggers process termination\n\n```\nThe ransomware checks for and then encrypts internal, removable and remote drive types.\n\nMindware and SFile payloads check for different drive types\nOver 200 file types are targeted for encryption, denoted by a hardcoded list of file\nextensions. However, the following files are specifically excluded from encryption:\n\n\n-----\n\nautorun.inf\ndesktop.ini\nntuser.ini\nboot.ini\niconcache.db\nthumbs.db\nbootfont.bin\nntuser.dat\nbootmgr\nbootsect.bak\nntuser.dat.log\nmessage_to_<<redacted>>.txt\n! cynet ransom protection(don’t delete)\n\nSimilarly, files in the following locations are also excluded from encryption:\n\n%windir% \\all users\\microsoft\\ \\cache2\\\n\n\\google\\ \\All Users\\Microsoft\\ :\\$RECYCLE.BIN\\\n\n\n\\Program Files\\Internet\nExplorer\\\n\n\n\\far manager\\ \\mozilla\\\n\n\n\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\ \\windows\\system32\\ :\\system volume\ninformation\\\n\n\\ida 7.0\\ \\tor browser\\ \\Local\\Microsoft\\\n\n\n\\windows\\syswow64\\ \\Program Files\\Microsoft\nGames\\\n\n\n\\ida 6.8\\\n\n\n\\windows.old\\ \\Local Settings\\Microsoft\\ \\windows\\system\\\n\n\\inetpub\\logs\\ \\Default\\Extensions\\ \\intel\\\n\n\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\ \\windows\\winsxs\\ :\\boot\\\n\n\\Temporary Internet Files\\ \\msocache\\ \\Common\\Microsoft\\\n\n\\System\\msadc\\ :\\drivers\\ \\Temp\\\n\n\\perflogs\\ \\Sophos\\ \\Common Files\\\n\n:\\wsus\\ $windows.~bt \\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\\n\n\\Symantec\\ \\WindowsPowerShell\\ \\cache\\\n\n$windows.~ws \\Application Data\\Microsoft\\ \\Leaked\\\n\n\n-----\n\n\\Mozilla Firefox\\\n\nIn order to protect itself and prevent other running processes from interfering with the\nencryption process, Mindware kills all other processes, with the exception of the following:\n\nexplorer.exe powershell.exe rundll32.exe\n\nvmnetdhcp.exe vmware-authd.exe vmware-hostd.exe\n\nvmware-tray.exe vmware-usbarbitrator.exe vmware-usbarbitrator32.exe\n\nvmware-usbarbitrator64.exe webroot_updater.exe werfault.exe\n\nwindowsupdate.exe\n\nList of processes that Mindware and SFile allow to run\nSFile and Mindware samples are PEs typically around 250-300KB in size.\n\n## SFile and Mindware Ransomware Targeting\n\nAnalysis of the SFile payloads shows that SFile ransomware was mostly used against U.S\norganizations in Manufacturing, Mechanical, and Automobile sectors.\n\n**SHA1 – SFile Samples** **Targeted Sector/Industry**\n\n28f73b38ace67b48e525d165e7a16f3b51cec0c0 Automotive Engineering\n\nbdb0c0282b303843e971fbcd6d2888d834da204c Other Personal Services\n\n5ffac9dff916d69cd66e91ec6228d8d92c5e6b37 Investment\n\n6960beedbf4c927b75747ba08fe4e2fa418d4d9b Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n665572b84702c4c77f59868c5fe4d0b621f2e62a Insurance\n\na67686b5ce1d970a7920b47097d20dee927f0a4d Retail\n\n14e4557ea8d69d289c2432066d860b60a6698548 Sample has hardcoded org name as\nCCCR [parent organization could not\nbe determined]\n\n0f20e5ccdbbed4cc3668577286ca66039c410f95 Engineering\n\nMindware samples also show a strong preference for businesses in similar industries.\n\n**SHA1 – Mindware Samples** **Targeted Sector/Industry**\n\nae974e5c37936ac8f25cfea0225850be61666874 Engineering\n\ne9b52a4934b4a7194bcbbe27ddc5b723113f11fe Healthcare\n\n9bc1972a75bb88501d92901efc9970824e6ee3f5 Manufacturing\n\nf91d3c1c2b85727bd4d1b249cd93a30897c44caa Finance\n\n46ca0c5ad4911d125a245adb059dc0103f93019d Engineering\n\n## How To Protect Against Mindware and SFile Ransomware\n\n[The SentinelOne Singularity platform detects and prevents execution of Mindware and SFile](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\nransomware strains.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor organizations not currently protected by SentinelOne, please see the list of Indicators of\nCompromise at the end of this post and the technical indicators described above.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndications suggest Mindware is likely a rebrand of SFile, or at least that the same source\ncode or builder for SFile is available to Mindware operators. While neither strain has\nachieved the notoriety of some of the more well-known ransomware strains that have been\ncirculating recently, it may be that flying under the radar and hitting selective targets without\nattracting too much public attention is exactly what the gang are aiming for.\n\nWe hope that the information in this post serves to enable security teams to ensure that they\nhave adequate resources to detect and prevent this threat.
