Our goal is to provide insights into threat actor tactics,_\n_targets, and campaigns to deliver actionable detection and mitigation opportunities to_\n_defenders._\n\nAccenture’s Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) group and Prevailion’s Adversarial\nCounterintelligence Team (PACT) dug into recently publicized campaigns of the cyber\nespionage threat group Lyceum (aka HEXANE, Spirlin) to further analyze the operational\ninfrastructure and victimology of this actor. The team’s findings corroborate and reinforce\n[previous ClearSky and](https://www.clearskysec.com/siamesekitten/) [Kaspersky research indicating a primary focus on computer network](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kayal-etal.pdf)\nintrusion events aimed at telecommunications providers in the Middle East. Additionally, the\nresearch expands on this victim set by identifying additional targets within internet service\nproviders (ISPs) and government agencies. Although all victim-identifying information has\nbeen redacted, this report seeks to provide these targeted industry and geographic verticals\nwith additional knowledge of the threat and mitigation opportunities.\n\n**Findings:**\n\nThe ACTI/PACT team made the following key findings:\n\nBetween July and October 2021, Lyceum backdoors appear to have targeted ISPs and\ntelecommunication operators in Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia as well as a\nministry of foreign affairs (MFA) in Africa.\nAt least two of the identified compromises are assessed to be ongoing despite prior\npublic disclosure of indicators of compromise (IOCs).\nDomain name system (DNS) tunneling appears to be used only during the early stages\nof backdoor deployment; subsequently, the Lyceum operators use the HTTP(S)\ncommand and control (C2) functionality encoded in the backdoors.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n[From an offset in the comprehensive analysis by ClearSky and](https://www.clearskysec.com/siamesekitten/) [Kaspersky, ACTI and PACT](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kayal-etal.pdf)\nhave conducted research on these campaigns based on Prevailion’s network telemetry\noverlaid with ACTI’s technical understanding of Lyceum backdoor communication.\n\nThe joint ACTI/PACT research team was able to identify additional web-based infrastructure\nused by Lyceum, which corroborated previous reporting and identified six domains with a\npreviously unknown connection to Lyceum (five of which are currently registered). This\nresearch eventually fueled Prevailion’s ability to annex over 20 Lyceum domains, which\nprovided network telemetry of ongoing compromises. Analysis of this telemetry, enriched and\ncorroborated with host-based data, allowed the team to identify additional victims and\nprovide further visibility into Lyceum’s targeting methodology.\n\n**Victimology:**\n\n\n-----\n\nActive since 2017, Lyceum targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance,\nincluding oil and gas organizations and telecommunications providers. ACTI/PACT assess\nthe targets for this campaign to be congruent with Lyceum’s previous activity, however, the\ngroup has expanded its target set to include ISPs and government bodies.\n\nACTI/PACT identified victims within telecommunication companies and ISPs in Israel,\nMorocco, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia as well as an MFA in Africa. Telecommunications\ncompanies and ISPs are high-level targets for cyber espionage threat actors because once\ncompromised, they provide access to various organizations and subscribers in addition to\ninternal systems that can be used to leverage malicious behavior even further. Additionally,\ncompanies within these industries can also be used by threat actors or their sponsors to\nsurveil individuals of interest. MFAs are also highly sought-after targets because they have\nvaluable intelligence on the current state of bilateral relationship and insight into future\ndealings.\n\n**Investigation Summary:**\n\nDuring this campaign, Lyceum used two primary malware families, dubbed Shark and Milan\n(a.k.a. James). The ACTI/PACT investigation focused on the C2 communication aspects that\nanalysts observed in Prevailion’s telemetry, since [ClearSky and](https://www.clearskysec.com/siamesekitten/) [Kasperksy have already](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kayal-etal.pdf)\nprovided detailed technical descriptions of the backdoors. Both backdoors can communicate\nvia DNS and HTTP(S) for C2 communication (see Detailed Technical Description below for\nmore information).\n\nShark produces a configuration file that contains at least one C2 domain, which is used with\na Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) for DNS tunneling or HTTP C2 communications. The\nC2 domains’ authoritative name server is attacker controlled allowing Lyceum operators to\nprovide commands through IP-addresses in the A-records of DNS responses. Shark uses a\nspecific syntax when sending HTTP requests that enabled ACTI/PACT researchers to create\na regular expression – a combination of characters in strings that specify a search pattern –\nto identify additional victims of the campaign. Using this regular expression, the researchers\nwere able to pivot from likely Israeli hosts to IP-addresses resolving to telecommunication\nand ISPs in Israel and Saudi-Arabia. The backdoor had consistent beaconing at these\nvictims beginning in September through October 2021.\n\nFor C2 communications over DNS, Milan uses hardcoded domains as the input for a custom\nDGA. The DGA is documented in [Kaspersky’s report as is some of the syntax used by Milan](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kayal-etal.pdf)\nfor C2 over HTTP(S). However, ACTI found that some of the legacy Milan backdoors retrieve\ndata by generating requests using the hard-coded domain and then requesting one of a\nnumber Active Server Pages-related URL paths. These URL paths are hardcoded within\nsome of the Milan samples. Those identified by ACTI were:\n\ncontact.aspx\ndefault.aspx\n\n\n-----\n\npreview.aspx\nteam.aspx\n\nWhen the ACTI/PACT team queried the Prevailion dataset for the above-referenced, known,\nhard-coded URL paths observed in Milan samples, the team observed continued beaconing\nin October from an IP address that resolved to a telecommunications operator in Morocco.\n\nFollowing this investigation thread, the ACTI/PACT team identified beaconing from a\nreconfigured or possibly a new Lyceum backdoor in late October 2021. The observed\nbeacons were seen egressing from a telecommunications company in Tunisia as well as an\nMFA in Africa. The URL syntax of the newly reconfigured backdoor is similar to those\ngenerated in the newer version of Milan, however because the URL syntax is configurable, it\nis likely that the Lyceum operators reconfigured the URL syntax used by Milan to circumvent\nintrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that were encoded\nto detect the previous Milan beacon syntax.\n\n**Outlook:**\n\nACTI/PACT assess that Lyceum is likely updating its backdoors in light of recent public\nresearch into its activities to try and stay ahead of defensive systems. The group has\ncontinued its targeting of companies of national strategic importance. Lyceum will likely\ncontinue to use the Shark and Milan backdoors, albeit with some modifications, as the group\nhas likely been able to maintain footholds in victims’ networks despite public disclosure of\nIOCs associated with its operations.\n\n_To learn more about this threat actor and obtain additional behavioral analytics and detection_\n_[opportunities, please contact info@prevailion.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:info@prevailion.com)_\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nAccenture and Prevailion provide the following detection opportunities and IOCs to aid\nenterprises within the targeted industries and verticals in detecting Lyceum activity.\n\n**Detection Opportunities for Shark:**\n\nShark uses randomly generated directories to stage files for upload or after download. Below\nis an example:\n```\nc:userslukedesktopwinlangdbdir468526d1102461\n\n```\n_(See also Image 1 in the Detailed Technical Description)_\n\nThe directories always appear to be appended by the filename of the Shark payload (e.g.,\nwinlangdbdir) and end with a 14-digit alphanumerical string (e.g., 468526d1102461).\nDetection engineers or network defenders are encouraged to look for similar directories on\nclients and servers in their networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nShark HTTP telemetry will match the following URL syntax:\n```\n//?q=[a-z0-9]{8}(-[a-z0-9]{4}){3}-[a-z0-9]{12}&qi=[A-Za-z0-9%]{16}&q1=/\n\n```\nThe URL syntax used by the new or reconfigured Lyceum backdoor is matched by the\nfollowing regular expression:\n```\n //?(proto|kind|pt)=[0-9]{1}&(index|pi|serv)=/\n\n```\n**Detection Opportunities for Milan:**\n\nDefenders can use the following YARA rule to sweep their filesystems for the presence of\nMilan:\n```\nrule Milan\n{ meta:\nauthor = \"ACTI\"\ndate = \"2021-06-03\"\ndescription = \"matches ping, PDB strings and User-Agent syntax from the MilanRAT\nbackdoor\"\nhash = \"b46949feeda8726c0fb86d3cd32d3f3f53f6d2e6e3fcd6f893a76b8b2632b249\"\nhash1 = \"d3606e2e36db0a0cb1b8168423188ee66332cae24fe59d63f93f5f53ab7c3029\"\nhash2 = \"21ab4357262993a042c28c1cdb52b2dab7195a6c30fa8be723631604dd330b29\"\nhash3 = \"a2754d7995426b58317e437f8ed6770cd7bb7b18d971e23b2b300b75e34fa086\"\nhash4 = \"b766522dd4189fef7775d663e5649ba9d8be8e03022039d20848fcbc3643e5f2\"\nhash5 = \"b54a67062bdcd32dfa9f3d7b69780d2e6e4925777290bc34e8f979a1b4b72ea2\"\nstrings:\n$re = /cmd.exe /C ping ([0-9]{1}.{1}){3}[0-9]{1} -n [0-9]{1}/ wide\n$a1 = \"Mozilla/5.0\" wide\n$a2 = \"rmdir\" wide\n$b2 = \"C:\\Users\\kernel\\Desktop\\milan\\Release\\Milan.pdb\" ascii wide\n$b3 = \"Milan-asdsad-asd23-23-ad234-213-sad\" ascii wide\n$b4 = \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;\n.NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)\" ascii wide\n$b5 = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36\" ascii wide\ncondition:uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and filesize > 800KB and $re and (all of ($a*) or 2 of\n($b*))}\n\n```\n**Indicators of Compromise:**\n\nDefenders should query their network logs for any traffic matching the following Lyceum C2\ndomains:\n\ndefenderlive[.]com\ndnsstatus[.]org\nwsuslink[.]com\nakastatus[.]com\nupdatecdn[.]net\ndnscdn[.]org\nsysadminnews[.]info\n\n\n-----\n\nwindowsupdatecdn[.]com\nhpesystem[.]com\ncybersecnet[.]org\ncybersecnet[.]co[.]za\nexcsrvcdn[.]com\nonline-analytic[.]com\nweb-traffic[.]info\nhpesystem[.]com\nindianmombais[.]com\ndefenderstatus[.]com\nzonestatistic[.]com\n\nThe following domains were identified during the course of analysis; the joint team assesses\nthat these domains are likely associated with Lyceum as part of its past or current\ninfrastructure.\n\ncheckinternet[.]org\ndigitalmarketingagency[.]net\ndnsanalizer[.]com\nlivednscdn[.]com\nmicrsoftonline[.]net\n\nThe following Lyceum domains were seen to be used by the reconfigured or new Lyceum\nbackdoor:\n\ncentosupdatecdn[.]com\ndnscatalog[.]net\nsecurednsservice[.]net\nuctpostgraduate[.]com\n\nFor reference and further analysis, defenders can access the following file-hashes related to\nthe Milan and Shark backdoors:\n\n**Shark:**\n```\n89ab99f5721b691e5513f4192e7c96eb0981ddb6c2d2b94c1a32e2df896397b82f2ef9e3f6db2146\nbd277d3c4e94c002ecaf7deaabafe6195fddabc81a8ee76c44faf11719b3a679e7a6dd5db40033ec4\ndd6e1b0361c145b81586cb735a64112f6ae4f4373510c4e096fab84383b547c8997ccf3673c00660\ndf8a3dc9ed1f3ca\n\n```\n**Milan:**\n```\nB46949feeda8726c0fb86d3cd32d3f3f53f6d2e6e3fcd6f893a76b8b2632b249d3606e2e36db0a0cb1\nb8168423188ee66332cae24fe59d63f93f5f53ab7c302921ab4357262993a042c28c1cdb52b2dab71\n95a6c30fa8be723631604dd330b29a2754d7995426b58317e437f8ed6770cd7bb7b18d971e23b2b30\n0b75e34fa086b766522dd4189fef7775d663e5649ba9d8be8e03022039d20848fcbc3643e5f2b54a67\n062bdcd32dfa9f3d7b69780d2e6e4925777290bc34e8f979a1b4b72ea2\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Detailed Technical Description:**\n\nACTI/PACT will only provide a brief presentation of the malware families and will focus on the\nC2 communication aspects that analysts observed in Prevailion’s telemetry, since [ClearSky](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Siamesekitten.pdf)\n[and Kasperksy have already provided detailed technical descriptions of the Shark and Milan](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kayal-etal.pdf)\n(a.k.a. James) backdoors.\n\n**Shark:**\n\nShark is a 32-bit executable written in C# and .NET. To run Shark, a parameter is passed on\nthe command line that includes the executable’s filename. Shark generates a mutex that\nuses the executable’s filename as the mutex value. The mutex likely ensures Shark does not\nexecute on a machine where it is already running and that the correct version of Shark is\nexecuted.\n\nShark does not use code to facilitate persistence; instead, Shark runs its functions as infinite\nthreads, which enables Shark to persist as long as the victim’s machine is turned on. The\ndevelopers likely designed Shark for clients or servers with high uptime or for machines to\nwhich they have access and can re-launch the Shark executable if the machine is turned off.\n\nShark uses a function called “redus” to produce a configuration file that is XOR-encoded,\ncompressed with Gzip, and has the same name as the Shark executable. All files that ACTI\nanalyzed were XOR-encoded with the hexadecimal key 0x2a.\n\n_Image 1: Snip from Shark Configuration File_\n\nThe configuration file contains at least one C2 domain, which is used with a DGA for DNS\ntunneling or HTTP C2 communications. The C2 domains’ authoritative name server is\nattacker-controlled, allowing Lyceum operators to provide commands through IP addresses\nin the A records of DNS responses.\n\nSpecific parameters within the Shark backdoor configuration file indicate whether the\nbackdoor is to use DNS or HTTP for C2:\n\nS1, S2: The configured C2 servers.\nT1, T2: Sleep time values.\n\n\n-----\n\nd1,u1,d2,u2: Staging folders for upload and download where different directories are\nused depending on whether the upload or download occurs with DNS or HTTP.\n\nWhen sending HTTP requests, Shark uses the following syntax:\n```\nhttp://maliciousdomain.com/?q=[GUID + (request type string)]&qi=[machine id (id\nparameter from config]&q1=[machine name]&q2=[vr = \"02\" for all samples] &q3=\n[HttpTimeOut(t2 parameter from config)]\n\n```\nThe “q” parameter in the request always contains a new GUID for each request and has the\nfollowing strings appended depending on the request type:\n\ns6rt – Beacon\nxrtf – Download\no543n – Upload\n\nThe image below shows a beacon request type, as designated by the s6rt marked in the\nupper blue box.\n\n_Image 2: Shark HTTP C2 Communication_\n\nTo capture the Shark C2 syntax, the ACTI/PACT research team created the following regular\nexpression:\n```\n//?q=[a-z0-9]{8}(-[a-z0-9]{4}){3}-[a-z0-9]{12}&qi=[A-Za-z0-9%]{16}&q1=/\n\n```\nThe parameters (“&qi”, “&q1”, “&q2”, “&q3” and “s6rt”) seen in the URL of the Shark HTTP\nrequests have been hardcoded in all observed Shark backdoors.\n\n**Milan:**\n\nMilan is a 32-bit RAT written in Visual C++ and .NET. Milan is loaded and persists using\ntasks. An encoded routine waits for three to four seconds between executing the first task,\ndeleting this task, and setting a second scheduled task for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the Milan backdoors analyzed by ACTI also include samples that were clustered as\n[DanBot backdoors in ClearSky’s report. However, these samples are all written in Visual C++](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Siamesekitten.pdf)\nand .NET, while DanBot samples are written in C# and .NET. Although there are certain\ndifferences among the Milan samples, ACTI has conducted sample comparisons indicating a\nhigh similarity across this cluster of Milan samples. The image below depicts five Milan\nsamples in which the strings in each sample has a greater than 86% code similarity rate with\nthe other backdoors.\n\n_Image 3: Sample Similarity Coverings Functions and strings among Milan Samples_\n\nLike Shark, Milan queries the registry key\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftCryptography MachineGuid to retrieve the\nGUID for the victim machine, from which both backdoors use the last eight characters to\ngenerate a unique identifier for the victim machine.\n\nLike Shark, Milan is also able to use both DNS and HTTP(S) for C2 communications. For C2\ncommunications over DNS, Milan uses hardcoded domains as the input for a custom (DGA).\nThe DGA is documented in Kaspersky’s report as is some of the syntax used by Milan for C2\nover HTTP(S).\n\nHowever, ACTI found that some of the legacy Milan backdoors retrieve data by generating\nrequests using the hard-coded domain and then requesting one of a number Active Server\nPage-related URL paths. These URL paths are hardcoded within some of the Milan samples.\nThose identified by ACTI were:\n\ncontact.aspx\ndefault.aspx\npreview.aspx\nteam.aspx\n\n**ACTI/PACT Investigation:**\n\n\n-----\n\nACTI started seeing the Shark campaign in host-based telemetry on July 19, 2021, when\nvarious hosts in Israel started executing a Shark backdoor with the following attributes:\n```\nFilename: “Shark.exe”\nSHA-256: 2f2ef9e3f6db2146bd277d3c4e94c002ecaf7deaabafe6195fddabc81a8ee76c\n\n```\nACTI observed this file being executed on a large number of hosts in Israel. Many of these\nmachines carried Windows 10 Enterprise and Pro builds, while other observed operating\nsystems within victim environments were older Windows Server 2016 Datacenter and\nWindows Server 2019 Datacenter builds. It is possible that some of the machines executing\nShark.exe were part of an incident response effort – against the Lyceum campaigns – as\nthey appear to have operating systems within (likely multiple individual) virtual machines that\nappear to have been created for single executions of the Shark backdoor on a variety of\nWindows operating systems. The referenced file (Shark.exe) was first submitted to a thirdparty malware repository on August 2, 2021 from a submitter who appears to be based in\nIsrael. On September 27, 2021, the same third-party malware repository submitter also\nuploaded a file with the following attributes:\n```\nFilename: “data.dat”\nSHA-256: 17ab5ee10033da8a519c0547581f40677b973345d8c3172a4fde612692188460\n\n```\nThis file is not malicious but contains the output from DNS requests generated by the DGA\nand the hardcoded C2 domain in the previously referenced Shark.exe file.\n\n_Image 4: Shark Generated Subdomains Found in File Uploaded from Israel_\n\nSeen in totality, the host-based Shark executions coupled with Shark backdoor and telemetry\nsubmissions from Israel, indicated to the ACTI/PACT research team that victimology would\nlikely include Lyceum victims in Israel. The research team overlaid the Shark malware syntax\non the Prevailion’s C2 telemetry, which at the time of analysis consisted of data from 14\nassessed Lyceum C2 domains. This was initially done to detect DGA-generated DNS\nrequests and subsequently the previously described HTTP patterns. The effort focusing on\n\n\n-----\n\nShark-generated DNS requests only yielded what is assessed to be sandbox runs of Shark\nsamples, egressing from various IP-address infrastructure owned by security or cloud\nvendors.\n\nHowever, when the ACTI/PACT research team queried the Prevailion dataset based on the\npreviously referenced regular expression, consistent beaconing was observed through\nSeptember and continuing into October 2021 from a number of IP addresses resolving to\ntelecommunication companies and ISPs in Israel and Saudi Arabia. The inclusion of the\nparameter: “s6rt” (see red box in image below) indicate backdoors where traffic was set for\nbeaconing.\n\n_Image 5: Prevailion Telemetry Indicating Backdoor Activity Egressing from Shark Backdoor_\n_Victims_\n\nThe Shark backdoors were likely in beacon mode due to Lyceum operators having lost\ncontrol of the backdoor following Prevailion’s assumption of control of the Shark C2 domains:\n“defenderstatus[.]com” and “zonestatistic[.]com”\n\nQueries for a DGA generated by the Milan backdoor yielded the same kind of telemetry as\nseen for the Shark DGA-generated DNS requests. As with Shark, most of them were short\nduration beacons egressing from cloud or IP spaces related to security vendors. The lack of\nuse of the DGA DNS tunneling in the observed Lyceum C2 telemetry could indicate that the\nDNS tunnelling is only used during the first phase of the compromise, but then retired in\npreference of HTTP(S) as Lyceum becomes well established in the victim network.\n\nWhen the ACTI/PACT team queried the Prevailion dataset for the previously referenced\nknown hardcoded URL paths contact.aspx, Default.aspx, preview.aspx, and team.aspx\nobserved in Milan samples, the researchers observed continued beaconing from an IP\naddress that resolved to a telecommunications operator in Morocco.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 6: Prevailion Telemetry Indicating Backdoor Activity Egressing from MilanRAT_\n_Backdoor Victims_\n\nIt is unknown if the Milan backdoor beacons are coming from a customer of the Moroccan\ntelecommunication operator or from internal systems within the operator. However, since\n[Lyceum has historically targeted telecommunication providers and the Kaspersky team](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kayal-etal.pdf)\nidentified recent targeting of telecommunication operators in Tunisia, it would follow that\nLyceum is targeting other north African telecommunication companies. The ACTI/PACT\nresearch team therefore assess that the observed Milan activity is likely emanating directly\nfrom within the Moroccan telecommunications operator.\n\nDuring late October 2021 the ACTI/PACT team identified beaconing from a reconfigured or\npossibly a new Lyceum backdoor. The observed beacons looked like the following:\n\n_Image 7: Observed Beaconing from a Reconfigured or New Lyceum Backdoor_\n\nThe observed beacons were seen egressing from a telecommunications company in Tunisia\nas well as an MFA in Africa. The URL syntax of the newly reconfigured backdoor are\nsomewhat similar to those generated in the newer version of Milan.\n```\nhttps://akastatus[.]com/?id=iCIG4FOfzf&formid=M2M3M2MzNTk%3d111111iT\nhttps://securednsservice[.]net/?\nproto=6&index=MjJkYzEwZWY5NTY5NDk3ZDg2YTljNDYzNWQxYTc0YTM%3D&name=\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe URL syntax is configurable within the Milan backdoor and ACTI/PACT assesses it as\nlikely that the Lyceum operators reconfigured the URL syntax used by Milan to circumvent\nIDS or IPS that were encoded to detect previous the Milan beacon syntax. The new\nbackdoor syntax is matched by the following regular expression:\n```\n//?(proto|kind|pt)=[0-9]{1}&(index|pi|serv)=/\n\n```\nHowever, as it is configurable it may only be useful to create ad-hoc network detection rules.\n\n[ACTI provides actionable and relevant threat intelligence to support decision makers.
