    "plain_text": "# Big Game Hunting: Now in Russia\n\n**group-ib.com/blog/oldgremlin**\n\nTop Russian companies and banks under attack from OldGremlin - a group controlling\nTinyCryptor ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nRustam Mirkasymov\n\nHead of Dynamic Malware Analysis Department at Group-IB\n\n\n-----\n\nOleg Skulkin\n\nSenior Digital Forensics Analyst at Group-IB\n\nThe email raised no suspicions. An employee of a Russian medical company boldly clicked\non the link and downloaded the attached ZIP archive. The message with the subject \"Bill\ndue\" looked like it had been sent by the Finance Department of a large Russian media\nholding, the RBC Group. After the executable file was run for just twenty seconds, Windows\nDefender detected and deleted the malware. Yet these twenty seconds were enough for the\nTrojan to achieve persistence in the infected system. The victim failed to notice anything.\nThree weeks later, the company's employees arrived at work and were greeted by an\nalarming message on their computer screens: \"Your files have been encrypted\". All work\nstopped. The attackers demanded $50,000 in cryptocurrency to decrypt the files. A new\ncybercriminal group called OldGremlin was behind that attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence team recently tracked a successful attack conducted on a\nRussian medical company by OldGremlin, a new criminal group. The threat actor encrypted\nthe company's entire corporate network and demanded a $50,000 ransom. It is common\nknowledge that Russian hackers have an unspoken rule about not working within Russia and\npost-Soviet countries. Yet OldGremlin, made up of Russian speakers, is actively attacking\nRussian companies: banks, industrial enterprises, medical organizations, software\ndevelopers… According to Group-IB expert estimations, since the spring OldGremlin has\nconducted at least seven phishing campaigns. The hackers have impersonated the selfregulatory organization Mikrofinansirovaniye i Razvitiye (SRO MiR); a Russian metallurgical\nholding company; the Belarusian plant Minsk Tractor Works; a dental clinic; and the media\nholding company RBC.\n\n**Here is your invoice**\n\nIn August 2020, Group-IB uncovered the details of the first successful attack conducted by\nOldGremlin. The victim was a large medical company with a network of regional branches.\nThe initial compromise vector was a phishing email allegedly sent by the media holding\ncompany RBC.\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence analysts established that, at the initial stage, the threat actors\nused a unique custom malware called TinyNode ⎯ a backdoor that downloads and launches\nadditional malware. After gaining remote access to the victim's computer, the cybercriminals\ncould easily perform network reconnaissance, collect valuable data, and propagate across\nthe organization's network. Like many other groups, OldGremlin used the Cobalt Strike\nframework to ensure that any post-exploitation activity was as effective as possible.\n\nAfter the attackers conducted reconnaissance and made sure that they were in the domain\nthat interested them, they continued to move laterally across the network, eventually\nobtaining domain administrator credentials. They even created an additional account with the\nsame privileges in case the main one was blocked.\n\nIn this particular case, backing up did not save the victim. A few weeks after the attack\nbegan, the cybercriminals wiped the organization's backups. In just a few hours on weekend,\nthey spread their ransomware TinyCryptor across hundreds of computers on the corporate\nnetwork .\n\nWhen the employees arrived at work the next day, they were greeted by an alarming\nmessage on their computer screens: \"Your files are encrypted. To decrypt them, contact us\nat...\" The phrase was followed by a mailbox hosted on ProtonMail. Interestingly, the criminals\ncreate a new email address for each new campaign. As a result of the attack, the company's\nregional branches were paralyzed and unable to operate. The attackers demanded 50,000\ndollars in cryptocurrency for decryption.\n\n\n-----\n\n_OldGremlin is the only Russian-speaking ransomware operator that violates the unspoken_\n_rule about not working within Russia and post-Soviet countries. They carry out multistage_\n_targeted attacks on Russian companies and banks using sophisticated tactics and_\n_techniques similar to those employed by APT groups. As with similar groups that target_\n_foreign entities, OldGremlin can be classed as part of Big Game Hunting, which brings_\n_together ransomware operators targeting large corporate networks.\"_\n\n**Oleg Skulkin**\n\nSenior Digital Forensics Analyst at Group-IB\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence experts first detected OldGremlin's attack between late March\nand early April 2020. The criminals took advantage of COVID-19 and sent financial\ninstitutions fake recommendations on how to organize a safe working environment during a\npandemic, impersonating the self-regulatory organization Mikrofinansirovaniye i Razvitiye\n(SRO MiR). It was the first time that the threat actors used TinyPosh, a custom Trojan they\ndeveloped themselves. The second attack occurred on April 24. The scheme was more or\nless the same, but this time the hackers impersonated Novadent, a dental clinic.\n\nTwo weeks later, Old Gremlin changed tactics. They prepared a fake email allegedly sent by\na Russian RBC journalist who invited recipients to take part in the \"Nationwide survey of the\nbanking and financial sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.\" Unlike with emails used in\nearlier incidents, the message from the \"RBC reporter\" was meticulously drafted in correct\nRussian and accurately imitated the media holding's style.\n\nThe \"journalist\" offered the potential victim (a bank employee) a 30-minute interview and\npromised to schedule the meeting through Calendly. For the attack, the hackers created a\ncalendar using this software, in which they made an appointment for the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe criminals then sent the victim a second email in which the journalist explained that she\nhad \"uploaded the questions to the cloud\" and was awaiting answers. The email was\ndesigned to spark the victim's interest and encourage them to click on the link. To make the\nemail look more convincing, each message contained the name of a major foreign\ncybersecurity vendor that had allegedly verified it.\n\nAs in the first campaigns, opening the link in the email resulted in the TinyPosh Trojan being\ndownloaded to the victim's computer. The malware achieved persistence in the system,\nobtained privileges of the account from which the Trojan was launched, and could download\nand launch the Cobalt Strike Beacon upon command. To hide the real C&C address, the\nhackers used the Cloudflare Workers server.\n\nAfter a short \"vacation\", the group resumed its activity. On August 13 and 14, 2020, CERTGIB (Group-IB's Computer Emergency Response Team) tracked two large-scale malicious\ncampaigns as part of which the hackers impersonated RBC (Russian media holding\ncompany) and a mining and metallurgical company. Within two days, the criminals sent\naround 250 malicious emails targeting Russian companies in the financial and industrial\nsectors. Unlike the case with the \"journalist\" (the name used was the same as an actual RBC\nreporter's), the senders impersonated non-existent employees.\n\nWithin a few days, the cybercriminals edited the decoy email to take advantage of the key\ntopic in Russian-language media: the protests in Belarus. On the morning of August 19,\nCERT-GIB team detected malicious campaigns targeting Russian financial organizations.\nThe emails were allegedly from Minsk Tractor Works (MTZ). In total, more than 50 malicious\nemails were identified and blocked by Group-IB Threat Detection System (TDS).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email s sender was Alesya Vladimirovna (or A.V. Volokhina in some cases), allegedly\nMTZ's CEO, although the company is in fact headed by a different person: Vitaly Vovk. The\ncybercriminals used the protests and strikes in Belarus as a theme for their emails:\n\"Unfortunately, about a week ago the prosecutor's office inspected MTZ. It is clear that this\nhappened because of a strike we organized to protest against Lukashenko.\" Further down,\nthe recipients were asked to follow a link, download an archive, and send the missing\ndocuments for verification. In fact, CERT-GIB analysts established that after victims opened\nthe attachment, the TinyPosh backdoor was downloaded and installed on their computer.\nOldGremlin adopted creative approach to their spearphishing emails. On August 19, GroupIB Threat Detection System (TDS) detected and blocked emails, containing links to malicious\nZIP-files. These well-crafted emails exploited current news as a lure. The cybercriminals also\nused public URL shortening service (e.g. bit.ly) to mask the links to malicious files.\nOldGremlin's campaigns were successfully detected and their emails were blocked at the\ncompanies equipped with Group-IB TDS.\n\n_Malware Detonation Platform TDS Polygon is designed to conduct behavior analysis of files_\n_extracted from emails, network traffic, file storage systems, personal computers, and_\n_automated systems, as well as manually uploaded files and those extracted through API_\n_integration._\n\n_\"The lack of a strong channel of communication between organizations that counter_\n_cybercrime and the context of political instability have led to the emergence of new criminal_\n_groups who think that they can get away with their crimes. Another factor that help_\n_cybercriminals make money on ransoms include businesses underestimating threats and the_\n_lack of security controls that identify and block ransomware on time.\"_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Rustam Mirkasymov,**\n\nHead of Dynamic Malware Analysis Department at Group-IB\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\n**MD5:**\n\ne47a296bac49284371ac396a053a8488\n\n2c6a9a38ace198ab62e50ab69920bf42\n\n306978669ead832f1355468574df1680\n\n94293275fcc53ad5aca5392f3a5ff87b\n\n1e54c8bc19dab21e4bd9cfb01a4f5aa5\n\nfc30e902d1098b7efd85bd2651b2293f\n\ne0fe009b0b1ae72ba7a5d2127285d086\n\nf30e4d741018ef81da580ed971048707\n\nac27db95366f4e7a7cf77f2988e119c2\n\n30fdbf2335a9565186689c12090ea2cf\n\ne1692cc732f52450879a86cb7dcfbccd\n\n**Registry paths:**\n\nHKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\Registered\n\nHKCU:\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Security\n\n**IPs and Domains:**\n\n\n-----\n\n136.244.67[.]59\n\n95.179.252[.]217\n\n45.61.138[.]170\n\n5.181.156[.]84\n\nrbcholding[.]press\n\nbroken-poetry-de86.nscimupf.workers[.]dev\n\ncalm-night-6067.bhrcaoqf.workers[.]dev\n\nrough-grass-45e9.poecdjusb.workers[.]dev'\n\nksdkpwprtyvbxdobr0.tyvbxdobr0.workers[.]dev')\n\nksdkpwpfrtyvbxdobr1.tiyvbxdobr1.workers[.]dev\n\nwispy-surf-fabd.bhrcaoqf.workers[.]dev\n\nnoisy-cell-7d07.poecdjusb.workers[.]dev\n\nwispy-fire-1da3.nscimupf.workers[.]dev\n\nhello.tyvbxdobr0.workers[.]dev\n\ncurly-sound-d93e.ygrhxogxiogc.workers[.]dev\n\nold-mud-23cb.tkbizulvc.workers[.]dev\n\nIn most cases, access to data found on a ransomware-infected device cannot be restored\nwithout decryption keys, which attackers hold for ransom.
