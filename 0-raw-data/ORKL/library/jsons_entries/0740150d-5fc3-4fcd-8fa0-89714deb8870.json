First discovered by GData\n[security researcher Karsten Hahn, this ransomware is currently in development and is most](https://twitter.com/struppigel)\nlikely not being actively distributed at this time.\n\n**Select Your Survey Screen**\n\nWhen the malware is started it will display a Select Your Survey form as shown above that\ncontains numerous surveys you can select in order to unlock the computer. The ransomware\nretrieves these surveys from the URL www.fileice.net/download.php?t=regular&file=3lhzu as\nshown in the source code below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Source showing the form retrieving the Surveys**\n\nWhen a user completes a survey, it will download a file called ThxForYurTyme.txt, which\ndisplays the message \"Thank you for supporting me.\".\n\n**Thank You File**\n\nMy guess is that this file will eventually contain a code that will be used to unlock and remove\nthe lock screen.\n\n## Not all features are functional\n\nSince this ransomware is currently in development mode, it contains source code to perform\na variety of functions that do not work as of yet. For example, though it does create an\nautostart so the programs starts when you login, it also contains numerous other features\nthat do not work right. For example, it contains code to disable Ctrl+Alt+Del and code to set\na variety of Windows policies to make it more difficult to remove, but they failed to be\ncreated on my test.\n\nThe policies that it attempts to enable are:\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System \"DisableTaskMgr\" = 1\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\"DisableLockWorkstation\" = 1\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\"DisableChangePassword\" = 1\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer \"NoClose\" = 1\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer \"NoLogoff\" = 1\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\"HideFastUserSwitching\" = 1\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWhat makes it truly show that it is still in development is the Unlock Your PC screen. This\nscreen contains numerous debugging options that can be used to test the ransomware.\n\n**Unlock Your PC Screen**\n\nFor example, the startup button will enable the autostart entry for the ransomware,\nthe Close button will terminate the process, the Clear Ctrl Alt checkbox will enable or\ndisable the policies, and the Disable keys button will attempt to hook the keyboard so that\nthe keys do not work.\n\nLike many other ransomware infections that are discovered, there is a good chance that this\nransomware will never make it into distribution. If it does, though, it will be easily defeated.\n\n### Files associated with the Survey Ransomware:\n```\nC:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\ThxForYurTyme.txt\nC:\\seo\\Sdchost.exe\n\n Registry entries associated with the Survey Ransomware\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Sdchost C:\\seo\\Sdchost.exe\n\n Network traffic associated with the Survey Ransomware\nhttp://www.fileice.net/download.php?t=regular&file=3lhzu\n\n Hashes:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA256: 60fba97585c3a48720bffdb1e11fb5be537e6b6344220015bc9740d084f58c0b\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n```\n[Indian airline SpiceJet's flights impacted by ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/indian-airline-spicejets-flights-impacted-by-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
