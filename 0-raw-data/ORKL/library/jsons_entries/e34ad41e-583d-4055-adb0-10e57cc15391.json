This is quite a complex\nconstruction and each of the underlying elements is also available separately in our API.\nCertain types of changes take on a higher weighting than others when constructing the final\nrisk score.\n\nName Server Density- This is simply the number of domains we see hosted on this\nnameserver. The nameserver density can be an important factor in tracking particular types\nof campaigns. Some examples of that are mentioned in this post about single domain name\nservers towards the end of the page.\n\nName Server Reputation(listed domains in last 30 days/number of domains on name\nserver) This is a characteristic of recent known malicious activity on a given Name-Server\nrelative to the number of domains on the Name-Server.\n\nIP Reputation can be divided into contributing factors of:\n\nAS Rank- various forms of this have been available over the years in OSINT this is\njust our own variant\n\nto rank the AS numbers by malicious activity.\n\nAS Reputation- simple calculation of recent malicious activity relative to size of the\nIP block\n\nAS Takedown Reputation- a complex algorithm to give an impression of how long\nmalicious items\n\nsurvive in an IP block\n\n\n-----\n\nAS Assignment Age- how long this IP has been assigned to this AS Number\n\nAS Size- how many IP addresses in this block\n\nSubnet Reputation- also number of malicious times associated with the IP subnet in\nrecent time.\n\nIP Density (Number of A records we see on that IP address)\n\nIP History- (Number of listings associated with that IP address in x days)\n\nMX Density\n\nNumber of SSL Certs on an IP\n\nNumber of reuses of each SSL Cert\n\nNumber of WHOIS changes\n\nThese can be combined in different ways to conduct research. There are also a number of\nstarting points for this. For example if you look in the threat feeds available and pick a\nworrying indicator that is relevant to your organization, then build a profile based on the\nabove characteristics plus the more regular characteristics also included in the data. You\ncan then conduct a search over our non-threat data to see what matches come up that\nmaybe should be added to a cluster and further investigated or blocked by network\ndefenders.\n\nIP Diversity\n\nThe number of A records associated with a domain over time and how they rotate through\nthem is trace evidence of attacker process. It can also help distinguish quickly through\ndifferent types of Content Delivery Networks.\n\nName\n*\nThank you!\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
