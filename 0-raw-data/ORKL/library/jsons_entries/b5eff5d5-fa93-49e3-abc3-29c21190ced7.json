    "plain_text": "# DiamondFox modular malware – a one-stop shop\n\n**[blog.checkpoint.com/2017/05/10/diamondfox-modular-malware-one-stop-shop/](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/05/10/diamondfox-modular-malware-one-stop-shop/)**\n\nMay 10, 2017\n\nCheck Point researchers have conducted a thorough investigation of the DiamondFox\nmalware-as-a-service in collaboration with Terbium Labs, a Dark Web Data Intelligence\ncompany. The report includes a review of the malware’s sales procedure and customer\nreviews, as well as a full technical analysis of its multiple plugins. For the full DiamondFox\nreport [click here.](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DiamondFox_Report_170510-2.pdf)\n\nCheck Point Threat Intelligence teams constantly track the latest attack trends, campaigns\nand attack methods to maintain an up-to-date and accurate view of the cyber threat\nlandscape.\n\nIn recent years, an effective new business method has penetrated the thriving malware and\nattack tools market and led to the establishment of an entire industry – malware-as-aservice. This provides unskilled threat actors an easy entrance to the cyberattack world,\nand enables each user to start their own attack campaign without any technical knowledge.\nDrive-by attack methods, ransomware, banking Trojans and a variety of attack tools are\nnow traded in underground forums and use a wide range of payment methods.\n\nDiamondFox, a modular botnet offered for sale on various underground forums, is an\noutstanding demonstration of the many advantages of this business module. By purchasing\na single product, the buyer is granted access to a variety of capabilities, in the form of\nplugins, and can plan and execute multiple campaigns: a tailored espionage campaign, a\ncredentials theft campaign, which can be the basis of an extensive monetary theft\noperation, and even a simple, yet highly effective distributed denial of service (DDoS)\nattack.\n\n\n-----\n\nTogether with Terbium Labs, a Dark Web Data Intelligence company, we reviewed the\nDiamondFox malware’s capabilities, sales procedure and user experience. This report also\nincludes a full technical analysis of the malware’s functionality, network communications\nand multiple plugins.\n\n**Malware ecosystem**\n\nLooking at the full list of capabilities of the latest version of DiamondFox, the Crystal\nversion, this highly modular malware seems to cover everything from keylogging and\nbrowser password stealing, all the way to a variety of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)\nattack techniques through crypto currency wallet stealing. DiamondFox, one of the trendiest\nmalware-as-a-service up for sale these days, is in fact a one-stop-shop: upon purchasing\nthe malware for a certain period, a selection of plugins becomes accessible. All that’s left for\nthe buyer to do is to choose which one to activate for each victim and when.\n\n_DiamondFox advertisement, dated April 2016_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ad displayed above, which presents the latest version of DiamondFox, includes a\ndetailed explanation about the malware loader, the user panel and the actual core of\nDiamondFox – the plugins.\n\nIt also includes a carefully updated Changelog, which provides the potential buyers a\ndetailed explanation about the improvements and features added to each of the versions.\n\n[At this point, after examining the highly successful Cerber Ransomware-as-a-service and](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/08/16/cerberring/)\n[the user-friendly Sundown Exploit Kit, there is no need to elaborate about the management](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/04/13/unbearable-lightness-operating-web-based-attacks-easy-steal-money-ie-8-0-11-0-users/)\npanel granted to each user who purchases the malware. It goes without saying that the\nDiamondFox user panel is comprehensive and secured, and provides users real-time\ninfection statistics as well as control over the activation of the plugins. Moreover, most of the\nDiamondFox advertisements guarantee free updates and support.\n\n_DiamondFox user panel screenshots_\n\n\n-----\n\n_DiamondFox user panel screenshots, single victim view_\n\nSo far, the DiamondFox botnet seems like the perfect solution for any actor seeking an easy\nway to initiate their own campaigns. DiamondFox offers a range of plugins, which provide\nthe user several data theft possibilities, and the ability to self-spread via removable devices\nand social networks. DiamondFox can definitely be used as the basis of a monetary theft\noperation, or a tailored espionage campaign. Furthermore, it appears that the official\nmalware vendor, an actor dubbed ‘Edbitss’, is truly invested in the improvement of the\nmalware, as all updates, changes and fixes are carefully documented and shared with the\npotential buyers. Edbitss is clearly very responsive in all of the observed threads. Several\ncustomer reviews validate this impression and describe a quality, fully functioning product:\n\n_DiamondFox customer review_\n\nHowever, other reviews tell an entirely different story:\n\n\n-----\n\n_DiamondFox customer review_\n\nWe can’t help but wonder which side is telling the truth.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Edbitss is the official DiamondFox vendor, based on evidence\nfrom the ads referred to in this report. The actor uses the same Jabber address in all of the\n[observed ads, both on the clear web and on the Darknet: [email protected]. However,](http://blog.checkpoint.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\ndifferent contact details were observed throughout the various ads, each using a top level\ndomain linking the actor to another country. The actor claims to be located in Russia and\nappears to be fluent in Russian. However during the investigation, we came across a clear\nweb landing page established by the actor in March 2016, on the domain ‘blogspot.mx’, the\nMexican website of the highly popular blog-publishing service. From this, there is a high\npossibility the actor could live in Mexico.\n\n**Check Point customers are protected from DiamondFox by the following security**\n**technologies:**\n\nThe Antivirus Software Blade blocks every currently known variant of DiamondFox.\nThe Anti-Bot Software Blade detects and blocks any attempt to communicate with\nDiamondFox’s C&C addresses.\n[Indicators of Compromise are provided in the DiamondFox report and the](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DiamondFox_Report_170510-3.pdf) detailed\nAppendices.\n\n\n-----",
