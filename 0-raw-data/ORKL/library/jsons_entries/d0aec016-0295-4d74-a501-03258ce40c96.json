As we stated in that post, our research into this threat was,\n\nand is, ongoing. In the wake of that post, we have had a number of partners step forward with\n\nadditional information that has assisted us in our work. This post is an update of our findings over\n\nthe past week.\n\nFirst, we have determined that additional devices are being targeted by this actor, including some\n\nfrom vendors that are new to the target list. These new vendors are ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti,\n\nUPVEL, and ZTE. New devices were also discovered from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Link.\n\nOur research currently shows that no Cisco network devices are affected. We've provided an\n\nupdated device list below.\n\nWe have also discovered a new stage 3 module that injects malicious content into web traffic as it\n\npasses through a network device. At the time of our initial posting, we did not have all of the\n\ninformation regarding the suspected stage 3 modules. The new module allows the actor to deliver\n\nexploits to endpoints via a man-in-the-middle capability (e.g. they can intercept network traffic and\n\ninject malicious code into it without the user's knowledge). With this new finding, we can confirm\n\nthat the threat goes beyond what the actor could do on the network device itself, and extends the\n\nthreat into the networks that a compromised network device supports. We provide technical details\n\non this module, named \"ssler\" below.\n\nAdditionally, we've discovered an additional stage 3 module that provides any stage 2 module that\n\nlacks the kill command the capability to disable the device. When executed, this module specifically\n\nremoves traces of the VPNFilter malware from the device and then renders the device unusable.\n\nAnalysis of this module, called \"dstr,\" is also provided below.\n\nFinally, we've conducted further research into the stage 3 packet sniffer, including in-depth analysis\n\nof how it looks for Modbus traffic.\n\n\n\n[► 2 01 7](javascript:void(0)) (172)\n\n[► 2 01 6](javascript:void(0)) (98)\n\n[► 2 01 5](javascript:void(0)) (62)\n\n[► 2 01 4](javascript:void(0)) (67)\n\n[► 2 01 3](javascript:void(0)) (30)\n\n[► 2 01 2](javascript:void(0)) (53)\n\n[► 2 01 1](javascript:void(0)) (23)\n\n[► 2 01 0](javascript:void(0)) (93)\n\n[► 2 009](javascript:void(0)) (146)\n\n[► 2 008](javascript:void(0)) (37)\n\n**R E C OM M E N DE D B LOG S**\n\n[C I S C O BL O G](https://blogs.cisco.com)\n\nTop 7 Multicloud Initiatives – Delivering\non the Multicloud Promise\n\n[C L A M A V® BL O G](http://blog.clamav.net/)\n\n[ClamAV 0.100.0 has been released!](https://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Clamav/~3/takVpuywnTk/clamav-01000-has-been-released.html)\n\n[S N O RT BL O G](http://blog.snort.org/)\n\nSnort Subscriber Rule Set Update for\n01/16/2018\n\n\n-----\n\n'ssler' (Endpoint exploitation module — JavaScript injection)\n\nThe ssler module, which we pronounce as \"Esler,\" provides data exfiltration and JavaScript injection\n\ncapabilities by intercepting all traffic passing through the device destined for port 80. This module is\n\nexpected to be executed with a parameter list, which determines the module's behavior and which\n\nwebsites should be targeted. The first positional parameter controls the folder on the device where\n\nstolen data should be stored. The purpose of the other named parameters are as follows:\n\ndst: — Used by the iptables rules created to specify a destination IP address or CIDR\nrange that the rule should apply to.\n\nsrc: — Used by the iptables rules created to specify a source IP address or CIDR range\nthat the rule should apply to.\n\ndump: — Any domain passed in a dump parameter will have all of its HTTP headers\nrecorded in the reps_*.bin file.\n\nsite: — When a domain is provided in the \"site\" parameter, this domain will have its web\npages targeted for JavaScript injection.\n\nhook: — This parameter determines the URL of the JavaScript file for injection.\n\nThe first action taken by the ssler module is to configure the device's iptables to redirect all traffic\n\ndestined for port 80 to its local service listening on port 8888. It starts by using the insmod\n\ncommand to insert three iptables modules into the kernel (ip_tables.ko, iptable_filter.ko,\n\niptable_nat.ko) and then executes the following shell commands:\n\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8888 -j ACCEPT\n\niptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8888\n\nExample: ./ssler logs src:192.168.201.0/24 dst:10.0.0.0/16\n\n\n-----\n\napproximately every four minutes.\n\nAny outgoing web requests on port 80 are now intercepted by ssler and can be inspected and\n\nmanipulated before being sent to the legitimate HTTP service. All HTTP requests are sslstripped.\n\nThat is, the following changes are made to requests before being sent to the true HTTP server:\n\nAny instances of the string https:// are replaced with http://, converting requests for\nsecure HTTP resources to requests for insecure ones so sensitive data such as\ncredentials can be extracted from them.\n\nIf the request contains the header Connection: keep-alive, it is replaced with Connection:\nclose\n\nIf the request contains the header Accept-Encoding with the gzip value, this is converted\nto Accept-Encoding: plaintext/none so no responses will be compressed with gzip\n(exceptions are made for certain file types, such as images).\n\nIf the host is in one of the dump: parameters, the details of the request are saved to the disk for\n\nexfiltration, including the URL, port and all of the request headers. If the host is not in a dump:\n\nparameter, it will only dump requests with an Authorization header or URLs that have credentials in\n\nthem. URLs are determined to have credentials if they contain either the string assword= or ass=\n\nand one of the following strings in them:\n\nsername=\n\nser=\n\name=\n\nogin=\n\nail=\n\nhone=\n\n\n-----\n\nAny POST requests to accounts.google.com containing the string signin will also be dumped.\n\nAfter these modifications are made, a connection to the true HTTP server is made by ssler using\n\nthe modified request data over port 80. Ssler receives the response from the HTTP server and\n\nmakes the following changes to the response before passing it on to the victim:\n\nA response with an https:// in its Location header value is converted to http://\n\nThe following headers are ignored, i.e. not sent to the client:\n\nAlt-Scv\n\nVary\n\nContent-MD5\n\ncontent-security-policy\n\nX-FB-Debug\n\npublic-key-pins-report-only\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin\n\nThe entire response is sslstripped — that is, all instances of https:// with \\x20http://.\n\nIf parameter site: is provided a domain (or part of a domain, e.g. \"google\"), it will attempt\nto inject JavaScript into all Content-Type: text/html or Content-Type: text/javascript\nresponses. The requirement is that the string <meta name= … > be present and long\nenough to fit the string from the hook: parameter. The <meta name= … > tag will be\nreplaced with <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"[hook value]\">. The victim IP combined\nwith the site is then added to an internal whitelist in ssler and will not be targeted for\ninjection again until the whitelist is cleared (which occurs every four days).\n\nEach domain that is sslstripped in the responses (e.g. domains found in links) is then added to a list\n\nof stripped domains. Subsequent requests that are intercepted by the ssler module to domains in\n\nthis list will occur via HTTPS over port 443, instead of HTTP over port 80. By default, four domains\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dstr modules are used to render an infected device inoperable by deleting files necessary for\n\nnormal operation. It deletes all files and folders related to its own operation first before deleting the\n\nrest of the files on the system, possibly in an attempt to hide its presence during a forensic\n\nanalysis.\n\nThe x86 version of the dstr module was analyzed in-depth. This module first deleted itself from the\n\ndisk and then stops the execution of the parent Stage 2 process. It will then search all running\n\nprocess for ones named vpnfilter, security, and tor and terminate them. Next, it explicitly deletes the\n\nfollowing files and directories:\n\n/var/tmp/client_ca.crt\n\n/var/tmp/client.key\n\n/var/tmp/client.crt\n\n/var/run/vpnfilterm/htpx\n\n/var/run/vpnfilter\n\n/var/run/vpn.tmp\n\n/var/run/vpn.pid\n\n/var/run/torrc\n\n/var/run/tord/hidden_ssh/private_key\n\n/var/run/tord/hidden_ssh/hostname\n\n/var/run/tor\n\n/var/run/msvf.pid\n\n/var/run/client_ca.crt\n\n/var/run/client.key\n\n/var/run/client.crt\n\n/var/pckg/mikrotik.o\n\n/var/pckg/.mikrotik.\n\n\n-----\n\n/var/client.crt\n\n/tmp/client_ca.crt\n\n/tmp/client.key\n\n/tmp/client.crt\n\n/flash/nova/etc/loader/init.x3\n\n/flash/nova/etc/init/security\n\n/flash/nova/etc/devel-login\n\n/flash/mikrotik.o\n\n/flash/.mikrotik.\n\n/var/run/vpnfilterw/\n\n/var/run/vpnfilterm/\n\n/var/run/tord/hidden_ssh/\n\n/var/run/tord/\n\n/flash/nova/etc/loader/\n\n/flash/nova/etc/init/\n\nThe dstr module clears flash memory by overwriting the bytes of all available /dev/mtdX devices\n\nwith a 0xFF byte. Finally, the shell command rm -rf /* is executed to delete the remainder of the file\n\nsystem and the device is rebooted. At this point, the device will not have any of the files it needs to\n\noperate and fail to boot.\n\nAdditional research on the third stage packet sniffer\n\n'ps' (stage 3 packet sniffer)\n\nOne of stage 3 packet sniffer module samples we have is the R600VPN MIPS-like (Lexra\n\narchitecture) sample. This sample is a packet sniffer that is looking for basic authentication as well\n\nas monitoring ICS traffic and is specific to the TP-LINK R600-VPN The malware uses a raw socket\n\n\n-----\n\ny, y, y g g q\n\nimplement functionality that could modify traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nPackets that are not on port 502, are scanned for BasicAuth, and that information is logged.\n\nElse: (non-Modbus traffic): sniffing HTTP basic auth credentials\n\nDestination IP Address == command line argument IP address\n\nSource port > 1024\n\nSource port != 8080\n\nSource port != 8088\n\nPacket Data length > 20 bytes\n\nPacket does not contain\n\n</ and >\n\n<?xml\n\nBasic Og==\n\n/tmUnblock.cgi\n\nPassword Required\n\n<div\n\n<form\n\n<input\n\nthis. and .get\n\n{\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n<DIV\n\nPacket contains 'Authorization: Basic' OR one user/pass combination\n\nUser\n\nUser=\n\nuser=\n\nName=\n\nname=\n\nUsr=\n\nusr=\n\nLogin=\n\nlogin=\n\nPass\n\nPass=\n\npass=\n\nPassword=\n\npassword=\n\nPasswd=\n\npasswd=\n\nLogging: Logs on IPs and ports, but not the packet contents on port 502. It does not\nvalidate the traffic as Modbus.\n\nModbus - Logs SourceIP, SourcePort, DestinationIP, DestinationPort and\nlabels it *modbus*\n\nAll Other - write full packet to log file if and only if it passes basic auth check\n\n\n-----\n\nthe malware's capability to support the exploitation of endpoint devices expands the scope of this\n\nthreat beyond the devices themselves, and into the networks those devices support. If successful,\n\nthe actor would be able to deploy any desired additional capability into the environment to support\n\ntheir goals, including rootkits, exfiltration capability and destructive malware.\n\nTalos would like to thank all of the individual researchers, companies and intelligence partners from\n\naround the world who have stepped forward to share information and address this threat. Your\n\nactions have helped us gain a greater understanding of this campaign, and in some cases, have\n\ndirectly improved the situation. We recognize this is a team sport, and truly appreciate your\n\nassistance.\n\nWe will continue to monitor VPNFilter and work with our partners to understand the threat as it\n\ncontinues to evolve in order to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is\n\ninformed.\n\n## Updated List of IOCs\n\nAs stated previously, we highly suspect that there are additional IOCs and versions of this malware\n\nthat we are not currently aware of.
