Now on YouTube\n\n\n-----\n\nYaroslav Kargalev\n\nDeputy Head of CERT-GIB Team\n\nDaniil Glukhov\n\nJunior Analyst, DRP Team\n\nA few years ago, the cryptocurrency world shook under an onslaught of scammers who\nwanted to cash in on the outage of the popular messenger Telegram. Within a few hours, 5\ncrypto wallets advertised through a fake Twitter account supposedly belonging to Pavel\n\n\n-----\n\n[Durov received 148.364636 ETH, which is equivalent to about $60,000 at the exchange rate](https://cointelegraph.com/news/one-millionaire-really-is-giving-away-bitcoin-but-is-that-a-good-thing)\non the reporting date.\n\nEverything happened very fast. Just hours after Telegram first started experiencing technical\nissues on March 29, 2018, two identical tweets posted by the scammers posing as the\nfounder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, appeared on a discussion thread in his official Twitter\naccount. The tweets referred to a special promotion as part of an \"apology campaign\" to\ncompensate users for the messenger's outage, thereby luring many of Durov's subscribers to\na fake account.\n\n[In a shockingly similar case, last March, a man in Britain lost half a million dollars. This time](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56402378)\nscammers impersonated Elon Musk posting in a thread in his official Twitter account.\n\nThese all are typical example of a scam called a Fake Crypto Giveaway. This is how it\nusually plays out: fake Twitter accounts supposedly belonging to celebrities (crypto\nenthusiasts in most cases) promise users to double their cryptocurrency payments sent to\nthe wallets, in reality controlled by the scammers. However, the platform keeps improving its\nmechanisms to better detect and block rogue schemes. It forces scammers to look for\nalternative ways to monetize their fraudulent operations.\n\nAs such, the scammers started using fake crypto-celebrity streams on YouTube. Similarly to\nthe examples featuring fake Pavel Durov and Elon Musk accounts, YouTube stream viewers\nare encouraged to transfer cryptocurrency to scammers' wallets, with a promise of receiving\ndouble the amount in return. All the streams promote a link to a fake website designed to\nshow visitors the mechanism behind a fake giveaway.\nThe scheme described in this research allowed crypto scammers to attract 165,000 viewers\nto their fake YouTube streams. The analysis of crypto wallets, controlled by the scammers,\nshowed that they walked away with more than $1,680,000, receiving 281 transactions within\nthree days of monitoring. Below we describe how it all happened…\n\n## The wrong Vitalik\n\n[Between February 16 and 18, 2022, Group-IB Digital Risk Protection (DRP) experts](https://www.group-ib.com/digital-risk-protection.html)\ndetected 36 fraudulent YouTube streams promising profitable cryptocurrency investments.\nThose were the videos of famous crypto enthusiasts cut from legitimate streams and edited\nto create the fake ones. In one case, in order to attract viewers to a fake giveaway and make\nthem believe that the stream was legitimate, fraudsters used a very well-known name in the\ncrypto world: Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tactic is not new, but apparently is still having a moment. Other famous names, that the\nscammers exploited as part of the latest wave, were Elon Musk, Brad Garlinghouse,\n**Michael J. Saylor, Changpeng Zhao, and Cathie Wood.**\n\nDuring fake YouTube streams, crypto celebrities discuss current cryptocurrency trading\nvolumes, show graphs indicating the growth of various metrics, and repeatedly refer to\nenormous profits. On average, such fake streams attracted between 3,000 and 18,000\nviewers. The victims are encouraged to visit a website that contains all the information\nrequired to make a transaction and that explains why a transfer should be made immediately.\n\nA stream featuring a fake footage of Vitalik Buterin attracted more than 165,000 viewers who\nwere promised that their crypto savings would be doubled in real time if they transferred\ntokens to a crypto wallet, which in reality was controlled by the fraudsters. Some of them\ncould be bots to make people believe that the stream was legitimate. But it is still quite a big\nnumber.\n\n\n-----\n\nYouTube channels that run thematic streams usually have names associated with the key\nspeaker of a specific stream. For example, if a stream features Vitalik Buterin, most likely the\nchannel name would include Ethereum. In order to attract traffic, fraudsters use popular tags\nand keywords related to crypto enthusiasts and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAll these channels have supposedly been either hacked or purchased on the underground\nmarket. It is more than likely that they once belonged to individuals who used them on a\nregular basis. This can be derived from the date that the channel was registered, from the\nvideos and playlists published on the channel that do not match the topic of the fraudulent\nstream, and from the large number of views. Some channels contain nothing but the\nfraudulent stream, however.\n\nMost streams lasted more than three hours, but some were cut off abruptly. Sometimes the\nchannel owner shut them down, while in other cases the channels were closed down for\nviolating terms and conditions of use. Once a stream goes down, it usually becomes\ninaccessible.\n\nHot and empty\n\nIn most cases, streams mainly discussed cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and\n**Ripple, while Cardano, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu trailed behind with fewer mentions. QR**\ncodes with links to crypto wallets were sometimes displayed over the stream.\n\nResearch into the fraudulent scheme revealed that addresses of crypto wallets mentioned on\nfake websites were sometimes changed or updated Several domain names often displayed\n\n\n-----\n\none and the same crypto wallet address. In total, Group-IB experts detected more than 30\ncrypto wallets used for the scheme, with a total remaining balance of $933,963. The most\npopular cryptocurrency used by fraudsters as part of the scheme is Ethereum.\nWithin three days of monitoring, (from February 16 to 18, 2022) all detected crypto wallets,\ncontrolled by the scammers, received 281 transactions in total, amounting to more than\n$1,680,000.\n\nWhen analyzing fraudulent websites promoted during the fake streams, Group-IB's\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB) detected an unusual technique.\nDepending on the cryptocurrency and type of crypto wallets, scammers asked visitors to their\nfake giveaway website to enter seed phrases to connect their wallets.\n\nScammers explained the request by a made-up promotion where participants who connected\ntheir wallets would receive an additional bonus and increased payout.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a victim shares their seed phrase, fraudsters gain control over their wallet and\n**withdraw all funds from it. The exact number of victims and total amount of stolen funds**\nremains unknown, but clearly some victims could not resist taking the bait.\n\n## Scammers' infrastructure\n\nWhile analyzing the streams that promoted the latest wave of fake giveaways promoted,\nCERT-GIB experts initially retrieved the links to 29 websites with guidelines on how to double\nthe investments. As a rule, 3 to 4 streams run simultaneously, and they all lead viewers to\nthe same domain. The domain names contain keywords from streams and names of crypto\nprojects.\n\nRegardless of the cryptocurrency used, all such websites were designed based on the same\npattern: scammer impersonate a well-known crypto enthusiast, project, or the entire crypto\nindustry, announce the giveaway conditions, and publish the following: short FAQs, the\naddress of a crypto wallet where participants are supposed to transfer their coins, and a\nsection with fake examples of successful giveaway transactions. Their goal is to make\nvisitors believe they can get rich.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the time, fraudsters use one-page template-based websites with an eye-catching\ndesign and high-quality crypto-themed images. The website design is the main factor that\nhelps fraudsters deceive visitors and make them transfer cryptocurrency to the designated\nwallets.\n\nA deeper analysis of the scammer's domain infrastructure revealed that those 29 websites\nwere part of a massive network of 583 interconnected resources all set up in the first quarter\nof 2022. Notably, there were three times as many domains registered for this scheme in less\nthan three months of 2022 compared to the whole of last year.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a snapshot of interconnected network nodes used as part of a single cryptocurrency\nscam campaign. It shows that separate web resources are connected based on various\nnetwork indicators.\n\nDespite that giveaway schemes have existed for a long time and are based on\nstraightforward deception techniques, they remain effective. The fact that they work could be\nrooted in an influx of inexperienced cryptocurrency users who have not encountered this kind\nof fraud yet, which are the kind of potential victims that fraudsters target the most.\n\n## And you can also buy NFTs…\n\nResearch into a fraud scheme involving cryptocurrency streams revealed another YouTuberelated scheme targeting NFT (Non-Fungible Token) investors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NFT scheme is based on the same pattern. Scammers use original footage with crypto\ngurus, such as Gary Vaynerchuk aka Gary V, who discuss purchasing NTF images whose\nprice could increase 10-fold over time. The stream description contains a link to a scam\nwebsite where visitors are promised one NFT in exchange for sharing the data of their crypto\nwallet (password and key, required to restore access to the account).\n\n## Identify and mitigate digital risks to your brand\n\nwith Group-IB Digital Risk Protection\n\nRequest Demo\n\n## Recommendations\n\nHow to protect your cryptocurrency assets and not fall victim to crypto scammers.\n\nVerify all information using official sources only\n\nFor example, go to the crypto project's official website. If you cannot find any information\nabout the promotion taking place, you are likely being deceived regardless of the actions that\nyou are being asked to take.\n\nDo not share your seed phrase with third parties\n\n\n-----\n\nSeed phrases must be kept secret and stored securely. To do so, use password\nmanagement tools. To minimize the risk of leakage, prioritize desktop solutions over cloudbased ones. Remember: the person who owns the seed phrase owns the wallet.\n\nKeep up with the latest news on relevant topics\n\nLearn from other people's experiences. Often, someone else will have already encountered a\nsimilar situation. Be especially vigilant about free giveaways. Do not share confidential data\non rogue websites. Become familiar with information security recommendations and follow\nthem.\n\n\n-----",
