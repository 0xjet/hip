Some of\nthe mobile devices were still sealed and were allegedly bought with their victims’ money,\nofficials said.\n\n[Desmantellem grup criminal especialitzat en l'#Smishing o l'estafa amb missatges](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Smishing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nSMS, amb els quals obtenien dades bancàries i del telèfon mòbil de les víctimes. Dos\n[dels integrants, que formaven la cúpula, ja són a presó pic.twitter.com/d2XiWa0rCP](https://t.co/d2XiWa0rCP)\n\n[— Mossos (@mossos) March 5, 2021](https://twitter.com/mossos/status/1367797770522943489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe suspects were arraigned in front of a judge on Thursday, March 4. Two members,\ndeemed the leaders of the gang, were detained, while the other two were set free but\nrequired to appear in court every 15 days.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuspect names were not released, according to local data privacy regulations; however,\nCatalan police said that one of the two FluBot gang leaders appeared to have been in charge\nof the technical side of the operation, being the one who wrote the malware code and\ncreated fake bank login pages.\n\n## 97% of FluBot’s victims were located in Spain\n\nThe [FluBot malware, also known as the](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/master/FluBot/FluBot.pdf) [Fedex Banker or](https://hispasec.com/resources/FedexBanker.pdf) [Cabassous, has been active since](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1346807891152560131)\nlate 2020. The malware was designed as a banking trojan for Android devices. It would infect\ndevices and abuse the Android Accessibility service to show fake login screens for mobile\nbanking portals.\n\nThe malware would collect banking credentials and send the data back to its command and\ncontrol server. Here, the FluBot gang would abuse the credentials and the full control they\nhad over victim devices to access bank accounts, intercept and bypass bank verification\ncodes, and steal funds from victims’ accounts.\n\n“In addition to making money transfers, the perpetrators made purchases of high-end cell\nphones with the victims’ cards, which were sent to people living in the province of Madrid, to\nwhom the scammers paid to receive the packages,” Mossos d’Esquadra also added on\nFriday.\n\nTo spread to new victims, the malware relied on sending SMS spam messages to an infected\nuser’s contacts list. Catalan officials said they tracked at least 71,000 spam SMS messages\nsent by the group.\n\nHowever, the number is believed to be much larger. In a report last week, Swiss security firm\nPRODAFT said that after managing to gain access to FluBot’s command and control server,\nthey tracked the malware to 60,000 devices and discovered that the FluBot operators had\ncollected phone numbers for 11 million users, 97% of which were Spanish citizens.\n\nThe number represented around 25% of Spain’s population. In an interview last week,\nPRODAFT told The Record their discovery prompted them to report their findings to Spanish\nlaw enforcement, which would explain last week’s crackdown against the FluBot gang.\n\nIn the meantime, security researchers reported that the malware appears to be still active\nand spreading. The malware is advertised in underground hacking forums and its creators\nare believed to be still at large.\n\n[Looks like it isn't dead after all.
