CDN servers,” said Darksupp, the operator of the Darkside ransomware, in\n[a post spotted by Recorded Future threat intelligence analyst Dmitry Smilyanets.](https://twitter.com/ddd1ms)\n\n“Now these servers are unavailable via SSH, and the hosting panels are blocked,” said the\nDarkside operator while also complaining that the web hosting provider refused to cooperate.\n\nIn addition, the Darkside operator also reported that cryptocurrency funds were also\nwithdrawn from the gang’s payment server, which was hosting ransom payments made by\nvictims.\n\nThe funds, which the Darkside gang was supposed to split between itself and its affiliates\n(the threat actors who breach networks and deploy the ransomware), were transferred to an\nunknown wallet, Darksupp said.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Takedown?\n\nThis sudden development comes after US authorities announced their intention to go after\nthe gang.\n\nIn two conferences this week, on Monday and Thursday, US President Biden himself came\nout and said the US would go after the group after one of its attacks crippled a major fuel\ntransport pipeline that impacted half of the US East Coast, leading the US to declare a state\nof national emergency in order to ensure gasoline was delivered to impacted regions.\n\n“We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible\ncountries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,” President Biden said\nin a press conference on Thursday.\n\n“We are also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate,” he added [see\n_video below]._\n\nPres. Biden on Colonial Pipeline hack: \"We do not believe the Russian government\nwas involved in this attack—but we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals\n[who did the attack are living in Russia.\" https://t.co/CAHmsNFmcf](https://t.co/CAHmsNFmcf)\n[pic.twitter.com/ex8AfuwIPX](https://t.co/ex8AfuwIPX)\n\n[— ABC News (@ABC) May 13, 2021](https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1392882802941702149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nPresident Biden’s statement also came after Bill Evanina, former Director of the US National\nCounterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), also said last week that the US intelligence\ncommunity was very likely respond to respond to the brazen Colonial attack in a disruptive\nmanner.\n\nDarkside attribution is a good move by the FBI. I fully expect Darkside to shortly\nexperience the full extent of IC and DoD precision tactical deterrent capabilities.\n[https://t.co/YsHFi0h2TY](https://t.co/YsHFi0h2TY)\n\n[— William Evanina (@BillEvanina) May 10, 2021](https://twitter.com/BillEvanina/status/1391843860209446921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Or exit scam?\n\nBut Smilyanets warns that the group’s announcement could also be a ruse, as no\nannouncement has yet been made by US officials.\n\nThe group could be taking advantage of President Biden’s statements as cover to shut down\nits infrastructure and run away with its affiliate’s money without paying their cuts—a tactic\nknown as an “exit scam” on the cybercriminal underground.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to [#REvil](https://twitter.com/hashtag/REvil?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#ransomware operator Unknown (possible false flag), #DarkSide –](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nNo More.
