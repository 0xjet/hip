In this attack, the attackers are using “Army Welfare Education Society” Scholarship form as\nlure.\n\n**About AWES:**\n\nArmy Welfare Education Society (AWES) manages and ensures proper education facilities to children of Indian Army\npersonnel through Local Military Authorities. Established in 1983, the society has its office at Shankar Vihar, Delhi\nCantonment and over the years has opened over 137 Army Public Schools and 249 Army Pre-Primary Schools\nacross India.\n\n**Details about the recent attack:**\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n\n“ESSA-Scholarships.docx”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.1 Template_\n\n_Fig.2 ESSA-Scholarships.docx_\n\n[The “ESSA-Scholarships.docx” triggers CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability which later launches the stage of “.dotm” file](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/new-spear-phishing-campaign-using-army-welfare-education-societys-scholarship-form/text=Service%20Pack%202-,Vulnerability%20(CVE-2017-0199),and%20execute%20malware%20on%20it.)\nfrom landing page embedded inside “settings.xml.rels”.\n\nThis technique is popularly known as “Template Injection” as well and is popular among threat actors since the\ndetection is trivial.\n\n“essa.dotm”\n\nAs soon as the user disables “Protected View”, the previous stage downloads and executes “essa.dotm” which further\nexecutes the macros.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.3 Extracting Data_\n\nAll the data of staged payloads are stored inside “UserForum.TextBox”. The macro has four text boxes as object,\ncontaining all the data to be dropped on disc as files and initiate further stages.\n\n_Fig.4 Routine for Saving all the files_\n\n**Executable Payload Analysis:**\n\n“fixit.exe”: This tends to behave as loader unless command is not issued from command and control. The payload is\ncompletely new, written in .NET and does not perform too many actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.5 Information collection_\n\nThe payload comes with .scr extension and once executed, it collects the following information about infected host\nusing WMI Queries:\n\n1; Processer ID.\n\n2; User Name.\n\n3; General Details (Architecture, Caption, Version).\n\n4; Check for Device Type (Laptop/Desktop).\n\n5; Device Model.\n\n_Fig.6 Initial knock being sent to C2_\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce information is collected about the host, the payload sends it to C&C and performs following actions according to\ncommand issued from C&C:\n\n1; Get Process List.\n\n_Fig.7 Sending Running Process List_\n\nIf command “q7&F%2 ” is issued from C2, payload sends list of running processes by using\n“Process.GetProcesses()” and creates an array of list.\n\n2; Write and Execute Files:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig.8 Write and Execute Routine_\n\nOnce C2 responds back with command, the payload receives files and execute on current folder.\n\n**Persistence:**\n\n_Fig.9 Creating Persistence_\n\nPayload gains persistence on infected host by writing LNK file to “Startup Folder”. It’s a well-known technique used by\nother threat actors. Payload loads an assembly which is publicly available called “IWshRuntimeLibrary.dll” and tries\nto create a LNK file in target folder giving reference to running payload’s working directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Taken from – https://www.aitpune.com/Notices/Scholarship/ESSA-Circular.pdf_\n\nOnce whole chain executed successfully, the macro opens PDF file dropped in ProgramData directory, which is\npublicly available.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf the attack is successful, attackers they may be able to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim machine. Our further\nanalysis and observation is still on to identify which group is behind this attack. Till then, we advise AWES to exercise\ncaution and inform all their members about this attack.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK TTPs:**\n\nSpear Phishing with Attachment T1566.001\n\nTemplate Injection T1221\n\nUser Execution: Malicious .docx and xls T1204.002\n\nWrite Files to disc T1006\n\n\n-----\n\nConnects to Command And Control TA0011\n\nPersistence: Write LNK file to Startup Folder T1547.001\n\n**How Quick Heal protects its users:**\n\nWe have the following detections for the malicious samples:\n\nVBA.Trojan.41523\n\nO97M.Downloader.41522\n\nTrojan.Perseus.S19235058\n\nTrojan.Perseus.S19221636\n\nTrojan.MSIL\n\nAlso, the domains and IPs used are classified as malicious by Quick Heal URLCAT.\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n**Documents: CVE-2017-0199**\n\n74e41223ec6359a9bd05bbce36b452fd046aaad64617f459ba262a5210925942 ESSA-Scholarships.docx\n\nd035e96f54abe59dcdbc2156e55cd0135ec420f8e97aca7f109ee8d062baa755 irlaforyou.docx\n\nd4b36731cb37ad05b0b9678b568c10a56f2e84967b393b626afb19d2df41c9b9 SARS_Eligible_Clubs___Resorts.xls\n\n**Templates :**\n\nfc3dd043b795a1cedb8b7e1e5471f15c0b5c17c237f634c60c4e0a92d980914b essa.dotm\n\n108a5035ab40b13b489f8a1fb8fd8bdb5880368c9c18e1d244df23b8d5a26d67 temp.dotm\n\n9fc84eadba969bd12cda144750cef361bcdff224026eb3921d8d46a5a424da5b temp.dotm\n\n**Executables:**\n\nd0a5ffa3b9c40eb1e4277e7c41a100b0836c9424b36fb9bbe281711c0b116883 fixit.exe\n\n4c21c88399d95a3602aaacf85a83c8aaac5ae7b6bf192c4c25cef4f9224b6f7b pixelworks.exe\n\n2491caddf4445d9297404493c7707b54591c989b94fd4634a7afdf54c0d22e9c sapesvx.exe\n\n979f7952dd2225c149f1766b4bca020b680364a77ddb6006cfa462543e0a6440 winsuffix.exe\n\nc7dbca435039a6148dc25208f04b734465e8b7c92010ede1401d88f5f8003f2d foxpackage.exe\n\n871cab3256acdbc3c27650adde878658568a85b87e85d3e3c137bdeb4592fb2c amdSfx.exe\n\n1eb0d373cea19124687ed4bffb0da3f80f98a18b9e0bebd3c12443f0a3d81689 modempx.exe\n\n814ed2b9ae0770d727a8cd83581b4865b2abe16f8190240c5c1e821e22a280ab foxpackage.exe\n\ndd47cf8ec70658af85e0cd23922462ac788305034fe78ed725bb90c1a3fa04cc scriptpbox.exe\n\n**Domains:**\n\n\n-----\n\ntemplatesmanagersync.info\n\n10feeds.com\n\n**Landing Pages:**\n\nhxxp://templatesmanagersync.info/essa.dotm\n\nhxxp://10feeds.com/temp.dotm\n\n**IP :**\n\n173.249.14.104\n**Subject matter Experts:**\n\nChaitanya Haritash\n\nShayak Tarafdar\n\nChaitanya Haritash works as Security Researcher in Security Labs at QuickHeal.
