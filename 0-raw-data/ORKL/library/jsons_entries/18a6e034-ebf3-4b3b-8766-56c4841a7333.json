According to Radware researchers, the drawing app also runs:\n\n**Temp\\\\DX.exe - the main Stresspaint module that remains persistent on the system**\n\n**Temp\\\\updata.dll - possibly used later on for credential/cookie stealing purposes**\n\nThe malware then sets the following Windows registry key to gain boot persistence and run\nStresspaint's DX.exe file with every PC boot:\n```\nHKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\Updata\n\n```\nAccording to the Radware team, the value of this registry key is DX.exe [parameter].\n\n\"We have seen two different parameters which may indicate two different infection\ncampaigns that the author wants to track,\" the Radware team says. \"This is also\nrepresented in the [Stresspaing] control panel.\"\n\nStresspaint also creates another registry key. This one holds each infected victim's GUID in\nthe form of \"[5 random letters/numbers]HHMMSSYYYYMMDD\".\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\VirtualStore\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\RelieveStressPaint\\guid\n\n## Stresspaint steals Chrome login data and session cookies\n\n```\nStresspaint then makes copies of Chrome's login data and cookies databases, which it\nstores at the following locations:\n```\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data11111\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies11111\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe malware makes copies of these files so it can run all the queries and operations it\nneeds to extract login credentials and cookie files stored in the user's Chrome browser.\n\n## Crooks accessing Facebook accounts to harvest data\n\nThe malware then takes the collected login data and session cookies, encrypts it, and\nuploads it to a remove C&C panel, along with the user's GUID.\n\nRadware researchers tracked this data to a control panel available in the Chinese\nlanguage. The control panel has dedicated sections for displaying Facebook credentials,\nand another one for Amazon data. This latter section is empty, suggesting attackers have\nnot focused on extracting the Amazon details from the stolen data just yet.\n\nResearchers say crooks are actively validating Facebook credentials and session cookies\nby logging into accounts and collecting additional data such as each user's number of\nfriends, whether the account manages a Facebook Page or not, and if the account has a\npayment method saved in its settings.\n\n## Stresspaint infected over 35,000 users\n\nRadware says it identified over 35,000 infected users, most based in Vietnam, Russia, and\nPakistan. The trojanized painting app was first seen at the start of the month, but crooks\nstarted its mass-distribution only over the weekend.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the malware is currently pretty well detected on aggregated virus-scanning services\nlike VirusTotal, Stresspaint initially flew under the radar of some security software because it\nmade copies of Chrome's login and cookies databases and queried the copies instead of\nattempting to access the original files, usually kept under surveillance by most security\nsoftware.\n\nResearchers have notified Facebook of the malware's credentials harvesting operations\nand have also reached out to the domain registrar where the malicious аоӏ.net domain was\nregistered, asking for it to be taken down.\n\n**UPDATE 1: Between the time we received the threat alert and publication time, Radware**\nresearchers have spotted changes to Stresspaint's inner workings, as the malware now\nuses a new format for the GUID, and some of the files and registry keys created on infected\nhosts also vary slightly. Nonetheless, besides cosmetic changes to file names and registry\nkeys, the same modus operandi remains.\n\n**[UPDATE 2: The Radware threat alert is now live, here.](https://security.radware.com/malware/stresspaint-malware-targeting-facebook-credentials/)**\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[German automakers targeted in year-long malware campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-automakers-targeted-in-year-long-malware-campaign/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[RIG Exploit Kit drops RedLine malware via Internet Explorer bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rig-exploit-kit-drops-redline-malware-via-internet-explorer-bug/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Facebook](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/facebook/)\n[Information Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/information-stealer/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
