At a briefing they were told that\nRussian groups were suspected.\n\nThe three-way consortium comprising NDR and WDR public broadcasting and the\n\"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" newspaper said Germany's political parties and their federal\nBundestag parliamentary factions were recently briefed by the BSI.\n\nArne Schönborn, the president of the Bonn-based Federal Office for Information Security as the BSI is known in English - told the journalist team: \"There are indications that point to\nthe APT28.\"\n\nThe BSI's Schönborn urges Germany to ward off hackers\n\nThe Advanced Persistent Threat or APT28, which is also known as the Sofacy Group, is the\n[name given by western agencies, including Germany's BfV domestic intelligence agency, to](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-domestic-intelligence-chief-accuses-russia-of-cyberwarfare/a-19256911)\nan alleged cyber attack network close to Russia's secret services, GRU and FSB.\n\nSchönborn said he had offered BSI help to the German parties so they could avoid future\ncyber attacks in the run-up to Germany's next federal election due in September 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince last year, campaigns by ATP have\nallegedly targeted NATO and knocked\nthe French television station TV5Monde\noff the air.\n\nA second group called \"Sandworm\"\nallegedly deployed electronic malware\nlast December to disable part of\nUkraine's power grid.\n\n**Alarm after recent hacker bids**\n\nThe German media consortium said German authorities were informed on September 7 that\nhacker attacks had been directed at federal parliamentarians of the center-left Social\nDemocrats (SPD) and the post-communist Left part, including its parliamentary group\nleader Sahra Wagenknecht.\n\nThe Left's Sahra Wagenknecht was\nallegedly a target\n\nAlso targeted were \"Jungen Union,\" the\nyouth wing of Chancellor Angela Merkel's\nconservative Christian Democratic\n(CDU) party and CDU politicians in\nSaarland on Germany's border with\nFrance.\n\nIn so-called phishing attacks on emails\non August 15 and 24, hackers had used false identities suggesting that the messages were\nfrom NATO about the July coup attempt in Turkey and last month's earthquake in Italy's\nUmbria region.\n\nThe Bundestag federal parliament had managed to avoid that attack, the consortium said,\n[because it had already blocked access to malware after a previous scare in May.](https://www.dw.com/en/bundestag-it-system-shut-down-after-hacker-attack/a-18659654)\n\nThe consortium said the recent attacks were being taken \"extremely seriously\" because\nauthorities feared that sensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later\nmanipulate the public ahead of elections.\n\n**Russia 'very innovative'**\n\n[Marcel H. Van Herpen, who heads the Cicero Foundation, a Dutch think tank which advises](http://www.cicerofoundation.org/about/index.php)\nthe EU, wrote late last month in the German parliamentary magazine \"APUZ\" that Russian\n\"disinformation\" had become \"very innovative\" under President Vladimir Putin, a former\n\n\n-----\n\nKGB agent once stationed in communist East Germany.\n\n\"That relates to the extremely lavish budget for the propaganda work of the Kremlin, the farreaching modernization of the Russian propaganda machinery, the use of psychological\nknow-how and the relative openness of the Western media world\" to influence Western\npolitical decision-making, Van Herpen said.\n\nThe Dutch expert said a long-running subject at Russia's military academies was the Chinese\nmethod of \"Sunzi\" or \"the art of warfare\", developed in around 500 years BC, that used\ndeception to erode resistance and defeat the enemy \"without having to fight a battle.\"\n\nHe advised Western governments to significantly raise their budgets for \"public diplomacy.\"\nThese had been severely trimmed over the past 10 years while Russia had \"constantly raised\"\nits funding for its \"propaganda machinery.\"\n\nipj/kl (AP, dpa, AFP, ARD)\n\n**Date\n20.09.2016**\n**[Related Subjects\nVladimir Putin, Reichstag, Dmitry Medvedev, Kremlin, German](https://www.dw.com/en/vladimir-putin/t-17449200)**\n[election 2017, 2018 World Cup, Bundestag (Germany's lower house of parliament),](https://www.dw.com/en/2018-world-cup/t-43747820)\n[Russia, Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://www.dw.com/en/russia/t-19065060)\n**[Keywords\nhackers,\nAPT28,\nBSI,\nSchönborn,\nBundestag,\nRussia,\nGRU,\nFSB,\nPutin,](https://www.dw.com/search/en?languageCode=en&origin=gN&item=hackers&searchNavigationId=9097)**\n[Kremlin,\nvan Herpen,\nCicero,\nBfV](https://www.dw.com/search/en?languageCode=en&origin=gN&item=Kremlin&searchNavigationId=9097)\nSend us your feedback.\n**[Print\nPrint this page](javascript:window.print())**\n**Permalink\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/1K5eY**\n\n\n-----",
