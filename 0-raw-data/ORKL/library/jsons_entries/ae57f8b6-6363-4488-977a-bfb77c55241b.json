The sample was\nreceived by our team\ncontaining the details below.\n\nMD5 Hash :\ne58ffc4e23292d80916b0e19c184cdef\n\nFilename : 5_6172262213630297202.apk\n\nFile Type : Application Packaging Kit (APK)\n\nApp Name : MY Maid\n\nPackage Name :\ncom.example.bio\n\nMain Activity :\ncom.example.bio.MainClass\n\nAndroid\nVersion Name : 1.0\n\nAndroid Version\nCode : 1\n\nTable 1: Detail of the malicious APK\n\nThis Android application is embedded with certain code of malicious intents\nand permission.\nThe NetbyteSEC malware analyst team observed that the\napplication contains malicious\nclasses such as SMS receivers. Victim’s\nmessages will be intercepted when the device is\nreceiving messages and sent to\nthe attacker domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Overview modus operandi of MY Maid scam that is being targeted to  Malaysian\nvictims.\nVictims saw MyMaidKL from a Facebook advertisement which said that there is Hari Raya\nPromotion for everyone to grab an offer for cleaning service. After the victim saw the ads\nfrom FB, they chatted with the scammer for further information. The scammer asks\ncustomers to book an appointment through their android application. The victim navigates to\n_https://mymaidkl[.]com to download the APK file. Then, the APK file is downloaded to the_\nvictim's phone and the victim installs the apps. Upon installing the malicious application,\nvictims will be prompted to give RECEIVE_SMS permission to the malicious application. In\nthe application, victims will make payments on a fake online payment system website and\ntheir banking credentials are sent to the attacker. From here, attackers receive banking\ncredential information and read the victim's SMS which potentially reads the TAC code.\nAttackers then make illegal transactions after receiving the victim's credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: MyMaidKL from a Facebook advertisement\n(Source: https://twitter.com/Fiqqq_ahmad/status/1520200146700566528?\ns=20&t=4e60yr_fLurrumxg5ofjlA)\n\nIn this case here, mobile banking application users have been targeted by phishing scam\nmessages which aim to trick victims into allowing receiving SMS permission to the malicious\napp after the victim installs the application file from https://mymaidkl[.]com.\n\nFigure 3: MY Maid application packaging kit flow of execution on victim devices.\n\nThe malicious mechanism of the application are listed below:\na) Force the application to allow receiving messages from the victim's devices. The\napplication will be able to read received messages for the victim devices and send them\nback to the attacker server\nb) Send victim to customize MYMaid website which is used for phishing\n\n**Analysis**\n\n**Website Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Landing page of MY Maid website\n\nUpon landing on the website, victims will be browsing a very legitimate-looking website\nproviding maid service in Malaysia. The website https://mymaidkl[.]com is being hosted using\nWordPress CMS can be seen providing a WhatsApp quick chat link when inspecting the\nview-source of the page.\n\nFigure 5: Website containing contact scammer through WhatsApp.\n\nThe number that is being used, 0172675873, can be contacted and still\navailable.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Website hosting malicious apk that should be downloaded by victims\n\nNetbyteSEC malware analyst team determined that the website hosted the malicious APK in\nthe website, so the victim will download and install the file on their devices. After\ndownloading the APK, victims have to install the APK, in order to purchase the maid services\nprovided.\n\nNetbyteSEC malware analyst team generated a static analysis report for the APK file to find\nthe information about how the app connects to its backend, which can be used to perform\nattacks against the application server. From the static analysis, we are also able to\nunderstand the app’s permissions and intents, and other components that control how the\napp shares data with other apps and interacts with the operating system.\n\n**Static Analysis**\n\nNetbyteSEC malware analyst team begin the analysis by investigating the resources\ndirectory of the APK file. In the folder, the most important files that need to be analyzed are\nthe Manifest file which is named AndroidManifest.xml, and classes.dex file which contains\nthe DEX bytecode that is decompiled under the “Source Code” tab, and the assets/folder\nwhich contains any other files or dependencies that the APK may need to be run.\nIn AndroidManifest.xml, the NetbyteSEC malware analyst team starts to identify any of the\napplication entry points described in the Application Entry Point section.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: AndroidManifest.xml of MY Maid application.\n\nLooking through the manifest file, NetbyteSEC malware analyst team able to    see that\nthe application has requested the android.permission.INTERNET\npermission and\n_android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS from figure 7, which\nallows the application to create_\nnetwork sockets and listen to the\nmessage received by victim devices.\n\nFigure 8: Permissions requested by the application\n\nThis is a hard restricted permission which cannot be held by an\napplication until the installer\non record whitelists the permission.\n\n\n**_Android Permissions_**\n\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\n\n\n**_Description_**\n\nAllows an application to create network sockets\n\n\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_SMS Allows application to receive and process SMS\nmessages. Malicious\napplication may monitor your\nmessages or delete them without showing\nthem to\nyou.\n\nThere is an intention that was declared in the manifest file which is unusual for a streaming\napp as it is not related to streaming services.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Anomaly activity that being used by the malicious APK, ReceiverClass and\n_MainClass_\n\nFigure 10: com.example.bio.MainClass\n\nBased on the figure above, NetbyteSEC malware analyst team concluded that the main\nclass will request SMS accessibility of the device using android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS.\n\nFigure 11: com.example.bio.MainClass\nFigure 10 shows that the application tried to request permission before proceeding to the\nmain page, which would be the landing page of the phishing website. If the permission is not\ngiven, the message will pop up “Please allow SMS before or reinstall the app”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: com.example.bio.MainClass\n\nAfter the victim allows the permission, the application will send a request to the attacker\ndomain containing a specific parameter. One of the table parameters is dID parameter which\nuses the ID of the victim device, as line 37 from figure 11. This is related to the figure below,\n_ReceiverClass which will be explained later. After allowing the permission, the victim will be_\nredirected to the website page of https://mobile666.mymaidkl[.]com.\n\nThe attacker do further phishing on specific which will be used to manipulate the victim\nsubmitting their sensitive information online.\n\nFigure 13: com.example.bio.ReceiverClass\nOn this figure, ReceiverClass is set up in order to obtain any message that is received by the\nvictim device. In line 28, NBS team conclude that whenever a message was received, this\nfunction will be triggered and the content of the SMS message will be read by this\napplication.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: com.example.bio.ReceiverClass\n\nAfter the attacker receives the message from the victim, the application will compile the\nmessage in JSON format along with some other information like the ID of the device. Then,\nSMS_Received will broadcast to the website\nhttps://api.lapubo[.]com/SNSDBBSJN/ISSASDS . The attacker will synchronize the data from\nthe C2 server and the phishing server by the ID of the message, which will be the Android ID\nof the victim device.\n\nConclusion\n\nNetbyteSEC malware analyst team concluded that the android application sample contains\nmalicious code. The start from the boot up through android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS\npermission. Then the malicious android application will request to have permission that can\naccess the victim SMS messages.\n\nUpon receiving any SMS message, the application will read the message and pack the\nmessage in json format, then will send the packet to their C2 server along with the other\ndata.\nIOC\n\ne58ffc4e23292d80916b0e19c184cdef\n\n+60172675873\n\nhttps://api.lapubo[.]com\n\nhttps://mymaidkl[.]com\n\nhttps://mobile666.mymaidkl[.]com\n\n\n-----",
