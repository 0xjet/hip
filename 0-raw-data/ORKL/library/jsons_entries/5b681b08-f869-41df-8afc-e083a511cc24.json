See\nthe ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\nHistorically, Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors have used common\nbut effective tactics—including spearphishing, brute force, and exploiting known vulnerabilities against\naccounts and networks with weak security—to gain initial access to target networks. Vulnerabilities\nknown to be exploited by Russian state-sponsored APT actors for initial access include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVE-2018-13379 FortiGate VPNs\nCVE-2019-1653 Cisco router\nCVE-2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server\nCVE-2019-7609 Kibana\nCVE-2019-9670 Zimbra software\nCVE-2019-10149 Exim Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\nCVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure\nCVE-2019-19781 Citrix\nCVE-2020-0688 Microsoft Exchange\nCVE-2020-4006 VMWare (note: this was a zero-day at time.)\nCVE-2020-5902 F5 Big-IP\nCVE-2020-14882 Oracle WebLogic\nCVE-2021-26855 Microsoft Exchange (Note: this vulnerability is frequently observed used in\nconjunction with CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065)\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have also demonstrated sophisticated tradecraft and cyber\ncapabilities by compromising third-party infrastructure, compromising third-party software, or\ndeveloping and deploying custom malware. The actors have also demonstrated the ability to maintain\npersistent, undetected, long-term access in compromised environments—including cloud\nenvironments—by using legitimate credentials.\n\nPage 2 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nIn some cases, Russian state-sponsored cyber operations against critical infrastructure organizations\nhave specifically targeted operational technology (OT)/industrial control systems (ICS) networks with\ndestructive malware. See the following advisories and alerts for information on historical Russian\nstate-sponsored cyber-intrusion campaigns and customized malware that have targeted ICS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICS Advisory ICS Focused Malware – Havex\nICS Alert Ongoing Sophisticated Malware Campaign Compromising ICS (Update E)\nICS Alert Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure\nTechnical Alert CrashOverride Malware\nCISA MAR HatMan: Safety System Targeted Malware (Update B)\nCISA ICS Advisory Schneider Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B)\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used sophisticated cyber capabilities to target a variety of\nU.S. and international critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Defense Industrial\nBase as well as the Healthcare and Public Health, Energy, Telecommunications, and Government\nFacilities Sectors. High-profile cyber activity publicly attributed to Russian state-sponsored APT actors\nby U.S. government reporting and legal actions includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors targeting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)\ngovernments and aviation networks, September 2020, through at least December 2020.\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation\nnetworks. The actors successfully compromised networks and exfiltrated data from multiple\nvictims.\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors’ global Energy Sector intrusion campaign, 2011 to\n2018. These Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign\nin which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks,\ndeployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors’ campaign against Ukrainian critical\ninfrastructure, 2015 and 2016. Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a\ncyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies, leading to multiple companies\nexperiencing unplanned power outages in December 2015. The actors deployed BlackEnergy\nmalware to steal user credentials and used its destructive malware component, KillDisk, to\nmake infected computers inoperable. In 2016, these actors conducted a cyber-intrusion\ncampaign against a Ukrainian electrical transmission company and deployed CrashOverride\nmalware specifically designed to attack power grids.\n\nFor more information on recent and historical Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see\nthe referenced products below or cisa.gov/Russia.\n\n\n\nJoint FBI-DHS-CISA CSA Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Cyber Operations:\nTrends and Best Practices for Network Defenders\nJoint NSA-FBI-CISA CSA Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to\nCompromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments\n\nPage 3 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint FBI-CISA CSA Russian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat Actor\nCompromises U.S. Government Targets\nJoint CISA-FBI CSA APT Actors Chaining Vulnerabilities against SLTT, Critical Infrastructure,\nand Elections Organizations\nCISA’s webpage Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active\nDirectory/M365 Compromise\nCISA Alert Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy Sector and Other Critical\nInfrastructure Sectors\nCISA ICS: Alert Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure\n\nTable 1 provides common, publicly known TTPs employed by Russian state-sponsored APT actors,\nwhich map to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 10. Note: these lists are not\nintended to be all inclusive. Russian state-sponsored actors have modified their TTPs before based\non public reporting.[1] Therefore, CISA, the FBI, and NSA anticipate the Russian state-sponsored\nactors may modify their TTPs as they deem necessary to reduce their risk of detection.\nTable 1: Common Tactics and Techniques Employed by Russian State-Sponsored APT Actors\nTactic\nReconnaissance\n[TA0043]\n\nTechnique\nActive Scanning:\nVulnerability Scanning\n[T1595.002]\n\nProcedure\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have performed largescale scans in an attempt to find vulnerable servers.\n\nPhishing for Information\n[T1598]\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted\nspearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target\nnetworks.\n\nResource\nDevelopment\n[TA0042]\n\nDevelop Capabilities:\nMalware [T1587.001]\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have developed and\ndeployed malware, including ICS-focused destructive\nmalware.\n\nInitial Access\n[TA0001]\n\nExploit Public Facing\nApplications [T1190]\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors use publicly known\nvulnerabilities, as well as zero-days, in internet-facing\nsystems to gain access to networks.\n\nSupply Chain\nCompromise:\nCompromise Software\nSupply Chain\n[T1195.002]\n\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have gained initial\naccess to victim organizations by compromising trusted thirdparty software.

Without a centralized log collection and\nmonitoring capability, organizations have limited ability to investigate incidents or detect the\nthreat actor behavior described in this advisory. Depending on the environment, examples\ninclude:\no\no\n\n●\n\nNative tools such as M365’s Sentinel.\nThird-party tools, such as Sparrow, Hawk, or CrowdStrike's Azure Reporting Tool\n(CRT), to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect unusual activity, service\nprincipals, and application activity. Note: for guidance on using these and other\ndetection tools, refer to CISA Alert Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in\nMicrosoft Cloud Environments.\n\nLook for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known Russian\nstate-sponsored TTPs. See table 1 for commonly observed TTPs.\no\n\no\n\nTo detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for system and\napplication login failures of valid accounts. Look for multiple, failed authentication\nattempts across multiple accounts.\nTo detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the below\nsteps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for suspicious “impossible logins,” such as logins with changing\nusername, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP\naddresses do not align to the expected user’s geographic location.\nLook for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.\nLook for “impossible travel.” Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from\nmultiple IP addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a\nperson could not realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two\nIP addresses during the time period between the logins). Note: implementing\nthis detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply\nVPN solutions before connecting into networks.\nLook for processes and program execution command-line arguments that may\nindicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the\nntds.dit file from a domain controller.\nLook for suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or\napplying user account mitigations.\n\nPage 6 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\n●\n\nLook for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.\nLook for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated\nwith normal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.\n\nFor organizations with OT/ICS systems:\no\no\n\nTake note of unexpected equipment behavior; for example, unexpected reboots of\ndigital controllers and other OT hardware and software.\nRecord delays or disruptions in communication with field equipment or other OT\ndevices. Determine if system parts or components are lagging or unresponsive.\n\nINCIDENT RESPONSE\nOrganizations detecting potential APT activity in their IT or OT networks should:\n1. Immediately isolate affected systems.\n2. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup\ndata with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.\n3. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.\n4. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter\nexpertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that\ncould enable follow-on exploitation.\n5. Report incidents to CISA and/or the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7\nCyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\nNote: for OT assets, organizations should have a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if\nyou lose access to—or control of—the IT and/or OT environment. Refer to the Mitigations section for\nmore information.\nSee the joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United\nStates on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for guidance on\nhunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in incident handling. CISA, the FBI, and\nNSA encourage critical infrastructure owners and operators to see CISA’s Federal Government\nCybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although tailored to federal civilian\nbranch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for planning and conducting\ncybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail each step for both incident and\nvulnerability response.\nNote: organizations should document incident response procedures in a cyber incident response\nplan, which organizations should create and exercise (as noted in the Mitigations section).\n\nPage 7 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nMITIGATIONS\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA encourage all organizations to implement the following recommendations to\nincrease their cyber resilience against this threat.\n\nBe Prepared\nConfirm Reporting Processes and Minimize Coverage Gaps\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop internal contact lists. Assign main points of contact for a suspected incident as well\nas roles and responsibilities and ensure personnel know how and when to report an incident.\nMinimize gaps in IT/OT security personnel availability by identifying surge support for\nresponding to an incident. Malicious cyber actors are known to target organizations on\nweekends and holidays when there are gaps in organizational cybersecurity—critical\ninfrastructure organizations should proactively protect themselves by minimizing gaps in\ncoverage.\nEnsure IT/OT security personnel monitor key internal security capabilities and can identify\nanomalous behavior. Flag any identified IOCs and TTPs for immediate response. (See table 1\nfor commonly observed TTPs).\n\nCreate, Maintain, and Exercise a Cyber Incident Response, Resilience Plan, and\nContinuity of Operations Plan\n\n\n\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.\nEnsure personnel are familiar with the key steps they need to take during an incident and are\npositioned to act in a calm and unified manner. Key questions:\no Do personnel have the access they need?\no Do they know the processes?\n\n\n\nFor OT assets/networks,\no Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or\ncontrol of—the IT and/or OT environment.\n Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or\nmanual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections\ncreate risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test\ncontingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety critical functions can\nbe maintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate\nat necessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.\no Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or\nOT networks need to be taken offline.\no Implement data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks. Backup\nprocedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. Regularly test backup\nprocedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could\nenable the spread of malware.\n\nPage 8 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\no\n\nIn addition to backing up data, develop recovery documents that include configuration\nsettings for common devices and critical OT equipment. This can enable more efficient\nrecovery following an incident.\n\nEnhance your Organization’s Cyber Posture\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend organizations apply the best practices below for identity and\naccess management, protective controls and architecture, and vulnerability and configuration\nmanagement.\n\nIdentity and Access Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication for all users, without exception.\nRequire accounts to have strong passwords and do not allow passwords to be used across\nmultiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access.\nSecure credentials. Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated their ability to\nmaintain persistence using compromised credentials.\no Use virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are\nsecurely stored.\no Disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.\no Consider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager\n(NTLM) and WDigest Authentication.\no Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft:\nManage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows\nServer 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\no Minimize the Active Directory attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity.\nMalicious activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ TGS and can\nbe used to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.\nSet a strong password policy for service accounts.\nAudit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are\nmonitored for anomalous activity.\no Secure accounts.\no Enforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the\nminimum permission they need to do their tasks.\no Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of\nadministrative tasks.\no Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).\n\nProtective Controls and Architecture\n\n\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a\nthreat actor or malware. Use network monitoring tools and host-based logs and monitoring\ntools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools are particularly\n\nPage 9 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\nuseful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon\nnetwork connections for each host.\nEnable strong spam filters.\no Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.\no Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.\no Implement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious\nwebsites or opening malicious attachments.\n\nNote: CISA, the FBI, and NSA also recommend, as a longer-term effort, that critical infrastructure\norganizations implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and\nfunctionality. Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by controlling traffic flows\nbetween—and access to—various subnetworks.\n\n\n\n\nAppropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network\nsegmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network\nis compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication\nbetween the IT and OT networks.\nOrganize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality, consequence, and\noperational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and\ndeploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones.\nProhibit ICS protocols from traversing the IT network.\n\nVulnerability and Configuration Management\n\n\nUpdate software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network\nassets, in a timely manner. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those\nCVEs identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote\ncode execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.\no Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a riskbased assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should\nparticipate in the patch management program.\no Consider signing up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability\nscanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service\nevaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP\naddresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nUse industry recommended antivirus programs.\no Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets\nusing up-to-date signatures.\no Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are\nidentified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\n\n\n\nImplement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and\nmitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security\nweaknesses.\n\nPage 10 of 12 | Product ID: A22-011A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\nDisable all unnecessary ports and protocols\no Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary\nports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control\nactivity.\no Turn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within\ndevices.\n\n\n\nEnsure OT hardware is in read-only mode.\n\nIncrease Organizational Vigilance\n\n\nRegularly review reporting on this threat. Consider signing up for CISA notifications to receive\ntimely information on current security issues, vulnerabilities, and high-impact activity.\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, refer to\ncisa.gov/Russia.\nRefer to CISA Analysis Report Strengthening Security Configurations to Defend Against\nAttackers Targeting Cloud Services for steps for guidance on strengthening your organizations\ncloud security practices.\nLeaders of small businesses and small and local government agencies should see CISA’s\nCyber Essentials for guidance on developing an actionable understanding of implementing\norganizational cybersecurity practices.\nCritical infrastructure owners and operators with OT/ICS networks, should review the following\nresources for additional information:\no NSA and CISA joint CSA NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce\nExposure Across Operational Technologies and Control Systems\no CISA factsheet Rising Ransomware Threat to Operational Technology Assets for\nadditional recommendations.\n\nREWARDS FOR JUSTICE PROGRAM\nIf you have information on state-sponsored Russian cyber operations targeting U.S. critical\ninfrastructure, contact the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice Program. You may be eligible\nfor a reward of up to $10 million, which DOS is offering for information leading to the identification or\nlocation of any person who, while acting under the direction or control of a foreign government,\nparticipates in malicious cyber activity against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer\nFraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
