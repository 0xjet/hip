    "plain_text": "# HBO Twitter and Facebook Accounts Hacked by OurMine\n\n**trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hbo-twitter-and-facebook-accounts-hacked-by-**\nourmine\n\nIn light of the recent [report detailing its willingness to pay US$250,000 in exchange for the](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hbo-hackers-leaked-email-ransom/)\n1.5 terabytes’ worth of data swiped by hackers from its servers, HBO finds itself dealing with\nyet another security breach.\n\nKnown for hijacking prominent social media accounts, the self-styled white hat hacking group\n[OurMine took over a number of verified Twitter and Facebook accounts belonging to the](http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hbo-social-media-accounts-hacked-exclusive-1202530715/)\ncable network. These include accounts for HBO shows, such as “Game of Thrones,” “Girls,”\nand “Ballers.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Screenshots of the hacked HBO Twitter accounts_\n\nThe hackers posted the same message across all of the accounts, which read, “Hi, OurَMi[َ]ne\nare here, we are just testing your security,HBO team please contact us to upgrade the\nsecurity - ourmine .org -> Contact” (sic). They also tweeted, “let’s make #HBOHacked\ntrending!”\n\nThe posts were deleted several minutes later.\n\nThis is not the first time that OurMine has claimed responsibility for hacking high-profile\n[social networking accounts. Last year, the group victimized Marvel, The](https://www.cnet.com/news/marvel-and-several-avengers-just-got-hacked-on-twitter/) [New York Times,](https://www.scmagazine.com/russia-to-attack-says-hacked-ny-times-twitter-account/article/633242/)\nand even the heads of some of the biggest technology companies in the world. Mark\nZuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, and Daniel Ek — the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter,\nGoogle and Spotify, respectively — have also fallen victim to the hackers, dispelling the\nnotion that a career in software and technology exempts one from being compromised.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nUsing complex and unique passwords for social networking accounts is not enough to make\nyou completely safe on the internet. You must consider adding another layer of security such\nas [two-factor authentication (2FA), which is a login method that requires two separate types](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/two-factor-authentication-and-sms-messages-dont-let-the-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-the-good)\nof identification.\n\nA combination of a memorized password and a unique code that comes in through SMS or a\nsmartphone app gives more security than just having single-factor authentication in place.\nBetter yet, fingerprint scanning can be used on supported devices for even more security.\n\nIf you’re a Twitter or Facebook user, you need only change your security settings to start\nusing 2FA with your phone number. After setting up 2FA, you will be prompted to enter your\npassword and the unique code sent to your phone number each time you log in.\n\n[You can also easily set up 2FA for other popular websites and online services.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/online-privacy/how-to-set-up-2fa-layered-security-for-online-accounts)\n\nHIDE\n\n\n-----\n\n**Like it?
