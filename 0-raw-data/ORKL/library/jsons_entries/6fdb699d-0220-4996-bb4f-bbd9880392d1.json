At the Federal Communications Commission, we now have a choice to\nmake. We can turn the other way and hope this threat goes away. But hope is not a plan.\nLeaving old policies in place when we know what new risks look like is not smart. Today, in light\nof the vulnerabilities exposed by Salt Typhoon, we need to take action to secure our networks. Our\nexisting rules are not modern. It is time we update them to reflect current threats so that we have a\nfighting chance to ensure that state-sponsored cyberattacks do not succeed. The time to take this\naction is now. We do not have the luxury of waiting. Telecommunications networks are essential\nfor everything in day-to-day life, from our national defense to public safety to economic growth.\nThe actions we take and propose here will strengthen our cybersecurity safeguards and enhance our\nresilience against future attacks.”\n\n**National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan: “The FCC’s Declaratory Ruling and Notice of**\nProposed Rulemaking is a critical step to require U.S. telecoms to improve cybersecurity to meet\ntoday’s nation state threats, including those from China’s well-resourced and sophisticated\noffensive cyber program.”\n\n**Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly: “The**\nFCC’s actions today are an important step in securing the nation’s telecommunications\ninfrastructure against the very real threat posed by the PRC and other threat actors. CISA will\ncontinue to work with all critical infrastructure entities to implement measures that help them\nsafeguard their networks.”\n\nThe Commission adopted a Declaratory Ruling finding that section 105 of Communications\nAssistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”) affirmatively requires telecommunications\ncarriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications. That\naction is accompanied by a proposal to require communications service providers to submit an\nannual certification to the FCC attesting that they have created, updated, and implemented a\n\n\n-----\n\ncybersecurity risk management plan, which would strengthen communications from future\ncyberattacks.\n\nThe Declaratory Ruling takes effect immediately. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking invites\ncomment on cybersecurity risk management requirements for a wide range of communications\nproviders. The Notice also seeks comment on additional ways to strengthen the cybersecurity\nposture of communications systems and services.\n\nIn November, the Commission proposed cybersecurity risk management plan requirements for\nsubmarine cable landing applicants and licensees. In addition, the Commission previously\nproposed that participants in the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts\nmaintain cybersecurity risk management plans.\n\n###\n\n**Media Relations: (202) 418-0500 / ASL: (844) 432-2275 / www.fcc.gov**\n\n_This is an unofficial announcement of Commission action.
