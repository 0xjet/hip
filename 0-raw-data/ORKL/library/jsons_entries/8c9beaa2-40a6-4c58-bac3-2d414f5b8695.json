The Ransomware\nRoundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the\n[evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/ransomware?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ransomware)\nvariants.\n\nThis latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers Vohuk, ScareCrow, and AERST\nransomware.\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n\n**Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Severity level: High**\n\n## Vohuk Ransomware\n\nLike most ransomware, the new Vohuk variant encrypts files on compromised machines and\ntries to extort money from victims. Its dropped ransom note, “README.txt”, asks victims to\ncontact the attacker via email with a unique ID assigned to each victim. As seen in the\nransom note, this Vohuk ransomware variant is version 1.3, potentially indicating that the\nattacker has updated the ransomware several times.\n\nFigure 1. The Vohuk ransomware’s ransom note\n\nFiles encrypted by Vohuk ransomware have a “.Vohuk” file extension. It also replaces file\nicons with a red lock icon.\n\nFigure 2. Files encrypted by Vohuk ransomware\n\nThe ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own.\n\nFigure 3. Desktop wallpaper replaced by Vohuk ransomware\n\nThe ransomware leaves a distinctive mutex, “Global\\\\VohukMutex”, which prevents different\ninstances of Vohuk ransomware from running on the same system.\n\nBased on the file submission locations to VirusTotal, Vohuk ransomware has primarily\naffected Germany and India.\n\n## ScareCrow Ransomware\n\nScareCrow is another typical ransomware that encrypts files on victims’ machines. Its\nransom note, also titled “readme.txt”, contains three Telegram channels that victims can use\nto speak with the attacker. While no financial demand is requested in the ransom note,\nvictims will most likely be asked to pay ransom to recover their encrypted files. At the time of\nthis writing, those three Telegram channels were unavailable.\n\nScareCrow ransomware appears to have some similarities with the infamous Conti\nransomware: both use the CHACHA algorithm to encrypt files and delete shadow copies\nusing wmic based on shadow copy IDs. This is not all that surprising because the Conti\nransomware source code was reportedly leaked earlier in the year. However, the ScareCrow\nthreat actor put some effort into developing this ransomware variant, as our analysis found\nsome significant differences. For example, Conti encrypts all command strings with one\ndecryption routine, whereas ScareCrow encrypts every string, including the name of the\nDLLs it loads (i.e., kernel32), the name of the APIs it uses, and even the command strings\nwith its own decryption routine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. ScareCrow ransomware s ransom note\n\nScareCrow ransomware adds a “.CROW” file extension to affected files.\n\nFigure 5. Files encrypted by ScareCrow ransomware.\n\nScareCrow ransomware files were submitted to VirusTotal from Germany, India, Italy, the\nPhilippines, Russia, and the United States. This indicates that this ransomware is relatively\nwidespread, albeit by using unknown infection vectors.\n\n## AESRT Ransomware\n\nAESRT is a new ransomware strain that FortiGuard Labs recently came across. It encrypts\nfiles on compromised machines and appends an “.AESRT” file extension to the files it\nencrypts. Instead of leaving a ransom note, the ransomware displays a popup window that\nincludes the attacker’s email address. It also accepts a field to enter the purchased key\nrequired to decrypt the ransomed files. The ransomware also deletes shadow copies, which\ninhibits the victim’s ability to recover files.\n\nFigure 6. Popup window displayed by AESRT ransomware\n\nFigure 7. Files encrypted by AESRT ransomware\n\n## Fortinet Protection\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through FortiGuard’s\nAntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows:\n\nFortiGuard Labs detects known Vohuk, ScareCrow, and AESRT ransomware variants with\nthe following AV signatures:\n\n**Vohuk ransomware**\n\nW32/Ransom.FYWDOCB!tr.ransom\nW32/Filecoder.OKE!tr.ransom\nW32/Filecoder.RTH!tr.ransom\n\n**ScareCrow ransomware**\n\nW32/Conti.F!tr.ransom\n\n**AESRT ransomware**\n\nMSIL/Filecoder.ACE!tr.ransom\nW32/Filecoder.ACE!tr.ransom\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Vohuk ransomware**\n\nf570a57621db552526f7e6c092375efc8df2656c5203209b2ac8e06a198b8964\n339a6e6e891d5bb8f19a01f948c352216e44656e46f3ee462319371fd98b3369\n5af5401f756753bebec40c1402266d31cb16c3831cb3e9e4fe7f8562adadeee7\n\n**ScareCrow ransomware**\n\n7f6421cdf6355edfdcbddadd26bcdfbf984def301df3c6c03d71af8e30bb781f\na4337294dc51518284641982a28df585ede9b5f0e3f86be3c2c6bb5ad766a50f\nbcf49782d7dc8c7010156b31d3d56193d751d0dbfa2abbe7671bcf31f2cb190a\n\n**AESRT ransomware**\n\n05072a7ec455fdf0977f69d49dcaaf012c403c9d39861fa2216eae19c160527f\nb6743906c49c1c7a36439a46de9aca88b6cd40f52af128b215f808a406a69598\n\n## FortiGuard Labs Guidance\n\nDue to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an\norganization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.\n\nSince the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider\nleveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing\nthreats:\n\nThe [FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations](https://www.fortinet.com/products/phishing-simulation)\ntest user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper\npractices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.\n\nOur FREE [NSE training:](https://training.fortinet.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-institute) [NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness includes a module on](https://training.fortinet.com/local/staticpage/view.php?page=nse_1&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-1)\ninternet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from\nvarious types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs.\n\nOrganizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and\nsecurity of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk\nof ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce\ntelecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere.\n[Cloud-based security solutions, such as SASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/sase?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=sase)\nendpoint security, such as [EDR (endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiedr)\n\n\n-----\n\n[malware mid-attack; and Zero Trust Access and network segmentation strategies that restrict](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/network-access.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=zero-trust-network-access)\naccess to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated\nto minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.\n\n[As part of the industry's leading fully integrated Security Fabric, delivering integration and](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-fabric.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=security+fabric)\nautomation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of\ntechnology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our\nglobal FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.\n\n## Best Practices include Not Paying a Ransom\n\n[Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\npaying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered.\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nadvisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional\norganizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit\nactivities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by\n[ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page where victims can submit samples](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\nof ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).\n\n## How Fortinet Can Help\n\nFortiGuard Labs’ [Emergency Incident Response Service provides rapid and effective](https://www.fortinet.com/support/support-services/fortiguard-security-subscriptions/incident-response)\nresponse when an incident is detected. And our Incident Readiness Subscription\nService provides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through\nreadiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop\nexercises).\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fglabs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard AI-powered security services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-as-a-service/fortiguard-subscriptions?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=services)_\n\n\n-----",
