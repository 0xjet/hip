These reports summarize individual\n\n threat exploits and provide practical recommendations for protecting against them.\n\n As a result of our threat intelligence mandate, we have analyzed Quasar RAT which has\n\n been widely leveraged by multiple threat actor groups targeting both government and\n\n private organizations in Southeast Asia and other geographies.\n\n Quasar RAT (aka: CinaRAT, Yggdrasil) is an open-source remote access trojan (RAT) that\n\n has been widely adopted by bad actors due to its powerful techniques. Quasar RAT has\n\n been behind multiple attack campaigns by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and\n\n most recently, a Chinese threat group APT10 was observed using it for targeted attacks.\n\n This RAT is written in the C# programming\n\n language. Its capabilities include capturing\n The purposes of this research\n screenshots, recording webcam video, reversing\n\n report are multi-fold:\n proxy settings, editing registry entries, spying\n\n on the user actions, keylogging, and stealing 1. To examine the evolution\n of the Quasar RAT payload\n passwords. Nasty stuff.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key Research Findings\n\n9 Quasar RAT is a full featured remote administration tool that has been open source since at least 2014\n\n9 The .NET executable has its communication encrypted through HTTPS which uses a TLS1.2 protocol\n\n9 Quasar RAT features provide techniques related to persistence, injection, and defense mechanisms\n\n9 The RAT has been actively leveraged by various APT groups such as APT10 to achieve its malicious objectives\n\n### Who Should Read this Report?\n\nThe details of this report can be used by SOC analysts, threat hunting teams, cyberthreat intelligence analysts,\nand digital forensics teams. The purpose is to understand how Quasar RAT behaves and how to defend against\nrelated attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The Evolution Quasar RAT’s Source Code\n\nThe timeline for Quasar RAT associated exploits are as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nQuasar RAT was initially released in 2014 as “xRAT”. In 2015, the developers of the RAT renamed it “Quasar” so\nthe malicious software could be distinguished from the original program. The RAT first came to light in 2017,\n[when the Gaza Cybergang group used it along with the Downeks downloader. The group had introduced an](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-downeks-and-quasar-rat-used-in-recent-targeted-attacks-against-governments/)\nobfuscator and a packer to hide the source code of the RAT and its server.\n\nIn 2018, Quasar RAT introduced a feature where the .NET wrapper DLL was used to create scheduled tasks on\nWindows systems. This feature was utilized by the Patchwork APT group while targeting primarily U.S. think tanks.\n\n[APT10 is known for leveraging Quasar RAT. In 2019, the group modified its version to include the SharpSploit](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/uncovering-new-activity-by-apt-)\n.NET post-exploitation library. This framework extends the Mimikatz open source malware program, which can\nsteal passwords from target machines. The SharpSploit function is mainly used to extract passwords from the\ncompromised system using Mimikatz’s capabilities (see figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1: Sharpsploit with Mimikatz capabilities_\n\n\n-----\n\n[Similarly in 2020, APT10 used Quasar RAT along with the novel Backdoor.Hartip tool, which is used for](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)\nsurveillance of a victim’s systems with the help of a DLL side-loading technique.\n\n[As of this writing, the most recent campaign was called ‘Operation Cache Panda APT’ which struck in February](https://medium.com/cycraft/smokescreen-supply-chain-attack-targets-taiwan-financial-sector-a-deeper-look-8acf290ddb96)\n2022. That exploit used a technique called reflective code loading to run malicious code on the victim’s systems\nand to install Quasar RAT to have persistent and remote access to the system using reverse RDP tunnels.\n\n[The sample associated with the campaign (MD5: 03b88fd80414edeabaaa6bb55d1d09fc) is packed by the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e16fe53a057b8beb144a101759b65c691d27c21aa7897d3b809668c20c5e05be)\nNetz .NET Framework packer (fig. 2). The packer decompresses the resource and utilizes reflection to load the\nassembly, find its entry point, and invoke it (fig. 3). Therefore, using reflective code loading, the server loads the\nassembly of the client to find the functions and passwords (figs. 4, 5).\n\n_Figure 2: The packer after de-compilation_\n\n_Figure 3: The resource is found and InvokeApp function is called_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: The assembly object is found by decompressing the resource and loading it with reflection_\n\n_Figure 5: The entry point is found and invoked_\n\nQuasar RAT has been leveraged in the past by many hacking groups including APT33, Dropping Elephant, Stone\nPanda, and The Gorgon Group.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Quasar RAT Configuration\n\nThe Quasar RAT framework is available on Github, and contains all the instructions for creating a client payload.\n\nWithin the Qualys Research Team’s lab environment, we installed a Quasar RAT server on “the attacker’s” virtual\n\nmachine and allowed the server to generate the Quasar client payload. We then transferred it to “the victim’s”\n\nvirtual machine, which had the Qualys Cloud Agent installed along with our Multi-Vector EDR cloud service enabled.\n\nNow let’s look at the client configuration which was set up on our server:\n\nFirst, as a part of the Basic Settings section (fig. 6), the customer tag must be edited with relevant details\n\n(e.g., Victim01).\n\n_Figure 6: Quasar RAT server Basic Settings_\n\nIn the Connection Settings section (fig. 7), the local IP and port can be configured, to initiate a connection with\n\nthe Quasar RAT Client.\n\n_Figure 7: Quasar RAT server Connection Settings_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Installation Settings gives a facility to decide where the client payload will be dropped during execution,\ne.g., AppData folder/directory (fig. 8).\n\n_Figure 8: Quasar RAT server Installation Settings_\n\nThe Assembly Settings section can be used to further obfuscate the payload by updating its properties and\nassigning it an icon file (fig. 9).\n\n_Figure 9: Quasar RAT server Assembly Settings_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Monitoring Settings section provides the Quasar Client with the ability to keylog and hide the log directory (fig. 10).\n\n_Figure 10: Quasar RAT server Monitoring Settings_\n\nThen, the Quasar RAT client payload is generated in the last step — Client-built.exe — which must be run on the\ntarget machine.\n\nGenerally, attackers will deliver the payload onto the victim’s machine via phishing, remote service exploitation,\nor some other malware technique. Once the victim executes the .exe file, a remote session is established on the\nQuasar RAT server (fig. 11).\n\n_Figure 11: Quasar RAT server connected to target machine_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical Analysis of a Quasar RAT Campaign\n\nThe malware campaign has been divided into different phases of attack chain which includes:\n\n##### Execution\n\nAfter execution on the victim’s system, the Quasar RAT client payload (client-build.exe) drops the actual Quasar\nRAT payload (“mal.exe”) in the directory path:\n\n###### C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\SubDir\\\n\nAn entry is made at the Quasar RAT server on the attacker’s machine that states the victim’s different\nparameters such as host name, user privilege, payload version, country, OS, etc. (fig. 12).\n\n_Figure 12: Quasar Server displaying RAT version, account type, country, etc._\n\nThe configuration of Quasar is stored in the Settings object. The configuration can be changed based on\nthe attacker’s preference of encryption key, mutex, directory, etc. The code for the Quasar RAT payload\nconfiguration is generated per the configurations set by the attacker (fig. 13).\n\n_Figure 13: ode analysis shows Quasar RAT configuration profile_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Quasar RAT payload tries to contact the attacker’s server to notify that a new computer has been\ncompromised successfully. This command & control (C2) domain list is stored in a dynamic object variable\nnamed hostsManager. The RAT communicates with the C2 server using the TCP port 4782, and every\ncommunication will be encrypted through HTTPS. The communication uses a proprietary protocol TLS1.2 (fig. 14).\n\n_Figure 14: Code analysis of the Quasar RAT payload shows TLS encryption_\n\n##### Discovery\n\nQuasar RAT can discover hardware and software configuration details of the remote victim (fig. 15).\n\n_Figure 15. Quasar RAT host discovery_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Quasar RAT code demonstrates the WindowsPrincipal class, which provides methods to check whether a\nuser exists within Windows user groups, including checking for built-in roles, such as the administrator role (fig. 16).\n\n_Figure 16: Source code for defining user role_\n\nThe code analysis also gives details to locate the geolocation of the system by using ip-api.com (fig. 17).\n\n_Figure 17: Source code to find geolocation of victim_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to get a public IP address, the authors of the Quasar RAT have used the api.ipify.org browser add-on\nto integrate with the RAT server or any malicious infrastructure, and thereby to hide its private IP (fig. 18). The\nsource code analysis gave details related to username, hostname (fig. 19), LAN IP Address (fig. 20), Mac address\n(fig. 21), antivirus, firewall details, and more.\n\n_Figure 18: RAT Code to get Public IP_\n\n_Figure 19: RAT code to get Hostname_\n\n_Figure 20: C# code for LAN IP address_\n\n_Figure 21: C# code to get Mac address_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe authors of Quasar RAT have utilized the “ManagementObjectSearcher” class to query all the antivirus (AV)\nnames and firewall details (fig. 22). AV details are determined using Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI) making a connection to the root\\SecurityCenter or root\\SecurityCenter2 namespace and then querying\nfor the AntiVirusProduct WMI class. Similarly, WMI is used to determine if a third-party firewall is installed, using\nthe FirewallProduct class (fig. 23).\n\nThe Quasar RAT payload can look for BIOS infrastructure (fig. 24), hostname (fig. 25), hard disk space (fig. 26),\nGPU details (fig. 27) and more using WMI.\n\n_Figure 22: WMI used for querying antivirus details_\n\n_Figure 23: WMI used for querying firewall details_\n\n_Figure 24: WMI used for querying BIOS details_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25: WMI used for querying CPU Name_\n\n_Figure 26: WMI used for querying physical memory_\n\n_Figure 27: WMI used for querying GPU details_\n\n\n-----\n\nQuasar RAT has some more discovery modules which help the attacker to map the target host.\n\n**Task Manager: This module is like a process management program. The cyber-criminal can access Task**\nManager to start/end processes and then add programs that run automatically on system startup (fig. 28).\n\n_Figure 28: Task Manager module of Quasar RAT_\n\n**File Manager: This module helps the attacker to access/delete files on the victim’s machine, and can download**\nfiles from it (fig. 29).\n\n_Figure 29: File Manager module of Quasar RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Registry Editor: This module helps the attacker to change, add, or delete registries (fig.30).**\n\n_Figure 30: Quasar RAT server Registry Editor module_\n\n**TCP connection: This module serves as a monitoring tool for connections over the network. Both incoming and**\noutgoing connections, routing tables, port listening, and usage statistics are monitored (fig. 31).\n\n_Figure 31: TCP Connection module of Quasar RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Persistence\n\nTo achieve persistence, Quasar RAT uses two methods (fig. 32):\n\n1. **Scheduled tasks—If the Quasar RAT client process has acquired administrator privileges, the client payload**\n\nwill generate a scheduled task via schtasks. The name of the scheduled task is based on the configuration in\nthe client builder. Usually, the schedule task runs after the user logs on and executes with the highest level\nof privilege.\n\n2. **Registry keys—If the client process does not have administrator privileges, the scheduled task will only add a**\n\nregistry value. That registry value is added to the following key:\n\n###### HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n_Figure 32: The code snippet shows schtask being created by Quasar RAT client or run key added in the registry_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Privilege Escalation\n\nQuasar RAT client escalates its privileges by launching a command prompt (cmd.exe) as an administrator. The\nelevated command prompt then relaunches the Quasar RAT client. The client now has the parent process\nrunning with elevated privileges (fig. 33). During this course, a User Account Control window pops up on the\ntarget machine (fig. 34). The pop-up window displays the process of running the command prompt as the\nadministrator (fig. 35).\n\n_Figure 33: Code snipped RAT trying to escalate privileges_\n\n_Figure 34: UAC window for privilege escalation of process cmd.exe_\n\n_Figure 35: Admin privilege gained by Quasar RAT server_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Credential Access\n\nQuasar RAT C# program has the capability of stealing credentials from different entities. The stolen data from\nthe target host is saved into a text file — Passwords.txt — by the attacker. The RAT server has the Password\nRecovery (fig. 36) module for stealing credentials.\n\nQuasar RAT can steal:\n\n9 Saved password from browsers (fig. 37) like Chrome (fig. 38), Microsoft Edge (fig. 39), Opera, Mozilla, etc.\n\n9 Information from ftp servers such as FileZilla, WinSCP (fig. 40), etc.\n\n_Figure 36: Password Recovery module of Quasar RAT_\n\n_Figure 37: Password Dump module for different browsers_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 38: Password Dump module for Chrome_\n\n_Figure 39: Password Dump module for Edge_\n\n_Figure 40: Password Reader module for WinSCP_\n\n\n-----\n\nQuasar RAT also operates as a keylogger (fig. 41). The feature saves logs as HTML files, where each of them contains\ninformation about the application in which the input was performed, and a record of the keys pressed (fig. 42).\n\n_Figure 41: Keylogger feature of Quasar RAT_\n\n_Figure 42: Code analysis of the Keylogger module_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Defense Evasion\n\nQuasar RAT uses a process hollowing technique that could be determined by analyzing the source code (figs.\n43, 44), which had Windows APIs such as WriteProcessMemory, VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect included (fig. 45).\n\n_Figure 43: Some Windows APIs found in the obfuscated code_\n\n_Figure 44: Some Windows APIs found in the un-obfuscated code_\n\n_Figure 45: Windows API calls_\n\nThe Quasar RAT payload calls NtUnmapViewOfSection, which is exported from ntdll.dll. The API will specifically\nun-map the memory region at that base address from the target process’s virtual memory. Essentially, the\nimage of the executable of the original process will be cleared.\n\nThe payload uses GetProcAddress in order to get the address of NtUnmapViewOfSection. The Windows API is\nthen used to dump the payload (i.e. VirtualAllocEx, NtUnmapViewOfSection, and WriteProcessMemory).\n\nQuasar RAT uses SetThreadContextto redirect the remote process to run the malicious thread.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Remote Shell and File Execution\n\nQuasar RAT has the capability to create a remote shell to the target host and execute arbitrary commands\n(fig. 46). Another feature is ‘remote execution’ which can help the attacker to download files to the victim’s\nmachine and then execute them (fig. 47).\n\n_Figure 46: Remote shell feature of Quasar RAT_\n\n_Figure 47: Remote Execute module of Quasar RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Lateral Movement\n\nOne of the interesting features of Quasar RAT is its remote desktop. Remote desktop allows the attacker to\ntake control of the host screen (fig. 48). The feature includes a regulator with which the picture quality can be\nchanged. One can also enable or disable the transmission of control signals.\n\n_Figure 48: Remote desktop feature of Quasar RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Impact: Shutdown/Reboot Systems\n\n[According to MITRE, “Impact” is the measure of how the adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040/)\nyour systems and data. Quasar RAT can execute commands to shut down, reboot, or hibernate a remote victim\nmachine (figs. 49, 50).\n\n**shutdown /s /t 0 – Shutdown**\n\n**shutdown /r /t 0 – Reboot**\n\n_Figure 49: Quasar RAT actions menu to shut down, restart, and standby_\n\n_Figure 50: Code snippet for shut down, restart, and standby_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Quasar RAT Detections\n\nWith the objective of detecting Quasar RAT techniques, we emulated some of the scenarios associated with the\nRAT campaigns in our research lab.\n\n**Yara Detection of Quasar RAT: The RAT “mal.exe” payload is dropped in the directory path:**\n\n###### C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\SubDir\\\n\n[Qualys Multi-Vector EDR armed with YARA scanning successfully detected the Quasar RAT (fig. 51) with a threat](https://www.qualys.com/apps/endpoint-detection-response/)\nscore of 9/10. The process tree exhibits client-build.exe accessing mal.exe (fig. 52).\n\n_Figure 51: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: File creation of mal.exe_\n\n_Figure 52: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Client-build.exe executing mal.exe as part of process tree_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Network Connection: Quasar RAT communication can be detected where the RAT’s mal.exe is**\nconnecting to multiple IP addresses and port numbers (fig. 53) as well as through an uncommon TCP port 4782\n(fig. 54).\n\n_Figure 53: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Process tree of mal.exe connecting to different IP addresses_\n_and port numbers_\n\n_Figure 54: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: C2 server connection on TCP port 4782_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Persistence: Quasar RAT’s persistence mechanism can be detected where the registry value and**\ndata are added under the registry key (fig. 55):\n\n###### HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nThe other way that Quasar creates persistence is by adding a scheduled task. This makes schtasks another\ndetection parameter (fig. 56).\n\n###### schtasks create /tn “Java Update” /sc ONLOGON /tr “C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sub­\n\n Dir\\mal.exe” /rl HIGHEST /f\n\n_Figure 55: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Registry Key used to create persistence_\n\n_Figure 56: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Schtask used to create persistence via admin privileges_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Privilege Escalation: Quasar RAT escalates its privileges by launching a command prompt — cmd.**\nexe — as an administrator. Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detects and displays the process cmd.exe running with\nelevation (fig. 57), as well as the process tree where mal.exe is trying to access the cmd.exe process (fig. 58).\n\n_Figure 57: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Cmd.exe accessed with elevated privileges_\n\n_Figure 58: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Process tree of mal.exe executing cmd.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Modification of System Processes: The attacker can kill a particular process using the task**\nmanager feature of Quasar RAT. Figure 59 below shows Notepad++.exe as one of the processes running in\nthe target machine. If the attacker kills the notepad++.exe process, then Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detects this\nactivity as follows:\n\n9 Notepad++.exe process termination event on the EDR console (fig. 60)\n\n9 Process tree for explorer.exe accessing notepad++.exe to terminate it (fig. 61)\n\n_Figure 59: Task manager module used to kill Notepad++.exe process_\n\n_Figure 60: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Notepad++.exe process termination event_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 61: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Explorer.exe accessing Notepad++.exe process to terminate it_\n\n**Detection of File Modification: The attacker can edit a particular file on the target host using the file manager**\nfeature of Quasar RAT. Figure 62 below shows adfind.exe is one of the files available on the target machine. If\nthe attacker deletes adfind, then detection of this activity using Qualys Multi-Vector EDR is as follows:\n\n9 Adfind.exe file deletion event (fig. 63)\n\n9 As a part of the process tree, mal.exe accessing adfind.exe to delete the file (fig. 64)\n\n_Figure 62: File Manager module used to delete a adfind.exe file_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 63: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Adfind.exe file deletion event_\n\n_Figure 64: Mal.exe deleting adfind.exe file as a part of process tree_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Registry Modification: Let’s consider a scenario where the attacker may try to permanently**\ndisable antivirus, by setting the DisableAntiSpyware registry key to 1 in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\\n###### Microsoft\\Windows Defender utilizing the registry editor feature of Quasar RAT.\n\nQualys Multi-Vector EDR detects registry changes as follows:\n\n9 Mal.exe accessing the specific registry HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\n\n(fig. 65)\n\n9 Registry write event with MITRE ATT&CK #T1562 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools – tagged (fig. 66)\n\n_Figure 65: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Process tree of mal.exe trying to access Windows Defender registry_\n\n_Figure 66: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Registry write event with MITRE tagging_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Modifications of Network connections: There are multiple connections established by**\ndifferent processes in the target host, as shown in figure 67. Using the TCP connection module, the attacker\nmay terminate the connection for the process svchost.exe with local IP 10.113.107.202:7680 => remote IP\n10.113.107.227:14400. Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detected this as:\n\n9 10.113.107.227:14400 connection is closed/terminated by svchost.exe process (figs. 68, 69, 70)\n\n_Figure 67: TCP connection module used for terminating svchost connection_\n\n_Figure 68: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Svchost closed connection event log_\n\n_Figure 69: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Closed connection event details_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 70: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Closed connection through svchost_\n\n**Detection of Remote Shell: Let’s imagine a scenario where the attacker might run any arbitrary command into**\nthe target host using remote shell. For example, the attacker runs the systeminfo command to get details such\nOS name, version, configuration, and more using remote shell (fig. 71).\n\n_Figure 71: Systeminfo command run through remote shell_\n\n\n-----\n\n**As shown in figure 72, Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detects and observes that:**\n\n9 mal.exe => cmd.exe => systeminfo.exe, as a part of the process tree (fig. 73)\n\n_Figure 72: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR event for systeminfo_\n\n_Figure 73: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: The remote shell process tree_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection for Remote Execution: The attacker can upload any file into the target host and execute it using**\nremote execution. For example, the attacker has remotely uploaded Psinfo, a command-line tool that gathers\nkey information, on the victim’s machine (fig. 74). The file gets renamed and dropped in file directory:\n###### C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\n\nThen Psinfo is executed through mal.exe.\n\n_Figure 74: File Psinfo being uploaded through Remote Execution module_\n\nQualys Multi-Vector EDR detects and observes:\n\n9 The file creation event of “Psinfo” disguised as “MawkDIxdwKC5.exe” in the file directory C:\\Users\\admin\\\n\nAppData\\Local\\Temp\\ (figs. 75, 76)\n\n9 Mal.exe executing the MawkDIxdwKC5.exe process, which is suspicious, as a part of the EDR process tree\n\n(fig. 77)\n\n_Figure 75: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Psinfo tool renamed and dropped in specific directory_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 76: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Psinfo file creation event_\n\n_Figure 77: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Mal.exe masquerading, trying to access psinfo_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection of Shutdown, Reboot, or Standby: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection of Quasar RAT executing**\ncommands to shut down, reboot, or hibernate a remote victim’s machine is shown in figures 78 and 79.\n\n_Figure 78: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection of shutdown command_\n\n_Figure 79: Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detection: Mal.exe trying to execute shutdown.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Qualys Research Team has observed that the authors of Quasar RAT have evolved the malware over a time,\nhave made multiple changes to its communication protocols, and introduced new evasive defense techniques.\n\nThe Quasar RAT source code is openly accessible, which gives hacker communities an advantage to easily\nintegrate and add new malware features. Hence, they have been using the readily available RAT framework for\nlaunching cyber attacks — with little or no modification.\n\nThis research report has explained the various features and functions of Quasar RAT, how threat actor\ngroups are leveraging the RAT for launching attacks, and how Qualys Multi-Vector EDR helps in detecting and\neradicating this dirty rodent!\n\n\n-----\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\n9 Command and Sc+A2:B18ripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell - T1059.003\n\n9 Credentials from Web Browsers - T1555.003\n\n9 Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography - T1573.001\n\n9 Ingress Tool Transfer - T1105\n\n9 Input Capture: Keylogging - T1056.001\n\n9 Modify Registry - T1112\n\n9 Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol - T1021.001\n\n9 Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task - T1053.005\n\n9 System Information Discovery - T1082\n\n9 Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files - T1552.001\n\n9 Native API - T1106\n\n9 Windows Management Instrumentation - T1047\n\n9 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service - T1543.003\n\n9 Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing - T1027.002\n\n9 Masquerading: Rename System Utilities - T1036.003\n\n9 Process Injection: Process Hollowing - T1055.012\n\n9 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: System Checks - T1497.001\n\n9 Process Discovery - T1057\n\n9 Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery - T1518.001\n\n9 File and Directory Discovery - T1083\n\n9 Query Registry - T1012\n\n9 Input Capture - T1056\n\n9 Screen Capture - T1113\n\n9 Data from Local System - T1005\n\n9 Standard Non-Application Layer Protocol - T1095\n\n9 System Shutdown/Reboot - T1529\n\n9 Video Capture - T1125\n\n\n-----\n\n### IOCs — Indicator of Compromise for Quasar RAT\n\n##### MD5 Hashes\n\n9 c1362ae0ed61ed13730b5bc423a6b771\n\n9 b4bcf7088d6876a5e95b62cee9746139\n\n9 6e0597bbae126c82d19e1ceaea50b75c\n\n9 03b88fd80414edeabaaa6bb55d1d09fc\n\n9 b894ab525964231c3c16feb0f2cbcffa\n\n9 6b9112b4ee34e52e53104dbd538e04d3\n\n9 7ffbc50f20e72676a31d318bc8f50483\n\n9 483e02ec373ac4ce5676af185225d035\n\n9 313ae2a853e0f47ef81040dc58247c88\n\n9 7f9ec838f1906b3ac75a52babd2f77d6\n\n9 2c98cc1306c8e50112e907afa22cfc06\n\n9 fd4557a540e35948c0ff20f5b717d9bd\n\n9 c0dc33123fcfe80ba419c1a7fb8e26d3\n\n9 af0091faafe64b5d1ecdaf654c6b6282\n\n9 1ce3d7e716ee9635bb0bea1623793e85\n\n9 247d68ff4007bea6865af4783f7b15ab\n\n9 b45ff49959f07f2465b83ca044d7c345\n\n9 a1840646c8050d92c4f5140549711694\n\n9 081b7bc6d5161210dc65068d36a6b87b\n\n9 9ffbd9c5f170871b8dd14373a030d2e4\n\n9 58179e91bf9385c939c159f8b8faad17\n\n##### Domains\n\n9 carlossosrepete.servecounterstrike.com\n\n9 carsond5.hopto.org\n\n##### IP Addresses\n\n9 23.216.147.64\n\n**About Qualys**\n\nQualys, Inc.
