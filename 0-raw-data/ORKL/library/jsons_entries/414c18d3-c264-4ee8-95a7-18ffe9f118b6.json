This investigation shows multiple similarities\n[to previous attacks attributed to a group called MoleRATs (aka](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0021/) [The Gaza Cybergang), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068/)\noperated in the Middle East since 2012.\n\nIn our analysis, we distinguish between two separate campaigns happening simultaneously. These campaigns differ in tools, server\ninfrastructure, and nuances in decoy content and intended targets.\n\n1. The Spark Campaign: This campaign uses social engineering to infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark\n\n**[backdoor. This backdoor first emerged in January 2019 and has been continuously active since then. The campaign’s lure content](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/suspected-molerats-new-attack-in-the-middle-east-en/)**\nrevolves around recent geopolitical events, espeically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and the\nongoing conflict between Hamas and Fatah Palestinian movements.\n2. The Pierogi Campaign: This campaign uses social engineering attacks to infect victims with a new, undocumented backdoor dubbed\n\n**Pierogi. This backdoor first emerged in December 2019, and was discovered by Cybereason. In this campaign, the attackers use**\n[different TTPs and decoy documents reminiscent of previous campaigns by MoleRATs involving the Micropsia and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/palestine-delphi.html) [Kaperagent malware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-targeted-attacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/)\n\nIn part one of this research, we analyze the Spark campaign. This campaign is named after a rare backdoor used by the MoleRATs Group,\n[dubbed Spark by Cybereason and previously reported by 360’s blog.](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/suspected-molerats-new-attack-in-the-middle-east-en/)\n\n[For a detailed report on the Pierogi campaign, please see part 2 of this research.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-2-the-discovery-of-the-new-mysterious-pierogi-backdoor)\n\nThe creators of the Spark backdoor use several techniques to evade detection and stay under the radar. They pack the malware with a\n[powerful commercial tool called Enigma Packer and implement language checks to ensure the victims are Arabic speaking. This minimizes the](https://enigmaprotector.com/en/home.html)\nrisk of detection and infection of unwanted victims.\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Cyber Espionage in the Middle East: The Cybereason Nocturnus team has discovered several recent, targeted attacks in the Middle**\nEast These attacks deliver the Spark and Pierogi backdoors for politically-driven cyber espionage operations\n\n\n-----\n\n**a get** **g** **a est** **a s** e ca pa g s see s to ta get a est a d dua s a d e t t es, e y e ated to t e a est a go e e t\n**Politically-motivated APT: Cybereason suspects that the objective of the threat actor is to obtain sensitive information from the victims**\nand leverage it for political purposes.\n**Lured Into Deploying a Backdoor: The attackers use specially crafted lure content to trick targets into opening malicious files that infect**\nthe victim’s machine with a backdoor. The lure content in the malicious files relates to political affairs in the Middle East, with specific\nreferences to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, tension between Hamas and Fatah, and other political entities in the region.\n**Perpetrated by an Arabic-Speaking APT Group: The modus-operandi of the attackers in conjunction with the social engineering**\ntactics and decoy content seem aligned with previous attacks carried out by the Arabic-speaking APT group MoleRATs (aka Gaza\nCybergang). This group has been operating in the Middle East since 2012.\n\n[For a synopsis of this research, check out the Molerats & Pierogis Threat Alert.](https://www.cybereason.com/threat-alert-molerats-pierogis)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n Suspected Threat Actor Description\n\nThese attacks show significant similarities to previously documented attacks attributed to the Arabic-speaking threat actor, commonly referred\nto as the [MoleRATs group (aka,](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0021/) [The Gaza Cybergang,](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068/) [Moonlight,](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks) [DustySky, Gaza Hacker Team). This group, which has been attributed by](https://www.clearskysec.com/dustysky/)\nvarious security teams, is believed to be comprised of three subgroups:\n\n[1. Gaza Cybergang Group 1, also dubbed MoleRATs: MoleRATs has been active since at least 2012. This Arabic-speaking group uses](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068/)\n\nspear phishing attacks to infect target machines in the Middle East and North Africa with various Remote Access Trojans (RATs). As\nMoleRATs most prominently targets Palestinian territories, its spear phishing attacks often use attached malicious documents on topical\nPalestinian Authority-related issues to lure their victims. The group uses a mix of tools and malware, some developed by the group and\nothers that are more generic tools.\n[2. Gaza Cybergang Group 2, also dubbed Desert Falcons,](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/desert-falcon-arabic-apt/7678/) [APT-C-23,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/aridviper) [Arid Viper. This second group is an Arabic-speaking group that](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/aridviper)\n\nmainly targets the Middle East and North Africa, with a few targets in European and Asian countries as well. The group is known for their\n[advanced attacks that leverage custom-built Windows malware (Kasperagent,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-targeted-attacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/) [Micropsia) as well as Android malware (Vamp,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/palestine-delphi.html) [GnatSpy).](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-gnatspy-mobile-malware-family-discovered/)\n[3. Gaza Cybergang Group 3: This group is believed to be behind Operation Parliament. It is considered to be the most advanced group of](https://securelist.com/operation-parliament-who-is-doing-what/85237/)\n\nthe three, and is focused on high-profile targets in the Middle East, North America, Europe and Asia. The group is reported to have\npreviously attacked government institutions, parliaments, senates, diplomatic functions, and even Olympic and other sports bodies.\n\n**A Note on Attribution**\n\nIt is important to remember there are many threat actors operating in the Middle East, and often there are overlaps in TTPs, tools, motivation,\nand victimology. There have been cases in the past where a threat actor attempted to mimic another to thwart attribution efforts, and as such,\nattribution should rarely be taken as is, but instead with a grain of salt and critical thinking.\n\n## Infection Vector - Social Engineering using Targeted Content\n\n**Themes of the Content Used to Lure Targets**\n\nIn this attack, the targets are lured to open a document or a link attached to an email. There have been cases in the past where victims also\n[downloaded malicious content from fake news websites. The names of the files and their content play a major part in luring victims to open](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-targeted-attacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/)\n[them, as they usually relate to current topics pertaining to Hamas, the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas) [Palestinian National Authority, or other recent events in the Middle East.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority)\nThe lure documents analyzed by Cybereason in this attack concentrate on the following themes:\n\n**The Conflict between Hamas and Fatah: The** [historical rivalry between the Hamas and Fatah has resulted in many open battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah%E2%80%93Hamas_conflict)\nbetween the two entities.

In addition to known generic malware (such as: njRAT,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0385/)\n[Poison Ivy,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0012/) [XtremeRAT), the MoleRATs group has been known to develop its own custom tools such as DustySky, the](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/xtremerat-unicode-breaks-35897) [MoleRAT Loader and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.molerat_loader)\n[Scote. We believe this backdoor is relatively new and seems to have appeared starting in the beginning of 2019.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-tophat-campaign-attacks-within-the-middle-east-region-using-popular-third-party-services/)\n\nThe name Spark is derived from the PDB path left in a few of the backdoor binaries:\n\nW:\\Visual Studio 2017\\Spark4.2\\Release\\Spark4.2.pdb\n\nThe Spark backdoor allows the attackers to:\n\nCollect information about the infected machine.\nEncrypt the collected data and send it to the attackers over the HTTP protocol\n\n\n-----\n\no oad add t o a pay oads\nLog keystrokes.\nRecord audio using the computer’s microphone.\nExecute commands on the infected machine.\n\nThe creators of the Spark backdoor use a few techniques that are intended to keep the backdoor under-the-radar, including:\n\nPacking the payloads with the Enigma packer.\nChecking for antivirus and other security products using WMI.\nValidating Arabic keyboard and language settings on the infected machine.\n\n## Enigma Packer\n\n[All the the payloads observed by Cybereason in this campaign were packed by a powerful yet commercial packer called Enigma Packer. The](https://enigmaprotector.com/en/home.html)\n[MoleRATs group have been known to use this packer in previous attacks.](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/suspected-molerats-new-attack-in-themiddle-east-en/)\n\n_Enigma packer artifacts in file metadata (SHA-256: b08b8fddb9dd940a8ab91c9cb29db9bb611a5c533c9489fb99e36c43b4df1eca)._\n\n## Checking for Security Products\n\nOne common evasive mechanism used by the Spark backdoor is its ability to check for installed security products using WMI queries (WQL). If\ncertain security products are installed, the backdoor does not carry out its malicious activity.\n\nSELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct\nSELECT * FROM FirewallProduct\n\n## Checking for the Arabic Language\n\nAnother evasive mechanism used by the backdoor is how it checks whether an Arabic keyboard and Arabic language settings are used on the\ninfected machine. If Arabic keyboard and language settings are not found on the machine, the backdoor will not carry out its malicious activity.\nThis check serves two purposes:\n\n1. It minimizes the risk of overexposure by specifically targeting Arabic speakers.\n2. It can thwart detection by automated analysis engines and sandbox solutions.\n\n_Enumerating installed keyboards on the infected machine._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obtaining locale information from the infected machine._\n\n_Comparing the results of the language checks with the word Arabic._\n\n## Using a Hidden Window\n\nAfter unpacking itself, the Spark backdoor creates a hidden window where most of the malicious activity is handled.\n\n_Creation of the hidden window, using 0 value for the ShowWindow function to hide the window._\n\n[This behavior can be detected using a tool called WinLister, which enumerates hidden windows. The name of the window is Spark4.2.](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/winlister.html)\n\n## C2 Communication\n\nThe Spark backdoor communicates with the C2 servers over the HTTP protocol. The data is first encrypted and then encoded with Base64. In\nthis instance, the backdoor posts the data to the domain Nysura[.]com (For more domains, please see the IOC section of this research).\n\nIt is interesting to see that the HTTP POST host header refers to a legitimate domain cnet.com, however, in acutality, the data is sent to\nnysura[.]com, as can be seen in the traffic screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The Spark backdoor sends data to the C2 server._\n\nThe data sent to the C2 follows a structured pattern that uses a predefined keywords array, where each keyword is mapped to a certain\nsubroutine. The keywords are comprised of the names of individuals. They are mostly Western names, but there were some Arabic names in a\nfew of the samples.\n\n_Keywords comprised of names used by the backdoor._\n\nPrior to sending the data to the server, the data is encrypted and staged in an array like this:\n\n_[27089,28618,9833,4170,25722,19977,2369,21426,3435,7442,30146,21719,16140,16280,16688,22550,19867,194,3298]_\n\nThe data is then encoded with Base64:\n\n_\"WzI3MDg5LDI4NjE4LDk4MzMsNDE3MCwyNTcyMiwxOTk3NywyMzY5LDIxNDI2LDM0MzUsNzQ0MiwzMDE0NiwyMTcxOSwxNjE0MCwxNjI4MC_\n\n[The Base64-encoded data is inserted into the following json object, which contains the individual names.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)\n\n_json object containing the Base64-encoded data._\n\nLastly, the entire json object is encoded with Base64 and undergoes another stage of encryption, and then sent to the server:\n\n_ZjRTc1dTTU9nVW5FaXM3bGgvbU90MTlVMHFkb1c5SFFuRXhhSVR5YytIQkZremk3bk5wY21BUEZRYitJenA1cnlJY1lxREJJZ1RrL0N4UzZWcVV_\n\n[Using names as keywords is an identical technique to that of the data structure logic previously documented by 360’s blog post. This post](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/suspected-molerats-new-attack-in-the-middle-east-en/)\ndiscusses an earlier variant of the backdoor attributed to the MoleRATs group. Using other individuals names for C2 communication has also\nbeen done by the two other Gaza Cybergang groups:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ga a Cybe ga g G oup** **t** **t e** **[c ops a bac doo](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/palestine-delphi.html)** t s sta ce, t e C co u cat o p e e ted by t e c ops a\nbackdoor also used specific names for different C2 commands.\n**Gaza Cybergang Group 3 in** **[Operation Parliament: In this instance, the malware also used people’s names for C2 communication to](https://securelist.com/operation-parliament-who-is-doing-what/85237/)**\nsend and receive commands from the server. Based on the similarity of the naming convention and data format, we believe the Spark\n**backdoor could be an evolution of the backdoor mentioned in Operation Parliament, or at least inspired by the malware.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Spark campaign detailed in this blog demonstrates how the tense geopolitical climate in the Middle East is used by threat actors to lure\nvictims and infect them with the Spark backdoor for cyber espionage purposes.\n\nThe names of the files and decoy content seem to be carefully crafted, often referencing controversial and topical political issues. Cybereason\nestimates that the files are specifically meant to lure and appeal to victims from the Middle East, especially towards individuals and entities in\nthe Palestinian territories likely related to the Palestinian government or the Fatah movement.\n\nThe techniques, tools, and procedures used in this campaign bear great resemblance to previous attacks attributed to the MoleRATs Group\n(aka Gaza Cybergang Group), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has operated in the Middle East since 2012.\n\nOur research demonstrates the efforts used by attackers to reduce the risk of detection of the Spark backdoor by various security products.\nThe backdoor checks for the existence of antivirus and firewall products before it initiates its malicious activity. Importantly, the backdoor simply\nwill not reveal its malicious nature unless Arabic language keyboard and settings are found on the infected machine. This shows how the\nattackers use this backdoor in a surgical way to exclusively attack specific targets.\n\nIn addition, analysis of these backdoor delivery methods also highlights a trend by many threat actors where they use legitimate storage\nplatforms to deliver the initial stages of the attack. By storing malicious content on trusted platforms like DropBox, attackers reduce the risk of\ndetection by certain security solutions that are gaining popularity, like email filters.\n\n## Part 2: The discovery of the New, Mysterious Pierogi Backdoor\n\n Cybereason Detection, Visibility, and Prevention\n\nCybereason prevents and detects the attacks mentioned in this research.\n\n_Cybereason UI: The attack tree showing the installation of the Spark backdoor._\n\nCybereason’s Next-generation Antivirus can detect and prevent the Spark backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_(SHA-256: 5139a334d5629c598325787fc43a2924d38d3c005bffd93afb7258a4a9a8d8b3)_\n\nThe file (pdf.exe) was automatically blocked by NGAV.\n\n_Cybereason agent blocks the execution of the Spark Backdoor._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[Click here to download the MoleRATs IOCs (PDF)](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/MoleRATs%20IOCs%20(updated).pdf)\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK BREAKDOWN\n\n\n**Initial Access** **Execution** **Persistence** **Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\n\n**Defense Evasion** **Discovery** **Collection** **C&C** **Exfiltration**\n\n\nSpearphishing\nAttachment\n\nSpearphishing\nLink\n\n\nCommandLine\nInterface\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\nRegistry\nRun Keys /\nStartup\nFolder\n\n\nBypass\nUser\nAccount\nControl\n\nStartup\nItems\n\n\nBypass User\nAccount Control\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode\nFiles or Information\n\nDisabling Security\nTools\n\n[File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1107)\n\n[Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045)\n\n[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)\n\nEvade Analysis\nEnvironment\n\nSecurity Software\nDiscovery\n\n\nSystem Information\nDiscovery\n\n\n[User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/) Automated\nCollection\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox\nDiscovery\n\n\nScreen\nCapture\n\n\nData\nEncrypted\n\n\nWeb\nService\n\nData\nEncoding\n\nRemote\nFile\nCopy\n\n\n[Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) Shortcut\nModification\n\nUser\nExecution\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout the Author\n\n**Cybereason Nocturnus**\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team has brought the world’s brightest minds from the military, government intelligence, and enterprise security to\nuncover emerging threats across the globe.
