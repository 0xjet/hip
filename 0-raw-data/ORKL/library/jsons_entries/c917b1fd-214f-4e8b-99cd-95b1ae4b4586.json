Some of_\n_the things you can do with Play Core include the following:_\n\n_Download additional language resources_\n_Manage delivery of feature modules_\n_Manage delivery of asset packs_\n_Trigger in-app updates_\n_Request in-app reviews_\n\nSo, basically, the Google Play Core Library is a gateway for interacting with Google Play\nServices from within the application itself, starting from dynamic code loading (such as\ndownloading additional levels only when needed), to delivering locale-specific resources, to\ninteracting with Google Play’s review mechanisms.\n\nMany popular applications utilize this library including:\n\nFacebook and Instagram alone are responsible for 5 billion and 1 billion downloads to date,\nrespectively, from the Google Play Store. Imagine the number of devices that were impacted\nby this vulnerability.\n\n### What is CVE-2020-8913?\n\nOverSecured already covered the technical aspects of this vulnerability. For a more in-depth\n[technical analysis, please refer to their blog.](https://blog.oversecured.com/Oversecured-automatically-discovers-persistent-code-execution-in-the-Google-Play-Core-Library/)\n\nA brief overview: Inside the sandbox of each application, there are two folders: one for\n“verified” files received from Google Play, and another for “non-verified” files. Files\ndownloaded from Google Play services go into the verified folder, while files downloaded\nfrom other sources are sent to the non-verified folder. When a file is written to the verified\nfolder, it interacts with the Google Play Core library which loads and executes it.\n\nAnother feature, an exported intent, allows other sources to push files into the hosting\napplication’s sandbox. There are some limitations: the file is pushed into the non-verified\nfolder, and it is not automatically handled by the library.\n\nThe vulnerability lies within the combination of the two features mentioned above, and also\nutilizes file traversal, a concept as old as the internet itself. When a 3 party source pushes ard\nfile into another application, it needs to supply a path for the file to be written to. If an attacker\nuses file traversal (../verified_splits/my_evil_payload.apk), the payload is written to the\nverified folder, and is automatically loaded into the vulnerable application and executed\nwithin its scope.\n\nGoogle patched this vulnerability on April 6, 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Infographic showing the attack chain._\n\n## Impact and Magnitude:\n\nWhen we combine popular applications that utilize the Google Play Core library, and the\nLocal-Code-Execution vulnerability, we can clearly see the risks. If a malicious application\nexploits this vulnerability, it can gain code execution inside popular applications and have the\nsame access as the vulnerable application.\n\nThe possibilities are limited only by our creativity. Here are just a few examples:\n\nInject code into banking applications to grab credentials, and at the same time have\nSMS permissions to steal the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) codes.\nInject code into Enterprise applications to gain access to corporate resources.\nInject code into social media applications to spy on the victim, and use location access\nto track the device.\nInject code into IM apps to grab all messages, and possibly send messages on the\nvictim’s behalf.\n\nSince the vulnerability was patched in April, why is there cause for concern now? The\nanswer is because the patch needs to be pushed by the developers into the application.\nUnlike server-side vulnerabilities, where the vulnerability is patched completely once the\npatch is applied to the server, for client-side vulnerabilities, each developer needs to grab the\nlatest version of the library and insert it into the application.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the human factor is one of the most difficult to overcome when it comes to security, we\ndecided to see which applications patched the vulnerability, and which are still vulnerable to\nget an overall better understanding of the vulnerability’s magnitude.\n\nSince the publication of this vulnerability, we started monitoring vulnerable applications.\nDuring the month of September 2020, 13% of Google Play applications analyzed by\nSandBlast Mobile used this library, and 8% of those apps had a vulnerable version.\n\nWe also compared the September versions to the current versions on Google Play so we\ncould see which applications are still affected. To our surprise, we discovered applications\nfrom a large variety of genres:\n\nSocial – *Viber\nTravel – *Booking\nBusiness – ***Cisco Teams\nMaps and Navigation – Yango Pro (Taximeter), **Moovit\nDating – **Grindr, OKCupid\nBrowsers – Edge\nUtilities – Xrecorder, PowerDirector\n\n*Prior to this publication, we have notified the Apps about the vulnerability and the need to\nupdate the version of the library, in order not to be affected. Viber & Booking updated to the\npatched versions after our notification.\n** 19:00 December 3rd 2020 – Both Grindr & Moovit have updated their versions to the\npatched version and are no longer vulnerable\n\n*** 19:25 December 3rd 2020 – Cisco teams updated to the latest version and the app is no\nlonger vulnerable\n\n## Demo:\n\nAs our demo video shows, this vulnerability is easy to exploit. All you need to do is to create\na “hello world” application that calls the exported intent in the vulnerable app to push a file\ninto the verified files folder with the file-traversal path.\n\nThen sit back and watch the magic happen. To demonstrate targeting a specific application,\nwe took a vulnerable version of the Google Chrome application and created a dedicated\npayload to grab its bookmarks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Dfa8JEvnteY\n\n[SandBlast Mobile can detect this vulnerability in both legitimate vulnerable applications, and](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/mobile-security/)\nmalicious applications seeking to exploit it.\n\n## How to protect yourself:\n\n[Check Point SandBlast Mobile is the](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/mobile-security/) [market-leading Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) solution,](https://pages.checkpoint.com/2019-miercom-mobile-threat-defense-report.html)\nproviding the widest range of capabilities to help you secure your mobile workforce.\n\nSandBlast Mobile provides protection for all mobile vectors of attack, including the download\nof malicious applications and applications with malware embedded in them.\n\n## Appendix 1 – Vulnerable applications in Google Play\n\n**Package Name** **Name** **Version** **Download**\n**Count**\n\n**com.viber.voip** *Viber *14.1.0.16 500,000,000\n\n**com.booking** *Booking.com *24.8.2 100,000,000\n\n**com.aloha.browser** Aloha 2.23.0 1,000,000\n\n**com.walla.wallasports** Walla!
