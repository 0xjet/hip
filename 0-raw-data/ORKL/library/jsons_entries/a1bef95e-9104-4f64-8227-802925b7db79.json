Some of the victims have\nreportedly been compromised through a popular MSP software which led to encryption of\n[their customers. The total number of encrypted businesses could run into thousands.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-1-000-plus-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/)\n\nREvil ransomware has been advertised on underground forums for three years and it is one\nof the most prolific [RaaS operations. According to an interview with the REvil operator, the](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ngang earned over $100 million from its operations in 2020. The group’s activity was first\nobserved in April 2019 after the shutdown of GandCrab, another now-defunct ransomware\ngang. More details about that gang can be found in our articles Ransomware world in 2021:\nwho, how and why and Sodin ransomware exploits Windows vulnerability and processor\narchitecture.\n\nIn this latest case, the attackers deployed a malicious dropper via the PowerShell script,\nwhich, in turn, was executed through the vendor’s agent:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis script disables Microsoft Defender features and then uses the certutil.exe utility to\ndecode a malicious executable (agent.exe) that drops a legitimate Microsoft binary\n(MsMpEng.exe, an older version of Microsoft Defender) and malicious library (mpsvc.dll),\nwhich is the REvil ransomware. This library is then loaded by the legitimate MsMpEng.exe by\n[utilizing the DLL side-loading technique (T1574.002).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n\n**_Execution map for the “agent.exe” dropper – Kaspersky Cloud Sandbox_**\n\nUsing our Threat Intelligence service, we observed more than 5,000 attack attempts in 22\ncountries by the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Geography of attack attempts (based on KSN statistics)_**\n\nREvil uses the Salsa20 symmetric stream algorithm for encrypting the content of files and\nthe keys for it with an elliptic curve asymmetric algorithm. Decryption of files affected by this\nmalware is impossible without the cybercriminals’ keys due to the secure cryptographic\nscheme and implementation used in the malware.\n\nKaspersky products protect against this threat and detect it with the following names:\n\nUDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic\nTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Gen.gen\nTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Sodin.gen\nTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Convagent.gen\n[PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic (with Behavior Detection)](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/wiki-section/products/behavior-based-protection)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Section of Kaspersky TIP lookup page for the_**\n**_0x561CFFBABA71A6E8CC1CDCEDA990EAD4 binary_**\n\n[The vendor whose software was reportedly compromised, issued a special advisory which is](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689)\nbeing periodically updated.\n\nTo keep your company protected against ransomware 2.0 attacks, Kaspersky experts\nrecommend:\n\nNot exposing remote desktop services (such as RDP) to public networks unless\nabsolutely necessary and always using strong passwords for them.\nPromptly installing available patches for commercial VPN solutions providing access\nfor remote employees and acting as gateways in your network.\nAlways keeping software updated on all the devices you use to prevent ransomware\nfrom exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFocusing your defense strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to\nthe internet. Pay special attention to the outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals’\nconnections. Back up data regularly. Make sure you can quickly access it in an\n[emergency when needed. Use the latest Threat Intelligence information to stay aware](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)\nof actual TTPs used by threat actors.\n[Using solutions like Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response and the](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/endpoint-detection-response-edr) Kaspersky\nManaged Detection and Response service which help to identify and stop attacks at\nthe early stages, before the attackers reach their main goals.\nProtecting the corporate environment and educating your employees. Dedicated\ntraining courses can help, such as those provided in the Kaspersky Automated Security\nAwareness Platform. A free lesson on how to protect against ransomware attacks is\n[available here.](https://ransomware.k-asap.com/)\nUsing a reliable endpoint security solution such as Kaspersky Endpoint Security for\nBusiness that is powered by exploit prevention, behavior detection and a remediation\nengine that can roll back malicious actions.
