This actor, known as\nBeacon, communicates with an external team server to emulate command and control (C2) traffic. Due to its versatility, Cobalt Strike is\ncommonly used as a legitimate tool by red teams – but is also widely used by threat actors for real-world attacks. Different elements of Cobalt\nStrike contribute to that versatility, including the encoding algorithm that obfuscates metadata sent to the C2 server.\n\n[In a previous blog, “Cobalt Strike Analysis and Tutorial: How Malleable C2 Profiles Make Cobalt Strike Difficult to Detect,” we learned that an](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cobalt-strike-malleable-c2-profile/)\nattacker or red team can define metadata encoding indicators in Malleable C2 profiles for an HTTP transaction. When Cobalt Strike’s Beacon\n“phones home,” it sends metadata – information about the compromised system – to the Cobalt Strike TeamServer. The red team or attackers\nhave to define how this metadata is encoded and sent with the HTTP request to finish the C2 traffic communication.\n\nIn this blog post, we will go through the encoding algorithm, describe definitions and differences of encoding types used in the Cobalt Strike\nframework, and cover some malicious attacks seen in the wild. In doing so, we demonstrate how the encoding and decoding algorithm works\nduring the C2 traffic communication, and why this versatility makes Cobalt Strike an effective emulator for which it is difficult to design\ntraditional firewall defenses.\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Cobalt Strike,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/cobalt-strike/) [C2,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/C2/) [Tutorials](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/tutorial/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nMetadata Encoding Algorithm\n\nBase64 Encoding and Decoding\n\nBase64URL Encoding and Decoding\n\nNetBIOS Encoding and Decoding\n\nNetBIOSU Encoding and Decoding\n\nMask Encoding and Decoding\n\nCases in the Wild\n\n\n-----\n\nCo c us o\nIndicators of Compromise\nAdditional Resources\n\n## Metadata Encoding Algorithm\n\nThere are five encoding schemes supported by Cobalt Strike. The RSA-encrypted metadata is being encoded to easily transfer the ciphered\nbinary data in network protocol.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nEncoding schemes in the Cobalt Strike profile.\n\n## Base64 Encoding and Decoding\n\nBase64 Encoding and Decoding is a standard Request for Comments (RFC) algorithm implementation. The author has not made any changes\nto the Base64 Character set. Here is the list of characters used for encoding and decoding the data.\n\n**[ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k',**\n**'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '+', '/' ]**\n\nLet's understand the use of the Base64 algorithm in Malleable profiles by studying an example.\n\n1. Profile Metadata\n\n[Havex.profile uses Base64 encoding to transform metadata information about compromised systems before sending it. Figure 2 shows the](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/26323784672913923d20c5a638c6ca79459e8529/APT/havex.profile)\nmetadata is encoded using the Base64 encoding algorithm and the result is placed in the Cookie header.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nMetadata encoding options in the Havex profile.\n2. HTTP C2 traffic\n\nFigure 3 shows the HTTP C2 traffic generated from the profiles. The highlighted part is the Base64-encoded metadata about the compromised\nmachine.\n\nFigure 3.

Base64 Decoding\n\n\n-----\n\ny too ca decode t e e c ypted etadata e a e used t e yt o ase6 b a y to co p ete t e tas gu e s o s a sa p e\nscript to decode the data and print it in hex format.\nHere is the decoded data from the script. This is RSA-encrypted metadata about the compromised system:\n**“751990bee317e74e4f2aa6f13078ef22dd884e065b738f8373f49dee401a069d5dfd1d3e39e94cc637e21364e1fd71ab3322fb9c7a987fc6aa27**\n\nFigure 4.\n\nSample Python script to decode Base64 data.\n\n## Base64URL Encoding and Decoding\n\nBase64URL is a modified version of the Base64 encoding algorithm. The modified version uses URL and filename-safe characters for\nencoding and decoding. Here is the character set:\n\n**[ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k',**\n**'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '-', '_' ]**\n\nCompared to the Standard Base64 character set, the modified version has replaced ‘+’ with ‘-’ and ‘/’ with ‘_’. The Pad character ‘=’ is skipped\nfrom the encoded data as it is normally percent-encoded in URI.\n\nLet's understand the use of the Base64URL algorithm in Malleable profiles by studying an example.\n\n1. Profile Metadata\n\n[Cnnvideo_getonly.profile uses Base64URL encoding to transform the metadata information. (Note that this profile is an example of mimicking](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/26323784672913923d20c5a638c6ca79459e8529/normal/cnnvideo_getonly.profile)\nlegitimate CNN HTTP traffic and has no connection to the organization.) Figure 5 shows the metadata is encoded using the Base64URL\nencoding algorithm and appends the data to parameter g.\n\nFigure 5.\n\nMetadata encoding in CNN video profile.\n2. HTTP C2 traffic\n\nFigure 6 shows the HTTP C2 traffic generated by the Beacon. The parameter value is the Base64URL-encoded metadata about the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. HTTP\n\nC2 traffic generated using CNN video profile.\n3. Base64URL decoding\n\nA user has a couple of options to decode the data.\n\nA user can replace the ‘-’ with ‘+’ and ‘_’ with ‘/’ along with adding a pad character ‘=’. The replaced string becomes standard Base64encoded data. Then any Base64 decoding tool can be used to get the encrypted metadata.\nUse the scripting language to do the job. Figure 7 shows a sample Python script to decode the data. The urlsafe_b64decode instruction\nonly replaces the characters and does not add padding. In the sample, we have added ‘=’ to make the output compatible with Base64\nencoding. You can add more padding characters; Python only complains if it sees less padding.\nThe output of the script is RSA-encrypted metadata.\n“60495dff002eddaa0c409aaaae0fda592810993ae0ae319c87d62b65c54d92447daf2c1bc84930c5d90ed3a023227e254d3a2c28763be372bb\n\nFigure 7.\n\nPython script to decode the Base64URL.\n\n## NetBIOS Encoding and Decoding\n\nNetBIOS encoding is used to encode NetBIOS service names. The Cobalt Strike tool uses the same algorithm to encode victim metadata\nwhen it is being transferred in C2 communication.\n\nIn the NetBIOS encoding algorithm, each byte is represented by two bytes of ASCII characters. Each 4-bit (nibble) of the input byte is treated\nas a separate byte by right adjusting/zero filling the binary number. This number is then added to the value of ASCII character ‘a’. The resulting\nbyte is stored as a separate byte. Here is the character set used for encoding: [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘i’, ‘j’, ‘k’, ‘l’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘o’, ‘p’].\n\nFigure 8 demonstrates the encoding process:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8.\n\nNetBIOS encoding process.\nLet's understand the use of the NetBIOS algorithm in Malleable profiles by studying an example.\n\n1. Profile Metadata\n\n[Ocsp.profile uses NetBIOS encoding to convert the victim’s metadata. Figure 9 shows the metadata is encoded using the NetBIOS encoding](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/26323784672913923d20c5a638c6ca79459e8529/normal/ocsp.profile)\nalgorithm. The resulting data is appended to the URI.\n\n\n-----\n\nMetadata encoding in the OCSP profile.\n2. HTTP C2 traffic\n\nFigure 10 shows the HTTP traffic generated by the Beacon using the OCSP profile.\n\nHTTP C2 traffic generated using the OCSP profile.\n3. NetBIOS decoding\n\nFigure 11 shows a Python implementation to decode the NetBIOS-encoded metadata.\n\nThe output of the script is RSA-encrypted metadata about the victim:\n\n\nFigure 9.\n\nFigure 10.\n\n\n“5725245edcb589b305e33e02da1cda208ed083bed8a1ae0b3a87da0f9d6ebe31025ab67c58572acb9757288cc2e78bea414249fa8cb0783485a1b5\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11.\n\nPython script to decode the NetBIOS encoding.\n\n## NetBIOSU Encoding and Decoding\n\nThe NetBIOSU algorithm is a slightly modified version of the NetBIOS algorithm discussed above. The slight change is the character set used\nfor encoding the algorithm. In this algorithm, the character set is the uppercase version of the set used in the normal NetBIOS algorithm. Here\nis the set : [‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’, ‘F’, ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘I’, ‘J’, ‘K’, ‘L’, ‘M’, ‘N’, ‘O’, ‘P’].\n\nNetBIOSU uses the same encoding process as in the NetBIOS algorithm. Please refer to Figure 8 for more information.\n\nLet's understand the use of the NetBIOSU algorithm in Malleable profiles by studying an example.\n\n1. Profile Metadata\n\n[Asprox.profile uses NetBIOSU encoding to convert the victim’s metadata. Figure 12 shows the metadata is encoded using the NetBIOSU](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/26323784672913923d20c5a638c6ca79459e8529/crimeware/asprox.profile)\nencoding algorithm.

NetBIOSU decoding\n\nFigure 14 shows a Python implementation to decode the NetBIOSU-encoded metadata.\n\nThe output of the script is RSA-encrypted metadata about the victim.\n\n“722676e535f86ffc29ba1cafb9856d98d1f697a83b0afc5bb143e2cf2242152a351081fb837192da3e3b2d9021fab75ce32677b6299a24d15e28db883\n\nFigure 14.\n\nPython script to decode the NetBIOSU encoding.\n\n## Mask Encoding and Decoding\n\nThe Mask encoding algorithm can be indicated and combined with other encoding algorithms in the Malleable C2 profile, which can be loaded\nby the TeamServer and used as C2 communication. The Beacon will generate the random four bytes as Mask xor key, then use the Mask key\nto xor the 128-byte metadata encrypted and send the Mask key and encoded data to the TeamServer for C2 communication, As an example,\n[we walk through the randomized.profile to explain in more detail below.](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/randomized.profile)\n\n1. Figure 15 is a partial profile with metadata encoded by Mask and Base64URL. The partial profile below defines the URI and metadata\nencoding algorithm as Mask and Base64URL, and the encoded metadata will be appended to the URI.\n\nFigure 15.\n\nMetadata encoding options in randomized profile.\n2. HTTP C2 Traffic\n\nFigure 16 is the C2 traffic based on the Figure 15 profile, so we can reverse the encoding data with the following steps.\n\nFrom the traffic captured, we know that the entire URI is: /zChN7QMDhftv10Li9Cu-fm_T_3qDQawT-Z1GzNg1FWfAfSILT-u_rKLvXPRE0ac-pxJTlGFCUIm4Aw9rGHPCIJVl0zNdCbM_G2VkYXJ5GGGtVh8S0LWMM4YLGZD9okLcFBc402j5zESK71HaR_owJbAVBfFvAo8q0I2J74rmfGyIROyg\nRemove the prefix /zC.
