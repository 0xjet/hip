We track this\nactivity under the name ‘NobleBaron’.\nThis campaign employs a convoluted multi-stage infection chain, five to six layers\ndeep.\nMost custom downloaders leverage Cobalt Strike Beacon in-memory as a mechanism\nto drop more elusive payloads on select victims.\nThis report focuses on NobleBaron’s ‘DLL_stageless’ downloaders (aka NativeZone)\nSentinelLabs has discovered the use of one of these DLL_stageless downloaders as\npart of a poisoned update installer for electronic keys used by the Ukrainian\ngovernment.\nAt this time, the means of distribution are unknown. It’s possible that these update\narchives are being used as part of a regionally-specific supply chain attack.\nWe uncovered additional unreported DLL_stageless downloaders.\n\n## Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the extensive revelations of Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage activities over\nthe past five years, teams like APT28 (aka FancyBear, STRONTIUM) and APT29 (aka\nCozyBear, The Dukes) have retooled and reorganized extensively to avoid easy tracking by\nWestern governments and security vendors alike. The operations of ‘APT29’ no longer look\nanything like they did in the past half decade. At this point our preconceptions about these\ngroups are doing more to cloud our judgment than they elucidate. Perhaps new naming\nconventions (like ‘NOBELIUM’ or ‘StellarParticle’) will help piece these new clusters of\nactivity apart– all the while upsetting folks who would prefer a simpler threat landscape than\nthe one our reality affords us.\n\nWe track this new activity under the name ‘NobleBaron’, building off of the excellent reporting\nby Microsoft and Volexity. We acknowledge the suspicion that this is a newer iteration of\nAPT29 but share in the general trepidation to equate the two. While the aforementioned\ncompanies have done excellent work exposing the inner workings of this activity, we wanted\nto contribute additional variants we encountered in our follow-on research, including a\ncurious particularly insidious packaging of the ‘NativeZone’ downloader as part of a poisoned\ninstaller for a Ukrainian cryptographic smartkey used in government operations.\n\n## A Convoluted Infection Chain\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, the actor appears to be experimenting with various multi-stage\ninfection chains. Common variations include the method of delivering the ISO containers and\na wide variety of custom downloaders enmeshed with Cobalt Strike Beacon. There’s a vague\nmention of an iOS zero-day being hosted on Nobelium fingerprinting servers but no mention\nas to whether this entails an iOS payload. That said, we also suspect no company is in a\nposition to monitor iPhone endpoints for these payloads, Apple included.\n\nWhile the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload is a disappointingly ubiquitous end for such a\nconvoluted infection chain, it’s not in fact the end of that chain. Rather, it serves as an early\nscout that enables selective distribution of rarer payloads directly into memory where they’re\n\n\n-----\n\nless likely to be detected. A similar technique was employed by HackingTeam s Remote\nControl System (RCS) where initial infections used their ‘Scout’ malware for initial recon and\ncould then be selectively upgraded to the full ‘Elite’ payload. After years of burned iterations\non custom toolkits, it seems NobleBaron has opted for maximizing return on investment by\nsimply lowering their upfront investment.\n\nNotable TTPs include the following:\n\n[An increasing depth in multi-layer droppers (a concept briefly described by Steve Miller](https://twitter.com/stvemillertime/status/1398331332145647616?s=20)\nand worth exploring further) particularly with regard to the inevitable CS Beacon\npayload.\nThe use of large size files to avoid detection by security solutions with hardcoded size\nlimits for ‘efficiency’.\nA fishing-with-dynamite approach to collecting initial access to victims with low-cost\ntooling. The SolarWinds supply chain attack is one such example of starting with a\nwide victim pool and whittling down to high-value targets.\n\n## A Curious Poisoned Installer\n```\nSHA256\n3b94cc71c325f9068105b9e7d5c9667b1de2bde85b7abc5b29ff649fd54715c4\nSHA1\nfc781887fd0579044bbf783e6c408eb0eea43485\nMD5\n66534e53d8751a24a767221fed01268d\nCompilation Timestamp\n2021-05-18 10:21:20\nFirst Submission\n2021-05-18 13:26:14\nSize\n282KB\nInternal Name\nKM.FileSystem.dll\nFile Description\nІІТ Бібліотека роботи з НКІ типу: \"файлова система\" (Ukrainian)\n\n```\nMost notably, one of these NativeZone downloaders is being used as part of a clever\npoisoned installer targeting Ukrainian government security applications. A zip file is used to\npackage legitimate components alongside a malicious DLL ( KM.Filesystem.dll ). The\nmalicious `KM.Filesystem.dll was crafted to impersonate a legitimate component of the`\nUkrainian Institute of Technology’s cryptographic keys of the same name. It even mimics the\nsame two exported functions as the original.\n\n\n-----\n\nKM.Filesystem.dll exported functions\nThe package is not an ISO, but it follows a familiar formula. ‘ScanClientUpdate.zip’ relies on\na triad of sorts. An LNK is used to kick off the malicious `KM.FileSystem.dll component.`\nIn turn, `KM.FileSystem.dll starts by checking for presence of` `KM.EkeyAlmaz1C.dll (a`\nbenign DLL). This check is presumably meant as an anti-sandbox technique that would keep\nthis downloader from executing unless it’s in the same directory as the other packaged\ncomponents.\n\nScanClientUpdate.zip\n\ncontents\nWe stop short of referring to this as a supply chain attack since we lack visibility into its\nmeans of distribution. The poisoned installer may be delivered directly to relevant victims that\nrely on this regional solution. Alternatively, the attackers may have found a way of abusing\nan internal resource to distribute their malicious ‘update’.\n\nLNK starter command to run the malicious DLL\nThe LNK starter invokes the `KMGetInterface export to execute the malware’s functionality.`\nIt passes a benign Windows component as an argument ( ComputerDefaults.exe ). The\nattackers will use the file’s attributes later on.\n\nUpon execution, the user is presented with a vague ‘Success’ message box.\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that the heading of the message box is ‘ASKOD’, a reference to the Ukrainian\nelectronic document management system. This initiative is meant to enforce electronic digital\n[signatures through the use of cryptographic keys like the Алмаз-1К (transliterated as ‘Almaz-](http://ekalmaz1c.iit.com.ua/)\n1K’ or translated to ‘Diamond-1K’) shown below.\n\nАлмаз-1К electronic key description\n[These particular electronic keys are referenced in Ukrainian government tenders and make](https://www.tendersontime.com/tenders-details/means-cryptographic-protection-information-key-electronic-almaz-1k-1383ad7/)\nfor a cunning regional-specific lure to distribute malware.\n\nAfter displaying the message box, the malicious DLL proceeds to resolve APIs by hash and\ndecrypts its payload directly into memory. You guessed it: Cobalt Strike Beacon v4.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then decrypts the configuration via single-byte XOR `0x2E and attempts to establish`\ncontact with the command-and-control server `doggroomingnews[.]com . It checks for`\n```\n‘/storage/main.woff2’ and if necessary falls back to ‘/storage/page.woff2’ . The\n\n```\ndomain resolves to an IP address in Ukraine ( 45.135.167.27 ), which appears to be a\ncompromised domain.\n\nWhile we have not been able to fetch the response at this time, it’s worth noting that this\nsame IP was also contacted by a Cobalt Strike Beacon sample in late 2020:\n```\n5a9c48f49ab8eaf487cf57d45bf755d2e332d60180b80f1f20297b16a61aa984 artifact.exe\n\n```\nThese malicious updates are distributed in zip archives. At this time, we’ve discovered two\n‘ScanClientUpdate.zip’ samples, both containing the same malicious DLL:\n```\n51b47cd3fc139e20c21897a00ac4e3b096380f939633233116514a1f2d9e63d5\nca66b671a75bbee69a4a4d3000b45d5dc7d3891c7ee5891272ccb2c5aed5746c\n\n## ‘DLL_stageless’ (NativeZone) Variants\n\n```\nNobleBaron developers internally refer to these components under the name\n‘DLL_stageless’\n\nDLL_stageless PDB path\nThe following are variants of DLL_stageless with their respective delivery mechanisms and\nencrypted command-and-control configuration.\n```\nSHA256\n2a352380d61e89c89f03f4008044241a38751284995d000c73acf9cad38b989e\nSHA1\n6114655cf8ddfd115156a1c450ba01e31887fabb\nMD5\n77605aa6bd6fb890b9b823bd7a3cc78b\nCompilation Timestamp\n2021-03-15 18:32:47\nFirst Submission\n2021-04-01 14:06:27\nSize\n299.50KB\nITW Name\nMsDiskMountService.dll\nMalicious Export\nDiskDriveIni\nC&C\n74d6b7b2.app.giftbox4u[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA256\n776014a63bf3cc7034bd5b6a9c36c75a930b59182fe232535bb7a305e539967b\nSHA1\n247a32ebee0595605bab77fc6ff619f66740310b\nMD5\ne55d9f6300fa32458b909fded48ec2c9\nCompilation Timestamp\n2021-03-22 08:51:41\nFirst Submission\n2021-03-22 20:39:52\nSize\n351.50KB\nITW Name\ndiassvcs.dll\nMalicious Export\nInitializeComponent\nC&C\ncontent.pcmsar[.]net\nSHA256\na4f1f09a2b9bc87de90891da6c0fca28e2f88fd67034648060cef9862af9a3bf\nSHA1\n19a751ff6c5abd8e209f72add9cd35dd8e3af409\nMD5\n600aceaddb22b9a1d6ae374ba7fc28c5\nCompilation Timestamp\n2021-02-17 13:18:24\nFirst Submission\n2021-02-25 16:33:09\nSize\n277KB\nITW Name\nGraphicalComponent.dll\nMalicious Export\nVisualServiceComponent\nC&C\n139.99.167[.]177\n\n```\nAnalyzing `GraphicalComponent.dll led to the discovery of another DLL_stageless`\nsample.
