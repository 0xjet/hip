A](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-atlas)\ngrowing list of other Chinese threat groups have deployed it globally since 2019 in attacks\nagainst organizations in various industry verticals. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™\n(CTU) analysis of ShadowPad samples revealed clusters of activity linked to threat groups\naffiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) civilian intelligence agency and\nthe People's Liberation Army (PLA).\n\nSome clusters that target China's 'near abroad' appear to be linked to PLA theater\ncommands. These theater commands were introduced in the PLA reforms announced in\n2015. Evidence of infrastructure and malware crossover among threat groups likely\noperating within the same theater command suggests that PLA reforms could be facilitating\ncollaboration among these groups.\n\nShadowPad is decrypted in memory using a custom decryption algorithm. CTU™\nresearchers have identified multiple ShadowPad versions based on these distinct algorithms.\nShadowPad extracts information about the host, executes commands, interacts with the file\nsystem and registry, and deploys new modules to extend functionality. CTU researchers\ndiscovered that ShadowPad payloads are deployed to a host either encrypted within a DLL\nloader or within a separate file alongside a DLL loader. These DLL loaders decrypt and\nexecute ShadowPad in memory after being sideloaded by a legitimate executable vulnerable\nto DLL search order hijacking.\n\n## ShadowPad DLL loader execution\n\nThe majority of ShadowPad samples analyzed by CTU researchers were two-file execution\nchains: an encrypted ShadowPad payload embedded in a DLL loader. ShadowPad DLL\nloaders are sideloaded by a legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking.\nThe DLL loader then decrypts and executes the embedded ShadowPad payload in memory\nusing a custom decryption algorithm specific to the malware version. Table 1 lists legitimate\nexecutable and malicious DLL pairs that CTU researchers observed in analyzed samples.\n\n**Legitimate executable** **Vendor** **ShadowPad DLL loader filename**\n\nAppLaunch.exe Microsoft mscoree.dll\n\nhpqhvind.exe Hewlett Packard hpqhvsei.dll\n\nconsent.exe Microsoft secur32.dll\n\nTosBtKbd.exe Toshiba tosbtkbd.dll\n\nBDReinit.exe BitDefender log.dll\n\nOleview.exe Microsoft iviewers.dll\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 1. Legitimate executable and DLL loader filenames used to load ShadowPad._\n\nCTU researchers identified ShadowPad execution chains involving a third file that contains\nthe encrypted ShadowPad payload. These chains execute the legitimate executable (usually\nrenamed), sideload the ShadowPad DLL loader, and load and decrypt the third file. CTU\nresearchers observed threat actors using BDReinit.exe or Oleview.exe as initial files in the\nthree-file ShadowPad execution chain. The third file in the BDReinit.exe execution chain is\nlog.dll.dat; in the Oleview.exe execution chain, it is iviewers.dll.dat. CTU researchers have\n[attributed campaigns using these execution chains to the Chinese BRONZE UNIVERSITY](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-university)\nthreat group, which has targeted transportation, natural resource, energy, and non[governmental organizations. Third-party researchers have also identified three-file](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html)\nShadowPad execution chains that begin with consent.exe (followed by secur32.dll and\nsecur32.dll.dat) and AppLaunch.exe (followed by mscoree.dll and mscoree.dll.dat).\nAdditionally, CTU analysis revealed a sample that used AppLaunch.exe followed by\nmscoree.dll and mscoree.dll.mui.\n\nOther ShadowPad samples from 2018 also deviated from the typical two-file execution chain.\nThose samples, which used the filename TSVIPSrv.DLL, are placed in the Windows\nSystem32 directory and are loaded by the Windows SessionEnv Service, which is vulnerable\nto DLL hijacking. CTU researchers observed BRONZE ATLAS using this technique in 2021\nto load other payloads via this filename, including Cobalt Strike.\n\nCTU researchers discovered ShadowPad samples sharing behavioral similarities such as\ninjecting the decrypted ShadowPad payload into a newly launched target process and\nestablishing persistence on a compromised host specified in the configuration settings.\nFigure 1 lists configuration information for a ShadowPad sample that reveals command and\ncontrol (C2) details, the process injection target, and persistence via creation of a service\nand a registry Run key.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. ShadowPad sample configuration information. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAs part of the execution chain, ShadowPad copies the legitimate binary and sideloaded DLL\nto a subdirectory specific to each sample. Most analyzed samples were copied to a\nsubdirectory under C:\\ProgramData, C:\\Users\\<username>\\Roaming, or C:\\Program Files. In\nthree-file execution chains, the third file (e.g., log.dll.dat, iviewers.dll.dat) is typically deleted\nand the ShadowPad DLL loader is padded to over 50MB, likely to evade antivirus software.\nAs part of this process, an encrypted payload is usually saved to a registry key under\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{GUID}\\<eight-character hexadecimal string> (see\nFigure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. Sample ShadowPad encrypted payload location. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAfter the initial setup the legitimate executable is launched as a Windows service. This\nservice initiates the ShadowPad execution chain. The ShadowPad payload is injected into a\nchild process of the service process that is specified in the ShadowPad configuration\ninformation. Figure 3 shows the timeline of a ShadowPad execution chain (i.e., log.exe ->\nlog.dll -> log.dll.dat), followed by the service creation and execution of the copied files\n(log.exe renamed to reg.exe), and the payload injection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Observed timeline of ShadowPad execution, service creation, and payload injection_\n_on a compromised network. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers observed threat actors interacting with ShadowPad malware on\ncompromised hosts. In one incident, multiple cmd.exe child processes were launched via\nhands-on-keyboard activity (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Threat actor interaction with ShadowPad malware. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Identifying characteristics\n\nThe following file structures and behaviors can indicate a ShadowPad compromise:\n\nA subdirectory within C:\\ProgramData, C:\\Users\\<username>\\Roaming, or C:\\Program\nFiles that contains a legitimate executable (likely renamed) and one of the known\nShadowPad DLL loader filenames from Table 1 (see Figure 5)\n\n_Figure 5. Example legitimate executable and ShadowPad DLL loader in_\n_C:\\ProgramData subdirectory. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\nA Windows service that launches the legitimate executable from that subdirectory (see\nFigure 6)\n\n_Figure 6. Example of installed Windows service for ShadowPad persistence. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nProcess telemetry showing the Windows service creating an unusual child process\n(e.g., svchost.exe), which in turn creates multiple dllhost.exe and cmd.exe child\nprocesses\n\n## The BRONZE ATLAS/Chengdu 404 nexus\n\nShadowPad gained notoriety in 2017 after it was deployed in software supply chain attacks\n[involving CCleaner,](https://blog.avast.com/new-investigations-in-ccleaner-incident-point-to-a-possible-third-stage-that-had-keylogger-capacities) [NetSarang, and](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2017_shadowpad-how-attackers-hide-backdoor-in-software-used-by-hundreds-of-large-companies-around-the-world) [ASUS Live Update utility. These campaigns were](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers)\nattributed to the BRONZE ATLAS threat group.\n\n[A 2017 Microsoft complaint and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictments unsealed in](https://www.noticeofpleadings.net/barium/files/COMPLAINT_AND_SUMMONS/Complaint.pdf)\n2020 provide additional information on ShadowPad's connection to BRONZE ATLAS. The\nMicrosoft complaint alleges that BRONZE ATLAS (also known as Barium) deployed\nShadowPad in 2017 to steal intellectual property and personally identifiable information (PII).\nAt the time, the malware was used only by BRONZE ATLAS. The DOJ indictments allege\nthat Chinese nationals working for the Chengdu 404 network security company deployed\nShadowPad in a global campaign attributed to BRONZE ATLAS.\n\nA related DOJ indictment revealed that these Chinese nationals collaborated with another\n[Chinese national known by the handle 'Rose' (sometimes known as Withered Rose and](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/tan-dailin/download.pdf)\nWicked Rose), using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and sharing\n[malware. The indictment describes this individual as a sophisticated threat actor who](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1317216/download)\ncommitted computer intrusion offenses targeting high-technology organizations globally.\n[Campaigns linked to Rose were tracked as Barium.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n\nA third-party [report claimed that Rose likely co-developed malware with an associate named](https://assets.sentinelone.com/c/Shadowpad?x=P42eqA)\n['whg,' who has been linked to the development of the PlugX malware. PlugX is used by](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos)\nmultiple Chinese threat groups. Third-party researchers also identified string and code\noverlap between PlugX and ShadowPad. This overlap suggests close links between the\nShadowPad and PlugX developers. ShadowPad may have been developed by an individual\n\n\n-----\n\nor group affiliated with BRONZE ATLAS. One possibility is that Chengdu 404 originally\ndeveloped ShadowPad, as the individuals named in the DOJ indictments were allegedly\ninvolved with developing malware used in their campaigns.\n\nIt is likely that only BRONZE ATLAS used ShadowPad until approximately 2019. Most of the\nShadowPad DLL loader samples can be clustered based on compile timestamps, C2\ninfrastructure, payload versions, DLL loader code overlap, and likely victimology. CTU\nresearchers identified multiple ShadowPad clusters used in campaigns since 2019 and\nattributed these clusters to distinct threat groups. These groups include BRONZE ATLAS and\nBRONZE UNIVERSITY, whose targeting suggests affiliation with the MSS. A third-party\nreport [suggests that BRONZE UNIVERSITY (referred to in the report as Earth Lusca) may](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/a/earth-lusca-employs-sophisticated-infrastructure-varied-tools-and-techniques/technical-brief-delving-deep-an-analysis-of-earth-lusca-operations.pdf)\nbe operating near to Chengdu in China after operational security mistakes revealed Chinabased infrastructure. Other ShadowPad clusters appear to reflect targeting aligned with PLA\ntheater command areas of responsibility.\n\n## PLA reforms\n\nIn late 2015, PRC leader Xi Jinping announced widespread reforms to the PLA that included\nthe establishment of the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF or SSF). This new branch\nfocuses on modernizing the PLA's capabilities in strategic frontiers of space, cyberspace,\nand the electromagnetic domain. The impact on the PLA's cyberespionage mission has been\nextensive. Many organizations responsible for cyberespionage and signals intelligence\n(SIGINT) associated with the Third Department of the PLA's General Staff Department\n(commonly known as 3PLA) have been absorbed into the SSF Network Systems\n[Department (NSD). The SSF NSD is also believed to be responsible for a broad range of](https://jamestown.org/program/the-peoples-liberation-army-strategic-support-force-update-2019/)\ninformation warfare capabilities beyond cyberespionage, coordinating electronic\ncountermeasures as well as offensive and defensive cyber projects. Figure 7 shows the likely\nSSF organizational structure.\n\n_Figure 7. PLA SSF likely organizational structure. (Source: Institute for National Strategic_\n_Studies)_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs part of the modernization, the PLA replaced its seven military regions with five theater\ncommands: Eastern, Southern, Western, Northern, and Central (see Figure 8). These theater\ncommands orchestrate ground, naval, air, and conventional missile forces for military\noperations in their geographic area of responsibility. While the exact area of responsibility for\n[each theater command is ambiguous, they are broadly](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/china/ChinaPerspectives-10.pdf) [responsible for specific threats within](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN33195-ATP_7-100.3-000-WEB-1.pdf)\ntheir respective regions:\n\nEastern Theater Command: Taiwan strait and East China sea\nSouthern Theater Command: South China sea\nNorthern Theater Command: Russia and the Korean peninsula\nWestern Theater Command: Central Asia and the Sino-Indian border\nCentral Theater Command: defends the capital and possibly provides support to other\ntheater commands\n\n_[Figure 8. PLA theater command structure. (Source: The Jamestown Foundation)](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Updated_The_PLA_s_New_Organizational_Structure_-_What_is_Known__Unknown_and_Speculation_Parts_1_and_2.pdf)_\n\nPrior to the PLA reforms, each military region maintained at least one Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau (TRB) to handle SIGINT and cyberespionage activities focused on\nthe military region's area of responsibility. The TRBs were [distinct from the former 3PLA units](https://project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf)\nthat were located across China, but they may have been tasked by the 3PLA.\n\nThe relationship between the TRBs and the theater commands is unclear. The TRBs may\n[have been consolidated under the SSF NSD alongside former 3PLA units. It is also possible](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0616.pdf)\nthat they continue to target countries in their area of responsibility but under the command\nand control of the SSF NSD.\n\n## Connections to PLA-linked threat groups\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers grouped distinct ShadowPad activity clusters by targeted geographic\nregions. Clusters align with the documented area of responsibility for three of the theater\ncommands: Northern, Southern, and Western. CTU researchers attribute some of the\nShadowPad activity to Chinese threat groups that have been publicly linked to specific PLA\nunits located in the corresponding theater commands:\n\n**Northern Theater Command: CTU researchers linked ShadowPad activity to**\n[BRONZE HUNTLEY and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-huntley) [BRONZE BUTLER, which are reportedly located in the](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-butler-targets-japanese-businesses)\nNorthern Theater Command. These threat groups deployed ShadowPad against\ntargets in South Korea, Russia, Japan, and Mongolia. These regions align with the\nNorthern Theater Command's focus. In 2021, CTU researchers observed malware and\ninfrastructure overlap between the two threat groups, suggesting close collaboration.\n**Western Theater Command: Some ShadowPad activity primarily targeted countries**\nneighboring China's western border, such as India and Afghanistan. CTU researchers\nclustered this activity based on attacker-controlled infrastructure, ShadowPad DLL\nloader variants such as ICEKILLER, and contextual information from third-party\n[sources. Third-party researchers linked some of these campaigns to an individual](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redfoxtrot-china-pla-targets-bordering-asian-countries/)\nworking on behalf of the Western Theater Command. CTU analysis did not reveal\nsufficient evidence to corroborate these claims, but the locations and victimology are\nconsistent with threat actors operating on behalf of the Western Theater Command.\n**Southern Theater Command: CTU researchers identified activity that used a specific**\nShadowPad version to target organizations in the South China Sea region. BRONZE\nGENEVA is likely responsible for part of this activity based on overlap between the C2\ninfrastructure for the Nebulae malware family associated with BRONZE GENEVA and a\nShadowPad sample analyzed by CTU researchers.\n\nThis attribution of ShadowPad campaigns to theater commands is based on the submitter's\nlocation for ShadowPad malware samples uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis service\n(potentially indicating the victim's country), the C2 domain names that appear to reference\nspecific regions (e.g., cloudvn. info suggests Vietnam targeting), contextual information\nregarding the activity and victimology, and the absence of evidence that ShadowPad\nsamples with the same attributes were deployed in other regions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEvidence available as of this publication suggests that ShadowPad has been deployed by\nMSS-affiliated threat groups, as well as PLA-affiliated threat groups that operate on behalf of\nthe regional theater commands. The malware was likely developed by threat actors affiliated\nwith BRONZE ATLAS and then shared with MSS and PLA threat groups around 2019. Given\nthe range of groups leveraging ShadowPad, all organizations that are likely targets for\nChinese threat groups should monitor for TTPs associated with this malware. Organizations\n\n\n-----\n\nwith operations in or connections to geographic regions covered by the regional theater\ncommands should specifically monitor for known TTPs associated with threat groups likely\naffiliated with the relevant theater command.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 2 can be used to detect activity related to this threat.
