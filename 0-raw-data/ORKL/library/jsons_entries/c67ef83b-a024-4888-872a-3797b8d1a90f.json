    "plain_text": "# The Operations of Winnti group\n\n## Threat Detection NTT Ltd. \n\n##### . TLP: WHITE . \n\n 29 April 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Operations of Winnti Group**\n\nThreat Detection NTT Ltd.\n\n### 1. Overview\n\nThreat actor Winnti Group tracked by NTT Security Threat Intelligence analysts as\n**Entity-1 (ENT-1) is a highly active group with many parallel operations mainly**\ntargeted towards entities in Asia. The definition and classification of activity originating\nfrom the Winnti group diverge between various security companies, what we label as\nENT-1 in this report overlaps activity classified by ESET and Dr Web as Winnti group\nin recent reporting [1][2][5].\n\nThe aim of this report is to offer a glimpse into the continuous Threat Intelligence\nefforts NTT Security are committed to on behalf of our clients, while also reporting on\npreviously unreported aspects of the ENT-1 group in contribution to the securitycommunities effort of laying the puzzle of ENT-1 activity.\n\nThis research has been possible by harnessing NTT’s owned and operated global tier1 IP backbones, together with correlation of data from targeted customers, internal\nresearch and open source intelligence (OSINT).\n\nThe timespan of this research is from December 2020 to April 2021 where the\nfollowing countries and regions has been observed as targets:\n\n_Figure 1 Targeted countries and regions December 2020 to April 2021_\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Operations of Winnti Group**\n\nThreat Detection NTT Ltd.\n\n### 2. Daily operations\n\nAnalysis of traffic towards ENT-1 infrastructure shows that the group is active during\noffice-hours in time zone UTC+6. Weekends normally lack any activity implying that\nthe group is truly a full-time funded APT group.\n\n_Figure 2 Intensity of ENT-1 activity in UTC+6_\n\nThe groups daily operations include the exploitation of servers running the GlassFish\nServer software version 3.1.2 and below as means for easy infrastructure expansion.\nThe exploited servers are then utilized during their operations:\n\n_Figure 1 ENT-1 GlassFish Workflow_\n\nCommonly deployed software includes the Web Vulnerability Scanner Acunitex and\nthe command-and-control product CobaltStrike.\n\n### 3. Acunitex activity\n\nThe web vulnerability scanning activity covers geographical sectors and industries\ntypically associated with the ENT-1 interest sphere. Our observation is a strong focus\non the Media sector located in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Travel and\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Operations of Winnti Group**\n\nThreat Detection NTT Ltd.\n\nTransportation companies operating out of Hong Kong. Government infrastructure in\nAustralia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Japan and Macao. Universities and telecom\noperators in Bahrain and Kuwait have also been targeted.\n\nFigure 3 Targeted industries\n\nWhile the scanning is targeted in respect to sector and geographical location it also\nappears to be opportunistic. Organisations which have been scanned by any of the\nAcunitex IPs listed in the IOC section should expect and protect from further intrusion\nattempts performed by ENT-1 and/or related APT groups which possibly have been\nprovided with the same target list.\n\n### 4. CobaltStrike infrastructure\n\nThe CobaltStrike infrastructure shows different variations of customization where\npublicly available (malleable) or default profiles are sometimes used but also more\nadvanced methods are observed. Typosquat domains and certificates are commonly\nutilized to make the traffic blend in. For example, a self-signed certificate imitating\nMicrosoft on 141.164.62.81 over port 443:\n\n_Figure 4 Self signed certificate on C2_\n\nThe CobaltStrike Command and Control (C2s) are often observed on compromised\nGlassfish servers. This could be due to CobaltStrike being utilized as the first layer\nbackdoor during campaigns where the more well-known ENT-1 utilized backdoors\nsuch as Shadowpad, Spyder and the Winnti backdoor are deployed as a second stage\npayload on interesting victims. This behaviour indicates that the Glassfish servers are\nseen as use-and-throw away C2s.\n\nMore ambitious efforts of CobaltStrike usage is a custom stager called Fishmaster\naccording to the embedded PDB path:\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Operations of Winnti Group**\n\nThreat Detection NTT Ltd.\n\n_Figure 5 PDB path for Browser_Plugin.exe_\n\nAvast classifies the sample as “Win64:BidenHappy-A [Apt]”, likely due to the\nembedded string:\n\n_Figure 6 Embedded string in Fishmaster sample_\n\nThe sample were hosted at hxxps://jquery-code[.]ml/Download/Browser_Plugin.exe\nand at the index page of the domain the html loads an iframe of code.jquery.com in\norder to appear legitimate:\n\n_Figure 7 Observed iframe usage_\n\nThe stager will request a pdf from a Cobalt Strike C2 on the URL path\nhxxp://37.61.205[.]212:8880/dow/Aili.pdf and store it to “C:\\Users\\Public\\Aili.pdf”. The\npdf holds a job-application in Mandarin for a Vietnamese individual:\n\n_Figure 8 Job application_\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Operations of Winnti Group**\n\nThreat Detection NTT Ltd.\n\nSecondly the stager will request the CobaltStrike related destination\nhxxp://micsoftin[.]us:2086/dow/83.dmp, part of the response is XOR encoded with the\nkey “misgat_mg” which the stager will decode and executed as shellcode. We have\nbeen unable to download the 83.dmp payload but explain the payload structure below:\n\n_Figure 9 Format of likely CobaltStrike beacon payload_\n\nThe use-case behind the downloaded pdf is unknown and we encourage fellow\nresearchers to explore it in depth for the possibility of it holding command and control\ntraffic. The adoption of Fishmaster still appears relatively low and it remains to be\nseen if it will become an integral of the groups toolset.\n\n### 5. Shadowpad, Spyder and Winnti backdoor utilization\n\nENT-1 extensively use Shadowpad, Spyder and the Winnti backdoor for long-running\noperations. It is not unseen that the group keep on using domains and IPs even after\nthey have publicly been reported, for example the following domains are still actively\nused even though they are publicly reported:\n\n     - livehost[.]live (Reported by ESET 31th Jan 2020 [1], still utilized Apr 2021)\n\n     - symantecupd[.]com (Reported by PTSecurity Jan 2021 [3], still used Apr 2021)\n\nENT-1 has also utilized snoc.hostingupdate[.]club which is reported by Dr Web as a\nSpyder C2, Spyder is a backdoor reported to be utilized by Winnti Group [5].\n\nGiven the large infrastructure overlaps and shared toolset utilization NTT Threat\nDetection assess ENT-1 to be part of Winnti Group.\n\n### 6. Breadcrumbs from other payloads\n\nThe likely GlassFish exploited server 168.138.137.235 appears to have been utilized\nas hosting-grounds for ENT-1 payloads. On Virustotal some samples are uploaded,\namong them a malicious lnk shortcut named “Business Registration_JHUAN SHUN\n_MOTOR CO., LTD.pdf.lnk” targeted towards a Taiwanese entity._\n\nPage 6 of 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Operations of Winnti Group**\n\nThreat Detection NTT Ltd.\n\nAnother clue towards Taiwanese targeting is a previously hosted self-extracting\narchive with “TW” in the filename:\n\n_Figure 10 flashplayerpp_install_tw.exe execution flow_\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\nENT-1 shows signs of being a full-time funded APT group with a continuously\ndiversified toolset and a growing network infrastructure to support their operations.\n\n### 8. How NTT Can help\n\nNTT Security Threat Intelligence researchers are monitoring **telemetry of suspicious**\n**traffic traversing our Global IP Network Service global tier-1 IPv4/IPv6 backbone**\nnetwork for threat indications.
