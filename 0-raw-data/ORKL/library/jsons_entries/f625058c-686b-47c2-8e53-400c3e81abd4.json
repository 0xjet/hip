The main tool\nused by the threat actors during these attacks is NetTraveler, a malicious program used for\ncovert computer surveillance.\n\nThe name NetTraveler comes from an internal string which is present in early versions of the\nmalware: NetTraveler Is Running! This malware is used by APT actors for basic surveillance\nof their victims. Earliest known samples have a timestamp of 2005, although references exist\nindicating activity as early as 2004. The largest number of samples we observed were\ncreated between 2010 and 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The NetTraveler builder icon_\n\nKnown targets of NetTraveler (also known as Travnet or Netfile) include Tibetan/Uyghur\nactivists, oil industry companies, scientific research centers and institutes, universities,\nprivate companies, governments and governmental institutions, embassies and military\ncontractors:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The NetTraveler victims map_\n\nThe following map lists the victim profiles by industry:\n\n_Note: this chart does not include the victims that couldnt be identified._\n\nKey findings on the NetTraveler attacks:\n\nThe highest number of infections was located in Mongolia, followed by India and\nRussia. In total, infections were identified in 40 countries including Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan, China, Tajikistan, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the United States,\nCanada, the United Kingdom, Chile, Morocco, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Ukraine,\nLithuania, Belarus, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Iran, Turkey, Pakistan,\nThailand, Qatar, and Jordan.\nThe group has infected victims across multiple industries including government\ninstitutions, embassies, oil and gas industry, research institutes, military contractors\nand activists.\nMost recently, the NetTraveler groups main domains of interest for cyber-espionage\nactivities include space exploration, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power,\nlasers, medicine and communications.\nDuring our research, we identified six victims that had been infected by both\n[NetTraveler and Red October.](https://securelist.com/the-red-october-campaign/57647/)\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky Labs products detect and neutralize the malicious programs and its variants\nused by the NetTraveler Toolkit, including Trojan-Spy.Win32.TravNet and\nDownloader.Win32.NetTraveler. Kaspersky Labs products detect the three Microsoft\nOffice exploits used in the spear-phishing attacks, including Exploit.MSWord.CVE2010-3333, Exploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.\n\nBased on collected intelligence, we estimate the group size to about 50 individuals, most of\nwhich speak Chinese natively and have working knowledge of the English language\nNetTraveler is designed to steal sensitive data as well as log keystrokes, and retrieve file\nsystem listings and various Office or PDF documents.\n\n**The NetTraveler Attacks – Part 1 (public):**\n\nExecutive summary\nAttack analysis\nC&C infrastructure\nStatistics\nMitigation\nConclusions\n\n[For more information, read our full paper TheNetTravelerAttacks, Part 1 [PDF]](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08080841/kaspersky-the-net-traveler-part1-final.pdf)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[NetTraveler](https://securelist.com/tag/nettraveler/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\n“NetTraveler is Running!” – Red Star APT Attacks Compromise High-Profile Victims\n\nYour email address will not be published.
