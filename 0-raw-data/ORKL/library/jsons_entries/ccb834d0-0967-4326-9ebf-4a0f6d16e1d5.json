Sectors targeted include telecommunications,\ngovernment, and information technology (IT). The capabilities of the tools, their custom development, and the\nvictims targeted, all suggest that Harvester is a nation-state-backed actor.\n\n## New toolset deployed\n\nThe most notable thing about this campaign is the previously unseen toolset deployed by the attackers.\n\nThe attackers deployed a custom backdoor called Backdoor.Graphon on victim machines alongside other\ndownloaders and screenshot tools that provided the attackers with remote access and allowed them to spy\non user activities and exfiltrate information.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe do not know the initial infection vector that Harvester used to compromise victim networks, but the first\nevidence we found of Harvester activity on victim machines was a malicious URL. The group then started to\ndeploy various tools, including its custom Graphon backdoor, to gain remote access to the network. The\ngroup also tried to blend its activity in with legitimate network traffic by leveraging legitimate CloudFront and\nMicrosoft infrastructure for its command and control (C&C) activity.\n\n**Tools used:**\n\nBackdoor.Graphon - custom backdoor that uses Microsoft infrastructure for its C&C activity\nCustom Downloader - uses Microsoft infrastructure for its C&C activity\nCustom Screenshotter - periodically logs screenshots to a file\n\nCobalt Strike Beacon - uses CloudFront infrastructure for its C&C activity (Cobalt Strike is an off-theshelf tool that can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes, or\nimpersonate other processes, and upload and download files)\nMetasploit - an off-the-shelf modular framework that can be used for a variety of malicious purposes on\nvictim machines, including privilege escalation, screen capture, to set up a persistent backdoor, and\nmore.\n\nThe custom downloader used by the attackers leverages the Costura Assembly Loader. Once on a victim\nmachine, it checks if the following file exists:\n\n[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\\winser.dll\n\nIf the file does not exist it downloads a copy from the following URL:\n\nhxxps://outportal[.]azurewebsites.net/api/Values_V2/Getting3210\n\nNext, the sample creates the following file if it does not exist:\n\n\"[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\\Microsoft Services[.]vbs\"\n\nThen it sets the following registry value to create a loadpoint:\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"MicrosoftSystemServices\"\n= \"[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\\Microsoft Services[.]vbs\"\n\nFinally it opens an embedded web browser within its own UI using the following URL:\n\nhxxps://usedust[.]com\n\nWhile it initially appeared that this URL may have been a loadpoint for Backdoor.Graphon, upon further\ninvestigation it appears to be a decoy to confuse any affected users.\n\nBackdoor.Graphon is compiled as a .NET PE DLL with export “Main” and the following PDB file name:\n\nD:\\OfficeProjects\\Updated Working Due to Submission\\4.5\\Outlook_4.5\\Outlook 4.5.2 32 bit New\nwithout presistancy\\NPServices\\bin\\x86\\Debug\\NPServices[.]pdb\n\nWhen this is executed, it attempts to communicate with the attackers’ C&C servers, which are hosted on\nMicrosoft infrastructure.\n\nhxxps://microsoftmsdn[.]azurewebsites.net/api/Values_V1/AuthAsyncComplete_V1?Identity=\n\n[INFECTION_ID]\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://microsoftsgraphapi[.]azurewebsites.net/api/Values_V1/AuthAsyncComplete_V1?Identity=\n\n[INFECTION_ID]\nhxxps://msdnmicrosoft.azurewebsites[.]net/api/Values_V1/AuthAsyncComplete_V1?Identity=\n\n[INFECTION_ID]\n\nThe attackers then run commands to control their input stream and capture the output and error streams.\nThey also periodically send GET requests to the C&C server, with the content of any returned messages\nextracted and then deleted.\n\nData that cmd.exe pulled from the output and error streams is encrypted and sent back to the attackers’\nservers.\n\nThe custom screenshot tool was also packed with the Costura Assembly Loader. The screenshot tool takes\nphotos that it saves to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration, with all archives older than a week\ndeleted.\n\n## Ongoing activity\n\nWhile we do not have enough evidence yet to attribute Harvester’s activity to a specific nation state, the\ngroup’s use of custom backdoors, the extensive steps taken to hide its malicious activity, and its targeting all\npoint to it being a state-sponsored actor. Harvester’s use of legitimate infrastructure to host its C&C servers in\norder to blend in with normal network traffic is one example of the stealthy steps taken by this actor.\n\nThe targeting of organizations in Afghanistan in this campaign is also interesting given the huge upheaval\nseen in that country recently. The activity carried out by Harvester makes it clear the purpose of this\ncampaign is espionage, which is the typical motivation behind nation-state-backed activity.\n\nThat Harvester’s most recent activity was seen earlier this month means that organizations in the sectors and\ngeographies mentioned should be alert to the malicious activity outlined in this blog.\n\n## Protection\n\nFile based:\n\nBackdoor.Graphon\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n0740cc87a7d028ad45a3d54540b91c4d90b6fc54d83bb01842cf23348b25bc42\n\n303f93cc47c58e64665f9e447ac11efe5b83f0cfe4253f3ff62dd7504ee935e0\n\n3c34c23aef8934651937c31be7420d2fc8a22ca260f5afdda0f08f4d3730ae59\n\n3c8fa5cc50eb678d9353c9f94430eeaa74b36270c13ba094dc5c124259f0dc31\n\n470cd1645d1da5566eef36c6e0b2a8ed510383657c4030180eb0083358813cd3\n\n691e170c5e42dd7d488b9d47396b633a981640f8ab890032246bf37704d4d865\n\na4935e31150a9d6cd00c5a69b40496fea0e6b49bf76f123ea34c3b7ea6f86ce6\n\n\n-----\n\nc4b6d7e88a63945f3e0768657e299d2d3a4087266b4fc6b1498e2435e311f5d1\n\ncb5e40c6702e8fe9aa64405afe462b76e6fe9479196bb58118ee42aba0641c04\n\nd84a9f7b1d70d83bd3519c4f2c108af93b307e8f7457e72e61f3fa7eb03a5f0d\n\nf4a77e9970d53fe7467bdd963e8d1ce44a2d74e3e4262cd55bb67e7b3001c989\n\n**URL**\n\nhxxps://perfect-couple.com/perfectcouple[.]exe – sample was downloaded from this address\n\n**_BLOG UPDATED 2.45pm, October 18, 2021: Minor updates made for clarity_**\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate\ntargeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers\nrespond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
