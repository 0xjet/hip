A full investigation\nhas been launched and is continuing. In the meantime, we have notified the relevant\nauthorities,\" Merseyrail told BleepingComputer yesterday after we received a mysterious\nemail earlier this month from the account of Andy Heath, the Director of Merseyrail.\n\n## Ransomware gang uses Merseyrail's email system against them\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the cyberattack has not been publicly disclosed, BleepingComputer learned of the\nattack after receiving a strange email on April 18th from Heith's email account with the mail\nsubject, \"Lockbit Ransomware Attack and Data Theft.\"\n\nThis email was sent to BleepingComputer, various UK newspapers, and the staff of\nMerseyrail in what appears to be a takeover of the Director's @merseyrail.org Office 365\nemail account by the Lockbit Ransomware gang.\n\nIn this email, the threat actors pretended to be Merseyrail's Director telling employees that a\nprevious weekend's outage was downplayed and that they suffered a ransomware attack\nwhere the hackers stole employee and customer data.\n\nIncluded in the email is a link to an image showing an employee's personal information that\nLockbit allegedly stole during the attack.\n\nAfter numerous attempts to contact Merseryrail and confirm the attack, we finally received\nthe rail network's statement last night.\n\n\"It would be inappropriate for us to comment further while the investigation is underway,\"\nMerseyrail told BleepingComputer when we questioned how the Director's email was\ncompromised.\n\nIn response to our queries, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) also confirmed\nthat Merseyrail made them aware of the \"incident.\"\n\n\"Merseyrail has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information\nprovided,\" the ICO told BleepingComputer via email.\n\n## Ransomware gangs aggressively extort victims\n\nOver the past year, ransomware gangs have become increasingly aggressive in their\nextortion tactics.\n\nIn the past, ransomware attacks consisted of threat actors stealing victims' data and then\nencrypting their files to force a ransom payment.\n\nOver time, threat actor's tactics have escalated to [performing DDoS attacks on victims'](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/)\n[networks and websites, emailing customers and journalists, and threatening to contact stock](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-urges-victims-customers-to-demand-a-ransom-payment/)\nexchanges.\n\nSadly, while these attacks are ongoing, the employees and customers are usually the last to\nknow what is happening with their data and organization.\n\nUsing a victim's email system to promote their attacks to both employees, journalists, and\ncustomers could turn that on its head.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
