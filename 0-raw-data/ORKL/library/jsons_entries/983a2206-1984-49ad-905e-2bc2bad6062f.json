    "plain_text": "# Treasury Escalates Sanctions Against the Russian Government’s Attempts to Influence U.S. Elections\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126**\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) took sweeping action against 16 entities and 16 individuals who attempted to\ninfluence the 2020 U.S. presidential election at the direction of the leadership of the Russian\nGovernment.\n\nThis announcement follows the Intelligence Community’s (IC) “Assessment of Foreign\nThreats to the 2020 U.S. Federal Elections.” The IC assessment addresses the intentions\nand efforts of key foreign actors, including Russia, to influence or interfere with the U.S.\nelections and undermine public confidence in the election process. Russia employed a\nsystem of government officials, disinformation outlets, and companies to covertly influence\nU.S. voters and spread misinformation about U.S. political candidates and U.S. election\nprocesses and institutions.\n\n“Treasury will target Russian leaders, officials, intelligence services, and their proxies that\nattempt to interfere in the U.S. electoral process or subvert U.S. democracy,” said Secretary\nJanet L. Yellen. “This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior.”\n\nToday’s actions highlight how multiple Russian officials, proxies, and intelligence agencies\ncoordinated to interfere with recent U.S. elections. Private and public sector corruption\nfacilitated by President Vladimir Putin has enriched his network of confidants, who used their\nillicit business connections to advance Russia’s campaign to undermine the 2020 U.S.\n\n\n-----\n\npresidential election—and to give Russia plausible deniability in its disinformation activities.\nMembers of this network include First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration\nof Russia Alexei Gromov (Gromov), previously designated as a government official\npursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13661. Gromov leads the Kremlin’s use of its media\napparatus that sought to exacerbate tensions in the United States by discrediting the 2020\nU.S. election process. As a result, Treasury is designating Gromov pursuant to E.O. 13848\nfor having attempted to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n## TREASURY TARGETS DISINFORMATION OUTLETS CONTROLLED BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES\n\nRussian Intelligence Services, namely the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Main\nIntelligence Directorate (GRU), and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), play critical roles\nin propagating Russian disinformation online. The FSB, GRU, and SVR operate a network of\nwebsites that obscure their Russian origin to appeal to Western audiences. Outlets operated\nby Russian Intelligence Services focus on divisive issues in the United States, denigrate U.S.\npolitical candidates, and disseminate false and misleading information. The GRU and FSB\nwere first designated in 2016.\n\nThe FSB directly operates disinformation outlets. SouthFront is an online disinformation site\nregistered in Russia that receives taskings from the FSB. It attempts to appeal to military\nenthusiasts, veterans, and conspiracy theorists, all while going to great lengths to hide its\nconnections to Russian intelligence. In the aftermath of the 2020 U.S. presidential election,\nSouthFront sought to promote perceptions of voter fraud by publishing content alleging that\nsuch activity took place during the 2020 U.S. presidential election cycle.\n\n**NewsFront is a Crimea-based disinformation and propaganda outlet that worked with FSB**\nofficers to coordinate a narrative that undermined the credibility of a news website\nadvocating for human rights. Part of NewsFront’s plan was to utilize Alexander Malkevich,\nwho is also being re-designated in today’s action, to further disseminate disinformation.\nNewsFront was also used to distribute false information about the COVID-19 vaccine, which\nfurther demonstrates the irresponsible and reckless conduct of Russian disinformation sites.\n\nThe Strategic Culture Foundation (SCF) is an online journal registered in Russia that is\ndirected by the SVR and closely affiliated with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SCF is\ncontrolled by the SVR’s Directorate MS (Active Measures) and created false and\nunsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials involved in the 2020 U.S. presidential\nelection. It publishes conspiracy theorists, giving them a broader platform to spread\ndisinformation, while trying to obscure the Russian origins of the journal so that readers may\nbe more likely to trust the sourcing.\n\nThe GRU operates InfoRos. InfoRos calls itself a news agency but is primarily run by the\nGRU’s 72nd Main Intelligence Information Center (GRITs). GRITs is a unit within Russia’s\nInformation Operations Troops, which is identified as Russia’s military force for conducting\n\n\n-----\n\ncyber espionage, influence, and offensive cyber operations. InfoRos operates under two\norganizations, “InfoRos, OOO” and “IA InfoRos.” InfoRos used a network of websites,\nincluding nominally independent websites, to spread false conspiracy narratives and\ndisinformation promoted by GRU officials. Denis Tyurin (Tyurin) held a leadership role in\nInfoRos and had previously served in the GRU.\n\nTreasury designated SouthFront and the Strategic Culture Foundation pursuant to E.O.\n13848 for having engaged in foreign interference in the U.S. 2020 presidential election.\nSouthFront was also designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, and E.O. 13382 for\nacting on behalf of the FSB. NewsFront was designated pursuant to the Countering\nAmerica’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), E.O. 13694, and E.O. 13382 for\nacting on behalf of the FSB.\n\nTreasury also designated InfoRos, OOO, IA InfoRos, and Tyurin pursuant to CAATSA, E.O.\n13694, and E.O. 13382 for acting on behalf of the GRU.\n\nMore guidance specific to disinformation and election interference can be found on the\nwebsite of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\n## TREASURY FURTHER TARGETS YEVGENIY PRIGOZHIN’S NETWORK IN AFRICA\n\nYevgeniy Prigozhin (Prigozhin) is the Russian financier of the Internet Research Agency\n(IRA), the Russian troll farm that OFAC designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 in 2018 for\ninterfering in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin has been designated pursuant to E.O.s\n13848 13694 and 13661\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian national Alexander Malkevich (Malkevich) and his company, the Foundation for\n**National Values Protection (FZNC), have facilitated Prigozhin’s global influence operations**\nsince at least 2019. Malkevich, who was previously designated in 2018 pursuant to E.O.\n13694 for directing USAReally, another designated Prigozhin-financed influence entity, has\ncontinued to support Prigozhin’s disinformation operations. Malkevich runs the FZNC\nwebsite. Malkevich utilized the FZNC website along with other Prigozhin operatives to\nspread messages on behalf of Prigozhin. Prigozhin has evolved from simply providing\nfinancial support to his global disinformation network to also writing content to denigrate the\nU.S. electoral process. Malkevich and the FZNC were designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848,\n13694, and 13661 for supporting Prigozhin’s global influence operations. FZNC was also\ndesignated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for being owned or controlled by Malkevich.\n\nThe Association For Free Research And International Cooperation (AFRIC),\n**International Anticrisis Center, and Russian nationals Petr Byschkov (Byschkov), Yulia**\n**Afanasyeva (Afanasyeva), and Taras Pribyshin (Pribyshin) facilitate Prigozhin’s malign**\noperations in Africa and Europe while primarily operating from Russia. AFRIC has served as\na front company for Prigozhin’s influence operations in Africa, including by sponsoring phony\nelection monitoring missions in Zimbabwe, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, South Africa, and Mozambique. Despite posing as an African-led initiative, AFRIC\nserves to disseminate Russia’s preferred messaging, often related to disinformation. AFRIC\nworks in coordination with other elements of the Prigozhin network, including FZNC and the\nInternational Anticrisis Center, a fraudulent think tank controlled by Prigozhin’s operatives.\nByschkov manages Prigozhin’s “Africa Back Office,” a team of political consultants tasked\nwith devising strategies for manipulating African politics in support of Prigozhin’s interests.\nAfanasyeva, an employee of the “Africa Back Office,” ran AFRIC and the International\nAnticrisis Center. Pribyshin has conducted influence operations in Africa for the IRA in\nsupport of Prigozhin’s objectives in the region since at least 2019.\n\nAFRIC, International Anticrisis Center, Byschkov, Afanasyeva, and Pribyshin were\ndesignated pursuant to E.O.s 13848, 13694, and 13661 for their roles in Prigozhin’s\noperations.\n\n## TREASURY FURTHER TARGETS YEVGENIY PRIGOZHIN’S ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SANCTIONS\n\nIn addition, Prigozhin uses a complex network of shell and front companies to evade U.S.\nsanctions and to obscure his ownership in property. In 2019, two Russia-based companies,\n**Trans Logistik, OOO (Trans Logistik) and OOO** **Yunidzhet (Yunidzhet), acted as covert**\nprocurement agents for Prigozhin to obtain aircraft related parts and maintenance. Trans\nLogistik obfuscated the ownership of Prigozhin’s blocked property, including the previously\nidentified aircraft that is blocked property, M-VITO, while Yunidzhet provided management\nservices to another previously identified aircraft that is blocked property, M-SAAN. Artem\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stepanov (Stepanov) is the Deputy General Director of Yunidzhet. Maria Zueva is the**\nGeneral Director of Yunidzhet. Kirill Shcherbakov is Yunidzhet’s ultimate owner and also\nowns OOO Alkon, a company with close ties to Yunidzhet.\n\nTrans Logistik and Yunidzhet were designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848, 13694 and 13661\nfor supporting Prigozhin. Stepanov, Zueva, and Shcherbakov were also designated pursuant\nto E.O.s 13848, 13694, and 13661 for acting on behalf of Yunidzhet. OOO Alkon was\ndesignated pursuant to E.O.s 13848, 13694, and 13661 for being owned by Stepanov.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for\ninformation leading to the arrest of Prigozhin.\n\n## TREASURY TARGETS IRA ENABLER\n\nPakistan-based Second Eye Solution (SES), also known as Forwarderz, is an organization\nthat specializes in creating and selling fraudulent identities and has assisted the IRA in\nconcealing its identity to evade sanctions. Since at least 2012, SES engaged in a scheme to\nprovide digital photographs of fake documents including passports, driver’s licenses, bank\nstatements, utility bills, and national identity documents. SES markets these fake documents\nfor use to verify online accounts including money service business accounts and social\nmedia website accounts. In 2017, the IRA purchased 15 fraudulent U.S. driver licenses\nimages from SES. The purchased licenses were used as supporting documents for online\nsocial media accounts opened by the IRA.\n\n\n-----\n\nPakistani Nationals Mohsin Raza, Mujtaba **Raza, Syed** **Hasnain, Muhammad** **Hayat, Syed**\n**Raza, and Shahzad Ahmed are the owners and employees who were instrumental in**\nprocessing payment for fraudulent identities. Fresh Air Farm House, Like Wise, and MK\n**Softtech are four Pakistani front companies used to launder SES profits.**\n\nThe fraudulent documents produced by SES are likely used at many online services to\nevade sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) screening protocols beyond what OFAC\nhas been able to identify. SES advertises that their fraudulent documents may be used on\nsocial media, freelancing job postings, and commerce platforms.\n\nAs part of today’s listing of SES on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked\nPersons List (SDN List), OFAC is also identifying digital currency addresses used by SES to\nfulfill customer orders in order to help assist financial institutions, and their third-party identity\nverification services, in identifying customers on their platforms who have purchased\nfraudulent identity documents. Known SES digital currency addresses have received over\n$2.5 million in digital currencies over more than 26,900 transactions from 2013 to March\n2021.\n\nSES was designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848 and 13694, for acting on behalf of the IRA.\nMohsin Raza, Mujtaba Raza, Seyed Hasnain, Muhammad Hayat, Syed Raza, and Shahzad\nAhmed were designated pursuant to E.O.s 13848 and 13694, for acting for or on behalf of\nSES. Fresh Air Farm House, Like Wise, and MK Softtech were designated pursuant to E.O.s\n13848 and 13694, for being owned or controlled by Mohsin Raza and Mujtaba Raza.\n\n## TREASURY TARGETS KNOWN RUSSIAN AGENT KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK\n\n**Konstantin Kilimnik (Kilimnik) is a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant and known**\nRussian Intelligence Services agent implementing influence operations on their behalf.\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, Kilimnik provided the Russian\nIntelligence Services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy.\nAdditionally, Kilimnik sought to promote the narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered\nin the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2018, Kilimnik was indicted on charges of\nobstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice regarding unregistered lobbying\nwork. Kilimnik has also sought to assist designated former President of Ukraine Viktor\nYanukovych. At Yanukovych’s direction, Kilimnik sought to institute a plan that would return\nYanukovych to power in Ukraine.\n\nKilimnik was designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for having engaged in foreign interference in\nthe U.S. 2020 presidential election. Kilimnik was also designated pursuant to E.O. 13660 for\nacting for or on behalf of Yanukovych. Yanukovych, who is currently hiding in exile in Russia,\nwas designated in 2014 pursuant to E.O. 13660 for his role in violating Ukrainian\nsovereignty.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of\nKilimnik.\n\n## SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs a result of today’s designations, all property and interests in property of these targets that\nare subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from\nengaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or more owned by\none or more designated persons are also blocked. In addition, financial institutions and other\npersons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and\nindividuals may expose themselves to secondary sanctions or be subject to an enforcement\naction.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence election interference report can be found\non its website.\n\n[View more information on the persons designated today.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20210415)\n\n\n-----",
