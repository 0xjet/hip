In this blog entry, we discuss the findings from our\nown technical analysis of this variant and its behaviors, many of which are similar to those of the BlackMatter\nransomware.\n\nBy: Ivan Nicole Chavez, Byron Gelera, Katherine Casona, Nathaniel Morales, Ieriz Nicolle Gonzalez, Nathaniel\nGregory Ragasa\nJuly 25, 2022\nRead time: ( words)\n\nIn March 2022, less than a year after [LockBit 2.0 first emerged, researchers caught wind of an upcoming new](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html)\nvariant of the [LockBit](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit) [ransomware.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/ransomware) [LockBit 3.0, aka](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1541156954214727685) [“LockBit Black,” wouldn’t be unveiled until late June, coinciding](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1528801206923141122)\nwith the launch of the group’s new leak site and bug bounty program. A researcher has since shared a sample of\nLockBit 3.0, along with his initial analysis of the new variant.\n\nUsing the packer identifier utility Detect It Easy, we found that this particular LockBit 3.0 sample is a Win32 .exe file\n[with multiple sections packed with an unknown packer (Figure 1). According to the original source of the sample, the](https://twitter.com/WhichbufferArda/status/1544339062089084928)\nmalware uses this argument for execution:\n\n_{04830965-76E6-6A9A-8EE1-6AF7499C1D08}.exe -k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted -pass_\n_db66023ab2abcb9957fb01ed50cdfa6a_\n\nThe LockBit 3.0 sample then drops an .ico file with the same file name as the one appended to the encrypted files in\nthe %PROGRAMDATA% folder (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe file properties of LockBit 3.0\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The .ico file in the %PROGRAMDATA%\n\nfolder\nAs part of its encryption process, LockBit 3.0 appends the extension HLJkNskOq (Figure 3) and changes the icons\nof encrypted files to that of the aforementioned .ico file.\n\nFigure 3. The encrypted files with new file\n\nnames and extensions, along with LockBit’s ransom note\nThe ransomware then drops its ransom note (Figure 4), which references “Ilon Musk” and the European Union’s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Lastly, it changes the wallpaper of the victim’s machine to inform them\nof the ransomware attack (Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\ncontents of LockBit 3.0’s ransom note\n\n3.0\n\n## Similarities to BlackMatter ransomware\n\n\nFigure 4. The\n\nFigure 5. The desktop wallpaper applied by LockBit\n\n\nResearchers have pointed out that portions of LockBit 3.0’s code seem to be borrowed from the BlackMatter\nransomware, hence the nickname LockBit Black. Likewise, we found similarities between BlackMatter and the new\n[LockBit variant during our debugging of the LockBit 3.0 sample. From our examination of the unpacked sample and](https://twitter.com/cPeterr/status/1543692271186579459)\n[an analysis provided by the researcher Chuong Dong we discovered that LockBit 3 0 requires a pass parameter to](https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2021/09/05/BlackMatterRansomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\ndecrypt its main routine (Figure 6). Other ransomware families like Egregor have been observed exhibiting this same\nbehavior, where an argument is required to proceed with the routine. This makes the binary harder to reverse if the\nparameter is not available.\n\nFigure 6. Decrypting\n\nsections using a -pass argument\nLockBit 3.0 performs API harvesting by hashing the API names of a DLL, and then comparing it to the list of the APIs\nthat the ransomware needs (Figure 7). This routine is identical to that of BlackMatter (Figure 8), as the externally\navailable script for renaming BlackMatter’s APIs also works for LockBit 3.0 (Figures 9 and 10).\n\nFigure 7.\n\nLockBit 3.0’s routine for API harvesting\n\n\n-----\n\nharvesting\n\nAPIs\n\n\nFigure 8. BlackMatter’s routine for API\n\nFigure 9. The XOR key LockBit 3.0 uses for renaming\n\nFigure 10. The XOR key BlackMatter uses for renaming\n\n\nAPIs\nInstead of directly calling the addresses of the harvested APIs, LockBit 3.0 implements a trampoline pointer (Figure\n11) to go to an allocated heap that contains a disassembly code that will then jump to the API address of the\n_NtTerminateProcess API (Figure 12). The code contained in the heap is randomly chosen from this set of codes:_\n\nROR by random number\nROL by random number\nXOR to key\nROR by random number, then XOR to key\nROL by random number, then XOR to key\n\n\n-----\n\nLockBit 3.0’s trampoline pointer code\n\n\nFigure 11.\n\nFigure\n\n\n12. LockBit 3.0’s trampoline call to the NtTerminateProcess API\nLockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter also implement the same antidebugging technique: Both set the thread information to\n_ThreadHideFromDebugger (0x11) via the NtSetThreadInformation API (Figure 13) to cause any debuggers to crash_\nif a breakpoint is placed on this thread.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n13. ThreadHideFromDebugger via NtSetThreatInformation\nLike BlackMatter, LockBit 3.0 employs threading when using an API instead of directly calling an API, which is likely\nan attempt to make it more difficult for researchers to analyze. The strings it uses are decrypted using a simple\nbitwise-XOR routine (Figure 14), a bitwise-XOR and NOT routine (Figure 15), or a decryption routine involving a\nlinear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm to generate a pseudorandom key (Figure 16). This is also similar to\nhow BlackMatter operates, except for the addition of the bitwise-XOR and NOT routine.\n\nFigure\n\n14. LockBit 3.0’s bitwise-XOR routine for string decryption\n\nFigure\n\n15. LockBit 3.0’s bitwise-XOR and NOT for string decryption\n\nFigure\n\n16. LockBit’s 3.0 string decryption using an LCG algorithm\nLockBit 3.0’s configurations (Table 1) are decrypted using the same XOR routine and keys obtained from an LCG\npseudorandom number generator, and then decompressed using a compression library called APLib.\n\n**Configuration** **Description**\n\nPUB_KEY[0x80] RSA public key\n\n\n-----\n\nVICT_ID[0x10] Victim ID (This is based on BlackMatter’s code, but is not used by LockBit 3.0.)\n\nAES_KEY[0x10] AES_KEY for the command-and-control (C&C) server (This is based on BlackMatter’s code,\nbut is not used by LockBit 3.0.)\n\nFLAGS[0x18] Flags for specific routines\n\nOFFSET_ARRAY Array of the offset of Base64-encoded strings from this address (The length of the array is\nequal to the first value.)\n\nBASE64_STRING Array of Base64-encoded strings, which includes:\n\nHashes of folders, files, and extensions to avoid\nHashes of computer names to avoid\nServices and processes to kill\nA list of C&C servers\nAdmin credentials\nThe ransom note\n\nTable 1. A list of LockBit 3.0’s configurations\nLockBit 3.0 also checks the victim machine’s UI language to avoid infecting machines with these languages:\n\nArabic (Syria)\nArmenian (Armenia)\nAzerbaijani (Cyrillic Azerbaijan)\nAzerbaijani (Latin Azerbaijan)\nBelarusian (Belarus)\nGeorgian (Georgia)\nKazakh (Kazakhstan)\nKyrgyz (Kyrgyzstan)\nRomanian (Moldova)\nRussian (Moldova)\nRussian (Russia)\nTajik (Cyrillic Tajikistan)\nTurkmen (Turkmenistan)\nTatar (Russia)\nUkranian (Ukraine)\nUzbek (Cyrillic Uzbekistan)\nUzbek (Latin Uzbekistan)\n\nLockBit 3.0 also retains these BlackMatter routines for privilege escalation:\n\nUses UACMe’s method of bypassing user account control (UAC), which is to use the ICMLuaUtil COM\ninterface under dllhost.exe\nDuplicates the Explorer.exe token for its own use\nPerforms a 32-bit or 64-bit shellcode injection to elevate its token\n\nThe string that both LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter use as the encrypted file name extension, ransom note name, and\nwallpaper and icon name is a Base64-encoded hash (Figure 17). However, a key difference between the two pieces\nof ransomware is that LockBit 3.0 opts to use an RSA public key embedded in its configuration and hash it with\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5, whereas BlackMatter uses a MachineGUID hashed using the same algorithm for APIs. This makes the string\nsimilar for all machines infected by the same sample, which is likely an attempt by LockBit’s operators to make it\neasier for them to identify which RSA private key pair is needed for an encrypted file.\n\nFigure 17. The string generation for BlackMatter\n\n(left) and LockBit 3.0 (right)\nLike BlackMatter, LockBit 3.0 also performs these routines:\n\nAttempts to log in using credentials from its configuration list to determine if the compromised system is a part\nof the domain admin that it will use for later routines\nTerminates and deletes processes and services from its configuration list, a routine similar to that of\nBlackMatter\nWipes the recyle bin folder of every drive\nChecks a list of computer name hashes to avoid from its configuration list\nConnects to the C&C server from its configuration list if the flag is set\nEncrypts network shares and Exchange Mailbox if set in its configuration flag\nObtains a list of files, folders, and extensions to be avoided from its configuration list\nUses pointed files when encrypting .lnk files\nPrints the ransom note on any available printers and modifies the desktop wallpaper\nUses the same encryption algorithm as BlackMatter\n\nLockBit 3.0’s deletion of shadow copies (Figure 18) is clearly lifted from BlackMatter’s code, as this is performed\nusing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) through COM objects, as opposed to LockBit 2.0’s use of\n_vssadmin.exe._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n18. LockBit 3.0’s deletion of shadow copies via WMI\nThis latest LockBit iteration performs some routines only if a specific argument is provided. LockBit 3.0 accepts only\nthe arguments listed in Table 2, while BlackMatter accepts only the -safe, -wall, and -path arguments.\n\n**Argument** **Description**\n\n\n-pass\n{value}\n\n\nUses the first 32 characters of the value as a key to decrypt the main routine (This is required for the\nransomware to execute properly.)\n\n\n-safe Reboots in SafeBoot\n\n-wall Only sets the ransomware wallpaper and prints the ransom note on printers\n\n\n-path\n{target}\n\n\nSpecifically encrypts the target, which can be a file or folder\n\n\n-gspd Performs group policy modification for lateral movement\n\n-psex Performs lateral movement via admin shares\n\n-gdel Deletes group policy updates\n\n-del Deletes itself\n\nTable 2. A list of arguments that LockBit 3.0 accepts\nThe new LockBit variant checks arguments using hashing and based on the code. It’s designed to perform only one\nroutine from the arguments except for -pass, which needs to be performed before the other arguments can be\nchecked. The routines to print the ransom note and change the victim machine’s wallpaper is also similar to\nBlackMatter’s routines if the -wall argument is provided. Like BlackMatter, LockBit 3.0 can also restart in safe mode\nand execute via the RunOnce registry, as long as the -safe argument is provided.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, there is one key difference between their configuration flags: BlackMatter has only nine flags while LockBit\n3.0 has 24, as detailed in Table 3.\n\n**Configuration flag** **Description**\n\nENCRYPT_LARGE_FILE­_FLAG If set, a large file will be included in the encryption routine.\n\nRANDOM_FILE NAME_FLAG If set, encrypted files will be renamed to random file names.\n\nATTEMPT_LOGON_FLAG If set, a login attempt will be made using credentials from\nLockBit 3.0’s configuration list, and the credentials will be\nsaved if these have domain admin rights.\n\nEXCLUDE_HIDDEN_FLAG If set, hidden files will not be encrypted.\n\nCHECK_UI_LANGUAGE_FLAG If set, the victim machine’s UI language will be checked and\nthe ransomware will terminate if the machine is from any of\nthe avoided countries.\n\nMOUNT_VOL_ENC_EXCHANGE_SERVER_FLAG If set, all volumes for encryption will be mounted and\navailable exchange servers will be encrypted.\n\nENC_SHARED_FLAG If set, shared folders will be encrypted.\n\nTERMINATE_PROCESS_FLAG If set, processes from LockBit 3.0’s configuration list will be\nterminated.\n\nDELETE_SERVICE_FLAG If set, services from LockBit 3.0’s configuration list will be\ndeleted.\n\nCREATE_MUTEX_FLAG If set, a check will be done to see whether mutex is already\ncreated and the ransomware will terminate if it is.\n\nPRINT_RANSOM_NOTE_FLAG If set, the ransom note will be printed on available printers.\n\nCHANGE_WALLPAPER_FLAG If set, the victim’s wallpaper will be changed.\n\nCHANGE_ICON_FLAG If set, the icons of encrypted files will be changed.\n\nCONNECT_TO_CNC_FLAG If set, communication will be done with a C&C server from\nLockBit 3.0’s configuration list.\n\nDELETE_SELF_FLAG If set, the ransomware will delete itself using a dropped .tmp\nfile.\n\nDELETE_AV_SERVICE_FLAG If set, AV services matching the hashes will be terminated.\n\n\n-----\n\nCREATE_TEMP_MAX_DISKSPACE If set, another .tmp file (from the same .tmp file used in\n_DELETE_SELF_FLAG flag) will be created on each drive_\nwith random contents and sizes based on DiskFreeSpace.\n\nHAS_ADMIN_CRED_FLAG If set, an attempt will be made to use admin credentials\nobtained from the ATTEMPT_LOGON_FLAG flag.\n\nRUN_AS_ADMIN_FLAG If set, commands will be executed as admin using\ncredentials from the ATTEMPT_LOGON_FLAG flag.\n\nFORCE_GPUPDATE_VIA_POWERSHELL_FLAG If set, group policy updates will be forced on all active\ndirectories using a PowerShell command.\n\nDELETE_TEMP_FLAG If set, the same .tmp file used in the DELETE_SELF_FLAG\nflag will be deleted via MoveFileExW and the victim\nmachine will be restarted.\n\nDISABLE_EVENTLOG_FLAG If set, EventLog will be disabled via registry and service.\n\nDELETE_GPO_FLAG If set and the -gspd parameter is used, the victim machine’s\nsleep time will be set to 1 minute before performing routines\nthat will delete group policy updates.\n\nUNUSED_FLAG An extra flag that’s not used in the analyzed binary (or\npossibly an indicator of the end of flags).\n\nTable 3. The flags that can be set in LockBit 3.0’s configuration\nOne notable behavior for this third LockBit version is its file deletion technique: Instead of using cmd.exe to execute\na batch file or command that will perform the deletion, it drops and executes a .tmp file decrypted from the binary. It\nhas, however, retained some of LockBit 2.0’s features, like the earlier version’s ability for lateral movement through a\ngroup policy update, as long as there is a -gspd parameter provided.\n\nThe executed .tmp file overwrites the contents of the ransomware binary and then renames the binary multiple times\n(Figure 19), with the new file names based on the length of the original file name. For example, a file named 1.exe,\nwhich has five characters (including the file name extension), is renamed as AAAAA, and then BBBBB, up to ZZZZZ.\nAfter renaming the file, LockBit 3.0 finally deletes it (Figure 20). This routine is probably the LockBit ransomware\ngroup’s attempt to avoid recovery by forensic tools and cover their tracks by completely removing any trace of the\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n19.

LockBit 3.0 deleting the ransomware file after renaming it repeatedly\n\n## LockBit 3.0 on VirusTotal\n\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\n\n[A researcher recently spotted another LockBit 3.0 sample on VirusTotal (Figure 21), with 19 detections at the time of](https://twitter.com/petrovic082/status/1549626142142898177)\nthis writing. This specific sample is a PowerShell script containing two layers of obfuscated code (Figures 22 and\n23). After deobfuscating the script (Figure 24), we found that LockBit 3.0 is capable of injecting a DLL into memory\nvia reflective loading (Figure 25), using code that is identical to BlackMatter’s own PowerShell code (Figure 26).\n\nFigure 21. A LockBit 3.0 sample found on VirusTotal as of July 21, 2022\n\nFigure 22. The first layer of LockBit 3.0’s obfuscated code\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. The second layer of LockBit 3.0’s obfuscated code\n\nFigure 24. LockBit 3.0’s deobfuscated PowerShell script\n\nFigure 25. LockBit 3.0’s main function\n\nFigure 26. BlackMatter’s main function\nThis particular sample has a payload that is compressed and encrypted via Base64 (Figure 27). To access it, we\nmodified the script to dump the payload instead of executing it (Figure 28). By dumping the payload, we were able to\nobtain LockBit 3.0’s main binary (Figure 29).\n\nWhen it is executed, the script exhibits the same behavior as the previously discovered LockBit 3.0 sample. This\nspecific sample appends 19MqZqZ0s to the file names of encrypted files (Figure 30).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27. LockBit 3.0’s payload\n\nFigure 28. Dumping LockBit 3.0’s payload\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. LockBit 3.0’s main binary\n\nFigure 30. LockBit 3.0’s encrypted files with 19MqZqZ0s appended to their names\nThe payload of this specific LockBit 3.0 sample checks for only three hashed arguments (Figure 31), while the\nprevious LockBit 3.0 sample checks for eight. Its DLL payload is reflectively loaded, and the codes of its propagation\nroutine via admin shares and group policy are designed for PE (Portable Executable) binaries, not for a PowerShell\n\n\n-----\n\nscript, which might explain why some of the routines don t work. Another possibility is that LockBit 3.0 s ransomware\nbuilder might have the option to disable certain routines. This LockBit 3.0 sample with the PowerShell script doesn’t\nneed a pass “key” to run even if there is a check for the -pass argument, although the rest of its routines are the\nsame as those in the abovementioned sample with a Win32 .exe file.\n\nFigure 31. The hashed arguments in the\n\nLockBit 3.0 sample with a PowerShell script\n\n## Locking out ransomware attacks\n\n[The LockBit ransomware gang led the ransomware-as-a-service (Raas) scene in the first quarter of 2022, with 220](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat-lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022)\nself-reported successful RaaS and extortion attacks. One headline-making attack reportedly took place in January,\n[during which LockBit operators claimed to have breached France’s Ministry of Justice. It would be no surprise if](https://www.politico.eu/article/infamous-ransomware-group-claims-it-hacked-frances-justice-ministry/#:~:text=An%20infamous%20cybercriminal%20group%20said,on%20a%20data%20leak%20site.)\nsome of BlackMatter’s affiliates had joined the ranks of the LockBit group, considering LockBit’s recent rise in\nnotoriety, which would explain the many similarities between the two pieces of ransomware.\n\nWith the release of this latest variant — and the launch of LockBit’s bug bounty program, which rewards its affiliates\n— we expect the LockBit ransomware group to be even more active in the coming days. We advise organizations\nand end users to be wary of this new variant, especially since the bug bounty program might help the operators in\nmaking their ransomware an even more formidable one. Best practices for mitigating the risk of a ransomware attack\ninclude:\n\nFollowing the 3-2-1 rule, which involves backing up files in three copies in two different formats, with one copy\nstored off-site. This is a precautionary measure to avoid data loss in case of a ransomware attack.\n[Remaining vigilant against socially engineered emails to reduce the risk of a ransomware infection, as](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/social-engineering)\nransomware is commonly spread through malicious spam email attachments.\n[Keeping applications and programs up to date.
