The attacker is reconfiguring RouterOS\ndevices for remote access, using commands and features of RouterOS itself.\n\nUnfortunately, closing the old vulnerability does not immediately protect these routers. If\nsomebody got your password in 2018, just an upgrade will not help. You must also change\npassword, re-check your firewall if it does not allow remote access to unknown parties, and\nlook for scripts that you did not create.\n\nWe have tried to reach all users of RouterOS about this, but many of them have never been\nin contact with MikroTik and are not actively monitoring their devices. We are working on\nother solutions too.\n\nThere are no new vulnerabilities in these devices. RouterOS has been recently\nindependently audited by several third parties.\n\n\n-----\n\nBest course of action:\n\nKeep your MikroTik device up to date with regular upgrades.\nDo not open access to your device from the internet side to everyone, if you need\nremote access, only open a secure VPN service, like IPsec.\nUse a strong password and even if you do, change it now!\nDon't assume your local network can be trusted. Malware can attempt to connect to\nyour router if you have a weak password or no password.\nInspect your RouterOS configuration for unknown settings (see below).\n\nIn collaboration with independent security researchers, we have found that there exists\nmalware that attempts to reconfigure your MikroTik device from a Windows computer inside\nyour network. This is why it's important to set a better password now (to avoid passwordless\nlogin or a dictionary attack by this malware) and to keep your MikroTik router upgraded\n(since this malware also attempts to exploit the mentioned CVE-2018-14847 vulnerabiliity\nwhich has long been fixed).\n\nConfiguration to look out for and remove:\n\nSystem -> Scheduler rules that execute a Fetch script. Remove these.\nIP -> Socks proxy. If you don't use this feature or don't know what it does, it must be\ndisabled.\nL2TP client named \"lvpn\" or any L2TP client that you don't recognize.\nInput firewall rule that allows access for port 5678.\n\nYou can also work with your ISPs to block the following addresses, which these malicious\nscripts are connecting to:\n\nBlock these tunnel endpoint domains:\n\n*.eeongous.com\n*.leappoach.info\n*.mythtime.xyz\n\nBlock these script download domains:\n\n\n-----\n\n1abcnews.xyz\n1awesome.net\n7standby.com\naudiomain.website\nbestony.club\nciskotik.com\ncloudsond.me\ndartspeak.xyz\nfanmusic.xyz\ngamedate.xyz\nglobalmoby.xyz\nhitsmoby.com\nmassgames.space\nmobstore.xyz\nmotinkon.com\nmy1story.xyz\nmyfrance.xyz\nphonemus.net\nportgame.website\nsenourth.com\nsitestory.xyz\nspacewb.tech\nspecialword.xyz\nspgames.site\nstrtbiz.site\ntakebad1.com\ntryphptoday.com\nwchampmuse.pw\nweirdgames.info\nwidechanges.best\nzancetom.com\n\nAs reported by others on the internet, these domains are also used by the botnet:\n\nbestmade.xyz\ngamesone.xyz\nmobigifs.xyz\nmyphotos.xyz\nonlinegt.xyz\npicsgifs.xyz\n\n[To blog](https://blog.mikrotik.com/)\n\n\n-----",
