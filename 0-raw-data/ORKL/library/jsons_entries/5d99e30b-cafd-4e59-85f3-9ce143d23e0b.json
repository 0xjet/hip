While\nUNC215’s targets are located throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and North America,\nthis report focuses on intrusion activity primarily observed at Israeli entities.\n\n[This report comes on the heels of the July 19, 2021, announcements by governments in](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)\nNorth America, Europe, and Asia and intragovernmental organizations, such as the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the European Union, condemning widespread\ncyber espionage conducted on behalf of the Chinese Government. These coordinated\nstatements attributing sustained cyber espionage activities to the Chinese Government\ncorroborate our long-standing reporting on Chinese threat actor targeting of private\ncompanies, governments, and various organizations around the world, and this blog post\nshows yet another region where Chinese cyber espionage is active.\n\n**Threat Detail**\n\nIn early 2019, Mandiant began identifying and responding to intrusions in the Middle East by\nChinese espionage group UNC215. These intrusions exploited the Microsoft SharePoint\nvulnerability CVE-2019-0604 to install web shells and FOCUSFJORD payloads at targets in\nthe Middle East and Central Asia. There are targeting and high level technique overlaps with\nbetween UNC215 and APT27, but we do not have sufficient evidence to say that the same\nactor is responsible for both sets of activity. APT27 has not been seen since 2015, and\nUNC215 is targeting many of the regions that APT27 previously focused on; however, we\nhave not seen direct connection or shared tools, so we are only able to assess this link with\nlow confidence.\n\nIn addition to data from Mandiant Incident Response and FireEye telemetry, we worked with\nIsraeli defense agencies to review data from additional compromises of Israeli entities. This\nanalysis showed multiple, concurrent operations against Israeli government institutions, IT\nproviders and telecommunications entities beginning in January 2019. During this time,\nUNC215 used new TTPs to hinder attribution and detection, maintain operational security,\nemploy false flags, and leverage trusted relationships for lateral movement. We believe this\nadversary is still active in the region.\n\n**Attack Lifecycle**\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, Mandiant responded to several incidents where Microsoft\nSharePoint vulnerability CVE-2019-0604 was used to deliver web shells, and then\nFOCUSFJORD payloads to select government and academic targets in the Middle East and\nCentral Asia.\n\nAfter gaining initial access, the operators conduct credential harvesting and extensive\ninternal network reconnaissance. This includes running native Windows commands on\ncompromised servers, executing ADFind on the Active Directory, and scanning the internal\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork with numerous publicly available tools and a non-public scanner we named\nWHEATSCAN. The operators made a consistent effort to delete these tools and remove any\nresidual forensic artifacts from compromised systems.\n\nIn another incident response investigation, UNC215 pivoted to multiple OWA servers and\ninstalled web shells. In the following days, the operators interacted with these web shells\nfrom internal IP addresses, attempting to harvest credentials.\n\nAfter identifying key systems within the target network, such as domain controllers and\nExchange servers, UNC215 moved laterally and deployed their signature malware\nFOCUSFJORD. UNC215 often uses FOCUSFJORD for the initial stages of an intrusion, and\nthen later deploys HYPERBRO, which has more information collection capabilities such as\nscreen capture and keylogging. While UNC215 heavily relies on the custom tools\nFOCUSFJORD and HYPERBRO, Chinese espionage groups often have resource sharing\nrelationships with other groups, and we do not have enough information to determine if these\ntools are developed and used exclusively by UNC215.\n\nFigure 1: Attack Lifecycle\n\n**Tradecraft and Operational Security**\n\nWe identified numerous examples of efforts by UNC215 to foil network defenders by\nminimizing forensic evidence left on compromised hosts, exploiting relationships with trusted\nthird parties, continuously improving the FOCUSFJORD backdoor, concealing command and\n\n\n-----\n\ncontrol (C2) infrastructure, and incorporating false flags.\n\n_Reducing Forensic Evidence on Disk_\n\nUNC215 consistently cleaned up evidence of their intrusion after gaining access to a system.\nThis type of action can make it more difficult for incident responders to reconstruct what\nhappened during a compromise.\n\nThe operators deleted tools used for credential harvesting and internal reconnaissance\nincluding a custom scanner dubbed WHEATSCAN after use.\nThe first FOCUSFJORD payload delivered to a system contains a blob that includes\nC2 and other configuration data. On initial execution, FOCUSFJORD writes its\nencrypted C2 configuration into the system’s registry, sets up a persistence mechanism\nand then rewrites itself on disk without the embedded configuration and with limited\nfunctionality to only read configuration data. This process enables the operators to\nobfuscate the configured C2 servers from automated sandbox runs or disclosure in\npublic file scanning services.\nA newly identified utility dubbed FJORDOHELPER can update FOCUSFJORD\nconfigurations and completely remove FOCUSFJORD from the system. The tool can\nbe deployed and executed remotely to delete any remaining FOCUSFJORD forensic\nevidence, including files on disk, configuration data encrypted in the registry, and\nrelated services and registry keys used for persistence.\n\n_Exploiting Trust Relationships_\n\nUNC215 leveraged trusted third parties in a 2019 operation targeting an Israeli government\nnetwork. As illustrated in Figure 2, the operators were able to access their primary target via\nRDP connections from a trusted third party using stolen credentials and used this access to\ndeploy and remotely execute FOCUSFJORD on their primary target.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Two FOCUSFJORD samples configured to proxy C2 traffic\n_Concealing C2 Infrastructure_\n\nUNC215 made technical modifications to their tools to limit outbound network traffic and\nused other victim networks to proxy their C2 instructions, likely to minimize the risk of\ndetection and blend in with normal network traffic. The following are examples of\nHYPERBRO and FOCUSFJORD samples capable of acting as proxies to relay\ncommunications to their C2 servers. We do not have enough context about the following\nsamples to attribute all of them to UNC215, though they are representative of activity we\nhave seen from the group.\n\nHYPERBRO samples MD5: 0ec4d0a477ba21bda9a96d8f360a6848 and MD5:\n04dece2662f648f619d9c0377a7ba7c0 have embedded configurations of internal IP\naddresses (192.168.1.237 and 192.168.4.26 respectively) as C2 servers. If they\nreceive a command with an IP address and port, they will connect and relay the\ncommand.\n\n\n-----\n\nFOCUSFJORD sample MD5: e3e1b386cdc5f4bb2ba419eb69b1b921 has an internal\nIP address, 192.168.4.197, configured as its C2. This sample was extracted from MD5:\nc25e8e4a2d5314ea55afd09845b3e886, which was submitted to a public malware\nrepository in December 2017.\n\nWhile hunting for FOCUSFJORD samples, we found a sample of a new malware (MD5:\n625dd9048e3289f19670896cf5bca7d8) that shares code with FOCUSFJORD, but is distinct.\nHowever, analysis indicates that it only contains functions to relay communications between\nanother FOCUSFJORD instance and a C2 server (Figure 2, Network A). We suspect this\ntype of malware was used in the aforementioned operation. The actors stripped out\nunnecessary FOCUSFJORD capabilities, possibly to reduce the likelihood it would be\ndetected by security controls. Figure 3 contains the data structure as it is being sent from a\nFOCUSFJORD sample configured to communicate with another FOCUSFJORD victim.\n\nFigure 3: Two FOCUSFJORD samples configured to proxy C2 traffic\n_FOCUSFJORD Changes_\n\nWe have observed numerous variants of the FOCUSFJORD malware family since 2017. The\nauthors have added new communications protocols, an updated loading mechanism, and\nexpanded the number of supported configurations in newer versions. Version numbers\nindicate that the malware undergoes frequent changes and maybe supported by a team of\ndevelopers Many of these variants contain or remove functionality depending on the\n\n\n-----\n\noperator s unique requirements at the time, which may suggest that multiple operators have\naccess to the source code or a builder, or that a close relationship exists between the\ndevelopers and operators.\n\nFOCUSFJORD samples can be configured with up to 13 unique registry values which allow\noperators to control and organize compromised hosts. In addition to specifying details related\nto the loading and persistence mechanisms and C2 communications, there are two keys\nwhich allow the operator to add additional context about the victim:\n\nRegistry key 12 is the “group” name. When a new FOCUSFJORD sample is first\nexecuted and writes its configuration to registry, this value is set to “default” and is later\nmanually changed by the actor, usually to the victim’s domain name or organization\nname.\nRegistry key 13 could be interpreted as the “console” name, although we do not fully\nunderstand how the identifier is used by the operators. We have observed the values\n“galway”, “iceland”, “helen”, and “idapro”.\n\nIt is not clear how or if UNC215 uses these configuration parameters to organize and track\nlarge numbers of compromised hosts. We observed different console values within the same\nnetwork, identical console values using different C2 addresses, and identical console values\ntargeting different countries. Some FOCUSFJORD samples from 2018 and 2020 use the\nsame console values despite the significant gap in time (See Table 1).\n\n[The NCC Group discussed these configurations in a 2018 report and released a](https://research.nccgroup.com/2018/05/18/emissary-panda-a-potential-new-malicious-tool/)\n[decoding tool.](https://github.com/nccgroup/Cyber-Defence/tree/master/Scripts/emissary_panda_registry)\nTrendmicro noted changes to supported configurations in FOCUSFJORD, dubbed\n[SysUpdate, in their 2020 and](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-uncovering-DRBcontrol.pdf) [2021 reports following public disclosures. This suggests](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/d/iron-tiger-apt-updates-toolkit-with-evolved-sysupdate-malware-va.html)\nthat operators using FOCUSFJORD are sensitive to security vendor reports and will\nupdate the code to avoid detection and exposure.\n\n[image needed]\n\n\n**Registry Key**\n**13**\n\n\n**FOCUSFJORD MD5 Hash** **Related C2** **Suspected**\n**Target**\n\n\nhelen 3d95e1c94bd528909308b198f3d47620 139.59.81.253 Israel\n\nhelen f335b241652cb7f7e736202f14eb48e9 139.59.81.253 Israel\n\nhelen a0b2193362152053671dbe5033771758 139.59.81.253 Israel\n\nhelen 6a9a4da3f7b2075984f79f67e4eb2f28 139.59.81.253 Kazakhstan\n\n\n-----\n\nhelen a19370b97fe64ca6a0c202524af35a30 159.89.168.83 Iran\n\nhelen 3c1981991cce3b329902288bb2354728 103.59.144.183 Unknown\n\niceland 26d079e3afb08af0ac4c6d92fd221e71 178.79.177.69 UAE\n\niceland 19c46d01685c463f21ef200e81cb1cf1 138.68.154.133 UAE\n\niceland 28ce8dbdd2b7dfd123cebbfff263882c 138.68.154.133 Unknown\n\niceland a78c53351e23d3f84267e67bbca6cf07 206.189.123.156 Israel\n(Gov), UAE\n\niceland a78c53351e23d3f84267e67bbca6cf07 206.189.123.156 Israel (IT)\n\nidapro a78c53351e23d3f84267e67bbca6cf07 206.189.123.156 Israel (IT)\n\ngalway 04c51909fc65304d907b7cb6c92572cd 159.65.80.157 Unknown\n\ngalway 0e061265c0b5998088443628c03188f0 159.65.80.157 Unknown\n\ngalway 09ffc31a432f646ebcec59d32f286317 159.65.80.157 Unknown\n\ngalway 6ca8993b341bd90a730faef1fb73958b 128.199.44.86 Unknown\n\nHelen * Unknown 46.101.255.16 Iran\n\nHelen * Unknown 178.79.143.78 Iran\n\nIdapro * Unknown 138.68.154.133 Iran\n\n[Table 1: FOCUSFJORD comparison (note: the * entries are from public reporting and have](https://www.kamiran.asia/documents/APT27_HackerTeam_Analyse.pdf)\nnot been verified by Mandiant)\n\n_False Flags_\n\n\n-----\n\nArtifacts in UNC215 campaigns often contain foreign language strings that do not match the\ncountry being targeted and may be intended to mislead an analyst examining the malware.\nAdditionally, on at least three occasions, UNC215 employed a custom tool associated with\nIranian actors whose source code was leaked.\n\nIn several cases, we identified FOCUSFJORD samples with registry key names in\nregional languages. The registry key names are hardcoded into every FOCUSFJORD\nsample, as the malware needs to read and decrypt those registry key values for proper\nexecution.\n\nFOCUSFJORD samples (MD5: d13311df4e48a47706b4352995d67ab0 and\nMD5: 26d079e3afb08af0ac4c6d92fd221e71) observed on Israeli and UAE\nnetworks, and a memory dump (MD5: d875858dbd84b420a2027ef5d6e3a512)\nsubmitted to a public malware repository by a likely Uzbekistan financial\norganization are configured with registry keys in Farsi. Linguistic analysis\nsuggests that these terms were auto translated as they are not commonly used\nby native Farsi speakers.\nAnother FOCUSFJORD sample uploaded from Uzbekistan (MD5:\nac431261b8852286d99673fddba38a50) contains a configuration with registry key\nnames in Hindi. Notably, this variant also contains an error message string in\nArabic ('ﺿﺎﺋﻊ' – which translates to: lost or missing).\nIn April 2019, UNC215 deployed the SEASHARPEE web shell against financial and\nhigh-tech organizations in the Middle East and Asia. The SEASHARPEE web shell was\ndeveloped and used by Iranian APT actors until the code was leaked online in the\ntelegram channel Lab Dookhtegan a few weeks earlier in March 2019.\nAround this time, the Turkish-language file Sosyal Güvenlik Reformu-Not-3.doc \"Social\nSecurity Reform - Note - 3.doc\" (MD5: 6930bd66a11e30dee1ef4f57287b1318) was\ndistributed to a suspected Turkish government entity based on data from an opensource malware repository. The document contains \"C:\\Users\\Iran\" paths that were\nlikely included to obfuscate the source of the activity.\n\nThe use of Farsi strings, filepaths containing /Iran/, and web shells publicly associated with\nIranian APT groups may have been intended to mislead analysts and suggest an attribution\n[to Iran. Notably, in 2019 the government of Iran accused APT27 of attacking its government](https://twitter.com/azarijahromi/status/1206071513222467585)\nnetworks and released a detection and removal tool for HYPERBRO malware.\n\n_Tradecraft Mistakes_\n\nWhile UNC215 prioritizes evading detection within a compromised network, Mandiant\nidentified several examples of code, C2 infrastructure, and certificate reuse indicating that\nUNC215 operators are less concerned about defenders’ ability to track and detect UNC215\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn several instances, UNC215 used the same exact file against multiple victims and\nfrequently shared infrastructure across victims. This lack of compartmentalization is not\nuncommon, but does show that UNC215 is relatively less concerned about the ability\nfor their compromises to be linked to each other.\nC2 servers used by UNC215 frequently reuse the same SSL certificate, as described\nin [Team Cymru’s research in 2020.](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Shank-Piccolini.pdf)\nOn one network, between April 2019 and April 2020, an operator repeatedly and\ninfrequently revisited a compromised network whenever an Endpoint Detection and\nResponse (EDR) tool detected or quarantined tools like HYPERBRO and Mimikatz.\nAfter several months of repeated detections, UNC215 deployed an updated version of\nHYPERBRO and a tool called “anti.exe” to stop Windows Update service and terminate\nEDR and Antivirus related services.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nMandiant attributes this campaign to Chinese espionage operators which we track as\nUNC215 a Chinese espionage operation that has been suspected of targeting organizations\naround the world since at least 2014. We have low confidence that UNC215 is associated\nwith APT27. UNC215 has compromised organizations in the government, technology,\ntelecommunications, defense, finance, entertainment, and health care sectors. The group\ntargets data and organizations which are of great interest to Beijing's financial, diplomatic,\nand strategic objectives.\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nThe activity detailed in this post demonstrates China’s consistent strategic interest in the\nMiddle East. This cyber espionage activity is happening against the backdrop of China’s\nmulti-billion-dollar investments related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its interest in\nIsraeli’s robust technology sector.\n\nChinese companies have invested billions of dollars into Israeli technology startups,\npartnering or acquiring companies in strategic industries like semi-conductors and\nartificial intelligence.\nAs China’s BRI moves westward, its most important construction projects in Israel are\nthe railway between Eilat and Ashdod, a private port at Ashdod, and the port of Haifa.\n\nChina has conducted numerous intrusion campaigns along the BRI route to monitor potential\nobstructions—political, economic, and security—and we anticipate that UNC215 will continue\ntargeting governments and organizations involved in these critical infrastructure projects in\nIsrael and the broader Middle East in the near- and mid-term.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK
