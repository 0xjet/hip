    "plain_text": "# Iranian State Broadcaster IRIB Hit by Destructive Wiper Malware\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-state-broadcaster-irib-hits-by_21.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-state-broadcaster-irib-hits-by_21.html)**\n\nFebruary 21, 2022\n\nAn investigation into the cyberattack targeting Iranian national media corporation, Islamic Republic\nof Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), in late January 2022 revealed the deployment of a wiper malware and\n[other custom implants, as the country's national infrastructure continues to face a wave of](https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/a-new-wiper-malware-was-behind-recent.html) [attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/cyber-attack-in-iran-reportedly.html)\naimed at inflicting serious damage.\n\n\"This indicates that the attackers' aim was also to disrupt the state's broadcasting networks, with\nthe damage to the TV and radio networks possibly more serious than officially reported,\" Tel Aviv[based cybersecurity firm Check Point said in a report published last week.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/evilplayout-attack-against-irans-state-broadcaster/)\n\nThe 10-second attack, which took place on January 27, involved the breach of state broadcaster\n[IRIB to air pictures of Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO) leaders Maryam and Massoud Rajavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran)\nalongside a call for the assassination of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"This is an extremely complex attack and only the owners of this technology could exploit and\ndamage the backdoors and features that are installed on the systems,\" Deputy IRIB chief Ali Dadi\nwas [quoted as saying to state TV channel IRINN.](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-state-broadcaster-says-it-was-hacked-10-seconds-2022-01-27/)\n\nAlso deployed during the course of the hack were custom-made malware capable of taking\nscreenshots of the victims' screens as well as backdoors, batch scripts, and configuration files used\nto install and configure the malicious executables.\n\nCheck Point said it didn't have enough evidence to make a formal attribution to a specific threat\nactor, and it's currently not known how the attackers gained initial access to the targeted networks.\nArtifacts uncovered so far include files responsible for –\n\nEstablishing backdoors and their persistence,\nLaunching the \"malicious\" video and audio files, and\nInstalling the wiper malware in an attempt to disrupt operations in the hacked networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nBehind the scenes, the attack involved interrupting the video stream using a batch script to delete\nthe executable associated with TFI Arista Playout Server, a broadcasting software used by IRIB,\nand play the video file (\"TSE_90E11.mp4\") in a loop.\n\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nThe intrusion also paved the way for the installation of a wiper whose main purpose is to corrupt the\n[files stored in the computer, not to mention erase the master boot record (MBR), clear Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)\nEvent Logs, delete backups, kill processes, and change users' passwords.\n\nFurthermore, the threat actor leveraged four backdoors in the attack: WinScreeny,\nHttpCallbackService, HttpService and ServerLaunch, a dropper launched with HttpService. Taken\ntogether, the different pieces of malware enabled the adversary to capture screenshots, receive\ncommands from a remote server, and carry out other malicious activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn one hand, the attackers managed to pull off a complicated operation to bypass security\nsystems and network segmentation, penetrate the broadcaster's networks, produce and run the\nmalicious tools that heavily rely on internal knowledge of the broadcasting software used by victims,\nall while staying under the radar during the reconnaissance and initial intrusion stages,\" the\nresearchers said.\n\n\"On the other hand, the attackers' tools are of relatively low quality and sophistication, and are\nlaunched by clumsy and sometimes buggy 3-line batch scripts. This might support the theory that\nthe attackers might have had help from inside the IRIB, or indicate a yet unknown collaboration\nbetween different groups with different skills.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
