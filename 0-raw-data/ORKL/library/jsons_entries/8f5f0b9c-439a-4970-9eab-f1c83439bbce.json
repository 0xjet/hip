Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North\nKorean government - referred to by the U.S. Government as BADCALL. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North\nKorean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov\n/hiddencobra.\n\nFBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using malware variants in conjunction with proxy servers to maintain a presence on\nvictim networks and to further network exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure\nto North Korean government malicious cyber activity.\n\nThis MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.\nUsers or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and\nCommunications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced\nmitigation.\n\nThis report provides analysis of three (3) malicious executable files. The first two (2) files are 32-bit Windows executables that function as\nproxy servers and implement a \"Fake TLS\" method similar to the behavior described in a previously published NCCIC report,\nMAR-10135536-B. The third file is an Android Package Kit (APK) file designed to run on Android platforms as a fully functioning Remote\nAccess Tool (RAT).\n\nThe following YARA rule may be used to detect the proxy tools:\n\nrule NK_SSL_PROXY{\nmeta:\nAuthor = \"US-CERT Code Analysis Team\"\nDate = \"2018/01/09\"\nMD5_1 = \"C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\"\nMD5_2 = \"C01DC42F65ACAF1C917C0CC29BA63ADC\"\nInfo= \"Detects NK SSL PROXY\"\n\nstrings:\n$s0 = {8B4C24088A140880F24780C228881408403BC67CEF5E}\n$s1 = {568B74240C33C085F67E158B4C24088A140880EA2880F247881408403BC67CEF5E}\n$s2 = {4775401F713435747975366867766869375E2524736466}\n$s3 = {67686667686A75797566676467667472}\n$s4 = {6D2A5E265E676866676534776572}\n$s5 = {3171617A5853444332337765}\n\n$s6 = \"ghfghjuyufgdgftr\"\n$s7 = \"q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdf\"\n$s8 = \"m*^&^ghfge4wer\"\n\n\n-----\n\n($s0 and $s1 and $s2 and $s3 and $s4 and $s5) or ($s6 and $s7 and $s8)\n\n}\n\n\n**Files**\n\n\n**Processed** 3\nc01dc42f65acaf1c917c0cc29ba63adc (C01DC42F65ACAF1C917C0CC29BA63ADC)\nc6f78ad187c365d117cacbee140f6230 (C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230)\nd93b6a5c04d392fc8ed30375be17beb4 (D93B6A5C04D392FC8ED30375BE17BEB4)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Files\n\n### C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\n\n\n**Details**\n\n\n**Name** C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\n\n**Size** 208896\n\n**Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**MD5** c6f78ad187c365d117cacbee140f6230\n\n**SHA1** 5116f281c61639b48fd58caaed60018bafdefe7a\n\n**ssdeep** 1536:X86D0r4QxG5+XCFpaG7+esyzktLYUwnZ7hUOKYUwnZ7hUOaeYUwnZ7hUOKYUwnZr:X8O0IgCvH7+UzktMxzxgRxzx\n9\n**Entropy** 6.83311979555\n\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n**Ahnlab** Backdoor/Win32.Akdoor\n\n\n**PE Information**\n\n\n**Compiled** 2016-02-07T03:17:51Z\n\n\n**PE Sections**\n\n\n**Name** **MD5** **Raw Size** **Entropy**\n\n(header) a8f97910c62034b318e17aa17fb97f1c 4096 0.688105697711\n\n.text 08112b571663ff5ed42e331a00ccce0c 53248 6.50896736344\n\n.rdata ca61927558a4dfe9305eb037a5432960 8192 4.57323662515\n\n.data bb49b2fb00c1ae88ad440971914711a7 139264 6.94127887342\n\n\n.sxdata c58b62cf949e8636ebd5c75f482207c3 4096 0.181138192206\n\n\n**Packers**\n\n\n**Name** **Version** **Entry Point**\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ v6.0 NA NA\n\n\n**Relationships**\n\n\n(F) C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\nRelated_To (S) Figure 1\n(c6f78)\n\n(F) C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\nRelated_To (S) Figure 2\n(c6f78)\n\n(F) C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\nRelated_To (S) Figure 3\n(c6f78)\n\n(F) C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230\nRelated_To (S) Figure 4\n(c6f78)\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nThis file is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable. Analysis indicates this application is designed to force a compromised system to function\nas a proxy server. When executed, the malware binds and listens for incoming connections on port 8000 of the compromised system. The\nproxy session traffic is protected by way of a simple cipher based on rotating XOR and ADD. The cypher will XOR each byte sent with 47h\nand added by 28h. Each byte received by the malware will be XOR’ed by 47h and subtracted by 28h. See Screenshots 1, 2 & 3 for code\nexamples. Notably, this malware attempts to disable the Windows firewall before binding to port 8000 by modifying the following registry key:\n\n--Begin Firewall Reg Key Modified-­\n\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfileGloballyOpenPorts\\\\List\n\n--End Firewall Reg Key Modified-­\n\nAnalysis of this malware indicates it is designed to turn a victim host into a \"hop point\" by relaying traffic to a remote system. When the\nadversary initially connects to a victim’s machine via port 8000, they must first authenticate (over a session secured with the XOR/ADD cipher\ndescribed above) by providing the ASCII string \"1qazXSDC23we”. If the malware does not receive this value, it will terminate the session,\nresponding with the value \"m*^&^ghfge4wer”.\n\nIf the operator authenticates successfully, they can then issue the command \"ghfghjuyufgdgftr\" which instructs the malware to begin\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y p p q y g, p\nproxy session between the operator and another server. During this process, the malware will attempt to authenticate with the destination\nserver by sending the value \"ghfghjuyufgdgftr\" as a challenge. To complete the authentication sequence, the malware expects to receive a\nresponse value of \"q45tyu6hgvhi7^%$sdf\". All challenge & response traffic is encoded using the ADD/XOR cipher described earlier.\n\nImportantly, the connection from this proxy malware to the target proxy system will begin via a \"fake TLS\" connection attempt, similar to the\nbehavior described in a previously released NCCIC report, MAR-10135536-B. Essentially, the malware initiates the TLS session using one of\nseveral public SSL certificates obtained from well known, legitimate internet services and imbedded in the malware. The malware begins a\nTLS session with the proxy target by issuing calls to the OpenSSL functions SSL_new(), SSL_set_fd, and SSL_connect(). The malware then\nsends and receives initial data (authentication values) to and from the target proxy system using the OpenSSL functions SSL_read() and\nSSL_write(). However, the malware never completes the TLS handshake, instead decoding the data upon receipt using the XOR/ADD cipher\ndescribed earlier. See Figures 1-4 for code examples of this process.\n\nThe following is a list of the domains for which the malware contains public SSL certificates, used for initiating the \"FAKE TLS\" sessions:\n\n--Begin SSL cert list -­\n\nmyservice.xbox.com\nuk.yahoo.com\nweb.whatsapp.com\nwww[.]apple.com\nwww[.]baidu.com\nwww[.]bing.com\nwww[.]bitcoin.org\nwww[.]comodo.com\nwww[.]debian.org\nwww[.]dropbox.com\nwww[.]facebook.com\nwww[.]github.com\nwww[.]google.com\nwww[.]lenovo.com\nwww[.]microsoft.com\nwww[.]paypal.com\nwww[.]tumblr.com\nwww[.]twitter.com\nwww[.]wetransfer.com\nwww[.]wikipedia.org\n\n-- End SSL cert list-\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n\n-----\n\nOperator providing command to authenticate with proxy malware.\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n\n-----\n\nCipher used to protect the data received by the proxy server.

Static analysis indicates this application is very similar in structure and function to\nC6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230. However, rather than being a PE32 executable this application is a Windows 32-bit DLL, which\nmust be loaded by an external loader. This external loader was not included within this submission.\n\nThis DLL is designed to force a compromised system to act as a proxy server. This implant is designed to proxy network traffic from an\noperator to another software tool that is being operated by the adversary on a remote system. The traffic to and from this proxy server will be\nprotected with the same simple XOR / ADD cipher used by the malware C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230.\n\nAnalysis of this malware indicates it is designed to bind to and listen for incoming connections on port 443 of a victim’s system after disabling\nthe firewall by modifying the following registry key:\n\n--Begin Firewall Reg Key Modified-­\n\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfileGloballyOpenPorts\\\\List\n\n--End Firewall Reg Key Modified-­\n\nImportantly, analysis indicates this proxy malware expects the incoming system to try to establish a \"fake TLS connection\" as described in\nearlier analysis. Static analysis indicates the OpenSSL library is used to implement this TLS/SSL session in such a way to ensure the SSL\nsession fails. For example, the malware attempts to call the OpenSSL function SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file() with the file netconf.dll as the\nSSL certificate to use (see Figure 5). This application does not drop such a file, therefore this call is likely to fail. Similarly, the malware makes\na call to SSL_CTX_use_ProvateKey_file(), designating the file wbemhost.dll as the authentication certificate. This is most likely done\nintentionally to insure the call will fail.\n\nAfter connecting to this malware via port 443, the operator must issue the challenge value \"qwertyuiop\" to authenticate with the implant. This\nmalware also has the added capability of allowing an operator to collect information about the compromised system. This information is\ncollected using the Windows APIs GetComputerNameW, gethostbyname, and GetAdaptersInfo. In order to use this feature, the operator\nmust issue the instruction value \"ghfghjuyufgdgftr” after authenticating. As with C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230, this malware\nuses the OpenSLL functions ssl_read() and ssl_write() to exchange data with the operator, however the malware uses a simple SUB/XOR\ncipher (as earlier described) to decrypt incoming traffic, indicating the operator is aware the traffic will not be encrypted via SSL.\n\nAnalysis indicates this malware must also authenticate with the destination server to which the operator wishes to proxy traffic. To do so, this\nmalware first sends that remote server the challenge value \"1qazXSDC23we.\" The malware must then receive the following response from\nthe destination server before it will allow the operator to proxy traffic to it: \"m*^&^ghfge4wer” (see Figure 7). The authentication values sent to\nand from this proxy server will be protected via same XOR / ADD cipher utilized by the malware C6F78AD187C365D117CACBEE140F6230.\n\nThe following is a list of the domains for which the malware contains public SSL certificates, used for initiating the \"FAKE TLS\" sessions:\n\n--Begin SSL cert list-­\n\nmyservice.xbox.com\nuk.yahoo.com\nweb.whatsapp.com\nwww[.]apple.com\nwww[.]baidu.com\nwww[.]bing.com\nwww[.]bitcoin.org\n\n\n-----\n\n[ ]\nwww[.]debian.org\nwww[.]dropbox.com\nwww[.]facebook.com\nwww[.]github.com\nwww[.]google.com\nwww[.]lenovo.com\nwww[.]microsoft.com\nwww[.]paypal.com\nwww[.]tumblr.com\nwww[.]twitter.com\nwww[.]wetransfer.com\nwww[.]wikipedia.org\n\n--End SSL cert list-\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n\n**Figure 5**\n\nAbnormal calls to SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file() and SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file().\n\n**Figure 6**\n\n\n-----\n\nOperator providing command to / authenticating with proxy malware\n\n**Figure 7**\n\nMalware checking if \"m*^&^ghfge4wer\" was received from proxy target.\n\n### D93B6A5C04D392FC8ED30375BE17BEB4\n\n\n-----\n\n**Details**\n\n\n**Name** D93B6A5C04D392FC8ED30375BE17BEB4\n\n**Size** 321730\n\n**Type** Java archive data (JAR)\n\n**MD5** d93b6a5c04d392fc8ed30375be17beb4\n\n**SHA1** f862c2899c41a4d1120a7739cdaff561d2490360\n\n**ssdeep** 6144:1c35mQ6aHY0wxxp/2o0uK1uv8q8lY1pr/Cc800a0sdOQypHIKO9kxZ4:+J5Hlwxmo0Tuv8q8i3+c800NsdFyKKOR\n\n**Entropy** 7.98967099439\n\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n**Sophos** Andr/Spy-ANK\n\n**Ikarus** Trojan.AndroidOS.SMForw\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nThis file is a malicious Android APK file.
